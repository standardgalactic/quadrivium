Acknowledgments
Many talented and hardworking people gave their best effort to produce Mastering AutoCAD 
2017 and AutoCAD LT 2017. I offer my sincerest gratitude to those individuals who helped bring 
this book to you.
Heartfelt thanks go out to the editorial and production teams at Sybex for their efforts. Mary 
Beth Wakefield managed the project and helped us all make the right connections. Stephanie 
McComb made sure things got off to a great start and provided support from beginning to end. 
Gary Schwartz skillfully managed the development process. Richard Hawley did an excellent 
technical editing job and offered many great suggestions. On the production side, Christine 
O'Connor kept the production end of things running smoothly, and Liz Welch made sure that I 
wasn't trying out new uses of the English language.
Thanks also go to Denis Cadu, who has always given his support to our efforts over many 
projects. Jim Quanci always gives his generous and thoughtful assistance to us author types. 
Thanks to Elinor Actipis for providing help with general Autodesk matters. Finally, thanks go 
to Melissa D. Schmidt, Shari Nemerovski, and Alison Keller of the AutoCAD Customer Counsel

Introduction 
Welcome to Mastering AutoCAD 2017 and AutoCAD LT 2017. As many readers have already dis-
covered, this book is a unique blend of tutorial and reference, which includes everything that you  
need to get started and stay ahead with Autodesk® AutoCAD® software. With this edition, 
you get coverage of the latest features of both AutoCAD 2017 and AutoCAD LT® 2017 software 
along with detailed information on existing features.
How to Use This Book
Rather than just showing you how each command works, this book shows you AutoCAD 2017 
in the context of a meaningful activity. You’ll learn how to use commands while working on an 
actual project and progressing toward a goal. This book also provides a foundation on which 
you can build your own methods for using AutoCAD and become an AutoCAD expert. For 
this reason, we haven’t covered every single command or every permutation of a command 
response. You should think of this book as a way to get a detailed look at AutoCAD as it’s used 
on a real project. As you follow the exercises, we also encourage you to explore AutoCAD on 
your own, applying the techniques that you learn to your own work.
Both experienced and beginning AutoCAD users will find this book useful. If you aren’t an 
experienced user, the way to get the most out of this book is to approach it as a tutorial—chapter 
by chapter—at least for the first two parts of the book. You’ll find that each chapter builds on 
the skills and information that you learned in the previous one. To help you navigate, the exer-
cises are shown in numbered steps. To address the needs of all readers worldwide, the exercises 
provide both Imperial (feet/inches) and metric measurements. Some exercises use generic units 
of measurement or, if the focus of the exercise is not dependent on the measurement system, 
Imperial is used.
After you’ve mastered the material in Part 1 and Part 2, you can follow your interests and 
explore other parts of the book in whatever order you choose. Part 3 takes you to a more 
advanced skill level. There you’ll learn more about storing and sharing drawing data and how 
to create more complex drawings. If you’re interested in 3D, check out Part 4. If you want to start 
customizing right away, go to Part 5. You can check out Chapter 25 at any time because it gives 
you general information about sharing AutoCAD files with your co-workers and consultants. 
You can also use this book as a ready reference for your day-to-day problems and questions 
about commands. “The Bottom Line” section at the end of each chapter will help you review 
and look at different ways to apply the information that you’ve learned. Experienced users will 
also find this book a handy reference tool.
Finally, you can learn more about AutoCAD through the author-supplied bonus chapters found 
at www.omura.com/chapters. For example, if you run into problems using AutoCAD, see the

section “When Things Go Wrong” in Bonus Chapter 3, “Hardware and Software Tips.” To delve 
into the details of printers and plotting, check out Bonus Chapter 5,” Understanding Plot Styles.”
AutoCAD 2017 and AutoCAD LT 2017
Autodesk has released AutoCAD 2017 and AutoCAD LT 2017 simultaneously. Not surprisingly, 
they’re nearly identical in the way they look and work. You can share files between the two pro-
grams with complete confidence that you won’t lose data or corrupt files. The main differences 
are that AutoCAD LT doesn’t support all of the 3D functions of AutoCAD 2017, nor does it sup-
port the customization tools of AutoLISP® or the .NET Framework. But AutoCAD LT still has 
plenty to offer in both the productivity and customization areas. Because they’re so similar, we 
can present material for both programs with only minor adjustments.
When a feature is discussed that is available only in AutoCAD 2017, you’ll see the AutoCAD 
Only icon. For the purposes of this publication, the “ACAD only” icon means that the relevant 
(or adjacent) content applies only to AutoCAD software and not to AutoCAD LT software.
You’ll also see warning messages when tutorials vary between AutoCAD 2017 and AutoCAD 
LT. If only minor differences occur, you’ll see either a warning message or directions embedded 
in the exercise indicating the differences between the two programs.
We’ve also provided workaround instructions wherever possible when AutoCAD LT doesn’t 
offer a feature found in AutoCAD 2017.
Getting Information Fast
In each chapter, you’ll find extensive tips and discussions in the form of sidebars set off from 
the main text. These provide a wealth of information that we have gathered over years of using 
AutoCAD on a variety of projects in different office environments. You may want to browse 
through the book and read these boxes just to get an idea of how they might be useful to you.
Another available quick reference is Bonus Chapter 4, “System Variables and Dimension 
Styles.” It contains descriptions of all the dimension settings with comments on their uses. If 
you experience any problems, you can consult the section “When Things Go Wrong” in Bonus 
Chapter 3, “Hardware and Software Tips.”

The Minimum System Requirements
This book assumes you have a Windows-based PC with at least a dual-core processor or equiva-
lent CPU. Your computer should have at least one DVD drive and a hard disk with 4 GB or more 
of free space for the AutoCAD program files and about 200 MB of additional space for sample 
files and the workspace. In addition to these requirements, you should have enough free disk 
space to allow for a Windows virtual memory page file that is about 1.5 times the amount of 
installed RAM. Consult your Windows manual or Bonus Chapter 3, “Hardware and Software 
Tips,” available at www.omura.com/chapters, for more on virtual memory.
AutoCAD 2017 runs best on systems with at least 4 GB or more of RAM. Your computer 
should also have a high-resolution monitor and an up-to-date display card. An HD/VGA dis-
play with a resolution of 1366×768 or greater will work fine with AutoCAD, but if you want to 
take full advantage of the 3D features, you should have a 128 MB or greater, OpenGL-capable, 
workstation-class graphics card. We also assume that you’re using a mouse and have the use 
of a printer or a plotter. Finally, you’ll need an Internet connection to take full advantage of the

cance to AutoCAD.
Doing Things in Style
Much care has been taken to see that the stylistic conventions in this book—the use of uppercase 
or lowercase letters, italic or boldface type, and so on—are the ones most likely to help you learn 
AutoCAD. On the whole, their effect should be subliminal. However, you may find it useful to 
be conscious of the following rules:
◆
◆
Menu selections are shown by a series of options separated by the ➢ symbol (for example, 
choose File ➢ New). These are typically used to show selections from a context menu or the 
Application menu, which you will learn about in Chapter 1.
The AutoCAD Free Trial
If you don’t have AutoCAD, you can download and install a trial version from the Autodesk website 
(www.autodesk.com). Be aware that the trial is good for only 30 days and cannot be reinstalled 
to add time to the trial period—don’t start to use it until you’re certain you’ll have plenty of free 
time to practice using AutoCAD.
Free Autodesk Software for Students and Educators
The Autodesk Education Community is an online resource with more than 5 million members that 
enables educators and students to download—for free (see the website for terms and conditions)— 
the same software used by professionals worldwide. You can also access additional tools and mate-
rials to help you design, visualize, and simulate ideas. Connect with other learners to stay current

Chapter  1
Exploring the Interface 
Before you can start to use the new capabilities of the AutoCAD® 2017 software, you must 
become familiar with the basics. If you’re completely new to AutoCAD, you’ll want to read this 
first chapter carefully. It introduces you to many basic operations of AutoCAD, such as open-
ing and closing files, getting a close-up look at part of a drawing, and changing a drawing. If 
you’re familiar with earlier versions of AutoCAD, you should review this chapter anyway to get 
acquainted with the features that you haven’t already used.
Autodesk releases new versions of AutoCAD every year. Part of this strategy is to introduce 
improvements that focus on a particular category of features. AutoCAD 2017 offers updates 
that cover a wide range of features. Many of the more commonly used dialog boxes are now 
resizable or have been enlarged to show more information. Improvements have been made to 
the display quality of 2D drawings as well as performance enhancements for both 2D drawings 
and 3D models. New printing features support 3D printing. PDFs that contain vector drawings 
can be imported as line drawings. Centerline and center marks now have associative editing 
capabilities.
Before you begin the exercises in this chapter, make sure that you have loaded the sample 
files from this book’s web page at www.sybex.com/go/masteringautocad2017. See the intro-
duction for details. If you have purchased the e-book version, please see the introduction for 
instructions on how to download the sample files.
In this chapter, you will learn to

Taking a Guided Tour
First, you’ll get a chance to familiarize yourself with the AutoCAD screen and how you com-
municate with AutoCAD. As you do the exercises in this chapter, you’ll also get a feel for how 
to work with this book. Don’t worry about understanding or remembering everything you see 
in this chapter. You’ll get plenty of opportunities to probe the finer details of the program as 
you work through the later chapters. To help you remember the material, we have included a 
brief set of questions at the end of each chapter. For now, just enjoy your first excursion into 
AutoCAD.

Launching AutoCAD
If you’ve already installed AutoCAD (see Appendix B, “Installing and Setting Up AutoCAD”) 
and are ready to jump in and take a look, proceed with the following steps to launch the 
program:
	
1.	 Choose Start ➢ All Programs ➢ Autodesk ➢ AutoCAD 2017 ➢ AutoCAD 2017. You can 
also double-click the AutoCAD 2017 icon on your Windows Desktop. AutoCAD LT users 
will use AutoCAD LT 2017 in place of AutoCAD 2017.
	
2.	 The AutoCAD Start tab appears, offering options to open existing drawings or to create a 
new drawing. You may also see the Design Feed panel, which allows you to use a cloud-
based collaboration feature. Click the Start Drawing thumbnail in the left side of the view 
under “Get Started” (see Figure 1.1).
	
3.	 The AutoCAD window displays a blank default document named Drawing1.dwg. Users 
may see the Sheet Set Manager palette to the left of the AutoCAD window. In brand-new 
installations, you will see the Design Feed panel. Close the Design Feed panel for now. 
AutoCAD LT users may see the Info palette to the left of the AutoCAD window.
If you’re using the trial version, you’ll see the Product License Activation window before  
step 2. This window shows you the number of days you have left in the trial version. You can 
also activate the product here if you purchase a license. Click the Try button to continue opening 
the program. Now let’s look at the AutoCAD window in detail. Don’t worry if it seems like a lot 
of information. You don’t have to memorize it, but by looking at all of the parts, you’ll be aware of 
what is available in a general way.
The AutoCAD Window
The AutoCAD program window is divided into several parts:
◆
◆
Application menu
◆
◆
Quick Access toolbar
◆
◆
InfoCenter
◆
◆
Ribbon
AutoCAD References in This Book
In this chapter and throughout the rest of the book, when we say AutoCAD, we mean both AutoCAD 
and AutoCAD LT®. Some topics apply only to AutoCAD. In those situations, you’ll see an icon indi-
cating that the topic applies only to AutoCAD and not to AutoCAD LT. If you’re using AutoCAD LT 
2017, these icons can help you focus on the topics that are more relevant to your work by letting 
you skim over items that do not apply.
AutoCAD 2017 is designed to run on Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, and Windows 10. This 
book was written using AutoCAD 2017 running on Windows 7 Professional.

recall a workspace at any time using the Workspace Switching tool in the Quick Access tool-
bar. (You’ll learn more about this tool in the next chapter.) The default workspace in Figure 1.2 
is called the Drafting & Annotation workspace, and it is one of several workspaces built into 
AutoCAD.

AutoCAD for 3D
For 3D modeling work, AutoCAD offers the 3D Modeling workspace and 3D drawing templates. 
The combination of these two features can make AutoCAD look like a very different program, but 
beneath the different appearance, the underlying program is the same. You’ll learn more about 
workspaces and templates later in this chapter and in Chapter 24, “Customizing Toolbars, Menus, 
Linetypes, and Hatch Patterns.” Part 4 of this book shows you the 3D features and tools of AutoCAD 
in more detail.
In the upper-left corner of the AutoCAD program window, the red AutoCAD icon displays 
the Application menu, which offers a set of options not directly related to drawing; we’ll elabo-
rate on this menu in the next section. The Quick Access toolbar at the top of the drawing area 
(shown in Figure 1.3) includes the basic file-handling functions, which you find in nearly all 
Windows programs. The InfoCenter is the AutoCAD online help facility; you’ll learn more 
about it in Chapter 2, “Creating Your First Drawing.” The Ribbon uses icons to provide nearly all 
of the commands that you’ll need; you’ll learn more about it in the section “Using the Ribbon” 
later in this chapter.
The drawing area occupies most of the screen. Everything you draw appears in this area. 
As you move your mouse around, crosshairs appear to move within the drawing area. This

is the drawing cursor that lets you point to locations in the drawing area. You’ll get your first 
chance to work with the drawing area later in the section “Picking Points in the Drawing 
Area.”

Just above the drawing area are the Drawing tabs that let you create new drawings or switch 
between open drawings in a way similar to popular web browsers. Notice the X in the cur-
rent tab, which lets you close the current drawing, and the plus icon just to the right of the tab, 
which lets you create a new drawing or open an existing one. When you click the plus icon, a 
new drawing tab appears that you can save as a new file. Right-click the plus icon, and a context 
menu opens that offers you the option to open an existing drawing or to create a new one in the 
form of an additional tab.
If you hover over the Drawing tab, you’ll see preview images of the model and layouts of the 
drawing. You’ll learn more about model and layout spaces later in this chapter.
Within the drawing area, you see several items along the side and in the corners. The UCS 
icon appears in the lower-left corner. You’ll learn more about the UCS icon in a moment. In the 
upper-right corner, you see the ViewCube. The ViewCube is primarily for 3D modeling, and we 
look at those techniques in Chapter 20, “Creating 3D Drawings.” You’ll also see a Navigation 
bar along the right edge of the AutoCAD window. This bar offers tools that you can use to 
get around in your drawing. Basic tools like Zoom and Pan can be found here as well as some 
advanced tools for viewing 3D models.
The Viewport controls in the upper-left corner of the drawing area offer menu options to 
control 3D and 2D views and visual styles, and they duplicate some of the functions of the 
ViewCube. You’ll explore the Viewport controls when you delve into 3D modeling in  
Chapter 23, “Exploring 3D Mesh and Surface Modeling.”
Just below the drawing area in the lower-left corner are the Model and Layout tabs. These 
tabs enable you to switch quickly between different types of views called the model and layout 
views. You’ll get to see firsthand how these views work in a section called “Working with 
AutoCAD” later in this chapter.
The Command window, located just below the drawing area, gives you feedback about the 
AutoCAD commands as you use them. You can move and resize this window just as you move 
and resize other display components. By default, the Command window is in its docked posi-
tion as shown in Figure 1.4. We’ll elaborate on the Command window in the section “Working 
in the Command Window” later in this chapter.
Below the Command window is the status bar (also shown in Figure 1.4). The status bar gives 
you information at a glance about the state of the drawing. The tools in the status bar offer aids 
to the drafting process.

8  | CHAPTER 1  Exploring the Interface   
Using the Application Menu
The Application menu offers tools to help you manage your AutoCAD files. It is basically the 
File pull-down menu from earlier versions of AutoCAD. Try it out to see how it works:
	
1.	 Click the Application menu icon in the upper-left corner of the AutoCAD window. A list 
of options appears.
	
2.	 Move the cursor slowly down the list of options in the left column. As you highlight the 
options, additional options appear in a column to the right.
	
3.	 Highlight the Export option to see the various formats available for export 
(see Figure 1.5).

the Application menu, you’ll see Recent Documents in the upper-left portion of the menu. You’ll 
also see two icon tools, named Open Documents and Recent Documents (see Figure 1.6).
Figure 1.6

The Open Documents option lets you quickly change from one open file to another when you 
are viewing your files full-screen. The Recent Documents option displays a list of documents on 
which you’ve recently worked.
You can use the View tool in the upper-right portion of the Application menu to select the 
way the list of files is displayed in a manner similar to the way you would use the Windows 
Explorer View option. You can click this icon and select Small Images to have the list display the 
files with thumbnail images of their content. Hover over a filename and you will see a tool tip 
that displays a larger thumbnail of the drawing.
Using the Ribbon
The most prominent feature in the AutoCAD window, besides the drawing area, is the Ribbon 
(see Figure 1.7). This is where you’ll be selecting tools to draw, edit, or perform other functions. 
The Ribbon contains a set of panels representing groups of tools and features. The name of 
each Ribbon panel is found in its title bar at the bottom of the panel. Tabs that appear above the 
Ribbon panels further organize them. Each tool in the Ribbon offers a tool tip and cue card that 
provides a short description to help you understand what the tool icon represents.
If you see only the Ribbon tabs, click the arrowhead button in the Ribbon Control tool. If you 
don’t even see the tabs, type Ribbon↵.

Move the arrow cursor onto one of the Ribbon panel tools and leave it there for a moment; 
you’ll see a tool tip appear just below the cursor. Hold the cursor there a bit longer and the tool 
tip changes to give you even more information about the tool.
In most cases, you’ll be able to guess what each tool does by looking at its icon. The icon with 
an arc in the Draw Ribbon panel, for instance, indicates that the tool draws arcs; the one with 
the circle shows that the tool draws circles; and so on. For further clarification, the tool tip gives 
you the name of the tool.
Communicating with the Command Window and Dynamic Input Display
AutoCAD is the perfect servant: It does everything you tell it to do and no more. You communicate 
with AutoCAD by using tools and menu options, which invoke AutoCAD commands. A command is 
a single-word instruction you give to AutoCAD telling it to do something, such as draw a line (the 
Line tool in the Draw Ribbon panel) or erase an object (the Erase tool in the Modify Ribbon panel). 
Whenever you invoke a command, either by typing it or by selecting an option or tool, AutoCAD 
responds by presenting messages to you in the Command window and the Dynamic Input display 
or by displaying a dialog box. The Dynamic Input display is the display of information that appears 
at the cursor and consists of messages, dimensions, and coordinates.
The messages in the Command window, or in the Dynamic Input display, often tell you what to do 
next, or they may display a list of available options. A single command often presents a series of 
messages that you answer to complete the command. These messages serve as an aid to new users 
who need a little help. If you ever get lost while using a command or forget what you’re supposed 
to do, look at the Command window for clues. As you become more comfortable with AutoCAD, 
you’ll find that you won’t need to refer to these messages as frequently.

Taking a Guided Tour |  11  
As a new user, you’ll find these tool tips helpful because they show you the name of the tool 
and a brief description of how to use it. Typically, when we ask you to select a tool, we’ll use the 
name shown in the tool tip to help you identify the tool. In the case of a tool with flyouts, the 
tool name changes under different conditions. For those tools, we’ll use a general description 
to identify the tool. You’ll learn more about flyouts a bit later in this chapter (see the section 
“Understanding Flyouts”).
As you work through this book, we’ll ask you to select tools from the Ribbon panels. You’ll 
often be asked to switch between different tabs to select tools from other sets of panels. To make 
the process simpler to read, we’ll use a somewhat abbreviated description of a tool’s location. 
For example, for the Line tool we’ll say, “Click the Line tool in the Home tab’s Draw panel.” For 
the Move tool, we’ll say, “Click the Move tool in the Home tab’s Modify panel.”
Expanding Hidden Panels
In addition to the visible tools, some buttons are hidden from view. You can expand many of the 
Ribbon panels to select more of them. If you see an arrowhead to the right of a panel’s title bar, 
you can click the title bar to expand the panel (see Figure 1.8). The panel expands to reveal addi-
tional tools. If you move the cursor to the drawing area, the expanded panel shrinks to its origi-
nal size. You can also click the pushpin icon in the expanded panel title bar to lock the panel in 
its open position.
From now on, we’ll refer to the location of additional tools as the expanded panel. For exam-
ple, we’ll say, “Click the Ray tool in the expanded Draw panel” when we want you to select the 
Ray tool.
If you are working on a smaller screen with low resolution, some of the Ribbon panels to the 
far right may look different from what you are shown in this book. On a low-resolution screen, 
AutoCAD will automatically reduce the size of the panels to the right of the Ribbon so that they 
show only their title (see Figure 1.9).
To see the tools, hover over the panel (see Figure 1.10).
Finally, the Workspace drop-down menu in the Quick Access toolbar may be hidden from 
view in a low-resolution display. If you don’t see these options in your AutoCAD window, 
click the double arrowhead icon to the far right of the Quick Access toolbar to reveal it. If you 
still don’t see the Workspace menu, click the downward-pointing arrow icon at the far-right 
You can also right-click to display a set of options that relate directly to your current activity. 
For example, if you right-click before picking the first point for the Rectangle command, a set of 
options appears displaying the same options that are listed in the Command prompt along with 
some additional options.
Finally, the Dynamic Input display allows you to enter dimensional data of objects as you draw 
them. Besides echoing the command-line messages, the Dynamic Input display shows temporary 
dimensions, coordinates, and angles of objects that you’re drawing and editing. As you enter coor-
dinate or angle values through the keyboard, they appear in the Dynamic Input display. You can 
easily turn the Dynamic Input display on or off by clicking the Dynamic Input tool when it is visible 
in the status bar or by setting the Dynmode command to 0 for off or 3 for on. When the Dynamic 
Input display is turned off, your keyboard input appears only in the Command window.

Understanding Flyouts
The flyouts are one more feature that you’ll want to know about. Flyouts are similar to expanded 
panels because you can click an arrowhead to gain access to additional tools. Unlike a whole 
panel, however, flyouts give you access to different methods for using a particular tool. For 
example, AutoCAD lets you draw circles in several ways, so it offers a flyout for the Circle tool in 

Taking a Guided Tour |  13  
the Home tab’s Draw panel. If you click the arrowhead below the Circle icon in the Draw panel, 
you’ll see additional tools for drawing circles (see Figure 1.11).
Figure 1.11
Flyouts
Click the ﬂyout arrowhead 
to display additional tools.
If you select a tool option from a flyout, that option becomes the default tool for the icon you 
chose. For example, when you hover your cursor over the Circle icon in the Draw panel, the tool 
tip shows “Center, Radius” for the tool’s name. If you click the arrowhead below the Center, 
Radius tool and select 2-Point, then 2-Point becomes the default tool and you’ll see “2-Point” for 
the name of the tool in the tool tip (see Figure 1.12).

will change to the last 
tool used.

as Center, Radius…
Select 2-Point from the 
ﬂyout and the default Circle 
tool becomes 2-Point.
General Tool Names vs. Tool Tip Names
Because the tool tip for tools with flyouts can change, describing them by name can be a bit prob-
lematic. The name may have changed based on the last tool you used from a flyout. For this reason, 
if a tool has a flyout, we’ll refer to it by a general name that is related to the set of tools contained 
continues

14  | CHAPTER 1  Exploring the Interface   
Tools vs. the Keyboard
Throughout this book, you’ll be told to select tools from the Ribbon panels to invoke commands. 
For new and experienced users alike, the Ribbon panels offer an easy-to-remember method for 
accessing commands. If you’re an experienced AutoCAD user, you can type commands directly 
from the keyboard. Most of the keyboard commands you know and love still work as they did 
before.
Many tools and commands have aliases. Aliases are one-, two-, or three-letter abbreviations of a 
command name. As you become more proficient with AutoCAD, you may find these aliases helpful. 
As you work through this book, the shortcuts will be identified for your reference.
Finally, if you’re feeling adventurous, you can create your own aliases and keyboard shortcuts for 
executing commands by adding them to the AutoCAD support files. Chapter 24 discusses how to 
customize menus, Ribbon panels, toolbars, and keyboard shortcuts.
Picking Points in the Drawing Area
Now that you’ve seen the general layout of AutoCAD, take a look at the coordinate read-
out and the drawing cursor to get a sense of how the parts of the AutoCAD screen work 
together:
	
1.	 Move the cursor around in the drawing area. As you move it, notice how the coordinate 
readout changes to tell you the cursor’s location. It shows the coordinates in an X, Y, Z 
format. If the coordinates are not shown on the status bar, click the customization tool at 
the bottom-right corner of the AutoCAD window and click the Coordinates option check 
mark. The coordinate readout will then be visible. The Customization tool looks like 
three horizontal bars. See “Can’t Find the Tool or Panel We’re Discussing?” later in this 
chapter for more information.
	
2.	 Place the cursor in the middle of the drawing area and click the left mouse button. 
Move the cursor and a rectangle follows. This is a window selection; you’ll learn more 
about this window in Chapter 2. You also see a coordinate readout following the cur-
sor and the message Specify opposite corner or . This display at the cursor is 
called the Dynamic Input display. You’ll learn more about it a little later in this chapter 
(see Figure 1.13).
within it rather than by the tool tip name. For example, we’ll call the circle icon tool the Circle tool 
rather than the Center, Radius tool.
Circle tool
continued

Taking a Guided Tour |  15  
	
3.	 Move the cursor a bit in any direction, and then click the left mouse button again. Notice 
that the window selection disappears, as does the Dynamic Input display.
	
4.	 Try picking several more points in the drawing area. Notice that, as you click, you alter-
nately start and end a window selection. If you happen to click and drag, you will see 
a “lasso” selection (see “Click and Drag to Lasso Objects” in Chapter 2 for more on the 
“Lasso” selection method).
If you happen to click the right mouse button, a context menu appears. A right-click fre-
quently opens a menu containing options that are context sensitive. This means the contents of 
the menu depend on the location where you right-click as well as the command that is active 
at the time. If there are no appropriate options at the time of the right-click, AutoCAD treats 
the right-click as an Enter (↵) keystroke. You’ll learn more about these options as you progress 
through the book. For now, if you happen to open this menu by accident, press the Esc key to 
close it.
Using the UCS Icon
In the lower-left corner of the drawing area, you see an L-shaped line. This is the User 
Coordinate System (UCS) icon, which tells you your orientation in the drawing. This icon 
becomes helpful as you start to work with complex 2D drawings and 3D models. The X and 
Y indicate the x- and y-axes of your drawing. Chapter 21, “Using Advanced 3D Features,” 
discusses this icon in detail. For now, you can use it as a reference to tell you the direction of 
the axes.
Figure 1.13
The Dynamic Input 
display cursor
If You Can’t Find the UCS Icon
The UCS icon can be turned on and off, so if you’re on someone else’s system and you don’t see the 
icon or it doesn’t look like it does in this chapter, don’t panic. See Chapter 21 for more information.
Working in the Command Window
As mentioned earlier, at the bottom of the screen, just above the status bar, is a small hori-
zontal window called the Command window. Here AutoCAD displays responses to your input 
while you’re using a command. By default, it shows one line of text. This line shows the cur-
rent responses to your command input as well as command options. As you work through a 

16  | CHAPTER 1  Exploring the Interface   
command, you’ll see more responses, with earlier responses scrolling upward in faded text. 
You can view text that has scrolled out of sight by clicking the up-pointing arrowhead at the 
far right of the Command window. Right now, the command line displays the words “Type 
a command” in a box (see Figure 1.4, earlier in this chapter). This tells you that AutoCAD is 
waiting for a command. When you click a point in the drawing area, you see the message 
Specify opposite corner:. At the same time, the cursor starts to draw a window selection 
that disappears when you click another point. The same message appears in the Dynamic 
Input display at the cursor.
As a new user, pay special attention to messages displayed in the Command window and 
the Dynamic Input display because this is how AutoCAD communicates with you. Besides 
giving you messages, the Command window records your activity within AutoCAD. You can 
use the scroll bar to the right of the Command window to review previous messages. You can 
also enlarge the window for a better view. (Chapter 2 discusses these components in more 
detail.)
Now let’s look at the AutoCAD window components in detail.
The Command Window and Dynamic Input Display
The Command window and the Dynamic Input display allow AutoCAD to provide text feedback on your 
actions. You can think of these features as a chat window for communicating with AutoCAD—as you 
enter commands, AutoCAD responds with messages. As you become more familiar with AutoCAD, you 
may find that you don’t need to rely on the Command window and Dynamic Input display as much. 
For new and casual users, however, the Command window and Dynamic Input display can be helpful 
in understanding what steps to take as you work.
Working with AutoCAD
Now that you’ve been introduced to the AutoCAD window, you’re ready to try using a few 
AutoCAD commands. First you’ll open a sample file and make a few modifications to it. In the 
process, you’ll become familiar with common methods of operation in AutoCAD.
Opening an Existing File
In this exercise, you’ll get a chance to see and use a typical Select File dialog box.
Before you start, make sure that you have installed the sample files for this book from the 
book’s web page. See the introduction for instructions on how to find the sample files.
To start, you’ll open an existing file:
	
1.	 In the Drawing tab at the top left of the drawing area, click the Close icon to the far right 
of the tab.
A message appears, asking whether you want to save the changes you’ve made to the 
current drawing. Click No.
	
2.	 In the Start tab, click the Open Files option just below the Start Drawing icon in the left 
column. The Select File dialog box opens. This is a typical Windows file dialog box with 

Working with AutoCAD |  17  
an added twist: In the large Preview box on the right, you can preview a drawing before 
you open it, thereby saving time while searching for files. To the left is a panel known as 
the Places list, in which you can find frequently used locations on your computer or the 
Internet (see Figure 1.14).
Figure 1.14
The Select File dialog 
box
If you don’t see a Preview box in the Select File dialog box, click the word Views in the 
upper-right corner and select Preview from the list that appears. Note that the Select File 
dialog box can be resized if you need to view more of your drawing list.
	
3.	 In the Select File dialog box, open the Look In drop-down list and locate the Chapter 1 
folder of the Mastering AutoCAD 2017 sample files. (You may need to scroll through the 
list to find it.)
	
4.	 Move the arrow cursor to the clip.dwg file and click it. Notice that the clip.dwg file-
name now appears in the File Name text box below the file list. The Preview box also now 
shows a thumbnail image of the file. Be aware that a thumbnail may not show for files 
from older versions of AutoCAD.
	
5.	 Click the Open button at the bottom of the Select File dialog box. AutoCAD opens the 
clip.dwg file, as shown in Figure 1.15.

18  | CHAPTER 1  Exploring the Interface   
The clip.dwg file opens to display a layout view of the drawing. A layout is a type of view 
in which you lay out different views of your drawing in preparation for printing. You can tell 
you are in a layout view by the white area over the gray background. This white area represents 
your drawing on a printed page. This view is like a print preview.
Also note that the AutoCAD window’s title bar displays the name of the drawing. The name 
is also displayed in the Drawing tab. This offers easy identification of the file.
This particular file contains both 2D drawings and a 3D model of a typical locking clip. The 
layout view shows top, front, and right-side views as well as an isometric view.
Getting a Closer Look
One of the most frequently used commands is Zoom, which gives you a closer look at part of 
your drawing. This command offers a variety of ways to control your view. In this section, you’ll 
enlarge a portion of the clip drawing to get a more detailed look. You use a zoom window to tell 
AutoCAD which area you want to enlarge.
You’ll start by switching to a Model Space view of the drawing. The Model Space view places 
you in a workspace where you do most of your drawing creation and editing. Follow these steps:
	
1.	 Hover over the Clip tab at the top left of the drawing area (see the left panel in Figure 1.16). 
You’ll see two preview icons showing the Model Space on the left and the layout on the 
right. If you hover over the Model Space image, the drawing area will temporarily change 
to show you the full view of the Model Space.

2.	 Click the image on the left showing the Model Space (see Figure 1.16).
Your view changes to show the full 3D model with the 2D representations of the model 
(see Figure 1.17). You can also click the Model tab below the drawing area (see the right 
panel in Figure 1.16) to accomplish the same change from the layout to Model Space.

4.	 Click the Zoom Window tool from the Zoom flyout in the Navigation bar (see Figure 1.19). 
Remember that to open the flyout, you need to click the arrowhead next to or below the 
tool.
	
3.	 Type PLAN↵↵. Your display changes to a two-dimensional view looking down on the 
drawing, as shown in Figure 1.18.

20  | CHAPTER 1  Exploring the Interface   
You can also click the Window tool from the Zoom flyout in the View tab’s Navigate 
panel (see Figure 1.20) or type the command Z↵W↵. If you don’t see the Navigate panel, 
right-click in the Ribbon and choose Show Panels ➢ Navigate.

Select Window.
	
5.	 The Dynamic Input display shows the Specify first corner: prompt. Look at the 
image in Figure 1.18. Move the crosshair cursor to a location similar to the one shown 
in the figure labeled “First click here,” and then left-click. Move the cursor, and the rect-
angle appears with one corner fixed on the point you just picked; the other corner follows 
the cursor.
	
6.	 The Dynamic Input display now shows the Specify opposite corner: prompt. 
Position the other corner of the zoom window so that it encloses the lower image of the 
clip, as shown in Figure 1.18, and left-click the mouse again. The clip enlarges to fill the 
screen.
In this exercise, you used the Window option of the Zoom command to define an area to 
enlarge for your close-up view. You saw how AutoCAD prompts you to indicate first one corner 
of the window selection and then the other. These messages are helpful for first-time users of 
AutoCAD. You’ll use the Window option frequently—not just to define views but also to select 
objects for editing.

Working with AutoCAD |  21  
Getting a close-up view of your drawing is crucial to working accurately, but you’ll often 
want to return to a previous view to get the overall picture. To do so, choose Zoom Previous 
from the Zoom flyout in the Navigation bar (see Figure 1.21). You may also type Z↵P↵.
Figure 1.21
The Zoom Previous 
option
Do this now and the previous view appears. Click Zoom Previous again, and the view show-
ing the entire clip returns to the screen.
You can quickly enlarge or reduce your view by using the Zoom Realtime option of the 
Zoom command. Follow these steps to change your view with Zoom Realtime:
	
1.	 Click the Zoom Realtime option from the Navigation bar’s Zoom flyout. You can also 
type Z↵↵.
	
2.	 Place the Zoom Realtime cursor slightly above the center of the drawing area, and then 
click and drag downward. Your view zooms out to show more of the drawing.
	
3.	 While still holding the left mouse button, move the cursor upward. Your view zooms in 
and enlarges. When you have a view similar to the one shown in Figure 1.22, release the 
mouse button. (Don’t worry if you don’t get exactly the same view as the figure. This is 
just for practice.)
Figure 1.22
The final view you 
want to achieve in step 
3 of the exercise
	
4.	 You’re still in Zoom Realtime mode. Click and drag the mouse again to see how you can 
further adjust your view. To exit, you can select another command besides Zoom or Pan, 
or press the Esc key twice.

22  | CHAPTER 1  Exploring the Interface   
If you prefer, you can use the wheel on your mouse to zoom and pan over your view. Roll 
the wheel to zoom in and out, or click and drag the wheel to pan. Be aware that Zoom Realtime 
offers finer control over the amount of magnification than does the mouse wheel.
As you can see from this exercise, you have a wide range of options for viewing your draw-
ings just by using a few tools. These tools are all you need to control the display of 2D drawings.
Saving a File as You Work
It’s a good idea to save your file periodically as you work on it. As with any Windows program, 
you can save it under its original name (click the Save tool on the Quick Access toolbar) or under 
a different name (choose Save As from the Application menu or the Quick Access toolbar), 
thereby creating a new file.
By default, AutoCAD automatically saves your work at 10-minute intervals under a name that 
is a combination of the current filename plus a number and that ends with the .sv$ filename 
extension. This is known as the Automatic Save feature. Using settings in the Options dialog box 
or system variables, you can change the name of the autosaved file and control the time between 
autosaves. See “The Open and Save Tab” in Appendix B for details.
“I Can’t Find My Automatic Saves!”
As an IT manager at ELS Architecture and Urban Planning, this author (George) is often asked, 
“Where does AutoCAD put the Automatic Save files?” By default, in Windows 7, Windows 8, and 
Windows 10 the Automatic Save file is stored in C:\Users\User Name\appdata\local\temp\. 
You can find the exact location for your system by typing Savefilepath↵ at the Command prompt. 
This file location is often set as a hidden folder, so you may need to set up File Explorer to display 
hidden folders before you can get to the Automatic Save file. You can also specify a different loca-
tion for the Automatic Save files. See Appendix B for information on how to locate hidden files and 
specify a location for your files.
Making Changes
You’ll frequently make changes to your drawings. One of the primary advantages of AutoCAD 
is the ease with which you can make modifications. The following exercise shows you a typical 
sequence of operations involved in changing a drawing:
	
1.	 Use the Save As option in the Application menu to save the current clip.dwg file under 
the name MyFirst. For convenience, you can save your files in the My Documents folder.
	
2.	 From the Home tab’s Modify panel, click the Erase tool.
Notice that the cursor has turned into a small square. This square is called the pickbox. 
You also see Select objects: in the Command window and the Dynamic Input display. 
This message helps remind new users what to do.
	
3.	 Move the pickbox over the drawing, placing it on various parts of the clip. Don’t click 
anything yet. Notice that as you hover your cursor over objects with the pickbox, they’re 
dimmed and a red X appears by the cursor. This helps you see the objects that the pick-
box is likely to select and erase should you click the left mouse button.

Working with AutoCAD |  23  
	
4.	 Place the pickbox on the crosshatch pattern of the clip (see Figure 1.23), and click. The 
crosshatch dims. The pickbox and the Select objects: prompt remain, indicating that 
you can continue to select objects.
Figure 1.23
Erasing a portion of 
the clip
Click here.
	
5.	 Press ↵. The crosshatch disappears. You’ve just erased a part of the drawing.
In this exercise, first you issued the Erase command, and then you selected an object by using 
a pickbox to click it. The pickbox tells you that you must select items on the screen, and it shows 
you what you’re about to select by highlighting objects as you hover the cursor over them. Once 
you’ve clicked an object or a set of objects, press ↵ to move on to the next step. This sequence of 
steps is common to many of the commands you’ll work with in AutoCAD.
You can also click an object or a set of objects and then press the Delete key.
Working with Multiple Files
You can have multiple documents open at the same time in AutoCAD. This feature can be 
especially helpful if you want to exchange parts of drawings between files or if you want 
another file open for reference. Try the following exercise to see how multiple documents  
work in AutoCAD:
	
1.	 In the Start tab, locate the Templates option at the bottom of the Start Drawing icon and 
click it (see Figure 1.24).
Figure 1.24
Click the Templates 
option below the Start 
Drawing icon.

24  | CHAPTER 1  Exploring the Interface   
	
2.	 Select acad.dwt from the drop-down list.
	
3.	 Go to the Ribbon and, in the View tab’s Interface panel, click Tile Vertically to get a view 
of both drawing files and the Start tab.
	
4.	 Click the minimize button in the upper-right corner of the Start tab window, and then 
click Tile Vertically in the Interface panel again to get a better view of the two drawings.
When you create a new file in AutoCAD, you’re actually opening a copy of a template file, as 
you saw in step 1. A template file is a blank file that is set up for specific drawing types. The 
acad.dwt file is a generic template set up for Imperial measurements. Another template file, 
called acadiso.dwt, is a generic template useful for metric measurements. Other templates are 
set up for specific drawing-sheet sizes and measurement systems. You’ll learn more about tem-
plates in Chapter 6, “Editing and Reusing Data to Work Efficiently.”
Next let’s try drawing a rectangle to see how AutoCAD behaves while drawing objects:
	
1.	 Making sure that you have the newly created drawing as the active window, click the 
Rectangle tool in the Home tab’s Draw panel, as shown in Figure 1.25.
Figure 1.25
Click the Rectangle 
tool in the Draw panel.
Notice that the Command window now shows the following prompt:
Specify first corner point or
[Chamfer/Elevation/Fillet/Thickness/Width]:
AutoCAD is asking you to select the first corner for the rectangle, and in brackets, it’s 
offering a few options of which you can take advantage at this point in the command. 
Don’t worry about those options right now. You’ll have an opportunity to learn about 
command options in Chapter 2. You also see the same prompt, minus the bracketed 
options, in the Dynamic Input display at the cursor. You can view the command options 
at the cursor by pressing the down arrow key on your keyboard.
	
2.	 Click a point roughly in the lower-left corner of the drawing area, as shown in Figure 1.26. 
Now as you move your mouse, a rectangle follows the cursor, with one corner fixed at the 
position you just selected. You also see the following prompt in the Command window, 
with a similar prompt in the Dynamic Input display:
Specify other corner point or [Area/Dimensions/Rotation]:
	
3.	 Click another point anywhere in the upper-right region of the drawing area (see Figure 1.27). 
A rectangle appears. You’ll learn more about the different cursor shapes and what they mean 
in Chapter 2.

After you’ve selected 
the first point of the 
rectangle, you’ll see a

motion of your mouse.
	
4.	 Let’s try copying objects between these two files. Click in the window with the clip draw-
ing to make it active.
	
5.	 Click Zoom All from the Zoom flyout of the Navigation bar to get an overall view of the 
drawing (see Figure 1.28). You can also type Z↵A↵.
Figure 1.28
The Zoom All option 
gives you an overall 
view of your drawing.

26  | CHAPTER 1  Exploring the Interface   
	
6.	 Click the 2D version of the clip at the bottom of the drawing to select it. A dot appears 
at the center of the clip, and a rectangle encloses it. You may find that some parts of the 
drawing within the rectangle have not been highlighted. If this happens, just click them 
in addition to the main clip drawing. The dot is called a grip; you’ll learn more about 
grips in the next chapter (see Figure 1.29).
Figure 1.29
Grip shown in the 2D 
drawing
Select this part 
of the drawing.
	
7.	 Right-click, select Clipboard, and then select Copy. You can also press Ctrl+C to invoke 
the Windows Copy To Clipboard shortcut.
	
8.	 Click inside the other drawing window to make it active.
	
9.	 Right-click, select Clipboard, and then select Paste. You can also press Ctrl+V to invoke 
the Windows Paste From Clipboard shortcut. The Specify Insertion Point prompt 
appears.
	
10.	 Click inside the rectangle. The clip appears at the cursor in the new drawing.
	
11.	 This ends the exercises for this chapter. Save your myfirst.dwg file for future reference. 
You can close the new drawing without saving it.
Lose the Navigation Bar?
If for some reason the Navigation bar is not visible, you can find it on the View tab’s Viewport 
Tools panel. Click the Navigation Bar tool. The tool will highlight in blue and the Navigation bar 
will appear. This panel also shows the tool to display the UCS Icon and ViewCube if they also get 
misplaced.
Note that you’ve had two files open at once. You can have as many files open as you want as 
long as your computer has adequate memory to accommodate them. You can control the indi-
vidual document windows as you would any window, using the window control buttons in the 
upper-right corner of the drawing area.

Working with AutoCAD |  27  
Adding a Predrawn Symbol with the Tool Palettes
In the preceding exercise, you saw how you could easily copy an object from one file to another 
by using the standard Windows Cut and Paste feature. AutoCAD offers several tool palettes that 
enable you to click and drag predrawn objects into your drawing.
You can open the tool palettes by clicking the Tool Palettes tool in the View tab’s Palettes 
panel, as shown in Figure 1.30.
Figure 1.30
Open the Tool Palettes 
tool from the View tab.
View tab

Once the tool palettes are open, you can select a tab containing the predrawn objects you 
want to use and then click the specific object you want to add. The object appears at the cursor, 
ready for you to select a location (see Figure 1.31).
Figure 1.31
The tool palettes offer 
predrawn symbols that 
you can easily place in 
your drawings.
The symbol appears at the cursor ready to be placed in the drawing.
Select a tab containing predrawn 
symbols you want to use.
Click a symbol.
In addition to predrawn objects, the tool palettes offer a way to add hatch patterns and other 
components quickly to your drawing. They’re great tools to help you manage your library of 

28  | CHAPTER 1  Exploring the Interface   
custom, predrawn symbols. Chapter 25, “Managing and Sharing Your Drawings,” shows you 
how to use and customize the tool palettes.
Can’t Find the Tool or Panel We’re Discussing?
The AutoCAD interface is easy to customize, and sometimes tools and options are hidden from 
view due to changes other users have made or as a result of changes from our review software 
to the final release version. If you don’t see a tool or icon we’re asking you to use in this or 
other chapters, here are a few places to check.
Quick Access Toolbar    If you don’t see an icon in the Quick Access toolbar, you can click 
the Customize Quick Access Toolbar tool at the right end of the toolbar to open a list of addi-
tional Quick Access toolbar options.
Customize Quick Access Toolbar
Options that already appear in the toolbar show a check mark next to their name in the menu. 
Click the option that you want to have visible in the toolbar to make it visible. Clicking on an 
option that shows a check mark will hide that option from the toolbar.
Status Bar    Items missing from the status bar can be found by clicking the Customization 
tool in the lower-right corner of the AutoCAD window.
This opens a menu of tools that can be added to the status bar. Just as with the Quick Access 
toolbar, items that already appear in the status bar will display a check mark in the menu next 
to their name. If you need to check and uncheck multiple options, you can turn on the Lock UI 
option in the list. Lock UI keeps the menu open after making a selection.
Ribbon    If a Ribbon panel or Ribbon tab is missing, you can right-click in the Ribbon panel 
to open a menu that offers a list of available panels and tabs.
If you select the Show Tabs option, you will see a list of all of the tabs that are available for the 
current workspace. If you select the Show Panels option, you will see a list of panels that are 
available for the current Ribbon tab.

The Bottom Line |  29  
USC Icon, ViewCube, and Navigation Bar    Some of the more useful panels in the 
AutoCAD interface can be turned on and off through tools in the Ribbon. The UCS Icon, 
ViewCube, and Navigation bar can be controlled through tools in the View tab’s Viewport 
Tools panel.
On the View tab
Reset AutoCAD to the Default Settings    Finally, if your version of AutoCAD looks com-
pletely different from what you see here, you can reset your AutoCAD profile to the default 
settings.
	1.	 Type options↵.
	2.	 In the Options dialog box, select the Profiles tab at the upper right.
	3.	 Click the Reset button in the right-hand column.
	4.	 Click OK to exit the Options dialog box.
See “The Profiles Tab” in Appendix B for more information on how to save and restore the way 
AutoCAD is set up. Note that AutoCAD LT 2017 does not have a Profiles tab.
The Bottom Line
Use the AutoCAD window.    AutoCAD is a typical Windows graphics program that makes 
use of menus, toolbars, Ribbon panels, and palettes. If you’ve used other graphics programs, 
you’ll see at least a few familiar tools.
Master It    Name the components of the AutoCAD window that you can use to select a 
function.
Get a closer look with the Zoom command.    One of the first things that you’ll want to learn 
is how to manipulate your views. The Zoom command is a common tool in graphics programs.
Master It    Name at least two ways of zooming into a view.
Save a file as you work.    Nothing is more frustrating than having a power failure that causes 
you to lose hours of work. It’s a good idea to save your work frequently. AutoCAD offers an 
Automatic Save feature that can be a lifesaver if you happen to forget to save your files.
Master It    How often does the AutoCAD Automatic Save feature save your drawing?
Make changes and open multiple files.    As with other Windows programs, you can have 
multiple files open and exchange data between them.
Master It    With two drawings open, how can you copy parts of one drawing into the 
other?


Chapter  2
Creating Your First Drawing 
This chapter examines some of the basic functions of the AutoCAD® software. You’ll get a 
chance to practice with the drawing editor by building a simple drawing to use in later exer-
cises. You’ll learn how to give input to AutoCAD, interpret prompts and get help when you need 
it. This chapter also covers the use of coordinate systems to give AutoCAD exact measurements 
for objects. You’ll see how to select objects that you’ve drawn and how to specify base points for 
moving and copying.
If you’re not a beginning AutoCAD user, you may want to move on to the more complex material 
in Chapter 3, “Setting Up and Using the Drafting Tools.” You can use the files supplied at the book’s 
web page (www.sybex.com/go/masteringautocad2017) to continue the tutorials at that point.
Beginning in this chapter, we’ll be using a setup that displays a white drawing background 
instead of the dark gray background you see on your screen. We do this to keep the figures leg-
ible in the printed version of this book, but the difference should not hinder your understand-
ing of the figures. If you like, you can set up your screen with a white background by following 
the instructions in Appendix B, “Installing and Setting Up AutoCAD,” in the section “Set Up 
AutoCAD with a White Background.”
In this chapter, you will learn to

Getting to Know the Home Tab’s Draw  
and Modify Panels
Your first task in learning how to draw in AutoCAD software is simply to draw a line. Since 
AutoCAD is designed as a precision drawing tool, you’ll be introduced to methods that allow 
you to input exact distances. But before you begin drawing, take a moment to familiarize 

32  | CHAPTER 2  Creating Your First Drawing   
yourself with the features that you’ll be using more than any other to create objects with 
AutoCAD: the Draw and Modify panels. Try these steps:
	
1.	 Start AutoCAD just as you did in Chapter 1, “Exploring the Interface,” by choosing Start 
➢ All Programs ➢ Autodesk ➢ AutoCAD 2017 ➢ AutoCAD 2017.
	
2.	 Click the Templates drop-down arrowhead in the Dashboard and select acad.dwt (see 
Figure 2.1). Metric users should use the acadiso.dwt template. You could also click the 
Start Drawing icon, but we ask you to use the acad.dwt or acadiso.dwt template to 
ensure that you are set up with the same defaults as in this exercise.
Figure 2.1

Getting to Know the Home Tab’s Draw and Modify Panels  |  33  
Don’t Get Stuck on the Prompts
In many of the exercises in this book, we’ll mention the Command prompt that appears in the 
Command window. The prompts are shown for your reference, but don’t let yourself get too bogged 
down by them. For example, we’ll say, “At the Specify lower left corner or [ON/OFF] 
<0.0000,0.0000>: prompt, press ↵.” The important part is to “press ↵.” You can skim over the 
prompt. Just keep in mind that the prompts can offer some direction and show the options for the 
current command. They can also serve as helpful reminders later when you’re working on your own.
	
4.	 Move the arrow cursor to the Line tool in the Home tab’s Draw panel at the far 
upper-left portion of the AutoCAD window, and rest it there so that the tool tip 
appears. As you hold the cursor over the tool, first one tool tip appears and then 
another (see Figure 2.2).
Figure 2.2
The Draw panel
First tool tip
Second tool tip with a more 
detailed description of the tool
	
5.	 Slowly move the arrow cursor to the right over the other tools in the Home tab’s Draw 
panel, and read each tool tip.
In most cases, you’ll be able to guess what each tool does by looking at its icon. The icon with 
an arc, for instance, indicates that the tool draws arcs; the one with the ellipse signifies that the 
tool draws ellipses; and so on. If you hover over the tool, you’ll see the tool tip name and the 
keyboard command associated with the tool. Hold the cursor for a bit longer, and a cue card 
appears that gives a brief explanation of how to use the tool.
You see several tools in the Home tab’s Draw and Modify panels. In Chapter 1, you saw that 
if you click the arrow in a panel’s title bar, the panel expands to reveal more tools (see Figure 2.3). 
Once you’ve selected a tool from the expanded Draw or Modify panel, the expanded panel closes. 
If you want to keep the expanded panel open, click the pushpin icon at the left end of the expanded 
panel’s title bar.

34  | CHAPTER 2  Creating Your First Drawing   
Starting Your First Drawing
In Chapter 1, you looked at a preexisting sample drawing. This time, you’ll begin to draw your 
own drawing by creating a door that will be used in later exercises. First, though, you must 
learn how to tell AutoCAD what you want, and, even more important, you must understand 
what AutoCAD wants from you.
Figure 2.3
The Home tab’s Draw 
and Modify panel tools
Imperial and Metric
In this chapter, you’ll start to see instructions for both Imperial and metric measurements. In 
general, you’ll see the instructions for Imperial measurement first, followed by the metric instruc-
tions. You won’t be dealing with inches or centimeters yet, however. You’re just getting to know 
the AutoCAD system.
You’ll start by setting the size of the work area, known as the drawing limits. These limits 
aren’t fixed in any way, and you aren’t forced to stay within the bounds of the drawing limits 
unless the Limits command’s ON/OFF option is turned on. But limits can help to establish a 
starting area from which you can expand your drawing.
You currently have a new blank file, but it’s a little difficult to tell the size of your drawing area. 
Let’s set up the work area so that you have a better idea of the space with which you’re working:
	
1.	 Enter Limits↵.
	
2.	 At the Specify lower left corner or [ON/OFF] <0.0000,0.0000>: prompt, press ↵.
	
3.	 At the Specify upper right corner <12.0000,9.0000>: prompt, press ↵ to accept the 
default of 12.0000,9.0000. Metric users should enter 40,30↵.

Starting Your First Drawing |  35  
	
4.	 Type Z↵ A↵ for the Zoom All command. You can also select Zoom All from the Zoom 
flyout on the Navigation bar.
	
5.	 Metric users do the following: Open the Application menu and choose Drawing Utilities ➢ 
Units or enter Units↵. In the Units dialog box, select Centimeters from the Insertion Scale 
panel’s drop-down list and click OK. See “Inserted Drawings Not to Scale?” in Chapter 25, 
“Managing and Sharing Your Drawings,” for more on the Insertion Scale setting.
In step 4, the All option of the Zoom command uses the limits you set up in steps 2 and 3 
to determine the display area. In a drawing that contains objects, the Zoom tool’s All option 
displays the limits plus the area occupied by the objects in the drawing if they happen to fall 
outside the limits. Now give your file a unique name:
	
1.	 Choose Save As from the Application menu or type Saveas↵ to open the Save Drawing 
As dialog box.
	
2.	 Type Door. As you type, the name appears in the File Name text box.
	
3.	 Save your file in the My Documents folder or, if you prefer, save it in another folder of your 
choosing. Just remember where you put it because you’ll use it later.
	
4.	 Click Save. You now have a file called Door.dwg, located in the My Documents folder. Of 
course, your drawing doesn’t contain anything yet. You’ll take care of that next.

Understanding the Drawing Area
The new file shows a drawing area roughly 12 inches wide by 9 inches high. Metric users have a file 
that shows an area roughly 40 centimeters (cm) wide by 30 cm high. This is just the area you’re given 
to start with, but you’re not limited to it in any way. No visual clues indicate the size of the area. To 
check the area size for yourself, move the crosshair cursor to the upper-right corner of the draw-
ing area and observe the value in the coordinate readout in the lower-left corner. The coordinate 
readout won’t show exactly 12′9 inches, or 40′30 cm for metric, because the proportions of your 
drawing area aren’t likely to be exactly 12′9 or 40′30. AutoCAD does try to optimize the display 
for the drawing area when you choose the All option of the Zoom command.
Now you can start to explore the drawing process. To begin a drawing, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Line tool on the Home tab’s Draw panel, or type L↵.
You’ve just issued the Line command. AutoCAD responds in two ways. First, you see the 
message
Specify first point:
in the Command prompt, asking you to select a point to begin your line. Also, the cursor 
changes its appearance; it no longer has a square in the crosshairs. This is a clue telling 
you to pick a point to start a line.
	
2.	 Using the left mouse button, select a point on the screen just a little to the left and below 
the center of the drawing area (see Figure 2.4). After you select the point, AutoCAD 
changes the prompt to this:
Specify next point or [Undo]:

Now, as you move the mouse around, notice the line with one end fixed on the point you 
just selected and the other end following the cursor in a rubber-banding motion (see the 
first image in Figure 2.4). You also see a message asking you to Specify next point or.
	
3.	 Move the cursor to a location directly to the left or right of the point you clicked, and 
you’ll see a dashed horizontal line appear along with a different message at the cursor. 
This action also occurs when you point directly up or down. Your cursor seems to jump 
to a horizontal or vertical position.
This feature is called Polar Tracking. Like a T square or triangle, it helps restrict your line to 
an exact horizontal or vertical direction. You can turn Polar Tracking on or off by clicking 
the Polar Tracking tool in the status bar. You’ll learn more about this tool in Chapter 3.

Starting Your First Drawing |  37  
	
4.	 Continue with the Line command. Move the cursor to a point below and to the right of 
the first point you selected and click again. You’ve just drawn a line segment, and a sec-
ond rubber-banding line appears (see the second image in Figure 2.4).
	
5.	 If the line you drew isn’t the exact length you want, you can back up during the Line 
command and change it. To do this, type U↵. The line you drew previously rubber-bands 
as if you hadn’t selected the second point to fix its length.
	
6.	 Right-click and select Enter. This terminates the Line command.
The Undo and Redo tools in the Quick Access toolbar offer Undo and Redo drop-down 
lists from which you can select the exact command you want to undo or redo. See the sidebar 
“Getting Out of Trouble” later in this chapter for more information.
You’ve just drawn, and then undrawn, a line of an arbitrary length. In step 6 of the previous 
exercise, you were asked to terminate the Line command. If you happen to forget that a com-
mand is still active, two onscreen clues can remind you of the status of AutoCAD. If you don’t 
see the words Type a Command in the Command window, a command is still active. Also, the 
cursor is the plain crosshair without the box at its intersection.
Many tools will display a small icon or badge next to the cursor. The badge will be similar 
to the tool’s icon in most cases. A red X appears when hovering over an object while using the 
Erase tool. A question mark appears when using the Measure, ID, or List tool.
From now on, we’ll refer to the crosshair cursor without the small box as the Point Selection 
mode of the cursor. Figure 2.5 shows all the modes of the drawing cursor.

Specifying Exact Distances with Coordinates
Next, you’ll continue with the Line command to draw a plan view (an overhead view) of a door, 
to no particular scale. This will give you some practice in drawing objects to exact distances. 
Later, you’ll resize the drawing for use in future exercises. The door will be 3 units long and 
0.15 units thick. For metric users, the door will be 9 units long and 0.5 units thick. To specify 
these exact distances in AutoCAD, you can use either relative polar coordinates or Cartesian 
coordinates.

Why Use the Keyboard Commands?
For many years, Autodesk has been encouraging users to move away from the command line and 
keyboard method of command entry, but it seems that AutoCAD users will have none of that. 
Although you would expect “grizzled veteran” users to stick with the keyboard entry method, you 
might be surprised to find that young, “fresh out of school” apprentice architects also prefer the 
keyboard over the newer palettes and ribbons in AutoCAD.
We made this observation to one of the designers of AutoCAD at a recent Autodesk function. 
Without hesitation, he answered that “keyboard entry is much faster.” In our experience, it isn’t 
just faster. Entering commands via the keyboard gives you a more “connected” feeling with 
AutoCAD. Work seems to flow much smoother. If you learn the keyboard commands, you’ll also 
find that customizing AutoCAD is much easier. So for these reasons, we encourage you to try both  
the keyboard and the buttons to see which you prefer. You’ll find that, wherever possible, we’ll  
give the keyboard command equivalent to a tool selection in the exercises of this book. Remember 
that a tool’s tool tip will also show its keyboard command.
Getting Out of Trouble
Beginners and experts alike are bound to make a few mistakes. Before you get too far into the 
exercise, here are some powerful but easy-to-use tools to help you recover from accidents:
Backspace    If you make a typing error, press the Backspace key to back up to your error and 
then retype your command or response. The Backspace key is in the upper-right corner of 
the main keyboard area.
Escape (Esc)    This is perhaps the single most important key on your keyboard. When you 
need to exit a command or a dialog box quickly without making changes, press the Esc key 
in the upper-left corner of your keyboard. In most cases, you need to press Esc only once, 
although it won’t hurt to press it twice. (Press Esc before editing with grips or issuing com-
mands through the keyboard.)
U    If you accidentally change something in the drawing and want to reverse that change, 
click the Undo tool in the Quick Access toolbar (the left-pointing curved arrow). You can 
also type U↵ at the Command prompt. Each time you do this, AutoCAD undoes one opera-
tion at a time, in reverse order. The last command performed is undone first, then the 
next-to-last command, and so on. The prompt displays the name of the command being 
undone, and the drawing reverts to its state prior to that command being issued. If you 

Specifying Exact Distances with Coordinates |  39  
need to, you can undo everything back to the beginning of an editing session. You can also 
select the exact command to back up to by using the Undo drop-down list in the Quick 
Access toolbar.
You can open the Undo drop-down list by clicking the down-pointing arrow found to the 
right of the Undo tool.
Undo    If you want more control over the way Undo works, you can use the Undo command. 
This command allows you to “bookmark” places to which you can “undo” in your editing 
session. Type Undo↵, and you’ll see the Enter the number of operations to undo 
or [Auto/Control/BEgin/End/Mark/Back] <1>: prompt. Enter a number indicat-
ing the number of steps you want to undo. Use the Mark option to bookmark a location; 
then use Back to undo your work to that bookmark. You can use Begin and End to mark the 
beginning and ending of a set of operations that will be undone all at once. Control offers 
options to control the behavior of the Undo command. Auto is an option that is on by default 
and causes AutoCAD to undo the action of the whole command rather than the individual 
actions within a command.
Redo    If you accidentally undo one too many commands, you can redo the last undone 
command by clicking the Redo tool (the right-pointing curved arrow) in the Quick Access 
toolbar, or you can type Redo↵. You can redo several operations that you may have undone 
with the Undo command. You can also select the exact command to redo by using the Redo 
drop-down list in the Quick Access toolbar.
Oops    If you’ve deleted something and gone on to use other commands, you can restore the 
last deleted object or objects by using the Oops command. Oops enables you to restore the last 
deleted set of objects without having to undo a series of commands.
The Imperial and metric distances aren’t equivalent in the exercises in this chapter. For 
example, 3 units in the Imperial-based drawing aren’t equal to 9 metric units. These distances 
are arbitrary and based on how they appear in the figures in this chapter.

40  | CHAPTER 2  Creating Your First Drawing   
Specifying Polar Coordinates
To enter the exact distance of 3 (or 9 metric) units to the right of the last point you selected, do 
the following:
	
1.	 Click the Line tool on the Home tab’s Draw panel, or type L↵.
	
2.	 Click a point slightly to the left of the center of the drawing area to select the start point.
	
3.	 Type @3<0. Metric users should type @9<0. As you type, the letters appear at the 
Command prompt.
	
4.	 Press ↵. A line appears, starting from the first point you picked and ending 3 units to the 
right of it (see Figure 2.6). You’ve just entered a relative polar coordinate.

Notice that the rubber-
banding line now 
starts from the last

indicates that you can

line segments.
Line segment, 3 units in length 
or 9 units for metric users
Rubber-banding line
The “at” sign (@) you entered tells AutoCAD that the coordinate you’re specifying is from 
the last point you selected. The 3 (or 9, metric) is the distance, and the less-than symbol (<) tells 
AutoCAD that you’re designating the angle at which the line is to be drawn. The last part is the 
value for the angle, which in this case is 0 for 0°. This is how to use polar coordinates to commu-
nicate distances and directions to AutoCAD.
If you’re accustomed to a different method for describing directions, you can set AutoCAD to 
use a vertical direction as 0°. See Chapter 3 for details.
Angles are given based on the system shown in Figure 2.7, in which 0° is a horizontal direc-
tion from left to right, 90° is straight up, 180° is horizontal from right to left, and so on. You can 
specify degrees, minutes, and seconds of arc if you want to be that exact. You can also specify 
angles using negative values, which would mirror the direction around the x-axis. For example, 
a minus 45° angle would point in the direction shown as 315° in Figure 2.7. We’ll discuss angle 
formats in more detail in Chapter 3.

Specifying Exact Distances with Coordinates |  41  
Specifying Relative Cartesian Coordinates
For the next line segment, let’s try another method for specifying exact distances:
	
1.	 Enter @0,0.15↵. Metric users should enter @0,0.5↵. A short line appears above the end-
point of the last line. Once again, @ tells AutoCAD that the coordinate you specify is from 
the last point picked. But in this example, you give the distance in X and Y values. The X 
distance, 0, is given first, followed by a comma, and then the Y distance, 0.15 or 0.5. This is 
how to specify distances in relative Cartesian coordinates.
Certiﬁcation
Objective
Figure 2.7

system for specifying 
angles
Commas and Periods
Step 1 indicates that metric users should enter @0,0.5↵ for the distance. Instead, you could enter 
@0,.5 (zero comma point five). The leading zero is included for clarity. European metric users 
should be aware that the comma is used as a separator between the X and Y components of the 
coordinate. In AutoCAD, commas aren’t used for decimal points; you must use a period to denote 
a decimal point.
	
2.	 Enter @-3,0↵. Metric users should enter @-9,0↵. This distance is also in X,Y values, but 
here you use a negative value to specify the X distance. The result is a drawing that looks 
like Figure 2.8.
Positive values in the Cartesian coordinate system are from left to right and from bottom 
to top (see Figure 2.9). (You may remember this from your high school geometry class!) If 
you want to draw a line from right to left, you must designate a negative value. It’s also 
helpful to know where the origin of the drawing lies. In a new drawing, the origin—or 
coordinate 0,0—is in the lower-left corner of the drawing.

3.	 Type C↵. This C stands for the Close option. You can also click the Close option in the 
command line or right-click and select Close from the context menu. A line connecting 
the first and last points of a sequence of lines is drawn (see Figure 2.10), and the Line com-
mand terminates. The rubber-banding line also disappears, telling you that AutoCAD 
has finished drawing line segments. You can also use the rubber-banding line to indicate 
direction while simultaneously entering the distance through the keyboard. See the side-
bar “Other Ways to Enter Distances” later in this chapter.

Interpreting the Cursor Modes and Understanding 
Prompts
The key to working with AutoCAD successfully is understanding the way it interacts with  
you. The following sections will help you become familiar with some of the ways AutoCAD 
prompts you for input. Understanding the format of the messages in the Command window 
and recognizing other events on the screen will help you learn the program more easily.
Understanding Cursor Modes
As the Command window aids you with messages, the cursor gives you clues about what to do. 
Figure 2.5 earlier illustrates the various modes of the cursor, and it gives a brief description of 
the role of each mode. Take a moment to study this figure.
Standard Cursor    The Standard cursor tells you that AutoCAD is waiting for instructions. 
You can also edit objects by using grips when you see this cursor. Grips are squares, rect-
angles, or arrowheads that appear at endpoints and at the midpoint of objects when they’re 
selected. (You might know them as workpoints from other graphics programs.)
Point Selection Cursor    The Point Selection cursor appears whenever AutoCAD expects 
point input. It can also appear in conjunction with a rubber-banding line. You can either click 
a point or enter a coordinate through the keyboard.
Cursor with Badge    The Cursor with Badge lets you know at a glance which tool you 
are using. The badge will be similar to the tool icon currently being used. A red X badge 
appears when you hover over an object while using the Erase tool. A question mark  
badge appears when you use the Measure, ID, or List tool.
Object Selection or Pickbox Cursor    The Object Selection or Pickbox cursor tells you that 
you must select objects—either by clicking them or by using any of the object-selection 
options available.
Osnap (Object Snap) Marker    The osnap (object snap) marker appears along with the Point 
Selection cursor when you invoke an osnap. Osnaps let you accurately select specific points 
on an object, such as endpoints or midpoints.
Tracking Vector    The tracking vector appears when you use the Polar Tracking or Object 
Snap Tracking feature. Polar Tracking aids you in drawing orthogonal lines, and Object Snap

44  | CHAPTER 2  Creating Your First Drawing   
Tracking helps you align a point in space relative to the geometry of existing objects. Object 
Snap Tracking works in conjunction with osnaps. You’ll learn more about the tracking vector 
in Chapter 3.
If you’re an experienced AutoCAD user, you may prefer to use the old-style crosshair cursor 
that crosses the entire screen. Choose Options from the bottom of the Application menu to open 
the Options dialog box, and then click the Display tab. Set the Crosshair Size option near the 
bottom right of the dialog box to 100. The cursor then appears as it did in previous versions of 
AutoCAD. As the option name implies, you can set the crosshair size to any percentage of the 
screen you want. The default is 5 percent.
Certiﬁcation
Objective
Other Ways to Enter Distances
A third method for entering distances is to point in a direction with a rubber-banding line and 
then enter the distance through the keyboard. For example, to draw a line 3 units long from left 
to right, click the Line tool on the Home tab’s Draw panel, click a start point, and then move  
the cursor so that the rubber-banding line points to the right at some arbitrary distance. With the 
cursor pointing in the direction you want, type 3↵. The rubber-banding line becomes a fixed line 
3 units long. Using this method, called the Direct Distance method, along with the Ortho mode or 
Polar Tracking described in Chapter 3, can be a fast way to draw orthogonal lines of specific lengths.
You can also specify an exact angle along with the distance. For example, start the Line command 
and then pick the first point. Type 3 for the length but don’t press ↵. Press the Tab key instead. 
The line segment will become fixed at 3 units, and as you move the cursor, the segment will rotate 
freely around the first point. Next, type an angle in degrees, 30↵ for example, and the line will 
be drawn at 30 degrees. Or, instead of typing in an angle, just adjust the angle of the line visually 
until you see the angle you want on the Dynamic Input temporary angle dimension and then click.
Start a line, then type 3 and press the Tab key.
The 3 appears in the temporary dimension, 
and as you move the cursor, the line
rotates about the ﬁrst point.
Type an angle value.
As you do, the value
appears in the 
temporary angle 
dimension. Press
to ﬁnish the line.
If you watch the temporary dimensions as you press the Tab key, you’ll see that the Tab key lets you 
move from the length dimension to the angle dimension and back again. You can press the Tab key 
at any time to shift back and forth between dimensions. A lock appears next to a dimension that 
you have entered, telling you that the dimension is “locked” until you tab to it again.
You’ll learn more about how to enter values with the Dynamic Input’s temporary dimensions later 
in this chapter.

Choosing Command Options
Many commands in AutoCAD offer several options, which are often presented to you in the 
Command window in the form of a prompt. This section uses the Arc command to illustrate the 
format of AutoCAD prompts.
Usually, in a floor plan drawing in the United States, an arc is drawn to indicate the direction 
of a door swing. Figure 2.11 shows other standard symbols used in architectural-style drawings.

Next, you’ll draw the arc for the door you started in the previous exercise:
	
1.	 Click the 3-Point Arc tool in the Home tab’s Draw panel. Click the Arc flyout and select 
3-Point. The Specify start point of arc or [Center]: prompt appears in the 
Command window, and the cursor changes to Point Selection mode. You also see the 
prompt Specify start point of arc or prompt next to the cursor.
Examine the Specify start point of arc or [Center]: prompt. The prompt con-
tains two options. The default is stated in the main part of the prompt, which is to specify 
the start point of the arc. If other options are available, they appear within square brack-
ets. In the Arc command, you see the word Center within brackets telling you that, if 

46  | CHAPTER 2  Creating Your First Drawing   
you prefer, you can also start your arc by selecting a center point instead of a start point. 
If multiple options are available, they appear within the brackets and are set off with a 
slightly darker background. This background tells you that the option is selectable using 
your cursor and also aids in separating option names. The default is the option AutoCAD 
assumes you intend to use unless you tell it otherwise.
	
2.	 Type C↵ to select the Center option or click the word Center in the command line. The 
Specify center point of arc: prompt appears. Notice that you had to type only the C 
and not the entire word Center.
When you see a set of options in the Command window, note their capitalization. 
If you choose to respond to prompts by using the keyboard, these capitalized let-
ters are all you need to enter to select the option. In some cases, the first two letters 
are capitalized to differentiate two options that begin with the same letter, such as 
LAyer and LType. You can also just click the option name in the Command prompt 
to select the option.
	
3.	 Pick a point representing the center of the arc near the upper-left corner of the door (see 
Figure 2.12). The Specify start point of arc: prompt appears.
	
4.	 Type @3<0↵. Metric users should type @9<0↵. The Specify end point of arc (hold 
Ctrl to switch direction) or [Angle chord Length]: prompt appears.
	
5.	 Move the mouse and a temporary arc appears, originating from a point 3 units to 
the right of the center point you selected and rotating about that center, as shown in 
Figure 2.12. (Metric users will see the temporary arc originating 9 units to the right of the 
center point.)
As the prompt indicates, you now have three options. You can enter an angle, a chord 
length, or the endpoint of the arc. The prompt default, to specify the endpoint of the 
arc, picks the arc’s endpoint. Again, the cursor is in Point Selection mode, telling you it’s 
waiting for point input. To select this default option, you only need to pick a point on the 
screen indicating where you want the endpoint.
	
6.	 Move the cursor so that it points in a vertical direction from the center of the arc. You’ll 
see the Polar Tracking vector snap to a vertical position.
	
7.	 Click any location with the Polar Tracking vector in the vertical position. The arc is now 
fixed in place, as shown in Figure 2.12.

This exercise has given you some practice working with AutoCAD Command window 
prompts and entering keyboard commands—skills you’ll need when you start to use advanced 
AutoCAD functions.
As you can see, AutoCAD has a distinct structure in its prompt messages. You first issue a 
command, which in turn offers options in the form of a prompt. Depending on the option you 

48  | CHAPTER 2  Creating Your First Drawing   
select, you get another set of options or you’re prompted to take some action, such as picking a 
point, selecting objects, or entering a value.
As you work through the exercises, you’ll become intimately familiar with this routine. After 
you understand the workings of the Ribbon panels, the Command window prompts, and the 
dialog boxes, you can almost teach yourself the rest of the program!
Using AutoComplete and AutoCorrect
You may have noticed that as you enter a command through the keyboard, the Command window 
offers suggestions to complete your typing in a way similar to many web browsers. For example, if 
you type LI, a list pops up offering a number of commands that start with LI. You can then click the 
option that you want to use. This feature can be helpful when you forget the full name of a command.
AutoCorrect works in a similar way, but instead of offering a list of commands that start with the 
letters you type, AutoCAD will try to “correct” a mistyped command. For example, if you type crl, 
AutoCAD will display several commands that come close to what you typed.
You can also control how the AutoComplete and AutoCorrect features work. Right-click in the 
Command window, and then point to the Input Settings option that appears in the context menu. 
You can then toggle several options on or off. The options are AutoComplete, AutoCorrect, Search 
System Variables, Search Content, Mid-string Search, and Delay Time.
Selecting Options from a Context Menu
Now you know that you can select command options by typing them. You can also right-click 
at any time during a command to open a context menu containing those same options. For 
example, in step 2 in the previous exercise, you typed C↵ to tell AutoCAD that you wanted to 
select the center of the arc. Instead of typing, you can also right-click to open a menu of options 
applicable to the Arc command at that time.
In addition to the options shown in the Command prompt, the context menu shows you a 
few more: Enter, Cancel, Pan, and Zoom. The Enter option is the same as pressing ↵. Cancel can-
cels the current command. Pan and Zoom let you adjust your view as you’re working through 
the current command.
The menu is context sensitive, so you see only those options that pertain to the command or 
activity that is currently in progress. Also, when AutoCAD is expecting a point, an object selec-
tion, or a numeric value, right-clicking doesn’t display a context menu. Instead, AutoCAD treats 
a right-click as ↵.
The location of your cursor when you right-click determines the contents of the list of avail-
able operations. A right-click in the Command window displays a list of operations that you can 
apply to the command line, such as repeating one of the last several commands you’ve used or 
copying the most recent history of command activity to the Clipboard.
A right-click in the drawing area when no command is active displays a set of basic options 
for editing your file, such as the command most recently used, Undo, Redo, Pan, and Zoom, 
to name a few (see Figure 2.13). The Cut, Copy, and Paste commands can be found under the 
Clipboard option.

If you’re ever in doubt about what to do in AutoCAD, you can right-click to see a list of 
options. You’ll learn more about these options later in this book. For now, let’s move on to the 
topic of selecting objects.
How We’ll Show Command Options
As mentioned earlier, the options in the command line are shown with a slightly darker back-
ground color so that you can easily determine the name of the options (see Figure 2.14).
Figure 2.13
A set of basic 
options
Figure 2.14
The Angle and chord 
Length options are 
separated by a gray 
background.
Unfortunately, it’s a bit more difficult to show the options in the same way in this book. Thus 
from now on when we show the command options, we’ll use a forward slash mark to separate 
the options. For example, in the Arc command options discussed earlier, you saw this command 
prompt:
Specify end point of arc or [Angle chord Length]
We’ll show it like this, using the / symbol to separate the command options:
Specify end point of arc or [Angle/chord Length]
Without the / symbol, you might confuse the option names as Angle chord and Length, 
or you may even think that there are three options named Angle, chord, and Length. Those of 
you familiar with older versions of AutoCAD will recognize this use of the / symbol as the way 
AutoCAD used to separate command options in the command line.

50  | CHAPTER 2  Creating Your First Drawing   
Selecting Objects
In AutoCAD, you can select objects in many ways. The following sections cover two ways: 
object-selection methods unique to AutoCAD and the Noun/Verb method, the more common 
selection method used in most popular graphics programs. Because these two methods play a 
major role in working with AutoCAD, it’s a good idea to familiarize yourself with them early on.
If you need to select objects by their characteristics rather than by their location, see 
Chapter 14, “Advanced Editing and Organizing,” which describes the Quick Select and Object 
Selection Filters tools. These tools let you easily select a set of objects based on their properties, 
including object type, color, layer assignment, and so on.
Selecting Objects in AutoCAD
With many AutoCAD commands, you’ll see the Select objects: prompt. Along with 
this prompt, the cursor changes from crosshairs to the Object Selection cursor (look back at 
Figure 2.5). Whenever you see the Select objects: prompt and the square Pickbox cursor, you 
have several options while making your selection. Often, as you select objects on the screen, 
you’ll change your mind about a selection or accidentally select an object that you don’t want. 
Let’s look at most of the selection options available in AutoCAD and learn what to do when you 
make the wrong selection.
Before you continue, you’ll turn off two features that, although extremely useful, can be con-
fusing to new users. These features are called Running Osnaps and Osnap Tracking. You’ll get 
a chance to explore these features in depth later in this book, but for now follow these steps to 
turn them off:
	
1.	 Check to see if either Object Snap or Object Snap Tracking is turned on in the status bar. 
If they’re turned on, they will be a light blue.
Object Snap Tracking
Object Snap
	
2.	 To turn off Object Snap, click the tool in the status bar. When turned off, it will change to 
gray.
Now, let’s see how to select an object in AutoCAD:
	
1.	 Choose Move from the Home tab’s Modify panel, or type M↵.
	
2.	 At the Select objects: prompt, click each of the two horizontal lines that constitute 
the door. As you know, whenever AutoCAD wants you to select objects, the cursor turns 
into the small square pickbox. This tells you that you’re in Object Selection mode. As you 
place the cursor over an object, it appears thicker to give you a better idea of what you’re 
about to select. As you click an object, it’s highlighted, as shown in Figure 2.15.
If objects don’t become “thicker” as you roll over them with your selection cursor, the 
Selection preview system variable may be turned off. You can turn it back on by entering

selectionpreview↵ 3↵ . This setting can also be found in the Selection tab of the Options 
dialog box. See Appendix B for more on the Options dialog box, and see Bonus Chapter 4, 
“System Variables and Dimension Styles,” for more on system variables, available at  
www.omura.com/chapters.
Figure 2.15
Select the lines of the 
door, and they become 
highlighted.
	
3.	 After making your selections, you may decide to deselect some items. Enter U↵ from the 
keyboard. Notice that one line is no longer highlighted. When you type U↵, objects are 
deselected, one at a time, in reverse order of selection.
	
4.	 You can deselect objects in another way. Hold down the Shift key and click the remain-
ing highlighted line. It reverts to a solid line, showing you that it’s no longer selected for 
editing.
	
5.	 By now, you’ve deselected both lines. Let’s try another method for selecting groups of 
objects. To select objects with a window selection, type W↵. The cursor changes to a Point 
Selection cursor, and the prompt changes to
Specify first corner:
	
6.	 Click a point below and to the left of the rectangle representing the door. As you move 
your cursor across the screen, a selection window appears and stretches across the draw-
ing area. Also notice that the window has a blue tint.
	
7.	 After the selection window completely encloses the door but not the arc, click this loca-
tion to highlight the entire door. This window selects only objects that are completely 
enclosed by the window, as shown in Figure 2.16.
Don’t confuse the selection window you’re creating here with the zoom window you 
used in Chapter 1, which defines an area of the drawing you want to enlarge. Remember 
Certiﬁcation
Objective

52  | CHAPTER 2  Creating Your First Drawing   
that the Window option works differently under the Zoom command than it does for 
other editing commands.

8.	 Press ↵. This tells AutoCAD that you’ve finished selecting objects. It’s important to 
remember to press ↵ as soon as you finish selecting the objects you want to edit. A new 
prompt, Specify base point or [Displacement] <Displacement>:, appears. The 
cursor changes to its Point Selection mode.
Now you’ve seen how the selection process works in AutoCAD—but you’re in the middle of 
the Move command. The next section discusses the prompt that’s on your screen and describes 
how to enter base points and displacement distances.
Controlling the Status Bar Display
Toward the right side of the status bar, you’ll see a tool icon with three horizontal lines. This tool 
opens a menu that controls the display of the status bar. You use this menu to turn the items in the 
status bar on or off. A check mark by an item indicates that it’s currently on. If for some reason you 
don’t see all of the buttons mentioned in the following exercise, check this menu to make sure all 
the status bar options are turned on. For the items in the left half of the status bar, choose Status 
Toggles from the menu.

Selecting Objects |  53  
Providing Base Points
When you move or copy objects, AutoCAD prompts you for a base point, which is a difficult 
concept to grasp. AutoCAD must be told specifically from where and to where the move occurs. 
The base point is the exact location from which you determine the distance and direction of the 
move. After the base point is determined, you can tell AutoCAD where to move the object in 
relation to that point.
Follow these steps to practice using base points:
	
1.	 To select a base point, press Shift+right-click. A menu appears, displaying the Object 
Snap options (see Figure 2.17).
Figure 2.17
The Object Snap 
options
When you right-click, make sure that the cursor is within the AutoCAD drawing area; 
otherwise, you won’t get the results described in this book.
	
2.	 Choose Intersection from the Object Snap menu. The Object Snap menu closes.
	
3.	 Move the cursor to the lower-right corner of the door. Notice that as you approach the 
corner, a small x-shaped graphic appears on the corner. This is called an osnap marker.
	
4.	 After the x-shaped marker appears, hold the mouse motionless for a second or two. A tool 
tip appears, telling you the current osnap point that AutoCAD has selected.
	
5.	 Click the left mouse button to select the intersection indicated by the osnap marker. 
Whenever you see the osnap marker at the point you want to select, you don’t have to 
point exactly at the location with your cursor. Just left-click to select the exact osnap point 
(see Figure 2.18). In this case, you selected the exact intersection of two lines.

54  | CHAPTER 2  Creating Your First Drawing   
	
6.	 At the Specify second point or <use first point as displacement>: prompt, 
hold down the Shift key and right-click again to open the Object Snap menu.
Figure 2.18

Selection cursor and

7.	 This time, you’ll use the Endpoint osnap, but instead of clicking the option with the 
mouse, type E.
	
8.	 Pick the lower-right end of the arc you drew earlier. (Remember that you need to move 
your cursor close to the endpoint just until the osnap marker appears.) The door moves so 
that the corner connects exactly with the endpoint of the arc (see Figure 2.19).

Selecting Objects |  55  
As you can see, the osnap options let you select specific points on an object. You used 
Endpoint and Intersection in this exercise, but other options are available. Chapter 3 discusses 
some of the other osnap options. You may have also noticed that the osnap marker is different 
for each of the options you used. You’ll learn more about osnaps in Chapter 3. Now let’s con-
tinue with our look at point selection.
You may have noticed the statement Use first point as displacement in the prompt in 
step 6 of the preceding exercise. This means that if you press ↵ instead of clicking a point, the 
object will move a distance based on the coordinates of the point you selected as a base point. 
If, for example, the point you click for the base point is at coordinate 2,4, the object will move 2 
units in the x-axis and 4 units in the y-axis.
If you want to specify an exact distance and direction by typing a value, select any point 
on the screen as a base point. As an alternative, you can type @ followed by ↵ at the base point 
prompt; then, enter the second point’s location in relative coordinates. Remember that @ means 
the last point selected. In the next exercise, you’ll try moving the entire door an exact distance of 
1 unit at a 45° angle. Metric users will move the door 3 units at a 45° angle. Here are the steps:
	
1.	 Click the Move tool on the Home tab’s Modify panel.
	
2.	 Type P↵. The set of objects you selected in the previous exercise is highlighted. P is a 
selection option that selects the previously selected set of objects.
	
3.	 You’re still in Object Selection mode, so click the arc to include it in the set of selected 
objects. The entire door, including the arc, is highlighted.
	
4.	 Press ↵ to tell AutoCAD that you’ve finished your selection. The cursor changes to Point 
Selection mode.
	
5.	 At the Specify base point or [Displacement] <Displacement>: prompt, choose a 
point on the screen between the door and the left side of the screen (see Figure 2.20).
Figure 2.20
The highlighted door 
and the base point just 
to the left of the door. 
Note that the base 
point doesn’t need to 
be on the object that 
you’re moving.
Base point

56  | CHAPTER 2  Creating Your First Drawing   
	
6.	 Move the cursor around slowly and notice that the door moves as if the base point you 
selected were attached to it. The door moves with the cursor, at a fixed distance from it. 
This demonstrates how the base point relates to the objects you select.
	
7.	 Type @1<-45↵. (Metric users should type @3<-45↵.) The door moves to a new location on 
the screen at a distance of 1 unit (3 for metric users) from its previous location and at an 
angle of minus 45°, which is a direction that is downward at a 45-degree angle.
If AutoCAD is waiting for a command, you can repeat the last command used by pressing 
the spacebar or pressing ↵. You can also right-click in the drawing area and select the option 
at the top of the list. If you right-click the Command window, a context menu offers the most 
recent commands.
This exercise illustrates that the base point doesn’t have to be on the object you’re 
manipulating; it can be virtually anywhere on your drawing. You also saw how to reselect 
a group of objects that were selected previously without having to duplicate the selection 
process.
Using Noun/Verb Selection
Nearly all graphics programs today allow the Noun/Verb method for selecting objects. This 
method requires you to select objects before you issue a command to edit them—that is, you 
identify the “noun” (the object that you want to work on) before the “verb” (the action that you 
want to perform on it). The following exercises show you how to use the Noun/Verb method in 
AutoCAD.
You’ve seen that when AutoCAD is waiting for a command, it displays the crosshair cursor 
with the small square. As mentioned, this square is a pickbox superimposed on the cursor. It 
indicates that you can select objects even while the Command prompt appears at the bottom 
of the screen and no command is currently active. The square momentarily disappears when 
you’re in a command that asks you to select points.
Other Selection Options
There are several other selection options that you haven’t tried yet. You’ll see how these options 
work in exercises later in this book. Or, if you’re adventurous, try them now on your own. To use 
these options, type their keyboard abbreviations (shown in brackets in the following list) at any 
Select objects: prompt:
Add [A↵]    Switches from Remove mode to the Add mode. See the description for Remove 
later in this sidebar.
All [ALL↵]    Selects all of the objects in a drawing except those in frozen or locked layers. 
(See Chapter 5, “Keeping Track of Layers and Blocks,” for information on layers.)
Box [B↵]    Forces the standard selection window so that a left-to-right selection uses a stan-
dard window and a right-to-left selection uses a crossing window.
Crossing [C↵]    Similar to the Window selection option (described later in this sidebar) but 
selects anything that is entirely within or crosses through the window that you define.

Selecting Objects |  57  
Crossing Polygon [CP↵]    Acts exactly like Window Polygon (described later in this sidebar), but 
like the Crossing selection option, selects anything that crosses through a polygon boundary.
Fence [F↵]    Selects objects that are crossed by a temporary line called a fence. This operation is 
like using a line to cross out the objects you want to select. After you invoke this option, you can 
then pick points, as when you’re drawing a series of line segments. After you finish drawing the 
fence, press ↵, and then go on to select other objects or press ↵ again to finish your selection.
Use a Fence selection
to extend a set of
lines to a spline.
Fence
Result
Group [G↵]    Allows you to select a group by name.
Last [L↵]    Selects the last object you created.
Multiple [M↵]    Lets you select several objects first before AutoCAD highlights them. In a 
large file, selecting objects individually can cause AutoCAD to pause after each selection while it 
locates and highlights each object. The Multiple option can speed things up: First you select all of 
the objects quickly and then you highlight them all by pressing ↵. This has no menu equivalent.
Previous [P↵]    Selects the last object or set of objects that was edited or changed.
Remove [R↵]    Switches to a selection mode whereby the objects you click are removed from 
the selection set.
Subobject [SU↵]    Allows selection of faces, edges, and vertices of 3D solid objects. This can 
also be accomplished by pressing the Ctrl key while picking.
Object [O↵]    Ends selecting by Subobject and restores normal behavior.
Undo [U↵]    Removes the most recently added object from the selection set.
Window [W↵]    Forces a standard window selection. This option is useful when your draw-
ing area is too crowded to use the Autoselect feature to place a window around a set of 
objects. (See the Auto entry later in this sidebar.) It prevents you from accidentally selecting 
an object with a single pick when you’re placing your window.
Window Polygon [WP↵]    Lets you select objects by enclosing them in an irregularly shaped 
polygon boundary. When you use this option, you see the First polygon point: prompt. 
You then pick points to define the polygon boundary. As you pick points, the Specify 
endpoint of line or [Undo]: prompt appears. Select as many points as you need to define 
continues

58  | CHAPTER 2  Creating Your First Drawing   
continued
the boundary. You can undo boundary line segments as you go by pressing U↵. With the bound-
ary defined, press ↵. The bounded objects are highlighted and the Select objects: prompt 
returns, allowing you to use more selection options.
A window polygon selection
The following two selection options are also available but are seldom used. They’re intended 
for use in creating custom menu options or custom tools:
Auto [AU↵]    Forces the standard automatic window or crossing window when a point is 
picked and no object is found. (See the section “Using Autoselect” later in this chapter.) 
You produce a standard window when you pick the two window corners from left to right, 
and you produce a crossing window when you pick the two corners from right to left. After 
you select this option, it remains active for the duration of the current command. Auto is 
intended for use on systems on which the Autoselect feature has been turned off.
Single [SI↵]    Forces the current command to select only a single object. If you use this 
option, you can pick a single object and the current command acts on that object as if you 
had pressed ↵ immediately after selecting it. This has no menu equivalent.
In addition to Noun/Verb selection, AutoCAD offers selection options that let you use famil-
iar GUI techniques. See Appendix B to learn how you can control object-selection methods. This 
appendix also describes how to change the size of the Standard cursor.
Try moving objects by first selecting them and then using the Move command:
	
1.	 Press the Esc key twice to make sure that AutoCAD isn’t in the middle of a command, 
which you might have accidentally issued. Then click the arc. The arc is highlighted, 
and you may also see squares appear at various points on the arc. As stated earlier, these 
squares are called grips. You’ll get a chance to work with them later.
	
2.	 Choose Move from the Home tab’s Modify panel. The cursor changes to Point Selection 
mode. Notice that the grips on the arc disappear but the arc is still selected.
	
3.	 At the Specify base point or [Displacement] <Displacement>: prompt, pick any 
point on the screen. The following prompt appears:
Specify second point or
<use first point as displacement>:
	
4.	 Type @1<0↵. Metric users should type @3<0↵. The arc moves to a new location 1 unit (3 
units for metric users) to the right.

Selecting Objects |  59  
If this exercise doesn’t work as described here, chances are that the Noun/Verb setting has 
been turned off on your copy of AutoCAD. To turn on the Noun/Verb setting, choose Options 
from the Application menu to open the Options dialog box and then click the Selection tab. In 
the Selection Modes group, select the check box next to the Noun/Verb Selection option and 
click OK.
In this exercise, you picked the arc before issuing the Move command. Then, when you 
clicked the Move tool, you didn’t see the Select objects: prompt. Instead, AutoCAD assumed 
that you wanted to move the arc that you selected and went directly to the Specify base point 
or [Displacement] <Displacement>: prompt.
Using Autoselect
Next, you’ll move the rest of the door in the same direction by using the Autoselect feature:
	
1.	 Pick a point just above and to the left of the rectangle representing the door. Be sure not 
to pick the door itself. A selection window appears that you can drag across the screen 
as you move the cursor. If you move the cursor to the left of the last point selected, the 
window outline appears dotted and there’s a green tint inside the window (see the first 
image in Figure 2.21). If you move the cursor to the right of that point, the outline appears 
solid and there’s a blue tint inside (see the second image in Figure 2.21).
Figure 2.21

(first image) indicates 
a crossing selection; 
the solid window (sec-
ond image) indicates 
a standard selection 
window.
Crossing window
Standard window

60  | CHAPTER 2  Creating Your First Drawing   
	
2.	 Pick a point below and to the right of the door so that the door, but not the arc, is com-
pletely enclosed by the window, as shown in the bottom image in Figure 2.21. The 
door is highlighted (and, again, you may see grips appear at the lines’ endpoints and 
midpoints).
	
3.	 Click the Move tool again. Just as in the preceding exercise, the Specify base point or 
[Displacement] <Displacement>: prompt appears.
	
4.	 Pick any point on the screen; then enter @1<0↵. Metric users should enter @3<0↵. The 
door joins with the arc.
The two selection windows you’ve just seen—the blue solid one and the dotted green one—
represent a standard window and a crossing window. If you use a standard window, anything 
completely within the window is selected. If you use a crossing window, anything that crosses 
through the window is selected. These two types of windows start automatically when you click 
any blank portion of the drawing area with a Standard cursor or a Point Selection cursor, hence 
the name Autoselect.
Next, you’ll select objects with an automatic crossing window:
	
1.	 Pick a point below and to the right of the door. As you move the cursor left, the crossing 
(dotted) window appears.
	
2.	 Select the next point so that the window encloses the door and part of the arc (see 
Figure 2.22). The entire door, including the arc, is highlighted.
Figure 2.22
The door enclosed by 
a crossing window
	
3.	 Click the Move tool.
	
4.	 Pick any point on the screen; then enter @1<180↵. Metric users should type @3<180↵. The 
door moves back to its original location.
You’ll find that, in most cases, the Autoselect standard and crossing windows are all that you 
need when selecting objects. They really save you time, so you’ll want to become familiar with 
these features.

Editing with Grips |  61  
Before continuing, click the Save tool in the Quick Access toolbar to save the Door.dwg file. 
You won’t want to save the changes you make in the next section, so saving now stores the cur-
rent condition of the file on your hard disk for safekeeping.
Restrictions on Noun/Verb Object Selection
For many of the modifying or construction-oriented commands, the Noun/Verb selection 
method is inappropriate because, for those commands, you must select more than one set of 
objects. You’ll know whether a command accepts the Noun/Verb selection method right away. 
Commands that don’t accept the Noun/Verb selection method clear the selection and then ask 
you to select an object or set of objects.
If you’d like to take a break, now is a good time to do so. If you want, exit AutoCAD, and 
return to this point in the chapter later. When you return, start AutoCAD and open the 
Door.dwg file.
Modifying an Autoselect Window
Two settings, known as system variables, enable you to use the Autoselect feature in a more flexible 
way. These two settings, Pickdrag and Pickauto, control the behavior of the Autoselect window, 
giving you more options to select objects in your drawing.
Pickdrag    If you click to start a selection window and then decide that you want to use a 
window polygon, crossing polygon, or fence, you can type W↵ for a window polygon, C↵ for a 
crossing polygon, or F↵ for a fence. If this does not work, make sure that the Pickdrag sys-
tem variable is set to 2 by typing PICKDRAG↵2↵.
Pickauto    In a crowded drawing, you may want to use a selection window, but objects close 
to the cursor may be selected instead. If you set Pickauto to 2 by typing PICKAUTO↵2↵, you 
can click and drag your mouse over an object in a crowded drawing without having the single 
object selected. AutoCAD will start a selection window instead. You can still use a single 
click to select a single object.
Click and Drag to Lasso Objects
If you need to use an irregular-shaped window to select objects, you can use a click-and-drag motion 
to start a lasso selection. A lasso enables you to draw an irregular “freehand” selection window of 
any shape. Just as with the rectangular selection window, the direction of the lasso determines 
the method of selection. A clockwise lasso creates a standard window, and a counterclockwise lasso 
creates a crossing window.
Editing with Grips
Earlier, when you selected the door, grips appeared at the endpoints, center points, and mid-
points of the lines and arcs. You can use grips to make direct changes to the shape of objects or 
to move and copy them quickly.
Certiﬁcation
Objective

62  | CHAPTER 2  Creating Your First Drawing   
If you didn’t see grips on the door in the previous exercise, your version of AutoCAD may have 
the Grips feature turned off. To turn them on, refer to the information on grips in Appendix B.
So far, you’ve seen how operations in AutoCAD have a discrete beginning and ending. For 
example, to draw an arc you first issue the Arc command and then go through a series of opera-
tions, including answering prompts and picking points. When you’re finished, you have an arc 
and AutoCAD is ready for the next command.
The Grips feature plays by a different set of rules. Grips offer a small yet powerful set of edit-
ing functions that don’t conform to the lockstep command/prompt/input routine that you’ve 
seen so far. As you work through the following exercises, it’s helpful to think of grips as a subset 
of the standard method of operation in AutoCAD.
To practice using the Grips feature, you’ll make some temporary modifications to the door drawing.
Stretching Lines by Using Grips
In this exercise, you’ll stretch one corner of the door by grabbing the grip points of two lines:
	
1.	 Use the Zoom Realtime tool from the Zoom tool in the View tab’s Navigate 2D panel to 
adjust your view so that the size of the door is similar to what is shown in Figure 2.23. 
You can click and drag the mouse wheel to pan the view if needed.

2.	 Press the Esc key to make sure that you’re not in the middle of a command. Click a point 
below and to the left of the door to start a selection window.

Editing with Grips |  63  
	
3.	 Click above and to the left of the rectangular part of the door, and then place the selection 
window around the door rectangle and click to select it.
	
4.	 Place the cursor on the lower-left corner grip of the rectangle, but don’t press the mouse but-
ton yet. Notice that the cursor jumps to the grip point and that the grip is highlighted. You 
also see some dimensions related to the objects associated with the grip.
	
5.	 Move the cursor to another grip point. Notice again how the cursor jumps to it. When 
placed on a grip, the cursor moves to the exact center of the grip point. This means that, 
for example, if the cursor is placed on an endpoint grip, it’s on the exact endpoint of the 
object.
	
6.	 Move the cursor to the upper-left corner grip of the rectangle and click. The grip becomes 
a solid color and is now a hot grip. The prompt displays the following message:
**STRETCH**
Specify stretch point or [Base point/Copy/Undo/eXit]:
This prompt tells you that Stretch mode is active. Notice the options in the prompt. As you 
move the cursor, the corner follows, and the lines of the rectangle stretch (see Figure 2.23).
You can control the size and color of grips by using the Selection tab in the Options dialog 
box; see Appendix B for details.
	
7.	 Move the cursor upward toward the top end of the arc and click that point. The rectangle 
deforms with the corner placed at your pick point (see Figure 2.23).
Here you saw that a command called Stretch is issued by clicking a grip point. As you’ll see 
in these next steps, a handful of other hot-grip commands are also available:
	
1.	 Notice that the grips are still active. Click the grip point that you moved before to make it 
a hot grip again.
	
2.	 Right-click to open a context menu that contains a list of grip-edit options (see Figure 2.24).
Figure 2.24
A list of grip-edit 
options
When you click the joining grip point of two contiguous line segments, AutoCAD selects 
the overlapping grips of two lines. When you stretch the corner away from its original 
location, the endpoints of both lines follow.

64  | CHAPTER 2  Creating Your First Drawing   
	
3.	 Choose Base Point from the list, and then click a point to the right of the hot grip. Now as 
you move the cursor, the hot grip moves relative to the cursor.
	
4.	 Right-click again, choose Copy from the context menu, and enter @1<-30↵. (Metric users 
should enter @3<-30↵.) Instead of the hot grip moving and the lines changing, copies of 
the two lines are made with their endpoints 1 unit (or 3 units for metric users) below and 
to the right of the first set of endpoints.
	
5.	 Pick another point just below the last. More copies are made.
	
6.	 Press ↵ or enter X↵ to exit Stretch mode. You can also right-click again and choose Exit 
from the context menu.
In this exercise, you saw that you can select a base point other than the hot grip. You also saw 
how you can specify relative coordinates to move or copy a hot grip. Finally, you saw that with 
grips selected on an object, right-clicking opens a context menu that contains grip-edit options.
Moving and Rotating with Grips
As you’ve just seen, the Grips feature is an alternative method for editing your drawings. You’ve 
already seen how you can stretch endpoints, but you can do much more with grips. The next 
exercise demonstrates some other options. You’ll start by undoing the modifications you made 
in the preceding exercise:
	
1.	 Type U↵. The copies of the stretched lines disappear.
	
2.	 Press ↵ again. The deformed door snaps back to its original form.
Pressing ↵ at the Command prompt causes AutoCAD to repeat the last command 
entered—in this case, U.
	
3.	 Type Zoom↵0.6↵ to show more of the drawing’s work area.
	
4.	 You are going to select the entire door. First, click a blank area below and to the right of 
the door.
	
5.	 Move the cursor to a location above and to the left of the rectangular portion of the door 
and click. Because you went from right to left, you created a crossing window. Recall that 
the crossing window selects anything enclosed and crossing through the window.
	
6.	 Click the lower-left grip of the rectangle to turn it into a hot grip. Just as before, as you 
move your cursor the corner stretches.
	
7.	 Right-click and choose Move from the context menu. The Command window displays 
the following:
**MOVE**
Specify move point or [Base point/Copy/Undo/eXit]
Now as you move the cursor, the entire door moves with it.
	
8.	 Position the door near the center of the screen and click. The door moves to the center of 
the screen. Notice that the Command prompt returns but the door remains highlighted, 
indicating that it’s still selected for the next operation.

Editing with Grips |  65  
	
9.	 Click the lower-left grip again, right-click, and choose Rotate from the context menu. The 
Command window displays the following:
**ROTATE**
Specify rotation angle or [Base point/Copy/Undo/Reference/eXit]:
As you move the cursor, the door rotates about the grip point.
	
10.	 Position the cursor so that the door rotates approximately 180° (see Figure 2.25). Then 
Ctrl+click (hold down the Ctrl key and press the left mouse button). A copy of the door 
appears in the new rotated position, leaving the original door in place.
Figure 2.25

the door by using a 
hot grip. Notice that 
more than one object 
is affected by the grip 
edit, even though only 
one grip is hot.
	
11.	 Press ↵ to exit Grip Edit mode.
You’ve seen how the Move command is duplicated in a modified way as a hot-grip com-
mand. Other hot-grip commands (Stretch, Rotate, Scale, and Mirror) have similar counterparts 
in the standard set of AutoCAD commands. You’ll see how those work in Chapter 11, “Using 
Dimensions,” and Chapter 13, “Copying Existing Drawings from Other Sources.”
After you complete any operation by using grips, the objects are still highlighted with their 
grips active. To clear the grip selection, press the Esc key.
In this exercise, you saw how hot-grip options appear in a context menu. Several other 
options are available in that menu, including Exit, Base Point, Copy, and Undo.
You can access many of these grip-edit options by pressing the spacebar or ↵ while a grip is 
selected. With each press, the next option becomes active. The options then repeat if you con-
tinue to press ↵. The Ctrl key acts as a shortcut to the Copy option. You have to use it only once; 
then, each time you click a point, a copy is made.

Understanding Dynamic Input
You’ve seen how AutoCAD displays a lot of information at the cursor through its Dynamic 
Input display. In this section, you’ll now get a chance to explore the Dynamic Input display 
through grip editing.
You’ll start by going back to the original version of the Door.dwg drawing that you saved 
earlier:
	
1.	 Click the Close icon in the Drawing tab of the drawing area.
	
2.	 When you’re asked if you want to save changes, click No.
	
3.	 Click Open from the Quick Access toolbar, and then locate and select the Door.dwg file 
that you saved earlier. You can also open the doorsample.dwg file from the sample 
files that you installed from this book’s web page.
The door appears in the condition in which you left it when you last saved the file.
	
4.	 Click the Pan tool in the Navigation bar, and click and drag the mouse to pan the view to 
the center of the drawing area.
	
5.	 Right-click and select Exit to exit the Pan tool.
	
6.	 Click the arc to expose its grips.

Scaling with Grips
Grips can be used to scale an object graphically to fit between two other objects. For example, a door 
can be scaled to fit within a door frame. Place the door so that its hinge side is at the door frame 
and the door is oriented properly for the frame. With the door selected, click the grip at the hinge 
side. Right-click and select Scale. Type R↵ or select Reference from the command line, and then 
click the grip at the hinge again. Click the grip at the end of the arc representing the door swing. 
Finally, click the opposite side of the door frame.
Click the grip
at the hinge.
Right-click and
select Scale.
Type R    and
click these grips
hinge side ﬁrst.
Click the endpoint of
the frame to scale the door.
Don’t See the Dynamic Input Display?
If you don’t see the Dynamic Input display at the cursor, type Dynmode ↵↵ to turn it on. You can also 
click the Customization tool at the far-right end of the status bar and select Dynamic Input to add the 
Dynamic Input tool to the status bar. This tool lets you toggle the Dynamic Input display on and off.

Understanding Dynamic Input |  67  
	
7.	 Place the cursor on the grip at the middle of the arc, but don’t click it. (This is called hover-
ing over a grip.) You see the dimensions of the arc appear as well as a menu offering two 
options: Stretch and Radius. The dimensions are useful when you need to check the size 
of objects you’ve drawn (see Figure 2.26).
Figure 2.26
Hovering over 
a grip
	
8.	 Click the Radius option in the grip menu. The Command prompt appears at the cursor, 
and the radius dimension changes to a text box.
	
9.	 Move the cursor toward the upper-right corner of the drawing area. The radius dimen-
sion of the arc changes as you move the cursor.
	
10.	 Enter 4↵. Metric users enter 12↵. As you type, the new value appears in the radius 
dimension. When you press ↵, the arc changes to the new radius.
	
11.	 Click the Undo button to revert to the original arc size.
Here you saw the basic methods for using the Dynamic Input display. You can hover over 
an object’s grip to display its dimensions along with a grip menu. The menu appears for many 
but not all grips, and the contents of the menu depend on the object selected. Click the grip, and 
if available, the dimensions can be edited directly through the keyboard. In this example, you 
were able to change the radius of the arc to an exact value by selecting the Radius option from 
the grip menu and then entering a value. Depending on the grip you click, you can change a 
dimension through direct keyboard input. For example, if you want to change the degrees the 
arc covers instead of its radius, you can hover over the arrow grip at either end of the arc and 
select Lengthen. The dimensions that appear can then be edited to increase or decrease the 
length of the arc without affecting its radius.

68  | CHAPTER 2  Creating Your First Drawing   
Next, try Dynamic Input display on a line:
	
1.	 Click the bottommost line of the door, as shown in Figure 2.27. Hover over the rightmost 
grip on the selected line. Just as you saw with the arc, you can see the dimensions of the 
line, including its length and directional angle. You also see a menu that offers the Stretch 
and Lengthen options.
Figure 2.27
Selecting a line on 
the door
	
2.	 Click the grip over which you’re hovering, and then move the cursor up and to the 
right. You see two dimensions: One indicates the overall length, and the other shows the 
change in length of the line. You also see the Command prompt at the cursor. Notice that 
the dimension indicating the change in length is highlighted (see Figure 2.28).
Figure 2.28

3.	 Type 1 and press the Tab key, not the Enter key, to increase the length of the line by 1 unit. 
Metric users should enter 3 and press the Tab key. Now, as you move the cursor, the line 
is locked at a new length that is 1 (or 3) units longer than its original length. Also notice 
that the overall dimension is highlighted. You also see a lock icon on the length dimen-
sion (see Figure 2.29).
Figure 2.29
The line locked at a 
new length
	
4.	 Press the Tab key again. The angle value is highlighted.
	
5.	 Type 45 and press the Tab key to lock the angle of the line at 45°.
	
6.	 Make sure that the cursor isn’t too close to the locked endpoint of the line and then click 
the left mouse button. The line is now in its new orientation with a length of 4 (12 for met-
ric users) and an angle of 45°, as shown in Figure 2.30.
Figure 2.30

and orientation

70  | CHAPTER 2  Creating Your First Drawing   
You can see that the Dynamic Input display lets you enter specific dimensions for the 
selected object, making possible precise changes in an object’s size. Choose Lengthen from the 
grip menu if you just want to change the length of the line.
You can also use the Dynamic Input display while using other grip-editing features. Try the 
following exercise to see how the Dynamic Input display works while moving objects:
	
1.	 Click above and to the right of the door drawing to start a crossing selection window.
	
2.	 Click below and to the left to select the entire door drawing.
	
3.	 Click the middle grip of the arc.
	
4.	 Right-click and choose Move. You see the Command prompt at the cursor with the dis-
tance value highlighted. As you move the cursor, you can see the distance and angle val-
ues in the Dynamic Input display change (see Figure 2.31).
Figure 2.31
The Dynamic Input 
display
	
5.	 Type 4 (metric users enter 12) and then press the Tab key. As you move the cursor, the 
distance from the original location of the arc’s midpoint is locked at 4 (or 12) units. The 
angle value is now highlighted and available for editing.
	
6.	 Type 225 and then press the Tab key to lock the angle at 225°.
	
7.	 Click a location away from the door drawing. The door moves to its new location, exactly 
4 units (12 units for metric users) from its original location.
As you can see from these exercises, the Dynamic Input display adds some helpful meth-
ods for editing objects. To summarize, here is a rundown of the basic Dynamic Input display 
features:
◆
◆
You can quickly check the dimensions of an object by selecting it and then hovering over a 
grip.
◆
◆
You can alter an object’s dimensions by entering values into the highlighted dimensions of 
the Dynamic Input display.

Displaying Data in a Text Window |  71  
◆
◆
To highlight a different dimension, press the Tab key.
◆
◆
To accept any changes you’ve made using the Dynamic Input display, click at a location 
away from the grip you’re editing. You can also press ↵ or the spacebar.
Not all grips offer dimensions that can be edited. If you click the midpoint grip on the line, 
for example, you won’t see the dimensions of the line, although you’ll see the Command prompt 
and you’ll be able to enter a new coordinate for the midpoint.
As you’ve seen in the arc and line examples, each object offers a different set of dimensions. 
If you like the way that the Dynamic Input display works, you can experiment on other types of 
objects. AutoCAD offers a number of settings that let you control the behavior of the Dynamic 
Input display. You’ll learn about those settings in Appendix B.
Typing Coordinates with Dynamic Input
When entering coordinates through the keyboard while Dynamic Input is enabled, you have to 
use a slightly different notation for relative and absolute coordinates. If you’re entering relative 
coordinates for a series of points as in drawing a polygon with the Line command, you can leave off 
the @ sign after the first point is selected, so instead of typing @12,9↵, you can simply type 12,9↵. 
If you are entering absolute coordinates, you need to precede your coordinate list with a # sign. 
So instead of entering 1,1↵ to specify a point at coordinate 1,1, you would need to enter #1,1↵.
Displaying Data in a Text Window
You may have noticed that as you work in AutoCAD, the activity displayed in the Command 
window scrolls up. Sometimes, it’s helpful to view information that has scrolled past the view 
shown in the Command window. For example, you can review the command activity from your 
session to check input values or to recall other data-entry information. Try the following exer-
cise to see how the Text Window works:
	
1.	 From the Home tab’s expanded Properties panel, click the List tool.
	
2.	 At the Select objects: prompt, click the arc and press ↵. A text window appears 
and displays information about the arc (see Figure 2.32). If your command window is 
undocked, it will expand to display the information. Toward the bottom is the list of the 
arc’s properties. Don’t worry if the meaning of some listed properties isn’t obvious yet; as 
you work your way through this book, you’ll learn what the properties of an object mean.

3.	 If your command window is unlocked, you can dismiss the expanded Command win-
dow by clicking in the drawing area. To bring it back, press the F2 function key or click 
the up-pointing arrowhead at the far right of the unlocked Command window.
You can set the number of lines that AutoCAD retains by using the Options dialog box, or 
you can have AutoCAD record the AutoCAD Text Window information in a text file.
When you have more than one document open, the AutoCAD Command window displays a 
listing for the drawing that is currently active.

Docking the Command Window
If you’ve used AutoCAD before, you may wonder if you can restore the old-style Command window. 
You can do this by docking the window to the bottom of the AutoCAD window. Once this is done, 
the Command window behaves the same way as in earlier versions of AutoCAD. You can open a 
separate Text Window by entering TEXTSCR↵ or by pressing F2.
Displaying the Properties of an Object
While we’re on the subject of displaying information, you’ll want to know about the Properties 
palette. In the preceding exercise, you saw how the List command showed some information 
regarding the properties of an object, such as the location of an arc’s center and endpoints. You 
can also double-click an object to display the Quick Properties palette that shows other basic 
information about the object. (You might accidentally display the Quick Properties palette from 
time to time!) The Properties palette provides a more complete view of an object’s properties 
with the additional feature of allowing you to make changes to those properties. The Properties 
palette is so useful that you may want to consider leaving it open all the time.
To see what the Properties palette is for, try the following exercise:
	
1.	 If you haven’t done so already, select the arc in the drawing, right-click it, and select 
Properties to open the Properties palette, which displays a list of the arc’s properties.

Displaying the Properties of an Object |  73  
Don’t worry if many of the items in this palette are undecipherable; you’ll learn more 
about this palette as you work through the early chapters of this book. For now, just be 
aware that you can get to this palette with a right-click and that it displays the object’s 
properties. You can also use it to modify many of the properties listed (see Figure 2.33).
Figure 2.33

palette
	
2.	 Click the small Auto-hide box at the top of the Properties palette. It’s the icon that looks 
like a double arrow. The icon changes to a single arrow. The Auto-hide option in the 
Properties palette lets you keep the palette open without having it take up too much 
of the drawing area. This can be useful when you need to edit the properties of many 
objects.
	
3.	 Move the cursor away from the Properties palette. The Properties palette collapses so that 
only the title bar remains.
	
4.	 Hover the cursor on the Properties palette title bar. The Properties palette opens to dis-
play all of the options again.
	
5.	 Click the Auto-hide box again to restore the “always open” mode of the palette.
	
6.	 Close the Properties palette by clicking the X in its upper corner. (The X appears in 
the upper-left or upper-right corner, depending on the placement of the palette in the 
AutoCAD window.) You can also right-click the title bar on the side of the Properties pal-
ette and then choose Close from the context menu.
	
7.	 You’re finished with the door drawing, so choose Close from the Application menu.

8.	 In the AutoCAD dialog box, click the No button. (You’ve already saved this file just as 
you want it, so you don’t need to save it again.)
Using Rotate Reference to Align Objects
You can use the Rotate command’s Reference option to align a set of objects graphically to another 
object. For example, suppose you want to rotate a set of circles inside a hexagon to align with the 
corner of the hexagon.
To do this, you can use the Reference option as follows:
	1.	 Start the Rotate command, and select the circles.
	2.	 At the Specify base point: prompt, use the Center osnap to select the center of the hexagon 
as represented by the central circle. Once you do this, the objects rotate around the selected point 
as you move your cursor.
Select the 
center of the 
hexagon for 
the base point.
Type R    and 
select the center 
of the hexagon
again.
Select the center 
of one of the circles 
you want to align
to a corner.
Select a corner
of the hexagon
to align the circles 
to the corners.
	3.	 At the Specify rotation angle or [Copy/Reference]: prompt, enter R↵.
	4.	 At the Specify the reference angle <0>: prompt, use the Center osnap to select the center 
of the hexagon again. You can also enter @↵ since the last point you selected was the center.
	5.	 At the Specify second point: prompt, use the Center osnap to select the center of one of the 
circles you want to align with the hexagon. Now, as you move the cursor, the circle whose center 
you selected is aligned with the cursor angle.
	6.	 At the Specify the new angle or [Points]: prompt, use the Endpoint osnap to select one 
of the corners of the hexagon. The circles align with the corners.
You can also use grips to align objects. Here’s how: Select the object or set of objects and then click 
a grip. The grip you select becomes the rotation point, so select this first grip carefully. Right-click 
and select Rotate. Type R↵ and select the grip you just selected and another point to determine 
the reference angle. Finally, select the new angle for the object or set of objects. If you want to 
rotate about a point other than the first grip, use the Grip Base right-click option. If you’d like  
to experiment with the Rotate Reference option, we’ve provided a sample file that you can use 
called rotatereference.dwg.

Getting Help |  75  
In many cases, you can open the Properties palette by double-clicking an object. Some 
objects, however, display a dialog box to allow you to edit them.
Another feature related to the Properties palette is the Quick Properties tool and palette. 
The Quick Properties palette appears whenever you double-click an object or set of objects (see 
Figure 2.34).
Figure 2.34
The Quick Properties 
palette
The Quick Properties palette lets you control just a few properties of an object (color, layer, 
linetype, and length). When turned on, it pops up every time you select an object, so you may 
want to limit its use to those times when you are adjusting the color, layer, and linetype of 
objects in your drawing.
Getting Help
Eventually, you’ll find yourself somewhere without documentation and you’ll have a question 
about an AutoCAD feature. AutoCAD provides an online help facility that gives you informa-
tion on nearly any topic related to AutoCAD.
You can open the AutoCAD Help website by clicking the Help tool in the InfoCenter. There 
you’ll find a comprehensive set of help topics and tools, including video tutorials and the stan-
dard help documentation. As with many other programs, you can obtain context-sensitive help 
by pressing the F1 function key.
If you’re looking for more general information about AutoCAD, the Start tab offers some 
introductory videos and links to online training. Click the Learn option at the bottom of the 
Start tab to view these resources. Click the Create option at the bottom of the Start tab to return 
to the drawing file options.
Using the InfoCenter
If you want to find information about a topic based on a keyword, you can use the InfoCenter in 
the upper-right corner of the AutoCAD window. Follow these steps:
	
1.	 Type change in the InfoCenter text box at the top right of the AutoCAD window, and 
then click the Search tool to the right of the text box.
	
2.	 The AutoCAD Help window opens and displays information on the Change command 
(see Figure 2.35).
You can use Boolean AND, OR, NEAR, and NOT in conjunction with other keywords to 
help filter your searches, just as in a typical search engine that you might use in your web 
browser.

Chapter  3
Setting Up and Using the  
Drafting Tools 
Chapter 1, “Exploring the Interface,” and Chapter 2, “Creating Your First Drawing,” covered the 
basic information you need to understand the workings of the AutoCAD® 2017 software. Now 
you’ll put this knowledge to work. In this architectural tutorial, which begins here and contin-
ues through Chapter 14, “Advanced Editing and Organizing,” you’ll draw an apartment build-
ing composed of studios. We’ll show you how to use AutoCAD commands and give you a solid 
understanding of the basic AutoCAD package. With these fundamentals, you can use AutoCAD 
to its fullest potential regardless of the kinds of drawings you intend to create or the enhance-
ment products you may use in the future.
In this chapter, you’ll start drawing an apartment’s bathroom fixtures. In the process, you’ll 
learn how to use the basic AutoCAD tools. You’ll also be introduced to the concept of drawing 
scale and how the size of what you draw is translated into a paper sheet size.
In this chapter, you will learn to

Setting Up a Work Area
Before beginning most drawings, you should set up your work area. To do this, determine 
the measurement system, the drawing sheet size, and the scale you want to use. The default 
work area is roughly 16″×9″ at full scale, given a decimal measurement system in which 1 unit 
equals 1 inch. Metric users will find that the default area is roughly 550×300 mm, in which 1 
unit equals 1 mm. If these are appropriate settings for your drawing, you don’t have to do any 
setting up. It’s more likely, however, that you’ll make drawings of various sizes and scales. 
For example, you might want to create a drawing in a measurement system in which you can 
specify feet, inches, and fractions of inches at 1′ = 1″ scale and print the drawing on an 81/2″×11″ 
sheet of paper.
In this section, you’ll learn how to set up a drawing exactly the way you want.

Specifying Units
You’ll start by creating a new file called Bath. Then you’ll set up the unit style.
Use these steps to create the file:
	
1.	 If you haven’t done so already, start AutoCAD. If AutoCAD is already running, click the 
Templates drop-down list just below the Start Drawing icon in the Dashboard.
	
2.	 Select acad.dwt from the list. Metric users should select acadiso.dwt.
	
3.	 Type Z↵A↵ or select Zoom All from the Zoom flyout in the Navigation bar.
	
4.	 Choose Save As from the Application menu.
	
5.	 In the Save Drawing As dialog box, enter Bath for the filename.
	
6.	 Check to make sure that you’re saving the drawing in the My Documents folder, or in the 
folder where you’ve chosen to store your exercise files, and then click Save.

Objective
Using the Imperial and Metric Examples
The exercises in this book are shown in both the metric and Imperial measurement systems. Be 
sure that if you start to work with the Imperial system, you continue with it throughout this book.
The metric settings described in this book are only approximations of their Imperial equivalents. 
For example, the drawing scale for the metric example is 1:10, which is close to the 1″ = 1′-0″ scale 
used in the Imperial example. In the grid example, you’re asked to use a 30-unit grid, which is 
close to the 1′ grid of the Imperial example. Dimensions of objects are similar, but not exact. For 
example, the Imperial version of the tub measures 2′-8″×5′-0″ and the metric version of the tub is 
81×152 cm. The actual metric equivalent of 2′-8″×5′-0″ is 81.28×152.4 cm. Measurements in the 
tub example are rounded to the nearest centimeter.
Metric users should also be aware that AutoCAD uses a period as a decimal point instead of the 
comma used in most European nations, South Africa, and elsewhere. Commas are used in AutoCAD 
to separate the X, Y, and Z components of a coordinate.
The next thing you want to tell AutoCAD is the unit style you intend to use. So far, you’ve 
been using the default, which is a generic decimal unit. This unit can be interpreted as 
inches, centimeters, feet, kilometers, or light-years—whatever you like. When it comes time 
to print your drawing, you can tell AutoCAD how to convert these units into a meaningful 
scale.
If you are a U.S. user, decimal units typically represent inches. If you want to be able to enter 
distances in feet, you must change the unit style to a style that accepts feet as input. In this chap-
ter, you’ll do this through the Drawing Units dialog box shown in Figure 3.1.
If you’re a civil engineer, you should know that the Engineering unit style lets you enter 
feet and decimal feet for distances. For example, the equivalent of 12′-6″ is 12.5′. If you use the 
Engineering unit style, you’ll ensure that your drawings conform to the scale of drawings cre-
ated by your architectural colleagues.

Setting Up a Work Area |  81  
Follow these steps to set a unit style:
	
1.	 Choose Drawing Utilities ➢ Units from the Application menu or type Un↵ to open the 
Drawing Units dialog box. Remember that you can open the Application menu by click-
ing the red AutoCAD icon in the upper-left corner of the AutoCAD window.
	
2.	 Let’s look at a few of the options available. Click the Type drop-down list in the Length 
group. Notice the unit styles in the list.
	
3.	 Click Architectural. The Sample Output group of the dialog box shows you what the 
Architectural style looks like in AutoCAD. Metric users should keep this setting as 
Decimal.

Shortcut to Setting Units
You can also control the Drawing Units settings by using several system variables. To set the unit 
style, you can type 'lunits↵ at the Command prompt. (The apostrophe lets you enter this command 
while in the middle of other commands.) At the Enter new value for LUNITS <2>: prompt,

If you use the Imperial system of measurement, you selected Architectural measurement 
units for this tutorial, but your work may require a different unit style. You saw the unit styles 
available in the Drawing Units dialog box. Table 3.1 shows examples of how the distance 15.5 is 
entered in each of these styles.

In the previous exercise, you needed to change only two settings. Let’s look at the other 
Drawing Units settings in more detail. As you read, you may want to refer to Figure 3.1.
Fine-Tuning the Measurement System
Most of the time you’ll be concerned only with the units and angles settings of the Drawing 
Units dialog box. But as you saw in the preceding exercise, you can control many other settings 
related to the input and display of units.
Taking Measurements
To measure the distance between two points, click Distance from the Measure flyout on the Home 
tab’s Utilities panel, or type Mea↵D↵ and then click the two points. (Mea is the shortcut for the 
Measuregeom command.) If this command doesn’t give you an accurate distance measurement, 
examine the Precision option in the Drawing Units dialog box. If it’s set too high, the value returned 
by the Measuregeom command may be rounded to a greater number than your tolerances allow, 
even though the distance is drawn accurately.
The Precision drop-down list in the Length group lets you specify the smallest unit value 
that you want AutoCAD to display in the status bar and in the prompts. If you choose a mea-
surement system that uses fractions, the Precision list includes fractional units. You can also 
control this setting with the Luprec system variable.

Setting Up a Work Area |  83  
The Angle group lets you set the style for displaying angles. You have a choice of five angle 
types: Decimal Degrees, Degrees/Minutes/Seconds, Grads, Radians, and Surveyor’s Units. In 
the Angle group’s Precision drop-down list, you can specify the degree of accuracy you want 
AutoCAD to display for angles. You can also control these settings with the Aunits and Auprec 
system variables.
You can find out more about system variables on the AutoCAD 2017 Help website. First,  
open the Help website by clicking the question mark icon in the Info Center at the top-right side 
of the AutoCAD window. Select the System Variables option in the right side of the page. You 
may need to scroll down to see it. In the System Variable Quick Reference, select the first letter of 
a system variable name from the list.
You can tell AutoCAD which direction is positive, either clockwise or counterclockwise. The 
default, which is counterclockwise, is used in this book. The Direction Control dialog box lets 
you set the direction of the 0 base angle. The default base angle (and the one used throughout 
this book) is a direction from left to right. However, at times you may want to designate another 
direction as the 0 base angle. You can also control these settings with the Angbase and Angdir 
system variables.
The Insertion Scale setting in the Drawing Units dialog box lets you control how blocks from 
the tool palettes or DesignCenter™ are scaled as they’re imported into your current drawing. 
A block is a collection of drawing objects that form a single object. Blocks are frequently used to 
create standard symbols. You’ll learn more about blocks in Chapter 4, “Organizing Objects with 
Blocks and Groups.” The Insertion Scale setting lets you compensate for drawings of different 
scales by offering an automatic scale translation when importing blocks from an external file. 
The Insunits system variable also controls the Insertion Scale setting. You’ll learn more about 
this setting in Chapter 25.
If you’re new to AutoCAD, don’t worry about the Insertion Scale setting right now. Make a 
mental note of it. It may come in handy in your work in the future.
Setting Up the Drawing Limits
One of the big advantages of using AutoCAD is that you can draw at full scale; you aren’t lim-
ited to the edges of a piece of paper the way you are in manual drawing. But you may find it dif-
ficult to start drawing without knowing the drawing boundaries. You can set up some arbitrary 
boundaries using the Limits feature.
You’ll be drawing a bathroom that is roughly 8′ by 5′ (230 cm by 150 cm for metric users). 
You’ll want to give yourself some extra room around the bathroom, so your drawing limits 
should be a bit larger than that actual bathroom size. You’ll use an area of 11′ by 8′-6″ for the 
limits of your drawing. Metric users will use an area 297 cm by 210 cm. These sizes will accom-
modate your bathroom with some room to spare.
Now that you know the area you need, you can use the Limits command to set up the area:
	
1.	 Type LIMITS↵.
	
2.	 At the Specify lower left corner or [ON/OFF] <0′-0″,0′-0″>: prompt, specify the 
lower-left corner of your work area. Press ↵ to accept the default.
	
3.	 At the Specify upper right corner <1′-0″,0′-9″>: prompt, you can specify the upper-
right corner of your work area. (The default is shown in brackets.) Enter 132,102. Or, if 
you prefer, you can enter 11′,8′6 because you’ve set up your drawing for Architectural 
units. Metric users should enter 297,210.

84  | CHAPTER 3  Setting Up and Using the Drafting Tools    
	
4.	 Select Zoom All from the Zoom flyout in the Navigation bar, or type Z↵A↵. Although it 
appears that nothing has changed, your drawing area is now set to a size that will enable 
you to draw your bathroom at full scale.
	
5.	 Move the cursor to the upper-right corner of the drawing area and watch the coordinate 
readout at the left end of the status bar. If you don’t see the coordinate readout, select 
Coordinates from the Customize tool in the lower-right corner of the AutoCAD window. 
Notice that now the upper-right corner has a y-coordinate of approximately 8′-6″, or 210 
for metric users. The x-coordinate depends on the proportion of your AutoCAD window. 
The coordinate readout also displays distances in feet and inches.
	
6.	 Click the Grid Display tool in the status bar to turn off the grid.
Things to Watch for When Entering Distances
When you’re using Architectural units, you should be aware of two points:
◆
◆
Use hyphens only to distinguish fractions from whole inches.
◆
◆
You can’t use spaces while specifying a dimension. For example, you can specify eight feet, four 
and one-half inches as 8′4–1⁄2″ or 8′4.5, but not as 8′-4 1⁄2″.
These idiosyncrasies are a source of confusion to many architects and engineers new to AutoCAD 
because the program often displays architectural dimensions in the standard architectural format 
but doesn’t allow you to enter dimensions that way.
Here are some tips for entering distances and angles in unusual situations:
◆
◆
When entering distances in inches and feet, you can omit the inch (″) sign. If you’re using the 
Engineering unit style, you can enter decimal feet and forgo the inch sign entirely.
◆
◆
You can enter fractional distances and angles in any format you like, regardless of the current 
unit style. For example, you can enter a distance as @1⁄2 <1.5708r, even if your current unit 
system is set for decimal units and decimal degrees (1.5708r is the radian equivalent of 90°).
◆
◆
If you have your angle units set to grads, radians, or degrees, you don’t need to specify g, r, or 
d after the angle. You do have to specify g, r, or d, however, if you want to use these units when 
they aren’t the current default angle system.
◆
◆
If your current base angle is set to something other than horizontal from left to right, you can 
use a double less-than symbol (<<) in place of the single less-than symbol (<) to override the 
current base angle. The << assumes the base angle of 0° to be a direction from left to right and 
the positive direction to be counterclockwise.
◆
◆
If your current angle system uses a different base angle and direction and you want to specify 
an angle in the standard base direction, you can use a triple less-than symbol (<<<) to indicate 
angles. Note that this works only if Dynamic Input is turned off.
◆
◆
You can specify a denominator of any size when specifying fractions. However, be aware 
that the value you’ve set for the maximum number of digits to the right of decimal points 
(under the Precision setting in the Length group of the Drawing Units dialog box) restricts 
the fractional value AutoCAD reports. For example, if your units are set for a maximum of two 

Setting Up a Work Area |  85  
In step 5, the coordinate readout shows you that your drawing area is larger than before. The 
background grid can help you visualize the area in which you’re working. You can control the 
grid using the Grid Display tool in the status bar, which you’ll learn about toward the end of 
this chapter. Grid Display shows a background grid that helps you visualize distances, and it 
can also show you the limits of your drawing. It can be a bit distracting for a new user, so we’ve 
asked you to turn it off for now.
Looking at an Alternative to Limits
As an alternative to setting up the drawing limits, you can draw a rectangle that outlines the 
same area used to define the drawing limits. For example, in the previous exercise you could 
use the Rectangle tool to draw a rectangle that has its lower-left corner at coordinate 0,0 and its 
upper-right corner at 132,102 (297,210 for metric users). You can set up the rectangle to be visible 
without printing using the Layer feature. You’ll learn more about layers in Chapter 5, “Keeping 
Track of Layers and Blocks.”
digits of decimals and you give a fractional value of 5⁄32, AutoCAD rounds this value to 3⁄16. 
Note that this doesn’t affect the accuracy of the actual drawing dimensions.
◆
◆
You can enter decimal feet for distances in the Architectural unit style. For example, you can 
enter 6′-6″ as 6.5′.
Coordinating with Paper Sizes
At this point, you may have questions about how your full-scale drawing will fit onto standard paper 
sizes. AutoCAD offers several features that give you precise control over the scale of your drawing. 
These features offer industry-standard scales to match your drawing with any paper size you need. 
You’ll learn more about these features as you work through the chapters of this book. However, if 
you’re anxious to find out about them, look at the sections on layouts in Chapter 8, “Introducing 
Printing, Plotting, and Layouts,” and Chapter 15, “Laying Out Your Printer Output,” and also check 
out the Annotative Scale feature in Chapter 9, “Adding Text to Drawings.”
Understanding Scale Factors
If you’ve ever had to create a drawing to scale using pencil and paper, you rely on an architect’s 
or engineer’s scale to mark off distances on paper. You are working directly with the final media 
on which the drawing will appear. With a CAD program, you’re a few steps removed from the 
finished product. Because of this, you need a deeper understanding of your drawing scale and 
how it’s derived. In particular, you must understand scale factors. For example, one common use 
of scale factors is translating the size of a graphic symbol, such as a section symbol in an archi-
tectural drawing, to the final plotted text size. When you draw manually, you draw your symbol 
at the size you want. In a CAD drawing, you need to translate the desired final symbol size to 
the drawing scale.

86  | CHAPTER 3  Setting Up and Using the Drafting Tools    
When you start adding graphic symbols to your drawing (see Chapter 4), you have to specify 
a symbol height. The scale factor helps you determine the appropriate symbol height for a par-
ticular drawing scale. For example, you may want your symbol to appear 1/2″ high in your final 
plot. But if you draw your symbol to 1/2″ in your drawing, it appears as a dot when plotted. The 
symbol has to be scaled up to a size that, when scaled back down at plot time, appears 1/2″ high. 
For a 1/4″ scale drawing, you multiply the 1/2″ text height by a scale factor of 48 to get 24″. Your 
symbol should be 24″ high in the CAD drawing in order to appear 1/2″ high in the final plot. 
Where did the number 48 come from?
The scale factor for fractional inch scales is derived by multiplying the denominator of the 
scale by 12 and then dividing by the numerator. For example, the scale factor for 1/4″ = 1′-0″ is 
(4 times 12) / 1, or 48⁄1. For 3⁄16″ = 1′-0″ scale, the operation is (16 times 12) / 3, or 64. For whole-
foot scales such as 1″= 10′, multiply the feet side of the equation by 12. Metric scales require 
simple decimal conversions.
You can also use scale factors to determine your drawing limits. For example, if you have 
a sheet size of 11″ by 17″ and you want to know the equivalent full-scale size for a 1/4″ scale 
drawing, you multiply the sheet measurements by 48. In this way, 11″ becomes 528″ (48 times 
11″), and 17″ becomes 816″ (48 times 17″). Your work area must be 528″ by 816″ if you intend to 
have a final output of 11″ by 17″ at 1/4″ = 1′. You can divide these inch measurements by 12″ to 
get 44′ by 68′.
Table 3.2 shows scale factors as they relate to standard drawing scales. These scale factors 
are the values by which you multiply the desired final printout size to get the equivalent full-
scale size. If you’re using the metric system, you can use the drawing scale directly as the scale 
factor. For example, a drawing scale of 1:10 has a scale factor of 10, a drawing scale of 1:50 has 
a scale factor of 50, and so on. Metric users need to take special care regarding the base unit. 
Centimeters are used as a base unit in the examples in this book, which means that if you enter 
a distance as 1, you can assume the distance to be 1 cm.

In older drawings, scale factors were used to determine text height and dimension settings. 
Chances are that you will eventually have to work with drawings created by older AutoCAD 
versions, so understanding scale factors will pay off later. Plotting to a particular scale is also 
easier with an understanding of scale factors.

Setting Up a Work Area |  87  
Using Polar Tracking
In this section, you’ll draw the first item in the bathroom: the toilet. It’s composed of a rectangle 
representing the tank and a truncated ellipse representing the seat. To construct the toilet, you’ll 
use Polar Tracking, which is one of the more versatile drafting tools. Polar Tracking helps you 
align your cursor to exact horizontal and vertical angles, much like a T-square and triangle.
In this exercise, you’ll use Polar Tracking to draw a rectangular box:
	
1.	 Start a line at the coordinate 5′-7″, 6′-3″ by entering L↵5′7″,6′3″↵. Metric users should enter 
L↵171,189↵ as the starting coordinate. This starting point is somewhat arbitrary, but by 
entering a specific starting location, you’re coordinated with the figures and instructions 
in this book. You can also use the Line tool in the Draw panel to start the line.
	
2.	 Make sure Polar Tracking is on (the Polar Tracking tool in the status bar should be blue), 
and then point the cursor directly to the right of the last point. The tracking vector 
appears at the cursor along with the Polar Tracking readout and dimensions.
Certiﬁcation
Objective
	
3.	 With the cursor pointing directly to the right, enter 1′-10″↵. Metric users should enter 56↵. 
You can use the spacebar in place of the ↵ key when entering distances in this way.
	
4.	 Point the cursor downward and enter 9↵ for 9″. Metric users should enter 23↵.
	
5.	 Continue drawing the other two sides of the rectangle by using Polar Tracking. After 
you’ve completed the rectangle, press ↵ or the Esc key to exit the Line tool. You should 
have a drawing that looks like Figure 3.2.
Figure 3.2
A plan view of the 
toilet tank
As you can see from the exercise, you can use Polar Tracking and the tracking vector to 
restrain your cursor to horizontal and vertical positions, just as you would use a T-square and 

88  | CHAPTER 3  Setting Up and Using the Drafting Tools    
triangle. Later, you’ll learn how you can set up Polar Tracking to set the angle to any value you 
want in a way similar to an adjustable triangle.
In some situations, you may find that you don’t want Polar Tracking on. You can turn it off by 
clicking the Polar Tracking tool in the status bar. You can also press the F10 function key to turn 
Polar Tracking on or off.
Although this exercise tells you to use the Line tool to draw the tank, you can also use the 
Rectangle tool. The Rectangle tool creates what is known as a polyline, which is a set of line 
or arc segments that act like a single object. You’ll learn more about polylines in Chapter 18, 
“Drawing Curves.”
By using the Snap modes in conjunction with the coordinate readout and Polar Tracking, you 
can locate coordinates and measure distances as you draw lines. This is similar to the way you 
draw when using a scale. The smallest distance registered by the coordinate readout and the 
Polar Tracking readout depends on the area you’ve displayed on your screen. For example, if 
you’re displaying an area the size of a football field, the smallest distance you can indicate with 
your cursor may be 6″, or 15 cm. On the other hand, if your view is enlarged to show an area of 
only one square inch or centimeter, you can indicate distances as small as 1⁄1000 of an inch or 
centimeter by using your cursor.
Setting the Polar Tracking Angle
You’ve seen how Polar Tracking lets you draw exact vertical and horizontal lines. You can also 
set Polar Tracking to draw lines at other angles, such as 30° or 45°. To change the angle Polar 
Tracking uses, you use the Polar Tracking tab in the Drafting Settings dialog box (see Figure 3.3).
Figure 3.3
The Polar Tracking 
tab in the Drafting 
Settings dialog box
Right-click the Polar Tracking tool in the status bar, and then choose Settings from the con-
text menu to open the Drafting Settings dialog box. As an alternative, you can type DS↵ and 
then click the Polar Tracking tab.

Setting Up a Work Area |  89  
To change the Polar Tracking angle, enter an angle in the Increment Angle text box or select a 
predefined angle from the drop-down list. You can set angles on the fly. Just right-click the Polar 
Tracking tool and select an angle from the drop-down list.
Ortho Mode
Besides using Polar Tracking mode, you can restrain the cursor to a vertical or horizontal direction 
by using Ortho mode. To use Ortho mode, hold down the Shift key while drawing. You can also 
press F8 or click Ortho Mode in the status bar to keep Ortho mode on while you draw. When you 
move the cursor around while drawing objects, the rubber-banding line moves only vertically or 
horizontally. With Ortho mode turned on, Polar Tracking is automatically turned off.
Numerous other settings are available in the Polar Tracking tab. Here is a list of their 
functions:
Additional Angles    This setting lets you enter a specific angle for Polar Tracking. For 
example, if you want Polar Tracking to snap to 12 degrees, click the New button next to the 
Additional Angles list box and enter 12. The value you enter appears in the list box and, 
when the Additional Angles check box is selected, Polar Tracking snaps to 12°. To delete a 
value from the list box, highlight it and click the Delete button.
The Additional Angles option differs from the Increment Angle setting in that the latter 
causes Polar Tracking to snap to every increment of its setting, whereas Additional Angles 
snaps only to the angle specified. You can enter as many angles as you want in the Additional 
Angles list box. As a shortcut, you can use the Polarang system variable (Polarang↵) to set 
the incremental angle without using the dialog box. The Polarmode system variable lets you 
determine whether Polar Tracking uses the current UCS or a selected object as the basis for 
the angle.
Object Snap Tracking Settings    These settings let you control whether Object Snap 
Tracking (or Osnap Tracking) uses strictly orthogonal directions (0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°) or 
the angles set in the Polar Angle Settings group in this dialog box. (See the section “Aligning 
Objects by Using Object Snap Tracking” later in this chapter.)
Polar Angle Measurement    These radio buttons let you determine the zero angle on which 
Polar Tracking bases its incremental angles. The Absolute option uses the current AutoCAD 
setting for the 0° angle. The Relative To Last Segment option uses the last drawn object as 
the 0° angle. For example, if you draw a line at a 10° angle and the Relative To Last Segment 
option is selected with Increment Angle set to 90°, Polar Tracking snaps to 10°, 100°, 190°, and 
280°, relative to the actual 0° direction.
Nudging Objects
If you need to move objects incrementally in an orthogonal direction, you can use the Nudge feature. 
Select the object or objects, and then hold down the Ctrl key and press an arrow key. Your selection 
moves in the direction of the arrow key in small increments.

90  | CHAPTER 3  Setting Up and Using the Drafting Tools    
Exploring the Drawing Process
The following sections present some common AutoCAD commands and show you how to 
use them to complete a simple drawing. As you draw, watch the prompts and notice how your 
responses affect them. Also notice how you use existing drawing elements as reference points.
While drawing with AutoCAD, you create simple geometric forms to determine the basic 
shapes of objects, and you can then modify the shapes to fill in detail.
AutoCAD offers a number of basic 2D drawing object types; lines, arcs, circles, text, dimen-
sions, polylines, points, ellipses, elliptical arcs, spline curves, regions, hatches, and multiline  
text are the most common. All drawings are built on at least some of these objects. In addition, 
there are several 3D solids and meshes, which are three-dimensional shapes. You’re familiar 
with lines and arcs; these, along with circles, are the most commonly used objects. As you prog-
ress through the book, you’ll learn about the other objects and how they’re used. You’ll also 
learn about 3D objects in the chapters on AutoCAD 3D.
Locating an Object in Reference to Others
Continuing to draw the toilet, to define the seat you’ll use an ellipse. Follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Axis, End Ellipse tool from the Ellipse flyout in the Home tab’s Draw panel, or 
type EL↵.
	
2.	 At the Specify axis endpoint of ellipse or [Arc/Center]: prompt, pick the mid-
point of the bottom horizontal line of the rectangle. To do this, Shift+right-click to open the 
Object Snap (Osnap) context menu and select Midpoint; then move the cursor toward  
the bottom line. (Remember, Shift+click the right mouse button to open the Object Snap 
menu.) When you see the Midpoint Osnap marker on the line, click the left mouse button.

Objective
	
3.	 At the Specify other endpoint of axis: prompt, point the cursor downward and 
enter 1′-10″↵. Metric users should enter 55↵.
	
4.	 At the Specify distance to other axis or [Rotation]: prompt, point the cursor 
horizontally from the center of the ellipse and enter 8″↵. Metric users should enter 20↵. 
Your drawing should look like Figure 3.4.

Exploring the Drawing Process |  91  
Getting a Closer Look
During the drawing process, you’ll often want to enlarge areas of a drawing to edit its objects. 
In Chapter 1, you saw how to use the Zoom capability for this purpose. Follow these steps to 
enlarge the view of the toilet:
	
1.	 Click Zoom Window from the Zoom flyout in the Navigation bar, or type Z↵W↵. Next, 
you’ll place a closely fitting window around your toilet.
	
2.	 At the Specify first corner: prompt, pick a point below and to the left of your 
drawing, at or near coordinate 5′-0″,3′-6″. Metric users should use the coordinate 
150.0000,102.0000.
	
3.	 At the Specify opposite corner: prompt, pick a point above and to the right of the 
drawing, at or near coordinate 8′-3″,6′-8″ (246.0000,195.0000 for metric users). The toilet 
should be completely enclosed by the zoom window. You can also use the Zoom Realtime 
tool in conjunction with the Pan Realtime tool. The toilet enlarges to fill more of the 
screen. Your view should look similar to Figure 3.5.
Object Snap and Osnap Are the Same
You will see the terms Osnap and Object Snap throughout this chapter and in other chapters. Osnap 
is just a shortened version of Object Snap. The two terms are interchangeable.
Figure 3.5
The line copied 
down
If you have a mouse with a scroll wheel, you can avoid using the Zoom command altogether. 
Just place the cursor on the toilet and turn the wheel to zoom into the image.
Modifying an Object
Now let’s see how editing commands are used to construct an object. To define the back edge of 
the seat, let’s put a copy of the line defining the front of the toilet tank 3″ (7 cm for metric users) 
toward the center of the ellipse:
	
1.	 Click the Copy tool in the Home tab’s Modify panel, or type CO↵.

92  | CHAPTER 3  Setting Up and Using the Drafting Tools    
	
2.	 At the Select objects: prompt, pick the horizontal line that touches the top of the 
ellipse. The line is highlighted. Press ↵ to complete your selection.
	
3.	 At the Specify base point or [Displacement/mOde] <Displacement>: prompt, pick 
a base point near the line. Then point the cursor down and enter 3″↵, or 7↵ if you’re a met-
ric user.
	
4.	 Press ↵ to exit the Copy command. Your drawing should look like Figure 3.5.
Notice that the Copy command acts exactly like the Move command you used in Chapter 2, 
except that Copy doesn’t alter the position of the objects you select and you must press ↵ to exit 
Copy.
Trimming an Object
Now you must delete the part of the ellipse that isn’t needed. You’ll use the Trim command to 
trim off part of the ellipse:
	
1.	 Click the Trim tool in the Home tab’s Modify panel. If you don’t see the Trim tool, click 
the Trim/Extend flyout and select Trim. You’ll see this prompt:
Current settings: Projection=UCS Edge=None
Select cutting edges ...
Select objects or <select all>:
	
2.	 Click the line you just created—the one that crosses through the ellipse—and press ↵ to 
finish your selection.
	
3.	 At the Select object to trim or shift-select to extend or [Fence/Crossing/
Project/Edge/eRase/Undo]: prompt, hover over the topmost portion of the ellipse 
above the line. Notice that you see a preview of how the ellipse will look when trimmed. 
The top portion of the ellipse dims to a gray line. Also notice the red X by the cursor. This 
indicates that the selected portion of the ellipse will be deleted.
	
4.	 Click the topmost portion of the ellipse above the line. This trims the ellipse back to the line.
	
5.	 Press ↵ to exit the Trim command.
In step 1 of the preceding exercise, the Trim command produces two messages in the prompt. 
The first message, Select cutting edges..., tells you that you must first select objects to 
define the edge to which you want to trim an object. In step 3, you’re again prompted to select 
objects, this time to select the object to trim. Here you see a preview of how the ellipse will look 
before you commit to your selection. The red X by the cursor, called a cursor badge, indicates the 
action that the current command will apply. You will see several cursor badges as you work in 
AutoCAD, each one offering a hint regarding the current activity.
Trim is one of a handful of AutoCAD commands that asks you to select two sets of objects: 
The first set defines a boundary, and the second is the set of objects that you want to edit. The 
two sets of objects aren’t mutually exclusive. You can, for example, select the cutting-edge 
objects as objects to trim. The next exercise shows how this works.
First, you’ll undo the trim you just did. Then, you’ll use the Trim command again in a 
slightly different way to finish the toilet:

the previous exercise. The ellipse trims back.
	
6.	 Click a point near the left end of the trim line, outside the ellipse. The line trims back to 
the ellipse.
	
7.	 Click the other end of the line. The right side of the line trims back to meet the ellipse. 
Your drawing should look like the second image in Figure 3.6.

9.	 Click Save on the Quick Access toolbar to save the file in its current state, but don’t exit

Here you saw how the ellipse and the line are both used as trim objects as well as the objects 
to be trimmed. The Trim options you’ve seen so far—Fence, Crossing, Project, Edge, Erase, and 
Undo—are described in the next section in this chapter. Also note that by holding down the 
Shift key, you can change from trimming an object to extending an object.
Exploring the Trim Options
AutoCAD offers six options for the Trim command: Fence, Crossing, Project, Edge, Erase, and 
Undo. As described in the following list, these options give you a higher degree of control over 
how objects are trimmed:
Fence/Crossing [F or C]    Lets you use a fence or crossing window to select objects.
Project [P]    Useful when you’re working on 3D drawings. It controls how AutoCAD 
trims objects that aren’t coplanar. Project offers three options: None, UCS, and View. 
The None option causes Trim to ignore objects that are on different planes so that only 
coplanar objects are trimmed. If you choose UCS, the Trim command trims objects 
based on a plan view of the current UCS and then disregards whether the objects are 
coplanar. (See the middle of Figure 3.7.) View is similar to UCS but uses the current 
view’s “line of sight” to determine how non-coplanar objects are trimmed. (See the 
bottom of Figure 3.7.)
Edge [E]    Lets you trim an object to an apparent intersection, even if the cutting-edge 
object doesn’t intersect the object to be trimmed (see the top of Figure 3.7). Edge offers two 
options: Extend and No Extend. You can also set these options by using the Edgemode sys-
tem variable.
Erase [R]    Allows you to erase an object while remaining in the Trim command.
Undo [U]    Causes the last trimmed object to revert to its original length.
You’ve just seen one way to construct the toilet. However, you can construct objects in many 
ways. For example, you can trim only the top of the ellipse, as you did in the first trim exercise, 
and then use the Grips feature to move the endpoints of the line to meet the endpoints of the 
ellipse. As you become familiar with AutoCAD, you’ll start to develop your own ways of work-
ing, using the tools best suited to your style.
If you’d like to take a break, now is a good time. You can exit AutoCAD and then come back 
to the Bath drawing file when you’re ready to proceed.

Planning and Laying Out a Drawing
For the next object, the bathtub, you’ll use some new commands to lay out parts of the drawing. 
This will help you get a feel for the kind of planning you must do to use AutoCAD effectively. 
You’ll begin the bathtub by using the Line command to draw a rectangle 2′-8″×5′-0″ (81×152 cm 
for metric users) on the left side of the drawing area. For a change this time, you’ll use a couple 
of shortcut methods built into AutoCAD: the Line command’s keyboard shortcut and the Direct 
Distance method for specifying distance and direction.
First, though, you’ll go back to the previous view of your drawing and arrange some more 
room to work. Follow these steps:
	
1.	 Return to your previous view, shown in Figure 3.8. A quick way to do this is to type 
Z↵P↵, or if you are returning to the file after closing it, type Z↵A↵ or use the Zoom All 
option. Your view returns to the one you had before the last Zoom command.

Result
With the Extend option, objects will trim even if the trimmed 
object doesn't actually intersect with the object to be trimmed.
With the UCS option, objects in
3D space will trim on a plane
perpendicular to the current UCS...
but when viewed in 3D or 
in another UCS, may appear 
to be trimmed incorrectly.
With the View option, objects
in 3D space will trim according
to your point of view...
but when they are viewed
in plan, they may appear
to be trimmed incorrectly.

96  | CHAPTER 3  Setting Up and Using the Drafting Tools    
	
2.	 Type L↵, and then enter 9,10↵ to start the line at the 0′-9″,0′-10″coordinate. Metric users 
should enter 24,27↵ for the coordinate 24.0000,27.0000.
	
3.	 Place your cursor to the right of the last point selected so that the rubber-banding line 
is pointing directly to the right, and type 2′8″. Then press ↵ for the first side of the tub. 
Metric users should enter 81↵.
	
4.	 Point the rubber-banding line up toward the top of the screen and type 5′. Then press ↵ 
for the next side. Metric users should enter 152↵.
	
5.	 Point the rubber-banding line directly to the left of the last point and type 2′8″ (81 for 
metric users). Then press ↵ for the next side.
	
6.	 Type C↵ to close the rectangle and exit the Line command.
Instead of pressing ↵ during the Direct Distance method, you can press the spacebar, or you 
can right-click and choose Enter from the context menu.
Now you have the outline of the tub. Notice that you don’t have to enter the at sign (@) or 
angle specification. Instead, you use the Direct Distance method to specify direction and dis-
tance. You can use this method for drawing lines or moving and copying objects at right angles. 
The Direct Distance method is less effective if you want to specify exact angles other than right 
angles.

using the Zoom 
Previous tool. You can 
also obtain this view 
by using the Zoom All 
tool from the Zoom 
flyout.
Be Careful with Hyphens
When you enter feet and inches in the Command window, you must avoid hyphens or spaces. 
Thus, 2 feet 8 inches is typed as 2′8″. But be aware that hyphens are allowed when using the Direct 
Distance method.

Planning and Laying Out a Drawing |  97  
The keyboard shortcuts for some of the tools or commands used in this chapter are CO 
(Copy), E (Erase), EL (Ellipse), F (Fillet), MI (Mirror), O (Offset), and TR (Trim). Remember that 
you can enter keyboard shortcuts and invoke commands only when Type a Command is visible 
in the Command window.
Making a Preliminary Sketch
In this section, you’ll see how planning ahead will make your use of AutoCAD more efficient. 
When drawing a complex object, you’ll often have to do some layout before you do the actual 
drawing. For those of you who have done manual drafting, this is similar to drawing an accu-
rate pencil sketch using construction lines that you later trace over to produce a finished draw-
ing. The advantage of doing this in AutoCAD is that your drawing doesn’t lose any accuracy 
between the sketch and the final product. Also, AutoCAD enables you to use the geometry of 
your sketch to aid in drawing. While you’re planning your drawing, think about what you want 
to draw and then decide which drawing elements will help you create that object.
You’ll use the Offset command to establish reference lines to help you draw the inside of the 
tub. This is where the osnap overrides are useful. (See the sidebar “The Osnap Options” later in 
this chapter.)
You can use the Offset tool on the Home tab’s Modify panel to make parallel copies of a set 
of objects, such as the lines forming the outside of your tub. Offset is different from the Copy 
command; although Offset allows only one object to be copied at a time, it can remember the 
distance you specify. The Offset option doesn’t work with all types of objects. Only lines, arcs, 
circles, ellipses, splines, and 2D polylines can be offset.
Standard lines are best suited for the layout of the bathtub in this situation. In Chapter 6,  
“Editing and Reusing Data to Work Efficiently,” you’ll learn about two other objects, 
construction lines and rays, which are specifically designed to help you lay out a drawing.  
In this exercise, you’ll use standard lines:
	
1.	 Click the Offset tool in the Home tab’s Modify panel, or type O↵.
	
2.	 At the Specify offset distance or [Through/Erase/Layer] <Through>: prompt, 
enter 3↵. This specifies the distance of 3″ as the offset distance. Metric users should enter 
7 for 7 cm, which is roughly equivalent to 3″.
	
3.	 At the Select object to offset or [Exit/Undo] <Exit>: prompt, click the bottom 
line of the rectangle you just drew. Remember that you can click and drag the wheel of 
your mouse to pan your view while in the middle of a command if needed.
	
4.	 At the Specify point on side to offset or [Exit/Multiple/Undo] <Exit>: 
prompt, pick a point inside the rectangle. A copy of the line appears. You don’t have to 
be exact about where you pick the side to offset; AutoCAD only wants to know on which 
side of the line you want to make the offset copy.
	
5.	 The prompt Select object to offset or [Exit/Undo] <Exit>: appears again. Click 
another side to offset. Then click again on a point inside the rectangle.
	
6.	 Continue to offset the other two sides. Then offset these four new lines inside the rect-
angle toward the center. You’ll have a drawing that looks like Figure 3.9.

98  | CHAPTER 3  Setting Up and Using the Drafting Tools    
	
7.	 When you’re done, exit the Offset command by pressing ↵.
Using the Layout
In step 4, you may have noticed that a “preview” line appears showing you where the offset line 
will appear should you select that point. This aids you in determining where to select points 
while using the Offset command.
Now you’ll begin to draw the inside of the tub, starting with the narrow end. You’ll use your 
offset lines as references to construct the arcs that make up the tub. Also in this exercise, you’ll 
set up some of the osnap options to be available automatically whenever AutoCAD expects a 
point selection. Here are the steps:
	
1.	 Right-click the Object Snap tool in the status bar, and select Settings from the context 
menu. You can also type OS↵.
	
2.	 Click the Clear All button to turn off any options that may be selected.
Look at the graphic symbols next to each of the osnap options in the Object Snap tab. 
These are the osnap markers that appear in your drawing as you select osnap points. 
Each osnap option has its own marker symbol. As you use the osnaps, you’ll become 
more familiar with how they work.
	
3.	 Click the Endpoint, Midpoint, and Intersection check boxes so that a check mark appears 
in each box, and make sure that the Object Snap On option is selected. Click OK (see 
Figure 3.10).
You’ve just set up the Endpoint, Midpoint, and Intersection osnaps to be on by default. This 
is called a running osnap; AutoCAD automatically selects the nearest osnap point without your 
intervention. Now let’s see how a running osnap works:

Midpoint osnap marker appears at the midpoint of the line, click the left mouse button.
	
5.	 Use the Intersection osnap marker to locate and select the intersection of the two lines at 
the upper-left side of the bathtub.
The top image in Figure 3.12 shows the sequence we just described.
If you have several running osnap modes on (Endpoint, Midpoint, and Intersection, for 
example), pressing the Tab key cycles through those osnap points on the object. This feature can 
be especially useful in a crowded area of a drawing.

Adjusting the AutoSnap Feature
When you click the Options button in the Object Snap tab of the Drafting Settings dialog box, 
you’ll see the Drafting tab of the Options dialog box. This tab offers a set of options pertaining 
to the AutoSnap™ feature. AutoSnap looks at the location of your cursor during osnap selections 
and locates the osnap point nearest your cursor. AutoSnap then displays a graphic called a marker 
showing you the osnap point it has found. If it’s the one you want, left-click to select it.
The AutoSnap settings enable you to control various features:
Marker    Turns the graphic markers on or off.
Magnet    Causes the cursor to jump to inferred osnap points.
Display AutoSnap Tooltip    Turns the AutoSnap tool tip on or off.
Display AutoSnap Aperture Box    Turns the old-style Osnap cursor box on or off.
Colors    Controls the color of the AutoSnap marker. This option opens the Drawing Window 
Colors dialog box, which lets you select a color for your 2D and 3D AutoSnap markers.
AutoSnap Marker Size    Controls the size of the graphic marker.

Objective
Next, you’ll draw an arc for the left side of the tub:
	
1.	 Click the Arc tool in the Draw panel again.
	
2.	 Type @↵ to select the last point you picked as the start of the next arc.
It’s easy for new users to select points inadvertently. If you accidentally selected addi-
tional points after the last exercise and prior to step 1, you may not get the results 
described here. If this happens, issue the Arc command again; then, use the Endpoint 
osnap and select the endpoint of the last arc.
	
3.	 Type E↵ or select the End option from the command line to tell AutoCAD that you want 
to specify the other end of the arc instead of the next point. You can also right-click any-
where in the drawing area and choose End from the context menu.
	
4.	 At the Specify end point of arc: prompt, use the Intersection osnap to pick the inter-
section of the two lines in the lower-left corner of the tub. The following image shows a 
close-up view.
	
5.	 Type D↵ or select the Direction option in the command line. You can also right-click 
anywhere in the drawing area and then choose Direction from the context menu. The arc 
drags, along with a rubber-banding line from the starting point of the arc, as you move 
the cursor.

102  | CHAPTER 3  Setting Up and Using the Drafting Tools    
	
6.	 Move the cursor to the left of the dragging arc until it touches the middle line on the left 
side of the tub. Pick that line as shown in the middle image in Figure 3.12. You may need 
to turn off osnaps temporarily to do this by using a Shift+right-click and selecting None.
In step 5 of the preceding exercise, the rubber-banding line indicates the direction of the arc. 
Be sure that Ortho mode is off because Ortho mode forces the rubber-banding line and the arc 
in a direction you don’t want. Check the status bar; if the Ortho Mode tool is blue (on), press F8 
or click the Ortho Mode tool to turn off Ortho mode.
Now you’ll draw the bottom of the tub:
	
1.	 Click the Arc tool in the Draw panel again. You can also press ↵ to repeat the last 
command.
	
2.	 Using the Endpoint osnap marker, pick the endpoint of the bottom of the arc just drawn.
	
3.	 Using the Midpoint osnap marker, pick the middle horizontal line at the bottom of the 
tub.
	
4.	 Pick the intersection of the two lines in the lower-right corner of the tub. The following 
image shows a close-up view.
Next, create the right side of the tub by mirroring the left side:
	
1.	 Click the Mirror tool on the Home tab’s Modify panel. You can also enter MI↵ at the 
Command prompt.
	
2.	 At the Select objects: prompt, pick the long arc on the left side of the tub to highlight 
the arc. Press ↵ to indicate that you’ve finished your selection.
	
3.	 At the Specify first point of mirror line: prompt, pick the midpoint of the top 
horizontal line. By now, you should know how to use the automatic osnap modes that 
you set up earlier.
	
4.	 At the Specify second point of mirror line: prompt, use Polar Tracking mode to 
pick a point directly below the last point selected.
	
5.	 At the Erase source objects? [Yes/No] <N>: prompt, press ↵ to accept the Mirror 
command’s default Erase source objects option (No) and exit the Mirror command. 
A mirror image of the arc you picked appears on the right side of the tub. Your drawing 
should look like Figure 3.13.
In this exercise, you were able to use osnaps in Running Osnap mode. You’ll find that you’ll 
use osnaps constantly as you create your drawings. For this reason, you may want running 
osnaps on all of the time. Even so, at times, running osnaps can get in the way. For example, 
they may be a nuisance in a crowded drawing when you want to use a zoom window. The 
osnaps can cause you to select an inappropriate window area by automatically selecting osnap 
points.

Planning and Laying Out a Drawing |  103  
Fortunately, you can toggle Running Osnaps on and off easily by clicking the Object Snap 
tool in the status bar. If you don’t have any running osnaps set, right-click the Object Snap tool 
and select Settings from the context menu that appears.
Erasing the Layout Lines
Next, you’ll erase the layout lines you created using the Offset command. But this time, you’ll 
try selecting the lines before issuing the Erase command.
Follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click each internal layout line individually.
If you have problems selecting just the lines, try using a selection window to select single 
lines. (Remember, a window selects only objects that are completely within it.)
	
2.	 After all of the layout lines are highlighted, enter E↵ to use the keyboard shortcut for the 
Erase command, or right-click and choose Erase from the context menu. Your drawing 
will look like Figure 3.14.
If you right-clicked to use the context menu in step 2, you’ll notice that you have several 
options besides Erase. You can move, copy, scale, and rotate the objects that you selected. 
These options are similar to the tools on the Home tab’s Modify panel in the way they act. 
But be aware that they act somewhat differently from the hot-grip options described in 
Chapter 2.

The Osnap Options
Earlier, you made several of the osnap settings automatic so that they’re available without having 
to select them from the Osnap context menu. Another way to invoke the osnap options is to type 
their keyboard equivalents while selecting points or to Shift+right-click and type the capital letter 
shown in the Osnap context menu for the option you want to use.
The following is a summary (in alphabetic order) of all the available osnap options, including their 
command-line keyboard shortcuts. You can type the command-line keyboard shortcuts to bypass 
the context menu. You’ve already used many of these options in this chapter and in the previous 
one. Pay special attention to those options that you haven’t yet used in the exercises but may find 
useful to your style of work. The full name of each option is followed by its keyboard shortcut name 
in brackets. To use these options, you can enter either the full name or the abbreviation at any 
point prompt. You can also select these options from the context menu you open by Shift+right-
clicking the mouse.
Apparent Intersection [APP]    Selects the apparent intersection of two objects. This is 
useful when you want to select the intersection of two objects that don’t actually intersect. 
You’ll be prompted to select the two objects.
Center [CEN]    Selects the center of an arc, circle, or closed polyline. For irregularly shaped 
closed polylines where the center is not obvious, you can hover over the polyline and a center 
marker will appear after a second or two.
Endpoint [ENDP or END]    Selects the endpoints of lines, polylines, arcs, curves, and 3D 
Face vertices.

Extension [EXT]    Selects a point that is aligned with an imagined extension of a line. For 
example, you can pick a point in space that is aligned with an existing line but that isn’t on 
that line. To use that point, type ext↵ during point selection or select Extension from the 
Osnap context menu. Then move the cursor to the line whose extension you want to use and 
hold it there until you see a small, cross-shaped marker on the line. The cursor also displays 
a tool tip with the word extension, letting you know that the Extension osnap is active.
From [FRO]    Selects a point relative to a picked point. For example, you can select a point 
that is 2 units to the left and 4 units above a circle’s center. This option is usually used in 
conjunction with another osnap option, such as From Endpoint or From Midpoint.
Insert [INS]    Selects the insertion point of text, blocks, Xrefs, and overlays.
Intersection [INT]    Selects the intersection of objects.
Mid Between 2 Points [M2P]    Selects a point that is midway between two other points.
Midpoint [MID]    Selects the midpoint of a line or an arc. In the case of a polyline, it selects 
the midpoint of the polyline segment.
Nearest [NEA]    Selects a point on an object nearest the pick point.
Node [NOD]    Selects a point object.
None [NON]    Temporarily turns off Running Osnaps for a single point selection.
Parallel [PAR]    Lets you draw a line segment that is parallel to another existing line seg-
ment. To use this option, type par↵ during point selection or select Parallel from the Osnap 
context menu. Then move the cursor to the line to that you want to be parallel and hold it 
there until you see a small cross-shaped marker on the line. The cursor also displays a tool 
tip with the word parallel, letting you know that the Parallel osnap is active.
Perpendicular [PER]    Selects a position on an object that is perpendicular to the last point 
selected.
Point Filters    Not really object snaps, but point-selection options that let you filter x-, y-, or 
z-coordinate values from a selected point. (See Chapter 20, “Creating 3D Drawings,” for more 
on point filters.)
Quadrant [QUA]    Selects the nearest cardinal (north, south, east, or west) point on an arc 
or a circle.
Quick [QUI]    Selects the nearest point, used with other osnap modes.
Tangent [TAN]    Selects a point on an arc or a circle that represents the tangent from the 
last point selected.
Temporary Track Point [TT]    Provides an alternate method for using the Object Snap 
Tracking feature described later in this chapter.
3D Osnap    Offers additional osnaps for 3D modeling. With these osnap options, you can 
select a vector that is perpendicular to a surface or find the midpoint of an edge of a 3D object.
Sometimes you’ll want one or more of these osnap options available as the default selection. Remember 
that you can set Running Osnaps to be on at all times. Type DS, and then click the Object Snap tab. You 
can also right-click the Object Snap tool in the status bar and choose Settings from the context menu 
to open the Drafting Settings dialog box, or just select osnap options directly from the context menu.

106  | CHAPTER 3  Setting Up and Using the Drafting Tools    
If you need more control over the selection of objects, you’ll find the Add/Remove 
Selection Mode setting useful. This setting lets you deselect a set of objects within a set of 
objects you’ve already selected. While in Object Selection mode, enter R↵, and then proceed 
to use a window or other selection tool to remove objects from the selection set. Enter A↵ to 
continue to add options to the selection set. Or, if you need to deselect only a single object, 
Shift+click it.
Putting on the Finishing Touches
The inside of the tub still has some sharp corners. To round out these corners, you can use the 
versatile Fillet tool on the Home tab’s Modify panel. Fillet enables you to join lines and arcs end 
to end, and it can add a radius where they join so there is a smooth transition from arc to arc or 
line to line. Fillet can join two lines that don’t intersect, and it can trim two crossing lines back to 
their point of intersection.
Another tool, called Chamfer, performs a similar function, but instead of joining lines with an 
arc, Chamfer joins lines with another line segment. Since they perform similar functions, Fillet 
and Chamfer occupy the same location on the Modify panel. If you don’t see the Fillet tool, click 
the Chamfer flyout and select Fillet.
Continue with your tutorial by following these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Fillet tool on the Home tab’s Modify panel, or type F↵.
	
2.	 At the prompt
Current settings: Mode = TRIM, Radius = 0′-0 1/2″
Select first object or [Undo/Polyline/Radius/Trim/Multiple]:
enter R↵, or right-click and choose Radius from the context menu. You can also click 
Radius from the command line.
	
3.	 At the Specify fillet radius <0′-0″>: prompt, enter 4↵. This tells AutoCAD that you 
want a 4″ radius for your fillet. Metric users should enter 10↵.
	
4.	 Pick two adjacent arcs. The fillet arc joins the two larger arcs.
	
5.	 Press ↵ again, and fillet another corner. Repeat until all four corners are filleted. Your 
drawing should look like Figure 3.15.

Objective

Planning and Laying Out a Drawing |  107  
You may have noticed that the Fillet tool offers a preview of the resulting arc. After you click 
the first of the two lines to be filleted, you can hover over the second line to see a temporary arc 
appear where the fillet will occur. This feature can help you determine whether the radius of 
your fillet is really the radius you want.
As you will see in later chapters, the Fillet tool is also used to join two lines quickly end to 
end to form a corner. You can accomplish this, even if you have the Fillet tool set to join two 
lines with an arc, by holding down the Shift key while clicking the second line.
Aligning Objects by Using Object Snap Tracking
You saw how to use lines to construct an object such as the bathtub. In many situations, using 
these construction lines is the most efficient way to draw, but they can also be a bit cumbersome. 
AutoCAD offers another tool that helps you align locations in your drawing to existing objects 
without having to draw intermediate construction lines. The tool is called Object Snap Tracking, 
or Osnap Tracking.
Osnap Tracking is like an extension of object snaps that enables you to align a point to the 
geometry of an object instead of just selecting a point on an object. For example, with Osnap 
Tracking, you can select a point that is exactly at the center of a rectangle.
In the following exercises, you’ll draw a plan view of a bathroom sink as an introduction to 
the Osnap Tracking feature. This drawing will be used as a symbol in later chapters.
Getting Set Up
First, as a review, you’ll open a new file and use the tools with which you are already familiar to

4.	 In the Drawing Units dialog box, select Architectural from the Length type drop-down 
list and then click OK. Metric users should leave the Length type as Decimal, but should 
select Centimeters from the Insert Scale drop-down list.
	
5.	 Enter LIMITS↵, and then press ↵ to accept the default lower-left corner coordinates.
	
6.	 For the upper-right corner of the limits, enter 48,26↵. Metric users should enter 122,92↵.
	
7.	 Type Z↵A↵ to display the overall area of the drawing set by the limits.
	
8.	 Choose Save As from the Application menu and save the file under the name Sink.
If you find that you use the same drawing setup over and over, you can create tem-
plate files that are already set up to your own way of working. Templates are discussed in 
Chapter 6.
Drawing the Sink
You’re ready to draw the sink. First, you’ll draw the sink countertop. Then, you’ll make sure that 
Running Osnaps and Osnap Tracking are turned on. Finally, you’ll draw the bowl of the sink.
Here are the steps for drawing the outline of the sink countertop:
	
1.	 If the grid is on, click the Grid Display tool in the status bar to turn it off.
	
2.	 Click the Rectangle tool in the Draw panel, or type REC↵.
	
3.	 At the prompt
Specify first corner point or [Chamfer/Elevation/Fillet/Thickness/Width]:
enter 0,0↵. This places one corner of the rectangle in the origin of the drawing.
	
4.	 At the Specify other corner point or [Area/Dimensions/Rotation]: prompt, 
enter @2′4,1′6↵ to place the other corner of the rectangle. Metric users should enter 
@71,46↵. This makes the rectangle 2′-4″ wide and 1′-6″ deep, or 71 cm wide and 46 
cm deep for metric users. The rectangle appears in the lower half of the drawing 
area.
	
5.	 Choose Zoom Extents from the Zoom flyout on the Navigation bar, or type Z↵E↵. This 
enlarges the view of the sink outline so it fits in the drawing area.
	
6.	 Use the Zoom Realtime tool in the Zoom flyout to adjust your view so it looks similar to 
the one shown in Figure 3.16. You can also enter Z↵↵ to start the real-time zoom feature 
or just use your scroll wheel.

Planning and Laying Out a Drawing |  109  
When you draw the bowl of the sink, an ellipse will represent the bowl. You want to place the 
center of the ellipse at the center of the rectangle that you’ve just drawn. To do this, you’ll use 
the midpoint of two adjoining sides of the rectangle as alignment locations. This is where the 
Osnap Tracking tool will be useful.
You need to make sure that the Object Snap tool is turned on and that the Midpoint Object Snap 
option is also turned on. Then you’ll make sure that Osnap Tracking is turned on. Use these steps:
	
1.	 Right-click the Object Snap tool in the status bar and choose Settings from the context 
menu to open the Drafting Settings dialog box at the Object Snap tab (see Figure 3.17).

2.	 Make sure that the Midpoint check box in the Object Snap Modes group is selected.
	
3.	 Also make sure that Object Snap On and Object Snap Tracking On are both selected. 
Click OK. You’ll notice that the Object Snap and Object Snap Tracking buttons in the 
status bar are now in the On position.
Finally, you’re ready to draw the ellipse:
	
1.	 Click the Center Ellipse tool in the Draw panel, or enter EL↵ C↵.
	
2.	 Move your cursor to the top, horizontal edge of the rectangle until you see the Midpoint 
tool tip.
	
3.	 Move the cursor directly over the Midpoint Osnap marker. Without clicking, hold the 
cursor there for a second until you see a small cross appear. Look carefully because the 
cross is small. This is the Object Snap Tracking marker (see Figure 3.18).
Figure 3.18
The Object Snap 
Tracking marker
You can alternately insert and remove the Object Snap Tracking marker by passing the 
cursor over the osnap marker.
	
4.	 As you move the cursor downward, a dotted line appears, emanating from the midpoint 
of the horizontal line. The cursor also shows a small X following the dotted line as you 
move it (see Figure 3.19).
	
5.	 Move the cursor to the midpoint of the left vertical side of the rectangle. Don’t click, 
but hold it there for a second until you see the small cross. Now, as you move the cur-
sor away, a horizontal dotted line appears with an X following the cursor (see  
Figure 3.20).

ously and a small X appears at their intersection (see Figure 3.21).

112  | CHAPTER 3  Setting Up and Using the Drafting Tools    
	
7.	 With the two dotted lines crossing and the X at their intersection, click the left mouse 
button to select the exact center of the rectangle.
	
8.	 Point the cursor to the right, and enter 8↵ to make the width of the bowl 16″. Metric users 
should enter 20↵ for a bowl 40 cm wide.
	
9.	 Point the cursor downward, and enter 6↵ to make the length of the bowl 12″. Metric 
users should enter 15↵ for a bowl with a length of 30 cm. The basic symbol for the sink is 
complete (see Figure 3.22).

10.	 Click Save in the Quick Access toolbar and close the current file. You can also save and 
close the Bath file and exit AutoCAD.
In this exercise, you saw how Object Snap Tracking enables you to align two locations to 
select a point in space. Although you used only the Midpoint osnap setting in this exercise, you 
aren’t limited to one osnap setting. You can use as many as you need to select the appropriate 
geometry. You can also use as many alignment points as you need, although in this exercise you 
used only two. If you like, erase the ellipse and repeat this exercise until you get the hang of 
using the Object Snap Tracking feature.
As with all of the other tools in the status bar, you can turn Object Snap Tracking on or off by 
clicking the Object Snap Tracking tool.
Using the AutoCAD Modes as Drafting Tools
Before you finish this chapter, you’ll want to know about a few of the other drafting tools that 
are common to drawing programs. These tools may be compared to a background grid (Grid 
mode) and the ability to “snap” to grid points (Snap mode). These drawing modes can be indis-
pensable tools under certain conditions. Their use is fairly straightforward. You can experiment 
with them on your own using the information in the following sections.
Using Grid Mode as a Background Grid
Using Grid mode is like having a grid under your drawing to help you with layout, as shown 
in Figure 3.23. In this figure, the grids are set to a 1′ spacing with major grid lines at 5′. The grid 
also shows, in darker lines, the x- and y-axes that start at the origin of the drawing.

Using Object Snap Tracking and Polar Tracking Together
In addition to selecting as many tracking points as you need, you can use different angles besides 
the basic orthogonal angles of 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°. For example, you can have AutoCAD locate a 
point that is aligned vertically to the top edge of the sink and at a 45° angle from a corner.
continues

114  | CHAPTER 3  Setting Up and Using the Drafting Tools    
This can be accomplished by using the settings in the Polar Tracking tab of the Drafting Settings 
dialog box. (See the section “Setting the Polar Tracking Angle” earlier in this chapter.) If you set 
the increment angle to 45° and turn on the Track Using All Polar Angle Settings option, you’ll 
be able to use 45° in addition to the orthogonal directions. You’ll see firsthand how this works 
in Chapter 6.
Grids will not print in your final output. They are a visual aid to help you gauge distances. 
In AutoCAD, Grid mode can also let you see the limits of your drawing because the grid can be 
set to display only within the limits setting of your drawing. Grid mode can help you visually 
determine the distances with which you’re working in any given view. In this section, you’ll 
learn how to control the grid’s appearance. The F7 key toggles Grid mode on and off. You can 
also click the Grid Display tool in the status bar.
To set up the grid spacing, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Right-click the Snap Mode tool in the status bar and select Snap Settings (or type DS↵) to 
open the Drafting Settings dialog box showing all of the mode settings.
	
2.	 Click the Snap And Grid tab if it isn’t already selected. You will see six groups: Snap 
Spacing, Grid Style, Grid Spacing, Polar Spacing, Grid Behavior, and Snap Type. Notice 
that the Grid X Spacing text box contains a value of 1/2″, or 0.5. Metric users see a value of 
10 (see Figure 3.24).
continued

Using the AutoCAD Modes as Drafting Tools |  115  
	
3.	 Enter the grid spacing you want in the Grid X Spacing and Grid Y Spacing input boxes.
	
4.	 Click the Grid On check box to make the grid visible. Notice the F7 in parentheses: This 
tells you that the F7 function key also controls the Grid On/Off function. Click OK to dis-
miss the Drafting Settings dialog box and save your settings.
If you prefer, you can use the Gridunit system variable to set the grid spacing. Enter 
Gridunit↵, and at the Enter new value for GRIDUNIT <0′-0 1/2″,0′-0 1/2″>: prompt, enter 
a grid spacing in x-,y-coordinates. You must enter the Gridunit value as an x-,y-coordinate.
There are several other grid options in the Drafting Settings dialog box. The Grid Style group 
lets you display the grid as a series of dots instead of the graph paper–style lines. Place a check 
mark by the view name where you want to display dots instead of grid lines.
In the Grid Behavior group, the Display Grid Beyond Limits check box lets you determine 
whether the grid displays outside the limits of the drawing.
The Adaptive Grid option adjusts the grid spacing depending on how much of the view is 
displayed. If you zoom out to a point where the grid becomes too dense for you to view the 
drawing, the grid automatically increases its interval. The Major Line Every option in the Grid 
Spacing group lets you control how frequently the major grid lines (lines that appear darker 
than the others) appear. The Display Grid Beyond Limits option does what it says—it lets the 
grid display beyond the drawing limits. Turn this option off to limit the grid display to the 
drawing limits. The Follow Dynamic UCS option causes the grid to align with the dynamic 
UCS. See Chapter 20 for more on the Dynamic UCS.
Figure 3.24

tab of the Drafting 
Settings dialog box

116  | CHAPTER 3  Setting Up and Using the Drafting Tools    
Once you’ve set up your grid, you can press F7 or click Grid Display in the status bar to turn 
the grid on and off. (You can also hold down the Ctrl key and press G.)
Using Snap Modes
Snap mode forces the cursor to move in steps of a specific distance. Snap mode is useful when 
you want to select points on the screen at a fixed interval. Two Snap mode options are available 
in the Snap And Grid tab’s Snap type group: Grid Snap and Polar Snap. The F9 key toggles Grid 
Snap mode on and off, or you can click the Snap tool in the status bar. Follow these steps to 
access Snap mode:
	
1.	 Right-click the Snap Mode tool in the status bar and select Settings (or type DS↵) to open 
the Drafting Settings dialog box.
	
2.	 In the Snap Spacing group of the dialog box, double-click the Snap X Spacing text box 
and enter a value for your snap spacing. Then press the Tab key to move to the next 
option. AutoCAD assumes that you want the X and Y snap spacing to be the same unless 
you specifically ask for a different Y setting. If you want the X snap spacing to be differ-
ent from the Y, uncheck the Equal X and Y spacing option.
	
3.	 You can click the Snap On check box to turn on Snap mode from this dialog box.
	
4.	 Click OK to save your settings and close the dialog box.
With Snap mode on, the cursor seems to move in steps rather than in a smooth motion. The 
Snap Mode tool in the status bar appears blue, indicating that Snap mode is on. Press F9 or  
click Snap Mode in the status bar (you can also hold down the Ctrl key and press B) to turn  
Snap mode on or off.
Note that you can use the Snapunit system variable to set the snap spacing. Enter 
Snapunit↵. Then, at the Enter new value for SNAPUNIT <0′0″,0′0″>: prompt, enter a snap 
distance value as an x-,y-coordinate.
In the Snap Type group, you can change the snap and grid configuration to aid in creating 2D 
isometric drawings by clicking the Isometric Snap radio button. The PolarSnap option enables 
you to set a snap distance for the PolarSnap feature. When you click the PolarSnap radio button, 
the Polar Distance option at the middle left of the dialog box changes from gray to black and 
white to allow you to enter a Polar Snap distance.
You can also set up the grid to follow the snap spacing automatically. To do this, set Grid X 
Spacing and Grid Y Spacing to 0.

Controlling the Color of Grid Lines
If you find that the colors of the grid lines are too strong and they obscure your drawing, you can 
set them so that they blend into the background. To do this, you use the Options dialog box (see 
Appendix B, “Installing and Setting Up AutoCAD,” for more on this dialog box):
	1.	 Right-click and select Options, or type Options↵.
	2.	 Select the Display tab.
	3.	 Click the Colors button in the Window Elements group.

The Bottom Line
Set up a work area.    A blank AutoCAD drawing offers few clues about the size of the area 
with which you’re working, but you can get a rough idea of the area shown in the AutoCAD 
window.
Master It    Name two ways to set up the area of your work.
Explore the drawing process.    To use AutoCAD effectively, you’ll want to know how the 
different tools work together to achieve an effect. The drawing process often involves many

Master It    Name the tool that causes the cursor to point in an exact horizontal or vertical 
direction.
Plan and lay out a drawing.    If you’ve ever had to draw a precise sketch with just a pencil 
and pad, you’ve probably used a set of lightly drawn guidelines to lay out your drawing first. 
You do the same thing in AutoCAD, but instead of lightly drawn guidelines, you can use any 
object you want. In AutoCAD, objects are easily modified or deleted, so you don’t have to be 
as careful when adding guidelines.

Chapter  4
Organizing Objects with  
Blocks and Groups 
Drawing the tub, toilet, and sink in Chapter 3, “Setting Up and Using the Drafting Tools,” 
may have taken what seemed to you an inordinate amount of time. As you continue to use the 
AutoCAD® 2017 software, however, you’ll learn to draw objects more quickly. You’ll also need to 
draw fewer of them because you can save drawings as symbols and then use those symbols like 
rubber stamps, duplicating drawings instantaneously wherever they’re needed. This saves a lot 
of time when you’re composing drawings.
To make effective use of AutoCAD, begin a symbol library of drawings you use frequently. A 
mechanical designer might have a library of symbols for fasteners, cams, valves, or even com-
plete assemblies used in their application. An electrical engineer might have a symbol library of 
capacitors, resistors, switches, and the like. A circuit designer will have yet another unique set of 
frequently used symbols.
In Chapter 3, you drew three objects that architects often use—a bathtub, a toilet, and a sink. 
In this chapter, you’ll see how to create symbols from those drawings.
In this chapter, you will learn to
◆
◆
Create and insert a symbol
◆
◆
Modify a block
◆
◆
Understand the annotation scale
◆
◆
Group objects
Creating and Using a Symbol
To save a drawing as a symbol, you use the tools in the Home tab’s Block panel or the Insert 
tab’s Block Definition panel. In word processors, the term block refers to a group of words or 
sentences selected for moving, saving, or deleting. You can copy a block of text elsewhere within 
the same file, to other files, or to a separate location on a server or USB storage device for future 
use. AutoCAD uses blocks in a similar fashion. In a file, you can turn parts of your drawing into 
blocks that can be saved and recalled at any time. You can also use entire existing files as blocks.
You’ll start by opening the file you worked on in the previous chapter and selecting the 
objects that will become a block:
	
1.	 Start AutoCAD, and open the existing Bath file. Use the one you created in Chapter 3, 
or open the 04-bath.dwg sample file from this book’s web page (www.sybex.com/go/­
masteringautocad2017). Metric users can use the 04-bath-metric.dwg file. The draw-
ing appears just as you left it in the last session.

120  | CHAPTER 4  Organizing Objects with Blocks and Groups    
	
2.	 In the Home tab’s Block panel, click the Create tool or type B↵, the keyboard shortcut for 
the Create tool. This opens the Block Definition dialog box (see Figure 4.1).
	
3.	 In the Name text box, type Toilet.
Figure 4.1
The Block Definition 
dialog box
	
4.	 In the Base Point group, click the Pick Point button. This option enables you to select a 
base point for the block by using your cursor. (The insertion base point of a block is a point 
of reference on the block that is used like a grip.) When you’ve selected this option, the 
Block Definition dialog box temporarily closes.
Notice that the Block Definition dialog box gives you the option to specify the x-, y-, and 
z-coordinates for the base point instead of selecting a point.
	
5.	 Using the Midpoint osnap, pick the midpoint of the back of the toilet as the base point. 
Remember that you learned how to set up running osnaps in Chapter 3; all you need 
to do is point to the midpoint of a line to display the Midpoint Osnap marker and then 
left-click.
After you’ve selected a point, the Block Definition dialog box reappears. Notice that the 
X, Y, and Z values in the Base Point group now display the coordinates of the point you 
picked. For two-dimensional drawings, the z-coordinate should remain at 0.
Next, you need to select the objects that you want as part of the block.
	
6.	 Click the Select Objects button in the Objects group. Once again, the dialog box momen-
tarily closes. You now see the familiar Select objects: prompt in the Command 

Creating and Using a Symbol |  121  
window, and the cursor becomes a Pickbox cursor. Click a point below and to the left 
of the toilet. Then use a selection window to select the entire toilet. The toilet is now 
highlighted.
Make sure that you use the Select Objects option in the Block Definition dialog box to 
select the objects that you want to turn into a block. AutoCAD lets you create a block that 
contains no objects. If you try to proceed without selecting objects, you’ll get a warning 
message. This can cause confusion and frustration, even for an experienced user.
	
7.	 Press ↵ to confirm your selection. The Block Definition dialog box opens again.
	
8.	 Select Inches from the Block Unit drop-down list. Metric users should select Centimeters.
	
9.	 Click the Description list box, and enter Standard Toilet.
	
10.	 Make sure the Retain radio button in the Objects group is selected, and then click OK. 
The toilet drawing is now a block with the name Toilet.
	
11.	 Repeat the blocking process for the tub, but this time use the upper-left corner of the tub 
as the insertion base point and give the block the name Tub. Enter Standard Tub for the 
description.
You can press ↵ or right-click and choose Repeat BLOCK from the context menu to start 
the Create Block tool.
When you turn an object into a block, it’s stored in the drawing file, ready to be recalled at any 
time. The block remains part of the drawing file even when you end the editing session. When you 
open the file again, the block is available for your use. In addition, you can access blocks from other 
drawings by using the AutoCAD DesignCenter™ and the tool palettes. You’ll learn more about the 
DesignCenter and the tool palettes in Chapter 25, “Managing and Sharing Your Drawings.”
A block acts like a single object, even though it’s made up of several objects. One unique 
characteristic of a block is that when you modify it, all instances of it are updated to reflect the 
modifications. For example, if you insert several copies of the toilet into a drawing and then later 
decide the toilet needs to be a different shape, you can edit the Toilet block, and all of the other 
copies of the toilet are updated automatically.
You can modify a block in a number of ways after it has been created. In this chapter, you’ll 
learn how to make simple changes to individual blocks by modifying the block’s properties. 
For more detailed changes, you’ll learn how to redefine a block after it has been created. Later, 
in Chapter 17, “Using Dynamic Blocks,” you’ll learn how to use the Block Editor to make more 
interactive blocks.
Understanding the Block Definition Dialog Box
The Block Definition dialog box offers several options that can help make using blocks easier. If 
you’re interested in these options, take a moment to review the Block Definition dialog box as 
you read the descriptions. If you prefer, you can continue with the tutorial and come back to this 
section later.
You’ve already seen how the Name option lets you enter a name for your block. AutoCAD 
doesn’t let you complete the block creation until you enter a name.
You’ve also seen how to select a base point for your block. The base point is like the grip of 
the block: It’s the reference point you use when you insert the block back into the drawing. In 

122  | CHAPTER 4  Organizing Objects with Blocks and Groups    
the exercise, you used the Pick Point option to indicate a base point, but you also have the option 
to enter x-, y-, and z-coordinates just below the Pick Point option. In most cases, however, you’ll 
want to use the Pick Point option to indicate a base point that is on or near the set of objects that 
you’re converting to a block.
The Objects group of the Block Definition dialog box lets you select the objects that make 
up the block. You use the Select Objects button to select visually the objects that you want to 
include in the block you’re creating. The QuickSelect button to the right of the Select Objects 
button lets you filter out objects based on their properties. You’ll learn more about QuickSelect 
in Chapter 14, “Advanced Editing and Organizing.” Once you select a set of objects for your 
block, you’ll see a thumbnail preview of the block’s contents near the top center of the Block 
Definition dialog box.
Other options in the Objects group and Settings group let you specify what to do with the objects 
you’re selecting for your block. Table 4.1 shows a list of those other options and what they mean.

After you’ve selected objects, the warning changes to tell you how many objects 
you’ve selected.
Behavior group
Annotative
Turns on the annotation scale feature for blocks. This feature lets you use a single 
block for different scale views of a drawing. With this feature turned on, AutoCAD 
can be set to adjust the size of the block to the appropriate scale for the viewport.

Creating and Using a Symbol |  123  
Option
Purpose
Match Block Orientation 
To Layout
With the Annotative option activated, this option is available. This option 
causes a block to appear always in its normal orientation regardless of the 
­orientation of the layout view.
Scale Uniformly
By default, blocks can have a different X, Y, or Z scale. This means that they can 
be stretched in any of the axes. You can lock the X, Y, and Z scales of the block by 
selecting this option. That way, the block will always be scaled uniformly and 
can’t be stretched in one axis.
Allow Exploding
By default, blocks can be exploded or reduced to their component objects. You 
can lock a block so that it can’t be exploded by turning off this option. You can 
always turn on this option later through the Properties palette if you decide 
that you need to explode a block.
Settings group
Block Unit
Lets you determine how the object is to be scaled when it’s inserted into the 
drawing using the DesignCenter feature discussed in Chapter 25. By default, 
this value is the same as the current drawing’s insert value.
Hyperlink
Lets you assign a link to a block. This option opens the Insert Hyperlink dialog 
box, where you can select a location or file for the link.
Description and Open In Block Editor
Description
Lets you include a brief description or keyword for the block. This option is 
helpful when you need to find a specific block in a set of drawings. You’ll learn 
more about searching for blocks later in this chapter and in Chapter 25.
Open In Block
If you turn on this option, the block is created and then opened in the Block 
Editor, described in Chapter 17.
Inserting a Symbol
You can recall the Tub and Toilet blocks at any time—as many times as you want. You’ll draw 
the interior walls of the bathroom first, and then you’ll insert the tub and toilet. Follow these 
steps to draw the walls:
	
1.	 Delete the original tub and toilet drawings. Click the Erase tool in the Modify Ribbon 
panel, and then enter All↵↵ to erase the entire visible contents of the drawing. (Doing so 
has no effect on the blocks you created previously.)
	
2.	 Draw a rectangle 7′-6″ by 5′-0″. Metric users should draw a 228 cm by 152 cm rectangle. 
Orient the rectangle so the long sides go from left to right and the lower-left corner is at 
coordinate 1′-10″,1′-10″ (or coordinate 56.0000,56.0000 for metric users).
If you use the Rectangle tool to draw the rectangle, make sure that you explode it by using 
the Explode command. This is important for later exercises. (See the section “Unblocking and 
Certiﬁcation

Now you’re ready to place your blocks. Start by placing the tub in the drawing. Although 
there is a fairly simple way to do this, you’ll use a resizable dialog box so that you become famil-
iar with some of the options available:
	
1.	 In the Block Ribbon panel, click the Insert tool. You’ll see a flyout with icons of the blocks 
you have just created. You could click the icon of the block you want to insert from this 
flyout, but in this exercise, you’ll look at the options available through the Insert dialog 
box. If you do not see the flyout with icons, type Galleryview↵1↵.
	
2.	 From the flyout, select More Options. Or instead of clicking the Insert tool, you can type 
I↵ to open the Insert dialog box (see Figure 4.3).

5.	 In the Insertion Point and Rotation groups, turn on the Specify On-Screen option. With 
this option turned on in the Insertion Point group, you’re asked to specify an insertion 
point using your cursor. The Specify On-Screen option in the Rotation group lets you 
specify the rotation angle of the block graphically as you insert it.
	
6.	 Click OK and you will see a preview image of the tub attached to the cursor. The upper-
left corner that you picked for the tub’s base point is now on the cursor intersection.
	
7.	 At the Specify insertion point or [Basepoint/Scale/X/Y/Z/Rotate]: prompt, 
pick the upper-left intersection of the room as your insertion point.
	
8.	 At the Specify rotation angle <0>: prompt, notice that you can rotate the block. 
This lets you visually specify a rotation angle for the block. You won’t use this feature at 
this time, so press ↵ to accept the default of 0. The tub should look like the one in the top 
image of Figure 4.4.

You’ve got the tub in place. Now place the Toilet block in the drawing:
	
1.	 Open the Insert dialog box again, but this time select Toilet in the Name drop-down list.
	
2.	 Clear the Specify On-Screen check box in the Rotation group.
	
3.	 Place the toilet at the midpoint of the line along the top of the rectangle representing the bath-
room wall, as shown in the bottom image in Figure 4.4. The toilet appears in the drawing.
You’ve just used two methods for inserting a block. When you used the Insert dialog box to 
place the Tub block, you saw a number of options that you could use to fine-tune the block while 
you insert it. Note that this dialog box can be enlarged by dragging one of its corners or sides.
Scaling and Rotating Blocks
When you insert the tub, you can see it rotate as you move the cursor. You can pick a point to 
fix the block in place, or you can enter a rotation value. This is the result of selecting the Specify 
On-Screen option in the Insert dialog box. You may find that you want the Rotation group’s 
Specify On-Screen option turned on most of the time so that you can adjust the rotation angle of 
the block while you’re placing it in the drawing.
The options in the Insert dialog box that you didn’t use are the Scale group options. These 
options let you scale the block to a different size. You can scale the block uniformly, or you can 
distort the block by individually changing its X, Y, or Z scale factor. With the Specify On-Screen 
option unchecked, you can enter specific values in the X, Y, and Z text boxes to stretch the block 
in any direction. If you turn on the Specify On-Screen option, you can visually adjust the X, Y, 
and Z scale factors in real time. Although these options aren’t used often, they can be useful in 
special situations when a block needs to be stretched one way or another to fit in a drawing.
You aren’t limited to scaling or rotating a block when it’s being inserted into a drawing. You 
can always use the Scale or Rotate tool or modify an inserted block’s properties to stretch it in 
one direction or another. The next exercise shows you how this is done:
	
1.	 Click the Toilet block to select it.
	
2.	 Right-click, and choose Properties from the context menu to open the Properties palette. 
Take a moment to study the Properties palette. Toward the bottom, under the Geometry 
heading, you see a set of labels that show Position and Scale. These labels may appear as 
Posi and Scal if the width of the palette is too narrow to show the entire label. Remember 
that you can click and drag the left or right edge of the palette to change its width. You 
can also click and drag the border between the columns in the palette.
	
3.	 If the first item label under the Geometry heading isn’t visible, place the cursor on the 
label. A tool tip displays the full wording of the item, which is Position X.
	
4.	 Move the cursor down one line to display the tool tip for Position Y. This shows how you 
can view the label even if it isn’t fully visible.
	
5.	 Continue to move the cursor down to the Scale X label. The tool tip displays the full title 
and description.
	
6.	 Let’s try making some changes to the toilet properties. Click the Scale X value in the col-
umn just to the right of the Scale X label.

Creating and Using a Symbol |  127  
	
7.	 Enter 1.5↵. Notice that the toilet changes in width as you do this.
	
8.	 You don’t really want to change the width of the toilet, so click the Undo tool in the Quick 
Access toolbar or enter U↵ at the command line.
	
9.	 Close the Properties palette by clicking the X at the top of the Properties palette title bar.
If a block is created with the Scale Uniformly option turned on in the Block Definition dialog 
box, you can’t scale the block in just one axis as shown in the previous exercise. You can only 
scale the block uniformly in all axes.
Symbols for Projects Large and Small
A symbol library was a crucial part of the production of the San Francisco Main Library construc-
tion documents. Shown here is a portion of an AutoCAD floor plan of the library in which some 
typical symbols were used:
Notice the familiar door symbols, such as the one for the door you created in Chapter 2, “Creating 
Your First Drawing.” And yes, there are even toilets in the lower half of the plan in the public rest-
rooms. Symbol use isn’t restricted to building components. Room number labels, diamond-shaped 
interior elevation reference symbols, and the hexagonal column grid symbols are all common to an 
architectural drawing, regardless of the project’s size. As you work through this chapter, keep in 
mind that all of the symbols used in the library drawing were created using the tools presented here.
You’ve just seen how you can modify the properties of a block by using the Properties pal-
ette. In the exercise, you changed the X scale of the Toilet block, but you could have just as easily 
changed the Y value. You may have noticed other properties available in the Properties palette. 
You’ll learn more about those properties as you work through this chapter.
You’ve seen how you can turn a drawing into a symbol, known as a block in AutoCAD. Now 
let’s see how you can use an existing drawing file as a symbol.

128  | CHAPTER 4  Organizing Objects with Blocks and Groups    
Using an Existing Drawing as a Symbol
You need a door into the bathroom. Because you’ve already drawn a door and saved it as a file, 
you can bring the door into this drawing file and use it as a block:
	
1.	 In the Block Ribbon panel, click the Insert tool and select More options. You can also just 
type I↵.
	
2.	 In the Insert dialog box, click the Browse button to open the Select Drawing File dialog box.
	
3.	 This is a standard Windows file browser dialog box. Locate the Door.dwg file and double-
click it. If you didn’t create a door file, you can use the Door.dwg file from the Chapter 4 
project files at this book’s web page.
You can also browse your hard disk by looking at thumbnail views of the drawing files in a folder.
	
4.	 When you return to the Insert dialog box, make sure the Specify On-Screen option is 
checked in the Insertion Point, Scale, and Rotation groups, and then click OK. As you 
move the cursor around, notice that the door appears above and to the right of the cursor 
intersection, as shown in Figure 4.5.

5.	 At this point, the door looks too small for this bathroom. This is because you drew it 3 
units long, which translates to 3″. Metric users drew the door 9 cm long. Pick a point near 
coordinates 7′-2″,2′-4″ so that the door is placed in the lower-right corner of the room. 
Metric users should use the coordinates 210,70.
	
6.	 If you take the default setting for the X scale of the inserted block, the door will remain 
3″ long, or 9 cm long for metric users. However, as mentioned earlier, you can specify a 
smaller or larger size for an inserted object. In this case, you want a 3′ door. Metric users 
want a 90 cm door. To get that from a 3″ door, you need an X scale factor of 12, or 10 for 
metric users. (You may want to review “Understanding Scale Factors” in Chapter 3 to see 
how this is determined.) At the Enter X scale factor, specify opposite corner, 
or [Corner/XYZ] <1>: prompt, enter 12↵. Metric users should enter 10↵.
	
7.	 Press ↵ twice to accept the default Y = X and the rotation angle of 0°.
The Command prompt appears, but nothing seems to happen to the drawing. This is because 
when you enlarged the door, you also enlarged the distance between the base point and the 

Creating and Using a Symbol |  129  
object. This raises another issue when you consider using drawings as symbols: All drawings 
have base points. The default base point is the absolute coordinate 0,0, otherwise known as the 
origin, which is located in the lower-left corner of any new drawing. When you drew the door in 
Chapter 2, you didn’t specify the base point. When you try to bring the door into this drawing, 
AutoCAD uses the origin of the door drawing as its base point (see Figure 4.6).
Figure 4.6
By default, a draw-
ing’s origin is also its 
insertion point. You 
can change a draw-
ing’s insertion point 
by using the Base 
command.
Origin of door drawing
AutoCAD also uses the inserted drawing’s Insertion scale setting in the Units dialog box to 
apply the proper scale (see Chapters 3 and 25 for more on the Insert Scale setting). This feature 
is important when the unit type of the inserted drawing differs from the current drawing. For 
example, you could insert a door drawn in centimeters into a floor plan drawn in feet and inches 
and, as long as the insertion scale is set correctly in the door drawing, the door will appear at 
the correct size for the floor plan.
Because the door appears outside the bathroom, you must first choose Zoom All from the Zoom 
flyout on the Navigation bar to show more of the drawing, and then use the Move command on the 
Modify panel to move the door to the right-side wall of the bathroom. Let’s do so now:
	
1.	 Click Zoom All from the Zoom flyout on the Navigation bar. The view of the room shrinks 
and the door is displayed. Notice that it’s now the proper size for your drawing (see Figure 4.7).
Figure 4.7
The enlarged door

130  | CHAPTER 4  Organizing Objects with Blocks and Groups    
	
2.	 Choose the Move tool from the Modify Ribbon panel, or type M↵.
	
3.	 To pick the door you just inserted, at the Select objects: prompt, click a point any-
where on the door and press ↵. Notice that now the entire door is highlighted. This is 
because a block is treated like a single object, even though it may be made up of several 
lines, arcs, and so on.
	
4.	 At the Specify base point or [Displacement] <Displacement>: prompt, turn 
on Running Osnaps if it isn’t already on, and pick the lower-left corner of the door. 
Remember that pressing the F3 key or clicking Object Snap in the status bar toggles 
Running Osnaps on or off.
	
5.	 At the Specify second point or <use first point as displacement>: prompt, use 
the Nearest osnap override and position the door so that your drawing looks like Figure 4.8.
Figure 4.8
The door on the 
right-side wall of the 
bathroom
Because the door is an object that you’ll use often, it should be a common size so that you 
don’t have to specify an odd value every time you insert it. It would also be helpful if the door’s 
insertion base point were in a more convenient location—that is, a location that would let you 
place the door accurately within a wall opening. Next, you’ll modify the Door block better to 
suit your needs.
Modifying a Block
You can modify a block in three ways. One way is to redefine it completely. In earlier versions of 
AutoCAD, this was the only way to make changes to a block. A second way is to use the Block 
Editor. A third way is to use the Edit Reference tool on the Insert tab’s expanded Reference 
panel. The Edit Reference tool is also known as the Refedit command.
In the following sections, you’ll learn how to redefine a block by making changes to the door 
symbol. Later, in Chapter 17 you’ll see how the Block Editor lets you add adjustability to blocks, 
and in Chapter 7, “Mastering Viewing Tools, Hatches, and External References,” you’ll learn 
about the Edit Reference tool.
Double-clicking most objects displays the Quick Properties palette. Double-clicking a block 
opens the Edit Block Definition dialog box, which gives you another way to edit blocks. You’ll 
learn more about the Edit Block Definition dialog box in Chapter 17.
Unblocking and Redefining a Block
One way to modify a block is to break it down into its components, edit them, and then turn 
them back into a block. This is called redefining a block. If you redefine a block that has been 

Modifying a Block |  131  
inserted in a drawing, each occurrence of that block in the current file changes to reflect the new 
block definition. You can use this block-redefinition feature to make rapid changes to a design.
To separate a block into its components, use the Explode command:
	
1.	 Click Explode from the Home tab’s Modify panel. You can also type X↵ to start the 
Explode command.
	
2.	 Click the door, and press ↵ to confirm your selection.
You can simultaneously insert and explode a block by clicking the Explode check box in 
the lower-left corner of the Insert dialog box.
Now you can edit the individual objects that make up the door, if you desire. In this case, you 
want to change only the door’s insertion point because you’ve already made it a more conve-
nient size. You’ll turn the door back into a block, this time using the door’s lower-left corner for 
its insertion base point:
	
1.	 In the Block Ribbon panel, select Create Block, or type B↵.
	
2.	 In the Block Definition dialog box, select Door from the Name drop-down list.
	
3.	 Click the Pick Point button, and pick the lower-left corner of the door.
	
4.	 Click the Select Objects button, and select the components of the door, including the 
small, vertical lines at each end of the door. Press ↵ when you’ve finished making your 
selection.
	
5.	 Select the Convert To Block option in the Objects group to convert the selected objects 
automatically in the drawing into a block.
	
6.	 Select Inches (or cm for metric users) from the Block Unit drop-down list, and then enter 
Standard door in the Description box.
	
7.	 Click OK. You see a warning message that reads, “The block definition has changed. Do 
you want to redefine it?” You don’t want to redefine an existing block accidentally. In 
this case, you know that you want to redefine the door, so click the Redefine button to 
proceed.
The Select Objects and Pick Point buttons appear in other dialog boxes. Make note of their 
appearance and remember that when you select them, the dialog box temporarily closes to let 
you select points or objects and otherwise perform operations that require a clear view of the 
drawing area.
In step 7, you received a warning message that you were about to redefine the existing Door 
block. But originally you inserted the door as a file, not as a block. Whenever you insert a draw-
ing file by using the Insert Block tool, the inserted drawing automatically becomes a block in 
the current drawing. When you redefine a block, however, you don’t affect the drawing file you 
imported. AutoCAD changes only the block in the current file.
You’ve just redefined the door block. Now place the door in the wall of the room:
	
1.	 Choose Erase from the Modify Ribbon panel and then click the door. Notice that the 
entire door is one object instead of individual lines and an arc. Had you not selected the 
Convert To Block option in step 5 of the previous exercise, the components of the block 
would have remained individual objects.

132  | CHAPTER 4  Organizing Objects with Blocks and Groups    
	
2.	 Press ↵ to erase the door.
	
3.	 Click the Insert tool on the Home tab’s Block panel, and select More Options.
	
4.	 In the Insert dialog box, select Door from the Name drop-down list and make sure that 
the Specify On-Screen option for Scale is not checked. This will save time while insert-
ing subsequent blocks, since AutoCAD will not prompt you for a scale after selecting a 
location.
	
5.	 This time, use the Nearest osnap override and pick a point on the right-side wall of the 
bathroom near coordinate 9′-4″,2′-1″. Metric users should insert the door near 284,63.4.
	
6.	 At the Specify rotation angle <0>: prompt, press ↵ to accept the default angle.
	
7.	 Use the Grips feature to mirror the door, using the wall as the mirror axis so that the 
door is inside the room. To mirror an object using grips, select the objects to mirror, click 
a grip, and right-click. Select Mirror from the context menu; then, indicate a mirror axis 
with the cursor. Press Esc when you’re done.
Your drawing will look like Figure 4.9.

Next, you’ll see how you can update an external file with a redefined block.
Saving a Block as a Drawing File
You’ve seen that, with little effort, you can create a symbol and place it anywhere in a file. 
Suppose you want to use this symbol in other files. When you create a block by using the Block 
command, the block exists in the current file only until you specifically instruct AutoCAD to 
save it as a separate drawing file. When you have an existing drawing that has been brought in 
and modified, such as the door, the drawing file associated with that door isn’t automatically 
updated. To update the Door file, you must take an extra step and use the Export option on the 
Application menu. Let’s see how this works.
Start by turning the Tub and Toilet blocks into individual files:
	
1.	 Press the Esc key to make sure that nothing is selected and that no command is active.
	
2.	 From the Application menu, choose Export ➢ Other Formats to open the Export Data dia-
log box, which is a simple file dialog box.
	
3.	 Open the Files Of Type drop-down list, and select Block (*.dwg).

Modifying a Block |  133  
If you prefer, you can skip step 3 and instead enter the full filename, including the .dwg 
extension, as in Tub.dwg.
	
4.	 Select the entire contents of the File Name text box and enter Tub.
	
5.	 Click the Save button to close the Export Data dialog box.
	
6.	 At the [= (block=output file)/* (whole drawing)] <define new drawing>: prompt, 
enter the name of the block you want to save to disk as the tub file—in this case, Tub↵.
The Tub block is now saved as a file.
	
7.	 Repeat steps 1 through 6 for the Toilet block. Give the file the same name as the block.
Options for Saving Blocks
AutoCAD gives you the option to save a block’s file under the same name as the original block 
or save it with a different name. Usually, you’ll want to use the same name, which you can do by 
entering an equal sign (=) after the prompt.
Normally, AutoCAD saves a preview image with a file. This enables you to preview a drawing file 
before opening it.
Replacing Existing Files with Blocks
The Wblock command does the same thing as choosing Export ➢ Other Formats, but output is 
limited to AutoCAD DWG files. Let’s try using the Wblock command this time to save the Door 
block you modified:
	
1.	 Issue the Wblock command by typing Wblock↵, or use the keyboard shortcut by typing 
W↵. This opens the Write Block dialog box (see Figure 4.10).
Figure 4.10
The Write Block dialog 
box

134  | CHAPTER 4  Organizing Objects with Blocks and Groups    
	
2.	 In the Source group, click the Block radio button.
	
3.	 Select Door from the drop-down list. You can keep the old name or enter a different name 
if you prefer.
	
4.	 In this case, you want to update the door you drew in Chapter 2. Click the Browse button 
to the right of the File Name And Path text box in the Destination group.
	
5.	 Locate and select the original Door.dwg file that you inserted earlier. Click Save to close 
the dialog box.
	
6.	 Click OK. A warning message tells you that the Door.dwg file already exists. Go ahead 
and click the “Replace the existing. . .” option to confirm that you want to overwrite the 
old door drawing with the new door definition.
In this exercise, you typed the Wblock command at the Command prompt instead of choosing 
Export ➢ Other Formats. The results are the same regardless of which method you use. If you’re 
in a hurry, the Export ➢ Other Formats command is a quick way to save part of your drawing as a 
file. The Wblock option might be easier for new users because it offers options in a dialog box.
Understanding the Write Block Dialog Box Options
The Write Block dialog box offers a way to save parts of your current drawing as a file. As you 
can see from the dialog box shown in the previous exercise, you have several options.
In that exercise, you used the Block option of the Source group to select an existing block as 
the source object to be exported. You can also export a set of objects by choosing the Objects 
option. If you choose this option, the Base Point and Objects groups become available. These 
options work the same way as their counterparts in the Block Definition dialog box, which you 
saw earlier when you created the Tub and Toilet blocks.
The other option in the Source group, Entire Drawing, lets you export the whole drawing to 
its own file. This may seem to duplicate the Save As option in the Application menu, but saving 
the entire drawing from the Write Block dialog box performs some additional operations, such 
as stripping out unused blocks or other unused components. This has the effect of reducing file 
size. You’ll learn more about this feature later in this chapter.
Other Uses for Blocks
So far you’ve used the Block tool to create symbols, and you’ve used the Export and Wblock 
commands to save those symbols to disk. As you can see, you can create symbols and save them 

Understanding the Annotation Scale |  135  
at any time while you’re drawing. You’ve made the tub and toilet symbols into drawing files that 
you can see when you check the contents of your current folder.
However, creating symbols isn’t the only use for the Block, Export, and Wblock com-
mands. You can use them in any situation that requires grouping objects (though you may 
prefer to use the more flexible Object Grouping dialog box discussed later in this chapter). 
You can also use blocks to stretch a set of objects along one axis by using the Properties 
palette. Export and Wblock also enable you to save a part of a drawing to disk. You’ll see 
instances of these other uses of the Block, Export, and Wblock commands throughout the 
book.
Block, Export, and Wblock are extremely versatile commands and, if used judiciously, can 
boost your productivity and simplify your work. If you aren’t careful, however, you can get car-
ried away and create more blocks than you can track. Planning your drawings helps you deter-
mine which elements will work best as blocks and recognize situations in which other methods 
of organization are more suitable.
Another way of using symbols is to use the external reference capabilities. External refer-
ence files, known as Xrefs, are files inserted into a drawing in a way similar to how blocks are 
inserted. The difference is that Xrefs don’t become part of the drawing’s database. Instead, 
they’re loaded along with the current file at startup time. It’s as if AutoCAD opens several draw-
ings at once: the main file you specify when you start AutoCAD and the Xrefs associated with 
the main file.
By keeping the Xrefs independent from the current file, you make sure that any changes 
made to the Xrefs automatically appear in the current file. You don’t have to update each 
inserted copy of an Xref. For example, if you use the Attach tool on the Insert tab’s Reference 
panel (discussed in Chapter 7) to insert the tub drawing and later you make changes to the 
tub, the next time you open the Bath file, you’ll see the new version of the tub. Or if you have 
both the tub and the referencing drawing open and you change the tub, AutoCAD will notify 
you that a change has been made to an external reference. You can then update the tub Xref 
using the External Reference palette.
Xrefs are especially useful in workgroup environments where several people are working 
on the same project. One person might be updating several files that have been inserted into a 
variety of other files. Before Xrefs were available, everyone in the workgroup had to be notified 
of the changes and had to update all the affected blocks in all the drawings that contained them. 
With Xrefs, the updating is automatic. Many other features are unique to these files. They’re 
­discussed in more detail in Chapters 7 and 14.
Understanding the Annotation Scale
One common use for the AutoCAD block feature is creating reference symbols. These are symbols 
that refer the viewer to other drawings or views in a set of drawings. An example would be a 
building-section symbol on a floor plan that directs the viewer to look at a location on another 
sheet to see a cross-sectional view of a building. Such a symbol is typically a circle with two 
numbers: one is the drawing sheet number, and the other is the view number on the sheet (see 
Figure 4.11).
Certiﬁcation
Objective

136  | CHAPTER 4  Organizing Objects with Blocks and Groups    
In the past, AutoCAD users had to insert a reference symbol block multiple times to accom-
modate different scales of the same view. For example, the same floor plan might be used for a 
1⁄4″ = 1′-0″ scale view and a 1⁄8″ = 1′-0″ view. An elevation symbol block that works for the 1⁄4″ = 
1′-0″ scale view would be too small for the 1⁄8″ = 1′-0″ view, so two copies of the same block were 
inserted, one for each scale. The user then had to place the two blocks on different layers to con-
trol their visibility. In addition, if sheet numbers changed, the user had to make sure that every 
copy of the elevation symbol block was updated to reflect the change.
The annotation scale feature does away with this need for redundancy. You can now use a 
single instance of a block even if it must be displayed in different scale views. To do this, you 
must take some additional steps when creating and inserting the block. Here’s how you do it:
	
1.	 Draw your symbol at the size it should appear when plotted. For example, if the symbol is 
supposed to be a 1/4″ circle on a printed sheet, draw the symbol as a 1/4″ circle.
	
2.	 Open the Block Definition dialog box by choosing the Create Block tool from the Insert 
tab’s Block Definition Ribbon panel.
	
3.	 Turn on the Annotative option in the Behavior section of the Block Definition dialog box. 
You can also turn on the Match Block Orientation To Layout option if you want the sym-
bol always to appear in a vertical orientation (see Figure 4.12).
Figure 4.11
A single block is used 
to create building sec-
tion symbols of dif-
ferent sizes in these 
layout views. Both 
views show the same 
floor plan displayed at 
different scales.
The size of the block adjusts to the viewport scale so its size remains constant.

option in the Block 
Definition dialog box.

4.	 Select the objects that make up the block, and indicate an insertion point as usual.
	
5.	 Give the block a name and then click OK.
After you’ve followed these steps, you need to apply an annotation scale to the newly created block:
	
1.	 Click the new block to select it.
	
2.	 Right-click and choose Annotative Object Scale ➢ Add/Delete Scales. The Annotation 
Object Scale dialog box appears (see Figure 4.13).

4.	 Select from the list the scale you’ll be using with this block. You can Ctrl+click to select 
multiple scales. When you’ve finished selecting scales, click OK. The selected scales 
appear in the Annotation Object Scale dialog box.
	
5.	 Click OK to close the Annotation Object Scale dialog box.
	
3.	 Click the Add button. The Add Scales To Object dialog box appears (see Figure 4.14).

138  | CHAPTER 4  Organizing Objects with Blocks and Groups    
Figure 4.15
The Annotation Scale 
and the layout view’s 
Viewport Scale drop-
down lists
At this point, the block is ready to be used in multiple scale views. You need only to select 
a scale from the model view’s Annotation Scale drop-down list or the layout view’s Viewport 
Scale drop-down list, which are both in the lower-right corner of the AutoCAD window (see 
Figure 4.15). For you to select a scale while in a layout, a viewport border needs to be selected.
The Annotation Scale drop-down list appears in model view, and the Viewport Scale drop-
down list appears in layout view when a viewport is selected. (See Chapter 15, “Laying Out 
Your Printer Output,” for more about layouts and viewports.) Note that the list has a scroll bar 
to the right, enabling you to select from a comprehensive list of scales. In layout view, you can 
set the Viewport Scale value for each individual viewport so that the same block can appear at 
the appropriate size for different scale viewports (see Figure 4.15).
If you want to use several copies of a block that is using multiple annotation scales, you should 
insert the block and assign the additional annotation scales and then make copies of the block. If  
you insert a new instance of the block, the block acquires only the annotation scale that is current  
for the drawing. You’ll have to assign additional annotation scales to each new insertion of the block.
If you’re uncertain whether an annotation scale has been assigned to a block, you can click 
the block and you’ll see the different scale versions of the block as ghosted images. Also, if 
you hover over a block, triangular symbols appear next to the cursor for blocks that have been 
assigned annotation scales.
Annotative scale symbol
If you need to change the position of a block for a particular layout viewport scale, go to 
Model view, select the appropriate scale from the Annotation Scale drop-down list, and then 
adjust the position of the block.

Blocks are extremely useful tools, but for some situations, they’re too restrictive. At times, you’ll 
want to group objects so that they’re connected but can still be edited individually. For example, 

Grouping Objects |  139  
consider a space planner who has to place workstations on a floor plan. Although each worksta-
tion is basically the same, some slight variations in each station could make the use of blocks 
unwieldy. For instance, one workstation might need a different configuration to accommodate 
special equipment, and another workstation might need to be slightly larger than the standard 
size. You would need to create a block for one workstation and then, for each variation, explode 
the block, edit it, and create a new block.
A better way is to draw a prototype workstation and turn it into a group. You can copy the 
group into position and then edit it for each individual situation without losing its identity as 
a group. The AutoCAD LT® software offers a different method for grouping objects. If you’re 
using AutoCAD LT, skip this exercise and continue with the following section, “Working with 
the AutoCAD LT Group Manager.”
The following exercise demonstrates how grouping works:
	
1.	 Save the Bath file, and then open the drawing Office1.dwg from the sample files at this 
book’s web page. Metric users should open Office1-metric.dwg.
	
2.	 Use the Zoom command to enlarge just the view of the workstation, as shown in the first 
image in Figure 4.16.
Figure 4.16

office plan

3.	 Click Group in the Home tab’s Groups panel, or type G↵ or Group↵.
	
4.	 Type N↵Station1↵ or select Name from the Command window and type Station1↵ to 
name your group.

140  | CHAPTER 4  Organizing Objects with Blocks and Groups    
	
5.	 At the Select objects or [Name/Description]: prompt, use a selection window to 
select the entire workstation in the lower-left corner of the plan and press ↵. You’ve just 
created a group.
Now whenever you want to select the workstation, you can click any part of it to select the 
entire group. At the same time, you can still modify individual parts of the group—the desk, 
partition, and so on—without losing the grouping of objects (see the next section, “Modifying 
Members of a Group”).
Another way to create a group is to use the Object Grouping dialog box (see Figure 4.17). Click 
Group Manager on the Home tab’s expanded Groups panel or type classicgroup↵ to open it.
Figure 4.17
Object Grouping 
­dialog box
Enter a name for your group in the Group Name text box, and then click the New button. The 
dialog box will temporarily disappear, allowing you to select the objects for your group. Once 
you’ve selected the objects, press ↵ to return to the dialog box. Click OK to complete the creation 
of the group.
Modifying Members of a Group
Next you’ll make copies of the original group and modify the copies. Figure 4.18 is a sketch of 
the proposed layout that uses the new workstations. Look carefully and you’ll see that some 

Grouping Objects |  141  
of the workstations in the sketch are missing a few of the standard components that exist in 
the Station1 group. One pair of stations has a partition removed; another station has one less 
chair.
The exercises in this section show you how to complete your drawing to reflect the design 
requirements of the sketch.
Start by making a copy of the workstation:
	
1.	 Click Copy on the Modify Ribbon panel or type Co↵; then click the Station1 group you 
just created. Notice that you can click any part of the station to select the entire station. 
If only a single object is selected, press Shift+Ctrl+A and try clicking another part of the 
group.
	
2.	 Press ↵ to finish your selection.
	
3.	 At the Specify base point or [Displacement/mOde] <Displacement>: prompt, type 
@↵.
	
4.	 At the Specify second point or [Array] <use first point as displacement>: 
prompt, enter @8′2″<90 to copy the workstation 8′-2″ vertically. Metric users should enter 
@249<90. Press ↵ to exit the Copy command.
Figure 4.18
A sketch of the new 
office layout

142  | CHAPTER 4  Organizing Objects with Blocks and Groups    
You can also use the Direct Distance method by typing @↵ and then pointing the rubber-
banding line 90° and typing 8′2″↵. Metric users should type 249↵.
	
5.	 Issue the Copy command again, but this time click the copy of the workstation that you 
just created. Notice that it too is a group.
	
6.	 Copy this workstation 8′-2″ (249 cm for metric users) vertically, just as you did the original 
workstation. Press ↵ to exit the Copy command.
Next you’ll use grips to mirror the first workstation copy:
	
1.	 Click the middle workstation to highlight it.
	
2.	 Click the grip in the middle of the workstation, as shown in Figure 4.19.
Figure 4.19
Selecting the grip to 
mirror the group
Click this
 grip to begin
 mirroring the
workstation.
	
3.	 Right-click and choose Mirror from the context menu. Notice that a temporary mirror 
image of the workstation follows the movement of your cursor.
	
4.	 Turn on Ortho mode, and pick a point directly to the right of the hot grip you picked in 
step 2. The workstation is mirrored to a new orientation.
	
5.	 Press the Esc key twice to clear the grip selection. Also, turn off Ortho mode.
Now that you’ve got the workstations laid out, you need to remove some of the partitions 
between the new workstations. If you had used blocks for the workstations, you would first 
need to explode the workstations that have partitions that you want to edit. Groups, however, let 
you make changes without undoing their grouping.
Use these steps to remove the partitions:
	
1.	 Click the Group Select On/Off tool in the Home tab’s Groups panel. You can also press 
Shift+Ctrl+A. Notice that the icon changes from being highlighted to not being high-
lighted. The Group Select On/Off tool turns groupings on or off so that you can select 
and edit individual objects within a group.
	
2.	 Erase the short partition that divides the two workstations, as shown in Figure 4.20. Since 
you made a mirror copy of the original workstation, you’ll need to erase two partitions 
that are overlapping each other, the original and the copy.

Grouping Objects |  143  
	
3.	 Press Shift+Ctrl+A again to turn Group back on.
Figure 4.20
Remove the parti-
tions between the 
two workstations.
Erase this partition.
	
4.	 To check your workstations, click one of them to see whether all of its components are 
highlighted together.
	
5.	 Close the file when you’re finished. You don’t need to save your changes.
Besides pressing Shift+Ctrl+A to turn groups on and off, you can click the Group Selection 
On/Off tool in the Home tab’s Groups panel. This tool changes the setting for Pickstyle. 
Pickstyle is a system variable that controls how groups are selected.
Ungrouping, Adding, and Subtracting from a Group
There are a few other tools in the Groups panel that will come in handy when working with groups 
(see Figure 4.21). The Ungroup tool does exactly what it says: It will “ungroup” a group. Click the 
Ungroup tool or type ungroup↵, and then select the group or groups you want to ungroup.
Figure 4.21
The tools on the 
Home tab’s Groups 
panel

Group Edit
Group Selection On/Off
The Group Edit tool enables you to add or subtract objects from a group. You can also rename a 
group with this tool. Click the Group Edit tool or enter groupedit↵, select the group you want to edit, 
and then use the Add, Remove, or Rename option from the Dynamic Input menu that appears at the 
cursor. You can also type A↵, R↵, or REN↵ to add to, remove from, or rename a group, respectively.
The Groups panel can be expanded to display the Group Manager and Group Bounding Box 
options. The Group Manager tool opens the Object Grouping dialog box. If you’ve used the Group 
command in earlier versions of AutoCAD, you’ll recognize this as the old Group command. The 
Group Bounding Box option toggles the way groups are displayed. You can view groups with the 
grips of all objects displayed, which is how groups were displayed in prior releases of AutoCAD, 
or you can display groups with a single grip and a bounding box (see Figure 4.22).

Working with the Object Grouping Dialog Box
Each group has a unique name, and you can also attach a brief description of a group in the 
Object Grouping dialog box. When you copy a group, AutoCAD assigns an arbitrary name to 
the newly created group. Copies of groups are considered unnamed, but you can still list them 
in the Object Grouping dialog box by clicking the Include Unnamed check box. You can click 
the Rename button in the Object Grouping dialog box to name unnamed groups appropri-
ately (see Figure 4.23). Click the Group Manager tool in the Home tab’s Groups panel or type 
­classicgroup↵ to open the Object Grouping dialog box.
Figure 4.23
The Object Grouping 
dialog box

Grouping Objects |  145  
Objects in a group aren’t bound solely to that group. One object can be a member of several 
groups, and you can have nested groups (groups within groups).
AutoCAD LT users have a different set of options. See the next section, “Working with the 
AutoCAD LT Group Manager.”
Table 4.2 gives a rundown of the options available in the Object Grouping dialog box.

You’ve seen how you can use groups to create an office layout. You can also use groups to help 
you keep sets of objects temporarily together in a complex drawing. Groups can be especially use-
ful in 3D modeling when you want to organize complex assemblies together for easy selection.
The Bottom Line
Create and insert a symbol.  If you have a symbol that you use often in a drawing, you can 
draw it once and then turn it into an AutoCAD block. A block can be placed in a drawing 
multiple times in any location, like a rubber stamp. A block is stored in a drawing as a block 
definition, which can be called up at any time.
Master It  Name the dialog box used to create a block from objects in a drawing, and also 
name the tool used to open this dialog box.
Modify a block.  Once you’ve created a block, it isn’t set in stone. One of the features of 
a block is that you can change the block definition, and all of the copies of the block are 
updated to the new definition.
Master It  What is the name of the tool used to “unblock” a block?
Understand the annotation scale.  In some cases, you’ll want to create a block that is depen-
dent on the drawing scale. You can create a block that adjusts itself to the scale of your draw-
ing through the annotation scale feature. When the annotation scale feature is turned on for a 
block, the block can be set to appear at the correct size depending on the scale of your drawing.
Master It  What setting in the Block Definition dialog box turns on the annotation scale 
feature, and how do you set the annotation scale of a block?
Group objects.  Blocks can be used as a tool to group objects together, but blocks can be 
too rigid for some grouping applications. AutoCAD offers groups, which are collections of 
objects that are similar to blocks but aren’t as rigidly defined.
Master It  How are groups different from blocks?

Chapter  5
Keeping Track of Layers and Blocks 
Imagine a filing system that has only one category into which you put all of your records. For 
only a handful of documents, such a filing system might work. However, as soon as you start to 
accumulate more documents, you would want to start separating them into meaningful catego-
ries, perhaps alphabetically or by their use, so that you could find them more easily.
The same is true for drawings. If you have a simple drawing with only a few objects, you can 
get by without using layers. But as soon as your drawing gets the least bit complicated, you’ll 
want to start sorting your objects into layers to keep track of what’s what. Layers don’t restrict 
you when you’re editing objects, such as blocks or groups, and you can set up layers so that you 
can easily identify which object belongs to which layer.
In this chapter, you’ll learn how to create and use layers to keep your drawings organized. 
You’ll learn how color can play an important role while you’re working with layers, and you’ll 
also learn how to include linetypes such as dashes and center lines through the use of layers.
In this chapter, you will learn to

Organizing Information with Layers
You can think of layers as overlays on which you keep various types of information (see 
Figure 5.1). In a floor plan of a building, for example, you want to keep the walls, ceiling, plumb-
ing fixtures, wiring, and furniture separate so that you can display or plot them individually 
or combine them in different ways. It’s also a good idea to keep notes and reference symbols, as 
well as the drawing’s dimensions, on their own layers. As your drawing becomes more complex, 
you can turn the various layers on and off to allow easier display and modification.
For example, one of your consultants might need a plot of just the dimensions and walls, 
without all the other information; another consultant might need only a furniture layout. In the 
days of manual drafting, you would have had to redraw your plan for each consultant or use 
overlay drafting techniques, which could be cumbersome. With the AutoCAD® 2017 software, 
you can turn off the layers you don’t need and plot a drawing containing only the required 
information. A carefully planned layering scheme helps you produce a document that combines 
the types of information needed in each case.
Certiﬁcation
Objective

150  | CHAPTER 5  Keeping Track of Layers and Blocks   
Using layers also lets you modify your drawings more easily. For example, suppose you have 
an architectural drawing with separate layers for the walls, the ceiling plan, and the floor plan. 
If any change occurs in the wall locations, you can turn on the ceiling plan layer to see where 
the new wall locations will affect the ceiling, make the proper adjustments, and then turn it off 
again to see the walls more clearly.
AutoCAD allows an unlimited number of layers, and you can name each layer anything you 
want, using any characters, with the exception of these: < > / \ ":; ? * |, = '.
Creating and Assigning Layers
You’ll start your exploration of layers by using a palette to create a new layer, giving your layer a 
name, and assigning it a color. Then you’ll look at alternate ways of creating a layer through the 
command line. Next you’ll assign the new layer to the objects in your drawing. Start by getting 
familiar with the Layer Properties Manager:
	
1.	 Open the Bath file you created in Chapter 4, “Organizing Objects with Blocks and 
Groups.” (If you didn’t create one, use either 04b-bath.dwg or 04b-bath-metric.dwg 
from this book’s companion web page, www.sybex.com/go/masteringautocad2017.)

2.	 To display the Layer Properties Manager, click the Layer Properties tool in the Home tab’s 
Layers panel, or type LA↵ to use the keyboard shortcut.
The Layer Properties Manager shows you, at a glance, the status of your layers. Right 
now, you have only one layer, but as your work expands, so too will the number of layers. 
You’ll then find this palette indispensable.
	
3.	 Click the New Layer button at the top of the palette. The button has an icon that looks 
like a star next to a sheet.
A new layer named Layer1 appears in the list box. Notice that the name is highlighted. 
This tells you that, by typing, you can change the default name to something better 
suited to your needs.
	
4.	 Type Wall. As you type, your entry replaces the Layer1 name in the list box.
	
5.	 With the Wall layer name highlighted, click the Color icon in the Wall layer listing to dis-
play a dialog box in which you can assign a color to the Wall layer. You will find the Color 
icon under the Color column; it currently shows White as its value. The icon is just to the 
left of the word white, which doesn’t appear in its entirety in the following image.
The Select Color dialog box opens to the Index Color tab (see Figure 5.2).

152  | CHAPTER 5  Keeping Track of Layers and Blocks   
	
6.	 In the row of standard colors next to the ByLayer button, click the green square and then 
click OK. Notice that the color swatch in the Wall layer listing is now green.
	
7.	 Click the X at the top of the Layer Properties Manager’s title bar to close it.
From this point on, any object assigned to the Wall layer will appear green, unless the object 
is specifically assigned a different color.
Using Auto-Hide with the Layer Properties Manager
The Layer Properties Manager is a non-modal (or modeless) palette, which means that any 
change you make within the palette will take effect immediately in the drawing. It also means 
that the palette can stay open even while you perform other operations that aren’t layer related. 
Throughout this chapter, we’ll ask you to open or close the Layer Properties Manager, but if you 
prefer, you can keep it open all the time. If you decide to keep it open, you may want to use the 
palette’s Auto-Hide feature. Click the Auto-Hide icon toward the top of the palette’s title bar so 
that it changes to a single-sided arrowhead.
With Auto-Hide on, the palette will minimize to display only its title bar. To open the palette, 
click the title bar. To minimize it, point the cursor anywhere outside of the palette for a moment. 
You can also force the palette to the left or right margin of the AutoCAD window. To do this, 
right-click the palette title bar and select Anchor Left or Anchor Right.
Using True or PANTONE Colors
In the preceding exercise, you chose a color from the Index Color tab of the Select Color dialog 
box. Most of the time, you’ll find that the Index Color tab includes enough colors to suit your 
Figure 5.2
The Select Color dialog box

Organizing Information with Layers |  153  
needs. But if you’re creating a presentation drawing in which color selection is important, you 
can choose colors from either the True Color or the Color Books tab of the Select Color dialog box.
The True Color tab offers a full range of colors through a color palette similar to the one 
found in Adobe Photoshop and other image-editing programs (see Figure 5.3).
Figure 5.3
The True Color tab
You have the choice of using hue, saturation, and luminance, which is the HSL color model, 
or you can use the RGB (red, green, blue) color model. You can select HSL or RGB from the Color 
Model drop-down list in the upper-right corner of the dialog box (see Figure 5.4).
You can also select from DIC, PANTONE, and RAL color books, to match those widely used 
print color systems, by using the Color Books tab (see Figure 5.5).
Let’s continue with our look at layers in AutoCAD.
Figure 5.4
The Color Model drop-down list

154  | CHAPTER 5  Keeping Track of Layers and Blocks   
Understanding the Layer Properties Manager Palette
The Layer Properties Manager conforms to the Windows interface standard. The most promi-
nent feature of this palette is the layer list box, as you saw in the previous exercise. Notice that 
the bar at the top of the list offers several columns for the various layer properties. Just as in File 
Explorer, you can adjust the width of each column in the list by clicking and dragging either side 
of the column headings. You can also sort the layer list based on one of these properties by click-
ing the property name at the top of the list. Also, just as with other Windows list boxes, you can 
Shift+click to select a block of layer names, or you can Ctrl+click individual names to select mul-
tiple layers throughout the list. These features will become helpful as your list of layers grows.
Above the layer list, you can see four tool buttons.
New Layer
Delete Layer
New Layer VP Frozen In All Viewports
Set Current
You’ve already seen how the New Layer tool works. The tool next to it, New Layer VP Frozen 
In All Viewports, looks similar to the New Layer tool and performs a similar function. The main 
difference is that the New Layer VP Frozen In All Viewports tool freezes the newly created layer. 
To delete layers, you select a layer or group of layers and then click the Delete Layer tool. Be 
aware that you can’t delete layer 0, locked layers, or layers that contain objects. The Set Current 
tool enables you to set the current layer, the one on which you want to work. You can also see at 
a glance which layer is current by the green check mark in the Status column of the layer list.
Another way to create or delete layers is to select a layer or set of layers from the list box and then 
right-click. A menu appears, which includes the same functions as the tools above the layer list.
You’ll also notice another set of three tools farther to the left of the New Layer tool. Those 
tools offer features to organize your layers in a meaningful way. You’ll get a closer look at them 
a little later in this chapter in the section “Taming an Unwieldy List of Layers.”

Controlling Layers Through the Layer Command
You’ve seen how the Layer Properties Manager makes it easy to view and edit layer information 
and how you can select layer colors from the Select Color dialog box. But you can also control 
layers through the Command prompt.
Use these steps to control layers via the Command prompt:
	
1.	 Press the Esc key to make sure any current command is canceled.
	
2.	 At the Command prompt, enter -Layer↵. Make sure you include the hyphen in front of 
the word Layer. The following prompt appears:
Enter an option
[?/Make/Set/New/Rename/ON/OFF/Color/Ltype/
LWeight/TRansparency/MATerial/
Plot/ Freeze/Thaw/LOck/Unlock/stAte/
Description/rEconcile]:
You’ll learn about many of the options in this prompt as you work through this chapter.
	
3.	 Enter N↵ to select the New option.
	
4.	 At the Enter name list for new layer(s): prompt, enter Wall2↵. The [?/Make/Set/
New/Rename/ON/OFF/Color/Ltype/LWeight/TRansparency/MATerial/Plot/Freeze/
Thaw/LOck/Unlock/stAte/rEconcile]: prompt appears again.
	
5.	 Enter C↵.
	
6.	 At the New color [Truecolor/COlorbook]: prompt, enter Yellow↵. Or, you can enter 
2↵, the numeric equivalent of the color yellow in AutoCAD.
	
7.	 At the Enter name list of layer(s) for color 2 (yellow) <0>: prompt, enter 
Wall2↵. The [?/Make/Set/New/Rename/ON/OFF/Color/Ltype/LWeight/TRansparency/
MATerial/Plot/Freeze/Thaw/LOck/Unlock/stAte/rEconcile]: prompt appears again.
	
8.	 Press ↵ to exit the Layer command.
Each method of controlling layers has its own advantages. The Layer Properties Manager offers 
more information about your layers at a glance. On the other hand, the Layer command offers a  
quick way to control and create layers if you’re in a hurry. Also, if you intend to write custom 
macros, you’ll want to know how to use the Layer command, as opposed to using the Layer 
Properties Manager, because palettes can’t be controlled through custom toolbar buttons or 
scripts.
Assigning Layers to Objects
When you create an object, that object is assigned to the current layer. Until now, only one layer 
has existed—layer 0—and it contains all of the objects that you’ve drawn so far. Now that you’ve 
created some new layers, you can reassign objects to them by using the Properties palette:
	
1.	 Select the four lines that represent the bathroom walls. If you have trouble singling out 
the wall to the left, use a window to select the wall line. You can also select everything 
with a selection window and then Shift+click the tub, toilet, and door.
Certiﬁcation
Objective

156  | CHAPTER 5  Keeping Track of Layers and Blocks   
	
2.	 With the cursor in the drawing area, right-click and choose Properties from the context 
menu to open the Properties palette. This palette lets you modify the properties of an 
object or a set of objects. (See the upcoming sidebar “Understanding Object Properties.”)
	
3.	 Click the Layer option on the list in the Properties palette. Notice that an arrow appears 
in the layer name to the right of the Layer option.
	
4.	 Click the down-pointing arrow to the far right of the Layer option to display a list of all of 
the available layers.
	
5.	 Select the Wall layer from the list. Notice that the wall lines you selected change to 
a green color. This tells you that the objects have been assigned to the Wall layer. 
(Remember that you assigned a green color to the Wall layer.)
	
6.	 Close the Properties palette by clicking the X at the top of its title bar.
	
7.	 Press the Esc key to clear your selection.
The bathroom walls are now on the new layer called Wall and are green. Layers are more 
easily distinguished from one another when you use colors to set them apart.
Using the Quick Properties Panel
This chapter focuses on the tools in the Ribbon and the Properties palette to set the properties of 
an object. You can also use the Quick Properties panel to change the color, layer, and linetype of 
objects. The Quick Properties panel appears when you double-click an object.
Certiﬁcation
Objective
Next, you’ll practice the commands you learned in this section and try some new ones by cre-
ating new layers and changing the layer assignments of the rest of the objects in your bathroom:
	
1.	 Click the Layer Properties tool in the Home tab’s Layers panel to open the Layer 
Properties Manager. Create a new layer called Fixture, and give it the color blue.
You can change the name of a layer in the Layer Properties Manager. Select the layer 
name that you want to change and click it again so that the name is highlighted, or press 
the F2 key. You can then rename the layer. This works in the same way as renaming a file 
or folder in Windows.
	
2.	 Press the Esc key to clear any selections and then click the Tub and Toilet blocks.
	
3.	 Right-click and choose Properties from the context menu to open the Properties palette.
	
4.	 Click Layer in the list of properties, and then select Fixture from the drop-down list to 
the right of the layer listing.

5.	 Click the X at the top of the title bar of the Properties palette to dismiss it, and then press 
the Esc key to clear your selection.
	
6.	 Create a new layer for the door, name the layer Door, and make it red.
	
7.	 Just as you’ve done with the walls and fixtures, use the Properties palette to assign the 
door to the Door layer.
	
8.	 Use the Layer Properties Manager to create three more layers: one for the ceiling, one for 
the doorjambs, and one for the floor. Create these layers, and set their colors as indicated 
(remember that you can open the Select Color dialog box by clicking the color swatch of 
the layer listing):
Ceiling
Magenta (6)
Jamb
Green (3)
Floor
Cyan (4)
In step 3 of the previous exercise, you used the Properties palette, which offered several 
options for modifying the block. The options displayed in the Properties palette depend on the 
objects you’ve selected. With only one object selected, AutoCAD displays options that apply 
specifically to that object. With several objects selected, you’ll see a more limited set of options 
because AutoCAD can change only those properties that are common to all of the objects selected.
Understanding Object Properties
It helps to think of the components of an AutoCAD drawing as having properties. For example, a 
line has geometric properties, such as its length and the coordinates that define its endpoints. An 
arc has a radius, a center, and beginning and ending coordinates. Even though a layer isn’t an object 
that you can grasp and manipulate, it can have properties such as color, linetypes, and lineweights.
By default, objects take on the color, linetype, and lineweight of the layer to which they’re assigned, 
but you can also assign these properties directly to individual objects. These general properties can 
be manipulated through both the Properties palette and the Home tab’s Properties panel.
Although many of the options in the Properties palette may seem cryptic, don’t worry about them 
at this point. As you work with AutoCAD, these properties will become more familiar. You’ll find 
that you won’t be too concerned with the geometric properties because you’ll be manipulating them 
with the standard editing tools in the Modify panel. The other properties will be explained in the 
rest of this chapter and in other chapters.
Note that in a block, you can change the color assignment and linetype of only those objects 
that are on layer 0. See the sidebar “Controlling Colors and Linetypes of Blocked Objects,” in the 
next section.
Working on Layers
So far, you’ve created layers and then assigned objects to them. In this section, you’ll learn how 
to use the layer drop-down list in the Layers panel to assign layers to objects. In the process, 
you’ll make some additions to the drawing.

158  | CHAPTER 5  Keeping Track of Layers and Blocks   
The current layer is still layer 0, and unless you change the current layer, every new object 
you draw will be on layer 0. Here’s how to change the current layer:
	
1.	 Press the Esc key to clear any selections, and then click the layer drop-down list on the 
Home tab’s Layers panel.
The list shows you all of the layers available in the drawing. Notice the icons that appear 
next to the layer names; they control the status of the layer. You’ll learn how to work with 
these icons later in this chapter. Also notice the box directly to the left of each layer name. 
This shows you the color of the corresponding layer.
Momentarily placing the cursor on an icon in the layer drop-down list displays a tool tip 
that describes the icon’s purpose.
	
2.	 Click the Jamb layer name. The drop-down list closes and the name Jamb appears in the 
panel’s layer name box. Jamb is now the current layer.
Controlling Colors and Linetypes of Blocked Objects
Layer 0 has special importance to blocks. When objects assigned to layer 0 are used as parts of a 
block and that block is inserted on another layer, those objects take on the characteristics of their 
new layer. However, if those objects are on a layer other than layer 0, they maintain their original 
layer characteristics even if you insert or change that block to another layer. For example, suppose 
the tub is drawn on the Door layer instead of on layer 0. If you turn the tub into a block and insert 
it on the Fixture layer, the objects the tub comprises will maintain their assignment to the Door 
layer even though the Tub block is assigned to the Fixture layer.
It may help to think of the block function as a clear plastic bag that holds together the objects that 
make up the tub. The objects inside the bag maintain their assignment to the Door layer even while 
the bag itself is assigned to the Fixture layer. This concept may be a bit confusing at first, but it 
should become clearer after you use blocks for a while.
AutoCAD also enables you to have more than one color or linetype on an object. For example, 
you can use the Color and Linetype drop-down lists in the Properties palette to alter the color or 
linetype of an object on layer 0. That object then maintains its assigned color and linetype—no 
matter what its layer assignment. Likewise, objects specifically assigned a color or linetype aren’t 
affected by their inclusion in blocks.

Organizing Information with Layers |  159  
You can also use the Layer command to reset the current layer. To do this using the key-
board, enter -Layer↵S↵ and then type Jamb↵↵.
	
3.	 Zoom in on the door and draw a 5″ line; start at the lower-right corner of the door, and 
draw toward the right. Metric users should draw a 13 cm line.
	
4.	 Draw a similar line from the top-right end of the arc. Your drawing should look like 
Figure 5.6.
Break the wall line at this intersection.
Jambs
Break the wall line at this intersection.
Figure 5.6
Door at wall with 
doorjambs added
Because you assigned the color green to the Jamb layer, on your own screen you’ll see that 
the two lines you just drew to represent the doorjambs are green. This gives you a visual cue 
about which layer you’re on as you draw.
Now you’ll use the part of the wall between the jambs as a line representing the door header 
(the part of the wall above the door). To do this, you’ll have to cut the line into three line seg-
ments and then change the layer assignment of the segment between the jambs:
	
1.	 Click the Break At Point tool in the Home tab’s expanded Modify panel.
	
2.	 At the Select object: prompt, click the wall between the two jambs.

160  | CHAPTER 5  Keeping Track of Layers and Blocks   
	
3.	 At the Specify first break point: prompt, use the Endpoint osnap override to pick 
the endpoint of the door’s arc that is touching the wall, as shown previously in Figure 5.6.
	
4.	 Click Break At Point on the expanded Modify panel again, and then repeat steps 2 and 3, this 
time using the jamb near the door hinge location to locate the break point (see Figure 5.6).
Although it may not be obvious, you’ve just broken the right-side wall line into three line seg-
ments: one at the door opening and two more on either side of the jambs. You can also use the 
Break tool (below the Break At Point tool) to produce a gap in a line segment.
The Break At Point tool won’t work on a circle. You can, however, use the Break tool to place a 
small gap in the circle. If you create a small enough gap, the circle will still look like a full circle.
Next you’ll change the Layer property of the line between the two jambs to the Ceiling layer. 
However, instead of using the Properties palette as you’ve done in earlier exercises, you’ll use a 
shortcut method:
	
1.	 Click the line between the doorjambs to highlight it. Notice that the layer listing in the 
Layers panel changes to Wall. Whenever you select an object to expose its grips, the 
Object Color, Linetype, Lineweight, and Plot Style listings in the Properties panel change 
to reflect those properties of the selected object.
	
2.	 Click the layer name in the Layers panel to open the layer drop-down list.
	
3.	 Click the Ceiling layer. The list closes and the line you selected changes to the magenta 
color, showing you that it’s now on the Ceiling layer. Also notice that the Object Color list 
in the Properties panel changes to reflect the new color for the line.
	
4.	 Press the Esc key twice to clear the grip selection. Notice that the layer returns to Jamb, 
the current layer.
	
5.	 Click the Zoom Previous tool from the Zoom flyout in the Navigation bar. You can also 
enter Z↵P↵.
In this exercise, you saw that when you select an object with no command active, the object’s 
properties are immediately displayed in the Properties palette under Object Color, Linetype, 
and Lineweight. Using this method, you can also change an object’s color, linetype, and line-
weight independent of its layer. Just as with the Properties palette, you can select multiple 
objects and change their layers through the layer drop-down list. These options in the Home 
tab’s Properties panel offer a quick way to edit some of the properties of objects.
Now you’ll finish the bathroom by adding a sink to a layer named Casework:
	
1.	 Open the Layer Properties Manager, and create a new layer called Casework.
	
2.	 With the Casework layer selected in the layer list, click the Set Current button at the top 
of the palette.
	
3.	 Click the color swatch for the Casework layer listing, and then select Blue from the Select 
Color dialog box. Click OK to exit the dialog box.
	
4.	 Click X in the Layer Properties Manager palette. Notice that the layer drop-down list in 
the Layers panel indicates that the current layer is Casework.
Next you’ll add the sink. As you draw, the objects will appear in blue, the color of the 
Casework layer.

Organizing Information with Layers |  161  
	
5.	 Choose Zoom All from the Zoom flyout on the Navigation bar, or type Z↵A↵.
	
6.	 Click the Insert tool on the Home tab’s Block panel, More Options, and then click the 
Browse button in the Insert dialog box to open the Select Drawing File dialog box.
	
7.	 Locate the sink.dwg file that you drew in the previous chapter, or the sample from this 
book’s companion web page, and double-click it.
	
8.	 In the Insert dialog box, make sure that the Specify On-Screen options in both the Scale 
and Rotation groups aren’t selected; then click OK.
	
9.	 Place the sink roughly in the upper-right corner of the bathroom plan, and then use the 
Move command to place it accurately in the corner, as shown in Figure 5.7.
Counter and sink

Controlling Layer Visibility
We mentioned earlier that you’ll sometimes want to display only certain layers to work within a 
drawing. A door header is in this bathroom that would normally appear only in a reflected ceil-
ing plan. To turn off a layer so that it becomes invisible, you click the lightbulb icon in the Layer 
Properties Manager, as shown in these steps:
	
1.	 Open the Layer Properties Manager by clicking the Layer Properties tool in the Layers panel.
	
2.	 Click the Ceiling layer in the layer list.

162  | CHAPTER 5  Keeping Track of Layers and Blocks   
	
3.	 Click the lightbulb icon in the layer list next to the Ceiling layer name. The lightbulb icon 
changes from yellow to gray to indicate that the layer is off.
	
4.	 Click the X at the top of the Layer Properties Manager’s title bar to close it. The door 
header (the line across the door opening) disappears because you’ve made it invisible by 
turning off its layer. 
Getting Multiple Uses from a Drawing Using Layers
Layering lets you use a single AutoCAD drawing for multiple purposes. A single drawing can show 
both the general layout of the plan and more detailed information, such as the equipment layout 
and the floor-paving layout.
The following two images are reproductions of the San Francisco Main Library’s lower level and show 
how one floor plan file was used for two purposes. The first view shows the layout of furnishings, and the 
second view shows a paving layout. In each case, the same floor plan file was used, but in the first panel, 
the paving information is on a layer that is turned off. Layers also facilitate the use of differing scales 
in the same drawing. Frequently, a small-scale drawing of an overall plan will contain the same data 
for an enlarged view of other portions of the plan, such as a stairwell or an elevator core. The detailed 
information, such as notes and dimensions, might be on a layer that is turned off for the overall plan.
You can also control layer visibility by using the layer drop-down list on the Layers panel:
	
1.	 On the Home tab’s Layers panel, click the layer drop-down list.
	
2.	 Find the Ceiling layer, and note that its lightbulb icon is gray. This tells you that the layer 
is off and not visible.

Organizing Information with Layers |  163  
	
3.	 Click the lightbulb icon to make it yellow; the door header reappears.
	
4.	 Click the drawing area to close the layer drop-down list.
Figure 5.8 explains the roles of the other icons in the layer drop-down list. The figure also 
shows the Freeze Or Thaw In Current Layout Viewport icon, which appears only when you are 
in a layout. You’ll learn more about layouts in Chapter 15, “Laying Out Your Printer Output.”

When you start to work with layouts in Chapter 8, “Introducing Printing, Plotting, and Layouts,” 
and Chapter 15, you’ll learn about viewports. A viewport is like a custom view of your drawing. 
You can have multiple viewports in a layout, each showing a different part of your drawing. Layer 
properties can be controlled for each viewport independently, so you can set up different linetypes, 
colors, and layer visibility for each viewport.
Finding the Layers You Want
With only a handful of layers, it’s fairly easy to find the layer you want to turn off. It becomes 
much more difficult, however, when the number of layers exceeds a couple of dozen. The 
Layer Properties Manager offers some useful tools to help you find the layers you want 
quickly.
Suppose that you have several layers whose names begin with C, such as C-lights, C-header, 
and C-pattern, and you want to find those layers quickly. You can click the Name button at the 
top of the layer list to sort the layer names in alphabetic order. (Click the Name button again 
to reverse the order.) To select those layers for processing, click the first layer name that starts 
with C, and then scroll down the list until you find the last layer of the group and Shift+click it. 
All of the layers between those layers are selected. If you want to deselect some of those layers, 
hold down the Ctrl key while clicking the layer names that you don’t want to include in your 
selection. Another option is to Ctrl+click the names of other layers you want selected.
The Color and Linetype headings at the top let you sort the list by the color or linetype 
assignments of the layers. Other columns sort the list by status: On/Off, Freeze/Thaw, Lock/
Unlock, and so forth. (See the sidebar “Freeze, Lock, Transparency, and Other Layer Options” 
later in this chapter.)
Now try changing the layer settings again by turning off all the layers except Wall and 
Ceiling, leaving just a simple rectangle. In this exercise, you’ll get a chance to experiment with 
the On/Off options of the Layer Properties Manager:
	
1.	 Click the Layer Properties tool in the Layers panel.
	
2.	 Click the top layer name in the list box; then Shift+click the last layer name. All of the 
layer names are highlighted.

164  | CHAPTER 5  Keeping Track of Layers and Blocks   
Another way to select all of the layers at once in the Layer Properties Manager is to right-
click the layer list and then choose the Select All option from the context menu. If you 
want to clear your selections, right-click the layer list and choose Clear All.
	
3.	 Ctrl+click the Wall and Ceiling layers to deselect them and thus exempt them from your 
next action.
	
4.	 Click the lightbulb icon of any of the highlighted layers.
	
5.	 A message appears, asking if you want the current layer on or off. Select Turn The 
Current Layer Off in the message box. The lightbulb icons turn gray to show that the 
selected layers have been turned off.
	
6.	 Close or minimize the Layer Properties Manager. The drawing now appears with 
only the Wall and Ceiling layers displayed. It looks like a simple rectangle of the room 
outline.
	
7.	 Open the Layer Properties Manager again, select all of the layers as you did in step 2, and 
then click any of the gray lightbulbs to turn on all the layers at once.
	
8.	 Click the X at the top of the Layer Properties Manager’s title bar to close it.
In this exercise, you turned off a set of layers by clicking a lightbulb icon. You can freeze/
thaw, lock/unlock, or change the color of a group of layers in a similar manner by clicking 
the appropriate layer property. For example, clicking a color swatch of one of the selected 
layers opens the Select Color dialog box, in which you can set the color for all the selected 
layers.
Taming an Unwieldy List of Layers
Chances are that you’ll eventually end up with a fairly long list of layers. Managing such a list 
can become a nightmare, but AutoCAD provides some tools to help you organize layers so that 
you can keep track of them more easily.
On the left side of the Layer Properties Manager is a set of tools and a list box designed to 
help you with your layer-management tasks (see Figure 5.9).

Tools in the Layer 
Properties Manager that 
help you manage your layers

Organizing Information with Layers |  165  
In the upper-left corner of the palette is a toolbar with three tools:
New Property Filter Tool    Lets you filter your list of layers to display only layers with cer-
tain properties, such as specific colors or names.
New Group Filter Tool    Lets you create named groups of layers that can be quickly recalled 
at any time. This tool is helpful if you often work with specific sets of layers. For example, 
you might have a set of layers in an architectural drawing that pertains to the electrical 
layout. You could create a group filter called Electrical that filters out all layers except those 
pertaining to the electrical layout. The filters don’t affect the layers in any way; they just limit 
which layers are displayed in the main layer list.
Layer States Manager Tool    Lets you create sets of layer states. For example, if you want to 
save the layer settings that have only the Wall and Door layers turned on, you can do so by 
using this tool.
Freeze, Lock, Transparency, and Other Layer Options
You may have noticed the Freeze and Thaw icons in the Layer Properties Manager. These options are 
similar to On and Off icons. However, Freeze not only makes layers invisible; it also tells AutoCAD to 
ignore the contents of those layers when you select the All response at the Select objects: prompt. 
Freezing layers can save time when you issue a command that regenerates a complex drawing. This is 
because AutoCAD ignores objects on frozen layers during a drawing regen. You’ll get firsthand experi-
ence with Freeze and Thaw in Chapter 7, “Mastering Viewing Tools, Hatches, and External References.”
Another pair of Layer Properties Manager options, Lock and Unlock, offers functionality similar 
to Freeze and Thaw. If you lock a layer, you can view and snap to objects on that layer, but you can’t 
edit those objects. This feature is useful when you’re working on a crowded drawing and you don’t 
want to edit portions of it accidentally. You can lock all of the layers except those you intend to edit 
and then proceed to work without fear of making accidental changes. The expanded Layers Ribbon 
panel offers a Locked Layer Fading slider that allows you to distinguish locked layers more easily 
by fading them. The slider does not affect plotter output because it is only a visual aid to use when 
you are editing your drawings.
Three more options—Lineweight, Plot Style, and Plot—offer control over the appearance of printer 
or plotter output. Lineweight lets you control the width of lines in a layer. Plot Style lets you 
assign plotter configurations to specific layers. (You’ll learn more about plot styles in Bonus Chap­
ter 5, “Understanding Plot Styles,” available at www.omura.com/chapters.) Use the Plot option 
to specify whether you want a layer to be printed in hard-copy output. This can be useful for 
setting up layers you may use for layout purposes only. The Linetype option allows you to control 
line patterns, such as dashed or center lines.
Transparency enables you to make a layer transparent. You can enter a value from 0, which is com-
pletely opaque, to 90, which is the maximum transparency allowed. After setting the transparency 
value, you may need to enter Re↵ to regenerate the drawing and see the transparency of the layer.
Finally, you can save layer settings for later recall by using the Layer States Manager tool in the 
upper-left corner of the Layer Properties Manager. This feature is extremely useful when you want 
to save different layer combinations. Chapter 14, “Advanced Editing and Organizing,” shows you 
how to use this feature. This option is also accessible from the stAte option in the command-line 
version of the Layer command.

166  | CHAPTER 5  Keeping Track of Layers and Blocks   
Filtering Layers by Their Properties
Below the New Property Filter, New Group Filter, and Layer States Manager tools is a filter list, 
which is a hierarchical list displaying the different sets of layer properties and group filters. 
Right now, you don’t have any filters in place, so you see only All and All Used Layers.
In this section, you’ll learn how the tools and the filter list box work. You’ll start with a look 
at the New Property Filter tool:
	
1.	 Open the Layer Properties Manager by clicking the Layer Properties tool in the Layers 
panel.
	
2.	 Click the New Property Filter tool in the upper-left corner of the Layer Properties 
Manager to open the Layer Filter Properties dialog box. You see two list boxes. The Filter 
Definition list box at the top is where you enter your filter criteria. The Filter Preview list 
box below is a preview of your layer list based on the filter options. Right now, there are 
no filter options, so the Filter Preview list shows all the layers.
	
3.	 In the Filter Definition list box, click the blank box just below the Color label. A button 
appears in the box (see Figure 5.10).
Figure 5.10
The Layer Filter 
Properties dialog box
	
4.	 Click in the blank box again; then enter red↵. The Filter Preview changes to show only 
layers that are red. In the current drawing, only one layer has been assigned the color red.
	
5.	 Click twice in the blank box below the one you just edited. Again, a button appears.
	
6.	 This time, enter green↵. The layers that are green appear in the Filter Preview list.
You can also select a color from the Select Color dialog box by clicking the button that 
appears in the box.
	
7.	 In the Filter Definition list, click in the Name column in the third row down. A cursor 
appears followed by an asterisk.

Organizing Information with Layers |  167  
	
8.	 Type F. Two new layers that have names beginning with F are added to the Filter Preview 
list.
	
9.	 In the Filter Name text box at the upper-left corner of the dialog box, change the name 
Properties Filter1 to My List, and then click OK.
Now you see the My List filter in the list box on the left side of the Layer Properties 
Manager.
The layer list shows only the layers that have properties conforming to those you selected in 
the Layer Filter Properties dialog box. Notice that My List is highlighted in the filter list to the 
left. This tells you that My List is the current layer property filter being applied to the layer list 
to the right.
You can change the layer list display by selecting different options in the filter list. Try these 
steps:
	
1.	 Click the All option in the filter list at the left side of the dialog box. The layer list to the 
right changes to display all the layers in the drawing. Also note that a brief description of 
the current layer filter is displayed at the bottom of the dialog box.
	
2.	 Click the All Used Layers option in the filter list. Now all the layers continue to be 
displayed.
	
3.	 Click My List. The layer list changes back to the limited set of layers from your filter list.
	
4.	 Double-click My List. The Layer Filter Properties dialog box opens and displays the list of 
layer properties that you set up earlier for My List. You can edit the criteria for your filter 
by making modifications in this dialog box.
	
5.	 Click Cancel to exit the Layer Filter Properties dialog box.
Creating Layer Groups
The preceding exercise shows how you can filter out layer names based on the properties that 
you specify in the Layer Filter Properties dialog box. But suppose you want to create a layer  

168  | CHAPTER 5  Keeping Track of Layers and Blocks   
filter list by graphically selecting objects on the screen. You can use the New Group Filter tool to 
do just that:
	
1.	 Click the New Group Filter tool in the upper-left corner of the Layer Properties Manager, 
and then press ↵ to accept the default name for the group. You see a new listing appear 
called Group Filter1.
	
2.	 Right-click the Group Filter1 listing to the left, and then choose Select Layers ➢ Add from 
the context menu. Notice that your cursor is now a Pickbox cursor.
	
3.	 Click a line representing a wall of the bathroom; then click the door. Press ↵ when you’re 
finished with your selection. The layers of the two objects you selected are displayed in 
the layer list. Also note that Group Filter1 is highlighted in the filter list to the left.
You may have noticed the Select Layers ➢ Replace option in the context menu in step 2. This 
option lets you completely replace an existing group filter with a new selection set. It works just 
like the Select Layers ➢ Add option. You can also click and drag layers from the All layer list to 
the group filter list name in the left column.
Earlier you saw how you can double-click a properties filter to edit a properties filter list. But 
group filters work in a slightly different way. If you want to add layers to your group filter, you 
can click and drag them from the layer list to the group filter name. Here’s how it’s done:
	
1.	 In the Layer Properties Manager, select All from the filter list to the left.
	
2.	 Click the Fixture layer in the layer list; then Ctrl+click the Jamb layer in the list. These are 
the layers that you’ll add to the Group Filter1 layer group.
	
3.	 Click and drag the Fixture and Jamb layers to the Group Filter1 listing in the filter list.
	
4.	 To check the addition to Group Filter1, click it in the filter list. The Fixture and Jamb lay-
ers have been added to the Group Filter1 list.
If you want to delete a layer from a group filter, you can use the context menu, as shown in 
these steps:
	
1.	 With the Group Filter1 list selected, select the Jamb layer from the layer list and then 
right-click it.
	
2.	 Select Remove From Group Filter from the context menu. (Make sure that you don’t select 
Delete Layer.) Jamb is removed from the Group Filter1 list.
You can also convert a layer property filter into a group filter. Select the layer property filter 
from the filter list, right-click, and then select Convert To Group Filter. The icon for the layer 
property filter changes to a group filter icon, indicating that it’s now a group filter.
You’ve seen how you can add property and group filters to the Layer Properties Manager by 
using the tools on the left side of the palette. One tool that you haven’t explored yet is the Layer 

Organizing Information with Layers |  169  
States Manager. To understand how this tool works, you’ll need to learn a little more about 
AutoCAD; look for a discussion of the Layer States Manager in Chapter 14.
Before you move on, you’ll want to know about a few other options that appear in the Layer 
Properties Manager (see Figure 5.11).

The Invert Filter Check Box    Located at the bottom of the Filters list, this option changes 
the list of layers to show all layers excluding those in the selected filter. For example, if the My 
List filter contains layers that are red and you select Invert Filter, the layer list will display all 
layers except those that are red.
The Refresh Tool    Located in the upper-right corner, this tool updates the layer information 
in the Layer Properties Manager.
The Settings Button    Located in the upper-right corner, the Settings button opens the Layer 
Settings dialog box. This dialog box controls the way that you’re notified when new layers 
are added to a drawing (see Figure 5.12).
In the next section, you’ll find some tips for how to use layer names so that you can use text 
filters more effectively.
Naming Layers to Stay Organized
In the previous section, you saw how to create a layer property filter by using the name of a 
layer. If you name layers carefully, you can use them as a powerful layer-management tool. For 
example, suppose that you have a drawing whose layer names are set up to help you easily iden-
tify floor-plan data versus ceiling-plan data, as in the following list:
◆
◆
A-FP-WALL-JAMB
◆
◆
A-FP-WIND-JAMB
◆
◆
A-CP-WIND-HEAD
◆
◆
A-CP-DOOR-HEAD
◆
◆
L-FP-CURB
◆
◆
C-FP-ELEV

170  | CHAPTER 5  Keeping Track of Layers and Blocks   
The first character in the layer name designates the discipline related to that layer: A for 
architectural, L for landscape, and C for civil. In this example, layers with names containing the 
two characters FP signify floor-plan layers. CP designates ceiling-plan information.
These layer examples are loosely based on a layer-naming convention devised by the 
American Institute of Architects (AIA). As you can see from this example, careful naming of 
layers can help you manage them.
If you want to isolate only those layers that have to do with floor plans, regardless of their 
discipline, enter ??FP* in the Name column of the Layer Filter Properties dialog box (see 
Figure 5.13). You can then give this layer property filter the name Floor Plan by entering Floor 
Plan in the Filter Name text box.
After you’ve created the Floor Plan layer properties list, you can pick Floor Plan from the 
filter list on the right side of the Layer Properties Manager, and only those layers with names 
containing the letters FP as their third and fourth characters will appear in the list of layers. You 
can turn off all of these layers, change their color assignment, or change other settings quickly 
without having to wade through layers you don’t want to touch. You can create other filter prop-
erties to isolate other groups of layers. AutoCAD keeps these filter lists for future use until you 
delete them by using the Delete option in the context menu. (Right-click the name of the prop-
erty filter and choose Delete.)
Figure 5.12
The Layer Settings dialog box

Organizing Information with Layers |  171  
In the ??FP* example, the question marks (??) tell AutoCAD that the first two characters 
in the layer name can be anything. The FP tells AutoCAD that the layer name must contain 
F and P in these two places of the name. The asterisk (*) at the end tells AutoCAD that the 
remaining characters can be anything. The question marks and asterisk are known as wild-
card characters. They’re commonly used filtering tools for the Unix, Linux, and Windows 
operating systems.
As the number of layers in a drawing grows, you’ll find layer filters an indispensable tool. 
Bear in mind, however, that the successful use of layer filters can depend on a careful layer-
naming convention. If you’re producing architectural plans, you may want to consider the AIA 
layer-naming guidelines.
Assigning Linetypes to Layers
You’ll often want to use different linetypes to show hidden lines, center lines, fence lines, 
or other noncontinuous lines. You can assign a color and a linetype to a layer. You then see 
International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and complex linetypes, including lines 
that can be used to illustrate gas and water lines in civil work or batt insulation in a wall 
cavity.
AutoCAD comes with several linetypes, as shown in Figure 5.14. ISO linetypes are designed 
to be used with specific plotted line widths and linetype scales. For example, if you’re using 
a pen width of 0.5 mm, set the linetype scale of the drawing to 0.5 as well. (See Chapter 15 for 
more information on plotting and linetype scale.) You can also create your own linetypes (see 
Chapter 25, “Managing and Sharing Your Drawings”).
Linetypes that contain text, such as the gas line sample at the bottom of Figure 5.14, use the 
current text height and font to determine the size and appearance of the text displayed in the 
line. A text height of 0 displays the text properly in most cases. See Chapter 9, “Adding Text to 
Drawings,” for more on text styles.

172  | CHAPTER 5  Keeping Track of Layers and Blocks   
AutoCAD stores linetype descriptions in an external file named Acad.lin, or Acadiso.lin 
for metric users. You can edit this file in a text editor like Notepad to create new linetypes or to 
modify existing ones. You’ll see how this is done in Chapter 24, “Customizing Toolbars, Menus, 
Linetypes, and Hatch Patterns.”
Adding a Linetype to a Drawing
To see how linetypes work, you’ll add a DASHDOT line in the bathroom plan to indicate a 
shower curtain rod:
	
1.	 Open the Layers Properties Manager, and select All from the filter list.
	
2.	 Click New Layer, and then type Pole↵ to create a new layer called Pole.
	
3.	 Change the color of the Pole layer to Black/White.
If you’re in a hurry, you can simultaneously load a linetype and assign it to a layer by 
using the Layer command. In this exercise, you enter -Layer↵ at the Command prompt. 
Then enter L↵, DASHDOT↵, and Pole↵, and press ↵ to exit the Layer command.
	
4.	 In the Pole layer listing, under the Linetype column, click the word Continuous to open 
the Select Linetype dialog box. To find the Linetype column, you may need to scroll the 
list to the right by using the scroll bar at the bottom of the list (see Figure 5.15).
The word Continuous truncates to Contin when the Linetype column is at its default width 
and the Continuous option is selected.

5.	 The Select Linetype dialog box offers a list of linetypes from which to choose. In a new 
file, such as the Bath file, only one linetype is available by default. You must load any 
additional linetypes you want to use. Click the Load button at the bottom of the dialog 
box to open the Load Or Reload Linetypes dialog box. Notice that the list of linetype 
names is similar to the layer drop-down list. You can sort the names alphabetically or 
by description by clicking the Linetype or Description heading at the top of the list (see 
Figure 5.16).

6.	 In the Available Linetypes list, scroll down to locate the DASHDOT linetype, click it, and 
then click OK. Do not select the ISO dash dot linetype that appears in the first part of the 
list.
Notice that the DASHDOT linetype is added to the linetypes available in the Select 
Linetype dialog box.
	
7.	 Click DASHDOT to highlight it; then click OK. DASHDOT appears in the Pole layer list-
ing under Linetype.
	
8.	 With the Pole layer still highlighted, click the Set Current button to make the Pole layer 
current.

174  | CHAPTER 5  Keeping Track of Layers and Blocks   
	
9.	 Exit the Layer Properties Manager.
	
10.	 Click the Line tool in the Home tab’s Draw panel.
	
11.	 Enter 4´4,1´10↵ for the first point and #4´4,6´10↵ for the second point of the line. Metric 
users should enter 133,56↵ for the first point and #133,208↵ for the second point. The # sign 
before the second coordinate is needed when Dynamic Input is active, and it tells AutoCAD 
that the second coordinate is an absolute coordinate and not relative to the last point.
	
12.	 Press ↵ to finish the line.
Controlling Linetype Scale
Although you’ve designated this as a DASHDOT line, it appears solid. Zoom in to a small part 
of the line and you’ll see that the line is indeed as you specified.
Because your current drawing is at a scale of 1″ = 1′, you must adjust the scale of your linetypes 
accordingly. This too is accomplished in the Linetype Manager dialog box. Here are the steps:
	
1.	 Click the Linetype drop-down list in the Home tab’s Properties panel and select Other.
	
2.	 The Linetype Manager dialog box opens. Click the Show Details button in the upper-right 
corner of the dialog box. Some additional options appear at the bottom (see Figure 5.17).
The Linetype Manager dialog box offers Load and Delete buttons that let you load or 
delete a linetype directly without having to go through a particular layer’s linetype setting.
	
3.	 Double-click the Global Scale Factor text box, and then type 12. This is the scale conver-
sion factor for a 1″ = 1′ scale (see the discussion of scale factors in Chapter 3, “Setting Up 
and Using the Drafting Tools”). If you are a metric user and the line appears solid, set the 
Global Scale Factor to 30.
	
4.	 Click OK. The drawing regenerates and the shower curtain rod is displayed in the line-
type and at the scale you designated.
	
5.	 Click the Zoom Previous tool from the Navigation bar or the Previous tool from the View 
tab’s Navigate 2D panel so that your drawing looks like Figure 5.18.
You can also use the Ltscale system variable to set the linetype scale. Type LTSCALE↵, and 
at the Enter new linetype scale factor <1.0000>: prompt, enter 12↵.

Linetypes Troubleshooting
If you change the linetype of a layer or an object but the object remains a continuous line, check 
the Ltscale system variable. It should be set to your drawing scale factor. If this doesn’t work, 
set the Viewres system variable to a higher value (see Appendix B, “Installing and Setting Up 
AutoCAD”). Viewres can also be set by the Arc And Circle Smoothness option in the Display tab of 
the Options dialog box. The behavior of linetype scales depends on whether you’re in model space 
or in a drawing layout. If your efforts to control linetype scale have no effect on your linetype’s 
visibility, you may be in a drawing layout. See Chapter 15 for more on model space and layouts.

176  | CHAPTER 5  Keeping Track of Layers and Blocks   
Adding the Final Detail
If you’re working through the tutorial, your final task is to set up an insertion point for the cur-
rent drawing to facilitate its insertion into other drawings in the future. Follow these steps:
	
1.	 Type BASE↵.
	
2.	 At the Enter base point <0′-0″,0′-0″,0′-0″>: prompt, use the Endpoint object snap to 
pick the upper-left corner of the bathroom. The bathroom drawing is complete.
	
3.	 Click the Save tool in the Quick Access toolbar to record your work up to now.
Controlling Lineweights
You may have noticed a Lineweight column in the Layer Properties Manager. If you click this 
option for a given layer, the Lineweight dialog box opens, which enables you to control the plot-
ted thickness of your lines. Plotted lineweights can also be set through direct object property 
assignment. You can view lineweights as they will appear in your final plot by making setting 
changes in the Lineweight Settings dialog box, which you’ll learn about in Chapter 15.
Remember that if you assign a linetype to a layer, everything you draw on that layer will be of 
that linetype. This includes arcs, polylines, and circles. As explained in the sidebar “Assigning Colors, 
Linetypes, and Linetype Scales to Individual Objects” later in this chapter, you can also assign differ-
ent colors and linetypes to individual objects rather than relying on their layer assignment to define 
color and linetype. However, you may want to avoid assigning colors and linetypes directly to objects 
until you have some experience with AutoCAD and a good grasp of your drawing’s organization.
In the previous exercise, you changed the global linetype scale setting. This affects all non-
continuous linetypes within the current drawing. You can also set the default linetype scale for 
all new objects with the Current Object Scale option in the Linetype Manager dialog box.
When individual objects are assigned a linetype scale, they’re still affected by the global line-
type scale set by the Ltscale system variable. For example, say you assign a linetype scale of 2 
to the curtain rod in the previous example. This scale is then multiplied by the global linetype 
scale of 12, for a final linetype scale of 24.
You can also set the default linetype scale for individual objects by using the Celtscale sys-
tem variable. After it’s set, only newly created objects are affected. You must use the Properties 
palette to change the linetype scale of individual existing objects.
If the objects you draw appear in a different linetype from that of the layer on which they’re 
located, check the default linetype by selecting Other from the Linetype drop-down list on the 
Home tab’s Properties panel. Then, in the Linetype Manager dialog box, highlight ByLayer in 
the Linetype list and click the Current button. In addition, check the linetype scale of the object 
itself by using the Properties palette. A different linetype scale can make a line appear to have 
an assigned linetype that might not be what you expect. (See the sidebar “Assigning Colors, 
Linetypes, and Linetype Scales to Individual Objects.”)
Linetypes in Layouts
A system variable called Psltscale affects how layout viewports display linetypes. When the 
Psltscale system variable is set to 1, layout viewports display linetypes at the Ltscale setting, 
which is usually incorrect for the 1-to-1 scale of the layout. When Psltscale is set to 0, linetypes 
appear in layout viewports in the same way that they appear in the Model tab.

Keeping Track of Blocks and Layers |  177  
With the Lineweight option and Lineweight Settings dialog box, you have greater control 
over the look of your drawings. This can save time because you don’t have to print your draw-
ing just to check for lineweights. You’ll be able to see how thick or thin your lines are as you edit 
your drawing. You’ll get a chance to delve into lineweights in Chapter 15.
Keeping Track of Blocks and Layers
The Insert dialog box and the Layer Properties Manager let you view the blocks and layers 
available in your drawing by listing them in a window. The Layer Properties Manager also 
includes information about the status of layers. However, you may forget the layer on which an 
object resides. You’ve seen how the Properties option on the context menu shows you the prop-
erties of an object. The List tool in the Properties panel also enables you to get information about 
individual objects.
Use these steps to see an alternate way to view the properties of a block:
	
1.	 Click the List tool from the Home tab’s expanded Properties panel.
If you just want to check quickly to see where an object is located, click it. Its layer will 
appear in the layer drop-down list of the Layers panel.
	
2.	 At the Select objects: prompt, click the Tub block and then press ↵ to open the 
AutoCAD Text Window.
	
3.	 The Command window expands to display a list that shows not only the layer on which 
the tub is located, but also its space, insertion point, name, rotation angle, and scale. If the 
Command window is in its docked position, the AutoCAD Text Window appears with the list.
The information in the expanded Command window or the AutoCAD Text Window, except 
the handle listing, is duplicated in the Properties palette. However, having the data in the 
Command window or Text Window gives you the flexibility to record it in a text file in case you 
need to store data about parts of your drawing. You can also use the AutoCAD Text Window to 
access and store other types of data regarding your drawings.
The Space property listed for the Tub block designates whether the object resides in model 
space or paper space. You’ll learn more about these spaces in Chapter 8 and Chapter 15.
Getting a Text File List of Layers or Blocks
With complex drawings, it can be helpful to get a text file that lists the layers or blocks in 
your drawing. You can do this by using the log-file feature in AutoCAD. At the Command 
prompt, enter Logfilemode↵ and then enter 1↵. Type -La↵?↵↵ (don’t forget the hyphen at the 
beginning of the La command). If your list of layers is extensive, you may be asked to press 
Certiﬁcation
Objective

178  | CHAPTER 5  Keeping Track of Layers and Blocks   
Once the log-file feature is closed, you can use Windows Notepad to open the AutoCAD log 
file located in the C:\Users\User Name\AppData\Local\Autodesk\AutoCAD 2017\R20.1\
enu\ folder. You’ll need to change the Text Document (*.txt) option to All Files. The name of the 
log file will start with the name of the current drawing, followed by a series of numbers and the 
.log filename extension, as in 04c-bath-metric_1_1_6500.log.
If you have difficulty finding the log file, enter (getvar “logfilepath”) at the AutoCAD 
Command prompt to get a listing of the log-file location. The log file may also be in a hidden 
↵ to continue. Do so. Your list of layers appears in the AutoCAD Text Window. For a list of 
blocks, enter -Insert↵?↵↵ . When you’ve obtained your list, close the log-file feature by typing 
Logfilemode↵0↵.
Assigning Colors, Linetypes, and Linetype Scales to Individual 
Objects
If you prefer, you can set up AutoCAD to assign specific colors and linetypes to objects instead of 
having objects take on the color and linetype settings of the layer on which they reside. Normally, 
objects are given a default color and linetype called ByLayer, which means that each object takes 
on the color or linetype of its assigned layer. (You’ve probably noticed the word ByLayer in the 
Properties panel and in various dialog boxes and tool palettes.)
Use the Properties panel to change the color or linetype of existing objects. This panel lets you set 
the properties of individual objects. For new objects, use the Object Color drop-down list on the 
Properties panel to set the current default color to red (for example) instead of ByLayer. Then every-
thing you draw will be red, regardless of the current layer color. The Object Color drop-down list also 
offers a Select Colors option that opens the Select Color dialog box you saw earlier in this chapter.
For linetypes, you can use the Linetype drop-down list in the Properties panel to select a default 
linetype for all new objects. The list shows only linetypes that have already been loaded into the 
drawing, so you must first load a linetype before you can select it.
Another possible color and linetype assignment is ByBlock, which you also set with the Properties 
panel. ByBlock makes everything you draw white until you turn your drawing into a block and then 
insert the block on a layer with an assigned color. The objects then take on the color of that layer. 
This behavior is similar to that of objects drawn on layer 0. The ByBlock linetype works similarly 
to the ByBlock color.
You can set an object or set of objects to ByLayer or ByBlock using the SETBYLAYER command. 
Click the Set To ByLayer tool in the Home tab’s expanded Modify panel or type SETBYLAYER↵, 
select the objects that you want to modify, and follow the prompt.
Finally, if you want to set the linetype scale for each individual object instead of relying on the 
global linetype scale (the Ltscale system variable), you can use the Properties palette to modify 
the linetype scale of individual objects. In place of using the Properties palette, you can set the 
Celtscale system variable to the linetype scale you want for new objects.
As mentioned earlier, stay away from assigning colors and linetypes to individual objects until 
you’re comfortable with AutoCAD; even then, use color and linetype assignments carefully. Other 
users who work on your drawing may have difficulty understanding your drawing’s organization 
if you assign color and linetype properties indiscriminately.

The Bottom Line |  179  
The Bottom Line
Organize information with layers.    Layers are perhaps the most powerful feature in 
AutoCAD. They help to keep drawings well organized, and they give you control over the 
visibility of objects. They also let you control the appearance of your drawing by setting  
colors, lineweights, and linetypes.
Master It    Describe the process of creating a layer.
Control layer visibility.    When a drawing becomes dense with information, it can be dif-
ficult to edit. If you’ve organized your drawing using layers, you can reduce its complexity by 
turning off layers that aren’t important to your current session.
Master It    Describe at least two methods for hiding a layer.
Keep track of blocks and layers.    At times, you may want a record of the layers or blocks in 
your drawing. You can create a list of layers using the log-file feature in AutoCAD.
Master It    Where do you go to turn on the log-file feature?
folder, so you may have to turn off the hidden folder setting in File Explorer. See Appendix B for 
instructions on how to do this.
With the log-file feature, you can record virtually anything that appears at the Command 
prompt. You can even record an entire AutoCAD session. The log file can also be helpful in 
constructing script files to automate tasks. (See Chapter 24 for more information on scripts.) If 
you want a hard copy of the log file, print it from an application such as Windows Notepad or 
your favorite word processor.
Using Excel to Analyze Large Layer Lists
You may encounter a drawing that has a very long list of layers. To help you analyze the layers in 
a drawing, you can copy the layer list into Microsoft Excel by doing the following: Open the Layer 
Properties Manager and press Ctrl+A to select the entire layer list. Press Ctrl+C to copy the list to 
the Clipboard, and then open Excel. Press Ctrl+V to paste the list into Excel.

Editing and Reusing Data to Work 
Efficiently 
If you’re an experienced drafter, you know that you frequently have to draw the same item 
several times in many drawings. The AutoCAD® 2017 software offers a variety of ways to reuse 
existing geometry, thereby automating much of the repetitive work usually associated with 
manual drafting. That’s why at least five commands are devoted to duplicating objects—ten if 
you include the grips options.
In this chapter, as you finish drawing the studio apartment unit, you’ll explore some of the 
ways to exploit existing files and objects while constructing your drawing. For example, you’ll 
use existing files as prototypes for new files, eliminating the need to set up layers, scales, and 
sheet sizes for similar drawings. With AutoCAD, you can also duplicate objects in multiple 
arrays. In Chapter 3, “Setting Up and Using the Drafting Tools,” you saw how to use the object 
snap (osnap) overrides on objects to locate points for drawing complex forms. This chapter 
describes other ways of using lines to aid your drawing.
Because you’ll begin to use the Zoom command more in the exercises in this chapter, you’ll 
review this command as you go along. You’ll also discover the Pan command, another tool to 
help you get around in your drawing.
You’re already familiar with many of the commands you’ll use to draw the apartment unit. 
So, rather than going through every step of the drawing process, the exercises will sometimes 
ask you to copy the drawing from a figure and, using notes and dimensions as guides, put objects 
on the indicated layers. If you have trouble remembering a command you’ve already learned, 
go back and review the appropriate section of the book.

Creating and Using Templates
Most programs today include what are called templates. A template is a file that is already set up 
for a specific application. For example, in your word processor, you might want to set up a docu-
ment with a logo, a return address, and a date so that you don’t have to add these elements each 
time you create a letter. You might also want to format invoices in a slightly different way. You 
can set up a template for the needs of each type of document. That way, you don’t have to spend 
time reformatting each new document you create.
Similarly, AutoCAD offers templates, which are drawing files that contain custom settings 
designed for a particular function. Out of the box, AutoCAD has templates for ISO, ANSI, DIN, 
GB, and JIS standard drawing formats that include generic title blocks. But you aren’t limited 
to these “canned” templates. You can create your own templates for your particular style and 
method of drawing.
If you find that you use a particular drawing setup frequently, you can turn one or more of 
your typical drawings into a template. For example, you might want to create a set of drawings 
with the same scale and sheet size as an existing drawing. By turning a frequently used draw-
ing into a template, you can save a lot of setup time for subsequent drawings.
Creating a Template
The following exercise guides you through creating and using a template drawing for your stu-
dio’s kitchenette. Because the kitchenette will use the same layers, settings, scale, and sheet size 
as the bathroom drawing, you can use the Bath file as a prototype. Follow these steps:
	
1.	 Start AutoCAD in the usual way.
	
2.	 Choose Open from the Quick Access toolbar to open the Select File dialog box.
	
3.	 Locate the Bath file you created in the previous chapter. You can also use 06-bath.dwg 
from the companion web page at www.sybex.com/go/masteringautocad2017.
	
4.	 Click the Erase button on the Home tab’s Modify panel, or enter E↵; then type all↵↵. This 
erases all the objects that make up the bathroom, but other elements, such as layers, line-
types, and stored blocks, remain in the drawing.
	
5.	 Choose Save As from the Application menu to open the Save Drawing As dialog box.
	
6.	 Open the File Of Type drop-down list, and select AutoCAD Drawing Template (*.dwt). 
The file list window changes to display the current template files in the \Template\ 
folder.
	
7.	 In the File Name text box, enter the name Arch8x11h. If you’re a metric user, enter the 
name A4plan.
	
8.	 Click Save to open the Template Options dialog box (see Figure 6.1).
	
9.	 Enter the following description: Architectural one-inch scale drawing on 8 1/2 by 11 
inch media. Metric users should enter the description Architectural 1:10 scale drawing 
on A4 media.
	
10.	 Select English or Metric from the Measurement drop-down list, depending on the unit 
system you’re using.

Objective

Creating and Using Templates |  185  
	
11.	 Click the Save All Layers As Reconciled option.
	
12.	 Click OK to save your new file and create a template. The template file you saved becomes 
the current file. (As with other Windows programs, choosing File ➢ Save As makes the 
saved file current.) This exercise shows that you can edit template files just as you would 
regular drawing files.
	
13.	 Close the template file.
Using a Template
Now let’s see how a template is used. You’ll use the template you just created as the basis for a 
new drawing that you’ll work on in this chapter:
	
1.	 Click the New tool from the Quick Access toolbar to open the Select Template dialog box. 
This is a typical file dialog box, which should be familiar to you by now.
	
2.	 In the Select Template list box, click the filename Arch8x11h.dwt. Metric users should 
click the filename A4plan.dwt. Because this file is blank, you won’t see anything in the 
preview window.

Locating the Template Folder
When you choose the AutoCAD Drawing Template option in the Save Drawing As dialog box, 
AutoCAD automatically opens the folder containing the template files. The standard AutoCAD 
installation creates the folder named Template to contain the template files. If you want to place 
your templates in a different folder, you can change the default template location by using the 
Options dialog box (choose Options from the bottom of the Application menu). Click the Files tab, 
double-click to expand Template Settings, and then double-click Drawing Template File Location 
in the list. Double-click the folder name that appears just below Drawing Template File Location; 
then select a new location from the Browse For Folder dialog box that appears.

186  | CHAPTER 6  Editing and Reusing Data to Work Efficiently   
	
3.	 Click Open. It may not be obvious, but your new file is set up with the same architectural 
units and drawing limits as the bathroom drawing. It also contains the Door, Toilet, and 
Tub blocks.
	
4.	 You need to give your new file a name. Choose Save As from the Application menu to 
open the Save Drawing As dialog box. (Make sure that you choose Save As, or you won’t 
get the Save Drawing As dialog box.) Enter Kitchen for the filename, and select the folder 
in which to save your new kitchen file. For example, you can save your file in the My 
Documents folder by clicking the My Documents shortcut in the left column.
	
5.	 Click Save to create the Kitchen file, and close the dialog box.
You’ve created and used your own template file. Later, when you’ve established a comfortable 
working relationship with AutoCAD, you can create a set of templates that are custom-made to 
your particular needs.
However, if you’re in a hurry, you don’t need to create a template every time you want to 
reuse settings from another file. You can use an existing file as the basis or prototype for a 
new file without creating a template. Open the prototype file, and choose Save As from the 
Application menu to create a new version of the file under a new name. You can then edit the 
new version without affecting the original prototype file.
Copying an Object Multiple Times
Let’s explore the tools that let you quickly duplicate objects. In the following sections, you’ll 
begin to draw parts of a small kitchen. The first set of exercises introduces the Array command, 
which you can use to draw the gas burners of a range top.
As you’ll see, an array can be either in a circular pattern, called a polar array, or a matrix of 
columns and rows, called a rectangular array. You can also create arrays that follow a curved or 
straight path, such as a spline curve, arc, or polyline.
Making Circular Copies
To start the range top, first set the layer on which you want to draw, and then draw a circle rep-
resenting the edge of one burner:
	
1.	 Set the current layer to Fixture by selecting Fixture from the layer drop-down list in the 
Home tab’s Layers panel.
Because you used the Bath file as a template, Running Osnap is already turned on for 
Endpoint, Midpoint, and Intersection, but check the running osnap settings to make sure 
that they are turned on.
	
2.	 Click the Center, Radius Circle tool on the Home tab’s Draw panel, or type C↵.
	
3.	 At the Specify center point for circle or [3P/2P/Ttr (tan tan radius)]: 
prompt, pick a point at coordinate 4′,4′. Metric users should pick a point at coordinate 
120,120.
	
4.	 At the Specify radius of circle or [Diameter]: prompt, enter 3↵. Metric users 
should enter 7.6↵. The circle appears.

Now you’re ready to use the Array command to draw the burner grill. You’ll first draw one 
line representing part of the grill and then use the Array command to create the copies:
	
1.	 Zoom into the circle you just drew, and then make sure Snap mode is off by unchecking 
the Snap Mode tool in the status bar.
	
2.	 Draw a 4″ line starting from the coordinate 4′-1″,4′-0″ and ending to the right of that point. 
Metric users should draw a 10 cm line starting at coordinate 122,120 and ending to the 
right of that point.
	
3.	 Adjust your view so it looks similar to Figure 6.2.

You’ve got the basic parts needed to create the burner grill. You’re ready to make multiple 
copies of the line. For this part, you’ll use the Array command:
	
1.	 Make sure Ortho mode is off and Polar Tracking is on.
	
2.	 Click the Polar Array tool from the Array flyout on the Modify panel, as shown in 
Figure 6.3, or type ARRAYPOLAR↵.

the circle perimeter until you see the Center osnap marker. When the marker appears, 
click. A circular array of the line appears.
	
5.	 At the Select grip to edit array or [Associative/Base point/Items/Angle 
between/Fill angle/ROWs/Levels/ROTate items/eXit]<eXit>: prompt, enter I↵ or 
select Items from the command line.
	
6.	 At the Enter number of items in array or [Expression]: prompt, enter 8↵. The 
lines appear evenly spaced in a circular array (see Figure 6.4).

7.	 Press ↵ to exit the Arraypolar command, or if Dynamic Input is on, choose eXit from the 
menu that appears at the cursor. Your drawing should look like Figure 6.4.
Making Row and Column Copies
Now you’ll draw the other three burners of the gas range by creating a rectangular array from 
the burner you just drew. You’ll first zoom back a bit to get a view of a larger area. Then you’ll 
proceed with the Array command.
Follow these steps to zoom back:
	
1.	 Click Zoom Scale from the Navigation bar. You can also type Z↵S↵.
	
2.	 Enter 0.5x↵. Your drawing will look like Figure 6.5.
Figure 6.5
The preceding view 
reduced by a factor 
of 0.5

Copying an Object Multiple Times |  189  
If you’re not too fussy about the amount that you want to zoom out, you can click Out from 
the Zoom flyout on the View tab’s Navigate 2D panel to reduce your view quickly.
Entering 0.5x for the Zoom Scale factor tells AutoCAD that you want a view that reduces the 
width of the current view to fill half of the display area, enabling you to see more of the work 
area. If you specify a scale value greater than 1 (5, for example), you’ll magnify your current 
view. If you leave off the x, your new view will be in relation to the drawing limits rather than 
the current view.
Next you’ll finish the range top. You’ll get a chance to use the Rectangular Array option to 
create three additional burners:
	
1.	 Click the Rectangular Array tool on the Array flyout on the Modify panel, as shown in 
Figure 6.6, or type ARRAYRECT↵.

2.	 Select the entire burner, including the lines and the circle, and then press ↵ to confirm 
your selection.
	
3.	 At the Select grip to edit array or [Associative/Base point/COUnt/Spacing/
COLumns/Rows/Levels/eXit]<eXit>: prompt, type COU↵ or select COUnt from the 
command line.
	
4.	 At the Enter number of columns or [Expression] <4>: prompt, enter 2↵.
	
5.	 At the Enter number of rows or [Expression] <4>: prompt, enter 2↵ again.
	
6.	 To set the array dimensions, type S↵ or select Spacing from the command line.
	
7.	 At the Specify the distance between columns or [Unit cell] <1′-3″>: prompt, 
type 1′-4″↵. Metric users enter 40.6↵.
	
8.	 At the Specify the distance between rows <1′-3″>: prompt, type 1′-2″↵. Metric users 
enter 35.5↵.
	
9.	 Press ↵, or right-click and select the eXit option in the context menu.
	
10.	 The array appears in the drawing, but a few of the array elements are off the top of the 
screen, as shown in Figure 6.7. In the next section, “Fine-Tuning Your View,” you’ll learn 
about the Pan tool, which will enable you to adjust the view so that the array is centered 
in the drawing area.

Quick Array Copies with Grips
Sometimes the Array tool can be overkill if you need to make only a few evenly spaced copies. 
Fortunately, grip editing offers a feature that lets you quickly make evenly spaced copies. Here’s 
how it’s done:
	1.	 Press the Esc key to make sure that you aren’t in the middle of a command; then select the objects 
that you want to copy.
	2.	 Click a grip point as your base point.
	3.	 Right-click and select Move.
	4.	 Ctrl+click a location at which to place a copy of the selected object. This first copy will determine 
the interval distance for additional copies.
	5.	 Continue to hold down the Ctrl key, and select additional points to make copies at regularly spaced 
intervals.
The copies snap to the distance that you indicate with the first Ctrl+click point (in step 4). You can 
use osnaps to select a distance based on the position of another object. Once you’ve made the first 
copy with the Ctrl+click, you can release the Ctrl key to make multiple copies at random intervals. 
Another option is to use PolarSnap while making grip edit copies. With PolarSnap, you can enter 
a specific distance for the intervals.
Fine-Tuning Your View
Back in Figure 6.7, you may have noticed that parts of the burners don’t appear on the display. To 
move the view over so that you can see all the burners, use the Pan command. Pan is similar to 
Zoom in that it changes your view of the drawing. However, Pan doesn’t alter the magnification 
of the view the way Zoom does. Rather, Pan maintains the current magnification while moving 
your view across the drawing, just as you would pan a camera across a landscape.
To activate the Pan command, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Pan tool on the Navigation bar, or type P↵. A small hand-shaped cursor appears 
in place of the AutoCAD cursor.
Certiﬁcation
Objective

Copying an Object Multiple Times |  191  
	
2.	 Place the hand cursor in the center of the drawing area, and then click and drag it down 
and to the left. The view follows the motion of your mouse.
	
3.	 Continue to drag the view until it looks similar to Figure 6.8; then release the mouse 
button.

of the range top
	
4.	 To finish the kitchen, you want a view that shows more of the drawing area. Click the 
Zoom Realtime option in the Navigation bar’s zoom flyout. The cursor changes to the Zoom 
Realtime cursor. The Zoom/Pan context menu also appears when you right-click during 
the Zoom Realtime command.
	
5.	 Place the cursor close to the top of the screen, and click and drag the cursor down to 
zoom out until your view looks like the top panel of Figure 6.9. You may need to click and 
drag the Zoom Realtime cursor a second time to achieve this view.
	
6.	 Right-click again, and choose Exit from the context menu. Press Esc twice to cancel 
the Zoom command. You’re now ready to add more information to the kitchen 
drawing.
You can also exit the Pan or Zoom Realtime command without opening the context menu; 
just press the Esc key twice.
This exercise showed how you can fine-tune your view by easily switching between 
Pan and Zoom Realtime. After you get the hang of these two tools working together, 
you’ll be able to access the best view for your needs quickly. The other options in the 
context menu—Zoom Window, Zoom Original, and Zoom Extents—perform the same 
functions as the options in the Zoom flyout on the View tab’s Navigate 2D panel or in the 
Navigation bar.
The Zoom Window option in the Zoom/Pan context menu functions in a slightly different 
way from the standard Zoom Window option. Instead of clicking two points, you click and drag 
a window across your view.

192  | CHAPTER 6  Editing and Reusing Data to Work Efficiently   
Finishing the Kitchenette
Before you save and close the Kitchen file, you need to do one more thing. You’ll be using this 
drawing as a symbol and inserting it into the overall plan of the studio apartment unit. To facili-
tate accurate placement of the kitchen, you’ll change the location of the base point of this draw-
ing to the upper-left corner of the kitchen. This will then be the drawing’s grip:
	
1.	 Complete the kitchenette as indicated in the bottom panel of Figure 6.9, shown earlier in 
this chapter. As the figure indicates, make sure that you put the kitchenette on the Fixture 
layer. This will help you control the visibility of the kitchenette in future edits of this file. 
Draw the sink roughly as shown in the figure.
	
2.	 Click the Set Base Point tool in the Insert tab’s expanded Block Definition panel.

3.	 At the Enter base point: prompt, pick the upper-left corner of the kitchen, as indicated 
in the bottom image of Figure 6.9. The kitchen drawing is complete.
	
4.	 Select Save from the Quick Access toolbar, but keep the file open because you’ll use it later. 
Using the Copy Command to Create an Array
In the previous section, you learned how you can quickly make an array of objects using the Array 
command. You can also create simple arrays using the Copy command. To see firsthand how this 
works, see “Copying and Editing Attribute Definitions” in Chapter 12, “Using Attributes.”
Array Along a Path
Before you continue with the apartment drawings you’re working on for the main part of the 
tutorial, we’d like to introduce you to one more Array feature. In AutoCAD 2017, you can create 
an array that follows a curved or straight path, such as an arc, spline curve, or complex polyline. 
Try the following exercise to see how it works:
	
1.	 Open the file called seating.dwg. You’ll see a drawing of a chair in the lower-left corner 
along with an arc drawn across the width of the drawing area.
	
2.	 Click the Path Array tool in the Array flyout (see Figure 6.10), or type ARRAYPATH↵.
Figure 6.10
Select the Path Array 
tool from the Array 
flyout on the Home 
tab’s Modify panel.
	
3.	 At the Select objects: prompt, click the chair at the left end of the arc in the drawing 
and then press ↵ (see Figure 6.11).
Figure 6.11
Click the chair at the 
left end of the arc.

194  | CHAPTER 6  Editing and Reusing Data to Work Efficiently   
	
4.	 At the Select Path curve: prompt, select the arc toward the left end.
	
5.	 At the Select grip to edit array or [Associative/Method/Base point/Tangent 
direction/Items/Rows/Levels/Align items/Z direction/eXit] <eXit>: prompt, 
press ↵ to exit the command.
In this exercise, you made an array of a chair that follows the path of an arc. Note that the 
chair had been set up facing away from the center of the arc. In a later exercise, you’ll see how 
you can easily rotate the chairs to face the center.
You could have used a spline curve or polyline (see Chapter 18, “Drawing Curves,” for more 
on spline curves and polylines) instead of the arc and the results would have been similar.
Now suppose that you want to adjust the curvature of your array. This is just a simple matter 
of adjusting the shape of the arc, as in the following steps:
	
1.	 Click the arc to expose its grips.
	
2.	 Click the middle grip, drag it up until the arc dimension shows an Ortho value close to 
30.0000 < 90 degrees, and then click. The array of chairs follows the arc (see Figure 6.12).
Figure 6.12
Change the radius 
of the arc and the 
array follows.
	
3.	 Press the Esc key twice to clear your selection of the arc.
Here you see how the associative feature of the Arraypath command enables you to control 
the array by adjusting the object you used for the path. Arrays can be edited through a variety 
of methods, as you’ll see in the next section.
Making Changes to an Associative Array
Now let’s take a look at how you can make changes to an array. You may have noticed the 
Associative option in the Array command’s prompt. By default, the Associative option is turned 
on, which enables you to edit array objects as a group. You’ll see how this works in the following 
exercises.
You’ll start by editing the array you created using the Path Array tool. Since you’ve changed 
the arc array path, the chairs no longer fill the arc. The last chair to the right is no longer at the 
end of the arc. This happened because when you changed the arc’s radius, you made it a bit 

Copying an Object Multiple Times |  195  
longer. By default, the chair array is set up to maintain the chairs’ distance from each other. You 
can change that setting so that the chairs fill the arc. Here’s how it’s done:
	
1.	 Click the array of chairs. Notice that the Array contextual Ribbon tab appears (see Figure 6.13).
Figure 6.13
The Array tab displays 
a different set of pan-
els and options when 
an array is selected.
	
2.	 Click the Measure flyout in the Array tab’s Properties panel and then select the Divide 
Method option. The chairs are now evenly spaced along the arc.
The Divide and Measure options in the Array tab’s Properties panel are similar to the 
Divide and Measure commands. Divide marks off an object into equal parts, whereas Measure 
marks off an object based on a distance between the marks. You’ll learn more about Divide and 
Measure in the section “Finding an Exact Distance Along a Curve” later in this chapter.
You may have also noticed that the chairs are pointing away from the center of the arc. You 
can realign them so that they face the center of the arc by making a simple change to the origi-
nal chair.
The following steps show you how this is done:
	
1.	 Click the Edit Source tool in the Array tab’s Options panel.
	
2.	 Click the middle chair in the array. The Array Editing State message appears, informing 
you that you need to enter ARRAYCLOSE to exit the array editing state (see Figure 6.14).
Figure 6.14
The Array Editing 
State message
	
3.	 Click OK.
	
4.	 Press the Esc key to clear the selection of chairs.
	
5.	 Click the middle chair again, and then click the Rotate tool in the Home tab’s Modify 
panel.
	
6.	 For the rotation base point, click the center of the circle in the chair seat, using the Center 
Osnap.
	
7.	 Rotate the chair so that all of the chairs are facing the center of the arc, as shown in 
Figure 6.15.

196  | CHAPTER 6  Editing and Reusing Data to Work Efficiently   
	
8.	 When the chairs are oriented so that they are pointing toward the center of the arc, click 
to fix their location.
Figure 6.15
Rotating the chairs
	
9.	 Click the Save Changes tool in the Edit Array panel to save the changes and exit the array edit-
ing state. You can also type ARRAYCLOSE↵ and choose Yes in the dialog box that appears.
In this exercise, you saw how editing the source object of an array affects the other array 
copies. This is the Associative array feature at work. You could have made any number of other 
changes to the array.
Next, you’ll make changes to the chair array spacing and add a few additional rows. Then 
you’ll revisit the kitchenette to see how you can edit a nested array.
Try the following exercise to see how the Ribbon can be used to edit an array:
	
1.	 Click any chair in the array. Notice again that the Ribbon changes to show the Array tab 
with some new panels.
	
2.	 In the Rows panel, change the Row Count value in the top text box to 3. Two more rows of 
chairs appear for a total of three rows.
	
3.	 Adjust your view so that you can see all of the rows. If this action closes the Array contex-
tual ribbon, just click the chair again to get back to it.
	
4.	 In the Items panel, change the Item Count value at the top to 10. If you are unable to 
change the item count value, open the Properties panel, click Measure, and select Divide.
	
5.	 Press the Esc key to clear your selection.
	
6.	 Exit the file without saving it so that you can come back and practice with it again. 
Unable to Change the Item Count?
If you can’t change the Item Count value in the Items panel, select Divide Method from the Divide/
Measure flyout in the Properties panel of the Array tab. The Measure option does not allow you to 
change the item count because Measure forces a fixed distance between objects in the array. Since the 
Divide option doesn’t care about the distance between objects, it allows you to change the item count.

Copying an Object Multiple Times |  197  
As you can see from these exercises, you can easily make changes to an array through the 
Ribbon panel options in the Array tab. Many of these options are also available through the 
multifunction grip menus when you have Dynamic Input turned on.
Several other tools become available on the Ribbon panel when you select an associative 
array. Table 6.1 gives you a rundown of the panels and tools and their function. The tools that 
appear in the Ribbon will be slightly different depending on whether the array is a polar, rect-
angular, or path array, but the features they offer are similar to those in the table.
Table 6.1:	
The panels and tools on the Array tab
Panel or tool
Purpose
Items
Controls the number of items, their distance, and the overall width of the 
array.
Rows
Controls the number of rows, the distance between rows, and the overall 
distance between the first and last row. A fourth option, Incremental 
Elevation in the expanded Rows panel, enables you to control the z-axis height 
of rows for 3D models.
Levels
Controls the number of levels in the z-axis, their spacing, and the overall dis-
tance from the first to the last level.
Base Point
Enables you to adjust the base point of the array objects.
Measure/Divide
Controls how the arrayed objects behave when the path is modified. Measure 
Method maintains the distance between objects when the path object changes 
in length. Divide Method causes the distance between objects to adjust to 
changes in the path object’s length.
Align Items
Controls whether the array objects are aligned with the path object.
Z Direction
Controls whether array objects are “banked” with a 3D path object.
Edit Source
Enables you to edit the source object in an array.
Replace Item
Enables you to replace the source object in the array.
Reset Array
Restores erased items and removes overrides.
In the next exercise, you’ll return to the kitchen drawing to see how you can use grips to 
modify an array:
	
1.	 If you have closed the kitchen drawing, open it again.
	
2.	 Click the array of burners that you created earlier. The grips appear for the array, and you 
see the Array tab in the Ribbon as you did earlier.
	
3.	 Hover over the grip in the upper-right burner. A menu appears.

198  | CHAPTER 6  Editing and Reusing Data to Work Efficiently   
	
4.	 Select the Row And Column Count option from the menu. Now, as you move the cursor 
up and to the right, additional burners appear. The farther to the upper right you move 
the cursor, the more rows and columns will appear (see Figure 6.16).
	
5.	 When you see one additional row and column, click and then press the Esc key to clear 
your selection. The additional burners are added to the drawing.
Figure 6.16
The rows and columns 
increase as you move 
the cursor farther 
from the base point.
	
6.	 You don’t want the changes to be permanent, so click the Undo tool to revert to the four 
burners of the original drawing.
	
7.	 Close the kitchen drawing without saving it.
In step 4, you used the Row And Column Count multifunction grip option to add rows and 
columns to an array. This option combines the function of the Rows and Columns panels in the 
Array tab.
Developing Your Drawing
As mentioned briefly in Chapter 3, when you’re using AutoCAD, you first create the basic geo-
metric forms used in your drawing, and then you refine them. In this section, you’ll create two 
drawings—the studio apartment unit and the lobby—that demonstrate this process in more 
detail.
First, you’ll construct a typical studio apartment unit by using the drawings you’ve created 
thus far. In the process, you’ll explore the use of lines as reference objects.
You’ll also further examine how to use existing files as blocks. In Chapter 4, “Organizing 
Objects with Blocks and Groups,” you inserted a file into another file. The number of files you 
can insert is limitless, and you can insert files of any size. As you may already have guessed, 
you can also nest files and blocks—that is, you can insert blocks or files in other blocks or files. 
Nesting can help reduce your drawing time by enabling you to build one block out of smaller 
blocks. For example, you can insert your door drawing into the bathroom plan. In turn, you 
can insert the bathroom plan into the studio unit plan, which also contains doors. Finally, 
you can insert the unit plan into the overall floor plan for the studio apartment building.

Developing Your Drawing |  199  
Importing Settings
In this exercise, you’ll use the Bath file as a prototype for the studio unit plan. However, you 
must make a few changes to it first. After the changes are made, you’ll import the bathroom and 
thereby import the layers and blocks contained in the bathroom file.
As you go through this exercise, observe how the drawings begin to evolve from simple 
forms to complex, assembled forms.
Use these steps to modify the Bath file:
	
1.	 Open the Bath file you worked on earlier. If you skipped drawing the Bath file in Chap­
ter 5, “Keeping Track of Layers and Blocks,” use the file 05c-bath.dwg (or 05c-bath-met-
ric.dwg) from this book’s companion web page.
	
2.	 Click the Set Base Point tool in the Insert tab’s expanded Block Definition panel, and 
select the upper-left corner of the bathroom as the new base point for this drawing so that 
you can position the Bath file more accurately.
	
3.	 Save the Bath file. If you use the sample from the book’s web page, choose Save As from 
the Application menu and save it as Bath. You can save it to your Documents folder to 
keep the original in its unedited state.
	
4.	 Click the Close icon in the Drawing tab, or choose Close from the Application menu to 
close the bath drawing.
Next you’ll create a new file. Use the New option from the Quick Access toolbar to create a 
file from a template:
	
1.	 Click New from the Quick Access toolbar to open the Select Template dialog box.
	
2.	 Locate and select the acad.dwt template file. Metric users should select the acadiso.dwt 
template file.
	
3.	 Click Open to open the new file and when the file opens, turn off the background grid.
	
4.	 If you’re using Imperial measurements, choose Drawing Utilities ➢ Units from the 
Application menu; then, in the Drawing Units dialog box, select Architectural from the 
Length group’s Type drop-down list and click OK. Metric users should use the default 
decimal length type and should select Centimeters in the Insertion Scale drop-down list.
	
5.	 Type LIMITS↵. At the Specify lower left corner or [ON/OFF] <0′-0″,0′-0″>: 
prompt, press ↵ to accept the default drawing origin for the lower-left corner.
	
6.	 If you’re using Imperial measurements, enter 528,408↵ at the next prompt. These are the 
appropriate dimensions for an 8–1/2″ × 11″ drawing at 1/4″ = 1′-0″ scale. Metric users 
should enter 1485,1050. This is the work area for a 1:50 scale drawing on an A4 sheet.
	
7.	 Click Zoom All from the Navigation bar.
Let’s continue by laying out a typical studio unit. You’ll discover how importing a file also 
imports a variety of drawing items such as layers and linetypes. Follow these steps:
	
1.	 Begin the unit by drawing two rectangles, one 14′ long by 24′ wide and the other 14′ long 
by 4′ wide. Metric users should make the rectangles 426 cm long by 731 cm wide and 426 
cm long by 122 cm wide. For the first rectangle, click the Rectangle tool in the Home tab’s 

200  | CHAPTER 6  Editing and Reusing Data to Work Efficiently   
Draw panel, enter the coordinate for the lower-left corner as shown in Figure 6.17, and 
then enter @14′,24′↵. Metric users should enter @426,731↵. Repeat the process using the 
coordinates for the second, smaller rectangle.
The rectangles should be placed as shown in Figure 6.17. The large rectangle represents the 
interior of the apartment unit, and the small rectangle represents the balcony. The size and 
location of the rectangles are indicated in the figure.
Figure 6.17

interior and balcony. 
Metric locations and 
dimensions are shown 
in brackets.
	
2.	 Click the Explode tool on the Home tab’s Block panel, select the two rectangles, and then 
press ↵.
	
3.	 Click the Insert tool on the Home tab’s Block panel to open the Insert dialog box.
	
4.	 Click the Browse button, and locate and select the bath drawing by using the Select 
Drawing File dialog box; then click Open. If you haven’t saved a bathroom drawing from 
earlier exercises, you can use 05c-bath.dwg or 05c-bath-metric.dwg if you are working 
in the metric system.
	
5.	 If you’re using the 05c-bath.dwg or the 05c-bath-metric.dwg file, do the following: 
After selecting 05c-bath.dwg or 05c-bath.dwg in step 4, change the name that appears 
in the Name text box to Bath before you click OK in step 6. This gives the inserted file a 
block name of Bath, even though its originating filename is 05c-bath or 05c-bath.dwg.
If You Used the Rectangle Tool to Draw the Interior and Balcony. . .
. . .of the apartment unit, make sure that you use the Explode tool on the Modify panel to explode 
the rectangles. The Rectangle tool draws a polyline rectangle instead of simple line segments, 
so you need to explode the rectangle to reduce it to its component lines. You’ll learn more about 
polylines in Chapter 18.

Developing Your Drawing |  201  
	
6.	 Click OK in the Insert dialog box, and then click the upper-left corner of the unit’s inte-
rior as the insertion point (see Figure 6.18). You can use the Endpoint osnap to place the 
bathroom accurately. If you are prompted for scale and rotation, use a scale factor of 1.0 
and a rotation angle of 0°.

bathroom is inserted
	
7.	 If running osnaps haven’t been set up in this file, you need to use the Osnap context 
menu (Shift+right-click) to access the Endpoint osnap. You can set up running osnaps to 
take advantage of the AutoSnap functions by right-clicking the Object Snap button in the 
status bar and selecting Settings. Set the running osnaps as described in Chapter 3.
	
8.	 Assign the two rectangles that you drew earlier to the Wall layer. To do this, select the 
two rectangles so that they’re highlighted and then open the layer drop-down list in the 
Layers panel and select Wall. Press the Esc key to clear the selection.
By inserting the bathroom, you imported the layers and blocks contained in the Bath file. 
You were then able to move previously drawn objects to the imported layers. If you’re in a hurry, 
this can be a quick way to duplicate layers that you know exist in another drawing. This method 
is similar to using an existing drawing as a template, but it lets you start work on a drawing 
before deciding which template to use.
Using Osnap Tracking to Place Objects
You’ll draw lines in the majority of your work, so it’s important to know how to manipulate lines 
to your best advantage. In the following sections, you’ll look at some common ways to use and 
edit these fundamental drawing objects. The following exercises show you the process of draw-
ing lines rather than just how individual commands work. While you’re building walls and add-
ing doors, you’ll get a chance to become more familiar with Polar Tracking and Osnap Tracking.
Roughing In the Line Work
The bathroom you inserted in the preceding section has only one side of its interior walls 
drawn. (Walls are usually shown by double lines.) In this next exercise, you’ll draw the other 

202  | CHAPTER 6  Editing and Reusing Data to Work Efficiently   
side. Rather than trying to draw the wall perfectly the first time, you’ll sketch in the line work 
and then clean it up in the next section, in a way similar to manual drafting.
Use these steps to rough in the wall lines:
	
1.	 Zoom in to the bathroom so that the entire bathroom and part of the area around it are 
displayed, as shown in Figure 6.19.
Figure 6.19
The enlarged view 
of the bathroom
	
2.	 Select Wall from the layer drop-down list in the Layers panel to make Wall the current 
layer.
	
3.	 Make sure that the Object Snap Tracking and Object Snap tool options on the status bar 
are selected.
Object Snap
Object Snap Tracking
	
4.	 Select Line from the Draw panel, or type L↵.
	
5.	 At the Specify first point: prompt, hover your cursor over the lower-right corner of 
the bathroom so that the Endpoint Osnap marker appears, but don’t click it.
	
6.	 Now move the cursor down and, as you do, the tracking vector appears. (If the track-
ing vector doesn’t appear at first, hover your cursor over the corner again until it does 
appear.)

Developing Your Drawing |  203  
Remember that a little cross appears at the osnap location, telling you that Osnap Tracking 
has “locked on” to that location.
	
7.	 With the tracking vector visible, point the cursor directly downward from the corner and 
then type 5↵. Metric users should type 13↵. A line starts 5″ (or 13 cm) below the lower-
right corner of the bathroom.
	
8.	 Point the cursor to the left to cross the left wall of the apartment unit slightly, as illus-
trated in the top image in Figure 6.20. Click to place the line in this position, and then 
press ↵ to exit the Line command.

9.	 Draw another line up from the endpoint of the top doorjamb to meet the top wall of the 
unit (see the bottom image in Figure 6.20). Use the Perpendicular osnap to pick the top 
wall of the unit. This causes the line to end precisely on the wall line in a perpendicular 
position, as seen in the bottom image in Figure 6.20.

204  | CHAPTER 6  Editing and Reusing Data to Work Efficiently   
You can also use the Perpendicular osnap override to draw a line perpendicular to a 
nonorthogonal line—one at a 45° angle, for instance.
	
10.	 Draw a line connecting the two doorjambs. Then assign that line to the Ceiling layer. (See 
the top panel in Figure 6.21.)
	
11.	 Draw a line 6″ down from the endpoint of the doorjamb nearest the corner. (See the top 
panel in Figure 6.21.) Metric users should draw a line 15 cm down.

Smoothing the Arc
You may notice that some of the arcs in your bathroom drawing aren’t smooth. Don’t be alarmed; 
this is how AutoCAD displays arcs and circles in enlarged views. The arcs will be smooth when 
they’re plotted. If you want to see them now as they’re stored in the file, you can regenerate the 
drawing by typing RE↵ at the Command prompt. Chapter 7, “Mastering Viewing Tools, Hatches, 
and External References,” discusses regeneration in more detail.

Developing Your Drawing |  205  
In the previous exercise, Osnap Tracking mode enabled you to specify the starting point of a 
line at an exact distance from the corner of the bathroom. In step 7, you used the Direct Distance 
method for specifying distance and direction.
Selecting Points from a Known Location
Instead of using a tracking vector in step 6 of the previous exercise, you could choose From on 
the Osnap context menu and then open the context menu again and select Endpoint. Select the 
corner and enter a polar coordinate such as @5<-90 to accomplish the same task as this exercise.
Cleaning Up the Line Work
You’ve drawn some of the wall lines, approximating their endpoint locations. Next, you’ll use 
the Fillet command to join lines exactly end to end and then import the kitchen drawing.
Certiﬁcation
Objective
Understanding the Osnap Tracking Vector
The Osnap Tracking vector comes into play only after you’ve placed an osnap marker on a location—
in this case, the corner of the bathroom. It won’t appear at any other time. If you have both Running 
Osnaps and Osnap Tracking turned on, you’ll get the tracking vector every time the cursor lands on 
an osnap location. This can be confusing to novice users, so you may want to use Osnap Tracking 
sparingly until you become more comfortable with it.
Because Polar Tracking also uses a tracking vector, you may get the two confused. Remember that 
Polar Tracking lets you point the cursor in a specific direction while selecting points. If you’re an 
experienced AutoCAD user, you can think of it as a more intelligent Ortho mode. On the other 
hand, Osnap Tracking lets you align points to osnap locations. Experienced AutoCAD users can 
think of Osnap Tracking as a more intelligent XYZ filter option.
Follow these steps to join the lines:
	
1.	 Click the Fillet tool on the Modify panel or type F↵.
The Fillet, Chamfer, and Blend Curves tools share the same location in the Modify toolbar, 
so the tool tip may say any of these. If it does, then click the flyout arrowhead next to the 
tool and select Fillet.
	
2.	 Type R↵0↵ to make sure that the fillet radius is set to 0.
	
3.	 Fillet the two lines by picking the vertical and horizontal lines, as indicated in the bottom 
panel in Figure 6.21. Notice that these points lie on the portion of the line you want to 
keep. Your drawing will look like the bottom panel in Figure 6.21.

206  | CHAPTER 6  Editing and Reusing Data to Work Efficiently   
	
4.	 Fillet the bottom wall of the bathroom with the left wall of the unit, as shown in 
Figure 6.22. Make sure that the points you pick on the wall lines are on the side of the line 
that you want to keep, not on the side that you want trimmed.
	
5.	 Fillet the top wall of the unit with the right-side wall of the bathroom, as shown in 
Figure 6.22.
Chamfer vs. Fillet vs. Blend Curves
The Chamfer command performs a similar function to the Fillet command, but unlike Fillet, it 
enables you to join two lines with an intermediate beveled line rather than with an arc. Chamfer 
can be set to join two lines at a corner in exactly the same manner as Fillet.
The Blend Curves command will also join lines, but it does so by inserting a curved spline to intui-
tively bridge a gap between the ends of various types of objects.

You can select two lines at once for the fillet operation by using a crossing window; to do 
so, type C↵ at the Select first object or ...: prompt and then use a crossing window 
to select the two endpoints you want to join. The two endpoints closest to the fillet location are 
trimmed.
Where you select the lines affects the way the lines are joined. As you select objects to fillet, 
the side of the line where you click is the side that remains when the lines are joined. Figure 6.23 
illustrates how the Fillet command works and shows what the Fillet options do.
If you select two parallel lines during the Fillet command, the two lines are joined with 
an arc.

Placing the Door Accurately
The next step is to add the entry door shown in the bottom image in Figure 6.24. In doing that, 
you’ll use a number of new tools together to streamline the drawing process.
In this exercise, you’ll practice using the Osnap Tracking feature and the From Osnap option 
to place the entry door at an exact distance from the upper corner of the floor plan:
	
1.	 Right-click in the drawing area, and choose Recent Input ➢ Insert from the context menu 
to open the Insert dialog box.

Scale group, and then click OK. You’ll see the door follow the cursor in the drawing window.
	
4.	 Shift+right-click to open the Osnap context menu, and then choose From.
	
5.	 Make sure that the Object Snap and Object Snap Tracking options on the status bar are 
selected; then use the Endpoint Running Osnap to click the corner where the upper hori-
zontal wall line meets the bathroom wall.
	
6.	 Now move the cursor to the right, and you’ll see the Osnap Tracking vector extend from 
the corner.
	
7.	 Continue to move the cursor to the right so that the polar tracking vector readout shows 
roughly 6″, or 15 cm for metric users.
	
8.	 With the cursor in this position, enter 5↵. Metric users should enter 13↵. The door is 
placed exactly 5 (or 13) units to the right of the corner.
	
9.	 At the Specify rotation angle <0>: prompt, enter 270↵. Or, if you prefer, turn on 
Polar Tracking to orient the door so that it’s swinging into the studio. You’ve now accu-
rately placed the entry door in the studio apartment.

210  | CHAPTER 6  Editing and Reusing Data to Work Efficiently   
	
10.	 Make sure that the door is on the Door layer and the kitchen block is on the Fixture layer.
For a shortcut to setting an object’s layer, you can select the object or objects and then select a 
layer from the layer drop-down list in the Layers panel.
Next, add the finishing touches to the entry door:
	
1.	 Add 5″ (13 cm for metric users) doorjambs, as shown in the bottom image in Figure 6.24, 
and change their Layer property to the Jamb layer.
	
2.	 Choose the Break tool in the expanded Modify panel, and then select the header over the 
entry door. (See the bottom image in Figure 6.24.)
	
3.	 Type F↵ to use the first-point option; then select the endpoint of one of the doorjambs.
	
4.	 At the Specify second break point: prompt, select the endpoint of the other jamb, as 
shown in the bottom image in Figure 6.24. The line between the points disappears.
	
5.	 Draw the door header on the Ceiling layer, as shown in Figure 6.25.

Using Polar and Osnap Tracking as Construction Line Tools
So far, you’ve been using existing geometry to place objects in the plan accurately. In this sec-
tion, you’ll use the Polar and Osnap Tracking tools to extend the upper wall line 5″ (13 cm 
for metric users) beyond the right interior wall of the unit. You’ll also learn how to use the 
Construction Line tool to locate doorjambs accurately near the balcony.

Start by changing the Polar Tracking setting to include a 45° angle:
	
1.	 Right-click the Polar Tracking button in the status bar at the bottom of the AutoCAD win-
dow, and choose Settings to open the Drafting Settings dialog box at the Polar Tracking 
tab (see Figure 6.26).
Other Methods for Using the Break Command
In the exercise for finishing the unit plan, you used the Break command to place a gap in a line 
accurately over the entry door. In Chapter 5, you broke a line at a single point to create multiple, 
contiguous line segments.
In this chapter, you used the Break command’s first-point (F) option, which allows you to specify the 
first point of a break. You can also break a line without the F option, but with a little less accuracy. 
When you don’t use the F option, the point at which you select the object is used as the first break-
point. If you’re in a hurry, you can dispense with the F option and place a gap in an approximate 
location. You can later use other tools to adjust the gap.
In addition, you can use locations on other objects to select the first and second points of a break. 
For example, you might want to align an opening with another opening some distance away. After 
you’ve selected the line to break, you can then use the F option and select two points on the exist-
ing opening to define the first and second breakpoints. The breakpoints will align in an orthogonal 
direction to the selected points.

You’re ready to extend the wall line. For this operation, you’ll use grip editing:
	
1.	 Click the wall line at the top of the plan and to the right of the door to select the line and 
expose its grips.
	
2.	 Click the Ortho Mode button in the status bar to turn on Ortho mode. This keeps the wall 
line straight as you edit it.
	
3.	 Click the rightmost grip of the line to make it hot.
	
4.	 Place the cursor on the upper-right corner of the plan until you see the Endpoint osnap 
marker; then move the cursor away from the corner at a 45° angle. The Osnap Tracking 
vector appears at a 45° angle. Notice the small X that appears at the intersection of the 
Osnap Tracking vector and the line (see Figure 6.27).

With Polar Tracking set to 45° and Osnap Tracking turned on in a crowded drawing, you 
may find that you’re selecting points that you don’t really want to select. Just remember that 
if a drawing becomes too crowded, you can turn off these options temporarily by clicking the 
Object Snap Tracking or Polar Tracking button in the status bar.
In this exercise, you used Polar Tracking and Ortho mode to position the two lines used for 
the exterior walls of the studio unit accurately. This shows how you can take advantage of exist-
ing geometry with a combination of tools in the status bar.
Now you’ll finish the balcony by adding a sliding glass door and a rail. This time, you’ll use 
lines for construction as well as for parts of the drawing. First, you’ll add the doorjamb by draw-
ing a construction line. A construction line is a line that has an infinite length, but unlike a ray, 
it extends in both directions. After drawing the construction line, you’ll use it to position the 
doorjambs quickly.

nearly 80 percent of what you’ll do in AutoCAD is represented here.
Now, to review the drawing process and to create a drawing you’ll use later, you’ll draw the 
apartment building’s lobby. As you follow the steps, refer to Figure 6.33.
The Construction Line Options
There is more to the Construction Line command than you’ve seen in the exercises in this chapter. 
Here is a list of the Construction Line options and their uses:
Hor    Draws horizontal construction lines as you click points

As is usual in floor plans, the elevator shaft is indicated by the box with the large X through 
it, and the stair shaft is indicated by the box with the row of parallel lines through it. If you’re 
in a hurry, use the finished version of this file, called Lobby.dwg (Lobby-metric.dwg for metric 
users).
To draw the apartment building lobby, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Create a new file called Lobby.dwg using the Unit.dwg file as a prototype. (Open the 
Unit.dwg file, choose Save As from the Application menu, and enter Lobby for the new 
filename.)
	
2.	 Erase the entire unit (select the Erase tool from the Modify panel, and then type All↵↵).
	
3.	 Draw the three main rectangles that represent the outlines of the stair shaft, the elevator 
shaft, and the lobby.
Ver    Draws vertical construction lines as you click points
Ang    Draws construction lines at a specified angle as you pick points
Bisect    Draws construction lines bisecting an angle or an area between two points
Offset    Draws construction lines offset at a specified distance from an existing line

4.	 To draw the stairs, copy or offset the stair shaft’s left wall to the right a distance of 4 feet 
(122 cm). This creates the first line representing the steps.
	
5.	 Array this line in one row of 10 columns, using an 11″ (28 cm) column offset.
	
6.	 Draw the center line dividing the two flights of stairs.
	
7.	 Draw the elevator, insert the door, and assign the door to the Door layer. Practice using 
construction lines here.
	
8.	 Draw the doorjambs. Edit the door openings to add the doorjambs and headers and add 
the interior walls to the stairwell.
	
9.	 Use the Base command to set the base point of the drawing. Your plan should resemble 
the one in Figure 6.33, step 4.
	
10.	 Save the Lobby.dwg file and close it. 
Using Rays
If you like the Construction Line tool but you would like to have one endpoint, you can use a ray 
(click Ray in the expanded Draw panel). A ray is like a line that starts from a point you select and 
continues off to an infinite distance. You specify the start point and angle of the ray. You can place 
a ray at the corner at a 45° angle and then fillet the ray to the horizontal wall line to shorten or 
lengthen the line to the appropriate length.
Finding an Exact Distance Along a Curve
To find an exact distance along a curve or to mark off specific distance increments along a curve, 
do the following:
	
1.	 With a file open, click the Point Style tool in the Home tab’s expanded Utilities panel, or 
enter ddptype↵ to open the Point Style dialog box (see Figure 6.34).

You can also set the point style by setting the Pdmode system variable to 3.
	
3.	 Select Measure from the expanded Draw panel, or type ME↵ (see Figure 6.35).

The Difference Between Divide and Measure
The Divide tool (Divide from the expanded Draw panel) marks off a line, an arc, or a curve into 
equal divisions as opposed to divisions of a length you specify. You might use Divide to divide an 
object into 12 equal segments, for example. Aside from this difference in function, Divide works 
exactly the same as Measure.
	
4.	 At the Select object to measure: prompt, click the end of the curve that you want to 
use as the starting point for your distance measurement.
	
5.	 At the Specify length of segment or [Block]: prompt, enter the distance you want. 
A series of Xs appears on the curve, marking off the specified distance along the curve. 
You can select the exact location of the Xs by using the Node osnap override 
(see Figure 6.36).

The Measure command also works on most objects, including arcs and polylines. You’ll get a 
more detailed look at the Measure command in Chapter 18.
As you work with AutoCAD, you’ll find that constructing temporary geometry will help you 
solve problems in new ways. Don’t hesitate to experiment! Remember, you always have the Save 
and Undo commands to help you recover from your mistakes.
Using Blocks Instead of Points
With the Block option of the Measure command, you can specify a block to be inserted at the speci-
fied segment length in place of point objects on the arc. You can align the block with the arc as it’s 
inserted. Or you can use the Arraypath command described earlier in this chapter.
Divide and Measure as AutoLISP Customization Tools
Divide and Measure are great tools for gathering information about objects in a drawing. A colleague 
of ours found it to be an excellent way to find the length of a complex object while working on an 
AutoLISP® macro. In AutoLISP, you have to write some elaborate code just to find the length of a 
complex polyline. After struggling with his program code, our colleague realized that he could use 
the Measure command to mark off known distances along a polyline and then count the points to 
find the overall length of the polyline.
Changing the Length of Objects
Suppose that, after finding the length of an arc, you realize that you need to lengthen the arc by 
a specific amount. The Lengthen tool in the expanded Modify panel lets you lengthen or shorten 
arcs, lines, polylines, splines, and elliptical arcs. Here’s how to lengthen an arc:
	
1.	 Select Lengthen from the expanded Modify panel, or type LEN↵.
	
2.	 At the Select an object or [DElta/Percent/Total/DYnamic]: prompt, type T↵, or 
select Total from the command line.
	
3.	 At the Specify total length or [Angle] <1.0000)>: prompt, enter the length you 
want for the arc.
	
4.	 At the Select an object to change or [Undo]: prompt, click the arc that you want 
to change. Be sure to click at a point nearest the end that you want to lengthen. The arc 
increases in length to the size that you specified.
The Lengthen command also shortens an object if it’s currently longer than the value you 
enter.
In this short example, you’ve learned how to change an object to a specific length. You can 
use other criteria to change an object’s length using these options available for the Lengthen 
command:
Delta    Lengthens or shortens an object by a specific length. To specify an angle rather than a 
length, use the Angle suboption.

Creating a New Drawing by Using Parts from Another Drawing |  221  
Percent    Increases or decreases the length of an object by a percentage of its current length.
Total    Specifies the total length or angle of an object.
Dynamic    Lets you graphically change the length of an object using your cursor.
Creating a New Drawing by Using Parts from Another 
Drawing
Next, we’ll explain how to use the Export command. Export can be used to turn parts of a draw-
ing into a separate file in a way similar to the Wblock command described in Chapter 4. Here 
you’ll use the Export command to create a separate staircase drawing by using the staircase 
you’ve already drawn for the lobby.
Follow these steps:
	
1.	 If you closed the lobby drawing, open it now. If you didn’t create the drawing, open the 
06-Lobby.dwg (or 06-Lobby-metric.dwg) file.
	
2.	 Choose Export ➢ Other Formats from the Application menu, or type export↵ to open the 
Export Data dialog box.
	
3.	 Enter stair.dwg in the File Name text box, and click Save. By including the .dwg file-
name extension, you let AutoCAD know that you want to export to a drawing file and not 
a file in some other file format, such as DXF or WMF.
	
4.	 At the Enter name of existing block or [= (block=output file)/* (whole drawing)] 
<define new drawing>: prompt, press ↵. When you export to a DWG format, AutoCAD 
assumes that you want to export a block. Bypassing this prompt by pressing ↵ tells 
AutoCAD that you want to create a file from part of the drawing rather than from a block.
	
5.	 At the Specify insertion base point: prompt, pick the lower-right corner of the stair 
shaft. This tells AutoCAD the base point for the new drawing.
	
6.	 At the Select objects: prompt, use a standard window (not a crossing window) to 
select the stair shaft, as shown in Figure 6.37.
Figure 6.37

enclosing the stair 
shaft

7.	 When the stair shaft, including the door, is highlighted, press ↵ to confirm your selection. 
The stairs disappear.

222  | CHAPTER 6  Editing and Reusing Data to Work Efficiently   
	
8.	 Because you want the stairs to remain in the lobby drawing, click the Undo button to 
bring them back. Undo doesn’t affect any files that you might export by choosing Export 
➢ Other Formats from the Application menu, by using Wblock, or by using the Block tool.
Eliminating Unused Blocks, Layers, Linetypes, Shapes, Styles, and More
A template can contain blocks and layers that you don’t need in your new file. For example, the 
lobby you just completed contains the bathroom block because you used the Unit file as a proto-
type. Even though you erased this block, it remains in the drawing file’s database. It’s considered 
unused because it doesn’t appear as part of the drawing. Such extra blocks can slow you down 
by increasing the amount of time needed to open the file. They also increase the size of your file 
unnecessarily. You can eliminate unused elements from a drawing by using the Purge command.
Selectively Removing Unused Elements
You use the Purge command to remove unused individual blocks, layers, linetypes, shapes, text 
styles, and other drawing elements from a drawing file. To help keep the file size small and to 
make layer maintenance easier, you should purge your drawing of unused elements. Bear in 
mind, however, that the Purge command doesn’t delete certain primary drawing elements—
namely, layer 0, the Continuous linetype, and the Standard text style.
Use these steps to practice using the Purge command:
	
1.	 In the lobby drawing, choose Drawing Utilities ➢ Purge from the Application menu to 
open the Purge dialog box (see Figure 6.38). You’ll see a listing of drawing components 
that can be purged. If the drawing contains any of the types of components listed, a plus 
sign appears to the left of the component name.
Figure 6.38
The Purge dialog 
box

Creating a New Drawing by Using Parts from Another Drawing |  223  
	
2.	 Click the plus sign of the component that you want to purge. In this exercise, click the 
plus sign next to the Blocks listing. The list expands to show the names of the items under 
the component category.
	
3.	 Select the name BATH from the expanded list. If you want to select more than one item, 
you can Ctrl+click individual names or Shift+click to select a group of names.
	
4.	 After the components are selected, click the Purge button in the lower-left corner of the dia-
log box. You then see a message box asking you to confirm that you want to purge the block.
	
5.	 Click Purge This Item, and then click Close to close the Purge dialog box.
Removing All Unused Elements
In the previous exercise, you selected a single block for removal from the lobby drawing. If you 
want to clear all the unused elements from a file at once, you can click the Purge All button at 
the bottom of the Purge dialog box (see Figure 6.38).
Here are the steps:
	
1.	 Choose Drawing Utilities ➢ Purge from the Application menu to open the Purge dialog 
box again.
	
2.	 Click the Purge Nested Items check box to turn on this option.
	
3.	 Click Purge All to open the Confirm Purge dialog box, which asks whether you want to 
purge a block.
	
4.	 Click Purge This Item. The Confirm Purge dialog box displays the name of another 
block, asking you to confirm the purge. You can continue to click Purge This Item, and 
AutoCAD will display the Confirm Purge dialog box for each unused element still in the 
drawing.
	
5.	 Click the Purge All Items option to purge everything at once. The Confirm Purge dialog 
box closes.
	
6.	 In the Purge dialog box, click Close.
	
7.	 Close and save the Lobby file, and exit AutoCAD.
The Lobby file is now trimmed down to the essential data it needs and nothing else. You may 
have noticed that when you returned to the Purge dialog box in step 6, the items in the list box no 
longer showed plus signs. This indicates that there are no longer any unused items in the drawing.
In this last exercise, you used the Purge Nested Items option at the bottom of the dialog box. 
The Purge Nested Items option automatically purges unused blocks, including those nested 
within other blocks. If this option isn’t checked, you might have to repeat the Purge operation to 
remove all unused elements in a drawing.
Purging Zero-Length Geometry and Blank Text
At the very bottom of the Purge dialog box, you’ll see the option Purge Zero-Length Geometry And 
Empty Text Objects. This has long been on the wish list of AutoCAD users, and it does just what 
continues

Chapter  7
Mastering Viewing Tools, Hatches, 
and External References 
Now that you’ve created drawings of a typical apartment unit and the apartment building’s 
lobby and stairs, you can assemble them to complete the first floor of the apartment building. 
In this chapter, you’ll take full advantage of the features of the AutoCAD® 2017 software to 
enhance your drawing skills and to reduce the time to create accurate drawings.
As your drawing becomes larger, you’ll find that you need to use the Zoom and Pan com-
mands more often. Larger drawings also require some special editing techniques. You’ll learn 
how to assemble and view drawings in ways that will save you time and effort as your design 
progresses. Along the way, you’ll see how you can enhance the appearance of your drawings by 
adding hatch patterns.
In this chapter, you will learn to
◆

◆
◆

◆
◆

◆
◆

Assembling the Parts
One of the best timesaving features of AutoCAD is its ability to duplicate repetitive elements 
quickly in a drawing. In this section, you’ll assemble the drawings you’ve been working on into 
the complete floor plan of a fictitious apartment project. Doing so will demonstrate how you can 
quickly and accurately copy your existing drawings in a variety of ways.
Don’t See the Navigation Bar?
In this chapter, you’ll be asked to use the Zoom and Pan tools on the Navigation bar frequently. If 
you don’t see it in the AutoCAD window, then go to the View tab’s Viewport Tools panel and turn 
on the Navigation Bar option.

226  | CHAPTER 7  Mastering Viewing Tools, Hatches, and External References   
Start by creating a new file for the first floor:
	
1.	 Create a new file named Plan to contain the drawing of the apartment building’s first 
floor. This is the file you’ll use to assemble the unit plans into an apartment building. 
If you want to use a template file, use acad.dwt. Metric users can use the acadiso.dwt 
template file. (These are AutoCAD template files that appear in the Select Template dialog 
box when you choose New from the Quick Access toolbar.)
	
2.	 In the Length group of the Drawing Units dialog box, set the unit Type to Architectural 
(choose Drawing Utilities ➢ Units from the Application menu). Metric users can leave 
Type as Decimal but change the insertion scale to centimeters.
	
3.	 Set up the drawing for a 1⁄8″ = 1′-0″ scale on a 24″ by 18″ drawing area. (You can use the 
Limits command for this.) Such a drawing requires an area 2,304 units wide by 1,728 
units deep. Metric users should set up a drawing at 1:100 scale on an A2 sheet size. Your 
drawing area should be 5940 cm by 4200 cm.
	
4.	 Create a layer called Plan1, and make it the current layer.
	
5.	 Right-click the Snap Mode tool in the status bar and select Settings.
	
6.	 Set Snap Spacing to 1 for both Imperial and metric users.
	
7.	 Choose Zoom All from the Navigation bar or type Z↵A↵ to get an overall view of the 
drawing area.
Now you’re ready to start building a floor plan of the first floor from the unit plan you cre-
ated in the previous chapter. You’ll begin by creating a mirrored copy of the apartment plan:
	
1.	 Make sure that the Object Snap tool is turned off, and then insert the 07a-unit.dwg draw-
ing at coordinate 31′-5″,43′-8″. Metric users should insert the 07a-unit-metric.dwg 
drawing at coordinate 957,1330. If you don’t already have them, you can download these 
and other exercise files for this book at www.sybex.com/go/masteringautocad2017.
	
2.	 Accept the Insert defaults. 07a-unit and 07a-unit-metric are the same drawings as the 
Unit.dwg file that you were asked to create in earlier chapters.
If you prefer, you can specify the insertion point in the Insert dialog box by removing the 
check mark from the Specify On-Screen check box. The input options in the Insertion Point 
group then become available to receive your input.
If you happen to insert a block in the wrong coordinate location, you can use the Properties 
palette to change the insertion point for the block.
Continue the drawing by making mirrored copies of the inserted plan:
	
1.	 Zoom into the apartment unit plan.
	
2.	 Click Mirror on the Home tab’s Modify panel, select the unit plan, and press ↵.
	
3.	 At the Specify first point of the mirror line: prompt, Shift+right-click and 
choose From.
	
4.	 Shift+right-click again, and choose Endpoint.
	
5.	 Select the endpoint of the upper-right corner of the apartment unit, as shown in Figure 7.1.

Assembling the Parts |  227  
	
6.	 Enter @2.5<0↵. Metric users should enter @6.5<0↵. A rubber-banding line appears, 
indicating the mirror axis.
	
7.	 Turn on the Ortho mode tool, and select any point to point the mirror axis in a vertical 
orientation. You can also hold down the Shift key as you make your point selection to 
turn on Ortho mode temporarily.
	
8.	 At the Erase Source Objects? [Yes/No] <N>: prompt, press ↵. You’ll get a 5″ wall 
thickness between two studio units. Your drawing should be similar to the one shown in 
Figure 7.1.
You now have a mirror-image copy of the original plan in the exact location required for the 
overall plan. Next, make some additional copies for the opposite side of the building:
	
1.	 Press ↵ to reissue the Mirror command and select both units.
	
2.	 Use the From osnap option again, and using the Endpoint osnap, select the same corner 
you selected in step 5 of the previous exercise.
	
3.	 Enter @24<90 to start a mirror axis 24″ directly above the selected point. Metric users 
should enter @61<90.
	
4.	 With Ortho mode on, select a point so that the mirror axis is exactly horizontal.
	
5.	 At the Erase source objects? [Yes/No] <N>: prompt, press ↵ to keep the two unit 
plans you selected in step 1 and complete the mirror operation.

for the Mirror command.

228  | CHAPTER 7  Mastering Viewing Tools, Hatches, and External References   
With the tools you’ve learned about so far, you’ve quickly and accurately set up a fairly good por-
tion of the floor plan. Continue with the next few steps to “rough in” the main components of the floor:
	
1.	 Click Zoom Extents on the Navigation bar’s Zoom flyout to get a view of the four plans, 
or you can type Z↵E↵. The Extents option forces the entire drawing to fill the screen at 
the center of the display area. Your drawing will look like Figure 7.2.
Figure 7.2
The unit plan, 
duplicated four 
times
	
2.	 Copy the four units to the right at a distance of 28′-10″ (878 cm for metric users), which is 
the width of two units from center line to center line of the walls.
	
3.	 Insert the Lobby.dwg file from Chapter 6, “Editing and Reusing Data to Work Efficiently,” 
at coordinate 89′-1″,76′-1″ (2713,2318 for metric users).
	
4.	 Copy all of the unit plans to the right 74′-5″ (2267 cm for metric users), the width of 4 units 
plus the width of the lobby.
	
5.	 Click Zoom All on the Navigation bar’s Zoom flyout or type Z↵A↵ to view the entire 
drawing, which should look like Figure 7.3.

6.	 Click Save on the Quick Access toolbar to save this Plan.dwg file.

Taking Control of the AutoCAD Display |  229  
Taking Control of the AutoCAD Display
By now, you should be familiar with the Pan and Zoom functions in AutoCAD. Many other 
tools can also help you get around in your drawing. In the following sections, you’ll get a closer 
look at the ways you can view your drawing.
Understanding Regeneration and Redrawing
AutoCAD uses two commands for refreshing your drawing display: Regen (drawing regeneration) 
and Redraw. Each command serves a particular purpose, although it may not be clear to a new user.
To understand the difference between Regen and Redraw, keep in mind that AutoCAD stores 
drawing data in two ways:
◆
◆
In a database of highly accurate coordinate information that is part of the properties of 
objects in your drawing
◆
◆
In a simplified database used just for the display of the objects in your drawing
As you draw, AutoCAD starts to build an accurate, core database of objects and their prop-
erties. At the same time, it creates a simpler database that it uses just to display the drawing 
quickly. AutoCAD uses this second database to allow quick manipulation of the display of 
your drawing. For the purposes of this discussion, we’ll call this simplified database the virtual 
display because it’s like a computer model of the overall display of your drawing. This virtual 
display is, in turn, used as the basis for what is shown in the drawing area. When you issue 
a Redraw command, you’re telling AutoCAD to reread this virtual display data and display 
that information in the drawing area. A Regen command, on the other hand, tells AutoCAD to 
rebuild the virtual display based on information from the core drawing database.
You may notice that the Pan Realtime and Zoom Realtime commands don’t work beyond a 
certain area in the display. When you reach a point where these commands seem to stop work-
ing, you’ve come to the limits of the virtual display data. To go beyond these limits, AutoCAD 
must rebuild the virtual display data from the core data; in other words, it must regenerate the 
drawing. You can usually do this by zooming out to the extents of the drawing.
Sometimes, when you zoom in to a drawing, arcs and circles may appear to be faceted 
instead of smooth curves. This faceting is the result of the virtual display simplifying curves to 
conserve memory. You can force AutoCAD to display smoother curves by typing RE↵, which is 
the shortcut for the Regen command.
Creating Multiple Views
So far, you’ve looked at ways that will help you get around in your drawing while using a single 
view window. You can also set up multiple views of your drawing, called viewports. With viewports, 
you can display more than one view of your drawing at a time in the AutoCAD drawing area. For 
example, one viewport can display a close-up of the bathroom, another can display the overall plan 
view, and yet another can display the unit plan.
When viewports are combined with the Paper Space feature, you can plot multiple views of your 
drawing. Paper Space is a display mode that lets you arrange multiple views of a drawing. To find 
out more about viewports and Paper Space mode, see Chapter 15, “Laying Out Your Printer Output,” 
and Chapter 22, “Editing and Visualizing 3D Solids.”

230  | CHAPTER 7  Mastering Viewing Tools, Hatches, and External References   
Saving Views
Another way to control your views is by saving them. You might think of saving views as a way 
of creating a bookmark or a placeholder in your drawing.
Controlling Display Smoothness
As you work in AutoCAD, you may notice that linetypes sometimes appear continuous even when 
they’re supposed to be dotted or dashed. You may also notice that arcs and circles occasionally 
appear to be segmented lines although they’re always plotted as smooth curves. A command called 
Viewres controls how smoothly linetypes, arcs, and circles are displayed in an enlarged view.  
The lower the Viewres value, the fewer the segments and the faster the redraw and regeneration. However, 
a low Viewres value causes noncontinuous linetypes, such as dashes or center lines, to appear as though 
they’re continuous, especially in drawings that cover very large areas (for example, civil site plans).
Finding a Viewres value that best suits the type of work you do will take some experimentation. The 
default Viewres setting is 1000. You can try increasing the value to improve the smoothness of arcs 
and see if a higher value works for you. Enter Viewres↵↵ at the Command prompt to change the 
value. If you work with complex drawings, you may want to keep the value at 1000 and then, when 
you zoom in close to a view, use the Regen command to display smooth arcs and complete linetypes.
For example, a few walls in the Plan drawing aren’t complete. To add the lines, you’ll need to 
zoom into the areas that need work, but these areas are spread out over the drawing. AutoCAD 
lets you save views of the areas in which you want to work and then jump from one saved view 
to another saved view. This technique is especially helpful when you know you’ll often want to 
return to a specific area of your drawing.
You’ll see how to save and recall views in the following set of exercises. Here’s the first one:
	
1.	 Click the View Manager tool in the View tab’s Views panel. If you don’t see the Views 
panel, right-click in the View tab and select Show Panel ➢ Views. You can also type V↵ to 
open the View Manager dialog box (see Figure 7.4).
Figure 7.4
The View Manager 
dialog box

Taking Control of the AutoCAD Display |  231  
	
2.	 Make sure that the Current option is selected in the list to the left, and then click the 
New button to open the New View / Shot Properties dialog box (see Figure 7.5). You’ll 
notice some options related to the User Coordinate System (UCS) plus an option called 
View Category. You’ll get a chance to look at the UCS in Chapter 20 and Chapter 21, 
“Using Advanced 3D Features.” The View Category option relates to the Sheet Set feature 
described in Bonus Chapter 7, “Keeping a Project Organized with Sheet Sets,” available 
at www.omura.com/chapters. Other options, including Visual Style, Background, and 
Boundary, give you control over the appearance of the background and layout of a saved 
view. For now, you’ll concentrate on creating a new view.
Managing Saved Views
In the View Manager dialog box, you can call up an existing view (Set Current), create a new view 
(New), or get detailed information about a view. You can also select from a set of predefined views 
that include orthographic and isometric views of 3D objects. You’ll learn more about these options 
in Chapter 20, “Creating 3D Drawings.”
Figure 7.5

Properties dialog box

232  | CHAPTER 7  Mastering Viewing Tools, Hatches, and External References   
	
3.	 Click the Define Window radio button. The dialog boxes momentarily disappear, and the 
Dynamic Input display turns on.
	
4.	 At the Specify first corner: prompt, click two points to place a selection window 
around the area that surrounds the elevator lobby, as shown in Figure 7.6. Notice that the 
display changes so that the nonshaded area shows the area you selected. If you aren’t sat-
isfied with the selection area, you can place another window in the view.
Figure 7.6
Select this area for 
your saved view.
Elevator lobby
	
5.	 When you’re satisfied with your selection, press ↵ or right-click. The dialog boxes reappear.
	
6.	 Click the View Name text box, and type Elevator Lobby for the name of the view you just 
defined.
	
7.	 Click the OK button. The New View / Shot Properties dialog box closes, and you see 
Elevator Lobby in the Views list.
	
8.	 Click OK to close the View Manager dialog box.
	
9.	 Let’s see how to recall the view that you’ve saved. Type V↵ to open the View Manager, 
expand the Model Views option in the Views list, and select Elevator. Click Set Current 
and then click Apply and OK.

Taking Control of the AutoCAD Display |  233  
Your view changes to a close-up of the area you selected in step 4.
If you need to make adjustments to a view after you’ve created it, you can do so by following 
these steps: Right-click the view name in the View Manager dialog box, select Edit Boundaries, 
and then select a window as you did in steps 2 and 3.
Repeat the Last Command
Remember that when no command is active, you can right-click the drawing area and then select 
Recent Input to repeat a recently issued command. You can also right-click the drawing area when 
AutoCAD is idle and repeat the last command.
If you prefer, you can use the keyboard to invoke the View command and thus avoid all the 
dialog boxes:
	
1.	 Click Zoom Extents on the Navigation bar’s Zoom flyout, or type Z↵E↵.
	
2.	 Enter -View↵S↵ at the Command prompt, or use the -V↵S↵ shortcut. (Remember to use 
the minus sign in front of View or V.)
	
3.	 At the Enter view name to save: prompt, enter Overall↵.
	
4.	 Save the Plan file.
As you can see, this is a quick way to save a view. With the name Overall assigned to 
this view, you can easily recall it at any time. (Choosing the Zoom All flyout option from the 
Navigation bar gives you an overall view too, but it may zoom out too far for some purposes, or 
it may not show what you consider an overall view.)
Opening a File to a Particular View
The Select File dialog box contains a Select Initial View check box. If you open a drawing with this 
option selected, you’re greeted with a Select Initial View dialog box just before the opened file 
appears on the screen. This dialog box lists any views saved in the file. You can then go directly to 
a view by double-clicking the view name. If you’ve saved views and you know the name of the view 
you want, using Select Initial View saves time when you’re opening large files.
Understanding the Frozen Layer Option
As mentioned earlier, you may want to turn off certain layers to plot a drawing containing only 
selected layers. But even when layers are turned off, AutoCAD still takes the time to redraw and 
regenerate them. The Layer Properties Manager offers the Freeze option; this acts like the Off 
option, except that Freeze causes AutoCAD to ignore frozen layers when redrawing and regen-
erating a drawing. By freezing layers that aren’t needed for reference or editing, you can reduce 
the time AutoCAD takes to perform regens. You’ll find this capability helpful when working 
with large files.

234  | CHAPTER 7  Mastering Viewing Tools, Hatches, and External References   
Be aware, however, that the Freeze option affects blocks in an unusual way. Try the following 
exercise to see how the Freeze option makes entire blocks disappear:
	
1.	 Close the Plan file, and open the 07b-plan.dwg file from the sample files. Metric users 
should open 07b-plan-metric.dwg. This file is similar to the Plan file you created but 
with a few walls and stairs added to finish off the exterior. Also note that the individual 
units are blocks named 07a-unit or 07a-unit-metric. This will be important in a later 
exercise.
	
2.	 Open the Layer Properties Manager dialog box, and then set the current layer to 0.
	
3.	 Click the yellow lightbulb icon in the Plan1 layer listing to turn off that layer. Nothing 
changes in your drawing. Even though you turned off the Plan1 layer, the layer on which 
the unit blocks were inserted, the unit blocks remain visible.
	
4.	 Right-click in the layer list, choose Select All from the context menu, and then click a 
lightbulb icon (not the one you clicked in step 3). You see a message warning you that the 
current layer will be turned off. Click Turn The Current Layer Off. Now everything is 
turned off, including objects contained in the unit blocks.
	
5.	 Right-click in the layer list, choose Select All from the context menu, and then click a 
lightbulb icon to turn all the layers back on.
	
6.	 Click the Plan1 layer to select it and then click its Freeze/Thaw icon. (You can’t freeze the 
current layer.) The yellow sun icon changes to a gray snowflake, indicating that the layer 
is now frozen (see Figure 7.7). Only the unit blocks disappear.
Figure 7.7
Freezing the Plan1 
layer
Even though none of the objects in the unit blocks were drawn on the Plan1 layer, the entire 
contents of the blocks assigned to the Plan1 layer are frozen when Plan1 is frozen. Another way 
to freeze and thaw individual layers is by clicking the Freeze/Thaw icon (which looks like a 
sun) in the layer drop-down list in the Home tab’s Layers panel.
You don’t really need the Plan1 layer frozen. You froze it to see the effects of Freeze on blocks. 
Do the following to turn Plan1 back on:

Using Hatch Patterns in Your Drawings |  235  
	
1.	 Thaw layer Plan1 by going back to the Layer Properties Manager and clicking the snow-
flake icon in the Plan1 layer listing.
	
2.	 Turn off the Ceiling layer. Exit the dialog box by clicking the X in the Layer Properties 
Manager’s title bar.
The previous exercise showed the effect of freezing on blocks. When a block’s layer is frozen, 
the entire block is made invisible regardless of the layer assignments of the objects contained 
in the block.
Keep in mind that when blocks are on layers that aren’t frozen, the individual objects that 
are part of the block are still affected by the status of the layer to which they’re assigned. This 
means that if some objects in a block are on a layer called Wall and the Wall layer is turned off 
or frozen, then those objects become invisible. Objects within the block that aren’t on the layer 
that is off or frozen remain visible.
Using Hatch Patterns in Your Drawings
To help communicate your ideas to others, you’ll want to add graphic elements that represent 
types of materials, special regions, or textures. AutoCAD provides hatch patterns for quickly 
placing a texture over an area of your drawing. In the following sections, you’ll add a hatch pat-
tern to the floor of the studio apartment unit, thereby instantly enhancing the appearance of one 
drawing. In the process, you’ll learn how to update all the units in the overall floor plan quickly 
to reflect the changes in the unit.
Placing a Hatch Pattern in a Specific Area
It’s always a good idea to provide a separate layer for hatch patterns. By doing so, you can turn 
them off if you need to do so. For example, the floor paving pattern might be displayed in one 
drawing but turned off in another so that it won’t distract from other information.
In the following exercises, you’ll set up a layer for a hatch pattern representing floor tile and 
then add that pattern to your drawing. This will give you the opportunity to learn the different 
methods of creating and controlling hatch patterns.
Follow these steps to set up the layer:
	
1.	 Open the 07a-unit.dwg file. Metric users should open 07a-unit-metric.dwg. These 
files are similar to the Unit drawing that you created in earlier chapters, and they are 
used to create the overall plan in the 07b-plan and 07b-plan-metric files. Remember 
that you also still have the 07b-plan or 07b-plan-metric file open.
	
2.	 Zoom into the bathroom and kitchen area.
	
3.	 Create a new layer called FLR-PAT.
	
4.	 Make FLR-PAT the current layer.
Now that you’ve set up the layer for the hatch pattern, you can place the pattern in the 
drawing:
	
1.	 Click the Hatch tool on the Home tab’s Draw panel, or type H↵. The Hatch Creation 
Ribbon tab appears (see Figure 7.8).

236  | CHAPTER 7  Mastering Viewing Tools, Hatches, and External References   
	
2.	 In the Pattern drop-down list box of the Properties panel, select User Defined. The User 
Defined option lets you define a simple crosshatch pattern by specifying the line spacing 
of the hatch and whether it’s a single- or double-hatch pattern.
	
3.	 Click the Hatch Spacing text box in the lower-right corner of the Properties panel (see 
Figure 7.8), and enter 6 (metric users should enter 15). This tells AutoCAD that you want 
the hatch’s line spacing to be 6″, or 15 cm. Leave the Hatch Angle value at 0 because you 
want the pattern to be aligned with the bathroom.
	
4.	 Expand the Properties panel, and click the Double button. This tells AutoCAD that you 
want the hatch pattern to run both vertically and horizontally.
	
5.	 Hover the cursor over different parts of the bathroom layout, but don’t click anything. 
You will see a preview of your hatch pattern appear in each area over which you hover.
	
6.	 Click inside the area representing the bathroom floor. The hatch pattern is placed in the 
floor area. Notice that the area inside the door swing is not hatched. This is because the 
door swing area is not a contiguous part of the floor.
	
7.	 Click inside the door swing to place the hatch pattern.
	
8.	 Right-click and select Enter to exit the Hatch command, or press the Enter key.

Additional Hatch Features” later in this chapter for more on the Ignore setting.

Using Hatch Patterns in Your Drawings |  237  
As you saw from the exercise, AutoCAD gives you a preview of your hatch pattern before 
you place it in the drawing. In the previous steps, you set up the hatch pattern first by selecting 
the User Defined option, but you can reverse the order if you like. You can click in the areas you 
want to hatch first and then select a pattern, adjust the scale, and apply other hatch options.
Note 
Also note that in step 3, you are asked to change the Hatch Spacing setting. The name 
of this setting changes from Hatch Spacing to Hatch Pattern Scale when you use a predefined 
pattern instead of a user-defined one.
Matching Patterns
Say you want to add a hatch pattern that you’ve previously inserted in another part of the draw-
ing. With the Match Properties tool in the Options panel of the Hatch Creation tab, you can select 
a previously inserted hatch pattern as a prototype for the current hatch pattern. However, this 
feature doesn’t work with exploded hatch patterns.
Certiﬁcation
Objective
Adding Predefined Hatch Patterns
In the previous exercise, you used the User Defined option to create a simple crosshatch pattern. 
You also have a number of other predefined hatch patterns from which to choose. You can find 
other hatch patterns on the Internet, and if you can’t find the pattern you want, you can create 
your own (see Chapter 24, “Customizing Toolbars, Menus, Linetypes, and Hatch Patterns”).
Try the following exercise to see how you can add one of the predefined patterns available in 
AutoCAD:
	
1.	 Pan your view so that you can see the area below the kitchenette. Using the Rectangle 
tool in the Draw panel, draw the 8′-0″ by 3′-0″outline of the floor tile area, as shown in 
Figure 7.9. Metric users should create a rectangle that is 228 cm by 91 cm. You can also use 
a closed polyline.

2.	 Click the Hatch tool in the Draw panel.

238  | CHAPTER 7  Mastering Viewing Tools, Hatches, and External References   
	
3.	 In the Properties panel of the Hatch Creation Ribbon tab, select the Pattern option in the 
Hatch Type drop-down list.
	
4.	 Click the Hatch Pattern tool in the Pattern panel. (If you don’t see the Hatch Pattern tool, 
skip to step 6.) A flyout appears that displays a selection of hatch patterns (see Figure 7.10). 
This list has a scroll bar to the right that lets you view additional patterns.

5.	 Scroll down the flyout, and locate and select AR-PARQ1 (see Figure 7.10).
	
6.	 If you didn’t see the Hatch Pattern tool in step 4, scroll through the patterns in the Pattern 
panel using the down arrow to the right of the panel to locate and select the AR-PARQ1 
pattern. You can also expand the list by clicking the arrowhead below the scroll arrows 
(see Figure 7.10).
	
7.	 Click inside the rectangle you just drew.
	
8.	 If you are a metric user, set the Hatch Pattern Scale to 2.5. The Hatch Pattern Scale is the 
bottom option in the right-hand column in the Hatch Creation tab’s Properties panel.
	
9.	 Right-click and select Enter, or press the Enter key.
The predefined patterns with the AR prefix are architectural patterns that are drawn to full 
scale. In general, you should leave their Hatch Pattern Scale settings at 1. You can adjust the scale 
after you place the hatch pattern by using the Properties palette, as described later in this chapter.

Adding Solid Fills
You can use the Solid option from the Hatch Type drop-down list in the Hatch Creation tab’s 
Properties panel to create solid fills. The Hatch Color drop-down list lets you set the color of your 
solid fill. Remember that you can drag and drop solid fills and hatch patterns from the tool palettes 
you saw in Chapter 1, “Exploring the Interface.”

Objective
Positioning Hatch Patterns Accurately
If you’ve ever laid tile in a bathroom, you know that you have to select the starting point for 
your tiles carefully in order to get them to fit in an area with pleasing results. If you need to fine-
tune the position of a hatch pattern within an enclosed area, you can do so by using the options 
in the Origin panel of the Hatch Creation tab.
The main tool in the panel, Set Origin, lets you select an origin point for your hatch pattern. 
You can also use the Hporigin system variable to accomplish this. Or you can expand the Origin 
panel for a set of predefined origin locations. These locations are Bottom Left, Bottom Right, Top 
Left, Top Right, Center, and Use Current Origin. The Use Current Origin option refers to the X,Y 
origin of the drawing.
If you are hatching an irregular shape, these origin locations are applied to the bound-
ary extents of the shape. An imaginary rectangle represents the outermost boundary, or the 
boundary extents of the shape, as shown in Figure 7.11.

240  | CHAPTER 7  Mastering Viewing Tools, Hatches, and External References   
The Store As Default Origin option lets you save your selected origin as the default origin for 
future hatch patterns in the current drawing.
Now that you’ve learned how to add a hatch pattern, let’s continue with a look at how your 
newly edited plan can be used. In the next exercise, you’ll use this updated 07a-unit file to 
update all the units in the Plan file.
Updating a Block from an External File
As you progress through a design project, you make countless revisions. With traditional draft-
ing methods, revising a drawing, such as the studio apartment floor plan, takes a good deal of 
time. If you changed the bathroom layout, for example, you would have to erase every occur-
rence of the bathroom and redraw it 16 times. With AutoCAD, revising this drawing can be a 
quick operation. You can update the studio unit you just modified throughout the overall Plan 
drawing by replacing the current Unit block with the updated Unit file. AutoCAD can update 
all occurrences of the Unit block. The following exercise shows how this is accomplished.
For this exercise, remember that the blocks representing the units in the 07b-plan and 
07b-plan-metric files are named 07a-unit and 07a-unit-metric:
	
1.	 Make sure that you’ve saved the 07a-unit (07a-unit-metric for metric users) file 
with the changes, and then return to the 07b-plan file that is still open. Click the Open 
Documents tool from the Application menu, and then select 07b-plan.dwg. Metric users 
should use 07b-plan-metric.dwg.
You Can’t Update Exploded Blocks
Exploded blocks won’t be updated when you update blocks from an external file. If you plan to 
use this method to update parts of a drawing, don’t explode the blocks you plan to update. See 
Chapter 4, “Organizing Objects with Blocks and Groups.”
	
2.	 Click the Insert tool on the Home tab’s Block panel, and select More Options to open the 
Insert dialog box.
	
3.	 Click the Browse button. In the Select Drawing File dialog box, double-click the 07a-unit 
filename (07a-unit-metric for metric users).
	
4.	 Click OK in the Insert dialog box. A warning message tells you that a block already exists 
with the same name as the file. You can cancel the operation or redefine the block in the 
current drawing.

Using Hatch Patterns in Your Drawings |  241  
	
5.	 Click Redefine Block. The drawing regenerates.
	
6.	 At the Specify insertion point or [Basepoint/Scale/X/Y/Z/Rotate]: prompt, 
press the Esc key. You do this because you don’t want to insert the 07a-unit file into your 
drawing; you’re just using the Insert feature to update an existing block.
	
7.	 Zoom into one of the units. The floor tile appears in all the units as you drew it in the 
Unit file (see Figure 7.12).
Figure 7.12
The Plan draw-
ing with the tile 
pattern
Nested blocks must be updated independently of the parent block. For example, if you modi-
fied the Toilet block while editing the 07a-unit file and then updated the 07a-unit drawing in 
the 07b-plan file, the old Toilet block wouldn’t be updated. Even though the toilet is part of the 
07a-unit file, it’s still a unique, independent block in the Plan file, and AutoCAD won’t modify 
it unless specifically instructed to do so. In this situation, you must edit the original Toilet block 
and then update it in both the Plan and Unit files.
Substituting Blocks
In the exercise in “Updating a Block from an External File,” you updated a block in your Plan file 
by using the Browse option in the Insert dialog box. In that exercise, the block name and the file-
name were the same. You can also replace a block with another block or a file of a different name. 
Here’s how to do it:
	1.	 Open the Insert dialog box.
	2.	 Click the Browse button next to the Name text box, locate and select the file that you want to use 
as a substitute, and then click Open to return to the Insert dialog box.
continues

242  | CHAPTER 7  Mastering Viewing Tools, Hatches, and External References   
Also, block references and layer settings of the current file take priority over those of the 
imported file. For example, if a file to be imported has layers of the same name as the layers in 
the current file, but those layers have color and linetype assignments that are different from 
those in the current file, the current file’s layer color and linetype assignments determine those 
of the imported file. This doesn’t mean, however, that the imported file on disk is changed—
only that the insertion in the active drawing is affected.
Changing the Hatch Area
You may have noticed the Associative option in the Hatch Creation tab’s Options panel. When 
this option is turned on, AutoCAD creates an associative hatch pattern. Associative hatches 
adjust their shapes to any changes in their associated boundary, hence the name. The following 
exercise demonstrates how this works.
Suppose that you want to enlarge the tiled area of the kitchen by one tile. Here’s how it’s 
done:
	
1.	 Click the 07a-unit Drawing tab to switch to that drawing.
	
2.	 Click the outline border of the hatch pattern that you created earlier. Notice the grips that 
appear around the hatch-pattern area.
	
3.	 Shift+click the grip in the lower-left corner of the hatch area.
	
4.	 With the lower-left grip highlighted, Shift+click the lower-right grip.
	
5.	 Click the lower-right grip again, but don’t Shift+click this time.
continued
	3.	 Change the name in the Name text box to the name of the block you want replaced.
	4.	 Click OK. A warning message appears, telling you that a block with this name already exists. Click 
OK to proceed with the block substitution.
Another method is to type -Insert↵. (Don’t forget the minus sign in front of Insert.) At the Enter 
Block name or [?]: prompt, enter the block name followed by an equal sign (=), and then enter 
the name of the new block or the filename. Don’t include spaces between the name and the equal 
sign.
You can use this method of replacing blocks if you want to see how changing one element of your 
project can change your design. You might, for example, draw three different apartment unit plans 
and give each plan a unique name. You could then generate and plot three apartment building 
designs in a fraction of the time that it would take you to do so by hand.
Selecting Hatch Grips
If the boundary of the hatch pattern consists of line segments, you can use a crossing window or 
polygon-crossing window to select the corner grips of the hatch pattern.

Using Hatch Patterns in Your Drawings |  243  
	
6.	 Enter @12<–90↵↵ (@30<–90 for metric users) to widen the hatch pattern by 1′, or 30 cm for 
metric users. The hatch pattern adjusts to the new size of the hatch boundary.
	
7.	 Press the Esc key twice to clear any grip selections.
	
8.	 Choose Save from the Quick Access toolbar to save the Unit file.
	
9.	 Return to the 07b-plan file using the Drawing tab, and repeat the steps in the section 
“Updating a Block from an External File” earlier in this chapter to update the units again.
The Associative feature of hatch patterns can save time when you need to modify your draw-
ing, but you need to be aware of its limitations. A hatch pattern can lose its associativity when 
you do any of the following:
◆
◆
Erase or explode a hatch boundary
◆
◆
Erase or explode a block that forms part of the boundary
◆
◆
Move a hatch pattern away from its boundary
These situations frequently arise when you edit an unfamiliar drawing. Often, boundary 
objects are placed on a layer that is off or frozen, so the boundary objects aren’t visible. Also, the 
hatch pattern might be on a layer that is turned off and you proceed to edit the file not knowing 
that a hatch pattern exists. When you encounter such a file, take a moment to check for hatch 
boundaries so that you can deal with them properly.
Modifying a Hatch Pattern
Like everything else in a project, a hatch pattern may eventually need to be changed in some 
way. Hatch patterns are like blocks in that they act like single objects. You can explode a hatch 
pattern to edit its individual lines. The Properties palette contains most of the settings that 
you’ll need to make changes to your hatch patterns. But the most direct way to edit a hatch pat-
tern is to use the Hatch Editor Ribbon tab.
Editing Hatch Patterns from the Hatch Editor Tab
Follow these steps to modify a hatch pattern by using the Hatch Editor Ribbon tab:
	
1.	 Return to the Unit drawing.
	
2.	 Press the Esc key to clear any grip selections that may be active from earlier exercises.
	
3.	 Click the hatch pattern in the kitchen to open the Hatch Editor Ribbon tab. It’s the same 
as the Hatch Creation Ribbon tab.

Objective
A Double-Click Opens the Properties Palette

tools that you used to create it. If you prefer, you can right-click and select Properties to access 
the Properties palette.

4.	 In the Pattern panel, locate and click the pattern named AR-BRSTD. It’s the pattern that 
looks like a brick wall.

5.	 Press the Esc key to clear your selection of the hatch pattern. The AR-BRSTD pattern 
appears in place of the original parquet pattern.
	
6.	 Save and exit your file.
In this exercise, you were able to change the hatch just by clicking it. Although you changed 
only the pattern type, other options are available. You can, for example, modify a predefined 
pattern to a user-defined one by selecting User Defined from the Hatch Type drop-down list in 
the Properties panel of the Hatch Editor tab.
You can then enter angle and scale values for your hatch pattern in the options provided in 
the Properties panel of the Hatch Editor tab.
The other items in the Hatch Editor Ribbon tab are duplicates of the options in the Hatch 
Creation tab. They let you modify the individual properties of the selected hatch pattern. The 
upcoming section “Understanding the Boundary Hatch Options” describes these other proper-
ties in detail.
Editing Hatch Patterns from the Properties Palette
If you prefer, you can use the older method to edit a hatch pattern. To open the Properties 
palette, select and right-click the hatch pattern that you want to edit and then select Properties. 
The Properties palette displays a Pattern category, which offers a Pattern Name option (see 
Figure 7.13). The actual pattern name appears to the right of the option.

box. The Type option in the Properties palette lets you change the type of hatch pattern from 
Predefined to User Defined or Custom.

Understanding the Boundary Hatch Options |  245  
Understanding the Boundary Hatch Options
The Hatch Creation and Hatch Editor Ribbon panels offer many other options that you didn’t 
explore in the previous exercises. For example, instead of clicking in the area to be hatched, you 
can select the objects that bound the area you want to hatch by clicking the Select Boundary 
Objects tool in the Boundaries panel. You can use the Select Boundary Objects tool to add 
boundaries to existing hatch patterns as well.
Controlling Boundaries with the Boundaries Panel
The previous exercises in this chapter have just touched upon the tools in the Boundaries 
panel. Other options in the Boundaries panel are Pick Points, Select Boundary Objects, Remove 
Boundary Objects, and Recreate Boundary.
Pick Points    Lets you place a hatch pattern across several enclosed areas by clicking inside 
the areas. This is the default selection mode.
Select Boundary Objects    Lets you select objects to define a hatch boundary.
Remove Boundary Objects    Lets you remove a bounded area, or island, in the area to be 
hatched. An example is the toilet seat in the bathroom. This option is available only when 
you select a hatch area by using the Pick Points option and an island has been detected.
Recreate Boundary    Draws a region or polyline around the current hatch pattern. You’re then 
prompted to choose between a region and a polyline and to specify whether to reassociate the 
pattern with the re-created boundary. (See the Associative option discussed in a moment.)
Fine-Tuning the Boundary Behavior
The Boundary Hatch feature is view dependent—that is, it locates boundaries based on what is 
visible in the current view. If the current view contains a lot of graphic data, AutoCAD can have 
difficulty finding a boundary or can be slow in finding a boundary. If you run into this problem 
or if you want to single out a specific object for a point selection boundary, you can further 
Figure 7.14
The Hatch Pattern 
Palette dialog box

246  | CHAPTER 7  Mastering Viewing Tools, Hatches, and External References   
limit the area that AutoCAD uses to locate hatch boundaries by using the Boundary Set options 
found in the expanded Boundaries panel:
Display Boundary Objects    Highlights the objects that have been selected as the hatch 
boundary by AutoCAD.
Don’t Retain/Retain Boundary Objects    Retains outlines used to create the hatch pattern, 
a capability that can be helpful if you want to duplicate the shape of the boundary for other 
purposes. Typically, this option is set to Don’t Retain Boundaries, but you can use two other 
settings: Retain Boundaries – Polyline and Retain Boundaries – Regions.
Select New Boundary Set    Lets you select the objects that you want AutoCAD to use to 
determine the hatch boundary instead of searching the entire view. The screen clears and lets 
you select objects. This option discards previous boundary sets. It’s useful for hatching areas 
in a drawing that contains many objects that you don’t want to include in the hatch boundary.
Use Current Viewport    Uses the current viewport extents to define the boundary set.
The Boundary Set options give you more control over the way a point selection boundary is 
created. These options have no effect when you use the Select Boundary Objects button to select 
specific objects for the hatch boundary.
Boundary Retention
The Hatch command can also create an outline of the hatch area by using one of two objects: 2D 
regions, which are like 2D planes, or polyline outlines. Hatch creates such a polyline boundary 
temporarily to establish the hatch area. These boundaries are automatically removed after the 
hatch pattern is inserted. If you want to retain the boundaries in the drawing, make sure that 
the Retain Boundaries – Polyline option is selected. Retaining the boundary can be useful if you 
know that you’ll be hatching the area more than once or if you’re hatching a fairly complex area.
Retaining a hatch boundary is useful if you want to know the hatched area’s dimensions in square 
inches or feet because you can find the area of a closed polyline by using the List command. See 
Chapter 2, “Creating Your First Drawing,” for more on the List command.
Controlling Hatch Behavior with the Options Panel
The Options panel offers a set of tools that control some additional features of the Hatch com-
mand. These features affect the way a hatch pattern fills a boundary area as well as how it 
behaves when the drawing is edited. Note that the Gap Tolerance, Create Separate Hatches, 
Normal Island Detection, and Send Behind Boundary options are on the expanded Options 
panel. The following gives you a brief description of each of the Options panel’s options:
Associative    Allows the hatch pattern to adjust to changes in its boundary. With this option 
turned on, any changes to the associated boundary of a hatch pattern cause the hatch pattern 
to flow with the changes in the boundary.
Annotative Scale    Allows the hatch pattern to adjust to different scale views of your draw-
ing. With this option turned on, a hatch pattern’s size or spacing adjusts to the annotation scale 
of a viewport layout or Model Space mode. See Chapter 4 for more on the annotation scale.
Match Properties    This group allows you to use an existing hatch pattern when inserting 
additional hatch patterns into a drawing. Select Use Current Origin when you want to use 

Understanding the Boundary Hatch Options |  247  
the current default hatch origin. Select Use Source Hatch Origin when you want to use the 
origin from the existing hatch pattern.
Gap Tolerance    Lets you hatch an area that isn’t completely enclosed. The Gap Tolerance 
value sets the maximum gap size in the perimeter of an area that you want to hatch. You can 
use a value from 0 to 5000.
Create Separate Hatches    Creates separate and distinct hatches if you select several 
enclosed areas while selecting hatch areas. With this option off, separate hatch areas behave 
as a single hatch pattern.
Outer Island Detection    Controls how islands within a hatch area are treated. Islands are 
enclosed areas that are completely inside a hatch boundary. There are four options in this list:
Normal Island Detection    This causes the hatch pattern to alternate between nested 
boundaries. The outer boundary is hatched; if there is a closed object within the bound-
ary, it isn’t hatched. If another closed object is inside the first closed object, that object is 
hatched. This is the default setting.
Outer Island Detection    This applies the hatch pattern to an area defined by the outer-
most boundary and a closed object within that boundary. Any boundaries nested in that 
closed object are ignored.
Ignore Island Detection    This supplies the hatch pattern to the entire area within the 
outermost boundary, ignoring any nested boundaries.
No Island Detection    This turns off island detection. This option is not available if you 
have already added a hatch pattern to your drawing.
Send Behind Boundary (Draw Order)    Allows you to specify whether the hatch pattern 
appears on top of or underneath its boundary. This is useful when the boundary is of a dif-
ferent color or shade and must read clearly or when the hatch pattern must cover the bound-
ary. The options in this list are self-explanatory and are Do Not Assign, Send To Back, Bring 
To Front, Send Behind Boundary, and Bring In Front Of Boundary. See “Overlapping Objects 
with Draw Order” later in this chapter.
Controlling Hatch Default Layer, Layout Scale, and ISO Line Weight
The expanded Properties panel contains a few items that you’ll want to be aware of as you 
become more familiar with AutoCAD. You’ve already seen how the Double option works when 
you are creating user-defined hatch patterns. The following list describes several other options 
that are available:
Hatch Layer Override    Allows you to select the default layer for hatch patterns. Select a 
layer name from the drop-down list. New hatch patterns you add to the drawing will be 
placed on the selected layer instead of the current one.
Relative To Paper Space    Allows you to change a hatch pattern’s scale to one that is relevant 
to the current Paper Space view. This option is available only while you are in a layout tab 
and when you’re using a pattern that is not user defined.
ISO Pen Width    Allows you to select an ISO pen width for the lines of a hatch pattern. This 
option is available only when you are using ISO patterns.

248  | CHAPTER 7  Mastering Viewing Tools, Hatches, and External References   
Annotative Hatch Patterns
In Chapter 4, you learned about a feature called the annotation scale. With this tool, you can assign 
several scales to certain types of objects and AutoCAD displays the object to the proper scale of the 
drawing. You can take advantage of this feature to allow hatch patterns to adjust their spacing or 
pattern size to the scale of your drawing. The Annotative option in the Options panel of the Hatch 
Creation Ribbon tab turns on the annotation scale feature for hatch patterns. Once this capability 
is turned on for a hatch pattern, you can set up the drawing scales that you want to apply to the 
hatch pattern using the same methods described for blocks in Chapter 4.
Using Additional Hatch Features
The Hatch command has a fair amount of “intelligence.” As you saw in an earlier exercise, it was 
able to detect not only the outline of the floor area but also the outline of the toilet seat that repre-
sents an island in the pattern area. If you prefer, you can control how AutoCAD treats these island 
conditions and other situations by selecting options available in the Hatch Creation and Hatch 
Editor Ribbon tab. You can also create and edit hatch patterns using the Hatch And Gradient dia-
log box (see Figure 7.15), which should be familiar to anyone who has used AutoCAD before.
To open the Hatch And Gradient dialog box, start the Hatch command by clicking the Hatch 
tool in the Home tab’s Draw panel, and then click the Hatch Settings tool in the right side of the 
Options panel title bar. This opens the Hatch And Gradient dialog box. Click the More Options 
button in the lower-right corner of this dialog box.
Figure 7.15

And Gradient dialog

This button expands the dialog box to show additional hatch options (Figure 7.15).
Nearly all of the settings and tools in the Hatch And Gradient dialog box are repeated in the 
Hatch Creation and Hatch Editor Ribbon tabs. They are just presented in a different way.
Hatch Boundaries Without the Hatch Pattern
The Boundary command creates a polyline outline or region in a selected area. It works much like 
the Retain Boundary – Polyline option but doesn’t add a hatch pattern.
Using Gradient Shading
You may have noticed Solid and Gradient options in the Pattern drop-down list. The solid hatch 
pattern lets you apply a solid color instead of a pattern to a bounded area. AutoCAD also offers 
a set of gradient patterns that let you apply a color gradient to an area.
You can apply a gradient to an area using the same method that you used to apply a hatch 
pattern, but when you select the Gradient option, you’ll see a slight change in the Hatch 
Creation tab panels. The Hatch Pattern Scale text box in the Properties panel changes to a Tint 
slider, and the Pattern panel changes to show a set of different gradient patterns. The Origin 
panel also changes to show Centered as the only option (see Figure 7.16). The Hatch Color and 
Background Color options in the Properties panel change to Gradient Color 1 and Gradient 
Color 2, enabling you to set the gradient colors.

Instead of offering hatch patterns, the Pattern panel offers a variety of gradient patterns. If 
you don’t see the gradient patterns, you can click the Hatch Pattern tool to open a flyout of the 
gradient patterns. The Properties panel lets you control the colors of the gradient. You can select 
the colors from the two-color drop-down lists in the Properties panel.

250  | CHAPTER 7  Mastering Viewing Tools, Hatches, and External References   
If you don’t see a color that you want, you can click the Select Colors option at the bottom 
of the list to open the Select Color dialog box. This dialog box lets you choose from Index, True 
Color, or Color Books colors (see Figure 7.17).

dialog box
The Gradient Tint And Shade slider just to the right of the color drop-down lists lets you con-
trol the shade of the single-color gradient.
Choosing Between a Single Color or Two Colors
You can choose a gradient that transitions between shades of a single color by clicking the 
Gradient Tint And Shade tool in the Properties panel just to the left of the Tint slider. This turns 
on the Gradient Tint And Shade slider and disables the Color 2 drop-down list. When you turn 
off the Gradient Tint And Shade button, the Gradient Tint slider is disabled and the Gradient 
Color 2 drop-down list is enabled.
Selecting Gradient Patterns
As mentioned earlier, you can choose from a set of gradient patterns in the Pattern panel. 
The Angle slider gives you further control over the gradient pattern by allowing you to 
rotate the angle of the pattern. The Centered option in the Origin panel places the center of 
the gradient at the center of the area selected for the pattern. This option is a toggle that is 
either on or off.
To place a gradient pattern, select a set of objects or a point in a bounded area, just as you 
would for a hatch pattern.
Tips for Using Hatch
Here are a few tips for using the Hatch feature:
◆
◆
Watch out for boundary areas that are part of a large block. AutoCAD examines the entire 
block when defining boundaries. This can take time if the block is large. Use the Specify 

Understanding the Boundary Hatch Options |  251  
Boundary Set option to focus on the set of objects that you want AutoCAD to use for your 
hatch boundary.
◆
◆
The Hatch feature is view dependent—that is, it locates boundaries based on what is vis-
ible in the current view. To ensure that AutoCAD finds every detail, zoom in to the area to 
be hatched.
◆
◆
If the area to be hatched is large yet requires fine detail, first outline the hatch area 
by using a polyline. (See Chapter 18, “Drawing Curves,” for more on polylines.) Then 
use the Select Boundary Objects option in the Hatch Creation tab’s Boundaries panel 
to select the polyline boundary manually instead of depending on Hatch to find the 
boundary for you.
◆
◆
Consider turning off layers that might interfere with the ability of AutoCAD to find a 
boundary.
◆
◆
Hatch works on nested blocks as long as the nested block entities are parallel to the current 
User Coordinate System. You’ll learn more about the User Coordinate System in Chap­
ter 20 and Chapter 21.
Space Planning and Hatch Patterns
Suppose that you’re working on a plan in which you’re constantly repositioning equipment and 
furniture or you’re in the process of designing the floor covering. You might be a little hesitant 
to place a hatch pattern on the floor because you don’t want to have to rehatch the area each time 
you move a piece of equipment or change the flooring. You have two options in this situation: 
You can use the Hatch feature’s associative capabilities to include the furnishings in the bound-
ary set, or you can use the Display Order feature.
Using Associative Hatch
Associative Hatch is the most straightforward method. Make sure that the Associative 
option is selected in the Hatch Creation tab’s Options panel, and include your equipment or 
furniture in the boundary set. You can do this by using the Select option in the Boundaries 
panel.
After the pattern is in place, the hatch pattern automatically adjusts to its new location when 
you move the furnishings in your drawing. One drawback, however, is that AutoCAD attempts 
to hatch the interior of your furnishings if they cross the outer boundary of the hatch pattern. 
Also, if any boundary objects are erased or exploded, the hatch pattern no longer follows the 
location of your furnishings. To avoid these problems, you can use the method described in the 
next section.
Overlapping Objects with Draw Order
The Draw Order feature lets you determine how objects overlap. In the space-planning 
example, you can create furniture by using a solid hatch to indicate horizontal surfaces (see 
Figure 7.18).

Matching a Hatch Pattern and Other Properties Quickly
Another tool to help you edit hatch patterns is Match Properties, which is similar to Format Painter 
in Microsoft Office. This tool lets you change an existing hatch pattern to match another existing 
hatch pattern. Here’s how to use it:
	1.	 Choose Match Properties from the Home tab’s Properties panel or type Matchprop↵.
	2.	 Click the source hatch pattern that you want to copy.
	3.	 Click the target hatch pattern that you want to change. The target pattern changes to match the 
source pattern.
The Match Properties tool transfers other properties as well, such as layer, color, and linetype 
settings. You can select the properties that are transferred by opening the Property Settings 
dialog box.

Objective

Understanding the Boundary Hatch Options |  253  
To open this dialog box, type S↵ after selecting the object in step 2, or right-click and choose 
Settings from the context menu. You can then select the properties that you want to transfer from 
the options shown. All of the properties are selected by default. You can also transfer text and 
dimension style settings. You’ll learn more about text and dimension styles in Chapter 9, “Adding 
Text to Drawings,” and Chapter 11, “Using Dimensions.”
You can then place the furniture on top of a floor-covering pattern and the pattern will be 
covered and hidden by the furniture. Here’s how to do that. (These steps aren’t part of the regu-
lar exercises of this chapter. They’re shown here as general guidelines when you need to use the 
Draw Order feature.)
	
1.	 Draw the equipment outline, and make sure that the outline is a closed polygon.
	
2.	 Start the Hatch tool described earlier in this chapter, and place a solid hatch pattern 
inside the equipment outline.
	
3.	 In the Hatch Creation tab’s expanded Options panel, make sure that Send To Back is 
selected in the Draw Order drop-down list.
	
4.	 Turn the outline and solid hatch into a block, or use the Group command to group 
them.
	
5.	 Move your equipment drawing into place over the floor pattern.
	
6.	 Click the floor hatch pattern and then, in the Hatch Editor tab’s expanded Options panel, 
select Send To Back from the Draw Order drop-down list.

254  | CHAPTER 7  Mastering Viewing Tools, Hatches, and External References   
After you take these steps, the equipment will appear to rest on top of the pattern. (See the 
bottom panel in Figure 7.18.) You can also change the display order of objects relative to other 
objects in the drawing using the Draworder flyout in the Home tab’s Modify panel.
The Draworder options are all part of the Draworder command. As an alternative to using 
the Ribbon, you can type Draworder↵ at the Command prompt, select an object, and then enter 
an option at the prompt:
Enter object ordering option
[Above objects/Under objects/Front/Back] <Back>:
For example, the equivalent of choosing the Send To Back tool from the Draworder flyout is 
entering Draworder↵B↵. You can also select the object that you want to edit, right-click, and 
then choose Draw Order from the context menu.
You’ve now had a detailed look at hatch patterns and fills. Remember that you can also use 
the tool palettes to help organize and simplify access to your favorite hatch patterns, or you can 
use the patterns already available in the tool palettes. The patterns in the tool palettes can be 
edited and manipulated in the same way as described in this chapter. If you want to know how 
to make full use of the tool palettes, check out the discussion on the AutoCAD DesignCenter™ 
in Chapter 25, “Managing and Sharing Your Drawings.”
Take a Break
If you’re working through the tutorial in this chapter, this would be a good place to take a break 
or stop. You can pick up the next exercise in the section “Attaching a Drawing as an External 
Reference” at another time.
Using External References
AutoCAD allows you to import drawings in a way that keeps the imported drawing inde-
pendent from the current one. A drawing imported in this way is called an external reference 
(Xref). Unlike drawings that have been imported as blocks, Xref files don’t become part of the 
drawing’s database. Instead, they’re loaded along with the current file at startup time. It’s as if 
AutoCAD were opening several drawings at once: the currently active file you specify when you 
start AutoCAD and any file inserted as an Xref.
Certiﬁcation
Objective

Using External References |  255  
If you keep Xref files independent from the current file, any changes you make to the Xref 
automatically appear in the current file. You don’t have to update the Xref file manually as you 
do blocks. For example, if you use an Xref to insert the Unit file into the Plan file and you later 
make changes to the Unit file, you will see the new version of the Unit file in place of the old 
one the next time you open the Plan file. If the Plan file was still open while edits were made, 
AutoCAD will notify you that a change has been made to an Xref.
Blocks and Xrefs Can’t Have the Same Name
You can’t use a file as an Xref if the file has the same name as a block in the current drawing. If this 
situation occurs but you still need to use the file as an Xref, you can rename the block of the same 
name by using the Rename command. You can also use Rename to change the name of various 
objects and named elements.
Another advantage of Xref files is that, because they don’t become part of a drawing’s data-
base, drawing size is kept to a minimum. This results in more efficient use of your hard disk 
space.
Xref files, like blocks, can be edited only by using special tools. You can, however, use osnaps 
to snap to a location in an Xref file, or you can freeze or turn off the Xref file’s insertion layer to 
make it invisible.
Attaching a Drawing as an External Reference
The next exercise shows how to use an Xref in place of an inserted block to construct the studio 
apartment building. You’ll first create a new unit file by copying the old one. Then you’ll bring a 
new feature, the External References palette, to the screen. Follow these steps to create the new 
file:
	
1.	 Use the Drawing tab at the top of the drawing area to return to the 07a-unit file.
	
2.	 Choose Save As from the Application menu to save it under the name unitxref.dwg, 
and then close the unitxref.dwg file. This will make a copy of the 07a-unit.dwg file for 
the following steps. Or, if you prefer, you can use the unitxref.dwg file for the following 
steps.
	
3.	 Return to the 07b-plan file, choose Save As, and save the file under the name Planxref. 
The current file is now Planxref.dwg.
	
4.	 Erase all of the unit plans (E↵All↵). In the next step, you’ll purge the unit plans from the 
file. (By completing steps 2 through 4, you save yourself from having to set up a new file.)
	
5.	 Choose Drawing Utilities ➢ Purge from the Application menu to open the Purge 
dialog box.
	
6.	 Select the Purge nested items option and then click the Purge All button to open the 
Confirm Purge dialog box. This purges blocks and layers that aren’t in use in the 
drawing.
	
7.	 Click Purge All Items and close the Purge dialog box.

256  | CHAPTER 7  Mastering Viewing Tools, Hatches, and External References   
Now you’re ready to use the External References palette:
	
1.	 Click the External References tool in the Insert tab’s Reference panel title bar or type XR↵ 
to open the External References palette (see Figure 7.19).
Figure 7.19
The External 
References palette
	
2.	 Click the Attach DWG button in the upper-left corner of the palette to open the Select 
Reference File dialog box. This is a typical AutoCAD file dialog box complete with a pre-
view window.
	
3.	 Locate and select the unitxref.dwg file, and then click Open to open the Attach 
External Reference dialog box (see Figure 7.20). Notice that this dialog box looks simi-
lar to the Insert dialog box. It offers the same options for insertion point, scale, and 
rotation.
	
4.	 You’ll see a description of the options presented in this dialog box. For now, click OK.
	
5.	 Enter 31′-5″,43′-8″↵ (metric users enter 957,1330) for the insertion point.
	
6.	 The inserted plan may appear faded. If it does, click the Xref Fading tool in the Insert 
tab’s expanded Reference panel to turn off the Xref Fading feature. This will give the plan 
a more solid appearance.

Using External References |  257  
	
7.	 After unitxref.dwg is inserted, re-create the same layout of the floor plan that you created 
in the first section of this chapter by copying and mirroring the unitxref.dwg external 
reference.
	
8.	 Save the Planxref file.
You now have a drawing that looks like the 07b-plan.dwg file that you worked with earlier 
in this chapter, but instead of blocks that are detached from their source file, you have a draw-
ing composed of Xrefs. These Xrefs are the actual unitxref.dwg file, and they’re loaded into 
AutoCAD at the same time that you open the Planxref.dwg file. An icon in the lower-right cor-
ner of the AutoCAD window tells you that the current drawing contains Xrefs.
Not only does this icon alert you to Xrefs, but it also enables you to open the External 
References palette, as you’ll see in the next exercise.
Figure 7.20
The Attach External 
Reference dialog box
Fading Xrefs
In step 6 of the previous exercise, you saw the Xref Fading tool. This tool is an aid to help you visualize 
which objects in your drawing are Xrefs. To the right of the Xref tool is the Xref Fading slider, which lets 
you control the amount of fading that is applied to the Xrefs in your drawing. You can either move the 
slider or enter a fading value in the text box to the far right. The Xref Fading tool affects only the appear-
ance of the Xref in the drawing. It does not cause the Xref to fade in your printed or plotted output.

258  | CHAPTER 7  Mastering Viewing Tools, Hatches, and External References   
Next, you’ll modify the unitxref.dwg file and see the results in the Planxref.dwg file:
	
1.	 To open the unitxref.dwg file, from the current Planxref file, select and then right-click 
a unit and choose Open Xref from the context menu. You can also enter Xopen↵ at the 
Command prompt and then select the unit plan Xref.
	
2.	 Erase the hatch patterns and kitchen outline for the floors, and save the unitxref.dwg file.
	
3.	 Use the Drawing tab to return to the Planxref.dwg file. You see a message balloon point-
ing to the Manage Xrefs icon in the lower-right corner of the AutoCAD window. The 
balloon warns you that an Xref has changed. Right-click the Manage Xrefs icon in the 
lower-right corner of the AutoCAD window, and then choose External References from 
the pop-up menu to open the External References palette.
	
4.	 Right-click the unitxref name in the list box and then click Reload. Notice that the units 
in the Planxref drawing have been updated to include the changes that you made to the 
unitxref file.
You may have noticed that there is a Reload DWG Xrefs option in the Manage Xrefs icon 
context menu. This option will reload all Xrefs in the current drawing without requiring you to 
select the individual file to reload in the External References palette.
Also, you may have noticed the Open option in step 4 when you used the right-click menu in 
the External References palette. This option performs the same function as the Xopen command, 
which opens the selected Xref for editing.
Be aware that when an Xref has been modified, the Manage Xrefs icon at the lower right of 
the AutoCAD window changes to show an exclamation point. This alerts you to changes in an 
Xref being used by the current drawing.
Click the Manage Xrefs icon to open the External References palette. The Xref that has been 
changed is indicated by a warning icon in the Status column of the list box along with the 
“Needs reloading” message.
You can then select the Xref that needs to be updated, right-click, and choose the Reload 
option from the context menu to reload the selected Xref. You can also select multiple Xrefs 
if more than one needs updating. Another option is to select Reload All References from the 
Refresh flyout at the top of the External References palette.
Here you saw how an Xref file is updated in a different way than a block. Because Xrefs are 
loaded along with the drawing file that contains them, the containing file, which in this case 
was the Planxref file, automatically displays any changes made to the Xref when it’s opened. 
Also, you avoid having to update nested blocks because AutoCAD updates nested Xrefs as well 
as non-nested Xrefs. When an Xref is modified while you’re editing a file, you’re alerted to the 
change through the Xref icon located in the lower-right corner of the AutoCAD window. You 
can click the balloon message that appears from that icon to update any modified Xrefs.

Using External References |  259  
Other Differences Between External References and Blocks
Here are a few other differences between Xrefs and inserted blocks that you’ll want to keep in 
mind:
◆
◆
Any new layers, text styles, or linetypes brought in with Xref files don’t become part of 
the current file. If you want to import any of these items, you can use the Xbind command 
(described in Chapter 14, “Advanced Editing and Organizing”).
◆
◆
If you make changes to the layers of an Xref file, those changes aren’t retained when the file 
is saved unless you checked the Retain Changes To Xref Layers option in the Open And 
Save tab of the Options dialog box. This option, found in the External References (Xrefs) 
group, instructs AutoCAD to remember any layer color or visibility settings from one edit-
ing session to the next. In the standard AutoCAD settings, this option is on by default.
◆
◆
Another way to ensure that layer settings for Xrefs are retained is to enter Visretain↵ at the 
Command prompt. At the New value for VISRETAIN <0>: prompt, enter 1.
◆
◆
To segregate layers in Xref files from layers in the current drawing, AutoCAD prefixes the 
names of the Xref file’s layers with their file’s name. A vertical bar separates the filename 
prefix and the layer name when you view a list of layers in the layer drop-down list or the 
Layer Properties Manager dialog box (as in unitxref | wall).
◆
◆
You can’t explode Xrefs. You can, however, convert an Xref into a block and then explode it. 
To do so, select the Xref in the External References palette, then right-click and choose Bind 
to open another dialog box that offers two ways of converting an Xref into a block. See the 
section “Other External Reference Options” later in this chapter for more information.
◆
◆
If an Xref is renamed or moved to another location on your hard disk, AutoCAD won’t be 
able to find that file when it opens other files to which the Xref is attached. If this happens, 
you must select the path in the Found At field at the bottom of the External References pal-
ette and then click the Browse button (the ellipsis) to tell AutoCAD where to find the cross-
referenced file.
◆
◆
Take care when retargeting an Xref file with the Browse button. The Browse button can 
assign a file of a different name to an existing Xref as a substitution.
◆
◆
Xref files are especially useful in workgroup environments in which several people are 
working on the same project. For example, one person might be updating several files that 
are inserted into a variety of other files. If blocks are used, everyone in the workgroup 
would have to be notified of the changes and would have to update all the affected blocks 
in all the drawings that contained them. With Xref files, however, the updating is auto-
matic; you avoid confusion about which files need their blocks updated. 
Importing Blocks, Layers, and Other Named Elements from External 
Files
You can use the Xbind command to import blocks and other named elements from another file. 
First, use the External References palette to cross-reference a file; type Xbind at the Command 
continues

260  | CHAPTER 7  Mastering Viewing Tools, Hatches, and External References   
Other External Reference Options
Many other features are unique to external reference files. Let’s briefly look at some of the other 
options in the External References palette.
Options in the External References Palette
Several options are available when you right-click an external reference name listed in the 
External References palette, as shown in Figure 7.20 earlier in this chapter. You saw the Reload 
option in an earlier exercise. The following other options are available:
Attach    Opens the Attach External Reference dialog box, in which you can select a file to 
attach and set the parameters for the attachment.
Detach    Detaches an Xref from the current file. The file is then completely disassociated 
from the current file.
Reload    Restores an unloaded Xref.
Unload    Similar to Detach, but maintains a link to the Xref file so that it can be quickly reat-
tached. This has an effect similar to freezing a layer and can reduce redraw, regeneration, 
and file-loading times.
Bind    Converts an Xref into a block. Bind offers two options: Bind and Insert. The Bind 
option maintains the Xref’s named elements (layers, linetypes, and text and dimension styles) 
by creating new layers in the current file with the Xref’s filename prefix (discussed again in 
Chapter 14). The Insert option doesn’t attempt to maintain the Xref’s named elements but 
merges them with named elements of the same name in the current file. For example, if both 
the Xref and the current file have layers of the same name, the objects in the Xref are placed 
in the layers of the same name in the current file.
continued
prompt. In the Xbind dialog box, click the plus sign next to the Xref filename, and then click the 
plus sign next to Block. Select the name of the block that you want to import, click the Add but-
ton, and click OK. Finally, open the External References palette, select the Xref filename from the 
list, right-click, and select Detach to remove the Xref file. The imported block remains as part of 
the current file. (See Chapter 14 for details on importing named elements.) You can also use the 
AutoCAD Content Explorer™ to import named elements from external files. Content Explorer is 
described in Chapter 25.
The tool palettes give you access to frequently used blocks and hatch patterns that reside in other 
drawings. You can open the tool palettes by clicking the Tool Palettes tool in the View tab’s Palettes 
panel.
In standard AutoCAD installations, the tool palette window is configured with sample 3D com-
mands (not in the AutoCAD LT® software), blocks, and hatch patterns that you can drag and drop 
into your current drawing. Select a tab for the tool palette that contains the block or pattern that 
you want, and then click and drag the item into your drawing. In the case of hatch patterns, click 
and drag the pattern into an area that is bounded on all sides by objects. When you’re ready to 
customize the tool palette window, you do so by clicking and dragging objects or tools into a new 
or existing palette. See Chapter 24 for more on customizing tool palettes.

Using External References |  261  
Open    Lets you open an Xref. Select the Xref from the list, and then click Open. The Xref 
opens in a new window when you close the External References palette.
Path    Enables you to remove the path to the Xref file (shown in the Found At option of the 
Details panel) or change it from a full path to a relative path.
Details    A panel at the bottom of the External References palette. It’s similar to the 
Properties palette in that it displays the properties of a selected external reference and 
also allows you to modify some of those properties. For example, the Reference Name 
option in the Details panel lets you give the external reference a name that is differ-
ent from the Xref filename. Table 7.1 gives you a rundown of the options in the Details 
panel.
Table 7.1:	
The Details panel of the External References palette
Option
Function
Reference Name
Lets you give the Xref a different name from the Xref’s filename. This can be 
helpful if you want to use multiple external references of the same file.
Status
Tells you whether the Xref is loaded, unloaded, or not found (read only).
Size
Gives you the file size information (read only).
Type
Lets you choose between the Attach and Overlay attachment methods for the 
Xref file. Xrefs attached as overlays don’t include nested Xrefs.
Date
Gives you the date and time that the file was attached (read only).
Found At
Tells you where AutoCAD expects to find the Xref file (read only).
Saved Path
Lets you select the location of the Xref file. When you click the text box for this 
option, a Browse button appears to the right. You can click this button to 
locate a lost Xref or use a different file from the original attached Xref.
The Attach External Reference Dialog Box
The Attach External Reference dialog box, shown in Figure 7.20 earlier in this chapter, offers 
these options:
Browse    Opens the Select Reference File dialog box to enable you to change the file you’re 
importing as an Xref.
Attachment    Tells AutoCAD to include other Xref attachments that are nested in the 
selected file.
Overlay    Tells AutoCAD to ignore other Xref attachments that are nested in the selected file. 
This avoids multiple attachments of other files and eliminates the possibility of circular refer-
ences (referencing the current file into itself through another file).

262  | CHAPTER 7  Mastering Viewing Tools, Hatches, and External References   
Path Type    Offers options for locating Xrefs. Xref files can be located anywhere on your 
system, including network servers. For this reason, you can easily lose links to Xrefs either 
by moving them or by rearranging file locations. To help you manage Xrefs, the Path Type 
option offers three options: Full Path, Relative Path, and No Path.
Full Path    Retains the current full path.
Relative Path    Maintains paths in relation to the current drawing. The current drawing 
must be saved before using the Relative Path option.
No Path    Used for drawings in which Xrefs are located in the same folder as the cur-
rent drawing or in the path specified in Support File Search Path in the Files tab of the 
Options dialog box (choose Options from the Application menu).
Specify On-Screen    Appears in three places. It gives you the option to enter an insertion 
point, scale factors, and rotation angles in the dialog box or in the Command window, in a 
way similar to inserting blocks. If you clear this option for any of the corresponding param-
eters, the parameters change to allow input. If they’re selected, you’re prompted for those 
parameters after you click OK to close the dialog box. With all three Specify On-Screen 
check boxes cleared, the Xref is inserted in the drawing using the settings indicated in the 
dialog box.
Show Details/Hide Details    Displays or hides the path information for the selected Xref 
file.
Block Unit    Displays the insert scale setting for the external reference. Values are shown as 
the unit type and scale factor.
Clipping Xref Views and Improving Performance
Xrefs are frequently used to import large drawings for reference or backgrounds. Multiple 
Xrefs, such as a floor plan, column grid layout, and site-plan drawing, might be combined 
into one file. One drawback to multiple Xrefs in earlier versions of AutoCAD was that the 
entire Xref was loaded into memory even if only a small portion of it was used for the final 
plotted output. For computers with limited resources, multiple Xrefs could slow the system 
to a crawl.
AutoCAD offers two tools that help make display and memory use more efficient when using 
Xrefs: the Clip command and the Demand Load option in the Options dialog box.
Clipping Views
The Clip command, found in the Insert tab’s Reference panel, lets you clip the display of 
an Xref or a block to any shape you want, as shown in Figure 7.21. For example, you might 
want to display only an L-shaped portion of a floor plan to be part of your current drawing. 
Clip lets you define such a view. To access the command, choose Clip from the Insert tab’s 
Reference panel.
You can clip blocks and multiple Xrefs as well. You can also specify a front and back clipping 
distance so that the visibility of objects in 3D space can be controlled. You can define a clip area 
by using polylines or spline curves, although curve-fitted polylines revert to de-curved poly-
lines. (See Chapter 18 for more on polylines and spline curves.)

Controlling Xref Settings in the Options Dialog Box
The External References (Xrefs) group in the Open And Save tab of the Options dialog box offers 
some tools to help you manage memory use and other features related to Xrefs. If you’re working on 
large projects with others in a workgroup, you should be aware of these settings and what they do.

264  | CHAPTER 7  Mastering Viewing Tools, Hatches, and External References   
External References in the San Francisco Main Library Project
Although the exercises in this chapter demonstrate how Xrefs work, you aren’t limited to using 
them in the way shown here. Perhaps one of the most common ways of using Xrefs is to combine 
a single floor plan with different title block drawings, each with its own layer settings and title 
block information. In this way, single-drawing files can be reused in several drawing sheets of a 
final construction document set. This helps keep data consistent across drawings and reduces the 
number of overall files needed.
This is exactly how Xrefs were used in the San Francisco Main Library drawings. One floor plan 
file contained most of the main information for that floor. The floor plan was then used as an Xref 
in another file that contained the title block as well as additional information such as furnishings 
or floor finish reference symbols. Layer visibility was controlled in each title block drawing so that 
only the data related to that drawing appeared.
Multiple Xref files were also used by segregating the structural column grid layout drawings from 
the floor plan files. In other cases, portions of plans from different floors were combined into a 
single drawing by using Xrefs, as shown here:
The Demand Load Xrefs drop-down list offers three settings: Disabled, Enabled, and Enabled 
With Copy. Demand Load is set to Enabled With Copy by default in the standard AutoCAD 
setup. In addition to reducing the amount of memory an Xref consumes, Demand Load prevents 
other users from editing the Xref while it’s being viewed as part of your current drawing. This 
helps aid drawing version control and drawing management. The Enabled With Copy option 

Editing Xrefs in Place |  265  
creates a copy of the source Xref file and then uses the copy, thereby enabling other AutoCAD 
users to edit the source Xref file.
Demand loading improves performance by loading only the parts of the referenced drawing 
that are needed to regenerate the current drawing. You can set the location for the Xref copy in 
the Files tab of the Options dialog box under Temporary External Reference File Location.
Two other options are also available in the Options dialog box:
Retain Changes To Xref Layers    Instructs AutoCAD to remember any layer color or visibil-
ity settings of Xrefs from one editing session to the next. In the standard AutoCAD settings, 
this option is on by default.
Allow Other Users To Refedit Current Drawing    Lets others edit the current drawing by 
choosing Edit Reference from the Insert tab’s expanded Reference panel (Refedit). You’ll learn 
about this command in the next section.
Editing Xrefs in Place
You’ve seen different methods for editing blocks and Xrefs as external files. There is also a way 
to edit a block or an Xref directly in a file without having to edit an external file: You can use the 
Edit Reference option in the Insert tab’s expanded Reference panel or the Edit Reference In-Place 
option in the External Reference tab’s Edit panel. These options issue the Refedit command.
The following exercise demonstrates how Refedit works. If you are a metric user, note that for 
this exercise we’re using a file set up with Imperial units. The unit type is not important to the 
exercise:
	
1.	 Open the 07-planxref.dwg file. This file is set up like the Planxref.dwg file you created 
in the previous exercises. 07-planxref uses a file called 07-unitxref.dwg instead of the 
unitxref.dwg file for the Xref units.
	
2.	 Zoom into the unit plan in the lower-left corner of the drawing so that you see a view 
similar to Figure 7.22.
Figure 7.22
The enlarged view of 
the unitxref in the 
Planxref drawing

266  | CHAPTER 7  Mastering Viewing Tools, Hatches, and External References   
	
3.	 Click the hatch pattern of the corner unit to select the unit. Notice that the External 
Reference Ribbon tab appears, offering several options that allow you to edit the Xref. 
You’ll learn more about these options later.
	
4.	 Double-click the hatch pattern corner unit. You can also right-click and select Edit Xref 
In-place. The Reference Edit dialog box appears (see Figure 7.23).
Figure 7.23
The Reference Edit 
dialog box
The Reference Edit dialog box contains two main areas. The right side shows a thumbnail 
view of the items that you’re editing. The left side shows a list of the specific items you 
selected in the Xref. Notice that the list box shows the hierarchical relationship of the 
kitchenette block in relation to the 07-unitxref Xref.
	
5.	 In the list, click the 07-unitxref|KITCHEN listing and then click OK. The Edit Refer­
ence panel appears in the current Ribbon tab. You may see a previous release warning 
message. Click OK at the warning.
	
6.	 Use a selection window to select the entire lower-left corner unit. Notice that only the 
grips in the kitchenette appear, indicating that the objects in the kitchenette are selected. 
Although the rest of the unit appears to be selected, it appears lighter in color. This shows 
you that only the kitchen is available for editing.
	
7.	 Press the Esc key to clear your selection.
In step 5 of the previous exercise, the Refedit command isolates the objects that you select for 
editing. You can’t edit anything else in the Xref until you exit the Refedit command and start 
over.
At this point, you can edit a block in an Xref. Now let’s continue editing the kitchenette:
	
1.	 Zoom in on the kitchenette, and move the four burners to the right 8″.
	
2.	 Erase the sink.

Editing Xrefs in Place |  267  
	
3.	 Click the Save Changes tool on the Edit Reference panel. If your screen resolution is fairly 
low, you may have to expand the Edit Reference panel to see the Save Changes tool.
Special Save As Options That Affect Demand Loading
AutoCAD offers a few additional settings that boost the performance of the Demand Load feature. 
When you choose Save As from the Application menu to save a file in the standard DWG format, you 
see the Tools button in the upper-right corner of the Save Drawing As dialog box. Choosing Tools 
➢ Options opens the Save As Options dialog box. Using the options in the Index Type drop-down 
list on the DWG Options tab can help improve the speed of demand loading. The index options 
are as follows:
None    No index is created.
Layer    AutoCAD loads only layers that are both turned on and thawed.
Spatial    AutoCAD loads only portions of an Xref or raster image within a clipped boundary.
Layer & Spatial    This option turns on both the Layer and Spatial options.
	
4.	 A warning message appears, telling you that the changes you’ve made to the Xref will be 
saved. Click OK.
	
5.	 Zoom back to your previous view. Notice that the other units reflect the changes you 
made to the 07-unitxref Xref (see Figure 7.24).
Figure 7.24
The Xrefs after being 
edited
	
6.	 Open the 07-unitxref.dwg file, which can be found in the Chapter 7 sample file folder. 
The kitchen reflects the changes that you made to the Xref of the unit in the 07-planxref 
file. This shows you that by choosing to save the reference edit in step 3, you saved the 
changes back to the Xref’s source file.

268  | CHAPTER 7  Mastering Viewing Tools, Hatches, and External References   
As you saw from these two exercises, it’s possible to edit a specific block in an Xref, but to do 
that you must select the block name in the Reference Edit dialog box.
In these exercises, you edited a block contained in an Xref, but you could have just as eas-
ily edited a block in the current drawing. You can also edit nested blocks by using the Refedit 
command. Changes in blocks in the current file don’t affect other files because blocks aren’t 
linked to external files. The changes to blocks remain in the current file until you explicitly 
export the changed block to a file, as you saw in earlier exercises.
Using the External Reference Tab
Earlier, you saw that when you click an Xref, the External Reference tab appears. This tab offers 
several tools divided into three panels: Edit, Clipping, and Options. See Table 7.2 for a complete 
description of these tools.
Table 7.2:	
The External Reference tab options
Tool name
Function
Edit Reference In-Place
Starts the Refedit command, which allows you to edit an Xref within the 
current drawing.
Open Reference
Opens the selected Xref.
Create Clipping Boundary
Starts the Xclip command, which allows you to hide portions of an Xref. 
This feature is similar to the image clipping command described in 
Chapter 13, “Copying Existing Drawings from Other Sources.”
Remove Clipping
Removes a clipping boundary.
External References
Opens or closes the External References palette.
Adding and Removing Objects from Blocks and Xrefs
In the previous exercises, you removed objects from the Kitchen block by using the Erase com-
mand. You can also move objects from a block or an Xref into the current drawing without eras-
ing them. To do this, choose Remove From Working Set from the Edit Reference panel while in 
the Refedit command. This removes the objects from the block or Xref without erasing them. 
Likewise, you can add new objects to the block or Xref by choosing Add To Working Set from 
the Edit Reference panel. Both menu options invoke the Refset command, with different options 
applied. Also note that the Edit Reference panel appears in all of the Ribbon tabs when you are 
in the Refedit command.
To see how Refset works, try the following exercise:
	
1.	 Close the 07-unitxref.dwg file.
	
2.	 In the 07-planxref file, zoom in to the kitchenette to get a view similar to the top panel 
of Figure 7.25.

Editing Xrefs in Place |  269  
	
3.	 Double-click the unit plan drawing. You can also choose Edit Reference from the Insert 
tab’s expanded Reference panel and then click the unit plan.

block and adding the 
rectangle

Add rectangle.
Burners removed from working set
remain in their moved position.
Rectangle appears in all 
copies of the Unit XRef.
	
4.	 Click the 07-unitxref|KITCHEN listing in the Reference Edit dialog box, and then click 
OK.
	
5.	 Use the Move tool to move the two burners on the right just to the right of the kitchenette, 
as shown in Figure 7.25.
	
6.	 Click the Remove From Working Set tool in the expanded Edit Reference panel.
	
7.	 Select the two burners you just moved, and then press ↵.
Notice that the burners become grayer to show that they’re removed from the working set. 
They remain as part of the Planxref drawing, but they’re no longer part of the Kitchen block.
Now add a rectangle to the Kitchen block in place of the burners:
	
1.	 Draw a 7″ by 16″ rectangle in place of the moved burners, as shown in the top panel of 
Figure 7.26. Anything you add to the drawing automatically becomes part of the working set.

270  | CHAPTER 7  Mastering Viewing Tools, Hatches, and External References   
	
2.	 Click Save Changes in the Edit Reference panel. You’ll see a warning message stating that 
all reference edits will be saved. Click OK.
	
3.	 Zoom out enough to see the other units in the drawing (see Figure 7.26).
Figure 7.26
The Planxref drawing 
with the changes made 
to the 07-unitxref 
Xref
You can see that the burners have been replaced by the rectangle in all of the other Xref units. 
The burners you moved are still there in the lower-left corner unit, but they have been removed 
from all of the Xrefs. It’s as if you extracted them from the block and placed them in the Plan 
drawing.
While you were using the Refedit command, any new objects that you created were added to 
the working set automatically. When you drew the rectangle in step 1, for example, it was auto-
matically included in the working set, which is the set of objects included in the block or Xref on 
which you’re currently working. You didn’t have to add it specifically to the working set.
If you want to include existing objects in the working set, choose the Add To Working Set 
tool from the Edit Reference panel.
You’ve completed the exercises in this chapter, so you can exit AutoCAD without saving 
these changes.
Understanding the Reference Edit Dialog Box Options
The Reference Edit dialog box offers you the option to isolate specific blocks in the Xref by 
selecting them from the hierarchy list. You may have noticed the two radio button options: 
Automatically Select All Nested Objects and Prompt To Select Nested Objects. The default 
option, Automatically Select All Nested Objects, lets you select any object contained in the 
selected object in the hierarchy listing. If you select the Prompt To Select Nested Objects option, 
you’re prompted to select objects on the screen before the Edit Reference panel appears.
In addition to the options you used in the exercises, the Reference Edit dialog box includes 
the Settings tab, which provides a few options (see Figure 7.27).

Editing Xrefs in Place |  271  
Create Unique Layer, Style, and Block Names
When you use the Refedit command with the Automatically Select All Nested Objects option 
turned on, you can import nested blocks into the current drawing. For example, if you selected 
the Bath block in the hierarchy list in the previous exercise, you would have access to the Tub and 
Toilet blocks in the Bath block. You could then copy either of those blocks into the current file.
When you make a copy of a block from an Xref, AutoCAD needs to assign that block a name. 
The Create Unique Layer, Style, And Block Names option tells AutoCAD to use the original 
block name and append a $#$ prefix to the name (# is a numeric value starting with 0). If you 
were to import the Bath block, for example, it would become $0$bath in the current drawing. 
This ensures that the block maintains a unique name when it’s imported, even if there is a block 
with the same name in the current drawing. If you turn off the Create Unique Layer, Style, And 
Block Names option, the original name is maintained. If the current drawing contains a block of 
the same name, the imported block uses the current file’s definition of that block.
Display Attribute Definitions for Editing
If your drawing contains attributes (see Chapter 12, “Using Attributes,” for more on attributes), 
this option is offered. If you turn on this option, you can then edit attribute definitions by using 
the Refedit command. If you select a block that contains an attribute definition while you’re 
using the Refedit command, the attribute definition is exposed, enabling you to make changes. 
Changes to attribute definitions affect only new attribute insertions. Except for the attribute of 
the edited block, existing attributes aren’t affected. If you want to update existing attributes to 
a newly edited definition, use the Sync option of the Block Attribute Manager (choose Manage 
Attributes from the Home tab’s expanded Block panel).
Lock Objects Not in Working Set
In the Refedit exercises, you saw that objects that aren’t selected in the Reference Edit dialog box 
are grayed out and aren’t selectable. The Lock Objects Not In Working Set option controls this 
feature and is turned on by default.

The Bottom Line
Assemble the parts.    Technical drawings are often made up of repetitive parts that are 
drawn over and over. AutoCAD makes quick work of repetitive elements in a drawing, as 
shown in the first part of this chapter.
Master It    What is the object used as the basic building block for the floor plan drawing 
in the beginning of this chapter?
Take control of the AutoCAD display.    Understanding the way the AutoCAD display 
works can save you time, especially in a complex drawing.
Master It    Name the dialog box used to save views in AutoCAD. Describe how to recall 
a saved view.
Use hatch patterns in your drawings.    Patterns can convey a lot of information at a glance. 
You can show the material of an object or you can indicate a type of view, like a cross section, 
by applying hatch patterns.
Master It    How do you open the Hatch And Gradient dialog box?
Understand the boundary hatch options.    The hatch options give you control over the way 
that hatch patterns fill an enclosed area.
Master It    Describe an island as it relates to boundary hatch patterns.
Use external references.    External references are drawing files that you’ve attached to the 
current drawing to include as part of the drawing. Because external references aren’t part of 
the current file, they can be worked on at the same time as the referencing file.
Master It    Describe how drawing files are attached as external references.

Chapter  8
Introducing Printing, Plotting,  
and Layouts
Getting hard-copy output from the AutoCAD® 2017 software is something of an art. You’ll need 
to be intimately familiar with both your output device and the settings available in AutoCAD. 
You’ll probably spend a good deal of time experimenting with the plotter settings in AutoCAD 
and with your printer or plotter to get your equipment set up just the way you want.
With the huge array of output options available, this chapter can provide only a general 
discussion of plotting and printing. As a rule, the process for using a plotter isn’t much differ-
ent from that for a printer; you just have more media-sized options with plotters. Still, every 
output device is different. It’s up to you to work out the details and fine-tune the way you and 
AutoCAD together work with your particular plotter or printer.
This chapter describes the features available in AutoCAD and discusses some general rules 
and guidelines to follow when setting up your plots. We’ll start with an overview of the plotting 
features in AutoCAD and then delve into the finer details of setting up your drawing and con-
trolling your plotter or printer.
In this chapter, you will learn to

Plotting the Plan
To see firsthand how the Plot command works, you’ll plot the plan drawing by using the default 
settings on your system. You’ll start by getting a preview of your plot before you commit to 
printing your drawing. As an introduction, you’ll plot from the model view of an AutoCAD 
drawing, but be aware that typically you should plot from a layout view. Layout views give you 
a greater degree of control over how your output will look. You’ll be introduced to layout views 
later in this chapter. Now let’s get started!
First, try plotting your drawing to no particular scale:
	
1.	 Be sure that your printer or plotter is connected to your computer and is turned on.
	
2.	 Start AutoCAD, and open the plan.dwg file; open plan-metric.dwg if you are using the 
metric system. These files can be found in the Chapter 8 sample files.

3.	 Select Zoom All from the Zoom flyout in the navigation bar to display the entire drawing, 
or type Z↵A↵.
	
4.	 Click the Plot tool from the Quick Access toolbar. You may see a message asking if you 
want to use the Batch Plot feature. Select Continue to plot a single sheet to open the Plot 
dialog box (see Figure 8.1). If your dialog box looks like it has more information than 
what is shown in Figure 8.1, don’t worry—you’ll learn about the expanded portion of the 
dialog box in the next exercise.

5.	 If the Name option in the Printer/Plotter group shows None, click the drop-down arrow 
and select your current Windows system printer.
	
6.	 In the Plot Area group, select the Display option from the What To Plot drop-down list (see 
Figure 8.2). This tells AutoCAD to plot the drawing as it appears in the drawing window. 
You also have the option to plot the limits of the drawing or to select an area to plot with a 
window. In addition, you can choose to plot the extents of a drawing or a saved view.
Figure 8.2
Choose the Display 
option.

Plotting the Plan |  275  
	
7.	 Select the Fit To Paper option in the Plot Scale group.
	
8.	 Click the Preview button in the lower-left corner of the dialog box. AutoCAD works 
for a moment and then displays a sample view of how your drawing will appear when 
printed. Notice that the view also shows the Zoom Realtime cursor. You can use the 
Zoom/Pan Realtime tools to get a close-up of your print preview.
	
9.	 Go ahead and plot the file: Right-click and choose Plot from the context menu. AutoCAD 
sends the drawing to your printer.
	
10.	 Your plotter or printer prints the plan to no particular scale.
You’ve just plotted your first drawing to see how it looks on paper. You used the minimal 
settings to ensure that the complete drawing appears on the paper.
You may notice that a message bubble appears in the lower-right corner of the AutoCAD 
window (see Figure 8.3). If you click the text that reads “Click to view plot and publish 
details,” the Plot And Publish Details dialog box opens to display some detailed information 
about your plot.
Figure 8.3
Click the message  
text to open the Plot 
And Publish Details 
dialog box.
As you become more experienced with AutoCAD and your projects become more 
demanding, the information presented in the Plot And Publish Details dialog box may be 
useful to you. For now, make a mental note that this information is available should you 
need it.

276  | CHAPTER 8  Introducing Printing, Plotting, and Layouts   
Next, try plotting your drawing to an exact scale. This time, you’ll expand the Plot dialog box 
to show a few more options:
	
1.	 In the status bar, click the Annotation Scale tool and select 1⁄16″ = 1′-0″ from the flyout. 
Metric users should select 1:20.
	
2.	 Click Plot on the Quick Access toolbar again to open the Plot dialog box. If the Name 
option in the Printer/Plotter group shows None, click the drop-down arrow and select 
your current Windows system printer.
	
3.	 Click the More Options button. You’ll see some additional options appear on the right 
side of the dialog box (see Figure 8.4).
Set the Appropriate Units
It’s important to make sure that you use the appropriate unit settings in this chapter. For example, 
if you’ve been using the metric measurements for previous exercises, make sure that you use the 
metric settings in the exercises of this chapter; otherwise, your results won’t coincide.
Figure 8.4
Open the additional 
options on the right.
New options appear
to the right.
	
4.	 If your last printout wasn’t oriented correctly on the paper, select the Landscape option in 
the Drawing Orientation group.

Understanding the Plotter Settings |  277  
	
5.	 In the Plot Scale group, clear the Fit To Paper check box. Then select 1⁄16″ = 1′-0″ from the 
Scale drop-down list. Metric users should select 1:20. As you can see, you have several 
choices for the scale of your output.
	
6.	 In the Paper Size group, select Letter. Metric users should select A4. The options in this 
drop-down list depend on your Windows system printer or the output device you config-
ured for AutoCAD.
	
7.	 In the Plot Area group, select Limits from the drop-down list. This tells AutoCAD to use 
the limits of your drawing to determine which part of your drawing to plot.
	
8.	 Click the Preview button again to get a preview of your plot.
	
9.	 Right-click and choose Plot from the context menu. This time, your plot is to scale.
Here, you were asked to specify a few more settings in the Plot dialog box. Several settings 
work together to produce a drawing that is to scale and that fits properly on your paper. Here is 
where it pays to understand the relationship between your drawing scale and your paper’s size, 
discussed in Chapter 3, “Setting Up and Using the Drafting Tools.” You also saw how you could 
expand the options in the Plot dialog box.
The following sections are lengthy and don’t contain many exercises. If you prefer to continue 
with the exercises in this chapter, skip to the section “Plotting Using Layout Views.” Be sure to 
come back and read the following sections while the previous exercises are still fresh in your mind.
Understanding the Plotter Settings
In the following sections, you’ll explore all of the settings in the Plot dialog box. These settings 
give you control over the size and orientation of your image on the paper. They also let you 
control which part of your drawing gets printed. All of these settings work together to give 
you control over how your drawing fits on your printed output.
Print Preview Dependencies
The appearance of the print preview depends on the type of output device that you chose when 
you installed AutoCAD or when you last selected a Plotter Device option (described in the section 
“Plotting Using Layout Views” later in this chapter). The print preview is also affected by other set-
tings in the Plot dialog box, such as those in the Drawing Orientation, Plot Offset, and Plot Area 
groups. This example shows a typical preview view using the Windows default system printer in 
Landscape mode.
AutoCAD Remembers Plotter Settings
AutoCAD 2017 relies mainly on the Windows system printer configuration instead of its own plot-
ter drivers. However, it does remember printer settings that are specific to AutoCAD, so you don’t 
have to adjust your printer settings each time you use AutoCAD. This gives you more flexibility 
and control over your output. Be aware that you’ll need to understand the Windows system printer 
settings in addition to those offered by AutoCAD.

278  | CHAPTER 8  Introducing Printing, Plotting, and Layouts   
Paper Size
You use the options in the Paper Size group to specify the paper size for your output. You can 
select a paper size from the Paper Size drop-down list. These sizes are derived from those avail-
able from your selected system printer. You’ll find out how to select a different printer later in 
this chapter.
AutoCAD 2017 offers sheet sizes in both Imperial and metric measurements in the Paper 
Size group. AutoCAD assumes that if you pick a metric sheet size such as A4 or A5, you’ll want 
the sheet dimensions specified in metric measurements, so it adjusts the dialog box settings 
accordingly.
Drawing Orientation
When you used the Preview button in the first exercise in this chapter, you saw your drawing 
as it would be placed on the paper. In that example, it was positioned in a landscape orientation, 
which places the image on the paper so that the width of the paper is greater than its height. 
You can rotate the image on the paper 90° into what is called a portrait orientation by selecting 
the Portrait radio button in the Drawing Orientation group. A third option, Plot Upside-Down, 
lets you change the orientation further by turning the landscape or portrait orientation upside 
down. These three settings allow you to print the image in any one of four orientations on the 
sheet.
In AutoCAD, the preview displays the paper in the orientation it’s in when it leaves the 
printer. For most small-format printers, if you’re printing in the portrait orientation, the image 
appears in the same orientation that you see when you’re editing the drawing. If you’re using 
the landscape orientation, the preview image is turned sideways. For large-format plotters, the 
preview may be oriented in the opposite direction. The graphic in the Drawing Orientation 
group displays a capital A on a sheet showing the orientation of your drawing on the paper 
output.
Remember that you need to click the More Options button in the lower-right corner of the 
Plot dialog box to access the Drawing Orientation group. The More Options button looks like a 
circle with a greater-than sign. You can also press Alt+Shift+>.
Plot Area
The What To Plot drop-down list in the Plot Area group lets you specify which part of your 
drawing you want to plot. You may notice some similarities between these settings and the Zoom 
command options. The Plot Area options are described next. Most of these options are used only 
in a model view. Typically, when plotting from a layout view, you’ll use the Layout option.

Understanding the Plotter Settings |  279  
Display    Display is the default option; it tells AutoCAD to plot what is currently dis-
played on the screen. If you let AutoCAD fit the drawing onto the sheet (that is, you 
select the Fit To Paper check box in the Plot Scale group), the plot is exactly the same 
as what you see on your screen, adjusted for the width and height proportions of your 
display.
Extents    The Extents option uses the extents of the drawing to determine the area to 
print. If you let AutoCAD fit the drawing onto the sheet (by selecting the Fit To Paper 
check box in the Plot Scale group), the plot displays exactly the same image that you 
would see on the screen if you chose the Zoom Extents tool from the Zoom flyout in the 
Navigation bar.
Layout    The Layout option (available in layout views only) replaces the Limits option when 
you plot from a layout view. (See the section “Plotting Using Layout Views” later in this chap-
ter.) This option plots everything displayed within the paper margins shown in the layout 
view. Typically, this is the only option you’ll use when printing from a layout.
Limits    The Limits option (available in model space only) uses the limits of the drawing to 
determine the area to print. If you let AutoCAD fit the drawing onto the sheet (by selecting 
the Fit To Paper check box in the Plot Scale group), the plot displays exactly the same image 
that you would see on the screen if you selected Zoom All from the Zoom flyout on the 
Navigation bar.
Getting a Blank Plot?
Do you get a blank printout even though you selected Extents or Display? Chances are that the 
Fit To Paper check box isn’t selected or the Inches = Units (mm = Units for metric users) setting is 
inappropriate for the sheet size and scale of your drawing. If you don’t care about the scale of the 
drawing, make sure that the Fit To Paper option is selected. Otherwise, make sure that the Plot 
Scale settings are set correctly. If you select Display for the plot area, try Extents instead. The next 
section, “Plot Scale,” describes how to set the scale for your plots.
View    The View option is available when you’ve saved a view in the drawing by using the 
View command. When you select View from the What To Plot drop-down list, another drop-
down list appears offering a list of views available in the drawing. You can then select the 
view that you want to plot. If you let AutoCAD fit the drawing onto the sheet (by selecting Fit 
To Paper from the Plot Scale group), the plot displays exactly the same thing that you would 
see on the screen if you recalled the view that you’re plotting. Objects that don’t appear in the 
view are clipped in the plotted view.
Window    The Window option enables you to use a window to indicate the area that you 
want to plot. Nothing outside the window prints. When you select this option, the Plot dialog 
box temporarily closes to allow you to select a window. After you’ve done this the first time, 
a Window button appears next to the drop-down list. You can click the Window button and 
then indicate a window in the drawing area, or AutoCAD will use the last indicated window. 
If you use the Fit To Paper option in the Plot Scale group to let AutoCAD fit the drawing onto 
the sheet, the plot displays exactly what you enclose in the window.

280  | CHAPTER 8  Introducing Printing, Plotting, and Layouts   
Plot Scale
In the previous section, you could select Fit To Paper for several of the Plot Area options. Bear in 
mind that when you apply a scale factor to your plot instead, the results of the Plot Area settings 
change and some problems can arise. This is where most new users have difficulty.
For example, the apartment plan drawing fits nicely on the paper when you use Fit To Paper. But 
if you try to plot the drawing at a scale of 1″ = 1′, you’ll probably get a blank piece of paper because, 
at that scale, hardly any of the drawing fits on your paper. AutoCAD will tell you that it’s plotting 
and then tell you that the plot is finished. You won’t have a clue as to why your sheet is blank.
If an image is too large to fit on a sheet of paper because of improper scaling, the plot image is 
placed on the paper differently, depending on whether the plotter uses the center of the image or 
the lower-left corner for its origin. Keep this in mind as you specify scale factors in this area of 
the dialog box.
Scale
You can select a drawing scale from a set of predefined scales in the Scale drop-down list. These 
options cover the most common scales you’ll need to use.
You’ve already seen how the Fit To Paper option lets you avoid giving a scale and forces the 
drawing to fit on the sheet when you’re plotting from the model view. This works fine if you’re 
plotting illustrations that aren’t to scale. If you select another option, such as 1⁄8″= 1′-0″, the 
inches and units text boxes change to reflect this scale. The Inches = text box changes to 0.125, 
and the Units text box changes to 12.
If you’re plotting from a layout, you’ll use the 1:1 scale option or perhaps a 1:2 scale if you’re 
plotting a half-size drawing. In a layout, the drawing scale is typically set up through the view-
port. While you’re plotting from a layout, AutoCAD automatically determines the area to plot 
based on the printer and sheet size you select. For more information, see “Plotting Using Layout 
Views” later in this chapter.
Custom Scale
In some cases, you may need to set up a nonstandard scale (not shown in the drop-down list) 
to plot your drawing. If you can’t find the scale you want in the Scale drop-down list, you can 
select Custom and then enter custom values in the Inches or mm and Units text boxes.
Through these text boxes, you can indicate how the drawing units in your drawing relate 
to the final plotted distance in inches or millimeters. For example, if your drawing is of a scale 
factor of 96, you would follow these steps:
	
1.	 In the Plot Scale group of the Plot dialog box, double-click the text box just below the 
Scale drop-down list, and enter 1.

Understanding the Plotter Settings |  281  
	
2.	 Double-click the Units text box, enter 96, and press the Tab key. Metric users who 
want to plot to a scale of 110 should enter 1 in the mm text box and 10 in the Units 
text box.
If you’re more used to the Architectural unit style in the Imperial measurement system, you 
can enter a scale as a fraction. For example, for a 1⁄8″ scale drawing, do this:
	
1.	 Double-click the Inches = text box, enter 1/8, and press the Tab key. The value in the text 
box changes to 0.125, which is the decimal equivalent of 1⁄8″.
	
2.	 Double-click the Units text box, enter 12, and press the Tab key.
If you specify a different scale than the one you chose while setting up your drawing, 
AutoCAD plots your drawing to that scale. You aren’t restricted in any way as to scale, but 
entering the correct scale is important: If it’s too large, AutoCAD will think your drawing is too 
large to fit on the sheet, although it will attempt to plot your drawing anyway. See Chapter 3 for 
a discussion of unit styles and scale factors.
Don’t Forget Your Annotation Scale
You may see a message saying that the “annotation scale is not equal to the plot scale” when you 
attempt to plot your drawing. You can click Continue at the message and your drawing will still be 
plotted to the scale you specify. If you are using any text or blocks that use the annotation scale 
feature, those items will be plotted at the Annotation scale setting for the model view or layout 
that you are trying to plot. See Chapter 4, “Organizing Objects with Blocks and Groups,” for more 
on the annotation scale.
If you plot to a scale that is different from the scale you originally intended, objects and text 
appear smaller or larger than is appropriate for your plot. You’ll need to edit your text size to 
match the new scale. You can do so by using the Properties palette. Select the text whose height 
you want to change, right-click and choose Properties from the context menu, and then change 
the Height setting in the Properties palette.
Adding a Custom Scale to the Scale Drop-Down List
If you use a custom scale frequently, you may find it annoying to have to input the scale every 
time you plot. AutoCAD offers the ability to add your custom scale to the Scale drop-down list 
shown earlier. You can then easily select your custom scale from the list instead of entering it 
through the text box.
Here are the steps you use to add a custom scale to the Scale drop-down list:
	
1.	 Choose Options from the Application menu to open the Options dialog box.
	
2.	 Select the User Preferences tab, and then click the Default Scale List button at the bottom 
of the dialog box.
Certiﬁcation
Objective

282  | CHAPTER 8  Introducing Printing, Plotting, and Layouts   
	
3.	 In the Default Scale List dialog box, click the Add button.
	
4.	 In the Add Scale dialog box, enter a name for your custom scale in the Name Appearing 
In Scale List text box, and then enter the appropriate values in the Scale Properties text 
boxes.
	
5.	 Click OK in each dialog box to close it.
There are several options besides Add in the Default Scale List dialog box. Clicking the Edit 
button lets you edit an existing scale in the list. Clicking the Move Up and Move Down but-
tons lets you change the location of an item in the list. Clicking Delete deletes an item or a set 
of items from the list. Clicking the Reset button restores the list to its default condition and 
removes any custom items that you may have added.
Scale Lineweights
AutoCAD offers the option to assign lineweights to objects either through their layer assign-
ments or by directly assigning a lineweight to individual objects. The lineweight option, how-
ever, doesn’t have any meaning until you specify a scale for your drawing. After you specify a 
scale, the Scale Lineweights option becomes available. Select this check box if you want the line-
weight assigned to layers and objects to appear correctly in your plots. You’ll get a closer look at 
lineweights and plotting later in this chapter.

Understanding the Plotter Settings |  283  
Shaded Viewport Options
Most of your plotting will probably involve 2D technical line drawings, but occasionally you 
may need to plot a shaded or rendered 3D view. You may need to include such 3D views com-
bined with 2D or 3D Wireframe views. AutoCAD offers the Shaded Viewport Options group, 
which enables you to plot shaded or rendered 3D views of your AutoCAD drawing. These 
options give you control over the quality of your rendered output. (Users of the AutoCAD LT® 
software don’t have the Shaded Viewport Options group.)
Remember that you need to click the More Options button in the lower-right corner of the 
Plot dialog box to get to the Shaded Viewport Options group. You also need be in a model space 
view before these options are made available.
Shade Plot
The Shade Plot and Quality drop-down lists let you control how a Model Space view or layout is 
plotted. You can choose from the following options:
As Displayed    Plots the Model Space view as it appears on your screen.
Legacy Wireframe    Plots the Model Space view of a 3D object as a Wireframe view.
Legacy Hidden    Plots your Model Space view with hidden lines removed.
3D Hidden/3D Wireframe/Conceptual/Hidden/Realistic. . .    Plots the Model Space using 
one of several visual styles. These selections override the current Model Space visual style. 
See Chapter 20, “Creating 3D Drawings,” for more on visual styles.
Rendered    Renders your Model Space view before plotting (see Bonus Chapter 6, 
“Rendering 3D Drawings,” available at www.omura.com/chapters).
Low/Medium/High    Sets the quality of the plot.
The Shade Plot options aren’t available if you’re plotting from a layout view. You can control 
the way each layout viewport is plotted through the viewport’s Properties settings. You’ll learn 
more about layout viewport properties later in this chapter.
Quality and DPI
The Quality drop-down list determines the dots per inch (dpi) setting for your output. These 
options aren’t available if you select Legacy Wireframe or Legacy Hidden from the Shade Plot 
drop-down list:
Draft    Plots 3D views as wireframes.
Preview    Offers 150 dpi resolution.
Normal    Offers 300 dpi resolution.
Presentation    Offers 600 dpi resolution.
Maximum    Defers dpi resolution to the current output device’s settings.
Custom    Lets you set a custom dpi setting. When you select Custom, the DPI text box is 
made available for your input.
If some of the terms discussed for the Shaded Viewport Options group are unfamiliar, don’t 
be alarmed. You’ll learn about 3D shaded views in Part 4 of this book. When you start to explore 
3D modeling in AutoCAD, come back and review the Shaded Viewport Options group.

284  | CHAPTER 8  Introducing Printing, Plotting, and Layouts   
Plot Offset
Sometimes, your first plot of a drawing shows the drawing positioned incorrectly on the paper. 
You can fine-tune its location by using the Plot Offset settings. To adjust the position of your 
drawing on the paper, enter the location of the view origin in relation to the plotter origin in 
x- and y-coordinates (see Figure 8.5).
Figure 8.5
Adjusting the image 
location on a sheet

1,3 is entered at

For example, suppose that you plot a drawing and then realize that it needs to be moved 
1″ to the right and 3″ up on the sheet. You can replot the drawing by making the following 
changes:
	
1.	 Double-click the X text box, type 1, and press the Tab key.
	
2.	 Double-click the Y text box, type 3, and press the Tab key.
Now proceed with the rest of the plot configuration. With these settings, the image is shifted 
on the paper exactly 1″ to the right and 3″ up when the plot is done.
The Center The Plot option does just what it says: It centers the plot on the sheet. This option 
is not available when you’re plotting a layout.
You can also tell AutoCAD the location from which the offset is to occur. The Plot And 
Publish tab of the Options dialog box (choose Application ➢ Options) offers the Specify Plot 
Offset Relative To button group. This group offers two radio buttons: Printable Area and Edge 
Of Paper. You can select the option that makes the most sense for you.

Understanding the Plotter Settings |  285  
Plot Options
The options in the Plot Options group provide you with greater control over your output and 
require some detailed instruction. Here is a brief description of these options.
Plot In Background    If you think your plot will take some time to complete, this option 
plots your drawing in the background so that, after you begin a plot, you can immediately 
return to your drawing work. You can also control this option through the Backgroundplot 
system variable.
Plot Object Lineweights    As mentioned earlier, AutoCAD lets you assign lineweights 
to objects either through their layer assignment or by assigning them directly. If you 
use this feature in your drawing, this option lets you turn lineweights on or off in your 
output.
Plot With Transparency    You can apply a transparency of objects and layers in your 
drawing. This option lets you control whether transparency is used when your drawing is 
plotted.
Plot With Plot Styles    Plot styles give you a high degree of control over your drawing 
output. You can control whether your output is in color or black and white, and you can 
control whether filled areas are drawn in a solid color or a pattern. You can even control the 
way lines are joined at corners. You can learn more about these options and how they affect 
your work in Bonus Chapter 5, “Understanding Plot Styles,” available at www.omura.com/
chapters.
Plot Paperspace Last    When you’re using a layout view, otherwise known as Paper Space, 
this option determines whether objects in paper space are plotted before or after objects in 
model space.
Hide Paperspace Objects    This option pertains to 3D models in AutoCAD. When you 
draw in 3D, you can view your drawing as a Wireframe view. In a Wireframe view, your 
drawing looks like it’s transparent even though it’s made up of solid surfaces. Using 
hidden-line removal, you can view and plot your 3D drawings so that solid surfaces are 
opaque. To view a 3D drawing in the drawing area with hidden lines removed, use the 
Hide command or use one of the visual styles other than Wireframe. To plot a 3D drawing 
with hidden lines removed, choose the Hidden option or a visual style from the Shade Plot 
drop-down list.
Hide Paperspace Objects doesn’t work for views in the Layout viewport described later. 
Instead, you need to set the viewport’s Shade Plot setting to Hidden. (Click the viewport bor-
der, right-click, and choose Shade Plot ➢ Hidden from the context menu.)
Plot Stamp On    The Plot Stamp feature lets you place pertinent data on the drawing in a 
location you choose. This includes the drawing name, date and time, scale, and other data. 
When you click the Plot Stamp On check box to turn on this option, the Plot Stamp Settings 
button appears.
Click this button to gain access to the Plot Stamp dialog box (see Figure 8.6). This dialog 
box offers many controls over the plot stamp. It is a fairly extensive tool, so rather than us 
filling this chapter with a description of all of its features, see Bonus Chapter 3, “Hardware 
and Software Tips,” available at www.omura.com/chapters for a complete rundown of the 
Plot Stamp options.

286  | CHAPTER 8  Introducing Printing, Plotting, and Layouts   
Save Changes To Layout    When this option is turned on, the changes you make to Plot 
dialog box settings are saved with the current layout. You’ll learn more about layouts in the 
section “Plotting Using Layout Views.”
Exit Options
The Plot dialog box has the usual OK, Cancel, and Help buttons at the bottom. You’ll also see the 
Apply To Layout button. This button lets you save the plot settings that you make without send-
ing your drawing to the printer or plotter for output. It is convenient for those times when you 
decide halfway through your plot setup not to plot your drawing.
Plotting Using Layout Views
So far, you’ve done all of your work in the model view, also known as model space. There are 
other views to your drawing that are specifically geared toward printing and plotting. The lay-
out views enable you to control drawing scale, add title blocks, and set up layer settings different 
from those in the model view. You can think of the layout views as page layout spaces that act 
like a desktop publishing program.
This part of the chapter introduces you to layout views as they relate to plotting. You’ll also 
learn more about layout views in Chapter 15, “Laying Out Your Printer Output.”
You can have as many layout views as you like, each set up for a different type of output. You 
can, for example, have two or three layout views, each set up for a different scale drawing or with 
different layer configurations for reflected ceiling plans, floor plans, or equipment plans. You can 
even set up multiple views of your drawing at different scales in a single layout view. In addition, 
you can draw and add text and dimensions in layout views just as you would in model space.
To get familiar with the layout views, try the following exercise:
	
1.	 Hover over the Plan file’s Drawing tab at the top of the drawing area (see Figure 8.7), and 
then click the Layout1 preview panel.

Plotting Using Layout Views |  287  
Options in the Preview Panel
When you hover over a Drawing tab, you see two printer icons along the top of the preview images. 
The icon in the upper-left corner lets you plot the layout. The icon in the upper-right corner lets 
you start the Publish feature. See Chapter 25, “Managing and Sharing Your Drawings,” for more 
on the Publish feature.
Figure 8.7
Choose the Layout1 
panel.
A view of your drawing appears on a gray background, as shown in Figure 8.8. This is a view 
of your drawing as it will appear when plotted on your current default printer or plotter. The 
white area represents the printer or plotter paper.

2.	 Try zooming in and out using the Zoom Realtime tool or the scroll wheel of your mouse. 
Notice that the entire image zooms in and out, including the area representing the paper.
Layout views give you full control over the appearance of your drawing printouts. You can 
print a layout view just as you did the view in model space. Note that the ViewCube® is absent 
since layout views are strictly 2D. However, you can double-click inside a layout viewport and 
use the ViewCube to select a 3D view.
Let’s take a moment to look at the elements in the Layout1 view. As mentioned previously, 
the white area represents the paper on which your drawing will be printed. The dashed line 
immediately inside the edge of the white area represents the limits of your plotter’s margins. 
Finally, the solid rectangle that surrounds your drawing is the outline of the viewport border. 
A viewport is an AutoCAD object that works like a window into your drawing from the layout 
view. Also notice the triangular symbol in the lower-left corner of the view; this is the UCS icon 
for the layout view. It tells you that you’re currently in layout view space. You’ll see the signifi-
cance of this icon in the following exercise:
	
1.	 Try using a selection window to select the lobby area of your drawing. Nothing is 
selected.
	
2.	 Click the viewport border, which is the rectangle surrounding the drawing, as shown in 
Figure 8.8. This is the viewport into model space. Notice that you can select it.
	
3.	 Open the Properties palette by clicking the Properties arrow icon in the title bar of the 
Home tab’s Properties panel. You can see from the Properties palette that the viewport is 
just like any other AutoCAD object with layer, linetype, and color assignments. You can 
even hide the viewport outline by turning off its layer.
	
4.	 Close the Properties palette.
	
5.	 With the viewport still selected, click the Erase tool in the Modify toolbar. The view of 
your drawing disappears when you erase the viewport. Remember that the viewport is 
like a window into the drawing that you created in the model view. After the viewport is 
erased, the drawing view goes with it.
	
6.	 Type U↵ or click the Undo button in the Quick Access toolbar to restore the viewport.
Creating New Viewports
You can create new viewports using the Vports command (the Rectangular/Polygon/From Object 
tool in the Layout tab’s Layout Viewports panel). See the section “Creating New Paper Space 
Viewports” in Chapter 15 for more information.
	
7.	 Double-click anywhere within the viewport’s boundary. Notice that the UCS icon that 
you’re used to seeing appears in the lower-left corner of the viewport. The Layout 
UCS icon disappears. The Navigation bar and ViewCube also appear inside the 
viewport.

Plotting Using Layout Views |  289  
	
8.	 Click the lobby in your drawing. You can now select parts of your drawing.
	
9.	 Try zooming and panning your view. Changes in your view take place only within the 
boundary of the viewport.
	
10.	 Click Zoom All from the Zoom flyout in the Navigation bar or type Z↵A↵ to display the 
entire drawing in the viewport.
	
11.	 To return to paper space, double-click an area outside the viewport. You can also type 
PS↵ to return to paper space or MS↵ to access the space within the viewport.
This exercise shows you the unique characteristics of layout views. The objects in the view-
port are inaccessible until you double-click the interior of the viewport. You can then move 
about and edit your drawing in the viewport, just as you would while in the model view.
Layout views can contain as many viewports as you like, and each viewport can hold a dif-
ferent view of your drawing. You can size and arrange each viewport any way you like, or you 
can create multiple viewports, giving you the freedom to lay out your drawing as you would a 
page in a page layout program. You can also draw in the layout view or import Xrefs and blocks 
for title blocks and borders.
Setting Plot Scale in the Layout Viewports
In the first part of this chapter, you plotted your drawing from the model view. You learned that 
to get the plot to fit on your paper, you had to either use the Fit To Paper option in the Plot dialog 
box or indicate a specific drawing scale, plot area, and drawing orientation.
The layout view works in a different way: It’s designed to enable you to plot your draw-
ing at a 1-to-1 scale. Instead of specifying the drawing scale in the Plot dialog box, as you did 
when you plotted from the model view, you let the size of your view in the layout view view-
port determine the drawing scale. You can set the viewport view to an exact scale by making 
changes to the properties of the viewport.
To set the scale of a viewport in a layout view, try the following exercise:
	
1.	 Press the Esc key to clear any selections. Then click the viewport border to select it. You’ll 
see the Viewport Scale tool appear in the status bar.
	
2.	 Click the Viewport Scale tool, and a list of common drawing scales appears (see 
Figure 8.9).
	
3.	 Select 1⁄16″ = 1′ (metric users should select 1:20). The view in the drawing window 
changes to reflect the new scale for the viewport. Now most of the drawing fits into 
the viewport, and it’s to scale. The scale of 1⁄16″ = 1′ is similar to the metric 1:200 
scale, but because you used centimeters instead of millimeters as the base unit for the 
metric version of the plan drawing, you drop the second 0 in 200. The metric scale 
becomes 1:20.

290  | CHAPTER 8  Introducing Printing, Plotting, and Layouts   
	
4.	 Use the viewport grips to enlarge the viewport enough to display all of the drawing, as 
shown in Figure 8.10. As you move a corner grip, notice that the viewport maintains a 
rectangular shape.
Figure 8.9
Choose a viewport 
scale.
Figure 8.10

5.	 Click Plot from the Quick Access toolbar, and in the Plot dialog box, make sure that the Scale 
option is set to 1:1 and your system printer is selected in the Printer/Plotter group; then click 
OK. Your drawing is plotted as it appears in the Layout tab, and it’s plotted to scale.
In step 2, you used the Viewport Scale tool in the status bar to select a scale for a viewport. 
If you look just below the Standard Scale option, you see the Custom Scale option. Both options 
work like their counterparts, the options in the Plot Scale group in the Plot dialog box.

Adding an Output Device |  291  
Layout views and viewports work in conjunction with your plotter settings to give you a better 
idea of how your plots will look. There are numerous plotter settings that can dramatically change 
the appearance of your layout view and your plots. Next, you’ll learn how some of the plotter settings 
can enhance the appearance of your drawings. You’ll also learn how layout views can display those 
settings, letting you see on your computer screen exactly what will appear on your paper output.
Adding an Output Device
We mentioned earlier that you can set up AutoCAD for more than one output device. You can 
do this even if you have only one printer or plotter connected to your computer. You might want 
multiple printer configurations in AutoCAD for many reasons. You might want to set up your 
system so that you can print to a remote location over a network or the Internet. Some printer 
configurations are strictly file oriented, such as the AutoCAD DWF format for Internet web 
pages or raster file output. (See Chapter 25 for more on DWF files.)
AutoCAD works best with printers and plotters configured as Windows system devices. 
Although you can add devices through the AutoCAD Plot Manager, Autodesk recommends 
that you set up your plotters and printers as Windows devices and then use the System Printer 
option in AutoCAD to select your output device. (In Windows 7, choose Start ➢ Devices And 
Printers, and then select Add A Printer from the menu bar to configure a new printer.) You can 
use the Add-A-Plotter Wizard in AutoCAD to create predefined settings for your system printer 
so that you can quickly choose a printer or plotter setup.
You can also configure additional printers through the AutoCAD Plot Manager; this method 
also uses the Add-A-Plotter Wizard. Here’s how it’s done:
	
1.	 Click the Plotter Manager tool on the Output tab’s Plot panel to open the Plotters window 
(see Figure 8.11). Your view of the Plotters window may look a little different, depending 
on your operating system, but the same basic information is there.
Figure 8.11
The Plotters 
window
You can also open this window by clicking the Add Or Configure Plotters button in the Plot 
And Publish tab of the Options dialog box. It’s just an File Explorer window showing you 
the contents of the Plotters folder that is buried in the Users folder for your Windows 10, 

292  | CHAPTER 8  Introducing Printing, Plotting, and Layouts   
Windows 8, or Windows 7 user profile (C:\Users\User Name\AppData\Roaming\
Autodesk\AutoCAD 2017\R21.0\enu\Plotters, where User Name is your login name).
	
2.	 Double-click the Add-A-Plotter Wizard icon to open the Add Plotter dialog box. You see 
the Introduction screen, which describes the purpose of the wizard.
	
3.	 Click Next. The next screen lets you select the type of setup you want. You’re offered three 
options: My Computer, Network Plotter Server, and System Printer. The first two options 
offer plotter options based on drivers specific to AutoCAD. They offer the same set of 
options, except the Network Plotter Server option asks you for a network server name. The 
System Printer option uses the existing Windows system printer as the basis for the setup.
	
4.	 Click the My Computer radio button and click Next, and you will see a listing of plotter 
models that are supported by AutoCAD directly through its own drivers. If you use a 
PostScript device or if you want to convert drawings to raster formats, this is the place 
to select those options. You can select the plotter or printer manufacturer name from the 
Manufacturers list on the left and then select a specific model from the list on the right. 
If you have a driver for a specific plotter or printer that isn’t listed, you can click the Have 
Disk button to browse to your driver location.
	
5.	 After you’ve made a printer or plotter selection, click Next. You’re then asked if you want 
to use an existing PCP or PC2 configuration file for the selected plotter. PCP and PC2 
configuration files are plotter configuration files from earlier releases of AutoCAD.
	
6.	 Unless you plan to use one of those files, click Next on the Import PCP Or PC2 screen. 
If you selected My Computer in step 3, the Ports screen opens (see Figure 8.12). With the 
Plot To A Port option selected, you can use the list to select a port to which your printer or 
plotter is connected. The Configure Port button lets you set up the port if you have a spe-
cific requirement for it. If you intend to plot to a file instead of to a port, you can select the 
Plot To File radio button at the top as an alternative. An AutoSpool option is also offered 
if your printer requires this feature.

of the Add-A-
Plotter Wizard

Adding an Output Device |  293  
If you selected an option in step 4 that doesn’t require a port setup, click the Next button 
to skip this option; the Plotter Name screen opens.
	
7.	 Enter a name for this configuration in the space provided, and then click Next to open the 
Finish screen. You can enter a descriptive name in the Plotter Name text box. This name 
will appear in the Printer Name drop-down list of the Plot Or Page Setup dialog box.
	
8.	 From this screen you can make adjustments to the configuration you’ve just created by 
clicking the Edit Plotter Configuration button. Click Finish to exit the Add-A-Plotter 
Wizard. Your new configuration appears in the Plotters window.
The Edit Plotter Configuration button lets you fine-tune your plotter settings. For example, 
you can calibrate your plotter for more accurate scaling of your plots, or if you’re creating a ras-
ter file output configuration, you can create a custom page setting for extremely high-resolution 
raster images.
After you’ve set up a plotter, the plotter information is stored as a file with the .pc3 filename 
extension in the Plotters folder described earlier.
Editing a Plotter Configuration
In step 8 of the previous exercise, you exited the Add-A-Plotter Wizard without editing 
the newly created plotter configuration. You can always go back and edit the configuration 
by opening the Plotters window (choose Plotter Manager on the Output tab’s Plot panel) 
and double-clicking the configuration that you want to edit. You can recognize a plotter 
configuration file by its .pc3 filename extension.
Most users use their Windows system printer or plotter for other applications besides 
AutoCAD, and frequently the AutoCAD settings for that printer are different from the settings 
used for other applications. You can set up AutoCAD to use its own settings automatically 
so that you don’t have to reconfigure your Windows system printer every time you switch 
applications. To do so, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Page Setup Manager tool on the Output tab’s Plot panel to open the Page Setup 
Manager dialog box. You can also right-click a layout or model tab and choose Page Setup

Controlling the Appearance of the Layout Views
The Options dialog box offers a set of controls dedicated to the layout views. If you don’t like some 
of the graphics in the layout views, you can turn them off. Open the Options dialog box, and click 
the Display tab to see a set of options in the Layout Elements group in the lower-left side of the 
dialog box.
As you can see, you can control the display of the tabs themselves, the margins, the paper back-
ground, and the paper shadow. In addition, you can specify whether AutoCAD automatically cre-
ates a viewport or opens the Page Setup dialog box when you open a layout view for the first time.

Click Custom Properties.
	
7.	 Adjust these settings the way that you want them when you plot from AutoCAD and 
then click OK.

Storing a Page Setup |  295  
	
8.	 Back in the Plotter Configuration Editor dialog box, click the Save As button. A standard 
Save As dialog box appears.
	
9.	 Enter the name of the plot configuration that you’ve set up or accept the default name 
(which is usually the name of the Windows printer or plotter), and click Save.
	
10.	 Click OK in the Plotter Configuration Editor dialog box; then click OK in the Page Setup 
dialog box and close the Page Setup Manager.
The Plotter Configuration Editor offers a wide variety of options that are fairly technical in 
nature. If you want to know more about the Plotter Configuration Editor, see Bonus Chapter 3, 
available at www.omura.com/chapters.
Storing a Page Setup
Unlike most other programs, AutoCAD offers hundreds of page setup options. It can be quite a chore 
to keep track of and maintain all these options. But as you settle into using AutoCAD, you’ll proba-
bly find that you’ll set up a few plotter configurations and stick to them. AutoCAD 2017 lets you save 
a page setup under a name to help you store and manage the settings that you use most often.
You’ve already seen the Page Setup Manager dialog box on your way to preparing a page for 
printing. In this section, you’ll take a closer look at this useful tool.
Follow these steps to create a page setup:
	
1.	 In AutoCAD, click the Page Setup Manager tool in the Output tab’s Plot panel. The Page 
Setup Manager dialog box opens (see Figure 8.14). So far, you’ve used only the Modify option 
in this dialog box to modify an existing page setup. Now you’ll try creating a new setup.

Figure 8.15
Naming a new page setup
	
3.	 To create a new page setup, first enter a name in the New Page Setup Name text box and 
then select a setup from the Start With list box. AutoCAD will use the setup that you 
select as the basis for the new setup. Notice that AutoCAD offers the name Setup1 as a 
default name for a new setup.
	
4.	 Click OK when you’re finished. AutoCAD opens the Page Setup dialog box, where you 
can choose the settings for your new page setup.
	
5.	 Click OK to return to the Page Setup Manager and then close it. Your new page setup is 
listed in the Current Page Setup list box. From here, you can select a page setup from the list 
box and then click the Set Current button to make it the current page setup for the layout.
You can also import other user-defined page setups by clicking the Import button. Because 
page setups are stored in the drawing, the Import button opens a standard file dialog box that 
displays drawing files. You can then select a file from which you want to import a page setup.
The current page setup applies to the current Layout tab, but after you create a new page 
setup, it’s offered as an option in the Page Setup Manager dialog box for all of the other Layout 
tabs in this file. You can also select a page setup directly from the Plot dialog box by using the 
Name drop-down list in the Page Setup group.

Storing a Page Setup |  297  
Page setups can be used with the Publish feature described in Chapter 25 to set up batch 
plots or in the Sheet Set feature described in Bonus Chapter 7, “Keeping a Project Organized 
with Sheet Sets,” available at www.omura.com/chapters. You can also create an entirely new 
page setup on the fly while in the Plot dialog box. To do this, click the Plot tool in the Quick 
Access toolbar and then click the Add button in the Page Setup group of the Plot dialog box. 
This opens a simple dialog box where you can enter a name for your new setup. After you enter 
a new name and click OK, you can proceed to choose your page settings. Then click OK or 
Apply To Layout, and the setup will be saved under the new name.
Understanding the Plot And Publish Tab in the Options Dialog Box 
We mentioned the Plot And Publish tab in the Options dialog box earlier in this chapter. This tab 
contains several options related to plotting that can be useful. Here’s a summary of those options 
and their purposes.
Default Plot Settings For New Drawings
The options in this group let you control the default plot settings for new drawings and for draw-
ings from earlier versions of AutoCAD that are opened for the first time in AutoCAD 2017. The 
Use As Default Output Device radio button and drop-down list let you select the default plotter 
or printer to be used with new drawings. When the Use Last Successful Plot Settings radio button 
is selected, the last successful plotter settings for subsequent plots are used. This is how earlier 
continues

298  | CHAPTER 8  Introducing Printing, Plotting, and Layouts   
continued
versions of AutoCAD worked. The Add Or Configure Plotters button opens the Plotters window. This 
is the same as choosing the Plot Manager tool from the Output tab’s Plot panel. From the Plotters 
window, you can launch the Add-A-Plotter Wizard to add new plotter configurations. You can also 
edit existing plotter configurations.
General Plot Options
These options control some of the general plotter parameters. The Keep The Layout Paper Size If 
Possible radio button causes AutoCAD to attempt to plot to the paper size specified in the Plot dialog 
box, regardless of the paper size in the plotter. If the specified size is larger than the capacity of the 
plotter, a warning message is displayed. The Use The Plot Device Paper Size option causes AutoCAD 
to use the paper size specified by the system printer or the PC3 plot configuration file currently in 
use. Both settings are also controlled by the Paperupdate system variable.
The System Printer Spool Alert drop-down list offers control over printer-spooling alert messages. 
The OLE Plot Quality drop-down list lets you control the quality of OLE objects embedded in or 
linked to a drawing. This setting can also be controlled through the Olequality system variable.
When the Use OLE Application When Plotting OLE Objects check box is selected, AutoCAD launches 
any application that is associated with an OLE object embedded or linked to the AutoCAD drawing 
that is currently being plotted. This helps improve the plot quality of Object Linking and Embedding 
(OLE) objects. You can also set this option through the Olestartup system variable. See Chapter 
19, “Getting and Exchanging Data from Drawings,” for more information about OLE.
The Hide System Printers option affects the Printer/Plotter group’s Name drop-down list in the 
Plot and Page Setup dialog boxes. With this option turned on, you see only printers that have a 
.pc3 filename extension associated with them. These include printers that have been set up using 
the Add-A-Plotter Wizard discussed earlier in this chapter.
Plot To File
You have the option to plot to a file that can be downloaded to your printer or plotter at a later date. 
The Plot To File group lets you specify the default destination for the plot files.
Plot And Publish Log File
You can maintain a plot log file that records information about each plot you make. This can be 
helpful when you must keep records of hard-copy output for billing purposes. You can specify the 
location of the plot and publishing log file in the Files tab of the Options dialog box under the Plot 
And Publishing Log File Location listing. The log file has a .csv filename extension.
Background Processing Options
AutoCAD performs background plots so that after you begin a plot, you can immediately return to 
your drawing work instead of waiting for the plot to be completed. The options in this group let you 
turn on this feature either for standard plotting or for the Publish feature discussed in Chapter 25. 
You can also control this option through the Backgroundplot system variable.
Plot Stamp Settings
This button opens the Plot Stamp dialog box, which you saw in the section “Plot Options” earlier in 
this chapter. The Plot Stamp dialog box lets you determine what information is displayed in a plot 
stamp, which is a label placed on the print of a drawing to provide information about the source file.

Using Electronic Plots |  299  
Using Electronic Plots
The focus of this chapter has been printer or plotter hard-copy output. But a major part of your 
work will involve the transmission of electronic versions of your documents. More than ever, 
architects and engineers are using the Internet to exchange documents of all types, so AutoCAD 
offers several tools to make the process easier.
We’ve mentioned that you can control some of your output settings through the Plot And 
Publish tab of the Options dialog box. The Publish feature includes items that enable you to 
“print” your drawings as a file that can be emailed to clients and consultants or posted on an 
FTP site or website. The Publish feature lets you create a single file that contains multiple pages 
so that you can combine several drawing sheets into one file.
The Publish feature also enables you to plot several drawings at once without having to load 
and print each one individually. This can be helpful when you’ve finished a set of drawings 
and want to plot them during a break or overnight. Chapter 25 gives you a detailed look at the 
Publish feature.
Exporting to PDF Through the Plot Dialog Box
More than ever, designers and engineers rely on the PDF file format to transfer and view techni-
cal drawings. AutoCAD supports the PDF format in a number of ways.
When you select a printer from the Page Setup or Plot dialog box, you have the option to 
select from four types of PDF printers: General Documentation, High Quality Print, Smallest 
File, and Web And Mobile. These options appear in the Printer/Plotter Name drop-down list, as 
shown in Figure 8.16.
Plot Style Table Settings
When you click this button, the Plot Style Table Settings dialog box opens. This dialog box controls 
the type of plot styles used in AutoCAD. In the case of named plot styles, you can also select a default 
plot style for layer 0 and a default plot style for objects. Note that the Use Color Dependent Plot Styles 
and Use Named Plot Styles radio buttons don’t have an effect on the current drawing; they affect only 
new drawings and pre–AutoCAD 2000 drawings being opened for the first time in AutoCAD 2017. 
The Default Plot Style Table drop-down list lets you select a default plot style table for new and pre–
AutoCAD 2000 drawings. These settings are also controlled by the Pstylepolicy system variable.
The Add Or Edit Plot Style Tables button in the Plot Style Table Settings dialog box opens the Plot 
Styles dialog box. From there, you can double-click an existing plot style table file or start the Add-
A-Plot Style Table Wizard to create a new plot style.
Specify Plot Offset Relative To
Here you can determine whether the plot offset is set in relation to the printable area of your printer 
or to the edge of the paper. The printable area is determined by the printer margin.
Auto Publish
You can set up AutoCAD to publish your file to a DWF, DWFx, or PDF file automatically when you 
save or close a drawing. Place a check mark in the Automatic Publish check box to enable this fea-
ture. The Automatic Publish Settings button gives you control over the location of the published 
files as well as the file format, password protection, and other file features. Note that this feature 
will increase the time it takes to save or close a file.

Figure 8.16
The PDF options in the 
Printer/Plotter Name 
drop-down list
The High Quality Print, Smallest File, and Web And Mobile options are self-explanatory and 
offer predefined settings for these three types of PDF files. The General Documentation option 
is similar to the High Quality Print option, but with a slightly lower image resolution. When you 
select one of these PDF options, a PDF Options button appears, which you can click to open the 
PDF Options dialog box shown in Figure 8.17. This dialog box enables you to make changes to PDF 
output. For example, you can adjust the vector and raster quality or change the type of data that 
you want to include in the PDF file.

Exporting to PDF Through the Export To DWF/PDF Ribbon Panel
PDF output is also offered in the Export To DWF/PDF panel of the Output tab (see Figure 8.18). 
This panel offers a quick alternative to the Plotter dialog box when you want to produce a PDF 
of your drawing.
Figure 8.18
The Export To DWF/
PDF panel
If you click the Export flyout on the panel and choose PDF, the Save As PDF dialog box 
opens. This dialog box enables you to select the location for your files, choose one of the four 
PDF presets mentioned earlier, or make custom changes to a selected preset. The Save As PDF 
dialog box also offers some of the same options found in the Plot dialog box, such as the Output 
Controls, including the plot stamp feature and a page setup override (see Figure 8.19).
Figure 8.19
Save As PDF dialog box
The Options button opens the PDF Options dialog box shown in Figure 8.17. The Export: 
Current Layout drop-down list lets you select which layout to convert to PDF. The Page Setup: 
Override drop-down list lets you select between the current setup or a custom setup using the 
Page Setup Override dialog box shown in Figure 8.20.

302  | CHAPTER 8  Introducing Printing, Plotting, and Layouts   
Exporting Autodesk DWF and DWFx Files
The Output Ribbon tab also offers tools to export DWF and DWFx files. The Autodesk DWF 
file formats allow you to exchange drawing data with others. They offer features that are more 
focused toward AutoCAD users. You can import DWF and DWFx files as external references, 
and using a free DWF viewer, you can gather information about a drawing such as block infor-
mation, attribute data, and distance measurements.
The process to create DWF files is similar to the process for creating PDFs, with some differ-
ences in the options available for the output file. See Chapter 25 for more on DWF.
The Page Setup Override dialog box lets you change the paper size, plot scale, drawing orien-
tation, and plot style.
Figure 8.20
Page Setup Override 
dialog box
Plotting Image Files and Converting 3D to 2D
If your work involves producing manuals, reports, or similar documents, you may want to add the 
Raster File Export option to your list of plotter configurations. The Raster File Export option lets 
you plot your drawings to a wide range of raster file formats, including CALS, JPEG, PCX, Targa, 
Tiff, and BMP. You can then import your drawings into documents that accept bitmap images. 
Images can be up to 8,000×8,000 pixels (set through the Plotter Configuration Editor) and can 
contain as many colors as the file format allows. If you need several raster formats, you can use 
multiple instances of this or any plotter configuration.
To convert your 3D wireframe models into 2D line drawings, use the Flatshot tool described in 
Chapter 20. You can then include your 2D line drawings with other 2D drawings for plotting and 
printing.
The Bottom Line
Understand the plotter settings.    Unlike other types of documents, AutoCAD drawings can 
end up on nearly any size sheet of paper. To accommodate the range of paper sizes, the AutoCAD 
plotter settings are fairly extensive and give you a high level of control over your output.

The Bottom Line |  303  
Master It    Name  at least two of the settings available in the Plot scale panel of the Plot 
dialog box.
Use layout views to control how your plots look.    The Layout tabs in AutoCAD offer a way 
to let you set up how a drawing will be plotted. You can think of the layout views as paste-up 
areas for your drawings.
Master It    Name some of the items that you see in a layout view.
Add an output device.    Typically, AutoCAD will use the Windows system printer as an 
output device, but often you will find that the printer you use is a dedicated plotter that is not 
connected to Windows in the usual way. AutoCAD lets you add custom plotters and printers 
through the Add-A-Plotter Wizard.
Master It    How do you start the Add-A-Plotter Wizard?
Store a page setup.    Most of the time, you will use the same plotter settings for your draw-
ings. You can save plotter settings using the Page Setup feature.
Master It    Describe a way to create a page setup. Describe how to retrieve a setup.


Chapter  9
Adding Text to Drawings 
One of the most tedious drafting tasks is applying notes to your drawing. The AutoCAD® 2017 
software makes this job faster by enabling you to type your notes, insert text from other sources, 
and copy notes that repeat throughout a drawing. It also helps you to create professional-looking 
notes using a variety of fonts, type sizes, and type styles.
In this chapter, you’ll add notes to your apartment building plan. In the process, you’ll 
explore some of the AutoCAD text-creation and text-editing features. You’ll learn how to con-
trol the size, slant, type style, and orientation of text and how to import text files. You’ll start 
by working through some exercises that show you the process of preparing a drawing for text. 
You’ll then add a few lines of text to the drawing and learn how text size and drawing scale 
interrelate. The rest of the chapter shows you the tools available for formatting text to fit your 
application.
In this chapter, you will learn to

Preparing a Drawing for Text
In these first sections, you’ll go through the process of adding text to a drawing that currently 
has none. By doing so, you’ll gain firsthand experience in using all the tools that you’ll need for 
adding text to a drawing. Start by setting up a drawing to prepare it for the addition of text:
	
1.	 Start AutoCAD and open the Unit file. If you haven’t created this file, you can use the file 
called 9a-unit.dwg (metric users should use 9a-unit-metric.dwg), which you’ll find among 
this chapter’s files at the book’s web page, www.sybex.com/go/masteringautocad2017. After 
the file is open, choose Save As from the Application menu to save the Unit drawing to a file 
called Unit.dwg.
	
2.	 Create a layer called Notes, and make it the current layer. Notes is the layer on which 
you’ll keep all your text information.
Certiﬁcation
Objective

306  | CHAPTER 9  Adding Text to Drawings   
	
3.	 If the FLR-PAT layer is on, turn it off. Otherwise, the floor pattern you added previously 
will obscure the text you enter during the exercises in this chapter.
	
4.	 Set up your view so that it looks similar to the top image in Figure 9.1.

Organize Text with Layers
It’s a good idea to keep your notes on a separate layer so that you can plot drawings containing 
only the graphics information.
Organizing Text by Styles
Before you begin to add text to your drawing, you should set up a text style or two. You can 
think of text styles as a tool to store your most common text formatting. Styles store text height 
and font information, so you don’t have to set these options every time you enter text. Generally, 
you’ll need only a few text styles.
Even if you started to add text without creating your own text style, you would still be 
using a text style. That’s because every text object must have a style, so AutoCAD includes the 
Standard text style in every new drawing. The Standard style uses an AutoCAD font called Txt, 
and it includes numerous other settings that you’ll learn about in this section. These other set-
tings include width factor, oblique angle, and default height.
Certiﬁcation
Objective

Preparing a Drawing for Text |  307  
In this next exercise, you’ll create a text style called Note1, which you’ll use to add notes to 
the unit plan on which you’ve been working:
	
1.	 Click the Text Style drop-down list from the Home tab’s expanded Annotation panel and 
select Manage Text Styles, or type St↵. This opens the Text Style dialog box (see Figure 9.2).
Set Up Default Fonts in Templates
If you don’t like the way the AutoCAD default style is set up, open the acad.dwt template file and 
change the Standard text style settings to your liking. You can also add other styles that you use 
frequently. Remember, AutoCAD files with the .dwt filename extension in their name are just 
AutoCAD DWG files with a slightly different extension to set them apart as templates.

2.	 Click the New button to the right in the dialog box to open the New Text Style dialog box.
	
3.	 Enter Note1 for the name of your new style, and then click OK.
	
4.	 In the Text Style dialog box again, click the Font Name drop-down list in the Font group 
and select a font for your style.
	
5.	 Locate the Courier New TrueType font and select it. A quick way to locate the font is to 
click in the list and start typing the font name.
	
6.	 Select the Annotative option in the Size group (see Figure 9.3).

7.	 In the Paper Text Height box, enter 0.1. You’ll see your input change to 1⁄8″ if you are 
using the architectural unit style. Metric users should enter 0.15.
	
8.	 Close the dialog box.
The Annotative option you turned on in step 6 is an important feature for keeping your text 
at the proper size for your drawing scale. You’ll see how it works in the exercises later in the 
section “Setting the Annotation Scale and Adding Text.”
Making a Style the Default
Once you’ve created a style, you can make it the default current style by selecting it from the Text 
Style drop-down list in the Annotate tab’s Text panel.
Getting Familiar with the Text and Annotation Scale Control Panels
Before you go much further into the AutoCAD text features, take a moment to familiarize your-
self with the Annotate tab’s Text and Annotation Scaling panels (see Figure 9.4). You’ll be using 
a few of these panel tools in this chapter. If you need to, you can refer to this figure as you work 
through the exercises.

Setting the Annotation Scale and Adding Text
You’ve got a text style set up and ready to use. Now you’ll add some text to your unit plan. 
Before you begin, you should determine a drawing scale. This is important because with the 

Setting the Annotation Scale and Adding Text |  309  
Annotative feature turned on, AutoCAD needs to know the drawing scale in order to set the 
size of the text. Follow these steps:
	
1.	 In the right side of the status bar, click the drop-down arrow next to Annotation Scale.
	
2.	 Select 1/4″ = 1′-0″. Metric users, select 1:100.
You’ve just set the drawing scale for the Model Space view. This isn’t a permanent setting; 
you can change it at any time, as you’ll see later. The settings you used for the annotation scale 
are somewhat arbitrary for the purposes of demonstrating the Annotative Scale feature.
Inserting Text
Finally, you can begin to add text. To start, you’ll add some text to label the entrance to the 
floor plan. The process is similar to the process in other graphics programs that offer a text 
feature. You draw a boundary in the area where you want the text to appear, and then you 
start typing:
	
1.	 Turn off the Object Snap tool in the status bar.
	
2.	 Click the Multiline Text tool in the Annotate tab’s Text panel. You can also type MT↵. You 
see a prompt that tells you the current text style and height:
Current text style: "Note1" Text height: 4 13/16"
Annotative: Yes
Specify first corner:
	
3.	 Click the first point indicated in the top image in Figure 9.1 to start the text boundary 
window. This boundary window indicates the area in which you’ll place the text. Notice 
the arrow near the bottom of the window; it indicates the direction of the text flow. You 
don’t have to be too precise about where you select the points for the boundary because 
you can adjust the location and size later.
	
4.	 At the Specify opposite corner or [Height/Justify/Line spacing/Rotation/
Style/Width/Columns]: prompt, click the second point indicated in the top image in 
Figure 9.1. The Text Editor tab appears with the text editor superimposed over the area 
you just selected (see Figure 9.5).
	
5.	 Click the text editor and type Entry. As you type, the word appears in the text editor just 
as it will appear in your drawing.
	
6.	 Press ↵ to advance one line; then enter 6′ by 7′.
	
7.	 Press ↵ to advance another line, and enter [182 cm by 213 cm].
	
8.	 Press ↵ again to advance another line, and enter carpet floor.

310  | CHAPTER 9  Adding Text to Drawings   
	
9.	 Click Close Text Editor on the Close panel. The text appears in the drawing just as it did 
in the text editor. (See the bottom image in Figure 9.1.)
After you’ve added text, if the text doesn’t quite fit in the area you’ve indicated, you can make 
adjustments to the text boundary. Click the text to expose the text boundary, including the 
boundary grips. Then click and drag the grips to resize the boundary. The word-wrap feature 
automatically adjusts the text formatting to fit the text boundary.
You may have noticed that the Text Editor tab and text editor work like any text editor; if you make 
a typing error, you can highlight the error and retype the letter or word. You can perform other word 
processing functions too, such as using search and replace, importing text, and changing fonts.
You also saw that the text editor shows how your text will appear in the location you selected 
using the text boundary. If your view of the drawing is such that the text is too small to be leg-
ible, the text editor enlarges the text so that you can read it clearly. Likewise, if you’re zoomed in 
too closely to see the entire text, the text editor adjusts the text to enable you to see all of it.
Figure 9.5
The text editor floats 
over the selected area.
Making Text Readable over Hatch Patterns
If text is included in a selection where a hatch pattern is to be placed, AutoCAD automatically avoids 
hatching over the text. If you add text over a hatched area, you can use the Background Mask tool 
in the Text Editor tab to make the text more readable. Another option is to use the Select Boundary 
Objects tool in the Hatch Edit tab to add text to a hatch selection.
Exploring Text and Scale
Even though your text height is 0.1′, or 0.15 cm, it appears at the appropriately enlarged size for 
the current scale. If the text were drawn to the size of 0.1′, it would be very small and barely 
­visible. However, the Annotative Scale feature makes the adjustment to your text size based on 
the Annotation Scale setting.

Setting the Annotation Scale and Adding Text |  311  
You can see how the Annotation Scale setting affects your text:
	
1.	 First, make sure the Show Annotation Objects tool is turned on in the status bar, or type 
Annoallvisible↵1↵.
	
2.	 Click the Annotation Scale setting, and select 1/2″ = 1″-0″. Metric users should select 1:50.
	
3.	 Click the Add/Delete Scales tool in the Annotate tab’s Annotation Scaling panel, or enter 
Objectscale↵.
	
4.	 At the Select annotative objects: prompt, select the text and press ↵. You see the 
Annotation Object Scale dialog box (see Figure 9.6) listing the annotation scales that you 
have used for this drawing.
Figure 9.6
The Annotation Object 
Scale dialog box
	
5.	 You can add additional scales to your text object. Click the Add button, which opens the 
Add Scales To Object dialog box (see Figure 9.7).
Figure 9.7
The Add Scales To 
Object dialog box

312  | CHAPTER 9  Adding Text to Drawings   
	
6.	 Select 1/2″ = 1′-0″ from the list (metric users should select 1:50) and click OK, and then 
click OK again in the Annotation Object Scale dialog box. The new text changes to the 
appropriate size for the selected scale.
Now test your settings by changing the Annotation Scale value back to the previous setting:
	
1.	 In the status bar, click the Annotation Scale setting and select 1/4″ = 1′-0″. Metric users 
should select 1:100.
	
2.	 The text changes back to its original size.
In steps 2 through 4 of the first exercise in this section, you added a new annotation scale to 
the text. This is necessary for the text to be aware of the new annotation scale that you want to 
use. Each time you include a new scale for your drawing, you need to add an annotation scale to 
the text in your drawing.
If you prefer, you can turn on the Automatically Add Scales To Annotative Objects tool 
in the status bar, which does just what its name says. The keyboard command for this tool is 
Annoautoscale↵ 4↵. Once a scale is added, you can quickly change between scales by selecting 
a scale from the Annotation Scale list.
So far, you’ve used only a single multiline text object. However, if you have many notes dis-
tributed throughout a drawing, you’ll need to add an annotation scale to all of them before they 
can automatically adjust themselves to the different scales that you’ll use with your drawing. If 
you have the Automatically Add Scales To Annotative Objects tool turned on in the status bar, 
this happens automatically. Otherwise, you’ll have to add the scales to each annotative object. 
This is easy to do because you have the option to select as many objects as you need when add-
ing annotation scales.
Text and Scale in Legacy Drawings
AutoCAD 2017 offers the Annotative Scale feature to automate the scaling of text and other objects 
to their proper size based on the drawing’s annotation scale. However, there is a good chance you’ll 
encounter drawings that were created before the Annotative Scale feature was available. For that 
reason, you should have a basic understanding of scale factors as they apply to text.
As you know by now, AutoCAD lets you draw at full scale—that is, you can represent distances as 
values equivalent to the actual size of the object. When you plot the drawing later, you tell AutoCAD 
the scale at which you want to plot and the program reduces the drawing accordingly. This gives you 
the freedom to enter measurements at full scale and not worry about converting them to various 
scales every time you enter a distance. Unfortunately, in earlier versions of AutoCAD this feature 
created problems when users entered text and dimensions. You had to make the text height very 
large in order for it to be readable when scaled down.
To illustrate this point, imagine that you’re drawing the unit plan at full size on a very large sheet 
of paper. When you’re finished with this drawing, it will be reduced to a scale that enables it to fit 

Understanding the Text Style Dialog Box Options |  313  
Understanding the Text Style Dialog Box Options
You’ve just taken nearly all the steps you’ll need to know to add text to any drawing. Now let’s 
take a step back and look more closely at some of the finer points of adding text, starting with 
text styles. The following sections give you more detailed information about the text style set-
tings you saw in the early part of this chapter. They explain those settings and their purposes. 
Some of them, such as Width Factor, can be quite useful. Others, such as the Backwards and 
Vertical options, are rarely used. Take a moment to study these settings to become familiar  
with what is available and make a mental note of these items for future reference.
Styles
In the Styles list box, you’ll see a list showing the current style. This list also contains other 
styles that may be present in the drawing. The drop-down list below the Styles list box lets you 
control whether all styles are listed or just those that are being used in the drawing. In addition, 
there are the Set Current, New, and Delete buttons and options in the Font and Effects groups. 
You have already seen the Size group.
Set Current/New/Delete
Set Current makes the selected style the current one. New lets you create a new text style. Delete 
lets you delete the selected style.
The Delete option isn’t available for the Standard style.
Font
In the Font group, you have the following options:
Font Name    Lets you select a font from a list of available fonts. The list is derived from 
the font resources available to Windows 10, Windows 8, or Windows 7, plus the standard 
AutoCAD fonts.
Font Style    Offers variations of a font, such as italic or bold, when they’re available.
Use Big Font    Applicable to Asian fonts. This option is offered only with AutoCAD fonts.
on an 8-1/2″ × 11″ sheet of paper. Thus you have to make your text large to keep it legible after it’s 
reduced. If you want text to appear 1⁄8″ high when the drawing is plotted, you must convert it to 
a considerably larger size when you draw it. To do so, you multiply the desired height of the final 
plotted text by a scale conversion factor. (See Chapter 3, “Setting Up and Using the Drafting Tools,” 
for more on scale conversion factors.)
For example, if your drawing is at a 1⁄8″ = 1′-0″ scale, you multiply the desired text height, 1⁄8″, 
by the scale conversion factor of 96 to get a height of 12″. This is the height you must make your 
text to get 1⁄8″-high text in the final plot.
With AutoCAD 2017, you don’t have to work through the math to get the right text size for your 
drawing. But if you encounter a drawing that was created in an earlier version of AutoCAD and you 
notice that the text size is very large, you’ll know why.

314  | CHAPTER 9  Adding Text to Drawings   
Size
The Size group offers settings relating to text size, scale, and orientation.
Annotative    Causes the text size to adjust automatically to the current annotation scale 
setting.
Match Text Orientation To Layout    Causes the text orientation to match the orientation of a 
layout view. This option is available only when the Annotative option is on.
Height/Paper Text Height    Lets you enter a font size. With the Annotative option turned off, 
this option is named Height and will set the absolute height of the text. With the Annotative 
option turned on, it shows Paper Text Height and will set the height of the text when printed. 
A 0 height has special meaning when you use the Text command to enter single-line text as 
described later in this chapter.
Effects
In the Effects group, you have the following options:
Upside Down    Displays text upside down.
Backwards    Displays text backward.
Vertical    Displays text in a vertical column (not available with TrueType fonts).
Width Factor    Adjusts the width and spacing of the characters in the text. A value of 1 keeps 
the text at its normal width. Values greater than 1 expand the text, and values less than 1 
compress the text.
Oblique Angle    Skews the text at an angle. When this option is set to a value greater than 
0, the text appears italicized. A value of less than 0 (–12, for example) causes the text to lean 
to the left.
You can also set the width factor and oblique angle directly for text using the Width Factor 
and Oblique Angle tools in the expanded Formatting panel under the Text Editor Ribbon panel. 
This tab is available when you create new text or double-click existing text.
Renaming a Text Style or Other Named Object
If you need to rename a text style or other named object in AutoCAD, you can do so using the 
Rename command. Enter Ren↵ at the Command prompt to open the Rename dialog box. In 
the Named Objects list box to the left, choose Text Styles. Click the name of the style that you 
want to change from the Items list on the right; the name appears in the Old Name box below 
the list. In the box next to the Rename To button, enter the new name. Click the Rename To 
button, and click OK.

Exploring Text Formatting in AutoCAD
You’ve seen how you can set up a style and make scale adjustments. AutoCAD also offers a 
wide range of text-formatting options that are typical of the options in most word processing 
programs. You can control fonts, text height, justification, line spacing, and width. You can even 
include special characters such as degree symbols or stacked fractions. With these additional 
formatting tools, you can make adjustments to the text style with which you started.
Adjusting the Text Height and Font
To get some experience using the text-formatting tools in AutoCAD, try the following ­ 
exercise. You’ll use the Multiline Text tool again, but this time you’ll get to try some of its 
other features.
In this exercise, you’ll see how you can use the Ribbon tools to adjust the size and font of 
text:

2.	 In the status bar, make sure that Annotation Scale is set to 1/4″ = 1′-0″ (1:100 for metric 
users).
	
3.	 Click the Multiline Text tool on the Annotate tab’s Text panel, and then select a text 
boundary window, as shown in the first image in Figure 9.8.
	
4.	 In the text editor, type the following:
Living Room
14'-0" by 16'-5" [427 cm by 500 cm]
	
	 Be sure that you press ↵ after Living Room, but make the rest of the text a continuous 
string. As you type, the words wrap. AutoCAD uses word wrap to fit the text inside the 
text boundary area.
	
5.	 Highlight the text 14′-0″ by 16′-5″ [427 cm by 500 cm] as you would in any word proces-
sor. For example, you can click the end of the line to place the cursor there and then 
Shift+click the beginning of the line to highlight the whole line.
	
6.	 In the Text Editor tab’s Style panel, click in the Text Height text box and enter 1/16↵. 
Metric users, enter 0.08↵. The highlighted text changes to a smaller size.
	
7.	 Highlight the words Living Room.
	
8.	 In the Formatting panel, click the Font drop-down list to display a list of font options.
	
9.	 Scroll up the list until you find Arial. The text in the text editor changes to reflect the 
new font.
	
10.	 With the words Living Room still highlighted, click the Underline button in the 
Formatting panel.
	
11.	 Click Close Text Editor in the Close panel. The label appears in the area you indicated in 
step 3 (see the bottom image in Figure 9.8).
	
12.	 To see how you can go back to the Text Editor tab, double-click the text. The Text Editor 
tab and text editor appear, enabling you to change the text.
	
13.	 Click Close Text Editor in the Close panel.
While using the Multiline Text tool, you may have noticed the [Height/Justify/Line 
spacing/Rotation/Style/Width/Columns]: prompt immediately after you picked the first 
point of the text boundary. You can use any of these options to make on-the-fly modifications to 
the height, justification, line spacing, rotation style, or width of the multiline text.
For example, after clicking the first point for the text boundary, you can type R↵ and then 
specify a rotation angle for the text window, either graphically with a rubber-banding line or by 
entering an angle value. After you’ve entered a rotation angle, you can resume selecting the text 
boundary.

Understanding the Text Editor Tab 
You’ve just experimented with a few of the Text Formatting features of the Text Editor tab. A 
variety of additional formatting tools are available. Figure 9.9 shows where these tools are, and 
Table 9.1 describes their uses. Note that Figure 9.9 shows the Ribbon with the AutoCAD window 
at a 1024-pixel width. The Style panel will display the text styles as a list in large displays. These 
Ribbon tools are fairly straightforward, and if you’ve used other word processing programs, you 
should find them easy to use. Most are common to the majority of word processors, although a 
few—such as Symbol, Oblique Angle, and Width Factor—are unique to AutoCAD. Look at  
Table 9.1 and see if there are any tools that you think you’ll find useful.

Adding Symbols and Special Characters
The Text Editor tab also offers a tool called Symbol. This tool lets you add special symbols com-
mon to technical drawing and drafting. Figure 9.10 shows the symbols that are offered in the 
Symbol tool in the form of a drop-down list.
Figure 9.10
The AutoCAD symbols
At the bottom of the Symbol drop-down list is an option called Other. By clicking the Other 
option, you open the Windows Character Map dialog box (see Figure 9.11). Characters such 
as the trademark (™) and copyright (©) symbols are often available in the fonts offered in the 
Character Map. The contents of the Character Map depend on the font currently selected.
The Character Map is a Windows accessory. If it doesn’t appear when you choose Other from 
the Symbol tool menu, you may need to install the Character Map from your Windows installa-
tion DVD.
Figure 9.11
The Character Map

320  | CHAPTER 9  Adding Text to Drawings   
Finally, if your application requires music, math, astronomy, Greek, or other symbols, 
AutoCAD offers a set of fonts with special symbols. Figure 9.17, later in this chapter, shows these 
fonts and the symbols that they contain. You can set up text styles with these fonts or call them 
up directly from the Formatting panel’s Font option.
Adding a Frame Around Text
If you need to place a rectangular frame around text, you can draw a rectangle to enclose the text. 
However, if the text is edited, the box must be adjusted to fit the changes in the text size. To make 
life a little easier, AutoCAD offers a text property that will draw a frame that automatically adjusts 
to the size of the text whenever it is edited.
To add a frame to text, select the text and then right-click and select Properties from the context 
menu. Scroll down the list of properties until you find the Text frame option. Select Yes from the 
Text frame option drop-down list.
Text Justification and Osnaps 
You may have noticed that the object-justification list offers three center options: Top Center, 
Middle Center, and Bottom Center. All three of these options have the same effect on the text’s 
appearance, but they each have a different effect on how osnaps act on the text. Figure 9.12 
shows where the osnap point occurs on a text boundary depending on which justification option 
is selected. A multiline text object has only one insertion point on its boundary, which you can 
access with the Insert osnap.

The osnap point also appears as an extra grip point on the text boundary when you click the 
text. If you were to center-justify the text that you just entered, you would see that a grip point 
appears at the top center of the text boundary.
Knowing where the osnap points occur can be helpful when you want to align the text with 
other objects in your drawing. In most cases, you can use the grips to align your text bound-
ary, but the Top Center and Middle Center justification options enable you to use the center and 
middle portions of your text to align the text with other objects.
Changing Justification of Multiple Text Objects 
You’ve seen how you can change the justification of an individual text object, but you’ll often 
find that you need to change the justification of several text objects at one time. AutoCAD offers 
the Justifytext command for this purpose. To use it, click the Justify tool in the Annotate tab’s 
Text panel, or type Justifytext↵ at the Command prompt. At the Select objects: prompt, 
select the text that you want to change and then press ↵ to confirm your selection. You’ll see the 
following prompt in the command line (or at the cursor if Dynamic Input is on):
[Left/Align/Fit/Center/Middle/Right/TL/TC/TR/ML/MC/MR/BL/BC/BR] <Left>:
Enter the letters corresponding to the type of justification that you want to use for the text. 
(See the section “Justifying Single-Line Text Objects” later in this chapter for a description of 
these options.) After you enter an option, the selected text changes to conform to the selected 
justification option.
Setting Indents and Tabs
You should also know about the indent and tab features of the text editor. You may have noticed 
the ruler at the top of the text editor. Figure 9.13 shows that ruler, including tabs and indent 
markers.
Figure 9.13
The ruler at the top of 
the text editor lets you 
quickly set tabs and 
indents for text.
Indent markers
Tab markers
The indent markers let you control the indention of the first line and the rest of the para-
graph. The tab markers give you control over tab spacing. For new text, the tab markers don’t 
appear until you add them by clicking the ruler. The following exercises will demonstrate the 
use of these markers.
Start by practicing with the indent markers:
	
1.	 Save the unit drawing, and then open the indent.dwg file. This file contains some text 
with which you’ll experiment.
	
2.	 Double-click the text at the top of the drawing to open the Text Editor tab.

322  | CHAPTER 9  Adding Text to Drawings   
	
3.	 Press Ctrl+A to highlight all the text in the text editor. This is necessary to indicate the 
text group to be affected by your indent settings.
	
4.	 Click and drag the top indent marker two spaces to the right. The indent of the first 
line moves with the marker. A note appears above the ruler showing you how much 
indent you’re applying. Also notice that the text at the first tab remains at its starting 
location.
	
5.	 Click and drag the bottom indent marker two spaces to the left. The rest of the paragraph 
moves with the marker. Again, you see a note by the ruler showing how much indent 
you’re applying.
	
6.	 Click the Close Text Editor tool in the Text Editor tab to exit.
Here you see how you can control the indents of the selected text with the indent markers. 
You can set paragraphs of a single Mtext object differently, giving you a wide range of indent-
formatting possibilities. Just select the text you want to set, and then adjust the indent markers.
Now try the tab markers. For this exercise, you’ll try the text-import feature to import a tab-
delimited text file:
	
1.	 Click the Multiline Text tool on the Annotate tab’s Text panel.
	
2.	 For the first corner of the text boundary, click the upper-left corner of the large rectangle 
in the drawing, just below the paragraph.
	
3.	 For the opposite corner of the text boundary, click the lower-right corner of the rectangle.
	
4.	 Right-click in the text editor, and select Import Text.
	
5.	 In the Select File dialog box, locate and select the tabtest.txt file and then click Open. 
The contents of the tabtest.txt file are displayed in the text editor.
The file you just imported was generated from the Attribute Extraction Wizard in AutoCAD. 
You’ll learn more about this feature in Chapter 12, “Using Attributes.” This file contains tabs to 
align the columns of information. You can adjust those tabs in the Text Formatting toolbar, as 
you’ll see in the next set of steps.
Now use the tab markers to adjust the tab spacing of the columns of text:
	
1.	 Press Ctrl+A to select all the text.
	
2.	 Click the ruler at a point that is at the 12th mark from the left (that’s three of the taller tick 
marks in the ruler). An L-shaped marker appears, and the first tab column of text moves 
to this position.

Exploring Text Formatting in AutoCAD |  323  
	
3.	 Click the ruler again at the 20th mark. The second tab column aligns to this position.
	
4.	 Continue to click the ruler to add more tab markers so that the text looks similar to 
Figure 9.14. Don’t worry about being exact; this is just for practice. After you’ve placed a 
marker, you can click and drag it to make adjustments.
Figure 9.14
Add tab markers so 
that your text looks 
similar to this figure.
	
5.	 Click Close Text Editor in the Text Editor tab’s Close panel. The text appears in the draw-
ing as a door schedule.
Here you saw how you can create a table or a schedule from an imported text file. You can 
also create a schedule from scratch by composing it directly in the text editor of the Multiline 
Text command. AutoCAD also offers the Table feature, which is specifically designed for creat-
ing tables (see Chapter 10). Still, the previous example offers a way to demonstrate the tab fea-
ture in the Multiline Text tool, and you may encounter a file in which a table is formatted in the 
way described here.
In addition to using the indent and tab markers on the ruler, you can control indents and tabs 
through the Paragraph dialog box. Do the following to get a firsthand look:
	
1.	 Double-click the text at the top of the indent.dwg drawing (the one you edited in the first 
part of this section), and then press Ctrl+A to select all the text.
	
2.	 Right-click the ruler above the text editor, and select Paragraph to open the Paragraph 
dialog box (see Figure 9.15). The Paragraph dialog box also lets you set other para-
graph settings, such as alignment, spacing between paragraphs, and line spacing in the 
paragraph.
	
3.	 Change the value in the First Line box to 1.5 and the Hanging box to 2.2.
	
4.	 Double-click the tab position box in the upper-left corner, just below the row of tab sym-
bols in the Tab group. Enter 2.2, and click the Add button.

324  | CHAPTER 9  Adding Text to Drawings   
	
5.	 Click OK. The text now appears indented from the numbers.
	
6.	 Click the Close Text Editor tool in the Close panel. The text in the drawing is now format-
ted as it appeared in the text editor.
	
7.	 Close but do not save the indent.dwg file.
In this exercise, you used the Paragraph dialog box to set the paragraph indent and the first 
tab marker to be the same value. This causes the text portion of the list to be aligned at a dis-
tance of 2.2 drawing units from the left text boundary, leaving the list number extended farther 
to the left. This gives the list a more professional appearance.
Figure 9.15
The Paragraph  
dialog box
Setting Exact Mtext Width and Height
You may have noticed the options Set Mtext Width and Set Mtext Height in the right-click context 
menu in step 2 of the exercise using the Paragraph dialog box. The Set Mtext Width option opens 
a dialog box that enables you to enter a width for paragraph columns where there are multiple 
columns. The Set Mtext Height allows you to enter an exact height for columns.
The Paragraph dialog box gives you fine control over the formatting of your text. It lets you 
delete tabs by highlighting them in the list and clicking the Remove button. You can also add 
tabs at specific distances from the left margin of the text boundary by entering new tab locations 
in the Tab box and clicking the Add button.

What Do the Fonts Look Like? |  325  
You specify distances in drawing units. If your drawing is set up to use architectural units, 
for example, you can enter values in feet and inches or just inches. In the First Line and Hanging 
boxes, you enter a numeric value for paragraph indents. As you’ve just seen, you can use the 
First Line and Hanging boxes to create a numbered list by setting the Hanging box value to be 
the same as the first tab stop position.
What Do the Fonts Look Like?
You’ve already seen a few of the fonts available in AutoCAD. Chances are that you’re familiar 
with the TrueType fonts available in Windows. You have some additional AutoCAD fonts from 
which to choose. You may want to stick with the AutoCAD fonts for all but your presentation 
drawings because other fonts can consume more memory.
Importing Text Files
With multiline text objects, AutoCAD enables you to import ASCII text (TXT) or Rich Text Format 
(RTF) files. RTF files can be exported from Microsoft Word and most other word processing pro-
grams, and they retain most of their formatting in AutoCAD. Here’s how you import text files:
	1.	 With the Multiline Text tool open, right-click in the text area and choose Import Text.
	2.	 In the Select File dialog box, locate a valid text file. It must be a file in either a raw text (ASCII) 
format, such as a Notepad file (with the filename extension.txt), or RTF (with the filename exten-
sion.rtf). RTF files can store formatting information such as boldface and varying point sizes.
	3.	 After you’ve highlighted the file you want, double-click it or click Open. The text appears in the 
text editor window.
	4.	 Click the Close Text Editor button, and the text appears in your drawing.
You can use the Windows Clipboard and the Cut and Paste functions to add text to a drawing. To 
do this, follow these steps:
	1.	 Select some text and then choose Cut or Copy in any Windows program to place the text on the 
Windows Clipboard.
	2.	 Open AutoCAD. Right-click in the drawing area, and choose Clipboard ➢ Paste. Click a point in 
the drawing to place the text; the pasted text appears in your drawing. However, it isn’t editable 
in AutoCAD. You can adjust the size of the text using grips.
Additionally, you may drag and drop TXT and RTF files directly from Windows File Explorer into 
AutoCAD with the same results.
If the text is from a text editor like Windows Notepad, it is inserted as AutoCAD text. If the text 
contains formatting from a word processor, like Microsoft Word, the text is an OLE object.
Because AutoCAD is an OLE client, you can also attach other types of documents to an AutoCAD 
drawing file. See Chapter 19, “Getting and Exchanging Data from Drawings,” for more on OLE 
support in AutoCAD.
Figure 9.16 shows the basic AutoCAD text fonts. The Romans font is perhaps the most widely 
used because it offers a reasonable appearance while consuming little memory. Figure 9.17 lists 
some of the symbols and Greek fonts.

326  | CHAPTER 9  Adding Text to Drawings   
The Textfill System Variable
Unlike the standard sticklike AutoCAD fonts, TrueType and PostScript fonts have filled areas. These 
filled areas take more time to generate, so if you use these fonts for a lot of text, your redraw and 
regen times will increase. To help reduce redraw and regen times, you can set AutoCAD to display 
and plot these fonts as outline fonts while still printing them as solid fonts.
To change this setting, type Textfill↵ and then type 0↵. Doing so turns off text fill for PostScript 
and TrueType fonts.

In the following sections, you’ll work with some of the AutoCAD fonts. You can see samples 
of all the fonts, including TrueType fonts, in the preview window of the Text Style dialog box. 
If you use a word processor, you’re probably familiar with at least some of the TrueType fonts 
available in Windows and AutoCAD.

Adding Simple Single-Line Text Objects |  327  
Adding Simple Single-Line Text Objects
You might find that you’re entering a lot of single words or simple labels that don’t require 
all the bells and whistles of the multiline text editor. AutoCAD offers the single-line text object, 
which is simpler to use and can speed text entry if you’re adding only small pieces of text.
Continue the tutorial on the Unit.dwg or the 9b-unit.dwg sample file by trying the follow-
ing exercise:
	
1.	 Adjust your view so that you see the part of the drawing shown in Figure 9.18.

to the kitchen and 
bath by using the Text 
command
	
2.	 Make sure that Note1 is the current text style, and then, from the Multiline Text flyout on 
the Annotate tab’s Text panel, click the Single Line tool, or enter Dt↵.
	
3.	 At the Specify start point of text or [Justify/Style]: prompt, pick the starting 
point for the text that you’re about to enter, just below the kitchen at coordinate 17′-2″,22′-
5″ (490,664 for metric users). Note that the prompt offers the Justify and Style options.
	
4.	 At the Specify rotation angle of text <0>: prompt, press ↵ to accept the default, 0. 
You can specify any angle that you like at this prompt (for example, if you want your text 
aligned with a rotated object). You see a text I-beam cursor at the point that you picked in 
step 3.

328  | CHAPTER 9  Adding Text to Drawings   
	
5.	 Type Kitchenette. As you type, the word appears directly in the drawing.
Pasting Text from Other Sources
You can paste text from the Clipboard into the cursor location by using the Ctrl+V keyboard shortcut 
or by right-clicking in the drawing area to access the context menu.
Continuing Where You Left Off
If for some reason you need to stop entering single-line text objects to do something else in 
AutoCAD, you can continue the text where you left off by starting the Text command and then 
pressing ↵ at the Specify start point of text or [Justify/Style]: prompt. The text 
continues immediately below the last line of text entered.
	
6.	 This time, you want to label the bathroom. Pick a point to the right of the door swing; you 
can approximate the location since you can always adjust the text location later. The text 
cursor moves to that point.
	
7.	 Type Bathroom↵. Figure 9.18 shows how your drawing should look now.
	
8.	 Press ↵ again to exit the Text command.
Here you were able to add two single lines of text in different parts of your drawing fairly 
quickly. Text uses the current default text style settings. If you want to create a column of single-
line text, you can press ↵ to move the cursor down to start a new line below the one you just 
entered.
To edit single-line text, you can double-click the text. The text is highlighted, and you can 
begin typing to replace it all, or you can click a location in the text to make single word or char-
acter changes.
This is the end of the tutorial section of this chapter. The rest of this chapter offers additional 
information about text.
Justifying Single-Line Text Objects
Justifying single-line text objects is slightly different than justifying multiline text. For example, 
if you change the justification setting to Center, the text moves so that the center is placed at 
the text-insertion point. In other words, the insertion point stays in place while the text location 
adjusts to the new justification setting. Figure 9.19 shows the relationship between single-line 
text and the insertion point based on different justification settings.
To set the justification of text as you enter it, you must enter J↵ at the Specify start point 
of text or [Justify/Style]: prompt after issuing the Text command. You can also change 
the current default style by entering S↵ and then the name of the style at the Specify start 
point of text or [Justify/Style]: prompt.

Objective

Adding Simple Single-Line Text Objects |  329  
After you’ve issued Text’s Justify option, you get the following prompt:
Enter an option
[Align/Fit/Center/Middle/Right/TL/TC/TR/ML/MC/MR/BL/BC/BR]:
Here are descriptions of each of these options. (We’ve left Fit and Align until last because 
they require more explanation.)
Center    This centers the text on the start point with the baseline on the start point.
Middle    This centers the text on the start point with the baseline slightly below the start point.
Right    This justifies the text to the right of the start point with the baseline on the start point.
TL, TC, and TR    TL, TC, and TR stand for Top Left, Top Center, and Top Right. When you 
use these justification styles, the text appears entirely below the start point, justified left, 
­center, or right, depending on which option you choose.
ML, MC, and MR    ML, MC, and MR stand for Middle Left, Middle Center, and Middle 
Right. These styles are similar to TL, TC, and TR, except that the start point determines a 
location midway between the baseline and the top of the lowercase letters of the text.
BL, BC, and BR    BL, BC, and BR stand for Bottom Left, Bottom Center, and Bottom Right. 
These styles too are similar to TL, TC, and TR, but here the start point determines the bot-
tommost location of the letters of the text (the bottom of letters that have descenders, such as 
p, q, and g).
Align and Fit    With the Align and Fit justification options, you must specify a dimension 
in which the text is to fit. For example, suppose that you want the word Refrigerator to fit in 
the 26″-wide box representing the refrigerator. You can use either the Fit or the Align option 
to accomplish this. With Fit, AutoCAD prompts you to select start and end points and then 
stretches or compresses the letters to fit within the two points you specify. You use this 
option when the text must be a consistent height throughout the drawing and you don’t care 
about distorting the font. Align works like Fit, but instead of maintaining the current text 
style height, the Align option adjusts the text height to keep it proportional to the text width 
without distorting the font. Use this option when it’s important to maintain the font’s shape 
and proportion. Figure 9.20 demonstrates how Fit and Align work.
Figure 9.19

various justification 
options

330  | CHAPTER 9  Adding Text to Drawings   
You can change the justification of single-line text by using the Properties palette, but the text 
moves from its original location while maintaining its insertion point. If you want to change the 
justification of text without moving the text, you can use the Justifytext command. Click the Justify 
tool in the Annotate tab’s Text panel, or type Justifytext at the Command prompt and then select 
the text that you want to change. Justifytext works on both multiline and single-line text.
Using Special Characters with Single-Line Text Objects
Just as with multiline text, you can add a limited set of special characters to single-line text 
objects. For example, you can place the degree symbol (°) after a number, or you can underscore 
(underline) text. To accomplish this, you use double percent signs (%%) in conjunction with a 
special code. For example, to underscore text, you enclose that text with %% followed by the let-
ter u, which is the underscore code. So to create the text “This is underscored text,” you enter the 
following at the prompt:
This is %%uunderscored%%u text.
Overscoring (putting a line above the text) operates in the same manner. To insert codes for sym-
bols, you place the codes in the correct positions for the symbols they represent. For example, to 
enter 100.5°, you type 100.5%%d. Table 9.2 shows some other examples of special character codes.
Table 9.2:	
Special character codes

What it does
%%o
Toggles overscore on and off.
%%u

%%c
Places a diameter symbol where the code occurs.
%%d
Places a degree sign (°) where the code occurs.
%%p
Places a plus/minus sign where the code occurs.
%%%
Forces a single percent sign. This is useful when you want a percent sign in con-
junction with another code.
%%nnn
Allows the use of extended characters or Unicode characters when these char-
acters are available for a given font. nnn is the three-digit value representing 
the ASCII extended character code.

Using the Check Spelling Feature |  331  
Using the Character Map Dialog Box to Add Special Characters
You can add special characters to a single line of text in the same way that you add special char-
acters to multiline text. You may recall that to access special characters, you use the Character 
Map dialog box.
To open the Character Map dialog box, choose Start ➢ All Programs ➢ Accessories ➢ System 
Tools ➢ Character Map. You can then use the procedure discussed in the section “Adding 
Symbols and Special Characters” earlier in this chapter to cut and paste a character from the 
Character Map dialog box. If you use the Character Map dialog box often, create a shortcut for it 
and place the shortcut in your Start menu or on your Desktop.
Using the Check Spelling Feature
Although AutoCAD is primarily a drawing program, you’ll find that some of your drawings 
contain more text than graphics, and so AutoCAD does include a spell-checking tool. If you’ve 
ever used the spelling checker in a typical word processor, such as Microsoft Word, the opera-
tion in AutoCAD will be familiar to you.
How Check Spelling Works
The hardest part to using the Check Spelling tool is locating it in the Ribbon. Try the following 
to see how it works:
	
1.	 Click the Check Spelling tool in the Annotate tab’s Text panel. You can also type Sp↵. The 
Check Spelling dialog box appears (see Figure 9.21).
Keeping Text from Mirroring
At times, you’ll want to mirror a group of objects that contain some text. This operation causes 
the mirrored text to appear backward. You can change a setting in AutoCAD to make the text read 
normally even when it’s mirrored:
	1.	 At the Command prompt, enter Mirrtext↵.
	2.	 At the Enter new value for MIRRTEXT <1>: prompt, enter 0↵.
Now any mirrored text that isn’t in a block will read normally. The text’s position, however, will 
still be mirrored, as shown in the following example. Mirrtext is set to 0 by default.
Mirrored text
Original text

332  | CHAPTER 9  Adding Text to Drawings   
	
2.	 You can click the Start button to check the spelling in the entire drawing. Or, if you 
prefer, you can be more selective by choosing an option from the Where To Check drop-
down list. You can select a mixture of multiline and single-line text as well as dimension 
text, attributes, and text in Xrefs.
When the spelling checker finds a word that it doesn’t recognize, the Check Spelling dialog 
box shows you the word along with a suggested spelling. If the spelling checker finds more than 
one spelling, a list of suggested alternate words appears below the box. You can then highlight 
the desired replacement and click the Change button to change the misspelled word, or you 
can click Change All to change all occurrences of the word in the selected text. If the suggested 
word is inappropriate, choose another word from the replacement list (if any) or enter your own 
spelling in the Suggestions box. Then click Change or Change All.
Here is a list of the options available in the Check Spelling dialog box:
Add To Dictionary    Adds the word in question to the current dictionary.
Ignore    Skips the word.
Ignore All    Skips all occurrences of the word in the text being checked.
Change    Changes the word in question to the word you’ve selected from (or entered into) 
the Suggestions box.
Change All    Changes all occurrences of the current word when there are multiple instances 
of the misspelling.
Dictionaries    Lets you use a different dictionary to check spelling. This option opens the 
Dictionaries dialog box, described in the upcoming section.
The Check Spelling feature includes types of notations that are more likely to be found in 
technical drawings. It also checks the spelling of text that is included in block definitions, exter-
nally referenced files, and dimensions.
Choosing a Dictionary
Clicking the Dictionaries button in the Check Spelling dialog box opens the Dictionaries dialog 
box (see Figure 9.22), where you can select a main dictionary for foreign languages or create or 
choose a custom dictionary. The names of main dictionary files have the .dct extension. The 
main dictionary for the U.S. version of AutoCAD is Enu.dct.
Figure 9.21
The Check Spelling 
dialog box

Using the Check Spelling Feature |  333  
Figure 9.22
Choosing a dictionary
In the Dictionaries dialog box, you can also add or delete words from a custom dictionary. 
Custom dictionary files are ASCII files with names that end with the .cus extension. Because 
they’re ASCII files, you can edit them outside AutoCAD. Click the Current Custom Dictionary 
drop-down list to view a list of existing custom dictionaries.
If you prefer, you can select a main or custom dictionary by using the Dctmain system vari-
able. Click the Help button and then, in the Autodesk® Exchange window, select the Search tab. 
Enter Dctmain to learn more about the Dctmain system variable.
You can also select a dictionary from the Files tab of the Options dialog box (see Figure 9.23; 
choose Options from the Application menu). You can find the dictionary list under Text Editor, 
Dictionary, And Font File Names. Click the plus sign next to this item, and then click the plus 
sign next to the Main Dictionary item to display the dictionary options. From here, you can 
double-click the dictionary that you prefer.

334  | CHAPTER 9  Adding Text to Drawings   
Substituting Fonts
At times, you’ll want to change all the fonts in a drawing quickly. For instance, you might need 
to convert the font of a drawing received from another office to a font that conforms to your own 
office standards. The Fontmap system variable works in conjunction with a font-mapping table, 
enabling you to substitute fonts in a drawing easily.
The font-mapping table is an ASCII file called Acad.fmp, which is located in the 
C:\Users\User Name\AppData\Roaming\Autodesk\AutoCAD 2017\R21.0\enu\Support 
folder. You can also use a file that you create yourself. You can give this file any name you 
choose, as long as it has the .fmp extension.
This font-mapping table contains one line for each font substitution that you want AutoCAD 
to make. A typical line in this file reads as follows:
romant; C:\Program Files\Autodesk\AutoCAD 2017\Fonts\txt.shx
In this example, AutoCAD is directed to use the txt.shx font in place of the romant.shx 
font. To execute this substitution, you type Fontmap↵Fontmap_filename↵.
Fontmap_filename is the font-mapping table that you created. This tells AutoCAD where 
to look for the font-mapping information. Then you issue the Regen command to view the font 
changes. To disable the font-mapping table, type Fontmap↵.
You can also specify a font-mapping file in the Files tab of the Options dialog box. Look for 
the Text Editor, Dictionary, And Font File Names listing. Click the plus sign next to this listing, 
and then click the plus sign next to the Font Mapping File listing to display the name and loca-
tion of the current default font-mapping file. If you hold the cursor over the name, AutoCAD 
displays the full location of the file (see Figure 9.24).
Figure 9.24
AutoCAD shows the 
full path to the font-
mapping file.
You can double-click this filename to open the Select A File dialog box. From there, you can 
select a different font-mapping file.

Finding and Replacing Text |  335  
Finding and Replacing Text
One of the most time-consuming tasks in drafting is replacing text that appears repeatedly 
throughout a drawing. Fortunately, you have a Find And Replace tool to help simplify this task. 
Find And Replace in AutoCAD works like any other find-and-replace tool in a word processing 
program. A few options work specifically with AutoCAD. Here’s how it works:
	
1.	 Enter the text that you want to locate in the Find Text box located in the middle of the 
Annotate tab’s Text panel (see Figure 9.25), and then click the magnifying glass to the 
right. The Find And Replace dialog box opens, and the drawing area displays the part 
where the text has been found.
Figure 9.25
Using Find And 
Replace
	
2.	 Enter the replacement text in the Replace With box.
	
3.	 When you’ve made certain that this is the text that you want to change, click Replace. If 
you want to replace all occurrences of the text in the drawing, click Replace All.
	
4.	 If you want to skip over the found text, click Find Next to locate the next instance of the 
text in your drawing. If the text is not found, AutoCAD returns to your original view.
You can also enter Find↵ at the Command prompt to open the Find And Replace dialog box 
and then enter the text that you want in the Find What text box.
To limit your find-and-replace operation to a specific set of objects in your drawing, choose 
Selected Objects from the Find Where drop-down list. Once you’ve selected this option, click the 
Select Objects tool in the upper-right corner of the Find And Replace dialog box (see Figure 9.26).
Figure 9.26
The Select Objects tool
Select Objects tool 
When you click the Select Objects tool, the Find And Replace dialog box closes temporarily to 
enable you to select a set of objects or a region of your drawing. Find And Replace then limits its 
search to those objects or the region you select.

336  | CHAPTER 9  Adding Text to Drawings   
Making Substitutions for Missing Fonts
When text styles are created, the associated fonts don’t become part of the drawing file. Instead, 
AutoCAD loads the needed font file at the same time the drawing is loaded. If a text style in a 
drawing requires a particular font, AutoCAD looks for the font in the AutoCAD search path; if the 
font is there, it’s loaded. Usually this isn’t a problem if the drawing file uses the standard fonts that 
come with AutoCAD or Windows. But occasionally, you’ll encounter a file that uses a custom font.
In earlier versions of AutoCAD, you saw an error message when you attempted to open such a file. 
This missing-font message often sent new AutoCAD users into a panic.
Fortunately, now AutoCAD automatically substitutes an existing font for the missing font in a 
drawing. By default, AutoCAD substitutes the simplex.shx font, but you can specify another font 
by using the Fontalt system variable. Type Fontalt↵ at the Command prompt, and then enter 
the name of the font that you want to use as the substitute.
You can also select an alternate font through the Files tab of the Options dialog box. Locate the 
Text Editor, Dictionary, And Font File Names listing, and then click the plus sign at the left. Locate 
the Alternate Font File item, and click the plus sign at the left. The current alternate is listed. You 
can double-click the font name to select a different font through the Alternate Font dialog box.
Be aware that the text in your drawing will change in appearance, sometimes radically, when you 
use a substitute font. If the text in the drawing must retain its appearance, substitute a font that 
is as similar in appearance to the original font as possible.
You can further control the types of objects that Find And Replace looks for by clicking the 
More Options tool in the lower-left corner of the Find And Replace dialog box. The dialog box 
expands to show more options (see Figure 9.27).
Figure 9.27

for Find And Replace

Finding and Replacing Text |  337  
Speeding Up AutoCAD with Qtext
If you need to edit a large drawing that contains a lot of text but you don’t need to edit the text, 
you can use the Qtext command to help accelerate redraws and regenerations when you’re working 
on the drawing. Qtext turns lines of text into rectangular boxes, saving AutoCAD from having 
to form every letter. This enables you to see the note locations so that you don’t accidentally draw 
over them. To use it, enter qtext↵ at the Command prompt and enter On or select the On option 
from the Dynamic Input display.
Create Paragraph Columns
You can format Mtext into multiple columns. This can be useful for long lists or to create a newspa-
per column appearance for your text. Text formatted into columns will automatically flow between 
columns as you add or remove text.
To format text into columns, do the following:
	1.	 Create the text using the Mtext tool as usual.
	2.	 Click and drag the corner resizer at the bottom-right corner of the text upward. As you do this, a 
second column appears.
Click and drag the corner at the 
bottom of the column upward 
to create new columns.
Click and drag the double-headed arrow 
in the ruler to adjust column spacing.
Click and drag the diamond icon 
to adjust the column width.
	3.	 If you want to create another column, click and drag the bottom edge of the rightmost column 
upward.
continues
With this dialog box, you can refine your search by limiting it to blocks, dimension text, 
standard text, or hyperlink text. You can also specify whether to match the case and find whole 
words only.

338  | CHAPTER 9  Adding Text to Drawings   
	4.	 To adjust the column width, click and drag the diamond icon that appears just to the right of the 
first column in the ruler. All of the columns will adjust to the width of the first column.
Once you’ve set up your columns, click the Close Text Editor tool. You can adjust the column width 
and spacing by using grips that appear when you click the text.
Click and drag 
this grip to adjust 
the column width.
Click and drag the grips at 
the bottom of the columns 
to adjust the column height.
Click and drag the grip of 
the last column upward to 
add more columns.
Click and drag 
this grip to adjust 
the column spacing.
To adjust the column width of existing Mtext, click and drag the arrow grip at the top and to the 
right of the first column. To adjust the width between columns (the column spacing), click and 
drag the arrow grip at the top and to the right of the last column. The grips at the bottom of each 
column allow you to adjust the height of the columns.
You can manually set column features through the Column Settings dialog box. To open it, double-
click the Mtext and then choose Column Settings from the Columns flyout in the Text Editor tab’s 
Insert panel.
The Dynamic Columns option is the default for the Column Type group, and it allows you to adjust 
the column size using grips.

Chapter  10
Using Fields and Tables
Adding text to a set of drawings can become a large part of your work. You’ll find that you’re 
editing notes and labels almost as frequently as you’re editing the graphics in your drawings. 
To make some of those editing tasks easier, the AutoCAD® 2017 software provides a few special 
text objects.
In this chapter, we’ll look at fields and tables, two features that can help automate some of the 
most common tasks in AutoCAD.
Fields are a special type of text object that can automatically update to reflect changes in 
the drawing. The Table feature is a tool that helps automate the process of creating and editing 
tables and schedules. Tables are a common part of technical drawings and are similar to spread-
sheets. In fact, AutoCAD tables behave much like spreadsheets, giving you the ability to add 
formulas to cells.
We’ll start this chapter with an introduction to fields and then go on to explore tables. 
Toward the end, we’ll revisit fields to see how they can be used to add formulas to tables.
In this chapter, you will learn to

Using Fields to Associate Text with Drawing Properties
The text labels you worked with in Chapter 9, “Adding Text to Drawings,” are static and don’t 
change unless you edit them by using the tools described in that chapter. Another type of text 
object, called a field, behaves in a more dynamic way than the multiline text. A field can be 
linked to the properties of other objects so that it updates itself automatically as the associated 
properties change. For example, you can create a field that is associated with a block name. If the 
block name changes, the field text automatically changes as well.
Try the following exercise to see how this works:
	
1.	 Open the 10c-unit.dwg file. This file is similar to the drawing you worked on in Chapter 9.

342  | CHAPTER 10  Using Fields and Tables  
	
2.	 Double-click the Kitchen text to highlight it and make it available for editing.
	
3.	 Right-click the highlighted Kitchen text, and then choose Insert Field to open the Field 
dialog box (see Figure 10.1). A list to the left shows the types of fields available. Don’t 
worry if your dialog box looks different from Figure 10.1. The appearance will change in 
the following steps.
Figure 10.1
Choose the field 
you want to insert.
	
4.	 In the Field Category drop-down list, select Objects. This limits the display of field types 
to object fields.
	
5.	 In the Field Names list, select NamedObject.
	
6.	 Make sure that Block is selected in the Named Object Type drop-down list in the top of 
the dialog box, and then select KITCHEN from the Name list. This associates the field 
with the KITCHEN block name.
	
7.	 In the Format list to the far right, select First Capital. This causes the field text to be lower-
case with a capital first letter (also referred to as sentence case), regardless of how the block 
name is spelled.
	
8.	 Click OK to exit the Field dialog box, and then press ↵ twice to return to the Command prompt.
When you return to the drawing, the text appears in a gray background. This tells you that 
the text is a field rather than an Mtext or text object. The gray background is a device to help you 
keep track of field text; it doesn’t plot.

Using Fields to Associate Text with Drawing Properties |  343  
You’ve converted existing text into a field that is linked to a block name. Now let’s see how 
the field works:
	
1.	 Enter Rename↵ at the Command prompt to open the Rename dialog box.
	
2.	 Make sure Blocks is selected in the Named Objects list, and then select KITCHEN from 
the Items list. The word KITCHEN appears in the Old Name box near the bottom of the 
dialog box.
	
3.	 Enter Kitchenette in the box just below the Old Name box, and then click the Rename To 
button.
	
4.	 Click OK to close the Rename dialog box.
	
5.	 Type Re↵. The field you created changes to reflect the new block name.
Fields can be associated with a wide variety of properties. You’ve just seen how a block name 
can be associated with a field. In this exercise, you’ll use a field to display the area of an object:
	
1.	 Click Zoom Extents from the Zoom flyout on the Navigation bar or type Z↵E↵ to view 
the entire plan.
	
2.	 Use the Rectangle command to place a rectangle in the living room area, as shown in 
Figure 10.2.
Figure 10.2
Place a rectangle that 
fills the living room.
Rectangle
	
3.	 Double-click the Living Room text to open the Text Editor tab and the text editor.
	
4.	 Highlight the text that reads 230 square feet. Right-click the selected text, and choose 
Insert Field from the context menu.
	
5.	 In the Field dialog box, select Object from the Field Names list.
	
6.	 Click the Select Object button next to the Object Type box at the top of the Field dialog box 
(see Figure 10.3). The Field dialog box momentarily closes to enable you to select an object.

344  | CHAPTER 10  Using Fields and Tables  
	
7.	 Select the rectangle that you just added. The Field dialog box returns.
	
8.	 In the Property list just below the Object Type box, select Area.
	
9.	 Select Architectural from the Format list to the far right (see Figure 10.4).
Figure 10.3
Click the Select 
Object button.
Figure 10.4

option in the 
Format list
	
10.	 Click OK. The field you just added appears in the drawing as the area of the rectangle.
	
11.	 Click Close Text Editor in the Text Editor tab’s Close panel.
Next, you’ll alter the rectangle to see how it affects the field:
	
1.	 Click the rectangle to expose its grips (see Figure 10.5). Then select the top-middle grip of 
the rectangle, and move it upward so that the top edge aligns with the bathroom wall.
Figure 10.5
Expose the grips.
Move this grip
upward.

Adding Tables to Your Drawing |  345  
	
2.	 Type Re↵. The field that you just added updates to reflect the new area of the rectangle.
	
3.	 After reviewing the results, close 10c-unit.dwg without saving it.
In previous exercises, you changed existing text into fields. You can create new fields in either 
the Text or Mtext command by selecting Insert Field from the context menu whenever you’re 
typing the text content.
In this exercise, you used a rectangle, but you can use any closed polyline to create an area field.
We’ve touched on just two of the many possible uses for fields. You can associate other types of 
properties, including the current layer, the drawing name, linetypes, and more. You can include 
DIESEL macros as part of fields. (You’ll learn about DIESEL macros in Chapter 24, “Customizing 
Toolbars, Menus, Linetypes, and Hatch Patterns.”) Fields can also be used in the Table feature 
(described in the next section), which enables you to create tables and schedules quickly. Fields are used 
to coordinate sheet labels with reference symbols in the AutoCAD Sheet Set feature described in Bonus 
Chapter 7, “Keeping a Project Organized with Sheet Sets,” available at www.omura.com/chapters.
For most of your projects, the standard text objects will work just fine, but you may find fields 
useful when you know that a label has to be associated with specific types of data in your drawing. 
In later chapters, you’ll have more opportunities to work with fields.
Adding Tables to Your Drawing
One of the most common text-related tasks that you’ll do for your drawings is to create sched-
ules, such as door and window schedules or parts schedules. Such schedules are tables used to 
provide detailed information about the elements in your design.
In the past, AutoCAD users used Mtext or Text to create the content of schedules and then 
used line-drawing tools to create the cells of the schedule. Since AutoCAD 2006, you have been 
able to use tables to help you generate schedules more quickly. Tables allow you to format the 
columns and rows of text automatically, similar to formatting in spreadsheet programs.
Creating a Table
The first step in creating a table is to determine the number of rows and columns you want. 
Don’t worry if you aren’t certain of the exact number of rows and columns; you can add or sub-
tract them at any time. In this exercise, you’ll create a table that contains 12 rows and 9 columns, 
as shown in Figure 10.6.
Figure 10.6
A sample table created 
with the Table tool

346  | CHAPTER 10  Using Fields and Tables  
Start by creating the basic table layout:
	
1.	 Click New on the Quick Access toolbar, and use the standard acad.dwt drawing tem-
plate. You may also want to turn off the background grid to get a clear view of your work.
	
2.	 Click Table in the Home tab’s Annotation panel to open the Insert Table dialog box (see 
Figure 10.7). You can also click the Table tool in the Annotate tab’s Tables panel or type 
Tb↵.
Figure 10.7
The Insert Table 
dialog box
	
3.	 In the Column & Row Settings group, enter 9 for Columns and 12 for Data Rows.
	
4.	 Click OK. The dialog box closes, and the outline of a table follows your cursor.
	
5.	 Position the table in the center of your drawing area, and click to place it. The table 
appears with a cursor in the top cell. You also see the Text Editor tab in the Ribbon.
	
6.	 Enter Room Finish Schedule, and press ↵. The cursor moves to the next cell.
	
7.	 Click Close Text Editor in the Text Editor tab’s Close panel.
Adding Cell Text
You’ve just created a table and added a title. Notice that the table actually contains 14 rows, 
including the title row at the top and an additional row for the headings of each column. You 
can delete these additional rows if you don’t need them, but for now you’ll start to add some text 
to the table:
	
1.	 Adjust your view so that the table fills most of the drawing area.

Adding Tables to Your Drawing |  347  
	
2.	 Double-click in the first cell at the top left, just below the Room Finish Schedule label (see 
Figure 10.8). The cell turns gray, and the Text Editor tab appears in the Ribbon. You also 
see labels across the top and left side showing the row and column addresses.
Figure 10.8
Double-click the 
first cell shown 
here.
	
3.	 Enter Number for the room number column at the far left, and then press the Tab key to 
advance to the next cell to the right.
	
4.	 Enter Room, and press the Tab key again.
	
5.	 Enter Finish, and press the Tab key four times to advance four columns. You do this 
because the Finish heading shown earlier in Figure 10.6 has four columns under it: Floor, 
Base, Wall, and Ceiling. In the next exercise, you’ll learn how to format those four columns 
under the single heading.
	
6.	 Enter Ceiling Ht. and press the Tab key again.
	
7.	 Enter Area, press the Tab key, and enter Remarks.
	
8.	 Click Close Text Editor in the Text Editor tab’s Close panel.
You have the column headings in place. Now you need to do a little extra formatting. In step 5,  
you left three cells blank because four of the columns will be combined under one heading: the 
Finish heading covers the Floor, Base, Wall, and Ceiling columns. Next, you’ll combine the blank 
cells with the Finish heading:
	
1.	 Click in the center of the cell with the Finish label to select it.
	
2.	 Shift+click in the third cell to the right of the Finish cell to select all four cells (see Figure 10.9).
Figure 10.9
Select a group of 
four cells.
	
3.	 Right-click in the selected cells, and choose Merge ➢ All. The four selected cells merge 
into a single cell with the word Finish.

348  | CHAPTER 10  Using Fields and Tables  
Now you need to add the subheads under the Finish header:
	
1.	 Double-click in the leftmost cell below the Finish cell. The Text Editor tab appears in the 
Ribbon (see Figure 10.10).
Figure 10.10
Double-click 
this cell and the 
Text Editor tab 
appears.
	
2.	 Enter Floor, and press the Tab key.
	
3.	 Enter Base, Wall, and Ceiling in each of the following columns as you’ve been doing. 
Remember that the Tab key advances you to the next cell to the right. Your table should 
look like Figure 10.11.
Figure 10.11
The table so far
	
4.	 Click Close Text Editor in the Text Editor tab’s Close panel.
Adjusting Table Text Orientation and Location
You now have the basic layout of the table, with one difference: The Floor, Base, Wall, and 
Ceiling labels that you just added are oriented horizontally, but you want them oriented verti-
cally, as shown earlier in Figure 10.6. The following steps will show you how to rotate a set of 
labels in a table so that they appear in the orientation that you want:
	
1.	 Click in the cell labeled Floor to select it. The Table Cell tab appears in the Ribbon.
	
2.	 Shift+click in the cell labeled Ceiling to select all four of the cells below the Finish heading. 
The combined cells have four grips, one on each side of the group.

Adding Tables to Your Drawing |  349  
	
3.	 Click the grip at the bottom of the selected group, and move it down about four rows. 
At this point, the entire table will be highlighted, but you will affect only the cells you 
selected. Click to “fix” the row height in place. The entire row becomes taller. This 
provides room for the text when you rotate it.
	
4.	 Right-click in the selected cells, and choose Properties from the context menu to open the 
Properties palette.
	
5.	 In the Properties palette, click the Text Rotation box under the Content group.
	
6.	 Enter 90↵ for a 90° rotation of the text. The text rotates into a vertical orientation.
	
7.	 Close the Properties palette.
With the text in this orientation, the columns are too wide, so you’ll change the cell width 
for the selected cells.
	
8.	 Move the right grip to the left to decrease the width of the cells.
	
9.	 For the final touch, you’ll center the text in the cells. With the cells still selected, right-
click in the selected cells, and choose Alignment ➢ Bottom Center. The text becomes 
centered in the cells and aligned at the bottom of the cells.

350  | CHAPTER 10  Using Fields and Tables  
In the previous exercise, you learned how you could adjust the text orientation through the 
Properties palette. You can also adjust the width of cells through the Properties palette. Or, if 
you prefer, you can adjust the width of multiple cells by adjusting the grip location of selected 
cells.
Now continue to add text to the cells and adjust their sizes:
	
1.	 Double-click in the cell in the Number column just below the row that contains the Floor, 
Base, Wall, and Ceiling cells. A text cursor appears in the cell, and the Text Editor tab 
appears in the Ribbon.
	
2.	 Enter 110, and press ↵. Instead of advancing to the next cell to the right, you advance to 
the next cell below.
	
3.	 Enter 111, and press ↵ again. Continue to enter each room number in this way until you 
reach room number 117. When you’ve finished entering the room numbers, click Close 
Text Editor in the Text Editor tab’s Close panel.
Next, you’ll reduce the width of the column to fit the text a bit better.
	
4.	 Click in the cell with the Number text label. It’s the first column heading in the table.
	
5.	 Shift+click in the bottom cell of the Number column to select the entire column.
	
6.	 Click the grip to the left of the column, and move the grip to the right so that the column 
width is approximately half the width of the Room column. You can zoom in on the 
column to allow more control over the positioning of the grip.
	
7.	 Press Esc to exit the selection and view your table so far (see Figure 10.12).
Setting Margins with the Properties Palette
You can also control the margin between the text and the cell border by using the Cell Margin 
options in the Properties palette. Select a group of cells in the table, right-click, and choose 
Properties. In the Properties palette, click the Vertical Cell Margin option or the Horizontal Cell 
Margin option in the Cell group.
Figure 10.12

columns resized

Editing the Table Line Work |  351  
Now, suppose that you want to delete one of the extra rows of cells at the bottom of the table 
or add a new row. Here’s how:
	
1.	 Click the bottom-left cell of the table to select it.
	
2.	 Right-click, and choose Rows ➢ Delete from the context menu. The row disappears.
	
3.	 To add a row, select a cell, right-click, and choose Rows ➢ Insert Above or Rows ➢ Insert 
Below, depending on where you want the new row. (You don’t have to do this last step.)
You may notice the Delete Columns and Insert Columns options in the context menu that 
let you add or delete columns. These options function in a way that’s similar to how the Delete 
Rows and Insert Rows options function. You can also use the tools in the Rows and Columns 
panels of the contextual Table Cell tab to insert and delete rows and columns.
Editing the Table Line Work
So far, you’ve concentrated on how you can format text and cells in a table, but you’ll also want 
some control over the lines in the table. Typically, heavier lines are used around the border of 
the table and between the title and the rest of the table.
Selecting a cell, right-clicking, and selecting Borders from the context menu option lets you 
modify the outline of the border. When you select this option, the Cell Border Properties dialog 
box opens (see Figure 10.13).
Figure 10.13
Setting border 
properties

352  | CHAPTER 10  Using Fields and Tables  
You can use this dialog box to fine-tune the appearance of the line work of the table. Try the 
following exercise to see how this dialog box works:
	
1.	 Make sure that you do not have a cell selected, and then turn on the display of lineweights 
by typing LW↵.
	
2.	 In the Lineweight Settings dialog box, select the Display Lineweight setting and then 
click OK.
	
3.	 Click in the title cell at the top of the table to select the cell, and then right-click and 
choose Borders to open the Cell Border Properties dialog box.
	
4.	 Click the Lineweight drop-down list, and select 0.30 mm.
	
5.	 Click the Outside Borders button that appears just above the preview panel to tell 
AutoCAD to change the borders of the cell to the selected lineweight (see Figure 10.14).
Figure 10.14
Click to display 
outside borders.
	
6.	 Click OK. The title cell is now outlined in a heavier line. To see it clearly, press the Esc key.
You can also adjust the lineweights of the borders that encircle a group of cells, as demonstrated 
in the following exercise:
	
1.	 Click the cell in the upper-left corner with the Number label.
	
2.	 Shift+click the cell in the lower-right corner of the table so that all of the cells from the 
second-from-the-top row down are selected.
	
3.	 Right-click and choose Borders.
	
4.	 Select 0.30 mm from the Lineweight drop-down list. Then click the Outside Borders button 
as you did in step 5 of the previous exercise.
	
5.	 Click OK. The outlines of the selected cells are given the new lineweight setting (see 
Figure 10.15).

Changing the Background Color
In addition to the table borders, you can change the background color for the cells of the table using 
the Table Cell Background Color drop-down list in the Cell Styles panel of the contextual Table Cell 
tab, which appears when a cell, or range of cells, is selected. You can also use the Background Fill 
option in the Properties palette to set cell background colors.
The Cell Border Properties dialog box also lets you set the line colors by selecting a color 
from the Color drop-down list before selecting an Apply To option. In addition, there are several 
other buttons around the preview panel (see Figure 10.16) that let you select the lines that are 
affected by the Cell Border Properties settings.

You can also use the preview panel to select individual borders by clicking the sample border 
in the preview panel. The sample changes to show you which border lines are affected.
Adding Formulas to Cells
In the beginning of this chapter, we mentioned that you can include formulas in cells of 
AutoCAD tables. This can be a great time-saver because you can set up a table with quantities 
that automatically adjust to changes in values in individual cells. You don’t have to calculate the 
changes manually.
You may recall that formulas are a type of field and that a field can be linked with objects in a 
drawing so that the field displays the linked object’s properties. The formula field can be linked 
to several numeric text values.
Although fields are the tools you use for formulas, you don’t have to choose deliberately to 
add a field to a cell every time that you want to add a formula. The exercise in the following sec-
tion will demonstrate how you can add a formula by typing directly in a cell. AutoCAD takes 
care of converting your input into a field.
Using Formulas Directly in Cells
The simplest way to add a formula to a cell is to double-click the cell and then, when the Text 
Editor tab appears in the Ribbon, enter the formula directly in the cell with the addition of an = 
(equal sign) at the beginning. Try the following exercise to see how it works:
	
1.	 Open the FieldSample.dwg file.
	
2.	 Double-click in the cell, as shown in Figure 10.17, to select the location for your formula.
Figure 10.17
Selecting the cell 
for your formula
Double-click
this cell.
	
3.	 Enter =A2+D4 in the cell to add the values in cell A2 and cell D4.
	
4.	 Press ↵ after you enter the formula. The value of A2 plus D4 appears in the cell (see 
Figure 10.18).
Figure 10.18
The cell with the 
sum of two other 
cells
In step 3, the equal sign tells AutoCAD to convert the text into a formula field. You may have 
noticed that when you start to edit a cell in a table, the row and column labels appear along the 
top and left side of the table. You can use these labels to determine the cell addresses for your 
formula.

Adding Formulas to Cells |  355  
In typical spreadsheet fashion, you can change the formula in a cell at any time. Double-click 
the cell containing the formula, and then edit the formula values and operators.
You can also use the Formula drop-down list from the Table Cell tab’s Insert panel to select 
from a set of predefined math operations (see Figure 10.19).
Figure 10.19
The Formula drop-down 
list in the Insert panel
Click in the cell where you want to place the formula; then in the Table Cell tab, click the 
Formula drop-down list in the Insert panel and select the operation that you want to use. Next, 
place a selection window around the cells that you want to include in the formula. Click in the 
first cell that you want to include in the formula, and then click in the second cell. As you do 
this, a selection window appears. All of the cells that are included in the selection window are 
included in the formula.
Using Other Math Operations
In the previous exercise, you used the plus sign to add the value of two cells. You can string 
together several cells’ addresses to add multiple cells as follows:
=A2+A3+A4...
You can also subtract, multiply, or divide by using the – (subtract or minus), * (multiply or 
asterisk), or / (divide) signs. To perform multiple operations on several cells, you can group 
operations within parentheses in a way similar to how you would do it in a typical spreadsheet 
formula. For example, if you want to add two cells together and then multiply their sum by 
another cell, use the following format:
=(A2+A3)*A4
The Average, Sum, and Count buttons that appear in the Formula flyout on the Table Cell tab’s 
Insert panel give you quick access to these frequently used functions. You can add to a cell the 
average value of a set of cells, the sum of a set of cells, or the count of the number of cells. When you 
click one of these options after selecting a cell, you’re prompted to select several cells with a selec-
tion window. Once you’ve selected a set of cells, you see the appropriate formula in the currently 
selected cell. Clicking the Average button, for example, produces a formula similar to the following:
=Average(A1:B5)
Clicking the Sum button produces a formula like this one:
=Sum(A1:B5)

356  | CHAPTER 10  Using Fields and Tables  
In both cases, a range of cells is indicated by a colon, as in A1:B5. You can use this format 
when entering formulas manually. You can also include a single cell with a range by using a 
comma:
=Sum(A1:B5,C6)
Importing and Exporting Tables
Data of the kind found in tables is often shared with others who may not be AutoCAD users. For 
this reason, you’ll want to be able to move table data to and from your drawing to other applica-
tions so that it can be viewed and edited by others. AutoCAD offers the following methods for 
importing and exporting tables.
Importing a Table
Frequently, tables are created outside AutoCAD in a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft 
Excel. You can import an Excel worksheet as an AutoCAD table by using the AutoCAD Entities 
option in the Paste Special feature. The ability to import tables lets non-AutoCAD users create 
the table data while you concentrate on the drawing.
Try the following exercise to see how you can import a table from a worksheet:
	
1.	 Open a new drawing; then open the Excel worksheet called 10a-plan.xls and highlight 
the door data, as shown in Figure 10.20. You may see a security message in Excel. If you 
do, go ahead and close it.
Figure 10.20
Selecting the 
door data in the 
10a-plan.xls 
spreadsheet
	
2.	 Right-click and select Copy to place a copy of the selected data into the Windows 
Clipboard, and then switch back to AutoCAD.

Importing and Exporting Tables |  357  
	
4.	 With the Paste radio button selected, click AutoCAD Entities in the list and then click OK.
	
5.	 At the Specify insertion point or [paste as Text]: prompt, click a point in the 
lower-right area of the drawing. The worksheet data appears in the drawing as a table.
If the text is difficult to read because of a dark drawing area background, you can change the 
background color of the table to white.
	
1.	 Select all the cells of the table by selecting cell 1A and then Shift+clicking cell 17G. Note 
that the Table Cell tab appears automatically in the ribbon.
	
2.	 In the Table Cell tab’s Cell Style panel, select white from the Table Cell Background Color 
drop-down list.
In this exercise, you imported the worksheet by using the default standard table style. This 
gives you a simple-looking table using the AutoCAD Txt font. You can set up a custom table 
style, as described later in this chapter, with the fonts and borders that you want and then 
import the table for a more customized appearance. Make sure that your custom table style is 
the current style before you import the worksheet.
Figure 10.21

Adding Graphics to Table Cells
One of the most interesting features of the Table tool is its ability to include blocks in a cell. This 
ability can be useful if you want to include graphic elements in your table. Adding a block to a cell 
is a simple process. Here are the steps:
	1.	 Click in a cell to select it.
	2.	 Right-click, and choose Insert ➢ Block from the context menu to open the Insert A Block In A Table 
Cell dialog box.
	
3.	 Choose Paste Special from the Paste flyout on the Home tab’s Clipboard panel (see 
Figure 10.21) to open the Paste Special dialog box. If you don’t see the Clipboard panel, 
enter PASTESPEC↵.
continues

358  | CHAPTER 10  Using Fields and Tables  
	3.	 Select a block name from the Name drop-down list. You can also click the button to the right of 
the list to open the Select Drawing File dialog box, which lets you select a drawing file for import 
to the cell.
	4.	 After you’ve selected a block and specified the settings in the Properties group of the dialog box, 
click OK. The block appears in the cell that you’ve selected.
The dialog box enables you to specify the alignment (Overall Cell Alignment) and size (Scale) of 
the inserted block. By default, the AutoFit option is turned on. This option adjusts the size of the 
block to make it fit in the current cell size.
Exporting Tables
You might want to export your AutoCAD table to a spreadsheet program or database. You can 
do this using a somewhat hidden option in a context menu. Follow these steps:
	
1.	 Select the entire table. You can do so by clicking in a spot above and to the right of the 
table. With the crossing selection window, completely enclose the table and click.
	
2.	 Right-click anywhere in the table, and choose Export from the context menu to open the 
Export Data dialog box.
	
3.	 Specify a name and location for your exported table data, and click Save.
The file is saved with a .csv filename extension. This type of file is comma delimited and 
can be read by most spreadsheet programs, including Excel. Unfortunately, the CSV file doesn’t 
retain the AutoCAD table formatting.
To open the exported file from Excel, choose File ➢ Open in the Excel menu bar; then, in the 
Open dialog box, select Text Files (*.prn, *.txt, *.csv) in the Files Of Type drop-down list. You can 
then locate the exported table and open it.
continued

Creating Table Styles |  359  
Creating Table Styles
If you find that you’re creating the same table layout over and over, you can set up predefined 
table styles. You can set up the properties of the title, column headings, and data in advance so 
that you don’t have to set them up each time you create a table. For example, if you prefer to use 
Arial bold at 0.25″ for the title and standard Arial at 0.125″ for the column headings, you can cre-
ate a table style with those settings. The next time you need to create a table, you can select your 
custom table style and specify the number of columns and rows; then you’ll be ready to add the 
data without having to format the text.
Adding or Modifying a Table Style
The method that you use to create a table style in AutoCAD is similar to the method used to 
modify an existing one.
To create a table style, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click Table Style in the Home tab’s expanded Annotation panel to open the Table Style 
dialog box.
You can also select the Table Style tool from the Annotate tab’s Tables panel title bar. The 
Table Style tool is the arrowhead at the right end of the Tables panel title bar. You see the 
Standard table style in the Styles list box (see Figure 10.22). This is the one you used in  
the previous exercises.
Figure 10.22
The Table Style  
dialog box
	
2.	 Click the New button to open the Create New Table Style dialog box. This is where you 
give your new table style a name.
	
3.	 Enter My Table Style, and click Continue to open the New Table Style dialog box (see 
Figure 10.23).

360  | CHAPTER 10  Using Fields and Tables  
	
4.	 You’ll learn more about the options in this dialog box next. For now, click OK to close the 
dialog box.
	
5.	 Your new table style now appears in the Styles list of the Table Style dialog box. If you 
want to edit an existing table style, you can select the style from the list and click the 
Modify button. The Modify Table Style dialog box will appear, enabling you to edit the 
existing style. The Modify Table Style dialog box is identical to the New Table Style dialog 
box shown in Figure 10.23.
	
6.	 Click Close to exit the dialog box.
After you’ve created a style, you can select it from the Table Style group of the Insert Table dia-
log box that you used to create the sample table (see Figure 10.24). To open the Insert Table dialog 
box, click Table in the Home tab’s Annotation panel.

The Bottom Line |  361  
You can also open the New Table Style dialog box by clicking the Launch The Table 
Style Dialog button just to the right of the Table Style drop-down list in the Insert Table 
dialog box.
The Table Style Options
Let’s take a closer look at the New Table Style dialog box, shown earlier in Figure 10.23. It may 
seem a bit bewildering at first, but once you take the time to explore the parts of this dialog box, 
it’s fairly straightforward. The following offers a description of the parts of the New Table Style 
dialog box by group:
Starting Table    Typically, you can set up a new table style using the settings in the other 
groups of this dialog box, but the Starting Table group gives you the ability to use an existing 
table in the drawing as the basis for your new table style. This can be helpful if you’ve already 
done some work formatting a table in your drawing. This group includes two buttons. The one 
on the left lets you select an existing table in the drawing for your new style. If you click this 
button, the dialog box closes temporarily to allow you to select a table in your drawing. The 
button on the right removes your in-drawing table selection and reverts to the settings in the 
dialog box.
General    The General group offers only one setting: the direction for the table. Typically, 
you’ll use the Down option, which means that the table reads from top to bottom. If for some 
reason you need a table with titles at the bottom, choose the Up option.
Cell Styles    You have a high degree of control over the appearance of individual cells 
through the cell styles. By default, your new table style will have three cell styles, called Data, 
Header, and Title. You can select these cell styles from the drop-down list at the top of the 
Cell Styles group. You can then edit the selected style using the three tabs below the drop-
down list. Here are brief descriptions of the function of each tab:
General    The General tab gives you control over the fill color, alignment, format, and 
type of information presented in the cell. The Margins options control the margins in the 
cell. The Merge Cells On Row/Column Creation option at the bottom of the General tab 
causes the cells to merge into a single cell for the selected cell style.
Text    The Text tab gives you control over the default text style, the height and color, and 
the angle of the text in the cell.
Borders    The Borders tab lets you control the lineweight for the borders of the cell.
You can also create your own cell style using the two buttons to the right of the Cell Styles 
drop-down list. The left button lets you create a new cell style. The button on the right lets 
you create, rename, or delete a cell style through the Manage Cell Styles dialog box.
Cell Style Preview    This window gives you a preview of what the cell style will look like 
with the settings you make in the tabs of the Cell Styles group. This preview changes in real 
time as you change the settings in the General, Text, or Borders tab.

Using Dimensions 
Before you determine the dimensions of a project, your design is in flux and many questions 
may be unanswered. After you begin dimensioning, you’ll start to see whether things fit or 
work together. Dimensioning can be crucial to how well a design works and how quickly it 
develops. The dimensions answer questions about code conformance if you’re an architect; 
they answer questions about tolerances, fit, and interference if you’re involved in mechanical 
applications. After you and your design team reach a design on a schematic level, communi-
cating even tentative dimensions to others on the team can accelerate design development. 
Dimensions represent a point from which you can develop your ideas further.
With the AutoCAD® 2017 software, you can easily add tentative or final dimensions to 
any drawing. AutoCAD gives you an accurate dimension without your having to take mea-
surements. You pick the two points to be dimensioned and the dimension line location, and 
AutoCAD does the rest. The associative dimensioning capability of AutoCAD automatically 
updates dimensions whenever the size or shape of the dimensioned object changes. These 
dimensioning features can save you valuable time and reduce the number of dimensional errors 
in your drawings.

Understanding the Components of a Dimension
Before you start the exercises in this chapter, it will help to know the names of the parts of a 
dimension. Figure 11.1 shows a sample of a dimension with the parts labeled. The dimension 
line is the line that represents the distance being dimensioned. It’s the horizontal line with the 

364  | CHAPTER 11  Using Dimensions   
diagonal tick marks on either end. The extension lines are the lines that originate from the object 
being dimensioned. They show you the exact location from which the dimension is taken. The 
dimension text is the dimension value, usually shown inside or above the dimension line.

Another component of a dimension line is the dimension line extension. This is the part of the 
dimension line that extends beyond the extension line. Dimension line extensions are usually 
used only on architectural dimensions. The extension lines typically extend beyond the dimen-
sion lines in all types of dimensions. The extension line offset from origin is the distance from the 
beginning of the extension line to the object being dimensioned. The extension beyond dimension 
line is the distance the dimension line extends past the extension line.
You can control each of these components by creating or editing dimension styles. Dimension 
styles are the settings that determine the look of your dimensions. You can store multiple styles in 
a single drawing. The first exercise in this chapter will show you how to create a dimension style.
Dimensioning Standards
In addition to the components of a dimension, you should know about the standards that govern 
the placement and style of dimensions in a drawing. Each industry has a different set of standards 
for text size, text style, arrow style, dimension placement, and general dimensioning methods. 
These issues are beyond the scope of this book; however, we urge you to become familiar with the 
standards associated with your industry. Many resources are available to you if you want to find 
out more about dimension standards. Here are a few resources on the subject:

Engineers (ASME) website: www.asme.org.

Creating a Dimension Style
Dimension styles are similar to text styles. They determine the look of your dimensions as well 
as the size of dimensioning features, such as the dimension text and arrows. You can set up 
a dimension style to have special types of arrows, for instance, or to position the dimension

text above or in line with the dimension line. Dimension styles also make your work easier by 
enabling you to store and duplicate your most common dimension settings.
AutoCAD gives you one of two default dimension styles, ISO-25 or Standard, depending 
on whether you use the metric or Imperial (also called English) measurement system. You’ll 
probably add many other styles to suit the types of drawings you’re creating. You can also 
create variations of a general style for those situations that call for only minor changes in the 
dimension’s appearance.
In this section, you’ll learn how to set up your own dimension style based on the Standard 
dimension style (see Figure 11.2). For metric users, the settings are different, but the overall 
methods are the same.

Follow these steps to create a dimension style:
	
1.	 Open the 11a-unit.dwg file and rename it Unit.dwg. Metric users should open 
11a-unit-metric.dwg and rename it Unit.dwg. These files are the same as the Unit.dwg 
file that you used in the previous chapter before the exercises.
	
2.	 Choose Zoom Extents from the Zoom flyout in the Navigation bar or type Z↵E↵ to display 
the entire floor plan.
	
3.	 Click the Dimension Style tool on the Annotate tab’s Dimensions panel title bar. You can 
also choose the Dimension Style tool from the Home tab’s expanded Annotation panel (it 
looks like a dimension with a paintbrush) or type D↵ at the Command prompt to open 
the Dimension Style Manager.
	
4.	 Select Standard from the Styles list box. Metric users should select ISO-25 (see Figure 11.3).

366  | CHAPTER 11  Using Dimensions   
	
5.	 Click New to open the Create New Dimension Style dialog box (see Figure 11.4).

6.	 With the Copy of Standard or ISO-25 name highlighted in the New Style Name box, enter 
My Architectural.
	
7.	 Click Continue to open the detailed New Dimension Style dialog box (see Figure 11.5).
You’ve just created a dimension style called My Architectural, but at this point it’s identical 
to the Standard style on which it’s based. Nothing has happened to the Standard style; it’s still 
available if you need to use it.

Figure 11.5
The New Dimension 
Style dialog box
Setting Up the Primary Unit Style
Now you need to set up your new dimension style so that it conforms to the U.S. architectural 
style of dimensioning. Let’s start by changing the unit style for the dimension text. Just as you 
changed the overall unit style of AutoCAD to a feet-and-inches style for your bath drawing in 
Chapter 3, “Setting Up and Using the Drafting Tools,” you must change your dimension styles. 
Setting the overall unit style doesn’t automatically set the dimension unit style. Follow these steps:
	
1.	 In the New Dimension Style dialog box, click the Primary Units tab (see Figure 11.6).
Figure 11.6
The Primary Units 
options

368  | CHAPTER 11  Using Dimensions   
	
2.	 In the Linear Dimensions group, open the Unit Format drop-down list and choose 
Architectural. Notice that this drop-down list contains the same unit styles as the main 
Drawing Units dialog box (choose Drawing Utilities ➢ Units from the Application 
menu), with the addition of the Windows Desktop option. Metric users can skip this 
option.
Using Commas or Periods for Decimals
The Decimal Separator option, which is found a few settings below the Unit Format option, 
lets you choose between a period and a comma for decimal points. Metric users often use the 
comma for a decimal point, and U.S. users use a period. This option doesn’t have any meaning 
for measurements other than decimal, so it’s dimmed when the Architectural unit format is 
selected.
	
3.	 Select 0′-0 1⁄4″ from the Precision drop-down list, just below the Unit Format list. 
Metric users should select 0.00. The Precision option enables you to set the level of 
precision that is displayed in the dimension text. It doesn’t limit the precision of the 
AutoCAD drawing database. This value is used to limit only the display of dimension 
text values.
	
4.	 Just below the Precision drop-down list, open the Fraction Format drop-down list and 
select Diagonal. Notice what happens to the graphic: The fractional dimensions change 
to show how your dimension text will look. Metric users can skip this step because it isn’t 
available when the Decimal unit format is selected.
	
5.	 In the Zero Suppression group in the lower-left corner, click 0 Inches to deselect this check 
box. If you leave it turned on, indications of 0 inches will be omitted from the dimension 
text. (In architectural drawings, 0 inches are shown as in this dimension: 12′-0″.) Metric 
users can ignore this option.
If you use the Imperial measurement system, you’ve set up My Architectural’s dimension 
unit style to show dimensions in feet and inches, the standard method for U.S. construction 
documents. Metric users have changed the Precision value and have kept the Decimal unit 
system.
Setting the Height for Dimension Text
Along with the unit style, you should adjust the size of the dimension text. The Text tab of the 
New Dimension Style dialog box lets you set a variety of text options, including text location 
relative to the dimension line, style, and height.
Follow these steps to set the height of your dimension text:
	
1.	 Click the Text tab to display the text options (see Figure 11.7).

Creating a Dimension Style |  369  
	
2.	 Highlight the contents of the Text Height box.
	
3.	 The Text Height box can accept typed values, or you can use the up and down arrows 
on the right side of the input to increase or decrease the value. Press the down arrow to 
reach the 1⁄8″ setting. Metric users should enter 0.3↵ for the text height.
Unlike with the text you created in Chapter 9, “Adding Text to Drawings,” you specify 
dimension text height by its final plot size. You then specify an overall dimension scale factor 
that affects the sizing of all dimensioning settings, such as text and arrows.
If you want to use a specific text style for your dimensions, select a text style in the Text Style 
drop-down list in the Text tab. If the style you select happens to have a height specification 
greater than 0, that height will override any text height settings that you enter in the Text tab.
Setting the Location and Orientation of Dimension Text
The default AutoCAD setting for the placement of dimension text puts the text in line with the 
dimension line, as shown in the example at the top of Figure 11.2 earlier in this chapter. Suppose 
that you want the new My Architectural style to put the text above the dimension line instead, 
as shown in the second example in Figure 11.2. To do that, you’ll use the Text Placement and 
Text Alignment group options in the Text tab of the New Dimension Style dialog box:
	
1.	 In the Text Alignment group in the lower-right corner of the dialog box, click the Aligned 
With Dimension Line radio button.
	
2.	 In the Text Placement group, open the Vertical drop-down list and select Above. The 
appearance of the sample image changes to show how your new settings will look.
Figure 11.7
The Text options

370  | CHAPTER 11  Using Dimensions   
	
3.	 Again in the Text Placement group, change the Offset From Dim Line value to 1⁄16″. 
Metric users can leave this setting at 0.624. This setting controls the size of the gap 
between the dimension line and the dimension text.
Offset from dim line
Each time you change a setting, the graphic gives you immediate feedback about how your 
changes will affect your dimension style.
Choosing an Arrow Style and Setting the Dimension Scale
Next you’ll specify a different type of arrow for your new dimension style. For linear dimensions 
in architectural drawings, a diagonal line, or tick mark, is typically used instead of an arrow.
In addition, you want to set the scale for the graphical components of the dimension, such as 
the arrows and text. Recall from Chapter 9 that text must be scaled up in order to appear at the 
proper size in the final output of the drawing. Dimensions too must be scaled so that they look 
correct when the drawing is plotted. The arrows are controlled by settings in the Symbols And 
Arrows tab, and the overall scale of the dimension style is set in the Fit tab.
Here are the steps for specifying the arrow type and scale:
	
1.	 Click the Symbols And Arrows tab to display the options for controlling the arrow style 
and dimension line extensions (see Figure 11.8).
Figure 11.8
The Symbols And 
Arrows options

Creating a Dimension Style |  371  
	
2.	 In the Arrowheads group, open the First drop-down list and choose Architectural Tick. 
The graphic next to the arrowhead name shows you what the arrowhead looks like. Note 
that the Second drop-down list automatically changes to Architectural Tick to maintain 
symmetry on the dimension.
	
3.	 In the Arrowheads group, change the Arrow Size setting to 1⁄8″. Metric users should enter 0.3.
Next you need to set the behavior of the dimension line and extension lines:
	
1.	 Click the Lines tab to display the options for controlling the dimension and extension 
lines (see Figure 11.9).
Figure 11.9
The options for con-
trolling the dimension 
and extension lines
	
2.	 In the Dimension Lines group, highlight the value in the Extend Beyond Ticks box and 
change the value to 1/16. (Metric users should enter 0.15.) This causes the dimension lines 
to extend past the tick arrows. This is a standard graphic practice used for dimensioning 
linear dimensions in architectural plans.
Dimension line extension

372  | CHAPTER 11  Using Dimensions   
	
3.	 In the Extension Lines group, change the Extend Beyond Dim Lines setting to 1⁄8″. Metric 
users should change this to 0.3. This setting determines the distance the extension line 
extends past the dimension line.
Extend beyond dimension line
	
4.	 Again in the Extension Lines group, change the Offset From Origin setting to 1⁄8″. Metric 
users should change this to 0.3. This sets the distance from the point being dimensioned 
to the beginning of the dimension extension line.
Offset from origin
	
5.	 Click the Fit tab of the New Dimension Style dialog box to display the options for overall 
dimension scale and miscellaneous settings (see Figure 11.10).
	
6.	 Turn on the Annotative option in the Scale For Dimension Features group. You may recall 
from Chapter 9 that the Annotative option allows AutoCAD to scale an object automati-
cally to the drawing’s annotation scale.
	
7.	 Click OK to close the New Dimension Style dialog box. The Dimension Style Manager 
appears again.

Scale for Dimensions in Legacy Drawings
Drawings created prior to AutoCAD 2008 relied on scale factors to determine the scaling of dimen-
sions. Because it’s likely that you’ll run into legacy drawing files, here is some information about 
the settings used for those earlier dimensions.
Instead of the Annotative option, the Use Overall Scale Of option is used in the Scale For Dimension 
Features group. You select the Use Overall Scale Of radio button and enter a drawing scale factor 
in the Use Overall Scale Of box.
All of the values that you enter for the options in the New Dimension Style dialog box are multi-
plied by this Use Overall Scale Of value to obtain the final size of the dimension components. For 
example, the text height that you entered earlier, 1⁄8″, is multiplied by 48 for a dimension text 
height of 6″. For metric users, the text height of 0.3 is multiplied by 50 for a text height of 15 cm. 
For more on the scaling of text and other objects in AutoCAD, see Chapter 3.
Using the Layout Viewport Scale for Dimensions
If you use the Scale Dimensions To Layout option in the Scale For Dimension Features group of the 
Fit tab, AutoCAD uses the layout viewport scale to size the dimension components. See Chapter 8, 
“Introducing Printing, Plotting, and Layouts,” for more information about viewport scale settings. 
The Scale Dimension To Layout option can be useful if you have a drawing that you want to print 
at multiple scales.

3.	 Click the Display Alternate Units check box. The options in the tab become available for 
your input.
	
4.	 Select the appropriate option from the Unit Format drop-down list. Imperial users should 
select Decimal to show metric alternate units. Metric users should select Architectural.
	
5.	 Select an appropriate precision value from the Precision drop-down list.
	
6.	 Enter a scale factor for your alternate dimension in the Multiplier For Alt Units box. For 
Imperial users, the default value is 25.4. This value converts feet-and-inch dimensions to

Setting Up Alternate Units
You can use the Alternate Units tab of the New Dimension Style dialog box to set up AutoCAD 
to display a second dimension in centimeters or millimeters. Likewise, if you’re a metric user, 
you can set up a second dimension to display feet and inches. The following exercise shows you 
how to set up alternate dimensions. You don’t have to do this exercise now; it’s here for your infor-
mation. If you like, come back later and try it to see how it affects your dimensions. You can pick 
up the exercise in the next section, “Setting the Current Dimension Style.”
If you decide later that you don’t want the alternate units to be displayed, you can turn them 
off by returning to the Modify Dimension Style dialog box and removing the check mark from 
the Display Alternate Units check box.
Here are the steps for setting up alternate dimensions:
	
1.	 In the Dimension Style Manager, select a style and then click Modify. Or, if you want to 
create a new style, click New.
	
2.	 In the Modify Dimension Style dialog box, click the Alternate Units tab (see Figure 11.11). This 
is virtually identical to the New Dimension Style dialog box with which you’ve been working.

Fitting Text and Arrows in Tight Places
Every now and then, you’ll need to dimension a small gap or a small part of an object in which 
dimension text won’t fit. The Fit tab includes a few settings (other than the ones with which you’ve 
already worked) that control how dimensions act when the extension lines are too close. The Text 
Placement group contains three options to place the text in tight situations:
Beside The Dimension Line    Places text next to the extension line but close to the dimen-
sion line. You’ll see how this affects your dimension later.
Over Dimension Line, With Leader    Places the dimension text farther from the dimen-
sion line and includes an arrow or a leader from the dimension line to the text.
Over Dimension Line, Without Leader    Does the same as the previous setting, but 
doesn’t include the leader.
The options in the Fit Options group let you control how text and arrows are placed when there 
isn’t enough room for both between the extension lines.
millimeters. In our metric examples, you’ve been using centimeters, so change this set-
ting to 2.54. Metric users should enter 0.3937 to convert centimeters to feet and inches.
	
7.	 In the Placement group, select where you want the alternate dimension to appear in rela-
tion to the main dimension.
	
8.	 You don’t want to display alternate units now, so turn off the Display Alternate Units setting.
	
9.	 Click OK to close the Modify Dimension Style dialog box. The Dimension Style Manager 
appears again.
Setting the Current Dimension Style
Before you can begin to use your new dimension style, you must make it the current default:
	
1.	 Click My Architectural in the Styles list box in the Dimension Style Manager.
	
2.	 Click the Set Current button at the far right.
	
3.	 Click Close to exit the Dimension Style Manager.
You can also select a dimension style from the drop-down list in the Annotate tab’s 
Dimensions panel or the Home tab’s expanded Annotation panel. You’re now ready to use your 
new dimension style.
In the next set of exercises, you’ll use the My Architectural style that you just created. To 
switch to another style, open the Dimension Style Manager again, select the style you want from 
the Styles list, and click Set Current, as you did in the previous exercise.
Modifying a Dimension Style
To modify an existing dimension style, open the Dimension Style Manager dialog box, high-
light the style that you want to edit, and then click Modify to open the Modify Dimension Style 
dialog box. You can then make changes to the various components of the selected dimension 
style. When you’ve finished making changes and closed both dialog boxes, all of the dimensions

associated with the edited style update automatically in your drawing. For example, if you’re not 
using the Annotative Scale feature and you decide that you need to change the dimension scale 
of a style, you can open the Modify Dimension Style dialog box and change the Use Overall 
Scale Of value in the Scale For Dimension Features group of the Fit tab.
So far, you’ve been introduced to the various settings that let you determine the appearance 
of a dimension style. We haven’t discussed every option; to learn more about the other dimen-
sion style options, consult Bonus Chapter 4. There you’ll find descriptions of all the items in the 
New Dimension Style and Modify Dimension Style dialog boxes, plus reference material cover-
ing the system variables associated with each option.
If your application is strictly architectural, you may want to make these same dimension-
style changes to the acad.dwt template file or create a set of template files specifically for archi-
tectural drawings of different scales.
Drawing Linear Dimensions
The most common type of dimension that you’ll be using is the linear dimension. The linear dimen-
sion is an orthogonal dimension measuring the width and length of an object. AutoCAD provides 
three dimensioning tools for this purpose: Linear (Dimlinear), Continue (Dimcont), and Baseline 
(Dimbase). These options are readily accessible from the Annotate tab’s Dimensions panel.
In the following set of exercises, you’ll see figures displaying dimensions in both Imperial 
and metric units. We’ve included both measurements so that both Imperial and metric users can 
more easily follow the exercise. But in your own drawing, you’ll see only one dimension value 
displayed above the dimension line.
Understanding the Dimensions Panel
Before you apply any dimension, you should study the Annotate tab’s Dimensions panel 
(see Figure 11.12). This panel contains nearly all of the tools necessary to draw and edit your 
dimensions.

Selecting Options from the Dimension Flyout
As an introduction to dimensions, you’ll be selecting options from the flyout on the bottom row 
of the Dimensions panel. This flyout starts out showing the Linear tool, but since the flyout name 
changes depending on the last tool selected, we’ll refer to this flyout as the Dimension flyout. You’ll 
learn about the larger Dimension tool later in this chapter.
Selecting Objects to Be Dimensioned
The prompt in step 3 gives you the option of pressing ↵ to select an object. If you do this, you’re 
prompted to pick the object that you want to dimension rather than the distance to be dimensioned. 
This method is discussed later in this chapter.
Many of the dimensioning tools discussed in this chapter can be found in the Home tab’s 
Annotation panel. However, since the focus of this chapter is on dimensioning, unless other-
wise noted, use the panels on the Annotate tab.
Placing Horizontal and Vertical Dimensions
Let’s start by looking at the basic dimensioning tool, Linear. The Linear button (the Dimlinear 
command) on the Annotate tab’s Dimensions panel accommodates both the horizontal and ver-
tical dimensions.
In this exercise, you’ll add a vertical dimension to the right side of the unit plan:
	
1.	 Before you start to dimension your drawing, you need to set its scale. Select 1/4″= 1′-0″ 
from the Annotation Scale drop-down list. Metric users should select 1:50.
	
2.	 To start either a vertical or horizontal dimension, choose Linear from the Dimension fly-
out in the Annotate tab’s Dimensions panel, or enter DLI↵ at the Command prompt.
	
3.	 The Specify first extension line origin or <select object>: prompt asks you 
for the first point of the distance to be dimensioned. An extension line connects the object 
being dimensioned to the dimension line. Use the Endpoint osnap override, and pick the 
upper-right corner of the entry, as shown in Figure 11.13.
	
4.	 At the Specify second extension line origin: prompt, pick the lower-right corner 
of the living room, as shown in Figure 11.13.

378  | CHAPTER 11  Using Dimensions   
	
5.	 At the next prompt, Specify dimension line location or [Mtext/Text/Angle/
Horizontal/Vertical/Rotated]:, the dimension line indicates the direction of the dimen-
sion and contains the arrows or tick marks. Move your cursor from left to right to display a 
temporary dimension. Doing so enables you to select a dimension-line location visually.

6.	 Enter @4′<0↵ to tell AutoCAD that you want the dimension line to be 4′ to the right of the 
last point that you selected. Metric users should enter @122<0↵. (You could pick a point 
by using your cursor, but this doesn’t let you place the dimension line as accurately.) After 
you’ve done this, the dimension is placed in the drawing as shown in Figure 11.13.
Continuing a Dimension
You’ll often want to enter a group of dimensions strung together in a line. For example, you may 
want to continue dimensioning the balcony and align the continued dimension with the dimen-
sion that you just entered.
To do this, use the Continue option found in the Dimensions panel’s Continue/Baseline 
flyout:
	
1.	 Click the Continue tool on the Dimensions panel, or enter DCO↵.
	
2.	 At the Specify a second extension line origin or [Select/Undo] <Select>: 
prompt, pick the upper-right corner of the balcony. (See the top image in Figure 11.14.)
	
3.	 Pick the right end of the rail on the balcony. See the bottom image in Figure 11.14 for the 
results.
	
4.	 Press ↵ twice to exit the command.
If you select the wrong location for a continued dimension, you can click the Undo tool or 
press U↵ to undo the last dimension.

Pick this corner to 
complete the dimension string.
The Continue option adds a dimension from where you left off. The last-drawn extension line 
is used as the first extension line for the continued dimension. AutoCAD keeps adding dimen-
sions as you continue to pick points, until you press ↵.
You probably noticed that the 5″ dimension is placed away from the dimension line with a 
leader line pointing to it. This is the result of the 5″ dimension’s text not having enough space to 
fit between the dimension extension lines. You’ll learn about dimension style settings that can 
remedy this problem. For now, let’s continue adding dimensions to the plan.
Continuing a Dimension from a Previous Dimension
If you need to continue a string of dimensions from an older linear dimension instead of the 
most recently added one, press ↵ at the Specify a second extension line origin or 

380  | CHAPTER 11  Using Dimensions   
[Select/Undo] <Select>: prompt that you saw in step 2 of the previous exercise. Then, at 
the Select continued dimension: prompt, click the extension line from which you want to 
continue.
Drawing Dimensions from a Common Base Extension Line
Another way to dimension objects is to have several dimensions originate from the same exten-
sion line. To accommodate this, AutoCAD provides the Baseline option on the Dimensions con-
trol panel and the Dimension drop-down menu.
To see how this works, you’ll start another dimension—this time a horizontal one—across 
the top of the plan:
	
1.	 Use the Zoom Realtime and Pan tools in the Navigation bar to adjust your view so that 
you can add dimensions above the bathroom. See the dimensions at the top of the draw-
ing in Figure 11.15 to get an idea of how much space you’ll need.
	
2.	 Click the Linear tool in the Dimension flyout on the Dimensions panel. Or, as you did for 
the vertical dimension, type DLI↵ to start the horizontal dimension.
	
3.	 At the Specify first extension line origin or <select object>: prompt, use the 
Endpoint osnap to pick the upper-left corner of the bathroom, as shown in Figure 11.15.

4.	 At the Specify second extension line origin: prompt, pick the upper-right corner 
of the bathroom, as shown in Figure 11.15.
	
5.	 At the Specify dimension line location or [Mtext/Text/Angle/ Horizontal/
Vertical/Rotated]: prompt, pick a point above the unit plan, like the 7′-6″ dimension 
in Figure 11.15. If you need to, pan your view downward to fit the dimension in.

Drawing Linear Dimensions |  381  
	
6.	 You’re set to draw another dimension continuing from the first extension line of the 
dimension that you just drew. Click the Baseline tool on the Continue/Baseline flyout 
of the Dimensions panel, or type DBA↵ at the Command prompt to start a baseline 
dimension.
	
7.	 At the Specify a second extension line origin or [Select/Undo] <Select>: 
prompt, click the upper-right corner of the entry, as shown in Figure 11.16.
Use Osnaps While Dimensioning
Because you usually pick exact locations on your drawing as you dimension, you may want to 
turn on the Object Snap tool in the status bar to avoid the extra step of selecting osnaps from the 
Osnap context menu.

8.	 Press ↵ twice to exit the Baseline command.
In this example, you see that the Baseline option is similar to the Continue option, except 
that the Baseline option enables you to use the first extension line of the previous dimension 
as the base for a second dimension. The distance between the two horizontal dimension lines 

382  | CHAPTER 11  Using Dimensions   
is controlled by the Baseline Spacing setting in the Lines tab of the New Dimension Style and 
Modify Dimension Style dialog boxes.
Continuing from an Older Dimension
You may have noticed in step 7 that you had to press ↵ twice to exit the command. As with 
Continue, you can draw the baseline dimension from an older dimension by pressing ↵ at the 
Specify a second extension line origin [Select/Undo] <Select>: prompt. You then 
get the Select base dimension: prompt, at which you can either select another dimension or 
press ↵ again to exit the command.
Control the Style Used with Continue or Baseline
A system variable called DIMCONTINUEMODE lets you control the style of a continue or baseline 
dimension. At the Type a Command prompt, enter dimcontinuemode↵1↵ to have the baseline or 
continue dimension use the style of the selected dimension. Type dimcontinuemode↵0↵ to have 
the baseline or continue dimension use the current dimension style.
Adjusting the Distance Between Dimensions
As you work toward a deadline, you may find that you cut a few corners, or someone else does, 
when adding dimensions, and a set of parallel dimension lines isn’t accurately placed.
You can quickly adjust the spacing between dimension lines using the Adjust Space tool in 
the Dimensions panel:
	
1.	 Click the Adjust Space tool in the Dimensions panel or type Dimspace↵.
	
2.	 At the Select base dimension: prompt, click the dimension closest to the feature being 
dimensioned.
	
3.	 At the Select dimensions to space: prompt, click the next dimension.
	
4.	 Continue to select the other parallel dimensions. When you’re finished with your selec-
tions, press ↵.
	
5.	 You see this prompt:
Select dimensions to space:
Enter value or [Auto] <Auto>:
Enter a value for the distance between the dimension lines. This value should be in full-scale dis-
tances. You can also press ↵, and AutoCAD will adjust the distance between dimensions for you.

Editing Dimensions |  383  
Editing Dimensions
As you add more dimensions to your drawings, you’ll find that AutoCAD occasionally places 
the dimension text or line in an inappropriate location or that you may need to modify the 
dimension text. In the following sections, you’ll take an in-depth look at how you can modify 
dimensions to suit those special circumstances that always seem to crop up.
Appending Data to Dimension Text
So far in this chapter, you’ve been accepting the default dimension text. You can append infor-
mation to the default dimension value or change it entirely if you need to do so. At the point 
when you see the temporary dimension dragging with your cursor, enter T↵. Then, using the 
less-than and greater-than (< and >) symbols, you can add text either before or after the default 
dimension, or you can replace the symbols entirely to replace the default text. The Properties 
palette lets you modify the existing dimension text in a similar way (see Chapter 2, “Creating 
Your First Drawing,” for more on the Properties palette). You can open the Properties palette for 
a dimension by selecting the dimension and then right-clicking to open the context menu. Select 
Properties from there.
Let’s see how this works by changing an existing dimension’s text in your drawing:
	
1.	 Type ED↵. This starts the Ddedit command.
	
2.	 Click the last horizontal dimension that you added to the drawing at the top of the 
screen. The Text Editor tab appears in the Ribbon (see Figure 11.17).
Certiﬁcation
Objective
Figure 11.17
The Text Editor tab
	
3.	 Press the End key to place the cursor at the end of the 14′-0″ text, and then type to face of 
stud beginning with a space. The space is included to ensure that the dimension doesn’t 
run into the text.
	
4.	 Click Close Text Editor in the Close panel of the Text Editor tab. The dimension changes 
to read 14′-0″ to face of stud.
	
5.	 Because you don’t need the new appended text for the exercise, click the Undo button in 
the Quick Access toolbar to remove the appended text.

384  | CHAPTER 11  Using Dimensions   
If you need to restore the original dimension text for a dimension whose value has been 
completely replaced, you can use the steps shown in the previous exercise. However, in step 3, 
replace the text with the <> bracket symbols.
Editing Multiple Dimensions
In the exercise where you changed an existing dimension’s text, you were able to edit only a single 
dimension. To append text to several dimensions at once, you need to use the Dimension Edit tool. See 
the sidebar “Making Changes to Multiple Dimensions” later in this chapter for more on this command.
You can also have AutoCAD automatically add a dimension suffix or prefix to all dimensions instead 
of just a chosen few by using the Suffix or Prefix option in the Primary Units tab of the New Dimension 
Style or Modify Dimension Style dialog box. See the Bonus Chapter 4 for more on this feature.
AutoCAD provides the associative dimensioning capability to update dimension text auto-
matically when a drawing is edited. Objects called definition points determine how edited dimen-
sions are updated.
The definition points are located at the same points that you pick when you determine the 
dimension location. For example, the definition points for linear dimensions are the extension 
line origins. The definition points for a circle diameter are the points used to pick the circle and 
the opposite side of the circle. The definition points for a radius are the points used to pick the 
circle plus the center of the circle.
Definition points are point objects. They’re difficult to see because they’re usually covered by 
the feature that they define. You can, however, see them indirectly by using grips. The definition 
points of a dimension are the same as the dimension’s grip points. You can see them by clicking 
a dimension. Try the following:
	
1.	 Make sure that the Grips feature is turned on. (See Chapter 2 to refresh your memory on 
the Grips feature.)
	
2.	 Click the longest of the three vertical dimensions that you drew in the earlier exercise. 
You’ll see the grips of the dimension, which is shown in Figure 11.18.
Figure 11.18
The grip points are the 
same as the definition 
points on a dimension.
Click this grip.

Editing Dimensions |  385  
Using Grips to Make Minor Adjustments to Dimensions
The definition points, whose location you can see through their grips, are located on their 
own unique layer called Defpoints. Definition points are displayed regardless of whether the 
Defpoints layer is on or off.
To give you an idea of how these definition points work, the following exercises show you 
how to manipulate the definition points directly.
In this exercise, you’ll use coordinates to move a dimension line:
	
1.	 With the grips visible, click the grip near the dimension text.
	
2.	 Move the cursor around. When you move the cursor vertically, the text moves along the 
dimension line. When you move the cursor horizontally, the dimension line and text 
move together, keeping their parallel orientation to the dimensioned floor plan. Here, the 
entire dimension line, including the text, moves. In a later exercise, you’ll see how you 
can move the dimension text independently of the dimension line.
	
3.	 Enter @9′<0↵. Metric users should enter @275<0↵. The dimension line, text, and dimen-
sion extensions stretch to the new location to the right of the text (see Figure 11.19).

Moving Several Dimension Lines at Once
If you need to move several dimension lines, select them all and then Shift+click one set of dimension-
line grips from each dimension. After you’ve selected the grips, click one of the hot grips again. You 
can then move all of the dimension lines at once. 
Figure 11.19
Moving the dimension 
line by using its grip

386  | CHAPTER 11  Using Dimensions   
In step 3 of the previous exercise, you saw that you could specify an exact distance for the 
dimension line’s new location by entering a relative polar coordinate. Cartesian coordinates 
work just as well. You can even use object snaps to relocate dimension lines.
Next, try moving the dimension line back by using the Perpendicular osnap:
	
1.	 Click the grip at the bottom of the dimension line that you just edited.
	
2.	 Shift+right-click and choose Perpendicular from the Osnap context menu.
	
3.	 Place the cursor on the vertical dimension line that dimensions the balcony and click it. 
The selected dimension line moves to align with the other vertical dimension, back to its 
original location.
	
4.	 Press ↵ and then choose Zoom All from the Zoom flyout on the Navigation bar, and then 
click Save in the Quick Access toolbar to save this file in its current state. 
Making Changes to Multiple Dimensions
You can use the Dimension Edit tool to edit existing dimensions quickly. This tool gives you the 
ability to edit more than one dimension’s text at one time. One common use for the Dimension Edit 
tool is to change a string of dimensions to read Equal instead of showing the actual dimensioned 
distance. The following example shows an alternative to using the Properties palette for append-
ing text to a dimension:
	1.	 Type DED↵.
	2.	 At the prompt
Enter type of dimension editing [Home/New/Rotate/Oblique]<Home>:
type N↵ to use the New option. The Text Editor opens, showing 0 in the text box.
	3.	 Use the arrow keys to move the cursor behind or in front of the 0, and then enter the text that you 
want to append to the dimension. You can remove the 0 and replace the dimension with your text 
as an alternative.
	4.	 Click Close Text Editor in the Close panel of the Text Editor tab.
	5.	 At the Select objects: prompt, pick the dimensions that you want to edit. The Select 
objects: prompt remains, enabling you to select several dimensions.
	6.	 Press ↵ to finish your selection. The dimension changes to include your new text or to replace the 
existing dimension text.
The Dimension Edit tool is useful in editing dimension text, but you can also use this tool to make 
graphical changes to the text. Here is a list of the other Dimension Edit tool options:
Home    Moves the dimension text to its standard default position and angle.
Rotate    Rotates the dimension text to a new angle.
Oblique    Skews the dimension extension lines to a new angle. (See the section “Skewing 
Dimension Lines” later in this chapter.)

Editing Dimensions |  387  
Changing Style Settings of Individual Dimensions
In some cases, you have to change an individual dimension’s style settings in order to edit it. For 
example, if you try to move the text of a typical linear dimension, you may find that the text and 
dimension lines are inseparable. You need to make a change to the dimension style setting that 
controls how AutoCAD locates dimension text in relation to the dimension line. The following 
section describes how you can change the style settings of individual dimensions to facilitate 
changes in the dimension.
Moving Fixed Dimension Text
You’ve seen how dimension text is attached to the dimension line so that when the text is 
moved, the dimension line follows. You may encounter situations in which you want to move 
the text independently of the dimension line. The following steps show how you can separate 
dimension text from its dimension line. These steps also show how you can change a single 
dimension’s style settings:
	
1.	 Make sure that Dynamic Input is turned on in the status bar.
	
2.	 Click the dimension that you want to edit to expose its grips.
	
3.	 Hover over the grip nearest the dimension text. The multifunction grip menu appears 
(see Figure 11.20).
Figure 11.20
The multifunction grip 
menu for a dimension 
text
	
4.	 Select the option that you want to use to move the text. For example, to move the 5″ 
dimension text in Figure 11.20, select Move Text Only (which removes the leader, as 
explained later) or Move With Leader.
	
5.	 Move the text, and when you are satisfied with the new location, press the Esc key to clear 
your selection.
As you saw in Figure 11.20, you have a number of options for moving dimension text. The 
multifunction grip options are self-explanatory, but you might want to experiment with them to 
see how each one behaves.
When you use some of the dimension text multifunction grip options, you are changing the 
property of that dimension. In fact, the old way of moving dimension text involved changing a 
setting in the Properties palette for a selected dimension. The Move Text, Add Leader option in 

388  | CHAPTER 11  Using Dimensions   
the Text Movement listing of the Fit category of the Properties palette lets you move the dimen-
sion text independently of the dimension line. This option is similar to the Move With Leader 
option in the multifunction grip menu. It also draws a leader from the dimension line to the 
text. Another option—Move Text, No Leader—does the same thing but doesn’t include a leader. 
This option has the same effect as the Move Text Only option in the multifunction grip menu. 
You can also set these options for a dimension style by using the Text Placement options in the 
Fit tab of the New Dimension Style or Modify Dimension Style dialog box.
The Properties palette gives you access to many of the settings that you saw for setting up 
dimension styles. The main difference here is that the Properties palette affects only the dimen-
sions that you’ve selected.
In a previous exercise, you changed the format setting of a single dimension after it was 
placed. These settings can be made a standard part of your Architectural dimension style by 
using the Modify button in the Dimension Style Manager.
If you have multiple dimension styles and you want to change an existing dimension to the 
current dimension style, use the Update tool. Choose Update on the Dimensions panel or type 
-Dimstyle↵A↵. Make sure that you include the hyphen in front of the Dimstyle command. Then 
select the dimensions that you want to change and press ↵. The selected dimensions will be con-
verted to the current style.
Rotating and Positioning Dimension Text
Once in a while, dimension text works better if it’s kept in a horizontal orientation, even if the 
dimension itself isn’t horizontal. To rotate dimension text, click the Text Angle tool from the 
Annotate tab’s expanded Dimensions panel, select the dimension text, and then enter an angle or 
select two points to indicate an angle graphically. You can also enter 0↵ to return the dimension 
text to its default angle.
If you need to move the dimension text to the left, center, or right of the dimension line, you can use 
the Left Justify, Center Justify, or Right Justify tool in the Annotate tab’s expanded Dimensions 
panel. Note that if these Justify options are used on vertical dimensions, Right will shift the 
dimension to the top and Left will shift it to the bottom.
Editing Dimensions and Other Objects Together
It’s helpful to be able to edit a dimension directly by using its grips. However, the key feature 
of dimensions in AutoCAD is their ability to adjust themselves automatically to changes in the 
drawing.
To see how this works, try moving the living room closer to the bathroom wall. You can 
move a group of lines and vertices by using the Stretch command and the Crossing option:
	
1.	 Click the Stretch tool in the Home tab’s Modify panel, or type S↵C↵. You’ll see the 
following prompts:
At the Select objects to stretch
by crossing-window or crossing-polygon...
Select objects: C
Specify first corner:

2.	 Pick a crossing window, as illustrated in Figure 11.21, and then press ↵ to confirm your 
selection.

window
Select this area 
with a

3.	 At the Specify base point or [Displacement] <Displacement>: prompt, pick any 
point on the screen.
	
4.	 At the Specify second point or <use first point as displacement>: prompt, 
enter @2′<90↵ to move the wall 2′ in a 90° direction. Metric users should enter @61<90↵. 
The wall moves, and the dimension text changes to reflect the new dimensions, as shown 
in Figure 11.22.
Figure 11.22

with the updated 
dimensions

390  | CHAPTER 11  Using Dimensions   
	
5.	 After viewing the result of using the Stretch tool, click the Undo tool in the Quick Access 
toolbar or type U↵ to change the drawing back to its previous state.
You can also use the Mirror, Rotate, and Stretch commands with dimensions. The polar 
arrays also work, and you can use Extend and Trim with linear dimensions.
When you’re editing dimensioned objects, be sure to select the dimension associated with the 
object being edited. As you select objects, using the crossing window (C) or crossing polygon 
(CP) selection option helps you include the dimensions. For more on these selection options, see 
Chapter 2.
Placing Dimensions over Hatch Patterns
If a hatch pattern or solid fill completely covers a dimension, you can use the Draworder command 
to have AutoCAD draw the dimension over the hatch or solid fill. See Chapter 7, “Mastering Viewing 
Tools, Hatches, and External References,” and Chapter 13, “Copying Existing Drawings from Other 
Sources,” for more on various uses of the Draworder command.
Modifying the Dimension Style Settings by Using Override
In the section “Moving Fixed Dimension Text,” you used the Properties palette to facilitate mov-
ing the dimension text. You can also choose the Override tool in the Annotate tab’s expanded 
Dimensions panel (Dimoverride command) to accomplish the same thing. The Override option 
enables you to change an individual dimension’s style settings. Here’s an example that shows how 
you can use the Override option in place of the Properties palette in the exercise in “Moving Fixed 
Dimension Text”:
	1.	 Press the Esc key twice to make sure that you aren’t in the middle of a command. Then choose 
Override from the Annotate tab’s expanded Dimensions panel.
	2.	 At the following prompt, type Dimtmove↵:
Enter dimension variable name to override or [Clear overrides]:
	3.	 At the Enter new value for dimension variable <0>: prompt, enter 2↵. This has the 
same effect as selecting Move Text, Add Leader from the Fit category of the Properties palette.
	4.	 The Enter dimension variable name to override: prompt appears again, enabling you 
to enter another dimension variable. Press ↵ to move to the next step.
	5.	 At the Select objects: prompt, select the dimension that you want to change. You can select 
a group of dimensions if you want to change several dimensions at once. Press ↵ when you’ve 
finished with your selection. The dimension settings change for the selected dimensions. In this 
case, the dimension text can be moved independently of the dimension line.
As you can see from this example, the Dimoverride command requires that you know exactly 
which dimension variable to edit in order to make the desired modification. In this case, setting 
the Dimtmovevariable to 2 lets you move the dimension text independently of the dimension line. 
If you find the Dimoverride command useful, consult Bonus Chapter 4 to determine which system 
variable corresponds to the Dimension Style dialog box settings.

Editing Dimensions |  391  
Associating Dimensions with Objects
You’ve seen how dimensions and the objects with which they’re associated can move together 
so that the dimension remains connected to the object. When you’re in the process of editing a 
drawing, dimensions may lose their association with objects, so you may need to re-create an 
association between a dimension and an object. The following steps show you how this  
is done:
	
1.	 Choose Reassociate from the Annotate tab’s expanded Dimensions panel. You can also 
type Dimreassociate↵ at the Command prompt.
	
2.	 At the following prompt, select the dimension that you want to reassociate with an object, 
and then press ↵:
Select dimensions to reassociate
Select Objects or [Disassociated]:
	
3.	 At the Specify first extension line origin or [Select object] <next>: 
prompt, note that an X appears at one of the dimension’s definition points.
	
4.	 Use the Endpoint osnap, and click the end of the object that you want to have connected 
to the definition point indicated in step 3.
	
5.	 An X appears at the dimension’s other definition point. Use the Endpoint osnap again, 
and click the other endpoint of the object that you want associated with the dimension. 
You now have the dimension associated with the endpoints of the object. You may have 
to adjust the location of the dimension line at this point.
In step 3, you see an X at the location of a dimension definition point. If the definition 
point is already associated with an object, the X appears with a box around it. The box is 
a reminder that the definition point is already associated with an object and that you’ll be 
changing its association. In this situation, you can press ↵ to switch to the dimension’s other 
definition point.

392  | CHAPTER 11  Using Dimensions   
Also in step 3, you have the option to select an object. This option enables you to associ-
ate the dimension with an entire object instead of with just one endpoint. If you type S↵ 
at that prompt in step 3, you can then select the object that you want to associate with the 
dimension. The dimension changes so that its definition points coincide with the endpoints 
of the object. The dimension remains in its original orientation. For example, a vertical 
dimension remains vertical even if you associate the dimension with a horizontal line. In 
this situation, the dimension dutifully dimensions the endpoints of the line but shows a 
distance of 0.
Removing Dimension Associations
You can remove a dimension’s association with an object by using the Dimdisassociate command. 
Type Dimdisassociate↵ at the Command prompt, select the dimension(s), and then press ↵.
Adding a String of Dimensions with a Single Operation
In AutoCAD you can create a string of dimensions using a single operation. The Qdim com-
mand lets you select a set of objects instead of having to select points. The following exercise 
demonstrates how the Qdim command works:
	
1.	 If you haven’t done so already, zoom out so that you have an overall view of the Unit floor 
plan.
	
2.	 Click Quick Dimension on the Dimensions panel.
	
3.	 At the Select geometry to dimension: prompt, place a selection window around the 
entire left-side wall of the unit.
	
4.	 Press ↵ to finish your selection. The following prompt appears:
Specify dimension line position, or
[Continuous/Staggered/Baseline/Ordinate/Radius/Diameter/
datumPoint/Edit/seTtings] <Continuous>:
	
5.	 Click a point to the left of the wall to place the dimension. A string of dimensions 
appears, displaying all of the dimensions for the wall (see Figure 11.23).
	
6.	 When you’ve finished reviewing the results of this exercise, exit the file without 
saving it.
The prompt in step 4 indicates several types of dimensions from which you can choose. For 
example, if you want the dimensions to originate from a single baseline, you can enter B↵ in 
step 4 to select the Baseline option.
The Qdim command can be a time-saver when you want to dimension a wall quickly. It may 
not work in all situations, but if the object that you’re dimensioning is fairly simple, it can be all 
that you need.
In this exercise, you used a simple window to select the wall. For more complex shapes, 
try using a crossing polygon selection window. See Chapter 2 for more on crossing 
polygons.

Editing Dimensions |  393  
Adding or Removing the Alternate Dimensions
You may eventually encounter a drawing that contains alternate dimensions, as shown in some 
of the figures earlier in this chapter. You can remove those alternate dimensions by turning off 
the alternate dimension features. Here’s how it’s done:
	
1.	 Click the Dimension Style tool in the Annotate tab’s Dimensions panel title bar, or enter 
D↵ to open the Dimension Style Manager.
	
2.	 Select the style that uses the alternate units. In the Styles list box, choose Modify.
	
3.	 Select the Alternate Units tab.
	
4.	 Click the Display Alternate Units check box to remove the check mark.
	
5.	 Click OK, and then click Close to close the Dimension Style Manager.

Using Object Snap While Dimensioning
When you pick intersections and endpoints frequently, as you do during dimensioning, it can be 
inconvenient to use the Osnap context menu. If you know that you’ll be using certain osnaps fre-
quently, you can use running osnaps. (See the sidebar “The Osnap Options” in Chapter 3 for more 
on setting up running osnaps.)
continues

394  | CHAPTER 11  Using Dimensions   
continued
After you’ve designated your running osnaps, the next time you’re prompted to select a point, the 
selected osnap modes are automatically activated. You can still override the default settings by 
using the Osnap context menu (Shift+right-click the mouse).
There is a drawback to setting a running osnap mode: When your drawing gets crowded, you can 
end up picking the wrong point by accident. However, you can easily toggle the running osnap 
mode off by clicking Object Snap in the status bar or by pressing F3.
The dimensions that use the style that you just edited change to remove the alternate dimen-
sions. You can also perform the reverse operation and add alternate dimensions to an existing 
set of dimensions. Follow the steps shown here, but instead of removing the check mark in  
step 4, add the check mark and make the appropriate setting changes to the rest of the Alternate 
Units tab.
Dimensioning Nonorthogonal Objects
So far, you’ve been reading about how to work with linear dimensions. You can also dimension 
nonorthogonal objects, such as circles, arcs, triangles, and trapezoids. In the following sections, 
you’ll practice dimensioning a nonorthogonal object.
For the following exercises, you’ll use a drawing of a hexagonal-shaped window. Open the 
11a-wind.dwg file from the sample files. This file is set up for both Imperial and metric users. 
You can use this file to follow along.
Dimensioning Nonorthogonal Linear Distances
Now you’ll dimension the window. The unusual shape of the window prevents you from using 
the horizontal or vertical dimensions that you’ve used already. However, choosing Aligned from 
the Dimension flyout in the Dimensions panel enables you to dimension at an angle:
	
1.	 Click the Aligned tool in the Dimension flyout on the Dimensions panel. You can also 
enter DAL↵ to start the aligned dimension.
	
2.	 At the Specify first extension line origin or <select object>: prompt, press ↵. 
You could pick extension-line origins as you did in earlier examples, but pressing ↵ shows 
you how the Select Object option works.
	
3.	 At the Select object to dimension: prompt, pick the upper-right face of the hexagon 
near coordinate 29,22 (75,55 for metric users). As the prompt indicates, you can also pick 
an arc or a circle for this type of dimension.
	
4.	 At the Specify dimension line location or [Mtext/Text/Angle]: prompt, pick a 
point near coordinate 34,24 (90,60 for metric users). The dimension appears in the draw-
ing, as shown in Figure 11.24.

Dimensioning Nonorthogonal Objects |  395  
Just as with linear dimensions, you can enter T↵ in step 4 to enter alternate text for the 
dimension.
Next, you’ll dimension a face of the hexagon. Instead of its actual length, however, you’ll 
dimension a distance at a specified angle—the distance from the center of the face:
	
1.	 Select the Linear tool from the Dimension flyout on the Dimensions panel or type DLI↵.
	
2.	 At the Specify first extension line origin or <select object>: prompt, 
press ↵.
	
3.	 At the Select object to dimension: prompt, pick the lower-right face of the hexagon 
near coordinate 29,14 (77,33 for metric users).
	
4.	 At the Specify dimension line location or [Mtext/Text/Angle/Horizontal/
Vertical/Rotated]: prompt, type R↵ to select the Rotated option.
	
5.	 At the Specify angle of dimension line <0>: prompt, enter 30↵.
	
6.	 At the Specify dimension line location or [Mtext/Text/Angle/Horizontal/
Vertical/Rotated]: prompt, pick a point near coordinate 33,7 (88,12 for metric users). 
Your drawing will look like Figure 11.25.

Dimensioning Radii, Diameters, and Arcs
To dimension circular objects, you use another set of options from the Dimension menu:
	
1.	 Select the Angular tool from the Dimension flyout on the Dimensions panel, or enter 
DAN↵ at the Command prompt.
	
2.	 At the Select arc, circle, line, or <specify vertex>: prompt, pick the upper-left 
face of the hexagon near coordinate 15,22 (44,57 for metric users).
	
3.	 At the Select second line: prompt, pick the top face at coordinate 22,26 (54,62 for 
metric users).
	
4.	 At the Specify dimension arc line location or [Mtext/Text/Angle/Quadrant]: 
prompt, notice that as you move the cursor around the upper-left corner of the hexagon, 
the dimension changes, as shown in the top images of Figure 11.26.
	
5.	 Pick a point near coordinate 21,20 (49,50 for metric users). The dimension is fixed in the 
drawing. (See the bottom image of Figure 11.26.)

If you need to make subtle adjustments to the dimension line or text location, you can do so 
by using grips after you place the angular dimension.
Now try the Diameter option, which shows the diameter of a circle:
	
1.	 Click the Diameter tool in the Dimension flyout on the Dimensions panel, or enter DDI↵ 
at the Command prompt.

2.	 At the Select arc or circle: prompt, pick the circle.
	
3.	 At the Specify dimension line location or [Mtext/Text/Angle]: prompt, you see 
the diameter dimension drag along the circle as you move the cursor. If you move the 
cursor outside the circle, the dimension line and text also move outside the circle. (See the 
top image in Figure 11.27.)
If the dimension text can’t fit in the circle, AutoCAD gives you the option to place the 
dimension text outside the circle as you drag the temporary dimension to a horizontal 
position.
	
4.	 Place the cursor inside the circle so that the dimension arrow points in a horizontal direc-
tion, as shown in the bottom image of Figure 11.27.

5.	 With the text centered, click the mouse.
The Radius tool in the Dimension flyout on the Dimensions panel gives you a radius dimen-
sion, just as the Diameter tool provides a circle’s diameter. Figure 11.28 shows a radius dimen-
sion on the outside of the circle, but you can place it inside in a manner similar to how you place 
the diameter dimension.

398  | CHAPTER 11  Using Dimensions   
The Center Mark tool on the Centerlines panel places a center mark in the center of the 
selected arc or circle. This center mark is associative, meaning that it will follow changes in the 
location and size of the circle or arc with which it is associated. The center mark extension lines 
can also be edited using grips. The Centerdisassociate command can be used to “disassociate” 
the center mark from the circle or arc. Once disassociated, the center mark behaves as an inde-
pendent object until the Centerreassociate command is used to re-associate it.
Properties of the center mark, such as the center mark size, the extension line visibility, or the 
extension line linetype, can be modified through the Properties palette. Select the center mark, 
and right-click and select Properties to open the Properties palette. Here you can set values such 
as the rotation angle of the center mark, the cross size, or the gap between the cross and exten-
sion line. You can also set the length of the extension line beyond the dimensioned object using 
the Left, Right, Top, and Bottom extension options. Figure 11.29 shows an example of a center 
mark placed on a circle object, along with the Properties palette. You can also double-click the 
center mark to open the Quick Properties palette, which gives you access to the extension line 
properties, such as length and display.

If you need to dimension an arc or a circle whose center isn’t in the drawing area, you can 
use the jogged dimension. Here are the steps:
	
1.	 Click the Jogged tool from the Dimension flyout on the Annotate tab’s Dimensions panel, 
or enter DJO↵ at the Command prompt.
	
2.	 At the Select arc or circle: prompt, select the object that you want to dimension.
	
3.	 At the Specify center location override: prompt, select a point that indicates the 
general direction to the center of the arc or circle. A dimension line appears and follows 
the movement of your cursor.
	
4.	 Position the dimension line where you want it, and then click.
	
5.	 Position the dimension line jog where you want it, and then click. The jogged dimension 
is placed in the drawing (see Figure 11.30).
Figure 11.30

400  | CHAPTER 11  Using Dimensions   
Arc lengths can also be given a dimension using the Arc Length tool. Choose the Arc Length 
tool from the Dimension flyout on the Dimensions panel, or enter DAR↵ at the Command 
prompt. At the Select Arc or polyline arc segment: prompt, select the arc that you 
want to dimension. It can be either a plain arc or a polyline arc. Once you’ve selected the arc, 
the arc dimension appears and moves with the cursor. You can then select the location for the 
dimension.
Skewing Dimension Lines
At times, you may need to force the extension lines to take on an angle other than 90° to the 
dimension line. This is a common requirement of isometric drawings, in which most lines are 
at 30° or 60° angles instead of 90°. To facilitate nonorthogonal dimensions like these, AutoCAD 
offers the Oblique option:
	
1.	 Choose Oblique from the expanded Dimensions panel, or type DED↵O↵.
	
2.	 At the Select objects: prompt, pick the aligned dimension in the upper-right portion 
of the drawing and press ↵ to confirm your selection.
	
3.	 At the Enter obliquing angle (Press ENTER for none): prompt, enter 60↵ for 60°. 
The dimension will skew so that the extension lines are at 60° (see Figure 11.31).
	
4.	 Save the drawing.

Using the Dimension Tool |  401  
Using the Dimension Tool
Dimensions are often added to a drawing after the drawing has reached a fairly high level 
of completion. Most of the dimensions are then added all at once without using other tools. 
AutoCAD offers the Dimension tool, which lets you apply sets of dimensions without having to 
stop to select multiple tools. This can help to streamline your dimensioning work.
With the Dimension tool, you can add a radius dimension to a circle and then go on to 
dimension a polygon or add a set of linear dimensions without having to select another 
tool.
To get a better idea of how the Dimension tool works, try the following exercise. This is a 
exercise similar to the one that you saw under “Drawing Linear Dimensions” earlier in this 
chapter, but this time you will use the Dimension tool in the Dimensions panel.
	
1.	 Open the 11b-unit.dwg drawing from the sample files. This file is set up for both 
Imperial and metric users.
	
2.	 Click the Dimension tool in the Annotate tab’s Dimensions panel or type DIM↵.
	
3.	 Hover over the line representing the interior wall on the right side of the plan. You see a 
temporary dimension appear (see Figure 11.32).
Figure 11.32
The temporary dimension 
appears as you hover over 
the line.
	
4.	 Move the cursor slightly to the left of the line, and then move it back to the right. The tem-
porary dimension shifts position depending on the side of the line you point to.
	
5.	 Adjust the cursor so that the temporary dimension appears on the right side of the line, 
and then click that location. The dimension now follows the cursor.

402  | CHAPTER 11  Using Dimensions   
Figure 11.33

tool prompt
	
7.	 Type C↵ and then select the dimension extension line toward the bottom of the dimension 
that you just added.
	
8.	 Use the Endpoint osnap to select the upper-right corner of the balcony (see Figure 11.34). 
Another dimension is added.
	
9.	 Use the Endpoint osnap to select the lower-right corner of the balcony (see Figure 11.34).
	
10.	 Press ↵↵↵ to exit the Dimension tool. You can also press the Esc key.
Figure 11.34
Select these endpoints to 
continue the dimension.
Select this 
extension.
Select these
endpoints.
You may recall that in the first dimensioning exercise in this chapter, you selected the corners 
of the floor plan to indicate the points that you wanted to dimension. In the last exercise, you 
selected the line that you wanted to dimension instead of the points. In addition, you just typed 
C↵ to continue the dimension instead of using the Continue tool in the Dimensions panel. These 
differences may seem minor, but they can help to streamline your work as you add dimensions 
to your drawing.
Take a look at the options for the Dimension tool shown earlier in Figure 11.33. Most of 
these options offer the same functionality as tools that you’ve already seen enabling you 
to add different types of dimensions without leaving the Dimension tool. A few of the 
options are unique to the Dimension tool. Table 11.2 gives you a list of those options and 
their use.
	
6.	 Enter @4′<0↵. The dimension is placed in the drawing. Notice that the cursor and 
the command line still display the Select object prompt. This tells you that you are 
still in the Dim command. Also notice that the prompt offers several options (see 
Figure 11.33).

Using the Dimension Tool |  403  
Table 11.2:	
The Dimension tool options
Option
Function
Angular
Draws an angular dimension between two nonparallel lines. This option is similar 
to the Angular tool in the Dimension flyout and the Dimangular command.
Baseline
Draws a dimension or set of dimensions from a dimension extension. This is  
similar to the Baseline tool or the Dimbaseline command.
Continue
Draws a string of dimensions from an existing dimension extension line. This is 
similar to the Continue tool or the Dimcontinue command.
Ordinate
Draws ordinate dimensions. This is similar to the Ordinate tool or the Dimordinate 
command (see “Applying Ordinate Dimensions” later in this chapter).
Align
Aligns a dimension to another dimension. This can be used to “straighten” a series 
of dimensions that are not in line with each other.
Distribute
Adjusts the vertical spacing of dimensions to be equidistant. This can be used to 
adjust stacked baseline dimensions so that they are evenly spaced.
Layer
Sets the layer for dimensions by entering a layer name or by selecting an object 
whose layer you want to use. 
Undo
Undoes the last Dim command operation.
Another feature of the Dimension tool is its ability to recognize an object and apply the 
appropriate dimension type to that object. To see how this works, try the following exercise:
	
1.	 Close the 11b-unit.dwg file without saving it, and then open the 11b-wind.dwg file.
	
2.	 Click the Dimension tool, or type DIM↵, and then hover over the line in the upper-right 
side of the hexagon (see Figure 11.35).

3.	 Adjust the temporary dimension so that it appears above and to the right of the line and 
click.
	
4.	 Click again to place the dimension, as shown in Figure 11.35.
	
5.	 Hover over the circle. You see a temporary diameter dimension. You can change the loca-
tion of the dimension from the inside to the outside of the circle by adjusting the cursor 

404  | CHAPTER 11  Using Dimensions   
location. Also notice that the prompt offers the Radius, Jogged,  and Angular options. 
You can enter the uppercase letter of the option to control the type of dimension that will 
be applied to the circle.
	
6.	 With the dimension on the inside of the circle, click the mouse. The dimension is now 
fixed inside the circle.
	
7.	 Adjust the location where the dimension touches the circle and click the mouse. The 
Diameter dimension is fixed in position.
	
8.	 Click the bottommost line of the hexagon, and then click the lower-left line of the hexagon 
(see Figure 11.35). A temporary angular dimension appears.
	
9.	 Slowly rotate the cursor around the corner where the two lines meet. Notice that a tem-
porary angular dimension follows the cursor, offering a different dimension based on the 
location of the cursor, as shown earlier in Figure 11.26.
	
10.	 Place the cursor on the outside of the hexagon to display the 120-degree angle and click 
the mouse. The angular dimension is placed in the drawing.
	
11.	 Right-click and click Enter to exit the Dimension tool.
	
12.	 Close the 11b-wind.dwg file without saving it.
In this exercise, you saw how the Dimension tool offered the appropriate dimension type 
when hovering over an object. You also saw how you can continue to add dimensions without 
having to select a tool from the Ribbon panel.
As you work with the dimensioning tools in AutoCAD, you may find that you only need the 
Dimension tool for most of your dimensions. The Dimension tool may offer a faster way to add 
dimensions, depending on the type of drawing you are working on.
Adding a Note with a Leader Arrow
One type of dimension is something like a text-dimension hybrid. The AutoCAD Multileader 
tool lets you add a text note combined with an arrow, which points to an object in your drawing. 
Multileaders are easy to use and offer the same text formatting tools as the Mtext tool. Try the 
following exercise to get familiar with multileaders:
	
1.	 Turn off Osnaps for this exercise to make it easier to select points in a crowded area of the 
drawing.
	
2.	 Return to the 11a-wind.dwg file, and click the Multileader tool in the Annotate tab’s 
Leaders panel (see Figure 11.36), or enter MLD↵.

at coordinate 16,24 (45,59 for metric users).
	
4.	 At the Specify leader landing location: prompt, enter @6<110↵. Metric users should 
enter @15<110↵. The Text Editor tab appears, along with the text cursor at the note location.
	
5.	 Enter Window Frame for the note, and then click Close Text Editor in the Text Editor tab’s 
Close panel. Your note appears with the leader arrow similar to the one shown in Figure 11.37.
Figure 11.37

note added
The text in the note is in the current text style unless you specify another style in the Text tab 
of the New Dimension Style or Modify Dimension Style dialog box. (See the section “The Text 
Tab” in Bonus Chapter 4 for more information.)
Setting the Scale of Leaders
Multileaders have an Annotative option that allows them to adjust automatically to the scale of 
the drawing. You can find the Annotative option setting in the properties for a specific multileader 
in the drawing or in the multileader style setting. See the Scale option in Table 11.4, later in this 
chapter, under the Leader Structure tab.
The Multileader tool offers a lot of options that aren’t obvious when you’re using it. In step 1 
of the previous example, after choosing Multileader, you can press ↵ to modify the behavior of 
the Multileader tool. You’ll see the following prompt:
Enter an option [Leader type/leader lAnding/Content
 type/Maxpoints/First angle/Second angle/eXit options]
 <eXit options>:
Table 11.3 gives you a rundown of these options and their functions.

leader lAnding
Determines whether a leader landing is used. The leader landing is the short 
line that connects the arrow to the note. It also lets you set landing 
distance.
Content type
Lets you select between Mtext or a block for the leader note. You also have the 
option to choose None.
Maxpoints
Lets you set the number of points that you select for the leader. The default

First angle
Lets you constrain the angle of the leader line to a fixed value.
Second angle
Lets you constrain the angle of the arrow’s second line segment if you’re using 
more than two points for the Maxpoints option.
eXit options
Lets you return to the main part of the Multileader command to draw the 
leader.
Creating Multileader Styles
Besides using the options shown in Table 11.3, you can create multileader styles to control 
the appearance of multileaders. Multileader styles are similar in concept to text and dimen-
sion styles. They allow you to set up the appearance of the leader under a name that you 
can call up at any time. For example, you may want to have one type of leader that uses a 
block instead of text for the note and another leader that uses a dot in place of an arrow. 
Alternatively, you may want to set up a style that uses curved lines instead of straight ones 
for the leader line. You can create a multileader style for each of these types of leader fea-
tures and then switch between the leader styles, depending on the requirements of your 
leader note.
To set up or modify a multileader style, click the Multileader Style Manager tool in the 
Annotate tab’s Leaders panel title bar. You can also enter MLS↵ at the Command prompt. 
Doing so opens the Multileader Style Manager, shown in Figure 11.38. From here, you can 
select an existing style from the list on the left and click Modify to edit it, or you can click 
New to create a new one. If you click New, you’re asked to select an existing style as a basis for 
your new style.

Once you’ve set up a multileader style, you can make it the default style by selecting it from 
the Multileader Style drop-down list on the Annotate tab’s Leaders panel.

Adding a Note with a Leader Arrow |  409  
The selected style will be applied to any new multileader that you add to your drawing. You 
can also change the style of an existing multileader. To do this, click the multileader to select it, 
and then select the multileader style that you want from the Leaders panel drop-down list.
Editing Multileader Notes
If you need to make changes to the note portion of a multileader, you can do so by double-
clicking the note. Doing so brings up the Text Editor tab in the Ribbon, allowing you to make 
changes as you would in a word processor.
At other times, you may want to change the leader line, arrows, or other graphic features 
of the multileader. For example, you may want to have all of the notes aligned vertically for a 
neater appearance. As another option, you may want to add more leader arrows so that the note 
points to several objects in the drawing instead of just one.
The Leaders panel offers several tools that let you make these types of changes to your leader 
notes (refer back to Figure 11.36). The Add Leader and Remove Leader tools let you add or 
remove leaders from a multileader. Add Leader is a handy tool if you want a single note to point 
to several objects. The Align tool lets you align the note portion of several multileaders. Finally, 
the Collect tool lets you collect several multileaders that use blocks for notes into a single note.
Breaking a Dimension Line for a Leader
In a crowded drawing, your multileader arrow may have to cross over a dimension line. In 
many drafting conventions, when a leader line crosses over a dimension line, the dimension line 
must be shown with a gap.
You can apply a gap to a dimension line using the Dimbreak tool. Here’s how it works:
	
1.	 Choose Break from the Dimensions panel.
	
2.	 At the Select dimension to add/remove break or [Multiple]: prompt, select a 
dimension line, or enter M↵ and select multiple dimension lines.
	
3.	 When you’re finished with your selection, press ↵. Note that this ↵ is necessary only 
when using the Multiple option.
	
4.	 At the Select object to break dimension or [Auto/Manual/Remove] <Auto>: 
prompt, press ↵. A gap appears wherever a leader line or other dimension line crosses 
over the selected dimension line.
If you prefer to indicate a break manually, enter M↵ at the prompt in step 4. Doing so allows 
you to select two points on the dimension, indicating where the gap is to occur. The drawback 
to adding a break manually is that the break will not follow the leader line if the leader line is 
moved. The break will have to be removed and replaced.
If additional dimension or leader lines are added that cross over the dimension line, repeat your use 
of the Dimbreak tool. To remove an existing break, use the Remove option in step 4 by entering R↵.

410  | CHAPTER 11  Using Dimensions   
Applying Ordinate Dimensions
In mechanical drafting, ordinate dimensions are used to maintain the accuracy of machined parts 
by establishing an origin on the part. All major dimensions are described as x-coordinates or 
y-coordinates of that origin. The origin is usually an easy-to-locate feature of the part, such as a 
machined bore or two machined surfaces.
Figure 11.40 shows a typical application of ordinate dimensions. In the lower-right corner, 
note the two dimensions whose leaders are jogged. Also note the origin location in the center 
circle.
Figure 11.40
A drawing using ordinate 
dimensions
To use the Ordinate command, perform the following steps:
	
1.	 Select Origin from the View tab’s Coordinates panel, or type UCS↵Or↵. If you don’t see 
the Coordinates panel in the View tab, go to the View tab, right-click in the Ribbon, and 
select Show Panels ➢ Coordinates.
	
2.	 At the Specify new origin point <0,0,0>: prompt, click the exact location of the ori-
gin of your part.
	
3.	 Toggle Ortho mode on in the status bar.
	
4.	 Click the Ordinate tool in the Dimension flyout on the Annotate tab’s Dimensions panel. 
You can also enter DOR↵ to start the ordinate dimension.
	
5.	 At the Specify feature location: prompt, click the item that you want to dimension. 
The direction of the leader determines whether the dimension will be of the Xdatum or 
the Ydatum.
	
6.	 At the Specify leader endpoint or [Xdatum/Ydatum/Mtext/Text/Angle]: prompt, 
indicate the length and direction of the leader. Do this by positioning the rubber-banding 
leader perpendicular to the coordinate direction that you want to dimension and then 
clicking that point.
In steps 1 and 2, you used the UCS feature to establish a second origin in the drawing. The 
Ordinate Dimension tool then uses that origin to determine the ordinate dimensions. You’ll get 
a chance to work with the UCS feature in Chapter 21, “Using Advanced 3D Features.” You may 

Adding Tolerance Notation |  411  
have noticed options in the Command window for the Ordinate Dimension tool. The Xdatum 
and Ydatum options force the dimension to be of the x- or y-coordinate no matter what direc-
tion the leader takes. The Mtext option opens the Text Editor tab in the Ribbon, enabling you to 
append or replace the ordinate dimension text. The Text option lets you enter replacement text 
directly through the Command window.
If you turn off Ortho mode, the dimension leader is drawn with a jog to maintain the orthog-
onal line segment to the dimension text (look back at Figure 11.40).
Adding Tolerance Notation
In mechanical drafting, tolerances are a key part of a drawing’s notation. They specify the allow-
able variation in size and shape that a mechanical part can have. To help facilitate tolerance 
notation, AutoCAD provides the Tolerance command, which offers common ISO tolerance 
symbols together with a quick way to build a standard feature-control symbol. Feature-control 
symbols are industry-standard symbols used to specify tolerances. If you’re a mechanical engi-
neer or drafter, the AutoCAD tolerance notation options will be a valuable tool. However, a full 
discussion of tolerances requires a basic understanding of mechanical design and drafting, and 
it is beyond the scope of this book.
Inserting Tolerance and Datum Values
To use the Tolerance command, choose Tolerance from the expanded Dimensions panel, or type 
TOL↵ at the Command prompt to open the Geometric Tolerance dialog box (see Figure 11.41).
Figure 11.41
The Geometric 
Tolerance dialog box
This is where you enter tolerance and datum values for the feature-control symbol. You can 
enter two tolerance values and three datum values. In addition, you can stack values in a two-
tiered fashion.
Click a box in the Sym group to open the Symbol dialog box.

412  | CHAPTER 11  Using Dimensions   
The top section of Figure 11.42 shows what each symbol in the Symbol dialog box represents. 
The bottom image shows a sample drawing with a feature symbol used on a cylindrical object. 
The symbols in the sample drawing show that the upper cylinder needs to be parallel within 
0.003″ of the lower cylinder. Note that mechanical drawings often use measurements in thou-
sandths, so 0.3 means 0.003.

In the Geometric Tolerance dialog box, you can click a box in any of the Datum groups or a 
box in the right side of the Tolerance groups to open the Material Condition dialog box. This dia-
log box contains standard symbols relating to the maximum and minimum material conditions 
of a feature on the part being dimensioned.

Adding Tolerance Notation |  413  
Adding Inspection Dimensions
Another type of dimension related to tolerances is the inspection dimension. This is a type of 
dimension notation that indicates how often the tolerances of a dimension should be checked.
To add an inspection dimension, first add a regular linear dimension as described in the 
early part of this chapter. Next, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Inspect from the Dimensions panel or type Diminspect↵. The Inspection 
Dimension dialog box appears (see Figure 11.43).
Figure 11.43
The Inspection 
Dimension dialog box
	
2.	 Click the Select Dimensions tool. The dialog box temporarily closes to allow you to select 
a dimension. Press ↵ when you have selected the dimension that you want to edit.
	
3.	 Select a shape option from the Shape group.
	
4.	 Enter a value for the Label and Inspection Rate boxes, and then click OK.
The dimension appears with the additional changes from the dialog box (see Figure 11.44).

ing, you’ll learn that there are standard formats for drawing dimensions. Arrows, text size, 
and even the way dimension lines are drawn are all subject to a standard format. Fortunately, 
AutoCAD offers dimension styles that let you set up your dimension format once and then 
call up that format whenever you need it.

Using Attributes 
Earlier in this book, you learned how to create blocks, which are assemblies of objects in the 
AutoCAD® 2017 program. Blocks enable you to form parts or symbols that can be easily repro-
duced. Furniture, bolts, doors, and windows are a few common items that you can create with 
blocks. Whole rooms and appliances can also be made into blocks. There is no limit to a block’s size.
AutoCAD also offers a feature called attributes, which allows you to store text information 
as a part of a block. For example, you can store the material specifications for a bolt or other 
mechanical part that you’ve converted into a block. If your application is architecture, you can 
store the material, hardware, and dimensional information for a door or window that has been 
converted into a block. You can then quickly gather information about that block that may not 
be obvious from the graphics.
Attribute text can be set up to be invisible, or it can be displayed as text in the drawing. If 
it’s invisible, you can easily view the attribute information by double-clicking the block that 
contains the attribute. The attribute information is displayed in a dialog box. This information 
can also be extracted to a database or spreadsheet, letting you keep an inventory of the blocks in 
your drawing. You can even convert attribute information into tables in an AutoCAD drawing. 
Doing so can help you make quick work of parts lists or door and window schedules. By using 
attributes, you can keep track of virtually any object in a drawing or maintain textual informa-
tion in the drawing that can be queried.
Keeping track of objects is just one way to use attributes. You can also use them in place of 
text objects when you must keep text and graphic items together. One common example is the 
reference symbol in an architectural drawing. Reference symbols are used to indicate the loca-
tion of more detailed information in a drawing set, such as the elevation views of a room or a 
cross-section of a wall or other part of a building.
In this chapter, you’ll use attributes for one of their common functions: maintaining lists of 
parts. In this case, the parts are doors. This chapter also describes how to import these attributes 
into a database management program. As you go through the exercises, think about the ways 
that attributes can help you in your particular application.

418  | CHAPTER 12  Using Attributes   
Creating Attributes
Attributes depend on blocks. You might think of an attribute as text information attached to a 
block. The information can be a description of the block or some other pertinent text. For exam-
ple, you can include an attribute definition with the Door block that you created in Chapter 4, 
“Organizing Objects with Blocks and Groups.” Subsequently, every time you insert the Door 
block, you’ll be prompted for a value associated with that door. The value can be a number, a 
height or width value, a name, or any type of text information that you want. After you enter a 
value, it’s stored as part of the Door block in the drawing database. This value can be displayed 
as text attached to the Door block or it can be invisible. You can change the value at any time. 
You can even specify the prompts for the attribute value.
However, suppose that you don’t have the attribute information when you design the Door 
block. As an alternative, you can add the attribute to a symbol that is later placed by the door 
when you know enough about the design to specify what type of door goes where. Figure 12.1 
shows a sample door symbol and a table to which the symbol refers. The standard door-type 
symbol suits this purpose nicely because it’s an object that you can set up and use as a block 
independent of the Door block.
Figure 12.1
A door symbol tells you 
what type of door goes 
in the location shown. 
Usually, the symbol 
contains a number or a 
letter that is keyed to a 
table that shows more 
information about the 
door.
A door symbol placed by a door in a ﬂoor plan
refers to a speciﬁcation in a table in another drawing.
Adding Attributes to Blocks
In the following exercise, you’ll create a door-type symbol, which is commonly used to describe 
the size, thickness, and other characteristics of any given door in an architectural drawing. The 
symbol is usually a circle, a hexagon, or a diamond with a number in it. The number is generally 
cross-referenced to a schedule that lists all the door types and their characteristics.

Creating Attributes |  419  
You’ll create a new block containing attribute definitions in the file for which the block is 
intended: the Plan.dwg file. You will use the 12a-plan.dwg file from the sample drawings, 
which is similar to the Plan file on which you’ve been working in previous chapters. You’ll cre-
ate the block in the file so that you can easily insert it where it belongs in the plan.
First, open the Plan file and set up a view appropriate for creating the block with the 
attribute:
	
1.	 Open the 12a-plan.dwg file. Metric users can use the file 12a-plan-metric.dwg. These 
are similar to the Plan.dwg file that you’ve created on your own with a few additions to 
facilitate the exercises in this chapter.
	
2.	 Select the Zoom Window option on the Navigation bar.
	
3.	 At the Specify first corner: prompt, enter 0,0↵.
	
4.	 At the Specify opposite corner: prompt, enter 12,9 (30.5,22.8 for metric users). This 
causes your view to zoom in to a location near the origin of the drawing in a 12″×9″ area 
(30.5 cm×22.8 cm for metric users).
You zoom into this small area because you’ll draw the block at its paper size of 1/4″ (or 0.6 cm 
for metric users). Now you’re ready to create the block and attribute. You’ll start by drawing the 
graphics of the block, and then you’ll add the attribute definition:
	
1.	 Draw a circle with its center at coordinate 7,5 (15,11 for metric users) and a diameter of 
0.25 (0.6 for metric users). The circle is automatically placed on layer 0, which is the cur-
rent layer. Remember that objects in a block that are on layer 0 take on the color and line-
type assignment of the layer on which the block is inserted.
	
2.	 Zoom into the circle so that it’s about the same size as that shown in Figure 12.2.
Figure 12.2
The attribute definition 
inserted in the circle
	
3.	 If the circle looks like an octagon, type RE↵ to regenerate your drawing.
	
4.	 Click the Define Attributes tool in the Home tab’s expanded Block Definition panel, or 
type ATT↵ to open the Attribute Definition dialog box (see Figure 12.3).

420  | CHAPTER 12  Using Attributes   
Figure 12.3
The Attribute 
Definition dialog box
	
5.	 In the Attribute group, click the Tag box and enter D-TYPE.
Understanding the Attribute Tag
The attribute tag is equivalent to a field name in a database. You can also think of the tag as the 
attribute’s name or ID. It can help to identify the purpose of the attribute. The tag can be a maxi-
mum of 255 characters but can’t contain spaces. If you plan to use the attribute data in a database 
program, check that program’s documentation for other restrictions on field names.
	
6.	 Press the Tab key or click the Prompt box and enter Door type. This is the text for the 
prompt that will appear when you insert the block containing this attribute. Often the 
prompt is the same as the tag, but it can be anything you like. Unlike the tag, the prompt 
can include spaces and other special characters.
Give Your Prompts Meaningful Names
Use a prompt that gives explicit instructions so that the user will know exactly what is expected. 
Consider including an example in the prompt. (Enclose the example in square brackets to imitate 
the way AutoCAD prompts often display defaults.)
	
7.	 Click the Default box, and enter a hyphen (-). This is the default value for the door-type 
prompt.
Make Your Defaults Useful
If an attribute will contain a number that is to be used later for sorting in a database, use a default 
attribute value such as 000 to indicate the number of digits required. The zeros can also remind 
the user that values less than 100 must be preceded by a leading zero, as in 099.

Creating Attributes |  421  
	
8.	 Click the Justification drop-down list, and select Middle Center. This enables you to 
center the attribute on the circle’s center. The Text Settings group includes several other 
options. Because attributes appear as text, you can apply the same settings to them as you 
would to single-line text.
	
9.	 In the Text Height box, make sure that the value is 1⁄8″ or 0.125. (Metric users should 
enter 0.3.) This makes the attribute text 0.125″ (0.3 cm) high.
	
10.	 Select the Annotative option. Doing so allows the attribute to adjust in size automatically 
according to the annotation scale of the drawing.
	
11.	 In the Insertion Point group, make sure that the Specify On-Screen check box is selected.
	
12.	 Click OK to close the dialog box.
	
13.	 Using the Center osnap, pick the center of the circle. The attribute definition appears at 
the center of the circle (see Figure 12.2).
You’ve just created your first attribute definition. The attribute definition displays its tag in 
all uppercase letters to help you identify it. When you later insert this file into another drawing, 
the tag turns into the value you assign to it when it’s inserted. If you want only one attribute, 
you can stop here and save the file. The next section shows you how to add several more attri-
butes quickly to your drawing.
Copying and Editing Attribute Definitions
Next, you’ll add a few more attribute definitions, but instead of using the Attribute Definition 
dialog box, you’ll make an arrayed copy of the first attribute and then edit the attribute defini-
tion copies. This method can save you time when you want to create several attribute definitions 
that have similar characteristics. By making copies and editing them, you’ll also get a chance to 
see firsthand how to change an attribute definition.
Follow these steps to make copies of the attribute:
	
1.	 Click Copy in the Home tab’s Modify panel or type CO↵ to start the Copy command.
	
2.	 At the Select objects: prompt, select the attribute definition that you just created and 
press ↵ to confirm your selection.
	
3.	 At the Specify base point or [Displacement/mOde] <Displacement>: prompt, 
select the center of the circle.
	
4.	 At the Specify second point or [Array] <user first point as displacement>: 
prompt, type A↵ to enter the Array option.
	
5.	 At the Enter number of items to array: prompt, type 7↵.
	
6.	 At the Specify second point or [Fit]: prompt, point the cursor directly downward 
and enter 0.18↵ (0.432 for metric users). You can use the Polar Tracking tool in the status 
bar to help align the cursor in a downward direction.
	
7.	 The Specify second point: prompt appears again, allowing you to create another set 
of copies. Press ↵ to exit the Copy command.

422  | CHAPTER 12  Using Attributes   
	
8.	 Pan your view upward to center the attribute definition copies in the view. You may also 
need to zoom out to view all the copies.
Now you’re ready to modify the copies of the attribute definitions:
	
1.	 Press Esc twice to clear any selections or commands, and click all the attribute definitions 
just below the original.
	
2.	 Right-click and choose Properties from the context menu to open the Properties palette.
	
3.	 Scroll down the list of properties until you see the Invisible option in the Misc category.
	
4.	 Select Yes from the Invisible option’s drop-down list.
	
5.	 Press the Esc key to clear your selection, and close the Properties palette.
You’ve just turned off Visibility mode for all but the first attribute definition. Now change the 
Tag, Prompt, and Default values for the attribute definitions:
	
1.	 Double-click the attribute definition just below the original one in the center of the circle. 
The Edit Attribute Definition dialog box appears.
	
2.	 Highlight the Tag text box, and type D-SIZE↵.
	
3.	 Highlight the Prompt text box, and type Door size↵.
	
4.	 In the Default text box, type 3′-0″↵. Metric users should type 90↵.
You’ve just learned how to edit an attribute definition. Now you’ll make changes to the other 
attribute definitions:
	
1.	 Continue to edit the rest of the attribute definition properties by using the attribute set-
tings listed in Table 12.1. To do so, click the next attribute definition and repeat steps 2 
through 5 of the preceding exercise, replacing the Tag and Prompt values with those 
shown in Table 12.1. Use a hyphen for the Default values. Also, make sure that all but the 
original attributes have the Invisible option set to Yes.

2.	 When you’ve finished editing the last attribute definition, click OK or press ↵ on your last 
entry.
When you later insert a file or a block containing attributes, the attribute prompts will appear 
in the order in which their associated definitions were created. If the order of the prompts at 
insertion time is important, you can control it by editing the attribute definitions so that their 
creation order corresponds to the desired prompt order. You can also control the order by using 
the Block Attribute Manager, which you’ll look at later in this chapter.

Using Properties to Edit Attribute Definitions
If you prefer, you can use the Properties palette to change an attribute definition’s Tag, Prompt, 
or Default value (shown as Value). These values can be found under the Text group of the palette 
after an attribute definition is selected.
Certiﬁcation
Objective
Turning the Attribute Definitions into a Block
You need to perform one more crucial step before these attribute definitions can be of any use. 
You must turn the attribute definitions into a block, along with the circle:
	
1.	 Click the Create Block tool in the Home tab’s Block panel, or enter B↵.
	
2.	 In the Block Definition dialog box, enter S-DOOR for the name.
	
3.	 In the Base Point group, click the Pick Point tool and then use the Center osnap to select 
the center of the circle.
	
4.	 In the Objects group, click the Select Objects tool and select the circle and all of the 
attributes. Press ↵ when you’ve completed your selection. Leave Convert To Block high-
lighted in the object group.
	
5.	 In the Behavior group, select the Annotative option. This ensures that the block is scaled 
to the appropriate size for the scale of the drawing into which it’s inserted.
	
6.	 Click OK. When the Edit Attribute dialog box opens, click OK to close it.

424  | CHAPTER 12  Using Attributes   
	
7.	 The attributes and the circle are now a block called S-DOOR. You can delete the S-DOOR 
block on your screen. 
Understanding Attribute Definition Modes
The Attribute Definition dialog box includes several choices in the Mode group; you’ve used one of 
these modes to see what it does. You won’t use any of the other modes in this exercise, but here is 
a list describing all of the modes for your reference:
Invisible    Controls whether the attribute is shown as part of the drawing.
Constant    Creates an attribute that doesn’t prompt you to enter a value. Instead, the attri-
bute has a constant, or fixed, value that you give it during creation. Constant mode is used 
when you know that you’ll assign a fixed value to an object. After constant values are set in a 
block, you can’t change them by using the standard set of attribute-editing commands.
Verify    Causes AutoCAD to review the attribute values that you enter at insertion time and 
to ask you whether they’re correct. This option appears only when the Attribute dialog box is 
turned off (the Attdia system variable is set to 0).
Preset    Causes AutoCAD to assign the default value to an attribute automatically when 
its block is inserted. This saves time because a preset attribute won’t prompt you for a value. 
Unlike attributes created in Constant mode, a preset attribute can be edited.
Lock Position    Prevents the attribute from being moved from its original location in the 
block when you’re grip editing.
Multiple Lines    Allows the attribute to contain multiple lines of text, similar to Mtext 
objects. When this option is turned on, you can specify a text boundary width.
With the exception of Invisible mode, none of these modes can be altered after the attribute becomes 
part of a block. Later in this chapter, we’ll show you how to make an invisible attribute visible.
Once you’ve created the block, you can place it anywhere in the drawing using the Insert 
command or the Insert tool in the Home tab’s Block panel. You’ll insert this block in another 
location in the drawing. If you want to use the block in other drawings, you can use the Wblock 
command to save the block as a drawing file, or you can use the DesignCenter™ palette to drag 
and drop blocks from a drawing file. (See Chapter 25, “Managing and Sharing Your Drawings,” 
for more on DesignCenter.)
Inserting Blocks Containing Attributes
In the preceding section, you created a door-type symbol at the desired size for the plotted 
symbol. This size is known as the paper size. Because you turned on the Annotative option for 
the attribute and block, you can use the Annotation Scale setting to have the block insert at the 
appropriate size for the scale of the drawing. The following steps demonstrate the process of 
inserting a block that contains attributes. First, set up your view and annotation scale in prepa-
ration to insert the blocks:
	
1.	 Turn on Attribute Dialog mode by entering Attdia↵1↵ at the Command prompt. This 
enables you to enter attribute values through a dialog box in the next exercise. Otherwise, 
you’d be prompted for the attribute values in the command-line interface.

Creating Attributes |  425  
	
2.	 Select 1⁄8″=1′-0″ (1:100 for metric users) from the Annotation Scale drop-down list in the 
lower-right corner of the AutoCAD window. This ensures that the block appears at the 
proper size for the drawing scale.
	
3.	 Type View↵ to open the View Manager dialog box.
	
4.	 Click the plus sign (+) to the left of the Model Views option to expand the Model Views 
list; then select FIRST from the list, select Set Current, and click OK. This is a view 
that has been saved in this drawing. (See “Taking Control of the AutoCAD Display” in 
Chapter 7, “Mastering Viewing Tools, Hatches, and External References,” for more on sav-
ing views.)
	
5.	 Be sure that the CEILING and FLR-PAT layers are off. Normally in a floor plan the door 
headers aren’t visible anyway, and their appearance will interfere with the placement of 
the door-reference symbol.
	
6.	 Finally, you can begin to place the blocks in the drawing. Click the Insert tool in the 
Home tab’s Block panel, then More Options, or type I↵ to open the Insert dialog box.
	
7.	 Select S-DOOR from the Name drop-down list.
	
8.	 In the Insertion Point group, make sure that the Specify On-Screen option is turned on.
	
9.	 In the Scale group, make sure that the Uniform Scale check box is selected.
	
10.	 In the Rotation group, make sure that the Specify On-Screen option is turned off, and then 
click OK.
	
	 Now you’re ready to place the block in your drawing in the appropriate location and 
enter the attribute values. AutoCAD is waiting for you to select a location for the 
symbol.

426  | CHAPTER 12  Using Attributes   
	
11.	 Click in the doorway of the lower-left unit, near coordinate 41′-3″,72′-4″. Metric users 
should use coordinate 1256,2202. You may want to turn off Osnaps temporarily to avoid 
accidentally clicking an object. When you click the location, the Edit Attributes dialog 
box opens (see Figure 12.4).
Figure 12.4
The Edit Attributes 
dialog box
	
12.	 In the Door Construction box, enter Solid core↵. Note that this is the prompt that you 
created. Note also that the default value is the hyphen that you specified. Attribute data is 
case sensitive, so any text that you enter in all capital letters is stored in all capital letters.
	
13.	 In the Door Material box, change the hyphen to Wood. Continue to change the values for 
each box, as shown in Table 12.2.
	
14.	 When you’ve finished changing values, click OK and the symbol appears. The only attri-
bute that you can see is the one that you selected to be visible: the door type.
	
15.	 Add the rest of the door-type symbols for the apartment entry doors by copying or array-
ing the door symbol that you just inserted. You can use the previously saved views found 
in the Views drop-down list in the View tab’s Views panel to help you get around the 
drawing quickly. Don’t worry that the attribute values aren’t appropriate for each unit; 
you’ll see how to edit the attributes in the next section.

Do the following to insert the room-number block:
	
1.	 Choose Insert from the Home tab’s Block panel, and select S-APART from the Name 
drop-down list.
	
2.	 Make sure that the Specify On-Screen setting is turned on only for the Insertion point, 
and then click OK.
	
3.	 Insert the S-APART block into the lower-left unit. Give the attribute of this block the 
value 116.
	
4.	 Copy or array the S-APART block so that there is one S-APART block in each unit. You’ll 
learn how to modify the attributes to reflect their proper values in the following section. 
Figure 12.6 shows what the view should look like after you’ve entered the door symbols 
and the apartment numbers.

Editing Attributes
Because drawings are usually in flux even after construction or manufacturing begins, you’ll 
eventually have to edit previously entered attributes. In the example of the apartment building, 
many things can change before the final set of drawings is completed.
Attributes can be edited individually or globally—you can edit several occurrences of a par-
ticular attribute tag all at one time. In the following sections, you’ll use both individual and 
global editing techniques to make changes to the attributes that you’ve entered so far. You’ll also 
practice editing invisible attributes.
Editing Attribute Values One at a Time
AutoCAD offers an easy way to edit attributes one at a time through a dialog box. The following 
exercise demonstrates this feature:
	
1.	 Restore the First view by selecting First from the Views flyout in the View tab’s Views 
panel.
	
2.	 Double-click the apartment number attribute in the unit just to the right of the first unit 
in the lower-left corner to open the Enhanced Attribute Editor (see Figure 12.7).

3.	 Change the value in the Value box to 112, and click OK to make the change.
	
4.	 Do this for each room, using Figure 12.8 as a reference for assigning room numbers.
	
5.	 Go back and edit the door number attribute for the S-DOOR blocks. Give each door the 
same number as the room number with which it’s associated. See Figure 12.8 for the room 
numbers.

Editing Attribute Text Formats and Properties
You may have noticed that the Enhanced Attribute Editor in the preceding exercise has three 
tabs: Attribute, Text Options, and Properties. When you double-click a block containing attri-
butes, the Enhanced Attribute Editor dialog box opens at the Attribute tab. You can use the 
other two tabs to control the size, font, color, and other properties of the selected attribute.
The Text Options tab (see Figure 12.9) lets you alter the attribute text style, justification, 
height, rotation, width factor, and oblique angle. (See Chapter 9, “Adding Text to Drawings,” for 
more on these text options.)
Figure 12.9
The Enhanced 
Attribute Editor’s Text 
Options tab
The Properties tab (see Figure 12.10) lets you alter the attribute’s layer, linetype, color, line-
weight (effective only on AutoCAD fonts), and plot-style assignments.

430  | CHAPTER 12  Using Attributes   
Figure 12.10
The Enhanced 
Attribute Editor’s 
Properties tab
In the previous exercise, you edited a block containing a single attribute. Double-clicking a 
block that contains multiple attributes, such as the S-DOOR block, opens the resizable Enhanced 
Attribute Editor dialog box at the Attribute tab. This tab displays all of the attributes, whether 
they’re visible or not, as shown in Figure 12.11. You can then edit the value, formats, and proper-
ties of the individual attributes by highlighting the attribute in the Attribute tab and using the 
other tabs to make changes. The changes you make affect only the attribute that you’ve high-
lighted in the Attribute tab.
Figure 12.11
The Enhanced 
Attribute Editor show-
ing the contents of a 
block that contains 
several attributes
The Enhanced Attribute Editor lets you change attribute values, formats, and properties one 
block at a time. However, as you’ll see in the next section, you can also make changes to several 
attributes at once.
Moving the Location of Attributes
If you want to change the location of individual attributes in a block, you can do so by using grips. 
Click the block to expose the grips, and then click the grip connected to the attribute. Or, if you’ve 
selected several blocks, Shift+click the attribute grips, and then move the attributes to their new 
location. They are still attached to their associated blocks. If you don’t see grips appear for the 
attributes, then the attribute definition has its Lock Position property turned on. This is a setting 
that is available when you create the attribute in the Attribute Definition dialog box.

Editing Attributes |  431  
Making Global Changes to Attribute Values
At times, you’ll want to change the value of several attributes in a file so that they’re all the same 
value. You can use the Edit Attribute Globally option to make global changes to the attribute 
values.
Suppose you decide that you want to change all of the entry doors to a type designated as 
B rather than A. Perhaps door-type A was an input error or type B is better suited for an entry 
door. The following exercise demonstrates how this is done:
	
1.	 Type View↵ to open the View Manager dialog box, and select the view named FOURTH 
from the Views list.
	
2.	 Click the Set Current option, and then click OK.
	
3.	 Pan your view down so that you can see all of the “A” door-reference symbols for this view.
	
4.	 Select Multiple from the Edit Attributes flyout on the Home tab’s Block panel or the Insert 
tab’s Block panel. You can also type -Attedit↵ at the Command prompt. Make sure that 
you include the hyphen at the beginning of the command.
    
	
5.	 At the Edit Attributes one at a time? [Yes/No] <Y>: prompt, enter N↵ for No. 
You see the message Performing global editing of attribute values. This tells 
you that you’re in Global Edit mode.
	
6.	 At the Edit only attributes visible on screen? [Yes/No] <Y>: prompt, 
press ↵. As you can see from this prompt, you have the option to edit all attributes, 
including those out of the view area. You’ll get a chance to work with this option  
later in this chapter.
	
7.	 At the Enter block name specification <*>: prompt, press ↵. Optionally, you can 
enter a block name to narrow the selection to specific blocks.
	
8.	 At the Enter attribute tag specification <*>: prompt, press ↵. Optionally, you 
can enter an attribute tag name to narrow your selection to specific tags.
	
9.	 At the Enter attribute value specification <*>: prompt, press ↵. Optionally, you 
can narrow your selection to attributes containing specific values.
	
10.	 At the Select Attributes: prompt, select the door-type symbol’s attribute value for 
units 103 to 115. You can use a window to select the attributes if you prefer. Press ↵ when 
you’ve finished your selection.
	
11.	 At the Enter string to change: prompt, enter A↵.
	
12.	 At the Enter new string: prompt, enter B↵. The door-type symbols all change to the 
new value.

432  | CHAPTER 12  Using Attributes   
In step 8, you were asked to select the attributes to be edited. AutoCAD limits the changes 
to those attributes that you select. If you know that you need to change every attribute in your 
drawing, you can do so by answering the series of prompts in a slightly different way, as dem-
onstrated in the following exercise:
	
1.	 Try the same procedure again, but this time enter N for the first prompt and again at the 
Edit only attributes visible on screen? [Yes/No] <Y>: prompt (step 4 in the 
previous exercise). The message Drawing must be regenerated afterwards appears. 
The AutoCAD Text Window appears.
	
2.	 Once again, you’re prompted for the block name, the tag, and the value (steps 5, 6, and 7 
in the previous exercise). Respond to these prompts as you did earlier.
	
3.	 You then get the message 128 attributes selected. This tells you the number of attri-
butes that fit the specifications that you just entered.
	
4.	 At the Enter string to change: prompt, enter A↵ to indicate that you want to change 
the rest of the A attribute values.
	
5.	 At the Enter new string: prompt, enter B↵. A series of Bs appears indicating the num-
ber of strings that were replaced.
In this exercise, AutoCAD skipped the Select Attribute: prompt and went directly to the 
String to change: prompt. AutoCAD assumes that you want it to edit every attribute in the 
drawing, so it doesn’t bother asking you to select specific attributes.
Making Invisible Attributes Visible
You can globally edit invisible attributes, such as those in the door-reference symbol, by using 
the tools just described. You may, however, want to be more selective about which invisible 
attribute you want to modify. Optionally, you may want to make invisible attributes temporarily 
visible for other editing purposes.
This exercise shows you how to make invisible attributes visible:
	
1.	 On the Insert tab’s expanded Block panel, click the Retain Display flyout and select 
Display All Attributes. You can also enter Attdisp↵On↵. Your drawing looks like 
Figure 12.12.
Figure 12.12
The drawing with all 
the attributes visible. 
(Door-type symbols 
are so close together 
that they overlap.)

Editing Attributes |  433  
	
2.	 At this point, you could edit the invisible attributes individually as in the first attribute-
editing exercise. For now, set the attribute display back to Normal. On the Insert tab’s 
Expanded Block panel, click the Display All Attributes flyout and select Retain Attribute 
Display. You can also enter Attdisp↵N↵. 
Using Spaces in Attribute Values
At times, you may want the default value to begin with a blank space. This enables you to specify 
text strings more easily when you edit the attribute globally. For example, suppose that you have 
an attribute value that reads 3334333. If you want to change the first 3 in this string of numbers, 
you have to specify 3334 when prompted for the string to change. Then, for the new string, you 
enter the same set of numbers again with the first 3 changed to the new number. If you specify 
only 3 for the string to change, AutoCAD will change all of the 3s in the value. If you start with a 
space, as in _3334333 (we’re using an underscore here only to represent the space; it doesn’t mean 
that you type an underscore character), you can isolate the first 3 from the rest by specifying _3 
as the string to change (again, enter a space instead of the underscore).
You must enter a backslash character (\) before the space in the default value to tell AutoCAD to 
interpret the space literally rather than as a press of the spacebar (which is equivalent to pressing ↵).
You’ve seen the results of the On and Normal options. The Off option makes all attributes 
invisible regardless of the mode used when they were created.
Because the attributes weren’t intended to be visible, they appear to overlap and cover other 
parts of the drawing when they’re made visible. Remember to turn them back off when you’re 
done reviewing them.
Making Global Format and Property Changes to Attributes
While we’re on the subject of global editing, you should know how to make global changes to 
the format and properties of attributes. Earlier, you saw how to make format changes to indi-
vidual attributes using the Enhanced Attribute Editor dialog box. You can also use the Edit 
Attribute dialog box to make global changes, as the following exercise demonstrates.
Follow these steps to make the global changes:
	
1.	 Click the Block Attribute Manager in the Home tab’s expanded Block panel to open the 
Block Attribute Manager dialog box. You can also enter battman↵.
	
2.	 Select S-APART from the Block drop-down list at the top of the dialog box. This list dis-
plays all of the blocks that contain attributes. The only attribute defined for the selected 
block is displayed in the list box below it.

434  | CHAPTER 12  Using Attributes   
	
3.	 Click the attribute value in the list, and click the Edit button to open the Edit Attribute 
dialog box. The Edit Attribute dialog box is nearly identical to the Enhanced Attribute 
Editor that you saw earlier.
	
4.	 Click the Properties tab, select Red from the Color drop-down list, and click OK.
	
5.	 Click OK to exit the Block Attribute Manager dialog box.
The Edit Attribute dialog box that you saw in this exercise offers a slightly different set of 
options from those in the Enhanced Attribute Editor dialog box. In the Attribute tab of the Edit 
Attribute dialog box, you can change some of the mode settings for the attribute, such as visibil-
ity and the Verify and Preset modes. You can also change the Tag, Prompt, and Default values. 
In contrast, the Attribute tab in the Enhanced Attribute Editor dialog box enables you to change 
the attribute value but none of the other attribute properties.
Other Block Attribute Manager Options
The Block Attribute Manager dialog box includes a few other options that weren’t covered 
in the exercises. Here’s a rundown of the Settings, Move Up, Move Down, Remove, and Sync 
buttons:
Settings    Click this button to open the Block Attribute Settings dialog box (see Figure 12.13), 
which lets you control which attribute properties are displayed in the list box of the Block 
Attribute Manager.
The Emphasize Duplicate Tags option highlights duplicate tag names by showing them in 
red. The Apply Changes To Existing References option forces any changes that you make to 
the attribute properties to be applied to existing attributes. If this setting is turned off, you 
have to use the Sync button in the Block Attribute Manager dialog box to update existing 
attributes, and the changes that you make to attribute properties are applied only to new 
attributes added after the change. You can also enter Attsync↵ at the Command prompt to 
synchronize older attributes.
Move Up and Move Down    Clicking these buttons moves a selected attribute up or down 
the list of attributes in the list box. If you move an item down the list, the item changes its 
position when viewed using the Ddatte command or when you’re viewing the attribute’s 
properties in the Enhanced Attribute Editor dialog box. Of course, this has an effect only on 
blocks containing multiple attributes.

Editing Attributes |  435  
Remove    Clicking this button removes the selected attribute from the block, so make sure 
that you mean it before you click.
Sync    This option updates attribute properties such as order, text formatting, mode, and 
so on. It can also be used to update blocks globally that have had new attribute definitions 
added or deleted. It doesn’t affect the individual attribute values.
Redefining Blocks Containing Attributes
Attributes act differently from other objects when they’re included in redefined blocks. Normally, 
blocks that have been redefined change their configuration to reflect the new block definition. 
But if a redefined block contains attributes, the attributes maintain their old properties, including 
their position in relation to other objects in the block. This means that the old attribute position, 
style, and so on don’t change even though you may have changed them in the new definition.
Fortunately, AutoCAD offers a tool that’s specifically designed to let you update blocks with 
attributes. The following steps describe how to update attribute blocks:
	
1.	 Before you use the command to redefine an attribute block, you must create the objects 
and attribute definitions that will make up the replacement attribute block. The simplest 
way to do this is to explode a copy of the attribute block that you want to update. This 
ensures that you have the same attribute definitions in the updated block.
	
2.	 Make your changes to the exploded attribute block.
Explode Attribute Blocks at a 1-to-1 Scale
Before you explode the attribute block copy, be sure that it’s at a 1-to-1 scale. This is important 
because if you don’t use the original size of the block, you could end up with all of your new attribute 
blocks at the wrong size. Also be sure you use a marker device, such as a line, to locate the insertion 
point of the attribute block before you explode it. Doing so will help you locate and maintain the 
original insertion point for the redefined block.
Figure 12.13
The Block Attribute 
Settings dialog box
	
3.	 Type Attredef↵.
	
4.	 At the Enter name of block you wish to redefine: prompt, enter the appropriate name.

436  | CHAPTER 12  Using Attributes   
	
5.	 At the Select objects: prompt, select all of the objects, including the attribute defini-
tions that you want to include in the revised attribute block.
	
6.	 At the Specify insertion base point of new Block: prompt, pick the same location 
used for the original block.
After you pick the insertion point, AutoCAD takes a few seconds to update the blocks. The 
amount of time depends on the complexity of the block and the number of times the block 
occurs in the drawing. If you include a new attribute definition with your new block, it too is 
added to all the updated blocks with its default value. Attribute definitions that are deleted from 
your new definition are removed from all the updated blocks.
You can also use the Refedit command to modify an attribute definition. Click the Edit 
Reference tool in the Insert tab’s expanded Reference panel to modify attribute definitions. After 
editing, you must use the Sync option in the Block Attribute Manager to update all instances of 
the modified block.
Extracting and Exporting Attribute Information
After you enter the attributes in your drawing, you can extract the information contained in 
the attributes and use it to generate reports or to analyze the attribute data in other programs. 
You might, for example, want to keep track of the number and type of doors in your drawing 
through a database manager. This is especially useful if you have a project such as a large hotel 
that contains thousands of doors.
When you extract attribute data, AutoCAD creates a text file. You can choose to export the 
file in either comma-delimited or tab-delimited format. If you have Microsoft Excel or Access 
installed, you can also export the attribute data in a format compatible with these programs.
Performing the Extraction
In the past, extracting the attribute data from a drawing was an error-prone task requiring the 
creation of a template file. This template file had to contain a series of codes that described the 
data that you wanted to extract. AutoCAD has a greatly improved system for attribute data 
extraction in the form of the Data Extraction Wizard. The following exercises will walk you 
through a sample extraction.
Extracting Data in AutoCAD 2017 LT
The AutoCAD LT® software doesn’t offer the Data Extraction Wizard. Instead, you see the more 
simplified Attribute Extraction dialog box, which offers the file-format options (comma- or space-
delimited or DXF output), the output filename, and template file options. For AutoCAD LT, the 
template file is used as an option to filter the attributes.
Using the Data Extraction Wizard
In this first exercise, you’ll explore the Data Extraction Wizard. You can use the 12c-plan.dwg 
sample file if you haven’t done the tutorials from the beginning of the chapter.

Extracting and Exporting Attribute Information |  437  
	
1.	 Go back to the Plan.dwg file, and click Data Extraction in the Insert tab’s Linking & Extraction 
panel. On the Begin page (see Figure 12.14), you can choose to start an extraction from scratch 
or use an existing data-extraction setup that you’ve created from previous extractions.
Figure 12.14
Starting the Data 
Extraction Wizard
	
2.	 Click Next to open the Save Data Extraction As dialog box. This dialog box lets you save 
the data-extraction settings that you’re about to set up in a file with the .dxe filename 
extension. Enter a name, pick a location for your file, and then click Save. The Define Data 
Source page opens (see Figure 12.15).

3.	 Click Settings to view other options. These options (see Figure 12.16) let you further 
refine the content of your extraction.
Figure 12.16
Additional settings
	
4.	 Click Cancel to close the Additional Settings dialog box, and then click Next to open the 
Select Objects page (see Figure 12.17).
Figure 12.17
The Select Objects 
page
Take a moment to study the Select Objects page. It’s the heart of the extraction process. Here 
you select the blocks that contain attributes as well as the specific attributes that you want to 
extract. The list shows all the object types in the drawing. You’ll pare down this list to show 
only the blocks with attributes.

Extracting and Exporting Attribute Information |  439  
Selecting What to Extract
Let’s continue by selecting specific information for the extraction:
	
1.	 Click the Display All Object Types option in the Display Options group to turn it off, and 
make sure that the Display Blocks Only radio button is selected.
	
2.	 Select the Display Blocks With Attributes Only option.
	
3.	 In the Object list, remove the check mark next to all but the S-DOOR item. If you have a 
lot of blocks listed, you can select groups of names from the list by clicking the item at 
the top of the list, then Shift+clicking the item at the bottom. (Click any check box in a 
selected item to remove the check marks.) You can also Ctrl+click in the list to select mul-
tiple, nonconsecutive items.
	
4.	 Click Next to open the Select Properties page (see Figure 12.18), which displays a list of 
the different types of data available for extraction.
Figure 12.18
The Select Properties 
page
	
5.	 In the Category Filter group list on the right, deselect all of the options except Attribute. 
Now you see only the attribute data listed in the Properties panel.
	
6.	 Make sure that each item in the Properties panel is selected. A check mark should appear 
by each item.
	
7.	 Click Next. The Refine Data page appears (see Figure 12.19). Here you can continue to 
filter out data. For example, you can deselect the Show Count Column and Show Name 
Column options because they may be unnecessary for your purpose. You can also get a 
preview of your extracted data by clicking the Full Preview button.

Sorting Columns
If you want to sort your data by column, you can do so by clicking the column title. To change the 
order of the columns, click and drag the column titles horizontally.
Saving the Attribute Data to a File
Now let’s complete the extraction process:
	
1.	 Click Next. The Choose Output page appears (see Figure 12.20). This window lets you 
determine whether to convert the data into a table in the drawing, extract the data as an 
external data file, or do both.

2.	 Select the Output Data To External File option. The box just below the option becomes 
available for input (see Figure 12.21). You can type a location for the external file, or you 
can click the Browse button to browse to a location.
Figure 12.21
Enter the location to 
which you’ll extract 
the data.

3.	 You have the option to extract an XLS, CSV, MDB, or TXT file. You can select the type of 
file to use when you click the Browse button to show where you want the file to go. The 
Browse button opens a Save As dialog box where you can select the type of file to save 
from the File Of Type drop-down list. The default filename is the current drawing file-
name with an .xls extension. Click Save to go to the next step.
	
4.	 Click Next to open the Finish screen (see Figure 12.22). It gives you a brief message 
explaining what to do next.
Figure 12.22
Completing the 
wizard
	
5.	 Click Finish. A file with the current drawing name and the .xls filename extension is 
created. By default, the file is placed in the Documents folder unless you specify a differ-
ent location in step 3.
You now have a file called Plan.xls (12c-plan.xls if you used the sample file) that contains 
the data you saw earlier in the Full Preview window of the Data Extraction Wizard. You can 
open this file with Microsoft Excel.
Extracting Attribute Data to an AutoCAD Table
You may have noticed the option to extract the attribute data to an AutoCAD table in the Choose 
Output screen of the Data Extraction Wizard. This option lets you convert the attribute data 
directly into a table in the current drawing. Besides making it easy to create parts lists or other 
types of tables in your drawing, you get the added benefit of having tables update automatically 
whenever attribute data changes.
If you turn on this option and click Next, you’ll see the Table Style screen (see Figure 12.23) 
instead of the Finish screen.

442  | CHAPTER 12  Using Attributes   
Figure 12.23
Styling your table
From here, you can follow these steps:
	
1.	 Select a table style for the extracted data, enter a title, and click Next. The Finish screen 
opens.
	
2.	 Click Finish. You’re prompted to select a point. Click in the drawing to place the table.
The table may appear at a small size depending on the scale of your drawing. Zoom in to the 
location where you clicked, and you’ll see the table (see Figure 12.24). If you link your exported 
spreadsheet using the Link External Data option in the Refine Data page (Figure 12.19), you will 
see the Data Link icon in the lower-right corner of the AutoCAD window.
Figure 12.24
The table and the Data 
Link icon

The Bottom Line |  443  
With the table in place, you can make changes to the attribute data. When you’re ready to 
update the table, select the table, right-click, and select Update Table Data Links from the context 
menu. The table will be updated to reflect the latest attribute values.

Chapter  13
Copying Existing Drawings from 
Other Sources 
This chapter discusses ways to import existing drawings into the AutoCAD® 2017 software 
through tracing, scaling, and scanning. At times, you’ll want to turn an existing drawing into 
an AutoCAD drawing file. The original drawing may be hand drawn, or it might be a PDF from 
another source. You may be modifying a design that someone else created or converting your 
library of older, hand-drafted drawings for AutoCAD use. Perhaps you want to convert a hand-
drawn sketch into a formal drawing? In addition to importing drawings, you’ll learn how to 
incorporate drawings in Portable Document Format (PDF) into your AutoCAD work.

Methods for Converting Paper Drawings to AutoCAD Files
Tracing with a special piece of hardware known as a digitizing tablet used to be the only way to 
enter a hand-drafted drawing into AutoCAD. However, a traced drawing usually requires some 
cleanup and reorganization.
Scaling a drawing is the method of taking measurements directly from a paper drawing using 
an architect’s or engineer’s scale. It is the most flexible method because you don’t need special 
peripherals to do it and, generally, you’re faced with fewer cleanups afterward. Scaling also facil-
itates the most accurate input of orthogonal lines because you can read dimensions directly from 
the drawing and enter them into AutoCAD. The main drawback with scaling is that if the hand-
drafted drawing does not contain written dimensions, it will be difficult to produce an accurate 
copy. In addition, you must constantly look at the hand-drafted drawing and measure distances 
with a scale, and irregular curves are difficult to scale accurately.
Programs are available that automatically convert an image file into an AutoCAD drawing 
file consisting of lines and arcs. These programs may offer some help, but they require some 
editing and checking for errors.

446  | CHAPTER 13  Copying Existing Drawings from Other Sources   
Scanning, much like tracing, is best used for drawings that are difficult to scale, such as com-
plex topographical maps containing a large number of contours or nontechnical line art, such as 
letterhead and logos.
The simplest method for converting paper drawings, and the method we show you in this 
chapter, is to scan your drawings as image files to be used as a background in AutoCAD. You 
can import your image files into AutoCAD and then trace directly over them. This technique 
allows you to see the original drawing in the AutoCAD window, removing the need to refer 
constantly to documents in other programs.
Importing a Raster Image
If you have a scanner and you’d like to use it to import drawings and other images into 
AutoCAD, you can take advantage of the program’s ability to import raster images. There are 
many reasons why you may want to import a scanned image. In architectural plans, a vicinity 
map is frequently used to show the location of a project. With the permission of its creator, you 
can scan a map into AutoCAD and incorporate it into a cover sheet. That cover sheet can also 
contain other images, such as photographs of the site, computer renderings and elevations of 
the project, and company logos. In architectural projects, scans of older drawings can be used as 
backgrounds for renovation work. This can be especially useful for historical buildings where 
the building’s owner wishes to keep the original architectural detail.
Another reason for importing a scanned image is to use the image as a reference over which 
to trace. You can trace a drawing with a good deal of accuracy by using a scanned image. A 
scanner can be a cost-effective tool for tracing a wide variety of graphic material, or you can use 
your smartphone camera to photograph a drawing. In this section, you’ll learn how you can 
import an image as a background for tracing.
	
1.	 Using the acad.dwt (acadiso.dwt) template, create a new file called Rastertrace.dwg.
	
2.	 Click the External Reference tool on the Insert tab’s Reference panel (see Figure 13.1) to open 
the External Reference palette, which lets you import a full range of raster image files.
Figure 13.1
The External 
References palette 
allows you to import 
raster images.

Importing a Raster Image |  447  
You can also type XR↵. This palette should look familiar from Chapter 7, “Mastering 
Viewing Tools, Hatches, and External References.” It’s the same palette that you used to man-
age external references. Just like external references (Xrefs), raster images are loaded when the 
current file is open but they aren’t stored as part of the current file when it is saved. This helps 
keep file sizes down, but it also means that you need to keep track of inserted raster files. You 
must make sure that they’re kept together with the AutoCAD files in which they’re inserted. 
For example, you might want to keep image files in the same folder as the drawing file to which 
they’re attached.
AutoCAD has a utility called eTransmit that collects AutoCAD files and their related sup-
port files, such as raster images, external references, and fonts, into any folder or drive that you 
specify. See Chapter 25, “Managing and Sharing Your Drawings,” for details.
Another similarity between Xrefs and imported raster images is that you can clip a raster 
image so that only a portion of the image is displayed in your drawing. Portions of a raster file 
that are clipped aren’t stored in memory, so your system won’t get bogged down even if the ras-
ter file is huge.
The following exercises gives you step-by-step instructions for importing a raster file. It also 
lets you see how scanned resolution translates into an image in AutoCAD. This is important if 
you’re interested in scanning drawings for the purpose of tracing over them.
First, you need to set up your drawing for scale and size. If you are using imperial units, set 
up the Rastertrace.dwg file as an architectural drawing with a 1/4″ = 1′ scale on an 8 1/2″×11″. 
Metric users should set up their drawing at a 1:50 scale on an A4 Size sheet. Here are the steps:
	
1.	 If you use Imperial units, set the Limits settings to 0,0 for the lower-left corner and 
528,408 for the upper-right corner.  The Limits settings for metric users should be 0,0 for 
the lower-left corner and 1480,1050 for the upper-right corner.
	
2.	 Make sure that the drawing units type is set to Architectural and the insertion scale is set 
to inches. Metric users should set up their drawing at a 1:50 scale on an A4 size sheet and 
set the insertion scale to Centimeters.
Now you’re ready to import the raster file. Do the following:
	
1.	 Choose Zoom All from the Zoom flyout on the Navigation bar or type Z↵A↵ to make 
sure that the entire area of the drawing limits is displayed on the screen. Ensure the grid 
is switched off.
	
2.	 Draw a line across the screen from coordinates 0,20′ to 64′,20′. Metric users should draw 
the line from 0,600 to 1820,600. Remember that if Dynamic Input is turned on (it’s on by 
default), you need to use the # sign in front of the second coordinate to indicate absolute 
coordinates. You’ll use this line in a later exercise.
	
3.	 Click the line that you just drew, and then select Red from the Object Color drop-down 
list in the Home tab’s Properties panel. This helps make the line more visible. If you 
have the Quick Properties feature turned on, you can select the color from the Quick 
Properties panel.
	
4.	 If you haven’t done so already, click the External References tool in the title bar of the 
Insert tab’s Reference panel to open the External Reference palette.

448  | CHAPTER 13  Copying Existing Drawings from Other Sources   
	
5.	 On the External References palette’s menu bar, click the arrowhead next to the Attach 
DWG tool and then choose Attach Image from the flyout.
	
	 In the Select Reference File dialog box, locate and select the raster1.jpg project file. You 
can see a preview of the file on the right side of the dialog box.
	
6.	 Click Open to open the Attach Image dialog box (see Figure 13.2).
Figure 13.2
The Attach Image 
­dialog box
	
7.	 Uncheck the Specify On-Screen option in the Insertion Point group to accept the 0,0,0 
coordinates.
	
8.	 Click OK, and then, at the Specify scale factor <1>: prompt, use the cursor to 
scale the image so that it fills about half of the screen, as shown in Figure 13.3. The  
raster1.jpg filename appears in the External References palette.

Working with a Raster Image |  449  
Working with a Raster Image
Once you’ve imported a raster image, you can begin to work with it in a variety of ways. You 
can resize the image to suit your needs and even adjust its size to a particular scale. Raster 
images can be made to overlap AutoCAD objects, or you can have raster images appear in the 
background. There are also rudimentary controls for brightness, contrast, and transparency. In 
the following sections, you’ll continue to use the image that you attached to your drawing to 
explore some of these options.
Tips for Importing Raster Images
When you scan a document into your computer, you get a raster image file. Unlike AutoCAD files, 
raster image files are made up of a matrix of colored pixels that form a picture, which is why raster 
images are also sometimes called bitmaps. Vector files, like those produced by AutoCAD, are made 
up of instructions to draw lines, arcs, curves, and circles. The two formats, raster and vector, are 
so different that it’s difficult to convert one format to the other accurately. It’s easier to trace a 
raster file in AutoCAD than it is to try to use a computer program to make the conversion for you.
But even tracing a raster image file can be difficult if the image is of poor quality. Having worked 
with scanned images in AutoCAD for a variety of projects, we’ve discovered that you can make your 
work a lot easier by following a few simple rules:
◆
◆
Scan in your drawing using a grayscale or color scanner, or convert your black-and-white 
scanned image to grayscale using your image-editing software. This will give you more control 
over the appearance of the image once it’s in AutoCAD.
◆
◆
Use an image-editing program, such as Adobe Photoshop or your scanner software, to clean up 
unwanted gray or spotted areas in the file before importing it into AutoCAD.
◆
◆
If your scanner software or image-editing program has a “de-speckle” or “de-spot” feature, use 
it. It can help clean up your image and ultimately reduce the raster image’s file size.
◆
◆
Scan at a reasonable resolution. Scanning at 150 dpi to 200 dpi may be more than adequate.
◆
◆
If you plan to make heavy use of raster imports, upgrade your computer to the fastest processor 
and install as much memory as you can afford.
The raster import commands can incorporate paper maps or plans into 3D AutoCAD drawings for 
presentations. We know of one architectural firm that produces impressive presentations with 
little effort by combining 2D scanned images with 3D massing models for urban design studies. 
(A massing model shows only the rough outline of buildings without giving too much detail, thus 
showing the general scale of a project without being too fussy.)
Scaling a Raster Image
The raster1.jpg file was scanned as a grayscale image at 100 dpi. This shows that you can get a 
reasonable amount of detail at a fairly low scan resolution.

Now suppose that you want to trace over this image to start an AutoCAD drawing. The first 
thing that you should do is scale the image to the appropriate size. You can scale an image file to 
full size. Try the following steps to see how you can begin the process:
	
1.	 Choose Zoom Extents from the Zoom flyout on the Navigation bar, or type Z↵E↵. 
You may also want to pan the view or move the Xref palette to get a clear view of the 
drawing.
	
2.	 Turn on Polar Tracking or Ortho mode, and then click Scale on the Home tab’s Modify 
panel.
	
3.	 Click the edge of the raster image to select it.
	
4.	 Press ↵ to finish your selection.
	
5.	 At the Specify base point: prompt, click the X in the lower-left corner of the image.
	
6.	 At the Specify scale factor or [Copy/Reference]: prompt, enter R↵ to use the 
Reference option.
	
7.	 At the Specify reference length <0′ -1″>: prompt, type @↵. This tells AutoCAD that 
you want to use the last point selected as one end of the reference length. After you enter 
the @ symbol, you’ll see a rubber-banding line emanating from the X.
	
8.	 At the Specify second point: prompt, click the X at the lower-right corner of the 
image.
	
9.	 At the Specify new length or [Points] <0′ -1″ >: prompt, enter 44′↵. Metric users 
should enter 1341↵. The image enlarges. Remember that this reference line is 44′, or 1341 
cm, in length.
The image is now scaled properly for the plan it portrays. You can proceed to trace over the 
image. You can also place the image on its own layer and turn it off from time to time to check 
your trace work. Even if you don’t trace the scanned floor plan line for line, you can read the 
dimensions of the plan from your computer monitor instead of having to go back and forth 
between measuring the paper image and drawing the plan on the computer.
Controlling Object Visibility and Overlap with Raster Images
With the introduction of raster image support, AutoCAD inherited a problem that’s fairly com-
mon to programs that use such images: Raster images obscure other objects that were placed 
previously. The image you imported in the previous exercise, for example, obscures the line you 
drew when you first opened the file. In most cases, this overlap isn’t a problem. However, in 
some situations, you’ll want AutoCAD vector objects to overlap an imported raster image. An 
example is a civil-engineering drawing showing an AutoCAD drawing of a new road superim-
posed over an aerial view of the location for the road.
Paint and page-layout programs usually offer a “to front/to back” tool to control the  
overlap of objects and images. AutoCAD offers the Draworder command. Here’s how it  
works:
	
1.	 Click Zoom Extents on the Navigation bar or type Z↵E↵ to get an overall view of 
the image.

Working with a Raster Image |  451  
	
2.	 Choose the Bring Above Objects tool from the Draworder flyout on the Home tab’s 
expanded Modify panel.
Draworder ﬂyout
	
3.	 At the Select objects: prompt, select the horizontal line that you drew when you first 
opened the file.
	
4.	 If there are other objects in the drawing that you want to “bring above objects,” you can 
select them as well. Press ↵ to finish your selection.
	
5.	 At the Select reference objects: prompt, click the edge of the raster image of the 
utility room and then press ↵.
The drawing regenerates, and the entire line appears, no longer obscured by the raster image.
Masking an Area of an Image
You can mask out areas of an imported raster image by creating a solid hatch area and using the 
Draworder command to place the solid hatch on top of the raster image. Such masks can be help-
ful as backgrounds for text that must be placed over a raster image. You can also use the Wipeout 
command (select Wipeout on the Home tab’s expanded Draw panel) to mask areas of a drawing.
The Draworder tool that you just used has nine options in the Draworder flyout on the Home 
tab’s Modify panel:
Bring To Front    Places an object or a set of objects at the top of the draw order for the entire 
drawing. The effect is that the objects are completely visible.
Send To Back    Places an object or a set of objects at the bottom of the draw order for the 
entire drawing. The effect is that other objects in the drawing may obscure those objects.
Bring Above Objects    Places an object or a set of objects above another object in the draw 
order. This has the effect of making the first set of objects appear above the second selected 
object.
Send Under Objects    Places an object or a set of objects below another object in the draw 
order. This has the effect of making the first set of objects appear underneath the second 
selected object.

452  | CHAPTER 13  Copying Existing Drawings from Other Sources   
Bring Text To Front    Automatically brings all text in a drawing in front of all objects.
Bring Dimensions To Front    Automatically brings all dimensions in a drawing in front of 
all objects.
Bring Leaders To Front    Automatically brings all dimension leaders in a drawing in front of 
all objects.
Bring All Annotations To Front    Automatically brings all annotation objects in a drawing, 
including dimensions, in front of all objects.
Send Hatch To Back    Automatically sends all hatch patterns in a drawing behind other 
objects.
You can also use the DR keyboard shortcut to issue the Draworder command. If you do this, 
you see these prompts:
Select objects:
Enter object ordering option [Above objects/Under objects/Front/Back]<Back>:
You must then select the option by typing the capitalized letter of the option.
Although this section discussed the Draworder tools in relation to raster images, they can 
also be invaluable in controlling visibility of line work in conjunction with hatch patterns and 
solid fills. See Chapter 7 for a detailed discussion of the Draworder tools and hatch patterns.
Adjusting Brightness, Contrast, and Fade
AutoCAD offers a tool that enables you to adjust the brightness, contrast, and fade of a raster 
image. Try making some adjustments to the raster image of the utility room in the following 
exercise:
	
1.	 Click the edge of the raster image. The Image tab appears in the Ribbon (see Figure 13.4).
Figure 13.4
The Image tab appears 
when you select a  
raster image.
	
2.	 In the Adjust panel of the Image tab, click and drag the Fade slider to the right so that it’s 
near the middle of the slider scale, or enter 50 in the Fade box to the right of the slider. 
The sample image fades to the AutoCAD background color as you move the slider.
	
3.	 Press the Esc key to unselect the raster image. The Image tab closes.
	
4.	 Save the file as Rasterimport.dwg.
You can adjust the brightness and contrast by using the other two sliders in the Adjust panel 
of the Image tab.
By using the Image tab in conjunction with image clipping, you can create special effects. 
Figure 13.5 shows an aerial view of downtown San Francisco with labels. This view consists of 

Working with a Raster Image |  453  
two copies of the same raster image. One copy serves as a background, which was lightened 
using the method demonstrated in the previous exercise. The second copy is the darker area 
of the image with a roughly triangular clip boundary applied. You might use this technique to 
bring focus to a particular area of a drawing that you’re preparing for a presentation.
Figure 13.5
Two copies of the same 
image can be combined 
to emphasize a portion 
of the drawing.
If the draw order of objects is incorrect after you open a file or perform a Pan or Zoom, issue 
a Regen to recover the correct draw-order view.
In addition to the tools in the Adjust panel, there are several tools in the Image tab that can 
be used to modify raster images. Table 13.1 gives you a rundown of their function.

454  | CHAPTER 13  Copying Existing Drawings from Other Sources   
Clipping a Raster Image
In Chapter 7, you saw how you could clip an external reference object so that only a portion of it 
appears in the drawing. You can clip imported raster images in the same way. Just as with Xrefs, 
you can create a closed outline of the area that you want to clip, or you can specify a simple rect-
angular area.
Images and the External References Palette
The External References palette that you saw in Chapter 7 helps you manage your imported image 
files. It’s especially helpful when you have a large number of images in your drawing. You can control 
imported images in a way similar to how you control Xrefs; you can temporarily unload images (to 
help speed up the editing of AutoCAD objects) and reload, detach, and relocate raster image files. 
See Chapter 7 for a detailed description of these options.
In the following exercise, you’ll try the Clip command to control the display of the raster 
image.
	
1.	 Select the Clip tool from the Insert tab’s Reference panel, or type Clip↵.
	
2.	 At the Select object to clip: prompt, click the edge of the raster image.
	
3.	 At the Enter image clipping option [ON/OFF/Delete/New boundary]<New>: 
prompt, press ↵ to create a new boundary.
	
4.	 At the [Select polyline/Polygonal/Rectangular/Invert clip] <Rectangular>: 
prompt, enter P↵ or click Polygonal in the command-line interface to draw a polygonal 
boundary.
	
5.	 Select the points shown in the top image in Figure 13.6 and then press ↵. The raster 
image is clipped to the boundary that you created, as shown in the second image in 
Figure 13.6.
As the prompt in step 3 indicates, you can turn the clipping off or on, or you can delete an 
existing clipping boundary through the Clip Image option.
After you clip a raster image, you can adjust the clipping boundary by using its grips:
	
1.	 Click the boundary edge of the raster image to expose its grips.
	
2.	 Click a grip in the upper-right corner, as shown in the bottom image in Figure 13.6.
	
3.	 Drag the grip up and to the right, and then click a point. The image adjusts to the new 
boundary.
	
4.	 You can save the Rasterimport.dwg file for future reference and exit the file.

In addition to hiding portions of a raster image that are unimportant to you, clipping an 
image file reduces the amount of RAM the raster image uses during your editing session. 
AutoCAD loads only the visible portion of the image into RAM and ignores the rest.

456  | CHAPTER 13  Copying Existing Drawings from Other Sources   
Turning Off the Frame, Adjusting Overall Quality,  
and Controlling Transparency
You can make three other adjustments to your raster image: frame visibility, image quality, and 
image transparency.
By default, a raster image displays an outline, or a frame. In many instances, this frame can 
detract from your drawing. You can turn off image frames globally by typing Imageframe↵ 0 ↵. 
This sets the Imageframe setting to 0, which turns off the frame visibility. If it’s set to 1, the 
frame is made visible. You can also set it to 2, which leaves the frame visible but doesn’t plot it 
(see Figure 13.7).
Figure 13.7
A raster image with the 
frame on (top) and off 
(bottom)
Frames can also be controlled through the Frame flyout on the Insert tab’s Reference panel. 
If you turn off a raster image’s frame, you can’t click the image to select it for editing, although 
you can still select an image using the All, Previous, or Last selection option (see Chapter 2, 
“Creating Your First Drawing,” for more on selection options). To make a raster image selectable 

Working with a Raster Image |  457  
with your mouse, turn on the image frame using the Display And Plot Frames or the Display 
But Don’t Plot Frames option.
If your drawing doesn’t require the highest-quality image, you can set the image quality 
to Draft mode. You may use Draft mode when you’re tracing an image or when the image is 
already of a high quality. To set the image quality, enter Imagequality↵ and then enter H for 
High mode (high quality) or D for Draft mode. In Draft mode, your drawing will regenerate 
faster.
High mode softens the pixels of the raster image, giving the image a smoother appearance. 
Draft mode displays the image in a raw, pixelated state. If you look carefully at the regions 
between the motorcycle and the background in the second image in Figure 13.8, you’ll see that 
the edges of the motorcycle appear a bit jagged. The top image in Figure 13.8 uses the High set-
ting to soften the edges of the motorcycle. You may need to look closely to see the difference.
Figure 13.8
A close-up of a raster 
image with quality set 
to High (top) and Draft 
(bottom)
Finally, you can control the transparency of raster image files that allow transparent pixels. 
Some file formats, such as GIF (Global Interchange Format), allow you to set a color in the image 
to be transparent (usually the background color). Most image-editing programs support this 
format because it’s a popular one used on web pages.
When you turn on the Transparency setting, objects normally obscured by the background 
of a raster image may show through. Select the raster image and then, in the Image tab’s 
Options panel, select Background Transparency. You can also right-click and select Image ➢ 
Transparency and then select On or Off from the Dynamic Input menu. In addition, you can enter 
Transparency↵ and then select the raster image that you want to make transparent. Press ↵, and 
then enter On or Off, depending on whether you want the image to be transparent. Unlike the 
Frame and Quality options, Transparency works on individual objects rather than operating 
globally.
The Properties palette offers many of the same adjustments described in this section. You can 
use it for quick access to the Transparency setting and other raster image settings.

458  | CHAPTER 13  Copying Existing Drawings from Other Sources   
Working with PDF Files
If you’re using a computer as part of your daily work activity, you will encounter a PDF document. 
PDFs have become a part of everyday life, so it’s no surprise that AutoCAD offers a fair amount of 
support for PDFs.
In the following sections, you’ll learn how to import a PDF document into AutoCAD and 
how you can control various properties of the document, such as fading and the ability to snap 
to objects in the PDF.
Importing a PDF
To import a PDF, you use a method similar to the one you used earlier to import an image file. In 
fact, you could perform all of the steps in the exercise in the section “Importing a Raster Image” 
earlier in this chapter using a PDF file instead of the raster1.jpg file. You just need to know 
how to set up the Select Reference File dialog box to allow you to locate PDFs.
Try the following to see how to import a PDF:
	
1.	 Open a new file using the acad.dwt file as a template.
	
2.	 Use the Save As option in the Application menu, and save the drawing as PDFunderlay.dwg.
	
3.	 Click the Attach tool in the Insert tab’s Reference panel, or type attach↵ to open the Select 
Reference File dialog box.
	
4.	 In the Files Of Type drop-down list at the bottom of the dialog box, select PDF Files (*.pdf).
Can’t Get Transparency to Work?
The Transparency command does not work on all types of images. As mentioned, it works with 
GIF files that have the background removed. You can also use a bitonal image, meaning the image 
must have only two colors, typically black and white. A bitonal image is also referred to as a bitmap 
image in Photoshop. It cannot be grayscale or multicolor. PDF files that have been exported from 
AutoCAD may also work with the Transparency command.
You can put images that do not work with the Transparency command on a layer with transparency 
set to a value greater than 0. Transparency can also be set using the Transparency slider in the 
Home tab’s Properties panel. To use the Transparency slider, select the object, such as an image or 
hatch pattern, and then adjust the slider to achieve the level of transparency that you want. You 
can start at 50 and adjust downward or upward.
Note that if you want your image to print or plot with the transparency in effect, you must select 
the Plot Transparency option in the Plot or Page Setup dialog box.

Working with PDF Files |  459  
	
5.	 Locate and select the SampleImport.pdf file.
	
6.	 Click Open to open the Attach PDF Underlay dialog box (see Figure 13.9). Notice that you 
have an option to select a specific page of the PDF document if you are opening a multi-
page PDF.
Figure 13.9
The Attach PDF 
Underlay dialog box
	
7.	 Click page 2 of the page preview on the left side of the dialog box.
	
8.	 Make sure the Specify On-screen options are selected for Scale and Insertion Point.
	
9.	 Click OK and then, at the Specify insertion point: prompt, place the outline of the 
drawing so that it is roughly centered in the drawing area and click.
	
10.	 At the Specify scale factor or [Unit] <1.0000>: prompt, use the cursor to scale 
the image so that it fills the screen (see Figure 13.10). Page 2 of the SampleImport.pdf file 
appears in the drawing.

460  | CHAPTER 13  Copying Existing Drawings from Other Sources   
Scaling and Osnaps with PDFs
In an earlier exercise, you were able to scale an image file, though you had to use a reference line 
that was already in the image file to scale the drawing roughly to its proper size in AutoCAD. 
If you have a PDF that was created from an AutoCAD file or from another vector-based program, 
you can use osnaps to select exact locations in the PDF.
Try the following exercise to see how you can use osnaps to select geometry in the PDF. You’ll 
scale the drawing so that the width of the stairs conforms to the known distance for that area.
First make sure the Snap To Underlays feature is turned on:
	
1.	 In the Insert tab’s Reference panel, click the Snap To Underlays tool.
	
2.	 Select the Snap To Underlays ON option.
Now you are ready to scale the PDF drawing:
	
1.	 Click the Scale tool in the Home tab’s Modify panel or type SC↵.
	
2.	 Select the attached PDF file and press ↵.
	
3.	 At the Specify base point: prompt, turn on the osnaps and select the left endpoint of 
the horizontal line near the top of the drawing, as shown in Figure 13.11.
Figure 13.11
Selecting the first end-
point of the line for the 
Scale command
Click this endpoint.
	
4.	 At the Specify scale factor or [Copy/Reference]: prompt, type R↵ to use the 
Reference option.
	
5.	 At the Specify Reference length <1.0000>: prompt, click the same endpoint again or 
type @↵.
	
6.	 At the Specify second point: prompt, click the endpoint of the line shown in Figure 13.12.

Working with PDF Files |  461  
Figure 13.12
Selecting the second 
endpoint of the line for 
the Scale command
Click this endpoint.
	
7.	 At the Specify new length or [Points] <1.0000>: prompt, enter 196, which is the 
inch equivalent of 16′-4″.
	
8.	 In the Navigation bar, choose the Zoom Extents option from the Zoom flyout to center the 
drawing in the drawing area.
In this exercise, you were able to use object snaps directly on the imported PDF drawing. You 
may have noticed that a tooltip appeared with the message “PDF (approximate): Endpoint.” The 
PDF drawing is not an exact representation of the original drawing, so the tooltip reminds you 
that even though you are using an osnap to select a location in the drawing, it is not an exact 
location as it would be in an AutoCAD file.
Controlling the PDF Display
You can take advantage of a number of other features of a PDF file. Just as with a typical Xref or 
image file, you can fade the PDF so that it appears as a background image. You can also use the 
Clip feature that you saw earlier in this chapter to clip the PDF to a specific area.
You can gain access to these and other PDF display features through the PDF Underlay 
Ribbon tab. This tab appears automatically whenever you select an attached PDF drawing. Click 
the PDF drawing of the lobby, and you’ll see the PDF Underlay tab appear in the Ribbon (see 
Figure 13.13).
Figure 13.13
The panels on the 
PDF Underlay 
Ribbon tab
Table 13.2 describes the tools in the PDF Underlay Ribbon tab. The tools are fairly self-
explanatory. For example, the tools in the Adjust panel let you control the fade and contrast of 
the PDF drawing. The Display In Monochrome option displays a color PDF in monochrome.

One option that you’ll want to take a closer look at is the Edit Layers tool in the PDF Layers 
panel. If the source PDF is a drawing that contains layers, you can control the visibility of those 
layers using this tool. With an imported PDF selected, click the Edit Layers tool to open the 
Underlay Layers dialog box (see Figure 13.14).

Working with PDF Files |  463  
You can turn the visibility of a layer on or off by clicking the light bulb icon to the left of it in 
the list. For example, if you turn off the WALL layer in the Underlay Layers dialog box for the 
SampleImport example, the PDF drawing will change so that the walls will not be shown (see 
Figure 13.15).
Figure 13.15
The imported PDF  
with the WALL layer 
turned off
Adding Layers to Your PDF
If you want to create a PDF with layers, you can do so by printing a drawing to a PDF file using the 
AutoCAD DWG To PDF.pc3 Printer/Plotter option. You can find this option in the Name drop-
down list in the Page Setup or Plot dialog box. (See Chapter 8, “Introducing Printing, Plotting, 
and Layouts,” for more on the Name drop-down list.) You don’t have to do anything special. If 
your drawing contains layers, the DWG to PDF.pc3 plotter will include them in the PDF. Adobe 
Acrobat 6.0 and later will also include layers when used from AutoCAD.
Importing a PDF as an AutoCAD Drawing
PDFs can contain both raster and vector data. If you have a PDF that is a line drawing or 3D 
model, there is a good chance that it is stored in a vector format. PDFs containing vector infor-
mation and text can be imported into AutoCAD as an AutoCAD drawing. For example, a PDF 
floor plan produced from AutoCAD can be imported back into AutoCAD and then edited as a 
normal AutoCAD drawing, as the following exercise will show:
	
1.	 Click the Open icon in the Quick Access toolbar, and open the PDFimport.dwg file from 
the samples folder. This is just a blank file with the units set to Architectural.
	
2.	 Open the Application menu by clicking the AutoCAD icon in the upper-left corner of the 
AutoCAD window, and then select Import > PDF.  The cursor will change to a pickbox. 
At the Select underlay or [File] <File>: prompt, press ↵.
	
3.	 In the Import file dialog box, browse to the Chapter 13 sample files and open the 
PDFvector.pdf file. The Import PDF dialog box appears (see Figure 13.16). Here you have 
a number of options that give you control over how the file is imported. For this exercise, 
you’ll use the default settings.

464  | CHAPTER 13  Copying Existing Drawings from Other Sources   
Figure 13.16
The Import PDF 
dialog box
	
4.	 Click OK. The PDF is imported into the current file as an AutoCAD drawing.
	
5.	 Click any object, and you’ll notice that individual objects are selectable.
	
6.	 Click a room label. You’ll notice that the text has been converted to lines.
	
7.	 Zoom into the left side of the drawing to enlarge the C and D grid lines.
	
8.	 Click the Measure tool in the Home tab’s Utilities panel, and then select the endpoints of 
the grid lines between grids C and D. Notice that measurement is the same as the dimen-
sioned distance.
This exercise demonstrates a few features of the Import PDF feature. In step 3, you discov-
ered that the room label was imported as lines. For drawings that contain TrueType fonts, you 
have the option to import text in the original font. This will enable you to edit the text using the 
AutoCAD text editing tools. In step 5, you saw that the drawings imported to scale. The distance 
between grid lines C and D measured the same as the dimensioned distance.
The PDFvector.dwg file was created using the AutoCAD PDF (High Quality Print) .pc3 
printer option. In addition, it was plotted from model space. Had it been printed from a layout, 
measurements taken in the drawing would reflect the print size and not a full, 1-to-1 scale 
drawing. For example, measuring the distance between grid lines C and D would have returned 
a distance in inches as if measured from a scale paper drawing.
Be aware that PDF plots created from model space will lose some accuracy, even though 
they will import to a 1-to-1 scale. In addition, PDF drawings from other vector programs may 
not import to scale, in which case you can use the Scale option in the Import PDF dialog box to 
adjust the scale of the imported drawing. Or you can just scale the drawing after it is imported 
using the methods described earlier in this chapter.

Coordinating Geographic Locations |  465  
Let’s take a look at the options in the Import PDF dialog box shown in Figure 13.16. These 
options enable you to control how the PDF is imported. You can set whether raster data is 
imported into the drawing or, if the PDF contains layers, how the layers are translated. You can 
also control how types of geometry are converted. For example, in the Import Options section, 
you can set the PDF to be imported as a block or convert solid fills in the PDF to hatches. The 
options are fairly self-explanatory, but a few may need a bit more explanation.
If the PDF file that you want to import contains multiple pages, you can select a page using 
the Page option just above and to the left of the preview image. You can also get a matrix view  
of the pages by selecting the thumbnail toggle above and to the right of the preview. The Options 
button in the lower-left of the dialog box opens the Options dialog box to the File tab, where you 
can set the location for the storage of any raster images that are imported. (See Appendix B for 
more on the Files tab of the Options dialog box.)
Convert a PDF Underlay into AutoCAD Objects
If you already have a vector PDF inserted as an underlay into your drawing, you can convert part 
or all of the underlay into AutoCAD Objects by using the “Import as Objects” tool found in the 
PDF Underlay tab (Figure 13.13) or by using the Select Underlay option in the previous exercise. 
For example, you can click the PDF underlay  you inserted in the PDFunderlay.dwg file exercise and 
then click the Import as Objects tool in the PDF Underlay tab. You are prompted to select an area 
to import. Once selected, you have the option to keep the PDF underlay, detach it, or unload it. 
Once you’ve selected your option, the selected portion of the PDF is converted to AutoCAD objects, 
which you can edit using the usual editing tools.
Coordinating Geographic Locations
Architects and engineers use geolocation and mapping tools to help place their projects on their 
chosen sites. Usually, a program like Google Earth or another mapping program is used to get 
an idea of the site conditions. Street views from Google Maps can help designers get a better 
idea of how their buildings will appear from a street level.
Geolocation tools can help the designer coordinate information between the different disci-
plines involved in a project. Designers can place their projects over an aerial view of a site and 
coordinate the orientation and location of key features of their design.
The Geographic Location feature in AutoCAD allows you to place an accurately scaled map 
or aerial view in your drawing. You can then draw your designs directly on the map or import 
an existing AutoCAD design. Unlike an imported image, the Geographic Location map will 
always remain in the background so you don’t have to be concerned about an overlapping 
image. You can also easily switch between a map view and an aerial view as the need arises.
Start an Autodesk® 360 Account to Use Geographic Location
Before you start to work with the Geographic Location feature, you will need to create an 
Autodesk 360 account and be signed in. Click the Sign In drop-down list in the InfoCenter, and 
select Sign In to Autodesk 360. A browser appears that takes you to the Autodesk 360 website 
where you can sign up for a free account. If you already have an account, just sign in.

Let’s take a look at how the Geographic Location feature works:
	
1.	 In a new file, select the Insert Ribbon tab, and in the Location panel, click Set Location, 
and select From Map.
	
2.	 You will see a message asking “Do you want to use Online Map Data?” Click Yes.
	
3.	 The Geographic Location dialog box appears (see Figure 13.17). Here, you can enter an 
address, a location name, or the latitude and longitude of a site.
Figure 13.17
The Geographic 
Location dialog box
	
4.	 Enter a location name or address in the text box at the top of the dialog box, and click the 
magnifying glass icon. For this exercise, enter Fort Mason, San Francisco. The dialog box 
changes to show an aerial view map of Fort Mason. In the left side, you see a list keyed to 
numbered locations on the map (see Figure 13.18).
	
5.	 Click the Drop Marker Here button just under the first item in the list: Fort Mason, San 
Francisco, CA 94123. A red marker appears in the map.
	
6.	 Click the Next button at the bottom of the dialog box.
	
7.	 At the next dialog box, you are asked to select a coordinate system. Select NSRS11.SFO-
CS13F, which is at the top of the list, and then select Next. The dialog box closes, and you 
see the prompt
Select a point for the location <0.0000,0.0000.0.0000>:
	
8.	 Click a point at the center of the drawing area. The point that you select corresponds to the 
red marker that appeared in the Geographic Location dialog box. You see the next prompt:
Specify the north direction angle or [First point]<90>:

Coordinating Geographic Locations |  467  
	
9.	 Click a point directly above the first point that you selected to indicate a north direction 
pointing up. An aerial view of the northern tip of San Francisco appears (see Figure 13.19).
Figure 13.18
An aerial view  
of your selected  
location appears in 
the dialog box.

10.	 Once the aerial view appears in the drawing, you can zoom in and out using the stan-
dard AutoCAD view tools. Use the wheel of your mouse to zoom in to get a closer look at 
Fort Mason.
You may notice that the Geolocation Ribbon tab appears with a set of options (see Figure 13.20). 
These options allow you to modify your geolocation view. For example, the Map Aerial flyout lets 
you switch to a map view and back again.
Figure 13.20
The Geolocation 
Ribbon tab panels
Try it in the following exercise:
	
1.	 In the Online Map panel of the Geolocation tab, click the Map Aerial flyout and select 
Map Road. The view changes to show a graphic representation of the roads.
	
2.	 In the Online Map panel of the Geolocation tab, click the Map Road flyout and select Map 
Aerial. The view changes back to the aerial view.
Making Adjustments to the Map
As you can see from the previous steps, you can easily switch between an aerial view and a map 
view. You also have the option to show a combined aerial and map view using the Map Hybrid 
option or to turn the geolocation background off entirely using the Map Off option.
Options on the Location Panel
Besides controlling the geolocation background image, the Geolocation Ribbon tab lets you 
make other adjustments to your background. Here is a rundown of the tools and features that 
you’ll find in the Location panel:
Edit Location    Offers two options: From Map and From File. If you select From Map, the 
Geographic Location dialog box opens, enabling you to enter new location data. The From 

Coordinating Geographic Locations |  469  
File option lets you find a location using a KML or KMZ file. KML files are used with Google 
Earth to enable location, tagging, and placement of 3D models on a Google Earth map. KMZ 
files are archive files similar to zip files, and they contain KML files and any support files 
needed for the KML file.
Reorient Marker    Lets you reposition the original marker location and reset the north 
orientation. You are asked to select a point for the location of the address or latitude-longitude 
position, and then you are asked for the north orientation.
Remove Location    Lets you remove the geolocation map from the drawing. When you click 
this tool, you are asked if you want to remove the location data and the assigned coordinate 
system from the current drawing.
Options on the Tools Panel
The Map Tools palette in the Geolocation Ribbon panel offers tools that let you mark locations 
in the geolocation background. You’ve already seen what the Map Aerial and Map Road options 
do. The following list describes the other tools in this panel:
Locate Me    Lets you find your location on the aerial view or map. This feature is available 
only if your computer is equipped with a GPS or other feature that is able to provide your 
location data.
Mark Position    Lets you place a marker in the aerial or map view. The following options 
are available in the flyout: The Lat-Long option lets you specify the latitude and longitude for 
the marker location. The My Location option is similar to the Locate Me tool, and it places a 
marker at your current location. The Point option enables you to point to a location to place 
a marker. Once you click a location, you are prompted to enter a text description for the 
location. AutoCAD opens the Text Editor Ribbon tab, giving you the ability to format your 
text description.
Options on the Online Map Panel
The Online Map panel in the Geolocation Ribbon panel gives you control over the map’s 
appearance. It also lets you capture a portion of the map:
Map Aerial    Lets you select from a number of display options. You can choose to display a 
map (see Figure 13.21 later in this chapter) or a combined map and aerial view. You can also 
turn the map off completely.
Capture Area    Lets you place a selection rectangle over a portion of the displayed map. You 
can then copy the selected area to the Clipboard. You can also capture the entire map that 
is in the display. Once you place a selection rectangle, the Map Image Ribbon tab appears, 
enabling you to adjust brightness, contrast, and fade of the selected area. You can also con-
trol the quality of the image. Note that you can select the type of image that you want from  
the Map flyout to the far left of the ribbon. You have the choice of Map Aerial, Map Road, 
and Map Hybrid.
The captured map area is stored with the drawing and is not dependent on an Internet 
connection. It can also be moved, rotated, or resized in a manner similar to an imported 
raster image. The captured area will also appear in the Layout viewports.

470  | CHAPTER 13  Copying Existing Drawings from Other Sources   
Finding Measurements and Distances
In the first Geolocation exercise, you may have noticed the Drawing Unit option in the 
Geographic Location dialog box. By default, this option is set to inches, but you can set it to feet, 
meters, miles, or some other unit of measure. By accepting the default inches for the Drawing 
Unit option, any measurements you take on the map will return distances using inches as the 
drawing unit. If the unit style of your drawing is set to Architectural, distances will be dis-
played in feet and inches—inches are the base drawing unit. Try the following exercise to see 
how distances are displayed:
	
1.	 Type Units↵ to open the Drawing Units dialog box.
	
2.	 Select Architectural from the Type drop-down list, and then click OK.
	
3.	 Choose Map Road from the Map Aerial flyout in the Map Tools Ribbon panel.
	
4.	 Zoom into the map view so that it looks similar to Figure 13.21.
Figure 13.21
The Map Road view
	
5.	 Choose Measure from the Home tab’s Utilities panel.
	
6.	 Measure the distance from Laguna Street to Van Ness Avenue. The Measure tool reports 
a distance of 2446′, give or take a few feet.
In this exercise, the distance reported by the Measure tool is in feet. Had you not changed 
drawing unit in steps 1 and 2, the distance reported by the Measure tool would have been 29,043 
units, which is the distance in inches.
You can use other methods to find measurements in your map. For example, you could get 
a rough estimate of the size of an existing building by drawing a closed polyline around the 
building outline (see Figure 13.22). Select the polyline and hover over a grip to view the dimen-
sions of the outline closest to the grip.

Advanced Editing and Organizing 
Because you may not know all of a project’s requirements when it begins, you usually base 
the first draft of a design on anticipated needs. As the plan goes forward, you adjust for new 
requirements as they arise. As more people enter the project, additional design restrictions come 
into play, and the design is further modified. This process continues throughout the project, 
from the first draft to the end product.
In this chapter, you’ll gain experience with tools that will help you edit your drawings 
more efficiently. You’ll take a closer look at Xrefs and how they may be used to help streamline 
changes in a drawing project. You’ll also be introduced to tools and techniques that you can 
use to minimize duplication of work, such as the Quick Select tool and the QuickCalc feature. 
The AutoCAD® 2017 software can be a powerful timesaving tool if used properly. This chapter 
examines ways to harness that power.
In this chapter, you will learn to

Using External References
Chapter 7, “Mastering Viewing Tools, Hatches, and External References,” mentioned that careful 
use of blocks, external references (Xrefs), and layers can help improve your productivity. In the 
following sections, you’ll see firsthand how to use these features to help reduce design errors 
and speed up delivery of an accurate set of drawings. You do so by controlling layers in con-
junction with blocks and Xrefs to create a common drawing database for several drawings. You 
can also use AutoCAD DWF and Acrobat PDF files as Xrefs. See Chapter 13, “Copying Existing 
Drawings from Other Sources,” for more on PDF files and Chapter 25, “Managing and Sharing 
Your Drawings,” for more on DWF files.
Later, you’ll start to use Xrefs to create different floor plans for the building that you worked 
on earlier in this book. To save you some time, we’ve created a second one-bedroom unit plan 
called Unit2 that you’ll use in these exercises (see Figure 14.1). You can find this new unit 
plan in the Chapter 14 folder of sample files at this book’s web page, www.sybex.com/go/
masteringautocad2017.

474  | CHAPTER 14  Advanced Editing and Organizing   
Preparing Existing Drawings for External Referencing
Chapter 7 discussed how you can use Xrefs to assemble one floor of the apartment. In this section, 
you’ll explore the creation and use of Xrefs to build multiple floors, each containing slightly dif-
ferent sets of drawing information. By doing so, you’ll learn how Xrefs enable you to use a single 
file in multiple drawings to save time and reduce redundancy. You’ll see that by sharing common 
data in multiple files, you can reduce your work and keep the drawing information consistent.
You’ll start by creating the files that you’ll use later as Xrefs:
	
1.	 Open the 14a-plan.dwg or 14a-plan-metric file (see Figure 14.2). Select Zoom All from 
the Navigation bar to center the drawing.
Figure 14.1

unit
Figure 14.2
The overall plan
	
2.	 Turn off the Ceiling and Flr-pat layers to get a clear, uncluttered view of the individual 
unit plans.

Using External References |  475  
	
3.	 Use the Wblock command (enter W↵ at the Command prompt), and write the eight units 
in the corners of your plan to a file called Floor1.dwg in your My Documents folder (see 
Figure 14.3). When you select objects for the Wblock, be sure to include the S-DOOR door 
reference symbols and apartment number symbols for those units. Use 0,0 for the Wblock 
insertion base point. Also make sure that the Delete From Drawing check box is selected 
in the Write Block dialog box before you click OK.
Figure 14.3
Units to be exported to 
the Floor1.dwg file
Select these units for the Wblock command.
	
4.	 Using Figure 14.4 as a guide, insert the Unit2.dwg file into the corners where the other 
eight units were previously. Metric users should use Unit2-metric.dwg.
Figure 14.4
Insertion information 
for Unit2 Metric 
coordinates is shown 
in brackets.
Mirror inserted Unit2
blocks to this side.

476  | CHAPTER 14  Advanced Editing and Organizing   
	
5.	 After you’ve accurately placed the corner units, use the Wblock command to write these 
corner units to a file called Floor2.dwg. Again, use the 0,0 coordinate as the insertion base 
point for the Wblock, and make sure that the Delete From Drawing check box is selected.
	
6.	 Choose Save As from the Application menu to turn the remaining set of unit plans into a 
file called Common.dwg.
You’ve just created three files: Floor1.dwg, Floor2.dwg, and Common.dwg. Each file contains 
unique information about the building. Next, you’ll use the Xref command to recombine these 
files for the different floor plans in your building.
Assembling Xrefs to Build a Drawing
You’ll now create composite files for each floor using Xrefs of only the files needed for the indi-
vidual floors. You’ll use the Attach option of the Xref command to insert all the files that you 
exported from the Plan.dwg file.
Follow these steps to create a file representing the first floor:
	
1.	 Close the Common.dwg file, open a new file, and call it Xref-1.dwg.
	
2.	 For Imperial measurement users, use the Drawing Units dialog box (Units↵) to set the 
drawing units type to Architectural and the Insertion scale to Inches. Use the Limits 
command to set the lower-left corner at 0,0 and the upper-right corner at 2112,1632. 
Metric users should set the drawing units type to Decimal and the insertion scale to 
Centimeters. Set the lower-left corner limits to 0,0 and the upper-right corner limits to 
5940 cm × 4200 cm. For both measurement systems, select All from the Zoom flyout on 
the View tab’s Navigate panel or type Z↵A↵ so that your drawing area is adjusted to the 
window.
	
3.	 Set the Ltscale value to 192. Metric users should set it to 200.
	
4.	 Click Attach in the Insert tab’s Reference panel, or type XA↵ to open the Select Reference 
File dialog box.
	
5.	 Locate and select the Common.dwg file.
	
6.	 In the Attach External Reference dialog box, make sure that the Specify On-Screen check 
box in the Insertion Point group isn’t selected. Then make sure that the X, Y, and Z values 
in the Insertion Point group are all 0 (see Figure 14.5). Because the insertion points of all 
the files are the same (0,0), they will fit together perfectly when they’re inserted into the 
new files.
	
7.	 Click OK. The Common.dwg file appears in the drawing.
The drawing may appear faded. This is because AutoCAD has a feature that allows you to 
fade an Xref so that it is easily distinguished from other objects in your current drawing. You 
can quickly change the reference fade setting by doing the following:
	
1.	 In the Insert tab’s expanded Reference panel, locate the Xref Fading slider.
	
2.	 Click and drag the Xref Fading slider all the way to the left, or you can click in the Xref 
Fading slider value box to the right and enter 0↵.

Using External References |  477  
Your Xref should now appear solid. Remember the Xref Fading slider; you may find that 
you’ll need it frequently when working with Xrefs.
Now continue to add some reference files:
	
1.	 Click Attach from the Reference panel, and then locate, select, and insert the Floor1.dwg 
or Floor1-metric.dwg file.
	
2.	 Repeat step 1 to insert the Col-grid.dwg or Col-grid-metric.dwg file as an Xref. You 
now have the plan for the first floor.
	
3.	 Save this file.
Next, use the current file to create another file representing a different floor:
	
1.	 Choose Save As from the Application menu, and save this file as Xref-2.dwg.
	
2.	 Click the External References tool in the Insert tab’s Reference panel title bar, or type 
XR↵.
	
3.	 In the External References palette, select Floor1 in the list of Xrefs. Notice that as you 
hover over the Floor1 name, a description of the file appears with a thumbnail view (see 
Figure 14.6). This can help you quickly identify Xref files in the list. If you click an Xref 
name, the Xref will be highlighted in the drawing.
Figure 14.5
The Attach External 
Reference dialog box

478  | CHAPTER 14  Advanced Editing and Organizing   
	
4.	 Right-click and select Detach from the context menu.
	
5.	 Right-click in the blank portion of the list in the External References palette, and select 
Attach DWG from the context menu.
	
6.	 Locate and select Floor2.dwg.
	
7.	 In the Attach External Reference dialog box, make sure that the X, Y, and Z values in the 
Insertion Point group are all set to 0.
	
8.	 Click OK. The Floor2 drawing appears in place of Floor1. Turn off the Notes layer to see 
the plan clearly.
Now when you need to make changes to Xref-1.dwg or Xref-2.dwg, you can edit their 
individual Xref files. The next time you open Xref-1.dwg or Xref-2.dwg, the updated Xrefs 
will automatically appear in their most recent forms.
Xrefs don’t need to be permanent. As you saw in the previous exercise, you can attach 
and detach them easily at any time. This means that if you need to get information from 
another file—to see how well an elevator core aligns, for example—you can temporarily 
attach the other file as an Xref to check alignments quickly and then detach it when you’re 
finished.
Think of these composite files as final plot files that are used only for plotting and reviewing. 
You can then edit the smaller, more manageable Xref files. Figure 14.7 illustrates the relationship 
of these files.

Keeping Track of Xref Locations
Because Xref files don’t become part of the file into which they’re referenced, you must take care 
to keep them in a location where AutoCAD can find them when the referencing file is opened. This 
can be a minor annoyance when you need to send files to others outside your office. To help keep 
track of Xrefs, choose Publish eTransmit from the Application menu. See Chapter 25 for details. 
The combinations of Xrefs are limited only by your imagination.
Locating Xref Files
If you move an Xref file after you insert it into a drawing, AutoCAD may not be able to find it later 
when you attempt to open the drawing. If this happens, you can click the Browse button of the 
Saved Path option at the bottom of the External References palette to tell AutoCAD the new loca-
tion of the Xref file. The Browse button appears at the far right of the Saved Path text box when 
you click in the text box.
If you know that you’ll be keeping your project files in one place, you can use the Projectname 
system variable in conjunction with the Options dialog box to direct AutoCAD to look in a specific 
location for Xref files. Here’s what to do:
	1.	 Choose Options from the Application menu or type OP↵.
	2.	 Click the Files tab, and then locate and select the Project Files Search Path option.
	3.	 Click Add and either enter a name for your project or accept the default name of Project1.
	4.	 Click Browse and locate and select the folder where you plan to keep your Xref files.
	5.	 Close the Options dialog box, and then enter Projectname↵ at the command-line interface. Enter 
the project name you used in step 3.
	6.	 Save your file so that it remembers this setting. 

480  | CHAPTER 14  Advanced Editing and Organizing   
Updating Blocks in Xrefs
Several advantages are associated with using Xref files. Because the Xrefs don’t become part of 
the drawing file’s database, the referencing files remain small. Also, because Xref files are easily 
updated, work can be split up among several people in a workgroup environment or on a net-
work. For example, for your hypothetical apartment building project, one person can be editing 
the Common.dwg file while another works on Floor1.dwg, and so on. The next time the compos-
ite Xref-1.dwg or Xref-2.dwg file is opened, it automatically reflects any new changes made in 
the Xref files. If the Xref is updated while you still have the receiving file open, you see a balloon 
message telling you that an Xref requires a reload.
Let’s see how to set this up:
	
1.	 Save and close the Xref-2.dwg file, and then open the Common.dwg file.
	
2.	 Click Insert in the Home or Insert tab’s Block panel, and then click More Options. You can 
also type Insert↵.
	
3.	 In the Insert dialog box, make sure the Specify On Screen option is selected in the Insert group.
	
4.	 Click the Browse button and then locate and select 14b-unit.dwg (or 14b-unit-metric
.dwg for metric users) from the Chapter 14 sample files, but make sure that you make 
a copy of the file and rename it to Unit.dwg before you insert it. You may also use the 
method described in the “Substituting Blocks” sidebar in Chapter 7 to insert 14b-unit
.dwg or 14b-unit-metric.dwg without renaming the file.
	
5.	 At the Insertion point: prompt, press the Esc key. You see the new unit plan in place 
of the old one (see Figure 14.8).
Figure 14.8
The Common.dwg file with 
the revised unit plan
	
6.	 If the Notes layer is on, use the layer drop-down list to turn it off.
	
7.	 Click the Insert tool in the Block panel again, and replace the empty room across the 
hall from the lobby with the utility room (utility.dwg or utility-metric.dwg) 
(see Figure 14.9). You may want to make some adjustments to the utility room so that it 
aligns with the plan.

8.	 Save the Common.dwg file.
	
9.	 Open the Xref-1.dwg file, right-click Common in the External References palette, and 
select Reload from the context menu. You can also right-click the Manage Xrefs icon in 
the lower-right corner of the AutoCAD window and select Reload DWG Xrefs. You see the 
utility room and the typical units in their new form. Your drawing should look like 
the top image in Figure 14.10.

10.	 Open Xref-2.dwg. You see that the utility room and typical units are updated in this file 
as well. (See the bottom image in Figure 14.10.)
Importing Named Elements from Xrefs
Chapter 5, “Keeping Track of Layers and Blocks,” discussed how layers, blocks, linetypes, and 
text styles—called named elements—are imported along with a file that is inserted into another 
file. Xref files don’t import named elements. You can, however, review their names and use a 
special command to import the ones that you want to use in the current file.
Saving Xref Layer Settings
You can set the Visretain system variable to 1 to force AutoCAD to remember layer settings of Xref 
files. Another choice is to turn on the Retain Changes To Xref Layers option in the Open And Save 
tab of the Options dialog box. You can also use the Layer States Manager in the Layer Properties 
Manager dialog box to save layer settings for later recall. The Layer States Manager is described in 
detail in the section “Saving and Recalling Layer Settings” later in this chapter.
AutoCAD renames named elements from Xref files by giving them the prefix of the filename 
from which they come. For example, the Wall layer in the Floor1.dwg file is called Floor1|WALL 
in the Xref-1.dwg file; the Toilet block is called Floor1|TOILET. You can’t draw on the layer 
Floor1|WALL, nor can you insert Floor1|TOILET, but you can view Xref layers in the Layer 
Properties Manager dialog box, and you can view Xref blocks by using the Insert dialog box.
Next, you’ll look at how AutoCAD identifies layers and blocks in Xref files, and you’ll get a 
chance to import a layer from an Xref:
	
1.	 With the Xref-1.dwg file open, open the Layer Properties Manager palette. Notice that 
the names of the layers from the Xref files are all prefixed with the filename and the ver-
tical bar (|) character. Exit the Layer Properties Manager palette. You can also open the 
Layer drop-down list to view the layer names.
	
2.	 Enter XB↵ to open the Xbind dialog box. You see a listing of the current Xrefs. Each item 
shows a plus sign to the left. This list box follows the Microsoft Windows format for 
expandable lists, much like the tree view in Windows File Explorer (see Figure 14.11).

box

3.	 Click the plus sign next to the Floor1 Xref item. The list expands to show the types of 
elements available to bind (see Figure 14.12).

list
	
4.	 Click the plus sign next to the Layer item. The list expands further to show the layers 
available for binding (see Figure 14.13).

5.	 Locate Floor1|WALL in the list, click it, and then click the Add button. Floor1|WALL is 
added to the list to the right, Definitions To Bind.
	
6.	 Click OK to bind the Floor1|WALL layer.
	
7.	 Open the Layer Properties Manager palette.
	
8.	 Scroll down the list, and look for the Floor1|WALL layer. You won’t find it. In its place is a 
layer called Floor1$0$WALL.
	
9.	 Close the current file without saving it so that you will have an unaltered file if you want 
to practice these exercises again. You may also use Save As to save it under a different 
name from the original file. 

484  | CHAPTER 14  Advanced Editing and Organizing   
As you can see, when you use Xbind to import a named item, such as the Floor1|WALL layer, 
the vertical bar (|) is replaced by two dollar signs surrounding a number, which is usually 0. (If 
for some reason the imported layer name Floor1$0$WALL already exists, the 0 in that name is 
changed to 1, as in Floor1$1$WALL.) Other named items are renamed in the same way, using the 
$0$ replacement for the vertical bar.
You can also use the Xbind dialog box to bind multiple layers as well as other items from 
Xrefs attached to the current drawing. You can bind an entire Xref to a drawing, converting it 
to a simple block. By doing so, you have the opportunity to maintain unique layer names of the 
Xref being bound or to merge the Xref’s similarly named layers with those of the current file. 
See Chapter 7 for details.
Import Drawing Components with DesignCenter
The AutoCAD DesignCenter™ lets you import settings and other drawing components from any 
drawing, not just Xref drawings. You’ll learn more about the DesignCenter in Chapter 25.
Nesting Xrefs and Using Overlays
Xrefs can be nested. For example, if the Common.dwg file created in this chapter used the Unit.dwg 
file as an Xref rather than as an inserted block, you would still get the same result in the Xref-1
.dwg file. That is, you would see the entire floor plan, including the unit plans, when you opened 
Xref-1.dwg. In this situation, Unit.dwg would be nested in the Common.dwg file, which is in turn 
externally referenced in the Xref-1.dwg file.
Although nested Xrefs can be helpful, take care in using Xrefs this way. For example, you might 
create an Xref by using the Common.dwg file in the Floor1.dwg file as a means of referencing walls 
and other features of the Common.dwg file. You might also reference the Common.dwg file into 
the Floor2.dwg file for the same reason. After you did so, however, you’d have three versions of the 
Common plan in the Xref-1.dwg file because each Xref would have Common.dwg attached to it. 
And because AutoCAD would dutifully load Common.dwg three times, Xref-1.dwg would occupy 
substantial computer memory, slowing your computer when you edited the Xref-1.dwg file.
To avoid this problem, use the Overlay option in the Attach External Reference dialog box. An 
overlaid Xref can’t be nested. For example, if you use the Overlay option when inserting the Common
.dwg file into the Floor1.dwg and Floor2.dwg files, the nested Common.dwg files are ignored when 
you open the Xref-1.dwg file, thereby eliminating the redundant occurrence of Common.dwg. In 
another example, if you use the Overlay option to import the Unit.dwg file into the Common.dwg 
file and then attach the Common.dwg into Xref-1.dwg as an Xref, you don’t see the Unit.dwg file 
in Xref-1.dwg. The nested Unit.dwg drawing is ignored.
If you have used the Attach option to insert an Xref and want to change it to Overlay, you can do so 
in the External References palette. Click the External References icon in the Insert tab’s Reference 
panel’s title bar, and then in the External References palette, right-click the name of the Xref that 
you want to change and select Xref Type Overlay. Use the same steps to convert an Overlay Xref 
into an Attached Xref, but use Xref Type Attach after you right-click the Xref name.

Controlling the Xref Search Path
One problem AutoCAD users encountered in the past was lost or broken links to an Xref. This 
occurs when an Xref file is moved from its original location or when you receive a set of draw-
ings that includes Xrefs. The Xref links are broken because AutoCAD doesn’t know where to 
look.
When you insert an Xref, the Attach External Reference dialog box opens, offering you 
options for insertion point, scale, and rotation. This dialog box also provides the Path Type 
option, which enables you to select a method for locating Xrefs. You can choose from three path 
type options:
Full Path    Lets you specify the exact filename and path for an Xref, including the disk drive 
or network location. Use this option when you want AutoCAD to look in a specific location 
for the Xref.
Relative Path    Lets you specify a file location relative to the location of the current or host 
drawing. For example, if the host drawing is in a folder called C:\mycadfiles and the Xrefs 
are in a folder called C:\mycadfiles\xrefs, you can specify .\xrefs for the location of the 
Xref file. This option is useful when you know that you’ll maintain the folder structure of 
the host and Xref files when moving or exchanging these files. Note that because this is a 
relative path, this option is valid only for files that reside on the same local hard disk.
No Path    Perhaps the most flexible option, No Path tells AutoCAD to use its own search 
criteria to find Xrefs. When this option is selected, AutoCAD first looks in the same folder 
of the host drawing; then it looks in the project search path defined in the Files tab of the 
Options dialog box. (See Appendix B, “Installing and Setting Up AutoCAD,” for more on 
the Options dialog box.) Finally, AutoCAD looks in the Support File Search Path option, 
also defined in the Files tab of the Options dialog box. If you plan to send your files to a  
client or a consultant, you may want to use this option.
You can change the path type using two features in the External References palette. First, 
select the Xref or Xrefs that you want to change; then right-click and select Path in the context 
menu. You will see three options: Make Absolute, Make Relative, and Remove Path. Select the 
option that you desire for the selected Xrefs. You can also click the Change Path tool in the 
External References palette toolbar.
Managing Layers
In a survey of AutoCAD users, Autodesk discovered that one of the most frequently used fea-
tures in AutoCAD is the Layer command. You’ll find that you turn layers on and off to display 
and edit the many levels of information contained in your AutoCAD files. As your files become 

486  | CHAPTER 14  Advanced Editing and Organizing   
more complex, controlling layer visibility becomes more difficult. Fortunately, AutoCAD offers 
the Layer States Manager to make your work a little easier.
Saving and Recalling Layer Settings
The Layer States Manager lets you save layer settings. This can be crucial when you’re edit-
ing a file that serves multiple uses, such as a floor plan and reflected ceiling plan. You can, for 
example, turn layers on and off to set up the drawing for a reflected ceiling plan view and then 
save the layer settings. Later, when you need to modify the ceiling information, you can recall 
the layer settings to view the ceiling data.
The following steps show you how the Layer States Manager works:
	
1.	 In AutoCAD, open the 14b-unit.dwg file. Click the Layer Properties tool in the Home 
tab’s Layers panel to open the Layer Properties Manager, and turn on all the layers except 
Notes and Flr-pat. Your drawing should look similar to the top image in Figure 14.14.

14b-unit.dwg file

changing layer settings
	
2.	 Click the Unsaved Layer State drop-down list in the Home tab’s expanded Layers panel.

Managing Layers |  487  
	
3.	 Click Manage Layer States to open the resizable Layer States Manager dialog box. Take 
a moment to look at the options in this dialog box. This is where you can specify which 
layer settings you want to be saved with this layer state (see Figure 14.15). If your list of 
Layer States is larger than can be displayed, you can enlarge the dialog box to view more 
of the list.
Figure 14.15
The Layer States 
Manager dialog box
	
4.	 You’re ready to save the current layer state. Click the New button in the Layer States 
Manager dialog box. The New Layer State To Save dialog box opens (see Figure 14.16).

488  | CHAPTER 14  Advanced Editing and Organizing   
	
5.	 Enter blank floor plan in the New Layer State Name box. Note that you can also enter 
a brief description of your layer state. Click OK to return to the Layer States Manager 
dialog box.
	
6.	 Click the More Restore Options button (see Figure 14.17) in the lower-right corner of the 
Layer States Manager dialog box to expand the list of options.
Figure 14.16
The New Layer State To 
Save dialog box
Figure 14.17
The More Restore 
Options button
	
7.	 Make sure the On/Off check box is selected, and then click Close. Several other options 
are available, but you can leave them as they are.
	
8.	 Back in the Layer Properties Manager dialog box, turn on the Flr-pat and Notes layers 
and turn off the Ceiling layer.
Your drawing looks like the bottom image in Figure 14.14.
You’ve just saved a layer state and then changed the layer settings to something different 
from the saved state. The following steps demonstrate how you can restore the saved layer 
state:
	
1.	 In the Home tab’s expanded Layers panel, click the Unsaved Layer State drop-down 
list and hover over Blank Floor Plan. Notice that you see a preview of the layer state as 
you hover over the name. Go ahead and select Blank Floor Plan. Your drawing reverts 
to the previous view with the Notes and Flr-pat layers turned off and the Ceiling layer 
turned on.
	
2.	 This brings you to the end of the Layer States Manager exercise. Save the file and close it.
The layer states are saved with the file so that you can retrieve them at a later date. As you 
can see in the Layer States Manager dialog box, you have a few other options, as shown in 
Table 14.1.

Managing Layers |  489  
Table 14.1:	
Layer States Manager dialog box options
Option
Purpose
New
Creates a new layer state.
Save
Saves the selected layer state after edits.
Edit
Lets you edit the layer settings for the selected layer state.
Rename
Renames a selected layer state.
Delete
Deletes a layer state from the list.
Import
Imports a set of layer states that have been exported using the Export option 
of this dialog box.
Export
Saves a set of layer states as a file. By default, the file is given the name of the 
current layer state with the .las filename extension. You can import the 
layer-state file into other files.
Layer Properties To 
Restore (in the expanded 
dialog box)
Lets you select the layer properties to be controlled by the Layer States 
Manager.
In addition to saving layer states by name, you can quickly revert to a previous layer 
setting by clicking the Previous tool on the Home tab’s expanded Layers panel. This tool 
enables you to revert to the previous layer settings without affecting other settings in 
AutoCAD. Note that Previous mode doesn’t restore renamed or deleted layers, nor does it 
remove new layers.
After you become familiar with these layer-state tools, you’ll find yourself using them fre-
quently in your editing sessions.
Other Tools for Managing Layers
A number of tools are available that help you quickly set up layers as you work. In the fol-
lowing sections, you’ll learn about some of the other tools that you’ve seen in the Layers 
panel. All the tools discussed in these sections have keyboard command equivalents. Check 
the tool tip for the keyboard command name when you select one of these tools from the 
Layers panel.
Using Layer Walk to Explore Layers
When you work with a file that was produced by someone else, you usually have to spend some 
time becoming familiar with the way layers are set up in it. This process can be tedious, but the 
Layer Walk tool can help.
As the name implies, the Layer Walk tool lets you “walk through” the layers of a file, visu-
ally isolating each layer as you select its name from a list. You can use Layer Walk to select 
the layers that you want to be visible, or you can turn layers on and off to explore a drawing 

490  | CHAPTER 14  Advanced Editing and Organizing   
without affecting the current layer settings. To open the LayerWalk dialog box, do the 
following:
	
1.	 Click the Layer Walk tool on the expanded Layers panel, or enter Laywalk↵.
	
2.	 The LayerWalk dialog box appears (see Figure 14.18). You can click and drag the bot-
tom edge of the dialog box to expand the list so that you can see all of the layers in the 
drawing.
Figure 14.18
The LayerWalk dialog 
box
When you first open the LayerWalk dialog box, you see the current visible layers selected. 
Layers that are off aren’t selected. Click a single layer, and AutoCAD displays just that layer. 
With a single layer selected, you can “walk” through the layers by pressing the down and up 
arrow keys.
You can use this dialog box to set up layer settings visually by Ctrl+clicking layer names 
to make them visible. Turn off Restore On Exit to maintain the layer settings that you set 
up in the LayerWalk dialog box, or turn it on if you want the drawing to revert to the layer 
settings that were in place before you opened the LayerWalk dialog box. Right-click the 
list of layers to display a set of other options that let you save the layer state and invert the 
selection.
Changing the Layer Assignment of Objects
In addition to the Layer Walk tool, the Layers panel includes two tools that change the layer 
assignments of objects: the Match Layer tool and the Change To Current Layer tool on the 
expanded Layers panel.
The Match Layer tool is similar to the Match Properties tool, but it’s streamlined to oper-
ate only on layer assignments. After clicking this tool in the Layers panel, select the object or 
objects that you want to change, press ↵, and then select an object whose layer you want to 
match.
The Change To Current Layer tool on the expanded Layers panel changes an object’s layer 
assignment to the current layer.

Managing Layers |  491  
Controlling the Display of Xref Objects
In AutoCAD 2017, you can control the display of Xref objects that are not set to ByLayer. A new 
system variable called Xrefoverride can be set to a value of 1 to cause non-ByLayer Xref objects 
to behave as if they are set to ByLayer. See the sidebar “Assigning Colors, Linetypes, and Linetype 
Scales to Individual Objects” in Chapter 5 for more on the ByLayer setting.
Controlling Layer Settings through Objects
The remaining Layer tools let you make layer settings by selecting objects in the drawing. These 
tools are easy to use: click a tool, and then select an object.
The following list describes each tool:
Layer Isolate/Layer Unisolate    Layer Isolate turns off all the layers except for the layer of 
the selected object. Layer Unisolate restores the layer settings to the way the drawing was set 
before you used Layer Isolate.
Freeze    Freezes the layer of the selected object.
Off    Turns off the layer of the selected object.
Lock/Unlock    Locks the layer of the selected object. A locked layer is visible but can’t be 
edited.
Layer Walk    Lets you dynamically change layer visibility.
Copy Objects To New Layer    Copies an object or a set of objects to a different layer.
Make Object’s Layer Current    Enables you to set the current layer by selecting an object 
that is on the desired layer.
Turn All Layers On    Turns all layers on.
Thaw All Layers    Thaws all layers.
VP Freeze In All Viewports Except Current    Enables you to freeze layers in all but the cur-
rent viewport by selecting objects that are on the layers to be frozen.
Merge    Combines several layers into one layer. First select objects whose layers you want to 
merge, press ↵, and then select an object whose layer you want to merge with.
Delete    Deletes all objects on a layer and then deletes the layer.
Merging Multiple Layers into One Layer
If you find that you have several layers that you want to merge into one layer, you can use the 
Merge option in the Layer Manager. You can merge a single layer or a set of layers into an exist-
ing layer, other than one that has been selected. If the layer you want to use for the merge does 
not exist, create it first. Then, in the Layer Manager, select the layer or layers that you want to 
merge, right-click, and select the Merge Selected Layer(s) To option. The Merge To Layer dialog 
box appears (see Figure 14.19). You can select the layer name from the list. The merged layers are 
automatically purged from the drawing.

492  | CHAPTER 14  Advanced Editing and Organizing   
Using Advanced Tools: Filter and Quick Select
Two other tools are extremely useful in your day-to-day work with AutoCAD: selection filters 
and Quick Select. We’ve saved the discussion of these tools until this part of the chapter because 
you don’t need them until you’ve become accustomed to the way AutoCAD works. Chances are 
that you’ve already experimented with some of the AutoCAD menu options not yet discussed 
in the exercise. Many of the drop-down menu options and their functions are self-explanatory. 
Selection filters and QuickCalc (the latter is discussed later in this chapter) don’t appear in any 
of the menus and require further explanation.
Let’s start with selection filters. AutoCAD includes two selection-filtering tools: The Quick 
Select tool offers a quick way to locate objects based on their properties. The Filter tool lets you 
select objects based on a more complex set of criteria.
Filtering Selections
Suppose that you need to isolate just the walls of your drawing in a separate file. One way to 
do this is to turn off all the layers except the Wall layer. You can then use the Wblock command 
and select the remaining walls, using a window to write the wall information to a file. Filters 
can simplify this operation by enabling you to select groups of objects based on their properties.
Follow these steps to select objects based on their layer assignment:
	
1.	 Open the Unit.dwg file.
	
2.	 Type W↵ to start the Wblock command. Then, in the Write Block dialog box, click the 
Browse button to the right of the File Name And Path text box.
	
3.	 Browse to a location for the file, and name the file Unitwall. Click the Save button.
	
4.	 Back at the Write Block dialog box, make sure that the Objects and Retain radio buttons 
are selected, and then click the Select Objects button in the Objects group. The dialog box 
closes so that you can select objects.

dialog box

5.	 At the Select Objects: prompt, type 'Filter↵ to open the Object Selection Filters dialog 
box (see Figure 14.20).

The Object Selection 
Filters dialog box
Getting Notification of New Layers
AutoCAD can notify you when new layers are added to Xrefs in a drawing or to the current draw-
ing itself. Such new layers are called unreconciled layers. This feature can be helpful when you are 
working with others and need to stay informed about the condition of a drawing. By default, the 
notification comes in two forms. When new layers are added, a warning icon appears in the right 
side of the status bar. If you attempt to plot a drawing that contains new layers, the following 
message appears: Unreconciled new layers exist in the drawing. The warning will not 
prevent you from doing anything. It is just intended as a way to notify you of changes. In addition, 
the unreconciled layers are grouped into a layer property filter called Unreconciled New Layers, 
which can be viewed in the Layer Properties Manager.
To “reconcile” unreconciled layers, open the Layer Properties Manager, select the unreconciled 
layers, and right-click and select Reconcile Layers from the context menu.
New layer notification is turned on by default, and it is controlled by the Layerevalctl system 
variable. Type Layerevalctl↵1↵ to turn it on and Layerevalctl↵0↵ to turn it off.
You can also set how you are notified of new layers through the Layereval and Layernotify 
system variables. Layereval controls when the Unreconciled New Layer filter displays new 
layers and can be set to 0, 1, or 2. The setting 0 turns Layereval off, 1 sets it to detect new lay-
ers in Xrefs, and 2 sets it to detect new layers in Xrefs and the current drawing. Layernotify 
determines how you are notified of new layers. The setting 0 means no notification; 1 means 
notify when you start a plot; 2 when the drawing is open; 4 when Xrefs are loaded, reloaded, or 
attached; 8 when you are restoring a layer state; 16 when you are saving a file; and 32 when you 
are inserting a drawing.

494  | CHAPTER 14  Advanced Editing and Organizing   
	
6.	 Open the drop-down list in the Select Filter group.
	
7.	 Scroll down the list, and find and highlight the Layer option.
	
8.	 Click the Select button next to the drop-down list to display a list of layers. Highlight 
Wall, and click OK.
	
9.	 Click the Add To List button toward the bottom of the Select Filter group to add Layer = 
Wall to the list box.
	
10.	 Click Apply to close the Object Selection Filters dialog box.
	
11.	 Type ALL↵ to select everything in the drawing. Only the objects assigned to the Wall 
layer are selected. You see a message in the Command window indicating how many 
objects were found.
	
12.	 Press ↵. You see the message Exiting Filtered selection Resuming WBLOCK 
command – Select objects: 20 found.
	
13.	 Press ↵ again to complete the selection, and then click OK to complete the Wblock 
command. All of the walls are written to a file called Unitwall.
In this exercise, you filtered out a layer by using the Filter command. After you designate a 
filter, you then select the group of objects through which you want AutoCAD to filter. AutoCAD 
finds the objects that match the filter requirements and passes those objects to the current 
command.
As you’ve seen from the previous exercise, you can choose from many options in this utility. 
Let’s take a closer look.
Working with the Object Selection Filters Dialog Box
To use the Object Selection Filters dialog box, first select the criterion for filtering from the drop-
down list. If the criterion that you select is a named item (layer, linetype, color, or block), you can 
then click the Select button to choose specific items from a list. If there is only one choice, the 
Select button is dimmed.
After you’ve determined what to filter, you must add it to the list by clicking the Add To List 
button. The filter criterion then appears in the list box at the top of the Object Selection Filters 
dialog box, and you can apply that criterion to your current command or to a later command. 
AutoCAD remembers your filter settings, so if you need to reselect a filtered selection set, you 
don’t have to redefine your filter criteria.
Saving Filter Criteria
If you prefer, you can preselect filter criteria. Then, at any Select objects: prompt, you can 
type 'Filter↵, highlight the appropriate filter criteria in the list box, and click Apply. The specifi-
cations in the Object Selection Filters dialog box remain in place for the duration of the current 
editing session.
You can also save a set of criteria by entering a name in the text box next to the Save As button 
and then clicking the button. The criteria list data is saved in a file called Filter.nfl in the C:\
Users\User Name\AppData\Roaming\Autodesk\AutoCAD 2017\21.0\enu\Support folder. You 
can access the criteria list at any time by opening the Current drop-down list and choosing its name.

Using Advanced Tools: Filter and Quick Select |  495  
Filtering Objects by Location
Notice the X, Y, and Z drop-down lists just below the main Select Filter drop-down list in the 
Object Selection Filters dialog box. These lists become accessible when you select a criterion that 
describes a geometric property or a coordinate (such as an arc’s radius or center point). You can 
use these lists to define filter selections even more specifically using greater than (>), less than 
(<), equal to or greater than (>=), equal to or less than (<=), equal to (=), or not equal to (!=) (called 
relational operators).
For example, suppose that you want to grab all the circles whose radii are greater than 
4.0 units. To do this, choose Circle Radius from the Select Filter drop-down list. Then, in the 
X list, select >. Enter 4.0 in the text box to the right of the X list, and click Add To List. The 
items
Circle Radius > 4.0000
Object = Circle
are added to the list box at the top of the dialog box. You used the > operator to indicate a circle 
radius greater than 4.0 units.
Creating Complex Selection Sets
At times, you’ll want to create a specific filter list. For instance, say that you need to filter out all 
the Door blocks on the layer Floor2 and all arcs with a radius equal to 1. To do this, you use the 
grouping operators found at the bottom of the Select Filter drop-down list. You’ll need to build a 
list as follows:
** Begin OR
** Begin AND
Block Name = Door
Object = Block
Layer = Floor2
** End AND
** Begin AND
Object = Arc
Arc Radius = 1.0000
** End AND
** End OR
Notice that the Begin and End operators are balanced—that is, for every Begin OR or Begin 
AND, there is an End OR or End AND.
This list may look simple, but it can get confusing. If criteria are bounded by the AND 
grouping operators, objects must fulfill both criteria before they’re selected. If criteria are 
bounded by the OR grouping operators, objects fulfilling either criterion will be selected. If you 
add the wrong option accidentally, select it from the list and click the Delete button. If you need 
to insert an option in the middle of the list, select the item that comes after the item you want to 
insert, and then select and add the item.
Here are the steps to build the previous list:
	
1.	 In the Select Filter drop-down list, choose **Begin OR, and then click Add To List. Do the 
same for **Begin AND.

496  | CHAPTER 14  Advanced Editing and Organizing   
	
2.	 Click Block Name in the Select Filter drop-down list, click the Select button, and select 
Door from the list that appears. Click Add To List.
	
3.	 For the layer, click Layer in the Select Filter drop-down list. Click Select, choose the layer 
name, and click Add To List.
	
4.	 In the Select Filter drop-down list, choose **End AND, and then click Add To List. Do the 
same for **Begin AND.
	
5.	 Select Arc from the Select Filter drop-down list, and click Add To List.
	
6.	 Select Arc Radius from the Select Filter list, and enter 1.0 in the text box next to the X 
drop-down list. Be sure that the equal sign (=) shows in the X drop-down list, and then 
click Add To List.
	
7.	 Choose **End AND, and click Add To List. Do the same for **End OR.
If you make an error in any step, highlight the item, select an item to replace it, and click the 
Substitute button instead of the Add To List button. If you need only to change a value, click the 
Edit Item button near the center of the dialog box.
Quick Access to Your Favorite Commands
As IT managers, we’ve discovered that AutoCAD users are possessive of their keyboard and tool 
shortcuts, and they are usually the first custom item that a new employee will install. You can collect 
your favorite commands into a single toolbar or Ribbon panel by using the AutoCAD customization 
feature. This way, you can have ready access to your most frequently used commands. Chapter 24, 
“Customizing Toolbars, Menus, Linetypes, and Hatch Patterns,” gives you all the information you 
need to create your own custom toolbars and Ribbon panels.
Using Quick Select
The Filter command offers a lot of power in isolating specific types of objects, but in many 
situations you may not need such an elaborate tool. The Quick Select dialog box can filter 
your selection based on the object properties, which are the more common filter criteria. To 
access the Quick Select dialog box, click Quick Select in the Home tab’s Utilities panel, or 
right-click the drawing area when no command is active and choose Quick Select from the 
context menu.
Quick Select is offered as an option in a few other dialog boxes as well. Try using the Wblock 
command again, this time using the Quick Select option offered in its dialog box:
	
1.	 With the Unit.dwg file open, type W↵ to start the Wblock command. Then, in the Write 
Block dialog box, enter Unitwall2 in the File Name And Path text box.
	
2.	 Make sure that the Objects radio button is selected at the top of the dialog box and the 
Delete From Drawing option is selected from the Objects group.
	
3.	 Click the Quick Select tool to the right of the Select Objects button in the Objects group to 
open the Quick Select dialog box (see Figure 14.21).

Using Advanced Tools: Filter and Quick Select |  497

dialog box
	
4.	 Select Layer from the Properties list.
	
5.	 Select Wall from the Value drop-down list near the bottom of the dialog box.
	
6.	 Click the Select Objects button in the upper-right corner of the dialog box. The dialog 
boxes close so that you can select objects.
	
7.	 Select the entire drawing by using a window; press ↵ to finish your selection. Both dialog 
boxes return.
	
8.	 Click OK, and then click OK in the Write Block dialog box. The walls disappear, indicat-
ing that they have been written to a file.
	
9.	 Click the Undo button to undo the deletion.
The Qselect command selects objects based on their properties, as shown in the Properties 
list box. You can apply the selection criteria based on the entire drawing, or you can use the 
Select Objects button in the upper-right corner of the dialog box to isolate a set of objects to 
which you want to apply the selection criteria.
In the previous exercise, you used Quick Select from within another dialog box. As men-
tioned earlier, you can also use Quick Select by clicking Quick Select in the Home tab’s Utilities 
panel or by right-clicking the drawing area when no command is active and choosing Quick 
Select from the context menu. Quick Select then uses the Noun/Verb selection method: You 
select objects using Quick Select first, and then you apply editing commands to the selected 
objects.

498  | CHAPTER 14  Advanced Editing and Organizing   
If you want to use Quick Select with a command that doesn’t allow the Noun/Verb selection 
method, you can select objects by using Quick Select, start the command that you want to use, 
and then use the Previous Selection option.
Here is a description of the Quick Select dialog box options:
Apply To    Lets you determine the set of objects to which you want to apply the Quick Select 
filters. The default is the entire drawing, but you can use the Select Objects button to select a 
set of objects. If you select a set of objects before issuing the Quick Select command, you also 
see the Current Selection option in the Apply To drop-down list.
Object Type    Lets you limit the filter to specific types of objects such as lines, arcs, circles, 
and so on. The Multiple option lets you filter your selection from all of the objects in the 
drawing regardless of type.
Properties    Lets you select the property of the object type that you want to filter, after you 
select an object type. The Properties list changes to reflect the properties that are available to 
be filtered.
Operator    Offers a set of criteria to apply to the property that you select in the Properties list 
to make your selection. You can select objects that are equal to or not equal to the criteria that 
you select in the Object Type and Properties lists. Depending on the property that you select, 
you also may have the option to select objects that are greater than or less than a given prop-
erty value. For example, you can select all lines whose x-coordinate is less than 5 by choosing 
Line from the Object Type drop-down list and Start X from the Properties list. You then select 
< Less Than from the Operator drop-down list and enter 5 in the Value box.
Value    Displays the values of the property that you select in the Properties list. For example, 
if you select Layer from the Properties list, the Value option lists all of the available layers.
How To Apply    Lets you specify whether to include or exclude the filtered objects in a new 
selection set.
Append To Current Selection Set    Lets you append the filtered objects to an existing 
selection set or create an entirely new selection set.
Select Similar Objects or Isolate Object for Easier Editing
A few features in the context menu can help speed up object selection. If you select an object and 
right-click, you’ll see the Select Similar option:
Just as the name implies, it will select all objects in the drawing that are similar to the one currently 
selected. For example, if you select a hatch pattern, right-click, and then click Select Similar, all 
of the hatch patterns in the drawing will be selected. Click a line, right-click, and then click Select

Using the QuickCalc Calculator
You may have noticed a calculator icon in some of the options in the Properties palette or in 
the context menu. This is the QuickCalc tool. If you click it, you’ll see the QuickCalc calculator, 
shown in Figure 14.22. At first glance, it looks like a typical calculator. It has the standard math 
as well as the scientific functions that are available when you click the More button. If your view 
of QuickCalc doesn’t look like Figure 14.22, click the More/Less button and then expand the 
Number Pad or Scientific section by clicking the arrow in the title bar. You’ll also see a section 
for converting units, which comes in handy when you want to find the metric equivalent of an 
Imperial measurement.
Similar, and all of the lines that are on the selected line’s layer will be selected. You can also use 
the Selectsimilar command to do the same thing.
You can control how the Select Similar feature behaves by entering Selectsimilar↵SE↵. This opens 
the Select Similar Settings dialog box, which lets you set the basis for the similar selection such as 
layer, color, or linetype, to name a few.
Another handy right-click option is Isolate. If you have a set of objects and you right-click and select 
Isolate ➢ Isolate Objects, all but the selected objects will be made invisible. Or you can right-click 
and select Isolate ➢ Hide Objects to hide the selected objects. To bring back the objects that were 
made invisible, right-click and select Isolate ➢ End Object Isolation.

the display area.
Above the display area is a set of tools. These tools let you obtain other types of data from the 
drawing, such as the coordinate of a point or the intersection of two lines (see Figure 14.23).

Adding Foot and Inch Lengths and Finding the Sum of Angles
Although QuickCalc may look simple, it provides a powerful aid in your work in AutoCAD. 
Besides offering the typical calculator functions, QuickCalc lets you quickly add and subtract 
angle values, feet-and-inches lengths, and much more. You can paste the results from calculations 
into the command line so that you can easily include results as part of command-line responses.

Using the QuickCalc Calculator |  501  
To get a full appreciation of what QuickCalc can do for you, try the following exercises.
Imagine that you have a renovation project for which someone has taken dimensions in the 
field. You may be asked to draw a section of wall for which the overall dimension isn’t given but 
portions of the wall are dimensioned in a sketch, as shown in Figure 14.24.
Figure 14.24
A sketch of measure-
ments taken from an 
existing building
You can use QuickCalc to add a series of feet-and-inches dimensions:
	
1.	 Open the QuickCalc.dwg sample file, which contains some lines with which you can 
work. It’s set up to use architectural units.
	
2.	 Right-click, and select the QuickCalc tool from the context menu.
	
3.	 Double-click in the QuickCalc text box, and then enter 4′+36+5′6. As you type, your entry 
appears in the text box (see Figure 14.25).
	
4.	 Press ↵. The sum of the lengths, 12′-6″, appears in the text box and in the display area.
Figure 14.25
The QuickCalc text box
Notice that you only had to enter the foot (′) sign. QuickCalc assumes that a value is in inches 
unless you specify otherwise. You can also enter distances in the more traditional way using 
dashes and zeros, as in 4′-0″ or 5′-6″. QuickCalc ignores the dashes.
Now, suppose that you want to use your newfound length to draw a line. You can quickly 
add the results from the text box to the command line, as shown in the following exercise:
	
1.	 Click the Line tool, and then click a point in the left portion of the drawing area.
	
2.	 In the QuickCalc toolbar, click the Paste Value To Command Line tool. Notice that the 
value in the text box appears in the command line.

502  | CHAPTER 14  Advanced Editing and Organizing   
	
3.	 Make sure the Polar Tracking mode is turned on in the status bar.
	
4.	 While pointing the rubber-banding line directly to the right, press ↵. A horizontal line is 
drawn to the length of 12′-6″.
	
5.	 Press ↵ to end the Line command.
In this example, you used the Paste Value To Command Line tool in the QuickCalc toolbar. If 
you want to use a value that has scrolled up in the display area, you can select that value, right-
click, and choose Paste To Command Line (see Figure 14.26).
Figure 14.26
The Paste To Command 
Line option in the con-
text menu
This approach is especially useful when you’ve used QuickCalc to add several strings of 
dimensions and you need to recall them individually from the display area. In addition to add-
ing feet and inches, you can perform other math functions, such as dividing a length by 2 or 
multiplying a length. If the input value is in feet and inches, the resulting value is returned in 
feet and inches. For example, if you divide 25′ by 6, the result is 4′-2″.
Another useful QuickCalc tool is Angle Of Line Defined By Two Points, which allows you to 
obtain the angle defined by two points:
	
1.	 In QuickCalc, click the Angle Of Line Defined By Two Points tool. QuickCalc temporarily 
closes to allow you to select points.
	
2.	 With osnaps turned on, select the endpoints of the lower line, starting with the bottom 
endpoint, as shown in Figure 14.27.
Figure 14.27
Select these endpoints 
using the Angle Of 
Line Defined By Two 
Points option.
Select this endpoint ﬁrst.
Then select this endpoint.

Using the QuickCalc Calculator |  503  
	
3.	 Back in QuickCalc, click the plus button in the number pad or enter +. Then click the 
Angle Of Line Defined By Two Points tool again.
	
4.	 Select the endpoints of the upper line, starting with the bottom end of the line.
	
5.	 Back in QuickCalc, you see the angle value of the second line added to the text box. Click 
the equal button in the QuickCalc number pad to get the total angle value.
Here you added the angle of two lines, but you could just as easily have subtracted one angle 
from another or multiplied the value of a single angle. This can be useful if you need to find a 
fraction or a multiple of an angle. For example, you might need to find one-quarter of the angle 
described by a line, or you might want to find the angle that bisects two lines. You can do so by 
adding the value of two angles, as described in the exercise, and then dividing by 2 using the 
number pad or by including /2 in the text box. Once you’ve obtained a value, you can paste it 
into the command line while specifying angles for drawing input.
Converting Units with QuickCalc
In addition to performing math functions on distances and angles, you can do some basic 
unit conversions. QuickCalc performs length, area, volume, and angle conversions in its Units 
Conversion group. Try the following exercise to learn how to convert a length from centimeters 
to feet and inches. In the process, you’ll also learn how you can move a value from the Units 
Conversion area to the QuickCalc text box.
Suppose that you have a paper drawing that was done in metric, and you need to turn it into 
an AutoCAD drawing in feet and inches. Here’s an example of how you can convert centimeters 
to feet and inches:
	
1.	 In QuickCalc, expand the Units Conversion section by clicking the plus sign to the right 
of the Units Conversion title bar (see Figure 14.28).
Figure 14.28
The expanded Units 
Conversion section
	
2.	 Make sure that Length appears for the Units Type option. If not, click in the box to the 
right of the Units Type option and select Length from the drop-down list that appears.
	
3.	 Select Centimeters from the Convert From drop-down list.
	
4.	 Select Feet from the Convert To drop-down list.
	
5.	 In the Value To Convert box, enter 450↵ for 450 cm. The equivalent value in feet appears 
in the Converted Value box.

504  | CHAPTER 14  Advanced Editing and Organizing   
	
6.	 Click the Converted Value option, and you also see the QuickCalc icon to the far right. 
Click this icon to display the value in the text box at the top of QuickCalc.
The value is in feet and decimal feet. You can convert the value to feet and inches by doing 
the following:
	
1.	 Edit the value in the text box to read as follows: 14′ +(.7637795*12).
	
2.	 Press ↵. The value converts to a feet-and-inches value of 14′-9-3⁄16″.
One limitation to the unit-conversion feature is that it won’t take feet-and-inches input when 
converting from feet. For example, if you want to convert 12′-4″ to centimeters, you have to 
enter 12.333. In other words, you have to convert the inches to decimal feet. Because the Unit 
Conversion area is part of QuickCalc, this just means an extra step. You can quickly calculate the 
decimal feet equivalent of feet and inch values and then transfer them to the Units Conversion 
area.
Try the following to see how this works:
	
1.	 Click the Clear button in the QuickCalc toolbar (it looks like a calculator with a small red 
X next to it), and then double-click in the QuickCalc text box.
	
2.	 Enter 12 + (4 / 12)↵ in QuickCalc’s text box. The first 12 is the 12 feet. The 4 / 12 is for the 4 
inches converted to decimal feet. Once you press ↵, the value of 12.3333333 appears.
	
3.	 Right-click in the QuickCalc text box, ignore the context menu, and then click in the Value To 
Convert box in the Units Conversion panel. The 12.3333333 value is pasted into the text box.
	
4.	 Select Feet from the Convert From drop-down list, and select Centimeters from the 
Convert To drop-down list. The centimeter equivalent of 12.3333333 feet appears in the 
Converted Value box.
Here you saw how values from the text box automatically transfer to the Units Conversion 
area. You can also cut and paste values from other sources into either the main calculator text 
box or the Units Conversion box.
Using QuickCalc to Find Points
You’ve seen how QuickCalc will let you add values of distances and angles and how it can per-
form unit conversions. You can also use it to calculate coordinate locations. To work with coordi-
nates, you need to use a few special functions built into QuickCalc that let you select points and 
manipulate their value.
AutoCAD offers the Midpoint Between Two Points osnap, which enables you to select a point 
midway between two other points without drawing a temporary line. The AutoCAD Cal com-
mand offers another way to accomplish this. In the following steps, you’ll use QuickCalc to per-
form the same function as an example of how you can acquire point data and manipulate it to 
derive other coordinate locations:
	
1.	 Click the Clear button on the QuickCalc toolbar; then double-click in the QuickCalc text box.
	
2.	 In the QuickCalc text box, enter (end + end)/2↵. QuickCalc closes temporarily to allow 
you to select points.
	
3.	 Select the endpoints of the two lines, as shown in Figure 14.29.

Using the QuickCalc Calculator |  505  
QuickCalc returns and displays the coordinates of a point exactly between the two end-
points that you selected in step 3.
In step 2, you used the end function that is built into QuickCalc. As you saw, the end function 
lets you select the endpoint of an object (as you did in step 3). The end + end in the formula tells 
QuickCalc to add the two coordinates that you selected in step 3. The /2 in the formula divides 
the sum of the coordinates to find their average, which happens to be the midpoint between the 
two points.
If you were to perform this calculation using pencil and paper, you would add the x-, y-, and 
z-coordinate values of each point separately and then divide each coordinate by 2. Finally, you 
would combine the resulting x-, y-, and z-coordinates back into a single point location.
Using Osnap Modes in QuickCalc Expressions
In the previous exercise, you used osnap modes as part of arithmetic formulas (or expressions, as 
they’re called in AutoCAD). QuickCalc treats osnap modes as temporary placeholders for point 
coordinates until you pick the points.
The expression
(end + end)/2
finds the average of two values. In this case, the values are coordinates, so the average is the 
midpoint between the two coordinates. You can take this one step further and find the centroid 
of a triangle by using this expression:
(end + end + end)/3
Note that you enter only the first three letters of the osnap mode in calculator expres-
sions. Table 14.3 shows what to enter in an expression for osnap modes. The table includes 
two items that aren’t really osnap modes, although they work similarly when they’re used 
in an expression. The first is Rad. When you include Rad in an expression, you get the 
following prompt:
Select circle, arc or polyline segment for RAD function:
You can then select an arc, a polyline arc segment, or a circle to obtain a radius for the 
expression.

The other item, Cur, prompts you for a point. Instead of looking for specific geometry on 
an object, it just locates a point. You could have used Cur in the previous exercise in place of 
the End and Cen modes to create a more general-purpose midpoint locator, as in the following 
formula:
(cur + cur)/2
Pasting to the Command Line
Now that you have the coordinate for the midpoint, try the next exercise to apply that coordi-
nate to a command. In this example, you’ll use the coordinate found in step 3 as the starting 
point for a line:
	
1.	 Click the Line tool on the Draw panel.
	
2.	 In QuickCalc, right-click the (end + end)/2 listing in the display area, and then select 
Paste To Command Line (see Figure 14.30).

Using the QuickCalc Calculator |  507  
	
3.	 The coordinate value from the display area is pasted into the command line at the Line 
command’s Specify first point: prompt. Press ↵ to accept the input from QuickCalc. 
You see a rubber-banding line beginning at a point midway between the two endpoints 
of the lines that you selected in the previous exercise (see Figure 14.31).

two endpoints
The line starts midway
between the two endpoints.
	
4.	 Click another point to place the line in the drawing, and then press ↵ to exit the Line 
command.
Finding Fractional Distances between Two Points
Another ability AutoCAD users commonly need is to find a location that is a fractional distance 
along a line. For example, users frequently need to find a point that is one-third the distance 
from the endpoint of a line. Here’s how that can be accomplished using QuickCalc:
	
1.	 If the QuickCalc text box is not clear, click the Clear tool in the QuickCalc toolbar.

508  | CHAPTER 14  Advanced Editing and Organizing   
	
2.	 Enter plt (end, end, 0.333)↵ in the QuickCalc text box. QuickCalc closes temporarily to 
allow you to select points.
	
3.	 Click the endpoints of the line shown in Figure 14.32, starting with the lower-left end-
point. QuickCalc returns with the coordinates of a point that is 33.33 percent of the length 
of the line from the first endpoint that you selected.
Figure 14.32
Select these points to find 
a point that is one-third 
the distance from an 
endpoint.
Click the endpoints of this line.
	
4.	 Click the Line tool.
	
5.	 Click in the QuickCalc display area on the last entry, right-click, and choose Paste To 
Command Line.
	
6.	 Press ↵ and you see a line start at a point that is one-third the distance from the endpoint 
(see Figure 14.33).
Figure 14.33
A line starting at a 
point that is one-third 
the distance from the 
endpoint
	
7.	 Press Esc to exit the Line command. You don’t need to draw the line because this exercise 
is intended to show you only how the formula in step 1 works.
In step 1, you used a formula that contained the plt function. This function finds a point that 
is a particular percentage between two points. You specify the two points first, using the now 
familiar end function, and then you specify the percentage between the two endpoints as a 
decimal value. The (end, end, 0.333) indicates the two endpoints that you selected in step 2 and 
the percentage as a decimal value of 0.333.
In the formulas you’ve seen so far, you’ve used the end function to select endpoints. If you 
prefer to select your own osnaps during the point-selection process, you can use the cur func-
tion. Cur lets you use any osnap you want when selecting points. In the first example, you could 
use (cur + cur)/2 instead of (end + end)/2.

Using the QuickCalc Calculator |  509  
The plt function is just one of several special functions that you can use with QuickCalc. 
Table 14.4 lists other functions that you can use to find points in your drawing and gather other 
data. In the table, 2D points are represented as pt1, pt2, and so on. Three-dimensional points, or 
points describing a plane, are indicated by ptp1, ptp3, and so on. The center of an arc or a circle 
is indicated with apex for a 2D location and apex1 and apex2 for a 3D axis.

Using QuickCalc While in the Middle of a Command
In all the previous examples, you’ve used QuickCalc as a stand-alone calculator. You’ve also 
seen how you can insert a calculation into the command line while a command is in progress. A 
third way to work with QuickCalc is to open it while in the middle of a command.
In a previous exercise, you used the (end + end)/2 formula to find the midpoint between two 
points, and then you inserted the resulting value into the Line command. Suppose that you 
start the Line command before you open QuickCalc. Try the following to see how you can use 
QuickCalc once a command has been initiated:
	
1.	 Close QuickCalc.
	
2.	 Start the Line command.
	
3.	 Enter 'qc↵ to open QuickCalc.
	
4.	 In the QuickCalc text box, type (end + end)/2 but don’t press ↵. Instead, click the Apply 
button at the bottom of the QuickCalc window.
	
5.	 Select the endpoints of two lines. A line starts at the midpoint between the two points.
	
6.	 Click another point to draw the line, and then press ↵ to end the Line command.
In this exercise, you saw that an Apply option appears at the bottom of the QuickCalc win-
dow along with Close and Help buttons. These buttons aren’t present when you open QuickCalc 
with no command active. The Apply button executes the formula and then immediately returns 
the resulting value to the command. Using QuickCalc in this way eliminates a few steps.
You may have also noticed that QuickCalc appeared with a light background instead of a 
dark one. This can serve as a reminder that you are using QuickCalc in the middle of another 
command. You will also see “Active Command:” followed by the current active command name.
Finding a Point Relative to Another Point
Now, suppose that you want to start a line at a relative distance from another line. The following 
steps describe how to use the calculator to start a line from a point that is 2.5″ in the x-axis and 
5.0″ in the y-axis from the endpoint of another line:
	
1.	 Make sure that QuickCalc is closed, start the Line command, and select a point.
	
2.	 Right-click, select the QuickCalc tool, and type end + [2.5,5.0] in the text box.
	
3.	 Click the Apply button at the bottom of the QuickCalc window.
	
4.	 Click the endpoint of the line that you just drew. The new line connects to a point that is 
at a distance of 2.5 in the x-axis and 5.0 in the y-axis from the endpoint that you selected.
In this example, you used the Endpoint osnap mode to indicate a point of reference. This is 
added to Cartesian coordinates in square brackets, describing the distance and direction from 
the reference point. You could enter any coordinate value within the square brackets. You also 
could enter a polar coordinate in place of the Cartesian coordinate, as in the following: end + 
[5.59<63].
You can replace the end in the expression with the at sign (@) to continue from the last point 
that you selected. Also, it’s not necessary to include every coordinate in the square brackets. For 

Using the QuickCalc Calculator |  511  
example, to indicate a displacement in only one axis, you can leave out a value for the other two 
coordinates while leaving in the commas, as in the following examples:
[4,5] = [4,5,0]
[,1] = [0,1,0]
[,,2] = [0,0,2]
Combining Coordinates and Expressions
In the previous two examples, you saw that you can use an expression or enter coordinates. But 
what if you want to combine an expression within a coordinate? For example, in the beginning 
of this section, you added feet and inches and then transferred the result to the command line. 
In that example, you had to switch back and forth between QuickCalc and the command line to 
create the response for the Command prompt. If you prefer, you can create an expression that 
supplies the entire command input. Here are the steps to do this:
	
1.	 Close QuickCalc, and then start the Line command.
	
2.	 Enter 'qc↵ to open QuickCalc.
	
3.	 Enter the following in the text box:
End + [(4′+36+5′6)<45]
	
4.	 Click Apply.
	
5.	 In the drawing area, click the endpoint of a line. AutoCAD draws a line that begins at 
12′-6″ and at a 45° angle to the endpoint that you select.
In this exercise, you used the expression (4′+36+5′6) right in the middle of a coordinate value. 
As described earlier, the coordinate is within square brackets. By using this method, you can 
calculate measurements and apply them to commands more easily. The trick is to become famil-
iar with the syntax QuickCalc requires so that you can write these expressions without errors.
Storing Expressions and Values
The ability to create expressions to manipulate coordinates can be useful, but you may find 
it difficult to remember an expression once you’ve created it. Fortunately, QuickCalc offers 
the Variables section, which allows you to store frequently used expressions and values. The 
Variables section has its set of tools in its title bar (see Figure 14.34).
These tools let you add items to the list, edit items, or delete items from the list. A fourth 
option lets you send a variable to the main calculator text box. You can also right-click in the 
Variables section list box and select the same options from a context menu. In addition, the con-
text menu lets you create a new category and rename an existing one.
The Variables section also contains a list of currently stored variables. Some sample variables 
are shown in the list. If you hover over a variable, you see a description of that variable’s func-
tion in a tool tip by the cursor.
To use an existing variable, select it from the list and click the Return Variable To Input Area 
button; it looks like a calculator. To add a variable to the list, click the New Variable button, 
which opens the Variable Definition dialog box (see Figure 14.35).

This dialog box lets you enter the properties of the variable and choose the type. In the 
Variable Properties group, you enter the name of the variable in the Name text box. In the 
Group With drop-down list, you select a category under which your formula will appear in the 
Variables list. You can also create a new category. The Value Or Expression box is where you put 
your formula; it can also be a single value, such as a number or a coordinate. At the bottom is a 
space to enter a description for the variable. This description will appear in the Variables group’s 
detail box at the bottom of QuickCalc.
At the top, in the Variable Type group, you see two options: Constant and Function. If you 
choose Function, your variable will behave as it normally does when you enter it in the text box. 
If you choose Constant and your variable is a formula, your variable will be executed when you 
close the Variable Definition dialog box. The resulting value will become the value for the variable.

Guidelines for Working with QuickCalc
You may notice some patterns in the way expressions are formatted for the calculator. Here are 
some guidelines to remember:
◆
◆
Coordinates are enclosed in square brackets.
◆
◆
Nested or grouped expressions are enclosed in parentheses.
◆
◆
Operators are placed between values, as in simple math equations.
◆
◆
Object snaps can be used in place of coordinate values.
Table 14.5 lists the operators and functions available in QuickCalc. You may want to experi-
ment with these functions on your own. You can enter many of these operators using the keys 
on the numeric keypad or in the scientific group.

QuickCalc is capable of much more than the typical uses you’ve seen here. A description of 
its full capabilities extends beyond the scope of this book. However, the processes described in 
these sections will be helpful as you use AutoCAD. If you want to know more about QuickCalc, 
consult the AutoCAD Help User Documentation (enter QuickCalc in the InfoCenter text box).

Singling Out Proximate Objects
You’ll sometimes need to select an object that overlaps or is very close to another object. Often in 
this situation, you end up selecting the wrong object. To select the exact object that you want, you 
can use the Selection Cycling tool and the Draworder command.
Selection cycling lets you cycle through objects that overlap until you select the one that you want. 
To use this feature, hover over the overlapping objects so that one of them is highlighted; then hold 
down the Shift key and press the spacebar. With each press of the spacebar, a different overlapping 
object will be highlighted. When the object that you want to select is highlighted, click it.
Another way to gain access to an overlapped object is to use the Draworder command. You can 
select the overlapping object and then choose Send To Back from the Draworder flyout in the Home 
tab’s expanded Modify panel.

The Bottom Line |  515  
One reason that you would want to select an overlapping object is simply to delete a redundant line. 
AutoCAD offers the Delete Duplicate Object tool, which can be found in the Home tab’s expanded 
Modify panel.
This tool is designed to help you easily remove overlapping objects that are not easily seen. To use 
it, click the Delete Duplicate Object tool or type Overkill↵. At the Select objects: prompt, 
select the objects that are overlapping. A selection window can be used to select an area. Press ↵ 
and the Delete Duplicate Objects dialog box appears.
This dialog box gives you control over the criteria that AutoCAD uses to determine whether an 
object should be deleted. Make any changes necessary to the dialog box, and then click OK to 
remove duplicate overlapping objects.
The Bottom Line
Use external references (Xrefs).    You’ve seen how you can use Xrefs to quickly build varia-
tions of a floor plan that contain repetitive elements. This isn’t necessarily the only way to use 
Xrefs, but the basic idea of how to use Xrefs is presented in the early exercises.

Laying Out Your Printer Output 
Your set of drawings for the studio apartment building would probably include a larger-scale, 
more detailed drawing of the typical unit plan. You already have the beginnings of this drawing 
in the form of the Unit.dwg file.
As you’ve seen, the notes and dimensions that you entered into the Unit.dwg file can be 
turned off or frozen in the Plan.dwg file so that they don’t interfere with the graphics of the 
drawing. The Unit.dwg file can be part of another drawing file that contains more detailed 
information about the typical unit plan at a larger scale. To this new drawing, you can add 
notes, symbols, and dimensions. Whenever the Unit.dwg file is altered, you update its occur-
rence in the large-scale drawing of the typical unit as well as in the Plan.dwg file. The units 
are thus quickly updated, and good coordination is ensured among all the drawings for your 
project.
Now suppose that you want to combine drawings that have different scales in the same 
drawing file—for example, the overall plan of one floor plus an enlarged view of one typical 
unit. You can do so using the layout views and a feature called paper space.

Understanding Model Space and Paper Space
So far, you’ve explored ways to get around in your drawing while using a single view. This 
single-view representation of your AutoCAD® drawing is called Model Space display mode. You 
can also set up multiple views of your drawing by using what are called floating viewports. You 
create floating viewports in layout views in what is called Paper Space mode.
To get a clear understanding of the Model Space and Paper Space modes, imagine that your 
drawing is a full-sized replica or model of the object that you’re drawing. Your computer screen 
is your window into a “room” where this model is being constructed, and the keyboard and 
mouse are your means of access to this room. You can control your window’s position in rela-
tion to the object through the use of Pan, Zoom, View, and other display-related commands. You 
can also construct or modify the model by using drawing and editing commands. Think of this 
room as your model space.

518  | CHAPTER 15  Laying Out Your Printer Output   
You’ve been working on your drawings by looking through a single window into model 
space. Now, suppose that you can step back and add windows with different views looking into 
your model space; the effect is like having several video cameras in your model space room, 
each connected to a different monitor. You can view all your windows at once on your computer 
screen or enlarge a single window to fill the entire screen. Furthermore, you can control the 
shape of your windows and easily switch from one window to another. This is what paper space 
is like.
Paper space lets you create and display multiple views of model space. Each view window, 
called a viewport, acts like an individual virtual screen. One viewport can have an overall view 
of your drawing while another can be a close-up. You can also control layer visibility individu-
ally for each viewport and display different versions of the same area of your drawing. You 
can move, copy, and stretch viewports and even overlap them. You can set up another type of 
viewport, called the tiled viewport, in model space. Chapter 21, “Using Advanced 3D Features,” 
discusses this type of viewport.
One of the more powerful features of paper space is the ability to plot several views of the 
same drawing on one sheet of paper. You can also include graphic objects such as borders and 
notes that appear only in paper space. In this function, paper space acts much like a page-layout 
program such as QuarkXPress or Adobe InDesign. You can paste up different views of your 
drawing and then add borders, title blocks, general notes, and other types of graphic and textual 
data. Figure 15.1 shows the Plan drawing set up in Paper Space mode to display several views.

Switching from Model Space to Paper Space
You can get to paper space by clicking any of the Layout tabs below the drawing area. You can 
also use the layout previews in the drawing tab.

Don’t See the Layout Tabs?
If your version of AutoCAD does not show the Layout and Model tabs, you can turn them on by 
doing the following: Right-click in the drawing area, and select Options from the context menu. 
In the Options dialog box, select the Display tab and then, in the Layout elements panel, turn on 
the Display Layout and Model tabs option. Click OK when you are finished.
Let’s start with the basics of switching between model and paper space:
	
1.	 Open the Xref-1 file that you saved from the previous chapter, and make sure that your dis-
play shows the entire drawing. You can also use 15-xref1.dwg or 15-xref1-metric.dwg.
	
2.	 Click the Layout1 tab in the lower-left corner of the drawing area. You see your drawing 
appear in a kind of page preview view (see Figure 15.2).
Figure 15.2
Your drawing in a 
page preview view
	
3.	 Click the Model tab in the lower-left corner of the drawing area to return to model space.
This brief exercise shows you how quickly you can shift between model space and paper 
space by using the Model and Layout1 tabs:
	
1.	 Hover over the Drawing tab, and you’ll see preview images of the model and paper space 
layouts (see Figure 15.3). The current layout is highlighted with a blue border.

520  | CHAPTER 15  Laying Out Your Printer Output   
	
2.	 Point to Layout1 preview image; the drawing area will temporarily display a full view of 
the layout.
	
3.	 Click in the Layout1 image to confirm your selection of the layout view.
	
4.	 Hover over the drawing tab again, but this time click the preview panel to the left labeled 
Model.
	
5.	 Click the Model image to go back to the Model Space view.
Note that when you hover over a preview image, the Plot and Publish icons appear in the top 
corners of the image (see Figure 15.4).

If you prefer, you can use keyboard shortcuts to switch between model and paper space. 
Press Ctrl+PgDn to go from model space to paper space. Press Ctrl+PgUp to go from paper space 
to model space. If there are several paper space layout tabs, Ctrl+PgDn opens the next layout tab 
to the right and Ctrl+PgUp opens the next layout tab to the left.
Setting the Size of a Paper Space Layout
We mentioned that paper space is like a page-layout program, and you saw how a paper space 
layout looks like a print preview. You can set up your layout for a specific set of printer settings, 
including the paper size and printer.

Understanding Model Space and Paper Space |  521  
Let’s continue with our look at paper space by seeing how you can set up a paper space lay-
out for your printer:
	
1.	 Click the Layout1 tab.
	
2.	 Right-click the Layout1 tab, and choose Page Setup Manager to open the resizable Page 
Setup Manager dialog box. Notice that the name of the current layout is shown in the list 
of current page setups (see Figure 15.5).
Figure 15.5
The Page Setup Manager
	
3.	 Click the Modify button to open the Page Setup dialog box.
	
4.	 Select the Letter paper-size option from the Paper Size drop-down list. Metric users 
should select A4 (210 mm x 297 mm). The paper size that you select here determines the 
shape and margin of the paper space layout area.
	
5.	 Select a printer from the Printer/Plotter Name drop-down list.
	
6.	 Click OK to close the Page Setup dialog box, and then click Close to close the Page Setup 
Manager.
AutoCAD bases the paper space layout on the paper size and printer that you specify in 
steps 4 and 5. The area shown in paper space reflects the area of the paper size that you selected 
in step 4, and the printer determines the paper margin, shown by a dashed line. If for some 
reason you need to change the paper size, repeat steps 2 through 5. You can also store the way 
you’ve set up your paper space layout using the Page Setup Manager that you saw in step 2. See 
Chapter 8, “Introducing Printing, Plotting, and Layouts,” for more on this feature.

522  | CHAPTER 15  Laying Out Your Printer Output   
Creating New Paper Space Viewports
As you saw in Chapter 8, the different look of the layout view tells you that you’re in paper 
space. You also learned that a viewport is automatically created when you first open a layout 
view. The layout viewport displays an overall view of your drawing to no particular scale.
In this section, you’ll work with multiple viewports in paper space instead of just the default 
single viewport that you get when you open the layout view.
This first exercise shows you how to create three new viewports at once:
	
1.	 Click the viewport’s outline to select it. The viewport is the solid rectangle surrounding 
your drawing, just inside the dashed rectangle.
	
2.	 Click the Erase tool in the Home tab’s Modify panel to erase the viewport. Your drawing 
disappears. Don’t panic; remember that the viewport is like a window to model space. 
The objects in model space are still there.
	
3.	 Click the Named tool in the Layout tab’s Layout Viewports panel to open the Viewports 
dialog box. You can also type Vports↵.
	
4.	 Click the New Viewports tab. This tab contains a set of predefined viewport layouts (see 
Figure 15.6). You’ll learn more about the Viewports dialog box and its options in Chapter 21.
Figure 15.6
The Viewports dialog 
box
	
5.	 Click the Three: Above option in the Standard Viewports list box. The box to the right 
shows a sample view of the Three: Above layout that you selected.
	
6.	 Click OK. The Specify first corner or [Fit] <Fit>: prompt appears.
	
7.	 Press ↵ to accept the default Fit option. The Fit option fits the viewport layout to the maximum 
area allowed in your paper space view. Three rectangles appear in the formation, as shown in 

Understanding Model Space and Paper Space |  523  
Figure 15.7. Each of these is a viewport to your model space. The viewport at the top fills the 
whole width of the drawing area; the bottom half of the screen is divided into two viewports.
Figure 15.7
The newly created 
viewports
When you create new viewports, AutoCAD automatically fills them with the extents of your 
model space drawing. You can specify an exact scale for each viewport, as you’ll see later.
Notice that the dashed line representing your paper margin has disappeared. That’s because 
the viewports are pushed to the margin limits, thereby covering the dashed line.
You could have kept the original viewport that appeared when you first opened the Layout1 
view and then added two new viewports. Completely replacing the single viewport is a bit sim-
pler because the Viewports dialog box fits the viewports into the allowed space for you.
After you’ve set up a paper space layout, it remains part of the drawing. You may prefer to 
use model space for doing most of your drawing and then use paper space layouts for setting up 
views for printing. Changes that you make to your drawing in model space will automatically 
appear in your paper space layout viewports.
Reaching Inside Viewports
Now, suppose that you need access to the objects in the viewports in order to adjust their dis-
play and to edit your drawing. Try these steps:
	
1.	 Double-click inside a viewport. This gives you control over model space even though 
you’re in paper space. (You can also enter MS↵ as a keyboard shortcut to enter Model 
Space mode.)
The first thing that you notice is that the UCS icon changes back to its L-shaped form. 	
	
2.	 Move your cursor over each viewport. In one of the viewports, the cursor appears as 
the AutoCAD crosshair cursor, whereas in the other viewports it appears as an arrow 
pointer. The viewport that shows the AutoCAD cursor is the active one; you can pan, 
zoom, and edit objects in the active viewport.
	
3.	 Click in the lower-left viewport to activate it.
	
4.	 Click Window from the Zoom flyout on the View tab’s Navigate 2D panel, and place a 
window selection around the elevator area.
	
5.	 Click the lower-right viewport, and choose Zoom Window from the Zoom flyout on the 
Navigation bar to enlarge your view of a typical unit. You can also use the Pan and Zoom 

524  | CHAPTER 15  Laying Out Your Printer Output   
Realtime tools. If you don’t see the UCS icon, it has been turned off. Type UCSicon↵On↵ 
to turn it on. See Chapter 21 for more on the UCS icon.
You can move from viewport to viewport even while you’re in the middle of most com-
mands. For example, you can issue the Line command, pick the start point in one viewport, go 
to a different viewport to pick the next point, and so on. To activate a different viewport, you 
click inside the viewport (see Figure 15.8).
Switching between Viewports
We’ve found that users will have a need to overlap viewports from time to time. When they do this, 
they are often at a loss over how to switch between the overlapping viewports, especially when 
one is completely surrounded by another or when they are exactly the same size and in the same 
position. In this situation, you can move between viewports by pressing Ctrl+R repeatedly until 
you get to the viewport that you want.
Figure 15.8
The three viewports, 
each with a different 
view of the plan
Model Space UCS icon
You’ve seen how you can zoom into a viewport view, but what happens when you use the 
Zoom command while in paper space? Try the following exercise to find out:
	
1.	 Double-click an area outside the viewports to get out of Floating model space.
	
2.	 Select Zoom Realtime from the Zoom flyout in the Navigation bar and then zoom into the 
paper space view. The entire view enlarges, including the views in the viewports.
	
3.	 Click All from the Zoom flyout or enter Z↵A↵ to return to the overall view of paper space.
This brief exercise showed that you can use the Zoom tool in paper space just as you would in 
model space. All of the display-related commands are available, including the Pan Realtime command.

Working with Paper Space Viewports |  525  
Working with Paper Space Viewports
Paper space is intended as a page-layout or composition tool. You can manipulate viewports’ 
sizes, scale their views independently of one another, and even set layering and linetype scales 
independently.
Let’s try manipulating the shape and location of viewports by using the Home tab’s Modify 
panel options:
	
1.	 Make sure that Object Snap is turned off in the status bar.
	
2.	 Make sure that you’re in a layout view. Then click the bottom edge of the lower-left view-
port to expose its grips (see the top image in Figure 15.9).
Figure 15.9
Stretching, erasing, 
and moving viewports
Stretch the viewport 
grip to this location.
Move the viewport here.
	
3.	 Click the upper-right grip, and drag it to the location shown in the top image in Figure 15.9.

526  | CHAPTER 15  Laying Out Your Printer Output   
	
4.	 Press the Esc key, and erase the lower-right viewport by selecting it and clicking Erase in 
the Home tab’s Modify panel or by pressing the Delete key.
	
5.	 Move the lower-left viewport so that it’s centered in the bottom half of the window, as 
shown in the bottom image in Figure 15.9.
In this exercise, you clicked the viewport edge to select it for editing. If while in paper 
space you attempt to click the image in the viewport, you won’t select anything. Later, you’ll 
see that you can use the osnap modes to snap to parts of the drawing image in a viewport.
Because viewports are recognized as AutoCAD objects, you can manipulate them by using all 
of the editing commands, just as you would manipulate any other object. In the previous exercise, 
you moved, stretched, and erased viewports. Next, you’ll see how layers affect viewports:
	
1.	 Create a new layer called Vport.
	
2.	 Using the Properties palette, assign the viewports to the Vport layer.
	
3.	 Turn off the Vport layer. The viewport outlines disappear.
	
4.	 After reviewing the results of step 3, turn the Vport layer back on.
You can assign a layer, a color, a linetype, and even a lineweight to a viewport’s outline. If 
you put the viewport on a layer that has been turned off or frozen, that outline becomes invisi-
ble, just like any other object on such a layer. Or you can put the viewport on a nonprinting layer 
so that the outline will be visible while you’re editing. Making a viewport’s outlines invisible or 
putting them on a nonprinting layer is helpful when you want to compose a final sheet for print-
ing. Even when turned off, the active viewport has a heavy outline around it when you switch to 
Floating model space, and all of the viewports still display their views.
Scaling Views in Paper Space
Paper space has its own unit of measure. You’ve already seen how you’re required to specify a 
paper size when opening a layout view to a paper space view. When you first enter paper space, 
regardless of the area your drawing occupies in model space, you’re given limits that are set by the 
paper size that you specify in the Page Setup dialog box. If you keep in mind that paper space is like 
a paste-up area that is dependent on the printer that you configured for AutoCAD, this difference of 
scale becomes easier to comprehend. Just as you might paste up photographs and maps represent-
ing several square miles onto an 11″×17″ board, so too you can use paper space to paste up views 
of scale drawings representing city blocks or houses on an 81/2″×11″ sheet of paper. However, in 
AutoCAD, you have the freedom to change the scale and size of the objects that you’re pasting up.
While in paper space, you can edit objects in a model space viewport, but to do so you must use 
Floating model space. To get to Floating model space, double-click inside a viewport. You can then 
click inside any viewport and edit in that viewport. In this mode, objects that were created in paper 
space can’t be edited. Double-click outside a viewport to go back to the paper space environment.
If you want to be able to print your drawing at a specific scale, you must indicate a scale for 
each viewport. Viewport scales are set in a way similar to the annotation scale in the Model tab. 
Let’s see how to put together a sheet in paper space and still maintain accuracy of scale:
	
1.	 Make sure that you’re in paper space. You can tell by the shape and location of the UCS 
icon. If it looks like a triangle in the lower-left corner of the layout view, then you are in 
paper space.

Working with Paper Space Viewports |  527  
	
2.	 Click the topmost viewport’s outline to select it.
	
3.	 In the lower-right portion of the AutoCAD window, click the Viewport Scale drop-down 
list and select 1⁄32″ = 1′-0″. Metric users should click Custom and add a custom scale of 
1:40. Then select the 1:40 scale from the Viewport Scale drop-down list. Notice how the 
view in the upper viewport changes.
	
4.	 Press the Esc key twice to clear the selection of the viewport.
	
5.	 Click the lower viewport border.
	
6.	 Click the Viewport Scale drop-down list again, and select 3⁄16″ = 1′-0″ from the list. 
Metric users should select 1:8. The view in the viewport changes to reflect the new scale 
(see Figure 15.10).
Figure 15.10
Paper space viewport 
views scaled to 1⁄32″ 
= 1′-0″ and 3⁄16″ = 
1′-0″ (1:40 and 1:8 for 
metric users)
It’s easy to adjust the width, height, and location of the viewports so that they display only 
the parts of the unit you want to see. While in paper space, use the Stretch, Move, Scale, or 
Rotate command to edit any viewport border, or use the viewport’s grips to edit its size and 
shape. The view in the viewport remains at the same scale and location while the viewport 
changes in size. You can move and stretch viewports with no effect on the size and location of 
the objects in the view. When you rotate the viewport, the view inside the viewport will also 
rotate.
If you need to overlay one drawing on top of another, you can overlap viewports. Use the 
osnap overrides to select geometry in each viewport, even while in paper space. This lets you 
align one viewport on top of another at exact locations.
You can also add a title block in paper space at a 1:1 scale to frame your viewports and then 
plot this drawing from paper space at a scale of 1:1. Your plot appears just as it does in paper 
space at the appropriate scale. Paper space displays a dashed line to show you where the non-
printable areas occur near the edge of the paper.

528  | CHAPTER 15  Laying Out Your Printer Output   
While you’re working in paper space, pay close attention to whether you’re in paper space or 
Floating model space. It’s easy to pan or zoom in a Floating model space viewport accidentally 
when you intend to pan or zoom your paper space view. This can cause you to lose your view-
port scaling or alignment with other parts of the drawing.
It’s a good idea to save viewport views in case you happen to change a viewport view acci-
dentally. You can do this by using the following procedure: Double-click inside a viewport 
whose view you want to save. Select View Manager from the View tab’s Views panel, and 
then, in the View Manager, click the New button (see “Saving Views” in Chapter 7, “Mastering 
Viewing Tools, Hatches, and External References,” for a description of the View Manager dialog 
box).
Another way to prevent your viewport view from being accidentally altered is to turn on 
View Lock. To do this, while in paper space click a viewport’s outline. Right-click to open the 
context menu, and then choose Display Locked ➢ Yes. After the view is locked, you can’t pan or 
zoom within a viewport. This setting is also available in the viewport’s Properties palette and in 
the status bar to the left of the Viewport Scale tool when a viewport is selected or when you are 
in Floating model space.
Setting Layers in Individual Viewports
Another unique feature of paper space viewports is their ability to freeze layers independently. 
You can, for example, display the usual plan information in the overall view of a floor but show 
only the walls in the enlarged view of one unit.
You control viewport layer visibility through the Layer Properties Manager. You may have 
noticed that there are three sun icons for each layer listing.
To see all the layer options, you may need to widen the Layer Properties Manager to view all 
of the columns. To do so, click and drag the right border of the dialog box to the right.
You’re already familiar with the sun icon farthest to the left. This is the Freeze/Thaw icon 
that controls the freezing and thawing of layers globally. Several columns to the right of that 
icon are two sun icons with transparent rectangles. These icons control the freezing and thaw-
ing of layers in individual viewports. Of this pair, the one on the left controls newly created 
viewports and the one on the right controls settings for existing viewports.
This exercise shows you firsthand how the sun icon for existing viewports works:
	
1.	 Double-click inside a viewport to go to Floating model space.
	
2.	 Activate the lower viewport.
	
3.	 Open the Layer Properties Manager.
	
4.	 Locate the COMMON|WALL layer, and then click its name to help you see the layer 
clearly.

Working with Paper Space Viewports |  529  
	
5.	 Click the column labeled VP Freeze for the selected layer (see Figure 15.11). You may need 
to widen the Layer Properties Manager to do this; the column title may show only V until 
you widen the column. The VP Freeze column is the seventh column from the right side of 
the dialog box. Click the icon, which looks like a transparent rectangle behind a sun. The 
sun changes to a snowflake, telling you that the layer is now frozen for the current viewport.
Figure 15.11
Select the VP Freeze 
option for the 
COMMON|WALL 
layer.
The Wall layer of the Common Xref becomes invisible in the current viewport. However, 
the walls remain visible in the other viewport (see Figure 15.12).

COMMON|WALL layer

viewport
	
6.	 After reviewing the effects of the VP Freeze setting, go back to the Layer Properties 
Manager and thaw the COMMON|WALL layer by clicking its VP Freeze icon again so 
that it turns back into a sun.
	
7.	 Take a moment to study the drawing, and then save the Xref-1.dwg file.

530  | CHAPTER 15  Laying Out Your Printer Output   
You may have noticed another, identical sun icon next to the one that you used in the previ-
ous exercise. This icon controls layer visibility in any new viewports that you create next rather 
than in existing viewports.
If you prefer, you can use the layer drop-down list in the Layers panel to freeze layers in indi-
vidual viewports. Double-click in the viewport that you want to modify, select the layer from 
the list, and then click the same sun icon with the small rectangle behind it.
In addition to setting the visibility of layers, you can set the other layer properties—such 
as color, linetype, and lineweight—for each viewport. First, make sure that you’re in Floating 
model space for the viewport whose layers you want to set up, and then open the Layer 
Properties Manager. You can set the properties for the current viewport using the VP Freeze, VP 
Color, VP Linetype, VP Lineweight, VP Transparency, and VP Plot Style settings for each layer 
(see Figure 15.13).
This section concludes the apartment building tutorial. Although you haven’t drawn the 
complete building, you’ve learned all the commands and techniques that you need to do so. 
Figure 15.14 shows you a completed plan of the first floor. To complete your floor plans and get 
some practice using AutoCAD, you may want to add the symbols shown in this figure to your 
Plan.dwg file.

Working with Paper Space Viewports |  531  
Because buildings like this one often have the same plans for several floors, the plan for the 
second floor can also represent the third floor. Combined with the first floor, this gives you 
a three-level apartment building. This project might also have a ground-level garage, which 
would be a separate file. You can use the Col-grid.dwg or Col-grid-metric.dwg file in the 
garage file as a reference for dimensions. The other symbols can be blocks stored as files that 
you can retrieve in other files.
Masking Out Parts of a Drawing
Chapter 7 described a method for using the AutoCAD Draworder feature to hide floor patterns 
under equipment or furniture in a floor layout. You can use a similar method to hide irregularly 
shaped areas in a paper space viewport. This is desirable for plotting site plans, civil plans, or floor 
plans that require portions of the drawing to be masked out. You may also want to mask part of a 
plan that is overlapped by another to expose dimension or text data.
Creating and Using Multiple Paper Space Layouts
You’re not limited to just one or two paper space layouts. You can have as many as you want, 
with each layout set up for a different sheet size containing different views of your drawing. 
You can use this feature to set up multiple drawing sheets based on a single AutoCAD draw-
ing file. For example, suppose that a client requires full sets of plans in both 1⁄8″ = 1′ scale and 
1⁄16″ = 1′ scale. You can set up two Layout tabs, each with a different sheet size and viewport 
scale.
You can also set up different paper space layouts for the various types of drawings. A single 
drawing can contain the data for mechanical layout, equipment and furnishings, floor plans, 
and reflected ceiling plans. Although a project can require a file for each floor plan, a single file 
with multiple layout views can serve the same purpose in AutoCAD 2017.
To create new layout views, do the following:
	
1.	 Click the New Layout tab from the layout tabs in the lower-left corner of the drawing area 
(see Figure 15.15). A new preview panel appears, labeled Layout2.
Certiﬁcation
Objective
Figure 15.15
The New Layout tab
	
2.	 Click the new Layout2 tab. The new layout appears with a single default viewport.
You’ve just seen how you can create a new layout using the New Layout tab. You can also right-
click any layout tab to open a context menu that offers a New Layout option (see Figure 15.16).

532  | CHAPTER 15  Laying Out Your Printer Output   
The Layout tab context menu also includes the From Template option and the Move Or Copy 
option. The From Template option lets you create a paper space layout based on an AutoCAD 
template file. AutoCAD provides several standard layouts that include title blocks based on 
common sheet sizes. The Move Or Copy option lets you move or copy an existing tab. For exam-
ple, to move a layout tab to the far right, right-click the tab you want to move and then select the 
Move Or Copy option to open the resizable Move Or Copy dialog box (see Figure 15.17). Select 
(Move To End) and click OK. The selected layout tab will move to the right end of the tabs.
Figure 15.16
The New Layout 
context menu option
Figure 15.17
The layout tab’s Move 
Or Copy dialog box
Finally, if you want to delete or rename a layout, right-click the layout tab that you want to 
edit. You can then select Delete or Rename from the context menu that appears. If you select 
Delete, you’ll see a warning message telling you that AutoCAD will permanently delete the lay-
out you have chosen to delete. Click OK to confirm your deletion.
Creating Odd-Shaped Viewports
In many situations, a rectangular viewport doesn’t provide a view appropriate for what you want to 
accomplish. For example, you might want to isolate part of a floor plan that is L shaped or circular. 
You can create viewports for virtually any shape you need. You can grip-edit a typical rectangular 

Creating Odd-Shaped Viewports |  533  
viewport to change its shape into a trapezoid or other irregular four-sided polygon. You can also 
use the Clip tool to create more complex viewport shapes, as the following exercise demonstrates.
Follow these steps to set up a layout view that shows only the lower apartment units and the 
elevators and stairs:
	
1.	 Click the Clip tool in the Layout tab’s Layout Viewports panel. You can also type 
Vpclip↵.
	
2.	 At the Select viewport to clip: prompt, click the viewport border.
	
3.	 At the Select clipping object or [Polygonal] <Polygonal>: prompt, press ↵.
	
4.	 Turn off Object Snap, and draw the outline shown in the top portion of Figure 15.18.
	
5.	 After you finish selecting points, press ↵. The viewport changes to conform to the new 
shape as shown in the bottom portion of Figure 15.18.
Figure 15.18

outline for a viewport
Draw this polygon outline.

534  | CHAPTER 15  Laying Out Your Printer Output   
	
6.	 Click the viewport border to expose its grips.
	
7.	 Click a grip, and move it to a new location. The viewport view conforms to the new shape.
The new viewport shape gives you more flexibility in isolating portions of a drawing. This 
can be especially useful if you have a large project that is divided into smaller sheets. You can 
set up several layout views, each displaying a different portion of the plan.
What if you want a viewport that isn’t rectilinear? This exercise shows you how to create a 
circular viewport:
	
1.	 Erase the viewport that you just modified.
	
2.	 Draw a circle that roughly fills the paper space area.
	
3.	 In the Layout tab’s Layout Viewports panel, choose Object from the Viewport flyout. You 
can also type -VPORTS↵O↵.
	
4.	 Click the circle. The plan appears inside the circle, as shown in Figure 15.19.
Figure 15.19
A circular viewpoint
To simplify this exercise, you were asked to draw a circle as the basis for a new viewport. 
However, you aren’t limited to circles; you can use a closed polyline or spline of any shape. (See 
Chapter 18, “Drawing Curves,” for a detailed discussion of polylines and splines.) You can also use 
the Polygon tool on the Home tab’s Draw panel to create a shape and then turn it into a viewport.
If you look carefully at the series of prompts for the previous exercise, you’ll notice that 
the Layout Viewports Object tool invokes a command-line version of the Vports command 

Understanding Lineweights, Linetypes, and Dimensions in Paper Space  |  535  
(-vports), which offers some options that the standard Vports command doesn’t. The following 
options are available with the command-line version of Vports:
_-VPORTS
Specify corner of viewport or
[ON/OFF/Fit/Shadeplot/Lock/Object/Polygonal/Restore/LAyer/2/3/4] <Fit>:
You used two of the options—Polygonal and Object—in the two previous exercises.
Understanding Lineweights, Linetypes,  
and Dimensions in Paper Space
The behavior of several AutoCAD features depends on whether you’re in paper space or model space. 
The most visible of these features are lineweights, linetypes, and dimensions. In the following sections, 
you’ll take a closer look at these features and see how to use them in conjunction with paper space.
Controlling and Viewing Lineweights in Paper Space
Lineweights can greatly improve the readability of technical drawings. You can make impor-
tant features stand out with bold lineweights while keeping the noise of smaller details from 
overpowering a drawing. In architectural floor plans, walls are traditionally drawn with heavier 
lines so that the outline of a plan can be easily read. Other features exist in a drawing for refer-
ence only, so they’re drawn in a lighter weight than normal.
If you look at Bonus Chapter 5, “Understanding Plot Styles,” available at www.omura.com/
chapters, you will see how to control lineweights in AutoCAD by using plot style tables. You 
can apply either a named plot style table or a color plot style table to a drawing. If you already 
have a library of AutoCAD drawings, you may want to use color plot style tables for backward 
compatibility. AutoCAD also enables you to assign lineweights directly to layers or objects and 
to view the results of your lineweight settings in paper space.
Here’s an exercise that demonstrates how to set lineweights directly:
	
1.	 Open the Layer Properties Manager.
	
2.	 Right-click the Layer list, and choose Select All.
	
3.	 Click the Lineweight column (not the column header) to open the Lineweight dialog box 
(see Figure 15.20).
Figure 15.20
The Lineweight dialog 
box

536  | CHAPTER 15  Laying Out Your Printer Output   
	
4.	 Select 0.13 mm from the list, and click OK. You’ve just assigned the 0.13 mm lineweight to 
all layers.
	
5.	 Right-click the Layer list again, and choose Clear All.
	
6.	 Click the COMMON|WALL layer, and Ctrl+click the Floor1|WALL layer to select these 
two layers.
	
7.	 Click the Lineweight column for either of the two selected layers to open the Lineweight 
dialog box again.
	
8.	 Select 0.40 mm from the dialog box, and click OK. You’ve just assigned the 0.40 mm line-
weight to the two selected layers.
	
9.	 Click Close in the Layer Properties Manager.
Although you set the lineweights for the layers in the drawing, you need to make a few more 
changes to the file settings before they’re visible in paper space:
	
1.	 Type LW↵ to open the Lineweight Settings dialog box (see Figure 15.21).
Figure 15.21
The Lineweight 
Settings dialog box
	
2.	 Select the Display Lineweight check box, and then click OK.
	
3.	 Make sure that you’re in paper space, and then zoom into the drawing. The lines 
representing the walls are now thicker, as shown in Figure 15.22.

Understanding Lineweights, Linetypes, and Dimensions in Paper Space  |  537  
	
4.	 After reviewing the results of this exercise, close the file. You may save it for future 
reference.
With the ability to display lineweights in paper space, you have better control over your out-
put. Instead of using a trial-and-error method to print your drawing and then checking your 
printout to see whether the lineweights are correct, you can see the lineweights on your screen.
This exercise showed you how to set lineweights so that they appear in paper space as they 
will when you plot your drawing. If you normally plot your drawings in black, you can go one 
step further and set all your layer colors to black to see how your plots will look. But you’ll need 
to save your layer settings so that you can restore the layers to their original colors. Another way 
to view your drawing in black and white without affecting your layer settings is to use the color 
plot style table described in Bonus Chapter 5.
Figure 15.22

the plan with line-
weights displayed
Lineweight Display Shortcut
When lineweight display is turned on, you see lineweights in model space as well as in paper space. 
Lineweights can be distracting while you work on your drawing in model space, but you can quickly 
turn them off by entering Lwdisplay↵Off↵ at the command line. Entering Lwdisplay↵On↵ turns 
the lineweight display back on. If you find that you need to do this often, you can add the LineWeight 
tool to the status bar. This tool will turn lineweight display on and off with a click of your mouse. 
You can add this tool to the status bar by clicking the Customization tool in the lower-right corner 
of the AutoCAD window and selecting LineWeight.

538  | CHAPTER 15  Laying Out Your Printer Output   
The Lineweight Settings Dialog Box
The Lineweight Settings dialog box includes a few other settings that you didn’t use in the pre-
vious exercise. Here is a description of those settings:
Units For Listing    You can choose between millimeters and inches for the unit of measure 
for lineweights. The default is millimeters.
Adjust Display Scale    This setting lets you control just how thick lineweights appear in the 
drawing. Move the slider to the right for thicker lines and to the left for thinner lines. This 
setting affects only the display on your monitor. As you move the slider, you can see a sample 
of the results in the Lineweights list box just to the left of the slider. You may have to scroll 
down the list box to view the effects.
Default Drop-Down List    This drop-down list lets you select the default lineweight that 
you see in the Layer Properties Manager. You may want to lower the default lineweight to 
0.005″ (0.13 mm) as a matter of course because most printers these days can print lines that 
size and even smaller.
Linetype Scales and Paper Space
As you’ve seen in previous exercises, you must carefully control drawing scales when creating 
viewports. Fortunately, this is easily done through the Properties palette. Although paper space 
offers the flexibility of combining images of different scale in one display, it also adds to the 
complexity of your task in controlling that display. Your drawing’s linetype scale in particular 
needs careful attention.
In Chapter 5, “Keeping Track of Layers and Blocks,” you saw that you had to set the 
linetype scale to the scale factor of the drawing in order to make the linetype visible. If you 
intend to plot that same drawing from paper space, you have to set the linetype scale back 
to 1 to get the linetypes to appear correctly. This is because AutoCAD faithfully scales line-
types to the current unit system. Remember that paper space units are different from model 
space units. When you scale a model space image down to fit in the smaller paper space 
area, the linetypes remain scaled to the increased linetype scale settings. In the Chapter 5 
example, linetypes are scaled up by a factor of 24. This causes noncontinuous lines to appear 
as continuous in paper space because you see only a small portion of a greatly enlarged 
noncontinuous linetype.
The Psltscale system variable enables you to determine how linetype scales are applied 
to paper space views. You can set Psltscale so that the linetypes appear the same regardless 
of whether you view them directly in model space or through a viewport in paper space. By 
default, this system variable is set to 1. This causes AutoCAD to scale all the linetypes uni-
formly across all the viewports in paper space. You can set Psltscale to 0 to force the view-
ports to display linetypes exactly as they appear in model space. Psltscale is not a global 
setting. You must set it for each layout view that you create; otherwise, the default value of 1 
will be used.
You can also control this setting in the Linetype Manager dialog box (type LT↵). When you 
click the Show Details button, you see a setting called Use Paper Space Units For Scaling in the 

Understanding Lineweights, Linetypes, and Dimensions in Paper Space  |  539  
lower-left corner. When this check box is selected, Psltscale is set to 1. When it isn’t selected, 
Psltscale is set to 0.
Dimensioning in Paper Space Layouts
At times, you may find it more convenient to add dimensions to your drawing in paper space 
rather than directly on your objects in model space. This can be useful if you have a small 
project with several viewports in a layout and you want to keep dimensions aligned between 
viewports. You have two basic options when dimensioning model space objects in paper space. 
The Associative Dimensioning feature can make quick work of dimensions for layout views 
containing drawings of differing scales. Alternatively, if you prefer not to use Associative 
Dimensioning, you can adjust settings for individual dimension styles.
Using Associative Dimensioning in Paper Space
Perhaps the simplest way to dimension in paper space is to use the Associative Dimensioning 
feature. With this feature turned on, you can dimension model space objects while in a paper 
space layout. Furthermore, paper space dimensions of model space objects are automatically 
updated if the model space object is edited.
Try the following exercise to see how Associative Dimensioning works:
	
1.	 Click New from the Quick Access toolbar, and use the acad.dwt template to create a new 
blank file. Metric users should use the acadiso.dwt template.
	
2.	 Draw a rectangle 12 units wide by 4 units high. If you’re using a metric file, make the 
rectangle 480 units wide by 160 units high.
	
3.	 Select the Layout1 tab.
	
4.	 Right-click the Layout1 tab, and select Page Setup Manager.
	
5.	 In the Page Setup Manager, click Modify. Then, in the Page Setup dialog box, select a 
printer from the Printer/Plotter group’s Name drop-down list.
	
6.	 Choose the Letter paper size in the Paper Size section. Metric users can pick ISO A4 
(297.00 × 210.00 mm).
	
7.	 Click OK, and then close the Page Setup Manager.
	
8.	 Right-click in the drawing area, and choose Options from the context menu.
	
9.	 In the Options dialog box, click the User Preferences tab and make sure that the Make 
New Dimensions Associative option in the Associative Dimensioning group is turned on 
(shows a check mark). Click OK to exit the dialog box.
Next, you’ll use the rectangle you drew in model space to test the Associative Dimensioning 
feature in the Layout1 view:
	
1.	 Click Linear from the Annotate tab’s Dimensions panel. Using the Endpoint osnap, 
dimension the bottom edge of the rectangle that you drew in model space. The dimension 
shows 12.0000 (480 for metric drawings), the actual size of the rectangle.

540  | CHAPTER 15  Laying Out Your Printer Output   
Plot
Publish
	
2.	 Double-click inside the viewport, and use the Zoom Realtime tool to zoom out a bit 
so that the rectangle appears smaller in the viewport. Do not use the scroll wheel of 
your mouse to do this (see the next section, “Updating Associative Dimensions”). 
After you exit the Zoom Realtime tool, the dimension follows the new view of the 
rectangle.
	
3.	 While you’re in Floating model space, click the rectangle and then click the grip in the 
lower-left corner and drag it upward and to the right.
	
4.	 Click again to place the corner of the rectangle in a new location. The dimension changes 
to conform to the new shape.

Understanding Lineweights, Linetypes, and Dimensions in Paper Space  |  541  
	
5.	 Close the rectangle file without saving it. You won’t need it in the future.
You’ve just seen how you can dimension an object in model space while in paper space. You 
can dimension model space Xrefs in paper space in much the same way. The only difference is 
that changes to the Xref file don’t automatically update dimensions made in paper space. You 
need to employ the Dimregen command to refresh paper space dimensions of Xref objects.
Updating Associative Dimensions
If you use a wheel mouse to pan and zoom in a Floating model space viewport, you may need to 
use the Dimregen command to refresh an associative dimension. To do so, type Dimregen↵ at 
the command line. You can also use Dimregen to refresh dimensions from drawings that have 
been edited in earlier versions of AutoCAD or, as mentioned already, to refresh dimensions of 
objects contained in external references.
Paper Space Dimensioning without Associative Dimensioning
In some situations, you may not want to use Associative Dimensioning, although you still want 
to dimension model space objects in paper space. For example, you might be in an office that 
has different versions of AutoCAD, or you might be sharing your drawings with other offices 
that aren’t using AutoCAD 2017, and the use of Associative Dimensioning creates confusion.
To dimension model space objects in paper space without Associative Dimensioning, you need 
to have AutoCAD adjust the dimension text to the scale of the viewport from which you’re dimen-
sioning. You can have AutoCAD scale dimension values in paper space so that they correspond to 
a viewport zoom-scale factor. The following steps show you how this setting is made:
	
1.	 Open the Dimension Style Manager by clicking the Dimension Style tool in the Home 
tab’s expanded Annotation panel.

542  | CHAPTER 15  Laying Out Your Printer Output   
	
2.	 Select the dimension style that you want to edit and click Modify.
	
3.	 Click the Primary Units tab.
	
4.	 In the Measurement Scale group, enter the scale factor of the viewport that you intend to 
dimension in the Scale Factor text box. For example, if the viewport is scaled to a 1/2″ = 
1′-0″ scale, enter 24.
	
5.	 Click the Apply To Layout Dimensions Only check box.
	
6.	 Click OK, and then click Close in the Dimension Style Manager. You’re ready to dimen-
sion in paper space without associative dimensions.
Remember that you can snap to objects in a floating viewport so that you can add dimensions 
as you normally would in model space. If you’re dimensioning objects in viewports of different 
scales, you need to set up multiple dimension styles, one for each viewport scale.
Other Uses for Paper Space
The exercises in the preceding sections should give you a sense of how you work in paper space 
and layout views. We’ve given examples that reflect common uses of paper space. Remember 
that paper space is like a page-layout portion of AutoCAD—separate yet connected to model 
space through viewports.
You needn’t limit your applications to floor plans. You can take advantage of paper space with 
interior and exterior elevations, 3D models, and detail sheets. When used in conjunction with 
the raster-import capabilities in AutoCAD, paper space can be a powerful tool for creating large-
format presentations.
Exporting Layout Views to Model Space
You may encounter a situation where you want to export a layout view as a model space drawing. 
You can do so by following these steps:
	1.	 At the bottom of the drawing area, click the Layout tab of the layout you want to export.
	2.	 Right-click the tab, and select Export Layout To Model from the context menu. The Export Layout 
To Model Space Drawing dialog box appears. This is a typical Save dialog box that allows you to 
select the location and name for your exported layout.
	3.	 Select a folder location, enter a name for your exported layout, and then click Save.
Your layout view will be saved as a separate drawing file with the layout appearing in the model 
space of that file. It will also be in the same scale as the original layout view instead of in full scale. 
Other drawing elements such as layers, blocks, linetypes, and styles will also be exported, although 
they may be scaled down to fit the drawing.

The Bottom Line |  543  
The Bottom Line
Understand model space and paper space.    AutoCAD offers two viewing modes for view-
ing and printing your drawings. Model space is where you do most of your work; it’s the 
view that you see when you create a new file. Layouts, also called paper space, are views 
that let you arrange the layout of your drawing, similar to the way that you would in a 
page-layout program.
Master It    What are three ways of moving from model space to paper space?
Work with paper space viewports.    While in paper space, you can create views in your 
drawing using viewports. You can have several viewports, each showing a different part of 
your drawing.
Master It    Name some of the ways that you can enlarge a view in a viewport.
Create odd-shaped viewports.    Most of the time, you’ll probably use rectangular view-
ports, but you have the option to create a viewport of any shape.
Master It    Describe the process for creating a circular viewport.
Understand lineweights, linetypes, and dimensions in paper space.    You can get an accu-
rate view of how your drawing will look on paper by making a few adjustments to AutoCAD. 
Your layout view will reflect how your drawing will look when plotted.
Master It    Name the two dialog boxes that you must use to display lineweights in a lay-
out view.


Chapter  16
Making “Smart” Drawings  
with Parametric Tools 
Don’t let the term parametric drawing scare you. Parametric is a word from mathematics, and in 
the context of AutoCAD® drawings, it means that you can define relationships between different 
objects in a drawing. For example, you can set up a pair of individual lines to stay parallel or set 
up two concentric circles to maintain an exact distance between the circles no matter how they 
may be edited.
Parametric drawing is also called constraint-based modeling, and you’ll see the word constraint 
used in the AutoCAD Ribbon to describe sets of tools. The term constraint is a bit more descrip-
tive of the tools that you’ll use to create parametric drawings because when you use them, you 
are applying a constraint on the objects in your drawing.
This chapter shows you how the parametric drawing tools work and how you can apply 
them to your needs.
In this chapter, you will learn to

Why Use Parametric Drawing Tools?
If you’re not familiar with parametric drawing, you may be wondering what purpose it serves. 
With careful application of the parametric tools, you can create a drawing that you can quickly 
modify with just a change of a dimension or two instead of editing the lines that make up the 
drawing. Figure 16.1 shows a drawing that was set up so that the arcs and circles increase in size 
to an exact proportion when the overall length dimension is increased. This approach can save a 
lot of time if you’re designing several parts that are similar with only a few dimensional changes.
You can also mimic the behavior of a mechanical assembly to test your ideas. The parametric 
drawing tools let you create linkages between objects so that if one moves, the others maintain their 
connection like a link in a chain. For example, you can create 3D AutoCAD models of a crankshaft 
and piston assembly of a car motor (see Figure 16.2) or the parallel arms of a Luxo lamp. If you 
move one part of the model, the other parts move in a way consistent with a real motor or lamp.

546  | CHAPTER 16  Making “Smart” Drawings with Parametric Tools    
Connecting Objects with Geometric Constraints
You’ll start your exploration of parametric drawing by adding geometric constraints to an exist-
ing drawing and testing the behavior of the drawing with the constraints in place. Geometric 
constraints let you assign constrained behaviors to objects to limit their range of motion.

Connecting Objects with Geometric Constraints |  547  
Limiting motion to improve editing efficiency may seem counterintuitive, but once you’ve seen 
these tools in action, you’ll see their benefits.
Using AutoConstrain to Add Constraints Automatically
Start by opening a sample drawing and adding a few geometric constraints. The sample draw-
ing is composed of two parallel lines connected by two arcs, as shown in Figure 16.3. These are 
just lines and arcs and are not polylines.

file containing simple 
lines and arcs
Here are the steps:
	
1.	 Open the Parametric01.dwg file from the sample files for this chapter (see Figure 16.3).
	
2.	 Select the Parametric tab, and click the AutoConstrain tool in the Geometric panel of the 
Parametric Ribbon tab, or type Autoconstrain↵.
	
3.	 Use a selection window to select all the objects in the drawing, and press ↵.
You’ve just used the AutoConstrain command to add geometric constraints to all the objects in 
the drawing. You can see a set of icons that indicate the constraints that have been applied to the 
objects (see Figure 16.4). The AutoConstrain command makes a “best guess” at applying constraints.

ric constraints added
Notice that the constraint icons in the drawing match those you see in the Geometric panel. If you 
hover your mouse pointer over an icon, you’ll see a tool tip that shows the name of the constraint.

548  | CHAPTER 16  Making “Smart” Drawings with Parametric Tools    
The Tangent constraints that you see at the ends of the lines keep the arcs and the lines tan-
gent to each other whenever the arcs are edited. The Parallel constraint keeps the two lines par-
allel, and the Horizontal constraint keeps the lines horizontal.
There is one constraint that doesn’t show an icon, but you see a clue to its existence by the 
small blue squares where the arcs join the lines:
	
1.	 Place your cursor on one of the blue squares. A new icon appears below the tangent icon 
along with a description of the arc. The arc description may hide the new icon, so look 
carefully or move the cursor away and try again. The new icon appears immediately 
whereas the arc description takes a second to appear.
	
2.	 Hover your cursor over the icon that has just appeared. You see the icon appear for the 
Coincident constraint.
The Coincident constraint makes sure that the endpoints of the lines and arcs stay connected, 
as you’ll see in the next few exercises.
Editing a Drawing Containing Constraints
Now try editing the drawing to see how these constraints work:
	
1.	 Click the arc on the left side of the drawing (see the top of Figure 16.5).
	
2.	 Click the grip at the bottom of the arc and move it downward to increase the radius of the 
arc. The objects move in unison to maintain their geometric constraints (see the bottom of 
Figure 16.5).
Click this arc.
Drag downward.
Figure 16.5
Moving the endpoint of 
one arc causes the other 
parts of the drawing to 
follow because of their 
geometric constraints.
	
3.	 Click again to accept the change in the arc radius.
	
4.	 Click the Undo tool in the Quick Access toolbar to undo your change.

Connecting Objects with Geometric Constraints |  549  
In this exercise, you saw how the Tangent, Parallel, Horizontal, and Coincident constraints 
worked to keep the objects together while you changed the size of one object. Next, you’ll see 
what happens if you remove a constraint.
Removing a Constraint
The AutoConstrain tool applied quite a few geometric constraints to the drawing. Suppose that 
you want to remove a constraint to allow for more flexibility in the drawing. In the next exercise, 
you’ll remove the Parallel constraint and then try editing the drawing to see the results:
	
1.	 Click the Parallel constraint icon that is just above the lower line.
	
2.	 Right-click and select Delete. Notice that the Parallel icon disappears from both the top 
and bottom line.
	
3.	 Click the line at the bottom of the drawing.
	
4.	 Click the grip at the left end of the line, drag it downward, and then click. This time, the 
left end of the line moves downward. The lines are no longer parallel, but they remain 
tangent to both arcs and their endpoints remain connected (see Figure 16.6).
Figure 16.6
Editing the arc with 
the Parallel con-
straint removed
Notice that the top line remains horizontal as you edit the arc. The top line still has the 
Horizontal constraint. Next try removing the Horizontal constraint:
	
1.	 Click the Undo tool in the Quick Access toolbar to return to the previous shape.
	
2.	 Right-click the Horizontal constraint icon above the top line and select Delete.

550  | CHAPTER 16  Making “Smart” Drawings with Parametric Tools    
	
3.	 Select the arc on the left side again as you did earlier.
	
4.	 Hover over the bottom grip of the arc, and select Stretch from the multifunction grip menu.
	
5.	 Move the grip downward. This time both the lines change their orientation, as shown in 
Figure 16.7.
Figure 16.7
Without the Horizontal 
constraint, both lines 
change as the arc is 
edited.
Notice that lines and arcs remain connected and tangent to each other. This is because the 
Coincident and Tangent constraints are still in effect.
Adding a Constraint
You’ve seen how the AutoConstrain tool applies a set of constraints to a set of objects. You can 
also add constraints “manually” to fine-tune the way that objects behave. In the next exercise, 
you’ll add a circle to the drawing and then add a few specific constraints that you’ll select from 
the Geometric panel:
	
1.	 Click the Undo tool in the Quick Access toolbar to change the drawing back to its original 
shape.
	
2.	 From the Home tab, click the Circle tool in the Draw panel.
	
3.	 Click a location roughly above and to the left of the drawing, as shown in Figure 16.8. You 
don’t need to be exact because you will use a geometric constraint to move the circle into 
an exact location.
Place the circle here and give it
a 0.25 radius.
Figure 16.8
Place the circle roughly in 
the location shown here.

Connecting Objects with Geometric Constraints |  551  
	
4.	 Type 0.25↵ for the radius of the circle.
	
5.	 Select the Parametric tab, and click the Concentric tool in the Geometric panel.
	
6.	 Click the arc at the left side of the drawing, and then click the circle that you just added. 
The circle moves to a location that is concentric to the arc, as shown in Figure 16.9.
Figure 16.9
The circle is concentric 
to the arc on the left 
side.
In this exercise, you used the geometric constraint as an editing tool to move an object into 
an exact location. The Concentric constraint will also keep the circle inside the arc no matter 
where the arc moves.
The Order Makes a Difference
When you add constraints, sometimes the order in which you add them makes an important dif-
ference. In the Concentric constraint example, you selected the arc first and then the circle. Had 
you selected the circle first, the arcs and lines would have moved to the circle. Instead, as you saw 
in the exercise, the circle moved to the inside of the arc.
Using Other Geometric Constraints
You’ve seen how several of the geometric constraints work. For the most part, each constraint 
is fairly easy to understand. The Tangent constraint keeps objects tangent to each other. The 
Coincident constraint keeps the location of objects together, such as endpoints or midpoints of 
lines and arcs. The Parallel constraint keeps objects parallel.
You have many more geometric constraints at your disposal. Table 16.1 gives you a concise 
listing of the constraints and their purposes. Note that, with the exception of Fix and Symmetric, 
all of the constraints affect pairs of objects.
Table 16.1:	
The geometric constraints
Name
Use
Coincident
Keeps point locations of two objects together, such as the endpoints or 
midpoints of lines. Allowable points vary between objects, and they are 
indicated by a red circle marked with an X while points are being selected.
Collinear
Keeps lines collinear. The lines need not be connected.
Concentric
Keeps circles and arcs concentric.
Fix
Fixes a point on an object to a location in the drawing.

552  | CHAPTER 16  Making “Smart” Drawings with Parametric Tools    
Name
Use
Parallel
Keeps lines parallel.
Perpendicular
Keeps lines or polyline segments perpendicular.
Horizontal
Keeps lines horizontal.
Vertical
Keeps lines vertical.
Tangent
Keeps curves, or a line and curve, tangent to each other.
Smooth
Maintains a smooth transition between splines and other objects. The first 
object selected must be a spline. You can think of this constraint as a tan-
gent constraint for splines.
Symmetric
Maintains symmetry between two curves about an axis that is determined 
by a line. Before using this constraint, draw a line that you will use for the 
axis of symmetry. You can also use the Fix, Horizontal, or Vertical con-
straint to fix the axis to a location or orientation.
Equal
Keeps the length of lines or polylines equal, or the radius of arcs and 
circles equal.
The behavior of the geometric constraints might sound simple, but you may find that they 
can act in unexpected ways. Within the limited space of this book, we can’t give exercise exam-
ples for every geometric constraint, so we encourage you to experiment with them on your own. 
And have some fun with them!
Using Constraints in the Drawing Process
Earlier you saw how the Concentric constraint allowed you to move a circle into a concentric 
location to an arc. You can use other geometric constraints in a similar way. For example, you 
can move a line into a collinear position with another line using the Collinear constraint. Or 
you can move a line into an orientation that’s tangent to a pair of arcs or circles, as shown in 
Figure 16.10. The top image shows the separate line and circles, and the bottom image shows 
the objects after applying the Tangent constraint. Note that although the line is tangent to the 
two circles, its length and orientation does not change.
Controlling Sizes with Dimensional Constraints
At the heart of the AutoCAD parametric tools are the dimensional constraints. These constraints 
allow you to set and adjust the dimension of an assembly of parts, thereby giving you an easy 
way to adjust the size and even the shape of a set of objects.
For example, suppose that you have a set of parts that you are drafting, each of which is just 
slightly different in one dimension or another. You can add geometric constraints and then add 
dimensional constraints, which will let you easily modify your part just by changing the value 
of a dimension. To see how this works, try the following exercises.
Table 16.1:	
The geometric constraints   (continued)

Controlling Sizes with Dimensional Constraints |  553  
Figure 16.10
You can connect two circles 
so that they are tangent to 
a line by using the Tangent 
constraint.
Adding a Dimensional Constraint
In this first dimensional constraint exercise, you’ll add a horizontal dimension to the drawing 
that you’ve been working on already. The drawing already has some geometric constraints with 
which you are familiar, so you can see how the dimensional constraints interact with the geo-
metric constraints.
Start by adding a dimensional constraint between the two arcs:
	
1.	 In the Parametric tab, click the Aligned tool in the Dimensional panel.
	
2.	 Shift+right-click, and select the Center osnap option from the context menu.
	
3.	 Place the cursor on the arc on the left side of the drawing so that the Center osnap marker 
appears for the arc (see Figure 16.11) and click to select the center. Notice that the arc is 
highlighted as you select the center.
Place the cursor
on the arc…
the Center
osnap marker appears.
Figure 16.11
Use the Center osnap 
to select the center of 
the arc.
	
4.	 Shift+right-click, and select the Center osnap option as you did in step 2.
	
5.	 Click the arc on the right side of the drawing (see Figure 16.12).

554  | CHAPTER 16  Making “Smart” Drawings with Parametric Tools    
Click the arc centers for
the constraining points …
and then click here to place
the dimension.

Adding the dimen-
sional constraint
	
6.	 Click a location above the drawing, as shown in Figure 16.12.
	
7.	 At the Dimension text = prompt, press ↵ to accept the current value.
The dimensional constraint appears above the drawing and shows a value of d1=6.0000. 
The d1 is the name for that particular dimensional constraint. Each dimensional constraint is 
assigned a unique name, which is useful later when you want to make changes. You can select 
from a number of dimensional constraints in the Parametric tab’s Dimensional panel. Table 16.2 
gives you a list of the dimensional constraint options.
Table 16.2:

Convert

Now let’s see how you can use the dimensional constraint that you just added.

Controlling Sizes with Dimensional Constraints |  555  
Editing a Dimensional Constraint
A dimensional constraint is linked to objects in your drawing so that when you modify a 
dimension value, the objects to which the constraint is linked change. To see how this works, try 
editing the part by changing the dimension:
	
1.	 Double-click the dimension value of the dimensional constraint (see Figure 16.13).
Figure 16.13
Double-click the 
dimension value.
	
2.	 Type 4.5↵. The part shortens to the dimension that you entered. Press ↵ to clear the 
command. 
Osnaps Are Forced Off
In an earlier exercise, you had to select the Center osnap from the Osnap menu. When placing 
dimensional constraints, you’ll need to use the Osnap menu to select Center osnaps. Running 
osnaps are automatically turned off when you use the dimensional constraint tools. This is because 
the dimensional constraint tools use their own method of finding locations on objects.
Next, add a dimension to the arc on the left side:
	
1.	 Click the Aligned tool from the Dimensional panel.
	
2.	 Select the top endpoint of the arc on the left side (top of Figure 16.14). Do this by first hov-
ering over the arc near the endpoint. When you see the endpoint marker, click the mouse. 
If the constraint icons are in the way, you can zoom in to the drawing to see the marker.
	
3.	 Select the bottom endpoint of the arc in the same way.
	
4.	 Click a point to the left of the arc to place the dimension (bottom of Figure 16.14).
	
5.	 At the Dimension text = prompt, press ↵ to accept the current value.
Notice that the new dimensional constraint has been given the name d2. Now try changing 
the size of the arc using the dimensional constraint:
	
1.	 Double-click the dimension value of the d2 dimensional constraint (see Figure 16.15).
	
2.	 Enter 2↵. The part adjusts to the new dimension.

so that the red
circle appears.

Figure 16.15
Adjusting the arc 
dimension
As you can see from this example, you can control the dimensions of your drawing by chang-
ing the dimensional constraint’s value. This is a much faster way of making accurate changes 
to your drawing. Imagine what you would have to do to make these same changes if you didn’t 
have the geometric and dimensional constraints available.
Using Formulas to Control and Link Dimensions
In the previous exercise, you saw how the dimensional constraint attached to the arc affected 
the drawing. But in that example, the circle on the left end of the drawing remained unaffected 
by the change in the arc size. Now suppose that you want that circle to adjust its size in relation 
to the size of the arc. To do this, you can employ the Parameters Manager and include a formula 
that manages the size of the circle.

Using Formulas to Control and Link Dimensions |  557  
In the following exercise, you’ll add a dimensional constraint to the circle and then apply a 
formula to that constraint so that the circle will always be one half the diameter of the arc, no 
matter how the arc is modified.
Start by adding a Diameter constraint to the circle:
	
1.	 Click the Undo tool in the Quick Access toolbar to change the drawing back to its previ-
ous shape.
	
2.	 Click the Diameter tool in the Dimensional panel.
	
3.	 Click the circle to select it.
	
4.	 Click a location inside the drawing to place the constraint, as shown in Figure 16.16.
	
5.	 Press ↵ to accept the constraint value.
Figure 16.16
Adding a Diameter 
constraint to the circle
The Diameter constraint that you just added is given the name dia1. It controls only the diam-
eter of the circle; you could change the value of that constraint, but it would affect only the circle.
Adding a Formula Parameter
Now let’s add a formula that will “connect” the value of the circle diameter to the diameter of the arc:
	
1.	 Click the Parameters Manager tool in the Manage panel. The Parameters Manager 
appears (see Figure 16.17). Notice that the Parameters Manager gives a list of all the 
dimensional constraints that exist in the drawing.
Figure 16.17
The Parameters Manager

558  | CHAPTER 16  Making “Smart” Drawings with Parametric Tools    
	
2.	 Click the Creates A New User Parameter tool at the top of the Parameters Manager. A new 
category appears in the list called User Parameters, and you see a user1 parameter appear.
	
3.	 Double-click in the Expression column for the user1 parameter (see Figure 16.18).
	
4.	 With the user1 expression value highlighted, type d2 * 0.5↵. You will see your entry 
replace the expression value (see Figure 16.18). This expression is saying, “Give the user1 
variable the value of half the d2 constraint.” Remember that the d2 constraint is the one 
given to the arc.
Figure 16.18
Adding an expression to 
the user1 parameter
Change this 
expression to 
d2 * 0.5.
Change the 
expression for 
the dia1 parameter 
to user1.
Figure 16.19
Applying the user1 
parameter to the  
dia1 parameter
	
5.	 Now double-click the Expression column for the dia1 parameter (see Figure 16.19). This is 
the parameter for the circle’s diameter.

Using Formulas to Control and Link Dimensions |  559  
The part changes in width, and the circle also enlarges to maintain its proportion to the 
width of the part. Here you see that you can apply a formula to a constraint so that it is “linked” 
to another constraint’s value. In this case, you set the circle’s diameter to follow the width con-
straint of the part.
In addition, you can adjust the constraint value from the Parameters Manager. You could also 
have changed the width of the part as before by double-clicking the dimensional constraint for 
the arc.
Using Other Formulas
In the previous exercise, you used a simple formula that multiplied a parameter, d2, by a fixed 
value. You used the asterisk to indicate multiplication. You could have used the minus sign in 
the formula if, for example, you wanted the circle to be an exact distance from the arc. Instead 
of d2 * 0.5, you could use d2 – 0.125, which would keep the circle 0.125 from the overall width of 
the part.
You can also choose from a fairly large list of formulas. If you double-click an expression 
in the Parameters Manager and then right-click, you can select Expressions from the context 
menu that appears. You can then select from a list of expressions for your parameter (see 
Figure 16.21).
	
6.	 Type user1↵ to change the dia1 expression from 0.5 to user1. This tells AutoCAD to use 
the expression in the user1 parameter in place of the fixed 0.5 diameter value.
You’ve set up your circle to follow any changes to the width of the part. Now any changes to 
the d2 dimensional constraint will affect the circle.
Testing the Formula
Try the following to see the parameters in action:
	
1.	 In the Parameters Manager, double-click the Expression column for the d2 parameter.
	
2.	 Change the value from 1 to 2 and observe the effect on the part (see Figure 16.20).
Figure 16.20
Change the d2 parameter 
and the part changes in 
size, including the circle.

560  | CHAPTER 16  Making “Smart” Drawings with Parametric Tools    
As you can see from the list, you have quite a few expressions from which to choose. We 
won’t try to describe each expression, but you should recognize most of them from your high 
school math class.
Figure 16.21
The expressions offered from the 
Parameters Manager

Editing the Constraint Options |  561  
Editing the Constraint Options
AutoCAD offers a number of controls that you can apply to the constraints feature. Like most 
other controls, these are accessible through a settings dialog box that is opened from the Ribbon 
panel title bar. If you click the Constraint Settings tool on the Geometric panel title bar, the 
Constraint Settings dialog box opens (see Figure 16.22).
You can see that the Constraint Settings dialog box offers three tabs across the top: 
Geometric, Dimensional, and AutoConstrain. The settings in the Geometric tab let you control 
the display of the constraint bars, which are the constraint icons that you see in the drawing 
when you add constraints. You can also control the transparency of the constraint bars using the 
slider near the bottom of the dialog box.
Like the Geometric tab, the Dimensional tab (see Figure 16.23) gives you control over the dis-
play of dimensional constraints. You can control the format of the text shown in the dimension 
and whether dynamic constraints are displayed.
Finally, the AutoConstrain tab (see Figure 16.24) gives you control over the behavior of the 
AutoConstrain command. You can control the priority of the constraints applied to a set of 
objects as well as which geometric constraints are allowed.
At this point, you can close the Parametaric01.dwg file without saving it so that you can 
come back to it later for practice.
Organizing Parameters
If you find that you have a lot of parameters in the Parameters Manager, you can organize them 
using groups and filters. In the Parameters Manager, click the double arrowhead in the bar to the 
left of the parameter list.
The bar expands to display the Filters list. Click the funnel-shaped tool in the upper-left corner of 
the Parameters Manager to create a new group filter. Click and drag parameters from the parameters 
list to the group filter name to add parameters to your group filter.

Putting Constraints to Use
So far, you’ve seen some simple applications of the parametric tools available in AutoCAD. 
Although the parametric tools may seem simple, you can build some fairly elaborate parametric 
models using the geometric and dimensional constraints you’ve learned about here.
Besides having a drawing of a part that adjusts itself to changes in dimensional constraints, 
you can create assemblies that will allow you to study linkages and motion. For example, you 
can create a model of a piston and crankshaft from a gas engine and have the piston and crank-
shaft move together.
In the next exercise, you’ll look at a drawing that has been established to show just how con-
straints can be set up to mimic the way a mechanical part behaves:
	
1.	 Open the piston.dwg file from the sample drawings.
	
2.	 Click the arc in the right side of the drawing (see Figure 16.25).

Settings dialog box

Click the center grip, right-click, 
and select Rotate.

how the drawing changes.

564  | CHAPTER 16  Making “Smart” Drawings with Parametric Tools    
	
3.	 Click the center grip of the arc, and then right-click and select Rotate.
	
4.	 Move the cursor to rotate the arc. Notice that the “piston” that is connected to the arc with 
a fixed-length line follows the motion of the arc just as a piston would follow the motion 
of a crankshaft in a gas engine.
As you can see from this example, you can model a mechanical behavior using constraints. 
The piston in this drawing is a simple rectangle that has been constrained in both its height and 
width. A Horizontal constraint has also been applied so that it can move only in a horizontal 
direction. The line connecting the piston to the arc is constrained in its length. The Coincident 
constraint connects it to the piston at one end and the arc at the other end. The arc itself, rep-
resenting the crankshaft, uses a Diameter constraint, and a Fix constraint is used at its center 
to keep its center fixed in one location. The net result is that when you rotate the arc, each part 
moves in unison.
The Bottom Line
Use parametric drawing tools.    Parametric drawing tools enable you to create an assembly 
of objects that are linked to each other based on geometric or dimensional properties. With

Chapter  17
Using Dynamic Blocks 
Blocks are a great way to create and store ready-made symbols. They can be a real time-saver, 
especially when you have assemblies that you use often. Earlier in this book you learned how to 
create a basic, no-frills block. When you understand the basics of block creation, you can begin 
to work with dynamic blocks.
Dynamic blocks have properties that you can modify using grips. For example, you can cre-
ate a dynamic block of a door and then easily grip-edit its size and orientation. Or you can use a 
single block to represent several versions of a similar object. You can have a single block of a bed 
that can be modified to show a double, queen-sized, or king-sized shape.
In this chapter, you’ll explore the use of dynamic blocks through a series of exercises. Each exercise 
will show you a different way to use dynamic blocks. This will help you become familiar with the 
methods involved in creating dynamic blocks. You’ll start by looking at the Block Editor, which in itself 
makes editing blocks much easier. Then you’ll be introduced to the tools used to create dynamic blocks.
In this chapter, you will learn to

Exploring the Block Editor
Before you start to add dynamic block features to blocks, you’ll want to get familiar with the Block 
Editor. The Block Editor offers an easy way to make changes to existing blocks, and as you’ll see a 
bit later, it’s also the tool that you’ll use to give your blocks some additional capabilities.
Opening the Block Editor
As an introduction to the Block Editor, you’ll make changes to the now familiar unit plan from 
earlier tutorials. Start by editing the Kitchen block in the unit:
	
1.	 Open the Unit.dwg file that you saved from earlier exercises, and freeze the Notes layer. 
If you have been working in metric or did not create the file earlier, you can also use the 
17-unit.dwg file.

2.	 Double-click the kitchenette in the plan to open the Edit Block Definition dialog box (see 
Figure 17.1). Notice that all the blocks in the drawing are listed in the dialog box and 
that the Kitchen block is highlighted. You also see a preview of the block in the preview 
group.

The gray background tells you that you’re in the Block Editor. You’ll also see the Block Editor 
tab along the top of the drawing area and the Block Authoring palettes, as shown in Figure 17.2.
Take a moment to look over the panels and tools on the Block Editor tab. This tab offers sev-
eral housekeeping tools that let you open and save blocks and exit the Block Editor. You can 
point to each tool in the tab’s panels to see its description. Figure 17.3 shows the Block Editor tab 
and tools.
Figure 17.3
The Block Editor 
tab
Both the Block Editor tab and the Block Authoring palettes offer tools for adding dynamic 
block features that you’ll explore later in this chapter. You may notice that the Block Editor tab 
contains the geometric and dimensional constraint panels that you learned about in Chapter 16, 
“Making ‘Smart’ Drawings with Parametric Tools.” Let’s continue our look at the basic features 
of the Block Editor.
Editing a Block and Creating New Blocks
The Block Editor lets you edit a block using all of the standard Autodesk® AutoCAD® editing tools. 
In the following exercise, you’ll modify the kitchen sink and save your changes to the drawing:
	
1.	 Delete the rectangle that represents the sink in the Kitchen block.
	
2.	 Click Close Block Editor on the Block Editor tab’s Close panel (see the right side of 
Figure 17.3).
	
3.	 A message appears asking if you want to save your changes to the Kitchen block. Click 
Save The Changes To KITCHEN. Your view returns to the standard AutoCAD drawing 
area, and you can see the changes that you made to the kitchen, as shown in Figure 17.4.

568  | CHAPTER 17  Using Dynamic Blocks   
As you can see, editing blocks with the Block Editor is straightforward. In this example, you 
deleted part of the block, but you can perform any type of drawing or editing to modify the 
block. The Block Editor tab also offers other block-saving options in its panels. You can save the 
block as you work by clicking the Save Block Definition button. If you need to create a varia-
tion on the block that you’re currently editing, you can click the Save Block As tool on the Block 
Editor’s expanded Open/Save panel to create a new block or overwrite an existing one with the 
drawing that is currently in the Block Editor.
If you want to edit a different block after editing the current one, you can click the Save Block tool 
on the Block Editor’s Open/Save panel to save your current block and then click the Edit Block tool.
This tool opens the Edit Block Definition dialog box that you saw earlier. You can then select 
another block to edit or create a new block by entering a name for your block in the Block To 
Create Or Edit box.
Creating a Dynamic Block
Now that you’ve seen how the Block Editor works, you can begin to explore the creation of 
dynamic blocks. As an introduction, you’ll create a rectangle that you’ll use to replace the sink 
in the kitchen. You’ll add a dynamic block feature that will allow you to adjust the width of the 
sink using grips. In addition, you’ll add a control that limits the size to one-unit increments.
Start by creating a block from scratch using the Block Editor:
	
1.	 Click the Block Editor tool in the Home tab’s Block panel.
	
2.	 In the Edit Block Definition dialog box, enter Sink in the Block To Create Or Edit box and 
then click OK.
	
3.	 Make sure that you are on the Fixture layer, and then use the Rectangle tool on the Home 
tab’s Draw panel to draw a rectangle that is 12 units in the x-axis and 15 units in the y-axis.
	
4.	 Zoom into the rectangle so that your view looks similar to Figure 17.5.
You could save this block now, and you’d have a simple, static block. Next, you’ll add a couple 
of features called parameters and actions. As their names imply, parameters define the param-
eters, or limits, of what the dynamic block will do, and actions describe the particular action 
taken when the grips of the dynamic block are edited. For example, in the next section, you’ll 
add a Linear parameter that tells AutoCAD that you want to restrain the grip editing to a lin-
ear direction. You’ll also add a Stretch action that tells AutoCAD that you want the grip edit to 
behave like a Stretch command that pulls a set of vertices in one direction or another.

Adding a Parameter
The first parameter that you’ll add establishes the base point for the block. This will let you 
determine the point used when inserting the block in your drawing:
	
1.	 In the Block Authoring palettes, select the Parameters tab.
	
2.	 Click the Basepoint tool, Shift+right-click, select the Endpoint osnap, and then click the 
lower-left corner of the rectangle. This is how you determine the base point, or insertion 
point, of a block while using the Block Editor.
Next, you’ll add a parameter that will determine the type of editing that you want to add to 
the block. In this case, you want to be able to grip-edit the width of the block. For that you’ll use 
the Linear Parameter tool:
	
1.	 Click the Linear tool on the Parameters tab of the Block Authoring palettes, or expand the 
Parameter tool (Point) on the Block Editor tab’s Action Parameters panel and click Linear.
	
2.	 At the prompt
Specify start point or [Name/Label
/Chain/Description/Base/Palette/Value set]:
       Shift+right-click and select the Midpoint osnap; then select the left side of the rectangle.
	
3.	 Shift+right-click again, select Midpoint from the Osnap menu, and select the right side of 
the rectangle.
	
4.	 At the Specify label location: prompt, the parameter name appears with the 
parameter label at the cursor. Click below the rectangle to place the label, as shown in 
Figure 17.6.
Figure 17.5

the Sink block

570  | CHAPTER 17  Using Dynamic Blocks   
The parameter that you just added lets you modify the block in a linear fashion. In this case, 
it will allow you to change the width of the rectangle. As you’ll see, the locations of the param-
eter’s arrows later become the grip locations for the dynamic block.
But just adding the parameter doesn’t make the block dynamic. You need to include an action 
before a parameter can be used. You may have noticed the warning symbol in the parameter 
that you just added. It tells you that you need to take some further steps to make the parameter 
useful.
Adding an Action
Next, you’ll add a Stretch action that will enable you to use the Linear parameter that you just 
added. The Stretch action will let you stretch the block horizontally by using grips. As you add 
the action, notice that it’s similar to the Stretch command. The only difference is that you don’t 
stretch the object; you only specify the vertices to stretch and the object you want to stretch.
Follow these steps:
	
1.	 Turn off osnaps and then click the Actions tab in the Block Authoring palettes and select 
Stretch.
	
2.	 At the Select parameter: prompt, click the Distance1 parameter you just created.
Figure 17.6
Placing the Linear 
parameter

Creating a Dynamic Block |  571  
	
3.	 At the Specify parameter point to associate with action or enter [sTart 
point/Second point] <Second>: prompt, point to the left-pointing arrow. You see a 
circle with an X through it showing the location of a parameter point.
	
4.	 Click the circle with the X.
	
5.	 At the Specify first corner of stretch frame or [CPolygon]: prompt, place a 
selection window around the entire left side of the rectangle. This selects the portion of 
the rectangle that is to be stretched when you grip-edit the block.
	
6.	 At the Specify objects to stretch Select Object: prompt, select the rectangle and 
the base point you added earlier and then press ↵ to complete your selection.
You’ve just added an action to the Linear parameter that you added earlier. You’ll see an 
action icon appear below and to the right of the Distance1 linear parameter. The icon looks like 
the Stretch tool in the Actions tab to help you identify the action. If you hover over the icon, the 
parts affected by the action are highlighted.
Notice that the warning symbol is still showing. You need to add another action to the right side 
of the parameter because the parameter expects that you’ll want to be able to grip-edit both sides:
	
1.	 Repeat the previous set of steps, but instead of clicking the left circle with the X of the 
Linear parameter as you did in step 4 of the preceding exercise, click the right arrow.
	
2.	 Place a window selection around the right side of the rectangle (as you did around the 
left side in step 5 in the preceding exercise).
	
3.	 At the Specify objects to stretch: prompt, select the rectangle again.
A second action icon appears next to the first one to the lower right of the Distance1 linear 
parameter. This time the warning symbol disappears, telling you that you’ve completed the 
steps that you need for the parameter. You’re ready to save the block and try it out:
	
1.	 Click Close Block Editor on the Block Editor tab’s Close panel.
	
2.	 At the message asking if you want to save changes to the Sink block, click Save The 
Changes To Sink.

572  | CHAPTER 17  Using Dynamic Blocks   
Next, insert the sink to see how it works:
	
1.	 Click the Insert tool in the Home tab’s Block panel.
	
2.	 Select Sink from the Insert flyout, scrolling down if you can’t see it at first. The sink 
appears at the cursor.
	
3.	 Place the block at the location shown in Figure 17.7.
Place the block in this location.
Figure 17.7
The Sink block in 
place
	
4.	 Click the newly inserted sink. You see two arrows at the vertical midpoints of the block.
	
5.	 Turn on Ortho mode, and click and drag the arrow on the right side of the block. The 
width of the block follows the arrow as you drag it. You also see the dimension of the sink 
as you drag the arrow.
	
6.	 Enter 15↵. The width of the block changes to 15 inches from the original 12.
Although you entered a value in step 6 to change the width of the sink, you could have 
clicked the mouse to change the width visually. The rectangle is still a block. You didn’t have to 
explode it to change its width. If you hover the cursor over the dynamic block grip, you see the 
block’s width dimension.
Adding an Increment Value
You can grip-edit your dynamic Sink block to modify its width, and as you saw in the previ-
ous exercise, you can enter a specific value for the width as well. But suppose that you’d like to 
limit grip movement so that the sink changes in only 1″ steps. You can set parameters to have an 
increment value so that grip edits are limited to a specific distance.

Creating a Dynamic Block |  573  
The following steps show how you can set up the Linear parameter of the Sink block so that 
the sink width can be grip-edited to 1″ increments:
	
1.	 Double-click the Sink block. Then, in the Edit Block Definition dialog box, make sure that 
Sink is selected and click OK. You may need to zoom into the sink.
	
2.	 Click the Linear parameter’s Distance1 label, right-click, and choose Properties.
	
3.	 In the Properties palette, scroll down to the Value Set group and click the Dist Type 
listing. The Dist Type option changes to a drop-down list.
	
4.	 Expand the list and select Increment.
	
5.	 Click in the Dist Increment text box just below the Dist Type options, and enter 1 for an 
increment distance of 1 inch.
	
6.	 Close the Properties palette, and then click Close Block Editor on the Block Editor tab’s 
Close panel.
	
7.	 Save the changes.
	
8.	 Click the Sink block to expose its grips.
	
9.	 Click and drag the right arrow grip to the right. As soon as you click the grip, you’ll see 
a set of increment marks appear indicating the increment steps for the grip. As you move 
the grip, the sink width jumps to the increment marks, which are 1″ apart, as shown in 
Figure 17.8.
	
10.	 Set the width of the sink back to 12″.

574  | CHAPTER 17  Using Dynamic Blocks   
In addition to an increment distance, you can set a range of movement for the Linear param-
eter. You may have noticed the minimum and maximum text boxes in the Properties palette 
in steps 3 through 5. You can enter values for these settings that define the range of movement 
allowed for the grip edits.
.

with the Linear parameter’s 
increment value set to 1
Understanding the Cycling Option
You can turn on the Cycling option in the Misc group of the Properties palette of any parameter 
grip. Cycling allows you to use the parameter grip as an insertion point. With this option turned 
on, you can press the Ctrl key to cycle between the standard insertion point and the cycle-enabled 
grip of a parameter while inserting the block.
The sink exercise is a simple demonstration of how you can create and use dynamic blocks. 
But as you can see from the Block Authoring palettes, you can add many other parameters and 
actions to a block.
Editing Parameters and Actions
In the previous exercises, you inserted parameters and actions using the default settings. These 
settings give you default names and labels for the parameters and actions, but you can always 
change them later. To change the label that appears for a parameter, double-click the label. The 
label will then appear in a rectangular box showing you that you can change its text.
If you want to include additional objects for an action, click the action icon to select it and 
then right-click and select Action Selection Set ➢ Modify Selection Set. You can also choose 
Action Selection Set ➢ New Selection Set if you want to change the object of the action.
Keeping an Object Centered
Now suppose that you want to add a drain to the sink, but to make things a little more compli-
cated, you want to make sure that the drain remains centered if the sink is widened or made 
narrower. You can alter the way the Linear parameter behaves so that both sides of the sink 
move symmetrically. Here’s how it works:
	
1.	 Double-click the Sink block to open the Edit Block Definition dialog box. Make sure that 
Sink is selected and click OK. Make sure that you are on the Fixture layer.

Creating a Dynamic Block |  575  
	
2.	 Add a 3″ diameter circle in the center of the rectangle. This circle will represent the drain 
(see Figure 17.9). You can use the Geometric Center Osnap to locate the center of the rect-
angle representing the Sink.
Figure 17.9
Adding the 
sink drain
	
3.	 Select the Distance1 linear parameter, and then right-click and select Properties.
	
4.	 In the Properties palette, scroll down to the bottom and look for the Base Location setting 
under the Misc section.
	
5.	 Click the Base Location option, and then select Midpoint from the drop-down list that 
appears to the right.
	
6.	 Close the Properties palette.
	
7.	 Click Close Block Editor in the Close panel, and save the Sink block changes.
Now try grip-editing the block to see how the Stretch action affects the sink drain:
	
1.	 Click the sink to select it.
	
2.	 Click and drag the right arrow grip to the right. The drain stays centered in the sink 
while the two sides expand outward.
In this exercise, you changed the Base Location option for the Linear parameter, which 
causes the block to behave differently when you edit its grips. You can also employ a com-
pletely different method to achieve similar results. The Geometric and Dimensional panels 
of the Block Editor tab offer a set of tools that work in a way that’s similar to how the param-
eters and actions with which you’ve worked already function. You will learn how these tools 
work next.

576  | CHAPTER 17  Using Dynamic Blocks   
Using Constraints in Dynamic Blocks
In the sink example, you added two Stretch actions to a Linear parameter. This enabled the 
block to be stretched in both the left and right directions. The actions and parameters offer one 
way of creating dynamic blocks, but you can also use the geometric and dimensional constraints 
to which you were introduced in the previous chapter.
In this section, you’ll turn a simple door block into a dynamic block that will allow you to 
resize the door to any opening. In the process, you’ll learn how to apply geometric and dimen-
sional constraints to create a dynamic block.
At first, you may think that all you need to do to resize a door is to change the scale. But 
when you scale the door, all of its features, including the door width, are scaled proportionally. 
To be very accurate, you only want to stretch the door width and scale the door swing, leaving 
the door thickness at the same dimension. This can be accomplished by adding two aligned 
dimensional constraints and a few geometric constraints to the door.
Start by opening the Door block in the Block Editor and adding the geometric constraints to 
the door:
	
1.	 Press Esc to clear any current selections, and then click the Block Editor tool in the Home 
tab’s Block panel.
	
2.	 In the Edit Block Definition dialog box, select DOOR and then click OK.
	
3.	 Click the AutoConstrain tool in the Block Editor tab’s Geometric panel, and then 
select the rectangle representing the door, as shown in Figure 17.10. To select the door 
using a window, click above and to the left of the door, and then click below and to 
the right.
Click here…
…then here.
Figure 17.10
Select the rectangle 
representing the 
door.
	
4.	 Press ↵ when the door has been selected. You’ll see the geometric constraint icons appear 
around the door.

Using Constraints in Dynamic Blocks |  577  
The geometric constraints will make sure that the door maintains its rectangular shape when 
you apply changes to the door through the dynamic block feature. The constraints used are 
parallel, perpendicular, coincident, and horizontal. Note that the coincident constraint will not 
show an icon unless you hover over one of the corners of the rectangle.
You’ll need to add a constraint to keep the arc connected to the rectangle:
	
1.	 Click the Coincident tool in the Geometric panel.
	
2.	 Place the cursor near the right end of the bottom horizontal line of the rectangle.
	
3.	 When you see the red circle and X marker, click.
	
4.	 Place the cursor near the lower end of the arc where it meets the rectangle. When you 
select this end, make sure that the arc is highlighted, indicating that the arc will be 
selected. You may need to zoom in to the location to ensure that you are selecting the cor-
rect point.
	
5.	 When you see the red circle and X marker, click the mouse.
The coincident constraint that you just added will keep the arc and rectangle connected at 
the bottom-right corner of the rectangle.
Next, add a dimensional constraint. Most likely, you’ll need to scale the door based only on 
the door opening, so place a dimensional constraint between the door hinge and the end of the 
door swing arc:
	
1.	 Click the Aligned tool in the Block Editor tab’s Dimensional panel.
	
2.	 At the Specify first constraint point or [Object/Point & line/2Lines] 
<Object>: prompt, point to the line at the bottom of the drawing near the left endpoint, 
as shown in Figure 17.11.
First, hover on the left end 
of the line until you see the 
circle and the X marker; then click.
Next, hover over the left end 
of the arc until you see the circle 
and X marker; then click.
Figure 17.11
Select the locations 
for the door opening 
dimensional constraint.

578  | CHAPTER 17  Using Dynamic Blocks   
	
3.	 When you see the red circle with the X appear at the left endpoint of the line, click.
	
4.	 At the Specify second constraint point: prompt, place the cursor on the top end of 
the arc so that you see the circle and X marker again at the left end of the arc, as indicated 
in Figure 17.11, and click.
	
5.	 At the Specify dimension line location: prompt, place the dimension to the left of 
the arc (see Figure 17.12).
	
6.	 With the dimension highlighted, press ↵. Your drawing will look similar to Figure 17.12.
Figure 17.12
The aligned dimensional 
constraint applied to the 
door opening
Notice that the constraint you just added is named d1. This will be an important feature in 
the next two constraints that you add.
Next, add another dimensional constraint to the width of the door rectangle. This 
time, you want the constraint to follow the door opening constraint, so instead of accept-
ing the default value for the dimension, you’ll enter the name of the first dimensional 
constraint:
	
1.	 Click the Aligned tool again from the Dimensional panel.
	
2.	 Select the left end of the bottom horizontal line again, as you did in the previous exercise 
(see Figure 17.13).
	
3.	 Select the right end of the bottom horizontal line, as shown in Figure 17.13.
	
4.	 Place the dimension line below the door roughly the same distance away from the door 
as the first dimensional constraint.
	
5.	 With the newly placed dimension highlighted, enter d1↵. This will cause the door rect-
angle to follow the dimension of the d1 door opening dimensional constraint.

Using Constraints in Dynamic Blocks |  579  
Finally, add the dimensional constraint for the arc:
	
1.	 Click the Radius tool in the Block Editor tab’s Dimensional panel.
	
2.	 Click anywhere on the arc.
	
3.	 Position the radius dimensional constraint anywhere toward the outside of the arc.
	
4.	 With the radius dimension highlighted, enter d1↵. This will cause the arc to follow the 
dimension of the door opening dimensional constraint.
	
5.	 You now have all of the constraints in place and are ready to try out your dynamic block 
(see Figure 17.14). Click Close Block Editor in the Close panel to save the block and return 
to the drawing.

580  | CHAPTER 17  Using Dynamic Blocks   
Now try out your new dynamic block by adjusting the door size:
	
1.	 Pan your view so that you can see the entry door clearly, as shown in Figure 17.15.
Figure 17.15
The Door block with 
its grips exposed
	
2.	 Click the door to select it. The added aligned constraint arrow appears as a grip on the 
right end of the Door block.
	
3.	 Click the arrow grip. The length dimension becomes available for your input, and as you 
move the mouse, the door changes in size. Note that the thickness of the door doesn’t 
change as you alter its width.
	
4.	 Enter 24↵ to change the door width to 24″.
Notice that, although you were able to enter a door dimension directly to the block, you 
didn’t change the door thickness when the door size changed. Only the door swing and width 
changed to accommodate the new door size. This is most apparent if you scale the door to a 
small size such as 6″ or 12″.
Adding a List of Predefined Options
Earlier, you saw how you can add an increment value set to make a dynamic block stay in a set 
range of sizes. You can also set up a dynamic block to offer a range of sizes in a pop-up list. To 
do so, you need to employ the Block Table feature.
In the following exercise, you’ll add a selectable list to the Door block to allow the door size 
to be selected from a list. Start by adding the block table that will allow you to define a set of 
predefined door dimensions:
	
1.	 Double-click the door to open the Edit Block Definition dialog box and then click OK.
	
2.	 In the Block Editor tab’s Dimensional panel, click the Block Table tool.
	
3.	 At the Specify parameter location or [Palette]: prompt, place the block table in 
the location shown in Figure 17.16.

Adding a List of Predefined Options |  581  
	
4.	 At the Enter number of grips [0/1] <1>: prompt, press ↵. The Block Properties Table 
dialog box appears (see Figure 17.17).
Figure 17.16

6.	 Click the d1 listing at the top of the Add Parameter Properties dialog box and click OK. 
The Block Properties Table returns with a d1 heading in the list box.
	
7.	 Click just below the d1 listing; then type 12↵. You see 1′-0″ added to the list.

582  | CHAPTER 17  Using Dynamic Blocks   
	
8.	 Type 18↵; 1′-6″ is added to the list.
	
9.	 Type 24↵30↵36↵. The values that you enter are added to the list in feet and inches format 
(see Figure 17.19).

11.	 Click Close Block Editor in the Close panel, and save the changes to return to your 
drawing.
Now you can select from the door sizes in a pop-up list:
	
1.	 Click the door to select it.
	
2.	 Click the down-pointing grip below the door, as shown at the left side of Figure 17.20.
Click this grip.
Figure 17.20
Selecting a door 
size from a list
	
3.	 Select the 3′-0″ door from the list that appears. (See the view to the right in Figure 17.20.) 
The door changes to a 36″-wide door.
If at a later time you need to make changes to the list or add more dimensions, you can open 
the block in the Block Editor and then click the Block Table tool. The Block Properties Table dia-
log box will appear with the data you entered earlier. You can then make changes to the table.
In this example, you saw that you can easily add predefined sizes to the dimensional con-
straint that appear in a selectable list. You can also give the list a more meaningful name. Right 
now, when you click the grip that opens the list, you see d1 as the name. Try the following to 
change the name from d1 to Width:
	
1.	 Double-click the door, and in the Edit Block Definition dialog box, click OK.
	
2.	 Select the d1 dimensional constraint, and then right-click and select Properties.
	
3.	 In the Properties palette, select the Name option under the Constraint group and then 
type Width↵. Notice that all the dimensional constraints that reference the dimension 
will change to show the name Width instead of d1.
	
4.	 Close the Properties palette, click the Close Block Editor tool in the Close panel, and then 
click to save the changes in the dialog box.
	
5.	 To see the change, click the down-pointing grip below the door as you did in the previous exer-
cise. Now you see the word Width as the heading in the list of door widths (see Figure 17.21).

584  | CHAPTER 17  Using Dynamic Blocks   
	
6.	 Save and close the file.
As you can see, you have a lot of control over the behavior of various components of the 
dynamic block. In the next section, you’ll learn how you can control the visibility of different 
parts of your block.
Creating Multiple Shapes in One Block
Depending on circumstances, you may need a block to display a completely different form. For 
example, you might want a single generic bath that can morph into a standard bath, a corner 
bath, or a large spa-style bath with jets.
Using dynamic blocks, you can hide or display elements of a block by selecting a visibility 
state from a list. For example, you can draw the three different bath sizes and then set up a vis-
ibility state for each size. Each visibility state displays only one bath size. You can then select a 
visibility state depending on the bath size that you want.
Try the following exercise to see how this works firsthand:
	
1.	 Open the visibilitysample.dwg file, and then click the Block Editor tool on the Home 
tab’s Block panel.
	
2.	 In the Edit Block Definition dialog box, select Bathtub from the list and click OK.
You see the contents of the Bathtub block (see Figure 17.22). It’s just the three existing 
blocks—Standard, Jetted, and Corner—inserted at the same origin.
If you were to insert this block in a drawing, it would appear just as you currently see it, with 
each bathtub type overlaid on another. Next you’ll see how you can add control over the visibil-
ity of each bathtub type so that only one is displayed at a time.

The first thing you need to do is to add a Visibility parameter:
	
1.	 On the Parameters tab of the Block Authoring palettes, click Visibility.
	
2.	 Click below the blocks to place the Visibility parameter, as shown in Figure 17.23.
	
3.	 Double-click the Visibility parameter that you just added to open the Visibility States dia-
log box (see Figure 17.24). One visibility state, VisibilityState0, is already provided.

586  | CHAPTER 17  Using Dynamic Blocks   
You’ll need three visibility states: one for each type of bathtub whose visibility you want to 
control. You’ve already got one, but you want a name that is more appropriate to the application:
	
1.	 Click the Rename button. The existing visibility state in the list to the left becomes

Creating Multiple Shapes in One Block |  587  
You’ve just created all of the visibility states that you need.
	
9.	 Select Standard from the list in the Visibility States dialog box, and click the Set Current 
button. (You can also double-click the Standard item.) A check mark appears to the left of 
Standard, showing you that it’s now the current state.
	
10.	 Click OK to exit the Visibility States dialog box.
You have the visibility states that you need, and you have the objects whose visibility you 
want to control. Now you need to determine which block is visible for each state.
Remember that in step 9 of the previous exercise, you made Standard the current visibility 
state. You’ll want only the standard Bathtub block visible for this state. Do the following to turn 
off the other two Bathtub blocks for the current state:
	
1.	 Select the Jetted and Corner blocks (see Figure 17.26).

2.	 Right-click, and choose Object Visibility ➢ Hide For Current State. You can also click the 
Make Invisible tool on the right side of the Block Editor tab’s Visibility panel.
The selected blocks disappear. They didn’t go anywhere; they are just made invisible.
	
3.	 Click the drop-down list on the Block Editor tab’s Visibility panel, and select Jetted. The 
hidden blocks appear.

588  | CHAPTER 17  Using Dynamic Blocks   
The current visibility state is now Jetted, so you want only the Jetted block to be visible. 
Select the Standard and Corner blocks, and then right-click and choose Object Visibility 
➢ Hide For Current State. You can also click the Make Invisible tool from the Visibility 
panel. Now only the Jetted block is visible.
	
4.	 On the Block Editor tab’s Visibility panel, click the drop-down list again and select 
Corner. All of the blocks appear.
	
5.	 Select the Standard and Jetted blocks, and click the Make Invisible tool. Now only the 
Corner block is visible.
You’ve created visibility states and set up the blocks so that they appear only when the 
appropriate visibility state is current. Next you’ll test the blocks:
	
1.	 Click Close Block Editor, and save the changes that you’ve made.
	
2.	 Click the Insert tool on the Home tab’s Block panel, click More Options, and then select 
Bathtub from the Name drop-down list in the Insert dialog box.
	
3.	 Make sure that Specify On-Screen is checked for the Insertion Point group and 
unchecked for the Scale and Rotation groups.
	
4.	 Click OK, and then place the block to the right of the other three blocks.
	
5.	 Click the Bathtub block that you just inserted, and then click the Visibility grip (see the 
left image in Figure 17.27).

Rotating Objects in Unison |  589  
In this example, you used a set of bathtubs, but you can use the Visibility parameter for 
anything that requires a different appearance. As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, 
another use might be a block that contains a double, a queen-sized, and a king-sized bed. Going 
back to the door example, you can create a left- and right-hand door in the same block and then 
use the Visibility parameter to display a left- or right-hand door in the drawing. Figure 17.28 
shows such a door block. The Visibility parameter has been renamed Hand in the block. When 
the door is inserted in the drawing, you see a list that allows you to select Left or Right.
	
6.	 Select Jetted from the list. The jetted bathtub appears (see the right image in Figure 17.27).
	
7.	 Click the Bathtub block again, click the Visibility grip, and select Corner. The Corner tub 
appears.
	
8.	 Save and close the drawing. 
Controlling the Visibility of Invisible Objects
While you’re editing in the Block Editor, you can set up AutoCAD to display objects whose visibility 
has been turned off. If you set the bvmode system variable to 1, objects appear gray when their 
visibility has been turned off. You can also click the Visibility Mode tool in the Block Editor tab’s 
Visibility panel.

Rotating Objects in Unison
You’ve seen how actions and parameters can control the behavior of a single object in a block. 
You can also apply actions to multiple objects so that they move or change in unison. The 

590  | CHAPTER 17  Using Dynamic Blocks   
You’ll use the red lines to define the rotation angle of the parts. The vertical line is fixed in 
place, whereas the rest of the parts are constrained in such a way as to allow a rotational motion.
Now add some angular constraints to define the rotation:
	
1.	 In the Dimensional panel, click the Angular tool.
	
2.	 Click the left vertical line toward the top, as shown in Figure 17.30.
	
3.	 Next, click the left horizontal line toward the right end of the line, as shown in 
Figure 17.30.
	
4.	 Place the dimension, as shown in Figure 17.30.
	
5.	 The dimension text is highlighted. You want to keep the current value, so press ↵ to 
accept the default.
following example shows how you can apply more than one Angular Constraint parameter to 
control two objects:
	
1.	 Open the gatesample.dwg file. In this sample file, the part that will move consists of the 
two non-red objects. The red lines have been added to help facilitate the rotation feature 
of the block.
	
2.	 Double-click the object in the drawing to open the Edit Block Definition dialog box, and 
then click OK. The Gate block opens for editing.
	
3.	 Click the Show All Geometric Constraints tool in the Block Editor tab’s Geometric panel 
to reveal some of the existing constraints.
You can see how this drawing has been prepared for this exercise. The non-red parts 
of the drawing, which we’ll call gates, are blocks that are constrained to the red lines with 
coincident constraints. The endpoints of the lines are constrained to the center of the arcs. 
The horizontal red lines are constrained to the vertical ones, also with coincident con-
straints, and the vertical lines are constrained at both ends with a fixed constraint (see 
Figure 17.29).

3.	 Click the right horizontal line near its right end (see Figure 17.31).
	
4.	 Place the dimension as shown in Figure 17.31.
	
5.	 At the highlighted text, type ang1↵. This will cause this constraint to follow the first one 
that you added.
You have the first angular dimensional constraint in place. Next add a second one to the gate 
on the right, but this time you’ll use the name of the first angular constraint as the dimension 
for the second one:
	
1.	 In the Dimensional panel, click the Angular tool.
	
2.	 Click the right vertical line near its top, as shown in Figure 17.31.
First click here…
…then click here.

5.	 Click the arrow grip again, and type 90↵ to set the gate back to its original position.
You’ve got the basic function of the gate working, but you don’t want the red lines to appear 
in the drawing since they are there to facilitate the action of the gate and are not really part of 
the drawing. Do the following to hide the red lines:
	
1.	 Double-click the Gate block to open the Edit Block Definition dialog box, and then click 
OK. The Gate block opens for editing.
	
2.	 Click the Construction Geometry tool in the Manage panel.
	
3.	 Select the four red lines and press ↵↵. Notice that the lines change from solid to dashed, 
indicating that they are now construction geometry.
	
4.	 Click the Close Block Editor tool, and save the block. The block now appears without the 
red lines. If you click the block, the rotation grip still appears, and you can alter the block 
as before.
Now suppose that you want to have the gates rotate in opposite directions instead of in the 
same direction. You can add a user-defined formula to modify the behavior of the angular 
constraints:
	
1.	 Double-click the Gate block to open the Edit Block Definition dialog box, and then click 
OK. The Gate block opens for editing.
	
2.	 Click the Parameters Manager tool to open the Parameters Manager palette. You may 
recall that in Chapter 16, you used this palette to control the size of a concentric circle.
	
3.	 Double-click in the Expression column of the ang2 option, and type ang1 * -1↵.
	
4.	 Close the Parameters Manager palette, and then save and close the block.
Now you’re ready to save the block and try it out:
	
1.	 Click Close Block Editor on the Block Editor tab’s Close panel, and save the block.
	
2.	 Click the block to expose its grips.
	
3.	 Click the arrow grip on the horizontal line.
	
4.	 Type 45↵. Both sides of the block rotate about their own centers to a 45-degree angle (see 
Figure 17.32).
Figure 17.32
The two parts rotate in unison.

Filling In a Space Automatically with Objects |  593  
	
7.	 Press Esc to clear the selection, and then save and close the file.
You can go on to add a block table using the Block Table tool to create a predefined set of 
angles, just as you did for the Door block earlier in this chapter. You can also add incremental 
values by using the Properties palette to change the angle constraint in a way similar to how 
you changed constraints in the sink exercise in the first part of this chapter.
Next let’s take a look at a way to array objects automatically with dynamic blocks.
Filling In a Space Automatically with Objects
Perhaps one of the more tedious tasks that you’ll face is drawing the vertical bars of a hand rail-
ing for an elevation view. You can draw a single bar and then use the Array command to repeat 
the bar as many times as needed, but when you have to edit the railing, you may find that you’re 
spending more time adding and erasing bars.
In the next example, you’ll see how you can create a block that automatically fills in vertical 
bars as the width of the railing changes. You’ll start with an existing drawing of a single vertical 
bar and an outline of the railing opening around the bar:
	
1.	 Open the railsample.dwg file.
	
2.	 Double-click the object in the drawing to open the Edit Block Definition dialog box, and 
then click OK. This opens the Railvertical block for editing.
When the Block Editor opens, notice that the block already has a Linear parameter and a 
Stretch action added. Recall from the sink example at the beginning of this chapter that 
the Linear parameter and Stretch action let you vary the width of an object. In this case, 
the outermost rectangle is being stretched.
	
3.	 On the Actions tab of the Block Authoring palettes, click the Array action.
	
4.	 At the Select parameter: prompt, click the blue Linear parameter (labeled as Distance), 
as shown in Figure 17.34.
	
5.	 Click the gate to select it, and then click the arrow grip.
	
6.	 Type 22↵. Now the two parts rotate in opposite directions (see Figure 17.33).
Figure 17.33
The gates moving in 
opposite directions

594  | CHAPTER 17  Using Dynamic Blocks   
	
10.	 Exit and save the file.
	
5.	 At the Select objects: prompt, select the dark vertical rectangle representing the verti-
cal bar of the railing, as shown in Figure 17.34, and then press ↵.
	
6.	 At the Enter the distance between columns (|||): prompt, enter 4↵.
	
7.	 Click Close Block Editor on the Block Editor tab’s Close panel and save the changes.
	
8.	 Click the block to expose its grips.
	
9.	 Click and drag the blue arrow grip to the right. As the rail expands, additional vertical 
bars are added at 4″ intervals (see Figure 17.35).
Select the inner rectangle.
Click the Distance parameter.

Including Block Information with Data Extraction |  595  
Including Block Information with Data Extraction
In Chapter 12, “Using Attributes,” you learned how you could attach data to blocks through 
attributes and then extract that data to spreadsheets or AutoCAD tables. You can also include 
dynamic block information that has been included in a property lookup table. This can be 
extremely useful for generating data for a bill of materials or in other situations if you need to 
track the numbers and types of items in your drawing.
To see how this works, you’ll return to a version of the Door block that has some additions. 
This enhanced version of the Door block includes a left- and right-hand version of the door that 
is controlled with the Visibility parameter. Figure 17.36 shows the door inserted into a drawing 
using different door sizes and left and right variations.
You can now use this block wherever you need to draw a simple railing with vertical bars. 
Another example of how the Array action might be used is in a side view of a bolt. You could 
show the threads of the bolt and use the Array action to increase the number of threads as the 
bolt is lengthened.
Using Parameter Sets
You probably noticed the Parameter Sets tab in the Block Authoring palettes. The options in this 
tab are predefined combinations of parameters and actions that are commonly used together. For 
example, the Polar Array set inserts a Polar parameter with an Array action. You only need to sup-
ply the object. The Polar Array set causes the associated object to rotate about a center point with 
a grip. You can also array the object by stretching the grip away from the rotation center.
To associate an object with a parameter set, right-click the action icon associated with a parameter 
(usually appearing below the parameter), and then select Action Selection Set ➢ New Selection Set. 
At the Select objects: prompt, select an object. If a stretch is employed, select a stretch frame 
and an object to stretch.

8.	 Click Next. On the Refine Data page, you see the data that will be exported to a spread-
sheet file or a table (see Figure 17.38).
You’ll use the Attribute Extraction command to see how the dynamic block data appears as 
an exported table or a spreadsheet:
	
1.	 Open the 17-extractsample.dwg file. This file contains a dynamic door block that is 
similar to the one that you created earlier with the addition of a left and a right Visibility 
parameter.
	
2.	 From the Annotate tab’s Tables panel, click the Extract Data tool to start the Data 
Extraction Wizard.
	
3.	 On the Begin screen, click Next.
	
4.	 In the Save Data Extraction As dialog box, enter Test for the name and click Save. Note 
that the Test file will be saved in the My Documents folder. If you want to place it some-
where else, make sure that you browse to the location that you prefer.
	
5.	 On the Define Data Source screen, click Next.
	
6.	 On the Select Objects screen, remove the check mark from the Display All Object Types 
option so that only the Door block appears in the list and then click Next.
	
7.	 On the Select Properties screen, remove the check mark from all but the Dynamic Block 
option in the right column, and make sure the Hand and Width options in the left col-
umn are the only ones selected (see Figure 17.37).

The Bottom Line |  597  
The Bottom Line
Work with the Block Editor.    To create dynamic blocks, you need to become familiar 
with the Block Editor. You can use the Block Editor to modify existing blocks in your 
drawing.
Master It    What does the Edit Block Definition dialog box allow you to do?
	
9.	 You don’t really want to extract this data, so once you’ve taken a good look at this screen, 
click Cancel and then Yes in the Quit Wizard dialog box.
This is the end of the door example, so you can exit this file. Save it for future reference if you 
like.
As you can see in Figure 17.38, a list is generated that shows each door in the drawing with its 
size and handedness. You could use this data as part of a door schedule.

the Refine Data 
screen of the Data 
Extraction Wizard
Take Care Using the Mirror Tool
If you use the Mirror command to mirror a block that contains a Visibility parameter to control left- 
and right-hand doors, the Attribute Extraction command will report erroneous results. Therefore, 
be sure that if you set up a block with a visibility parameter to control mirrored states, you use 
those actions to edit the door and don’t rely on standard editing tools. That way, you’ll ensure the 
accuracy of your extracted data.

Drawing Curves 
So far in this book, you’ve been using basic lines, arcs, and circles to create your drawings in 
the Autodesk® AutoCAD® software. Now it’s time to add polylines and spline curves to your 
repertoire. Polylines offer many options for creating forms, including solid fills and free-form 
curved lines. Spline curves are perfect for drawing accurate and smooth nonlinear objects.

Introducing Polylines
Polylines are like composite line segments and arcs. A polyline may look like a series of line 
segments, but it acts like a single object. This characteristic makes polylines useful for a variety 
of applications, as you’ll see in the upcoming exercises.
Drawing a Polyline
First, to learn about the polyline, you’ll begin a drawing of the top view of the joint shown in 
Figure 18.1.

Objective
Figure 18.1

600  | CHAPTER 18  Drawing Curves   
Follow these steps to draw the joint:
	
1.	 Open a new file using the acad.dwt template, switch off the grid, and save it as 
Joint2d.dwg. Don’t bother to make special setting changes because you’ll create 
this drawing with the default settings.
	
2.	 From the Navigation bar, choose Zoom All from the flyout or type Z↵A↵.
	
3.	 Click the Polyline tool on the Draw panel, or type PL↵.
	
4.	 At the Specify start point: prompt, enter a point at coordinate 3,3 to start your polyline.
	
5.	 At the Specify next point or [Arc/Halfwidth/Length/Undo/Width]: prompt, 
enter @3<0↵ to draw a horizontal line of the joint.
	
6.	 At the Specify next point or [Arc/Close/Halfwidth/Length/Undo/Width]: prompt, 
click the Arc option in the prompt or enter A↵ to continue your polyline with an arc.
Using the Arc Option in the Polyline Tool
The Arc option lets you draw an arc that starts from the last polyline point that you selected. While 
in the Polyline tool, select the Arc option; as you move your cursor, an arc follows it in a tangential 
direction from the previous line segment of the polyline. You can return to drawing straight line 
segments by entering L↵. If you want the arc to be drawn in the opposite direction from the last 
point instead of a tangent direction, hold down the Ctrl key.
	
7.	 At the prompt
Specify endpoint of arc (hold Ctrl to switch direction) or
[Angle/CEnter/CLose/Direction/Halfwidth/Line/Radius/Second pt/Undo/Width]:
enter @4<90↵ to draw a 180° arc from the last point you entered. Your drawing should 
now look similar to Figure 18.2.
Figure 18.2

Introducing Polylines |  601  
	
8.	 To continue the polyline with another line segment, click the Line option in the prompt or 
enter L↵.
	
9.	 At the Specify next point or [Arc/Close/Halfwidth/Length/Undo/Width]: 
prompt, enter @3<180↵. Another line segment continues from the end of the arc.
	
10.	 Press ↵ to exit the Polyline tool.
You now have a sideways, U-shaped polyline that you’ll use in the next exercise to complete 
the top view of your joint.
Setting Polyline Options
Let’s take a break from the exercise to look at some of the options that you didn’t use in the 
Polyline prompt:
Close    Draws a line segment from the last endpoint of a sequence of line segments to the 
first point picked in that sequence. This works exactly like the Close option for the Line 
command.
Length    Enables you to specify the length of a line that will be drawn at the same angle as 
the last line entered.
Halfwidth    Creates a tapered line segment or an arc by specifying half of its beginning and 
ending widths (see Figure 18.3).

602  | CHAPTER 18  Drawing Curves   
Width    Creates a tapered line segment or an arc by specifying the full width of the segment’s 
beginning and ending points.
Undo    Deletes the last polyline segment drawn.
Radius/Second Pt    The Radius and Second Pt options appear when you use the arc option 
to draw polyline segments. Radius lets you specify a radius for the arc, and Second Pt lets 
you specify a second point in a three-point arc.
If you want to break a polyline into simple lines and arcs, you can use the Explode option on 
the Modify panel, just as you would with blocks. After a polyline is exploded, it becomes a set of 
individual lines or arcs.
To turn off the filling of solid polylines, open the Options dialog box and click the Display 
tab. Clear the Apply Solid Fill check box in the Display Performance group.
Filleting a Polyline
You can use the Fillet tool on the Modify panel to fillet all the vertices of a polyline at once. Click 
the Fillet tool, set your fillet radius by typing R↵ and entering a radius value, type P↵ to select the 
Polyline option, and then pick the polyline you want to fillet. If you want to fillet only two line seg-
ments of a polyline, use the Fillet tool as you normally would to fillet simple lines.
You can also close a polyline with a radius by using the Fillet command on the polyline’s endpoints.

Objective
Editing Polylines
You can edit polylines with many of the standard editing commands. To change the proper-
ties of a polyline, click the polyline to select it, right-click, and select Properties to open the 
Properties palette. You can use the Stretch command on the Modify panel to move vertices 
of a polyline. The Trim, Extend, and Break commands on the Modify panel also work with 
polylines.
In addition, many editing capabilities are offered only for polylines. For instance, later you’ll 
see how to smooth out a polyline using the Fit option in the Pedit command.
In this exercise, you’ll use the Offset command on the Modify panel to add the inside portion 
of the joint:
	
1.	 Click the Offset tool in the Home tab’s Modify panel, or type O↵.
	
2.	 At the Specify offset distance or [Through/Erase/Layer] <Through>: prompt, 
enter 1↵ .
	
3.	 At the Select object to offset or [Exit/Undo]<Exit>: prompt, pick the U-shaped 
polyline that you just drew.
	
4.	 At the Specify point on side to offset or [Exit/Multiple/Undo] <Exit>: 
prompt, pick a point on the inside of the U shape. You’ll see a concentric copy of the 
polyline appear (see Figure 18.4).
	
5.	 Press ↵ to exit the Offset command.

Next, complete the top view of the joint. To do this, you’ll use the Edit Polyline tool, otherwise 
known as the Pedit command:
	
1.	 Connect the ends of the polylines with two short line segments (see Figure 18.6).
	
2.	 Choose Edit Polyline from the expanded Modify panel or type PE↵.
	
3.	 At the Select polyline or [Multiple]: prompt, pick the outermost polyline.

8.	 Click the drawing to expose its grips. The entire object is highlighted, indicating that all 
the lines have been joined into a single polyline.

Objective
What to Do If the Join Option Doesn’t Work
If the objects to be joined don’t touch, you can use the fuzz join feature. Type PE↵M↵ to start the 
Pedit command with the Multiple option, and then select all the objects that you want to join and 
press ↵. If you see a convert message, enter Y↵. At the Enter an option [Close/Open/Join/
Width/Fit/Spline/Decurve/Ltype gen/Reverse/Undo]: prompt, click the Join option in the 
prompt or enter J↵. At the Enter fuzz distance or [Jointype]: prompt, enter a distance 
that approximates the size of the gap between objects. By default, AutoCAD extends the lines so 
that they join end to end. You can use the Jointype option if you want Pedit to join segments with 
an additional segment.
By using the Width option under Edit Polyline, you can change the width of a polyline. Let’s 
change the width of your polyline to give some width to the outline of the joint. To do this, 
you’ll use the Edit Polyline tool again, but this time you’ll use a shortcut:
	
1.	 Double-click the polyline.

5.	 Save this file.
In most cases, you can simply double-click a polyline to start the Pedit command. But if you 
want to edit multiple polylines or if you want to convert an object or set of objects into a poly-
line, use the Edit Polyline tool from the expanded Modify panel to start Pedit.
In addition, you can select the Edit Polyline options from a menu that appears at the cursor 
(see Figure 18.8) if the Dynamic Input feature is on or by selecting the polyline and then right-
clicking anywhere in the drawing to access the Polyline options from the context menu.

Setting Pedit Options
Here’s a brief look at a few of the Pedit options that you didn’t try:
Close    Connects the two endpoints of a polyline with a line segment. If the polyline that you 
selected to be edited is already closed, this option changes to Open.
Open    Removes the last segment added to a closed polyline.
Spline/Decurve    The Spline option smooths a polyline into a spline curve (discussed in 
detail later in this chapter). The Decurve option changes a spline or fit curve polyline back 
into its original shape before the Spline or Fit option was applied.
Edit Vertex    Lets you edit each vertex of a polyline individually (discussed in detail later in 
this chapter).
Fit    Turns polyline segments into a series of arcs.
Ltype Gen    Controls the way noncontinuous linetypes pass through the vertices of a polyline. 
If you have a fitted or spline curve with a noncontinuous linetype, turn on this option.
Reverse    Reverses the orientation of a polyline. The orientation is based on the order in 
which points are selected to create the polyline. The first point picked is the beginning (or 
point 1), the next point is point 2, and so on. In some cases, you may want to reverse this order 
using the Reverse option.
Undo    Removes the last polyline line segment.
Find the Geometric Center of a Closed Polyline or Spline
You can use object snaps (osnaps) to snap to the geometric center of a closed polyline or spline. 
When you are in a command that asks you to select a point, Shift-right-click and select Geometric 
Center from the Osnap menu. You can also type Gcen↵. Place the cursor on the closed polyline 
or spline, and the Geometric Center osnap marker appears at its geometric center. There may be a 
momentary delay as AutoCAD locates the center. You can also move the cursor inside the closed 
polyline or spline to find the center. The Geometric Center osnap marker looks like an asterisk to 
differentiate it from the Center osnap marker used for arcs and circles.
Using Polylines to Set Lineweights
Typically, you would use the Lineweight feature of AutoCAD to set lineweights in your drawing. In 
cases where the Lineweight feature will not work, you can change the thickness of regular lines and 
arcs using Pedit to change them into polylines and then use the Width option to change their width.
Smoothing Polylines
You can create a curve in AutoCAD in many ways. If you don’t need the representation of a curve 
to be accurate, you can use a polyline curve. In the following exercise, you’ll draw a polyline 
curve to represent a contour on a topographical map:
	
1.	 Open the topo.dwg file. The top image in Figure 18.9 contains the drawing of survey 
data. Some of the contours have already been drawn in between the data points.

Editing Polylines |  607  
	
2.	 Zoom in to the upper-right corner of the drawing so that your screen displays the area 
shown in the bottom image in Figure 18.9.
	
3.	 Click the Polyline tool on the Draw panel. Using the Center osnap, draw a polyline that 
connects the points labeled 254.00. Your drawing should look like the bottom image in 
Figure 18.9.
Figure 18.9
The topo.dwg file 
shows survey data por-
trayed in an AutoCAD 
drawing. Notice the 
dots indicating where 
elevations were taken. 
The actual elevation 
value is shown with a 
diagonal line from the 
point.
	
4.	 Press ↵.
	
5.	 Next you’ll convert the polyline that you just drew into a smooth contour line. Double-click 
the contour polyline line that you just drew.

608  | CHAPTER 18  Drawing Curves   
	
6.	 At the prompt
Enter an option
[Close/Join/Width/Edit vertex/Fit/Spline/Decurve/Ltype gen/Reverse/Undo]:
click the Fit option in the prompt or type F↵. The polyline smooths out into a series of 
connected arcs that pass through the data points.
	
7.	 Press ↵ to end the command.
Your contour is now complete. The Fit option under the Pedit command causes AutoCAD 
to convert the straight-line segments of the polyline into arcs. The endpoints of the arcs pass 
through the endpoints of the line segments, and the curve of each arc depends on the direction 
of the adjacent arc. This gives the effect of a smooth curve. Next you’ll use this polyline curve to 
experiment with some of the editing options unique to the Pedit command.
Editing Vertices
One of the Pedit options that we haven’t yet discussed, Edit Vertex, is like a command within a 
command. Edit Vertex has numerous suboptions that enable you to fine-tune your polyline by 
giving you control over individual vertices.
To access the Edit Vertex options, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Turn off the DATA and BORDER layers to hide the data points and border.
	
2.	 Double-click the polyline that you just drew.
	
3.	 Type E↵ to enter Edit Vertex mode. An X appears at the beginning of the polyline indicat-
ing the vertex that will be affected by the Edit Vertex options.
When using Edit Vertex, you must be careful about selecting the correct vertex to be edited. 
Edit Vertex has 10 options. You often have to exit the Edit Vertex operation and use Pedit’s Fit 
option to see the effect of several Edit Vertex options on a curved polyline.
After you enter the Edit Vertex mode of the Pedit command, you can perform the following 
functions:
◆
◆
Break the polyline between two vertices.
◆
◆
Insert a new vertex.
◆
◆
Move an existing vertex.
◆
◆
Regenerate (type RE↵) the drawing to view the current shape of the polyline.
◆
◆
Straighten a polyline between two vertices.
◆
◆
Change the tangential direction of a vertex.
◆
◆
Change the width of the polyline at a vertex.
These functions are presented in the form of the following prompt:
[Next/Previous/Break/Insert/Move/Regen/Straighten/Tangent/Width/eXit] <N>:
The following sections examine each of the options in this prompt, starting with Next and 
Previous.

Editing Polylines |  609  
The Next and Previous Options
The Next and Previous options let you select a vertex for editing. When you start the Edit Vertex 
option, an X appears on the selected polyline to designate its beginning. As you select Next or 
Previous, the X moves from vertex to vertex to show which one is being edited. Let’s try it:
	
1.	 Press ↵ a few times to move the X along the polyline. (Because Next is the default option, 
you only need to press ↵ to move the X.)
	
2.	 Type P↵ for Previous. The X moves in the opposite direction. The default option becomes P.
Why Reverse a Polyline?
One of the more frequently asked questions that we receive from readers is “How can I reverse the 
direction of a polyline?” It may seem like an odd question to someone new to AutoCAD, but revers-
ing a polyline has quite a few uses. Perhaps the most common use is to turn a polyline that uses 
a complex linetype, one that includes text, right side up so that the text can be read more easily. 
(See Chapter 24, “Customizing Toolbars, Menus, Linetypes, and Hatch Patterns,” for an example 
of a linetype that includes text.) If for some reason you need to reverse the direction of a polyline 
or spline, you can do so by using the Reverse option in the Pedit command.
Turning Objects into Polylines and Polylines into Splines
At times, you’ll want to convert regular lines, arcs, or even circles into polylines. You might want 
to change the width of lines or join lines to form a single object such as a boundary. Here are the 
steps to convert lines, arcs, and circles into polylines:
	1.	 Click the Edit Polyline tool from the Home tab’s expanded Modify panel, or type PE↵ at the 
Command prompt.
	2.	 At the Select polyline or [Multiple]: prompt, pick the object that you want to convert. If 
you want to convert a circle to a polyline, first break the circle (using the Break tool on the expanded 
Modify panel) so that it becomes an arc of approximately 359.
	3.	 At the prompt
Object selected is not a polyline. Do you want to turn it into one? <Y>:
press ↵. The object is converted into a polyline.
If you want to convert several objects to polylines, type M↵ at the Select polyline or 
[Multiple]: prompt; then select the objects that you want to convert and press ↵. You will 
see the Convert Lines, Arcs and Splines to polylines [Yes/No]? <Y>: prompt. 
Type Y↵, and all the selected objects are converted to polylines. You can then go on to use other 
Pedit options on the selected objects.
To turn a polyline into a true spline curve, do the following:
	1.	 Click the Edit Polyline tool from the Home tab’s expanded Modify panel, or type PE↵. Select the 
polyline that you want to convert.

The Break Option
The Break option breaks the polyline between two vertices:
	
1.	 Position the X on one end of the segment that you want to break.
	
2.	 Enter B↵ at the Command prompt.
	
3.	 At the Enter an option [Next/Previous/Go/eXit] <N>: prompt, use Next or 
Previous to move the X to the other end of the segment to be broken.
	
4.	 When the X is in the proper position, enter G↵ to break the polyline (see Figure 18.10).
	2.	 Type S↵ to turn it into a polyline spline, and then press ↵ to exit the Pedit command.
	3.	 Click the Spline Fit tool on the Home tab’s expanded Draw panel or type SPL↵.
	4.	 At the Specify first point or [Method/Knots/Object]: prompt, click the Object option 
in the prompt or type O↵.
	5.	 At the Select spline-fit polyline: prompt, click the polyline spline and press ↵. Although 
it may not be apparent at first, the polyline is converted into a true spline.
You can also use the Edit Spline tool on the Home tab’s expanded Modify panel (or enter SPE↵) to 
edit a polyline spline. If you do, the polyline spline is automatically converted into a true spline.
If you know you’ll always want to convert an object into a polyline when using Pedit, you can turn 
on the Peditaccept system variable. Enter peditaccept↵ at the Command prompt, and then 
enter 1↵.

The Insert Option
Next try the Insert option, which inserts a new vertex:
	
1.	 Type X↵ to exit the Edit Vertex option temporarily. Then type U↵ to undo the break.
	
2.	 Type E↵ to return to the Edit Vertex option.
	
3.	 Press ↵ to advance the X marker to the next point.
	
4.	 Enter I↵ to select the Insert option.
	
5.	 When the prompt Specify location for new vertex: appears, along with a 
rubber-banding line originating from the current X position (see Figure 18.11), pick 
a point indicating the new vertex location. The polyline is redrawn with the new 
vertex.
Figure 18.11
The new vertex location
Rubber-banding line
New vertex location
Current vertex location
Notice that the inserted vertex appears between the currently marked vertex and the 
next vertex; this demonstrates that the Insert option is sensitive to the direction of the 
polyline. If the polyline is curved, the new vertex won’t immediately be shown as curved. 
(See the first image in Figure 18.12.) You must smooth it out by exiting the Edit Vertex 
option and then using the Fit option, as you did to edit the site plan. (See the second image 
in Figure 18.12.) You can also use the Stretch command (on the Modify panel) to move a 
polyline vertex.

612  | CHAPTER 18  Drawing Curves   
The Move Option
In this brief exercise, you’ll use the Move option to move a vertex:
	
1.	 Undo the inserted vertex by exiting the Edit Vertex option (enter X↵) and typing U↵.
	
2.	 Restart the Edit Vertex option, and use the Next or Previous option to place the X on the 
vertex that you want to move.
	
3.	 Enter M↵ for the Move option.
	
4.	 When the Specify new location for marked vertex: prompt appears, along with 
a rubber-banding line originating from the X (see the first image in Figure 18.13), pick 
the new vertex. The polyline is redrawn (see the second image in Figure 18.13). Again, 
if the line is curved, the new vertex appears as a sharp angle until you use the Fit option 
(see the final image in Figure 18.13).
You can also move a polyline vertex by using its grip.

The Straighten Option
The Straighten option straightens a segment of a polyline by removing all the vertices 
between two selected vertices, replacing them with a straight-line segment. Using the 
Straighten option is a quick way to delete vertices from a polyline, as shown in the following 
exercise:
	
1.	 Undo the moved vertex (from the previous exercise).
	
2.	 Start the Edit Vertex option again, and select the starting vertex for the straight-line 
segment.
	
3.	 Enter S↵ for the Straighten option.
	
4.	 At the Enter an option [Next/Previous/Go/eXit] <N>: prompt, move the X to the 
location for the other end of the straight-line segment.
	
5.	 After the X is in the proper position, enter G↵ for the Go option. The polyline straightens 
between the two selected vertices (see Figure 18.14).
Figure 18.14

straightening
The Tangent Option
The Tangent option alters the direction of a curve on a curve-fitted polyline:
	
1.	 Undo the straightened segment from the previous exercise.
	
2.	 Restart the Edit Vertex option, and position the X on the vertex that you want to alter.
	
3.	 Enter T↵ for the Tangent option. A rubber-banding line appears (see the top image in 
Figure 18.15).

4.	 Point the rubber-banding line in the direction of the new tangent, and click. An arrow

Don’t worry if the polyline shape doesn’t change. You must use Fit to see the effect of the 
Tangent (see the final image in Figure 18.15).

616  | CHAPTER 18  Drawing Curves   
The Width Option
Finally, you’ll try the Width option. Unlike the Pedit command’s Width option, the Edit Vertex/
Width option lets you alter the width of the polyline at any vertex. Thus, you can taper or other-
wise vary polyline thicknesses. Try these steps:
	
1.	 Undo the tangent arc from the previous exercise.
	
2.	 Return to the Edit Vertex option, and place the X at the beginning vertex of a polyline 
segment that you want to change.
	
3.	 Type W↵ to issue the Width option.
	
4.	 At the Specify starting width for next segment <0.0000>: prompt, enter a 
value—12↵, for example—indicating the polyline width desired at this vertex.
	
5.	 At the Specify ending width for next segment <12.0000>: prompt, enter the 
width—24↵, for example—for the next vertex.
The width of the polyline changes to your specifications (see Figure 18.16).
Figure 18.16

width of one segment

The Width option is useful when you want to create an irregular or curved area in your 
drawing that is to be filled in solid. This is another option that is sensitive to the polyline 
direction.

Creating a Polyline Spline Curve |  617  
Creating a Polyline Spline Curve
The Pedit command’s Spline option offers you a way to draw smoother and more controllable 
curves than those produced by the Fit option. A polyline spline doesn’t pass through the vertex 
points as does a fitted curve. Instead, the vertex points act as weights pulling the curve in their 
direction. These “weighted” vertex points are called control vertices. The polyline spline touches 
only its beginning and end vertices. Figure 18.17 illustrates this concept.
Filling In Solid Areas
You’ve learned how to create a solid area by increasing the width of a polyline segment. But sup-
pose that you want to create a solid shape or a thick line. AutoCAD provides the Solid, Trace, and 
Donut commands to help you draw simple filled areas. The Trace command acts just like the Line 
command (with the added feature of allowing you to draw wide line segments). Solid lets you create 
solid filled areas with straight sides, and Donut draws circles with a solid width.
You can create free-form, solid-filled areas by using the Solid hatch pattern. Create an enclosed 
area by using any set of objects, and then use the Hatch tool to apply a solid hatch pattern to the 
area. See Chapter 7, “Mastering Viewing Tools, Hatches, and External References,” for details on 
using the Hatch tool.

A polyline spline curve doesn’t represent a mathematically true curve. See the next section, 
“Using True Spline Curves,” to learn how to draw a more accurate spline curve.
Let’s see how using a polyline spline curve may influence the way you edit a curve:
	
1.	 Undo the width changes you made in the previous exercise. If you’re still in the polyline 
edit mode, you can do this by pressing the Esc key.
	
2.	 To change the contour into a polyline spline curve, double-click the polyline to be 
curved.
	
3.	 At the Enter an option [Close/Join/Width/Edit vertex/Fit/Spline/Decurve/
Ltype gen/Reverse/Undo]: prompt, type S↵. Your curve changes to look like 
Figure 18.18.
Figure 18.18

4.	 Press ↵ to exit Edit Polyline.
The curve takes on a smoother, more graceful appearance. It no longer passes through 
the points that you used to define it. To see where the points went and to find out how spline 
curves act, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the curve. The original vertices appear as grips (see the first image in 
Figure 18.19).
	
2.	 Click the grip that is second from the top of the curve, as shown in the first image in 
Figure 18.19, and move the grip around. The curve follows your moves, giving you 
immediate feedback on how it will look.
	
3.	 Pick a point as shown in the second image in Figure 18.19. The curve is now fixed in its 
new position, as shown in the bottom image of Figure 18.19.

Using True Spline Curves |  619  
Using True Spline Curves
So far, you’ve been working with polylines to generate spline curves. The advantage of using 
polylines for curves is that they can be enhanced in many ways. You can modify their width, for 
instance, or join several curves. But at times, you’ll need a more exact representation of a curve.
The spline object, created by choosing the Spline Fit or Spline CV tool in the Home tab’s 
expanded Draw panel, produces a more accurate model of a spline curve in addition to giving 
you more control over its shape.

The spline objects are true Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) curves. A full description 
of NURBS is beyond the scope of this book, but basically NURBS are standard mathematical 
forms used to represent shapes.
Drawing a True Spline
The following steps describe the process used to create a spline curve. You don’t have to create 
them now. Make a note of this section, and refer to it when you need to draw and edit a spline. 
Here are the steps:
	
1.	 Open the topo2.dwg file.
	
2.	 Choose the Spline Fit tool from the expanded Draw panel, or type SPL↵.
	
3.	 At the Specify first point or [Method/Knots/Object]: prompt, select a point to 
start the curve (see Figure 18.20). The prompt changes to Enter next point or 
[start Tangency/toLerance]:.
Figure 18.20
Start the spline 
curve at the first 
data point, and then 
continue to select 
points.
Click a point to
start the spline.
	
4.	 Continue to select points until you’ve entered all the points that you need. As you pick 
points, a curve appears, and it bends and flows as you move your cursor. In Figure 18.20, 
the Center object snap was used to select the donuts that appear as dots in the survey 
plan.
	
5.	 After you’ve selected the last point, press ↵ to exit the Spline command.
If you prefer, you can also control the tangency of the spline at its first and last points. The 
following steps describe how you can use the start Tangency option:
	
1.	 Start the spline just as before, and select the start point. At the Enter next point or 
[start Tangency/toLerance]: prompt, type T↵. A rubber-banding line appears from 
the first point of the curve.

Using True Spline Curves |  621  
	
2.	 The prompt changes to Specify start tangent:. Select a point indicating the tangency 
of the first point.
	
3.	 Continue to select the other points of your spline. After you’ve selected the last point, 
type T↵.
	
4.	 Use the cursor to indicate the tangency of the spline at the last point.
You now have a smooth curve that passes through the points that you selected. These points 
are called the fit points. If you click the curve, you’ll see the grips appear at the location of these 
fit points, and you can adjust the curve by clicking the grip points and moving them. You’ll also 
see an arrowhead grip that appears at the beginning of the spline. If you click this arrowhead 
grip, you see two options: Fit and Control Vertices (see Figure 18.21).
Figure 18.21
The Fit and Control 
Vertices options
Click the arrowhead…
…to open the 
list of options.
The Show Fit Points option will display the grips at the fit points, which are the points that 
you used to draw the spline in the previous example. By default, these fit points lie on the spline, 
though you can adjust how closely the spline follows the fit points. You can also view the control 
vertices (CVs), which are points that control the curvature of the spline and do not lie on the 
spline itself (see Figure 18.17 earlier). Along with the CVs, you see a set of vectors called the 
control polyline. The control polyline helps you to visualize the relationship between the CVs and 
the spline.
Understanding the Spline Options
You may have noticed a few other options in the first Spline command prompt. When you start 
the Spline command, you see the Method, Knots, Degree, and Object options:
Method    Method lets you choose between Fit and CV. The Fit option causes the spline to be 
drawn through the lines that you select. The CV, or Control Vertices, option causes the spline 

622  | CHAPTER 18  Drawing Curves   
to use your selected points as control vertices (see Figure 18.17 earlier). After you’ve drawn a 
spline, you can switch between fit and CV views of your polyline (see Figure 18.21 earlier).
Knots    This option is available only if Fit is chosen in the Method option discussed previously. 
This option offers three additional options: Chord, Square Root, and Uniform. These options 
affect the shape of the spline as it passes through the fit point.
Chord    The Chord option numbers the knots with decimal values.
Square Root    The Square Root option numbers the knots based on the square root of the 
chord length between consecutive knots.
Uniform    The Uniform option numbers the knots in consecutive integers.
Degree    This option is available only if CV is chosen in the Method option discussed previously. 
The Degree option gives you control over the number of control vectors required to create a 
bend in the spline. You can use the values 1 through 10. The value 1 will cause the spline to pro-
duce straight lines, 2 will generate sharp curves, 3 will generate less sharp curves, and so on. In 
simple terms, the Degree value controls how closely the spline follows its control polyline.
Object    Object lets you convert a polyline into a spline. If the Fit option is selected under the 
Method option, you can convert only a spline-fitted polyline. If the CV option is selected under 
the Method option, you can select any polyline. With the CV Method option, the polyline will 
change shape so that the polyline vectors become control vectors.
After you start to select points for the spline, you see the end Tangency, toLerance, Undo, and 
Close options. Table 18.1 describes these options.
Table 18.1:	
The Spline command options for selecting points
Option
Function
end Tangency
Gives you control over the tangency at the beginning and end points of the spline.
toLerance
Lets you control how the curve passes through the fit points. The default value 0 
causes the curve to pass through the fit points. Any value greater than 0 causes 
the curve to pass close to, but not through, the points.
Undo
Lets you undo a point selection in case you select the wrong point.
Close
Lets you close the curve into a loop. If you choose this option, you’re prompted to 
indicate a tangent direction for the closing point. This option does not appear 
until at least three points have been chosen.
Joining Splines to Other Objects
While editing drawings, you may encounter a situation where a spline has been broken into two 
splines and you need the broken spline to behave as a single spline. The Join command will “mend” 
a broken spline, or any set of splines for that matter, as long as the splines are contiguous (touching

Fine-Tuning Spline Curves
Spline curves are different from other types of objects, and many of the standard editing com-
mands won’t work on splines. For making changes to splines, AutoCAD offers the Edit Spline 
tool, otherwise known as the Splinedit command, in the Home tab’s expanded Modify panel.
Controlling the Fit Data of a Spline
The Fit Data option of the Splinedit command lets you adjust the tangency of the beginning and 
endpoints, add new control points, and adjust spline tolerance settings. To get to these options, 
follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Edit Spline from the expanded Modify panel, or type SPE↵ at the Command 
prompt.
	
2.	 At the Select spline: prompt, select the last spline that you drew in the previous 
exercise.

4.	 At the [Add/Close/Delete/Kink/Move/Purge/Tangents/toLerance/eXit] <eXit>:

point of the first and last points. Table 18.2 lists the Splinedit Fit Data options and their 
purposes.
If you prefer, you can double-click a spline to start the Splinedit command instead of select-
ing the Edit Spline tool in the Modify panel. If you have the Dynamic Input feature turned 
on, you can select Splinedit options from a menu that appears at the cursor (see Figure 18.22) 
instead of typing in the option keyboard shortcuts. If you double-click the polyline to select it 
and then right-click anywhere in the drawing, a context menu will appear that also shows the 
options.
end to end). To use the Join command, click the Join tool from the Home tab’s expanded Modify 
panel or type Join↵. Select the splines that you want to join.
Join can be used with other objects as well. You can join lines, polylines, 3D polylines, arcs, elliptical 
arcs, and helixes with the following restrictions:
◆
◆
Any of these objects can be joined to a spline, polyline, 3D polyline, or helix.
◆
◆
Lines cannot be joined to arcs or elliptical arcs.
◆
◆
Arcs cannot be joined to elliptical arcs.
◆
◆
Arcs must have the same center point and radius but can have a gap between the segments that 
you wish to join. The same is true for elliptical arcs.
◆
◆
Lines must be collinear, but there can be gaps between the lines to be joined.
◆
◆
Unless you are joining to a polyline or 3D polyline, objects must be on the same plane.

Using Grip Options
The Splinedit command gives you a lot of control when you want to edit a spline. But if you 
want to make some minor changes, you can use the pop-up menu that appears when you hover 
over a grip on the spline. First, click the spline to expose its grips, and then hover over a fit point 
or CV. The list of options appears.

Marking Divisions on Curves |  625  
The options are slightly different depending on whether you have the fit points or CVs 
displayed. The options enable you to add or remove a fit point or CV quickly, and in the case 
of CVs, you also have the Refine Vertices option. The Refine option lets you control the pull 
exerted on a spline by a CV.
When Can’t You Use Fit Data?
The Fit Data option of the Splinedit command offers many ways to edit a spline. However, this 
option isn’t available to all spline curves. When you invoke certain other Splinedit options, a 
spline curve loses its fit data, thereby disabling the Fit Data option. These operations are as 
follows:
◆
◆
Fitting a spline to a tolerance (Spline toLerance) and moving its control vertices.
◆
◆
Fitting a spline to a tolerance and opening or closing it.
◆
◆
Refining the spline.
◆
◆
Purging the spline of its fit data by using the Purge option of the Splinedit command. 
(Choose Edit Spline from the expanded Modify panel, or enter SPE↵; then select the spline 
and enter F↵P↵.)
Also note that the Fit Data option isn’t available when you edit spline curves that were created 
from polyline splines. See the sidebar “Turning Objects into Polylines and Polylines into Splines” 
earlier in this chapter.
If you’d like to learn more about the Splinedit options, check the AutoCAD Exchange website. 
It offers a detailed description of how these options work.
Marking Divisions on Curves
Perhaps one of the most difficult things to do in manual drafting is to mark regular intervals on 
a curve. AutoCAD offers the Divide and Measure commands to help you perform this task with 
speed and accuracy.
You can find the Divide and Measure tools on the expanded Draw Ribbon panel, as shown in 
Figure 18.23. Click the title bar of the Draw panel to find the Divide and Measure tools.

Measure tools are in

Converting a Spline into a Polyline
AutoCAD allows you to convert a spline object into a polyline. This can be very useful when you 
want to edit a spline using the polyline edit tools instead of the spline editing tools. You will lose 
some precision in the conversion, but more often than not this is not an issue.
continues

626  | CHAPTER 18  Drawing Curves   
The Divide and Measure commands are discussed here in conjunction with polylines, but 
you can use these commands on any object except blocks and text.
Dividing Objects into Segments of Equal Length
Use the Divide command to divide an object into a specific number of equal segments. For 
example, suppose that you need to mark off the contour on which you’ve been working in this 
chapter into nine equal segments. One way to do this is first to find the length of the contour by 
using the List command and then sit down with a pencil and paper to figure out the exact dis-
tances between the marks. There is another, easier way, however.
The Divide command places a set of point objects on a line, an arc, a circle, or a polyline, 
marking off exact divisions. The following exercise shows how it works:
	
1.	 Open the 18a-divd.dwg file. This file is similar to the one with which you’ve been work-
ing in the previous exercises.
	
2.	 Click the Divide tool in the expanded Draw panel, or type DIV↵.
	
3.	 At the Select object to divide: prompt, pick the spline contour line that shows Xs in 
Figure 18.24.
To convert a spline to a polyline, double-click the spline and then, at the Enter an option prompt, 
type P↵. At the Specify a precision <10>: prompt, enter a value from 0 to 99. Note that a 
higher precision value may reduce the performance of AutoCAD, so use a reasonable value. You 
may want to experiment with different values and pick the lowest value that will still give you the 
results you want.
Figure 18.24

command on a

4.	 The Enter the number of segments or [Block]: prompt that appears next is asking 
for the number of divisions that you want on the selected object. Enter 9↵.
continued

Marking Divisions on Curves |  627  
The Command prompt returns, and it appears that nothing has happened. But AutoCAD 
has placed several point objects on the contour that indicate the locations of the nine divi-
sions you that requested. To see these points more clearly, continue with the exercise.
	
5.	 Choose Point Style from the Home tab’s expanded Utilities panel, or type DDPTYPE↵ to 
open the Point Style dialog box (see Figure 18.25).
Figure 18.25
The Point Style  
dialog box
	
6.	 Click the X point style in the top row of the dialog box, click the Set Size Relative To 
Screen radio button, and then click OK.
	
7.	 If the Xs don’t appear, enter RE↵. A set of Xs appears showing the nine divisions (shown 
earlier in Figure 18.24).
You can also change the point style by changing the Pdmode system variable. When Pdmode is 
set to 3, the point appears as an X.
The Divide command uses point objects to indicate the division points. You create point 
objects by using the Point command. They usually appear as dots. Unfortunately, such points 
are nearly invisible when placed on top of other objects. But, as you’ve seen, you can alter 
their shape by using the Point Style dialog box. You can use these X points to place objects or 
references to break the object being divided. (The Divide command doesn’t cut the object into 
smaller divisions.)
Sketching with AutoCAD
AutoCAD offers the Sketch command, which lets you do freehand drawing. The Sketch command 
can be set to draw polylines. If you’d like to know more about Sketch, the AutoCAD Help window 
offers several excellent descriptions of how it works. Click the Help tool (the question mark icon) 
in the InfoCenter, and then at the AutoCAD 2017 Help website, enter Sketch in the search box.

628  | CHAPTER 18  Drawing Curves   
Dividing Objects into Specified Lengths
The Measure command acts just like Divide. However, instead of dividing an object into seg-
ments of equal length, the Measure command marks intervals of a specified distance along an 
object. For example, suppose that you need to mark some segments exactly 60″ apart along the 
contour. Try the following exercise to see how the Measure command is used to accomplish 
this task:
	
1.	 Erase the X-shaped point objects.
	
2.	 Click Measure from the expanded Draw panel, or type ME↵.
	
3.	 At the Select object to measure: prompt, pick the contour at a point closest to its 
lower endpoint. We’ll explain shortly why this is important.
	
4.	 At the Specify length of segment or [Block]: prompt, enter 60↵. The X points 
appear at the specified distance.
	
5.	 Exit without saving this file.
Bear in mind that the point you pick on the object to be measured determines where the 
Measure command begins measuring. In the previous exercise, for example, you picked the 
contour near its bottom endpoint. If you picked the top of the contour, the results would 
be different because the measurement would start at the top, not the bottom. If the object’s 
length is not equally divisible by the measured segment length, the last segment will be 
shorter than 60 units.
Finding Hidden Node Points
If you’re in a hurry and you don’t want to bother changing the shape of the point objects, you can 
do the following: Set Running Osnaps to Node. Then, when you’re in Point Selection mode, move 
the cursor over the divided curve. When the cursor gets close to a point object, the Node osnap 
marker appears.
Marking Off Intervals by Using Blocks Instead of Points
You can also use the Block option under the Divide and Measure commands to place blocks at regular 
intervals along a line, a polyline, or an arc. Here’s how to use blocks as markers:
	1.	 Be sure that the block that you want to use is part of the current drawing file.
	2.	 Start either the Divide or Measure command, and then select an object.
	3.	 At the Specify length of segment or [Block]: prompt, enter B↵.
	4.	 At the Enter name of block to insert: prompt, enter the name of a block.
	5.	 At the Align Block with Object? [Yes/No] <Y>: prompt, press ↵ if you want the blocks 
to follow the alignment of the selected object. (Entering N↵ inserts each block at a 0-degree angle.)

The Bottom Line |  629  
The Bottom Line
Create and edit polylines.    Polylines are extremely versatile. You can use them in just about 
any situation where you need to draw line work that is continuous. For this reason, you’ll 
want to master polylines early in your AutoCAD training.

One example of using the Block option of Divide or Measure is to place a row of sinks equally spaced 
along a wall. Alternatively, you might use this technique to make multiple copies of an object along 
an irregular path defined by a polyline. In civil engineering projects, you can indicate a fence line by 
using Divide or Measure to place Xs along a polyline. You can also use the Array command to have 
blocks appear at regular intervals along a spline or polyline. See Chapter 6, “Editing and Reusing 
Data to Work Efficiently,” for more on the Array command.

Master It    Try drawing the outline of an object that contains no or few straight lines, as 
shown in the file lowerfairing.jpg, which is included in the Chapter 18 sample files. 
You can use the methods described in Chapter 13 to import a raster image of your object 
and then trace over the image using polyline splines.
Create and edit true spline curves.    If you need an accurate spline curve, you’ll want to 
use the Spline tool. Spline objects offer many fine-tuning options that you won’t find with 
polylines.
Master It    Try tracing over the same image from the previous “Master” It section, but 
this time use the Spline tool.
Mark divisions on curves.    The Divide and Measure tools offer a quick way to mark off 
distances on a curved object. This can be a powerful resource in AutoCAD that you may 
use often.
Master It    Mark off 12 equal divisions of the spline curve that you drew in the previous 
“Master It” exercise.

Getting and Exchanging Data  
from Drawings 
Autodesk® AutoCAD® drawings contain a wealth of data—graphic information such as 
distances and angles between objects as well as precise areas and the properties of objects. 
However, as you become more experienced with AutoCAD, you’ll also need data of a different 
nature. For example, as you begin to work in groups, the various settings in a drawing become 
important. You’ll need statistics on the amount of time that you spend on a drawing when 
you’re billing computer time. As your projects become more complex, file maintenance requires 
a greater degree of attention. To take full advantage of AutoCAD, you’ll want to exchange infor-
mation about your drawing with other people and other programs.
In this chapter, you’ll explore the ways in which all types of data can be extracted from 
AutoCAD and made available to you, to your co-workers, and to other programs. First, you’ll 
learn how to obtain specific data about your drawings. Then, you’ll look at ways to exchange 
data with other programs, such as word processors, desktop publishing software, and even 
other CAD programs.
In this chapter, you will learn to

Finding the Area of Closed Boundaries
One of the most frequently sought pieces of data that you can extract from an AutoCAD draw-
ing is the area of a closed boundary. In architecture, you often need to find the area of a room  
or the footprint of a building. In civil engineering, you may want to determine the area covered 
by the boundary of a property line or the area of cut for a roadway. In the following sections, 
you’ll learn how to use AutoCAD to obtain exact area information from your drawings.

Finding the Area of an Object
Architects, engineers, and facilities planners often need to know the square footage of a room 
or a section of a building. A structural engineer might want to find the cross-sectional area of a 
beam. In this section, you’ll practice determining the areas of regular objects.
First, you’ll determine the square-footage area of the living room and entry of your studio 
unit plan:
	
1.	 Start AutoCAD. Open the Unit.dwg file that you created in a previous chapter, or use the 
19a-unit.dwg file.
	
2.	 Zoom into the living room and entry area so that you have a view similar to Figure 19.1.

3.	 On the Home tab’s Utilities panel, click the Area tool on the Measure flyout, or type 
MEA↵AR↵ at the Command prompt. This starts the Measuregeom command with the 
Area option.

4.	 Using the Endpoint osnap, start with the lower-left corner of the living room and select 
the points shown in Figure 19.1. You’re indicating the boundary. Notice that as you click 
points, the area being calculated is indicated in green.
	
5.	 When you’ve come to the eighth point shown in Figure 19.1, press ↵. You’ll see the follow-
ing message:
Area = 39570.00 square in. (274.7917 square ft), Perimeter = 76′-0″
	
6.	 Type X↵ to exit the Measuregeom command.
The number of points that you can pick to define an area is limitless, which means that you 
can obtain the areas of complex shapes.
Find the Coordinate of a Point or a Distance in a Drawing
To find absolute coordinates in a drawing, use the ID command. Click the ID Point tool on the Home 
tab’s expanded Utilities panel, or type ID↵. At the Specify point: prompt, use the osnap overrides 
to pick a point; its x-, y-, and z-coordinates are displayed on the command line.
To find the distance between two points, choose Distance from the Measure flyout on the Home tab’s 
Utilities panel, or type Dist↵ and then click two points. AutoCAD will display the distance in the draw-
ing as Delta X, Delta Y, and Delta Z coordinates and as a direct distance between the selected points. 
Angle information is also provided. The distance is also displayed in the command line.
Using Hatch Patterns to Find Areas
Hatch patterns are used primarily to add graphics to your drawing, but they can also serve as 
a means for finding areas. You can use any hatch pattern that you want to because you’re inter-
ested only in the area that it reports back to you. You can also set up a special layer devoted to 
area calculations and then add to this layer the hatch patterns that you use to find areas. That 
way, you can turn off the hatch patterns so that they don’t plot, or you can turn off the Plot set-
ting for that layer to ensure that it doesn’t appear in your final output.
To practice using hatch patterns to find an area, do the following:
	
1.	 Set the current layer to FLOOR.
	
2.	 Turn off the DOOR and FIXTURE layers. Also make sure that the CEILING layer is 
turned on. You want the hatch pattern to follow the interior wall outline, so you will need 
to turn off any objects that will affect the outline, such as the door and kitchen.
	
3.	 Click Hatch on the Home tab’s Draw panel, or type H↵ to open the Hatch Creation tab.

Measuring Boundaries That Have Gaps
If the area that you’re trying to measure has gaps, set the Gap Tolerance setting in the Hatch Creation 
tab’s expanded Options panel to a value higher than the size of the gaps.

634  | CHAPTER 19  Getting and Exchanging Data from Drawings    
	
4.	 At the Pick internal point or [Select objects/Undo/seTtings]: prompt, click in 
the interior of the unit plan. The outline of the interior is highlighted, and the pattern is 
placed in the plan (see Figure 19.2). You might also notice that before you click in the unit 
plan, you get a preview of the hatch.
Figure 19.2
After you click a 
point on the interior 
of the plan to place 
a hatch pattern, an 
outline of the area 
is highlighted by a 
dotted line and the 
hatch appears.
	
5.	 Press ↵ to complete the hatch.
	
6.	 On the Home tab’s Utilities panel, click the Area tool on the Measure flyout and then type 
O↵, or type MEA↵AR↵O↵ at the Command prompt.
	
7.	 Click the hatch pattern that you just created. Again, you get the following message:
Area = 39570.00 square in. (274.7917 square ft), Perimeter = 76′-0″
	
8.	 Press X↵ to exit the command.
If you need to recall the last area calculation value that you received, enter 
‘Setvar↵Area↵. The area is displayed in the prompt. Enter ‘Perimeter↵ to get the last 
perimeter calculated.
The Hatch command creates a hatch pattern that conforms to the boundary of an area. This 
feature, combined with the ability of the Measuregeom command to find the area of a hatch 
pattern, makes short work of area calculations. Another advantage of using hatch patterns is 
that, by default, hatch patterns avoid islands within the boundary of the area that you’re trying 
to find.

Finding the Area of Closed Boundaries |  635  
By using the Add and Subtract options of the Measuregeom command, you can maintain a 
running total of several separate areas being calculated, a capability that gives you flexibility in 
finding areas of complex shapes. This section guides you through the use of these options.
For the following exercise, you’ll use a flange shape that contains circles. This shape is com-
posed of simple arcs, lines, and circles. Use these steps to see how you can keep a running tally 
of areas:
	
1.	 Exit the Unit.dwg file, and open the file Flange.dwg (see Figure 19.3). Don’t bother to save 
changes in the Unit.dwg file.
	
2.	 Select Boundary from the Hatch flyout on the Home tab’s Draw panel, or type BO↵ to 
open the Boundary Creation dialog box (see Figure 19.4).
	
3.	 Click the Pick Points icon.
The Properties palette also reports the area of a hatch pattern. Select the hatch pattern whose 
area you want to find, and then right-click and select Properties. Scroll down to the bottom of 
the Geometry group and you’ll see the Area listing for the hatch pattern that you selected. You 
can select more than one hatch pattern and find the cumulative area of the selected hatch pat-
terns in the Properties palette.
Adding and Subtracting Areas with the Area Command
Hatch patterns work extremely well for finding areas, but if you find that you can’t use hatch 
patterns for some reason, you have an alternative. You can still use a command called Boundary 
to generate a polyline outline of an enclosed boundary and then obtain the area of the outline 
using the Measuregeom command (Measure on the Home tab’s Utilities panel). If islands are 
present within the boundary, you have to use the Subtract feature of the Measuregeom com-
mand to remove their area from the overall boundary area. In this section, you’ll use the exam-
ple of the flange part, which contains two islands in the form of the two circles, at the lower end 
(see Figure 19.3).

4.	 Click in the interior of the flange shape. The entire shape is highlighted, including the 
circle islands.
	
5.	 Press ↵. You now have a polyline outline of the shape and the circles, although it won’t 
be obvious that polylines have been created because they’re drawn over the boundary 
objects.
	
6.	 Continue by using the Measuregeom command’s Add and Subtract options. Select Area 
from the Measure flyout on the Home tab’s Utilities panel.
	
7.	 Type A↵ to enter Add Area mode, and then type O↵ to select an object.
	
8.	 Click a vertical edge of the flange outline. If Selection Cycling is on, you will see a pop-up 
asking you what type of object you want to select. Choose Polyline. You see the selected 
area highlighted in green, and the following message appears in the Command window:
Area = 27.7080, Perimeter = 30.8496
Total area = 27.7080
	
9.	 Press ↵ to exit Add Area mode.
	
10.	 Type S↵ to enter Subtract Area mode, and then type O↵ to select an object.
	
11.	 Click one of the circles. You see the following message:
Total area = 0.6070, Circumference = 2.7618
Total area = 27.1010
This shows you the area and perimeter of the selected object and a running count of the 
total area of the flange outline minus the circle. You also see the area of the subtracted 
circle change to a different color so that you can distinguish between the calculated area 
and the subtracted area.
	
12.	 Click the other circle. You see the following message:
Total area = 0.6070, Circumference = 2.7618
Total area = 26.4940
Figure 19.4
The Boundary Creation 
dialog box

Finding the Area of Closed Boundaries |  637  
Again, you see a listing of the area and circumference of the selected object along with a 
running count of the total area, which now shows a value of 26.4940. This last value is the 
true area of the flange.
	
13.	 Press ↵ and type X↵X↵ to exit the Measuregeom command. You can also press the Esc 
key to exit the command.
In this exercise, you first selected the main object outline and then subtracted the island 
objects. You don’t have to follow this order; you can start by subtracting areas to get negative 
area values and then add other areas to come up with a total. You can also alternate between 
Add and Subtract modes, in case you forget to add or subtract areas.
You may have noticed that the Measuregeom Command prompt offered Specify first 
corner point or [Object/Add area/Subtract area/eXit]: as the default option for both the 
Add Area and Subtract Area modes. Instead of using the Object option to pick the circles, you can 
start selecting points to indicate a rectangular area as you did in the first exercise in this chapter.
Whenever you press ↵ while selecting points for an area calculation, AutoCAD automatically 
connects the first and last points and returns the calculated area. If you’re in Add or Subtract 
mode, you can then continue to select points, but the additional areas are calculated from the 
next point that you pick.
As you can see from these exercises, it’s simpler to outline an area first with a polyline wher-
ever possible and then use the Object option to add and subtract area values of polylines.
In this example, you obtained the area of a mechanical object. However, the same process 
works for any type of area that you want to calculate. It can be the area of a piece of property on a 
topographical map or the area of a floor plan. For example, you can use the Object option to find 
the area of an irregular shape, such as the one shown in Figure 19.5, as long as it’s a closed polyline.
Figure 19.5
The site plan with 
an area to be 
calculated
Irregular areas like the area between contours can be
easily calculated using the Boundary and Area commands.

638  | CHAPTER 19  Getting and Exchanging Data from Drawings    
When issued through the keyboard as MEA↵, the Measuregeom command offers a number 
of other options for measuring your drawing. The options appear in the Command window 
as [Distance/Radius/Angle/ARea/Volume]<Distance> or at the cursor as a Dynamic Input 
option. These options are automatically selected when you click the related tool from the 
Measure flyout on the Utilities panel. Remember that to use an option, you must type the capi-
talized letter or letters of the option shown in the list. Table 19.1 gives you descriptions of the 
options and how they are used.

Recording Area Data in a Drawing File
In just about every project we’ve worked on, area calculations were an important part of the drawing 
process. As an aid in recording area calculations, we created a block that contains attributes for the 
room number, the room area, and the date when the room area was last measured. The area and date 
attributes were made invisible so that only the room number appears. The block with the attribute is 
then inserted into every room. Once the area of the room is discovered, it can be added to the block 
attribute with the Ddatte command. Such a block can be used with any drawing in which area data 
needs to be gathered and stored. See Chapter 12, “Using Attributes,” for more on attributes. You can 
also use the Field object type to display the area of a polyline automatically as a text object. See Chap­
ter 10, “Using Fields and Tables,” for more on fields.
Getting General Information
So far in this book, you’ve seen how to get data about the geometry of your drawings. AutoCAD 
also includes a set of tools that you can use to access the general state of your drawings. You can 
gather information about the status of current settings in a file or the time at which a drawing 
was created and last edited.

Getting General Information |  639  
In the following sections, you’ll practice extracting this type of information from your 
drawing.
Determining the Drawing’s Status
When you work with a group of people on a large project, keeping track of a drawing’s setup 
becomes crucial. You can use the Status command to obtain general information about the 
drawing on which you’re working, such as the base point, current mode settings, and workspace 
or computer memory use. The Status command is especially helpful when you’re editing a 
drawing on which someone else has worked, because you may want to identify and change set-
tings for your own style of working. Select Application ➢ Drawing Utilities ➢ Status to display 
a list like the one shown in Figure 19.6. Note that you may see the Press ENTER to continue: 
prompt to display all of the data from the Status command.

Use the Status Command to Get Your Bearings
If you have problems editing a file created by someone else, the difficulty can often be attributed to a 
setting with which you are unfamiliar. If AutoCAD is acting in an unusual way, use the Status com-
mand to get a quick glimpse of the file settings before you start calling for help.

640  | CHAPTER 19  Getting and Exchanging Data from Drawings    
Here is a brief description of each item on the Status command’s display in the expanded 
command line. Note that some of the items that you see on the screen will vary somewhat from 
what we’ve shown here, but the information applies to virtually all situations except where 
noted:
Number Objects In Drive:\Folder\Subfolder\Name.dwg    The number of entities or 
objects in the drawing.
Undo File Size    The size of the Undo file located in the user temp folder.
Model Space Limits Are    The coordinates of the model space limits. It also indicates 
whether limits are turned off or on. (See Chapter 3, “Setting Up and Using the Drafting 
Tools,” for more details on limits.)
Model Space Uses    The area the drawing occupies; equivalent to the extents of the drawing.
**Over    If present, this means that part of the drawing is outside the limit boundary.
Display Shows    The area covered by the current view.
Insertion Base Is, Snap Resolution Is, and Grid Spacing Is    The current default values for 
these mode settings.
Current Space    Model space or paper space.
Current Layout    The current tab.
Current Layer    The current layer.
Current Color    The color assigned to new objects.
Current Linetype    The linetype assigned to new objects.
Current Material    The material assigned to new objects.
Current Lineweight    The current default lineweight setting.
Current Elevation/Thickness    The current default z-coordinate for new objects plus the 
default thickness of objects. These are both 3D-related settings. (See Chapter 20, “Creating 3D 
Drawings,” for details.)
Fill, Grid, Ortho, Qtext, Snap, and Tablet    The status of these options.
Object Snap Modes    The current active osnap setting.
Free Dwg Disk (Drive:) Space    The amount of space available to store drawing-specific tem-
porary files.
Free Temp Disk (Drive:) Space    The amount of space left on your hard drive for the 
AutoCAD resource temporary files.
Free Physical Memory    The amount of free RAM available.
Free Swap File Space    The amount of Windows swap-file space available.
When you’re in paper space, the Status command displays information regarding the paper 
space limits. See Chapter 15, “Laying Out Your Printer Output,” for more on model space and 
paper space.
In addition to being useful in understanding a drawing file, the Status command is an 
invaluable tool for troubleshooting. Frequently, a technical support person can isolate problems 
by using the information provided by the Status command.

Getting General Information |  641  
Keeping Track of Time
The Time command enables you to keep track of the time spent on a drawing for billing or 
analysis purposes. You can also use the Time command to check the current time and find out 
when the drawing was created and most recently edited. Because the AutoCAD timer uses your 
computer’s time, be sure the time is set correctly in Windows.
To access the Time command, enter Time↵ at the Command prompt. You get a message like 
the one shown in Figure 19.7.
The first four lines of this message tell you the current date and time, the date and time the 
drawing was created, and the last time the drawing was saved.
Figure 19.7
The Time screen 
in the AutoCAD 
command-line 
interface
The fifth line shows the total time spent on the drawing from the point at which the file was 
opened. This elapsed timer lets you time a particular activity, such as changing the width of all 
of the walls in a floor plan or redesigning a piece of machinery. The last line tells you the tim-
ing of the next automatic save.
You can turn the elapsed timer on or off or reset it by entering ON, OFF, or Reset at the 
prompt shown at the bottom of the message, or you can press ↵ to exit the Time command.
Getting Information from System Variables
If you’ve been working through this book’s ongoing studio apartment building exercise, you’ll 
have noticed that we’ve occasionally mentioned a system variable in conjunction with a com-
mand. You can check the status or change the setting of any system variable while you’re in the 
middle of another command. To do this, you type an apostrophe (‘) followed by the name of the 
system variable at the Command prompt.
For example, if you start to draw a line and suddenly decide that you need to restrict your 
cursor movement to 45°, you can do the following:
	
1.	 At the Specify next point or [Undo]: prompt, enter ‘snapang.
	
2.	 At the >>Enter new value for SNAPANG <0>: prompt, enter a new cursor angle. You’re 
returned to the Line command with the cursor in its new orientation.
You can also recall information such as the last area or distance calculated by AutoCAD. 
Type ‘Setvar↵Area↵ to read the last area calculation. The Setvar command also lets you list all 

642  | CHAPTER 19  Getting and Exchanging Data from Drawings    
of the system variables and their status as well as access each system variable individually by 
entering ‘Setvar↵?↵. You can then indicate which variables to list using wildcard characters 
such as the asterisk or question mark. For example, you can enter g*↵ to list all the system vari-
ables that start with the letter G.
Many system variables give you direct access to detailed information about your drawing. 
They also let you fine-tune your drawing and editing activities. In the Bonus Chapter 4, “System 
Variables and Dimension Styles,” available at www.omura.com/chapters, you’ll find all the 
information that you need to familiarize yourself with the system variables. Don’t feel that you 
have to memorize them all at once; just be aware that they’re available.
Keeping a Log of Your Activity
At times, you may find it helpful to keep a log of your activity in an AutoCAD session. A log 
is a text file containing a record of your activities. It can also contain notes to yourself or oth-
ers about how a drawing is set up. Such a log can help you determine how frequently you use 
a particular command, or it can help you construct a macro for a commonly used sequence of 
commands.
The following exercise demonstrates how to save and view a detailed record of an AutoCAD 
session by using the Log feature:
	
1.	 Press the Esc key to cancel any current commands and then choose Options from the 
Application menu to open the Options dialog box. Click the Open And Save tab. A new 
set of options appears.
	
2.	 In the File Safety Precautions group, click the Maintain A Log File check box and then 
click OK.
	
3.	 Type Status↵ at the Command prompt.
	
4.	 Return to the Open And Save tab of the Options dialog box, and deselect the Maintain A 
Log File option.
	
5.	 Click OK to exit the dialog box.
	
6.	 Switch to Windows, and start the Notepad application or any text editor.
	
7.	 With the text editor, open the log file whose name starts with Flange in the folder listed 
here:
C:\Users\<i>User Name</i>\AppData\Local\Autodesk\AutoCAD 2017\R21.0\enu\
This file stores the text data from the command line whenever the Log File option is 
turned on. You must turn off the Log File option before you can view this file. When 
you’re attempting to view the log file using Windows Notepad, make sure that you set 
Files Of Type in the Notepad Open dialog box to All Files. Note that this location is usu-
ally a hidden one. See the section “Finding Folders That Contain AutoCAD Files” in 
Appendix B, “Installing and Setting Up AutoCAD,” for more information.
You can quickly turn the Maintain A Log File feature on and off by typing Logfileon↵ and 
Logfileoff↵, respectively, at the Command prompt. As you can see in step 7, the log file is given 
the name of the drawing file from which the log is derived, with some additional numeric val-
ues. Because the Flange.dwg log file is a standard text file, you can easily send it to other mem-
bers of your workgroup or print it for a permanent record.

Capturing and Saving Text Data from the AutoCAD Text Window
If you’re working in groups, it’s often helpful to have a record of the status, editing time, and 
system variables for particular files readily available to other group members. It’s also conve-
nient to keep records of block and layer information so that you can see whether a specific block 
is included in a drawing or what layers are normally on or off.
You can use the Windows Clipboard to capture and save such data from the AutoCAD Text 
Window. The following steps show you how it’s done:
	
1.	 Move the arrow cursor to the Command prompt at the bottom of the AutoCAD Text 
Window. If the Text Window isn’t open, enter TEXTSCR↵.
	
2.	 Right-click and choose Copy History from the context menu to copy the contents of the 
AutoCAD Text Window to the Clipboard.
	
3.	 Open Notepad or another text-editing application and paste the information.
Finding the Log File
If you can’t find the log file for the current drawing, you can enter logfilename↵ at the Command 
prompt and AutoCAD will display the filename, including the full path. If you want to change the 
default location for the log file, open the Options dialog box and click the Files tab. Click the plus sign 
to the left of the Log File Location option in the list box. A listing appears showing you where the 
drawing log file is stored. You can then modify this setting to indicate a new location. Users of the 
AutoCAD LT® software should enter Modemacro↵ and then $(getvar, logfilepath).
Enabling the Function Keys
On some keyboards, the function keys, F1 through F12, serve a dual function. For example, on most 
laptops, you can use the Fn key to select an alternate function for the function keys, like toggling Wi-Fi 
on or off or switching to an external monitor. If you find that the F2 key on your PC is not expanding 
the AutoCAD command-line interface, make sure that you have disabled the special features of the 
function keys. There may be an F Lock or F Mode key near the row of function keys that performs 
this function.
If you want to copy only a portion of the command-line data to the Clipboard, perform the 
following steps:
	
1.	 Press the F2 function key to expand the command-line interface.
	
2.	 Using the I-beam text cursor, highlight the text that you want to copy to the Clipboard.
	
3.	 Right-click and choose Copy from the context menu, or you can press Ctrl+C. The high-
lighted text is copied to the Clipboard.
	
4.	 Open Notepad or another text-editing application and paste the information.
The context menu that appears in step 3 also appears when you right-click in the command 
window. Items copied to the Clipboard from the command-line interface or the AutoCAD Text 
Window can be pasted into dialog box text boxes. This can be a quick way to transfer layers, 

644  | CHAPTER 19  Getting and Exchanging Data from Drawings    
linetypes, or other named items into dialog boxes. You can even paste text into the drawing 
area.
Understanding the Command Window Context Menu
You may notice other options on the command window or text window context menu: Recent 
Commands, Input Settings, Copy History, Paste, Paste To CmdLine, and Options. Choosing 
Recent Commands displays a list of the most recent commands. For most activities, you’ll use 
a handful of commands repeatedly; the Recent Commands option can save you time by giv-
ing you a shortcut to those commands that you use the most. The Input Settings option offers 
a flyout menu with additional options (see Table 19.2). These options can be switched on or off. 
Options that show a check mark are “on.” You can also find these option settings in the Input 
Search Options dialog box, which you can open by typing Inputsearchoptions↵.
Table 19.2:

The Paste to CmdLine options paste the first line of the contents of the Clipboard into the 
command line or text box of a dialog box. This can be useful for entering repetitive text or for 
storing and retrieving a frequently used command. Choosing Options opens the Display tab of 
the Options dialog box. (See Appendix B for more on the Options dialog box.)
Storing Searchable Information in AutoCAD Files
As you start to build a library of AutoCAD files, you’ll have to decide how to manage them. 
Keeping track of AutoCAD files can be a daunting task. Most AutoCAD users start to name files 
by their job number to keep things organized. But even the best organization schemes don’t help 
if you need to find that one special file among thousands of files in your library. In this section, 
you’ll learn how to include information in an AutoCAD file that you can use later to locate the 
file with the Windows Search utility.
AutoCAD includes the DesignCenter™ and Content Explorer™ tools, which can help you 
locate a file more easily based on a keyword or description. Chapter 25, “Managing and Sharing 
Your Drawings,” provides a complete discussion of DesignCenter and Content Explorer.

Getting General Information |  645  
To add general, searchable information about your drawing file, use the drawing’s Properties 
dialog box (see Figure 19.8). Choose Drawing Utilities ➢ Drawing Properties from the 
Application menu.
Figure 19.8
A drawing’s properties
Here are descriptions of the four tabs in this dialog box:
General    The General tab gives you general information about the file. This information is 
similar to what you see if you use the Properties options in Windows File Explorer to view 
the properties of a file.
Summary    In the Summary tab, enter any text in the Title, Subject, Author, and Keywords 
fields that is appropriate to the drawing. The information you enter here is stored with the 
drawing, and it can be used to locate the file through the AutoCAD DesignCenter or the 
Windows Search utility.
In addition, you can enter a base location for hyperlinks that are applied to objects in your 
drawing. This base location can be a folder on your computer or network or an Internet web 
address. See Chapter 25 for more information on hyperlinks.
Statistics    The Statistics tab contains the Windows username of the person who last saved 
the drawing as well as the time spent on the file. The username is the name used to log in  
at the beginning of the Windows session.
Custom    The Custom tab contains two columns of text boxes. This tab lets you store addi-
tional custom data with the drawing that is also searchable. For example, you might enter 
Job Number in the Name column and then enter 9901 in the Value column. You might also 

646  | CHAPTER 19  Getting and Exchanging Data from Drawings    
This option opens a Find dialog box that works just like the Windows Search Results 
window.
Recovering Corrupted Files
No system is perfect. Eventually, you’ll encounter a file that is corrupted in some way. Two 
AutoCAD tools can frequently salvage a corrupted file:
Audit    Enables you to check a file that you can open but suspect has a problem. Audit 
checks the currently opened file for errors and displays the results in the command-line 
interface.
Recover/Recover With Xrefs    Enables you to open a file that is so badly corrupted that 
AutoCAD is unable to open it in a normal way. A Select File dialog box appears in which 
you select a file for recovery. After you select a file, it’s opened and checked for errors. The 
Recover With Xrefs option will attempt to recover the file and any attached Xrefs.
You can access these tools from the Drawing Utilities option on the Application menu. More 
often than not, these tools will do the job, although they aren’t a panacea for all file corruption 
problems. In the event that you can’t recover a file even with these tools, make sure that your 
computer is running smoothly and that other systems aren’t faulty.
If for some reason your computer shuts down while you’re in the middle of editing a file, 
you’ll see the Drawing Recovery Manager the next time you start AutoCAD. The Drawing 
Recovery Manager lets you recover the file on which you were working when AutoCAD unex-
pectedly shut down. This feature works just like the file recovery feature in Microsoft Office: A 
panel appears to the left of the AutoCAD Text Window showing you a list of recoverable files. 
You can then select the filename from the panel to open the file. You can open the Drawing 
Recovery Manager by choosing Application ➢ Drawing Utilities ➢ Open The Drawing Recovery 
Manager.
include information such as project manager names, consultants, or revision numbers. You 
can then locate the file by using the AutoCAD DesignCenter or the Windows Search utility to 
search for those keywords from the Name and Value columns.
Searching for AutoCAD Files
After you’ve included information in a file’s Properties palette, you can use the AutoCAD 
DesignCenter, the Content Explorer, the File dialog box, or the Windows Search function to 
locate your file.
A Find option is also located in the Tools menu in the upper-right corner of the AutoCAD 
Select File dialog box. To access it, click the Open tool from the Quick Access toolbar; then, in  
the Select File dialog box, choose Tools ➢ Find.

Using the DXF File Format to Exchange CAD Data with Other Programs |  647  
Using the DXF File Format to Exchange CAD Data with 
Other Programs
AutoCAD offers many ways to share data with other programs. Perhaps the most common type 
of data exchange is to share drawing data with other CAD programs. In the following sections, 
you’ll see how to export and import CAD drawings using the DXF file format.
A Drawing Interchange Format (DXF) file is a plain-text file that contains all the information 
needed to reconstruct a drawing. It’s often used to exchange drawings created with other pro-
grams. Many CAD and technical drawing programs, including some 3D programs, can gener-
ate or read files in DXF format. You might want to use a 3D program to view your drawing in 
a perspective view, or you might have a consultant who uses a different CAD program that 
accepts DXF files.
Be aware that not all programs that read DXF files accept all the data stored therein. 
Many programs that claim to read DXF files throw away much of the DXF files’ information. 
Attributes are perhaps the most commonly ignored objects, followed by many of the 3D objects, 
such as meshes and 3D faces.
Exporting DXF Files
To export your current drawing as a DXF file, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Choose Save As from the Application menu or from the Quick Access toolbar to open the 
Save Drawing As dialog box.
	
2.	 Click the Files Of Type drop-down list. You can export your drawing under a number of 
formats, including six DXF formats.
	
3.	 Select the appropriate DXF format, and then enter a name for your file. You don’t have to 
include the .dxf filename extension.
	
4.	 Select a folder for the file and click Save.
In step 3, you can select from the following DXF file formats:
◆
◆
AutoCAD 2013 DXF
◆
◆
AutoCAD 2010/LT 2010 DXF (AutoCAD 2010, 2011, and 2012 share file formats)

648  | CHAPTER 19  Getting and Exchanging Data from Drawings    
◆
◆
AutoCAD 2007/LT 2007 DXF (AutoCAD 2007, 2008, and 2009 share file formats)
◆
◆
AutoCAD 2004/LT 2004 DXF
◆
◆
AutoCAD 2000/LT 2000 DXF
◆
◆
AutoCAD R12/LT2 DXF
Choose the appropriate format for the program to which you’re exporting. In most cases, the 
safest choice is AutoCAD R12/LT2 DXF if you’re exporting to another CAD program, although 
AutoCAD won’t maintain the complete functionality of AutoCAD 2017 for such files.
After you’ve selected a DXF format from the Files Of Type drop-down list, you can set 
more detailed specifications by choosing Tools ➢ Options in the upper-right corner of the Save 
Drawing As dialog box. Doing so opens the Saveas Options dialog box. For DXF files, select the 
DXF Options tab (see Figure 19.9).
Figure 19.9
The Saveas Options dia-
log box open to the DXF 
Options tab
The DXF Options tab contains the following options:
Format    Lets you choose between ASCII (plain-text) and binary file formats. Most other pro-
grams accept ASCII, so it’s the safest choice. Some programs accept binary DXF files, which 
have the advantage of being more compact than the ASCII format files.
Select Objects    Lets you select specific objects in the drawing for export. You can select 
objects after you close the Saveas Options dialog box and choose Save from the Save Drawing 
As dialog box.
Decimal Places Of Accuracy (0 To 16)    Enables you to determine the accuracy of the 
exported file. Keeping this value low helps to reduce the size of the exported file, particu-
larly if it’s to be in ASCII format. Some CAD programs don’t support the high accuracy of 
AutoCAD, so using a high value here may have no significance.
In addition to using the Save Drawing As tool, you can type Dxfout↵ at the Command 
prompt to open the Save Drawing As dialog box. This is a standard Windows file dialog box 
that includes the Options button described in the next section.

Using the DXF File Format to Exchange CAD Data with Other Programs |  649  
Opening or Importing DXF Files
Some offices have made the DXF file format their standard for CAD drawings. This is most com-
monly seen in offices that use a variety of CAD software besides AutoCAD.
AutoCAD can be set up to read and write DXF files instead of the standard DWG file format 
by default. Here’s how it’s done:
	
1.	 Choose Options from the Application menu to open the Options dialog box.
	
2.	 Select the Open And Save tab.
	
3.	 In the File Save group, select any of the DXF formats from the Save As drop-down list.
	
4.	 Click OK.
After you do this, all your drawings are automatically saved in the DXF format of your choice.
You can also set the default AutoCAD file type by clicking the Tools button in the Save 
Drawing As dialog box and clicking Options. As you saw in the preceding section, the Saveas 
Options dialog box includes the DWG Options tab (see Figure 19.10). You can select a default file 
type from the Save All Drawings As drop-down list.
Figure 19.10
The Saveas Options 
dialog box open to 
the DWG Options 
tab
If you need to open a DXF file only once in a while, you can do so by selecting DXF from the 
Files Of Type drop-down list in the Select File dialog box. This is the dialog box that you see 
when you click Open on the Quick Access toolbar. You can also use the Dxfin command:
	
1.	 Type Dxfin↵ at the Command prompt to open the Select File dialog box.
	
2.	 Locate and select the DXF file that you want to import.
	
3.	 Double-click the filename. If the drawing is large, the imported file may take several 
minutes to open.
If you want to import a DXF file into the current drawing, you can use the Insert dialog box. 
(Click Insert on the Home tab’s Block panel.) Click the Browse button to locate and select a file. 
Make sure that the Files Of Type option is set to DXF.

650  | CHAPTER 19  Getting and Exchanging Data from Drawings    
Using AutoCAD Drawings in Page Layout Programs
As you probably know, AutoCAD is a natural for creating line art, and because of its popular-
ity, most page layout programs are designed to import AutoCAD drawings in one form or 
another. Those of you who employ page layout software to generate user manuals or other 
technical documents will probably want to use AutoCAD drawings in your work. In this  
section, you’ll examine ways to output AutoCAD drawings to formats that most page layout 
programs can accept.
You can export AutoCAD files to page layout software formats in two ways: by using raster 
export and by using vector file export.
Exporting Raster Files
In some cases, you may need only a rough image of your AutoCAD drawing. You can export 
your drawing as a raster file that can be read in virtually any page layout or word process-
ing program. To do this, you need to use the PublishToWebJPG.pc3 or PublishToWebPNG.pc3 
printer option that comes with AutoCAD, as shown in these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Plot tool on the Quick Access toolbar.
	
2.	 In the Printer/Plotter group of the Plot dialog box, select PublishToWebJPG.pc3 or 
PublishToWebPNG.pc3 from the Name drop-down list.
	
3.	 The first time that you use this printer option, you’ll see the Plot – Paper Size Not Found 
dialog box. Select from the options presented in the dialog box.
	
4.	 Back in the Plot dialog box, you can select a size in pixels for your image file from the 
Paper Size drop-down list.
	
5.	 Click OK to create the image file.
	
6.	 In the Browse For Plot File dialog box, select a location for your file and click Save.
If you don’t see a “paper size” that you want to use, you can create a custom size using the 
Properties button in the Plot dialog box:
	
1.	 Follow the steps in the previous exercise, but at step 5, instead of clicking OK, click the 
Properties button to the right of the Printer/Plotter group’s Name drop-down list. The 
Plotter Configuration Editor dialog box appears (see Figure 19.11).
	
2.	 Click Custom Paper Sizes in the large list box at the top of the dialog box. The options 
change in the lower half of the dialog box.
	
3.	 Click the Add button to start the Custom Paper Size Wizard.
	
4.	 Click the Start From Scratch radio button, and then click Next to open the Media Bounds 
screen.
	
5.	 Enter a height and width in pixels for your image file, and then click Next to open the 
Paper Size Name screen. Enter a name that best describes the size of the image file, and 
click Next to open the File Name screen.
	
6.	 On the Finish screen, click Finish. The Plotter Configuration Editor dialog box reappears. 
Click OK.

Using AutoCAD Drawings in Page Layout Programs |  651  
You can edit these settings at any time by opening the PC3 file in the AppData\Roaming\
Autodesk\AutoCAD 2017\R21\enu\Plotters subfolder of your profile folder. You can access 
this file through Windows File Explorer or from AutoCAD by clicking Plotter Manager in the 
Output tab’s Plot panel.
Figure 19.11
Editing the plotter 
configuration
Finding the AppData or Application Data Folder
The AppData or Application Data folder is typically a hidden folder. To get to it, you have to turn 
off the “hide hidden folders” feature of Windows File Explorer. See “Finding Folders That Contain 
AutoCAD Files” in Appendix B for more information.
To create a raster file version of your drawing, click Plot on the Quick Access toolbar. Then, 
in the Plot dialog box, select your raster file plotter configuration from the Name drop-down list of 
the Printer/Plotter group. You can then proceed to plot your drawing, but instead of paper output, 
you’ll get a raster file. You can specify the filename and location when you click OK to plot the file.
If you need to make changes to your raster file configuration, click Plotter Manager in the Output 
tab’s Plot panel. Then, in the Plotters window, double-click your raster file configuration file. You’ll 
see the same Plotter Configuration Editor that you used to set up the raster plotter configuration.
You can set up a different plotter configuration for each type of raster file that you use. You 
can also set up plotter configurations for different resolutions if you choose. To learn more about 
plotting in general, see Chapter 8, “Introducing Printing, Plotting, and Layouts.” Bonus Chap­
ter 3, “Hardware and Software Tips,” available at www.omura.com/chapters, provides detailed 
information on the Plotter Configuration Editor.

652  | CHAPTER 19  Getting and Exchanging Data from Drawings    
Exchanging Files with Earlier Releases
One persistent dilemma that has plagued AutoCAD users is how to exchange files between earlier ver-
sions of the program. In the early days of CAD, if you upgraded AutoCAD, you were locked out from 
exchanging your drawings with people using earlier versions.
With Release 13, the file structure was changed radically from the file structure used in earlier versions 
of AutoCAD. Then, AutoCAD 14 made it possible to exchange files freely between Releases 13 and 14.
With a change in release numbering, starting with AutoCAD 2000, file formats have typically been used 
for three releases in a row. AutoCAD 2000 through 2002 files are compatible, as are 2004 through 2006. 
If you open the Save Drawing As dialog box and check the Files Of Type drop-down list, you’ll see that 
R14, 2000, 2004, 2007, 2010, and 2013 are listed as options (AutoCAD 2017 uses the AutoCAD 2013 file 
format). Release numbers that are skipped in the list are compatible with only the next higher release. 
For example, if you want to save a file in a format that your colleague using AutoCAD 2005 can open, you 
would choose AutoCAD 2004 from the Files Of Type drop-down list. AutoCAD 2004 is a format compat-
ible with AutoCAD releases 2004, 2005, and 2006. If compatibility with earlier releases is important, 
you can set the default behavior to save as AutoCAD 2010 format or earlier. Or, if you’re willing to work 
with DXF files, you can set up AutoCAD 2017 to save drawings automatically as AutoCAD 2013 DXF files.
To set up AutoCAD to save drawings in the format used by an earlier version automatically, use the 
Options dialog box to set the default file type as described earlier in the section “Opening or Importing 
DXF Files.” However, rather than selecting a DXF file type, select the DWG file type that you want to use.
If you want to batch-convert multiple files to an earlier version, AutoCAD offers the DWG Convert 
dialog box. You can open this dialog box by typing DWGCONVERT↵ at the Command prompt. The 
DWG Convert dialog box enables you to create and save a list of files to convert in case you have a set 
of files that you need to down-convert often.

Select the Conversion Setups option in the dialog box to open the Conversion Setups dialog box. This 
dialog box lets you create or modify conversion setup presets to customize your most frequently used 
conversion methods.
Click New, or Modify, to create a new conversion preset option or to modify an existing one. You will 
see the New Conversion Setup or Modify Conversion Setup dialog box, either of which lets you set the 
parameters for your conversion setup.
Another option is to use a separate program to “downgrade” drawings to earlier versions. Autodesk 
offers its DWG TrueView™ software as a free download. DWG TrueView will batch-convert 2017 files to 
earlier versions, and it works in a way that is similar to the DWG Convert dialog box. The advantage to 
DWG TrueView is that it is a stand-alone application, so you don’t need to have AutoCAD open to use it.

654  | CHAPTER 19  Getting and Exchanging Data from Drawings    
Exporting Vector Files
If you need to preserve the accuracy of your drawing or if you want to take advantage of 
TrueType or PostScript fonts, you can use the DXF, Windows Metafile (WMF), or PostScript vec-
tor format. You can also export to DGN and SAT file formats. Intergraph’s DGN format is popu-
lar in civil engineering, mapping, and other CAD applications. SAT is a 3D modeling format 
associated with ACIS.
For vector format files, DXF is the easiest to work with, and with TrueType support, DXF can 
preserve font information between AutoCAD and page layout programs that support the DXF 
format. The WMF format is also a commonly accepted file format for vector information, and it 
preserves TrueType fonts and lineweights used in your drawings.
PostScript is a raster/vector hybrid file format that AutoCAD supports. Unfortunately, 
AutoCAD dropped direct PostScript font support with Release 14. However, you can still use 
substitute fonts to stand in for PostScript fonts. These substitute fonts are converted to true 
PostScript fonts when AutoCAD exports the drawing. You don’t see the true results of  
your PostScript output until you print your drawing on a PostScript printer.
The DXF file export was covered in a previous section of this chapter, so the following sec-
tions will concentrate on the WMF and PostScript file formats.
Exchanging 3D Data with FBX
AutoCAD can export to the FBX file format, which is a platform-independent 3D authoring/ 
interchange format. FBX can be exported through the Application menu’s Export option. To import 
FBX files, choose Import from the Insert tab’s Import panel or type Import↵. Select FBX (*.fbx) from 
the Files Of Type drop-down menu.
WMF Output
The WMF file type is one of the most popular vector file formats in Windows. It can be opened 
and edited by most illustration programs, including CorelDRAW and Adobe Illustrator. Most 
word processing, database, and worksheet programs can also import WMF files. It’s a great 
option for AutoCAD file export because it preserves TrueType fonts and lineweight settings. You 
can export WMF files that preserve lineweights as well.
To export WMF files, do the following:
	
1.	 Select Export ➢ Other Formats from the Application menu to open the Export Data 
dialog box.
	
2.	 Enter a name and location for your WMF file, select Metafile (*.wmf) from the Files Of 
Type drop-down list, and then click Save. The dialog box closes, and you’re prompted to 
select objects.
	
3.	 Select the objects that you want to export to the WMF file and press ↵. The objects are 
saved to your WMF file.

Using AutoCAD Drawings in Page Layout Programs |  655  
PostScript Output
AutoCAD can export to the Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) file format. If you’re using AutoCAD 
2017, you can obtain PostScript output in two ways: You can choose Export ➢ Other Formats 
from the Application menu, or you can enter Psout↵ at the Command prompt. If you choose 
Export ➢ Other Formats, you can use the Files Of Type drop-down list in the Export Data dialog 
box to select Encapsulated PS. Another method is to install a PostScript printer driver and plot 
your drawing to an EPS file. If you’re an AutoCAD LT user, you can’t export to EPS by clicking 
Export; you must set up a PostScript plotter and use it to plot to a file.
To set up AutoCAD to plot your drawing to an EPS file, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click Plotter Manager in the Output tab’s Plot panel, and then, in the Plotters dialog box, 
double-click the Add-A-Plotter Wizard.
	
2.	 Choose Next on the Introduction Page screen.
	
3.	 On the Begin screen of the Add-A-Plotter Wizard, choose My Computer.
	
4.	 On the Plotter Model screen, select Adobe from the Manufacturers list and then select the 
appropriate PostScript level from the Models list.
	
5.	 Skip the Import PCP Or PC2 screen and the Ports screen.
	
6.	 Enter a name for your EPS output settings on the Plotter Name screen.
	
7.	 On the Finish screen, click the Finish button.
AutoCAD doesn’t preserve font information when creating EPS files from the printer option. 
It also produces larger files, especially if your drawing contains a lot of area fills and filled fonts. 
As an alternative to EPS, you can “plot” to an Adobe PDF file. EPS files can often be replaced 
by PDF files. When you get to the Plotter Model screen, select the Autodesk ePlot (PDF) option 
from the Manufacturers list. You can also use the full version of Adobe Acrobat or Acrobat 
Professional to produce PDF files from AutoCAD.
The HPGL plot-file format is another vector format that you can use to export your AutoCAD 
drawings. Use the method described earlier in the section “Exporting Raster Files” to add the 
HPGL plotter driver to your printer/plotter configuration.
Using AutoCAD DWF Files
The Autodesk DWF file format is another format that you can use to exchange drawing data with 
others. It offers features that are geared toward AutoCAD users. You can import DWF files as 
external references and, using a free DWF viewer, you can gather information about a drawing 
such as block information, attribute data, and distance measurements. See Chapter 25 for more 
on DWF.

656  | CHAPTER 19  Getting and Exchanging Data from Drawings    
When you paste data into your AutoCAD file using OLE, you can link it to the source file or 
you can embed it. If you link it to the source file, the pasted data is updated whenever the source 
file is modified. This is similar to an AutoCAD Xref file. (See Chapter 14, “Advanced Editing and 
Organizing,” for more on Xref files.) If you embed data, you’re pasting it into AutoCAD without 
linking it. You can still open the application associated with the data by double-clicking it, but 
the data is no longer associated with the source file. Importing files using OLE is similar to other 
cut-and-paste operations. First, cut the data from the source application. This could be Microsoft 
Excel or Microsoft Word. In AutoCAD, click Paste Special from the Paste flyout on the Home 
tab’s Clipboard panel to open the Paste Special dialog box (see Figure 19.12).
Click the Paste Link radio button to tell AutoCAD that you want this paste to be a link. 
Notice that the list of source types changes to show only one option. This option will depend  
on the source document. Click OK. You’re prompted to select an insertion point. Place the  
cursor in the location for the paste, and click. The imported data appears within the drawing. 
Depending on the type of data, it may appear in a bounding box. You can adjust the size of the 
bounding box to fit the scale of the drawing.
In addition to using the Paste Special tool, you can import an OLE object by clicking OLE 
Object in the Insert tab’s Data panel to open the Insert Object dialog box (see Figure 19.13).
Using OLE to Import Data
To import data from other applications, you use the Cut and Paste features found in virtu-
ally all Windows programs. You cut the data from the source document and then paste it into 
AutoCAD. Typically, you’ll want to paste data into AutoCAD in its native object format, but 
if you prefer, you can use a Windows feature called Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) to 
import files.
Finding the Copy and Paste Tools
There are several variations of the Copy and Paste tools in AutoCAD, so they have been combined into 
tools and flyouts on the Home tab’s Clipboard panel. The Paste flyout is in the large icon to the left, 
and the Copy Clip tool is to the right of the Paste flyout.

Using OLE to Import Data |  657  
Figure 19.12
Use Paste Special to 
link your data.
Figure 19.13
Inserting a new 
object
You can then select the type of object that you want to import from the Object Type list box. 
Two radio buttons to the left of the list box let you import an existing object or create a new 
object of the type listed in the list box. If you choose the Create New radio button, the application 
associated with the object type will start and open a new file. If you select the Create From File 
radio button (see Figure 19.14), the dialog box changes to show a filename and a Browse button.

658  | CHAPTER 19  Getting and Exchanging Data from Drawings    
You can then browse for an existing file to import. The Link check box lets you specify 
whether the imported file is to be linked and needs to be selected in order to use the Olelinks 
command described in the next section.
Editing OLE Links
After you’ve pasted an object with links, you can control the links by typing Olelinks↵ at the 
Command prompt. If there are no linked objects in the drawing, the Olelinks command does 
nothing; otherwise, it opens the Links dialog box (see Figure 19.15).
Figure 19.14
Inserting an existing 
object
Figure 19.15
Editing links
The options available in the Links dialog box are as follows:
Cancel/Close    Cancels the link between a pasted object and its source file. After you use 
this option, changes in the source file have no effect on the pasted object. This is similar to 
using the Bind option in the Xref command. This option changes to Close once any of the 
other options listed here are used.
Update Now    Updates an object’s link when the Manual option is selected.
Open Source    Opens the linked file in the application associated with the object and lets 
you edit it.

Using OLE to Import Data |  659  
Change Source    Lets you change the object’s link to a different file. When you select this 
option, AutoCAD opens the Change Link dialog box, where you can select another file of the 
same type. For example, if you’re editing the link to a sound file, the Change Link dialog box 
displays files with the .wav filename extension.
Break Link    Disconnects the link between the inserted data and the source document. The 
inserted data then becomes embedded rather than linked.
Automatic and Manual    Radio buttons that control whether linked objects are updated 
automatically or manually.
Importing Worksheets as AutoCAD Tables
Although it can be beneficial to import worksheets as linked OLE objects, you may prefer to 
import worksheets as AutoCAD entities. You may not need the direct link to the source material 
that OLE linking offers. The ability to edit the imported worksheet directly in AutoCAD may 
have a higher priority for you.
In Chapter 10, you saw how you can create tables in AutoCAD by using the Table tool. You 
can import an Excel worksheet as an AutoCAD table by using the AutoCAD Entities option in 
the Paste Special dialog box. By importing worksheets as tables, you have more control over the 
layout and appearance of the worksheet data.
Try the following exercise to see how you can create a table from a worksheet:
	
1.	 Open the Excel worksheet called 19a-plan.xls and highlight the door data, as shown in 
Figure 19.16.
Figure 19.16
The Excel worksheet
	
2.	 Press Ctrl+C to place a copy of the selected data into the Windows Clipboard, and then 
switch back to AutoCAD.
	
3.	 Click Paste Special from the Paste flyout on the Home tab’s Clipboard panel (see 
Figure 19.17) to open the Paste Special dialog box.
	
4.	 With the Paste radio button selected, select AutoCAD Entities from the list and click OK.
	
5.	 At the Specify insertion point or [paste as Text]: prompt, click a point in the 
lower-right area of the drawing. The worksheet data appears in the drawing as a table 
object (see Chapter 10 for more on tables).

660  | CHAPTER 19  Getting and Exchanging Data from Drawings    
	
6.	 Use the Scale tool to enlarge the table to a readable size (see Figure 19.18), and use the cor-
ner grips to adjust the width.
Figure 19.17
The Paste Special tool
Use AutoCAD SHX Fonts for Additional PDF features
If you frequently export your drawings to the PDF format, you’ll want to be aware that text format-
ted in an AutoCAD SHX font can be highlighted, copied, and searched as comments in a PDF viewer. 
SHX fonts can be recognized by their SHX file name extension when selecting fonts in the Text Style 
dialog box or by the “Caliper-A” icon in the Text Editor ribbon tab’s Formatting panel. See Chapter 9, 
“Adding Text to Drawings,” for more on text styles and fonts.
Figure 19.18
Scale and size the 
table.
	
7.	 Close the Excel file.
You can edit this imported worksheet using the editing methods for AutoCAD tables 
described in Chapter 10. In that chapter, you learned that you could edit the text format, the bor-
der lineweight and color, and the background of cells. You can add rows and columns and rotate 
text so that it fits more uniformly in a vertical column.
In this exercise, the worksheet was imported using the default standard table style. This gives 
you a simple-looking table using the TrueType Arial font. You can set up a custom table style 
with the fonts and borders that you want and then import the table for a more custom appear-
ance. Make sure that your custom table style is the current style before you import the worksheet.

Using OLE to Import Data |  661  
Understanding Options for Embedding Data
The Paste Special dialog box offers several other options that may better suit your needs. Here is 
a brief description of each format that is available:
Microsoft Document    Imports data from Microsoft Office documents. This option may 
show Word or Excel in the title, depending on the source. The pasted object will inherit the 
appearance of the source document. When using this option, you may receive a security 
warning message. Always make sure that your files are from a trusted source.
Picture (Metafile)    Imports the data as a vector or bitmap image, whichever is appropriate. 
If applicable, text is also maintained as text, although you can’t edit it in AutoCAD.
Bitmap    Imports the data as a bitmap image, closely reflecting the appearance of the data as 
it appears on your computer screen in the source application.
Picture (Enhanced Metafile)    Similar to the Picture (Metafile) option, with support for more 
features.
AutoCAD Entities    Converts the data into AutoCAD objects such as lines, arcs, and circles. 
Text is converted into AutoCAD single-line text objects. Worksheets are converted into 
AutoCAD tables.
Image Entity    Converts the data into an AutoCAD raster image. You can then edit it by 
using the raster image-related tools such as Adobe Photoshop or the Microsoft Windows 
Paint program. See Chapter 13, “Copying Existing Drawings from Other Sources,” for more 
on how to use raster images.
Unicode Text    Imports text data in the Unicode format. Unicode is an international standard 
for encoding text. If the Text option doesn’t work, try Unicode Text.
Text    Converts the data into AutoCAD multiline text objects. Formatting isn’t imported with 
text.
The options you see in the Paste Special dialog box depend on the type of data being 
imported. You saw how the Microsoft Excel Worksheet option maintains the imported data as 
an Excel worksheet. If the contents of the Clipboard come from another program, you’re offered 
that program as a choice in place of Excel.
Using the Clipboard to Export AutoCAD Drawings
Just as you can cut and paste data into AutoCAD from applications that support OLE, you can 
cut entities from AutoCAD and paste them as images to other applications. This can be useful as 
a way of including AutoCAD illustrations in word processing documents, worksheets, or page 
layout program documents. It can also be useful in creating background images for visualiza-
tion programs such as Autodesk® 3ds Max® and 3ds Max® Design and for paint programs such 
as Corel Painter.
If you cut and paste an AutoCAD drawing to another file by using OLE and then send the 
file to someone using another computer, they must also have AutoCAD installed before they can 
edit the pasted AutoCAD drawing.
The receiving application doesn’t need to support OLE, but if it does, the exported drawing 
can be edited with AutoCAD and will maintain its accuracy as a CAD drawing. Otherwise, the 
AutoCAD image will be converted to a bitmap graphic.

662  | CHAPTER 19  Getting and Exchanging Data from Drawings    
To use the Clipboard to export an object or a set of objects from an AutoCAD drawing, click 
Copy Clip from the Home tab’s Clipboard panel. You’re then prompted to select the objects that 
you want to export. If you want to export and erase objects simultaneously from AutoCAD, click 
Cut from the Home tab’s Clipboard panel.
In the receiving application, choose Edit ➢ Paste Special. You’ll see a dialog box similar to 
the Paste Special dialog box in AutoCAD. Select the method for pasting your AutoCAD image, 
and then click OK. If the receiving application doesn’t have a Paste Special option, choose Edit ➢ 
Paste. The receiving application converts the image into a format that it can accept.
The Bottom Line 
Find the area of closed boundaries.    There are a number of ways to find the area of a closed 
boundary. The easiest way is also perhaps the least obvious.
Master It    Which AutoCAD feature would you use to find the area of an irregular shape, 
such as a pond or lake, quickly?
Get general information.    A lot of information that is stored in AutoCAD drawings can tell 
you about the files. You can find out how much memory a file uses as well as the amount of 
time that has been spent editing the file.
Master It    What feature lets you store your own searchable information about a drawing 
file, and how do you get to this feature?
Use the DXF file format to exchange CAD data with other programs.    Autodesk created 
the DXF file format as a means of sharing vector drawings with other programs.
Master It    Name some of the versions of AutoCAD that you can export to using the Save 
As option.
Use AutoCAD drawings in page layout programs.    AutoCAD drawings find their way into 
all types of documents, including brochures and technical manuals. Users are often asked to 
convert their CAD drawings into formats that can be read by page layout software.
Master It    Name some file formats, by filename extension or type, that page layout pro-
grams can accept.
Use OLE to import data.    You can import data into AutoCAD from a variety of sources. 
Most sources, such as bitmap images and text, can be imported as native AutoCAD objects. 
Other sources may need to be imported as OLE objects.
Master It    To link imported data to a source program through OLE, what dialog box 
would you use?

Chapter  20
Creating 3D Drawings
Viewing an object in three dimensions gives you a sense of its true shape and form. It also helps 
you conceptualize your design, which results in better design decisions. In addition, using 
three-dimensional objects helps you communicate your ideas to those who may not be familiar 
with the plans, sections, and side views of your design.
A further advantage to drawing in three dimensions is that you can derive 2D drawings from 
your 3D models, which may take considerably less time than creating them with standard 2D 
drawing methods. For example, you can model a mechanical part in 3D and then quickly derive 
its 2D top, front, and right-side views by using the techniques discussed in this chapter.
The AutoCAD LT® software does not support any of the 3D-related features described in this 
chapter.

Getting to Know the 3D Modeling Workspace
Most of this book is devoted to showing you how to work in the Drafting & Annotation work-
space. This workspace is basically a 2D drawing environment, although you can certainly work 
in 3D as well.
The AutoCAD® 2017 program offers the 3D Modeling and 3D Basics workspaces, which give 
you a set of tools to help ease your way into 3D modeling. The 3D Modeling workspace gives 
AutoCAD a different set of Ribbon panels, but don’t worry: AutoCAD behaves in the same 
basic way, and the AutoCAD files produced are the same regardless of whether they’re 2D or 
3D drawings. The 3D Basics workspace contains the minimum 3D tools needed to perform 3D 
functions.
Certiﬁcation
Objective

666  | CHAPTER 20  Creating 3D Drawings  
To get to the 3D Modeling workspace, you first click the Workspace Switching tool in the  
status bar. Then select 3D Modeling (see Figure 20.1).
Figure 20.1
The Workspace 
Switching tool
If you’re starting a new 3D model, you’ll also want to create a new file using a 3D template. 
Try the following exercise to get started with 3D modeling:
	
1.	 Start AutoCAD. To create a new 3D modeling file, click New in the Quick Access toolbar 
to open the Select Template dialog box. Select acad3D.dwt and click Open.
	
2.	 Click the Workspace Switching tool in the status bar at the bottom of the screen, and 
select 3D Modeling. You’ll see a new set of panels appear. Your screen will look similar to 
Figure 20.2.
Figure 20.2
The AutoCAD 3D 
Modeling workspace
The drawing area displays the workspace as a perspective view with a dark gray background 
and a grid. This is just a typical AutoCAD drawing file with a couple of setting changes. The 
view has been set up to be a perspective view by default, and a feature called Visual Styles has 
been set to Realistic, which will show 3D objects as solid objects. You’ll learn more about the 

Drawing in 3D Using Solids |  667  
tools that you can use to adjust the appearance of your workspace later in this chapter. For now, 
let’s look at the tool palette and Ribbon that appear in the AutoCAD window.
To the far right is the AutoCAD Materials Browser palette. It shows a graphical list of surface 
materials that you can easily assign to 3D objects in your model. If the Materials Browser does 
not open by default, you’ll see how to open it and learn more about materials in Chapter 22, 
“Editing and Visualizing 3D Solids.”
The Ribbon along the top of the AutoCAD window offers all the tools that you’ll need to 
create 3D models. The 3D Modeling workspace Ribbon offers a few of the tabs and panels with 
which you’re already familiar, but many of the tabs will be new to you (see Figure 20.3). You see 
the familiar Draw and Modify panels in the Home tab, as well as several other panels devoted 
to 3D modeling: Modeling, Mesh, Solid Editing, Section, Coordinates, View, and Selection.
Figure 20.3
The Home Ribbon tab 
and panels of the 3D 
Modeling workspace
In addition, other Ribbon tabs offer more sets of tools designed for 3D modeling. For exam-
ple, the Visualize tab contains tools that control the way the model looks. You can set up light-
ing and shadows and apply materials to objects such as brick or glass. You can also control the 
way AutoCAD illuminates the model through the Lights, Sun & Location, and Materials panels. 
In the next section, you’ll gain firsthand experience creating and editing some 3D shapes using 
the Home tab’s Modeling and View panels and the View tab’s Visual Styles panel. This way, 
you’ll get a feel for how things work in the 3D Modeling workspace.
Drawing in 3D Using Solids
You can work with three types of 3D objects in AutoCAD: solids, surfaces, and mesh objects. You  
can treat solid objects as if they’re solid material. For example, you can create a box and then 
remove shapes from the box as if you’re carving it, as shown in Figure 20.4.
Figure 20.4
Solid modeling lets you 
remove or add shapes.
With surfaces, you create complex surface shapes by building on lines, arcs, or polylines. For 
example, you can quickly turn a series of curved polylines, arcs, or lines into a warped surface, 
as shown in Figure 20.5.

668  | CHAPTER 20  Creating 3D Drawings  
A mesh object is made up of edges, faces, and vertices. These basic parts create a series of 
square or triangular areas to define a three-dimensional form. You can create mesh objects with 
primitives in the same way as you create solid primitives. Their behavior is different, though. 
Mesh objects do not have mass properties like solids, but they can be altered through free-
form modeling techniques. You can add creases as well as splits to the forms. You can alter the 
level of smoothness, which means that you can add more edges, faces, and vertices for a more 
rounded and organic-looking object.
Figure 20.5
Using the Loft tool, 
you can use a set of 
2D objects (left) to 
define a complex 
surface (right).
Next, you’ll learn how to create a solid box and then make simple changes to it as an 
introduction to 3D modeling.
Converting Old-Style Surface Objects
If you have some experience with AutoCAD 3D prior to AutoCAD® 2011, note that the current 
surface-modeling features aren’t the same as the surface objects you may have created in the older 
version of AutoCAD. The current surface objects can interact with solid primitive objects and can 
be converted into 3D solids. You can convert the old-style surfaces into the new 3D surfaces using 
the Convtosurface command described in the sidebar “Converting Objects with Thickness into 3D 
Solids” later in this chapter.
Adjusting Appearances
Before you start to work on the exercises, you’ll want to change to a visual style that will make 
your work a little easier to visualize in the creation phase. Visual styles let you see your model 
in different modes, from sketch-like to realistic. You’ll learn more about visual styles in the  
section “Getting a Visual Effect” later in this chapter. For now, you’ll get a brief introduction by 
changing the style for the exercises that follow:
	
1.	 In the upper-left corner of the drawing area, click the Visual Style Control drop-down list 
to view the options.
	
2.	 Select the Shades Of Gray option. This will give the solid objects in your model a uniform 
gray color and will also “highlight” the edges of the solids with a dark line so that you 
can see them clearly.

Drawing in 3D Using Solids |  669  
Creating a 3D Box
Start by creating a box using the Box tool in the Home tab’s Modeling panel:
	
1.	 Close the Materials Browser, if it is visible, by clicking the X on the title bar. You won’t 
need it for this chapter. If you need it later, you can go to the Materials panel in the 
Visualize tab and click the Materials Browser tool.
	
2.	 Select the Box tool from the Solids flyout on the Home tab’s Modeling panel.
	
3.	 Click a point near the origin of the drawing shown in Figure 20.6. You can use the coor-
dinate readout to select a point near 0,0. After you click, you’ll see a rectangle follow the 
cursor.
	
4.	 Click another point near coordinate 20,15, as shown in Figure 20.6. As you move the cur-
sor, the rectangle is fixed and the height of the 3D box appears.
	
5.	 Enter 4↵ for a height of 4 units for the box. You can also click to fix the height of the box.
Figure 20.6
Drawing a 3D solid box
Select a location near the coordinate 20,15
for the other corner.
Your ﬁrst selection should be a location near 
the drawing’s origin at coordinate 0,0.

670  | CHAPTER 20  Creating 3D Drawings  
You used three basic steps in creating the box. First, you clicked one corner to establish a 
location for the box. Then, you clicked another corner to establish the base size. Finally, you 
selected a height. You use a similar set of steps to create any of the other 3D solid primitives 
found in the Solids flyout of the Home tab’s Modeling panel. For example, for a cylinder you 
select the center, then the radius, and finally the height. For a wedge, you select two corners as 
you did with the box, and then you select the height.
Why the Screen Looks Different
The display shown in this book is set up with a lighter background than the default background 
in AutoCAD so that you can see the various parts of the display more easily on the printed page.
In addition, when you start a 3D model using the acad3D.dwt template, the default layer 0 is set 
to a color that is a light blue instead of the white or black that is used in the standard acad.dwt 
template. The blue color is used so that you can see the 3D shapes clearly when the model is displayed 
using a shaded visual style. If you happen to start a 3D model using the acad.dwt template, you 
may want to change the default layer color to something other than white or black.
Editing 3D Solids with Grips
After you’ve created a solid, you can fine-tune its shape by using grips:
	
1.	 Adjust your view so that it looks similar to Figure 20.7, and then click the solid to select it. 
Grips appear on the 3D solid as shown in the figure.
Figure 20.7
Grips appear on the 3D 
solid.
Click this arrow grip 
to adjust the length of 
the box.
Ctrl-click the top edge
to display the gizmo.
Click the base
of the gizmo.

Drawing in 3D Using Solids |  671  
You can adjust the location of the square grips at the base of the solid in a way that is sim-
ilar to adjusting the grips on 2D objects. The arrow grips let you adjust the length of the 
site to which the arrows are attached. If you click an arrow grip and you have Dynamic 
Input turned on, a dimension appears at the cursor, as shown in Figure 20.7. You can 
enter a new dimension for the length associated with the selected grip, or you can drag 
and click the arrow to adjust the length. Remember that you can press the Tab key to shift 
between dimensions shown in the Dynamic Input display.
	
2.	 Click the arrow grip toward the front of the box, as shown at the upper left in Figure 20.7. 
Now, as you move the cursor, the box changes in length.
	
3.	 Press Esc twice to clear the grip selection and the box selection.
Constraining Motion with the Gizmo
You can move individual edges by using a Ctrl+click. This will activate the gizmo. The gizmo is 
an icon that looks like the UCS icon and appears whenever you select a 3D solid or any part of a 
3D solid. Try the next exercise to see how it works:
	
1.	 Hold down the Ctrl key and move the cursor over different surfaces and edges of the box. 
They will be highlighted as you do this. Ctrl+click the top-front edge of the box to expose 
the edge’s grip. The gizmo will appear.
	
2.	 The gizmo has three legs pointing in the x-, y-, and z-axes. It also has a grip at the base of 
the three legs. If your Ctrl+click doesn’t work as described, you may need to change the 
setting for the Legacyctrlpick system variable. At the Type a Command prompt, enter 
legacyctrlpick↵, and then enter 0↵. Place the cursor on the blue z-axis of the gizmo, but 
don’t click. A blue line appears that extends across the drawing area, and the z-axis of the 
gizmo changes color, as shown in Figure 20.8.
Figure 20.8

constrain motion
Hover over the z-axis
of the gizmo and a
blue line appears.

3.	 Click the z-axis. Now, as you move the cursor, the grip motion is constrained in the 
z-axis.
	
4.	 Click again to fix the location of the grip.

672  | CHAPTER 20  Creating 3D Drawings  
	
5.	 Press the Esc key to clear your grip selection.
	
6.	 Click the Undo tool to undo the grip edit.
Here you used the gizmo to change the Z location of a grip easily. You can use the gizmo to 
modify the location of a single grip or the entire object.
Rotating Objects in 3D Using Dynamic UCS
Typically, you work in what is known as the World Coordinate System (WCS). This is the default 
coordinate system that AutoCAD uses in new drawings, but you can also create your own coor-
dinate systems that are subsets of the WCS. A coordinate system that you create is known as a 
User Coordinate System (UCS).
UCSs are significant in 3D modeling because they can help you orient your work in 3D space. 
For example, you could set up a UCS on a vertical face of the 3D box that you created earlier. You 
could then draw on that vertical face just as you would on the drawing’s WCS. Figure 20.9 shows 
a cylinder drawn on the side of a box. If you click the Cylinder tool, for example, and place the 
cursor on the side of the box, the side will be highlighted to indicate the surface to which the 
cylinder will be applied. In addition, if you could see the cursor in color, you would see that the 
blue z-axis is pointing sideways to the left and is perpendicular to the side of the box.
Figure 20.9
Drawing on the side 
of a box
The face is highlighted.
The cursor’s z-axis is
perpendicular to the
side of the box.
The UCS has always been an important tool for 3D modeling in AutoCAD. The example just 
described demonstrates the Dynamic UCS, which automatically changes the orientation of the 
x-, y-, and z-axes to conform to the flat surface of a 3D object.

Drawing in 3D Using Solids |  673  
You may have noticed that when you created the new 3D file using the acad3D.dwt template, 
the cursor looked different. Instead of the usual cross, you saw three intersecting lines. If you 
look carefully, you’ll see that each line of the cursor is a different color. In its default configura-
tion, AutoCAD shows a red line for the x-axis, a green line for the y-axis, and a blue line for the 
z-axis. This mimics the color scheme of the UCS icon, as shown in Figure 20.10.
Figure 20.10
The UCS icon at the left 
and the cursor in 3D 
to the right are color 
matched.
As you work with the Dynamic UCS, you’ll see that the orientation of these lines changes 
when you point at a surface on a 3D object. The following exercise shows you how to use the 
Dynamic UCS to help you rotate the box about the x-axis:
	
1.	 Be sure that the Object Snap and Allow/Disallow Dynamic UCS features are turned on. If 
a specific icon is not in the status bar, click the Customization button on the far right and 
turn on whichever icon is missing by clicking it on the list.
	
2.	 Click Rotate in the Home tab’s Modify panel or enter RO↵.
	
3.	 At the Select objects: prompt, click the box and then press ↵ to finish your selection.
	
4.	 At the Specify base point: prompt, don’t click anything, but move the cursor from one 
surface of the box to a side of the box. As you do this, notice that the surface you point 
to becomes highlighted. The orientation of the cursor also changes depending on which 
surface you’re pointing to.
	
5.	 Place the cursor on the left side as shown in the top image of Figure 20.11; then 
Shift+right-click and select Endpoint from the Osnap context menu.
	
6.	 While keeping the side highlighted, place the osnap marker on the lower-front corner of 
the box, as shown in the top image in Figure 20.11. Click this corner. As you move the cur-
sor, the box rotates about the y-axis.
	
7.	 Enter -30 for the rotation angle. Your box should look like the image at the bottom in 
Figure 20.11.
Here you saw that you could hover over a surface to indicate the plane about which the rota-
tion is to occur. Now suppose that you want to add an object to one of the sides of the rotated 
box. The next section will show you another essential tool—one you can use to do just that.

674  | CHAPTER 20  Creating 3D Drawings  
Drawing on a 3D Object’s Surface
In the rotation exercise, you saw that you could hover over a surface to indicate the plane of rota-
tion. You can use the same method to indicate the plane on which you want to place an object. 
Try the following exercise to see how it’s done:
	
1.	 Select Center, Radius from the Circle flyout on the Home tab’s Draw panel or enter C↵.
	
2.	 Place the cursor on the top surface of the box, as indicated in the top image of 
Figure 20.12, and hold it there for a moment. The surface is highlighted, and the cursor 
aligns with the angle of the top surface.
Using Object Snaps and Osnap Tracking in 3D Space
If you need to place objects in precise locations in 3D, such as at endpoints or midpoints of other 
objects, you can do so using object snaps, just as you would in 2D. But you must take care when 
using osnaps where the Dynamic UCS is concerned.
In the exercise in the section “Rotating Objects in 3D Using Dynamic UCS,” you were asked to 
make sure that you placed the cursor on the side of the box that coincided with the rotational plane 
before you selected the Endpoint osnap. This ensures that the Dynamic UCS feature has selected 
the proper rotational plane; otherwise, the box may rotate in the wrong direction.

and the resulting box

3.	 Click a point roughly at the center of the box. The circle appears on the surface and, as 
you move the cursor, the circle’s radius follows.
	
4.	 Adjust the circle so that it’s roughly the same 6-unit radius as the one shown on the lower 
image in Figure 20.12, and then click to set the radius. You can also enter 6↵.
	
5.	 Select Offset from the Home tab’s Modify panel, and offset the circle 2 units inward, as 
shown in the lower image of Figure 20.12. You can use the Center osnap to indicate a 
direction toward the center of the circle.
Figure 20.12

surface of a 3D solid
Hover over the top surface
and select a point at the
center of the box.
Offset the circle
toward the center.
Using a Fixed UCS
If you’re working in a crowded area of a drawing or if you know you need to do a lot of work on one 
particular surface of an object, you can create a UCS that remains in a fixed orientation until you 
change it instead of relying on the Dynamic UCS feature. Select Face from the View flyout on the 
Home tab’s Coordinates panel, and then click the surface that defines the plane on which you want 
to work. The UCS aligns with the selected surface. Press ↵ to accept the face that the Face option 
has found, or you can use one of the options [Next/Xflip/Yflip] to move to another surface or 
flip the UCS. Once you’ve set the UCS, you won’t have to worry about accidentally drawing in the 
wrong orientation. To return to the WCS, click UCS, World in the View tab’s Coordinates panel. 
You’ll learn more about the UCS in Chapter 21, “Using Advanced 3D Features.”

676  | CHAPTER 20  Creating 3D Drawings  
This demonstrates that you can use Dynamic UCS to align objects with the surface of an 
object. Note that Dynamic UCS works only on flat surfaces. For example, you can’t use it to place 
an object on the curved side of a cylinder.
Pushing and Pulling Shapes from a Solid
You’ve just added two 2D circles to the top surface of the 3D box. AutoCAD offers a tool that lets 
you use those 2D circles, or any closed 2D shapes, to modify the shape of your 3D object. The 
Presspull tool in the Home tab’s Modeling panel lets you “press” or “pull” a 3D shape to or from 
the surface of a 3D object. The following exercise shows how this works:
	
1.	 Make sure that the Polar Tracking tool in the status bar is turned on, and then click the 
Presspull tool in the Home tab’s Modeling panel. You can also enter Presspull↵ at the 
Type a Command prompt.
	
2.	 Move the cursor to the top surface of the box between both circles. (See the lower-right 
panel of Figure 20.13.)
Figure 20.13
Move the cursor over 
different areas of the 
box and notice how the 
areas are highlighted.
Point inside the circle, and
the center circle is
highlighted.
Point between the circles,
and the ring formed by the
two circles is highlighted.

Drawing in 3D Using Solids |  677  
	
3.	 With the cursor between the two circles, click. As you move the mouse, the circular area 
defined by the two circles moves.
	
4.	 Adjust the cursor location so that the cursor is positioned below the center of the circle, 
as shown in the top-left panel of Figure 20.13. Enter 3↵ to create a 3-unit indentation, as 
shown in Figure 20.14.
Figure 20.14
Creating an indenta-
tion in the box using 
Presspull
Enter 3 and a 3-unit
indentation appears
in the box.
You’ve created a circular indentation in the box by pressing the circular area defined by the 
two circles. You could have pulled the area upward to form a circular ridge on the box. Pressing 
the circle into the solid is essentially the same as subtracting one solid from another. When you 
press the shape into the solid, AutoCAD assumes that you want to subtract the shape.
Presspull works with any closed 2D shape, such as a circle, closed polyline, or other com-
pletely enclosed area. An existing 3D solid isn’t needed. For example, you can draw two concen-
tric circles without the 3D box and then use Presspull to convert the circles into a 3D solid ring. 
In the previous exercise, the solid box showed that you can use Presspull to subtract a shape 
from an existing solid.
As you saw in this exercise, the Presspull tool can help you quickly subtract a shape from 
an existing 3D solid. Figure 20.15 shows some other examples of how you can use Presspull. 
For example, you can draw a line from one edge to another and then use Presspull to extrude 
the resulting triangular shape. You can also draw concentric shapes and extrude them; you can 
even use offset spline curves to add a trough to a solid.
Drawing outside the Surface
If you use an open 2D object such as a curved spline or line on a 3D surface, the endpoints must 
touch exactly on the edge of the surface before Presspull will work.

678  | CHAPTER 20  Creating 3D Drawings  
Making Changes to Your Solid
When you’re creating a 3D model, you’ll hardly ever get the shape right the first time. Suppose 
you decide that you need to modify the shape you’ve created so far by moving the hole from the 
center of the box to a corner. The next exercise will show you how to access the individual com-
ponents of a 3D solid to make changes.
Your working model is composed of two objects: a box and a cylinder formed from two circles. 
These two components of the solid are referred to as subobjects of the main solid object. Faces and 
edges of 3D solids are also considered subobjects. When you use the Union, Subtract, and Intersect 
tools later in this book, you’ll see that objects merge into a single solid—or at least that is how it seems 
at first. You can use Ctrl+click to access and modify the shapes of the subobjects. Try the following:
	
1.	 Press Esc to cancel the previous command. Place the cursor on the components of the 
solid that you’ve made so far. They are highlighted as if they were one object. If you were 
to click it (don’t do it yet), the entire object would be selected.
	
2.	 Hold down the Ctrl key, and move the cursor over the circular indentation. As you do 
this, the indentation is highlighted (see the top-left image in Figure 20.16).
	
3.	 While still holding down the Ctrl key, click both of the indentation sides. The grip for 
the indentation appears, as shown in the lower-right image in Figure 20.16. As you 
may guess, you can use these grips to change the shape and location of a feature of the 
selected solid. Release the Ctrl key when finished.
	
4.	 Click the center square grip of the indentation, and move your cursor around. If you find 
it a bit uncontrollable, turn off Polar Tracking mode and osnaps. As you move the cursor, 
the indentation moves with it.

shapes using the 
Presspull tool

5.	 Place the indentation in the location shown in Figure 20.17 and click. You’ve just moved 
the indentation from the center to the edge of the cylinder.

680  | CHAPTER 20  Creating 3D Drawings  
Things to Watch Out for When Editing 3D Objects
You can use the Move and Stretch commands on 3D objects to modify their z-coordinate values—
but you have to be careful with these commands when editing in 3D. Here are a few tips that we’ve 
picked up while working on various 3D projects:
◆
◆
If you want to move a 3D solid using grips, you need to select the square grip at the bottom 
center of the solid. The other grips move only the feature associated with the grip, like a corner 
or an edge. When that bottom grip is selected, you can switch to another grip as the base point 
for the move by doing the following: After selecting the base grip, right-click, select Base Point 
from the context menu, and click the grip that you want to use.
◆
◆
The Scale command will scale an object’s z-coordinate value as well as the standard x-coordinate 
and y-coordinate. Suppose that you have an object with an elevation of 2 units. If you use the 
Scale command to enlarge that object by a factor of 4, the object will have a new elevation of 2 
units times 4, or 8 units. If, on the other hand, that object has an elevation of 0, its elevation 
won’t change because 0 times 4 is still 0. You can use the 3dscale command to restrict the scal-
ing of an object to a single plane.
◆
◆
You can also use Mirror and Rotate (on the Modify panel) on 3D solid objects, but these com-
mands don’t affect their z-coordinate values. You can specify z-coordinates for base and inser-
tion points, so take care when using these commands with 3D models.
◆
◆
Using the Move, Stretch, and Copy commands (on the Modify panel) with osnaps can produce 
unpredictable and unwanted results. As a rule, it’s best to use coordinate filters when selecting 
points with osnap overrides. For example, to move an object from the endpoint of one object to 
the endpoint of another on the same z-coordinate, invoke the .XY point filter at the Specify 
base point: and Specify second point: prompts before you issue the Endpoint override. 
Proceed to pick the endpoint of the object you want, and then enter the z-coordinate or pick 
any point to use the current default z-coordinate.
◆
◆
When you create a block, it uses the currently active UCS to determine its own local coordinate 
system. When that block is later inserted, it orients its own coordinate system with the current 
UCS. (The UCS is discussed in more detail in Chapter 21.)
This example showed that the Ctrl key can be an extremely useful tool when you have to 
edit a solid; it allows you to select the subobjects that form your model. Once the subobjects are 
selected, you can move them, or you can use the arrow grips to change their size.
Creating 3D Forms from 2D Shapes
You’ve seen that 3D solid primitives are great for creating basic shapes, but in many situations 
you’ll want to create a 3D form from a more complex shape. Fortunately, you can extrude 2D 
objects into a variety of shapes using the additional tools found in the Home tab’s Modeling 
panel. For example, you can draw a shape like a star and then extrude it along the z-axis, as 
shown in Figure 20.18. Alternatively, you can use several strategically placed 2D objects to form 
a flowing surface like the wing of an airplane.
You can create a 3D solid by extruding a 2D closed polyline. This is a flexible way to create 
shapes because you can create a polyline of any shape and extrude it to a fairly complex form.

Creating 3D Forms from 2D Shapes |  681  
In the following set of exercises, you’ll turn the apartment room from previous chapters into 
a 3D model. We’ve created a version of the apartment floor plan that has a few additions to make 
things a little easier for you. Figure 20.19 shows the file that you’ll use in the exercise. It’s the same 
floor plan from earlier chapters but with the addition of closed polylines outlining the walls.

682  | CHAPTER 20  Creating 3D Drawings  
The plan isn’t shaded as in the previous examples in this chapter. You can work in 3D in this 
display mode just as easily as in a shaded mode:
	
1.	 Open the 20-unit.dwg file. Metric users should open 20-unit-metric.dwg.
	
2.	 Choose SW Isometric from the 3D Navigation drop-down list in the Home tab’s View 
panel (see Figure 20.20). You can also type -View↵Swiso↵.
Figure 20.20
Selecting a view from 
the 3D Navigation 
drop-down list
Your view now looks as if you’re standing above and to the left of your drawing rather 
than directly above it (see Figure 20.21). The UCS icon helps you to get a sense of your new 
orientation.
Figure 20.21

the Extrude command.
	
3.	 Click the Extrude tool in the Home tab’s Modeling panel (see Figure 20.22).

You can also enter Extrude↵ at the command-line interface. You see the message Current 
wire frame density: ISOLINES=4, Closed profiles creation mode = Solid 
Select objects to extrude or [Mode:_MO Closed profiles creation mode 
[Solid/Surface] <Solid>:_SO in the Command window followed by the Select 
objects to extrude or [MOde]: prompt.
	
4.	 Select the wall outlines shown in Figure 20.21, and then press ↵.
	
5.	 At the Specify height of extrusion or [Direction/Path/Taper angle/
Expression] <-0'-3">: prompt, place the cursor near the top of the drawing area and 
enter 8′↵. Metric users should enter 224↵. The walls extrude to the height you entered, as 
shown in Figure 20.23.
Figure 20.22
Selecting the Extrude 
tool from the Modeling 
panel
Figure 20.23
The extruded walls
Unlike in the earlier exercise with the box, you can see through the walls because this is a 
Wireframe view. A Wireframe view shows the volume of a 3D object by displaying the lines rep-
resenting the edges of surfaces. Later in this chapter, we’ll discuss how to make an object’s sur-
faces appear opaque as they do on the box earlier in this chapter.
Next you’ll add door headers to define the wall openings:
	
1.	 Adjust your view so that you get a close look at the doorway shown in Figure 20.24. You 
can use the Pan and Zoom tools in this 3D view as you would in a 2D view.

684  | CHAPTER 20  Creating 3D Drawings  
	
2.	 Turn off Dynamic UCS mode by clicking the Allow/Disallow Dynamic UCS tool in the 
status bar so that it’s grayed out. This helps you avoid accidentally orienting your cursor 
to the wall behind the door header.
	
3.	 Click the Box tool in the Solids flyout of the Modeling panel.
	
4.	 Use the Endpoint osnaps, and click the two points shown in Figure 20.24.
	
5.	 At the Specify height or [2Point] <8′-0">: prompt, point the cursor downward 
from the points you just selected and enter 12↵. Metric users should enter 30↵. The door 
header appears.
	
6.	 Zoom and pan so that your view resembles Figure 20.25, and then repeat steps 4 and 5 to 
draw the other door headers.
Figure 20.24

header to the opening

Isolating Coordinates with Point Filters |  685  
The walls and door headers give you a better sense of the space in the unit plan. To enhance 
the appearance of the 3D model further, you can join the walls and door headers so that they 
appear as seamless walls and openings:
	
1.	 Zoom out so that you can see the entire unit. Click the Union tool in the Solid tab’s 
Boolean panel (see Figure 20.26). You can also enter UNI↵.
Figure 20.26
Select the Union tool.
	
2.	 At the Select objects: prompt, select all the walls and headers, and then press ↵.
Now the walls and headers appear as one seamless surface without any distracting joint 
lines. You can get a sense of the space of the unit plan. You’ll want to explore ways of viewing 
the unit in 3D, but before you do that, you need to know about one more 3D modeling feature: 
point filters.
Isolating Coordinates with Point Filters
AutoCAD offers a method for 3D point selection that can help you isolate the x-, y-, or z-coordi-
nate of a location in 3D. Using point filters (described in the help files as “coordinate filters”), you 
can enter an X, Y, or Z value by picking a point on the screen and telling AutoCAD to use only 
the X, Y, or Z value of that point or any combination of those values. For example, suppose that 
you want to start the corner of a 3D box at the x- and y-coordinates of the corner of the unit plan, 
but you want the Z location at 3′ instead of at ground level. You can use point or coordinate 
filters to select only the x- and y-coordinates of a point and then specify the z-coordinate as a 
separate value. The following exercise demonstrates how this works:
	
1.	 Zoom into the balcony door, and turn on the F-RAIL layer. Turn off Dynamic Input.
	
2.	 Choose the Box tool from the Solids flyout on the Modeling panel.
	
3.	 At the Specify first corner or [Center]: prompt, Shift+right-click to display the 
Object Snap menu and then choose Point Filters ➢ .XY. As an alternative, you can enter 
.xy↵. By doing this, you are telling AutoCAD that first you’re going to specify the x- and 
y-coordinates for this beginning point and then later indicate the z-coordinate.
You may have noticed the .X, .Y, and .Z options on the Object Snap menu (Shift+right-
click) in step 3. These are the 3D point filters. By choosing one of these options as you 
select points in a 3D command, you can filter an X, Y, or Z value, or any combination of 
values, from that selected point. You can also enter filters through the keyboard.
	
4.	 At the Specify first corner or [Center]: .XY of: prompt, pick the corner of the 
unit plan, as shown in Figure 20.27.

686  | CHAPTER 20  Creating 3D Drawings  
	
5.	 At the (need Z): prompt, enter 36↵ (the z-coordinate). Metric users enter 92↵. The outline 
of the box appears at the 36″ (or 92 cm) elevation and at the corner you selected in step 4.
	
6.	 At the Specify other corner or [Cube/Length]: prompt, Shift+right-click to display 
the Osnap menu again and choose Point Filters ➢ XY. Select the other endpoint indicated 
in Figure 20.27.
	
7.	 At the (need Z): prompt, a temporary outline of the box appears at the 36″ height.
Enter 40↵ (101↵ for metric users) for the height of the box. The box appears as the balcony 
rail, as shown in the bottom image in Figure 20.27.
In step 4, you selected the corner of the unit, but the box didn’t appear right away. You had 
to enter a Z value in step 5 before the outline of the box appeared. Then, in step 6, you saw the 
box begin at the 36″ elevation. Using point filters allowed you to place the box accurately in the 
drawing even though there were no features that you could snap to directly.
Figure 20.27
Constructing the rail 
using point filters
Converting Objects with Thickness into 3D Solids
If you’ve worked with 3D in AutoCAD before, you probably know that you can give an object a thick-
ness property greater than 0 to make it a 3D object. For example, a line with a thickness property 
greater than 0 looks like a vertical surface.
Select the .XY ﬁlter, and
then select this corner.
The box outline appears.
Select this endpoint
for the other corner.
The rail in

Isolating Coordinates with Point Filters |  687  
In the unit plan exercise, you can do the same for the polylines used to draw the walls. Click the 
wall polylines, and then right-click and choose Properties. In the Properties palette, change the 
Thickness value to 8′ or 224 cm.
The walls appear in three dimensions. But be aware that these walls aren’t 3D solids. If you zoom 
in to a detail of the walls, they appear hollow.
Fortunately, AutoCAD supplies a tool that converts a closed polyline with thickness into a solid. 
Expand the Home tab’s Solid Editing panel, and then click the Convert To Solid tool. You can also 
enter convtosolid↵.
Select the polyline walls; press ↵ when you’ve finished your selection. After you do this, the walls 
become 3D solids. This operation works with any closed polyline, providing an alternate way of 
creating a 3D solid. If you have existing 3D models that have been produced using the Thickness 
property, you can use the Convert To Solid tool to bring your 3D models up-to-date. The Convert 
To Solid tool can also convert open polylines that have a width and thickness greater than 0. (See 
Chapter 18, “Drawing Curves,” for more on polylines.)
Another tool, called Convert To Surface, converts objects with thickness into 3D surface objects. 
You can use 3D surfaces to slice or thicken 3D solids into full 3D solids. You’ll learn more about 3D 
surfaces in Chapter 23, “Exploring 3D Mesh and Surface Modeling.”
Now that you’ve gotten most of the unit modeled in 3D, you’ll want to be able to look at it 
from different angles. Next, you’ll see some of the tools available to control your views in 3D.
Get to Know Coordinate Filters
In our own work in 3D, coordinate filters are a real lifesaver. They can help you locate a position in 
3D when the drawing becomes crowded with objects. And because a lot of architectural models start 
from floor plans, you can easily “project” locations into 3D using coordinate filters. Understanding 
this tool will greatly improve your ability to work in 3D.

688  | CHAPTER 20  Creating 3D Drawings  
Moving Around Your Model
AutoCAD offers a number of tools to help you view your 3D model. You’ve already used one to 
get the current 3D view. Choosing Southwest Isometric from the View panel’s drop-down list 
displays an isometric view from a southwest direction. You may have noticed several other  
isometric view options in that list. The following sections introduce you to some of the ways 
that you can move around in your 3D model.
Finding Isometric and Orthogonal Views
Figure 20.28 illustrates the isometric view options that you saw earlier in the Home tab’s View 
panel drop-down list: Southeast Isometric, Southwest Isometric, Northeast Isometric, and 
Northwest Isometric. The cameras represent the different viewpoint locations. You can get an 
idea of their location in reference to the grid and UCS icon.

The Home tab’s View panel’s 3D Navigation drop-down list also offers another set of options: 
Top, Bottom, Left, Right, Front, and Back. These are orthogonal views that show the sides, top, 
and bottom of the model, as illustrated in Figure 20.29. In this figure, the cameras once again 
show the points of view.

When you use any of the view options described here, AutoCAD attempts to display 
the extents of the drawing. You can then use the Pan and Zoom tools to adjust your 
view.
Rotating Freely Around Your Model
You may find the isometric and orthogonal views a bit restrictive. The Orbit tool lets you move 
around your model in real time. You can fine-tune your view by clicking and dragging the 
mouse using this tool. Try the following to see how it works:
	
1.	 Zoom out so that you see an overall view of your model.
	
2.	 Click the Orbit tool in the Orbit flyout on the View tab’s Navigate panel. If the Navigate 
panel is not there, right-click the ribbon, click Show Panels, and then click Navigate. This 
will display the Navigate panel.
You can also enter 3dorbit↵ and then right-click and select Other Navigation Modes ➢ 
Constrained Orbit.
	
3.	 Click and drag in the drawing area. As you drag the mouse, the view revolves around 
your model. The cursor changes to an orbit icon to let you know that you’re in the middle 
of using the Constrained Orbit tool.
If you have several objects in your model, you can select an object that you want to revolve 
around and then click the Orbit tool. It also helps to pan your view so that the object you select 
is in the center of the view.
When you’ve reached the view that you want, right-click and choose Exit. You’re then ready 
to make more changes or use another tool.
Changing Your View Direction
One of the first tasks you’ll want to do with a model is to look at it from all angles. The 
ViewCube® tool is perfect for this purpose. The ViewCube is a device that lets you select a view 
by using a sample cube. If it is not visible in your drawing, follow these steps:
	
1.	 First make sure that Visual Styles is set to something other than 2D Wireframe by 
selecting an option from the Visual Styles drop-down list.

690  | CHAPTER 20  Creating 3D Drawings  
	
2.	 If you don’t already see the ViewCube in the upper-right corner of the drawing area, go 
to the View tab’s Viewport Tools panel and turn on the ViewCube option by clicking the 
View Cube button.
Constrained Orbit Shortcut
If you have a mouse with a scroll wheel, you can hold down the Shift key while clicking and drag-
ging the wheel to get the same effect as using the Constrained Orbit tool. If this doesn’t work for 
you, try installing the manufacturer’s software and drivers.
The following list explains what you can do with the ViewCube (see Figure 20.30):
◆
◆
Click the Home icon to bring your view to the “home” position. This is helpful if you lose 
sight of your model.
◆
◆
You can get a top, front, right-side, or other orthogonal view just by clicking the word Top, 
Front, or Right on the ViewCube.
◆
◆
Click a corner of the cube to get an isometric-style view, or click an edge to get an “edge-
on” view.
◆
◆
Click and drag the N, S, E, or W label to rotate the model in the XY plane.
◆
◆
To rotate your view of the object in 3D freely, click and drag the cube.
◆
◆
From the icon at the bottom, select an existing UCS or create a new one from the UCS list.

Moving Around Your Model |  691  
You can also change from a perspective view to a parallel projection view by right-clicking 
the cube and selecting Parallel Projection. To go from parallel projection to perspective, right-
click and select Perspective or Perspective With Ortho Faces. The Perspective With Ortho Faces 
option works like the Perspective option, except that it will force a parallel projection view when 
you use the ViewCube to select a top, bottom, or side orthographic view.
When you are in a plan or top view, the ViewCube will look like a square, and when you 
hover your cursor over the cube, you’ll see two curved arrows to the upper right of the cube (see 
Figure 20.31).
Figure 20.30
The ViewCube and its 
options
Click the Home icon to bring your view to the “home” 
position. This is helpful if you lose sight of your model.
Click a corner to get an isometric-style view.
Click an edge to get an “edge-on” view.
Click the face of the cube to get an orthogonal view 
such as a top, front, or right-side view.
Click and drag the compass ring to rotate your view.
Click and drag a corner or edge to rotate your view 
freely in all directions.
Select an existing UCS or create a new one from the 
UCS list.
Figure 20.31
The ViewCube top view
You can click on any of the visible corners to go to an isometric view or click the double-
curved arrows to rotate the view 90 degrees. The four arrowheads that you see pointing toward 
the cube allow you to change to an orthographic view of any of the four sides.
Setting the Home View
In a new file, the ViewCube’s home view is similar to the SW Isometric view. To set your own home 
view, right-click the ViewCube and select Set Current View As Home.

692  | CHAPTER 20  Creating 3D Drawings  
Using SteeringWheels
The ViewCube is great for looking at your model from different angles. But if your applica-
tion requires you to be inside your model, you’ll want to know how to use the SteeringWheels® 
feature. The SteeringWheels feature collects a number of viewing tools in one interface. You 
can open SteeringWheels by clicking the SteeringWheels tool in the View tab’s Navigate panel 
(see Figure 20.32) or from the Navigation bar.
Figure 20.32
The SteeringWheels 
tool
You can also type Navswheel↵. When you do this, the SteeringWheels tool appears in the 
drawing area and moves with the cursor.
The SteeringWheels options are fairly self-explanatory. Just be aware that you need to use a 
click-and-drag motion to use them:
Pan    To pan your view, click and drag the Pan option.
Zoom    To zoom, click and drag the Zoom option.
Orbit    The Orbit option lets you revolve your view about your model.
Look    The Look option swivels your point of view around your model as if you were stand-
ing still and moving your “camera” around.
Center    The Center option is a bit less obvious, but it is an important tool for the 
SteeringWheels feature. Click and hold the Center option and then drag the circular cur-
sor that appears onto a 3D object. In any visual style other than 2D Wireframe, you will see 
a green sphere that indicates the center of your view for the Orbit option. Place this green 
sphere on the object at the desired center of your orbit. For example, if you want to use the 
Orbit option to look at all sides of a cube, click and drag the Center option so that the green 
sphere is at the center of the cube. Release the mouse button when you’ve placed the sphere 
where you want it (see Figure 20.33).
Figure 20.33
Placing the green 
sphere of the Center 
option
If you are in a 2D Wireframe view, you will have to place the cursor on the edge of the object 
before you’ll see the green sphere.

Moving Around Your Model |  693  
Walk    The Walk option is similar to the Walk tool in the Render tab’s Animations panel. 
(See “Changing Where You Are Looking” later in this chapter for more on the Walk tool.) 
Click and drag the Walk option, and you’ll see a blue circle and a cursor arrow that points in 
a direction away from the circle (see Figure 20.34). Your view moves smoothly in the direc-
tion of the arrow as if to follow it.
Figure 20.34
Using the Walk option
Rewind    The Rewind option rewinds the views that you’ve seen while using the 
SteeringWheels feature. Click and drag the Rewind option, and you see a series of panels like 
movie frames in a video-editing program (see Figure 20.35).
Figure 20.35
The frames of the 
Rewind tool
As you move the mouse from right to left, the views in the AutoCAD drawing area are 
played back smoothly in reverse order. Move left to right to move forward in time through 
the views. This is especially helpful if your model has accidentally shifted out of view. You 
can roll back your views to one before the model flew out of view.
Up/Down    The Up/Down option will move your view up or down respectively along the 
z-axis using a slider control.
You can right-click SteeringWheels for a number of options in the context menu. You can also 
open this menu by clicking the arrowhead in the lower-right corner of the wheel. Most of these 
context menu options are self-explanatory, but a few of them are worth a brief description.
If you click the Basic Wheels option in the SteeringWheels context menu, you’ll see Tour 
Building and View Object. Select the Tour Building Wheel option. Figure 20.36 shows these 
variations on the basic SteeringWheels wheel, and they offer a pared-down set of options for the 
two types of viewing options indicated by the name of the wheels.

694  | CHAPTER 20  Creating 3D Drawings  
You’ll also see mini versions available for the wheels from the SteeringWheels menu. The 
mini versions are much smaller, and they do not have labels indicating the options. Instead you 
see segmented circles, like a pie. Each segment of the circle is an option. Tool tips appear when 
you point at a segment, telling you what option that segment represents. Other than that, the 
mini versions work the same as the full-sized wheels.
The SteeringWheels feature takes a little practice, but when you’ve become familiar with it, 
you may find that you use it frequently when studying a 3D model. Just remember that a click-
and-drag motion is required to use the tools effectively.
Changing Where You Are Looking
AutoCAD uses a camera analogy to help you set up views in your 3D model. With a camera, you 
have a camera location and a target, and you can fine-tune both in AutoCAD. AutoCAD also 
offers the Swivel tool to let you adjust your view orientation. Using the Swivel tool is like keep-
ing the camera stationary while pointing in a different direction. While viewing your drawing  
in perspective mode, click Pan on the View tab’s Navigation bar, right-click in the drawing area,  
and select Other Navigation Modes ➢ Swivel. (Remember that you need to right-click the 
ViewCube and select Perspective for the perspective mode.)
At first, the Swivel tool might seem just like the Pan tool. But in the 3D world, Pan actually 
moves both the camera and the target in unison. Using Pan is a bit like pointing a camera out 
the side of a moving car. If you don’t keep the view in the camera fixed on an object, you are 
panning across the scenery. Using the Swivel tool is like standing on the side of the road and 
turning the camera to take in a panoramic view.
To use the Swivel tool, follow these steps:
	
1.	 While in a perspective view, click Pan on the View tab’s Navigate panel or on the 
Navigation bar.
	
2.	 Right-click in the drawing area, and choose Other Navigation Modes ➢ Swivel. You can 
also type 3dswivel↵ at the Type a Command prompt.
	
3.	 Click and drag in the drawing to swivel your point of view.
	
4.	 When you have the view you want, right-click and select Exit.
If you happen to lose your view entirely, you can use the Undo tool in the Quick Access tool-
bar to return to your previous view and start over.
Flying through Your View
Another way to get around in your model is to use the Walk or Fly view options. If you’re famil-
iar with computer games, this tool is for you. To get to these options, start the Pan tool as you 
did in the last exercise, and then right-click and select Other Navigation Modes ➢ Fly. If you 
Figure 20.36
Variations of the 
SteeringWheels wheel

Moving Around Your Model |  695  
don’t see the Other Navigation Modes menu option, make sure that you are in a perspective 
view.
Where to Find Walk
The Walk tool is part of a flyout on the Animations panel. Typically, the Animations panel is not 
displayed. To display it, select the Visualize tab, right-click in a Ribbon panel, and select Show 
Panels ➢ Animations. The Walk tool is in the upper-right corner of the panel. The Fly tool is in the 
flyout of the Walk tool.
If you right-click while in this mode and click Display Instruction Window, a window will 
appear on the Communications Center. The message in the window tells you all you need to 
know about the Walk and Fly tools. You can use the arrow keys to move through your model. 
Click and drag the mouse to change the direction where you’re looking.
If you press the F key, Walk changes to Fly mode. The main difference between Walk and Fly 
is that in Walk, both your position in the model and the point where you’re looking move with 
the Up and Down arrow keys. Walk is a bit like Pan. When you’re in Fly mode, the arrow keys 
move you toward the center of your view, which is indicated by a crosshair.
In addition to the crosshair, you’ll see a palette that shows your position in the model from a 
top-down view (see Figure 20.37).
Figure 20.37
The Position Locator 
palette uses a 
top-down view.
You can use the palette to control your view by clicking and dragging the camera or the view 
target graphic. If you prefer, you can close the palette and continue to “walk” through your 
model. When you’re finished using Walk, right-click and choose Exit.

696  | CHAPTER 20  Creating 3D Drawings  
Changing from Perspective to Parallel Projection
When you create a new drawing using the acad3D.dwt template, you’re automatically given a 
perspective view of the file. If you need a more schematic parallel projection style of view, you 
can get one from the ViewCube’s right-click menu (see Figure 20.38). You can return to a per-
spective view by using the same context menu shown in the figure.

Getting a Visual Effect
Although 3D models are extremely useful in communicating your ideas to others, sometimes 
you find that the default appearance of your model isn’t exactly what you want. If you’re only 
in a schematic design stage, you may want your model to look more like a sketch instead of a 
finished product. Conversely, if you’re trying to sell someone on a concept, you may want a real-
istic look that includes materials and even special lighting.
AutoCAD provides a variety of tools to help you get a visual style, from a simple wireframe 
to a fully rendered image complete with chrome and wood. In the following sections, you’ll 
get a preview of what is available to control the appearance of your model. Later, in Chapter 22, 
you’ll get an in-depth look at rendering and camera tools that allow you to produce views from 
hand-sketched “napkin” designs to finished renderings.
Using Visual Styles
In the earlier exercises in this chapter, you drew a box that appeared to be solid. When you 
then opened an existing file to extrude the unit plan into the third dimension, you worked in a 
Wireframe view. These views are known as visual styles in AutoCAD. You used the Shades Of 
Gray visual style when you drew the box. The unit plan used the default 2D Wireframe view 
that is used in the AutoCAD Classic style of drawing.
Sometimes, it helps to use a different visual style, depending on your task. For example, the 
2D Wireframe view in your unit plan model can help you visualize and select things that are 
behind a solid. AutoCAD includes several shaded view options that can bring out various fea-
tures of your model. Try the following exercises to explore some of the other visual styles:
	
1.	 Click the Visual Styles drop-down list in the Home tab’s View panel. You can also 
find the list in the View tab’s Visual Styles panel, which will display the Visual Styles 
Manager palette. A set of graphic images appears that gives you an idea of what each 

Getting a Visual Effect |  697  
visual style shows you (see Figure 20.39). You can also access the visual styles from the 
Visual Styles drop-down list located at the upper-left side of the drawing screen, but you 
will not get the graphical images.
Figure 20.39
The Visual Styles 
drop-down
	
2.	 Select Wireframe. You can also enter Vscurrent↵ Wireframe↵. Your model appears as a 
transparent wireframe object with a gray background.
	
3.	 To get to the shaded view of your model, choose Realistic from the Visual Styles drop-
down list or enter Vscurrent↵ Realistic ↵.
You may have noticed a few other visual styles options. Figure 20.40 shows a few of those 
options as they’re applied to a sphere. 2D Wireframe and Wireframe may appear the same, but 
Wireframe uses a perspective view and a background color, whereas 2D Wireframe uses a par-
allel projection view and no background color.

Creating a Sketched Look with Visual Styles
You may notice blanks in the visual styles options in the View tab’s Visual Styles drop-down 
list. These spaces allow you to create custom visual styles. For practice, you’ll create a visual 
style similar to the existing Sketchy style so that you can learn how the rough look of that style 
was created. The following exercise will step you through the process:
	
1.	 Click the Visual Styles Manager from the Visual Styles drop-down. The Visual Styles 
Manager appears (see Figure 20.41). You can also enter Visualstyles ↵. This palette looks 

698  | CHAPTER 20  Creating 3D Drawings  
similar to the Properties palette with the addition of thumbnail examples of the visual 
styles at the top of the palette.
Figure 20.41
The Visual Styles 
Manager
Figure 20.42
The Create New Visual 
Style dialog box
	
2.	 Click the Create New Visual Style tool in the Visual Styles Manager toolbar. The Create 
New Visual Style dialog box opens (see Figure 20.42).
	
3.	 Enter Sketch in the Name box.
	
4.	 Enter Hand Drawn Appearance in the Description box, and then click OK. You see a new 
thumbnail in the bottom-left corner of the samples at the top of the palette.

Getting a Visual Effect |  699  
You’ve just created a new visual style. This new style uses the default settings that are similar 
to the Realistic visual style but without the Material Display option turned on. The material set-
ting causes objects in your drawing to display any material assignments that have been given to 
objects. You’ll learn more about materials in Chapter 22.
Now that you have a new visual style, you can begin to customize it. But before you start 
your customization, make your new visual style the current one so that you can see the effects 
of your changes as you make them:
	
1.	 Click the Apply Selected Visual Style To Current Viewport tool in the Visual Styles 
Manager toolbar.
The display changes slightly, and you see the name Sketch appear in the Visual Styles 
drop-down list as well as the upper-left corner of the drawing area.
Next, you’ll turn on the two features that will give your new visual style a sketch-like 
appearance.
	
2.	 Use the scroll bar to the left of the Visual Styles Manager to scroll down to the bottom of 
the list of options.
	
3.	 Locate the Edge Modifiers option group, and click the Line Extensions Edges tool in the 
Edge Modifiers title bar.
Edges of your model now appear to be drawn with lines extending beyond the corners.
	
4.	 Click the Jitter Edges tool in the Edge Modifiers title bar. The edges take on a sketched 
look, as shown in Figure 20.43.
Figure 20.43
The 3D unit plan with 
the Sketch visual style
	
5.	 Save the unit plan file.
The 3D view has taken on a hand-drawn appearance. Notice that the lines overhang the cor-
ners in a typical architectural sketch style. This is the effect of the Line Extensions Edges option 
that you used in step 3. The lines are made rough and broken by the Jitter Edges setting. You 
can control the amount of overhang and jitter in the Edge Modifiers group of the Visual Styles 
Manager to exaggerate or soften these effects.

700  | CHAPTER 20  Creating 3D Drawings  
With your newly created Sketch visual style, the model looks like it’s transparent. You can 
make it appear opaque by turning off the Show option under the Occluded Edges group in the 
Visual Styles Manager (see Figure 20.44).
Figure 20.44
The Show option in the 
Occluded Edges group 
in the Visual Styles 
Manager
Finally, you can control some of the commonly used visual style properties using options in 
the Visualize tab’s Visual Styles panel. This panel offers control over isolines, color, face style, 
shadows, and textures for the current visual style (see Figure 20.45).
In-Canvas Viewport Controls
Since AutoCAD® 2012, controls have been built into each viewport that allow you to change 
between visual styles and model views quickly without starting either command. You’ll find 
these controls in the upper-left portion of the viewport. Clicking the view name will bring up a 
list of the available views from which you may choose. Likewise, clicking the visual style will 
bring up a list of available visual styles. Clicking either of them will instantly make the selected 
style or view current in that viewport.
Turning a 3D View into a 2D AutoCAD Drawing
Many architectural firms use AutoCAD 3D models to study their designs. After a specific part 
of a design is modeled and approved, they convert the model into 2D elevations, ready to plug 
into their elevation drawing.
If you need to convert your 3D models into 2D line drawings, you can use the Flatshot tool in 
the Home tab’s expanded Section panel.
Figure 20.45
Options in the Visual 
Styles panel

Turning a 3D View into a 2D AutoCAD Drawing |  701  
Set up your drawing view, and then click the Flatshot tool or enter Flatshot↵ at the command-
line interface to open the Flatshot dialog box (see Figure 20.46).
Printing Your Model Using Visual Styles
You can print a drawing that uses visual styles either from the Model tab or from a Layout tab. If 
you’re printing from the model view, click Plot from the Quick Access toolbar. Then, in the Plot dialog 
box, select the visual style from the Shade Plot drop-down list in the Shaded Viewport Options 
group. If you’re plotting from a Layout tab, select the layout viewport border, right-click, and choose 
Shade Plot from the context menu. You can select from a list of visual styles on a cascading menu. 
Once you’ve done this, plot your layout as you normally would.
Select the options that you want to use for the 2D line drawing, and then click Create. 
Depending on the options you select, you’ll be prompted to select an insertion point or indicate 
a location for an exported drawing file. The 2D line drawing will be placed on the plane of the 
current UCS, so if you are viewing your model in a 3D view but you are in the World UCS, the 
2D line drawing will appear to be projected onto the XY plane.
Figure 20.46
The Flatshot dialog box

702  | CHAPTER 20  Creating 3D Drawings  
Flatshot lets you place the 2D version of your model in the current drawing as a block, to 
replace an existing block in the current drawing, or to save the 2D version as a DWG file.  
Table 20.1 describes the Flatshot options in more detail.

One useful feature of Flatshot is that it can create a 2D drawing that displays the hidden 
lines of a 3D mechanical drawing. Turn on the Show option, and then select a linetype such as 
Hidden for obscured lines to produce a 2D drawing like the one shown in Figure 20.47.

Using the Point Cloud Feature |  703  
Using the Point Cloud Feature
As you might guess from the name, a point cloud is a set of data points in a 3D coordinate sys-
tem. They are often the product of 3D scanners, which are devices that can analyze and record 
the shape of real-world objects or environments. With point cloud data, you can reproduce an 
object or environment as a digital model that can then be used for a video game, movie produc-
tion, 3D model, or even as-built drawings.
AutoCAD lets you import raw point cloud data through a set of tools that can be found in the 
Insert tab’s Point Cloud panel (see Figure 20.48).
Figure 20.47
A sample of a 2D 
drawing generated 
from a 3D model 
using Flatshot. Note 
the dashed lines 
showing the hidden 
lines of the view.
Figure 20.48
The Point Cloud panel 
in the Insert tab
AutoCAD can import point cloud data in the form of RCP (Recap Project) or RCS (RecapScan) 
files. These file types can be produced with the Autodesk® ReCap™ program, a separate applica-
tion that comes with AutoCAD (see the sidebar “Autodesk ReCap”).

704  | CHAPTER 20  Creating 3D Drawings  
After you import the point cloud data, AutoCAD displays it in your file. To import the data, 
use the Attach tool in the Point Cloud panel on the Insert tab. If you have raw point cloud data 
that hasn’t been processed yet, click the Autodesk ReCap button to launch ReCap. Use the 
resulting dialog box to load the raw data and prepare it to use in AutoCAD.
Selecting an attached point cloud displays a bounding box around the data and activates the 
contextual Cloud Edit Ribbon tab. This tab provides a set of tools that you can use to manipulate 
your point cloud by clipping it (similar to the Clip tool), changing the point density, adjusting 
the color display of the point cloud, or running analysis tools.
Because point clouds can consume a great deal of memory, you can use the Level Of 
Detail slider in the Display panel to control the density of the point. The lower the density, 
the less impact the point cloud will have on performance. When you have the point cloud 
attached to a drawing, you can use the points to help guide you in building a 3D model. You 
can use the Node osnap to snap to the individual points in the point cloud. The referenced 
point cloud is selectable. When you do select it, a contextual Ribbon tab has several tools 
that will help you display your point cloud. It includes slider bars to increase or decrease 
the density of the points (how many are currently being displayed). You can change the 
color of the points or use any color data your scanning device may have gathered. Cropping 
tools are also available to help speed up the performance of your computer by reducing the 
number of points to process. This cropping feature can also help you control what is being 
displayed in your file.
The Bottom Line
Know the 3D Modeling workspace.    When you work in 3D, you need a different set of tools 
from those for 2D drafting. AutoCAD offers the 3D Modeling workspace, which provides the 
tools that you need to create 3D models.
Master It    Name some of the Ribbon panels that are unique to the 3D Modeling 
workspace.
Draw in 3D using solids.    AutoCAD offers a type of object called a 3D solid that lets you 
quickly create and edit shapes.
Master It    What does the Presspull command do?
Create 3D forms from 2D shapes.    The Modeling panel offers a set of basic 3D shapes, but 
other tools enable you to create virtually any shape you want from 2D drawings.
Master It    Name the command that lets you change a closed 2D polyline into a 3D solid.
Autodesk ReCap
Autodesk ReCap is an application that runs outside AutoCAD. This additional program lets you 
take raw data from 3D scans and package it in a way that AutoCAD can use. ReCap can handle 
the massive amounts of data collected from 3D scanners so that you can aggregate the scans. It 
features tools that enable you to clean up the data, sort it, compress it, and visualize it. Once this 
is accomplished, ReCap will put the data into a file format that AutoCAD can easily digest and use. 
ReCap requires users to have and log into their Autodesk® 360 account.

Setting Up AutoCAD for This Chapter
Before you start, we’d like you to set up AutoCAD in a way that will make your work a little 
easier. You’ll use the 3D Modeling workspace to which you were introduced in Chapter 20, 
“Creating 3D Drawings.” To do so, start AutoCAD. In Chapter 20, you started a new 3D model 
using a template set up for 3D modeling. Here you’ll start to work with the default 2D drawing, 
acad.dwt.
Now click the Workspace Switching button in the status bar and select 3D Modeling, as 
shown in Figure 21.1. You’ll see a new set of panels appear, as shown in Figure 21.2. The Home 
panel is different in that it now contains many of the 3D tools that we will be using. Additional 
panels include Solid, Surface, Mesh, and Visualize, which contain the 3D modeling and editing 
tools available in AutoCAD.

from the Workspace 
drop-down.
Mastering the User Coordinate System
The User Coordinate System (UCS) enables you to define a custom coordinate system in 2D and 
3D space. You’ve been using the default coordinate system called the World Coordinate System 
(WCS) all along. By now, you’re familiar with the L-shaped icon in the lower-left corner of the 
AutoCAD screen, containing a small square and the letters X and Y. The square indicates that 
you’re currently in the WCS; the X and Y indicate the positive directions of the x- and y-axes. 
The WCS is a global system of reference from which you can define other UCSs.
It may help to think of these AutoCAD UCSs as different drawing surfaces or two-dimensional  
planes. You can have several UCSs at any given time. By setting up these different UCSs, you 
can draw as you would in the WCS in 2D and still create a 3D image.
Suppose that you want to draw a house in 3D with doors and windows on each of its sides. 
You can set up a UCS for each of the sides, and then you can move from UCS to UCS to add your 
doors and windows (see Figure 21.3). In each UCS, you draw your doors and windows as you 
would in a typical 2D drawing. You can even insert elevation views of doors and windows that 
you created in other drawings.
In this chapter, you’ll experiment with several views and UCSs. All of the commands that 
you’ll use are available both at the command line and via the Visualize tab’s Coordinates panel.

Defining a UCS
In the first set of exercises, you’ll draw a chair that you can later add to your 3D unit drawing. In 
drawing this chair, you’ll be exposed to the UCS as well as to some of the other 3D capabilities 
available in AutoCAD:
	
1.	 Open the barcelona1.dwg file. Metric users should open barcelona1_metric.dwg. This 
file contains two rectangles that you’ll use to create a chair.
	
2.	 Select SW Isometric from the 3D Navigation drop-down list on the Home tab’s View panel. 
You can also type -V↵SWISO↵. This gives you a 3D view from the lower-left corner of the 
rectangles, as shown in Figure 21.4. Zoom out a bit to give yourself some room to work.

3.	 Select the two rectangles, and then right-click and select Properties.
	
4.	 In the Properties palette, enter 3 in the Thickness setting and press ↵. This gives the seat 
and back a thickness of 3″. Metric users should make the thickness 7.6 cm.
	
5.	 Press the Esc key, and close the Properties palette. Click the Convert To Solid tool in the 
Home tab’s expanded Solid Editing panel.
	
6.	 Select the two rectangles, and then press ↵.
Notice that the UCS icon appears in the same plane as the current coordinate system. The 
icon will help you keep track of which coordinate system you’re in. Now you can see the chair 
components as 3D objects.
Next, you’ll define a UCS that is aligned with one side of the seat:
	
1.	 Click UCS ➢ Named UCS in the Visualize tab’s Coordinates panel or type Ucsman↵ to 
open the UCS dialog box.
	
2.	 Select the Orthographic UCSs tab to view a set of predefined UCSs.
	
3.	 Select Front in the list box, as shown in Figure 21.5. Figure 21.6 shows the orientation of 
the Front UCS.

4.	 Click the Set Current button to make the Front UCS current.
	
5.	 Click OK to close the dialog box.
The Orthographic UCSs tab offers a set of predefined UCSs for each of the six standard ortho-
graphic projection planes. Figure 21.6 shows these UCSs in relation to the WCS.
Because a good part of 3D work involves drawing in these orthographic planes, AutoCAD 
supplies the ready-made UCS orientations for quick access. But you aren’t limited to these six 
orientations. If you’re familiar with mechanical drafting, you’ll see that the orthographic UCSs 
correspond to the typical orthographic projections used in mechanical drafting. If you’re an 
architect, the Front, Left, Back, and Right UCSs correspond to the south, west, north, and east 
elevations of a building.
Before you continue building the chair model, you’ll move the UCS to the surface on which 
you’ll be working. Right now, the UCS has its origin located in the same place as the WCS origin.
You can move a UCS so that its origin is anywhere in the drawing:
	
1.	 Click the Origin tool in the Visualize tab’s Coordinates panel, or type UCS↵O↵.
	
2.	 At the Specify new origin point <0,0,0>: prompt, use the Endpoint osnap, and click 
the bottom-front corner of the chair seat, as shown in Figure 21.7. The UCS icon moves to 
indicate its new origin’s location. If you typed in the command, press Enter to accept the 
other default values.
Figure 21.7
Setting up a UCS
Click this corner for the new UCS origin.
You just created a new UCS based on the Front UCS that you selected from the UCS dialog 
box. Now, as you move your cursor, the origin of the UCS icon corresponds to a 0,0 coordinate. 
Although you have a new UCS, the WCS still exists; you can always return to it when you 
need to.
Saving a UCS
After you’ve gone through the work of creating a UCS, you may want to save it—especially if 
you think that you’ll come back to it later. Here’s how to save a UCS:
	
1.	 Choose Named from the Coordinates panel or type Ucsman↵ to open the UCS 
dialog box.

712  | CHAPTER 21  Using Advanced 3D Features   
	
2.	 Make sure that the Named UCSs tab is selected, and then highlight the Unnamed option 
in the Current UCS list box.
	
3.	 Click the word Unnamed. The item changes to allow editing.
	
4.	 Type 3DSW↵ for the name of your new UCS.
	
5.	 Click OK to exit the dialog box.
Your UCS is now saved with the name 3DSW. You can recall it from the UCS dialog box or by 
using other methods that you’ll learn about later in this chapter.
Working in a UCS
Next, you’ll arrange the seat and back and draw the legs of the chair. Your UCS is oriented so 
that you can easily adjust the orientation of the chair components. As you work through the next 
exercise, notice that, although you’re manipulating 3D objects, you’re really using the same tools 
that you’ve used to edit 2D objects.
Follow these steps to adjust the seat and back and to draw legs:
	
1.	 Click the seat back to expose its grips. The seat back is the box to the right.
	
2.	 Click the bottom grip, as shown in the first image in Figure 21.8.

Click here.
Click here to
start the rotation.

Mastering the User Coordinate System |  713  
	
3.	 Right-click to open the Grip Edit context menu.
	
4.	 Choose Rotate from the menu. The seat back now rotates with the movement of the 
cursor. It rotates in the plane of the new UCS you created earlier.
	
5.	 Type 80↵ to rotate the seat back 80. Your view looks like the second image in Figure 21.8.
	
6.	 Click the bottom grip, as shown in the second image in Figure 21.8.
	
7.	 Right-click again and choose Move.
	
8.	 Using the Endpoint osnap, click the bottom-rear corner of the chair seat to join the chair 
back to the seat, as shown in the second image in Figure 21.8.
	
9.	 Click the chair seat, making sure that the chair back is also selected; then click the 
bottom-corner grip of the seat, as shown in the third image in Figure 21.8.
	
10.	 Right-click and choose Rotate from the Grip Edit context menu.
	
11.	 Enter -10↵ to rotate both the seat and back negative 10. Press the Esc key to clear the grips. 
Your chair looks like Figure 21.9.
Figure 21.9
The chair after rotating 
and moving the 
components
The new UCS orientation enabled you to use the grips to adjust the chair seat and back. All of 
the grip rotation in the previous exercise was confined to the plane of the new UCS. Mirroring 
and scaling will also occur in relation to the current UCS.
Building 3D Parts in Separate Files
As you work in 3D, your models will become fairly complex. When your model becomes too 
crowded for you to see things clearly, it helps to build parts of the model and then import them 
instead of building everything in one file. In the next set of exercises, you’ll draw the legs of the 
chair and then import them to the main chair file to give you some practice in the procedure.
We’ve prepared a drawing called legs.dwg, which consists of two polylines that describe the 
shape of the legs. We did this to save you some tedious work that isn’t related to 3D modeling. 

714  | CHAPTER 21  Using Advanced 3D Features   
You’ll use this file as a starting point for the legs, and then you’ll import the legs into the  
barcelona1.dwg file:
	
1.	 Open the legs.dwg file. Metric users should open the legs_metric.dwg file. The file 
consists of two polyline splines that are in the shape of one set of legs. You’ll turn these 
simple lines into 3D solids.
	
2.	 Click the Edit Polyline tool in the Home tab’s expanded Modify panel.
	
3.	 At the Select polyline or [Multiple]: prompt, enter M↵ to select multiple polylines. 
Then select the two polylines and press ↵.
	
4.	 At the Enter an option [Close/Open/Join/Width/Fit/Spline/Decurve/Ltype gen/
Reverse/Undo]: prompt, enter W↵.
	
5.	 At the Specify new width for all segments: prompt, enter 0.5↵ to give the polylines 
a width of 0.5″. Metric users should enter 1.27↵.
	
6.	 Press ↵ to exit the Pedit command.
Next you need to change the Thickness property of the two polylines to make them 2″, or 
5 cm, wide:
	
1.	 With the two polylines selected, open the Properties palette and set their thickness to 2. 
Metric users should set their thickness to 5.
	
2.	 Close the Properties palette, or you can leave it open for the next exercise.
	
3.	 Click the Convert To Solid tool in the Home tab’s expanded Solid Editing panel, or enter 
convtosolid↵ at the Command prompt.
	
4.	 Select the two polylines if they’re not already selected, and then press ↵. The lines 
become 3D solids.
	
5.	 Click the Solid, Union tool in the Home tab’s Solid Editing panel, select the two legs, and 
press ↵. The two legs are now a single 3D solid, as shown in Figure 21.10.
Figure 21.10
The polylines 
converted to 3D solids

Mastering the User Coordinate System |  715  
As you’ve just seen, you can convert polylines that have both a width and a thickness into 3D 
solids. Now you’re ready to add the legs to the rest of the chair:
	
1.	 Click the Tile Vertically tool in the View tab’s User Interface panel. You see the legs draw-
ing on the left and the rest of the chair on the right.
	
2.	 Adjust the views so that your screen looks similar to Figure 21.11. If you see a third 
Drawing1.dwg panel, or if you see the Start Tab, minimize it and click the Tile Vertically 
tool again.
Figure 21.11
Click and drag the leg 
from the left window 
to the right window, 
and align the leg with 
the chair seat and 
back.
	
3.	 Click in the barcelona1 drawing, and select Extents from the Zoom flyout Navigation 
bar to get an overall view of the chair so far.
	
4.	 Click in the legs drawing, and then click the legs 3D solid to select it.
	
5.	 Click and hold the cursor on the legs until you see the arrow cursor with a small 
rectangle.
	
6.	 When you see the rectangle, drag the mouse into the barcelona1 drawing. The legs 
appear in the proper orientation.
	
7.	 Release the mouse button to place the legs in the barcelona1 drawing. You don’t need to 
be precise about placing the legs; you can move them into position next.
	
8.	 Use the Move tool to move the legs so that the endpoint of the horizontal leg joins the 
chair seat, as shown in the image in the right panel of Figure 21.11.
	
9.	 Save and close the legs.dwg file, and expand the barcelona1.dwg file to fill the 
AutoCAD window.
Use Copy and Paste
You can also use Copy and Paste to copy the legs to the barcelona1 drawing. In step 4, right-click 
and select Copy from the context menu. Skip steps 5 through 7 and instead click in the barcelona1 
drawing, right-click, and select Paste.

716  | CHAPTER 21  Using Advanced 3D Features   
In these last few exercises, you worked on the legs of the chair in a separate file and then 
imported them into the main chair file with a click-and-drag motion. By working on parts in 
separate files, you can keep your model organized and more manageable. You may have also 
noticed that although the legs were drawn in the WCS, they were inserted in the 3DSW UCS that 
you created earlier. This shows you that imported objects are placed in the current UCS. The 
same would have happened if you inserted an Xref or another file.
Understanding the UCS Options
You’ve seen how to select a UCS from a set of predefined UCSs. You can frequently use these 
preset UCSs and make minor adjustments to them to get the exact UCS you want.
You can define a UCS in other ways. You can, for example, use the surface of your chair seat 
to define the orientation of a UCS. In the following sections, you’ll be shown the various ways 
that you can set up a UCS. Learning how to move effortlessly between UCSs is crucial to master-
ing the creation of 3D models, so you’ll want to pay special attention to the command options 
shown in these examples.
Note that these examples are for your reference. You can try them out on your own model. 
These options are accessible from the Visualize tab’s Coordinates panel.
UCS Based on Object Orientation
You can define a UCS based on the orientation of an object. This is helpful when you want to 
work on a predefined object to fill in details on its surface plane. The following steps are for 
information only and aren’t part of the tutorial. You can try this at another time when you aren’t 
working through an exercise.
Follow these steps to define a UCS this way:
	
1.	 Type UCS↵ OB↵.
	
2.	 At the Select object to align UCS: prompt, pick the object that you want to use to 
define the UCS. For example, you could click a 3D solid that you want to edit. The UCS 
icon shifts to reflect the new coordinate system’s orientation. Figure 21.12 shows an  
example of using the OB option to select the edge of the chair back.
Figure 21.12

option of the UCS com-
mand to locate a UCS
Click this edge.
When you use the Object
option, the UCS will align
to the selected object.

Understanding the UCS Options |  717  
Controlling the UCS Icon
If the UCS icon isn’t behaving as described in this chapter’s exercises, chances are that its settings 
have been altered. You can control the behavior of the UCS icon through the UCS dialog box. To 
open the UCS dialog box, click Named in the Visualize tab’s Coordinates panel or type Ucsman↵; 
then click the Settings tab.
The settings in the UCS Icon Settings group affect the way the UCS icon behaves. Normally, the 
On and Display At UCS Origin Point check boxes are selected. If On isn’t selected, you won’t see 
the UCS icon. If the Display At UCS Origin Point check box isn’t selected, the UCS icon remains  
in the lower-left corner of the drawing window no matter where its origin is placed in the drawing.
If you have multiple viewports set up in a drawing, you can set these two options independently for 
each viewport. The third option, Apply To All Active Viewports, forces the first two settings to apply 
in all viewports. We will discuss the fourth option, Allow Selecting UCS icon, later in this chapter.
Two more options appear in the UCS Settings group. If you have multiple viewports open, the Save 
UCS With Viewport option enables AutoCAD to maintain a separate UCS for each viewport. The 
Update View To Plan When UCS Is Changed option forces the display to show a plan view of the 
current UCS. This means that if you change a UCS orientation, AutoCAD automatically shows a 
plan view of the new UCS orientation. This option also forces viewport views to show the extents 
of plan views. If you find that your views are automatically zooming to extents when you don’t 
want them to, turn off this setting.
Another tool for controlling the UCS icon is the UCS Icon dialog box. To open it, right-click the UCS 
Icon, click UCS Icon Settings, click Properties, and in the resulting dialog box, or enter Ucsicon↵P↵.
Using this dialog box, you can fine-tune the appearance of the UCS icon, including its size and 
color. The 2D radio button in the UCS Icon Style group changes the UCS icon to the old-style UCS 
icon used in earlier versions of AutoCAD.
When you create a UCS using the Object option, the location of the UCS origin and its orienta- 
tion depend on how the selected object was created. Table 21.1 describes how an object can 
determine the orientation of a UCS.

718  | CHAPTER 21  Using Advanced 3D Features   
Table 21.1:	
Effects of objects on the orientation of a UCS
Object type
UCS orientation
Arc
The center of the arc establishes the UCS origin. The x-axis of the UCS passes 
through the pick point on the arc.
Circle
The center of the circle establishes the UCS origin. The x-axis of the UCS passes 
through the pick point on the circle.
Dimension
The midpoint of the dimension text establishes the UCS origin. The x-axis of 
the UCS is parallel to the x-axis that was active when the dimension was 
drawn.
Face (of a 3D solid)
The origin of the UCS is placed on a quadrant of a circular surface or on the 
corner of a polygonal surface.
Line
The endpoint nearest the pick point establishes the origin of the UCS, and the 
XZ plane of the UCS contains the line.
Point
The point location establishes the UCS origin. The UCS orientation is arbitrary.
2D polyline
The starting point of the polyline establishes the UCS origin. The x-axis is 
determined by the direction from the first point to the next vertex.
3D polyline
Returns the message This object does not define a coordinate 
system.
Spline
The UCS is created with its XY plane parallel to the XY plane of the UCS that 
was current when the spline was created.
Solid
The first point of the solid establishes the origin of the UCS. The second point 
of the solid establishes the x-axis.
Trace
The direction of the trace establishes the x-axis of the UCS, and the beginning 
point sets the origin.
3D Face
The first point of the 3D face establishes the origin. The first and second points 
establish the x-axis. The plane defined by the 3D face determines the orienta-
tion of the UCS.
Shapes, text, blocks, 
attributes, and attribute 
definitions
The insertion point establishes the origin of the UCS. The object’s rotation 
angle establishes the x-axis.
UCS Based on Offset Orientation
At times, you may want to work in a UCS that has the same orientation as the current UCS but is 
offset. For example, you might be drawing a building that has several parallel walls offset with a 
sawtooth effect (see Figure 21.13).

Understanding the UCS Options |  719  
You can easily hop from one UCS to a new, parallel UCS by using the Origin option. Click 
the Origin tool in the Coordinates panel, or type UCS↵O. At the Specify new origin point 
<0,0,0>: prompt, pick the new origin for your UCS.
Another UCS option, called Move, will move an existing, named UCS to a new location and 
keep its original orientation. You won’t find the UCS Move option on any panel or toolbar, but 
you can use it by entering UCS↵M↵ at the Command prompt.
The steps in the following section are for information only and aren’t part of the exercise. 
Again, you can try this at another time when you aren’t working through an exercise.
UCS Rotated Around an Axis
Suppose that you want to change the orientation of the x-, y-, or z-axis of a UCS. You can do so 
by using the X, Y, or Z flyout on the Visualize tab’s Coordinates panel. These are perhaps among 
the most frequently used UCS options:
	
1.	 Click the X tool flyout arrowhead in the Visualize tab’s Coordinates panel, and select Z 
from the flyout. You can also type UCS↵Z↵. This enables you to rotate the current UCS 
around the z-axis.
	
2.	 At the Specify rotation angle about Z axis <90>: prompt, press ↵ to accept the 
default of 90. The UCS icon rotates about the z-axis to reflect the new orientation of the 
current UCS (see Figure 21.14).
Figure 21.13

option to shift the UCS

720  | CHAPTER 21  Using Advanced 3D Features   
Similarly, the X and Y options let you rotate the UCS about the current x- and y-axis, respec-
tively, just as you did for the z-axis earlier. The X and Y tools are helpful in orienting a UCS to an 
inclined plane. For example, if you want to work on the plane of a sloped roof of a building, you 
can first use the Origin UCS tool to align the UCS to the edge of a roof and then use the X tool 
to rotate the UCS to the angle of the roof slope, as shown in Figure 21.15. Note that the default is 
90°, so you only have to press ↵ to rotate the UCS 90°, but you can also enter a rotation angle.
Figure 21.14

about the z-axis
Figure 21.15
Moving a UCS to the 
plane of a sloping roof
Slope of roof
Finally, you align the z-axis between two points using the Z-Axis Vector option. This is use-
ful when you have objects in the drawing that you can use to align the z-axis. Here are the steps:
	
1.	 Click the Z-Axis Vector tool in the Coordinates panel, or type UCS↵ZA↵.
	
2.	 At the Specify new origin point or [Object]<0,0,0>: prompt, press ↵ to accept the 
default, which is the current UCS origin, or you can select a new origin.

Understanding the UCS Options |  721  
	
3.	 At the prompt
Specify point on positive portion of Z-axis
<0′-0″, 0′-0″, 0′-1″>:
select another point to indicate the z-axis orientation. Figure 21.16 shows the resulting UCS if 
you use the bottom of the barcelona1 chair leg to define the z-axis.
Figure 21.16
Picking points for the 
Z-Axis Vector tool
Origin
Endpoint of chair leg for the
positive portion of the z-axis
Because your cursor location is in the plane of the current UCS, it’s best to pick a point on an 
object by using either the Osnap overrides or the coordinate filters.
Orienting a UCS in the View Plane
Finally, you can define a UCS in the current view plane. This points the z-axis toward the user. 
This approach is useful if you want to switch quickly to the current view plane for editing or for 
adding text to a 3D view.
Click the View tool in the Coordinates panel, or type UCS↵V↵. Note that the View tool also 
has a flyout arrowhead that contains the Object and Face tools. If you accidentally click the fly-
out arrowhead, make sure to click the View tool in the flyout. The UCS icon changes to show 
that the UCS is aligned with the current view.
AutoCAD uses the current UCS origin point for the origin of the new UCS. By defining a 
view as a UCS, you can enter text to label your drawing, just as you would in a technical illustra-
tion. Text entered in a plane created this way appears normal.
You’ve finished your tour of the UCS command. Set the UCS back to the WCS by clicking the 
UCS World tool in the Visualize tab’s Coordinates panel, and save the barcelona1.dwg file.
You’ve explored nearly every option in creating a UCS except one. Later in this chapter, you’ll 
learn about the 3-Point option for creating a UCS. This is the most versatile method for creating 
a UCS, but it’s more involved than some of the other UCS options.
Manipulating the UCS Icon
The UCS icon displays the direction of the axes in your drawing file. You can also directly 
manipulate it by selecting and right-clicking it or by using its multifunction grips. If your UCS 
icon is not selectable, or to turn off this selectable feature, open the UCS dialog box (click Named 
in the Visualize tab’s Coordinates panel), click the Settings tab, and see if the Allow Selecting 
UCS Icon option is checked (see Figure 21.17).

722  | CHAPTER 21  Using Advanced 3D Features   
Figure 21.17
Making the UCS icon 
selectable
There are essentially two selection options on the icon: the origin and the end of an axis. In 
either case, select the UCS icon, and then place your cursor over the appropriate grip and click 
the origin or endpoint (see Figure 21.18). Select how you want to change the UCS (move and align) 
and move the cursor. The UCS icon will relocate, showing you where your new coordinate system 
will be. You can move the origin to a new location or align it to another object or surface using 
this method. This makes working in a 3D environment a bit easier. Selecting the origin also lets 
you return the current UCS to the World Coordinate System (it resets the UCS). The x-, y-, and 
z-axes all work the same way. Pick the endpoint of the axis (the grip) to rotate the selected axis 
about the other axis (for example, if the x-axis is selected, it can rotate about either the y- or z-axis).
Figure 21.18
Selecting and moving 
the UCS icon will alter 
your UCS.
When you right-click the UCS icon, you will see a context menu containing a list of the UCS 
commands that you can choose without having to leave the drawing area. Pick the UCS com-
mand that you want to access.
Saving a UCS with a View
In AutoCAD, you can save a UCS with a view. Either click the View Manager option in the in-
canvas View Controls (top-left corner of the drawing area) or click the View Manager option at 
the bottom of the 3D Navigation drop-down list in the Home tab’s View panel (see Figure 21.19).  
In the View Manager dialog box, click the New button. This opens the New View/Shot 
Properties dialog box. Enter a name for your new view in the View Name box, and then choose 
a UCS to save with a new view by using the UCS drop-down list in the Settings group of the 
dialog box. Click OK to complete.

Using Viewports to Aid in 3D Drawing
In Chapter 15, “Laying Out Your Printer Output,” you worked extensively with floating view-
ports in paper space. In this section, you’ll use tiled viewports to see your 3D model from 
several sides at the same time. This is helpful in both creating and editing 3D drawings because 
it enables you to refer to different portions of the drawing without having to change views.
Tiled viewports are created directly in model space, as you’ll see in the following exercise:
	
1.	 Click the Named tool in the Visualize tab’s Model Viewports panel to open the Viewports 
dialog box (see Figure 21.20).
Figure 21.20
The Viewports dialog 
box

724  | CHAPTER 21  Using Advanced 3D Features   
	
2.	 Make sure that the New Viewports tab is selected, and then select Three: Right from the 
Standard Viewports list on the left.
The window on the right changes to display a sample of the viewport configuration. It 
shows three rectangles, which represent the viewports, arranged with two on the left and 
one larger one to the right. Each rectangle is labeled as Current; this tells you that the cur-
rent view will be placed in each viewport.
	
3.	 Open the Setup drop-down list at the bottom of the dialog box and select 3D.
The labels in the viewport sample change to indicate Top, Front, and SE Isometric. This is 
close to the arrangement that you want, but you need to make one more adjustment. The 
viewport to the right, SE Isometric, will show the back side of the chair. You want an SW 
Isometric view in this window.
	
4.	 Click the SE Isometric viewport sample. The sample viewport border changes to a double 
border to indicate that it’s selected.
	
5.	 Open the Change View To drop-down list just below the sample viewports, and select 
SW Isometric. The label in the selected viewport changes to let you know that the 
view will now contain the SW Isometric view. If your viewport samples do not match 
Figure 21.21, repeat step 4 and step 5 with the two viewports on the left to change them.
The Change View To list contains the standard four isometric views and the six orthogo-
nal views. By clicking a sample viewport and selecting an option from the Change View 
To drop-down list, you can arrange your viewport views nearly any way that you want.
	
6.	 To name this viewport arrangement, enter My Viewport Setup in the New Name box.
	
7.	 Click OK. Your display changes to show three viewports arranged as they were indicated 
in the Viewports dialog box (see Figure 21.21).
Figure 21.21
Three viewports, each 
displaying a different 
view
You’ve set up your viewports. Let’s check to see that your viewport arrangement was saved:
	
1.	 Click the Named tool in the Visualize tab’s Model Viewports panel to open the Viewports 
dialog box again.
	
2.	 Click the Named Viewports tab. My Viewport Setup is listed in the Named Viewports list 
box. If you click it, a sample view of your viewport arrangement appears on the right.
	
3.	 After you’ve reviewed the addition to the Named Viewports list, close the dialog box.

Using Viewports to Aid in 3D Drawing |  725  
Now take a close look at your viewport setup. The UCS icon in the orthogonal views in the 
two left viewports is oriented to the plane of the view. AutoCAD lets you set up a different UCS 
for each viewport. The top view uses the WCS because it’s in the same plane as the WCS. The 
side view has its own UCS, which is parallel to its view. The isometric view to the right retains 
the current UCS.
A Viewports dialog box option that you haven’t tried yet is the Apply To drop-down list in 
the New Viewports tab (see Figure 21.22).
Figure 21.22
The Apply To 
drop-down list
This list shows two options: Display and Current Viewport. When Display is selected, 
the option you choose from the Standard Viewports list applies to the overall display. When 
Current Viewport is selected, the option you select applies to the selected viewport in the sam-
ple view in the right side of the dialog box. You can use the Current Viewport option to build 
multiple viewports in custom arrangements.
You have the legs for one side. The next step is to mirror those legs for the other side:
	
1.	 Click the top view of the chair in the upper-left viewport.
	
2.	 Turn on Polar Tracking in the status bar, and then click the Mirror tool in the Home tab’s 
expanded Modify panel.
	
3.	 In the upper-left viewport, click the 3D solid representing the chair legs and then press ↵.
	
4.	 At the Specify first point of mirror line: prompt, use the Midpoint osnap and 
select the midpoint of the chair seat, as shown in Figure 21.23.
Figure 21.23

from one side to 
another
Click the midpoint of this edge.
	
5.	 At the Specify second point of mirror line: prompt, pick any location to the right 
of the point that you selected so that the rubber-banding line is exactly horizontal.

726  | CHAPTER 21  Using Advanced 3D Features   
	
6.	 Press ↵ at the Erase source objects? [Yes/No] <N>: prompt. The legs are mirrored 
to the opposite side of the chair. Your screen should look similar to Figure 21.23.
Your chair is complete. Let’s finish by getting a better look at it:
	
1.	 Click the viewport to the right showing the isometric view.
	
2.	 Choose Single from the Viewport Configurations List drop-down list in the Visualize 
tab’s Model Viewports panel (see Figure 21.24), or enter -Vports↵Si↵.
Figure 21.24
Click Single in 
the Viewport

3.	 Use the Zoom tool to adjust your view so that it looks similar to Figure 21.25.

4.	 Click the Visual Styles drop-down list, and select Shades Of Gray. Note that your back-
ground may appear much darker.
	
5.	 Exit the file. You can save if you like or close without saving in case you want to do the 
exercise again.
Using the Array Tools
In Chapter 6, “Editing and Reusing Data to Work Efficiently,” you were introduced to the Array 
command. Let’s take a look at how this works in the 3D world. In AutoCAD 2017, you can create 
a 3D array from any type of array, whether it is rectangular, polar, or path. Let’s do an example 
using the path array:
	
1.	 Open the file 3Dseating.dwg. Make sure that Selection Cycling is turned off for these 
exercises.
	
2.	 Click the Path Array tool in the Array flyout on the Modify panel of the Home tab, or 
type ARRAYPATH↵.
	
3.	 At the Select objects: prompt, click the chair at the left end of the arc in the drawing 
and then press ↵.
	
4.	 At the Select path curve: prompt, select the magenta arc toward the left end.
	
5.	 At the Select grip to edit array or [Associative/Method/Base point/Tangent 
direction/Items/Rows/Levels/Align items/Z direction/eXit] <eXit>: prompt, 
enter I↵.
	
6.	 At the Specify the distance between items along path or [Expression] 
<35.7596>: prompt, press ↵.
	
7.	 At the Specify number of items or [Fill entire path / Expression] <6>: 
prompt, enter 5↵.
	
8.	 At the Select grip to edit array or [ASsociative/Method/Base point  Tangent 
direction/Items/Rows/Levels/Align items/Z direction ] <eXit>: prompt, 
enter R↵.
	
9.	 At the Enter the number of rows or [Expression] <1>: prompt, enter 3↵.
	
10.	 At the Specify the distance between rows or [Total / Expression] <40.7253>: 
prompt, enter 48↵.
	
11.	 At the Specify the incrementing elevation between rows or [Expression] 
<0.0000>: prompt, enter 12↵.
	
12.	 Press ↵ to exit the command.
In this exercise, you made an array of a chair that follows the path of an arc. The distance 
between chairs is 48″ (1219.2 mm), and the vertical riser between each section is 12″ (304.8 mm).
Certiﬁcation
Objective

728  | CHAPTER 21  Using Advanced 3D Features   
Now suppose that you want to adjust the curvature of your array. This is a simple matter of 
adjusting the shape of the arc, as described here:
	
1.	 Click the arc to expose its grips.
	
2.	 Click the middle grip, and then drag it upward. Notice that all the chairs adjust as you 
drag the arc.
Here you see how the associative feature of the Arraypath command lets you control the 
array by adjusting the object that you used for the path. Arrays can be edited through a variety 
of methods, as you’ll see in the next section.
Making Changes to an Associative Array
Now let’s take a look at how you can make changes to an array. You may have noticed the Associative 
option in the Array command’s prompt. By default, the Associative option is turned on, which 
enables you to edit array objects as a group. You’ll see how this works in the following exercises.
You’ll start by editing the array that you created using the Path Array tool. You’ll see that the 
chairs are now skewed and are no longer pointing to the center of the arc. You can realign them 
by making a simple change to the original chair.
The following steps show you how this is done:
	
1.	 Click the array of chairs. Notice that the contextual Array ribbon tab appears (see Figure 21.26).
Figure 21.26
The Array ribbon tab 
appears, and a new set 
of panels and options 
is displayed.
We’ll change the number of chairs to allow for more seating.
	
2.	 In the contextual Array ribbon tab in the Properties panel, change from Measure Method 
to Divide Method by clicking the flyout arrow below the Measure button. Select the 
Divide Method button. The chairs will automatically space themselves along the curve. 
In the Items panel, change the item count from 5 to 10 and press the Tab key.
The number of chairs dynamically changes to the new value.
	
3.	 Save the file.
Experiment with other values in the Array ribbon tab to see what effects they have.
As you can see from these exercises, you can easily make changes to an array through the 
Array ribbon tab options in the Ribbon. Many of these options are also available through the 
multifunction grip menus when you have Dynamic Input turned on.
Creating Complex 3D Surfaces
In one of the previous exercises, you drew a chair composed of objects that were mostly straight 
lines or curves with a thickness. All of the forms in that chair were defined in planes perpendic-
ular to one another. For a 3D model such as this, you can get by using the orthographic UCSs. At 

Creating Complex 3D Surfaces |  729  
times, however, you’ll want to draw objects that don’t fit so easily into perpendicular or parallel 
planes. In the following sections, you’ll create more complex forms by using some of the other 
3D commands in AutoCAD.
Laying Out a 3D Form
In this next group of exercises, you’ll draw a butterfly chair. This chair has no perpendicular 
or parallel planes with which to work, so you’ll start by setting up some points that you’ll 
use for reference only. This is similar in concept to laying out a 2D drawing. As you prog-
ress through the drawing construction, notice how the reference points are established to 
help create the chair. You’ll also construct some temporary 3D lines to use for reference. 
These temporary lines will be your layout. These points will define the major UCSs needed 
to construct the drawing. The main point is to show you some of the options for creating 
and saving UCSs.
To save time, we’ve created the 2D drawing that you’ll use to build your 3D layout. This 
drawing consists of two rectangles that are offset by 4″ (10 cm). To make it more interesting, 
they’re also off-center from each other (see Figure 21.27).
Figure 21.27
Setting up a layout for 
a butterfly chair
The first thing that you’ll need to do is to set up the drawing for the layout:
	
1.	 Open the butterfly1.dwg file. Metric users should open butterfly1-metric.dwg.
	
2.	 Click SW Isometric in the 3D Navigation drop-down list, or type –V↵SWISO↵. This 
gives you a view from the lower-left side of the rectangles.
	
3.	 Zoom out so that the rectangles occupy about a third of the drawing area window.
Now you need to move the outer rectangle in the z-axis so that its elevation is 30″ (76 cm):
	
1.	 Click the outer rectangle, and then click one of its grips.
	
2.	 Right-click to open the Grip Edit context menu.
	
3.	 Choose Move, and then enter @0,0,30↵; metric users should enter @0,0,76↵. This tells 
AutoCAD to move the rectangle a 0 distance in both the x- and y-axes and 30″ (or 76 cm) 
in the z-axis.
	
4.	 Pan your view downward so that it looks similar to Figure 21.28.

730  | CHAPTER 21  Using Advanced 3D Features   
	
5.	 Use the Line tool to draw lines from the corners of the outer square to the corners of the 
inner square. Use the Endpoint osnap to select the exact corners of the squares. This is the 
layout for your chair—not the finished product.
As an alternate method in step 3, after choosing Move from the Grip Edit context menu, you 
can turn on Ortho mode and point the cursor vertically so that it shows –Z in the coordinate 
readout. Then enter 30↵ (76↵ for metric users).
Spherical and Cylindrical Coordinate Formats
In the previous exercise, you used relative Cartesian coordinates to locate the second point for 
the Move command. For commands that accept 3D input, you can also specify displacements by 
using the Spherical and Cylindrical Coordinate formats.
The Spherical Coordinate format lets you specify a distance in 3D space while specifying the 
angle in terms of degrees from the x-axis of the current UCS and degrees from the XY plane 
of the current UCS (see the top image in Figure 21.29). For example, to specify a distance of 
4.5″ (11.43 cm) at a 30° angle from the x-axis and 45° from the XY plane, enter @4.5<30<45 (or 
@11.43<30<45 for metric users). This refers to the direct distance followed by a < symbol, then 
the angle from the x-axis of the current UCS followed by another < symbol, and then the angle 
from the XY plane of the current UCS. To use the Spherical Coordinate format to move the 
rectangle in the exercise, enter @30<0<90 (or @76<0<90 for metric users) at the Second point: 
prompt.
The Cylindrical Coordinate format, on the other hand, lets you specify a location in terms of 
a distance in the plane of the current UCS and a distance in the z-axis. You also specify an 
angle from the x-axis of the current UCS (see the bottom image in Figure 21.29). For example, 
to locate a point that is a distance of 4.5″ (11.43 cm) in the plane of the current UCS at an 
angle of 30° from the x-axis and a distance of 3.3″ (8.38 cm) in the z-axis, enter @4.5<30,3.3 
(or @11.43<30,8.38 for metric users). This refers to the distance of the displacement from the 
plane of the current UCS followed by the < symbol, then the angle from the x-axis followed 
by a comma, and then the distance in the z-axis. Using the Cylindrical Coordinate format to 
move the rectangle, you enter @0<0,30 (or @0<0,76 for metric users) at the Second point: 
prompt.

Using a 3D Polyline
Now you’ll draw the legs for the butterfly chair by using a 3D polyline. This is a polyline that 
can be drawn in 3D space. Here are the steps:
	
1.	 Click 3D Polyline in the Home tab’s Draw panel, or type 3P↵.

732  | CHAPTER 21  Using Advanced 3D Features   
	
2.	 At the Specify start point of polyline: prompt, pick a series of points, as shown in 
Figure 21.30 (top), by using the Endpoint and Midpoint osnaps. Use the Close option to 
close the series of lines.

3.	 Draw another 3D polyline in the mirror image of the first (see the lower image in 
Figure 21.30).
	
4.	 Erase the connecting vertical lines that make up the frame, but keep the rectangles. You’ll 
use them later.
All objects, with the exception of lines and 3D polylines, are restricted to the plane of your 
current UCS. Two other legacy 3D objects, 3D faces and 3D meshes, are also restricted. You can 
use the Pline command to draw polylines in only one plane, but you can use the 3DPoly com-
mand to create a polyline in three dimensions. 3DPoly objects cannot, however, be given thick-
ness or width.

Creating Complex 3D Surfaces |  733  
Creating a Curved 3D Surface
Next, you’ll draw the seat of the chair. The seat of a butterfly chair is usually made of canvas, 
and it drapes from the four corners of the chair legs. You’ll first define the perimeter of the 
seat by using arcs, and then you’ll use the Edge Surface tool in the Home tab’s Modeling panel 
to form the shape of the draped canvas. The Edge Surface tool creates a surface based on four 
objects defining the edges of that surface. In this example, you’ll use arcs to define the edges of 
the seat.
To draw the arcs defining the seat edges, you must first establish the UCSs in the planes of 
those edges. In the previous example, you created a UCS for the side of the chair before you 
could draw the legs. In the same way, you must create a UCS defining the planes that contain 
the edges of the seat.
Because the UCS that you want to define isn’t orthogonal, you’ll need to use the 3-point 
method. This lets you define the plane of the UCS based on three points:
	
1.	 Click the 3-Point tool on the Visualize tab’s Coordinates panel, or type UCS↵3↵. With 
this option, you can define a UCS based on three points that you select. Remember, it 
helps to think of a UCS as a drawing surface situated on the surface of the object that you 
want to draw or edit.
	
2.	 At the Specify new origin point <0,0,0>: prompt, use the Endpoint osnap to pick 
the bottom of the chair leg to the far left, as shown in the left image of Figure 21.31. This  
is the origin point of your new UCS.

3.	 At the Specify point on positive portion of X-axis: prompt, use the Endpoint 
osnap to pick the bottom of the next leg to the right of the first one, as shown in the left 
image in Figure 21.31.
	
4.	 At the Specify point on positive-Y portion of the UCS XY plane: prompt, pick 
the top corner of the butterfly chair seat, as shown in the left image in Figure 21.31. The 
UCS icon changes to indicate your new UCS.
	
5.	 Now that you’ve defined a UCS, you need to save it so that you can return to it later. Click 
UCS ➢ Named UCS in the Visualize tab’s Coordinates panel, or type UC↵ to open the 
UCS dialog box.
	
6.	 With the Named UCSs tab selected, right-click the Unnamed item in the list box and 
choose Rename from the context menu.

734  | CHAPTER 21  Using Advanced 3D Features   
	
7.	 Enter Front↵.
	
8.	 Click OK to exit the UCS dialog box.
You’ve defined and saved a UCS for the front side of the chair. As you can see from the UCS 
icon, this UCS is at a nonorthogonal angle to the WCS. Continue by creating UCSs for two more 
sides of the butterfly chair.
	
1.	 Define a UCS for the side of the chair, as shown in the middle image in Figure 21.31. Use 
the UCS dialog box to rename this UCS Side, just as you did for Front in steps 5 through 8 
in the previous exercise. Remember that you renamed the unnamed UCS.
	
2.	 Repeat these steps for a UCS for the back of the chair, named Back. Use the right image in 
Figure 21.31 for reference.
	
3.	 Open the UCS dialog box again. In the Named UCSs tab, highlight Front.
	
4.	 Click the Set Current button, and then click OK. This activates Front as the current UCS.
	
5.	 Click the Start, End, Direction tool from the Arc flyout in the Home tab’s Draw panel.
	
6.	 Draw the arc defining the front edge of the chair (see Figure 21.32). Use the Endpoint 
osnap override to pick the top endpoints of the chair legs as the endpoints of the arc.

7.	 Repeat steps 3 through 6 for the UCS named Back, each time using the top endpoints of 
the legs for the endpoints of the arc.
	
8.	 Restore the UCS for the side, but instead of drawing an arc, use the Polyline tool and 
draw a polyline spline similar to the one in Figure 21.32. If you need help with polyline 
splines, see Chapter 18, “Drawing Curves.”
Next, you’ll mirror the side-edge spline to the opposite side. This will save you from having 
to define a UCS for that side:
	
1.	 Click the World UCS tool on the Visualize tab’s Coordinates panel to restore the WCS. 
You do this because you want to mirror the arc along an axis that is parallel to the plane 
of the WCS. Remember that you must use the coordinate system that defines the plane in 
which you want to work.

Creating Complex 3D Surfaces |  735  
	
2.	 Click the polyline you drew for the side of the chair (the one drawn on the Side UCS).
	
3.	 Start the 3DMirror command on the Home tab’s Modify panel. At the Specify first 
point of mirror plane (3 points)or [Object/  Last/  Zaxiz/View/XY/  YZ/  
ZX/  3points] <3points>: prompt, use the Midpoint override to pick the midpoint 
of the first side of the rectangle at the bottom of the model, then the opposite midpoint, 
and finally the midpoint of the top rectangle on the same side as the second point. Refer 
to Figure 21.33 for help. The polyline should mirror to the opposite side, and your chair 
should look like Figure 21.34.

and then mirror the

Finally, let’s finish this chair by adding the mesh representing the chair seat:
	
1.	 Click the Loft tool from the Extrude flyout in the Home tab’s Modeling panel, or enter 
Loft↵ at the command line.
	
4.	 Press the Esc key twice to clear the grips.

736  | CHAPTER 21  Using Advanced 3D Features   
	
2.	 At the Select cross-sections in lofting order or [POint/Join multiple 
edges/MOde]: prompt, click the arc at the front of the layout.
	
3.	 At the Select cross-sections in lofting order or [POint/Join multiple 
edges/MOde]: prompt, click the arc at the back of the layout and then press ↵ to finish 
your selection of cross sections.
	
4.	 At the Enter an option [Guides/Path/Cross sections only/settings] <Cross 
sections only>: prompt, enter G↵ for the Guides option. You’ll use the two polylines as guides.
Quick Hops to Your UCSs
If you find that you’re jumping from one saved UCS to another, you’ll want to know about the 
Named UCS Combo Control drop-down list. This list is located in the Visualize tab’s Coordinates 
panel, and it contains the World and other standard UCS options as well as all the saved UCSs in a 
drawing. You can use this list as a quick way to move between UCSs that you’ve set up or between 
the predefined orthogonal UCSs.
Another great way to jump quickly between UCSs is to use the UCS Face option. The Face option 
requires a 3D solid, but once you have one in place, you can choose Face from the View flyout on 
the Visualize tab’s Coordinates panel and then click on the face of the solid to which you want to 
align your UCS. For example, you can use the Loft command (see the section “Shaping the Solid” 
later in this chapter) to create a solid similar to the solid shown later in Figure 21.37 that connects 
the top and bottom rectangles of the butterfly chair. You can then use the UCS Face option to align 
to the sides of that solid to draw the arcs and polylines for the seat outline. This way, you’re using 
the 3D solid as a layout tool.
	
5.	 At the Select guide profiles or [Join multiple edges]: prompt, select the two 
polylines on the sides of the layout, and then press ↵ to complete your selection. Your 
chair begins to take form, as shown in Figure 21.35.
	
6.	 Select Save from the Quick Access toolbar to save the chair so far.
You’ve got the beginnings of a butterfly chair with the legs drawn in schematically and the 
seat as a 3D surface. You can add some detail by using a few other tools, as you’ll see in the next 
set of exercises.

Converting the Surface into a Solid
In the previous example, you used the Loft tool to create a 3D surface. After you have a surface, 
you can convert it to a solid to perform other modifications.
You’ll want to round the corners of the seat surface to simulate the way a butterfly chair 
hangs off its frame. You’ll also round the corners of the frame and turn the frame into a tubular 
form. Start by rounding the seat surface. This will involve turning the surface into a solid so that 
you can use solid-editing tools to get the shape that you want:
	
1.	 Click the Thicken tool in the Home tab’s Solid Editing panel.
You can also enter Thicken↵ at the Command prompt.
	
2.	 Select the seat surface, and press ↵ to finish your selection.
	
3.	 At the Specify thickness <0′-0″>: prompt, enter 0.01↵ (0.025↵ for metric users).
The seat surface appears to lose its webbing, but it has just been converted to a very thin 3D 
solid.
Shaping the Solid
The butterfly chair is in a fairly schematic state. The corners of the chair are sharply pointed, 
whereas a real butterfly chair would have rounded corners. In this section, you’ll round the 
corners of the seat with a little help from the original rectangles that you used to form the layout 
frame.
First you’ll use the Fillet command to round the corners of the rectangles. Then you’ll use the 
rounded rectangles to create a solid from which you’ll form a new seat:
	
1.	 Choose the Fillet tool from the Home tab’s Modify panel, or enter F↵ at the command line.
	
2.	 At the Select first object or [Undo/Polyline/Radius/Trim/Multiple]: prompt, 
enter R↵.
	
3.	 At the Specify fillet radius <0′-0″>: prompt, enter 3↵. Metric users enter 7.5↵.

738  | CHAPTER 21  Using Advanced 3D Features   
	
4.	 At the Select first object or [Undo/Polyline/Radius/Trim/Multiple]: prompt, 
enter P↵ for the Polyline option.
	
5.	 At the Select 2D polyline or [Radius]: prompt, select the top rectangle, as shown at 
the top of Figure 21.36. The polyline corners become rounded.
Figure 21.36

the rectangles with the 
Fillet command.
Start the Fillet command
and select the top
rectangle to round
its corners.
Repeat the Fillet command
to round the corners of
the bottom rectangle.
	
6.	 Press ↵ to repeat the Fillet command.
	
7.	 Enter P↵ to use the Polyline option, and then click the bottom rectangle, as shown at the 
bottom of Figure 21.36. Now both polylines have rounded corners.
Next create a 3D solid from the two rectangles using the Loft tool:
	
1.	 Click the Loft tool in the Home tab’s Modeling panel, or enter Loft↵.
	
2.	 At the Select cross-sections in lofting order or [POint/Join multiple 
edges/MOde]: prompt, select the two rectangles and press ↵ to finish your selection. 
Click the multifunction grip, and choose the Ruled option.
	
3.	 At the Enter an option [Guides/Path/Cross sections only/Settings] <Cross 
sections only>: prompt, press ↵. The rectangles join to form a 3D solid (see Figure 21.37).

Finding the Interference between Two Solids
In the next exercise, you’ll use a tool that is intended to find the interference between two solids. 
This is useful if you’re working with crowded 3D models and you need to check whether objects 
may be interfering with each other. For example, a mechanical designer might want to check 
that duct locations aren’t passing through a structural beam.
You’ll use Interfere as a modeling tool to obtain a shape that is a combination of two solids: 
the seat and the rectangular solid that you just created. Here are the steps:
	
1.	 Click the Interfere tool in the Home tab’s Solid Editing panel.
You can also enter Interfere↵ at the Command prompt.
	
2.	 At the Select first set of objects or [Nested selection/Settings]: prompt, 
select the chair seat solid and then press ↵.
	
3.	 At the Select second set of objects or [Nested selection/checK first set] 
<checK>: prompt, click the rectangular solid that you created in the previous exercise 
and press ↵. The Interference Checking dialog box appears (see Figure 21.38), and the 
drawing temporarily changes to a view similar to the Realistic visual style.
Figure 21.38
Checking for interference
The view shows the interference of the two solids in red. Notice that the corners are 
rounded on the red interference.
	
4.	 In the Interference Checking dialog box, deselect the Delete Interference Objects Created 
On Close check box and click Close. The display returns to the Wireframe view. If you 
look carefully at the seat corners, you see a new solid overlaid on the seat (see  
Figure 21.39).

740  | CHAPTER 21  Using Advanced 3D Features   
	
5.	 Delete the rectangular solid and the original seat, as shown in Figure 21.39.
Figure 21.39
The interference solid 
appears on top of the 
original seat.
Delete the rectangular solid.
Delete the original seat.
As mentioned earlier, the Interference Checking tool is intended to help you find out whether 
objects are colliding in a 3D model; as you’ve just seen, though, it can be an excellent modeling 
tool for deriving a form that you could not create otherwise.
A number of other options are available when you’re using the Interference Checking tool. 
Table 21.2 lists the options in the Interference Checking dialog box.

Creating Tubes with the Sweep Tool
You need to take care of one more element before your chair is complete. The legs are currently 
simple lines with sharp corners. In this section, you’ll learn how to convert lines into 3D tubes. 
To make it more interesting, you’ll add rounded corners to the legs.
Start by rounding the corners on the lines that you’ve created for the legs:
	
1.	 Use the Explode tool to explode the 3D polyline legs into simple lines.
	
2.	 Choose the Fillet tool from the Home tab’s Modify panel, or enter F↵ at the command 
line.
	
3.	 At the Select first object or [Undo/Polyline/Radius/Trim/Multiple]: prompt, 
enter R↵.
	
4.	 At the Specify fillet radius <0′-0″>: prompt, enter 2↵. Metric users should enter 5↵.
	
5.	 At the Select first object or [Undo/Polyline/Radius/Trim/Multiple]: prompt, 
enter M↵ and then select pairs of lines to fillet their corners.
	
6.	 When all the corners are rounded, press ↵ to exit the Fillet command.
	
7.	 Delete the two polyline splines that you used to form the sides of the seat, along with the 
curves used for the front and back. Your drawing should look like Figure 21.41.
Table 21.3:	
Interference Settings dialog box options   (continued)
Figure 21.41
Drawing the circles for 
the tubes
Draw a circle here and
make 15 copies for
a total of 16 circles.

Creating Complex 3D Surfaces |  743  
The chair is almost complete, but the legs are just wireframes. Next you’ll give them some 
thickness by turning them into tubes. Start by creating a set of circles. You’ll use the circles to 
define the diameter of the tubes:
	
1.	 Draw a 3⁄8″ (0.95 cm) radius circle in the location shown in Figure 21.41. Don’t worry if 
your location is a little off; the placement of the circle isn’t important.
	
2.	 Use the Rectangular Array command to make 15 copies of the circle. In Figure 21.41, a 4×4 
array is used with the default 1″ spacing. Metric users should use a spacing of about 30 cm. 
Use the Explode command in the Home Tab’s Modify panel to convert the circles from an 
associative array to regular circles. Start the explode command, and select the circles ↵.
Now you’re ready to form the tubes:
	
1.	 Select the Sweep tool from the Extrude flyout in the Home tab’s Modeling panel. You can 
also enter sweep↵ at the command line.
	
2.	 At the Select objects to sweep or [MOde]: prompt, click one of the circles that you 
just created. It doesn’t matter which circle you use because they’re identical. Press ↵ when 
you’re finished.
	
3.	 At the Select sweep path or [Alignment/Base point/Scale/Twist]: prompt, select 
one of the lines or fillet arcs that make up the legs.
	
4.	 Press ↵ to repeat the Sweep command, and then repeat steps 2 and 3 for each part of the 
leg segments, including the fillet arcs.
	
5.	 Continue with step 4 until all the lines in the legs have been converted into tubes.
	
6.	 Change the color of the solid representing the seat to cyan, and then select the Realistic visual 
style from the Visual Style viewport control. Your drawing will look similar to the image on 
the left of Figure 21.42, which shows a perspective view. The image on the right is the chair 
with some materials assigned to its parts and a slight adjustment to the seat location.

7.	 Close the file. You can save it or, if you intend to repeat the exercise, close and do not save.
Using Sweep to Create Complex Forms
Although you used circles with the Sweep command to create tubes, you can use any closed 
polyline shape. Figure 21.43 gives some examples of other shapes that you can use with the 
Sweep command.
Figure 21.43
You can use any closed 
shape with the Sweep 
command.
In step 3 of the previous exercise, you may have noticed some command-line options. These 
options offer additional control over the way Sweep works. Here is a rundown on how they work:
Alignment    This option lets you determine whether the object to sweep is automatically 
set perpendicular to the sweep path. By default, this option is set to Yes. If set to No, Sweep 
assumes the current angle of the object, as shown in Figure 21.44.
Figure 21.44
Alignment lets you set 
the angle between the 
object to sweep and 
the sweep path.
You can skew the object
to sweep in relation to the  
sweep path by using
the Alignment option.
By default, the object to sweep 
is aligned perpendicular to
the sweep path.
Rotate the object to sweep to an angle away from 
the WCS, and then turn off the Alignment option.

Creating Complex 3D Surfaces |  745  
Base Point    By default, Sweep uses the center of the object to sweep as the location to align 
with the path, as shown in Figure 21.45. Base Point lets you set a specific location on the 
object.
Figure 21.45
Using the Base Point 
option
Sweep path
By default, the center 
of the object to sweep 
is aligned with the 
sweep path.
Base point
Sweep path
With the Base Point option, you can 
select a location on the object to sweep 
that will align with the sweep path.
Center
Scale    You can have Sweep scale the sweep object from one end of the path to the other to 
create a tapered shape, as shown in Figure 21.46. This option requires a numeric scale value.
Figure 21.46
Scale lets you scale the 
object to sweep as it’s 
swept along the path.
Twist    You can have the object sweep twist along the path to form a spiral shape, as 
shown in Figure 21.47. This option requires a numeric value in the form of degrees of 
rotation.

746  | CHAPTER 21  Using Advanced 3D Features   
These options are available as soon as you select the sweep object and before you select the 
path object. You can use any combination of options that you need. For example, you can apply 
the Twist and Scale options together, as shown in Figure 21.48.
Figure 21.47
You can have the object 
sweep twist along the 
path to create a spiral 
effect.
Figure 21.48

Creating Spiral Forms
You can use the Sweep tool in conjunction with the Helix tool to create a spiral form, such as a 
spring or the threads of a screw. You’ve already seen how the Sweep tool works. Try the follow-
ing exercise to learn how the Helix tool works firsthand.
In this exercise, you’ll draw a helicoil thread insert. This is a device used to repair stripped 
threads; it’s basically a coiled steel strip that forms internal and external threads. Here are the 
steps:
	
1.	 Open the Helicoil.dwg file. This is a standard AutoCAD drawing containing a closed 
polyline in a stretched octagon shape. This is the cross section of the helicoil thread, and 
you’ll use it as an object to sweep after you’ve created a helix.
	
2.	 Click the Helix tool in the Home tab’s expanded Draw panel, or type Helix↵.

Creating Spiral Forms |  747  
You see the following prompt:
Number of turns = 3.0000  Twist=CCW
Specify center point of base:
	
3.	 Pick a point roughly in the center of the view. A rubber-banding line appears along with 
a circle.
	
4.	 At the Specify base radius or [Diameter] <1.0000>: prompt, enter 0.375↵.
	
5.	 At the Specify top radius or [Diameter] <0.3750>: prompt, press ↵ to accept the 
default, which is the same as the value that you entered in step 4.
	
6.	 At the Specify helix height or [Axis endpoint/Turns/turn Height/tWist] 
<1.0000>: prompt, enter T↵ to use the Turns option.
	
7.	 At the Enter number of turns <3.0000>: prompt, enter 15↵ to create a helix with 15 
turns total.
	
8.	 At the Specify helix height or [Axis endpoint/Turns/turn Height/tWist] 
<1.0000>: prompt, press ↵ to accept the default height of 1. The helix appears as a spiral 
drawn to the dimensions that you’ve just specified for diameter, turns, and height (see 
Figure 21.49).
Figure 21.49
The helix and the heli-
coil after using Sweep
In step 6, you used the Turns option to specify the total number of turns in the helix. You also 
have other options that give you control over the shape of the helix. Figure 21.50 shows you the 
effects of the Helix command options. You may want to experiment with them on your own to 
become familiar with Helix.

The tWist option lets 
you determine whether the 
helix twists clockwise or 
counterclockwise.
Axis Endpoint lets you select 
the endpoint of the helix to 
adjust the helix direction.
The Turns option
determines the number 
of turns in the helix.
Center of base
The Turn Height 
option lets you 
specify the

Editing a Helix with the Properties Palette
If you find that you’ve created a helix with the wrong settings, you don’t have to erase and re-create 
it. You can use the Properties palette to make adjustments to any of the helix options presented in 
Figure 21.50, even after a helix has been created. Select the helix, right-click, and choose Properties. 
Look in the Geometry section of the Properties palette for the helix settings.
Now use the Sweep tool to complete the helicoil:
	
1.	 Click the Sweep tool from the Extrude flyout in the Home tab’s Modeling panel, or enter 
Sweep at the command line.
	
2.	 At the Select objects to sweep or [MOde]: prompt, select the thread cross section in 
the lower-left corner of the drawing and then press ↵.
	
3.	 At the Select sweep path or [Alignment/Base point/Scale/Twist]: prompt, select 
the helix. After a moment, the helicoil appears.
	
4.	 To see the helicoil more clearly, choose the Realistic option from the Visual Styles drop-
down list, and then change the helicoil to the Helicoil layer.
	
5.	 Close and save the file. If you intend to repeat this exercise, close but don’t save.
If the space between the coils is too small for the cross section, you may get an error message. 
If you get an error message at step 3, make sure that you created the helix exactly as specified in 
the previous exercise. You may also try increasing the helix height.

Creating Surface Models |  749  
In step 3, instead of selecting the sweep path, you can select an option to apply to the object 
to sweep. For example, by default, Sweep aligns the object to sweep at an angle that is perpen-
dicular to the path and centers it. See “Using Sweep to Create Complex Forms” earlier in this 
chapter.
Creating Surface Models
In an earlier exercise, you used the Loft command to create the seat of a butterfly chair. In this 
section, you’ll return to the Loft command to explore some of its other uses. This time, you’ll use 
it to create a 3D model of a hillside based on a set of site-contour lines. You’ll also see how you 
can use a surface created from the Loft command to slice a solid into two pieces, imprinting the 
solid with the surface shape.
Architectural Applications for the Helix Tool
In the exercises for the Helix tool, we used a device often used to repair spark plug threads that 
have been stripped, but the helix can be used in other applications besides mechanical modeling. 
For example, we’ve used a helix to draw a circular ramp for a parking garage. To do this, instead 
of multiple turns, you would use a single rotation or a half rotation. The radius of the helix would 
need to be much larger to accommodate the width of a car.
Old vs. New Surfaces
If you’ve used earlier (pre-2007) versions of AutoCAD to create 3D models, you’ve probably used 
surface modeling to create some of your 3D objects. If you open an old drawing file that contains 
those 3D surfaces, you’ll see that they are called polygon meshes. You can convert those older mesh 
objects into new surface objects using the Convert To Surface tool, which is next to the Convert 
To Solid tool in the Home tab’s expanded Solid Editing panel. If you prefer to use the older 3D 
surface modeling tools like Revsurf and Rulesurf, they are still available, though they now create 
mesh surfaces. You will learn more about mesh modeling in Chapter 23, “Exploring 3D Mesh and 
Surface Modeling.”
Start by creating a 3D surface using the Loft command:
	
1.	 Open the contour.dwg file.
	
2.	 Select the Loft tool from the Extrude flyout on the Home tab’s Modeling panel.
	
3.	 Select each brown contour in consecutive order from right to left or left to right. It doesn’t 
matter whether you start at the left end or the right end, but you must select the contours 
in order.

750  | CHAPTER 21  Using Advanced 3D Features   
	
4.	 When you’re finished selecting all the contours, press ↵. You see the surface applied over 
the contour lines (see Figure 21.51).
Figure 21.51
Creating a 3D surface 
from contour lines
	
5.	 At the Enter an option [Guides/Path/Cross sections only/Settings] <Cross 
sections only>: prompt, press ↵ to exit the Loft command.
Once the loft surface has been placed, you can make adjustments to the way the loft is gener-
ated by using the arrow grip that appears when you select the surface:
	
1.	 Click the surface to select it.
	
2.	 Click the arrowhead that appears by the surface. This is known as a multifunction grip.
	
3.	 Select the Ruled option from the menu. The surface changes slightly to conform to the 
new Ruled surface option (see Figure 21.52). Press Esc to make sure that you don’t have 
any objects selected.
Figure 21.52
The surface showing 
the multifunction grip 
menu with the Ruled 
option selected
In the butterfly chair exercise, you used the Guides option in the Loft Command prompt. 
This allowed you to use the polyline curves to guide the loft shape from the front arc to the back 
arc. In this exercise, you didn’t use the command options and went straight to the multifunction 
grip menu. The Ruled setting from step 3 generates a surface that connects the cross sections in 
a straight line.

Creating Surface Models |  751  
Slicing a Solid with a Surface
In the barcelona1.dwg chair example, you converted a surface into a solid using the Thicken 
command. Next, you’ll use a surface to create a solid in a slightly different way. This time, you’ll 
use the surface to slice a solid into two pieces. This will give you a form that is more easily read 
and understood as a terrain model:
	
1.	 Select the Extrude tool from the Extrude flyout in the Home tab’s Modeling panel.
	
2.	 At the Select objects to extrude or [MOde]: prompt, select the large rectangle 
below the contours and press ↵. The rectangle turns into a box whose height follows your 
cursor.
	
3.	 At the Specify height of extrusion or [Direction/Path/Taper angle/
Expression]: prompt, move the cursor upward so that the box looks similar to the one 
shown in Figure 21.53. Then click the mouse to fix the box’s height.
Figure 21.53
The box extruded 
through the contours
You may have noticed that as you raised the box height, you could see how it intersected the 
contour surface. Next you’ll slice the box into two pieces:
	
1.	 Click the Slice tool in the Home tab’s Solid Editing panel.
	
2.	 At the Select objects to slice: prompt, select the box and press ↵.
	
3.	 At the Specify start point of slicing plane or [planar Object/Surface/
Zaxis/View/XY/YZ/ZX/3points] <3points>: prompt, enter S↵ to use the Surface 
option.
	
4.	 At the Select a surface: prompt, select the contour surface.
	
5.	 At the Select sliced object to keep or [keep Both sides] <Both>: prompt, click 
the part of the box that is below the surface. The top part of the box disappears, and you 
see the surface once again.

752  | CHAPTER 21  Using Advanced 3D Features   
	
6.	 Delete the contour surface and the contour lines. The box remains with an imprint of the 
surface, as shown in Figure 21.54.
Figure 21.54
The box with the con-
tour surface imprinted
In step 3, you saw a prompt that offered a variety of methods for slicing the box. The Surface 
option allowed you to slice the box using an irregular shape, but most of the other options let 
you slice a solid by defining a plane or a series of planar objects.
Finding the Volume of a Cut
Civil engineers frequently ask us how they can find the volume of earth from an excavated area. 
This is often referred to as a cut from a cut and fill operation. To do this, you first have to cre-
ate the cut shape. Next you use the Interfere command to find the intersection between the cut 
shape and the contour surface. You can then find the volume of the cut shape using one of the 
inquiry commands in AutoCAD. The following exercise demonstrates how this is done.
Suppose that the contour model you’ve just created represents a site where you’ll excavate a 
rectangular area for a structure. You want to find the amount of earth involved in the excava-
tion. A rectangle has been placed in the contour drawing representing such an area:
	
1.	 Select Wireframe from the Visual Styles flyout on the Home tab’s View panel (see 
Figure 21.55). This allows you to see the excavation rectangle more clearly.
Figure 21.55
Select Wireframe 
from the Visual Styles 
flyout.

Creating Surface Models |  753  
	
2.	 Turn on the Selection Cycling tool in the status bar. This will help you select the rectangle 
in step 4 if you have issues. Otherwise, it can be turned off. If the Selection Cycling tool 
is not in the status bar, click the Customization icon on the far right side of the status bar. 
In the window that pops up, click the Selection Cycling option to make it available in the 
status bar.
	
3.	 Click the Extrude tool in the Home tab’s Modeling panel.
	
4.	 Select the rectangle shown in Figure 21.56.
Figure 21.56
Selecting the rect-
angle representing 
the excavation 
area
	
5.	 In the Selection dialog box, select Polyline and then press ↵. Make sure to move your cur-
sor away from the objects in the drawing before you proceed.
	
6.	 Extrude the rectangle to the height of 10′ (3 meters).
Here you used the Selection Cycling tool to help you select the rectangle, which is overlapped 
by the contour solid. The Selection Cycling tool presents the Selection dialog box, which lets you 
determine the type of object that you want to select, thereby filtering out other objects nearby 
that might be selected accidentally.
With the excavation rectangle in place, you can use the Interfere command to find the volume 
of the excavation:
	
1.	 Click the Interfere tool in the Home tab’s Solid Editing panel.
	
2.	 At the Select first set of objects or [Nested selection/Settings]: prompt, 
click the contour and press ↵.
	
3.	 At the Select second set of objects or [Nested selection/checK first set] 
<checK>: prompt, select the box and press ↵. The Interference Checking dialog box 
appears.
	
4.	 In the Interference Checking dialog box, deselect the Delete Interference Objects Created 
On Close check box and click Close.
	
5.	 Delete the box that you used to represent the excavation area. The remaining shape con-
tains the volume of the excavation.

754  | CHAPTER 21  Using Advanced 3D Features   
	
6.	 Start the Region/Mass Properties tool by typing Massprop↵.
	
7.	 At the Select objects: prompt, select the excavation solid as shown in Figure 21.57 and 
then press ↵. The properties of the excavation area display in the command-line interface. 
At the top, you see the volume of the selected solid (see Figure 21.58).

Understanding the Loft Command
As you’ve seen from the exercises in this chapter, the Loft command lets you create just about 
any shape that you can imagine, from a simple sling to the complex curves of a contour map. If 
your loft cross sections are a set of closed objects like circles or closed polygons, the resulting 
object is a 3D solid instead of a surface.
The order in which you select the cross sections is important because Loft will follow your 
selection order to create the surface or solid. For example, Figure 21.59 shows a series of circles 
used for a lofted solid. The circles on each side are identical in size and placement, but the order 
of selection is different. The solid on the left was created by selecting the circles in consecutive 

Creating Surface Models |  755  
order from bottom to top, creating an hourglass shape. The solid on the right was created by 
selecting the two larger circles first from bottom to top; the smaller, intermediate circle was 
selected last. This selection order created a hollowed-out shape with more vertical sides.
Figure 21.59
The order in which you 
select the cross sec-
tions affects the result 
of the Loft command.

In addition to the selection order, several other settings affect the shape of a solid created 
by the Loft command. In the contour-map example, you selected the Ruled setting from a mul-
tifunction grip after you had completed the Loft command. You can also set Loft command 
options through the Loft Settings dialog box (see Figure 21.60). This dialog box appears dur-
ing the Loft command when you select the Settings option after you’ve selected a set of cross 
sections.

756  | CHAPTER 21  Using Advanced 3D Features   
You can radically affect the way the Loft command forms a surface or a solid through the 
options in this dialog box, so it pays to understand what those settings do. Take a moment to 
study the following sections that describe the Loft Settings dialog box options.
Ruled and Smooth Fit
The Ruled option connects the cross sections with straight surfaces, as shown in the sample to 
the left in Figure 21.61.
Figure 21.61
Samples of a Ruled loft 
at left and a Smooth 
Fit loft on the right
The Smooth Fit option connects the cross sections with a smooth surface. It attempts to make 
the best smooth transitions between the cross sections, as shown in the right image in Figure 21.61.
Normal To
Normal To is a set of four options presented in a drop-down list. To understand what this set-
ting does, you need to know that normal is a mathematical term referring to a direction that is 
perpendicular to a plane, as shown in Figure 21.62. In these options, normal refers to the direc-
tion the surface takes as it emerges from a cross section.

A normal is a direc-
tion perpendicular to 
a plane.

Creating Surface Models |  757  
If you use the All Cross Sections option, the surfaces emerge in a perpendicular direction 
from all of the cross sections, as shown in the first image in Figure 21.63. If you use the End 
Cross Section option, the surface emerges in a direction that is perpendicular to just the end 
cross section, as shown in the second image in Figure 21.63. The Start Cross Section option 
causes the surface to emerge in a direction perpendicular to the start cross section. The Start 
And End Cross Sections option combines the effect of the Start Cross Section and End Cross 
Section options.

To options applied to 
the same set of cross 
sections
Draft Angles
The Draft Angles option affects only the first and last cross sections. This option generates 
a smooth surface with added control over the start and end angles. Unlike the Normal To 
option, which forces a perpendicular direction to the cross sections, Draft Angles allows 
you to set an angle for the surface direction. For example, if you set Start Angle to a value of 
0, the surface will bulge outward from the start cross section, as shown in the first image of 
Figure 21.64.
Figure 21.64
The Draft Angles 
options
Likewise, an End Angle setting of 0 will cause the surface to bulge at the end cross section 
(see the second image in Figure 21.64).
The Start and End Magnitude settings let you determine a relative strength of the bulge. 
The right image in Figure 21.64 shows a draft angle of 0 and magnitude of 50 for the last cross 
section.

758  | CHAPTER 21  Using Advanced 3D Features   
Close Surface or Solid
The Close Surface Or Solid option is available only when the Smooth Fit option is selected. It 
causes the first and last cross section objects to be connected, so the surface or solid loops back 
from the last to the first cross section. Figure 21.65 shows the cross sections at the left, a smooth 
version in the middle, and a smooth version with the Close Surface Or Solid option turned on. 
The Close Surface Or Solid option causes the solid to become a tube.

Solid option connects

ning cross sections.
Moving Objects in 3D Space
AutoCAD provides three tools specifically designed for moving objects in 3D space: 3D Align, 
3D Move, and 3D Rotate. You can find all three commands in the Home tab’s Modify panel. 
These tools help you perform common moves associated with 3D editing.
Aligning Objects in 3D Space
In mechanical drawing, you often create the parts in 3D and then show an assembly of the parts. 
The 3D Align command can greatly simplify the assembly process. The following steps show 
how to use 3D Align to line up two objects at specific points:
	
1.	 Open the align.dwg file.
	
2.	 Click the 3D Align tool on the Home tab’s Modify panel, or type 3dalign↵.
	
3.	 At the Select objects: prompt, select the 3D wedge-shaped object and press ↵. (The 
source object is the object that you want to move.)
	
4.	 At the Specify base point or [Copy]: prompt, pick a point on the source object that 
is the first point of an alignment axis, such as the center of a hole or the corner of a  
surface. For the align drawing, use the upper-left corner of the wedge.
	
5.	 At the Specify second point or [Continue] <C>: prompt, pick a point on the source 
object that is the second point of an alignment axis, such as another center point or other 
corner of a surface. For this example, select the other top corner of the wedge.

Moving Objects in 3D Space |  759  
	
6.	 At the Specify third point or [Continue] <C>: prompt, if two points are adequate 
to describe the alignment, press ↵. Otherwise, pick a third point on the source object 
that, along with the first two points, best describes the surface plane that you want 
aligned with the destination object. Pick the lower-right corner of the wedge shown in 
Figure 21.66.
Figure 21.66
Aligning two 3D 
objects
Result
1st destination point
3rd destination point
2nd destination point
	
7.	 At the Specify first destination point: prompt, pick a point on the destination 
object to which you want the first source point to move. (The destination object is the object 
with which you want the source object to align.) This is the top corner of the rectangular 
shape. (See the first destination point in Figure 21.66.)
	
8.	 At the Specify second destination point or [eXit] <X>: prompt, pick a point 
on the destination object indicating how the first and second source points are 
to align in relation to the destination object. (See the second destination point in 
Figure 21.66.)
	
9.	 You’re prompted for a third destination point. Pick a point on the destination object that, 
along with the previous two destination points, describes the plane with which you 
want the source object to be aligned. (See the third destination point in Figure 21.66.) The 
source object will move into alignment with the destination object.

760  | CHAPTER 21  Using Advanced 3D Features   
Moving an Object in 3D
In Chapter 20, you saw how you can use the Move gizmo tool to help restrain the motion of an 
object in the x-, y-, or z-axis. AutoCAD offers a Move command specifically designed for 3D edit-
ing that includes a move gizmo tool to restrain motion.
You don’t need to perform these steps as an exercise. You can try the command on your own 
when you need to use it.
Here’s how it works:
	
1.	 Click the 3D Move tool in the Home tab’s Modify panel. You can also enter 3dmove↵.
	
2.	 Select the object or set of objects that you want to move and press ↵. The Move gizmo 
appears on the object (see Figure 21.67).

Objective
Figure 21.67

3.	 Point to the x-, y-, or z-axis of the Move gizmo but don’t click it. As you hover over an axis, 
an axis vector appears indicating the direction your object will move if you click the axis, 
as shown in Figure 21.68.
Figure 21.68
An axis vector appears 
when you hover over 
an axis of the gizmo.

4.	 Click an axis while the vector appears, and then enter a distance along the axis or click a 
point to complete the move.
Alternately, in step 3, you can hover over and click a plane indicator on the gizmo to restrain 
the motion along one of the planes defined by two of the axes (see Figure 21.69).

Moving Objects in 3D Space |  761  
Rotating an Object in 3D
The 3D Rotate command is another command that is like an extension of its 2D counterpart. 
With 3D Rotate, a Rotate gizmo appears that restrains the rotation about the x-, y-, or z-axis.
Again, you don’t need to perform these steps as an exercise. You can try the command on 
your own when you need to use it.
Here’s how it works:
	
1.	 Click the 3D Move tool in the Home tab’s Modify panel. You can also enter 3drotate↵.
	
2.	 Select the object or objects that you want to rotate and then press ↵. The Rotate gizmo 
appears on the object (see Figure 21.70).
Figure 21.69
Hover over the plane 
indicator to restrain 
the motion along a 
plane.

Figure 21.70
The Rotate gizmo
	
3.	 At the Specify a base point: prompt, you can select a point about which the selected 
objects are to be rotated. The gizmo will move to the point you select.
	
4.	 Point to the colored circle that represents the axis of rotation for your objects. A vector 
appears, representing the axis of rotation. When you’re happy with the selected axis, 
click.
	
5.	 At the Specify angle start point or type an angle: prompt, you can enter an 
angle value or click a point. You can use the Shift key or Ortho mode to restrain the 
direction to 90°.
	
6.	 If you click a point in step 5, you will see the Specify angle end point: prompt. Enter 
an angle value or click another point for the rotation angle.

762  | CHAPTER 21  Using Advanced 3D Features   
You can also just select one of the circles in step 3 instead of selecting a base point. If you do 
this, then the selected object begins to rotate. You don’t have to select a start and end angle.
Using 3D Mirror
Two other tools, 3D Mirror and 3D Array, are available in the Home tab’s Modify panel. They work 
in a way that’s similar to how the standard Mirror and Array tools work, with a slight difference.
3D Mirror begins by asking you to select objects. Then you’re asked to specify a mirror plane 
instead of a mirror axis. You can define a plane using the default three points, or you can use one 
of the seven other options: Object/Last/Zaxis/View/XY/YZ/ZX. By using a plane instead of 
an axis, you can mirror an object or set of objects anywhere in 3D space. One way to visualize this 
is to imagine holding a mirror up to your 3D model. The mirror is your 3D plane, and the reflected 
image is the mirrored version of the object. Imagine tilting the mirror to various angles to get a 
different mirror image. In the same way, you can tilt the plane in the 3D Mirror tool to mirror an 
object in any number of ways.

Editing and Visualizing 3D Solids 
In the previous 3D chapters, you spent some time becoming familiar with the AutoCAD® 
­software’s 3D modeling features. In this chapter, we’ll focus on 3D solids and how they’re 
­created and edited. You’ll learn how you can use some special visualization tools to show your 
3D solid in a variety of ways.
You’ll create a fictitious mechanical part to explore ways that you can shape 3D solids. 
This will also give you a chance to see how you can turn your 3D model into a standard 2D 
­mechanical drawing. In addition, you’ll learn about the 3D solid-editing tools that are available 
through the Solid Editing Ribbon panel.

Understanding Solid Modeling
Solid modeling is a way of defining 3D objects as solid forms. When you create a 3D model by 
using solid modeling, you start with the basic forms of your model—boxes, cones, and cylin-
ders, for example. These basic solids are called primitives. Then, using more of these primitives, 
you begin to add to or subtract from your basic forms.
3D Solids Are Not Available in AutoCAD LT
Autodesk® AutoCAD LT® users don’t have solid-modeling capabilities. However, you can take advan-
tage of the region objects and their related editing commands described in the sidebar “Using 3D 
Solid Operations on 2D Drawings” later in this chapter.
For example, to create a model of a tube, you first create two solid cylinders, one smaller in 
diameter than the other. You then align the two cylinders so that they’re concentric and tell 

766  | CHAPTER 22  Editing and Visualizing 3D Solids   
AutoCAD to subtract the smaller cylinder from the larger one. The larger of the two cylinders 
becomes a tube whose inside diameter is that of the smaller cylinder, as shown in Figure 22.1. 
Several primitives are available for modeling solids in AutoCAD (see Figure 22.2).

Understanding Solid Modeling |  767  
You can join these shapes—polysolid, box, wedge, cone, sphere, cylinder, pyramid, and donut 
(or torus)—in one of four ways to produce secondary shapes. The first three, demonstrated in 
Figure 22.3 using a cube and a cylinder as examples, are called Boolean operations. (The name 
comes from the nineteenth-century mathematician George Boole.)
Figure 22.3
The intersection, sub-
traction, and union of a 
cube and a cylinder
The union of the two
primitives creates a
box with two round pegs.
The cylinder subtracted
from the box creates
a hole in the box.
The intersection of the
primitives creates a solid
cylinder with the ends skewed.
A solid box and a
solid cylinder are
superimposed.
The three Boolean operations are as follows:
Intersection    Uses only the intersecting volume of two objects to define a solid shape
Subtraction    Uses one object to cut out a shape in another
Union    Joins two primitives so that they act as one object
The fourth option, Interfere, lets you find exactly where two or more solids coincide in 
space—similar to the results of a union. The main difference between interference and union 
is that interference enables you to keep the original solid shapes, whereas Union discards the 
original solids, leaving only their combined form. Interfere creates a temporary 3D solid of 
the coincident space. You can close the command or have AutoCAD create a solid based on the 
shape created. The selected objects will remain unchanged.

768  | CHAPTER 22  Editing and Visualizing 3D Solids   
Joined primitives are called composite solids. You can join primitives to primitives, composite 
solids to primitives, and composite solids to other composite solids.
Now let’s look at how you can use these concepts to create models in AutoCAD.
Exercise Examples Are “Unitless”
To simplify the exercises in this chapter, the instructions don’t specify inches or centimeters. This 
way, users of both the metric and Imperial measurement systems can use the exercises without 
having to read through duplicate information.
Creating Solid Forms
In the following sections, you’ll begin to draw the object shown later in the chapter in Figure 22.18. In 
the process, you’ll explore the creation of solid models by creating primitives and then setting up 
special relationships between them.
Primitives are the basic building blocks of solid modeling. At first, it may seem limiting to 
have only eight primitives with which to work, but consider the varied forms that you can create 
with just a few 2D objects. Let’s begin by creating the basic mass of your steel bracket.
First, prepare your drawing for the exercise:
	
1.	 Open the file called bracket.dwg. This file contains some objects that you’ll use in the 
first half of this chapter to build a 3D solid shape.
	
2.	 If you aren’t already in the 3D Modeling workspace, select 3D Modeling from the 
Workspace Switching tool or the Workspace drop-down list in the Quick Access toolbar.
	
3.	 Close the Materials Browser if it opens with the 3D Modeling workspace.
Joining Primitives
In this section, you’ll merge the two box objects. First, you’ll move the new box into place. Then, 
you’ll join the two boxes to form a single solid:
	
1.	 Start the Move command, pick the smaller of the two boxes, and then press ↵.
	
2.	 At the Specify base point or [Displacement] <Displacement>: prompt, use the 
Midpoint osnap override and pick the middle of the front edge of the smaller box, as 
shown in the top image in Figure 22.4.
	
3.	 At the Specify second point or <use first point as displacement>: prompt, 
use the Midpoint osnap to pick the middle of the bottom edge of the larger box, as shown 
in the bottom image in Figure 22.4.
	
4.	 Click the Solid, Union tool in the Home tab’s Solid Editing panel, or type UNI↵.
	
5.	 At the Select objects: prompt, pick both boxes and press ↵. Your drawing now looks 
like Figure 22.5.
As you can see in Figure 22.5, the form has joined to appear as one object. It also acts like one 
object when you select it. You now have a composite solid made up of two box primitives.

Cutting Portions Out of a Solid
Now let’s place some holes in the bracket. In this next exercise, you’ll discover how to create 
negative forms to cut portions out of a solid:
	
1.	 Turn on the layer called Cylinder. Two cylinder solids appear in the model, as shown in 
Figure 22.6. These cylinders are 1.5 units tall.

770  | CHAPTER 22  Editing and Visualizing 3D Solids   
Figure 22.6
The cylinders appear 
when the Cylinder 
layer is turned on.
	
2.	 Select the Solid, Subtract tool from the Solid Editing panel, or type SU↵.
	
3.	 At the Select solids, surfaces and regions to subtract from... Select 
objects: prompt, pick the composite solid of the two boxes and press ↵.
	
4.	 At the Select solids, surfaces and regions to subtract... Select objects: 
prompt, pick the two cylinders and press ↵. The cylinders are subtracted from the 
bracket.
	
5.	 To view the solid, choose Hidden from the Visual Styles Control in the drawing area. You 
see a hidden-line view of the solid, as shown in Figure 22.7.
Figure 22.7
The bracket so far, with 
hidden lines removed
Using 3D Solid Operations on 2D Drawings
You can apply some of the features described in this chapter to 2D drafting by taking advantage of 
the AutoCAD region object. Regions are two-dimensional objects to which you can apply Boolean 
operations.
The following illustration shows how you can use regions to turn a set of closed polyline shapes 
quickly into a drawing of a wrench. First, you convert the shapes at the top of the figure into 
regions using the Region tool on the Draw panel. Next, you align the shapes, as shown in the middle 
of the image. Finally, you join the circles and rectangle with the Union command (type UNI↵); 
then the hexagonal shapes are subtracted from the combined shape (type SU↵). You can use the 
Region.dwg sample file if you’d like to experiment.

Use the Union and 
Subtract commands 
to create the ﬁnal object.
Create closed polyline 
shapes and convert 
them to regions.
Move the shapes 
into position to lay 
out the object.
You can use regions to generate complex surfaces that may include holes or unusual bends as in 
the next image. Keep in mind the following:
◆
◆
Regions act like surfaces; when you remove hidden lines, objects behind the regions are  
hidden.
◆
◆
You can explode regions to edit them. However, exploding a region causes the region to lose 
its surface-like quality and objects no longer hide behind its surface(s).
◆
◆
You can Ctrl+click the edge of a region to edit the region’s shape.
◆
◆
You can use the regional model to create complex 2D surfaces for use in 3D surface modeling, 
as in this image:

772  | CHAPTER 22  Editing and Visualizing 3D Solids   
As you learned in the earlier chapters in Part 4, Wireframe views, such as the one in the 
previous exercise, are somewhat difficult to decipher. Until you use the Hidden visual style 
(step 5) or the Hide command, you can’t be sure that the subtracted cylinders are in fact holes. 
Using the Hide command frequently will help you keep track of what’s going on with your 
solid model.
You may also have noticed in step 4 that, even though the cylinders were taller than the 
opening they created, they worked fine to remove part of the rectangular solid. The cylinders 
were 1.5 units tall, not 1 unit, which is the thickness of the bracket. Having drawn the cylinders 
taller than needed, you saw that when AutoCAD performed the subtraction, it ignored the por-
tion of the cylinders that didn’t affect the bracket. AutoCAD always discards the portion of a 
primitive that isn’t used in a subtract operation.
Creating Complex Solids
As you learned earlier, you can convert a polyline into a solid by using the Extrude tool in the 
Modeling panel. This process lets you create more complex shapes than the built-in primitives. 
In addition to the simple straight extrusion that you’ve already tried, you can extrude shapes 
into curved paths or you can taper an extrusion.
Tapering an Extrusion
Let’s look at how you can taper an extrusion to create a fairly complex solid with little effort:
	
1.	 Turn on the Taper layer. A rectangular polyline appears. This rectangle has its corners 
rounded to a radius of 0.5 using the Fillet command.
	
2.	 Click the Extrude tool in the Home tab’s Modeling panel, or enter EXT↵ at the Command 
prompt.
	
3.	 At the Select objects to extrude or [MOde]: prompt, pick the polyline that you just 
turned on from the Taper layer and press ↵. If you have Selection Cycling on, pick the 
polyline option from the list that appears.
	
4.	 At the Specify height of extrusion or [Direction/Path/Taper angle/
Expression]: prompt, enter T↵.
	
5.	 At the Specify angle of taper for extrusion or [Expression] <0>: prompt, 
enter 4↵.
	
6.	 At the Specify height of extrusion or [Direction/Path/Taper angle/
Expression]: prompt, enter 3↵. The extruded polyline looks like Figure 22.8.
	
7.	 Join the part that you just created with the original solid. Select the Solid, Union tool from 
the Home tab’s Solid Editing panel or type UNI↵.
	
8.	 Select the extruded part and the composite solid just below it. Press ↵ to complete your 
selection.
In step 5, you can indicate a taper for the extrusion. Specify a taper in terms of degrees from 
the z-axis, or enter a negative value to taper the extrusion outward. You can also press ↵ to 
accept the default of 0 to extrude the polyline without a taper.

Creating Complex Solids |  773  
Figure 22.8
The extruded polyline
The Isolines System Variable
You may have noticed the message that reads as follows:
Current wire frame density: ISOLINES=4
This message tells you the current setting for the Isolines system variable. This variable controls 
the way that curved objects, such as cylinders and holes, are displayed. A setting of 4 causes a 
cylinder to be represented by four lines with a circle at each end. You can see this in the holes that 
you created for the Bracket model in the previous exercise. You can change the Isolines setting 
by entering Isolines↵ at the Command prompt. You then enter a value for the number of lines to 
use to represent surfaces. This setting is also controlled by the Contour Lines Per Surface option 
in the Display tab of the Options dialog box.
Sweeping a Shape on a Curved Path
As you’ll see in the following exercise, the Sweep command lets you extrude virtually any poly-
line shape along a path defined by a polyline, an arc, or a 3D polyline. At this point, you’ve  
created the components needed to do the extrusion. Next, you’ll finish the extruded shape:
	
1.	 Turn on the Path layer. This layer contains the circle that you’ll extrude and the polyline 
path, which looks like an S, as shown in Figure 22.9.

drawing that you’ll

774  | CHAPTER 22  Editing and Visualizing 3D Solids   
	
2.	 Click the Sweep tool from the Extrude flyout in the Home tab’s Modeling panel, or type 
Sweep↵. Click the circle, and then press ↵.
	
3.	 At the Select sweep path or [Alignment/Base point/Scale/Twist]: prompt, click 
the polyline curve.
	
4.	 AutoCAD generates a solid tube that follows the path. The tube may not look like a tube 
because AutoCAD draws extruded solids such as this with four lines while using the 
wireframe visual style. You can change the number of lines shown with the Isolines 
system variable as discussed earlier.
	
5.	 Click the Solid, Subtract tool in the Home tab’s Solid Editing panel, or type SU↵ and then 
select the composite solid.
	
6.	 Press ↵. At the Select objects: prompt, click the curved solid and press ↵. The curved 
solid is subtracted from the square solid, and your drawing looks like Figure 22.10.
Figure 22.10
The solid after sub-
tracting the curve
In this exercise, you used a curved polyline for the extrusion path, but you can use any type 
of 2D or 3D polyline, as well as a line or arc, for an extrusion path.
Revolving a Polyline
When your goal is to draw a circular object, you can use the Revolve command on the Modeling 
panel to create a solid that is revolved, or swept in a circular path. Think of Revolve’s action as 
being similar to a lathe that lets you carve a shape from an object on a spinning shaft. In this 
case, the object is a polyline and, rather than carve it, you define the profile and then revolve the 
profile around an axis.
In the following exercise, you’ll draw a solid that will form a slot in the tapered solid. We’ve 
already created a 2D polyline that is the profile of the slot.
	
1.	 In the Visual Styles Control, select 2D Wireframe.
	
2.	 Zoom in to the top of the tapered box so that you have a view similar to Figure 22.11.

Creating Complex Solids |  775  
	
3.	 Turn on the Revolve layer. This layer contains a closed polyline that you’ll use to create a 
cylindrical shape.
	
4.	 Select the Revolve tool from the Extrude flyout in the Home tab’s Modeling panel, or type 
REV↵ at the Command prompt.
	
5.	 At the Select objects to revolve or [MOde]: prompt, pick the polyline on the top of 
the tapered surface and press ↵.
	
6.	 When you see the prompt
Specify axis start point or define axis by [Object/X/Y/Z] <Object>:
use the Endpoint osnap override and pick the beginning corner endpoint of the polyline 
that you just added, as shown in Figure 22.11.
	
7.	 At the Specify axis endpoint: prompt, pick the axis endpoint indicated in Figure 22.11.
	
8.	 At the Specify angle of revolution or [STart angle/Reverse/EXpression] 
<360>: prompt, press ↵ to sweep the polyline a full 360°. The revolved form appears as 
shown in Figure 22.12.

looks like Figure 22.14.

Editing Solids |  777  
Editing Solids
Basic solid forms are fairly easy to create. Refining those forms requires some special tools. In the 
following sections, you’ll learn how to use familiar 2D editing tools, as well as some new tools, to 
edit a solid. But first you’ll be shown the Slice tool, which lets you cut a solid into two pieces.
Splitting a Solid into Two Pieces
One of the more common solid-editing tools that you’ll use is the Slice tool. As you may guess 
from its name, Slice enables you to cut a solid into two pieces. The following exercise demon-
strates how it works:
	
1.	 Click the Zoom All option to get an overall view of your work so far.
	
2.	 Click the Slice tool in the Home tab’s Solid Editing panel, or type Slice↵.
	
3.	 At the Select objects to slice: prompt, click the part on which you’ve been working 
and press ↵.
Alternatively, you could select more than one solid. The Slice command would then slice 
all of the solids through the plane that you’ll indicate in steps 4 and 5.
	
4.	 At the prompt
Specify start point of slicing plane or
[planar Object/Surface/Zaxis/View/XY/YZ/ZX/
3points] <3points>:
type XY↵. This lets you indicate a slice plane parallel to the XY plane.
	
5.	 At the Specify a point on the XY-plane <0,0,0>: prompt, type 0,0,0.5↵. This places 
the slice plane at the z-coordinate of 0.5 units. You can also use the Midpoint osnap and 
pick any vertical edge of the rectangular base of the solid. If you want to delete one side 
of the sliced solid, you can indicate the side that you want to keep by clicking it in step 6 
instead of entering B↵.
	
6.	 At the Specify a point on desired side or [keep Both sides]<Both>: prompt, 
type B↵ to keep both sides of the solid. AutoCAD divides the solid horizontally, one-half 
unit above the base of the part, as shown in Figure 22.15.
Figure 22.14
The composite solid

778  | CHAPTER 22  Editing and Visualizing 3D Solids   
In step 4, you saw a number of options for the Slice command. You may want to take 
note of those options for future reference. Table 22.1 provides a list of the options and their 
purposes.
Table 22.1:	
Slice command options
Option
Purpose
planar Object
Lets you select an object to define the slice plane.
Surface
Lets you select a surface object to define the shape of a slice.
Zaxis
Lets you select two points defining the z-axis of the slice plane. The two points that you 
pick are perpendicular to the slice plane.
View
Generates a slice plane that is perpendicular to your current view. You’re prompted for 
the coordinate through which the slice plane must pass—usually a point on the object.
XY/YZ/ZX
Pick one of these to determine the slice plane based on the x-, y-, or z-axis. You’re 
prompted to pick a point through which the slice plane must pass.
3points
The default setting; lets you select three points defining the slice plane. Normally, you 
pick points on the solid.
Rounding Corners with the Fillet Tool
Your bracket has a few sharp corners that you may want to round in order to give it a more real-
istic appearance. You can use the Modify panel’s Fillet and Chamfer tools to add these rounded 
corners to your solid model:
	
1.	 Click the Fillet tool in the Home tab’s Modify panel or type F↵.
	
2.	 At the Select first object or [Undo/Polyline/Radius/Trim/Multiple]: prompt, 
pick the edge indicated in the first image in Figure 22.16.
Figure 22.15
The solid sliced through 
the base

Editing Solids |  779  
	
3.	 At the Enter fillet radius or [Expression] <0.5000>: prompt, type 0.2↵.
	
4.	 At the Select an edge or [Chain/Loop/Radius]: prompt, type C↵ for the Chain 
option. Chain lets you select a series of solid edges to be filleted.
	
5.	 Select one of the other seven edges at the base of the tapered form and press ↵.
	
6.	 Type Hide↵ to get a quick look at your model in a hidden line view, as shown in the 
second image in Figure 22.16.
As you saw in step 4, Fillet acts a bit differently when you use it on solids. The Chain option 
lets you select a set of edges instead of just two adjoining objects.
Figure 22.16
Filleting solids
Select this edge to chain.
Fillet this edge.
Chamfering Corners with the Chamfer Tool
Now let’s try chamfering a corner. To practice using Chamfer, you’ll add a countersink to the 
cylindrical hole that you created in the first solid:
	
1.	 Type Regen↵ to return to a Wireframe view of your model.

780  | CHAPTER 22  Editing and Visualizing 3D Solids   
	
2.	 Click the Chamfer tool on the Modify panel (click the Fillet flyout if you don’t see 
Chamfer; see Figure 22.17) or type CHA↵.
Figure 22.17
Click the Chamfer tool.
Flyout arrowhead
	
3.	 At the prompt
Select first line or
 [Undo/Polyline/Distance/Angle/Trim/mEthod/Multiple]:
pick the edge of the hole, as shown in Figure 22.18. Notice that the top surface of the 
solid is highlighted and that the prompt changes to Enter surface selection option 
[Next/OK (current)] <OK>:. The highlighting indicates the base surface, which will be 
used as a reference in step 5. (You could also type N↵ to choose the other adjoining surface, 
the inside of the hole, as the base surface.)
Figure 22.18
Picking the edge to 
chamfer
Select the edge of this hole.
	
4.	 Press ↵ to accept the current highlighted face.
	
5.	 At the Specify base surface chamfer distance or [Expression] <0.1250>: 
prompt, type 0.125↵. This indicates that you want the chamfer to have a width of 0.125 
across the highlighted surface.
	
6.	 At the Specify other surface chamfer distance or [Expression] <0.2000>: 
prompt, type 0.2↵.
	
7.	 At the Select an edge or [Loop]: prompt, click the top edges of both holes and then 
press ↵. When the Chamfer command has completed its work, your drawing looks like 
Figure 22.19.

Editing Solids |  781  
	
8.	 After reviewing the work you’ve done here, save the bracket.dwg file.
The Loop option in step 7 lets you chamfer the entire circumference of an object. You don’t 
need to use it here because the edge forms a circle. The Loop option is used when you have a 
rectangular or other polygonal edge that you want to chamfer.
Figure 22.19
The chamfered edges
Using the Solid-Editing Tools
You’ve added some refinements to the Bracket model by using standard AutoCAD editing 
tools. There is a set of tools that is specifically geared toward editing solids. You already used 
the Union and Subtract tools found in the Solid Editing panel. In the following sections, you’ll 
explore some of the other tools in that panel.
You don’t have to perform the following exercises, but reviewing them will show you what’s 
available. When you’re more comfortable working in 3D, you may want to come back and 
experiment with the file called solidedit.dwg, which is shown in the figures in the following 
sections.
Parallel Projection Needed for Some Features
Many of the features discussed in these sections work only in a parallel-projection view. You can 
switch to a parallel-projection view by choosing the 2D Wireframe visual style or, if you have the 
ViewCube® turned on, right-click it and select Parallel.
Finding Tools in the Solid Editing Panel
Many of the tools in the Solid Editing panel are in flyouts. This makes it a bit difficult to 
describe their location because the default tool changes depending on the last flyout tool that 
was selected. To help you easily find the tools described in these sections, Figure 22.20 shows 
the flyouts in their open position with each tool labeled. You can use this figure for reference 
when you are ready to use a tool.

782  | CHAPTER 22  Editing and Visualizing 3D Solids   
Figure 22.20
The flyouts in the 
Home tab’s Solid 
Editing panel
Moving a Surface
You can move any flat surface of a 3D solid using the Move Faces tool from the Faces flyout on 
the Solid Editing panel. When you click this tool, you’re prompted to select faces. Because you 
can select only the edge of two joining faces, you must select an edge and then use the Remove 
option to remove one of the two selected faces from the selection set (see Figure 22.21). After 
you’ve made your selection, press ↵. You can then specify a distance for the move.
Figure 22.21
To select the vertical 
surface to the far right of 
the model, click the edge 
and then use the Remove  
option to remove the top 
surface from the selection.
Click here to remove
a surface from the
selection set.
Click here to select a surface to move.
After you’ve selected the surface that you want to move, the Move Faces tool acts just like the 
Move command: You select a base point and a displacement. Notice how the curved side of the 
model extends its curve to meet the new location of the surface. This shows you that AutoCAD 
attempts to maintain the geometry of the model when you make changes to the faces.
Move Faces also lets you move entire features, such as the hole in the model. In Figure 22.22, 
one of the holes has been moved so that it’s no longer in line with the other three. This was done 
by selecting the countersink and the hole while using the Move Faces tool.

Editing Solids |  783  
If a solid’s History setting is set to record, you can Ctrl+click its surface to expose the surface’s 
grip. You can then use the grip at the center of the surface to move the surface.
Offsetting a Surface
Suppose that you want to decrease the radius of the arc in the right corner of the model, and 
you also want to thicken the model by the same amount as the decrease in the arc radius. To do 
this, you can use the Offset Faces tool. The Offset Faces tool and the Offset command you used 
earlier in this book perform similar functions. The difference is that the Offset Faces tool in the 
Faces flyout on the Solid Editing panel affects 3D solids.
When you select the Offset Faces tool from the Faces flyout on the Solid Editing panel, you’re 
prompted to select faces. As with the Move tool, you must select an edge that will select two 
faces. If you want to offset only one face, you must use the Remove option to remove one of the 
faces. In Figure 22.22 earlier, an edge is selected. Figure 22.23 shows the effect of the Offset Faces 
tool when both faces are offset.
Figure 22.22
Selecting a surface to 
offset
Click on the
solid here.
Figure 22.23
The model after offset-
ting the curved and 
bottom surfaces
Deleting a Surface
Now suppose that you’ve decided to eliminate the curved part of the model. You can delete a 
surface by using the Delete Faces tool. Once again, you’re prompted to select faces. Typically, 
you’ll want to delete only one face, such as the curved surface in the example model. If you 

784  | CHAPTER 22  Editing and Visualizing 3D Solids   
select more than one face to delete, use the remove option in the command to remove faces from 
your selection set.
When you attempt to delete surfaces, keep in mind that the surface you delete must be recov-
erable by other surfaces in the model. For example, you can’t remove the top surface of a cube, 
expecting it to turn into a pyramid. That would require the sides to change their orientation, 
which isn’t allowed in this operation. You can, on the other hand, remove the top of a box with 
tapered sides. Then, when you remove the top, the sides converge to form a pyramid.
Rotating a Surface
All of the surfaces of the model are parallel or perpendicular to each other. Imagine that your 
design requires two sides to be at an angle. You can change the angle of a surface by using the 
Rotate Faces tool.
As with the prior solid-editing tools, you’re prompted to select faces. You must then spec-
ify an axis of rotation. You can either select a point or use the default of selecting two points 
to define an axis of rotation, as shown in Figure 22.24. Once the axis is determined, you can 
specify a rotation angle. Figure 22.25 shows the result of rotating the two front-facing sur-
faces 4°.

Tapering a Surface
In an earlier exercise, you saw how to create a new tapered solid by using the Extrude com-
mand. But what if you want to taper an existing solid? Here’s what you can do.
The Taper Faces tool from the Faces flyout on the Solid Editing panel prompts you to select 
faces. You can select faces, as described for the previously discussed solid-editing tools, using 
the Remove or Add option (see Figure 22.26). Press ↵ when you finish your selection, and then 
indicate the axis from which the taper is to occur. In the model example in Figure 22.26, select 
two corners defining a vertical axis. Finally, enter the taper angle. Figure 22.27 shows the model 
tapered at a 4° angle.

Extruding a Surface
You’ve used the Extrude tool to create two of the solids in the Bracket model. The Extrude tool 
requires a closed polyline as a basis for the extrusion. As an alternative, the Solid Editing panel 
offers the Extrude Faces tool, which extrudes a surface of an existing solid.
When you select the Extrude Faces tool from the Faces flyout on the Solid Editing panel 
or type Solidedit↵F↵E↵, you see the Select faces or [Undo/Remove]: prompt. Select an 
edge or a set of edges or use the Remove or Add option to select the faces that you want to 
extrude. Press ↵ when you’ve finished your selection, and then specify a height and taper 

786  | CHAPTER 22  Editing and Visualizing 3D Solids   
angle. Figure 22.28 shows the sample model with the front surface extruded and tapered at a 
45° angle. You can extrude multiple surfaces simultaneously if you need to by selecting them.
Figure 22.28
The model with a 
surface extruded and 
tapered
Aside from those features, the Extrude Faces tool works just like the Extrude command.
Turning a Solid into a Shell
In many situations, you’ll want your 3D model to be a hollow mass rather than a solid mass. The 
Shell tool lets you convert a solid into a shell.
When you select the Shell tool from the Separate/Clean/Shell/Check flyout on the Solid 
Editing panel or type Solidedit↵B↵S↵, you’re prompted to select a 3D solid. You’re then 
prompted to remove faces. At this point, you can select an edge of the solid to indicate the 
surface that you want removed. The surface you select is completely removed from the model, 
exposing the interior of the shell. For example, if you select the front edge of the sample model 
shown in Figure 22.29, the top and front surfaces are removed from the model, revealing the 
interior of the solid, as shown in Figure 22.30. After selecting the surfaces to remove, you must 
enter a shell offset distance.
Figure 22.29
Selecting the edge to 
be removed
Select this edge.

Editing Solids |  787  
Figure 22.30
The solid model after 
using the Shell tool
The shell thickness is added to the outside surface of the solid. When you’re constructing 
your solid with the intention of creating a shell, you need to take this into account.
Copying Faces and Edges
At times, you may want to create a copy of a surface of a solid to analyze its area or to produce 
another part that mates to that surface. The Copy Faces tool (found in the Extrude Faces flyout)  
creates a copy of any surface on your model. The copy it produces is a type of object called a region.
The copies of the surfaces are opaque and can hide objects behind them when you perform a 
hidden-line removal (type Hide↵).
Another tool that is similar to Copy Faces is Copy Edges (found in the Extract Edges flyout). 
Instead of selecting surfaces as in the Copy Faces tool, you select all the edges that you want to 
copy. The result is a series of simple lines representing the edges of your model. This tool can be 
useful if you want to convert a solid into a set of 3D faces. The Copy Edges tool creates a frame-
work onto which you can add 3D faces.
Adding Surface Features
If you need to add a feature to a flat surface, you can do so with the Imprint tool. An added sur-
face feature can then be colored using the Color Faces tool or extruded using the Presspull tool. 
This feature is a little more complicated than some of the other solid-editing tools, so you may 
want to try the following exercise to see firsthand how it works.
You’ll start by inserting an object that will be the source of the imprint. You’ll then imprint 
the main solid model with the object’s profile:
	
1.	 Back in the saved bracket.dwg, click the Insert tool in the Insert tab’s Block panel; then 
click More Options to open the Insert dialog box, or type I↵.
	
2.	 Click Browse, and then locate the imprint.dwg sample file and select it.
	
3.	 In the Insert dialog box, make sure that the Explode check box is selected and remove the 
check mark from the Specify On-Screen check box in the Insertion Point group.
	
4.	 Click OK. The block appears in the middle of the solid.
	
5.	 Select the Imprint tool from the Edges flyout on the Home tab’s Solid Editing panel or 
type Imprint↵.

788  | CHAPTER 22  Editing and Visualizing 3D Solids   
	
6.	 Click the main solid model.
	
7.	 Click the inserted solid.
	
8.	 At the Delete the source object [Yes/No]<N>: prompt, enter Y↵↵. Press Esc to clear 
the selection.
You now have an outline of the intersection between the two solids imprinted on the top sur-
face of your model. The imprint is really a set of edges that have been added to the surface of the 
solid. To help the imprint stand out, try the following steps to change its color:
	
1.	 Select the Color Faces tool from the Faces flyout on the Solid Editing panel, or type 
Solidedit↵F↵L↵.
	
2.	 Click the imprint from the previous exercise. The imprint and the entire top surface are 
highlighted.
	
3.	 At the Select faces or [Undo/Remove/ALL]: prompt, type R↵; then click the outer 
edge of the top surface to remove it from the selection set.
	
4.	 Press ↵ to open the Select Color dialog box.
	
5.	 Click the red color sample in the dialog box, and then click OK. The imprint is now red.
	
6.	 Press ↵ twice to exit the command.
	
7.	 To see the full effect of the Color Faces tool, choose the Conceptual or Realistic visual 
style from the Visual Styles Control in the drawing screen.
If you want to remove an imprint from a surface, Ctrl+click each imprint face and line and 
press the Delete key. Repeat the process until all imprint items are removed.
Separating a Divided Solid
While editing solids, you can end up with two separate solid forms that were created from one 
solid, as shown in Figure 22.31. Even though the two solids appear separated, they act like a sin-
gle object. In these situations, AutoCAD offers the Separate tool from the Separate/Clean/Shell/
Check flyout on the Solid Editing panel. To use it, click the Separate tool or type Solidedit↵B↵P↵ 
and select the solid that has been separated into two forms.
Figure 22.31
When the tall, thin 
solid is subtracted 
from the larger solid, 
the result is two sepa-
rate forms, yet they 
still behave as a single 
object.

Figure 22.31 is included in the sample files under the name Separate example.dwg. You can 
try the Separate tool in this file on your own.
Through some simple examples, you’ve seen how each of the solid-editing tools works. You 
aren’t limited to using these tools in the way that they were demonstrated in this chapter, and this 
book can’t anticipate every situation that you might encounter as you create solid models. These 
examples are intended as an introduction to these tools, so feel free to experiment with them. You 
can always use the Undo option to backtrack in case you don’t get the results that you expect.
This concludes your tour of the Solid Editing panel. Next, you’ll learn how to use 3D solid 
models to generate 2D working drawings quickly.
Finding the Properties of a Solid
All this effort to create a solid model isn’t designed just to create a pretty picture. After your model 
is drawn and built, you can obtain information about its physical properties.
You can find the volume, the moment of inertia, and other physical properties of your model by 
using the Massprop command. These properties can also be recorded as a file on disk, so you can 
modify your model without worrying about losing track of its original properties.
To find the mass properties of a solid, enter Massprop↵, and then follow the prompts. AutoCAD 
LT users can use the Massprop command described here to find the properties of solids that are 
part of an existing drawing.
Using the Command Line for Solid Editing
The solid-editing tools are options of a single AutoCAD command called Solidedit. If you prefer 
to use the keyboard, here are some tips on using the Solidedit command. When you first enter 
Solidedit↵ at the Command prompt, you see the following prompt:
Enter a solids editing option [Face/Edge/Body/Undo/eXit] <eXit>:
You can select the Face, Edge, or Body option to edit the various parts of a solid. If you select Face, 
you see the following prompt:
[Extrude/Move/Rotate/Offset/Taper/Delete/Copy/coLor/mAterial/Undo/eXit] <eXit>:
The options from this prompt produce the same results as their counterparts on the Solid Editing 
panel.
If you select Edge at the first prompt, you see the following prompt:
Enter an edge editing option [Copy/coLor/Undo/eXit] <eXit>:
The Copy option lets you copy a surface, and the coLor option lets you add color to a surface.
If you select Body from the first prompt, you see the following prompt:
[Imprint/seParate solids/Shell/cLean/Check/Undo/eXit] <eXit>:
These options also perform the same functions as their counterparts on the Solid Editing panel. 
As you work with this command, you can use the Undo option to undo the last Solidedit option 
that you used without exiting the command.

790  | CHAPTER 22  Editing and Visualizing 3D Solids   
Streamlining the 2D Drawing Process
Using solids to model a part—such as with the bracket and Solidedit examples in this chapter—
may seem a bit exotic, but there are definite advantages to modeling in 3D, even if you only want 
to show the part in 2D as a page in a set of manufacturing specs.
The exercises in the following sections show you how to generate a typical mechanical draw-
ing from your 3D model quickly by using paper space and the Solid Editing panel. You’ll also 
examine techniques for dimensioning and including hidden lines.
Certiﬁcation
Objective
Architectural Elevations from 3D Solids
If your application is architectural and you’ve created a 3D model of a building by using solids, you 
can use the tools described in the following sections to generate 2D elevation drawings from your 
3D solid model.
We’ve used solid models in the past to generate 2D line drawings of elevations. Such line drawings 
can be “rendered” in a 2D drawing program like Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator. Be aware that 
such drawings will not be as accurate as those drawn from scratch, but they are fine for the early 
stages of a design project.
Drawing Standard Top, Front, and Right-Side Views
One of the more common types of mechanical drawings is the orthogonal projection. This style 
of drawing shows separate top, front, and right-side views of an object. Sometimes, a 3D image 
is added for clarity. You can derive such a drawing in a few minutes using the Flatshot tool 
described in Chapter 20, “Creating 3D Drawings” (see “Turning a 3D View into a 2D AutoCAD 
Drawing” in that chapter).
With Flatshot, you can generate the standard top, front, and right-side orthogonal projection 
views, which you can further enhance with dimensions, hatch patterns, and other 2D drawing 
features. Follow these steps:
	
1.	 In the bracket.dwg file, open the 3D Navigation drop-down list in the in-canvas View 
Controls, and then click an orthogonal projection view from the list, such as Top, Left, 
or Right (see Figure 22.32). You can also use the 3D Navigation flyout in the Visualize 
tab’s Views panel or use the ViewCube to select an orthogonal view. See Chapter 20 for 
more on the ViewCube.
	
2.	 Click the Flatshot tool on the Home tab’s expanded Section panel, or type Flatshot↵.
	
3.	 In the Flatshot dialog box, select the options that you want and click Create (see 
Figure 22.33). See Table 20.1 in Chapter 20 for the Flatshot options.

Figure 22.33
The Flatshot dialog box
If you select Insert As New Block in the Flatshot dialog box, you’re prompted to select  
an insertion point to insert the block that is the 2D orthogonal view of your model.  
By default, the view is placed in the same plane as your current view, as shown in 

792  | CHAPTER 22  Editing and Visualizing 3D Solids   
Figure 22.34
The 2D orthogonal 
views shown in rela-
tion to the 3D model
Figure 22.34. After you’ve created all your views, you can move them to a different location 
in your drawing so that you can create a set of layout views to your 2D orthogonal views, 
as shown in Figure 22.35. You can also place the orthogonal view blocks on a separate layer 
and then, for each layout viewport, freeze the layer of the 3D model so that only the 2D 
views are displayed.
Set Up Standard Views in a Layout Viewport
To set up a layout viewport to display a view, like a top or right-side view of a 3D model, select a 
view from the 3D Navigation drop-down list in the Home tab’s View panel and then click on the 
viewport border. To set the scale of a viewport, click the viewport border and then select a scale 
from the VP Scale drop-down list on the status bar. If you’d like to refresh your memory on layouts 
in general, refer to Chapter 15, “Laying Out Your Printer Output.”
If your model changes and you need to update the orthogonal views, you can repeat the steps 
listed here. However, instead of selecting Insert As New Block in the Flatshot dialog box, select 
Replace Existing Block to update the original orthogonal view blocks. If you want, you can 
include an isometric view to help communicate your design more clearly.

Streamlining the 2D Drawing Process |  793  
Creating 2D Drawings with the Base View Command
You saw how 2D views of a 3D model can be made using the Flatshot command. The Base View 
command also creates 2D views, but in a different way. Follow these steps for a demonstration:
	
1.	 In the bracket.dwg file, go to paper space and activate the Layout tab in the Ribbon (see 
Figure 22.36). The Create View panel contains the Viewbase command.

2.	 Start the Viewbase command, and choose the From Model Space option.
	
	 You can also import an Autodesk® Inventor® file if you have one available.
	
3.	 A preview of your model will be shown. Pick a place in your drawing to insert your first view.
If you aren’t happy with the location, you can always move the view later with the Move 
command or by using the move grip edit. Views are objects that can be moved, deleted, 
and so on, just like any other object.
	
4.	 When the view is placed, you have several options (see Figure 22.37). You can control the 
orientation and set the visibility of hidden lines and the scale of the view. The visibility 
setting provides further control of how your model’s edges will be displayed. When all 
is set, click Exit. Setting up your view can be tricky because the changes that you make 
won’t be applied until you exit the command. Once the views are set, you can alter them, 
or you can erase them and start over.

	 The Viewbase command is still running, and it is ready for you to insert additional views.

After you place the 
parent base view, 
this menu displays 
the options that 
you can set.
Figure 22.38
The Viewbase com-
mand can quickly 
create projection 
views of your 3D 
model.
You can now perform basic manipulations on the inserted views. Specifically, you can add or 
remove views at any time. Any view can be selected. The grip control lets you quickly change to 
a view’s scale. Each child view inherits the Scale setting, as well as all other settings, from the 
parent (or first) view. You can change each view’s settings independently of each other or leave 
them the way that they are.
To change the settings on your views, select one. This will activate a contextual Ribbon tab 
called Drawing View (see Figure 22.39), bringing up the tools that you need to edit your selected 
view. Use the Projected command to create new projections from the selected view. The Section 
command will create a cross-section view. Detail will create a detail view. Edit View allows you 
to make changes to the hidden lines, scale, and visibility settings.
	
5.	 Move the cursor around the first view that you inserted. The appropriate views—left, 
right, and isometric—will be previewed, as shown in Figure 22.38. When you have 
inserted all the views you want, press Enter.

Streamlining the 2D Drawing Process |  795  
Creating Section Views
The Section command can create several types of cross sections, but they all work in a similar 
way. You can create full, half, offset, or aligned sections. You can also create a section based 
on an object. The Section button in the Ribbon has a flyout that will display these commands, 
but you can always just click the Section command itself (see Figure 22.40). This will start the 
Aligned Section command, which should fill most of your needs:
Figure 22.39
Selecting a view will 
activate the contex-
tual Drawing View 
Ribbon tab.
Figure 22.40
Select the Section 
command or choose a 
specific type of section 
to create.
	
1.	 Click the Section command and select a view. In drafting, a cross section is defined 
by the section callout arrows. Cross sections in the Section command work the same way.
	
2.	 Pick a place for your first section arrow, and then pick the second. This creates the sec-
tion plane. These arrows can always be changed, and the section will then automatically 
update itself to reflect the new section arrow placement.
	
3.	 Continue to add more points in your section plane if you want.
	
4.	 After you have picked all the points needed, press Enter and pick a direction for the 
arrows to point. You will also see a preview of what the section will look like.
A section has display settings similar to those for the base views but with a few more ele-
ments that you have to define. Two of the more obvious additional items are the label and the 
hatching. The Annotation setting controls the label and callouts. The first section of a drawing is 
typically labeled as A-A. As you insert new sections, AutoCAD will continue down the alphabet 
automatically for you. The second section created will be labeled B, then C, and so on. Of course, 
you can change any of these at any time.
As illustrated in Figure 22.41, the section will be labeled. It will be called Section and will 
display the scale. These items are text fields and can be changed too, or you can turn them off. 
The label is an Mtext object, and it can be manipulated just as any other text object. Double-click 
the label to open the text editor. The hatching in the section is a hatch object, and it can be edited 
with the hatch editor. It, too, can be turned off.

796  | CHAPTER 22  Editing and Visualizing 3D Solids   
To change the display features of the section, you can click the Edit View command in the 
Ribbon and select the section view. (In fact, you can use the Edit View command to make 
changes to any type of view that you have created.) A contextual Ribbon tab appears (also 
shown in Figure 22.41). You can change how the section is displayed in the Appearance panel, 
change the method by which the section is generated in the Method panel, alter the label in the 
Annotation panel, and toggle the hatch on or off in the Hatch panel.
You can create section styles, similar to dimension styles, by typing viewsectionstyle at 
the command line. If you have worked with dimension styles, discussed in Chapter 11, “Using 
Dimensions,” the following process will be second nature:
	
1.	 In the Section View Style Manager dialog box, click the New button.
	
2.	 Name your new style, and then click Continue to open the New Section View Style 
dialog box.
	
3.	 The first tab, Identifiers And Arrows, lets you specify the appearance and placement 
of the section identifiers and arrowheads. Select the text style, color, and size of your 
identifiers.
You can make similar adjustments to the arrowheads. Change the type of symbol, its size, 
color, and so on.
Figure 22.41
Section views are 
edited in the same 
way as all other 
view types. They 
also contain hatch 
objects and annota-
tion labels.
	
4.	 In the Arrangement area, specify how the identifiers are positioned and aligned.

Streamlining the 2D Drawing Process |  797  
The remaining tabs allow you to define the section cutting plane lines and end lines (line-
type, color), the view label content and appearance, and the hatch settings. You can create styles 
that have different labels, use different arrowheads, or have different hatch patterns.
Creating Detail Views
The Detail command, located in the Create View panel in the Layout tab in the Ribbon, creates 
an enlarged detail view, either circular or rectangular, of a specific area of your model. Follow 
these steps:
	
1.	 To choose which type of detail view you want to create, use the Detail command’s pull-
down menu. If you click the Detail button, the command will default to the detail type 
last used.
	
2.	 Select the view that you want to display, and then define the area that you want 
detailed.
	
3.	 Pick a center point for the detail, and then pick an outer edge.
	
4.	 A preview of the detail appears and prompts you to select a location. Click where you 
want the detail placed.
Detail views have settings similar to the settings for the other views, with a few that are 
unique. Figure 22.42 illustrates the detail view contextual Ribbon tab. The Boundary setting 
controls whether the detail is a rectangle or circle. The Model Edge setting controls the bound-
ary around the detail; it can be jagged, smooth, smooth with a border, or smooth with a connec-
tion line. The remaining settings are the same as for other view types. Views typically inherit 
the scale from the parent view. Detail views will be “zoomed in” so that you can see the details 
more clearly.
Figure 22.42
While you’re creat-
ing a detail view, a 
contextual Ribbon 
appears that will 
provide access to the 
detail view settings.
When you have created your views (see Figure 22.43 for a finished set of views), you can 
always remove them or add more. If the model changes, you can update the views by using the 
Update View command in the Update panel of the Layout tab. Toggle on the Auto Update set-
ting (also in the Update panel), and whenever the model is changed, the views will automati-
cally update.

and quick process.
Adding Dimensions and Notes in a Layout
Although we don’t recommend adding dimensions in paper space for architectural drawings, 
doing so may be a good idea for mechanical drawings such as the one in this chapter. By main-
taining the dimensions and notes separate from the actual model, you keep these elements from 
getting in the way of your work on the solid model. You also avoid the confusion of having to 
scale the text and dimension features properly to ensure that they will plot at the correct size. 
See Chapter 9, “Adding Text to Drawings,” and Chapter 11 for a more detailed discussion of 
notes and dimensions.
As long as you set up your paper space work area to be equivalent to the final plot size, you 
can set the dimension and text to the sizes that you want at plot time. If you want text 1/4″ high, 
you set your text styles to be 1/4″ high.
To include dimensions, make sure that you’re in a layout view and then use the dimension 
commands in the normal way. However, you must make sure that full associative dimensioning 
is turned on. Choose Options from the Application menu to open the Options dialog box, and 
then click the User Preferences tab. In the Associative Dimensioning group, make sure that the 
Make New Dimensions Associative check box is selected. With associative dimensioning turned 
on, dimensions in a layout view display the true dimension of the object being dimensioned 
regardless of the scale setting of the viewport.
Certiﬁcation
Objective

Streamlining the 2D Drawing Process |  799  
If you don’t have associative dimensioning turned on and your viewports are set to a scale 
other than 1 to 1, you have another option: You can set the Annotation Units option in the 
Dimension Style dialog box to a proper value. The following steps show you how:
	
1.	 Back in the bracket.dwg drawing, select the Model tool in the status bar and then select 
the Dimension Style tool from Annotate tab’s Dimension’s panel to open the Dimension 
Style Manager.
	
2.	 Make sure that you’ve selected the style you want to use, and then click Modify to open 
the Modify Dimension Style dialog box.
	
3.	 Click the Primary Units tab.
	
4.	 In the Scale Factor box in the Measurement Scale group, enter the value by which you 
want your paper space dimensions multiplied. For example, if your paper space views 
are scaled at one-half the actual size of your model, enter 2 in this box to multiply your 
dimensions’ values by 2.
	
5.	 Click the Apply To Layout Dimensions Only check box. This ensures that your dimen-
sion is scaled only while you’re adding dimensions in paper space. Dimensions added in 
model space aren’t affected.
	
6.	 Click OK to close the Modify Dimension Style dialog box, and then click Close in the 
Dimension Style Manager.
You’ve had to complete a lot of steps to get the final drawing, but compared with drawing 
these views by hand, you undoubtedly saved a great deal of time. In addition, as you’ll see later 
in this chapter, what you have is more than just a 2D drafted image. With what you created, fur-
ther refinements are now easy.
Using Visual Styles with a Viewport
In Chapter 20, you saw how you could view your 3D model using visual styles. A visual style 
can give you a more realistic representation of your 3D model, and it can show off more of the 
details, especially on rounded surfaces. You can also view and plot a visual style in a layout 
view. To do so, you make a viewport active and then turn on the visual style that you want to 
use for that viewport. The following exercise gives you a look at how this is done:
	
1.	 Continuing in the bracket.dwg drawing, create a new Paper Space tab by clicking the 
plus icon in the status bar (next to the far-right Paper Space tab) at the bottom of the 
screen.
	
2.	 Double-click inside the viewport with the isometric view of the model to switch to 
Floating Model Space.
	
3.	 Select Conceptual from the Visual Styles drop-down list in the Visualize tab’s Visual 
Styles panel or the Home tab’s View panel (see Figure 22.44).
The view may appear a bit dark because of the black color setting for the object. You can 
change the color to a lighter one, such as cyan or blue, to get a better look.
	
4.	 Double-click outside the isometric viewport to return to paper space.

800  | CHAPTER 22  Editing and Visualizing 3D Solids   
If you have multiple viewports in a layout, you can change the visual style of one viewport 
without affecting the other viewports. This can help others visualize your 3D model more clearly.
You’ll also want to know how to control the hard-copy output of a shaded view. For this you 
use the context menu:
	
1.	 Click the isometric view’s viewport border to select it.
	
2.	 Right-click to open the context menu, and select the Shade Plot option to display a set of 
Shade Plot options (see Figure 22.45).
	
3.	 Take a moment to study the menu, and then click As Displayed.
Figure 22.44
The Visual Styles 
panel and the  
View panel
Figure 22.45
The Shade Plot 
options

Visualizing Solids |  801  
The As Displayed option plots the viewport as it appears in the AutoCAD window. You 
use this option to plot the currently displayed visual style. Wireframe plots the viewport as a 
Wireframe view. Hidden plots the viewport as a hidden-line view similar to the view you see 
when you use the Hide command. Below the Hidden option in the context menu is a list of the 
available visual styles. At the bottom of the menu is the Rendered option, which plots the view 
by using the Render feature, described in Bonus Chapter 6, “Rendering 3D Drawings,” available 
at www.omura.com/chapters. You can use the Rendered option to plot raytraced renderings of 
your 3D models.
Remember these options on the context menu as you work on your drawings and when you 
plot. They can be helpful in communicating your ideas, but they can also get lost in the array of 
tools that AutoCAD offers.
Visualizing Solids
If you’re designing a complex object, sometimes it helps to be able to see it in ways that you 
couldn’t in the real world. AutoCAD offers two visualization tools that can help others under-
stand your design ideas.
If you want to show off the internal workings of a part or an assembly, you can use X-Ray 
Effect, which you can find in the Visualize tab’s Visual Styles panel.
Figure 22.46 shows an isometric view of the bracket using the Realistic visual style and with 
X-Ray Effect turned on. The color of the bracket has also been changed to a light gray to help 
visibility. You can see the internal elements as if the object were semitransparent. X-Ray Effect 
works with any visual style, although it works best with a style that shows some of the surface 
features (such as the Conceptual or Realistic visual style).
Figure 22.46
The bracket displayed 
using a Realistic visual 
style and X-Ray Effect

802  | CHAPTER 22  Editing and Visualizing 3D Solids   
Another tool to help you visualize the internal workings of a design is the Section Plane com-
mand. This command creates a plane that defines the location of a cross section. A section plane 
can also do more than just show a cross section. Try the following exercise to see how it works:
	
1.	 In the bracket.dwg file, click the Model tab at the bottom of the drawing area and then 
change the color of layer 0 to a light gray so that you can see the bracket more clearly when 
using the Realistic visual style. If you changed the color of the object in a previous step, 
you will have to change the object’s color back to ByLayer using the Properties palette.
	
2.	 Select Realistic from the Visual Styles Control drop-down list in the drawing screen.
	
3.	 Make sure that the Object Snap and Object Snap Tracking tools are turned off in 
the status bar. This will allow you to point to surfaces on the model while using the 
Sectionplane command.
	
4.	 Adjust your view so that it looks similar to Figure 22.47.
Figure 22.47
Adding the section 
plane to your bracket
	
5.	 In the Home tab’s Section panel, click the Section Plane tool. You can also enter 
sectionplane↵ at the Command prompt. You’ll see the following prompt:
Select face or any point to locate
section line or [Draw section/Orthographic/ Type]:
	
6.	 Select the front face of the bracket to place the section plane as shown in Figure 22.47. A 
plane appears on that surface.
You can move the section plane object along the solid to get a real-time view of the section it 
traverses. To do this, you need to turn on the Live Section feature. To check whether Live Section 
is turned on, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the section plane, and then right-click. If you see a check mark by the Activate 
Live Sectioning option, then you know it’s on. If you don’t see a check mark, then choose 
Activate Live Sectioning to turn it on.

Visualizing Solids |  803  
	
2.	 Click the red axis on the gizmo, as shown in Figure 22.48. The axis turns yellow to indi-
cate that it is active and you see a red vector appear.
Figure 22.48
Moving the surface 
plane across the 
bracket
	
3.	 Move the cursor slowly toward the back of the bracket. As you do this, the bracket 
becomes lighter in the foreground.
	
4.	 When the section plane is roughly in the middle of the tapered portion of the bracket, 
click to fix the plane in place. You should have a view similar to Figure 22.49.
Figure 22.49
The surface plane 
fixed at a location

804  | CHAPTER 22  Editing and Visualizing 3D Solids   
Now you see only a portion of the bracket behind the section plane plus the cross section of 
the plane, as shown in Figure 22.49. You can have the section plane display the front portion as a 
ghosted image by following these steps:
	
1.	 With the section plane selected (you should still see its Move gizmo), right-click and 
choose Show Cut-Away Geometry. The front portion of the bracket appears (see 
Figure 22.50).
Figure 22.50
The front portion of 
the bracket is displayed 
with the Show Cut-
Away Geometry option 
turned on.
	
2.	 Press the Esc key to end the command. The section plane and the cut-away geometry 
remain in view.
You can double-click on the section plane to toggle between a solid view and a cut-away view 
of the geometry. This toggles the Active Live Sectioning option.
You can also add a jog in the section plane to create a more complex section cut. Here’s how 
it’s done:
	
1.	 Select the section plane, right-click, and select Show Cut-Away Geometry to turn this fea-
ture off. There should be no check mark by this feature name in the menu. This is neces-
sary in order to gain access to the section plane Jog features.
	
2.	 Right-click, and choose Add Jog To Section.
	
3.	 At the Specify a point on the section line to add jog: prompt, use the Nearest 
object snap to select a point on the section plane line (see Figure 22.51).

Visualizing Solids |  805

Click this grip to move
the back portion of the

4.	 Click the grip on the back portion of the section plane, as shown in the center image of 
Figure 22.51, and drag it toward the right so that the jog looks similar to the third panel in 
the figure.
	
5.	 Press the Esc key to end the command.
As you can see from this example, you can adjust the section using the grips on the section 
plane line. (A contextual ribbon is also available to make most of the adjustments that we will 
discuss here.) You can use the Nearest osnap to select a point anywhere along the section line to 
a jog. Click and drag the endpoint grips to rotate the section plane to an angle.

806  | CHAPTER 22  Editing and Visualizing 3D Solids   
You may have also noticed another arrow in the section plane (see Figure 22.52).
Figure 22.52
The arrow presents 
additional options for 
the section plane.
Click this arrow and the hidden 
side of the slice is reversed.

Another boundary 
line appears with 
grips when you 
click the Section 
Boundary option.
When you click the down-pointing arrow, you see four options for visualizing the section 
boundary: Plane, Slice, Boundary, and Volume.
By using these other settings, you can start to include sections through the sides, back, top, or 
bottom of the solid. For example, if you click the Boundary option, another boundary line appears 
with grips (see Figure 22.53). To see it clearly, you may have to press Esc and then select the section 
plane again. You can then manipulate these grips to show section cuts along those boundaries.
The Volume option displays the boundary of a volume along with grips at the top and bot-
tom of the volume (see Figure 22.54). These grips allow you to create a cut plane from the top or 
bottom of the solid.

Visualizing Solids |  807  
Figure 22.54
The boundaries 
shown using the 
Section Volume 
option
The Slice option is used to generate thin cuts through your model that will consist of parallel 
lines using front and back section planes. A slice’s thickness can be adjusted, but the slice cannot 
contain jogs. If you previously created jogs with other options, they will be removed. There are 
grips that allow you to control the length, width, and height of the solid and a grip to flip the 
solid to the other side (see Figure 22.55).
Figure 22.55
The Section Slice can 
be manipulated simi-
larly to other section 
options.

808  | CHAPTER 22  Editing and Visualizing 3D Solids   
Finally, you can get a copy of the solid that is behind or in front of the section plane. Right-
click the section plane, and choose Generate Section; then select the 2D/3D Block option to open 
the Generate Section/Elevation dialog box. Click the Show Details button to expand the dialog 
box and display more options (see Figure 22.56).
Figure 22.56
The Generate Section/
Elevation dialog box
If you select 2D Section/Elevation, a 2D image of the section plane is inserted in the drawing 
in a manner similar to the insertion of a block. You’re asked for an insertion point, an X and Y 
scale, and a rotation angle.
The 3D Section option creates a copy of the portion of the solid that is bounded by the section 
plane or planes, as shown in Figure 22.57.

You can access more detailed settings for the 2D Section/Elevation, 3D Section, and 
Live Section Settings options by clicking the Section Settings button at the bottom of the 
Generate Section/Elevation dialog box. This button opens the Section Settings dialog box (see 
Figure 22.58), which lists the settings for the section feature.
Figure 22.58

Using a Section Plane in an Architectural Model
If your application is architectural, you can use a section plane and the 2D Section/Elevation option 
to get an accurate elevation drawing. Instead of placing the section plane inside the solid, move it 
away from the solid model and use the 2D Section/Elevation context menu option.
Taking Advantage of Stereolithography
A discussion of solid modeling wouldn’t be complete without mentioning stereolithography. This is 
one of the most interesting technological wonders that has appeared as a by-product of 3D computer 
modeling. Stereolithography is a process that generates physical reproductions of 3D computer solid 
models. Special equipment converts your AutoCAD-generated files into a physical model.
continues

810  | CHAPTER 22  Editing and Visualizing 3D Solids   
This process offers the mechanical designer a method for rapidly prototyping designs directly from 
AutoCAD drawings, though applications don’t have to be limited to mechanical design. Architects 
can take advantage of this process too. One of the authors’ interest in Tibetan art led him to create 
a 3D AutoCAD model of a type of statue called a Zola, shown here. He sent this model to a service 
to have it reproduced in resin.
AutoCAD supports stereolithography through the 3dprint and Stlout commands. These commands 
generate an STL file, which can be used with a Stereolithography Apparatus (SLA) to generate a 
model. You must first create a 3D solid model in AutoCAD. Then you can use the Export Data dialog 
box to export your drawing in the STL format. Choose Export To Another File Format from the 
Application menu, and make sure that the Files Of Type drop-down list shows Lithography (*.stl) 
before you click the Save button. You can also choose Send To 3D Print Service from the Output 
tab’s 3D Print panel.
The AutoCAD 3D solids are translated into a set of triangular-faceted meshes in the STL file. You 
can use the Rendered Object Smoothness setting in the Display tab of the Options dialog box to 
control the fineness of these meshes. See Chapter 23, “Exploring 3D Mesh and Surface Modeling,” 
for more information on this setting.
When you use Send To 3D Print Service, which can also be found in the Application menu’s Publish 
options, you will see a message box asking if you want to learn more about preparing a 3D model 
for printing. If you are unfamiliar with stereolithography and 3D printing, it is a good idea to 
select the Learn About Preparing A 3D Model For Printing option so that you don’t make some of 
the common mistakes.
The price of 3D printers has dropped dramatically recently, and there are more desktop models 
than ever before. Autodesk itself has joined the 3D printer market with its release of its open 3D 
printer platform, Spark. If you have access to a 3D printer, then you can make a physical copy of 
your model rather easily.
If you create a set of orthogonal views in a layout, the work you do to find a section is also 
reflected in the layout views (see Figure 22.59).

Chapter  23
Exploring 3D Mesh and Surface 
Modeling 
Autodesk® AutoCAD® software has always offered tools that allow users to construct fairly 
complex 3D models. With the introduction of the latest solid modeling tools, you can even 
model some very organic forms. But some forms require a type of modeling known as mesh 
modeling. Mesh modeling lets you create smooth, curved volumes by manipulating faces that 
make up an object’s surface.
With mesh modeling, you can quickly create curved shapes that are difficult or even impos-
sible to create by other means. With AutoCAD you can also convert a mesh model into a 3D 
solid so that you can perform Boolean operations. In addition, AutoCAD has a set of 3D surface 
modeling tools that extend its ability to produce and edit curved, organic forms.
In this chapter, you’ll get a chance to explore many of the current features of mesh modeling 
through a series of exercises, and you’ll be introduced to the surface modeling tools. You’ll also 
learn how you can convert a mesh or 3D surface into a solid. You’ll start by creating a simple 
shape as an introduction, and then you’ll move on to a more complex form.

As an introduction to the mesh modeling features in AutoCAD, you’ll draw a simple box and 
then smooth the box. This first exercise will show you some of the basic mesh modeling tools 
and what types of control you can exert on a model.
First, you’ll make sure that you are in the 3D Modeling workspace and that you have a blank 
drawing set up for the mesh. Follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the New tool on the Quick Access toolbar.

814  | CHAPTER 23  Exploring 3D Mesh and Surface Modeling   
	
2.	 In the Select Template dialog box, select the acad3D.dwt template and then click Open.
	
3.	 Click the Workspace pop-up list in the status bar and select 3D Modeling, as shown in 
Figure 23.1.
Figure 23.1
The 3D Modeling 
workspace
	
4.	 Choose the Shaded With Edges visual style from the Visual Styles drop-down list on 
the drawing screen. This will give you a close approximation of the appearance of the 
meshes that you’ll see in the illustrations in this book.
Creating a Mesh Primitive
Meshes are similar to solids in that they start from a primitive. You may recall that 3D solid 
primitives are predetermined shapes from which you can form more complex shapes. The 
mesh primitives are similar to the 3D solid primitives that you learned about in Chapter 20, 
“Creating 3D Drawings,” and Chapter 22, “Editing and Visualizing 3D Solids.” You can see 
the different mesh primitives that are available by clicking the Mesh flyout in the Mesh tab’s 
Primitives panel (see Figure 23.2).
Figure 23.2
The primitives in the 
Mesh flyout of the 
Primitives panel

Creating a Simple 3D Mesh |  815  
In the next exercise, you’ll use the Mesh Box primitive to start your cushion:
	
1.	 In the Mesh tab’s Primitives panel, click the Mesh Box tool or type Mesh↵B↵.
	
2.	 At the Specify first corner or [Center]: prompt, enter 0,0↵ to start the mesh at the 
drawing origin.
	
3.	 You’ll want a mesh that is 21 units in the x-axis by 32 units in the y-axis, so at the Specify 
other corner or [Cube/Length]: prompt, enter 21,32↵.
	
4.	 At the Specify height or [2Point]: prompt, place your cursor anywhere above the 
base of the mesh and enter 4↵ for a 4 unit height. You now have a basic shape for your 
mesh (see Figure 23.3).
Figure 23.3
The Mesh Box primitive
You’ve just created a mesh box, but you have several other mesh primitives at your disposal. 
If you click the Mesh flyout on the Primitives panel, you’ll see the cone, cylinder, pyramid, 
sphere, wedge, and torus primitives. When creating your model, consider which of these primi-
tives will best suit your needs.
Understanding the Parts of a Mesh
Before you go any further, you’ll want to understand the structure of a mesh. Notice that each 
side is divided into nine panels, or faces, as they are called in AutoCAD. You can edit these faces 
to change the shape and contour of your mesh. You can control the number of faces of a mesh 
through an options dialog box that you’ll learn about later in this chapter.
Figure 23.4 shows the names of the different parts of a simple mesh: the vertex, the edge, 
and the face. These three parts are called subobjects of the mesh, and you can move their position 
in the mesh to modify a mesh’s shape.
To help you select different subobjects on a mesh, the Selection panel offers the Filter flyout, 
which shows the No Filter tool by default. You’ll use this flyout in many of the exercises in this 
chapter.

816  | CHAPTER 23  Exploring 3D Mesh and Surface Modeling   
Smoothing a Mesh
One of the main features of a mesh is its ability to become a smooth, curved object. Right now 
your cushion has sharp edges, but you can round the corners using the Smooth tools.
Try modifying the mesh to smooth its corners:
	
1.	 Click the rectangular mesh to select it.
	
2.	 Click the Smooth More tool in the Mesh panel or the Smooth panel, or type 
Meshsmoothmore↵. The edges of the mesh become faceted and smoother in appearance.
	
3.	 Click Smooth More again. The mesh becomes smoother still (see Figure 23.5).

The mesh after apply-
ing the Smooth More 
tool twice
	
4.	 Now click Smooth Less, or type Meshsmoothless↵. The mesh becomes less smooth.
	
5.	 Press Esc to clear the selection.
As you can see from this exercise, you can smooth a mesh using the Smooth More tool. The 
more times you apply it to a mesh, the smoother your mesh becomes. The number of faces of the 
mesh determines how the Smooth More tool affects the mesh. The fewer the number of faces, 
the broader the application of smoothness.

Editing Faces and Edges |  817  
When you apply the Smooth More tool to a mesh, the faces of the mesh become faceted. This 
simulates the smooth appearance. If you look closely at a mesh that has only one or two levels of 
smoothing applied, you can see the facets.
Editing Faces and Edges
The shape that you created earlier demonstrates one of the main features of meshes. In this sec-
tion, you’ll create a model of a surfboard to see how you can push and pull the subobjects of a 
mesh to create a form.
Know the ViewCube
Throughout the following exercise, you’ll make heavy use of the ViewCube®. Be sure that you are 
familiar with how it works. If you need a refresher, go to Chapter 20.
You’ll start with the same form, a box shape, but this time you’ll modify some of the param-
eters that define the box’s structure. You can control the number of faces that a mesh primitive 
will have before it is created. The following exercise introduces you to the tools and methods 
used to edit meshes.
Start by creating a new drawing and setting up the parameters for the mesh:
	
1.	 Click the New tool in the Quick Access toolbar, select acad3D.dwt, and then click Open.
	
2.	 In the Mesh tab, click the Mesh Primitives Options tool in the Primitives panel title bar. 
The Mesh Primitive Options dialog box appears (see Figure 23.6).
Figure 23.6
The Mesh Primitive 
Options dialog box
	
3.	 In the Tessellation Divisions rollout in the Mesh group, change the Length and Width 
values to 4 and the Height value to 1. Click OK when you’ve finished making the changes.
	
4.	 In the Home tab’s View panel, choose the Shaded With Edges visual style from the Visual 
Styles drop-down list.

818  | CHAPTER 23  Exploring 3D Mesh and Surface Modeling   
The parameters you change alter the number of faces on mesh primitives that you create, 
including the box primitive that you will create in the next exercise. You’ll see the results after 
following the next set of steps:
	
1.	 Click the Mesh Box tool found on the Mesh tab in the Primitives panel.
	
2.	 At the Specify first corner or [Center]: prompt, type 0,0↵ to start the corner at the 
origin of the drawing.
	
3.	 At the Specify other corner or [Cube/Length]: prompt, enter 50,30↵ to create a 
50´30 unit base for the box.
	
4.	 At the Specify height or [2Point] prompt, point the cursor in the positive Z direc-
tion and then enter 3.5↵ for a 3.5 unit thickness.
	
5.	 Center the box in your view. Your model should look similar to Figure 23.7.
What Does the Smooth Object Tool Do?
It’s hard not to notice the very large Smooth Object tool in the Mesh panel. Your first reaction might 
be to try to use this tool on a mesh, but it is not intended to work on meshes. Instead, it converts 
3D objects other than meshes into mesh objects. You can convert a solid into a mesh, for example, 
using this tool. 3D surfaces can also be converted, and it even works on region objects that are 
technically not 3D objects.
You might be tempted to convert a mesh to a solid, edit it, and then turn it back into a mesh. 
Although this can be done, we don’t recommend it. You’ll find that your model becomes too unwieldy 
to work with.
Figure 23.7
The mesh box
	
6.	 Click the box to select it. Then, in the Mesh panel, click the Smooth More tool twice. The 
edges of the mesh become more rounded.
Stretching Faces
You now have the basis for the surfboard, though it might seem like an odd shape for a surf-
board. Next you’ll start to form the surfboard by manipulating the faces and edges of the mesh. 
Start by pulling two sides of the mesh to give it a shape more like a surfboard:
	
1.	 Use the ViewCube and Pan tools to adjust your view so that it looks similar to Figure 23.8. 
This view will allow you to easily select and “pull” some of the faces that will become the 
front and back of the surfboard.

3.	 Hold down the Ctrl key, and then click and drag a crossing selection window over the 
middle faces at the front edge of the box, as shown previously in Figure 23.8. The faces 
are highlighted, and you see the XYZ gizmo.
	
4.	 Place your cursor on the red x-axis of the gizmo.
	
5.	 When the red axis vector line appears, click the gizmo and move your mouse downward 
in a positive X direction. The mesh begins to elongate.

820  | CHAPTER 23  Exploring 3D Mesh and Surface Modeling   
	
7.	 Press Esc to remove the faces from the current selection.
The portion of the mesh you “pull” out will become the front. Next, you’ll do the same for the 
back of the surfboard:
	
1.	 Use the Pan tool to adjust your view so that it looks similar to Figure 23.11. This view lets 
you easily select and “pull” some of the faces that will become the back of the surfboard.

you see the XYZ gizmo.
	
4.	 Place your cursor on the red x-axis of the gizmo, and when the red axis vector line 
appears, click once and move the gizmo upward in a negative X direction.

7.	 Click the Home tool on the ViewCube to get a better view of your mesh at this point (see 
Figure 23.13).

Moving an Edge
The surfboard needs a sharper point at the front. Instead of moving the faces as you’ve already 
done, you can move an edge to give the front a more pointed shape. The next set of steps will 
show you how to do this:
	
1.	 Using the ViewCube, adjust your view so that you have a close-up of the front tip of the 
surfboard, as shown in Figure 23.14.

822  | CHAPTER 23  Exploring 3D Mesh and Surface Modeling   
	
2.	 In the Selection panel, select Edge from the Filter flyout.
	
3.	 Hover over the front edge until you see the edge line, and then click the edge, as shown 
in Figure 23.14. The Move gizmo appears.
Figure 23.14
Click the front-center 
edge shown here.
Click this edge
	
4.	 Hover over the x-axis of the gizmo, and when the red vector line appears, click once and 
move the x-axis downward along the positive X direction.
	
5.	 When it looks similar to Figure 23.15, click the mouse button.
Figure 23.15
Pull the front edge so 
that the mesh looks 
similar to this image.
Next, give the front of the mesh a slight curve by adjusting the z-axis of the front edge:
	
1.	 Hover over the z-axis of the gizmo, and when the blue axis vector line appears, click once 
and move the z-axis downward in the negative Z direction.
	
2.	 When it looks similar to Figure 23.16, click the mouse button.
	
3.	 Press the Esc key twice to clear your edge selection.
	
4.	 Click the Home tool in the ViewCube to return to the home view.
We asked you to adjust the edge downward because you’ll want to have a bottom view of your 
surfboard. This will enable you to add fins to the board without having to flip the mesh over.

Editing Faces and Edges |  823  
Fine-Tuning the Mesh
You might notice that the surfboard has a slight trough down the middle after you move the front 
edge downward. You can remove that trough and add some additional curvature to the board by 
moving the two edges on the side of the mesh toward the front.
Select these edges.
You can click these edges with the Edge subobject filter selected. After you have these edges selected, 
use the z-axis on the gizmo to move them down to eliminate the trough.
Figure 23.16
Move the front edge 
downward in the 
z-axis.

824  | CHAPTER 23  Exploring 3D Mesh and Surface Modeling   
Adding More Faces
The surfboard is still missing some fins. You could model some fins as separate meshes and then 
later join them to the surfboard. You can also use the Refine Mesh tool to add more edges and 
then use those edges as the basis for your fins. The following exercise will show how this is done:
	
1.	 Adjust your view so that it looks similar to the top image in Figure 23.17.
Figure 23.17
Select the faces to 
refine.
Ctrl+click these two faces.
	
2.	 From the View tab’s Visual Styles panel, open the Visual Styles drop-down list and select 
Shaded With Edges if it isn’t already activated. This will allow you to see the edge lines of 
the mesh as you work through the following steps.
	
3.	 Click No Filter from the Selection panel’s Filter flyout; then click the mesh, and, from the 
Mesh tab’s Mesh panel, click Smooth More. This will increase the number of edges that 
are generated in the next step.
	
4.	 Press the Esc key to clear your selection.
	
5.	 On the Selection panel, select Face from the Filter flyout.
	
6.	 Click the two faces shown in the top image of Figure 23.17.
	
7.	 Click the Refine Mesh tool on the Mesh panel, or type Meshrefine↵. The selected faces 
will be subdivided into smaller faces and edges, as shown in the bottom image of 
Figure 23.17.

Editing Faces and Edges |  825  
The next step in creating the fins is to edit some of the newly created edges:
	
1.	 Zoom into the surfboard so that your view looks similar to Figure 23.18.
Understanding How Refine Mesh Works
You have some control over the number of faces that Refine Mesh creates, through the level of 
smoothness applied to a mesh. If you reduce the smoothness of a mesh, the Refine Mesh tool will 
produce fewer faces. If you increase the smoothness, Refine Mesh will produce more faces—four 
more per facet, to be precise.
To understand how this works, you have to take a closer look at how the Smooth More tool works. 
Each time you apply the Smooth More tool to a mesh, every face of the mesh is divided into four 
facets. These facets aren’t actually faces, but they divide a face in such a way as to simulate a rounded 
surface. The Refine Mesh tool further divides each of these facets into four faces. You can see this 
division clearly if you apply Refine Mesh to a face in a mesh that has only one level of smoothness 
applied.
Figure 23.18
Select the edges for 
the fins.
Click these two edges.
	
2.	 On the Selection panel, select Edge from the Filter flyout.
	
3.	 Click the edges shown in Figure 23.18.
	
4.	 Hover over the z-axis on the gizmo so that the axis vector appears, and then click once 
and move the z-axis upward in the positive Z direction. If you run out of room at the top 
of the window, you can move the z-axis as far as you can with one click and drag and 
then repeat the move.
	
5.	 Adjust the edges so that they look similar to those in Figure 23.19, and then click the 
mouse button.

826  | CHAPTER 23  Exploring 3D Mesh and Surface Modeling   
	
6.	 Adjust the x-axis of the gizmo toward the back of the surfboard so that the fins look simi-
lar to Figure 23.20.

create the fins.

7.	 Press the Esc key to clear your selection of mesh edges.
Rotating an Edge
The fins aren’t quite the right shape. They are a bit too broad at the base. The next exercise shows 
you how to rotate an edge to adjust the shape of the fins further:
	
1.	 With the Edge subobject filter still selected, click the back edge of the fins, as shown in 
Figure 23.21.
	
2.	 In the Selection panel, select the Rotate Gizmo tool from the Gizmo flyout (see 
Figure 23.22).

to rotate the edge. Adjust the rotation of the edge so that the fins look similar to those in 
the lower panel of Figure 23.21, and then click the mouse button.
	
4.	 Press the Esc key to clear your selection.
	
5.	 Use the Home tool on the ViewCube to get an overall view of the surfboard (see 
Figure 23.23).

828  | CHAPTER 23  Exploring 3D Mesh and Surface Modeling   
In this exercise, you switched from the Move gizmo to the Rotate gizmo. You can also use the 
Scale gizmo to scale a face or edge.
This may not be the most accurate rendition of a surfboard (our apologies if you are a surfer), 
but the general shape of the surfboard has given you a chance to explore many of the features of 
the Mesh toolset.

Changing the Gizmo on the Fly
Instead of using the Gizmo flyout on the Selection panel, you can right-click the gizmo to change 
it. You can also set the orientation of the gizmo through the context menu, which will allow you to 
move subobjects in directions other than perpendicular to the face or edge. You can orient the gizmo 
to the WCS, the current UCS, or a face on a mesh through the Align Gizmo With right-click option.
Adding a Crease
You’ll want to know about one more tool that can help you fine-tune your mesh shapes. The 
Add Crease tool on the Mesh panel does exactly what it says. It can introduce a crease in your 
otherwise smooth mesh shape. Add Crease does this in two ways: It can flatten a face or remove 
the smoothing around an edge.
In the following exercises, you’ll use the surfboard one more time to experiment with the 
Add Crease tool. First you’ll see how you can add a sharp point to the surfboard:
	
1.	 Adjust your view of the surfboard so that you can see the front point, as shown in 
Figure 23.24. Turn off the grid so that you can see the shape clearly.
	
2.	 From the Mesh tab’s Selection panel, select the Move Gizmo tool from the Gizmo flyout.
	
3.	 Click the Add Crease tool in the Mesh panel.
	
4.	 At the Select Mesh Subobjects to Crease: prompt, click the front edge of the surf-
board, as shown in Figure 23.24.
	
5.	 Press ↵. At the Specify Crease Value [Always] <Always>: prompt, press ↵.
	
6.	 The point of the surfboard becomes much sharper.

Editing Faces and Edges |  829  
You can see from this exercise that the front edge of the surfboard is now quite sharp since it 
no longer has any smoothness.
Now try applying the Add Crease tool to a face:
	
1.	 From the Selection panel, select Face from the Filter flyout.
	
2.	 Click the Add Crease tool and, at the Select Mesh Subobjects to Crease: prompt, 
click the two faces on either side of the front edge, as shown in Figure 23.25, and press ↵.
Figure 23.24
Set up your view. Select 
the front edge of the 
surfboard.
Select the front edge.
Figure 23.25
Click these faces to 
flatten them.
Click these two faces.
	
3.	 At the Specify Crease Value [Always] <Always>: prompt, press ↵.
	
	 The faces are flattened, and the point of the surfboard becomes even sharper, as shown 
in Figure 23.26.

830  | CHAPTER 23  Exploring 3D Mesh and Surface Modeling   
	
4.	 Save your drawing.
The surfboard is grossly deformed, but you can see how the side faces have now become flat 
and the edges of the face form a crease. You could use the Add Crease tool to sharpen the edge 
of the fins. This would also have the effect of making the fins thinner. We didn’t use that exam-
ple for this exercise because the effects would have been too subtle to see clearly.
Splitting and Extruding a Mesh Face
Before we move on to the next topic, let’s discuss two more tools that can be a great aid in edit-
ing your meshes. The Split Face tool does just what its name says. It will split a face into two 
faces. The Extrude Face tool behaves like the Extrude Face tool you have seen for 3D solids. Both 
of these tools are a bit tricky to use, so they bear a closer look.
To use the Split Face tool, you first select a mesh face and then select two points, one on each 
side of the face. The following exercise shows how it works:
	
1.	 Open the SplitMesh.dwg sample file from the Chapter 23 at this book’s web page 
(www.sybex.com/go/masteringautocad2017) folder. This file contains a simple mesh 
box that has been smoothed.
	
2.	 In the Mesh tab’s Mesh Edit panel, click the Split Mesh Face tool, or type Meshsplit↵.
	
3.	 Make sure the Face filter tool is selected in the Selection panel.
	
4.	 Click the face shown in the top panel of Figure 23.27.
	
5.	 Move the cursor to the left edge of the face until you see a knife icon appear next to the 
cursor.
	
6.	 Click roughly in the middle of the edge.
	
7.	 Move the cursor along the right edge of the face. You’ll see some temporary lines, giving 
you a preview of the location of the split (see Figure 23.27).
	
8.	 Move the cursor roughly in the middle of the right edge. The face changes temporarily to 
show you how it will look when it is divided into two faces.
Figure 23.26

applying Add Crease 
to the side faces on 
the front

Editing Faces and Edges |  831  
	
9.	 Click. The shape of the mesh changes to accommodate the new face.
As you can see, Split Face is not a precision tool, but if you don’t like the location of the split, 
you can move the newly created edge using one of the gizmos.
Next let’s look at the Extrude Face tool. At first, you might think that the Extrude Face tool is 
redundant since you can use the Move gizmo to move a face in a direction away from the mesh, 
as you saw in an earlier exercise. Using the Extrude Face tool is different from moving a face 
because it isolates the movement to the selected face as much as possible. To see how this works, 
try the following:
	
1.	 With the Face filter selected in the Selection panel, click the face indicated in Figure 23.28.
	
2.	 Click and drag the x-axis in the positive direction. When the mesh looks similar to the 
upper panel of Figure 23.29, click to finish the move. The smoothness of the side is main-
tained as you pull the face.
	
3.	 Press the Esc key and click Undo to revert back to the mesh as it was before you moved 
the face.
	
4.	 Click the Extrude Face tool in the Mesh Edit panel.
	
5.	 Click the same face that you selected before, and then press ↵.
	
6.	 Move the cursor along the z-axis in the positive direction. The face is extruded, leaving 
the faces around it unmoved except for a slight curvature at the base (see the lower panel 
of Figure 23.29).

You can see from this example that the Extrude Face tool confines the deformation of the 
mesh to only the face that you select. Note that you can select multiple faces for the extrusion.
Using Split Mesh Face and Add Crease Together
In a usability study conducted by Autodesk, the product designers gave an example of how to add a 
crease to the top surface of a computer mouse model. In the example, the Split Face and Add Crease 
tools were used together. First a new edge was created using the Split Face tool, and then the Add 
Crease tool was applied to the newly created edge to form the crease. Using these two tools together 
in this way, you can add a crease just about anywhere on a mesh.

Creating Mesh Surfaces |  833  
Creating Mesh Surfaces
So far, you’ve been working with mesh volumes, but the Primitives panel of the Mesh tab offers 
four tools that let you create a variety of surface meshes. These are the revolved, edge, ruled, 
and tabulated surfaces. If you’re an old hand at working with 3D in AutoCAD software, these 
tools should be familiar. They are the latest incarnation of some of the earliest 3D tools offered 
by AutoCAD, and they work exactly like the old features they replace. But just like the mesh 
volumes with which you’ve been working, the mesh surfaces can be quickly smoothed and their 
subobjects can be edited using the gizmos that you learned about in this and earlier chapters. 
The following sections give a little more detail about these tools and how they are used. The 
figures used in these sections are taken directly from the cue cards for each tool.
Try Out These Tools on a Sample File
The following instructions are for your reference only, and you are not required to do them as 
exercises. But if you like, you can try them out on the SurfaceMeshSamples.dwg file provided 
with the sample drawings for this chapter.
Revolved Surface
To create a revolved surface, you need a profile to revolve and a line that acts as an axis of revo-
lution (see Figure 23.30). The profile can be any object, but a polyline or spline is usually used.
To create a revolved surface, follow these steps:
	
1.	 Click the Modeling, Meshes, Revolved Surface tool in the Primitives panel, or type 
Revsurf↵.
	
2.	 Select the profile object, and then select the axis object.
Figure 23.30
The Revolved Surface 
tool’s cue card
	
3.	 At the Specify start angle <0>: prompt, enter a start angle, or just press ↵ to accept 
the default angle of 0.

834  | CHAPTER 23  Exploring 3D Mesh and Surface Modeling   
	
4.	 At the Specify included angle (+=ccw, -=cw) <360>: prompt, enter the angle of 
rotation for the surface, or just press ↵ to accept the default angle of 360 degrees. As you 
might infer from the prompt, you can create a revolved surface that is not completely 
closed.
Getting Smoother Surfaces
The mesh surfaces will appear faceted when you first create them. Typically, the revolved, ruled, 
and tabulated surfaces will have six faces. The edge surface will have an array of 36 faces. You 
can increase the number of faces that are generated by these tools by changing the Surftab1 and 
Surftab2 settings. Surftab1 will increase the faces generated by the revolved, ruled, and tabulated 
surface tools. Surftab1 and Surftab2 can be used to increase the faces of an edge surface.
To use the Surftab settings, type Surftab1↵ or Surftab2↵ and enter a numeric value. The value 
you enter will be the number of faces generated by these surface mesh tools. Don’t get carried away, 
because an increase in the number of faces will also increase the size of your file. Besides, you can 
always use the Smooth More tool to smooth out the appearance of these surface objects up to the 
maximum smoothness level allowed.
Surftab1 and Surftab2 
are set to 6.
Surftab1 is set to 12 and 
Surftab2 is set to 24.
Edge Surface
In Chapter 21, “Using Advanced 3D Features,” you learned how to use the Loft tool to draw a 
butterfly chair that has the shape of a draped fabric seat. Other 3D modeling tools have been 
introduced in recent AutoCAD releases that you could use to create the seat.
One tool to use in the butterfly chair example is the Edge Surface tool (see Figure 23.31). This 
tool is a bit trickier to use, only because the objects defining the surface must be selected in 
sequential order. In other words, you can’t randomly select the objects.
Here’s how it works:
	
1.	 On the Mesh tab’s Primitives panel, click the Modeling, Meshes, Edge Surface tool, or 
type Edgesurf↵.
	
2.	 Select the four objects that are the edges of the surface that you want to create. Make 
sure that you select the objects in clockwise or counterclockwise order. Don’t select them 
“crosswise.”

Creating Mesh Surfaces |  835  
Ruled Surface
The Ruled Mesh tool creates a surface mesh from two 2D objects such as lines, arcs, polylines, or 
splines. This is perhaps the simplest mesh tool to use since you have to click only two objects to 
form a mesh (see Figure 23.32). But like Edge Mesh, it has a tricky side. The location where you 
click will affect the way the mesh is generated. You’ll want to click the same side of each object 
unless you want the surface to twist, as shown in Figure 23.33.

836  | CHAPTER 23  Exploring 3D Mesh and Surface Modeling   
To create a ruled mesh, follow these steps:
	
1.	 On the Mesh tab’s Primitives panel, click the Modeling, Meshes, Ruled Surface tool, or 
type Rulesurf↵.
	
2.	 Click two objects that are not on the same XY plane. The mesh is created between the 
objects.
Tabulated Surface
The Tabulated Mesh tool is like an extrude tool for surfaces (see Figure 23.34). Chapter 20 
showed you how you can use the Extrude tool to create a 3D solid from a closed polygon. The 
Extrude tool will also work on open polygons, lines, and arcs, but it will extrude the object in 
only a perpendicular direction. The Tabulated Surface tool lets you “extrude” an object in a 
direction you control with a line. The line can point in any direction in space.

Converting Meshes to Solids |  837  
Here’s how to use it:
	
1.	 On the Mesh tab’s Primitives panel, click the Modeling, Meshes, Tabulated Surface tool in 
the Primitives panel, or enter Tabsurf↵.
	
2.	 Select the object that defines the profile of your mesh.
	
3.	 Click the object that defines the direction for the surface.
As with the other surface mesh tools, the point at which you select objects will affect the way 
the object is generated. For the tabulated mesh, the direction of the mesh depends on where you 
click the line that defines the surface direction.
Converting Meshes to Solids
We mentioned earlier that you could convert a mesh to a solid. In doing so, you can take advan-
tage of the many solid-editing tools available in AutoCAD. The Boolean tools can be especially 
useful in editing meshes that have been turned into solids.
Conversion is a fairly simple process using the tools in the Convert Mesh panel of the Mesh 
tab. Just click the Convert To Solid tool, or type Convtosolid↵, and then select the mesh or 
meshes that you want to convert. Press ↵ to complete the process. The Convert To Surface tool 
(Convtosurface↵) works in much the same way, but it creates a surface object instead of a solid.
When you convert a mesh to a solid, you have the option to apply more or less smoothing to 
the conversion process. The Smoothed, Optimized flyout in the Convert Mesh panel gives you 
four options. You can select one of these options before you use the Convert To Solid or Convert 
To Surface tool to get a different smoothing effect during the conversion. Table 23.1 describes 
these options and how they affect the conversion of meshes.
Table 23.1:	
Options on the Convert Mesh panel’s flyout
Option
Effect on mesh
Smoothed, Optimized
The mesh is smoothed, and the faces are merged.
Smoothed, Not Optimized
The mesh is smoothed but maintains the same number of faces as the original.
Faceted, Optimized
The facets are maintained, the smoothing remains the same, but planar faces 
are merged.
Faceted, Not Optimized
The facets are maintained, the smoothing remains the same, and the number 
of faces also remains the same.
Why Control Faces in the Conversion?
The mesh-to-solid conversion options shown in Table 23.1 may seem like overkill, but there is a good 
reason for offering these settings. Many of the solid-editing tools in the Home tab’s Solid Editing 
panel are designed to work on solid faces. You can apply many of these tools to the faces of a converted 
mesh. Having control over the way faces are converted from a mesh to a solid will give you some 
control over how you are able to edit the solid later. See Chapter 22 for more on the solid-editing tools.

838  | CHAPTER 23  Exploring 3D Mesh and Surface Modeling   
Understanding 3D Surfaces
So far in this book you’ve worked with 3D solids and meshes. A third type of 3D object called 
a surface completes the AutoCAD set of 3D modeling tools to make it a complete 3D modeling 
application in its own right.
Click the Surface tab, and you’ll see the Surface panels that offer the tools that you’ll need to 
work with surface modeling (see Figure 23.35).
Figure 23.35
The Surface tab and 
Ribbon panels
In the Create panel, you see a different set of tools from the Mesh and Solid tabs, but a hand-
ful should look familiar. The Loft, Sweep, Extrude, and Revolve tools at the far left of the Create 
panel are tools that you’ve seen in previous chapters. These surface creation tools work in the 
same way as the tools of the same name in the Solid tab. In fact, they are essentially the same 
tools. They just use a different command option to create a surface instead of a solid. The big 
difference is that to create a solid, you need to start with a closed polyline. With the surface ver-
sion of the Loft, Sweep, Extrude, and Revolve tools, you can start with an open spline, polyline, 
or other object. And even if you do use a closed object such as a circle or closed polyline, you 
will still get a 3D surface instead of a solid (see Figure 23.36).

Understanding 3D Surfaces |  839  
Two other surface-creation tools that are unique to the Surface tab of the Ribbon are the 
Network Surface and Planar Surface tools. Here’s a brief description of each:
Network Surface Tool    The Network Surface tool lets you create a surface from several 
curves. The cue card for the Network Surface tool gives you a good idea of how this tool 
works (see Figure 23.37).
Drawing 2D Curves with the Curves Panel
Since 3D surfaces are derived from 2D objects, the Surface tab has the convenient Curves panel 
that offers most of the 2D drawing tools that you’ll need to build your surfaces from scratch. The 
Spline flyout even features the Spline Freehand tool, which will let you draw a curve “freehand” 
with a click and drag of your mouse. Experienced users will recognize this Spline Freehand tool as 
an updated version of the Sketch command.
Figure 23.37
The cue card descrip-
tion of the Network 
Surface tool
Planar Surface Tool    The Planar Surface tool creates a flat surface either by selecting two 
points to indicate a rectangular surface or by selecting a closed 2D object to create a flat sur-
face with an irregular boundary (see Figure 23.38).

Learning from Animated Cue Cards
Animated cue cards show you how many of the tools on the Surface Ribbon tab work. These ani-
mated cue cards can help get you up and running with surface modeling. Just hover over a tool 
for a moment after the tool tip appears. For tools that have animated cue cards, you will see the 
message “Video is loading” in the lower-right corner of the tool tip.
Editing Surfaces
Once created, surface objects have a unique set of editing tools that allow you to create fairly 
detailed models. Some tools, like Surface Fillet and Surface Trim, offer the same function as 
their 2D drawing counterparts. The following list includes a description of each tool:
Surface Fillet    With the Surface Fillet tool, you can join one surface to another with an inter-
mediate rounded surface (see Figure 23.39).
Figure 23.39
Using the Surface Fillet 
and Surface Trim tools
Surface Trim    The Surface Trim tool lets you trim one or several surfaces to other surfaces.
Surface Untrim    Surface Untrim does exactly what it says—it reverses a trim operation.
Surface Extend    The Surface Extend tool enables you to extend the edge of a surface beyond 
its current location. Unlike its 2D equivalent, it does not extend a surface to another surface 
object, though you could extend beyond a surface and then use the Trim tool.

Editing Surfaces |  841  
Surface Sculpt    The Surface Sculpt tool is like a super trim. You can align several surfaces 
to enclose a volume completely (the left image in Figure 23.40) and then use the Sculpt 
tool to trim all the surfaces at once into a completely closed 3D shape (the right image in 
Figure 23.40). By default, the new object is a solid.
Figure 23.40
The Surface Sculpt tool 
creates a container-like 
shape from several 
surfaces.
The Create panel also offers three other tools that could be considered editing tools. Blend, 
Patch, and Offset need existing surfaces to do their job, so they may seem a bit like editing tools. 
Here’s a description of each:
Surface Blend    Surface Blend will connect two surfaces with an intermediate surface.
Surface Patch    The Surface Patch tool will close an open surface like the end of a tube. 
Surface Patch also lets you control whether the closing “patch” is flat or curved, as shown in 
Figure 23.41.
Figure 23.41
The Surface Patch tool 
can create a flat or 
rounded patch over an 
open surface.
Open surface
Flat patch
Curved patch
Surface Offset    Surface Offset, like the Surface Trim tool, mimics its 2D counterpart. It will 
create a new surface that is parallel to the original. When you start the Surface Offset tool 
from the Create panel and select a surface, you’ll see arrows indicating the direction of the 
offset. You can type F↵ to flip the direction of the offset. Enter a distance for the offset, and 
press ↵ to create the offset surface (see Figure 23.42).

842  | CHAPTER 23  Exploring 3D Mesh and Surface Modeling   
Using Extrude, Surface Trim, and Surface Fillet
Now that you have an overview of the basic surface modeling tools, try the following set of exer-
cises to see how they work.
Using the Extrude Tool
Start with the Extrude tool on two basic shapes:
	
1.	 Open the Surfaces1.dwg file from the sample folder.
	
2.	 Choose Extrude from the Surface tab’s Create panel.
	
3.	 Click the circle in the drawing, and then press ↵. A surface appears and its length 
changes as you move the cursor.
	
4.	 Adjust the surface height to 5 units so that it looks similar to Figure 23.43 on the right.
	
5.	 Click Extrude again and extrude the arc horizontally –5 units while your cursor is left of 
the arc so that it looks similar to the extrusion on the right side of Figure 23.43.
As you can see, the Extrude tool is similar to the Extrude tool in the Solid tab in how it works, 
but the objects created are surfaces.

el’s Surface Offset tool

Figure 23.43

arc (left image) 5 units

Editing Surfaces |  843  
Using the Surface Trim Tool
The Surface Trim tool is similar to the 2D Trim tool, except that there is an additional step at the 
beginning where you select the object that you intend to trim. At first this step seems redun-
dant, but after you use the tool for a while, it begins to make more sense. Also notice that the 
original arc that you used to extrude the arc surface is still there. You’ll use that a little later in 
this chapter.
Next try out the Surface Trim tool:
	
1.	 Click Surface Trim in the Surface tab’s Edit panel.
	
2.	 Click both the cylinder and the extruded arc surface, and then press ↵. This first step 
selects the objects to trim.
	
3.	 Click both objects again, and then press ↵. This time you’re selecting the objects to trim 
to. You want to trim the top of the cylinder to the arc and the arc to the cylinder.
	
4.	 Finally, click the cylinder near the top edge to indicate what part you want to trim. The 
cursor will not display a pickbox during this process, and selection windows are dis-
abled. Also click the extruded arc surface anywhere outside the cylinder. Press ↵ to end 
the command. Your surfaces should look like the right-side image in Figure 23.44.
Figure 23.44
Trimming the surfaces
Click the top edge
of the cylinder.
Click the extruded arc anywhere
outside the cylinder.
Using the Surface Fillet Tool
Now try out the Surface Fillet tool:
	
1.	 Click the Surface Fillet tool in the Surface tab’s Edit panel.
	
2.	 Click the top surface, and then click the cylinder. The two surfaces are “filleted,” as 
shown in Figure 23.45.
	
3.	 The following prompt appears: Press Enter to accept the fillet surface or 
[Radius/Trim surfaces]. Type R↵ to enter a different radius.
	
4.	 Type 0.5↵. The radius changes. You still have the opportunity to change the radius again.

844  | CHAPTER 23  Exploring 3D Mesh and Surface Modeling   
Figure 23.45
Using the Surface Fillet 
tool
	
5.	 Type R↵, and then type 0.2↵. The radius changes again.
	
6.	 Press ↵ to finish the fillet.
In this case, we created a fillet all the way around the top of the cylinder. While you’re creat-
ing surface fillets, you’ll see a preview of what the new surface will look like. You don’t have 
to stick with that fillet until you fully finish the command; you are free to make changes to the 
fillet until then.
Using Surface Blend, Patch, and Offset
As mentioned earlier, a few of the tools on the Create panel are a bit like editing tools. Surface 
Blend, Surface Patch, and Surface Offset create new surfaces that use existing surfaces as their 
basis. Surface Blend is a bit like the Surface Fillet tool in that it will join two surfaces with an 
intermediate surface. Surface Offset creates a new surface that is parallel to an existing one and 
is similar to the 2D offset command. Surface Patch will create a surface that closes an open-
ended surface.
To get a better idea of how these three tools work, try the following set of exercises. Start by 
creating a parallel copy of an existing surface using the Offset tool:
	
1.	 Open the Patch1.dwg sample file from the Chapter 23 sample folder.
	
2.	 Click the Surface Offset tool in the Surface tab’s Create panel.
	
3.	 Click the surface in the drawing, and then press ↵. You see a set of arrows appear, as 
shown in the left image of Figure 23.46.
	
4.	 Type F↵. The arrows now point in the opposite direction.

Editing Surfaces |  845  
Figure 23.46
Using the Surface 
Offset tool
	
5.	 Type F↵ again to return the arrows to their previous direction facing outward.
	
6.	 Enter 0.5↵ for the offset distance. The offset surface appears around the original surface, 
as shown on the right in Figure 23.46.
Here you see how the Surface Offset tool differs from the 2D Offset tool that you’ve seen in 
Chapter 18, “Drawing Curves.” The arrows play an important role in helping you visualize the 
result of your offset, so instead of picking a direction, you adjust the direction of the arrows.
Using the Surface Blend Tool
Now try the Surface Blend tool:
	
1.	 Use the Move command to move the outer surface vertically in the z-axis roughly 5 units. 
Remember that you can hold down the Shift key to restrain the cursor to the z-axis. If you 
see the Surface Associativity message, click Continue. You’ll learn more about associativ-
ity later in this chapter.
	
2.	 Adjust your view so that you can see both surfaces, and then click the Surface Blend tool 
in the Surface tab’s Create panel.
	
3.	 Click to select the eight edges along the top of the lower surface, as shown in Figure 23.47. 
When you’re sure that you’ve selected all the edges, press ↵. You can also select the Chain 
option, which will find all edges that are connected.
	
4.	 Select the eight edges along the bottom of the upper surface, as shown in Figure 23.47. 
When you’re sure that you’ve selected all the edges, press ↵. A new preview surface 
appears that joins the upper and lower surfaces.

5.	 You might notice a couple of grip arrowheads that appear along the top and bottom edge 
of the new blend surface. Click one of them, and a menu appears offering three options: 
Position, Tangent, and Curvature (see Figure 23.48).
	
6.	 Click Curvature, and then press ↵ to place the blend surface.
The Surface Blend tool offers a number of options that control the shape of the blend surface. 
You saw three options available from the grip arrowhead. The options are available even after 
you have placed the surface. You can click the surface to expose the grip arrowheads.

Editing Surfaces |  847  
In addition, the Surface Blend tool offers two command options: CONtinuity and Bulge 
Magnitude. Table 23.2 in the next section describes these features and their functions.
Using the Surface Patch Tool
Now let’s take a look at the Surface Patch tool. This tool lets you close the end of a surface with 
another surface. You can add a flat or curved surface, as you’ll see in the next exercise.
Try adding a patch surface to the top of the upper surface in the Patch1.dwg model:
	
1.	 Pan your view so that you can clearly see the top of the surface model, as shown in the 
left image in Figure 23.49.
Figure 23.49
Adding the patch sur-
face to the end of the 
model
Select the top edges.
	
2.	 Click the Surface Patch tool in the Surface tab’s Create panel.
	
3.	 Select the edges of the surface, as shown in Figure 23.49.
	
4.	 Press ↵ when you are sure that you’ve selected all the edges. The patch surface appears.
	
5.	 Click the grip arrowhead that appears along the edge of the patch and select Tangent. The 
surface is now curved.
	
6.	 Press ↵ to finish the patch surface.
	
7.	 To get a better view of the surface, select the Shaded With Edges option from the Visual 
Styles drop-down list in the Visualize tab’s Visual Styles panel. Your model should 
resemble the right side of Figure 23.49.
You may have noticed that the grip arrowhead options in step 5 were similar to the grip 
options that you saw for the Surface Blend tool. The Surface Patch tool offers an additional com-
mand option called CONStrain Geometry. Table 23.2 describes these options.

848  | CHAPTER 23  Exploring 3D Mesh and Surface Modeling   
Understanding Associativity
You may have noticed the Surface Associativity icon in the Create panel. This feature is on by 
default, and its function is similar to the Associative feature of hatches (see Chapter 7, “Mastering 
Viewing Tools, Hatches, and External References,” for more on hatches). You may recall that 
when you create a 2D hatch pattern with the hatch associative feature turned on, the hatch’s 
shape will conform to any changes made to the boundary used to enclose the hatch pattern.
The Associativity feature in surface modeling works in a similar way, only instead of a hatch 
pattern conforming to changes in a boundary, the surface conforms to changes in the shapes 
that are used to create them. For example, if you were to make changes to the arc that you used 
to extrude the arc surface, the arc surface and the trimmed cylinder would also follow the 
changes.
Using Associativity to Edit a Surface Model
This concept is a bit tricky to explain. Try the following exercise to see how associativity works:
	
1.	 Return to the Surfaces1.dwg file, and click the arc to expose its grips.
	
2.	 Click the square grip at the arc’s left endpoint and drag it downward along the z-axis. 
When it is roughly in the position shown in Figure 23.50, click again to fix the grip’s loca-
tion. The shape of the surface model changes to conform to the new shape of the arc.
	
3.	 Zoom into the top of the surface model so that you have a view similar to Figure 23.51.
	
4.	 Click the filleted portion of the surface. An arrowhead grip appears.
	
5.	 Click the arrowhead grip. Another arrowhead grip appears.
	
6.	 Click this arrowhead grip, and slowly drag it toward the center of the cylinder. Notice 
that the radius of the fillet changes as you move the grip.

Using Arrowhead Grips to Edit a Surface
You’ve just seen the Associativity feature in action. You can also change the shape of the circle 
used to extrude the cylinder to modify the surface model’s diameter. Additional hidden grips 
are available that allow you to adjust the shape of the surfaces directly. For example, you can 
modify the taper of the cylinder using an arrowhead grip that you can turn on using the 
Properties palette, as shown in these steps:
	
1.	 Make sure that Dynamic Input is on in the status bar. Click the cylindrical part of the sur-
face model.
	
2.	 Right-click and select Properties.

850  | CHAPTER 23  Exploring 3D Mesh and Surface Modeling   
	
3.	 Scroll down to the bottom of the Properties palette to the Surface Associativity panel.
	
4.	 Click the Show Associativity option, and select Yes.
	
5.	 Close the Properties palette.
	
6.	 At the top of the cylinder, click the right-pointing arrowhead grip to the right. As you 
do this, you see the dynamic display showing you an angle (see the image on the left in 
Figure 23.52).
	
7.	 Position the arrowhead grip so that the angle shows 6, and then click to fix the grip in 
place. The cylinder is now tapered, and the top surface conforms to the new shape, as 
shown in the image on the right in Figure 23.52.
Figure 23.52
Changing the taper of 
the cylinder
Click and drag this
arrowhead grip.
Surface Associativity can be very useful, but in order to take full advantage of this feature, 
you will want to plan your model construction carefully. In addition, the Associativity feature 
can limit some editing and creation functions. For example, the Surface Fillet tool may not work 
on a complex surface model with associativity turned on but will work when the associativity is 
turned off for the objects involved.
Turning Off or Removing Associativity
You can turn off or remove associativity for an object through the Properties palette. Select 
the object, and then right-click and select Properties. In the Properties palette, scroll down the 
palette to the Surface Associativity group (see Figure 23.53). This group offers two options: 
Maintain Associativity and Show Associativity. The Maintain Associativity option offers Yes, 
Remove, and None.

Editing Surfaces |  851  
Constraints, Surfaces, and Associativity
In Chapter 16, “Making ‘Smart’ Drawings with Parametric Tools,” you learned that you can add 
constraints to objects to control their behavior. With Surface Associativity turned on, you can 
extrude constrained objects and the resulting surface will also follow the constraints of the source 
2D objects. But remember that if you use constraints with 3D surfaces in this way, you need to plan 
the way you build your model carefully to make efficient use of the constraints.
Figure 23.53
The Surface Associativity 
group in the Properties 
palette
Maintain associativity
Show associativity
You can select Remove to remove associativity altogether or None to limit the associativity to 
the set of objects currently associated with the surface model. After you change this setting, you 
can’t return to a previous setting except with the Undo command.
Editing with Control Vertices
So far, you’ve been creating what are called procedural surfaces, which are surfaces that allow 
you to take advantage of associativity. AutoCAD also allows you to create NURBS surfaces. You 
may recall that splines are also NURBS, so you might think of a NURBS surface as a kind of 3D 
surface spline. Splines allow you to move, add, or subtract control vertices (CVs), and you can 
control the way the CVs “pull” on the curve of the spline. Likewise, NURBS surfaces allow you 
to add or remove CVs and adjust the direction and force of the CVs.
There are two ways to create a NURBS surface. You can turn on the NURBS Creation option 
in the Surface tab’s Create panel and then go about creating your 3D surfaces. Any 3D surface 
you create with this option turned on will be a NURBS surface. Or you can convert an existing 
surface to a NURBS surface.
Converting a Surface to a NURBS Surface
You can convert an existing surface to a NURBS surface by using the Convert To NURBS tool on 
the Surface tab’s Control Vertices panel. This tool also converts 3D solids and meshes. To use it, 
follow these steps:
	
1.	 Open the CVedit1.dwg sample file.
	
2.	 Turn on Surface Associativity in the Surface tab’s Create panel.

852  | CHAPTER 23  Exploring 3D Mesh and Surface Modeling   
	
3.	 Turn off NURBS Creation in the Surface tab’s Create panel.
	
4.	 Click the Extrude tool in the Surface tab’s Create panel.
	
5.	 Click the spline and press ↵.
	
6.	 Point the cursor upward, and type 6↵ to make the extruded surface 6 units in the z-axis.
	
7.	 Click the Convert to NURBS tool in the Surface tab’s Control Vertices panel.
	
8.	 Select the surface that you extruded in step 4 and press ↵. The surface is now a NURBS 
surface.
If you want to create NURBS objects, be sure to turn on NURBS Creation. It’s easier to create 
objects as NURBS than to have to go through the extra step of converting them later.
Exposing CVs to Edit a NURBS Surface
You’ve just created a NURBS surface. You can expose the CVs for the surface using the Show CV 
tool. Follow these steps to view and edit the CVs:
	
1.	 Click the Surface CV – Show tool in the Control Vertices panel.
	
2.	 Click the surface that you just created and press ↵. The CVs appear for the surface.
	
3.	 Click the surface to select it, and then click the CV, as shown in Figure 23.54.
Figure 23.54
Exposing the CVs
Click and drag this CV along the y-axis.
	
4.	 Move the CV in the y-axis, and note how the surface deforms. The top edge moves with 
the CV, whereas the bottom edge maintains its shape.
	
5.	 Press the Esc key twice to clear your selection.
In this exercise, you saw how you can gain access to the CVs of a NURBS surface to make 
changes to the shape. Right now, the CVs are located only at the top and bottom of the surface, 
but you can add more CVs to give you more control over the shape of the surface.

dialog box
Adding CVs to a NURBS Surface
The next exercise shows you how you can add additional CVs through the Rebuild option:
	
1.	 Click the Surface – Rebuild tool in the Control Vertices panel, and then click the surface. 
Or you can click the surface to select it and then right-click and select NURBS Editing ➢ 
Rebuild. The Rebuild Surface dialog box appears (see Figure 23.55).
What Are the U and V Directions?
While working in 3D, you’ll see references to the U and V directions. You can think of these as the 
x- and y-axes of a 3D surface. There is also a W direction, which corresponds to the z-axis, or the 
normal direction of a surface.
	
2.	 In the Control Vertices Count group of the Rebuild Surface dialog box, make sure that the 
In U Direction option is set to 8 and the In V Direction option is set to 7. You’ll see what 
these settings do in a moment.
	
3.	 Click OK. Now you see that many more CVs are available.
In step 2, you specified the number of CVs that you want in the U and V directions. The U 
direction is along the horizontal curve, and the V direction is along the straight, vertical direc-
tion. If you count the CVs in each row or column, you’ll see that they match the values that you 
entered in step 2.
Now if you were to move a CV, the surface is able to deform along the z-axis, whereas it 
remained a straight line before.
The Rebuild Surface dialog box offers a number of other options that you’ll want to know 
about. Table 23.3 gives you a rundown.

Two other tools just below the Surface Rebuild tool allow you either to add or remove a set of 
CVs. The Surface CV – Add tool lets you place a row of CVs. The Surface CV – Remove tool will 
remove a row of CVs. Both options allow you to toggle between the U and V directions for the 
row addition or removal by typing D↵.
The Surface CV Add and Remove tools can be useful when you want to fine-tune the cur-
vature of a surface. Where you want a “tighter” curve, you can add more CVs to an area of the 
surface. You can then move the CVs in the selected area to increase the curvature. To smooth out 
the curvature of an area, remove the CVs.
Editing with the CV Edit Bar
You’ve seen how a NURBS surface can be set up to add additional CVs, which in turn allow you 
to adjust the shape of the surface. But the CVs by themselves allow you to adjust their pull on 
the surface only by moving them closer to or farther away from the surface.
The CV Edit bar gives you more control over the behavior of individual CVs. With the CV 
Edit bar, you can change the strength and direction of the “pull” exerted by a CV.
Try the following exercise to see how the CV Edit bar works:
	
1.	 Click the Surface CV Edit Bar tool in the Control Vertices panel.
	
2.	 Select the surface. Now as you move the cursor across the surface, you see two red lines 
that follow the U and V directions of the surface (see Figure 23.56).

Editing Surfaces |  855  
	
3.	 Click the point shown in Figure 23.56. A Move gizmo appears along with two other fea-
tures called the magnitude handle and the expansion grip (see Figure 23.57).
Figure 23.56
The CV Edit bar’s U and 
V directions are shown 
by two red lines.
Figure 23.57
The magnitude handle 
and expansion grips
Magnitude handle
Expansion grip
The Move gizmo gives you a bit more control over the location of the CV since it allows you 
to isolate movement in the X, Y, or Z direction. The expansion grip lets you change the tangency 
of the CV, whereas the magnitude grip lets you control the strength of the CV.
Perform these steps to see how these two features work:
	
1.	 Click the expansion grip, and select the Tangent Direction option. Notice that the Move 
gizmo switches to the location of the expansion grip.
	
2.	 Hover over the green y-axis of the gizmo, and when you see the green y-axis vector, click 
and drag the mouse. Notice how the surface warps as you move the mouse. If you look 
carefully at the CV Edit bar, you see that it pivots around the new location of the expan-
sion grip—the CV location.

856  | CHAPTER 23  Exploring 3D Mesh and Surface Modeling   
	
3.	 Press the Esc key to release the y-axis, and then click the expansion grip and choose the 
Move Point option. The Move gizmo returns to its original location at the CV.
	
4.	 Now click the magnitude handle, and move it horizontally. You see that the surface is 
“pulled” in both directions of the U direction of the surface.
	
5.	 Press the Esc key to release the magnitude handle.
	
6.	 Right-click the CV Edit bar, and select V Tangent Direction. Notice that the magnitude 
handle changes its orientation so that it is aligned to the V direction of the surface.
	
7.	 Click and drag the magnitude handle to see how it affects the surface.
	
8.	 Press the Esc key twice to exit the CV Edit bar.
As you can see from this exercise, the CV Edit bar gives you much more control over a CV 
than you would have otherwise. You also saw the context menu for the CV Edit bar in step 6 (see 
Figure 23.58). The context menu allows you to change the direction of the magnitude grip, but it 
also lets you switch the position of the Move gizmo and the expansion grip with the Move Point 
Location and Move Tangent Direction options. The Relocate option lets you move to a different 
CV location. Table 23.4 includes descriptions of these options.

Making Holes in a Surface with the Project Geometry Panel
Eventually, you’ll need to place an opening in a surface, so AutoCAD offers the Project 
Geometry panel. This panel contains several tools that allow you to project a closed 2D object’s 
shape onto a 3D surface. For example, if you want to place a circular hole in the surface that you 
edited in the previous exercise, you would draw a circle parallel to that surface and then use the 
Surface Projection UCS tool.
The following exercise shows you how the Project Geometry feature works:
	
1.	 Select Hide CV on the Control Vertices panel of the Surface tab, and then select the Layer 
Properties tool from the Layers panel of the Home tab.
	
2.	 Turn on the Circle layer. A circle appears in the drawing.
	
3.	 Type UCS↵, and then type OB↵. This lets you align the UCS to an object.
	
4.	 Click the circle to align the UCS to it.
	
5.	 In the Surface tab’s Project Geometry panel, click the Surface Auto Trim tool to turn it on.
	
6.	 Click the Surface Projection UCS tool in the Project Geometry panel.
	
7.	 Click the circle and press ↵.
	
8.	 Click the surface. The circle is projected onto the surface, and the area inside the projected 
circle is trimmed (see Figure 23.59).
Figure 23.59
The circle projected 
onto the surface
Table 23.4:	
The CV Edit bar’s right-click options   (continued)

858  | CHAPTER 23  Exploring 3D Mesh and Surface Modeling   
In this exercise, you aligned the UCS to the circle. The Surface Projection UCS tool that you 
used in step 6 projected the circle in the z-axis of this new UCS that is aligned with the circle.
The other two Project Geometry tools use different criteria to project geometry. The Surface 
Projection View projects geometry along the line of sight. If you had used this tool in the previ-
ous exercise, the projected circle and opening would appear directly behind the circle in your 
current view. The Surface Projection Vector projects geometry along a vector that you indicate 
with two points. You can use the 3D object snaps to select points on the geometry and the 
surface.
Visualizing Curvature: Understanding the Analysis Panel
In addition to the surface editing tools, AutoCAD offers several surface analysis options. These 
options offer some visual aids to help you see the curvature of your surface models more clearly. 
They can be found in the Analysis panel of the Surface tab and are called Analysis Zebra, 
Analysis Curvature, and Analysis Draft.
Analysis Zebra displays stripes that let you better visualize how the curvatures of surfaces 
blend (see Figure 23.60). The smoother the stripes, the better the transition between surfaces.
Figure 23.60
The cue card descrip-
tion for Analysis Zebra
Analysis Curvature displays colors to indicate the direction and amount of curvature in a 
surface (see Figure 23.61). As the cue card describes, a negative curvature is a saddle shape and 
displays a blue color. A positive curvature, or bowl shape, displays in red.

Editing Surfaces |  859  
Analysis Draft displays colors to help you determine draft angles (see Figure 23.62). Draft 
angles are often used in the design of objects that are to be cast from a mold, and they are 
important in allowing the cast object to be removed easily from the mold.

860  | CHAPTER 23  Exploring 3D Mesh and Surface Modeling   
The Analysis Options tool opens the Analysis Options dialog box, where you can control the 
way the different analysis tools are displayed. Note that graphics hardware acceleration must be 
turned on before you can use these tools. You must also use a visual style other than Wireframe.
To turn on graphics hardware acceleration, right-click the Hardware Acceleration tool in the 
right portion of the status bar and select Hardware Acceleration.
Using the 3D Object Snaps
You may have noticed the 3D Object Snap tool in the status bar:
It might not be turned on. Click the Customization button on the far right of the status bar to bring 
up a list of possible status bar icons. Click the 3D Object Snap option to turn it on. This tool works 
in a way similar to the Object Snap tool that you’ve used in earlier chapters. When the 3D Object 
Snap tool is on, you can snap to geometry on 3D objects. If you right-click this tool, you’ll see the 
list of locations to which you can snap:
You can think of the 3D Object Snap tool as an extension of the standard set of object snaps that 
allow you to pick locations on 3D solids, meshes, and surfaces. Right-click the 3D Object Snap 
tool, and select Settings. You will see the Drafting Settings dialog box open to the 3D Object 
Snap tab. There you can choose which 3D object snap you want to appear as the default when 
this tool is turned on.

Using Workspaces
When you’re comfortable with AutoCAD, you may find that you like a certain arrangement of 
Ribbon panels, toolbars, and palettes or that you have several sets of panels and toolbars that you 
like to use, depending on your type of work. You’ve already worked with two of the workspaces 
AutoCAD offers out of the box: Drafting & Annotation and 3D Modeling. You can also set up your 
own custom panel and toolbar arrangements and then save those arrangements for later retrieval 
using the Workspace feature. Let’s take a closer look at how you can create a custom workspace.
The Workspace Switching tool and its menu are shown in Figure 24.1. In the “Getting to Know 
the 3D Modeling Workspace” section in Chapter 20, “Creating 3D Drawings,” you saw how you 
can use this tool to switch to a 3D modeling workspace. You can save several arrangements of 
panels, toolbars, and palettes and then recall them easily by selecting them from the Workspace 
Switching tool in the status bar or the Workspace drop-down list in the Quick Access toolbar.

866  | CHAPTER 24  Customizing Toolbars, Menus, Linetypes, and Hatch Patterns   
Figure 24.1
The Workspace  
Switching tool
Click the Workspace Switching tool on the status bar, and select Workspace Settings to open 
the Workspace Settings dialog box, as shown in Figure 24.2. You can also select Workspace 
Settings from the Workspace drop-down list in the Quick Access toolbar or type Wssettings↵.
Figure 24.2
The Workspace 
Settings dialog box
With the Workspace Settings dialog box open, you can see the Drafting & Annotation, 3D 
Basics, and 3D Modeling options. If you’ve used the Initial Setup Wizard to create an industry-
specific workspace, you’ll see the Initial Setup Workspace option here as well. From here, you 
can control the behavior of the settings.
The check box next to each setting lets you control whether the item appears in the 
Workspace Switching tool menu. For example, if you remove the check mark from the 3D Basics 
setting, you’ll see only Drafting & Annotation and 3D Modeling in the Workspace Switching 
tool menu.
The My Workspace drop-down list lets you select which workspace setting is activated when 
you click the My Workspace tool on the Workspace toolbar. You can use this option for your 
most frequently used workspace settings.
The options in the When Switching Workspaces group at the bottom of the Workspace 
Settings dialog box let you determine whether workspace changes are saved automatically. For 
example, if you select Automatically Save Workspace Changes, then the next time you switch to 
a different workspace setting, AutoCAD will save any changes that you’ve made to the current 
workspace.

Customizing the User Interface |  867  
The Workspace Switching tool is the easiest customization feature that you’ll find in 
AutoCAD, and it can go a long way toward helping you stay organized. But workspaces are 
just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to customizing AutoCAD. Next, you’ll delve into the 
Customize User Interface (CUI) feature to see how you can customize the AutoCAD menus, 
panels, and toolbars directly.
Are You in the Right Workspace?
The exercises in this chapter assume that you are in the Drafting & Annotation workspace.
Customizing the User Interface
Out of the box, AutoCAD offers a generic arrangement of Ribbon panels, tools, and palettes that 
works fine for most applications. But the more you use AutoCAD, the more you may find that you 
tend to use tools that are scattered over several Ribbon panels. You’ll probably feel that your work 
would go more easily if you could create a custom set of panels and menus to consolidate those tools. 
If you’re at the point of creating custom macros, you may want a way to have easy access to them.
The Customize User Interface (CUI) dialog box is a one-stop location that gives you nearly total 
control over the menus, panels, and toolbars in AutoCAD. With the CUI feature, you can mold 
the AutoCAD interface to your liking. The main entry point to the CUI is the Customize User 
Interface dialog box.
The following section introduces you to the CUI by showing you how to add a tool to the 
Draw Ribbon panel. You’ll also get a chance to see how to create an entirely new panel and cus-
tom tools.
Taking a Quick Customization Tour
The most direct way to adapt AutoCAD to your way of working is to customize the Ribbon. 
AutoCAD offers new users an easy route to customization through the Customize User Interface 
dialog box. With this dialog box, you can create new Ribbon panels and toolbars, customize 
tools, and even create new icons. You can also create keyboard shortcuts.
To get your feet wet, try adding a tool to the Draw panel:
	
1.	 If it’s still open, close the Workspace Settings dialog box.
	
2.	 Click the User Interface tool in the Manage tab’s Customization panel to open the 
Customize User Interface dialog box, shown in Figure 24.3. You can also type CUI↵. You 
see three groups in this dialog box: Customizations In All Files, Command List, and 
Properties.
	
3.	 In the Customizations In All Files group, expand the Ribbon option and then expand the 
Panels option that appears just below. Scroll down the list and expand the Home 2D – 
Draw option. You see a set of options labeled Row 1, Row 2, and so on.
	
4.	 Click the Home 2D – Draw option. A view of the Draw Ribbon panel appears in the Panel 
Preview area (see Figure 24.4).

868  | CHAPTER 24  Customizing Toolbars, Menus, Linetypes, and Hatch Patterns

panel appears.

Customizing the User Interface |  869  
	
5.	 Expand the Row 3 item under the Home 2D – Draw option. You’ll see the names of the 
several tools that appear at the very bottom of the Draw panel. These tools are Region, 
Wipeout, 3D Polyline, Helix, Donut, and Revision Cloud.
	
6.	 In the Command List group, select Dimension from the Filter The Command List By 
Category drop-down list (see Figure 24.5).
Figure 24.5
Choose the 
Dimension category.
	
7.	 In the bottom panel of the Command List group, scroll down the list and then locate 
and select Dimension, Linear. This is the Linear Dimension command. When you 
select Linear, the Properties group displays the properties of the Linear command. The 
Panel Preview area changes to show the Button Image group, and you see the Linear 
Dimension icon, as shown in Figure 24.6.
	
8.	 Carefully click and drag the Dimension, Linear item from the Command List group into 
the Customizations In All Files group, but don’t release the mouse button yet. As you 
drag the item over the tool names in the Customizations In All Files group, a bar tells you 
where your dragged item will appear (see Figure 24.6). If you pause over a folder option 
that contains a list of commands, you’ll see an arrowhead appear next to the option. The 
arrowhead also indicates where the dragged command will be placed. The list may auto-
matically scroll up or down depending on where you place the bar. This is to allow you to 
place the bar in an area of the list that isn’t currently displayed.
	
9.	 Place the bar just above 3D Polyline, and release the mouse button. Dimension, Linear 
appears above 3D Polyline in the list (see Figure 24.7), and though it may be difficult to 
see, the Dimension Linear icon appears in the Panel Preview area.

870  | CHAPTER 24  Customizing Toolbars, Menus, Linetypes, and Hatch Patterns

area changes when 
you select an element 
from the Command 
List group or the 
Customizations In All 
Files group.
The bar tells you where the command will be placed.

10.	 Click OK. The next time you check, you’ll see the Dimension, Linear tool appear in the 
expanded Draw panel just to the left of the 3D Polyline tool (see Figure 24.8).
Figure 24.8
The tool is in place.
You’ve just added a command to the Draw panel. You can follow the previous steps to add 
any command to any Ribbon panel, toolbar, or menu bar menu. Now suppose that you change 
your mind, and you decide to remove Dimension, Linear from the Draw panel. Here’s how it’s 
done:
	
1.	 Click User Interface in the Manage tab’s Customization panel, or type CUI↵.
	
2.	 In the Customizations In All Files group of the Customize User Interface dialog box, 
expand the Ribbon option and Panels option and then continue to expand options as you 
did before to get to the Dimension, Linear command that you added earlier.
	
3.	 Click Dimension, Linear, and then right-click and choose Remove from the context menu. 
You’ll see a warning message asking if you “really want to delete this element.”
	
4.	 Click Yes. The Dimension, Linear command is removed.
	
5.	 Click OK to close the dialog box.
Dimension, Linear has been removed from the Draw panel. As you’ve just seen, adding tools 
to a panel is a matter of clicking and dragging the appropriate item from one list to another. To 
remove tools, right-click the tool and select Remove.
Before you go too much further, you may want to know a little more about the Customize 
User Interface dialog box and how it works. You saw briefly how each group displayed different 
elements of the AutoCAD interface, from a listing of panel tools to an individual tool’s icon. Let’s 
look at each group independently to see how it’s organized.
Understanding the Customizations In All Files Panel
In the previous exercise, where you placed the Dimension, Linear command in the Draw panel, 
you saw an arrowhead appear when you hovered over a folder option. The arrowhead indicates 
where the command will be placed when you release the mouse button. If you see a horizontal 

872  | CHAPTER 24  Customizing Toolbars, Menus, Linetypes, and Hatch Patterns   
bar appear between a list of commands, the new command will be placed at the location indi-
cated by the bar. If the item is a folder icon, the new command will be placed inside that folder.
You may see items called Sub-Panel options. These allow you to mix single tools and rows 
like the Line tool and the three rows that you see to the right of the Line tool at the top of 
the Draw panel. Finally, the <SLIDEOUT> item that you see in the list indicates the division 
between the main part of the panel and the expanded panel. Figure 24.9 shows how the list in 
the Customizations In All Files group relates to the Ribbon panel components.
Figure 24.9
The Customizations 
In All Files list com-
pared to the Ribbon 
panel preview
Notice that the Line, Polyline, Circle, and Arc tools straddle the two rows in the expanded 
Draw panel and are at the same level as the Sub-Panel 1 options of Rectangle, Ellipse, and 
Hatch. Placing the Line, Polyline, Circle, and Arc commands at the same level as the Sub-Panel 
1 option does this. The Sub-Panel 1 option is further divided into rows. Figure 24.10 shows how 
the rows appear when they are expanded. Flyouts on the Ribbon panel appear as “Drop-down” 
options in the Customizations In All Files group.
If you expand a Drop-down option, you’ll see the tools that appear in the flyouts of the tool 
in the panel (see Figure 24.11).

Customizing the User Interface |  873  
Figure 24.10
The Sub-Panel 1 option 
contains the rows that 
in turn contain flyouts 
labeled as Drop-down 
options.
Figure 24.11
The tools in the 
Customizations In All 
Files panel’s Drop-
down list appear in the 
appropriate flyout.
You can add new panels, rows, subpanels, and drop-downs (flyouts) by right-clicking an item 
in the list and selecting the appropriate option from the context menu (see Figure 24.12). These 
types of interface elements are called containers in the Customize User Interface dialog box.

874  | CHAPTER 24  Customizing Toolbars, Menus, Linetypes, and Hatch Patterns   
If you understand the structure of these lists, you’ll find that it is quite easy to customize the 
Ribbon panels to your liking.
Getting the Overall View
When you first opened the Customize User Interface dialog box, you saw a listing of the 
AutoCAD interface elements in the Customizations In All Files group. Just as you saw with the 
Ribbon panels, each of the other interface elements in the list can be expanded to get to its indi-
vidual commands. If you expand the Toolbars list, for example, all of the AutoCAD toolbars are 
available. Expand a toolbar and the commands contained in the toolbar are displayed. As you 
saw earlier, you can expand the Ribbon Panels list to gain access to the Ribbon panels. Table 24.1 
lists all of the interface elements in the Customizations In All Files group with a brief explana-
tion of their contents.

existing ones. Right-click any item to add or delete options. If you click an item, its properties 
appear in the Properties group, where you can modify the item’s function. Just as you added the 
Dimension, Linear command to the Draw panel, you can click and drag a command into one of 
the menus under the Menus listing to add a command there.
You also see some options in the Customizations In All Files title bar. These options give you 
control over what is displayed in this group. You can also load and save CUI files from here.

Adding a Panel Title Bar Command with the Panel Dialog Box Launcher
You may have noticed the Panel Dialog Box Launcher item that appears just below a panel name 
(when expanded) in the Customize User Interface dialog box. With this placeholder, you can add 
a command that will launch when you click an arrow icon in the right side of the panel title bar. 
You can see an example of such an icon in the Insert tab’s Reference panel or the Annotate tab’s 
Text and Dimensions panels. These arrow icons typically open dialog boxes that control the main 
features presented in the panel. For example, the one in the Annotate tab’s Text panel opens the 
Text Style dialog box.
To add a command to the Panel Dialog Box Launcher item, click and drag a command from 
the Command List area to the Panel Dialog Box Launcher item. To remove a command, right-
click the Panel Dialog Box Launcher item and select Remove Command. Click Yes to confirm 
the removal.
The Panel Dialog Box Launcher item is included automatically whenever you create a new panel.
Finding Commands in the Command List
You’ve already seen how the Command List group contains all of the commands in 
AutoCAD. You also saw that you can click and drag these items into options in the 
Customizations In All Files group. This list also contains predefined macros, icons used for 
tools, and control elements (called combo boxes in the Ribbon panels), which are the drop-
down lists that you see in panels and toolbars. The layer drop-down lists in the Layers panel 
and the lists in the Home tab’s Properties panel are examples of control elements. When you 
select an item in the Command List group, you see its properties in the Properties group or 
its icon in the Button Image group, or both. The control elements are the exception to this 
because they have no editable features.
Opening Preview, Button Image, and Shortcuts
You’ve already seen how you can get a preview of a Ribbon panel by selecting the panel from 
the Customizations In All Files group. If you click a Ribbon panel from the list, you’ll see the 
Panel Preview group, which shows you how the selected panel will appear. Previews aren’t edit-
able and are there for your reference.
If you click a tool listing—or element in AutoCAD nomenclature—in the Customizations In 
All Files group, you see the Button Image group. You can open this group by clicking the double 
arrowhead to the right of the Button Image group title bar. You may also need to adjust the bot-
tom border of the Button Image group downward so that you can see more of the group. This 
group lets you select an icon for that tool by clicking a list of icons (see Figure 24.13), or you can 
edit an existing icon or create an entirely new icon. You’ll get a chance to see this firsthand later 
in this chapter.
The Keyboard Shortcuts area in the Customizations In All Files group shows the Shortcuts 
group, which lists the existing keyboard shortcuts.

Customizing the User Interface |  877  
Getting to the Core of Customization in the Properties Group
Finally, when you’re ready to do some serious customizing, you’ll work with the Properties 
group. You see the Properties group in the lower half of the right side of the Customize User 
Interface dialog box when you select a command from the left side of the dialog box.
The Properties group is set up just like the Properties palette, and it works the same way. On 
the left side, you see a listing of options. To the right of each option is a description or a text box 
where you can make changes (see Figure 24.14).

showing the properties 
for the Line tool

878  | CHAPTER 24  Customizing Toolbars, Menus, Linetypes, and Hatch Patterns   
If you go to the Customizations In All Files group and select the Line tool under the Home 
2D – Draw option that you worked on earlier (Ribbon ➢ Panels ➢ Home 2D – Draw ➢ Row 1 
➢ Line), you see the properties for that tool in the Properties group, as shown in Figure 24.14. 
You’ll have to close the Button Image group to get a complete view of the Properties group. You 
can close any group by clicking the double arrow on the right side of the group’s title bar.
In the Command category, you see the Line tool’s name in the Command Name listing. You 
also see the description that is displayed in the tool tip for the Line tool. You can change this 
description here in the Properties group, and the description will change in the status bar.
In the Macro listing, you see the command as it would be entered through the keyboard. The 
^C^C that precedes the actual line command input is equivalent to pressing the Esc key twice. If 
you scroll down, you’ll see the Advanced category, which offers information regarding the ID 
of this particular tool. Finally, the Images category lists the name of the image files used for the 
Line tool icon. Two icons are listed: one for the large icon version and one for the small icon ver-
sion of the tool.
You’ll get a chance to work with the Properties group later in this chapter. Next you’ll try 
your hand at creating your own custom toolbar.
Creating Your Own Ribbon Panels and Menus
Earlier, we mentioned that you can collect your most frequently used tools into a custom Ribbon 
panel or toolbar. Now that you’ve familiarized yourself with the Customize User Interface dia-
log box, you can try the following exercise to create your own Ribbon panel:
	
1.	 If the Customize User Interface dialog box isn’t open, click User Interface in the Manage 
tab’s Customization panel.
	
2.	 In the Customizations In All Files group, expand the Ribbon option and then right-click 
Panels and choose New Panel. The list expands and you see a new panel called Panel1 at 
the bottom of the Panels list. The name Panel1 is highlighted and ready to be edited.
	
3.	 Replace Panel1 by typing My Panel to give your panel a distinct name (see Figure 24.15). 
As you type, the name changes. If you decide to change a panel name later, right-click a 
panel listing and then choose Rename.
Figure 24.15
The new Panel1 name 
changed to My Panel
You now have a custom Ribbon panel. You’ll want to start to populate your panel with some 
commands. You’ve already seen how this works, but to review, try adding a few commands:
	
1.	 Select Draw from the Filter The Command List By Category drop-down list. It’s the list 
that is below the Search box under Command List.
	
2.	 In the Command List group, locate the command that you want to add. In this instance, 
locate the Line tool.

Customizing the User Interface |  879  
	
3.	 Click and drag the Line command to your new panel so that you see an arrowhead point-
ing to the Row 1 option (see Figure 24.16).
Figure 24.16
Point to the Row 1 
option, and you’ll see 
the arrowhead appear.
	
4.	 Release the mouse button. The Line tool appears below Row 1.
	
5.	 Repeat steps 2, 3, and 4 to add more commands to your panel.
	
6.	 To add another row, right-click My Panel and select New Row. You can add more tools to 
your second row.
You can add several more rows to your panel, but after the first row, additional rows will 
be placed below <SLIDEOUT> in the expanded portion of the panel. You’ll see how the panel is 
placed in the Ribbon after the next exercise.
Deleting a Custom Tool or Panel
You can delete any tool from your custom panel by right-clicking the tool and choosing Remove 
while in the Customizations In All Files group of the Customize User Interface dialog box. You can 
also delete your entire panel using this method. Take care not to delete any of the panels that you 
want to keep.
Customizing Ribbon Panel Tools
Let’s move on to more serious customization. Suppose that you want to create an entirely new 
button with its own functions. For example, you might want to create a set of buttons that insert 
your favorite symbols. Or you might want to create a Ribbon panel containing a set of tools that 
open some of the other toolbars that are normally put away.
Creating a Custom Tool
Follow these steps to create a custom tool:
	
1.	 Open the Customize User Interface dialog box, expand the Ribbon Panels list, and then 
expand the My Panel list.
	
2.	 In the Command List panel title bar, click the Create A New Command tool. A new com-
mand called Command1 appears in the list of commands (see Figure 24.17).
	
3.	 Right-click the Command1 item, select Rename from the context menu, and change the 
name to Door.

880  | CHAPTER 24  Customizing Toolbars, Menus, Linetypes, and Hatch Patterns   
	
4.	 In the Properties group to the right, change Description to Insert a 36″ door.
Figure 24.17
Click the Create A New 
Command tool and a 
new command appears 
in the list.
	
5.	 Change the Macro option to the following:
^C^C-insert door;\36;;
	
6.	 Click and drag the Door element from the Command List panel into Row 1 of your My 
Panel item in the Customizations In All Files group. If you look at the Panel Preview 
group, you see that the Door tool that you just added appears as a blank tool. This hap-
pens when no icon has been assigned to the tool.
The series of keystrokes that you entered for the macro in step 5 are the same as those you 
would use to insert the door with the addition of a few special characters. The semicolons are 
equivalent to ↵, and the backward slash (\) is a special macro code that tells AutoCAD to pause 
the macro for user input. In this case, the pause allows you to select the insertion point for the 
door. The Properties group should look similar to Figure 24.18.
Figure 24.18

for your new custom 
tool that inserts a door 
block

Customizing the User Interface |  881  
You’ve created your panel, but it will not appear anywhere in the AutoCAD interface until 
you add it to a Ribbon tab group. Here’s how this is done:
	
1.	 Under your My Panel listing in the Customizations In All Files group, click the My Panel 
panel option that you just created and then right-click and select Copy.
	
2.	 In the Customizations In All Files group, scroll up to the top of the list and expand the 
Tabs option.
	
3.	 Right-click Home – 2D just below Ribbon ➢ Tabs, and then select Paste from the context 
menu. Your My Panel panel appears at the bottom of the Home – 2D list.
	
4.	 Click OK in the Customize User Interface dialog box to close it. Your panel appears in the 
Home tab of the Ribbon.
Next try the custom tool to make sure that it works:
	
1.	 Put a copy of the Door.dwg file in your My Documents folder.
	
2.	 Point to the Door tool in your My Panel panel in the Home tab. You see the Door tool tip.
	
3.	 Click the Door tool. The door appears in the drawing area at the cursor. It may appear 
very small because initially it’s being inserted at its default size of 1 unit.
	
4.	 Click a location to place the door, and then click a point to set the door rotation. The door 
appears in the drawing.
Locating Files So AutoCAD Can Find Them
A misplaced file is a common problem that you have to troubleshoot when you’re supporting an office 
full of AutoCAD users. AutoCAD tends to put files in a lot of different places. When it can’t find a file 
that it needs, it will give you an error message, or worse, it just won’t work. It helps to know where 
AutoCAD looks for files so that you can put the resources for your custom tools in the right places.
In the Door example, the door drawing used in your macro must be in the default folder, My 
Documents, or in the acad search path before the door will be inserted. For easy access, copy the 
Door.dwg file from the Chapter 4 project folder to the My Documents folder.

882  | CHAPTER 24  Customizing Toolbars, Menus, Linetypes, and Hatch Patterns   
In this example, you created a custom tool that inserts the door block. Later in this chapter, 
you’ll learn more about creating macros for menus and tools. Next you’ll learn how to add a 
custom icon for your custom tool.
Creating a Custom Icon
You have all the essential parts of the button defined. Now you just need to create a custom icon 
to go with your Door button:
	
1.	 Open the Customize User Interface dialog box.
	
2.	 Expand the Customizations In All Files Ribbon list to your My Panel option (Ribbon ➢ 
Panels ➢ My Panel).
	
3.	 Expand the Row1 list, and select Door.
	
4.	 Open the Button Image group, and click any icon image. The icon appears in the Panel 
Preview group, replacing the blank image for your Door tool.
	
5.	 In the Button Image group, click the Edit button to open the Button Editor. The Button 
Editor is like a simple drawing program. Across the top are the tools for drawing lines, 
circles, and points as well as an eraser. Along the left side is a color toolbar from which 
you can choose colors for your icon. At the upper right, you see a preview of your button.
You Can Use the Existing Icons
If you prefer, you can use any of the predefined icons in the scroll box to the right of the Button 
Image group in the Customize User Interface dialog box. Click the icon that you want to use, and 
then click Apply.
	
6.	 Before you do anything else, click the Clear button. This clears the current image.
	
7.	 Draw the door icon shown in Figure 24.19. Don’t worry if it’s not perfect; you can always 
go back and fix it.
Figure 24.19
Draw this door icon.

Creating Macros in Tools and Menus |  883  
	
8.	 Click Save, and then at the Save Image dialog box, enter Door36 for the name. The door 
icon is saved in the AutoCAD CUI file that stores all of the interface data.
	
9.	 Click OK, and then click Close at the Button Editor dialog box.
	
10.	 Click OK to close the Customize User Interface dialog box. You see your custom icon for 
the Door tool.
The Button Editor behaves like a simplified image editing tool, and it is fairly straightforward 
to use. The only part that may be confusing is that you have to clear the image and save any new 
image under a new name.
You can continue to add more buttons to build a panel of symbols. Of course, you’re not 
limited to a symbols library. You can also incorporate your favorite macros or even AutoLISP® 
routines that you accumulate as you work with AutoCAD. The possibilities are endless.
Creating Macros in Tools and Menus
Combining existing commands into new panels or toolbars can be useful, but you’ll get 
even more benefit from the CUI by creating your own macros. Macros are predefined sets of 
responses to commands that can help automate your most frequently used processes.
Early on, you saw how a macro was included in a tool to insert a door. You added a special 
set of instructions in the Macro option of the Properties group to perform the door insertion and 
scale. You also saw how the Line command was formatted as part of a tool.
Let’s take a closer look at how macros are built. Start by looking at the existing Line tool and 
how it’s formatted.
The Macro option for the Line tool starts with two ^C elements, which are equivalent to 
pressing the Esc key twice. This cancels any command that is currently operative. The Line 
command follows, written just as it would be entered through the keyboard. Two Cancels are 
issued in case you’re in a command that has two levels, such as the Edit Vertex option of the 
Pedit command.
The underscore character (_) that precedes the Line command tells AutoCAD that you’re 
using the English-language version of this command. This feature lets you program non-English 
versions of AutoCAD by using the English-language command names.
What Is the Hyphen For?
In the previous door macro example, you used a hyphen in front of the Insert command. The hyphen 
causes the Insert command to run in the command line instead of using a dialog box, where the 
macro keyboard input will not work. Many commands will run in the command line when preceded 
with a hyphen.

884  | CHAPTER 24  Customizing Toolbars, Menus, Linetypes, and Hatch Patterns   
You may also notice that there is no space between the second ^C and the Line command. A 
space in the line would be the same as ↵. If there were a space between these two elements, ↵ 
would be entered between the last ^C and the Line command, causing the command sequence 
to misstep. Another way to indicate ↵ is by using the semicolon, as in the following example:
^C^C_Line;;
Help Make Your Macro Readable
If a menu macro contains multiple instances of ↵, using semicolons instead of spaces can help 
make your macro more readable.
In this sample menu option, the Line command is issued and then an additional ↵ is added. The 
effect of choosing this option is a line that continues from the last line entered into your drawing. 
The two semicolons following Line tell AutoCAD to start the Line command and then issue ↵ twice; 
the first ↵ starts the Line command, and then the second ↵ tells AutoCAD to begin a line from the 
endpoint of the last line entered. (AutoCAD automatically issues a single ↵ at the end of a menu line. 
In this case, however, you want two instances of ↵, so they must be represented as semicolons.)
Pausing for User Input
Another symbol used in the Macro option is the backslash (\); it’s used when a pause is required 
for user input. For example, the following sample macro starts the Arc command and then 
pauses for your input:
^C^C_arc \_e \_d
The space between ^C^C_arc and the backslash (\) represents pressing the spacebar. The 
backslash indicates a pause to enable you to select the starting endpoint for the arc. The _e rep-
resents the selection of the Endpoint option under the Arc command after you’ve picked a point. 
A second backslash allows another point selection. Finally, the _d represents the selection of the 
Direction option. Figure 24.20 illustrates this. If you want the last character in a menu item to be 
a backslash, you must follow the backslash with a semicolon.

Arc menu item

Opening an Expanded Text Box for the Macro Option
As you become more expert at creating macros, you may find the line provided in the Macro 
option too small for your needs. Fortunately, you can open an expanded text box in which to 
write longer macros. For example, suppose that you want to include the following macro in a tool:
(defun c:breakat ()
(command "break" pause "f" pause "@")
)
breakat
This example shows the Breakat AutoLISP macro. Everything in this segment is entered just 
as it would be from the keyboard at the Command prompt. You may find it a bit cumbersome 
to try to enter this macro in the text box provided by the Macro option in the Properties group 
of the Customize User Interface dialog box, but if you click the Macro text box, a Browse button 
appears to the right (see Figure 24.21).
Figure 24.21
The Browse button in 
the Macro option
Click the Browse button to open the Long String Editor. You can then enter the macro and see 
it clearly. The following shows how it would be entered:
^C^C(defun c:breakat ()+
(command "break" pause "f" pause "@")+
);breakat
It starts with the usual ^C^C to clear any current commands. The plus sign at the end of lines 
1 and 2 tells AutoCAD that the macro continues in the next line without actually breaking it. The 
break is there to help make the macro easier to read as you enter it. It’s okay to break an AutoLISP 
macro into smaller lines. Doing so can help you read and understand the program more easily.
Loading AutoLISP Macros
As you become a more advanced AutoCAD user, you may want many of your own AutoLISP macros 
to load with your custom interface. You can make them do that by combining all your AutoLISP 
macros into a single file. Give this file the same name as your menu file but with the .mnl filename 
extension. Such a file automatically loads with its menu counterpart. For example, say that you have 
a file called Mymenu.mnl containing the Breakat AutoLISP macro. Whenever you load Mymenu.cui, 
Mymenu.mnl is automatically loaded along with it, giving you access to the Breakat macro. This is a 
good way to manage and organize any AutoLISP program code that you want to include with a menu.
To learn more about the AutoLISP language, see Bonus Chapter 2, “Exploring AutoLISP,” available 
at www.omura.com/chapters.

886  | CHAPTER 24  Customizing Toolbars, Menus, Linetypes, and Hatch Patterns   
Editing Keyboard Shortcuts
Another area of customization that can be useful is the keyboard shortcut. You probably already 
know about the standard Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V, which are shortcuts for the Windows Copy and 
Paste functions. In AutoCAD, Shift+Ctrl+A toggles groups on and off, and Ctrl+1 opens the 
Properties palette.
You can edit existing keyboard shortcuts or create new ones by opening the Keyboard 
Shortcuts list in the Customizations In All Files group of the Customize User Interface dialog 
box. If you expand this list, you see Shortcut Keys and Temporary Override Keys. These can be 
expanded to reveal their elements. Select an element to display its properties in the Properties 
group.
You can click and drag a command from the Command List group into the Shortcut Keys 
group and then edit its properties to set the shortcut keys that you want to use for the command. 
For example, if you click and drag the 3D Free Orbit command from the Command List group 
into the Shortcut Keys list and then select it from that list, you see its properties in the Properties 
group (see Figure 24.22).
Figure 24.22

Record and Play Back Actions
If AutoLISP seems a bit too intimidating but you still need a way to automate certain tasks, the 
Action Recorder is a feature that you’ll want to explore. The Action Recorder enables you to record a 
series of actions in AutoCAD and store them as action macros. You can play back your action macros 
at any time. This is a great time-saver when you are performing repetitive tasks, something that 
you may find yourself doing frequently in AutoCAD.
An entire panel is devoted to the Action Recorder in the Manage tab:

Editing Keyboard Shortcuts |  887  
To use the Action Recorder, click the Record button. The Record button changes to a Stop button, 
and a red dot appears next to the cursor to remind you that you are recording your activity. You’ll 
also see the Action Tree appear just below the recorder.
Continue working as you normally would in AutoCAD. As you work, your activity is displayed 
in the Action Tree. When you’ve completed the activity that you want to record, click the Stop 
button. The Action Macro dialog box appears, where you can give the recorded activity a name 
and description.
After you’ve closed the Action Macro dialog box, you can play back your recorded action macro at 
any time. From the Action Recorder panel, select the macro name from the Available Action Macro 
drop-down list and then click Play.
The Action Tree lets you include some interactivity in your macro. You can right-click an individual 
action in the Action Tree to modify its behavior to allow user input. Perhaps the most common 
modification that you’ll want to make is to allow different selections or to change coordinate input 
and point selections. To do this, right-click an action and select Pause For User Input.
continues

888  | CHAPTER 24  Customizing Toolbars, Menus, Linetypes, and Hatch Patterns   
Click the Key(s) option in the Properties group, and then click the Browse button that appears 
to the far right of the Keys option to open the Shortcut Keys dialog box.
Click in the Press The New Shortcut Key text box, and then press the shortcut key that you 
want to use for this command. For example, if you press Shift+Ctrl+Z, that sequence appears in 
the text box. If the shortcut that you selected is already assigned to another command, you see a 
message that says so just below the text box. Click OK when you’re done.
Saving, Loading, and Unloading Your Customizations
You may want to save the custom menus, panels, and toolbars that you create with the 
Customize User Interface dialog box so that you can carry them with you to other computers 
and load them for ready access. To save your customization work, you need to use the Transfer 
tab of the Customize User Interface dialog box. Here’s how it works:
	
1.	 Open the Customize User Interface dialog box.
	
2.	 Click the Transfer tab. This tab contains two panels: The left panel shows the 
Customizations In Main File group, and the right panel shows a similar group called 
Customizations In New File.
	
3.	 In the left panel, locate your custom component, such as a menu, a Ribbon panel, or a toolbar.
	
4.	 Click and drag it to the appropriate item in the right panel. For example, click and drag a 
custom panel from the Ribbon panel list of the left group to the Ribbon panel section in 
the right group.
	
5.	 Repeat step 4 for each custom component that you’ve created.
	
6.	 When you’ve copied everything from the left group to the right, click the drop-down list 
in the Customizations In New File title bar and select Save As.
	
7.	 In the Save As dialog box, enter a name for your customization file and select a location.
	
8.	 Click Save to complete the process. 
Upon selecting this option, you will be prompted for input when this particular action comes up 
in the macro. You can also use the Insert User Message option to have a message display while the 
macro is running. Messages can be helpful for users who are unfamiliar with your macro.

Synchronize Your Custom Settings with A360 Drive
When you use A360 Drive® and the Sync My Settings Through The Cloud option, you can always 
have your custom settings available no matter where you are. To use this option, log into A360 
Drive (see the section “Getting Started with A360 Drive” in Chapter 25, “Managing and Sharing 
Your Drawings”). Then make sure that the Sync My Settings Through The Cloud option is checked 
in the InfoCenter’s A360 drop-down menu. AutoCAD will automatically store your custom set-
tings in the A360 Drive cloud service. If you start an AutoCAD 2017 session at another location 
and log into A360 Drive, your custom settings will be synchronized with the settings stored in 
the cloud.
You can control which settings are synced by using the Online tab of the Options dialog box. Click 
the A360 drop-down list from the InfoCenter, and then select Online Options. Doing so opens the 
Online tab of the Options dialog box. Click the Choose Which Settings Are Synced button to open 
a dialog box that lets you select which settings to sync.
Your customization is saved with the .cuix filename extension. After it’s saved as a file, you 
can load it into another copy of AutoCAD by doing the following:
	
1.	 Open the Customize User Interface dialog box.
	
2.	 Click the Load Partial Customization File tool in the Customizations In All Files group 
toolbar.
	
3.	 In the Open dialog box, locate and select your CUI file and then click Open.
	
4.	 Back in the Customize User Interface dialog box, click OK.
	
5.	 If your CUI file contains menus, enter Workspace ↵↵ at the Command prompt, or select 
a workspace from the Workspace Switching tool in the status bar. If it contains toolbars, 
right-click in a blank area next to an existing docked toolbar, and then select the name of 
your CUI file and the toolbar.
As an alternative to using the Customize User Interface dialog box, you can use the CUIload 
command. Enter Cuiload↵ at the Command prompt to open the Load/Unload Customizations 
dialog box.
Click the Browse button to locate and select your CUI file. After you’ve done this, the name 
of your file appears in the File Name text box. You can then click the Load button to import it 
into your AutoCAD session.

890  | CHAPTER 24  Customizing Toolbars, Menus, Linetypes, and Hatch Patterns   
Finally, if you want to unload a CUI file, do the following:
	
1.	 Open the Customize User Interface dialog box.
	
2.	 Scroll down to the bottom of the list in the Customizations In All Files group, and expand 
the Partial Customization Files item.
	
3.	 Right-click the partial CUI file that you want to unload, and select Unload name.cuix.
	
4.	 Close the dialog box by clicking OK. 
Customizing the AutoComplete Command Entry Feature
AutoComplete provides a way to speed up your keyboard entry by offering command and system 
variable name suggestions as you type. For example, if you want to start the polygon command 
but you’re not sure of the command name, you can type poly and AutoComplete will fill in the rest 
of the name for you.
AutoComplete offers a few options in the way it presents command and system variable name sug-
gestions. To get to these options, right-click in the command-line interface and then select Input 
Settings. You will see a list of options that you can toggle on or off. These options are AutoComplete, 
AutoCorrect, Search System Variables, Search Content, Mid-string Search, and Delay Time.
The AutoComplete option lets you enable or disable the AutoComplete feature. The AutoCorrect 
option will correct for misspelled entries. Search System Variables will include system variables 
when looking for AutoComplete suggestions. Search Content will search for names of objects in 
the drawing. Mid-string Search will suggest names that start with or contain the letters you type. 
Delay Time lets you control the delay between the time you start to type and when AutoComplete 
offers a suggestion.
Besides these selections, you can also make more detailed setting modifications through the Input 
Search Options dialog box.

Understanding the DIESEL Macro Language |  891  
Understanding the DIESEL Macro Language
DIESEL is one of many macro languages that AutoCAD supports, and you can use it to perform 
simple operations and add some automation to menus. As with AutoLISP, parentheses are used 
to enclose program code.
In the following sections, you’ll look at the various ways to use the DIESEL macro language. 
You’ll start by using DIESEL directly from the command line. This section will show you how a 
DIESEL macro is formatted, and it will give you a chance to see DIESEL in action. Then you’ll go 
on to see how DIESEL can be used as part of a menu option to test the current state of AutoCAD. 
In the third section, you’ll see how DIESEL can be used as part of the menu label to control what 
is shown in the menu. Finally, you’ll learn how to use DIESEL with field objects to control text in 
your drawing.
Using DIESEL at the Command Line
You can use DIESEL at the AutoCAD command line by using a command called Modemacro. 
The Modemacro command sends information to the status bar. DIESEL can be used with 
Modemacro to perform simple tasks.
Try the following exercise to experiment with DIESEL:
	
1.	 Open a drawing, and then at the Command prompt, type Modemacro↵.
	
2.	 At the Enter new value for MODEMACRO, or . for none <" ">: prompt, enter 
$(/,25,2)↵. The answer to the equation appears at the left end of the status bar icons.
The answer to the equation appears here.
	
3.	 To clear the status bar, enter Modemacro ↵.
	
4.	 At the Enter new value for MODEMACRO, or . for none <" ">: prompt, enter . (a 
period). The status will then clear.
The equation you entered in step 2 is referred to as an expression. The structure of DIESEL 
expressions is similar to that of AutoLISP expressions. The dollar sign tells AutoCAD that the 
information that follows is a DIESEL expression.
A DIESEL expression must include an operator of some sort, followed by the items to be oper-
ated on. An operator is an instruction to take a specific action, such as adding two numbers or 
dividing one number by another. Examples of mathematical operators include the plus sign (+) 
for addition and the forward slash (/) for division.
The operator is often referred to as a function and the items to be operated on are referred 
to as the arguments to the function, or simply the arguments. In the expression (/,25,2), the /

is the function and 25 and 2 are the arguments. All DIESEL expressions, no matter what size, 
follow this structure and are enclosed by parentheses.
Parentheses are important elements of an expression. All parentheses must be balanced—
that is, for each left parenthesis, there must be a right parenthesis.
You can do other things with DIESEL besides performing calculations. The getvar function 
is an AutoLISP function that you can use to obtain the drawing prefix and name. Try the follow-
ing to see how DIESEL uses getvar:
	
1.	 Type Modemacro↵ again.
	
2.	 Type $(getvar,dwgprefix)↵. The location of the current drawing appears in the status 
bar.
	
3.	 Press ↵ to reissue the Modemacro command; then type $(getvar,dwgname)↵. The name 
of the drawing appears in the status bar.
In this example, the getvar function extracts the drawing prefix and name and displays it 
in the status bar. You can use getvar to extract any system variable that you want. If you’ve 
been working through the exercises in this book, you’ve seen that virtually all AutoCAD set-
tings are also controlled through system variables. (The Help section of the Autodesk Exchange 
window contains a list of all the system variables. See Chapter 2, “Creating Your First Drawing,” 
for more on Autodesk Exchange.) This can be a great tool when you’re creating custom menus 
because with getvar, you can poll AutoCAD to determine the state of a given system variable. 
For example, you can find out what command is currently being used. Try the following exer-
cise to see how this works:
	
1.	 Make sure that Dynamic Input is turned off, and click the Line tool on the Draw panel.
	
2.	 Type ‘Modemacro↵. The apostrophe at the beginning of Modemacro lets you use the 
command while in another command.
	
3.	 Type $(getvar,cmdnames)↵. The word LINE appears in the status bar, indicating that 
the current command is the Line command.
This information can be useful in building a menu when you want an option to perform a 
specific task depending on which command is currently active.
AutoCAD LT Users Can Use DIESEL
Users of AutoCAD LT® software can’t use AutoLISP to find the location of AutoCAD resource files. 
However, they can use the DIESEL macro language. For example, to find the log file path, enter 
Modemacro↵ and then $(getvar,logfilepath). The path is displayed in the status bar. To get 
the status bar tools back, enter Modemacro↵ and then enter a period.
Using DIESEL in a Custom Menu Macro
So far, you’ve been experimenting with DIESEL through the Modemacro command. Next, you’ll 
see how DIESEL can be used in a menu macro. A menu macro is a piece of code that changes 

Understanding the DIESEL Macro Language |  893  
a menu option depending on some condition. For example, you could have a menu option that 
says, “Turn on the grid.” But if the grid is already on, you would want the menu option to say, 
“Turn off the grid.” DIESEL could help you accomplish this. You’ll start by examining a DIESEL 
expression, and then you’ll set up a menu option that turns a feature called Blipmode on and off.
Using DIESEL in a menu macro requires a slightly different format from what you’ve seen 
so far. You still use the same DIESEL format of a dollar sign followed by the expression, but you 
don’t use the Modemacro command to access DIESEL. Instead, you use $M=. You can think of 
$M= as an abbreviation for Modemacro.
For the purpose of completing the following sections, you will need to activate a system vari-
able called Blipmode. To do this, type Redefine↵, and at the Enter command name: prompt, 
type Blipmode↵.
Here’s a DIESEL expression that you can use in a menu macro:
^C^C_Blipmode;$M=$(-,1,$(getvar,Blipmode))
This menu option turns the Blipmode display on or off depending on its current state. 
Blipmode displays point selections in the drawing area as tiny crosses. These tiny crosses, or 
blips, don’t print and can be cleared from the screen with a redraw. They can be helpful when 
you need to track your point selections.
In this example, the Blipmode command is invoked, and then the $M= tells AutoCAD that a 
DIESEL expression follows. The expression
$(-,1,$(getvar,Blipmode))
returns either 1 or a 0, which is applied to the Blipmode command to turn it either on or off. This 
expression shows that you can nest expressions. The most deeply nested expression is evaluated 
first, so AutoCAD begins by evaluating
$(getvar,Blipmode)
This returns either 1 or a 0, depending on whether Blipmode is on or off. AutoCAD then 
evaluates the next level in the expression
$(-,1,getvar_resultgetvar_result)
in which getvar_result is either 1 or a 0. If getvar_result is 1, the expression looks like
$(-,1,1)
which returns 0. If getvar_result is 0, the expression looks like
$(-,1,0)
which returns 1. In either case, the end result is that the Blipmode command is assigned a value 
that is the opposite of the current Blipmode setting.
Using DIESEL as a Menu Bar Option Label
In the previous example, you saw how to use DIESEL in a menu macro to read the sta-
tus of a command and then return a numeric value to alter that status. You can also use 
DIESEL as part of the menu bar option name so that the text it displays depends on certain 
conditions.

894  | CHAPTER 24  Customizing Toolbars, Menus, Linetypes, and Hatch Patterns   
The following expression shows how to write a menu option name to display the current set-
ting for Blipmode. It includes DIESEL code as the menu option label:
$(eval,Blipmode = $(getvar,blipmode))
Normally, you would just have a menu name, but here you see some DIESEL instructions. 
These instructions tell AutoCAD to display the message Blipmode = 1 or Blipmode = 0 in the 
menu, depending on the current Blipmode setting. You would place this code in the Properties 
group for the Blipmode custom command in the Customize User Interface dialog box. It goes in 
the Display/Name text box.
Here’s how it works. You see the familiar $(getvar,blipmode) expression, this time embed-
ded in a different expression. You know that $(getvar,blipmode) returns either 1 or a 0, 
depending on whether Blipmode is on or off. The outer expression
$(eval,Blipmode = getvar_result)
displays Blipmode = and then combines this with getvar_result, which, as you’ve learned, will 
be either 1 or 0. The eval function evaluates any text that follows it and returns its contents. The 
end result is the appearance of Blipmode = 1 or Blipmode = 0 in the menu. Here’s how the prop-
erties look as a menu bar option under the Tools list of the Menus option in the Customizations 
In All Files panel:
You can get even fancier and set up the menu option label to read Blipmode On or Blipmode 
Off by using the if DIESEL function. Here’s that same menu listing with additional DIESEL 
code to accomplish this:
$(eval,Blipmode = $(if,$(getvar,blipmode),Off,On))
Where Is the Menu Bar?
The menu bar is turned off by default, but you can turn it on by selecting Show Menu Bar from the 
Customize Quick Access Toolbar tool. See Chapter 1, “Exploring the Interface,” for more on this tool.

Understanding the DIESEL Macro Language |  895  
In this example, the simple $(getvar,blipmode) expression is expanded to include the if 
function. The if function reads the result of $(getvar,blipmode) and then returns the Off or 
On value depending on whether $(getvar,blipmode) returns 0 or 1. Here’s a simpler look at 
the expression:
$(if, getvar_result, Off, On)
If getvar_result returns 1, the if function returns the first of the two options listed after 
getvar_result, which is Off. If getvar_result returns 0, the if function returns On. The 
second of the two options is optional. Here’s how the fancier Blipmode option appears in a 
menu:
We’ve just skimmed the surface of what DIESEL can do. To get a more detailed description 
of how DIESEL works, press the F1 function key to open the Autodesk Help Homepage. Enter 
DIESEL↵ in the search box at the top of the left column of the Help Homepage, and then select 
the Customization Guide entry that appears below the search box. Scroll down the right side 
panel to locate the DIESEL heading.

Using DIESEL and Fields to Generate Text
Using DIESEL expressions in the status bar or in a menu can be helpful to gather information or 
to create a more interactive interface, but what if you want the results of a DIESEL expression to 
become part of the drawing? You can employ field objects to do just that.
For example, suppose that you want to create a note that shows the scale of a drawing based 
on the dimension scale. Further, you want the scale in the note to be updated automatically 
whenever the dimension scale changes. You can add a field object and associate it with a DIESEL 
expression that displays the dimension scale as it relates to the drawing scale. Try the following 
steps to see how it’s done:
	
1.	 In the Annotate tab, click the Multiline Text tool and select two points to indicate the text 
location. The Text Editor Ribbon tab and text editor appear.
	
2.	 Right-click in the text editor, and select Insert Field to open the Field dialog box.
	
3.	 In the Field Category drop-down list, select Other; then, in the Field Names list box, select 
DIESELExpression.
	
4.	 Add the following text in the DIESEL Expression box to the right. If you need to expand 
the width of the dialog box, click and drag its right edge:
$(eval,Dimension Scale: 1/)$(/,$(getvar, dimscale),12)
$(eval, inch = 1 foot)
Table 24.2:	
Sample of DIESEL functions   (continued)

Creating Custom Linetypes |  897  
	
5.	 Click OK in the Field dialog box, and then click Close Text Editor in the Text Editor 
Ribbon tab. The following text is displayed in the drawing:
Dimension Scale: 1/0.08333333 inch = 1 foot
Zoom into the text if needed. The resulting text may not make sense until you change the 
dimension scale to a value that represents a scale other than 1-to-1. Here’s how to do that:
	
1.	 Enter Dimscale↵ at the Command prompt.
	
2.	 At the Enter new value for DIMSCALE <1.0000>: prompt, enter 96↵. This is the value 
for a 1⁄8″ scale drawing.
	
3.	 Type RE↵. The text changes to read
Dimension Scale: 1/8 inch = 1 foot
In this example, several DIESEL operations were used. The beginning of the expression uses 
the eval operation to tell AutoCAD to display a string of text:
$(eval Dimension Scale: 1/)
The next part tells AutoCAD to get the current value of the Dimscale system variable and 
divide it by 12:
$(/,$(getvar, dimscale),12)
Notice that this is a nested expression: $(getvar,dimscale) obtains the value of the 
Dimscale system variable, which is then divided by 12. The end of the expression adds the final 
part to the text:
$(eval, inch = 1 foot)
When it’s all put together, you get the text that shows the dimension scale as an architectural 
scale. Because it’s an AutoCAD text object, this text is part of the drawing.
Creating Custom Linetypes
As your drawing needs expand, the standard linetypes may not be adequate for your 
application. Fortunately, you can create your own. The following sections explain how to 
do so.
You’ll get an in-depth view of the process of creating linetypes. You’ll also learn how to 
create complex linetypes that can’t be created by using the Make Linetype Express tool.
Viewing Available Linetypes
Although AutoCAD provides the linetypes most commonly used in drafting (see Figure 24.23), 
the dashes and dots may not be spaced the way you would like, or you may want an entirely 
new linetype.

898  | CHAPTER 24  Customizing Toolbars, Menus, Linetypes, and Hatch Patterns   
To create a custom linetype, use the -Linetype command. Let’s see how this handy command 
works by first listing the available linetypes:
	
1.	 Open a new AutoCAD file.
	
2.	 At the Command prompt, enter -Linetype↵. (Don’t forget the hyphen at the beginning.)
	
3.	 At the Enter an option [?/Create/Load/Set]: prompt, enter ?↵.
	
4.	 In the dialog box, locate and double-click acad.lin in the listing of available linetype 
files. You get a list that shows the linetypes available in the acad.lin file along with a 
simple description of each line. You will also notice an identical LIN file in this folder for 
the metric version of the linetypes if you use the metric system.
	
5.	 A message at the bottom says Press ENTER to continue:. Do so until you see the 
Command prompt. If the file was opened in a separate floating command window, 
close it.
Figure 24.23
The lines in this partial 
list of standard line-
types were generated 
with the underscore 
key (_), the period (.),  
and other symbols and 
are only rough repre-
sentations of the  
actual lines.
Where Are the Linetypes Stored?
AutoCAD stores the linetypes in a file called acad.lin, which is in ASCII format. When you cre-
ate a new linetype, you add information to this file. Or, if you create a new file containing your 
own linetype definitions, it too will have the extension .lin at the end of its name. You can edit 
linetypes as described here, or you can edit them directly in these files.

Creating Custom Linetypes |  899  
Creating a New Linetype
Next, let’s try creating a new linetype:
	
1.	 Enter -Linetype↵ again.
	
2.	 At the [?/Create/Load/Set]: prompt, enter C↵.
	
3.	 At the Enter name of linetype to create: prompt, enter Custom↵ as the name of 
your new linetype.
	
4.	 The dialog box that you see next is named Create Or Append Linetype File. You need 
to enter the name of the linetype file that you want to create or add to. If you select the 
default linetype file, acad, your new linetype is added to the acad.lin (acadios.lin for 
metric users) file. If you choose to create a new linetype file, AutoCAD opens a file con-
taining the linetype that you create and adds .lin to the filename that you supply.
	
5.	 Let’s assume that you want to start a new linetype file. Clear any text in the File Name 
text box, and then enter Newline↵.
New or Existing Linetype File
If you accept the default linetype file, acad, the prompt in step 4 is Wait, checking if line-
type already defined. This protects you from inadvertently overwriting an existing linetype 
that you want to keep.
	
6.	 At the Descriptive text: prompt, enter a text description of your linetype. You can 
use any keyboard character as part of your description, but the actual linetype can be 
composed of only a series of lines, points, and blank spaces. For this exercise, enter the 
following, using the underscore key (_) to simulate, as closely as possible, the appearance 
of your line:
Custom – My own center line 
 _ 
	
7.	 Press ↵ when complete, and at the Enter linetype pattern (on next line): prompt, 
enter the following numbers, known as the linetype code (after the A, which appears 
automatically):
A,1.0,-.125,.25,-.125
You Can Set the Default Linetype
If you use the Set option of the -Linetype command to set a new default linetype, you’ll get that 
linetype no matter what layer you’re on.
	
8.	 Press ↵ again, and at the New linetype definition saved to file. Enter an 
option [?/Create/Load/Set]: prompt, press ↵ to exit the -Linetype command.

900  | CHAPTER 24  Customizing Toolbars, Menus, Linetypes, and Hatch Patterns   
Remember, after you’ve created a linetype, you must load it in order to use it, as discussed in 
Chapter 5, “Keeping Track of Layers and Blocks.”
Add Linetypes Directly to the acad.lin File
You can also open the acad.lin or other LIN file in Windows Notepad and add the descriptive 
text and linetype code directly to the end of the file.
Understanding the Linetype Code
In step 7 of the previous exercise, you entered a series of numbers separated by commas. This 
is the linetype code, representing the lengths of the components that make up the linetype. The 
separate elements of the linetype code are as follows:
◆
◆
The 1.0 following the A is the length of the first part of the line. (The A that begins the line-
type definition is a code that is applied to all linetypes.)
◆
◆
The first -.125 is the blank or broken part of the line. The minus sign tells AutoCAD that 
the line is not to be drawn for the specified length, which is 0.125 units in this example.
◆
◆
Next comes the positive value 0.25. This tells AutoCAD to draw a line segment 0.25 units 
long after the blank part of the line.
◆
◆
The last negative value, -.125, again tells AutoCAD to skip drawing the line for the distance 
of 0.125 units.
This series of numbers represents the one segment that is repeated to form the line (see 
Figure 24.24). You can also create a complex linetype that looks like a random broken line, as 
shown in Figure 24.25.

Random broken line
You may be wondering what purpose the A serves at the beginning of the linetype code. 
A linetype is composed of a series of line segments and points. The A, which is supplied by 
AutoCAD automatically, is a code that forces the linetype to start and end on a line segment 
rather than on a blank space in the series of lines. At times, AutoCAD stretches the last line seg-
ment to force this condition, as shown in Figure 24.26.

Creating Custom Linetypes |  901  
As mentioned earlier, you can also create linetypes outside AutoCAD by using a word 
processor or text editor such as Windows Notepad. The standard acad.lin file looks like 
Figure 24.23 with the addition of the code used by AutoCAD to determine the line segment 
lengths.
Normally, to use a linetype that you’ve created, you have to load it through either the 
Layer Properties Manager or the Linetype Manager dialog box (choose Other from the 
Linetype drop-down list in the Home tab’s Properties panel). If you use one of your own 
linetypes frequently, you may want to create a button macro so that it will be available as an 
option on a menu.
Creating Complex Linetypes
A complex linetype is one that incorporates text or special graphics. For example, if you want to 
show an underground gas line in a site plan, you normally show a line with the intermittent 
word GAS, as in Figure 24.27. Fences are often shown with an intermittent circle, square, or X.
Line Segment Lengths and Scale
The values that you enter for the line segment lengths are multiplied by the Ltscale factor, so be 
sure to enter values for the plotted lengths.

and the end of the

For the graphics needed to compose complex linetypes, use any of the symbols in the 
AutoCAD font files discussed in Chapter 9, “Adding Text to Drawings.” Create a text style by 
using these symbol fonts, and then specify the appropriate symbol by using its corresponding 
letter in the linetype description.

902  | CHAPTER 24  Customizing Toolbars, Menus, Linetypes, and Hatch Patterns   
To create a linetype that includes text, use the same linetype code described earlier but add 
the necessary font file information in brackets. For example, say that you want to create the 
linetype for the underground gas line mentioned previously by using just the letter G. You add 
the following to your acad.lin file:
*Gas_line, -G-G-G-
A,1.0,-0.25,["G",STANDARD,S=.2,R=0,X=-.1,Y=-.1],-0.25
The first line serves as a description for anyone looking at this linetype code. The next line is 
the code itself. Note that the code should not contain spaces.
The information in the square brackets describes the characteristics of the text. The actual 
text that you want to appear in the line is surrounded by quotation marks. Next are the text 
style, scale, rotation angle, X displacement, and Y displacement.
Edit the acad.lin File to Create Complex Linetypes
You can’t use the -Linetype command to define complex linetypes. Instead, you must open the 
acad.lin file by using a text editor, such as Notepad, and add the linetype information to the end 
of the file. Be sure that you don’t duplicate the name of an existing linetype.
You can substitute A for the rotation angle (the R value), as in the following example:
A,1.0,-0.25,["G",standard,S=.2,A=0,X=-.1,Y=-.1],-0.25
This has the effect of keeping the text at the same angle regardless of the line’s direction. 
Notice that in this sample, the X and Y values are -.1; this will center the Gs on the line. The 
scale value of .2 will cause the text to be 0.2 units high, so .1 is half the height.
In addition to fonts, you can specify shapes for linetype definitions. Instead of letters, shapes 
display symbols. Shapes are stored not as drawings but as definition files, similar to text font 
files. Shape files have the same .shx filename extension as font files and are also defined simi-
larly. Figure 24.28 shows some symbols from sample shape files. The names of the files are 
shown at the top of each column.
To use a shape in a linetype code, you use the same format as shown previously for text. 
However, instead of using a letter and style name, you use the shape name and the shape file-
name as in the following example:
*Capline, ====
a,1.0,-0.25,[CAP,ES.SHX,S=.5,R=0,X=-.1,Y=-.1],-0.25
This example uses the CAP symbol from the Es.shx shape file. The symbol is scaled to 0.5 
units with 0 rotation and an X and Y displacement of –0.1.
Here is another example, this one using the arrow shape:
*Arrowline, -|-|-|-
a,1.0,-0.25,[ARROW,ES.SHX,S=.5,R=90,X=-.1,Y=-.1],-0.25
Just as with the Capline example, the ARROW symbol in this example is scaled to 0.5 units 
with 0 rotation and an X and Y displacement of –0.1. Figure 24.29 shows what the Arrowline 
linetype looks like when used with a spline.

used with a spline
In this example, the Ltype generation option is turned on for the polyline. Note that the 
arrow from the Es.shx sample shape file is used for the arrow in this linetype.
Creating Hatch Patterns
AutoCAD provides several predefined hatch patterns from which you can choose, but you can 
also create your own. This section demonstrates the basic elements of pattern definition.
Unlike linetypes, hatch patterns can’t be created while you’re in an AutoCAD file. The pat-
tern definitions are contained in an external file named acad.pat. You can open and edit this 
file with a text editor that can handle ASCII files, such as Notepad. Here is one hatch pattern 
definition from that file:
*SQUARE,Small aligned squares
0, 0,0, 0,.125, .125,-.125
90, 0,0, 0,.125, .125,-.125
You can see some similarities between pattern descriptions and linetype descriptions. They 
both start with a line of descriptive text and then give numeric values defining the pattern. 
However, the numbers in pattern descriptions have a different meaning. This example shows 

904  | CHAPTER 24  Customizing Toolbars, Menus, Linetypes, and Hatch Patterns   
two lines of information. Each line represents a line in the pattern. The first line determines the 
horizontal line component of the pattern, and the second line represents the vertical component 
(see the image to the far right in Figure 24.30). A pattern is made up of line groups. A line group 
is like a linetype that is arrayed a specified distance to fill the area to be hatched. A line group is 
defined by a line of code, much as a linetype is defined. In the square pattern, for instance, two 
lines—one horizontal and one vertical—are used. Each of these lines is duplicated in a fashion 
that makes the lines appear as boxes when they’re combined. Figure 24.30 illustrates this point.
Figure 24.30
The individual and 
combined line groups

Look at the first line in the definition:
0, 0,0, 0,.125, .125,-.125
This example shows a series of numbers separated by commas. It represents one line group. 
It contains four sets of information separated by blank spaces:
◆
◆
The first component is the 0 at the beginning. This value indicates the angle of the line 
group, as determined by the line’s orientation. In this case, it’s 0 for a horizontal line that 
runs from left to right.
◆
◆
The next component is the origin of the line group, 0,0. This is the hatch pattern origin, not 
the drawing origin. (See “Positioning Hatch Patterns Accurately” in Chapter 7, “Mastering 
Viewing Tools, Hatches, and External References,” for more on the hatch pattern origin.) It 
gives you a reference point to determine the location of other line groups involved in gen-
erating the pattern.
◆
◆
The next component is 0,.125. This determines the distance and direction for arraying 
the line, as illustrated in Figure 24.31. This value is like a relative coordinate indicating X 
and Y distances for a rectangular array. It isn’t based on the drawing coordinates, but on a 
coordinate system relative to the orientation of the line. For a line oriented at a 0° angle,  
the code 0,.125 indicates a precisely vertical direction. For a line oriented at a 45° angle, the 
code 0,.125 represents a 135° direction. Remember that the very first number in the line 
definition determines the angle of the line. In this example, the duplication occurs 90° in 
relation to the line group, because the X value is 0. Figure 24.32 illustrates this point.

the orientation of the line group.
◆
◆
The last component is the description of the line pattern. This value is equivalent to the 
value given when you create a linetype. Positive values are line segments, and negative 
values are blank segments. This part of the line group definition works exactly as in the 
linetype definitions that you studied in the previous section.
This system of defining hatch patterns may seem somewhat limiting, but you can do a lot 
with it. Autodesk managed to come up with 69 patterns—and that was only scratching the 
surface.

906  | CHAPTER 24  Customizing Toolbars, Menus, Linetypes, and Hatch Patterns   
The Bottom Line
Use workspaces.    Often with AutoCAD, you find that you have different sets of panels or 
toolbars open to perform specific tasks. You might have one set of Ribbon panels for editing 
text and dimensions, whereas another set is more useful for design. Using workspaces is a 
great way to organize your different editing modes.
Master It    Where do you find the Customize option for workspaces?
Customize the user interface.    In addition to using workspaces to organize tools and 
Ribbon panels, you can customize the AutoCAD interface to make it fit the way you like to 
work. You can add tools to Ribbon panels, or you can even create your own tools for opera-
tions you perform frequently.
Master It    What does the Customizations In All Files group display?
Create macros in tools and menus.    A macro is a set of instructions that performs more 
complex operations than single commands. Macros are often built on commands with addi-
tional predefined responses to help speed data input.
Master It    What does the ^C do in a macro?
Edit keyboard shortcuts.    Keyboard shortcuts can help improve your speed when drawing 
in AutoCAD. They can reduce several clicks of the mouse to a simple keystroke. AutoCAD 
lets you create custom shortcuts for your favorite commands.
Master It    What is the name of the feature that lets you record and playback actions?
Save, load, and unload your customizations.    To keep your customizations organized, you 
can save new toolbars, menus, and Ribbons as files that you can load on demand. When you 
save your custom elements as a file, you can move them to other computers. In addition, you 
can use the cloud to synchronize your custom settings with other computers.
Master It    Name the feature that lets you synchronize your custom settings from a cloud source.
Understand the DIESEL macro language.    If you’re adventurous, you may want to try your 
hand at creating more complex macros. The DIESEL macro language is an easy introduction to 
AutoCAD macro customization, and it is most useful in controlling the behavior in menu options.
Master It    What does the expression $(getvar, Blipmode) do?
Create custom linetypes.    AutoCAD offers a number of noncontinuous linetypes, and you may 
find them adequate for most of your work. But every now and then, you may need a specific line-
type that isn’t available. Creating custom linetypes is easy when you understand the process.
Master It    What is the purpose of a negative value in the linetype code?
Create hatch patterns.    Like linetypes, the hatch patterns provided by AutoCAD will probably 
fill most of your needs. But every now and then you may need to produce a specific pattern.
Master It    How are a hatch pattern code and a linetype code similar?
Adding Thick Lines to Hatch Pattern Linetypes
If you want to include thick lines in your hatch patterns, you have to build up line widths with 
multiple linetype definitions.

Managing and Sharing Your 
Drawings 
Whether you’re a one-person operation working out of your home or one of several hundred 
Autodesk® AutoCAD® software users in a large company, file sharing and file maintenance can 
become the focus of much of your time. In our interconnected world, the volume of messages 
and files crossing our paths seems to be increasing exponentially. In addition, the Internet has 
enabled us to be more mobile, adding yet more complexity to file management and data sharing 
tasks.
In this chapter, you’ll learn about some of the tools AutoCAD offers to help you manage your 
files and the files you share with others. You’ll also examine some general issues that arise while 
using AutoCAD in a workgroup environment. You may find help with problems you’ve encoun-
tered when using AutoCAD.
In this chapter, you will learn to

Sharing Drawings Online
Through AutoCAD, you can use tools to post drawings on the Internet that others can view 
and download. In the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry in particular, 
this can mean easier access to documents needed by contractors, engineers, cost estimators, and 
others involved in the design, bidding, and construction of building projects. Suppliers of prod-
ucts can post symbol libraries of their products or even 3D solid models.
In the following sections, you’ll learn about the tools that AutoCAD provides for publishing 
and accessing drawings over the Internet (and on any local or wide area network). You’ll start by 
looking at one of the most common uses of the Internet: file transmission.

908  | CHAPTER 25  Managing and Sharing Your Drawings   
Sharing Project Files with eTransmit
Whether you’re a one-person office or a member of a 50-person firm, you’ll eventually have to 
share your work with others outside your building. Before eTransmit existed as a feature in 
AutoCAD, you had to examine carefully what you were sending to make sure that you included 
all of the ancillary files needed to view or work on your drawings. Xref, font, and custom line-
type files all had to be included with the drawings that you sent to consultants or partners in a 
project, and often one of these items was omitted from the transmission.
By using eTransmit, you can quickly collect all your project drawings into a single archive 
file, or you can store the files in a separate folder for later processing. This collection of files is 
included with a report file as a transmittal. Try the following to see how eTransmit works:
	
1.	 In AutoCAD, open 15-xref1.dwg from the Chapter 15 sample files and then choose 
Publish ➢ eTransmit from the Application menu to open the Create Transmittal dialog 
box (see Figure 25.1). If you’ve edited the file before choosing eTransmit, you will see a 
message telling you that you must save the drawing before continuing.
Figure 25.1
Creating a transmittal
	
2.	 In the dialog box, a tree structure lists the files that are included in the transmittal. If 
you need to add more files to the transmittal than are shown in the list, you can click the 
Add File button to open the Add File To Transmittal dialog box. To remove files, expand 
the listed item and remove the check mark that appears next to the file that you want to 
exclude. You can also use the Files Table tab to view the files as a simple list.
	
3.	 Click in the Enter Notes To Include With This Transmittal Package box, and enter a 
description or other note.

Sharing Drawings Online |  909  
	
4.	 In the Select A Transmittal Setup group, click the Transmittal Setups button to open the 
Transmittal Setups dialog box (see Figure 25.2). Here you can create a new transmittal or 
rename or modify an existing one.
Figure 25.2
Choose whether to 
create from scratch 
or edit an existing 
transmittal.
Figure 25.3
Set your transmittal 
options.
	
5.	 Click the Modify button to open the Modify Transmittal Setup dialog box (see Figure 25.3).
	
6.	 In the Transmittal Package Type drop-down list, select the format for your collection of 
files. You can create a Zip archive or you can save the files in a folder.

910  | CHAPTER 25  Managing and Sharing Your Drawings   
You can tell AutoCAD where to place the files by using the Browse button to the right of 
the Transmittal File Folder drop-down list. For this exercise, choose the Folder option 
in the Transmittal Package Type list.
	
7.	 Click the Browse button next to the Transmittal File Folder drop-down list to open the 
Specify Location Folder dialog box. This is a typical AutoCAD file open dialog box that 
you can use to select a location for your files.
You can use the Create New Folder tool to create a new folder for your files. You’ll want 
to keep your transmittal files separate from other files. After you select a location, click 
Open to return to the Modify Transmittal Setup dialog box.
	
8.	 After you’ve set up your transmittal, click OK. Then click Close in the Transmittal Setups 
dialog box.
	
9.	 Preview the report file by clicking the View Report button in the Create Transmittal 
dialog box. This report gives you a detailed description of the types of files included in 
the transmittal. It also alerts you to files that AutoCAD was unable to find but that are 
required for the drawing.
	
10.	 Close the report. After you’ve set up the eTransmit options, click OK in the Create 
Transmittal dialog box.
	
11.	 If you selected the Zip option in step 6, you see the Specify Zip File dialog box. You 
can then send the files over the Internet or put them on a removable disk for manual 
transport.
You probably noticed that you can create additional transmittal setup options in the 
Transmittal Setups dialog box. That way, you can have multiple transmittal options on hand 
that you don’t have to set up each time a different situation arises. For example, you might have 
the Standard setup configured to create a Zip file and another setup configured to copy the files 
into a folder. A third setup might be created with a password.
Several options are available for configuring the transmittal setup. Table 25.1 gives a run-
down of those options.

Transmittal Setup Description
Lets you add a description to the transmittal file.
eTransmit gives you a quick way to package a set of files to be sent to others working on the 
same project. However, you may need to offer a wider distribution of your files. You may want 
to let others view and plot your drawings from a website without exposing your drawing data-
base to anyone who might visit your site. If you need this approach, you’ll want to know about 
the AutoCAD DWF file format, which lets anyone view AutoCAD files whether or not they 
own the program. You’ll learn more about the DWF file format in the section “Publishing Your 
Drawings” later in this chapter.

912  | CHAPTER 25  Managing and Sharing Your Drawings   
Protecting AutoCAD Drawing Files
Because AutoCAD drawings specify the methods and materials used to produce an object 
or a building, they are frequently treated like legal documents. After an AutoCAD drawing 
is issued, it’s often archived and guarded as a legal record of a design. For this reason, many 
AutoCAD users are concerned about possible tampering with drawings that are sent to third 
parties. Even minor unauthorized changes to a drawing can have major repercussions on the 
integrity of a design.
AutoCAD offers a digital signature feature that helps protect both the author of a drawing 
and the recipient in the event of file tampering. In addition, there are methods outside AutoCAD 
that you can use to protect your drawings.
AutoCAD and Mobile Devices
If you’ve been hoping to work with AutoCAD files on mobile devices, such as smartphones or tablets 
using the Apple iOS and Android operating systems, you’re in luck. Autodesk® A360 Drive (formerly 
known as Autodesk 360 Sync) lets you view and perform basic editing on AutoCAD files that have 
been uploaded to the A360 Drive website. In addition, any PC can be used to view and edit drawings 
on the A360 Drive website, whether or not you have AutoCAD installed.
The site is account based, but it’s free, and even if you’re not using a mobile device, you might 
consider using the A360 Drive website to share files with others. If you have AutoCAD installed 
on your PC, an AutoCAD plug-in lets you seamlessly open, edit, and upload drawings to your 
AutoCAD® 360 account. If you’re on a PC that doesn’t have AutoCAD, you can upload, download, 
and edit a drawing using the basic editor that runs in your browser. To start an account, just go to 
https://360.autodesk.com or www.autocad360.com and sign up.
Legacy Password Protection in AutoCAD
Earlier versions of AutoCAD offered a password protection scheme that allowed you to add a pass-
word to your DWG files. Once a password is added, you are asked to enter a password when you 
attempt to open the file. After you give the password and open a password-protected file, you can 
open and close the file repeatedly during that AutoCAD session without having to reenter the 
password. If you close and reopen AutoCAD, however, the program will prompt you for a password 
the next time you attempt to open the password-protected file. This feature is no longer offered.
Using a Digital Signature
You can use a digital signature to authenticate files. A digital signature can’t prevent someone 
from tampering with a file, but it offers a way to validate whether a file has been modified after 
it has been saved. This protects you in the event that your file is unofficially altered. It also pro-
tects the recipient of your file by verifying the file’s authenticity and by verifying that it was not 
altered from the time it left your computer.
The first time you attempt to use the digital signature feature, you see a message telling you 
that you need a digital ID. AutoCAD uses a digital ID issued by any certificate authority, such 

Sharing Drawings Online |  913  
as VeriSign, a company that specializes in Internet security. The VeriSign digital ID service is 
fee based, with prices ranging from about $90 for a basic one-year enrollment to nearly $700 for 
a professional-level ID. A free 60-day trial is also offered. The following steps show you how to 
acquire a digital ID:
	
1.	 From the Windows Taskbar, choose Start ➢ (All) Programs ➢ Autodesk ➢ AutoCAD 2017 ➢ 
Attach Digital Signatures. Or, from AutoCAD, enter Digitalsign↵ to open the digital sig-
nature dialog box. The Digital Signatures – Digital ID Not Available warning dialog box 
appears before the dialog box when using the Digitalsign command.
	
2.	 Click the Obtain ID button. Your web browser opens at the Symantec VeriSign page.
	
3.	 Select the security services you want, and follow the rest of the instructions.
After you’ve obtained a digital ID, the signature resides in the Registry on your computer. 
You can then access the digital ID from AutoCAD by using the Digital Signature tab of the 
Security Options dialog box. Here are the steps:
	
1.	 Open the drawing to which you want to attach the digital signature, and then open 
the Digital Signatures dialog box by entering Digitalsign↵ at the Command prompt. The 
Digital Signatures dialog box appears (see Figure 25.4).
Figure 25.4
Attach a signature.
	
2.	 Select the Attach Digital Signature After Saving Drawing option. The Signature 
Information options become available. You can add a date stamp and a brief description.
	
3.	 Click OK to exit the dialog box.
The next time you save the file, depending on the level of security you chose during the 
digital ID setup, you may be prompted for a password. After you enter the password, the file is 
saved.
The next time the file is opened, you’ll see the Digital Signature Contents dialog box (see 
Figure 25.5), which verifies that no one has tampered with the drawing.

914  | CHAPTER 25  Managing and Sharing Your Drawings   
You’ll also see a stamp icon in the lower-right corner of the AutoCAD window. You can click 
this icon at any time to view the file’s digital signature status. You can also issue the SigValidate 
command to view the status.
A file containing a digital signature displays a warning when the user attempts to save the 
file after making modifications (see Figure 25.6). If the user continues to save the file, the signa-
ture is detached and no longer displays the Digital Signature Contents dialog box when opened.
If you need to update a drawing that contains your digital signature, you can do so and then 
use the Security Options dialog box to reissue the digital signature.
Figure 25.5
The signature is verified 
when the file opens.
Figure 25.6

status
Adding Your Digital Signature to Multiple Files
If you have multiple files to which you’d like to attach your digital signature, you should use the 
Attach Digital Signatures utility. This program runs outside AutoCAD, and it provides a conve-
nient way to attach your digital signature to a set of drawings. Here’s how it works:
	
1.	 From the Windows Taskbar, choose Start ➢ All Programs ➢ Autodesk ➢ AutoCAD 2017 ➢ 
Attach Digital Signatures to open the Attach Digital Signatures dialog box (see Figure 25.7).

Sharing Drawings Online |  915  
	
2.	 Click the Add Files button to locate and select files. You can also search for files in a par-
ticular folder by clicking the Search Folders button. The files you add appear in the Files 
To Be Signed list box.
	
3.	 If you decide to remove a file from the list box, highlight it and then click Remove. You 
can also remove all the files from the list by clicking Clear List.
Figure 25.7
Signing multiple files
A Digital ID Is Required
If you haven’t obtained a digital ID, you see a message telling you that no valid digital ID is available 
on your system. To proceed, you’ll have to obtain a digital ID from a certificate authority such as 
VeriSign, as described earlier in “Using a Digital Signature.”
	
4.	 You can enter the date and time and a comment for the files that you’ve selected in the 
Signature information panel of the dialog box.
	
5.	 Click Sign Files when you’re sure that you’ve selected the correct files and entered an 
appropriate comment.
If you exchange AutoCAD drawings regularly with clients and consultants, you’ll want 
to obtain a digital ID and use the digital signature feature. Be aware, however, that because 

916  | CHAPTER 25  Managing and Sharing Your Drawings   
this feature was new in AutoCAD 2004, it works only if you exchange files with others using 
AutoCAD 2004 or later. In fact, a quick way to remove a digital signature from a file is to save 
the file in the AutoCAD 2000 or Release 14 file format.
Using Other Security Options
Digital signatures allow you to detect whether a file has been tampered with, but they don’t lock 
out unauthorized users. Many third-party options are available to help you protect your sensi-
tive files from unauthorized users. For example, you can save your drawing as a PDF and add a 
password to the PDF. Such a password will prevent others from opening the file, and since it is 
a PDF, it is not easily edited. Zip files can also be password protected. When placed on a server, 
make sure that proper network permissions are in place to access drawing files. Finally, you can 
use password-protected cloud services, such as A360, to share files with trusted users.
Digital IDs and PDFs
In today’s offices, PDFs are often being used for submittals, which are common documents used 
during the construction phase of a project. In the past, an architect stamped paper submittals to 
validate their review. PDF submittals can be “stamped” using digital IDs that are unique to the 
individual who is reviewing the submittal. If you’ve obtained a digital ID from VeriSign and you have 
the full version of Adobe Acrobat, you can use the Acrobat Advanced Security and stamp features 
to apply an ID to any PDF document. Acrobat will also generate its own digital ID. Unfortunately, 
the “self-signed” ID from Acrobat cannot be used with AutoCAD.
Publishing Your Drawings
The features discussed so far are intended mostly for exchanging files with others who need 
to work directly with your AutoCAD files. However, there are always associates and clients 
who only need to see your final drawings and don’t care whether they get AutoCAD files. 
Alternatively, you might be working with people who don’t have AutoCAD but still need to 
view and print your drawings. For those non-AutoCAD end users, AutoCAD offers a way to 
produce a set of drawings in the PDF format.
Exchanging Drawing Sets
Imagine that you’re working on a skylight addition to a house and you need to send your draw-
ings to your client for review. In addition to the skylight plans, you want to include some alter-
nate floor plans that your client has asked you to generate. In this exercise, you’ll put together 
a set of drawings that will become a single PDF file that you’ll send as an email attachment to 
your client:
	
1.	 Open the Sample house.dwg file, which can be found in the Chapter 25 folder of the 
sample files. The file has several layout views, each representing a separate drawing sheet.
	
2.	 Click the Save tool in the Quick Access toolbar. If you don’t do this, the Publish tool that 
you’ll use later will ask you to do it.

Publishing Your Drawings |  917  
	
3.	 Choose Publish from the Application menu to open the Publish dialog box (see Fig­ure 25.8). 
You can also type Publish↵. The dialog box lists all the layouts in its main list box, including 
the Model layout, which is equivalent to the Model Space tab. (See Chapter 8, “Introducing 
Printing, Plotting, and Layouts,” for more on layouts.)
Figure 25.8
Choosing the layouts  
to publish
	
4.	 In the list box, Ctrl+click Sample House-Model, Sample House-Foundation Details, and 
Sample House-Skylite Details to select them. You don’t want to include these layouts in 
your PDF file.
	
5.	 Right-click any of the selected files and choose Remove, or click the Remove Sheets but-
ton just above the list of sheets. The items that you have selected are removed from the 
list.
At this point, you could go ahead and create a PDF file. However, suppose that you want 
to include layouts from a file that isn’t currently open? The following steps show you how to 
accomplish this:
	
1.	 Right-click and choose Add Sheets, or click the Add Sheets button to open the Select 
Drawings dialog box.
	
2.	 Locate and select the sample house alt.dwg file, which can be found in the Chapter 25 
folder of the sample files. You see two new items, Sample House Alt-Model and Sample 
House Alt-Alternate Plan, in the list box. These are the layout and model views contained 
in the sample house alt.dwg file. 

918  | CHAPTER 25  Managing and Sharing Your Drawings   
All of the sheets that your client needs appear in the list box. You’re ready to create the PDF file:
	
1.	 Save the current list in case you want to reproduce it later. Click the Save Sheet List but-
ton. The Save List As dialog box, which is a standard file dialog box, appears.
	
2.	 Select a location and name for the sheet list and click Save.
	
3.	 Back in the Publish dialog box, in the Publish To drop-down list near the top of the dia-
log box, make sure that the PDF option is selected. Notice that you can also select Plotter 
Named In Page Setup, DWF, and DWFx.
	
4.	 Turn off the Publish In Background option. By turning off this feature, you’ll get your 
results faster.
	
5.	 Click the Publish button. The Specify PDF File dialog box appears. This is a standard file 
dialog box in which you can find a location for your PDF file and also name it. Select a 
name and location for the PDF file. By default, AutoCAD uses the same name as the cur-
rent file and the folder location of the current file. You can also set up a default location in 
the Publish Setup dialog box.
	
6.	 When AutoCAD is finished publishing your drawings, you may see a message stating 
that you do not have a PDF viewing application installed. You can view the PDF file using 
the free Acrobat Reader from the Adobe website.
	
7.	 Go back to AutoCAD, and click the Plot And Publish Details Report icon in the right side of 
the status bar. The Plot And Publish Details dialog box appears, offering detailed informa-
tion about the sheets that you published. You can then click the Copy To Clipboard button 
to export the list to a file as a record. If you want to recall this dialog box later, you can do 
so by choosing Print ➢ View Plot And Publish Details from the Application menu.
You may notice that when you click the Publish button in the previous exercise, AutoCAD 
behaves as if it’s printing the layouts in your list—and that is exactly what it’s doing. AutoCAD 
uses its own PDF printer driver to “print” your drawings to a PDF file. AutoCAD uses the layout 
settings from the Plot dialog box for each layout to produce the PDF pages.
Exploring Other Publish Options
A few more options are available when you use the Publish feature. Let’s take a moment to 
review some of the options in the Publish dialog box toolbar:
◆
◆
The Preview tool lets you preview a sheet based on the current settings.
◆
◆
The Add Sheets tool lets you add sheets to the list. The Remove Sheets tool removes a 
selected item from the list.
Automatically Excluding Layouts
In step 2 of the previous exercise, the Model tab was imported. You can prevent Model tabs from 
being included in the sheets list by turning off the Include Model When Adding Sheets option. This 
option is located in the context menu when you right-click in the Sheets list.

Publishing Your Drawings |  919  
◆
◆
The Move Sheet Up and Move Sheet Down tools let you move an item in the list up and 
down. These are important options because the order of drawings in the list determines 
the order in which the drawings will appear in the Acrobat Reader. The item at the top of 
the list appears first; the next one on the list is second, and so on.
◆
◆
The Load Sheet List and Save Sheet List tools let you load and save the list that you’ve com-
piled, respectively. It’s a good idea to save your list in case you need to reproduce the PDF 
file at some future date.
◆
◆
You can use the Plot Stamp Settings tool to specify the data you want to include in the plot 
stamp. This tool opens the Plot Stamp dialog box. (See Bonus Chapter 3, “Hardware and 
Software Tips,” available at www.omura.com/chapters, for more on the Plot Stamp dialog 
box.)
Context Menu Options
If you right-click an item or a set of items in the Publish dialog box list box, you see a menu with 
the standard options mentioned earlier plus some additional options. You’ll want to know about 
a few of these options.
Viewing and Annotating DWG, PDF, and DWF Files
If you prefer, you can publish your drawings using the Autodesk DWF file format. Autodesk offers 
the free Design Review program, which provides a fast and simple way to view and annotate PDF 
and DWF files. In addition to viewing files, the Autodesk Design Review program enables users to 
annotate and mark up drawings, take measurements, and track changes. When used in conjunction 
with Autodesk’s free TrueView program, Design Review also lets you perform these functions on 
DWG files. You can download a copy of Autodesk Design Review and TrueView from the Autodesk 
website. The lasts version of Design Review is 2013.
By default, AutoCAD applies the existing layout settings for each layout when it produces 
the PDF file. These are the settings found in the Plot Or Page Setup dialog box and include the 
sheet size, scale, and page orientation. The Change Page Setup option lets you use a different 
set of layout settings for a selected layout in the list. To use this option, you must have saved a 
page setup in the file’s Page Setup or Plot dialog box. (See Chapter 8 for more on the Page Setup 
dialog box and its options.) You can import a page setup from a different AutoCAD file, or you 
can assign a page setup to a sheet. Do this by clicking the sheet name and selecting a page setup 
from the list box that appears in the Page Setup column.

920  | CHAPTER 25  Managing and Sharing Your Drawings   
To change the page setup for multiple sheets, select all of the sheets from the list first and 
then select the page setup from the list box of the first file in the list.
If you happen to have two layouts with the same name, right-click a layout name, and 
then select the Rename Sheet option on the context menu to rename a layout. The Copy 
Selected Sheets option adds copies of selected layouts to the list. The copies have the word 
copy appended to their names. The last two items in the context menu let you control what 
is displayed in the list box. Include Layouts When Adding Sheets controls whether layouts 
are automatically imported from a drawing into the list box. Include Model When Adding 
Sheets controls whether Model Space views are automatically imported from a drawing into 
the list box.
The Publish Options Dialog Box
You can set up additional options by clicking the Publish Options button in the Publish dialog 
box. You’ll then see the PDF Publish Options dialog box (see Figure 25.9).
Figure 25.9
PDF Publish Options 
dialog box
This dialog box offers options for the location and type of output. If you select DWF in the 
Publish To drop-down list, you’ll see a different set of options.
The Location option lets you select the location for PDF files. The Prompt For Name option 
will ask you for a PDF filename before it begins to publish your drawing. The Multi-Sheet File 
option will produce a single PDF file containing all of the sheets of your published drawing 
set. Other options let you set the drawing quality and specify whether or not you include layer 
information, hyperlinks, or bookmarks.

Publishing Your Drawings |  921  
Creating a PDF or DWF File by Using the Plot Dialog Box
Another way to create PDF and DWF files is through the Plot dialog box. If you need to create 
a PDF or DWF file of only a single sheet, you may want to use the Plot dialog box because it’s a 
simple and familiar procedure.
	
1.	 Open the file that you want to convert to PDF or DWF, and then proceed as if you’re going 
to plot the drawing.
	
2.	 In the Plot dialog box, select DWFx ePlot (XPS Compatible).pc3 or DWF6 ePlot.pc3 from the 
Name drop-down list in the Printer/Plotter area. The DWFx ePlot (XPS Compatible).pc3 
option creates a file that is readable in Windows 10, Windows 8, or Windows 7 without 
the need for any special viewing program. Although you may see an incorrect paper size 
message, you can continue.
	
3.	 For PDF output, select the DWG To PDF.pc3 option from the Name drop-down list in 
the Printer/Plotter area. Or, if you have Adobe Acrobat Pro installed, you can select the 
Adobe PDF option.
	
4.	 Proceed with the plot the normal way. When AutoCAD would normally send the 
drawing to the printer, you’ll see a dialog box asking you to enter a name for your plot 
file and finish with the rest of the plot. You can control the PDF or DWF plot as you would 
any plot.
You can save your plotter settings in the Page Setup panel at the top of the Plot dialog box by 
clicking the Add button. You are asked for a name for your page setup. Later, you can use the 
page setup in the Publish dialog box by selecting it from the Page Setup column (see “Context 
Menu Options” earlier in this chapter). Page setups are saved with the DWG file, and you can 
import them from any drawing file in the Publishing dialog box using the Import option in the 
Page setup column’s drop-down list.
In addition to using the settings available in the Plot dialog box, you can make some special 
configuration adjustments to the PDF or DWF plotter configuration file. Here is where to find 
those configuration settings:
	
1.	 Select a layout tab to make it current, and then right-click the tab and select Page Setup 
Manager to open the Page Setup Manager dialog box. Select a setup from the Page Setups 
list, and then click Modify to open the Page Setup dialog box.
	
2.	 Make sure that the PDF or DWF configuration file is listed in the Name list box of the 
Printer/Plotter group. Although you may see an incorrect paper size message, you can 
continue.
	
3.	 Click the Properties button to the right of the Name drop-down list to open the Plotter 
Configuration Editor dialog box.
	
4.	 Make sure that the Device And Document Settings tab is selected, and then click Custom 
Properties in the list box (see Figure 25.10).
	
5.	 Click the Custom Properties button that appears in the lower half of the dialog box to 
open the PC3 Properties dialog box. Here you can make a variety of setting changes to 
fine-tune your output.

922  | CHAPTER 25  Managing and Sharing Your Drawings   
	
6.	 Click OK after selecting your settings. The Plotter Configuration Editor dialog box reap-
pears. After you’ve set the custom properties, you can save any new settings in the PC3 
file, or you can create a new PC3  plot-configuration file. To save any setting changes, 
click the Save As button and select the PC3 file in which you want to save the settings. For 
more information about PC3 plot configuration files, see “Fine-Tuning the Appearance of 
Output” in Bonus Chapter 3.
	
7.	 Click OK in the Plotter Configuration Editor dialog box to return to the Page Setup 
dialog box.
	
8.	 Click OK to exit the Page Setup dialog box, and then close the Page Setup Manager.
After you select your custom configuration settings in step 5, you needn’t open the Plotter 
Configuration Editor dialog box again the next time you plot a PDF or DWF file. If you save 
your new settings as a new PC3 file, you can select it from the File drop-down list in the Plotter 
Configuration group. You don’t have to reenter the custom settings.
If you plot a drawing using the DWFx ePlot plotter, you can use the Microsoft XPS viewer 
to view the plotted DWFx file. To start the XPS viewer in Windows 7, click the Start button and 
type xpsrchvw.exe↵. In Windows 8 and 10, press and hold the Start button and select Run from 
the menu. Enter xpsrchvw↵ in the text box.

Sharing Files with A360 Drive |  923  
Sharing Files with A360 Drive
Whether you share native AutoCAD DWG files or share files using the DWF format, you have a 
number of ways to convey the files to those who need them. Downloading from websites, trans-
ferring via FTP, and exchanging through email are all common methods for sharing files, but 
they are limited and can leave a user wanting more flexibility.
Autodesk offers the free A360 Drive service, where you can share files in a much more open 
and organized fashion. With A360 Drive, you can make files available to others in a way similar 
to how you would make files available on an FTP site or a website, with the addition of more 
easily controlled access. You can track the shared history of a document or set of documents and 
organize files to suit nearly any project requirement.
Upgrade to the Latest Browser
The A360 Drive website works best when viewed using Internet Explorer 11, Apple Safari v5.1, 
Mozilla Firefox v19, Google Chrome v33, or later versions. If you are not using one of these versions 
of your browser, you may want to upgrade before proceeding with the exercises. Some features may 
not work or appear properly under earlier versions.
Getting Started with A360 Drive
To appreciate what A360 Drive can do for you, you’ll want to try out some of its features. The 
entry point to the cloud service is the A360 Drive Sign In option in the InfoCenter. Try the fol-
lowing to get started:
	
1.	 Click Sign In from the drop-down list in the InfoCenter, and select Sign In To Autodesk 
Account (see Figure 25.11). If you are not signed in with your Autodesk ID already, the 
Autodesk – Sign In dialog box appears first.
Figure 25.11
The Sign In To 
Autodesk Account 
menu option and the 
A360 welcome window
If you haven’t already set up an Autodesk ID, click the Sign Up link just above the Sign In 
text boxes; otherwise, enter your sign-in information.

924  | CHAPTER 25  Managing and Sharing Your Drawings   
After you log in, the A360 welcome window (Figure 25.11) appears. This window only 
appears the first time that you log in to A360.
Once you’ve signed into your Autodesk account, the InfoCenter Sign In drop-down list 
offers a new set of options (Figure 25.12).
Figure 25.12
The InfoCenter Sign In 
drop-down list with

2.	 Open a file and then click the Sign In drop-down list and select A360. Your default 
browser opens, and the A360 Drive site appears.
	
3.	 Click the Close icon in the upper-right corner of the Welcome panel, which occupies the 
top of the page just below the title bar.
	
4.	 Click the Documents tab in the upper-left corner of the page to open the Documents page. 
Figure 25.13 shows this page with a few files to give you an idea of how they appear. You 
can switch between a thumbnail view and a list view by using the icons to the right of the 
Sort By drop-down list.

Sharing Files with A360 Drive |  925  
The A360 Drive Documents page has three main parts. The largest area is a file view panel, 
where your files appear. Across the top is the menu bar that offers a set of actions that you can 
apply to your files. To the left is a column of display filters that help you keep your drawings 
organized. A360 is optimized for the latest version of Internet Explorer so other browsers may 
not show the A360 Drive Documents page in quite the same way as shown in Figure 25.13.
Let’s take a look at the menu bar. You can click the Upload option to upload files. This option 
opens the Upload Documents dialog box. You can then click and drag files into the Drag And 
Drop Here panel. The filename appears in the list box below (see Figure 25.14). You can also just 
click and drag files into the blank file area to open the Upload Documents dialog box.
Figure 25.14
The Upload Documents 
dialog box
The New Folder option creates new folders in the current file view panel. To the right of the 
New Folder option are the Actions and Categories options. To use these options, you first need 
to select a file or set of files from the file view panel, which you can do by clicking the check box 
next to the filename. The Actions option displays a menu that offers options to download, share, 
move, rename, or delete your files.
The Categories icon displays a menu that lets you assign your files to a category that you cre-
ate. You can create categories in the panel to the left by clicking the arrowhead to the right of the 
Categories title. A file can be assigned to multiple categories.
The Actions and Categories options appear in several places in the A360 Drive site so that 
no matter where you are, you always have the Actions or Categories available. For example, 
if you hover over a file in the file view panel, you will see a set of icons. A magnifying glass 
icon enlarges the view of the thumbnail. At the far right is a comments icon that enables you 
to add a text comment to the file. The Actions and Categories icons are between the Zoom and 
Comments icons.

926  | CHAPTER 25  Managing and Sharing Your Drawings   
Sharing Files
When you select a file by placing a check in the file’s check box and clicking Actions ➢ Share, 
you’ll see two options: Private Sharing and Public Sharing. If you want to share a drawing with 
another A360 Drive user, you can select the Private Sharing option. You are then asked to supply 
the email address of the person with whom you want to share your drawing. After you com-
plete this step, the file will appear in the file panel of the person with whom you are sharing.
With the Public Sharing option, you can share drawings with people who do not have an 
Autodesk ID account. Before you can share publicly, you will first have to turn on Public Sharing 
for the file. To do this, click in the check box for the file and then select Actions ➢ Share ➢ Public 
Sharing. You’ll see a dialog box asking if you want to turn on public sharing (see Figure 25.15).
Figure 25.15
The Publicly – 
Document Only dialog 
box
Click the on/off icon (currently showing OFF). The dialog box changes to show you an email 
link that you can send to the person with whom you want to share your file (see Figure 25.16).
Figure 25.16
The Public Sharing 
option
You have the option to copy the link to the Windows Clipboard, email the link, preview the 
link, or embed the link in a website. If you choose Embed, the dialog box expands to offer size 
options and the code needed to embed the file in a website. There is also an option to allow 
the source document to be downloaded or copied.

Sharing Files with A360 Drive |  927  
Viewing Drawings Online
A360 Drive is intended as a tool for collaboration, so it includes some basic annotation features. 
The specific features depend on the type of file you have available in your file panel.
If you look at the Actions menu, you will notice the Open With AutoCAD 360 option. Click 
this button and AutoCAD 360, a web-based AutoCAD drawing viewer, opens.
From here, you can double-click any file listed to open the file in a viewer, which enables you 
to view and annotate your file (see Figure 25.17).
Inserted Drawings Not to Scale?
If you’re sharing files that have the potential for being inserted as blocks or Xrefs, you’ll want to 
know about a little setting that can have a big effect on your work. The Insertion Scale setting in the 
Units dialog box controls how DWG files are scaled when they are inserted into a drawing. To get 
to the Insertion Scale setting, open the Application menu and select Drawing Utilities ➢ Units or 
type Units↵. The Insertion Scale drop-down list is in the middle of the dialog box, as shown here:
Suppose that your drawing is in centimeters and you anticipate that someone will be inserting your 
drawing into another one that is using millimeters. You would set Insertion Scale in your drawing 
to Centimeters. When the person receiving your drawing inserts it in their millimeter drawing, your 
drawing will be automatically scaled to the appropriate size. Likewise, if you receive a drawing that  
does not scale properly when inserted in your drawing, check the Insertion Scale value of both 
your drawing and the inserted drawing and adjust the settings so that the inserted drawing appears 
at the appropriate scale. Drawings that use the Architectural unit type should always be set to 
Inches, but drawings set to the Decimal unit type can have any Insertion Scale setting.

928  | CHAPTER 25  Managing and Sharing Your Drawings   
A pair of toolbars at the bottom of the window offers features similar to the status and 
Navigation bars. You can control layer visibility by using the panels to the right. To view layouts, 
click the Sheets drop-down menu to the right of the drawing title in the AutoCAD 360 menu bar. 
You can store other types of files, such as PDF and DWF files, in A360 Drive. You can annotate 
and get a closer view of these types of files within A360 Drive. Open these types of documents 
in A360 Drive by double-clicking the icon in the A360 Drive Documents view (see Figure 25.18).

Tracking File Versions
A unique feature of A360 Drive is its ability to track different versions of the same file. For 
example, you can upload a file and then have a collaborator make changes to that file online 
using the AutoCAD 360 editor. You can then click the Actions icon to check the version dates of 
the file (see Figure 25.20).
What Happened to AutoCAD 360 Editing?
As of this writing, AutoCAD 360 no longer offers editing tools that allow you to make basic changes 
to DWG files. A notice appears in the AutoCAD 360 page indicating that Autodesk is working on 
new features for AutoCAD 360. Features mentioned in this chapter may change.
Controlling File Access
When you privately share a drawing, you can also control the level of access you give to the 
person with whom you are sharing. For example, you may want to allow only one person to 
view a file, whereas another person may require enough access to add comments to the file 
online.
After you’ve shared a file, you can control the access level through the Share Document dia-
log box (see Figure 25.19). To open this dialog box, select the shared drawing and choose Actions 
➢ Share ➢ Private Sharing.
You can change the access level by clicking in the Access column of the dialog box. A list 
opens offering four levels of access: View Document; View & Download Document; View, 
Download & Update Document; and Full Access. When you hover over one of these options, a 
description of what the collaborator can and cannot do is listed to the right.
Figure 25.19
The Share Document 
dialog box

930  | CHAPTER 25  Managing and Sharing Your Drawings   
In addition, you can download any version using the down arrow in the Actions column or, 
as the owner of the file, revert to a prior version by clicking the clock icon. Even if you revert the 
file, the Document Versions dialog box will still display all the versions of the file that have been 
uploaded or edited online.
As you can see from this brief tour of A360 Drive, sharing files and collaborating with others 
is becoming much easier. You may want to spend some time on your own experimenting with 
the settings and features of A360 Drive now that you’ve gotten your feet wet.
Collaborating with Others Using Design Feed
Besides sharing and editing files, you can add comments and images to files shared on A360 
Drive through the Design Feed feature. Design Feed gives you a way to communicate ideas 
through your drawings by letting you post messages and images directly onto your AutoCAD 
files. You can open Design Feed by typing designfeedopen at the command prompt. The 
Design Feed panel opens (see Figure 25.21).

If the drawing has not been saved to the A360 Drive site, you will see a message at the top of 
the Design Feed panel asking you to save to A360 Drive. When this is done, you can start to add 
comments to the drawing that others can view and respond to. The comments will appear in the 
middle portion of the panel.
There are four tools just below the Create A New Post box:

To use the area or point tool, click the tool icon and then click in the drawing to indicate the 
post’s location. Next, enter a message in the Create A New Post box. Click the Create Post button 
when you’re done. With the Tag tool, you can alert the recipient to your post via an email. The 
Attach Image tool will open a file dialog box where you can locate an image file to include with 
your post (see Figure 25.22).
When recipients of your post view the drawing in A360 Drive, they will see a post as 
a numbered icon. They can click the icon, and the post associated with it will be high-
lighted in the Design Feed panel. They can then add their comments and replies to 
the post. Close the Design Feed panel by clicking the X in the top corner or by typing 
DESIGNFEEDCLOSE.

Adding Hyperlinks to Drawings
AutoCAD offers the Hyperlink tool, which enables you to link any document to an AutoCAD 
object. Then, with a few clicks of your mouse, you can follow the links to view other drawings, 
text files, spreadsheets, or web pages. Hyperlinks persist even after you’ve exported your draw-
ing to a PDF file. You can then post that PDF file on a web page where others can gain access to 
those links.
Creating Hyperlinks
The following steps show you how to add links to a sample floor plan:
	
1.	 In AutoCAD, open the file houseplan.dwg.
	
2.	 In the Insert tab’s Data panel, click the Hyperlink tool.
	
3.	 At the Select objects: prompt, click the hexagonal door symbol, as shown in 
Figure 25.23.
Figure 25.23
The door symbol in the 
houseplan.dwg file
Click this symbol.
	
4.	 When you’re done, press ↵. The Insert Hyperlink dialog box opens (see Figure 25.24).
	
5.	 Click the File button on the right side of the dialog box to open the Browse The Web – 
Select Hyperlink dialog box. It’s a typical file dialog box.
	
6.	 Locate the doorsch.pdf file and select it.
	
7.	 Click Open. The Insert Hyperlink dialog box reappears. Notice that doorsch.pdf appears 
in the list box at the top of the dialog box in the Type The File Or Web Page Name box.
	
8.	 Make sure that the Use Relative Path For Hyperlink option isn’t selected, and then click OK.

Adding Hyperlinks to Drawings |  933  
The link you just created is stored with the drawing file. You can create a PDF file from this 
drawing, and the link will be preserved in the PDF file.
Now let’s see how you can use the link from within the AutoCAD file:
	
1.	 Move your cursor over the hexagonal door symbol. Notice that the cursor changes to the 
hyperlink icon when it’s placed on the symbol. It also shows the name of the file to which 
the object is linked. This tells you that the object is linked to another document some-
where on your system, on your network, or on the Internet (see Figure 25.25).
Figure 25.24
The Insert Hyperlink 
dialog box
Figure 25.25
The hyperlink icon and 
tool tip
	
2.	 Click the hexagonal door symbol to select it.
	
3.	 Right-click in a blank area of the drawing. In the context menu, choose Hyperlink ➢ Open 
“.\doorsch.pdf” to choose the link to the doorsch.dwf file. You can also Ctrl+click the 
door symbol.

934  | CHAPTER 25  Managing and Sharing Your Drawings   
Your PDF viewer program opens and displays the file doorsch.pdf. If you installed the sam-
ple figures on another drive or folder location, the Hyperlink option will reflect that location.
You’ve used the doorsch.pdf file as an example in these exercises, but this could have been a 
text file, a spreadsheet, a database, or even another AutoCAD file. AutoCAD will start the appli-
cation associated with the linked file and open the file.
Editing and Deleting Hyperlinks
You can edit or delete a hyperlink by doing the following:
	
1.	 Select and right-click the object whose link you want to edit, and then choose Hyperlink 
➢ Edit Hyperlink from the context menu. Doing so opens the Edit Hyperlink dialog box, 
which offers the same options as the Insert Hyperlink dialog box (see Figure 25.24, earlier 
in this chapter), with the addition of the Remove Link button.
	
2.	 You can now either change the link or click the Remove Link button in the lower-left cor-
ner of the dialog box to delete the link.
Taking a Closer Look at the Hyperlink Options
You were introduced to the Insert Hyperlink dialog box, shown in Figure 25.24, in the previous 
exercises. Let’s take a moment to study this dialog box in a little more detail.
To specify a file or a website to link to, you can enter either a filename or a website URL in the 
Type The File Or Web Page Name box or use the Or Select From List area, which offers a list box 
and three button options. When you select one of the buttons, the list box changes to offer addi-
tional related options:
Recent Files    Displays a list of recently edited AutoCAD files, as illustrated in Figure 25.24. 
You can then link the object to a file in the list by clicking the filename.
Browsed Pages    Displays a list of websites that you recently visited using your web browser.
Inserted Links    Displays a list of recently inserted links, including files or websites.
You can also use the three buttons to the right of the list box to locate specific files (the 
File button), websites (the Web Page button), or saved views (the Target button) in the current 
drawing.
As you saw in the exercise, the File button opens the Browse The Web – Select Hyperlink dia-
log box, which lets you locate and select a file from A360 Drive, from your computer, from your 
local area network, or even from an FTP site. This is a typical AutoCAD open file dialog box 
with some additional features.
The Web Page button on the right opens a simplified web browser that lets you locate a web 
page for linking. You can use the standard methods for accessing web pages, such as using the 
Look In drop-down list to select recently visited pages or entering a URL in the Name Or URL 
box. The page is then displayed in the main window of the dialog box.
If the selected hyperlink file is an AutoCAD DWG file, the Target button in the Insert 
Hyperlink dialog box opens the Select Place In Document dialog box, which lists the saved 
views in the drawing.
Views are subdivided by layout tabs. At the top is the Model Space tab listing, and below that 
are other layout tab listings. If the current drawing contains saved views, you see a plus sign 
next to the layout tab name. Click the plus sign to display a listing of the views in that layout.

Managing Your Drawings with DesignCenter and the Tool Palettes  |  935  
At the top of the Insert Hyperlink and Edit Hyperlink dialog boxes is a box labeled Text 
To Display. When a hyperlink is added to an object in AutoCAD, AutoCAD will display a 
hyperlink icon whenever the cursor passes over the object. You can also include descrip-
tive text that will display along with the icon by entering the description in the Text To 
Display box.
By default, the text is the name of the hyperlinked item that you select. You can change the 
text to provide a better description of the link.
The Insert Hyperlink dialog box contains a column of options at the far left labeled Link To. The 
top button, Existing File Or Web Page, displays the options discussed so far in this section. The other 
two buttons change the appearance of the Insert Hyperlink dialog box to offer different but familiar 
options:
View Of This Drawing    This button changes the display to show just the views that are 
available in the current drawing. This option performs the same function as the Target but-
ton described earlier.
E-Mail Address    This button changes the Insert Hyperlink dialog box to enable you to link 
an email address to an object. Clicking the object will then open your default email applica-
tion, letting you send a message to the address.
Managing Your Drawings with DesignCenter  
and the Tool Palettes
As you start to build a library of drawings, you’ll find that you reuse many components of 
existing drawing files. Most of the time, you’ll probably be producing similar types of draw-
ings with some variation, so you’ll reuse drawing components such as layer settings, dimen-
sion styles, and layouts. It can be a major task to keep track of all the projects on which you’ve 
worked. It’s especially frustrating when you remember setting up a past drawing in a way 
that you know would be useful in a current project but you can’t remember that file’s name or 
location.
AutoCAD offers DesignCenter™ to help you keep track of the documents that you use in 
your projects. You can think of DesignCenter as a kind of super Windows File Explorer that is 
focused on AutoCAD files. DesignCenter lets you keep track of your favorite files and helps you 
locate files, blocks, and other drawing components. In addition, you can import blocks and other 
drawing components from one drawing to another by using a simple click and drag. If you’ve 
been diligent about setting a unit format for each of your drawings, you can use DesignCenter 
to import symbols and drawings of different unit formats into a drawing and the symbols will 
maintain their proper size. For example, a 90 cm door symbol from a metric drawing can be 
imported into a drawing in Imperial units and DesignCenter will translate the 90 cm metric 
door size to a 35.43″ door.

Getting Familiar with DesignCenter
At first glance, DesignCenter looks a bit mysterious. But it takes only a few mouse clicks to 
reveal a tool that looks much like Windows File Explorer. Try the following steps to become 
familiar with DesignCenter:
	
1.	 Open AutoCAD to a new file, and then click the DesignCenter tool in the View tab’s 
Palettes panel.
DesignCenter opens as a floating palette (see Figure 25.26).

DesignCenter displays a listing of the Favorites folder. You’re actually looking at a view 
of the C:\Users\User Name\Favorites\Autodesk folder, where User Name is your login 
name. Unless you’ve already added items to the \Favorites\Autodesk folder, you see 
a blank view in the right panel. You can add shortcuts to this folder as you work with 
DesignCenter. You may also see a view showing the tree structure of the files that you 
have open in AutoCAD.
	
3.	 Place your cursor in the lower-right corner of the DesignCenter window so that a double-
headed diagonal arrow shows. Then click and drag the corner out so that you have an 
enlarged DesignCenter window that looks similar to Figure 25.27. The view on the right, 
containing the Favorites folder, is called the Palette view. The view on the left is called 
the Tree view.

4.	 Place your cursor on the border between the Tree view and the Palette view until you see 
a double-headed cursor. Then click and drag the border to the right to enlarge the Tree 
view until it covers about one-third of the window.
	
5.	 Use the scroll bar at the bottom to adjust your view of the Tree view so that you can easily 
read its contents.

Auto-Hide DesignCenter
Like the tool palettes and the Properties palette, DesignCenter has an Auto-Hide feature. To 
use it, click the double-headed arrow icon near the top of the DesignCenter title bar, under the 
Close DesignCenter icon. DesignCenter will disappear except for the title bar. You can quickly 
open DesignCenter by placing the cursor on the title bar.
After you have it set up like this, you can see the similarities between DesignCenter and 
Windows File Explorer. You can navigate your computer or network by using the Tree view, just 
as you would in Windows File Explorer. There are a few differences, however, as you’ll see in 
the following exercise:
	
1.	 Click the Home tool on the DesignCenter toolbar. The Palette view changes to display 
the contents of the Sample folder under the Program Files\Autodesk\AutoCAD 2017\ 
folder.
	
2.	 Double-click en-us to open the en-us folder, and then double-click the DesignCenter 
folder.
Instead of the usual list of files, you see a sample image of each file. These are called  
preview icons (see Figure 25.28).

938  | CHAPTER 25  Managing and Sharing Your Drawings   
	
3.	 Click the Views tool on the DesignCenter toolbar, and choose Details from the menu. The 
Palette view changes to show a detailed list of the files in the DesignCenter folder.
	
4.	 Click the Views tool again, and choose Large Icons to return to the previous view. The 
Views tool is similar to the various View options in Windows File Explorer.
	
5.	 Click the Basic Electronics.dwg file to select it. You see a preview of the selected file in 
the Preview panel of DesignCenter. You can adjust the vertical size of the Preview panel 
by clicking and dragging its top or bottom border.
You can also open and close the Preview panel by clicking the Preview tool in the 
DesignCenter toolbar. The preview can be helpful if you prefer viewing files and drawing com-
ponents as a list in the main part of the Palette view.
Below the Preview panel is the Description panel. This panel displays any text information 
included with the drawing or drawing element selected in the Palette view. To add a description 
to a drawing that will be visible here, choose Drawing Utilities ➢ Drawing Properties from the 
Application menu; to add a description to a block, use the Summary tab in the Block Definition 
dialog box.
You can open and close this panel by clicking the Description tool on the DesignCenter 
toolbar. Because the Basic Electronics.dwg file doesn’t have a description attached, the 
Description panel shows the message Last saved by: Autodesk.
Both the Preview and Description panels can offer help in identifying files for which you 
may be looking. After you find a file, you can click and drag it into a folder in the Tree view to 
organize your files into separate folders.
You can also add files to the Favorites folder by right-clicking and then choosing Add To 
Favorites. The file itself isn’t moved to the Favorites folder; instead, a shortcut to the file is cre-
ated in the Favorites folder. If you want to work on organizing your Favorites folder, you can 
open a window to the Favorites folder by right-clicking a file in the Palette view and choosing 
Organize Favorites. A window to the Favorites folder appears.
Because you’ll be working with the sample drawings, go ahead and add the Projects folder 
to the Favorites folder:
	
1.	 Locate the Projects folder (the one created when you installed the sample files) in the 
left panel Tree view, and right-click it.
	
2.	 Choose Add To Favorites from the context menu.

3.	 To go directly to the Favorites folder, click the Favorites tool on the DesignCenter tool-
bar. The Projects folder appears in the right panel in the Palette view.
	
4.	 Double-click the Projects shortcut in the Palette view. You see the contents of the 
Projects folder.
You can go beyond just looking at file listings. You can also look inside files to view their 
components:
	
1.	 In the Palette view, locate the file named 15-unit.dwg in the Chapter 15 folder and 
double-click it. You see a listing of its components in the Palette view. The Tree view also 
shows the file highlighted.
	
2.	 Double-click the Blocks listing in the Palette view. Now you see a listing of all the blocks 
in 15-unit.dwg. 
What Is Autodesk Seek?
You might notice the Autodesk® Seek banner in the upper-right corner of the DesignCenter palette. 
If you click this banner, your web browser opens to the Autodesk Seek home page, where you will 
find a rich resource for drawings and models from manufacturers and users. There are 2D and 3D 
files available in a number of formats, including DWG, DWF, and PDF.
If you prefer to use your web browser to explore the Autodesk Seek site without opening AutoCAD, 
the website address is http://seek.autodesk.com.
Here, you can import any of the drawing components from the DesignCenter palette into an open 
drawing in AutoCAD. But before you try that, let’s look at a few other features of DesignCenter.
Opening and Inserting Files with DesignCenter
By using DesignCenter, you can more easily locate the files you’re seeking because you can view 
thumbnail preview icons. But often that isn’t enough. For example, you might want to locate all the 
files that contain the name of a particular manufacturer in an attribute of a drawing. This can be 
accomplished using the search feature of DesignCenter, which you’ll learn about later in the chapter.
After you’ve found the file you’re seeking, you can load it into AutoCAD by right-clicking the 
filename in the Palette view and then choosing Open In Window. Try it with the following exercise:
	
1.	 Click the Up tool in the DesignCenter toolbar three times. This takes you up two levels in 
the Palette view, from the view of the drawing blocks to the list of filenames.
	
2.	 In the Tree view, select the Chapter 11 folder. Then, in the Palette view of DesignCenter, 
locate the 11c-unit.dwg sample.
	
3.	 Right-click the 11c-unit.dwg file, and select Open In Application Window. The drawing 
appears in the AutoCAD window.
If you want to insert a file into another drawing as a block, you can do so by clicking and 
dragging the file from the DesignCenter Palette view into an open drawing window. You’re then 
prompted for the insertion point, scale, and rotation angle. If you prefer to use the Insert dialog 
Certiﬁcation

box to insert a drawing from DesignCenter, right-click the filename in the Palette view and then 
choose Insert As Block. The Insert dialog box opens, offering you the full set of Insert options, 
as described in Chapter 4, “Organizing Objects with Blocks and Groups.”
Finally, you can attach a drawing as an Xref by right-clicking a file in the Palette view of 
DesignCenter and choosing Attach As Xref. The Attach External Reference dialog box opens, 
offering the insertion point, scale, and rotation options similar to the options in the Insert dialog 
box. This is the same dialog box described in Chapter 7, “Mastering Viewing Tools, Hatches, and 
External References.”
Finding and Extracting the Contents of a Drawing
Aside from the convenience of being able to see thumbnail views of your drawing, DesignCenter 
may not seem like much of an improvement over Windows File Explorer. But DesignCenter goes 
beyond Windows File Explorer in many ways. One of the main features of DesignCenter is that it 
enables you to locate and extract components of a drawing.
Imagine that you want to find a specific block in a drawing. You remember the name of the 
block, but you don’t remember the drawing into which you put it. You can search the contents of 
drawings by using DesignCenter’s Search dialog box. In the following exercise, you’ll search for 
a block named Kitchen2-metric among a set of files:
	
1.	 In the DesignCenter toolbar, click the Search tool to open the Search dialog box. It looks 
similar to the Search tool that comes with Windows.
	
2.	 Select the drive and folder that contains your Projects files from the In drop-down list. 
Make sure that the Search Subfolders option is checked.
	
3.	 Select Blocks from the Look For drop-down list. As you can see from the list, you can 
look for a variety of drawing component types (see Figure 25.29).
Certiﬁcation
Objective

Select Blocks from the 
Look For drop-down list.
	
4.	 Enter Kitchen2-metric in the Search For The Name box, and then click the Search Now 
button to start the search. The magnifying glass icon in the lower-right corner moves in 
a circular pattern, telling you that the Search function is working. After a minute or two, 
the name of the block appears in the window at the bottom of the dialog box.
	
5.	 Double-click the block name. DesignCenter displays the block in the Palette view and the 
file that contains the block in the Tree view.

Exploring the Search Options
As you saw from the previous example, the Search dialog box can be helpful in finding items 
that are buried in a set of drawings. In the exercise, you searched for a block, but you can search 
for any named drawing component, including attribute data and text. For example, if you want 
to find all attributes that contain the name ABC Manufacturing Company in your drawings, you 
can do so with the DesignCenter Search dialog box. Table 25.2 shows a summary of its features. 
When you select Drawings from the Look For drop-down list, you see a set of additional tabs in 
the Search dialog box, as described in Table 25.3.

Automatically Scaling Blocks at Insertion
After you’ve found a block by using DesignCenter, you can click and drag the block into your 
open drawing. In the following exercise, you’ll do that but with a slight twist. The block you’ve 
found is drawn in centimeters, but you’ll insert the Kitchen2-metric block into a drawing named 
11c-unit.dwg, which was created in the Imperial measurement system. If you were to insert 
the Kitchen2-metric block into 11c-unit.dwg, the kitchen would be exactly 2.54 times as large 
as it should be for 11c-unit.dwg. But as you’ll see, DesignCenter takes care of scaling for you. 
Follow these steps:
	
1.	 If you haven’t done so already, open the 11c-unit.dwg sample drawing in AutoCAD. You 
can temporarily close DesignCenter to do this.
	
2.	 Back in DesignCenter, click and drag the Kitchen2-metric block from the Palette view into 
the 11c-unit.dwg window in AutoCAD. The kitchen appears at the appropriate scale.
	
3.	 To confirm that DesignCenter did indeed adjust the scale, select the Kitchen2-metric 
block, right-click, and select Properties.
	
4.	 Check the Unit factor value under the Misc category. Notice the value shows 3⁄8″. This is 
the value at which the Kitchen2-metric block has been scaled. If no scaling is applied, this 
value would be 1.
	
5.	 After reviewing the Properties palette, close it.
You may recall from Chapter 3, “Setting Up and Using the Drafting Tools,” that you can spec-
ify the type of units for which the drawing is set up in the Drawing Units dialog box under the 
Insertion Scale group. DesignCenter uses this information when you drag and drop blocks from 
DesignCenter into an open drawing. This is how DesignCenter is able to scale a block drawn in 
metric correctly to a drawing that is drawn in the Imperial format. The same option is offered in 
the Block Definition dialog box.
Table 25.3:	
DesignCenter Search dialog box tab options when Drawings is selected from 
the Look For drop-down list   (continued)

Managing Your Drawings with DesignCenter and the Tool Palettes  |  943  
Blocks aren’t the only type of drawing component that you can click and drag from the 
Palette view. Linetypes, layouts, dimension styles, and text styles can all be imported from files 
on your computer or network through DesignCenter’s Palette view.
Exchanging Data between Open Files
You’ve seen how you can extract a block from a file stored on your hard disk and place it into 
an open drawing, but what if you want to copy a block from one open drawing to another open 
drawing? You change the way the Tree view displays data so that it shows only the files that are 
loaded in AutoCAD. The following exercise demonstrates how this works:
	
1.	 In AutoCAD, make sure that 11c-unit.dwg is still open, and then open the 11b-unit-
metric.dwg file.
	
2.	 In DesignCenter, click the Open Drawings tab above the Tree view. The Tree view 
changes to display only the drawings that are open.
	
3.	 Click the plus sign (+) to the left of the 11c-unit.dwg filename in the Tree view. The list 
expands to show the components in 11c-unit.dwg.
	
4.	 Click Blocks in the Tree view. The Palette view changes to show a list of blocks available 
in 11c-unit.dwg.
	
5.	 Locate the Kitchen block in the Palette view.
	
6.	 Click and drag Kitchen from the Palette view into the open 11b-unit-metric.dwg 
drawing in AutoCAD. The block moves with the cursor. Once again, DesignCenter 
has automatically scaled the block to the appropriate size, this time from Imperial to 
metric.
	
7.	 Release anywhere in the drawing to place the Kitchen block.
In this example, you inserted a block from one open drawing into another drawing. If you 
prefer to use the Insert dialog box, you can right-click the block name in step 6 and choose 
Insert Block. The Insert dialog box opens, enabling you to set the Insertion Point, Scale, and 
Rotation options.
Just as with drawings, you can see a preview and descriptive text for blocks below the Palette 
view. In Chapter 4, you had the option to save a preview image with the block when you first 
created a block. This is where that preview icon can be really helpful. The preview icon gives 
you a chance to see what the block looks like when you use DesignCenter to browse through 
your drawing files. If you don’t save a preview icon, you’ll see the same block icon that was dis-
played in the previous Palette view.
You can also add the text description at the time you create the block. Before saving the block, 
enter a description in the Description box of the Block Definition dialog box.
If you’re updating older drawing files to be used with DesignCenter, you can add text 
descriptions to blocks by using the Create tool in the Home tab’s Block panel or the Create 
Block tool in the Insert tab’s Block Definition panel. Click the Create tool and then, in the Block 
Definition dialog box, select the name of a block from the Name drop-down list. Enter the 
description that you want for this block in the Description box toward the bottom of the Block 
Definition dialog box. When you’re finished, click OK.

Loading Specific Files into DesignCenter
You’ve seen how you can locate files through the Tree view and Palette view. If you already 
know the name and location of the file with which you want to work, you can use a file dialog 
box to open files in DesignCenter. Instead of choosing the Open tool on the Quick Access tool-
bar, you use the Load tool on the DesignCenter toolbar to open the Load dialog box. This is a 
standard file dialog box that lets you search for files on your computer or network.
If you want to open a file in DesignCenter that you’ve recently opened, you can use the 
History tab just above the Tree view. The Tree view closes, and you see a list of the files that 
you’ve worked on most recently.
Customizing the Tool Palettes with DesignCenter
Many AutoCAD users have built their own custom library of symbols. In Chapter 1, “Exploring 
the Interface,” you saw how easy it is to drag and drop a symbol, known as a tool, from the tool 
palettes. At first glance, there is no obvious way to add your own tools to the palettes, but add-
ing tools and additional palettes to the tool palettes is fairly simple once you’re familiar with 
DesignCenter. The following exercise shows you how it’s done:
	
1.	 If tool palettes aren’t open already, click the Tool Palettes tool in the View tab’s Palettes 
panel.
	
2.	 Right-click in the tool palettes title bar, and then choose New Palette from the context 
menu.
	
3.	 Enter My Tool Palette↵. A new, blank tab is added to the tool palettes.
	
4.	 Go back to DesignCenter, make sure the Folders tab is selected, click the Home tool, and 
select en-us ➢ DesignCenter.
	
5.	 In the Palette view to the right, double-click the Landscaping.dwg file and then double-
click the Blocks icon that appears in the Palette view.
	
6.	 Make sure the tool palettes are visible behind DesignCenter, and then Ctrl+click Clump 
Of Trees Or Bushes – Plan and North Arrow.
	
7.	 Click and drag the selection to the tool palettes. 
Certiﬁcation
Objective
Be Careful Clicking in the Tool Palette
If you click a tool in a tool palette, it’s inserted in the current drawing, so take care when clicking 
around in the tool palettes.
You’ve just created a tool palette and added two symbols. You can continue to add symbols 
from other drawings to your custom tool palette. Or, if you have a drawing that contains all the 
blocks that you need for a tool palette, you can quickly create a tool palette directly from a file. 
Here’s how that’s done:
	
1.	 In DesignCenter, go up two folder levels so that you can select the Landscaping.dwg 
file.

Managing Your Drawings with DesignCenter and the Tool Palettes  |  945  
	
2.	 Right-click Landscaping.dwg, and then choose Create Tool Palette. After a few moments, 
a new tool palette called Landscaping appears in the tool palettes. This new palette con-
tains all the blocks found in the Landscaping.dwg file.
This exercise showed that you can quickly create a palette of all the blocks from a file. You 
can do the same thing with entire folders of drawings, although you may want to make sure 
that such folders don’t contain too many files.
But what if you don’t want some of the items in your custom palette? You can remove items 
easily by using the context menu:
	
1.	 In the Landscaping palette, select the top three symbols by right-clicking the tool that is 
third from the top and then Shift+clicking the top tool. This is a little different from the 
typical Windows method for selecting items from a list.
	
2.	 Right-click and choose Delete from the context menu. Click OK to confirm the deletion.
You may have noticed the Cut and Copy options in the context menu in step 2. You can use these 
options to move symbols from one palette to another. For example, instead of deleting the three 
symbols in step 2, you can choose Cut from the context menu, open another palette, right-click, and 
choose Paste. The symbols move to the new palette location. In the next section, you’ll see how you 
can use the Copy and Paste context menu options to make a copy of a tool in the same palette.
Customizing a Tool
Other context menu options let you delete entire palettes or rename tools or palettes. You can 
also edit the properties of symbols in a palette. The following exercise shows how to use the 
context menu options to create two scale versions of the same tool:
	
1.	 In the Landscaping tab of the tool palettes, right-click the North Arrow tool and choose 
Copy from the context menu.
	
2.	 Right-click in a blank area of the palette (you may need to expand the tool palettes to cre-
ate some space) and choose Paste. A copy of the North Arrow tool appears at the bottom 
of the palette.
	
3.	 Right-click the copy of the North Arrow tool, choose Rename from the context menu, and 
then enter North Arrow Copy↵.
	
4.	 Right-click the North Arrow Copy tool and choose Properties to open the Tool Properties 
dialog box (see Figure 25.30).
	
5.	 Click 1 to the right of the Scale listing, and change the value to 4.
	
6.	 Click OK, and then click and drag the North Arrow Copy tool into the drawing.
	
7.	 Click and drag the original North Arrow tool into the drawing. Notice that the original 
North Arrow is smaller than the North Arrow Copy, whose scale you changed to 4.
This exercise demonstrated that you can have multiple versions of a tool at different scales. 
You can then use the tool that’s appropriate to the scale of your drawing. As you can see from 
the Tool Properties dialog box, you can also modify other tool properties, such as color and layer 
assignments. You can use this feature to create sets of tools for different scale drawings. For 
example, you can create a palette of architectural reference symbols for 1/4″-scale drawings, and 
you can create another palette for 1⁄8″-scale drawings.

946  | CHAPTER 25  Managing and Sharing Your Drawings   
Adding Hatch Patterns and Solid Fills
You’ve seen how you can turn blocks into tool palette tools, but what about solid fills? In 
Chapter 1, you learned that sample hatch patterns and solid fills are available in the tool pal-
ettes. Here’s how you can add your own:
	
1.	 In DesignCenter, use the Tree view to locate the AutoCAD 2017 Support folder. In 
Windows 10, Windows 8, or Windows 7, it’s typically in C:\Users\User Name\AppData\
Roaming\Autodesk\AutoCAD 2017\R21.0\enu\Support (User Name is your Windows 
login name).
	
2.	 Double-click the acad.pat file shown in the Palette view. AutoCAD builds a list of the 
patterns and displays the list in the Palette view.
	
3.	 You can now click and drag a pattern into any tool palette. You can also click and drag an 
entire PAT file into the tool palette to create a palette of all the patterns in a hatch pattern file. 
Figure 25.30
The Tool Properties 
dialog box
Locating Support and Hidden Files
To find out exactly where support files are located, choose Options from the Application menu to 
open the Options dialog box. Click the Files tab. Expand the Support File Search Path item at the 
top of the list, and then place the cursor on the item just below Support File Search Path. You see 
the path to the Support folder. You can also enter (findfile “acad.pat”) at the Command prompt 
as a shortcut to find the support file search path. If you use this shortcut, note that the directory 
names are separated with double hash marks (\\). This is an artifact of AutoLISP®. User support files 
are in a hidden folder. See “Finding Folders That Contain AutoCAD Files” in Appendix B, “Installing 
and Setting Up AutoCAD,” for information on how to unhide hidden folders.

Managing Your Drawings with DesignCenter and the Tool Palettes  |  947  
In this exercise, you used the standard hatch patterns that come with AutoCAD. You can 
also create your own custom hatch patterns and import them to the tool palettes by using the 
method described here. See Chapter 24, “Customizing Toolbars, Menus, Linetypes, and Hatch 
Patterns,” for more information on creating custom hatch patterns.
If you want to set up a set of solid fill colors, you can do the following:
	
1.	 Click and drag the SOLID pattern from the acad.pat file into the tool palette.
	
2.	 Click the new solid fill tool, choose Properties from the context menu, and select a color 
from the Color drop-down list in the Tool Properties dialog box.
You can select any color, including colors from the True Color or Color Books tab in the Select 
Color dialog box that you learned about in Chapter 5, “Keeping Track of Layers and Blocks.” You 
can also cut and paste an existing solid fill tool to make copies. You can then modify the color 
property for each copy to get a set of custom solid fill colors.
Managing the Tool Palettes
You can perform other types of tool palette maintenance operations by using the Customize 
dialog box. For example, you can change the order of the tool palette tabs, or you can group tabs 
into categories that can be turned on or off. The following steps offer a glimpse of what you can 
do by showing you how to group palettes:
	
1.	 To open the Customize dialog box (see Figure 25.31), right-click the tool palettes and 
choose Customize Palettes from the context menu.
Figure 25.31
Customize dialog box 
for tool palettes
	
2.	 Right-click in a blank area of the Palette Groups panel, and choose New Group.
	
3.	 Enter My Group for the new group name.

948  | CHAPTER 25  Managing and Sharing Your Drawings   
	
4.	 Click and drag My Group to a position just above another group; that way, My Group is 
its own group instead of a subgroup.
	
5.	 Click and drag Landscaping from the left panel to the right panel just below My Group. A 
black bar appears below My Group. Release the mouse button.
	
6.	 Click and drag My Tool Palette from the left panel to the right, just below Landscaping.
You’ve just created a new palette group and moved the two new palettes. You can view the 
palettes separately or all together:
	
1.	 Click Close to close the Customize dialog box. The tool palette still displays all the tabs.
	
2.	 To display only the new tabs, click the Properties button at the top of the palette title bar.
	
3.	 Select My Group. Now the tool palette shows only the two tabs that you just created.
You may have noticed that in the Properties menu, you also have the option to show just the 
new groups or all the palettes. This feature lets you keep the tabs in the tool palettes organized.
The list on the left side of the Customize dialog box also lets you change the order of the tabs 
by clicking and dragging the tab names up or down in the left panel. If you select a palette in 
the left panel and right-click, you can rename, delete, import, or export a palette.
DesignCenter and tool palettes offer great features that will prove invaluable to AutoCAD 
users. Although these examples show you how to use DesignCenter on a stand-alone com-
puter, you can just as easily perform the same functions across a network or even across the 
Internet.
Don’t Forget the Source Files When Exporting
If you use the Export or Import option to move a palette from one computer to another, be aware 
that you must also import or export the drawings that are the source files for the palette tools.
This ends our exploration of DesignCenter and tool palettes. In the next section, you’ll look 
at an AutoCAD feature that lets you perform detailed searches in your hard drive for files and 
drawing elements.
Establishing Office Standards
Communication is especially important when you’re one of many people working on the same 
project on separate computers. A well-developed set of standards and procedures helps to mini-
mize problems that may be caused by miscommunication. In this section, you’ll find some sug-
gestions for setting up these standards.
Establishing Layering and Text Conventions
The issue of CAD standards has always been difficult to resolve. Standardizing layers, dimen-
sions, and text can go a long way toward making file exchange more seamless between differ-
ent trades, and standards can also make files easier to understand. When everyone follows a 

Establishing Office Standards |  949  
standard, the structure of a drawing is more easily understood, and those who have to edit or 
interpret your work can do so without having to ask a lot of questions.
You’ve seen how layers can be a useful tool. But they can easily get out of hand when you 
have free rein over their creation and naming. Users may become confused while attempting to 
isolate or identify objects and layers in a drawing with which they’re not familiar. Inconsistent 
layer naming can also inhibit the use of timesaving tools like the Layer Translator (covered later 
in this chapter), AutoLISP routines, and script files that might otherwise be able to automate 
many repetitive tasks. With an appropriate layer-naming convention, you can minimize this 
type of problem (although you may not eliminate it entirely). A too-rigid naming convention 
can cause as many problems as no convention at all, so it’s best to give general guidelines rather 
than force everyone to stay within narrow limits. As mentioned in Chapter 5, you can create 
layer names in a way that enables you to group them by using wildcards. AutoCAD allows up to 
255 characters in a layer name, so you can use descriptive names.
Lineweights should be standardized along with colors. If you intend to use a reprographics 
service for your plotting, check with them first; they may require that you conform to their color 
and lineweight standards.
Checking Office Standards
AutoCAD offers an open-ended environment that lends itself to easy customization, but 
this also leaves the door wide open for on-the-fly creation of layer names, dimension styles, 
and other drawing format options. It’s easy to stray from standards, especially when you’re 
under pressure to get a project out on a deadline. To help you and your office maintain 
a level of conformity to office or industry standards, AutoCAD includes the Standards 
command.
The Standards command lets you quickly compare a drawing against a set of standard layer 
names, dimension style settings, linetypes, and text styles. A dialog box displays any item that 
doesn’t conform to the standards you selected. You can then adjust the file to make it conform to 
your standards.
You can create several sets of standards for different types of files, and you can assign the 
standards directly to a file so that anyone editing that file can make periodic checks against 
your office standards while the drawing is being edited.
The Standards command discussed here isn’t available in the Autodesk® AutoCAD LT® 
software.
Know the Standards
If you’re an architect or an engineer or you are in the construction business, check out some 
of the CAD layering standards set forth by the American Institute of Architects (AIA) and the 
Construction Specifications Institute (CSI). The AIA’s website is located at www.aia.org, and 
the CSI’s website can be found at www.csinet.org. The most popular framework for drawing 
standards remains the National CAD Standard (NCS) from the National Institute of Building 
Sciences, and it includes the AIA layering guidelines. See www.nationalcadstandard.org for 
more information. For European standards, take a look at www.iso.org.

950  | CHAPTER 25  Managing and Sharing Your Drawings   
Setting Up Standards Files
The first step in using the Standards command is to set up a file to which other drawing files 
can be compared. This standards file will be an AutoCAD drawing file with a .dws filename 
extension. Here are the steps to create a new DWS standards file:
	
1.	 Open AutoCAD, and click New on the Quick Access toolbar to create a new file.
	
2.	 Set up the file with the layers, linetypes, dimension styles, and text styles that you want 
as your standards.
	
3.	 Choose Save As from the Application menu.
	
4.	 In the Save Drawing As dialog box, choose AutoCAD Drawing Standards (*.dws) from 
the Files Of Type drop-down list.
	
5.	 Choose a convenient folder for the location of your standards file and click Save.
As an alternative to creating a new file, you can open an existing file that contains the typical 
settings you’ll want to use on your projects. You can then delete all the graphics in the file and 
purge all its blocks and shapes. After you’ve done this, you can begin at step 3 of the previous 
exercise to save the file as a DWS standards file.
You can set up as many DWS files as you need for your office. Often, a single set of standards 
is too limiting if your office is involved in a diverse range of projects, so you may want to set up 
DWS files on a project basis, drawing on a core of generic DWS files.
Using the Standards Command to Associate Standards
After you’ve created your DWS standards files, you can begin to check other files for conformity. 
The next task is to assign your DWS file to the drawing file that you want to check:
	
1.	 In AutoCAD, open the file that you want to check for standards conformity.
	
2.	 Click Configure on the Manage tab’s CAD Standards panel to open the Configure 
Standards dialog box. The Standards tab of this dialog box contains a list box and 
a description area. A row of buttons appears vertically between the list box and 
description.
	
3.	 Click the Add Standards File (F3) button in the middle column of the dialog box.
	
4.	 The Select Standards File dialog box opens. This is a typical AutoCAD file dialog box. 
Notice that the Files Of Type drop-down list shows the Standards (*.dws) file type.
	
5.	 Locate and select the standards file that you want to use to check the current file and click 
Open. After a moment, the name of the file that you select appears in the list box (see 
Figure 25.32). On the right side of the dialog box you see a description of the standards 
file.
	
6.	 Check the current file against the DWS standards file. Click the Check Standards button 
in the lower-left corner of the Configure Standards dialog box. AutoCAD pauses while it 
checks the current file, and then you see the Check Standards dialog box.

Establishing Office Standards |  951  
If AutoCAD finds a discrepancy between the standards file and the current file, a descrip-
tion of the problem appears at the top of the dialog box. For example, if the name of a dimension 
style that isn’t in the standards file appears in the current file, a message appears indicating that 
a nonstandard dimension style exists in the current drawing. If this happens, take the following 
steps:
	
1.	 Below the problem statement is the Replace With list box, which contains options related 
to the nonstandard item. You can replace the nonstandard item in your file with an 
option in the Replace With list box by selecting the option and clicking the Fix button in 
the lower half of the dialog box. Or you can leave the problem alone for now.
	
2.	 Click the Next button in the lower-right corner of the Check Standards dialog box to 
move to the next problem.
	
3.	 Repeat steps 1 and 2 until you see the statement Checking is complete in the Problem 
list box and the Checking Complete dialog box opens to display a summary of the check-
ing results.
You can check Mark This Problem As Ignored if you want the Check Standards dialog box to 
ignore the problem in future standards-checking sessions.
In this example, you entered the Check Standards dialog box directly from the Configure 
Standards dialog box. After you’ve used the Check Standards dialog box on a file, the DWS 
standards file is associated with the checked file. You can go directly to the Check Standards 
dialog box by choosing Manage ➢ CAD Standards ➢ Check during any subsequent editing 
session.
Figure 25.32
Associating a set of 
standards with a file
Don’t Lose the DWS
After you’ve assigned a DWS standards file to a drawing, you’ll need to save the drawing or its 
association with the DWS file will be lost.

952  | CHAPTER 25  Managing and Sharing Your Drawings   
Checking Standards for Multiple Drawings
The Standards and Check Standards commands are great for checking individual files, but 
eventually you’ll want a method to batch-check a set of files. AutoCAD 2017 provides a util-
ity that does just that. The Batch Standards Checker is a stand-alone utility that audits a set of 
drawing files and checks them against their associated DWS files. The Batch Standards Checker 
can also check a set of drawings against a single DWS file of your choice. It then generates an 
audit report showing any problems it encounters.
Here’s how it works:
	
1.	 From the Windows Desktop, choose Start ➢ All Programs ➢ Autodesk ➢ AutoCAD 
2017 ➢ Batch Standards Checker to open the Batch Standards Checker dialog box (see 
Figure 25.33).
Figure 25.33
The Batch Standards 
Checker dialog box
	
2.	 Click the plus button in the middle of the dialog box to open the Batch Standards Checker 
– File Open dialog box. This is a typical AutoCAD file dialog box.
	
3.	 Locate and select the drawings that you want to check. You return to the Batch Standards 
Checker dialog box and, after a moment, a list of the drawings that you selected appears 
in the Drawings To Check list box.
	
4.	 Click the Standards tab (see Figure 25.34). This is where you can select the standards file 
against which your selection will be checked.
If the drawings you selected in step 3 already have a standards file associated with them, 
you can use the Check Each Drawing Using Its Associated Standards Files option to check 
each file. You can then skip to step 7.
	
5.	 If you select the Check All Drawings Using The Following Standards Files option, click 
the plus sign in the middle of the dialog box to open the file dialog box.

Establishing Office Standards |  953  
	
6.	 Locate and select a DWS standards file. The file then appears in the Standards Used For 
Checking All Drawings list box on the left of the Standards tab in the Batch Standards 
Checker dialog box.
	
7.	 Click the Save button at the top of the Batch Standards Checker dialog box.
The Batch Standards Checker’s file save dialog box opens to enable you to specify a 
standards check filename and location. This file has a .chx filename extension.
	
8.	 After you’ve specified the location and name of a check file, click the Start Check button. 
Figure 25.34
Choose the files that you 
want to check and then 
select the Standards tab.
What Is a CHX File?
The Batch Standards Checker file is an audit file that stores the drawing list and the list of standards 
files in the current session. It also stores the results of the audit. The CHX file is an XML-based file.
AutoCAD proceeds to check each file listed in the Drawings tab list box. The progress is 
shown in the Progress tab of the Batch Standards Checker dialog box. If you decide to cancel the 
audit, you can click the Stop Check button, which cancels the audit currently in progress. When 
files are being checked, the Stop Check button turns red.
When all the files have been checked, the data from the audit is automatically saved in the 
check file that you created in step 7. Then the audit file is opened in your web browser and you 
see the results of the audit. If your browser is blocking Active X, the options described next will 
be unavailable.
The audit report file displays a number of options in a set of radio buttons:
Overview    Displays a simplified view of the problems encountered by the audit. It lists the 
drawings audited and the number of problems encountered.

954  | CHAPTER 25  Managing and Sharing Your Drawings   
Plug-Ins    Shows the standard plug-ins used to audit the drawings. Autodesk supplies these 
standard plug-ins, which test for layers, dimension styles, linetypes, and text styles. Third-
party developers can create other plug-ins to check for additional problems.
Standards    Lists the DWS standards files used for the audit.
Problems    Displays a detailed description of the problems encountered in the audit. It gives 
the drawing name and the name of the specific item that is a problem. For example, if the 
audit discovers a nonstandard layer name, the layer name is listed under the drawing name 
as a nonstandard layer name.
Ignored Problems    Displays problems that have previously been flagged as problems to 
ignore. You can flag problems to be ignored by using the Check Standards command in 
AutoCAD. (See the section “Using the Standards Command to Associate Standards” earlier 
in this chapter.)
All    Displays all the audit information.
Reviewing Previously Saved Standards Audits
After you’ve created a check file and completed a standards audit, you can always return to the 
audit by opening the Batch Standards Checker utility and clicking the Open tool in the toolbar.
This opens the Batch Standards Checker file open dialog box, where you can locate and open 
a previously saved standards check file with the .chx filename extension. In this file, you see a 
list of the files that were checked in the Drawings tab and the DWS standards file used in the 
Standards tab.
You can then view the results of the audit by clicking the View Report tool in the toolbar. 
This opens a web browser and displays the audit results contained in the standards check file.
Converting Multiple Layer Settings
As AutoCAD files flow in and out of your office, you’re likely to find yourself working with 
layering standards from another system. You might, for example, receive files from an architect 
who uses the CSI standard for layer names, whereas your office prefers the AIA standard. If 
your job involves extensive reworking of such files, you’ll want to change the layering system 
to one with which you’re most familiar. But converting layer settings is a painstaking and time-
consuming process, especially if several files need conversion.
Fortunately, AutoCAD offers a tool that can make layer conversion from one standard to 
another much easier. The Layer Translator lets you map nonstandard layers (that is, those using 
a system different from your own) to your own set of standards. It can then convert those layers 
to match your office standards. After you’ve mapped a set of layers between two files, you can 
save the map settings in a drawing file. Then any other files you receive that contain the same 
nonstandard layer settings can be converted to your own layer standards quickly. Let’s take a 
closer look at how the Layer Translator works.
When using the Layer Translator, you must initially match the layers of your incoming file 
with those of a file whose layers are set up in the way that you want. Here are the steps to do this:
	
1.	 Open the file whose layers you want to convert in AutoCAD. Select the Layer Translator 
tool from the Manage tab’s CAD Standards panel to open the Layer Translator dialog box, 
which lists the layers from the current file in the Translate From list box.

Converting Multiple Layer Settings |  955  
	
2.	 Click the Load button in the Translate To group to open the Select Drawing File dialog 
box. Locate and select a file that contains the layer settings that you want to use for this 
project. The file can be a standard DWG file, or it can be a DWS standards file or a DWT 
template file. After you’ve opened a file, its layer names appear in the Translate To list box.
	
3.	 Select a layer name in the Translate From list, and then select the layer with the set-
tings that you want to use from the Translate To list box. After you’ve made your two 
selections, click the Map button in the middle of the dialog box. An item in the Layer 
Translation Mappings group shows you the old and new layer names and the layer set-
tings for the conversion (see Figure 25.35).
Figure 25.35
The Layer Translator 
dialog box
	
4.	 Repeat step 3 for all the layers that you want to convert. You can map several layers from 
the Translate From list to a single layer in the Translate To list if you need to do so.
	
5.	 If there are matching layers in the Translate From and Translate To list boxes, the Map 
Same button in the middle of the dialog box becomes active. You can then click this but-
ton to map layers automatically, which have the same names in both the Translate From 
and the Translate To lists.
After you’ve completed your layer mapping, you can save the mapping for future use:
	
1.	 While still in the Layer Translator dialog box, click the Save button in the Layer 
Translation Mappings group to open the Save Layer Mappings dialog box. This is a typi-
cal AutoCAD file dialog box.
	
2.	 Enter a name for your saved settings and click Save. You can save the layer map settings 
as either a DWS standards file or a DWG file.
	
3.	 Click the Translate button and AutoCAD will proceed to translate the mapped layers. 
You may see a warning message saying that a standards violation has occurred. The mes-
sage can be ignored as they will have been translated.

956  | CHAPTER 25  Managing and Sharing Your Drawings   
After you’ve saved the layer mapping in step 2, you can load the saved layer map settings 
into the Layer Translator dialog box in future layer translations. This saves you the effort of 
mapping each layer individually each time you want to perform a translation. This will work for 
incoming files that use the same layer settings, but you’ll have to create another layer map set-
tings file for each different layer system you encounter.
To use a saved layer map, click the Load button in the Translate To group of the Layer 
Translator dialog box and then select the layer map file you saved in step 2. You can have several 
layer map files for each project involving files with nonstandard layer settings.
Exploring Other Layer Translator Options
You’ll often come across situations in which the layers in the Translate From list don’t corre-
spond directly to those in the Translate To list. For these situations, the Layer Translator offers a 
few additional options.
If you have difficulty finding a match for layers in the Translate From list, you can create a 
new layer by clicking the New button in the Translate To group. This opens the New Layer dia-
log box (see Figure 25.36) in which you can enter the properties for your new layer. Note that the 
layer name cannot be changed.
Figure 25.36
Creating a new layer
After you create a new layer with this dialog box, it appears in the Translate To list box, 
enabling you to map Translate From layers to your new layer.
Another option that you’ll find to be useful is the Edit button in the Layer Translation 
Mappings group. You may find that after you’ve mapped a Translate From layer to a Translate 
To layer, the Translate To layer isn’t exactly what you want. You can highlight the mapped layer 
in the Layer Translation Mappings group list box and then click Edit to open the Edit Layer dia-
log box (see Figure 25.37). From here, you can modify the new layer’s settings from their original 
values.
Finally, the Layer Translator offers a set of options that give you some control over the way 
translations are performed. For example, you can control whether layer colors and linetypes 
are forced to the ByLayer setting or whether layer assignments for objects in blocks are trans-
lated. You can access these options by clicking the Settings button in the lower-left corner of 
the Layer Translator dialog box. Figure 25.38 shows the Settings dialog box. The options are 
self-explanatory.

The Bottom Line |  957  
The Bottom Line

Appendix A
The Bottom Line
Chapter 1: Exploring the Interface
Use the AutoCAD® window.    AutoCAD® is a typical Windows graphics program that 
makes use of menus, toolbars, Ribbon panels, and palettes. If you’ve used other graphics 
programs, you’ll see at least a few familiar tools.
Master It    Name the components of the AutoCAD window that you can use to select a 
function.
Solution    AutoCAD offers the Quick Access toolbar, the Application menu, Ribbon 
panels, the Navigation bar, and the status bar to give you access to the most common 
functions.
Get a closer look with the Zoom command.    One of the first things that you’ll want to 
learn is how to manipulate your views. The Zoom command is a common tool in graphics 
programs.
Master It    Name at least two ways of zooming into a view.
Solution    Choose options from the Zoom flyout in the View tab’s Navigate panel. You 
can also right-click and select Zoom from the shortcut menu and select Zoom options 
from the Navigation bar’s Zoom flyout.
Save a file as you work.    Nothing is more frustrating than having a power failure that 
causes you to lose hours of work. It’s a good idea to save your work frequently. AutoCAD 
offers an Automatic Save feature that can be a lifesaver if you happen to forget to save your 
files.
Master It    How often does the AutoCAD Automatic Save feature save your drawing?
Solution    Automatic Save saves a copy of a drawing every 10 minutes by default. The 
user can modify this interval.
Make changes and open multiple files.    As with other Windows programs, you can have 
multiple files open and exchange data between them.
Master It    With two drawings open, how can you copy parts of one drawing into the 
other?
Solution    Use Windows Copy and Paste. Select the parts you want to copy, right-click, 
and select Clipboard and then Copy. Go to the other drawing, right-click in the drawing 
area, and select Clipboard and then Paste.

962  | Appendix A  The Bottom Line  
Chapter 2: Creating Your First Drawing
Specify distances with coordinates.    One of the most basic skills that you need to learn is 
how to indicate exact distances through the keyboard. AutoCAD uses a simple annotation 
system to indicate distance and direction.
Master It    What would you type to indicate a relative distance of 14 units at a 45° angle?
Solution    @14<45
Interpret the cursor modes and understand prompts.    The AutoCAD cursor changes its 
shape depending on the command that is currently active. These different cursor modes can 
give you a clue regarding what you should be doing.
Master It    Describe the Point Selection cursor and the Pickbox cursor.
Solution    The Point Selection cursor is a simple crosshair. The Pickbox cursor is a small 
square, or pickbox.
Select objects and edit with grips.    Grips are small squares or arrowheads that appear at 
key points on the object when they’re selected. They offer a powerful way to edit objects.
Master It    How do you select multiple grips?
Solution    Hold down the Shift key while clicking the grips.
Use dynamic input.    Besides grips, objects display their dimensional properties when 
selected. These dimensional properties can be edited to change an object’s shape.
Master It    How do you turn on the Dynamic Input display? And once it’s on, what key 
lets you shift between the different dimensions of an object?
Solution    The Dynamic Input button on the AutoCAD status bar turns Dynamic Input 
on and off. When an object is selected, you can move between the dimensional properties 
by pressing the Tab key.
Display data in a text window.    AutoCAD offers the AutoCAD Text Window, which keeps 
a running account of the commands that you use. This can be helpful in retrieving input that 
you’ve entered when constructing your drawing.
Master It    Name a command that displays its results in the AutoCAD Text Window.
Solution    The List command.
Display the properties of an object.    The Properties palette is one of the most useful 
sources for drawing information. Not only does it list the properties of an object, it also lets 
you change the shape, color, and other properties of objects.
Master It    How do you open the Properties palette for a particular object?
Solution    You select the object whose properties you want to view, right-click the object, 
and select Properties.
Get help.    The AutoCAD Autodesk Exchange website is thorough in its coverage of 
AutoCAD features. New and experienced users alike can often find answers to their ques-
tions through the Help window, so it pays to become familiar with it.
Master It    What keyboard key do you press for context-sensitive help?
Solution    For help, you press the F1 key.

Chapter 4: Organizing Objects with Blocks and Groups |  963  
Chapter 3: Setting Up and Using the Drafting Tools
Set up a work area.    A blank AutoCAD drawing offers few clues about the size of the area with 
which you’re working, but you can get a rough idea of the area shown in the AutoCAD window.
Master It    Name two ways to set up the area of your work.
Solution    You can use the Limits command to define the work area, otherwise known as 
the limits of the drawing. You can also draw a rectangle that is the size of your work area.
Explore the drawing process.    To use AutoCAD effectively, you’ll want to know how the 
different tools work together to achieve an effect. The drawing process often involves many 
cycles of adding objects and then editing them.
Master It    Name the tool that causes the cursor to point in an exact horizontal or vertical 
direction.
Solution    Polar Tracking. Ortho mode can also perform this function.
Plan and lay out a drawing.    If you’ve ever had to draw a precise sketch with just a pencil 
and pad, you’ve probably used a set of lightly drawn guidelines to lay out your drawing first. 
You do the same thing in AutoCAD, but instead of lightly drawn guidelines, you can use any 
object you want. In AutoCAD, objects are easily modified or deleted, so you don’t have to be 
as careful when adding guidelines.
Master It    What is the name of the feature that lets you select exact locations on objects?
Solution    Object Snap, or Osnap.
Use the AutoCAD modes as drafting tools.    The main reason for using AutoCAD is to pro-
duce precision technical drawings. AutoCAD offers many tools to help you produce a draw-
ing with the precision you need.
Master It    What dialog box lets you set both the grid and snap spacing?
Solution    The Drafting Settings dialog box.
Chapter 4: Organizing Objects with Blocks and Groups
Create and insert a symbol.    If you have a symbol that you use often in a drawing, you can 
draw it once and then turn it into an AutoCAD block. A block can be placed in a drawing 
multiple times in any location, like a rubber stamp. A block is stored in a drawing as a block 
definition, which can be called up at any time.
Master It    Name the dialog box used to create a block from objects in a drawing, and 
also name the tool used to open this dialog box.
Solution    The Block Definition dialog box can be opened using the Create tool.
Modify a block.    Once you’ve created a block, it isn’t set in stone. One of the features of 
a block is that you can change the block definition, and all of the copies of the block are 
updated to the new definition.
Master It    What is the name of the tool used to “unblock” a block?
Solution    You can use the Explode tool to break a block down to its component objects. 
Once this is done, you can modify the objects and then redefine the block.

964  | Appendix A  The Bottom Line  
Understand the annotation scale.    In some cases, you’ll want to create a block that is depen-
dent on the drawing scale. You can create a block that adjusts itself to the scale of your draw-
ing through the annotation scale feature. When the annotation scale feature is turned on 
for a block, the block can be set to appear at the correct size depending on the scale of your 
drawing.
Master It    What setting in the Block Definition dialog box turns on the annotation scale 
feature, and how do you set the annotation scale of a block?
Solution    The Annotative option in the Block Definition dialog box turns on the annota-
tion scale feature. You can set the scales for a block by selecting the block, right-clicking, 
and selecting Object Scale ➢ Add/Delete Scales.
Group objects.    Blocks can be used as a tool to group objects together, but blocks can be 
too rigid for some grouping applications. AutoCAD offers groups, which are collections of 
objects that are similar to blocks but aren’t as rigidly defined.
Master It    How are groups different from blocks?
Solution    You can easily edit objects in a group by turning groups off with a 
Shift+Ctrl+A keystroke. Also, unlike blocks, groups don’t have a single definition that’s 
stored in the drawing and that defines the group’s appearance. You can copy a group, but 
each copy is independent of the other groups.
Chapter 5: Keeping Track of Layers and Blocks
Organize information with layers.    Layers are perhaps the most powerful feature in 
AutoCAD. They help to keep drawings well organized, and they give you control over the 
visibility of objects. They also let you control the appearance of your drawing by setting 
colors, lineweights, and linetypes.
Master It    Describe the process of creating a layer.
Solution    First, click the Layer Properties Manager tool in the Home tab’s Layers panel. 
Second, click the New Layer button at the top of the palette. Finally, type the name for 
your new layer.
Control layer visibility.    When a drawing becomes dense with information, it can be dif-
ficult to edit. If you’ve organized your drawing using layers, you can reduce its complexity by 
turning off layers that aren’t important to your current session.
Master It    Describe at least two methods for hiding a layer.
Solution    Open the Layer Properties Manager, select a layer, and click the Freeze icon 
for the layer. You can also open the layer drop-down list in the Home tab’s Layers panel 
and click the Freeze icon for the layer you want to hide. You can also use the On/Off 
(lightbulb) icon in the Layer Properties Manager or the layer drop-down list to change a 
layer’s visibility.
Keep track of blocks and layers.    At times, you may want a record of the layers or blocks in 
your drawing. You can create a list of layers using the log-file feature in AutoCAD.

Chapter 6: Editing and Reusing Data to Work Efficiently |  965  
Master It    Where do you go to turn on the log-file feature?
Solution    You can open the Options dialog box or use the Logfilemode system variable.
Chapter 6: Editing and Reusing Data to Work Efficiently
Create and use templates.    If you find that you’re using the same settings when you create 
a new drawing file, you can set up an existing file the way you like and save it as a template. 
You can then use your saved template for any new drawings you create.
Master It    Describe the method for saving a file as a template.
Solution    After setting up a blank drawing with the settings you use most frequently,

AutoCAD Drawing Template (*.dwt) from the Files Of Type drop-down list, give the file 
a name, and click Save. In the Template Options dialog box, enter a description and click 
OK to save the template.
Copy an object multiple times.    Many tools in AutoCAD allow you to create multiple cop-
ies. The Array command offers a way to create circular copies, row and column copies, and 
copies that follow a path.
Master It    What names are given to the three types of arrays offered in the Modify panel?
Solution    Rectangular, polar, and path.
Develop your drawing.    When laying down simple line work, you’ll use a few tools fre-
quently. The exercises in the early part of this book showed you some of these commonly 
used tools.
Master It    What tool can you use to join two lines end to end?
Solution    Fillet.
Find an exact distance along a curve.    AutoCAD offers some tools that allow you to find an 
exact distance along a curve.
Master It    Name the two tools that you can use to mark off exact distances along a 
curve.
Solution    Measure and Divide.
Change the length of objects.    You can accurately adjust the length of a line or arc in 
AutoCAD using a single command.
Master It    What is the keyboard alias for the command that changes the length of 
objects?
Solution    The command is Lengthen. You can also use len.
Create a new drawing by using parts from another drawing.    You can save a lot of time by 
reusing parts of drawings. The Export command can help.
Master It    True or false: The Export command saves only blocks as drawing files.
Solution    False. You can use Export on any type of object or set of objects in a drawing.

drawn over and over. AutoCAD makes quick work of repetitive elements in a drawing, as 
shown in the first part of this chapter.
Master It    What is the object used as the basic building block for the floor plan drawing 
in the beginning of this chapter?
Solution    Blocks of a typical unit plan are used to build a floor plan of an apartment 
building.
Take control of the AutoCAD display.    Understanding the way the AutoCAD display 
works can save you time, especially in a complex drawing.
Master It    Name the dialog box used to save views in AutoCAD. Describe how to recall 
a saved view.
Solution    The View Manager dialog box allows you to save views. You can recall views 
by selecting them from the Views flyout on the View tab’s Views panel.
Use hatch patterns in your drawings.    Patterns can convey a lot of information at a glance. 
You can show the material of an object or you can indicate a type of view, like a cross section, 
by applying hatch patterns.
Master It    How do you open the Hatch And Gradient dialog box?
Solution    Choose Hatch from the Home tab’s Draw panel, and then click the Hatch 
Settings tool in the Hatch Creation tab’s Options panel title bar.
Understand the boundary hatch options.    The hatch options give you control over the way 
that hatch patterns fill an enclosed area.
Master It    Describe an island as it relates to boundary hatch patterns.
Solution    An island is an enclosed object that is found in an area to be hatched.
Use external references.    External references are drawing files that you’ve attached to the 
current drawing to include as part of the drawing. Because external references aren’t part of 
the current file, they can be worked on at the same time as the referencing file.
Master It    Describe how drawing files are attached as external references.
Solution    Open the External References palette, click the Attach DWG tool at the upper 
left, and then locate and select the file you want to attach.
Chapter 8: Introducing Printing, Plotting, and Layouts
Understand the plotter settings.    Unlike other types of documents, AutoCAD drawings can 
end up on nearly any size sheet of paper. To accommodate the range of paper sizes, the AutoCAD 
plotter settings are fairly extensive and give you a high level of control over your output.
Master It    Name at least two  of the settings available in the Plot scale panel of the Plot 
dialog box.
Solution    Fit to paper, Scale, inches, mm, Scale lineweights.

Chapter 9: Adding Text to Drawings |  967  
Use layout views to control how your plots look.    The Layout tabs in AutoCAD offer a way 
to let you set up how a drawing will be plotted. You can think of the layout views as paste-up 
areas for your drawings.
Master It    Name some of the items that you see in a layout view.
Solution    Layout views show the paper orientation, plotter margins, and the location of 
your drawing on the final plotted output.
Add an output device.    Typically, AutoCAD will use the Windows system printer as an 
output device, but often you will find that the printer you use is a dedicated plotter that is not 
connected to Windows in the usual way. AutoCAD lets you add custom plotters and printers 
through the Add-A-Plotter Wizard.
Master It    How do you start the Add-A-Plotter Wizard?
Solution    Click the Plotter Manager tool on the Output tab’s Plot panel, and double-click 
the Add-A-Plotter Wizard application in the Plotters window.
Store a page setup.    Most of the time, you will use the same plotter settings for your draw-
ings. You can save plotter settings using the Page Setup feature.
Master It    Describe a way to create a page setup. Describe how to retrieve a setup.
Solution    Click the Page Setup Manager tool in the Output tab’s Plot panel; then click 
New in the Page Setup Manager dialog box. Enter a name for your page setup in the 
New Page Setup dialog box and then click OK. When you plot your drawing, you can 
retrieve a page setup by selecting it from the Page Setup drop-down list in the Plot 
dialog box.
Chapter 9: Adding Text to Drawings
Prepare a drawing for text.    AutoCAD offers an extensive set of features for adding text to a 
drawing, but you need to do a little prep work before you dive in.
Master It    Name two things that you need to do to prepare a drawing for text.
Solution    Set up a layer for your text. Create a text style for your drawing.
Set the annotation scale and add text.    Before you start to add text, you should set the 
annotation scale for your drawing. Once this is done, you can begin to add text.
Master It    In a sentence or two, briefly describe the purpose of the annotation scale fea-
ture. Name the tool that you use to add text to a drawing.
Solution    The annotation scale feature converts your text size to the proper height for 
the scale of your drawing. To add text to a drawing, use the Mtext tool.
Explore text formatting in AutoCAD.    Because text styles contain font and text-size set-
tings, you can usually set up a text style and then begin to add text to your drawing. For 
those special cases where you need to vary the text height and font or other text features, you 
can use the Formatting panel of the Text Editor tab.
Master It    What text formatting tool can you use to change text to boldface type?
Solution    The Bold button.

968  | Appendix A  The Bottom Line  
Add simple single-line text objects.    In many situations, you need only a single word or a 
short string of text. AutoCAD offers the single-line text object for these instances.
Master It    Describe the methods for starting the single-line text command.
Solution    Click the Single Line tool in the Annotate tab’s Text panel or the Home tab’s 
Annotation panel. Enter DT↵ at the Command prompt.
Use the Check Spelling feature.    It isn’t uncommon for a drawing to contain the equiva-
lent of several pages of text, and the likelihood of having misspelled words can be high. 
AutoCAD offers the Check Spelling feature to help you keep your spelling under control.
Master It    What option do you select in the Check Spelling dialog box when it finds a 
misspelled word and you want to accept the suggestion it offers?
Solution    Change.
Find and replace text.    A common activity when editing technical drawings is finding and 
replacing a word throughout a drawing.
Master It    True or false: The Find And Replace feature in AutoCAD works very differ-
ently from the find-and-replace feature in other programs.
Solution    False.
Chapter 10: Using Fields and Tables
Use fields to associate text with drawing properties.    Fields are a special type of text object 
that can be linked to object properties. They can help to automate certain text-related tasks.
Master It    Name two uses for fields that you learned about in the first part of this 
chapter.
Solution    Fields can be used to update text that labels a block. They can also be used to 
update text and report the area enclosed by a polyline.
Add tables to your drawing.    The Tables feature can help you make quick work of sched-
ules and other tabular data that you want to include in a drawing.
Master It    What is the name of the dialog box that appears when you click the Table tool 
in the Annotate tab’s Tables panel?
Solution    Insert Table.
Edit the table line work.    Because tables include line work to delineate their different cells, 
AutoCAD gives you control over table borders and lines.
Master It    How do you get to the Cell Border Properties dialog box?
Solution    Select the cell or cells in the table, right-click, and choose Borders.
Add formulas to cells.    Tables can also function like a spreadsheet by allowing you to add 
formulas to cells.
Master It    What type of text object lets you add formulas to cells?
Solution    Field.

Chapter 11: Using Dimensions |  969  
Import and export tables.    The Table feature allows you to import Microsoft Excel spread-
sheets into AutoCAD.
Master It    Describe how to import a spreadsheet from Excel into AutoCAD.
Solution    Open the spreadsheet, and select the cells you want to import. Right-click and 
select Copy to copy the spreadsheet data into the Clipboard. In AutoCAD, choose Paste 
Special from the Paste flyout of the Home tab’s Clipboard panel. In the Paste Special dia-
log box, select AutoCAD Entities and click OK.

with a title, column headings, and other data.
Master It    Name the four groups in the New Table Style dialog box.
Solution    Starting Table, General, Cell Styles, and Cell Style Preview.
Chapter 11: Using Dimensions
Understand the components of a dimension.    Before you start to dimension with 
AutoCAD, become familiar with the different parts of a dimension. Doing so will help you 
set up your dimensions to fit the style you need.
Master It    Name a few of the dimension components.
Solution    Dimension line, dimension text, extension line, and arrow.
Create a dimension style.    As you become more familiar with technical drawing and draft-
ing, you’ll learn that there are standard formats for drawing dimensions. Arrows, text size, 
and even the way dimension lines are drawn are all subject to a standard format. Fortunately, 
AutoCAD offers dimension styles that let you set up your dimension format once and then 
call up that format whenever you need it.
Master It    What is the name of the dialog box that lets you manage dimension styles and 
how do you open it?
Solution    The Dimension Style Manager is the name of the dialog box. You can open it 
by clicking the Dimension Style tool in the Annotate tab’s Dimensions panel title bar.
Draw linear dimensions.    The most common dimension that you’ll use is the linear dimen-
sion. Knowing how to place a linear dimension is a big first step in learning how to dimen-
sion in AutoCAD.
Master It    Name the three locations for which you are prompted when placing a linear 
dimension.
Solution    First extension line origin, second extension line origin, and dimension line 
location.
Edit dimensions.    Dimensions often change in the course of a project, so you should know 
how to make changes to dimension text or other parts of a dimension.
Master It    How do you start the command to edit dimension text?
Solution    Enter ED↵ at the Command prompt.

970  | Appendix A  The Bottom Line  
Dimension nonorthogonal objects.    Not everything you dimension will use linear dimen-
sions. AutoCAD offers a set of dimension tools for dimensioning objects that aren’t made up 
of straight lines.
Master It    Name some of the types of objects for which a linear dimension isn’t 
appropriate.
Solution    Arc and angle between two lines. Linear dimensions can be used for circles in 
certain situations.
Add a note with a leader arrow.    In addition to dimensions, you’ll probably add lots of 
notes with arrows pointing to features in a design. AutoCAD offers the multileader for this 
purpose.
Master It    What two types of objects does the multileader combine?
Solution    Leader lines (arrowhead and line) and text.
Apply ordinate dimensions.    When accuracy counts, ordinate dimensions are often used 
because they measure distances that are similar to coordinates from a single feature.
Master It    What AutoCAD feature do you use for ordinate dimensions that aren’t strictly 
associated with dimensions?
Solution    UCS.
Add tolerance notation.    Mechanical drafting often requires the use of special notation 
to describe tolerances. AutoCAD offers some predefined symbols that address the need to 
include tolerance notation in a drawing.
Master It    How do you open the Geometric Tolerance dialog box?
Solution    Click the Tolerance tool in the Dimensions panel.
Chapter 12: Using Attributes
Create attributes.    Attributes are a great tool for storing data with drawn objects. You can 
include as little or as much data as you like in an AutoCAD block.
Master It    What is the name of the object that you must include in a block to store data?
Solution    Attribute definition.
Edit attributes.    The data that you include in a block is easily changed. You may have sev-
eral copies of a block, each of which must contain its own unique set of data.
Master It    What is the simplest way to gain access to a block’s attribute data?
Solution    Double-click the block to open the Enhanced Attribute Editor.
Extract and export attribute information.    Attribute data can be extracted in a number of 
ways so that you can keep track of the data in a drawing.
Master It    How do you start the data-extraction process?
Solution    Click the Extract Data tool in the Insert tab’s Linking & Extraction panel to 
open the Data Extraction Wizard.

Chapter 13: Copying Existing Drawings from Other Sources  |  971  
Chapter 13: Copying Existing Drawings  
from Other Sources
Convert paper drawings into AutoCAD files.    AutoCAD gives you some great tools that 
let you convert your paper drawings into AutoCAD files. Several options are available. 
Depending on your needs, you’ll find at least one solution that will allow you to convert your 
drawings quickly.
Master It    Describe the different methods available in AutoCAD for converting paper 
drawings into CAD files.
Solution    The methods are scaling directly from a drawing, scanning and converting 
with a third-party program, and scanning to a raster file that can then be imported into 
AutoCAD to be traced over.
Import a raster image.    You can use bitmap raster images as backgrounds for your CAD 
drawings, or as underlay drawings that you can trace over.
Master It    Import a raster image of your choice, and use the AutoCAD drawing tools to 
trace over your image.
Solution    Click Attach from the Insert tab’s Reference panel, or type Attach↵ to open 
the Select Reference File dialog box. Locate and select the raster image file that you want 
to import. Click Open to open the Attach Image dialog box and then click OK. Specify an 
insertion point and scale factor.
Work with a raster image.    Once imported, raster images can be adjusted for size, bright-
ness, contrast, and transparency.
Master It    Import a raster image of your choice, and fade the image so that it appears to 
blend into the background with less contrast.
Solution    Click a raster image’s border to expose the Image tab. Click and drag the Fade 
slider to the right so that it’s near the middle of the slider scale, or enter 50 in the Fade box 
to the right of the slider. Click OK. The raster image appears faded.
Work with PDF files.    AutoCAD allows you to import and control the display of PDF files. 
This is significant since the PDF file format is so prevalent in the business world.
Master It    In a PDF that includes layers, how do you gain access to the layer settings?
Solution    Click the imported PDF drawing, and then click the Edit Layers tool that ap-
pears in the PDF Underlay tab. You can then control layer visibility through the Underlay 
Layers dialog box.
Use a geolocation map.    You can include a correctly scaled background aerial view or 
road map of a site in your drawing to help you better coordinate your design with site 
conditions.
Master It    Name three types of information that you can use to find a site in the 
Geographic Location dialog box.
Solution    You can enter latitude/longitude, street addresses, or name of a site.

972  | Appendix A  The Bottom Line  
Chapter 14: Advanced Editing and Organizing
Use external references (Xrefs).    You’ve seen how you can use Xrefs to quickly build varia-
tions of a floor plan that contain repetitive elements. This isn’t necessarily the only way to use 
Xrefs, but the basic idea of how to use Xrefs is presented in the early exercises.
Master It    Try putting together another floor plan that contains nothing but the Unit2 
plan.
Solution    Replace the eight studio units in the Common.dwg file with four of the Unit2 plans.
Manage layers.    Once you start to edit complex drawings, you’ll find that you’ll want to 
save the On/Off or Freeze/Thaw layer states so that you can access parts of a drawing more 
easily. The Layer States Manager lets you save as many layer conditions as you may need in 
the course of a project.
Master It    What part of the Layer States Manager dialog box lets you control the layer 
properties that are affected by a saved layer state?
Solution    The Layer Properties To Restore group in the expanded view of the Layer 
States Manager.
Use advanced tools: Filter and Quick Select.    The Filter and Quick Select tools are great for 
isolating objects in a crowded drawing. You can select objects by their color or layer assign-
ment. You can select all instances of a specific block.
Master It    True or false: The Quick Select tool lets you select a set of objects to limit your 
selections.
Solution    True.
Use the QuickCalc calculator.    The QuickCalc calculator offers many standard calculator 
tools plus a few that you may not see in other calculators.
Master It    Name a few of the more unusual features offered by the QuickCalc calculator.
Solution    Add feet and inch lengths; find percentages of lengths; and obtain coordi-
nates, lengths, and angles graphically from a drawing.
Chapter 15: Laying Out Your Printer Output
Understand model space and paper space.    AutoCAD offers two viewing modes for view-
ing and printing your drawings. Model space is where you do most of your work; it’s the 
view that you see when you create a new file. Layouts, also called paper space, are views 
that let you arrange the layout of your drawing, similar to the way that you would in a page-
layout program.
Master It    What are three ways of moving from model space to paper space?
Solution    You can hover over the drawing tab above the drawing area to display the 
Model and Layout preview panels, or you can use the Model and Layout tabs in the low-
er-left corner of the drawing area. Finally, you can use the keyboard shortcuts Ctrl+PgUp 
or Ctrl+PgDn.

Chapter 16: Making “Smart” Drawings with Parametric Tools  |  973  
Work with paper space viewports.    While in paper space, you can create views in your 
drawing using viewports. You can have several viewports, each showing a different part of 
your drawing.
Master It    Name some of the ways that you can enlarge a view in a viewport.
Solution    You can double-click inside a viewport and then use the Zoom tools to enlarge 
the view. You can also use the Viewport Scale tool in the status bar to set the scale of the 
view.
Create odd-shaped viewports.    Most of the time, you’ll probably use rectangular viewports, 
but you have the option to create a viewport of any shape.
Master It    Describe the process for creating a circular viewport.
Solution    In paper space, draw a circle. Next, click Object from the Viewport flyout in 
the Layout tab’s Layout Viewports panel, and then follow the prompts.
Understand lineweights, linetypes, and dimensions in paper space.    You can get an accu-
rate view of how your drawing will look on paper by making a few adjustments to AutoCAD. 
Your layout view will reflect how your drawing will look when plotted.
Master It    Name the two dialog boxes that you must use to display lineweights in a lay-
out view.
Solution    You use the Layer Properties Manager (to set up lineweights) and the 
Lineweight Settings dialog box.
Chapter 16: Making “Smart” Drawings  
with Parametric Tools
Use parametric drawing tools.    Parametric drawing tools enable you to create an assembly 
of objects that are linked to each other based on geometric or dimensional properties. With 
the parametric drawing tools, you can create a drawing that automatically adjusts the size of 
all its components when you change a single dimension.
Master It    Name two examples given in the beginning of the chapter of a mechanical 
assembly that can be shown using parametric drawing tools.
Solution    The examples are a crankshaft and piston and a Luxo lamp.
Connect objects with geometric constraints.    You can link objects together so that they 
maintain a particular orientation to each other.
Master It    Name at least six of the geometric constraints available in AutoCAD.
Solution    The constraints are coincident, collinear, concentric, fix, parallel, perpendicu-
lar, horizontal, vertical, tangent, smooth, symmetric, and equal.
Control sizes with dimensional constraints.    Dimensional constraints, in conjunction with 
geometric constraints, let you apply dimensions to an assembly of objects to control the size 
of the assembly.
Master It    Name at least four dimensional constraints.

974  | Appendix A  The Bottom Line  
Solution    The dimensional constraints are linear, horizontal, vertical, aligned, radius, 
diameter, and angular. In addition, a tool allows you to convert a normal dimension into 
a dimensional constraint.
Use formulas to control dimensions.    Dimensional constraints allow you to link dimen-
sions of objects so that if one dimension changes, another dimension follows.
Master It    What example was used to show how formulas could be used with dimen-
sional constraints?
Solution    A circle’s diameter was linked to the width dimension of a drawing of a 
simple part.
Put constraints to use.    Constraints can be used in a variety of ways to simulate the behav-
ior of real objects.
Master It    Name at least three geometric or dimensional constraints used in the piston
.dwg sample file to help simulate the motion of a piston and crankshaft.
Solution    The geometric constraints used were horizontal, parallel, fix, and coincident. 
The dimensional constraints used were horizontal, vertical, aligned, and diameter.
Chapter 17: Using Dynamic Blocks
Work with the Block Editor.    To create dynamic blocks, you need to become familiar with 
the Block Editor. You can use the Block Editor to modify existing blocks in your drawing.
Master It    What does the Edit Block Definition dialog box allow you to do?
Solution    The Edit Block Definition dialog box lets you select the block that you want to 
edit from a list of blocks in the drawing.
Create a dynamic block.    A dynamic block is one to which you add grips so that you can 
modify the block in a number of ways.
Master It    Name some of the features of the Block Editor that let you add additional grip 
editing functions to a block.
Solution    Geometric constraints, dimensional constraints, parameters, and actions.
Add Scale and Stretch actions to a parameter.    You can set up a dynamic block to perform 
multiple operations with a single grip.
Master It    What do you need to do to have one grip perform two functions?
Solution    Use a single parameter to control two actions.
Add more than one parameter for multiple grip functions.    In addition to having one grip 
perform multiple operations, you can add as many grips as you need to make your block 
even more customizable.
Master It    What feature do you use to set up a list of options for a block?
Solution    The Block Table.
Create multiple shapes in one block.    Many of the dynamic block functions let you adjust 
the shape of the original block. Another feature lets you choose completely different shapes 
for the block.

Chapter 18: Drawing Curves |  975  
Master It    When a block uses the Visibility parameter to set up different shapes, how do 
you select a different block shape in the drawing?
Solution    Click the block, and then click the Visibility grip. A list appears showing the 
different shapes that are available.
Rotate objects in unison.    Blocks can be set up so that the action of one set of objects affects 
another set. This chapter gives the example of rotating objects in unison.
Master It    Name the dimensional constraint that was used in the object rotation example 
in this chapter.
Solution    Angular.
Fill in a space automatically with objects.    A dynamic block can help you automate the 
addition of repetitive elements to your drawing.
Master It    What is the name of the action used to produce copies of a block object at 
regular intervals in both the x- and y-axes when the block is stretched?
Solution    The Array action.
Chapter 18: Drawing Curves
Create and edit polylines.    Polylines are extremely versatile. You can use them in just about 
any situation where you need to draw line work that is continuous. For this reason, you’ll 
want to master polylines early in your AutoCAD training.
Master It    Draw the part shown here.
Insert a new
vertex here.
4.
Enter G here.
Start Straighten here.
Close after this point.
Start here.
3.
2.
1.

976  | Appendix A  The Bottom Line  
Solution    There are many ways to create this drawing, including using the following 
instructions:
	
1.	 Open a new file called PART14 using the acad.dwt template. Set the Snap spacing to 
0.25, and be sure that Snap mode is on. Use the Pline command to draw the object 
shown just before this step. Also, use the Units dialog box to change the units to 
Architectural. Start at the upper-left corner, and draw in the direction indicated by the 
arrows. Use the Close option to add the last line segment.
	
2.	 Start the Edit Polyline tool, select the polyline, and then type E↵ to issue the Edit 
Vertex option. Press ↵ until the X mark moves to the corner labeled “Start Straighten 
here.” Enter S↵ for the Straighten option.
	
3.	 At the Enter an option prompt, press ↵ twice to move the X to the other corner 
labeled “Enter G here” in step 2 of the drawing. Press G↵ for Go to straighten the poly-
line between the two selected corners.
	
4.	 Press ↵ three times to move the X to the upper-right corner, and then enter I↵ for Insert. 
Pick a point as shown in step 3 of the drawing. The polyline changes to reflect the new 
vertex. Enter X↵ to exit the Edit Vertex option, and then press ↵ to exit the Pedit command.
	
5.	 Start the Fillet command, use the Radius option to set the fillet radius to 0.30, and then 
use the Polyline option and pick the polyline that you just edited. All of the corners 
become rounded to the 0.30  radius. Add  the 0.15 radius circles, as shown in step 4 of 
the drawing, and exit and save the file.
Create a polyline spline curve.    Polylines can be used to draw fairly accurate renditions of 
spline curves. This feature of polylines makes them very useful AutoCAD objects.
Master It    Try drawing the outline of an object that contains no or few straight lines, as 
shown in the file lowerfairing.jpg, which is included in the Chapter 18 sample files. 
You can use the methods described in Chapter 13 to import a raster image of your object 
and then trace over the image using polyline splines.
Solution    Import a raster image by using the Attach tool in the Insert tab’s Reference 
panel. Use the Polyline tool to trace over the image. Use short, straight polyline segments 
while you trace. After you place the polyline, double-click it and select the Spline option. 
After you change the polyline to a spline curve, it may shift away from the original line 
over which you traced. Click the polyline, and then adjust the grips so that the line fits 
over the raster image.
Create and edit true spline curves.    If you need an accurate spline curve, you’ll want to 
use the Spline tool. Spline objects offer many fine-tuning options that you won’t find with 
polylines.
Master It    Try tracing over the same image from the previous “Master It” section, but 
this time use the Spline tool.
Solution    Import a raster image by using the Attach tool in the Insert tab’s Reference 
panel. Use the Spline tool to trace over the image. As you draw the spline, select control 
points that are close together for tighter curves. The closer the control points, the tighter 
you can make the curve. Notice that, unlike using a polyline spline, with this method you 
don’t have to readjust the curve after it’s been placed.

Chapter 19: Getting and Exchanging Data from Drawings |  977  
Mark divisions on curves.    The Divide and Measure tools offer a quick way to mark off 
distances on a curved object. This can be a powerful resource in AutoCAD that you may use 
often.
Master It    Mark off 12 equal divisions of the spline curve that you drew in the previous 
“Master It” exercise.
Solution    Choose Divide from the expanded Draw panel, click the spline, and then enter 
12↵. If you don’t see the points that mark off the divisions, type DDPTYPE↵, select the X 
point style, and click OK.
Chapter 19: Getting and Exchanging Data from Drawings
Find the area of closed boundaries.    There are a number of ways to find the area of a closed 
boundary. The easiest way is also perhaps the least obvious.
Master It    Which AutoCAD feature would you use to find the area of an irregular shape, 
such as a pond or lake, quickly?
Solution    Hatch.
Get general information.    A lot of information that is stored in AutoCAD drawings can tell 
you about the files. You can find out how much memory a file uses as well as the amount of 
time that has been spent editing the file.
Master It    What feature lets you store your own searchable information about a drawing 
file, and how do you get to this feature?
Solution    The Drawing Properties dialog box. You can open it by choosing Drawing 
Utilities ➢ Drawing Properties from the Application menu.
Use the DXF file format to exchange CAD data with other programs.    Autodesk created 
the DXF file format as a means of sharing vector drawings with other programs.
Master It    Name some of the versions of AutoCAD that you can export to using the Save 
As option.
Solution    2013, 2010, 2007, 2004, 2000, and R12.
Use AutoCAD drawings in page layout programs.    AutoCAD drawings find their way into 
all types of documents, including brochures and technical manuals. Users are often asked to 
convert their CAD drawings into formats that can be read by page layout software.
Master It    Name some file formats, by filename extension or type, that page layout pro-
grams can accept.
Solution    PDF (.pdf), WMF (.wmf), EPS (.eps), and a wide variety of bitmap image files.
Use OLE to import data.    You can import data into AutoCAD from a variety of sources. 
Most sources, such as bitmap images and text, can be imported as native AutoCAD objects. 
Other sources may need to be imported as OLE objects.
Master It    To link imported data to a source program through OLE, what dialog box 
would you use?
Solution    Paste Special.

Chapter 20: Creating 3D Drawings
Know the 3D Modeling workspace.    When you work in 3D, you need a different set of tools 
from those for 2D drafting. AutoCAD offers the 3D Modeling workspace, which provides the 
tools that you need to create 3D models.
Master It    Name some of the Ribbon panels that are unique to the 3D Modeling 
workspace.
Solution    Modeling, Mesh, Solid Editing, Primitive, Boolean, Section, Selection, Create, 
Edit, Control Vertices, Curves, Project Geometry, Analysis, Mesh Edit, Convert Mesh, 
Lights, Materials, Camera, and Render.
Draw in 3D using solids.    AutoCAD offers a type of object called a 3D solid that lets you 
quickly create and edit shapes.
Master It    What does the Presspull command do?
Solution    The command dynamically modifies objects by extrusion and offset. It can 
add to or subtract from a shape by extruding a defined area.
Create 3D forms from 2D shapes.    The Modeling panel offers a set of basic 3D shapes, but 
other tools enable you to create virtually any shape you want from 2D drawings.
Master It    Name the command that lets you change a closed 2D polyline into a 3D solid.
Solution    Extrude.
Isolate coordinates with point filters.    When you’re working in 3D, selecting points can be 
a complicated task. AutoCAD offers point filters or coordinates to let you specify the indi-
vidual x-, y-, and z-coordinates of a location in space.
Master It    What does the .XY point filter do?
Solution    The .XY point filter uses the X and Y coordinates of a selected object, allowing 
the user to enter an alternate Z value. It enables the user to use certain coordinates from 
existing objects without having to determine what those values are as well as negating 
the need for construction lines.
Move around your model.    Getting the view you want in a 3D model can be tricky.
Master It    Where is the drop-down list that lets you select a view from a list of pre-
defined 3D views?
Solution    Use the View command to select a predefined view. It appears in several 
places: in the top-left corner of the drawing area, in the View panel on the Home tab, and 
in the Views panel on the Visualization tab.
Get a visual effect.    At certain points in your model making, you’ll want to view your 3D 
model with surface colors and even material assignments. AutoCAD offers several ways to 
do this.
Master It    What are the steps to take to change the view from Wireframe to Conceptual?
Solution    Use the Visual Styles drop-down list. It can be found in the upper-left corner 
of the drawing area, in the View panel on the Home tab, or in the Visual Styles panel on 
the Visualization tab. Click the Visual Style drop-down, and select the Conceptual option.

Chapter 21: Using Advanced 3D Features |  979  
Turn a 3D view into a 2D AutoCAD drawing.    Sometimes, it’s helpful to convert a 3D 
model view into a 2D AutoCAD drawing. AutoCAD offers the Flatshot tool, which quickly 
converts a 3D view into a 2D line drawing.
Master It    What type of object does Flatshot create?
Solution    This tool creates a 2D representation of all 3D objects based on the current 
view in the form of a 2D block.
Chapter 21: Using Advanced 3D Features
Master the User Coordinate System.    The User Coordinate System (UCS) is a vital key to 
editing in 3D space. If you want to master 3D modeling, you should become familiar with 
this tool.
Master It    Name some of the predefined UCS planes.
Solution    Top, Bottom, Front, Back, Left, Right.
Understand the UCS options.    You can set up the UCS orientation for any situation. It isn’t 
limited to the predefined settings.
Master It    Briefly describe some of the ways that you can set up a UCS.
Solution    There are several ways to establish a UCS. You can orient the UCS by object. 
You can align the UCS with the face of an object, by a view, or about an axis. Whenever a 
UCS is created, it can be saved by giving it a name, and it can be recalled at any time. You 
can also choose the previous UCS used or return to World Coordinates. All of these can 
be set up with the UCS command.
Use viewports to aid in 3D drawing.    In some 3D modeling operations, it helps to have sev-
eral different views of the model through the Viewports feature.
Master It    Name some of the predefined standard viewports offered in the Viewports 
dialog box.
Solution    A single viewport, two viewports, three viewports, or four viewports are of-
fered. Each has combinations of vertical and horizontal arrangements, as well as a large 
viewport at the right, left, top, or bottom, along with smaller viewports on the opposite 
sides. The four viewport options can have four equal rectangles, or one large viewport 
with three equal viewports at the top, bottom, left or right.
Use the array tools.    The array tools—Rectangular, Path, and Polar Array—allow you to 
create 3D arrays dynamically.
Master It    What prompt in the Array command will allow you to have a 3D array?
Solution    The Levels prompt will create a 3D array.
Create complex 3D surfaces.    You aren’t limited to straight, flat surfaces in AutoCAD. You 
can create just about any shape that you want, including curved surfaces.
Master It    What tool did you use in this chapter’s butterfly chair exercise to convert a 
surface into a solid?
Solution    We used the Thicken tool to convert the surface into a solid.

980  | Appendix A  The Bottom Line  
Create spiral forms.    Spiral forms frequently occur in nature, so it’s no wonder that we 
often use spirals in our own designs. Spirals are seen in screws, stairs, and ramps as well as 
in other man-made forms.
Master It    Name the tools used in the example in the section “Creating Spiral Forms,” 
and name two elements that are needed to create a spiral.
Solution    The Helix tool and the Sweep tool. To make a helix, you need the following 
elements: number of turns, base radius, top radius, helix height, turn height, and the twist 
direction.
Create surface models.    You can create a 3D surface by connecting a series of lines that 
define a surface contour. You can create anything from a 3D landscape to a car fender using 
this method.
Master It    What is the tool used to convert a series of lines into a 3D surface?
Solution    The Loft tool will link a series of objects into a 3D surface.
Move objects in 3D space.    You can move objects in 3D space using tools that are similar to 
those for 2D drafting. But when it comes to editing objects, 3D modeling is much more com-
plex than 2D drafting.
Master It    What does the Rotate gizmo do?
Solution    The Rotate gizmo restrains an object’s rotation about the x-, y-, or z-axis to 
assist in properly rotating objects. It will allow you to rotate a 3D object in one axis at a 
time.
Chapter 22: Editing and Visualizing 3D Solids
Understand solid modeling.    Solid modeling lets you build 3D models by creating and join-
ing 3D shapes called solids. There are several built-in solid shapes called primitives, and you 
can create others using the Extrude tool.
Master It    Name some of the built-in solid primitives available in AutoCAD.
Solution    Box, Cylinder, Cone, Sphere, Pyramid, Wedge, Torus.
Create solid forms.    You can use Boolean operations to sculpt 3D solids into the shape you 
want. Two solids can be joined to form a more complex one, or you can remove one solid 
from another.
Master It    Name the three Boolean operations that you can use on solids.
Solution    Union, Subtract, Intersect.
Create complex solids.    Besides the primitives, you can create your own shapes based on 2D 
polylines.
Master It    Name three tools that let you convert closed polylines and circles into 3D 
solids.
Solution    Extrude, Sweep, Revolve.
Edit solids.    After you’ve created a solid, you can make changes to it using the solid-editing 
tools offered on the Solid Editing panel.

Chapter 23: Exploring 3D Mesh and Surface Modeling |  981  
Master It    Name at least four of the tools found on the Solid Editing panel.
Solution    Union, Subtract, Intersect, Interfere, Slice, Thicken, Extract Edges, Imprint, 
Color Edges, Copy Edges, Extrude Faces, Taper Faces, Move Faces, Copy Faces, Offset 
Faces, Delete Faces, Rotate Faces, Color Faces, Separate, Clean, Shell, Check.
Streamline the 2D drawing process.    You can create 3D orthogonal views of your 3D model 
to create standard 2D mechanical drawings.
Master It    What is the name of the tool in the expanded Section panel that lets you cre-
ate a 2D drawing of a 3D model?
Solution    Flatshot.
Visualize solids.    In addition to viewing your 3D model in a number of different orienta-
tions, you can view it as if it were transparent or cut in half.
Master It    What is the name of the command that lets you create a cut view of your 3D 
model?
Solution    Section Plane.
Chapter 23: Exploring 3D Mesh and Surface Modeling
Create a simple 3D mesh.    Mesh modeling allows you to create more organic 3D forms by 
giving you unique smoothing and editing tools. You can start your mesh model by creating a 
basic shape using the mesh primitives.
Master It    Name the seven mesh primitives available on the Primitives panel of the 
Mesh Modeling tab.
Solution    Mesh Box, Mesh Cone, Mesh Cylinder, Mesh Pyramid, Mesh Sphere, Mesh 
Wedge, Mesh Torus.
Edit faces and edges.    The ability to edit faces and edges is essential to creating complex 
shapes with mesh objects.
Master It    Name the tool that is used to divide a face into multiple faces.
Solution    Split Face.
Create mesh surfaces.    The Mesh primitives let you create shapes that enclose a volume. If 
you just want to model a smooth, curved surface in 3D, you might find the surface mesh tools 
helpful.
Master It    How many objects are needed to use the Edge Surface tool?
Solution    Four.
Convert meshes to solids.    You can convert a mesh into a 3D solid to take advantage of 
many of the solid-editing tools available.
Master It    Name at least two tools that you can use on a solid that you cannot use on a 
mesh.
Solution    Union, Subtract, Intersect, Slice, Thicken, Imprint, Interfere, Offset Edge, 
Solidedit.

982  | Appendix A  The Bottom Line  
Understand 3D surfaces.    3D surfaces can be created using some of the same tools you use 
to create 3D solids.
Master It    Name at least two tools that you can use to create both 3D solids and 3D 
surfaces.
Solution    Loft, Sweep, Extrude, Revolve.
Edit 3D surfaces.    AutoCAD offers a wide range of tools that are unique to 3D surfaces.
Master It    Name at least four tools devoted to CV editing.
Solution    Surface CV Show, Surface CV Hide, Surface Rebuild, Surface CV Add, Surface 
CV Remove, CV Edit Bar, Convert to NURBS.
Chapter 24: Customizing Toolbars, Menus, Linetypes, 
and Hatch Patterns
Use workspaces.    Often with AutoCAD, you find that you have different sets of panels or 
toolbars open to perform specific tasks. You might have one set of Ribbon panels for editing 
text and dimensions, whereas another set is more useful for design. Using workspaces is a 
great way to organize your different editing modes.
Master It    Where do you find the Customize option for workspaces?
Solution    The Workspace drop-down menu or the Workspace Switching tool.
Customize the user interface.    In addition to using workspaces to organize tools and 
Ribbon panels, you can customize the AutoCAD interface to make it fit the way you like to 
work. You can add tools to Ribbon panels, or you can even create your own tools for opera-
tions you perform frequently.
Master It    What does the Customizations In All Files group display?
Solution    Interface elements like toolbars, menus, Ribbon panels, and so on.
Create macros in tools and menus.    A macro is a set of instructions that performs more 
complex operations than single commands. Macros are often built on commands with addi-
tional predefined responses to help speed data input.
Master It    What does the ^C do in a macro?
Solution    The ^C is equivalent to pressing the Esc key.
Edit keyboard shortcuts.    Keyboard shortcuts can help improve your speed when drawing 
in AutoCAD. They can reduce several clicks of the mouse to a simple keystroke. AutoCAD 
lets you create custom shortcuts for your favorite commands.
Master It    What is the name of the feature that lets you record and playback actions?
Solution    Action Recorder.
Save, load, and unload your customizations.    To keep your customizations organized, you 
can save new toolbars, menus, and Ribbons as files that you can load on demand. When you 
save your custom elements as a file, you can move them to other computers. In addition, you 
can use the cloud to synchronize your custom settings with other computers.

Chapter 25: Managing and Sharing Your Drawings |  983  
Master It    Name the feature that lets you synchronize your custom settings from a cloud 
source.
Solution    Autodesk® 360.
Understand the DIESEL macro language.    If you’re adventurous, you may want to try your 
hand at creating more complex macros. The DIESEL macro language is an easy introduction 
to AutoCAD macro customization, and it is most useful in controlling the behavior in menu 
options.
Master It    What does the expression $(getvar, Blipmode) do?
Solution    It returns 1 or 0 depending on the current state of the Blipmode system 
variable.
Create custom linetypes.    AutoCAD offers a number of noncontinuous linetypes, and you 
may find them adequate for most of your work. But every now and then, you may need a spe-
cific linetype that isn’t available. Creating custom linetypes is easy when you understand the 
process.
Master It    What is the purpose of a negative value in the linetype code?
Solution    A blank or break in the line.
Create hatch patterns.    Like linetypes, the hatch patterns provided by AutoCAD will prob-
ably fill most of your needs. But every now and then you may need to produce a specific 
pattern.
Master It    How are a hatch pattern code and a linetype code similar?
Solution    They both use numeric values to describe lines.
Chapter 25: Managing and Sharing Your Drawings
Share drawings online.    As a drafter or designer, you’ll likely be involved in collaborative 
efforts, which means that you’ll have to share your work with others. The Internet has made 
it much easier to do this.
Master It    Why is eTransmit important for sending AutoCAD drawings over the 
Internet?
Solution    An AutoCAD drawing can have many different external files associated with 
it, such as fonts, Xrefs, and image files. eTransmit offers a quick way to gather these files 
into one place or into a single archive file.
Publish your drawings.    Autodesk offers the PDF drawing format, which lets non-CAD 
users view and add comments to simplified versions of your drawings. You can use the 
Publish feature to create a single PDF file from several drawings.
Master It    True or false: The Publish feature can be used to plot multiple drawings in the 
background.
Solution    True.
Get started with A360 Drive.    A360 Drive makes sharing files and exchanging design ideas 
much easier.

984  | Appendix A  The Bottom Line  
Master It    Name the feature that lets you revert a revised drawing to its prior state.
Solution    Versions.
Manage your drawings with DesignCenter and the tool palettes.    DesignCenter is a 
great tool for managing your drawings’ resources, like blocks, custom linetypes, and other 
elements.
Master It    True or false: DesignCenter has the capacity to scale a block automatically to 
the correct size when moving from metric to Imperial drawings.
Solution    True.
Establish office standards.    AutoCAD allows for a wide range of settings in a drawing. For 
this reason, it’s a good idea to create standards for the way drawings are set up.
Master It    Name the filename extension for an AutoCAD drawing standards file.
Solution    .dws.
Convert multiple layer settings.    If you exchange files with another office, you may find 
that their layer scheme is different than yours. AutoCAD offers the Layer Translator to help 
you translate layer names from an unfamiliar drawing to names with which you’re more 
comfortable.
Master It    Name the filename extensions of the types of files that you can use as a tem-
plate for layer name translations.
Solution    .dwg, .dws, and .dwt.

Appendix B
Installing and Setting Up AutoCAD 
This appendix gives you information about installing Autodesk® AutoCAD® 2017 software on 
your system and describes the system parameters that you should set to configure AutoCAD 
to meet the needs of your operating environment. Throughout this appendix, the system vari-
able associated with a setting, when available, is included at the end of an option description, 
enclosed in brackets. System variables are settings that enable you to control the behavior of 
AutoCAD when you’re using commands and features. You’ll find a detailed description of  
the AutoCAD system variables on the AutoCAD 2017 Help website.
Before Installing AutoCAD
Before you begin the installation process, be sure that you have at least 6 GB of free disk space. 
You should also have at least an additional 100 MB of free disk space for AutoCAD temporary 
files and swap files, plus another 20 MB for the tutorial files that you’ll create. AutoCAD will 
work with Microsoft Windows 7, 8, or 10. AutoCAD also works with Internet Explorer 11, Google 
Chrome v33, Mozilla Firefox v19, and Apple Safari v5.1.
For 2D work, you’ll also need a dual-core processor with at least 2 GB of RAM and a video 
card that supports at least 1366´768 resolution and True Color.
For serious 3D work, Autodesk recommends at least 8 GB of RAM, 6 GB of free disk space 
(not including the AutoCAD installation), and a 128 MB or greater Direct3D-capable workstation- 
class graphics card. Autodesk has a list of certified graphics cards for 3D modeling. This list is 
always being updated, so check the Autodesk website for the latest information.
Single-user systems have a 30-day grace period, so you can install and use AutoCAD without 
entering an authorization code right away. You can authorize your installation over the Internet 
at any time within the 30-day grace period as indicated when you first start AutoCAD. The trial 
software available on the Autodesk website can’t be authorized unless you purchase a license, so 
be sure to have a good block of free time to study AutoCAD before you install it.
Proceeding with the Installation
AutoCAD 2017 installs like most other Windows programs, but you should know a few things 
before you start.
Installing AutoCAD is straightforward. AutoCAD uses an installation wizard like most other 
Windows programs. Here are some guidelines to follow during the installation process:
◆
◆
Before you start, make sure that you have enough disk space, and also make sure that no 
other programs are running. If you purchased a license, you’ll need your AutoCAD serial 

986  | Appendix B  Installing and Setting Up AutoCAD   
number and product key, which are usually on the package label. If you’re installing the 
trial version from the Autodesk website, select the “I want to try this product for 30 days” 
option on the Product Information page of the installation wizard.
◆
◆
Typically, the AutoCAD installation program starts automatically when you double-click 
on the installation file. After the program launches, follow the directions in the installation 
wizard.
If you have an earlier release of AutoCAD installed on your PC, you will see the Migrate 
Custom Settings dialog box when you first start up AutoCAD 2017. This dialog box enables you 
to import custom settings selectively from your prior AutoCAD release. If you do not want to 
import settings, you can click the Cancel button in the dialog box.
Configuring AutoCAD
In the following sections, you’ll learn how to configure AutoCAD to work in the way you that 
want it to function. You can configure AutoCAD at any time during an AutoCAD session by 
using the Options dialog box.
The exercises in this book assume that you’re using the default Options settings. As you 
become more familiar with the workings of AutoCAD, you may want to adjust the way that 
AutoCAD works by using the Options dialog box. You can also set many of the options in the 
Options dialog box through system variables.
Choose Options from the Application menu, or type options↵ at the Command prompt 
to open the Options dialog box, which has the tabs and settings described in the following 
sections.
Many of the options in the Options dialog box show an AutoCAD file icon. This icon indi-
cates that the option’s setting is saved with individual files instead of being saved as part of the 
default AutoCAD settings. Other options, such as the User Profiles and command alias settings, 
can be exported or imported using the Migrate Custom Settings feature. This feature can be 
found in the Windows Start menu under All Programs ➢ Autodesk ➢ AutoCAD 2017 ➢ Migrate 
Custom Settings.
The Files Tab
You use the options on the Files tab (see Figure B.1) to tell AutoCAD where to place or find the 
files that it needs to operate. It uses a hierarchical list, similar to the one presented by Windows 
File Explorer. You first see the general topics in the Search Paths, File Names, and File Locations 
list box. You can expand any item in the list by clicking its plus sign.
The following are descriptions of each item in the list box. Chances are that you won’t have to 
use most of them, but you may change others occasionally.
When available, the related system variable is shown in brackets at the end of the description.
Support File Search Path    AutoCAD relies on external files for many of its functions. 
Menus, text fonts, linetypes, and hatch patterns are a few examples of features that rely on 
external files. The Support File Search Path item tells AutoCAD where to look for these files. 
You can add folder paths to this listing by selecting it, clicking the Add button, and enter-
ing a new path, or you can select it and use the Browse button. It’s probably not a good idea 
to delete any of the existing items under this heading unless you really know what you’re 
doing.

Configuring AutoCAD |  987  
If you’re familiar with using environment variables, you can include them in the search 
paths.
Working Support File Search Path    The Working Support File Search Path item contains a 
read-only list of the support file search paths for the current session, together with any spe-
cial settings that may be included with command switches and environment settings.
Trusted Locations    Data security has become an increasingly important feature for 
Autodesk software. The Trusted Locations option lets you set a location on your system 
where you keep files that contain trusted executable code. See the Security group under the 
System tab for related information.
Device Driver File Search Path    The Device Driver File Search Path item locates the device 
drivers for AutoCAD. Device drivers are applications that enable AutoCAD to communicate 
directly with printers, plotters, and input devices. In most cases, you don’t have to do any-
thing with this setting.
Project Files Search Path    Eventually, a consultant or other AutoCAD user will provide 
you with files that rely on Xrefs or raster images. Often, such files expect the Xref or raster 
image to be in a particular folder. When they are moved to another location with a different 
folder system, Xref-dependent files won’t be able to find their Xrefs. The Project Files Search 
Path item enables you to specify a folder where Xrefs or other dependent files are stored. If 
AutoCAD is unable to find an Xref or other file, it will look in the folder that you specify in 
this listing.
To specify this folder, highlight Project Files Search Path and then click the Add button. 
AutoCAD suggests Project1 as the folder name. You can change the name if you prefer. Click 
Figure B.1
The Files tab

988  | Appendix B  Installing and Setting Up AutoCAD   
the plus sign next to Project1, and then click Browse to select a location for your project file 
search path. The project file search path is stored in a system variable called Projectname.
Customization Files    If you’re customizing AutoCAD with your own menu files and icons, 
you can use this setting to locate your files. This option makes it convenient to keep your cus-
tomization files in a place that is separate from the built-in AutoCAD files. You can specify a 
location for the main customization files like your CUI menu files, enterprise customization 
files for files you want to share, and your custom icons.
Help And Miscellaneous File Names    This item lets you set the location of a variety of sup-
port files, including menu, help, automatic save, log, and configuration files. If you have a net-
work installation, you can also set the License Manager location on your network.
Text Editor, Dictionary, And Font File Names    Use this item to set the location of the text 
editor [Mtexted], custom and main dictionaries [Dctmain, Dctcust], and the alternate font 
and font-mapping files [Fontalt]. Chapter 9, “Adding Text to Drawings,” describes these 
tools in more detail.
Print File, Spooler, And Prolog Section Names    You can specify a print filename other than 
the default that is supplied by AutoCAD whenever you plot to a file. The Spooler option lets 
you specify an application intended to read and plot a plot file. The Prolog option is intended 
for PostScript export. It lets you specify the Prolog section from the acad.psf file that you 
want AutoCAD to include with exported Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) files [Psprolog].
Printer Support File Path    Several support files are associated with the AutoCAD printing 
and plotting system. This item enables you to indicate where you want AutoCAD to look for 
these files.
Automatic Save File Location    You can indicate the location for the Automatic Save file in 
AutoCAD by using this item [Savefilepath].
Color Book Locations    This item lets you specify the locations for the PANTONE color 
books. This is an optional installation item, so if the PANTONE color books aren’t installed, 
you can install them through your AutoCAD 2017 Installation DVD.
PDF Import Image Location    This item lets you specify the location where you want to 
store image files from imported PDFs.
Data Sources Location    This item lets you specify the location for Open Database 
Connectivity (ODBC) data-link files for linking AutoCAD drawings to database files.
Template Settings    When you select the Use A Template option in the Create New Drawing 
dialog box, AutoCAD looks at this setting for the location of template files. You can modify 
this setting, but chances are you won’t need to.
Tool Palettes File Locations    This item lets you specify a location for the resource files for 
your custom tool palettes. When you create custom palettes, AutoCAD stores its data regard-
ing those palettes in this location.
Authoring Palette File Locations    If you’re creating custom dynamic blocks, you can desig-
nate a folder location where you keep your custom block settings and files.
Log File Location    With this item, you can indicate where log files are to be placed [Logfilepath].
Action Recorder Settings    The Action Recorder saves action macros as files on your com-
puter. You can specify the location of those saved macros in this option.

Configuring AutoCAD |  989  
Plot And Publish Log File Location    With this item, you can indicate where plot and pub-
lish log files are to be placed [Logfilepath].
Temporary Drawing File Location    AutoCAD creates temporary files to store portions of 
your drawings as you work on them. You usually don’t have to think about these temporary 
files unless they start crowding your hard disk or unless you’re working on a particularly 
large file on a system with little memory. This item lets you set the location for temporary 
files. The default location is the C:\Users\User Name\appdata\local\temp\ folder (User 
Name is your login name). If you have a hard disk that has lots of room and is very fast, 
you may want to change this setting to a location on that drive to improve performance 
[Tempprefix, read-only].
Temporary External Reference File Location    If you’re on a network and you foresee a situ-
ation where another user will want to open an Xref of a file on which you’re working, you 
can set the Demand Load Xrefs setting in the Open And Save tab to Enabled With Copy. This 
causes AutoCAD to make and use a copy of any Xref that is currently loaded. This way, oth-
ers can open the original file. The Temporary External Reference File Location item lets you 
specify the folder where AutoCAD stores this copy of an Xref [Xloadpath].
Texture Maps Search Path    This item specifies the location for AutoCAD Render texture 
maps. In most cases, you won’t have to change this setting. You can, however, add a folder 
name to this item for your own texture maps as you acquire or create them.
Web File Search Path    Although you may think this is for Internet files, it’s really for photo-
metric web files that are used to control the way lights behave in 3D models. These files have 
an .ies filename extension. See Bonus Chapter 6, “Rendering 3D Drawings,” available at 
www.omura.com/chapters, for more about using these files.
i-drop Associated File Location    This is where you specify the location of files imported 
to your computer through the i-drop function in AutoCAD. By default, no location is speci-
fied, so the i-drop imported DWG file is placed in the same folder location as the current 
drawing.
DGN Mapping Setup Locations    You can specify the location for the DGNsetup.ini file, 
which is a file used for DGN commands. Using these commands, you can import or export 
DGN files. You can also control the translation of layers, linetypes, lineweights, and color 
between the AutoCAD DWG file format and the DGN file format.
While in AutoCAD, you may want to find the location of a resource file quickly, such as a log 
file or the Automatic Save file. You can do so by using the system variable associated with the 
resource. For example, to find the location of the log file path quickly, enter logfilepath↵ at the 
Command prompt. For the Automatic Save file, enter savefilepath↵. Autodesk® AutoCAD LT® 
users can employ the Modemacro command as in Modemacro↵$(getvar,logfilepath)↵ or Mode
macro↵$(getvar,savefilepath)↵. See Chapter 24, “Customizing Toolbars, Menus, Linetypes, and 
Hatch Patterns,” for more on Modemacro.
The Display Tab
The settings on this tab (see Figure B.2) let you control the appearance of AutoCAD. You can 
make AutoCAD look completely different with these settings if you choose. Scroll bars, fonts, 
and colors are all up for grabs.

990  | Appendix B  Installing and Setting Up AutoCAD   
The Window Elements Group
These options control the general settings for AutoCAD windows:
Color Scheme    Lets you select between a dark or light color scheme for the AutoCAD inter-
face, including toolbars, Ribbon panels, and dialog boxes.
Display Scroll Bars In Drawing Window    Lets you turn the scroll bars on and off. If you 
have a small monitor with low resolution, you may want to disable the scroll bars for a larger 
drawing area.
Use Large Buttons For Toolbars    Controls whether large icon buttons are used in toolbars.
Resize Ribbon Icons To Standard Sizes    When Ribbon icons do not match the standard 
sizes, they can be scaled to match the small (16´16) or large (32´32) default pixel size.

Configuring AutoCAD |  991  
Colors    Opens a dialog box that lets you set the color for the various components of the 
AutoCAD window. This is where you can change the background color of the drawing area if 
you find that black doesn’t work for you.
Fonts    Opens a dialog box that lets you set the fonts of the AutoCAD window. You can select 
from the standard set of Windows fonts available in your system.
The Display Resolution Group
These options control the way objects are displayed in AutoCAD. You can choose between dis-
play accuracy and speed:
Arc And Circle Smoothness    Controls the appearance of arcs and circles, particularly when 
you zoom in on them. In some instances, arcs and circles appear to be octagons even though 
they plot as smooth arcs and circles. If you want arcs and circles to appear smoother, you can 
increase this setting. An increase also increases memory use [Viewres].
Segments In A Polyline Curve    Controls the smoothness of polyline curves. Increase the 
value to make curved polylines appear smoother and less segmented. Decrease the value for 
improved display performance [Splinesegs].
Rendered Object Smoothness    Controls the smoothness of curved solids when they’re ren-
dered or shaded. Values can range from 0.01 to 10 [Facetres].
Contour Lines Per Surface    Lets you set the number of contour lines used to represent solid, 
curved surfaces. Values can range from 0 to 2047 [Isolines].
The Layout Elements Group
These options control the display of elements in the Paper Space Layout tabs. See Chapter 8, 
“Introducing Printing, Plotting, and Layouts,” and Chapter 15, “Laying Out Your Printer 
Output,” for more information. Most of these options are self-explanatory. The Show Page Setup 
Manager For New Layouts option opens the Page Setup Manager dialog box whenever a layout 
is first opened. The Create Viewport In New Layouts option automatically creates a viewport in 
a layout when it’s first opened.
The Display Performance Group
You can adjust a variety of display-related settings in this group:
Pan And Zoom With Raster & OLE    Controls the way raster images react to real-time pans 
and zooms. If this option is selected, raster images move with the cursor. Deselect this option 
for better performance [Rtdisplay].
Highlight Raster Image Frame Only    Determines how raster images appear when selected. 
Select this option for better performance [Imagehlt].
Apply Solid Fill    Controls the display of filled objects such as wide polylines and areas 
filled with the solid hatch pattern. This option is also controlled by the Fillmode system 
variable. Deselect this option for better performance.
Show Text Boundary Frame Only    Controls the way text is displayed. Select this option to 
display text as rectangular boundaries [Qtextmode].

992  | Appendix B  Installing and Setting Up AutoCAD   
Draw True Silhouettes For Solids And Surfaces    Controls whether surface meshes for solid 
models are displayed. Deselect this option for better performance [Dispsilh].
The Crosshair Size Group
This slider controls the size of the crosshair cursor. You can set it to 100 percent to simulate the 
full-screen crosshair cursor of earlier versions of AutoCAD [Cursorsize].
The Fade Control Group
These two sliders control the fade effect on external references. The Xref Display option sets the 
overall fade effect [Xdwgfadectl]. The In-Place Edit And Annotative Representations option 
controls the display of nonselected objects during in-place reference editing. See Chapter 7, 
“Mastering Viewing Tools, Hatches, and External References,” for more information on in-place 
reference editing [Xfadectl].
The Open And Save Tab

of the automatic save and the default file version for the Save and Save As options.
Figure B.3
The Open And Save tab
The File Save Group
You can control how AutoCAD saves files by using the options in this group:
Save As    Lets you set the default file type for the Save and the Save As Application menu 
options. If you’re working in an environment that requires Release 14 files as the standard file 

Configuring AutoCAD |  993  
type, for example, you can use this option to select Release 14 as the default file type. You can 
also set up AutoCAD to save DXF files by default.
Maintain Visual Fidelity For Annotative Objects    Ensures that annotative scale is pre-
served in layouts when you save drawings to earlier versions of AutoCAD. If you work pri-
marily in Model Space, leave this setting off [Savefidelity].
Maintain Drawing Size Compatibility    AutoCAD 2017 has no restrictions on object size. 
This option ensures that restrictions are applied in case you want to save your file to an ear-
lier version [Largeobjectsupport].
Thumbnail Preview Settings    Lets you determine whether a preview image is saved with a 
drawing. Preview images are used in the AutoCAD file dialog box and in DesignCenter™ to 
let you preview a file before opening it [Rasterpreview]. You can also control the display of 
the sheet set preview [Updatethumbnail].
Incremental Save Percentage    Controls the degree to which the Incremental Save feature 
is applied when a file is saved. An incremental save improves the time required to save a file 
to disk, but it also makes the file size larger. If you have limited disk space, you can set this 
value to 25. A value of 0 turns off Incremental Save altogether but reduces AutoCAD perfor-
mance [Isavepercent].
The File Safety Precautions Group
These options control the automatic backup features in AutoCAD:
Automatic Save    Offers control over the Automatic Save features. You can turn it on or off 
by using the check box or set the frequency at which files are saved by using the Minutes 
Between Saves box. You can set the location for the Automatic Save files by using the 
Automatic Save File Location item in the Files tab of the Options dialog box. You can also 
set the frequency of automatic saves through the Savetime system variable [Savefilepath, 
Savefile].
Create Backup Copy With Each Save    Lets you determine whether a BAK file is saved 
along with every save you perform. You can deselect this option to conserve disk space 
[Isavebak, Tempprefix].
Full-Time CRC Validation    Controls the cyclic redundancy check feature, which checks for 
file errors whenever AutoCAD reads a file. This feature is helpful in troubleshooting hard-
ware problems in your system.
Maintain A Log File    Lets you record the data in the AutoCAD Text Window. See Chapter 19, 
“Getting and Exchanging Data from Drawings,” for more on this feature. You can set the 
location for log files in the Files tab of the Options dialog box [Logfilemode, Logfilename].
File Extension For Temporary Files    Lets you set the filename extension for AutoCAD tem-
porary files. These are files AutoCAD uses to store drawing data temporarily as you work 
on a file. If you’re working on a network where temporary files from multiple users may be 
stored in the same folder, you may want to change this setting to identify your temporary 
files.
Digital Signatures    Opens the Digital Signatures dialog box, in which you can add a digital 
signature. See Chapter 25, “Managing and Sharing Your Drawings,” for more on this feature 
[Digitalsign].

994  | Appendix B  Installing and Setting Up AutoCAD   
Display Digital Signature Information    When a file containing a digital signature is 
opened, this option will display a warning message alerting you to the presence of the signa-
ture [Sigwarn]. See Chapter 25 for more on the digital signature feature.
The File Open Group
You can control how AutoCAD displays filenames in the File menu or the drawing title bar:
Number Of Recently-Used Files    Lets you specify the number of files listed in the File 
menu history list. The default is 9, but you can enter a value from 0 to 50.
Display Full Path In Title    Controls whether the full path is included in the title bar with a 
drawing’s name.
The Application Menu Group
This option controls the number of recently used files that are displayed in the Application menu.
The External References (Xrefs) Group
These options let you control memory and layer features of Xrefs:
Demand Load Xrefs    Lets you turn on the Demand Load feature of Xrefs. Demand Load 
helps to improve the performance of files that use Xrefs by loading only those portions of an 
Xref drawing that are required for the current open drawing. This option has a drop-down 
list with three choices: Disabled turns off demand loading, Enabled turns on demand load-
ing, and Enabled With Copy turns on demand loading by using a copy of the Xref source file. 
This last option enables others on a network to edit the Xref source file while you’re working 
on a file that also uses it [Xloadctl].
Retain Changes To Xref Layers    Lets you save layer settings of Xref files in the current 
drawing. This doesn’t affect the source Xref file. With this setting turned off, the current file 
imports the layer settings of the Xref file when it loads that file [Visretain].
Allow Other Users To Refedit Current Drawing    Lets you specify whether others can simul-
taneously edit a file that you’re editing. This option is intended to enable others to use the Xref 
And Block Editing option (the Refedit command or the Edit Reference tool found on the Insert 
tab’s expanded Reference panel) on files that you currently have loaded in AutoCAD [Xedit].
The ObjectARX Applications Group
AutoCAD allows users and third-party developers to create a custom object that usually 
requires the presence of a custom ObjectARX ® application to support it. These options control 
the way AutoCAD treats custom objects and their related ObjectARX applications:
Demand Load ObjectARX Apps    This option controls when a supporting third-party appli-
cation is loaded if a custom object is present in a file. This option offers several settings that you 
can select from a drop-down list. The available settings are Disable Load On Demand, Custom 
Object Detect, Command Invoke, and Object Detect And Command Invoke. Disable Load 
On Demand prevents AutoCAD from loading third-party applications when a custom object 
is present. Some standard AutoCAD commands won’t work if you select Disable Load On 
Demand because AutoCAD itself uses ObjectARX applications. Custom Object Detect causes 
AutoCAD to load an ARX application automatically if a custom object is present. Command 

Configuring AutoCAD |  995  
Invoke loads a custom application when you invoke a command from that application. The 
Object Detect And Command Invoke option loads an ARX application either when a custom 
object is present or if you invoke a command from that application [Demandload].
Proxy Images For Custom Objects    Offers a drop-down list with three settings that control 
the display of custom objects when the objects supporting ARX applications aren’t present 
on your system. Do Not Show Proxy Graphics turns off the display of custom objects. Show 
Proxy Graphics displays the custom objects. Show Proxy Bounding Box shows a bounding 
box in place of a custom object [Proxyshow].
Show Proxy Information Dialog Box    Lets you determine whether the Show Proxy Information 
warning dialog box is used. When this option is selected, the Show Proxy Information warn-
ing appears when a drawing with custom objects is opened but AutoCAD can’t find the 
objects’ associated ARX application [Proxynotice].
The Plot and Publish Tab
The Plot And Publish tab in the Options dialog box offers settings related to printing and plot-
ting. See Chapter 8 for a description of these options.
The System Tab
The options in the System tab (see Figure B.4) offer control over some of the general AutoCAD 
interface settings, such as settings for display drivers and pointing devices.

panel option will display the Touch Ribbon panel. This panel offers the Select Mode tool, which 
enables you to cancel the current command.
The Layout Regen Options Group
With this set of radio buttons you can specify how regens are applied when you are working 
with layout tabs:
Regen When Switching Layouts    Causes AutoCAD to force a regen when you select a lay-
out tab or the Model tab. Use this option when your computer is limited in RAM.
Cache Model Tab And Last Layout    Causes AutoCAD to suppress regens when you switch 
to the Model tab or the most recently opened layout tab. Other layouts will regen when 
selected.
Cache Model Tab And All Layouts    Causes AutoCAD to suppress regens when you select 
any layout tab or the Model tab.
The General Options Group
This set of check boxes lets you set options related to the general operation of AutoCAD:
Hidden Messages Settings    A number of dialog boxes offer the “Do not show me again” 
option. If you select it and later find that you would like to see the dialog box again, you can 
use this button to view the message.

input error.
Allow Long Symbol Names    Enables you to use long names for items such as layers, blocks, 
linetypes, and text styles. With this option turned on, you can enter as many as 255 charac-
ters for names [Extnames].
The Help Group
AutoCAD uses a web-based help system. If for some reason you do not have web access, 
you can install help files using the AutoCAD 2017 installation tools. The Access Online 
Content When Available option should be deselected after help files have been  
installed.
The InfoCenter Group
This group contains just one button: Balloon Notifications. This button opens the InfoCenter 
Settings dialog box, which gives you control over the behavior of the InfoCenter feature, includ-
ing balloon notifications, the Product Support information channel, and the Did You Know 
messages.
The Security Group
The Security Options button in this group opens the Security Options dialog box, where you 
can set restrictions on how executable files are loaded [Securityoptions].
The dbConnect Options Group
The check boxes in this group offer controls over the dbConnect feature:
Store Links Index In Drawing File    Lets you specify where database link data is stored. If 
this check box is selected, link data is stored in the drawing that is linked to a database. This 
increases file size and file-loading time.
Open Tables In Read-Only Mode    Lets you limit access to database files.
The User Preferences Tab
The options in the User Preferences tab (see Figure B.5) enable you to adjust the way AutoCAD 
reacts to user input.

998  | Appendix B  Installing and Setting Up AutoCAD   
The Windows Standard Behavior Group
These settings let you control how AutoCAD reacts to keyboard accelerators and mouse 
right-clicks:
Double Click Editing    Controls whether a double-click on an object automatically starts an 
editing command for the object. If this option is turned off, double-clicking objects has no 
effect [Dblclkedit].
Shortcut Menus In Drawing Area    Lets you see the context menu when you right-
click. When this check box isn’t selected, AutoCAD responds to a right-click with a ↵ 
[Shortcutmenu].
Right-Click Customization    Opens the Right-Click Customization dialog box (see 
Figure B.6), which offers further options for the behavior of the right-click in AutoCAD. 
The Turn On Time-Sensitive Right-Click option causes AutoCAD to respond differ-
ently depending on whether you right-click quickly or hold the right mouse button 
down momentarily. With this option, a rapid right-click issues an ↵—as if you pressed 
the Enter key. If you hold down the right mouse button, the context menu appears. You 
can further adjust the time required to hold down the mouse button by modifying this 
setting.

selected, all the grips in the set of objects in a group are displayed [Groupdisplaymode].
Show Bounding Box On Groups    Displays a bounding box around a selected group 
[Groupdisplaymode].
Object Selection Limit For Display Of Grips    Controls the display of grips based on the 
number of objects selected. If this is set to 1, grips aren’t displayed if more than one object is 
selected. You can select a range from 1 to 32,767. The default is 100 [Gripobjlimit].
The Preview Group
These options let you control the behavior of the selection preview when you hover over objects 
or when you are using a command. Click the Visual Effect Settings button to fine-tune the 
visual effects of the object selection, including the color and pattern of Autoselect windows 
and which entities to exclude [Selectionpreview]. The Command preview toggle determines 
whether the result of a command is displayed before you commit to the command. The Property 
Preview toggle determines whether you see a live view of property changes when rolling over 
drop-down lists and galleries.
The Profiles Tab
In Windows, a user profile is saved for each login name. Depending on the login name you use, 
you can have a different Windows setup. The Profiles tab (see Figure B.14) offers a similar func-
tion for AutoCAD users. You can store different settings from the Options dialog box in a profile 
and recall them at any time. You can also save them to a file with the .arg filename extension and 
then take that file to another system. It’s a bit like being able to take your Options settings with 
you wherever you go.
Figure B.14
The Profiles tab

1010  | Appendix B  Installing and Setting Up AutoCAD   
The main part of the Profiles tab displays a list of available profiles. The default profile is 
shown as <<Unnamed Profile>>. As you add more profiles, they appear in the list.
To create a new profile, highlight a profile name from the list that will be the template for the 
new profile, and then click Add To List. The Add Profile dialog box opens, where you can enter 
a profile name and a description of the profile. The description appears in the box below the list 
on the Profiles tab whenever that profile is selected.
After you’ve created a new profile, you can modify the settings on the other tabs of the 
Options dialog box and the new settings will be associated with the new profile. Profiles 
store the way menus are set up, so you can use them as an aid to managing both your own 
custom schemes and third-party software. Here is a brief description of the options on the 
Profiles tab:
Set Current    Installs the settings from the selected profile
Add To List    Creates a new profile
Rename    Lets you rename a profile and change its description
Delete    Removes the selected profile from the list
Export    Lets you save a profile to a file
Import    Imports a profile that has been saved to a file
Reset    Resets the values for a selected profile to its default settings
The Online Tab
Autodesk A360® is a feature that allows you to store drawings and AutoCAD settings in a 
secure, online location known as A360 Drive. The Online tab enables you to determine the level 
to which you intend to use A360 Drive. This tab doesn’t show any options until you sign in to 
your A360 Drive account using the Sign In option in the AutoCAD InfoCenter. Once signed in, 
you will see the options in the Online tab, shown in Figure B.15.
Figure B.15
The Online tab

Configuring the Tablet Menu Area |  1011  
There is one main setting on the Online tab: Sync My Settings With The Cloud. With the 
Sync My Settings With The Cloud option turned on, you can have all of your AutoCAD settings 
saved to the cloud, or you can select a set of options to be saved.
If you’d like to learn more about Autodesk 360, see “Sharing Files with A360 Drive” in Chapter 25.
Configuring the Tablet Menu Area
If you own a digitizing tablet and would like to use it with a Tablet menu template, you must 
configure your Tablet menu. Install your Tablet menu into AutoCAD using the Menuload com-
mand, and then do the following:
	
1.	 Securely fasten your Tablet menu template to the tablet. Be sure that the area covered by 
the template is completely within the tablet’s active drawing area.
	
2.	 Type Options, and then select the System tab.
	
3.	 In the Current Pointing Device group, select Wintab Compatible Digitizer ADI 4.2 – By 
Autodesk, Inc. from the drop-down menu and then make sure that the Digitizer And 
Mouse radio button is selected.
	
4.	 Click Apply and then click OK to close the dialog box.
	
5.	 Type Tablet↵Cfg↵. The following prompt appears:
Enter number of tablet menus desired (0–4) <0>:
Enter the number of tablet areas your menu uses and then press ↵. For the next series of 
prompts, you’ll be locating the Tablet menu areas, starting with Menu Area 1. Figure B.16 
shows an example of how to locate the Tablet menu areas for the legacy AutoCAD Tablet menu.

6.	 Follow the instructions provided by the command-line interface.
	
7.	 When you’re asked if you want to respecify the fixed screen pointing area, enter Y↵ and 
then select the corners of the pointing area as indicated by the prompts.
Turning On the Noun/Verb Selection Method
If for some reason the Noun/Verb Selection method isn’t available, follow these steps to turn it on:
	
1.	 Choose Options from the Application menu. Then, in the Options dialog box, click the 
Selection tab.
	
2.	 In the Selection Modes group, click the Noun/Verb Selection check box.
	
3.	 Click OK.
You should now see a small square at the intersection of the crosshair cursor. This square 
is an object selection cursor superimposed on the point selection cursor. It tells you that you 
can select objects, even while the Command prompt appears at the bottom of the screen and 
no command is currently active. As you saw earlier, the square momentarily disappears when 
you’re in a command that asks you to select points.
You can also turn on the Noun/Verb Selection method by entering ’Pickfirst↵ at the Type a 
command prompt. At the Enter new value for PICKFIRST <0>: prompt, enter 1↵. (Entering 0 
turns off the Pickfirst function.) The Pickfirst system variable is stored in the AutoCAD con-
figuration file.
Turning On the Grips Feature
If for some reason the Grips feature isn’t available, follow these steps to turn it on:
	
1.	 Choose Options from the Application menu. Then, in the Options dialog box, click the 
Selection tab.
	
2.	 In the Grips group, click the Show Grips check box.
	
3.	 Click OK, and you’re ready to proceed.
The Selection tab of the Options dialog box also lets you specify whether grips appear on 
objects that compose a block (see Chapter 4 for more on blocks) as well as set the grip color and 
size. You can also set these options by using the system variables.
You can also turn the Grips feature on and off by entering ’Grips↵. At the Enter new value 
for GRIPS <0>: prompt, enter 1 or 2 to turn grips on or 0 to turn grips off. Option 2 turns on 
grips and displays additional midpoint grips on polyline line segments. The Grips system vari-
able is stored in the AutoCAD configuration file.
Setting Up the Tracking Vector Feature
If AutoCAD doesn’t display a tracking vector as described in the early chapters of this book or if the 
tracking vector doesn’t behave as described, chances are this feature has been turned off or altered. 
Take the following steps to configure the tracking vector so that it behaves as described in this book:
	
1.	 Open the Options dialog box by choosing Options from the Application menu.
	
2.	 Click the Drafting tab.

Adjusting the AutoCAD 3D Graphics System |  1013  
	
3.	 Click all three options in the AutoTrack Settings group.
	
4.	 Make sure that the Marker, Magnet, and Display AutoSnap Tooltip check boxes are 
selected in the AutoSnap Settings group.
	
5.	 Make sure that the Automatic radio button in the Alignment Point Acquisition group is 
selected.
	
6.	 Click OK to exit the dialog box.
Adjusting the AutoCAD 3D Graphics System
You can adjust the performance of the 2D and 3D graphics system in AutoCAD using the 
Graphics Performance dialog box (see Figure B.17). To open this dialog box, click the System 
tab in the Options dialog box and then click the Graphics Performance button in the Hardware 
Acceleration group.
Figure B.17
Tuning graphics 
performance

1014  | Appendix B  Installing and Setting Up AutoCAD   
This dialog box lets you turn on hardware acceleration for your graphic display. If you find 
that the AutoCAD display is not working properly, you can turn off hardware acceleration. This 
dialog box also offers control over the way AutoCAD displays 3D modeling features. Note that 
some PCs may not be equipped with the hardware required for hardware acceleration.
Finding Folders That Contain AutoCAD Files
Many AutoCAD features rely on external files to store settings and other resources. Many of 
these files reside in folders that are difficult to find. These folders are as follows:
C:\Users\User Name\AppData\Local\Autodesk\AutoCAD 2017\R21.0\enu
C:\Users\User Name\AppData\Roaming\Autodesk\AutoCAD 2017\R21.0\enu
When you’ve located these folders, you may want to create a shortcut to them (right-click the 
folder, and choose Create Shortcut). Place the shortcut on your desktop or other convenient loca-
tion. That way, you can get to them without having to navigate through several layers of folders.
Setting Up AutoCAD with a White Background
As mentioned in the beginning of Chapter 2, “Creating Your First Drawing,” the 2D screen 
shots in this book are shown with a white background instead of the default dark gray. This 
is intended to help keep the figures legible in the printed version of this book. You can easily 
set up your AutoCAD to display the 2D drawing area in the same way by taking the following 
steps:
	
1.	 Open the Application menu, and select Options near the bottom of the menu. You can 
also type Options↵ in the Command window.
	
2.	 Select the Display tab in the Options dialog box.
	
3.	 Click the Colors button in the Windows Elements group.
	
4.	 In the Drawing Window Colors dialog box, make sure that 3D Parallel Projection is 
selected in the Context settings and that Uniform Background is selected in the Interface 
Elements settings.
	
5.	 From the Color drop-down list, select white.
	
6.	 Select Grid Major Lines in the Interface Element list.
	
7.	 In the Color drop-down list, click the Select Color option. In the Select Color dialog box, 
click the Index Color tab and enter 253 in the Color box. Click OK.
	
8.	 Select Grid Minor Lines in the Interface Element list.
	
9.	 In the Color drop-down list, click the Select Color option. In the Select Color dialog box, 
click the Index Color tab and enter 254 in the Color box. Click OK.
	
10.	 Click Apply & Close in the Drawing Window Colors dialog box, and then click OK in the 
Options dialog box.
