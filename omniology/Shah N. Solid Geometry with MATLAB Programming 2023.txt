Preface
Solid geometry is applied to analyze, predict and calculate the volume,
location, and surface area of all the objects in the three-dimensional space.
Its fundamental use is for deﬁning three-dimensional real-life objects.
The authors have designed the book following the signiﬁcance of the
subject in day-to-day life and the challenges students face to learn Solid
Geometry. The book is formulated not only for students of bachelor level
but also for all levels coherently with ample examples. The content includes
both generic and advanced topics of Solid Geometry.
It is a handy reference book and will serve as a fundamental resource for
advanced-level studies. The book can aid learning’s in various ﬁelds such as
engineering, interior designing, and architecture.
Unlike many competitive books in the market, this book involves MAT-
LAB programming. Authors have avoided unnecessary information and
diverting topics, providing a lucid and informative explanation for theoretical
aspects. The book has seven chapters, out of which the ﬁrst six chapters
include basics, applications, and advanced level of topics. The seventh chap-
ter focuses entirely on programming through MATLAB, which gives this
book a touch of uniqueness.
The author is hopeful that this book will sufﬁce the requirement of
elementary knowledge to students and learners from diverse genres. It is a
one-stop platform to understand solid geometry for beginners. The author
welcomes suggestions for improvements and observed errors.

Plane
1.1 Deﬁnition
A locus is a plane such that if any two points P and Q are on the locus then
every point of the line PQ lies on the locus.
1.2 General Equation of the First Degree in x, y, z
Represents a Plane
Let the ﬁrst-degree equation of the plane in x, y, z be ax + by + cz + d = 0,
where a, b and c are given nonzero real numbers i.e., a2 + b2 + c2 ̸= 0.
Theorem: Every equation of the ﬁrst degree in x, y, z represents the a plane.
Proof: Let us consider the ﬁrst-degree equation in x, y, z.
ax + by + cz + d, a2 + b2 + c2 ̸= 0.
(1.1)
Let P (x1, y1, z1), and Q (x2, y2, z2) be two points on the locus, so we get
ax1 + by1 + cz1 + d = 0,
(1.2)
ax2 + by2 + cz2 + d = 0.
(1.3)
Multiplying Equation (1.2) by m and adding to Equation (1.1), we get
a (x1 + mx2) + b (y1 + my2) + c (z1 + mz2) + d (1 + m) = 0,
∴a

+ d = 0.
Suppose m + 1 ̸= 0. i.e., m ̸= −1, which clearly shows that the point
x1 + mx2
1 + m
, y1 + my2
1 + m , z1 + mz2
1 + m

Plane
is a point on the locus for every value of m ̸= −1.
Thus, we have proved that if P (x1, y1, z1) , and Q (x2, y2, z2) lies on
(1.1) then every point R of the line joining P and Q lies on (1.1).
i.e., Every point on the straight line joining any two arbitrary points on
the locus also lies on the locus.
∴The given Equation (1.1) represents a plane.
i.e., The general equation of the ﬁrst degree in x, y, z represents a plane.
Converse: (Normal form)
The equation of every plane is of the ﬁrst degree.
i.e., of form ax + by + cz + d = 0 where a2 + b2 + c2 ̸= 0.
Proof: Let us consider any plane and P be the length of the perpendicular
from the origin to the plane and l, m, n be the direction cosines of this
perpendicular.
We shall prove that for any point (x, y, z) on the plane, we have the
relation
lx + my + nz = p.
i.e., The equation of the plane is of the ﬁrst degree.
Let Q be the foot of the perpendicular from the origin O to the plane.
Let OQ = p and l, m, n be its direction cosines.
Let P (x, y, z) be any point on the plane.
∴PQ lies in the plane.
⇒PQ⊥OQ
⇒The projections of OP on OQ = OQ = p.

1.3 Transformation of General form to Normal Form
3
Also, the projection of the segment OP joining the points O (0, 0, 0) and
P (x, y, z) on the line OQ with direction cosines l, m, n is
l (x −0) + m (y −0) + n (z −0) = lx + my + nz,
i.e., lx+my+nz = p which satisﬁes the coordinates of any point P (x, y, z)
on the given plane.
∴This equation is the equation of the plane.
Remark:
1) An equation lx + my + nz = p is in the normal form if
1.1 (coefﬁcient of x)2+ (coefﬁcient of y)2+ (coefﬁcient of z)2 = 1
i.e., l2 + m2 + n2 = 1.
1.2 constant term on the R.H.S. is positive, i.e., p > 0.
2) If the plane passes through the origin (0,0,0) then d = 0 and equation of
a plane passing through the origin is ax + by + cz + d = 0.
3) Equation of any plane parallel to the plane ax+by +cz +d = 0 is given
by ax + by + cz + d1 = 0.
1.3 Transformation of General form to Normal Form
To transform the equation
ax + by + cz + d = 0; a2 + b2 + c2 ̸= 0,
(1.4)
to the normal form
lx + my + nz = p.
(1.5)
Equations (1.4) and (1.5) represent the same plane so comparing the
coefﬁcient we get
a
l = b
m = c
n = −d
p ,
∴l = −pa
d ; m = −pb
d ; n = −pc
d .
l, m, and n are direction cosines of the normal to the plane
∴l2 + m2 + n2 = 1
∴p2a2 + p2b2 + p2c2 = d2
∴p2 =
d2
a2+b2+c2
∴p = ±
d
√
a2+b2+c2 .

4
Plane
Case (i): If d is positive then p is also positive
i.e., p =
d
√
a2+b2+c2 ,
∴l =
−a
√
a2+b2+c2 ; m =
−b
√
a2+b2+c2 and n =
−c
√
a2+b2+c2 .
Substituting the values of l, m, and n in (1.5), we get ax + by + cz = d.
Case (ii): If d is negative then p is always positive
∴p =
−d
√
a2+b2+c2 ,
∴l =
a
√
a2+b2+c2 ; m =
b
√
a2+b2+c2 and n =
c
√
a2+b2+c2.
Substituting the values of l, m and n in (1.4), we get ax + by + cz + d = 0.
Remark:
To reduce general form to normal form
1) Shift the constant term to R.H.S. and make it positive (if it is not)
2) Divide throughout by
√
a2 + b2 + c2.
1.4 Direction Cosines of the Normal to a Plane
The direction cosines of the normal to a plane are proportional to the
coefﬁcients of x, y, z in the equation.
∴a, b, c are direction ratios of the normal to the plane ax+by+cz+d = 0.
1) If the axes are rectangular and P is the point (2, 3, −1) ﬁnd the equation
to the plane through P at right angles to OP.
Sol. Given O (0, 0, 0) and P (2, 3, −1)
∴Direction ratios of OP are 2 −0, 3 −0, −1−0.
i.e., Direction ratios of OP are 2, 3, −1.
∴The equation of the plane is 2x + 3y −z + d = 0.
Since the plane passes through point P(2, 3, −1), we get
2 (2) + 3 (3) −(−1) + d = 0
∴d = −14.
∴The required equation of the plane is 2x + 3y −z −14 = 0.

1.5 Equation of a Plane Passing through a Given Point
5
1.5 Equation of a Plane Passing through a Given Point
Let the equation of a plane in general form be
ax + by + cz + d = 0,
(1.6)
and let it passes through the point (x1, y1, z1) .
i.e., Equation (1.6) will become
ax1 + by1 + cz1 + d = 0.
(1.7)
Subtracting (1.7) from (1.6), we get
a (x1 −x) + b (y1 −y) + c (z1 −z) = 0.
2) Find the ratios in which the coordinate planes divide the line joining
(−2, 4, 7) and (3, −5, 8).
Sol. Let R be the point which divides P (−2, 4, 7) and Q (3, −5, 8) in the
ratio m = 1.
∴Coordinates of R are

3m−2
m+1 , −5m+4
m+1 , 8m+7
m+1

.
(a) If R lies on the XY plane i.e., z = 0, we have 8m+7 = 0 ⇒m = −7
8 .
∴XY plane divides PQ externally in the ratio 7 : 8.
(b) If R lies on the Y Z plane i.e., x = 0, we have 3m−2
m+1 = 0 ⇒m = 2
3.
∴Y Z plane divides PQ internally in the ratio 2:3.
(c) If R lies on the ZX plane i.e., y = 0, we have −5m+4
m+1
= 0 ⇒m = 4
5.
∴ZX plane divides PQ internally in the ratio 4:5.
3) Find the equation of the plane through the points (1, −2, 4) and (3, −4, 5)
and parallel to the x axis.
Sol. Let the equation of the plane parallel to the x axis be
by + cz + d = 0.
(1.8)
Since it passes through the points (1, −2, 4) and (3, −4, 5), we get
−2b + 4z + d = 0,
(1.9)
−4b + 5z + d = 0.
(1.10)
Solving Equations (1.9) and (1.10), we get b = −d
6 and c = −2d
6
Substituting the values of b and c in Equation (1.9), we get −d
6 y −dz
6 +d = 0.

6
Plane
∴y + 2z −6 = 0 is the required equation of the plane.
4) Find the equation of the plane that passes through (2, −3, 1) and is
perpendicular to the line joining the points (3, −4, 1) and (2, −1, 5).
Sol. The equation of the plane passing through the point (2, −3, 1) is
a (x −2) + b (y + 3) + c (z −1) = 0
(1.11)
The direction ratios of the line joining points P (3, 4, −1) and Q (2, −1, 5)
are x1 −x2, y1 −y2, z1 −z2 = 1, 5, −6.
The required equation of the plane is perpendicular to the line PQ.
∴The normal to the plane (1.11) whose direction ratios are a, b, c is parallel
to PQ whose direction ratios are 1, 5, −6.
∴a
1 = b
5 =
c
−6 = t.
Substituting a, b, and c in Equation (1.11), we get
t (x −2) + 5t (y + 3) −6t (x −1) = 0
∴x −2 + 5y + 15 −6z + 6 = 0
∴x + 5y + 6z + 19 = 0
is the required equation of the plane.
1.6 Equation of the Plane in Intercept Form
Let ABC be a plane intersecting the coordinate axes OX, OY, OZ at A, B,
and C respectively, and let OA = a, OB = b, and OC = c.

1.7 Reduction of the General Equation of the Plane to the Intercept Form
7
Then the coordinates of A, B, C
are (a, 0, 0), (0, b, 0) and (0, 0, c)
respectively.
Let the equation of the plane be
Px + Qy + Rz + S = 0.
(1.12)
Since it passes through point A (a, 0, 0) , we get
P (a) + Q (0) + R (0) + S = 0
∴P = −S
a .
Similarly, the plane passes through points C (0, b, 0) and D (0, 0, c) so
Q = −S
b
and R = −S
c
.
Substituting values of P, Q, and R in Equation (1.12), we get
−S
a x −S
b y −S
c z + S = 0
∴x
a + y
b + z
c = 1
is the required equation of the plane in the intercept form.
Remark:
If the plane passes through the origin, then S = 0, and the equation cannot
be expressed in intercept form.
1.7 Reduction of the General Equation of the Plane to the
Intercept Form
Let the general equation of the plane by
ax + by + cz + d = 0
(1.13)
Dividing Equation (1.13) by (−d), we get
ax
−d + by
−d + cz
−d = 1,
∴
x
−d
a +
y
−d
b +
z
−d
c = 1.
which is of the form
x
A + y
B + z
C = 1,
(1.14)

8
Plane
where A = −d
a , B = −d
b , and C = −d
c are the lengths of the intercepts of
(1.13) on the axes respectively.
The Equation (1.14) is the intercept form of the general Equation (1.13).
5) A variable plane moves so that the sum of reciprocals of its intercepts on
the three co-ordinates axes is constant. Show that it passes through a ﬁxed
point.
Sol. Let the variable plane be
x
a + y
b + z
c = 1.
(1.15)
∴a, b, and c are the intercepts on the axes.
Given 1
a + 1
b + 1
c = constant = 1
t . (Suppose)
∴t
a + t
b + t
c = 1.
(1.16)
∴The Equation (1.16) shows that (t, t, t) satisﬁes Equation (1.15) of the
plane.
i.e., plane (1.15) passes through the ﬁxed point (t, t, t).
6) A plane meets the coordinate axes at A, B, C such that the centroid of the
triangle ABC is the point (a, b, c). Show that the equation of the plane is
x
a + y
b + z
c = 3.
Sol. Let the equation of the plane be
x
r + y
s + z
t = 1.
(1.17)
It meets the axes in A (r, 0, 0) , B (0, s, 0) , and C (0, 0, t) .
Let the centroid G
of the ΔABC be
 r+0+0
3
, 0+s+0
3
, 0+0+t
3

=
 r
3, s
3, t
3

.
But it is given that the centroid of ΔABC is (a, b, c).
∴r
3 = a ⇒r = 3a, s
3 = b ⇒s = 3b, t
s = c ⇒t = 3c
Substituting the values of r, s, t in (1.17), we get
x
3a + y
3b + z
3c = 1

1.7 Reduction of the General Equation of the Plane to the Intercept Form
9
∴x
a + y
b + z
c = 3
is the required equation of the plane.
7) A variable plane is at a constant distance p from the origin and meets the
axes in A, B, C. Through A, B, C planes are drawn parallel to the coordinate
planes. Prove that the locus of their point of intersection is
1
x2 + 1
y2 + 1
z2 = 1
p2 .
Sol. Let the variable plane at distance p from the origin be
lx + ny + nz = p,
(1.18)
where l, m, n are the direction cosines of the normal to the plane.
The plane (1.18) meets the x axis (i.e., y = 0, z = 0), we get lx = p ⇒

(1.62)
and
a2x + b2y + c2z + d2 = 0,
(1.63)
where d1, d2 are both positive.
1. If the origin lies in the acute angle between the planes, then θ is obtuse
i.e., cos θ is negative or a1a2 + b1b2 + c1c2 is negative.
2. If the origin lies in the obtuse angle between the planes the angle θ is
acute i.e., cos θ is positive or a1a2 + b1b2 + c1c2 is positive.

1.14 Two Sides of a Plane
To determine a criterion for two given points to lie on the same or different
sides of a given plane.
Let P (x1, y1, z1) and Q (x2, y2, z2) be two points that lie on the same or
different sides of the plane
ax + by + cz + d = 0,
(1.64)
according to the expressions
ax1 + by1 + cz1 + d and ax2 + by2 + cz2 + d,
are of the same sign or different signs.
Let the line PQ meet the given plane at R in the ratio m = 1 then the
coordinates of R are

∴m (ax2 + by2 + cz2 + d) + (ax1 + by1 + cz1 + d) = 0
∴m = −
ax1 + by1 + cz1 + d
ax2 + by2 + cz2 + d

.
Case (i): If ax1 + by1 + cz1 + d and ax2 + by2 + cz2 + d are of opposite
signs then m is positive.
∴The plane (1.64) divides PQ internally in the ratio m : 1.

Combining (1.67) and (1.68), the perpendicular distance formula is
d = ± (lx1 + my1 + nz1 −p) .

Remark:
1) Of these two bisecting planes, one bisects the acute and the other the
obtuse angle between the planes.
2) The bisector of the acute angle makes with either of the planes an angle
which is less than 45 and the bisector of the obtuse angle makes with
either of them an angle which is greater than 45.

(a) If a1a2 + b1b2 + c1c2 < 0 then θ is obtuse then the angle between
the planes is (π −θ) must be acute.
i.e., Origin must lie in the acute angle made by the planes.
(b) If a1a2 + b1b2 + c1c2 > 0 then θ is acute then the angle between
the planes is (π −θ) will be obtuse.
i.e., Origin must lie in the obtuse angle made by the planes.
If d1 and d2 are both positive, the origin will be in the acute or
obtuse angle between the planes a1x + b1y + c1 + d1 = 0 and
a2x + b2y + c2z + d2 = 0.
i.e., a1a2 + b1b2 + c1c2 < or > 0.
31) Determine whether the origin lies inside the acute or obtuse angle formed
by the planes x −2y + 3z −5 = 0 and 2x −y −z + 3 = 0.
Sol. Rewriting the equations of planes to make constant terms positive, we
get

1.17 Pair of Planes
To ﬁnd an equation that will be satisﬁed if and only if a point lies on either of
the two planes. i.e., either on one plane or the other or both.
Let the equations of two planes be
P1 : ax + by + cz + d = 0,
and
P2 : a1x + b1y + c1z + d1 = 0
then any point on P1 = 0 or P2 = 0 will also satisfy P1P2 = 0.
∴P1P2 = 0 is the equation of a pair of planes representing two planes
P1 = 0 and P2 = 0.
i.e., (ax + by + cz + d) (a1x + b1y + c1z + d1) = 0
Let point (x1, y1, z1) lie on P1.
⇒ax1 + by1 + cz1 + d = 0
∴(ax1 + by1 + cz1 + d) (a1x + b1y + c1z + d1) = 0
Let point (x1, y1, z1) lie on P2.
⇒a1x1 + b1y1 + c1z1 + d1 = 0

32
Plane
∴(ax1 + by1 + cz1 + d) (a1x1 + b1y1 + c1z + d1) = 0
⇒the Point lies on P1P2 = 0
i.e., ax1 + by1 + cz1 + d = 0 or a1x1 + b1y1 + c1z1 + d1 = 0
⇒(x1, y1, z1) lies on P1 or P2.
Thus, a point (x, y, z) either lies on the plane P1 or the plane P2.
∴(ax + by + cz + d) (a1x + b1y + c1z + d1) = 0 is the equation of
two planes, which is the general equation of second degree in x, y, z.
To ﬁnd the condition that a homogeneous equation of second degree in
x, y, z may represent a pair of planes: Let homogeneous second-degree
equation in x, y, z be given by
ax2 + by2 + cz2 + 2fyz + 2gzx + 2hxy = 0.
Let it represents two planes
l1x + m1y + n1z = 0
l2x + m2y + n2z = 0
∴ax2 + by2 + cz2 + 2fyz + 2gzx + 2hxy = (l1x + m1y + n1z)
(l2x + m2y + n2z) .
Now equating coefﬁcients, we get
l1l2 = a, m1m2 = b, n1n2 = c, l1m2 + l2m1 = 2h, m1n2 + m2n1 = 2f
and n1l2 + n2l1 = 2g.
The required condition is essentially the condition for the consistency

which is the required sufﬁcient condition.
i.e., If the equation ax2 + by2 + cz2 + 2fyz + 2gzx + 2hxy = 0 represents
two planes, we have the condition
abc + 2fgh −af2 −by2 −ch2 = 0.
Let abc + 2fgh −af2 −bg2 −ch2 = 0 holds.
Now, the given equation can be expressed in terms of x as
x =
−(gz + hy) ±
	
(gz + hy)2 −a (by2 + cz2 + 2fyz)
a
; a ̸= 0.
Now, if the given condition is satisﬁed, then the expression under the radical
sign must be a perfect square. So, the given homogeneous equation can be
expressed as a product of two linear equations, and hence it will represent a
pair of planes.
Corollary: Angle between planes:
If θ be the angle between the planes represented by the equation
ax2 + by2 + cz2 + 2fyz + 2gzx + 2hxy = 0
we have if l1l2 + m1m2 + n1n2 ̸= 0 then

θ = 90 or cos θ = 0 or a + b + c = 0.
2) If θ = 0 or 180, tan θ = 0 then f2 + g2 + h2 = ab + bc + ca, and then
the two planes are parallel.

Sol. The given equation is 12x2−2y2−6z2−2xy+7yz+6zx = 0 comparing
with ax2 + by2 + cz2 + 2fyz + 2gzx + 2hxy = 0 we get,
a = 12, b = −2, c = −6, 2f = 7, 2g = 6, 2h = −2
Condition for the homogeneous second-degree equation to represent a
pair of planes is
abc + 2fgh −af2 −bg2 −ch2 = 0.
∴12x2 −2y2 −6z2 −2xy + 7yz + 6zx = 0 represents a pair of planes.
Let θ be the angle between

1.18 Orthogonal Projection on a Plane
The foot of the perpendicular from a point to a given plane is called the
orthogonal projection of the point on the plane. The plane on which we

the plane of any point on the curve.
2) The projection on a given plane of the area enclosed by a plane curve is
the area enclosed by the projection of the curve on the plane.
3) The projection of a straight line on a given plane is the locus of the feet

2) If a segment AB is parallel to the plane of projection, then the length of
the projection is the same as that of AB.
3) The projection of the area A, enclosed by a curve in a plane is A cos θ
where θ is the angle between the plane of the curve containing the given
area and the plane of projection.

Straight Line
2.1 Representation of Line (Introduction)
A straight line may be generated by the intersection of two non-parallel
planes. So, the general equation of a straight line is given by the combined
equations of two planes as given by
a1x + b1y + c1z + d1 = 0
and a2x + b2y + c2z + d2 = 0; provided a1
a2
̸= b1
b2
̸= c1
c2
.
Remark:
1) A straight line is also called a right line.
2) The x axis is the intersection of the XZ and XY planes, y = 0 and
z = 0 taken together are its equation. Similarly, x = 0, z = 0 are the
equations of the y axis, and x = 0, y = 0 are the equations of the z
axis.
2.2 Equation of a Straight Line in the Symmetrical Form
To ﬁnd the equations of the line passing through a given point A (x1, y1, z1)
and having direction cosines l, m, n:
Let A (x1, y1, z1) be the ﬁxed point on a straight line and P (x, y, z) be
any given point on the given line and let AP = r.
Let l, m, n be the direction cosines of this line. Assuming projections of
AP on the coordinate axes, we get
x −x1 = lr; y −y1 = mr and z −z1 = nr
(2.1)
∴x −x1
l
= y −y1
m
= z −z1
n
= r

Straight Line
which is the equation of a straight line in symmetrical form.
The coordinates (x, y, z) of any points on the line is given by
x = x1 + lr ; y = y1 + mr and z = z1 + nr
i.e., (x1 + lr, y1 + mr, z1 + nr) ; r ϵ R
If l ̸= 0, m ̸= 0, n ̸= 0 or equivalently lmn ̸= 0,
x −x1
l
= y −y1
m
= z −z1
n
are the two required equations of the line.

2) (0, 0, 0) is the ﬁxed point on the axes and the respective direction cosines
of the axes are (1, 0, 0) , (0, 1, 0) and (0, 0, 1).
2.3 Equation of a Straight Line Passing through Two
Points
To ﬁnd the equations of the line through two points A (x1, y1, z1) and
B (x2, y2, z2):
The direction ratios of the line AB are x2 −x1, y2 −y1 , z2 −z1
∴The required equations of the line AB are
x −x1
x2 −x1
= y −y1
y2 −y1

B(0, 2, 8) be
x −x1
x2 −x1

z2 −z1
∴x −1

and x + 1
5

be
given by
a (x −1) + b (y + 6) + c (z + 1) = 0
(2.4)
where
3a + 4b + 2c = 0.
(2.5)
Since the plane (2.4) is parallel to the line
x −2
2
= y −1
−3
= z + 4
5
⇒2a −3b + 5c = 0
(2.6)
By solving Equations (2.5) and (2.6), we get a
26 =
b
−11 =
c
−17
Substituting the values of a, b, and c in Equation (2.4), we get
26 (x −1) −11 (y + 6) −17 (z + 1) = 0
∴26x −11y −17z = 109.

(2.7)
is given by (−2k + 3, 3k −1, −4k + 2).
Let this point be the foot of the perpendicular of the line drawn from the
pint (−1, 1, −3) on the line (2.7).
∴The direction ratios of the perpendicular line are given by
−2r + 3 + 1; 3r −1 −1; −4r + 2 + 3
i.e., (−2r + 4, 3r −2, −4r + 5)
The required line is perpendicular to (2.7),
∴−2 (−2r + 4) + 3 (3r −2) −4 (−4r + 5) = 0
∴4r −8 + 9r −6 + 16r −20 = 0
∴29r = 34

2.4 Transformation from the Unsymmetrical to the
Symmetrical Form
Let the equation of a straight line be given by
a1x + b1y + c1z + d1 = 0,
(2.8)
a2x + b2y + c2z + d2 = 0.
(2.9)
To transform these equations to the symmetrical form we require
1) The direction ratios of the line and
2) The coordinates of any one point on it.
If (l, m, n) be the direction cosines of the line, since this line is perpendicular
to both the normals to the planes (2.8) and (2.9), we get
a1l + b1m + c1n = 0
a2l + b2m + c2n = 0
⇒
l

.
Now we require the coordinates of any one point on the line and there is an
inﬁnite number of points from which we can choose.
Let us ﬁnd the point of intersection of the line with the plane z = 0.
Since this point lies on the planes (2.8) and (2.9), we get
a1x + b1y + d1 = 0 and a2x + b2y + d2 = 0

Similarly, the direction ratios of the line (2.18) are a1, c1, 1.
Since the given lines are perpendicular
l1l2 + m1m2 + n1n2 = 0

and the plane ax + by + cz + d = 0:
The angle between a line and a plane is the complement of the angle
between the line and the normal to the plane.
Since the direction cosines of the normal to the given plane and of the

and 3x + y + z = 7.
Here (2) (3) + (3) (1) + (6) (1) = 15 ̸= 0.
∴The line is not parallel to the plane.
Also, 2

So, the line is not normal to the plane.

n
(= k) ,
(2.19)
and
ax + by + cz + d = 0.
(2.20)
The coordinates of any points on the line (2.19) can be written as
(x1 + lk, y1 + mk, z1 + nk) .
(2.21)
If this point lies on the plane (2.20) then
a (x1 + lk) + b (y1 + mk) + c (z1 + nk) + d = 0
∴k = −ax1 + by1 + cz1 + d
al + bm + cn
.

2.7 Conditions for a Line to Lie in a Plane
55
Substituting the value of k in (2.21) we get the coordinates of that point where
the line meets the plane.
Remark:
If the line (2.19) is parallel to the plane (2.20) then al + bm + cn = 0 and
hence, we get no ﬁnite value of k. So, there are inﬁnite points of intersection.

n
(2.22)
to lie in the plane
ax + by + cz + d = 0.
(2.23)
The line (2.22) entirely lies on the plane (2.23) if and only if every point of
the line is a point of the plane, i.e., the point (lk + x1, mk + y1, nk + z1) lies
on the plane for all values of k .

56
Straight Line
∴Equation (2.23) becomes,
a (x1 + lk) + b (y1 + mk) + c (z1 + nk) + d = 0
∴(ax1 + by1 + cz1 + d) + k (al + bm + cn) = 0
⇒al + bm + cn = 0
ax1 + by1 + cz1 + d = 0

which are the required two conditions.
Remark:
Geometrically these conditions state that a line lies in a given plane if
1) The normal to the plane is perpendicular to the line and
2) Any one point of the line lies in the plane

(2.29)
where A, B, C are not all zero satisfying the condition
Al1 + Bm1 + Cn1 = 0
(2.30)
The plane (2.29) will contain the line (2.27) if
(a) the point (x2, y2, z2) lies on it
i.e., A (x2 −x1) + B (y2 −y1) + C (z2 −z1) = 0
(2.31)
(b) the line is perpendicular to the normal to the plane
i.e., Al2 + Bm2 + Cn2 = 0.
(2.32)
Two lines will be coplanar if the three linear homogeneous Equations (2.30),

Sufﬁcient condition:
Two lines are coplanar if and if they intersect or are parallel.
Let us ﬁrst consider the case of intersection.
The general coordinates of the points on the lines (2.26) and (2.27)
respectively for all values of k1 and k2 is given by
(l1k1 + x1, m1k1 + y1, n1k1 + z1) ,
and
(l2k2 + x2, m2k2 + y2, n2k2 + z2) .
The lines (2.26) and (2.27) intersect so these points should coincide for
the same values of k1 and k2, we get
(x1 −x2) + l1k1 −l2k2 = 0
(y1 −y2) + m1k1 −m2k2 = 0
(z1 −z2) + n1k1 −n2k2 = 0

∴The lines (2.26) and (2.27) are coplanar.

represents the plane that passes through the line (2.27) and is parallel to the
line (2.26).
In case the lines are coplanar then the point (x2, y2, z2) lies on the ﬁrst
plane and the point (x1, y1, z1) on the second. Moreover, these two equations
are then identical.
∴The plane containing two coplanar lines is the one that passes through
one line and is parallel to the other or through one line and any point on the
other.
2) Two lines will intersect if and if, there exists a point whose coordinates
satisfy the four equations, two of each line so that for intersection, we require

i.e.,
2A + 3B −2C = 0

(i) al + bm + cn = 0.
(ii) One point (−1, −2, −5) on the line lies on the plane.
Direction ratios l, m, n of a line are −2, 3, 4 respectively.
∴al + bm + cn = (1) (−2) + 2 (3) + (−1) (4) = 0
Moreover; the point (−1, −2, −5) lies on the plane (2.45) if −1 + 2 (−2) −
(−5) = 0.
∴The line (2.43) lies in the plane (2.44).

Now any plane containing the line (2.45) is
A (x + 1) + B (y −3) + C (z + 2) = 0
(2.46)
where −3A + 2B + C = 0
(2.47)
Since the plane passes through the point (0, 7, −7) , we get
A + 4B −5C = 0
(2.48)
Solving (2.47) and (2.48), we get
A
−10 −4 =
B
1 −15 =
C
−12 −2 ⇒A
1 = B
1 = C

Substituting these values of A, B, and C in (2.46), we get

∴x + y + z = 0

(2.50)
lies on the plane (2.49) if
(a) one point (0, 7, −7) lies on the plane (2.49)

Now point (0, 7, −7)lies on the plane (2.49) is 0 + 7 −7 = 0
al + bm + cn = (1) (1) + (1) (−3) + (1) (2) = 0.

(2.59)
From (2.56) and (2.57),

(2.64)
Any plane through the line (2.64) is

The line (2.63) lies on this plane if

66
Straight Line
1) The point (−1, −1, −1) on the line (2.63) lies on this plane.
2) al + bm + cn = 0.
Now the point (−1, −1, −1) lies on the plane (2.63) if
−1 −2 −3 −8 + k (−2 −3 −4 −11) = 0
∴k = −7
10 .
Substituting the value of k in (2.65), we get
x + 2y + 3z −8 −7
10 (2x + 3y + 4z −11) = 0
∴10x + 20y + 30z −80 −14x −21y −28z + 77 = 0
∴−4x −y + 2z −3 = 0
∴4x + y −22 + 3 = 0.
Now, al + bm + cn = 4 (1) + 1 (2) + (−2) (3) = 0.
∴The two lines are coplanar and the equation of the plane in which they
lie is 4x + y −2z + 3 = 0.
The two lines (2.63) and (2.64) will intersect at a point where the line
(2.63) meets one of the planes of the second line.
Now any point on the ﬁrst line is
(r −1, 2r −1, 3r −1)
(2.66)
If this lies on the ﬁrst plane of the 2nd line,
r −1 + 2 (2r −1) + 3 (3r −1) −8 = 0
∴r = 1.
∴Substituting the value of r in (2.66), we get (0, 1, 2) as the point of
intersection of two lines.
24) A, A1, B, B1, C, C1 are points on the axes, shows that the lines of
intersection of the plane A1BC, AB1C1, B1CA, BC1A1, C1AB, CA1B

(2.69)
Thus, the line of intersection of the planes (2.67) and (2.68) lies on the plane
(2.69).
By symmetry, the line of intersection of the planes B1CA, BC1A1 and
C1AB1, C1AB also lie on the plane (2.69).
∴All the lines of the given planes are coplanar.
25) Show that the line of intersection of the ﬁrst two planes is coplanar with
the line of intersection of the later two x+2y −z −3 = 0, 3x−y +2z −1 =
0, 2x −2y + 3z −2 = 0, x −y + z + 1 = 0 are four planes. and ﬁnd the
equation of the plane containing the two lines.
Sol. The line of intersection of the ﬁrst two planes is

(2.70)
and the line of intersection of the last two planes is
2x −2y + 3z −2 = 0
x −y + z + 1 = 0

(2.71)
Now to prove that the two lines (2.70) and (2.71) are coplanar we reduce the
line (2.70) in symmetrical form.
To ﬁnd direction ratios of the line (2.70), we omit constant,
i.e., x + 2y −z = 0
3x −y + 2z = 0
∴
x
(4 −1) =

(−3 −2) =

∴x

∴The direction ratios of the line are 3, −5, −7.
For one point on the line (2.70), Let z = 0 in (2.70), we get

3x −y −1 = 0
∴

7, z = 0
∴One point on the line (2.70) is

Hence the equations of the line (2.70) in the symmetrical form are

(2.72)
Now any plane through the line (2.71) is
2x −2y + 3z −2 + k (x −y + z + 1) = 0.
(2.73)
This plane contains the line (2.72) if
(i) al + bm + cn = 0
(ii) One point
 5


on the line (2.72) line on this plane.
Now coefﬁcients x, y, z in the plane (2.73) are 2 + k, −2 −k, 3 + k
and direction ratios of the line (2.73) are 3, −5, −7.
∴al + bm + cn = 0 gives
3 (2 + k) + (−5) (−2 −k) + (−7) (3 + k) = 0
∴k −5 = 0
∴k = 5.
Substituting k = 5 in (2.73), we get
2x −2y + 3z −2 + 5 (x −y + z + 1) = 0
∴7x −7y + 8z + 3 = 0.

2.9 Skew Lines and the Shortest Distance between Two
Lines
Skew lines:
Two straight lines are said to be skewed if they are neither parallel nor
intersecting.
i.e., the lines which do not lie in a plane.
Shortest distance between two lines:
To show that the length of the line intercepted between two lines which are
perpendicular to both is the shortest distance between them.
Let AB and CD be two skew lines given by
x −x1

(2.75)
and
x −x2
l2
= y −y2
m2

.
(2.76)
Let LK be the line of shortest distance. If (l, m, n) be the direction of
LK then LK is perpendicular to both AB and CD so,
ll1 + mm1 + nn1 = 0,
and ll2 + mm2 + nn2 = 0

Let the coordinates of A and C are (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2) respec-
tively then

To ﬁnd the equation of the line of shortest distance, we observe that it is

∴The equation of the plane containing LK and AB will be



(2.79)
Since LK is the line of intersection of the planes (2.78) and (2.79), so the

2.9 Skew Lines and the Shortest Distance between Two Lines
71
Corollary:
If the lines (2.75) and (2.76) are coplanar, then the length of the shortest
distance is zero.
∴The condition (2.77) becomes

y2 −y1
z2 −z1
l1

m2
n2


Alternative Method:
We now ﬁnd the length of shortest distance and the equation of shortest
distance in another way which is very useful to solve numerical problems.
Let the equations of two skew lines AB and CD be
x −x1
l1
= y −y1
m1
= z −z1
n1
= (k1)
(2.80)
and
x −x2
l2
= y −y2
m2
= z −z2
n2
= (k2)
(2.81)
Let LK
be the line of shortest distance. Now the coordinates
of L and K may be taken as (x1 + l1k1, y1 + m1k1, z1 + n1k1), and
(x2 + l2k2, y2 + m2k2, z2 + n2k2) respectively.
∴The direction ratios of LK will be (x2 + l2k2 −x1 −l1k1,
y2 + m2k2 −y1 −m1k1, z2 + m2k2 −z1 −m1k1).
Now since LK is perpendicular to both (2.80) and (2.81), we get
l1 (x2 + l2k2 −x1 −l1k1) + m1 (y2 + m2k2 −y1 −m1k1) +
n1 (z2 + m2k2 −z1 −m1k1) = 0

and
l2 (x2 + l2k2 −x1 −l1k1) + m2 (y2 + m2k2 −y1 −m1k1) +
n2 (z2 + m2k2 −z1 −m1k1) = 0.
(2.83)
Solving (2.82) and (2.83), we get the values of k1 and k2.
Substituting k1 and k2 we get coordinates of L and K. Let coordinates of
L and K be (α1, β1, γ1) and (α2, β2, γ2) respectively then
LK = Length of the shortest distance
=
	
(α2 −α1)2 + (β2 −β1)2 + (γ2 −γ1)2.
∴The equation of the line of shortest distance will be
x −α1
α2 −α1
= y −β1
β2 −β1
= z −γ1
γ2 −γ1
.
2.10 Equation of Two Skew Lines in Symmetric Form
The equation of two skew lines can be written in the form y = mx, z = c,
and y = −mx, z = −c by a special choice of axes; where 2c is the length of
the shortest distance between two lines.
Let AB and CD be two skew lines and LK be their line of shortest
distance and also let the length of shortest distance be 2c.
The Special choice of axes:
Let us consider the middle point LK as the origin O and this line of shortest
distance as z - axis.
Through O let us draw two lines A1OB1 and C1OD1 is perpendicular to
LK. In this plane, let us take the internal and external bisectors of the angle
B1OD1 as x −axis and y −axis respectively.

2.10 Equation of Two Skew Lines in Symmetric Form
73
Let ∠B1OD1 = 2α.
∴{OX, OY, OZ} is a new set of rectangular axes by special choice.
Now the line OB1 or AB makes angles α, π
2 −α, π
2 with the coordinate
axes OX, OY and OZ respectively.
Similarly, OD1 or CD makes angles −α, π
2 + α, π
2 with respective axes.
∴The direction cosines of AB and CD will be

cosα, cos
 π
2 −α

, cos π
2

and

cos (−α) , cos
 π
2 + α

, cos π
2

i.e., (cos α , sin α , 0) and (cos α , −sin α , 0) respectively.
Now OL = OK = c (∵LK = 2c) and since LK is taken as z −axis,
so the coordinates of the point L and K will be (0, 0, c) and (0, 0, −c)
respectively.
Since the line AB is a straight line passing through (0, 0, c) and having
direction cosines (cos α , sin α , 0), so its equation will be
x −0
cos α = y −0
sin α = z −c
0
(2.84)
and similarly, the equation of the other line will be
x −0
cos α = y −0
−sin α = z + c
0
.
(2.85)
The Equations (2.84) and (2.85) can also be written as
y = xtan α , z = c
(2.86)
and
y = −xtan α , z = −c.
(2.87)
Let us assume m = tan α, so Equations (2.86) and (2.87) becomes
y = mx, z = c
(2.88)
and
y = −mx, z = −c.
(2.89)
Equations (2.88) and (2.89) can also be expressed in compact form as
y = ±mx, z = ±c.
Remark:
In parametric form, any point on (2.86) and (2.87) can be written as
(k, tan α , c) and (k1, −k1tan α , −c).

Straight Line
Alternative Methods:
We can also determine the length and equations of the shortest distance
between two given lines by the following methods:
x −x1
l1
= y −y1
m1
= z −z1
n1
x −x2
l2
= y −y2
m2
= z −z2
n2
.
I) Method of Intersection:
The general coordinates of points on the two lines are
P(x1 + l1k, y1 + m1k, z1 + n1k), and Q(x2 + l2k1, y2 + m2k1, z2 + n2k1)
(2.90)
The direction ratios of PQ are x1−x2+l1k−l2k1, y1−y2+m1k−m2k1, z1+
n1k −n2k1.
Since PQ is perpendicular to AB and CD both, we get two equations
which may be solved for k, k1. Substituting the values of k and k1 in equation
(2.90) we get the coordinates of the points P and Q.
We can ﬁnd the shortest distance by distance formula.
i.e., The length of the shortest distance = PQ
x −x1
x2 −x1
= y −y1
y2 −y1
= z −z1
z2 −z1
.
II) Method of parallel plane:
The length of the shortest distance can be obtained by using the fact that it
is equal to the perpendicular from any point on the ﬁrst line upon the plane
drown through the second line parallel to the ﬁrst.
Remark:
1) If only the shortest distance and its equations are required and the two
given lines are in the symmetrical form then the method of projection
should be used.
2) If points of intersection of the line of shortest distance with the given
lines are also required, then the method of intersection should be used.

2.10 Equation of Two Skew Lines in Symmetric Form
75
3) If one or both the lines are given in the general form and only the length
of the shortest distance is required then the method of the parallel plane
should be preferred.

There are three cases in respect to the intersection of planes:
1) The three planes intersect in a common point (Fig (i))
2) The three planes have a line in a common (Fig (ii))
3) The three planes form a triangular prism (Fig (iii))
Three planes are said to form a triangular prism if the three lines of
intersection of the three planes, taken in pairs, are distinct and parallel.
To ﬁnd the line of intersection of (2.107) and (2.108) in the symmetrical
form

Substituting z = 0 in (2.107) and (2.108), we get

a2x + b2y + d2 = 0

The three planes (2.107), (2.108), and (2.109) will intersect in a point if the
line of intersection of (2.107) and (2.108).
i.e., the line (2.110) cuts the plane (2.109) at a point, and for this (2.110)
should not be parallel to the plane (2.109).
i.e., al + bm + cn ̸= 0
i.e., a3 (b1c2 −b2c1) + b3 (a2c1 −a1c2) + c3 (a1b2 −a2b1) ̸= 0

Sphere
3.1 Deﬁnition
The sphere is a locus of a point that moves so that its distance from a ﬁxed
point always remains constant.
The ﬁxed point is called the center of the sphere and the constant distance
is called the radius of the sphere.
3.2 Equation of Sphere in Vector Form
Consider a sphere S with center C and radius ‘a’. Let P be any point on the
sphere. Let −→c and −→r be the position vectors of C and P respectively with
respect to O; the origin of reference.
∴−−→
CP = −−→
OP −−−→
OC
∴−−→

∴|−→r −−→c | 2 = a2
∴(−→r −−→c ) . (−→r −−→c ) = a2
∴−→r .−→r −−→r .−→c −−→c .−→r + −→c .−→c = a2
∴|−→r |2 −2−→r .−→c + |−→c |2 = a2
∴|−→r |2 −2−→r .−→c + d = 0
∴|−→r |2 −2−→r .−→c + |−→c |2 = a2
(3.2)
where d = |−→c |2 −a2
is the equation of sphere in vector form.
Case 1): If O lies on the sphere, then OC = OP;
i.e., c = a ⇒d = 0
∴The Equation of sphere is |−→r |2 −2−→r .−→c = 0
Case 2): If the center C is at the origin O, then c = 0 and d = −a2.
∴Equation of sphere is |−→r |2−a2 = 0.
|−→r |2 = a2
|−→r | = a.
Equation of sphere in the cartesian form:
Consider a sphere S with center C (α, β, γ) , and radius ‘a’. Let P (x, y, z)
be any point on the sphere. Let −→x and −→c be the position vector of P and C
respectively with respect to O ; the origin of reference.
∴−→r = x−→i + y−→j + z−→k
−→c = α−→i + β−→j + γ−→
k.
The equation in vector form is |−→r −−→c | = a.
∴
(x −α) −→i + (y −β) −→j + (z −γ) −→k
 = a
∴(x −α)2 + (y −β)2 + (z −γ)2 = a2
which is the equation of sphere S in cartesian form with center C (α, β, γ),
and radius ‘a’.
Remark:
When center C is origin i.e., α = β = γ = 0 then the equation of the sphere
is x2 + y2 + z2 = a2.

3.3 General Equation of the Sphere
The general equation of the sphere is
x2 + y2 + z2 + 2ux + 2vy + 2wz + d = 0
(3.3)
∴x2 + 2ux + u2 + y2 + 2vy + v2 + z2 + 2wz + w2 + d = u2 + v2 + w2
∴(x + u)2 + (y + v)2 + (z + w)2 = u2 + v2 + w2 −d
∴(x + u)2 + (y + v)2 + (z + w)2 = a2
where a2 = u2 + v2 + w2 −d
which is the equation of sphere with the center (−u, −v, −w) and radius
a =

u2 + v2 + w2 −d.
Remark:
1) Characteristics of the equation of the sphere:
1.1 The equation of sphere is a second-degree equation in x, y, and z.
1.2 Coefﬁcients of x2, y2, and z2 are the same.
1.3 The products terms xy, yz, and zx are absent.
2) Equation of the sphere with the center origin and radius a is
x2 + y2 + z2 = a2.
3) Make the coefﬁcients of x2, y2, and z2 one if they are not before ﬁnding
the center and radius of the sphere.
3.4 Equation of Sphere Whose End-Points of a Diameter
are Given
Let O be the origin of the vector. Let −−→
AB be a diameter of a sphere S with
center C. Let −→a and −→b be position vectors of points A and Brespectively.
Let P be any point on the sphere with position vector −→r . ∠APB is an angle

Consider a sphere with a center at C and radius a. Let A be a point on the
section of the sphere by the given plane. Let CP be the perpendicular distance
of the plane from the center C of the sphere. Since CP is perpendicular to
the plane.
∴It is perpendicular to the line AP.
∴∠CPA = 90
∴CP 2 + AP 2 = AC2 = a2 (∵AC is radius of sphere)
∴AP 2 = a2 −CP 2 = constant
∴the Locus of A is a circle with a center at P and radius AP.
∴The plane section is a circle.

3.9 Tangent Plane
The locus of all tangent lines at a point P of the sphere is called the tangent
plane to the sphere at a point P.
A plane that touches the given sphere exactly at one point is called a
tangent plane to the sphere at that point.
Consider a sphere with center C and a plane that touches it at P then a
plane is a tangent plane to the sphere.
i.e., the length of the perpendicular from the center C of the sphere to the
tangent plane is equal to the radius of the sphere.
Equation of the tangent plane:
The general equation of sphere is
x2 + y2 + z2 + 2ux + 2vy + 2wz + d = 0
and a tangent plane intersects the sphere at P (x1, y1, z1) .
∴The center of the sphere is C (−u, −v, −w).
Direction ratios of the normal CP to the plane are (x1 + u; y1 + v; z1 + w).
∴Equation of plane through P (x1, y1, z1) , and normal to CP is
(x1 + u) (x −x1) + (y1 + v) (y −y1) + (z1 + w) (z −z1) = 0
∴xx1 −x2


−ux1 −vy1 −wz1 = −ux1 −vy1 −wz1.
∴The equation of the tangent plane is
xx1 + yy1 + zz1 + u (x + x1) + v (y + y1) + w (z + z1) + d = 0.

Remark:
1) The equation of the tangent plane to be the sphere x2 + y2 + z2 = a2 at
point P (x1, y1, z1) is xx1 + yy1 + zz1 = a2
2) The equation of the tangent plane of the sphere can be written by
replacing x2 by xx1; y2 by yy1; z2 by zz1; 2x by x + x1; 2y by
y + y1 and 2z by z + z1 in the general equation of a sphere.
3.10 Equation of the Normal to the Sphere
The line CP which passes through the center C of the sphere and through the
point of the contact P and perpendicular to the tangent plane is called normal
to the sphere at P.
If l, m, n are the coefﬁcients of x, y, z in the equation of the tangent plane
then l, m, n are the direction ratios of the normal. Since it passes through
P (x1, y1,z1) its equation is x−x1
l
= y−y1
m
= z−z1
n
.

2x + 2y = z is 2x + 2y −z + k = 0.
The plane will be a tangent plane if its distance from the center (2, −1, 3)
of the sphere is equal to the radius of sphere = 3.
i.e., p = r

Cone
4.1 Deﬁnition
A cone is a surface generated by a straight line that passes through a ﬁxed
point and satisﬁes one more condition.
i.e., it intersects a given curve or touches a given surface.
The ﬁxed point is called the vertex and the given curve is called the
guiding curve of the cone.
The individual straight line on the surface of a cone is called its generator.
4.2 Equation of a Cone with a Conic as Guiding Curve
To ﬁnd the equation of a cone with vertex (α, β, γ) and whose generators
intersect the conic ax2 + by2 + 2hxy + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0 and z = 0.
Consider a straight line passing through a ﬁxed point (α, β, γ) and having
direction ratios (l, m, n).

∴T 2 −2T S1 + S12 = S S1 −2T S1 + S12
∴T 2 = SS12
which is the required equation of the enveloping cone.
6) Find the enveloping cone of the sphere x2 + y2 + z2 −2x + 4z = 1 with
its vertex at (1, 1, 1).
Sol. Let S : x2 + y2 + z2 −2x + 4z −1 = 0.
S1 : (S)(1,1,1) = 1 + 1 + 1 −2 + 4 −1 = 4.
T : (1)x + (1)y + (1)z −(x + 1) + 2(z + 1) −1 = y + 3z.
∴Equation of cone is

∴(x2 + y2 + z2 −2x −4z −1)(4) = (y + 3z)2
∴4x2 + 4y2 + 4z2 −8x + 16z −4 = y2 + 6yz + 9z2

4.4 Equation of the Cone whose Vertex is the Origin is
Homogeneous
Theorem:
The equation of the cone whose vertex is the origin is homogeneous and
conversely.
or Every second-degree equation in x, y, z represents a cone with vertex
at the origin if and only if it is second degree homogeneous in x, y, and z.
Proof: The general second-degree equation is
ax2 +by2 +cz2 +2hxy+2fyz +2gzx+2ux+2vy+2wz +d = 0. (4.17)
Now, to prove that it represents a cone with its vertex origin if and only if
u = v = w = d = 0.
Suppose Equation (4.17) represents a cone with a vertex at the origin. Let
P(x1, y1, z1) be a point on the cone represented with vertex at O (0, 0, 0).
∴Direction ratios of OP passing through the point P will be
(x1 −0; y1 −0; z1 −0) = (x1, y1, z1).
∴Equation of generator of the cone will be
x −0
x1
= y −0
y1
= z −0
z1
= t
∴x = x1t; y = y1t; z = z1t.
(4.18)
Let Q(x1t, y1t, z1t) lie on the cone.
∴It must satisfy the Equation (4.17).
∴a(x1t)2 + b(y1t)2 + c(z1t)2 + 2h(x1t)(y1t) + 2f(y1t)(z1t)
+2g(z1t)(x1t) + 2u(x1t) + 2v(y1t) + 2w(z1t) + d = 0

+2t [ux1 + vy1 + wz1] + d = 0
(4.19)
which is true for all values of t; t ̸= 0.
∴ax2
1+by2
1+cz2
1+2hx1y1+2fy1z1+2gz1x1 =0; ux1+vy1+wz1 =0; d=0.

4.4 Equation of the Cone whose Vertex is the Origin is Homogeneous
143
From equation ux1 + vy1 + wz1 = 0; if u, v, w are not all zero then the
coordinates x1, y1, z1 of any point on the cone satisfy an equation of the ﬁrst
degree. i.e., ux + vy + wz = 0 which is the equation of the plane which
contradicts our hypothesis that P(x1, y1, z1) lies on a cone.
∴u, v, w all are not zero is false.
∴u = 0 = v = w and by equation d = 0.
∴General second-degree equation reduces to
ax2 + by2 + cz2 + 2fyz + 2gzx + 2hxy = 0
which is a homogeneous second-degree equation.
Converse:
Let
ax2 + by2 + cz2 + 2hxy + 2gzx + 2fyz = 0,
(4.20)
be a given second homogeneous equation in x, y, z then to prove that it
represents a cone with vertex origin.
Let P(x1,y1, z1) be any point that satisﬁes the Equation (4.20)
∴ax2
1 + by2
1 + cz2
1 + 2h (x1) (y1) + 2g (z1) (x1) + 2f (y1) (z1) = 0
∴t2 
ax2
1 + by2
1 + cz2
1 + 2hx1y1 + 2gx1z1 + 2fy1z1

= 0; t ̸= 0
∴a(x1t)2 + b(y1t)2 + c(z1t)2 + 2h(x1t)(y1t) + 2g(x1t)(z1t)
+2f(y1t)(z1t) = 0.
∴Point Q(x1t, y1t, z1t) satisﬁes the Equation (4.20).
i.e., If P(x1, y1, z1) satisﬁes the Equation (4.20) then the point
(x1t, y1t, z1t) also satisﬁes the Equation (4.20).
∴If P lies on the surface represented by (4.20) then every point Q on the
line −−→
OP lies on it.
∴The surface is generated by line through the origin and by deﬁnition is
a cone with its vertex at O.
Corollary:
If l, m, n be the direction ratios of any generator of a cone with vertex origin
then (l, m, n) satisﬁes the equation of the cone.
Proof: Let the equation of cone with vertex origin be
ax2 + by2 + cz2 + 2hxy + 2gzx + 2fyz = 0.

∴a(lt)2 + b(mt)2 + c(nt)2 + 2h(lt)(mt) + 2g(nt)(lt)
+2f(mt)(nt) = 0
∴t2[al2 + bm2 + cn2 + 2hlm + 2gln+ 2fmn] = 0
∴al2 + bm2 + cn2 + 2hlm + 2gln+ 2fmn = 0 (∵t ̸= 0)
which proves that (l, m, n) satisfy the Equation (4.21).
9) Find the equation of the cone whose vertex is at the origin and which passes

neous equation.
∴lx + my + nz = p

x2 + y2 + z2 −x −1 = 0,
(4.24)
and
x2 + y2 + z2 + y −2 = 0.
(4.25)
Let us assume t, for making both the equations homogeneous in x, y and z
∴Equation (4.24) becomes
x2 + y2 + z2 −tx −t2 = 0,
(4.26)
and Equation (4.25) becomes
x2 + y2 + z2 + ty −2t2 = 0.

Eliminating t from Equations (4.26) and (4.27), we get
−tx −ty + t2 = 0
∴−t (x + y −t) = 0
∴x + y = 0(∵t ̸= 0)
Substituting the value of t in Equation (4.26), we get
x2 + y2 + z2 −x (x + y) −(x + y)2 = 0
∴−x2 + z2 −3xy = 0
∴x2 −z2 + 3xy = 0
which is the required equation of the cone.
13) Find the equation of the cone with vertex at the origin and which pass

S1 : x2 + y2 + z2 + x −2y + 3z −4 = 0
S2 : x2 + y2 + z2 + 2x −3y + 4z −5 = 0.
(4.28)
∴Equation of the plane of the circle of their intersection is
S1 −S2 = 0
∴−x + y −z + 1 = 0
∴x −y + z = 1.
∴The equation of a cone with vertex origin is second-degree homogeneous.
∴Equation (4.28) becomes
x2 + y2 + z2 + (x −2y + 3z)(1) −4(1)2 = 0
∴(x2 + y2 + z2) + (x −2y + 3z)(x −y + z) −4(x −y + z)2 = 0
∴x2 + y2 + z2 + x2 −xy + xz −2xy + 2y2 −2yz + 3xz −3yz + 3z2
−4x2 −4y2 −4z2 + 8xy + 8yz −8xz = 0
∴−2x2 −y2 + 5xy + 3yz −4xz = 0
∴2x2 + y2 −5xy −3yz + 4xz = 0

(4.29)
Let the x axis be the generator.
∴Its direction cosine will satisfy the equation of cone i.e., (1, 0, 0)
satisﬁes equation (4.29).
∴a = 0.
Similarly,the y axis and z axis are generators.
∴(0, 1, 0) and (0, 0, 1) respectively are direction cosines of the y axis and
z axis which satisﬁes the Equation (4.29).
∴b = 0 and c = 0
∴Equation (4.29) becomes,

Corollary:
The tangent plane at any point (kα, kβ, kγ) on the generator through the
point (α, β, γ) is the same as the tangent plane at (α, β, γ).
Proof: Equation of the tangent plane at (kα, kβ, kγ) to the cone with vertex
origin is given by
x [a (kα) + h (kβ) + g (kγ)] + y [h (kα) + b (kβ) + f (kγ)]
+z[g(kα) + f(kβ) + c(kγ)] = 0
∴k[x(aα + hβ + gγ) + y(hα + bβ + fγ) + z(gα + fβ + cγ)] = 0
∴x(aα + hβ + gγ) + y(hα + bβ + fγ) + z(gα + fβ + cγ) = 0
which is the required equation of tangent plane at point (α, β, γ).
∴The tangent plane at any point on the cone touches the cone at all points
of the generator through that point and we say that the plane touches the cone
along with the generator.

4.8 Right Circular Cone
A right circular cone is a surface generated by a line that passes through a
ﬁxed point and makes a constant angle with a ﬁxed line through the ﬁxed
point.
The ﬁxed point is called the vertex.
The ﬁxed-line through the vertex is called the axis and the ﬁxed angle is
called the semi-vertical angle of the cone and the straight line through the
vertex is the generator.
Theorem: Every section of a right circular cone by a line perpendicular to its
axis is a circle.

Let a plane perpendicular to the axis on a right circular cone with a semi-
vertical angle α meets it at N.

which contains the line NP.

∴PN
ON = tan α
∴NP = ONtan α .
NP is constant for every position of point P of the section.
∴The section is circular with N as its center.

circle.

which is the condition that the point (α, β, γ) should lie on the surface of the
cylinder.

which is the required equation of cylinder.
Remark:
If the generator is parallel to the z-axis, then l = 0; m = 0 and n = 1 in the
equation of the cylinder become ax2 + 2hxy + by2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0.
1) Find the equation of the cylinder whose generators are parallel to the line

Sol. Generators are parallel to the line x
1 = −y
2 = z
3 and the guiding curve is
the ellipse x2 + 2y2 = 1; z = 3.
Let P (x1, y1, z1) be any point on the cylinder, then the equation of any

Sol. The given curves are

5.3 Enveloping Cylinder
The locus of the tangents to a sphere that is parallel to a given line is a cylinder
known as the enveloping cylinder.
Straight lines are known as generators and the ﬁxed line is known as the
axis of an enveloping cylinder.
Equation of the enveloping cylinder:
To ﬁnd the equation of the cylinder whose generator touch the sphere
x2 + y2 + z2 = a2 and are parallel to the line x
l = y
m = z
n.
Let P (α, β, γ) be any point on a generator parallel to a ﬁxed-line with
direction ratio (l, m, n) .

∴Equation of generator through point P (α, β, γ) is
x −α
l

m
= z −γ
n
= t,
(5.4)
∴x = α + lt; y = β + mt; z = γ + nt
(5.5)
are generator coordinates of the line (5.4).
Since generator (5.4) touches the given sphere
x2 + y2 + z2 = a2
(5.6)
∴Substituting general coordinates in Equation (5.6), we get
∴(α + lt)2 + (mt + β)2 + (nt + γ)2 = a2
∴t2 
l2 + m2 + n2
+ 2t (lα + mβ + γn) +

α2 + β2 + γ2 −a2

∴Straight line (5.4) touches the sphere if and only if the quadratic equation
must have equal roots.
i.e., Δ = 0
∴b2 −4ac = 0
∴b2 = 4ac
∴[2 (lα + mβ + nγ)] = 4 (l + m + n) (α + β + γ −a)
∴(lα + mβ + nγ)2 =

l2 + m2 + n2 
α2 + β2 + γ2 −a2

This is the condition for a line to touch the sphere at (α, β, γ) .
Replacing α, β, γ by x, y, z respectively, we get
∴(lx + my + nz)2 =

l2 + m2 + n2 
x2 + y2 + z2 −a2
which is the required equation of enveloping cylinder.
3)Find the enveloping cylinder of the sphere x2 + y2 + z2 −2x + 4y = 1
having its generators parallel to the line x = y = z.
Sol. Let P (α, β, γ) be any point on the enveloping cylinder.
∴Equation of the generator through P (α, β, γ) is x−α

∴x = t + α; y = t + β; z = t + γ.
This point satisﬁes the equation of the sphere

Since this generator is a tangent to a given sphere.
∴The quadratic equation must have equal roots

∴2α2 + 2β2 + 2γ2 −2αβ −2αγ −2βγ −8α + 10β −2γ −4 = 0
∴α2 + β2 + γ2 −αβ −αγ −βγ −4α + 5β −γ −2 = 0.
Replace α, β and γ by x, y, and z respectively, we get
x2 + y2 + z2 −xy −xz −yz −4x + 5y −z −2 = 0
is the required enveloping cylinder of the sphere.

6) Show that the equation of the tangent plane at point (x1, y1, z1) of the
cylinder ax2 + 2hxy + by2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0 is x (ax1 + hy1 + g) +
y (hx1 + by1 + f) + (gx1 + fy1 + c) = 0, and that it touches the cylinder at
all points of the generator through the point.
Sol. Let the equation of the given cylinder be
ax2 + 2hxy + by2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0.

Equation of any tangent line through (x1, y1, z1) is
x −x1
l

(5.10)
Any point on this tangent is (lr + x1, mr + y1, nr + z1)

a(x1 + lr)2 + 2h (x1 + lr) (y1 + mr) + b(y1 + mr)2 + 2g (x1 + lr)

+ ax2
1 + 2hx1y1 + by2
1 + 2gx1 + 2fy1 + c = 0
(5.11)
which is a quadratic equation in r.
Since the point (x1, y1, z1) lies on the cylinder (5.9),
ax2
1 + 2hx1y1 + by2
1 + 2gx1 + 2fy1 + c = 0.
(5.12)
By (5.11) and (5.12), we get
r2 
al2 + 2hlm + bm2
+ 2r [l (ax1 + hy1 + g) + m (hx1 + by1 + f)] = 0
(5.13)
which shows that one value of r is zero.
Since the line (5.10) touches the cylinder, it meets the cylinder only at one
point, so both values of r in (5.13) must be equal.
Since one root is zero, the other must also be zero.
∴Coefﬁcient of r = 0.
∴l (ax1 + hy1 + g) + m (hx1 + by1 + f) = 0.
(5.14)

5.4 Right Circular Cylinder
175
Eliminating l, m, n from (5.10) and (5.14), the locus of tangent lines
(5.10) is
(x −x1) (ax1 + hy1 + g) + (y −y1) (hx1 + by1 + f) = 0
∴x(ax1 + hy1 + g) + y(hx1 + by1 + f)
= ax2
1 + 2hx1y1 + by2
1 + gx1 + fy1.
Adding gx1 + fy1 on both sides, we get
x (ax1 + hy1 + g) + y (hx1 + by1 + f) + (gx1 + fy1 + c)
= ax2
1 + 2hx1y1 + by2
1 + 2gx1 + 2fy1 + c
= 0. (By (5.12))
∴The required equation of the tangent plane at (x1, y1, z1) is
x (ax1 + hy1 + g) + y (hx1 + by1 + f) + (gx1 + fy1 + c) = 0
(5.15)
Now, z is absent from the equation of the cylinder.
∴Its generators are parallel to the z axis.
∴Direction cosines are 0, 0, 1.
∴Equations of the generator through (x1, y1, z1) are x−x1
0
= y−y1
0
=
z−z1
1 .
Any point on this generator is (x1, y1, r + z1) .
∴Equations of the tangent plane at (x1, y1, r + z1) to the cylinder (5.15)
is
x (ax1 + hy1 + g) + y (hx1 + by1 + f) + (gx1 + fy1 + c) = 0
(5.16)
which is the same as the Equation (5.15) for all values if r.
∴The tangent plane at every point of (5.16) is the same.
∴The tangent plane touches the cylinder along with the generator through
that point.
5.4 Right Circular Cylinder
The right circular cylinder is a surface generated by straight lines which
intersect a ﬁxed circle and is perpendicular to the plane of the circle.
The ﬁxed circle is known as a guiding curve.

Central Conicoid
6.1 Deﬁnition
The locus of the general equation
ax2 + by2 + cz2 + 2fyz + 2gzx + 2hxy + 2ux + 2vy + 2wz + d = 0
of the second degree in x, y and z is called a conicoid.
Central conicoid:
All the surfaces which have a center and three principal planes are known as
central conicoid.
Cone is also a central conicoid; vertex is its center.
6.2 Intersection of a Line with the Central Conicoid
Prove that every line meets the central conicoid in two points.
Proof: Let ax2+by2+cz2 = 1 be the general equation of the central conicoid
which intersects the line
x −α
l
= y −β
m
= z −γ
n
= t
∴Coordinates of the line are given by x = α + lt; y = β + mt; z = γ + nt.
As the line intersects the conicoid, the coordinates satisfy the equation of
the conicoid.
i.e., a(α + lt)2 + b(β + mt)2 + c(γ + nt)2 = 1
∴t2(al2 +bm2 +cn2)+2t(alα+bmβ +cnγ)+(aα2 +bβ2 +cγ2 −1) = 0,
which is a quadratic equation in t.
∴It must have two roots t1 and t2.
∴Points are P (α + lt1, β + mt1, γ + nt1) and
Q (α + lt2, β + mt2, γ + nt2)

12x2 −17y2 + 7z2 −7 = 0
∴12(−3t −5)2 −17(t + 4)2 + 7(7t + 11)2 −7 = 0
∴12(9t2 + 3at + 25) −17(t2 + 8t + 16) + 7(49t2 + 154t + 121) −7 = 0
∴434t2 + 1302t + 868 = 0
∴t2 + 3t + 2 = 0

(6.4)
∴t2[al2 + bm2 + cn2] + 2t[alα + bmβ + cnγ] + [aα2 + bβ2 + cγ2 −1] = 0.
Line (6.3) is a tangent line to a central conicoid if and only if Equation (6.4)
has equal roots.
i.e., Δ = 0

al2 + bm2 + cn2 
aα2 + bβ2 + cγ2 −1

(∵By Equation (6.2); aα2 + bβ2 + cγ2 −1 = 0)
which is the condition for the line to be tangent line with central conicoid.
For the equation of the tangent place replace l, m and n by x −α, y −β,
and z −γ respectively.
∴aα (x −α) + bβ (y −β) + cγ (z −γ) = 0
∴aαx −aα2 + bβy −bβ2 + cγz −cγ2 = 0
∴aαx + bβy + cγz = aα2 + bβ2 + cγ2

Now, two tangent planes are given by Equations (6.7) and (6.5) which are

∴p2 =

∴(aαp)2 + (bβp)2 + (cγp)2 = 1.
∴We can say that aαp; bβp; cγp are the direction cosines of the normal at
the point (α, β, γ) .
6) Prove that from any given point six normal can be drawn to a central
conicoid.
Sol. The equation of the normal to the central conicoid

(6.18)
at point
(α, β, γ) is x −α
aα
= y −β
bβ
= z −γ
cγ
.
(6.19)
Let these normal passes through the point (x1, y1, z1)

6.5 Normal to Central Conicoid

∴Equation (6.19) becomes,
x1 −α
aα
= y1 −β
bβ
= z −γ
cγ
= λ
∴x1 = α (λa + 1) ; ; y1 = β (λb + 1) ; z1 = γ (λc + 1) .
∴α =
x1
λa + 1; β =
y1
λb + 1; γ =

Since (α, β, γ) is a point on (6.18); so Equation (6.18) becomes;

1(λa + 1)2(λb + 1)2
= (λa + 1)2(λb + 1)2(λc + 1)2
which is a sixth-degree equation in λ and solving the equation we get six
values of λ .
∴In general, we can draw six normals to the central conicoid passing
through points (x1, y1, z1) .
A Number of normals from a given point:
Let the ellipsoid be

Equations of the normal at (x1, y1, z1) are

If this passes through (α, β, γ) then

Similarly,

Since (x1, y1, z1) lies on (6.20), we get

which is a sixth-degree equation in k .
∴It gives six values of k corresponding to which six points (x1, y1, z1)
are obtained from the Equation (6.21), the normals at which pass through a
given point.

Let the ellipsoid be

(6.22)
If the normal at (x1, y1, z1) to the ellipsoid passes through the given point
(α, β, γ) then
x1 =

where k is a parameter,
To prove that the curve (6.23) is a cubic curve.
To test the degree of the curve we see its intersection with any arbitrary

∴The curve (6.23) is the cubic curve.
Since feet of the normals also lie on the ellipsoid (6.22), we conclude that
feet of the six normals from a given point are the six points of intersection of
the ellipsoid and a cubic curve.
Quadric cone through six concurrent normals:
To show that the six normals from (α, β, γ) to the ellipsoid lie on a cone of
the second degree.
Let the ellipsoid be
x2
a2 + y2
b2 + z2
c2 = 1.
(6.25)
Now since the normal at (x1, y1, z1) passes through (α, β, γ) we get

which is a quadratic equation in k .
Since PS is divided harmonically, i.e., internally and externally in that
same ratio at Q and R.
∴The quadratic equation (6.38) has equal and opposite roots.
∴Sum of roots = 0.
i.e., Coefﬁcient of k = 0.
∴axx1 + byy1 + czz1 −1 = 0

Solid Geometry with 
MATLAB Programming
Nita H. Shah
Falguni S. Acharya
Solid geometry is defined as the study of the geometry of three-
dimensional solid figures in Euclidean space. There are numerous 
techniques in solid geometry, mainly analytic geometry and methods 
using vectors, since they use linear equations and matrix algebra. 
Solid geometry is quite useful in everyday life, for example, to design 
different signs and symbols such as octagon shape stop signs, to 
indicate traffic rules, to design different 3D objects like cubicles in 
gaming zones, innovative lifts, creative 3D interiors, and to design 
3D computer graphics. Studying solid geometry helps students to 
improve visualization and increase logical thinking and creativity since 
it is applicable everywhere in day-to-day life. It builds up a foundation 
for advanced levels of mathematical studies. Numerous competitive 
exams include solid geometry since its foundation is required to 
study other branches like civil engineering, mechanical engineering, 
computer science engineering, architecture, etc.
This book is designed especially for students of all levels, and can 
serve as a fundamental resource for advanced level studies not only in 
mathematics but also in various fields like engineering, interior design, 
architecture, etc. It includes theoretical aspects as well as numerous 
solved examples. The book includes numerical problems and problems 
of construction as well as practical problems as an application of the 
respective topic. A special feature of this book is that it includes solved 
examples using the mathematical tool MATLAB.
