About the Author
Dr. Michael Arnheim is an English 
Barrister who also sits periodically as a 
court-appointed mediator. In addition, 
he is a member of the Irish Bar and is of 
counsel to Brown & Welsh P.C. of Meriden, 
Connecticut.
Michael Arnheim’s active interest in the 
U.S. Constitution started with a comparative paper he wrote at the age of 17, 
for which he was awarded a special prize in the Royal Commonwealth Society 
Essay competition. As a junior barrister he wrote a fortnightly column in the 
Solicitors Journal, in which he dealt with U.S. constitutional issues among 
others. He has also written on U.S. constitutional themes for publications 
such as the New Law Journal and Counsel magazine. In 1994, he was invited 
to edit the comparative Common Law volume in the prestigious International 
Library of Essays in Law and Legal Theory, published by Ashgate Dartmouth. 
He has also been consulted on matters involving immigration, healthcare, 
protectionism, states’ rights, and same-sex marriage.
Dr. Arnheim is the author of numerous articles and 15 books to date, 
including the following titles: Drafting Settlements of Disputes (Tolley, 1994), 
Civil Courts Practice & Procedure Handbook (Butterworths, 1999), A Handbook 
of Human Rights Law (Kogan Page, 2004), and Principles of the Common Law 
(Duckworth, 2004).
Dr. Arnheim has been interviewed on television on a number of occasions, 
particularly in South Africa and Sweden. In 1985 he spent several enjoyable 
hours on David Brudnoy’s radio talk show on WRKO in Boston, fi elding calls 
from listeners on topical legal and political issues.
Michael Arnheim started life as a member of the “Quiz Kids” team on South 
African national radio. He went to university at 16, took his fi rst degree when 
he was 19, received a First Class Honours degree at 20, and was awarded a 
master’s degree (with distinction) at age 21. He then won a national scholarship 
to St. John’s College, Cambridge, where he took his PhD and was elected a 
Fellow of the College.
After spending several years researching and teaching Classics and Ancient 
History as a Fellow of St. John’s College, Cambridge, at the age of 31 he was 
appointed a full Professor and Head of the Department of Classics at his 
original university in South Africa. Returning to Britain, he was called to the 
English Bar by Lincoln’s Inn in 1988.

When he is not trying cases or advising clients, Michael Arnheim spends his 
time teaching, writing, and (less often than he should) swimming.

Dedication
To the memory of my beloved parents.
To my students over the years, who kept me on my toes.
And to the spirit of American liberty, in the light of Abraham Lincoln’s 
challenge:
Must a government, of necessity, be too strong for the liberties of its own people, 
or too weak to maintain its own existence?
Acknowledgments
My classical and historical training has stood me in good stead in my practice 
of law, and, not least, in my study of the U.S. Constitution. Professor Theo 
Haarhoff taught me how diffi cult it sometimes is to differentiate between 
objective views and subjective views that mimic objectivity. Professor Hugo 
Jones and Professor John Crook of Cambridge University were two of the 
most tolerant minds that I have ever come across, but they never made the 
mistake of equating toleration with acceptance of all views as equally valid.
Special thanks to my editors at Wiley: Kathy Cox, Diane Steele, and Joan 
Friedman. My thanks also to Susan Ellis Wild for her review of the manu-
script. I owe a particular debt of gratitude to Kathy Nebenhaus, Vice 
President and Executive Publisher at Wiley, who, beyond the call of duty, 
took this book under her wing and saw it through to completion.
As I don’t have a cat, I can’t blame it for clambering over the keyboard. The 
sole responsibility for any mistakes rests on me. The law as stated in the 
book is correct as of Washington’s Birthday (Presidents’ Day), February 16, 
2009. For updates, go to www.michaelarnheim.com.

Foreword
“W
e the people” are the opening words of the U.S. Constitution, and 
it is fi tting that this book is written for “We the people.” Both the 
Constitution itself, and this book explaining it, were meant for everybody, for 
all of the American people.
This book can be read on several different levels. If you just want to under-
stand the basics of the Constitution, this book offers you an easy, enjoyable, 
and at times humorous way to do so. But the book also offers a much deeper 
insight into the Constitution and all the controversies surrounding it.
Michael Arnheim does not pull his punches. He makes no secret of his own 
views on the Constitution. However, the book always presents both sides of 
every argument fairly, so that you, the reader, can decide what take to adopt 
on any issue.
The U.S. Constitution is the world’s oldest written constitution, and it was 
a revolutionary document. Written by men who just a few years earlier had 
won American independence from Britain, it changed the relationship 
altogether between people and government.
Indeed, that was the genius of the Constitution — limiting government to 
protect the liberty of the people. Because the Framers recognized that 
unchecked government can strip the people of their freedoms, they designed 
a constitution to prevent that from happening.
James Madison, the primary author of the Constitution, explained as follows:
If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels 
were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on 
government would be necessary. In framing a government which 
is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies 
in this: you must first enable the government to control the 
governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.
Because men are not angels, the Constitution was designed to create an 
effective national government and, at the same time, prevent the government 
from overreaching.
At the time of this writing, our Nation is facing some of the greatest chal-
lenges in its history. One possible solution to these problems is to allow the 
government ever-expanding power. But it remains to be seen whether that 
would really be the best choice either in practical terms or in terms of the 
Constitution.

For good or for ill, the meaning of the Constitution has often been very much 
in the hands of the nine justices of the U.S. Supreme Court. This book goes 
in depth into the different approaches adopted by different justices over 
the years. Dr. Arnheim explains his own interpretations in simple, direct 
language, and he also explains why he favors the approach that he adopts — 
while at the same time setting out the opposing views.
For example, Justices William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall both believed 
that the death penalty always constituted “cruel and unusual punishment.” 
Dr. Arnheim explains why he believes they were wrong — based on the text 
of the Constitution itself. But Dr. Arnheim goes further, arguing that Justices 
Brennan and Marshall were really confusing what the Constitution actually 
says with what they as judges thought it ought to have said. There are seri-
ous policy arguments both for and against capital punishment — but given 
that the constitutional text twice explicitly authorizes capital punishment, 
the only proper way to change that would be a constitutional amendment as 
laid down in Article V of the Constitution. And an amendment is unlikely to 
be passed, because large majorities of the American people have consistently 
supported capital punishment for the very worst criminals. Accordingly, a 
judge imposing his or her views on the issue is not only unconstitutional, it is 
also undemocratic.
Chief Justice Rehnquist, for whom I had the honor of clerking, was an origi-
nal dissenter from the Court’s opinion striking down the death penalty. And, 
over his three decades on the Court, he helped overturn that decision and 
return the Court to a more limited view of judicial authority. Indeed, the very 
last opinion he ever wrote was a case I was privileged to litigate for the State 
of Texas, Van Orden v. Perry, which upheld the Texas Ten Commandments 
monument and repudiated many years of judicial hostility to expressions of 
religious faith (discussed in Chapter 14).
Likewise, in 2008, the Supreme Court decided District of Columbia v. Heller, 
holding for the fi rst time that the Second Amendment protects an individual 
right to keep and bear arms (discussed in depth in Chapter 15). Texas led 
31 states in defense of the Second Amendment in that case, and our argu-
ments for giving force to the plain text of the Constitution and the original 
understanding of the Framers prevailed by a vote of 5 to 4.
The Constitution is designed to limit government and to protect all the free-
doms that you and I cherish as Americans. And this book is a clear, straight-
forward roadmap to understanding how it works — and a lot more.

Introduction
O
kay, so you bought this book (or you got it as a present, or you bor-
rowed it, or you’re browsing through it in a bookstore). Obviously, 
you have some interest in the U.S. Constitution, but maybe you’re afraid the 
Constitution isn’t really that interesting.
Well, you’re in luck. Even if you don’t find the Constitution itself to be the 
most riveting read, it’s a never-ending source of debates and arguments. And 
we all know how interesting debates and arguments can be!
About This Book
This book explains the Constitution simply and thoroughly, including all the 
juicy controversy it evokes. Whether you’re a student, a lawyer, or just a con-
cerned citizen, I hope you find it to be both a good read and a great resource.
You don’t have to read this book from cover to cover, and you don’t have to 
read the chapters in order. I’ve written each chapter so it can be understood 
on its own; if it refers to topics that aren’t covered in that chapter, I tell you 
where to find information about that topic elsewhere in the book. Using 
the Table of Contents or the Index, feel free to identify topics of the great-
est interest to you, and dive in wherever you want. Even if you dive into the 
middle or end first, I promise I won’t let you get lost.
I cover the entire Constitution in this book, but I don’t give each article or 
amendment equal attention. That’s because some parts are more important, 
more difficult to understand, more controversial, or more relevant to modern 
society than others. If I believe a particular part of the Constitution requires 
or deserves more explanation than another, I give it lots of real estate in the 
pages that follow. Parts that are easier to understand or less important to 
your 21st-century life get less space in the book.
Throughout the book, I offer not just facts but also a variety of opinions 
about constitutional issues that have created debate for more than 200 years. 
In some cases, the opinions belong to Supreme Court justices, advocates for 
or against specific rights, or any number of other sources. In other cases, the 

2
U.S. Constitution For Dummies 
opinions are my own — and I alert you to that fact. I may sometimes try to 
persuade you of the rightness or wrongness of a certain opinion, but you’re 
welcome to disagree — that’s the fun and the privilege of becoming a more 
informed citizen!
Conventions Used in This Book
Whenever I quote or refer to a specific part of the Constitution, I tell you the 
name of that part. You’ll often see this reference in the form of an article, 
a section, and maybe a clause — for example, Article I, Section 8, Clause 3. 
If you turn to the Appendix at the back of the book, where the text of the 
Constitution is provided, you can see that it’s broken into seven articles, some 
of which are divided into sections. If a section contains more than one para-
graph, I refer to each paragraph as a clause. So if you’re looking for Clause 3 
within Section 8 of Article I, just find the third paragraph in that section.
The amendments to the Constitution appear in the Appendix after the main 
body of the document (and after the list of people who signed it). It’s pretty 
easy to locate an amendment, as long as you aren’t too rusty on Roman 
numerals.
When you see the term the Constitution, it always refers to the U.S. 
Constitution. Each of the 50 states also has its own constitution, but if I’m 
referring to one of those, I include the state name (such as the Virginia 
Constitution). Similarly, when I refer to the Supreme Court, the high court, or 
just the Court, that means the U.S. Supreme Court. If I refer to a state supreme 
court, I always give the name of the state concerned (such as the Texas 
Supreme Court).
You can’t learn about the Constitution without being introduced to some 
legal, political, and other jargon, but I do my best in this book to ease you 
into the constitutional vocabulary. If I use a term that I suspect may not be 
familiar to you, I put that term in italic and provide a definition or explanation 
nearby.
What You’re Not To Read
This may seem like a strange topic to discuss — after all, I’d love for you to 
read every word that I’ve written! But the beauty of the For Dummies series 
is that I won’t demand such commitment. If you’re not interested in knowing 

3
 Introduction
every nitty-gritty detail about a certain subject, there are two types of text 
you can skim or skip altogether:
 
✓ Paragraphs that have a Technical Stuff icon next to them: In just a 
minute, I explain what the various icons in this book mean. This one 
means that the information in a given paragraph goes into detail that 
may be interesting to some readers but isn’t essential to your under-
standing of the subject at hand.
 
✓ Sidebars: The text tucked into gray boxes is also optional. Sidebars con-
tain in-depth historical information, somewhat technical explanations of 
legal or political situations, or just interesting stories that happen to be 
tangential to the topic at hand. Take them or leave them — it’s your call.
How This Book is Organized
I’ve divided the book into six parts, each of which contains a series of related 
chapters. Here’s a bird’s-eye view of the way the book is arranged.
Part I: Exploring Constitutional Basics
This part of the book explains the basic concepts underlying the Constitution 
and the motivating forces behind its creation. I present the basic concepts 
of the Constitution and where they came from. You may find a few surprises 
here. For example, the Constitution didn’t originally establish a democracy — 
the word democracy doesn’t appear even once in the entire document.
I also explain the different approaches to interpreting the Constitution 
and how those approaches can conflict. And I then show you how the 
Constitution has changed in the past 200-plus years in both formal ways 
(through relatively few amendments) and informal ways (as a result of 
the way the U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted and reinterpreted the 
Constitution).
Part II: We the People: How the 
United States Is Governed
In this part, I first study who wields power in the United States, considering 
how that power is shared among “We the People,” the President, Congress, 
the Supreme Court, and possibly other entities.

4
U.S. Constitution For Dummies 
The Framers of the Constitution (the men who wrote and ratified it) were anx-
ious to prevent the concentration of power in the hands of one person or one 
government institution, so they designed an elaborate structure to make sure 
that power was shared. They did so first by creating a federal government: 
one in which power is shared between the national and state governments. In 
Chapter 7, I explore how that power-sharing arrangement works.
In Chapter 8, I discuss another way in which power is shared: among the 
three branches of the federal government — the Executive (the President 
and his Cabinet), the Legislature (Congress), and the Judiciary (the Supreme 
Court and other federal courts).
Perhaps the biggest tug-of-war between the federal government and the 
states has centered on the power given to Congress in the Commerce Clause 
of the Constitution. In Chapter 9, I explain why this power is so important, 
how judicial interpretation has broadened it (and has recently reined it in 
slightly), and why the whole issue matters so much.
Part III: Balancing the Branches 
of Government: The President, 
Congress, and the Judiciary
This part tackles the three main parts of the U.S. government — the 
Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches — as well as how members of 
those branches can be fired or removed.
I open this part by focusing on the President, covering such topics as how 
the President is elected, what it means to be commander in chief, how a pres-
ident makes appointments, and whether (and when) a president is immune 
from lawsuits. I then turn my attention to Congress, explaining the member-
ship and the important functions of the House of Representatives and Senate. 
Chapter 12, on the judiciary, explains how the justices of the Supreme Court 
and other federal judges are appointed, the powers of the Supreme Court, 
and how the Court operates.
I finish this part with a discussion of impeachment, explaining why it’s pos-
sible to be impeached but not convicted (and therefore not removed from 
office), what the impeachment process is, and who has been impeached 
since the Constitution was ratified.

5
 Introduction
Part IV: The Bill of Rights: Specifying 
Rights through Amendments
Here I discuss the first ten amendments to the Constitution, which were all rati-
fied together in 1791 (only three years after the main body of the Constitution). 
These amendments are commonly referred to as the Bill of Rights because they 
confer or guarantee fundamental civil rights, including the right to freedom 
of speech and assembly; the separation of church and state; the right to bear 
arms; the guarantee of a fair trial; the protection of private property rights; and 
the prohibition of “cruel and unusual punishments.”
Part V: Addressing Liberties and 
Modifying the Government: 
More Amendments
In this part, I discuss the ragbag of amendments that have been ratified since 
1791, including amendments that have reformed presidential elections, abol-
ished slavery, ensured equal protection, prohibited alcohol and then made 
it legal again, given voting rights to women, and limited presidents to two 
elected terms.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
This part contains three short chapters: one that outlines ten landmark 
Supreme Court cases that have tackled constitutional issues; one that dis-
cusses the influence of ten Supreme Court Justices who have served at vari-
ous times in the country’s history; and one that presents two sides of five 
sticky constitutional issues that are bound to be debated for years to come.
Icons Used in This Book
Throughout this book, you find small pictures in the margins. These icons 
highlight paragraphs that contain certain types of information. Here’s what 
each icon means:

6
U.S. Constitution For Dummies 
 
The Remember icon sits beside paragraphs that contain information that’s 
worth committing to memory. Even if you’re not studying for an exam on the 
Constitution, you may want to read these paragraphs twice.
 
This icon denotes material that may fall into the “too much information” cate-
gory for some readers. If you like to know lots of details about a topic, the 
information in these paragraphs may thrill you. If details aren’t your thing, feel 
free to skip these paragraphs altogether.
 
The Constitution is nothing if not controversial, and this icon highlights para-
graphs that explain what all the debate is about. If you want to know why 
people can’t seem to figure out what this document means even after 200-plus 
years, head toward these icons.
 
Where there’s debate, there are opinions, and I won’t pretend not to have 
some of my own. Where you see this icon, you’ll know that I’m offering my per-
spective on the subject at hand, and I don’t necessarily expect you to agree!
Where To Go from Here
That depends on why you’re reading this book. If you’re a student who needs 
help understanding how and why the Constitution was created, what it says, 
and why it’s still so important, I’d suggest that you start at the beginning.
If you picked up this book because you want to understand the debate about 
a certain issue (such as gun rights), check the Table of Contents or Index and 
flip to the chapter where that debate is explored. (In the case of gun rights, 
that’d be Chapter 15.)
If you’re planning to start a campaign to impeach a government official who 
rubs you entirely the wrong way, perhaps Chapter 13 will be your cup of tea.
If you want to very quickly get a sense of why constitutional issues can cause 
tempers to flare, flip to Chapter 25 and read about just five of the many 
debates that keep people talking.

Part I
Exploring 
Constitutional 
Basics

In this part . . .
T
hese chapters give you a bird’s-eye view of constitu-
tional thought as a whole, starting with the ideas on 
which the Constitution was based and ending with a very 
brief summary of the Constitution as originally ratified 
in 1788 and of some of its amendments. Chapter 5 also 
explains how the Constitution has undergone some 
fundamental changes without formal amendment.

▶ Gaining a bird’s-eye view of the Constitution

M
ost of the stuff written about the Constitution is boring and hard to 
understand. But it doesn’t have to be. And frankly, it shouldn’t be, 
because the Constitution is pretty important — yes, important to you in your 
daily life.
In this book, I do my best to explain the Constitution in simple language. And 
in this chapter, I offer a broad introduction to the Constitution: what it is, 
who created it, the principles it does and doesn’t discuss, and the areas of 
controversy that keep it in the headlines even today.
Defining “Constitution”
First, what exactly is a constitution? Okay, here goes. A constitution is a sort 
of super-law that regulates the way a country or state is run. How helpful is 
that as a definition? Not very? So let’s be more specific, and this time let’s 
focus specifically on the Constitution of the United States.
The U.S. Constitution is the supreme law of the nation controlling the follow-
ing main features (plus a few more):

10
Part I: Exploring Constitutional Basics 
 
✓ The functions and powers of the different branches of the government: 
the President, the Congress, and the courts
 
✓ The way in which the President and the Congress are elected and how 
federal judges are appointed
 
✓ The way government officials — including the President and the judges — 
can be fired
 
✓ The relationship between the federal government and the states
 
✓ Your rights as a citizen or inhabitant of the United States
Knowing When and Why the 
Constitution Was Created
The Constitution emerged from a meeting called the Philadelphia Convention, 
which took place in 1787. (That meeting has since come to be known also as 
the Constitutional Convention.) The Convention was held because the Articles 
of Confederation — the document that had been serving as the country’s first 
governing constitution — were considered to be weak and problematic (see 
Chapter 2). The stated goal of the Convention was to revise the Articles of 
Confederation, but the outcome was much more than a mere revision: It was 
a new form of government.
The 55 delegates to the Philadelphia Convention came to be known as the 
Framers of the Constitution. They represented 12 of the 13 states (Rhode 
Island didn’t send a delegate), and they included some familiar names, such 
as George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, and James Madison.
The Convention lasted from May 25 to September 17, 1787. In the end, only 39 
of the 55 delegates actually signed the Constitution. Three delegates refused 
to sign it, and the rest had left the Convention before the signing took place.
In order for the Constitution to take effect, it had to be ratified — or 
confirmed — by nine states. Special conventions were summoned in each 
state, and the Delaware, New Jersey, and Georgia conventions ratified the 
Constitution unanimously. But some of the other states saw a pretty fierce 
battle for ratification. In New York, for example, the Constitution was ratified 
only by 30 votes to 27.
Ratification was achieved in 1788, and the Constitution took effect with the 
swearing in of President George Washington and Vice President John Adams 
on April 30, 1789.

11
 Chapter 1: Constitutional Law: The Framework for Governance 
Summarizing the Main Principles 
of the Constitution
In broad strokes, here are the principles you find in the Constitution:
 
✓ Liberty: The Framers of the Constitution aimed to establish a form of 
government that gave the people as much individual freedom as pos-
sible, by guaranteeing them
 
• Religious freedom
 
• Freedom of speech
 
• Freedom to defend themselves with arms
 
✓ Federalism: The United States started out as 13 separate British colo-
nies, which banded together to throw off the British yoke. At first, in 
1777, the colonies formed a loose alliance under the so-called Articles of 
Confederation (not to be confused with the similarly named Confederacy 
proclaimed by the seceding southern states in the 1860s). But the need 
for a stronger central government resulted in the drafting of the U.S. 
Distinguishing the Founders from the Framers
The term Founding Fathers was (probably) 
coined by President Warren G. Harding about 
100 years ago. Founding Fathers, or simply 
Founders, refers to the political leaders of the 
struggle for American independence against 
Britain. It includes the American leaders in 
the Revolutionary War, the signatories of the 
Declaration of Independence, and also the 
Framers of the Constitution.
The Founders include George Washington, 
Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, John 
Jay, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James 
Madison, James Monroe, Patrick Henry, and 
Tom Paine.
The term Founding Fathers overlaps somewhat 
with the term Framers of the Constitution, but 
the two terms are not identical in meaning. The 
term Founders is much broader than the term 
Framers because it covers all the leaders in the 
fight for American independence, including all 
the delegates to the Philadelphia Convention 
that drafted the Constitution. So all the Framers 
were Founders, but not all the Founders were 
Framers!
Thomas Jefferson, for example, drafted the 
Declaration of Independence and was one 
of the leading Founders of the United States. 
But he was not involved in the drafting of the 
Constitution because he was on official busi-
ness in France at the time. So Jefferson was 
a very prominent Founder, but he was not a 
Framer.

12
Part I: Exploring Constitutional Basics 
Constitution, which was ratified in its original, unamended form in 1788. 
The Constitution established a federal system of government, which 
gave the central or federal government certain clearly defined and 
limited powers, reserving the remaining powers to the states or to the 
people.
 
✓ Separation of powers: The Framers of the Constitution were very 
anxious to prevent any one person or institution from becoming too 
powerful. So the Constitution keeps the three branches of government 
separate. These branches are the Executive (the President), Legislative 
(Congress), and Judicial (the law courts). But a system of “checks and 
balances” cuts across this separation. So, for example, Congress passes 
laws, but the President can veto them. Similarly, the President has the 
power to appoint Cabinet officers and federal judges, but his appoint-
ments are subject to the “advice and consent” of the Senate. And the 
Supreme Court can check any perceived abuse of the power of Congress 
by striking down laws that the court rules are unconstitutional.
 
✓ Due process: “Due process of law” is one of the main buzz-phrases of the 
Constitution — according to the Supreme Court. You may assume that 
this phrase would refer simply to procedure, or how things should be 
done, like whether or not you are allowed a jury trial. But the Supreme 
Court has widened its interpretation of the phrase greatly to include 
substantive due process, or what rights the Constitution actually confers 
or protects. As a result, the court has interpreted the Constitution as 
guaranteeing a bunch of controversial “fundamental rights,” including
 
• An expansion of the rights of those suspected or accused of crimes
 
• An expansion of minority rights
 
• Privacy
 
• Abortion
Here are some of the principles you may assume are addressed in the 
Constitution, but aren’t:
 
✓ Democracy: The words democracy and democratic don’t figure anywhere 
in the text of the Constitution. In its original form, the Constitution was 
not democratic, and the House of Representatives was the only directly 
elected part of the federal government. The Constitution became demo-
cratic as a result of the rise of President Andrew Jackson’s Democratic 
Party in the 1830s (see Chapter 6).

13
 Chapter 1: Constitutional Law: The Framework for Governance 
 
✓ Equality: Equality was also not one of the principles of the Constitution 
in its original form.
 
• Slavery formed an integral part of the Constitution until the Civil 
War. For example, Article IV, Section 2, Clause 3 provided in its 
original, unamended form that runaway slaves who escaped from 
a slave state to a free state had to be “delivered up” to their origi-
nal owners. The whole structure of the House of Representatives 
also depended on slavery. In its original form, Article I, Section 2 
of the Constitution apportioned the representation of the various 
states according to the numbers of their free population — plus 
three-fifths of their slaves. This “three-fifths rule” cynically used 
the slave population (who of course didn’t have the right to vote) 
to give the slave states more representation in the House than they 
would otherwise have had.
 
• Women didn’t have the right to vote until 1920.
 
• To this day, the interpretation of the anti-discrimination amend-
ments to the Constitution remains highly controversial. The most 
controversial amendment is the Fourteenth, which can be invoked 
either in support of affirmative action or in opposition to it. Those 
Supreme Court justices who support affirmative action see it 
as a necessary part of the antidiscriminatory thrust of the Due 
Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, while those justices 
who oppose affirmative action see it as itself just another form of 
discrimination.
The Federalist Papers
When the U.S. Constitution emerged from the 
Philadelphia Convention after being signed by 
delegates from each of the 12 participating 
states, it still had to be ratified, or confirmed, by 
the states, each of which summoned a special 
convention for this purpose. Fierce controversy 
reigned.
In October 1787, Alexander Hamilton, a lead-
ing member of the Convention and a dedi-
cated upholder of the Constitution, started 
publishing a series of articles explaining and 
justifying the Constitution. Hamilton got James 
Madison, another leading Convention delegate, 
to join him. John Jay, another Founding Father 
(although not a Convention delegate) also con-
tributed some articles.
The series of articles was titled The Federalist 
and was described as “a Collection of Essays 
written in favor of the New Constitution.” 
Hamilton himself wrote 51 of the 85 articles, 
Madison contributed 27, and Jay wrote five.
Although they were written before the 
Constitution took effect, these essays show 
tremendous insight into the problems of gov-
ernment and have been cited ever since as 
embodying an authoritative interpretation of 
the Constitution.

Part I: Exploring Constitutional Basics 
Identifying Some Areas of Controversy
The whole text of the Constitution takes up just a few pages of print; see the 
Appendix if you don’t believe me. So why do you need to read a book this 
long in order to understand it? The old-fashioned language of the Constitution 
sometimes needs to be explained. And there are a few — actually surprisingly 
few — genuine ambiguities in the text. But, for the most part, you can blame 
it on the lawyers and the judges — particularly the U.S. Supreme Court — 
who have made a major production out of a pretty simple, straightforward 
document.
How come there is such major disagreement about what the Constitution 
means? There are essentially three reasons:
 
✓ Old-fashioned language: The English language has changed since the 
horse-and-buggy era when most of the Constitution was written (but per-
haps not as much as you may think). Consider the following examples:
 
• Article III, Section 3 contains the phrase “Aid and Comfort” in con-
nection with committing treason. Does this mean that you’ll go to 
jail if you give the enemy milk and cookies? Not quite. The phrase 
was lifted straight out of the old English Treason Act of 1351. The 
word comfort comes from a Latin root meaning to strengthen. So, 
giving the enemy “Aid and Comfort” means actively assisting the 
enemy and strengthening him, whether by means of arms, money, 
or intelligence.
 
• The biggest changes have occurred in punctuation. So, for exam-
ple, the Fifth Amendment ends with this prohibition: nor shall 
private property be taken for public use, without just compensation. 
Some commentators have claimed to notice a smudge in the origi-
nal handwritten version of the Bill of Rights, which they take to 
be a comma between “taken” and “for,” making “for public use” a 
bracketed phrase. They conclude from this that the Constitution 
allows the government to take private property for purposes other 
than “for public use.”
 
 Even if there’s meant to be an additional comma in there, this 
interpretation is plainly wrong. First, in the 18th century commas 
were strewn around much more liberally than today, without 
affecting the meaning. Second, the idea that the government can 
just take private property whenever it feels like it goes clean 
against the whole tone and tenor of the Constitution.

15
 Chapter 1: Constitutional Law: The Framework for Governance 
 
✓ Ambiguity: There are a few passages in the Constitution where the 
meaning is genuinely in doubt. Here are two examples:
 
• Do individuals have the right “to keep and bear Arms”? 
The Supreme Court says yes, but the wording of the Second 
Amendment is not at all clear. I discuss this important question in 
Chapter 12 and Chapter 15.
 
• If the President dies, does the Vice President become President 
or only Acting President? Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution is 
genuinely ambiguous. The Twenty-Fifth Amendment, which came 
along only in 1967, says that in these circumstances the Veep does 
become President. But the problem was actually solved in prac-
tice by John Tyler, back in 1841. See Chapters 10 and 22 for all the 
details.
 
✓ Interpretation: Many of the disputes about the meaning of the 
Constitution arise out of different approaches to constitutional interpre-
tations by justices of the Supreme Court. Some of these disagreements 
boil down to political differences between the members of the court. 
Here are just a few of the most controversial constitutional issues:
 
• Can Congress pass any laws it likes? The Supreme Court says no. 
But some commentators disagree with this interpretation and read 
Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution very widely. In particular, 
they interpret the power of Congress to “pay the Debts and pro-
vide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United 
States” as meaning that Congress can pass any laws it likes. This 
reading is almost certainly wrong, and James Madison said so him-
self. I tackle this question particularly in Chapter 9.
 
• Does the President have the power to lock up “enemy combat-
ants” and deny them access to the U.S. courts? In the 2008 case 
Boumediene v. Bush, by a majority of 5 to 4, the U.S. Supreme Court 
said no.
 
• Is the death penalty kosher? Yes, but it does depend on the 
method used. Lethal injection is now the favored method — and 
the Supreme Court says it’s not “cruel and unusual punishment.” 
But the Supreme Court has also held that it’s unconstitutional to 
execute minors and the mentally ill.
 
• Can a school district assign students to public high schools on 
the basis of race alone? In 2007, by 5 votes to 4, the Supreme 
Court said no. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts 
held that “The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to 
stop discriminating on the basis of race.”

16
Part I: Exploring Constitutional Basics 
 
• Is gay marriage unconstitutional? Marriage doesn’t figure in the 
U.S. Constitution at all. It’s a matter for the states. Some states now 
allow same-sex marriages, but these unions are not recognized as 
marriages under federal law because of the Defense of Marriage 
Act (DOMA) of 1996. However, Article IV, Section 1 of the U.S. 
Constitution requires each state to give “Full Faith and Credit” to 
“the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other 
State.” So, a gay marriage contracted in one state may have to be 
recognized by all other states as well. This question has not yet 
been decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. Watch this space.
 
• Are states allowed to secede from the Union? The Supreme Court 
says no. The last time secession was tried, it took a civil war to end 
it. Since that time a number of groups have advocated the seces-
sion of a state, a city, or a tribe, but no serious attempt has been 
made. (One such group, the Alaskan Independence Party, hit the 
news during the 2008 election campaign because of alleged links 
with Sarah Palin, the Republican vice presidential candidate.)
 
• Is it okay to display the Ten Commandments in a courthouse? In 
2005, the U.S. Supreme Court decided in a 5–4 split that displaying 
the Ten Commandments on a Kentucky courthouse wall violated 
the First Amendment’s requirement of separation between church 
and state. But a display of the Ten Commandments in the grounds 
of the Texas State Capitol in Austin, Texas, was held by the same 
margin to be permissible.
This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to constitutional controver-
sies, and I devote a good deal of space in this book to sifting through them 
and offering my own humble opinions of the Supreme Court’s interpretations. 
If the Constitution weren’t a source of so much debate within the halls of 
government, perhaps it wouldn’t be nearly as interesting to read and learn 
about. Luckily for you, that isn’t the case!

Framing the U.S. Constitution: 
Big Thinkers, Big Thoughts
In This Chapter
▶ Recognizing the influence of Magna Carta
▶ Adhering to the rule of law
▶ Noting influences on the Declaration of Independence
▶ Writing republicanism into the founding documents
T
he United States started out as 13 British colonies that overthrew the 
British yoke — which was no joke at all! The American Revolution and 
the War of Independence led to the birth of a new nation and a new form of 
government enshrined in a written constitution — which, with a number of 
changes, has survived for more than 200 years.
Although the Unites States was born out of a bitter struggle with Britain, the 
leading citizens of the new nation — including the Framers of the Constitution 
(see Chapter 1) — were of British stock. They were educated men steeped in 
English law and familiar with British political institutions and philosophy.
No wonder, then, that the U.S. Constitution drew on these British sources — 
but no wonder either that it departed from British traditions in some major 
ways too, sometimes deliberately and sometimes accidentally.
In this chapter, I discuss some of the British constitutional documents, politi-
cal writings, and doctrines that were most venerated by the Founders of the 
United States, including:
 
✓ Magna Carta
 
✓ Habeas corpus
 
✓ The rule of law
 
✓ Natural law
 
✓ The consent of the governed
 
✓ Republicanism

18
Part I: Exploring Constitutional Basics 
Building on Magna Carta
Magna Carta (Latin for “Great Charter”) is a document dating back to the year 
1215 containing a number of concessions made by King John of England to 
his rebellious barons.
What relevance could this kind of document possibly have to the United 
States nearly six centuries later? Magna Carta was used by the Founding 
Fathers as a justification for the Declaration of Independence and later as a 
precedent for some features of the U.S. Constitution.
Such is the veneration accorded this document in the United States that in 
1957 the American Bar Association erected a memorial to Magna Carta in 
England. And a 1297 reissue of Magna Carta (recently sold at auction for $21.3 
million!) sits in a glass case in the National Archives rotunda in Washington 
D.C. — right beside the original texts of the Declaration of Independence and 
the U.S. Constitution.
If you take the trouble to read Magna Carta, you’ll probably find it just about 
as riveting as a phonebook — even if you speak Latin at home, because that 
is the language in which Magna Carta is written.
The good bits of Magna Carta are few and far between. Here’s the most 
quoted provision:
No free man shall be arrested or imprisoned, or deprived of his rights or 
property, or outlawed or exiled . . . except by the lawful judgment of his 
equals or by the law of the land.
Here are a few examples of ways Magna Carta may have influenced the 
Founding Fathers, as evidenced in the Declaration of Independence and the 
U.S. Constitution:
 
✓ Taxation without representation: Did Magna Carta prohibit taxation 
without representation? Clause 12 of the original promised “no scutage 
or aid shall be imposed on our kingdom, except by the common coun-
cil of our kingdom.” Scutage and aid were two feudal taxes on knights 
and barons alone. But did this mean that a tax could be imposed only 
with the consent of those subject to it? Possibly. The American patriots 
sure thought so. When in 1765 the British Parliament passed the Stamp 
Act taxing everything from newspapers to playing cards and dice, the 
Massachusetts Assembly declared the act “against the Magna Carta 
and the natural rights of Englishmen, and therefore . . . null and void.” I 
discuss the concept of “the consent of the governed” in connection with 
the Declaration of Independence later in the chapter.

19
 Chapter 2: Framing the U.S. Constitution: Big Thinkers, Big Thoughts
 
✓ Trial by jury: Did Magna Carta — in particular the clause quoted earlier 
in this section — guarantee trial by jury? The clause supposedly guaran-
teed everyone the right to be tried by their “equals,” or fellow citizens. 
In fact, this right took a lot longer to be established in England — and 
it has now largely been lost there, except in cases of serious crime. But 
the right to a jury trial sure is alive and well in the United States and is 
enshrined in the Sixth and Seventh amendments to the Constitution, 
which I deal with in Chapter 18.
 
✓ Habeas corpus: Did Magna Carta guarantee habeas corpus — the right 
to take legal action to end unlawful detention? Not exactly, but Magna 
Carta was a trailblazer for this later right. The passage from Magna Carta 
quoted earlier in this section promises that nobody is to be imprisoned 
except after a proper trial. But this right didn’t become available right 
away. As late as 1628, King Charles I had five knights imprisoned “by his 
majesty’s special commandment.” Habeas corpus became a major issue 
in the ensuing English Revolution, resulting in Charles I’s execution. 
Habeas corpus was eventually incorporated into statute in 1679.
 
 This important right is now enshrined in Article I, Section 9 of the U.S. 
Constitution: “The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be 
suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public 
Safety may require it.” Habeas corpus is a hot ticket issue as I write these 
words — in particular, with regard to detention in Guantanamo Bay.
Respecting the Rule of Law 
(Or the Rule of Lawyers?)
The rule of law is commonly regarded as a fundamental principle of the 
Western world, and of the United States in particular. The phrase rule of law 
sounds impressive. But what exactly does it mean?
At its simplest, the rule of law just means that nobody is above the law. This 
principle was used as a stick to beat the old absolute monarchs of Europe — 
like King Louis XIV of France, who famously boasted, “I am the state,” or even 
the weak Louis XVI, who is reported as asserting, “It’s legal because I wish it.”
The counterblast to such exorbitant claims was put by the English politi-
cal philosopher James Harrington as “the empire of laws and not of men.” 
John Adams adapted this concept slightly and introduced it into the 
Massachusetts Constitution of 1780 as “A government of laws and not of 
men.” In its most euphonious form, it became “A government not of men but 
of laws.” This high-sounding ideal was echoed by Chief Justice John Marshall 
in the leading case of Marbury v. Madison (see Chapter 23).

20
Part I: Exploring Constitutional Basics 
 
But how can law rule? Laws are just words on paper. They are therefore sub-
ject to interpretation — by courts, judges, and lawyers (who argue their inter-
pretations of laws to the courts and hope that their interpretations will be 
accepted). An anonymous wag put his finger on this truth and retorted that 
what the Founding Fathers were really likely to establish was “A government 
not of laws, but of lawyers.”
This throwaway line has proved prophetic, and even some Supreme Court 
justices have admitted that the meaning of the U.S. Constitution changes 
in accordance with the changing views of the court. In the words of Chief 
Justice Charles Evans Hughes, “We are under a Constitution, but the 
Constitution is what the judges say it is.”
 
This oft-quoted remark comes from a speech that Hughes gave as governor of 
New York in 1907, long before becoming a Supreme Court justice. But he was 
already pompous enough to add, “and the judiciary is the safeguard of our 
liberty and our property under the Constitution.” Susette Kelo, who nearly 
lost her lovely salmon-pink Victorian cottage because of a particularly unjust 
decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2005, would probably not agree with 
Hughes’s comment! (See my discussion of eminent domain in Chapter 17.)
The principle of the rule of law doesn’t figure in the U.S. Constitution in 
so many words. The closest thing to the rule of law that appears in the 
Constitution is the Supremacy Clause in Article VI, which reads as follows:
This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in 
Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the 
Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the 
Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution 
or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.
This clause clearly places federal law above state law, but does it give the 
U.S. Constitution higher status than the rest of federal law? Article V sure 
makes it difficult to amend the Constitution, but that in itself doesn’t prove 
that the Constitution trumps all other laws.
Chief Justice John Marshall, in the case of Marbury v. Madison, went to great 
lengths to show that the Constitution has higher status than any other 
law and that “a law repugnant to the Constitution is void.” This was a new 
judge-made principle and enabled the Supreme Court to arrogate to itself 
the power of judicial review — which was to become its strongest weapon 
against the other branches of the federal government. See Chapter 23 for a 
full discussion of Marbury v. Madison.
The power of the Supreme Court to strike down laws found to be unconsti-
tutional is now taken for granted. But was that the intention of the Founding 
Fathers? Thomas Jefferson objected strongly to the way the Supreme Court 

21
 Chapter 2: Framing the U.S. Constitution: Big Thinkers, Big Thoughts
“usurped” the right “of exclusively explaining the Constitution,” commenting 
that, “The Constitution on this hypothesis is a mere thing of wax in the hands 
of the judiciary, which they may twist and shape into any form they please.”
A more accurate prediction about the Constitution would be hard to find!
Analyzing the Concepts Underlying 
the Declaration of Independence
The American colonists had an ambivalent attitude toward the British 
Constitution. Their leaders steeped themselves in the traditions of the British 
Constitution and generally identified with the revolutionary spirit that had 
led to the execution of one king — Charles I in 1649 — and the expulsion 
of another — James II in 1689. They regarded themselves as entitled to the 
same rights as natural-born Englishmen but found themselves treated at best 
as second-class subjects.
At first they appealed to King George III for redress of their grievances. But 
when their heartfelt pleas fell on deaf ears, they decided to throw off the 
British yoke altogether and declare their independence.
But on what basis could they justify this revolutionary step? Although they 
felt excluded from the British Constitution — because they were denied a 
voice in the British Parliament — they invoked the principles underlying 
Britain’s embryonic democratic system, most notably the principles of 
“No taxation without representation” and “government by consent of the 
governed.”
Thomas Jefferson took just 17 days to construct the case for American inde-
pendence in the Declaration of Independence, whose rolling prose and unfor-
gettable phrases were based on a blend of traditional British principles with 
some European ideas.
The Declaration of Independence, adopted on July 4, 1776 by the Second 
Continental Congress, marks the birth of the United States as a new nation — 
or does it? Upon closer inspection, the Declaration actually announces the 
birth of not one but 13 new nations — each of the former colonies being a 
separate nation. See Chapter 7 for more on this aspect of the Declaration.
But, whether the Declaration announced one birth or a litter of 13, it was a 
document essentially justifying the throwing off of British colonial rule.

22
Part I: Exploring Constitutional Basics 
The Founding Fathers were not natural revolutionaries. They were educated, 
well-to-do men of property and pillars of society who wouldn’t normally have 
been mixed up in violence or war. So, what impelled these solid citizens to 
become involved in a bloody conflict that lasted six years?
 
The slogan that first rallied opposition to Britain was “No taxation without rep-
resentation.” The American colonies had elected legislatures, but the British 
parliament could override these colonial legislatures and pass laws without 
consulting them. The Stamp Act of 1765 was an example of this: It slapped a 
tax on everything from newspapers to playing cards and dice — without any 
consultation with the colonists. The high-handedness of this action rankled 
the colonists.
Did the colonists have a legal right to consent to decisions that affected 
them? Not under the British Constitution as understood at the time. So the 
colonists had to look elsewhere.
England had itself had a revolution — or two revolutions, to be precise — in 
the 17th century. The colonists naturally found themselves drawn to the 
rhetoric of those revolutionaries, who had relied a good deal on Magna Carta, 
to which they gave a very broad interpretation.
But Magna Carta wasn’t enough on its own to justify throwing off the British 
colonial yoke. Magna Carta belonged to a bygone feudal age. Most of the 
rights contained in Magna Carta were concessions made by King John to the 
barons and didn’t apply to ordinary people. During the English revolutions of 
the 17th century, the opponents of the Crown glamorized and reinterpreted 
Magna Carta in ways that were not always very convincing. The American 
Founders adopted the same expansive approach to Magna Carta, but they 
also used the following concepts that are reflected in the Declaration of 
Independence:
 
✓ Natural law
 
✓ “[U]nalienable Rights”
 
✓ Consent of the governed
 
✓ Republicanism
Invoking the law of nature
The Declaration of Independence opens with a claim on behalf of the 
American “people” to “the separate and equal station to which the Laws of 
Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them.”
The concept of the law of nature (or natural law) goes back to Ancient Greece 
and Rome, and it was commonly equated with the law of God (or divine law) 
and also with the law of nations.

23
 Chapter 2: Framing the U.S. Constitution: Big Thinkers, Big Thoughts
 
Natural law theory said that man-made law — or positive law — was valid only 
if it conformed to the moral standards laid down by natural law, which was 
rational, universal, unchanging, and everlasting. The only problem with natu-
ral law was that there was no agreement about its content, as it was unwritten 
and existed only in the minds of its adherents. For example, was slavery in 
accordance with natural law? Some natural law advocates said yes, others no.
The Declaration of Independence claimed that the American states were entitled 
to independence from Britain on the basis of the supposed natural law princi-
ple that each nation, or “people,” has the right to national self-determination. 
That supposed principle formed no part of the British Constitution — and 
was not even recognized in international law (with major modifications) until 
the 20th century.
Securing “unalienable Rights”
Natural law was popular among educated Americans in the late 18th century. 
But the problem with natural law was that those who supported it could dis-
agree violently about its content. So, although natural law was relied on by 
the Founders, it provided a pretty shaky foundation for American indepen-
dence. The Declaration of Independence is on firmer ground when it declares 
that it’s the people’s right — and even their duty — to overthrow a despotic 
government and to replace it with a government that will protect their 
“unalienable Rights.”
This assertion is proclaimed in ringing tones:
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that 
they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that 
among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure 
these Rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just 
powers from the consent of the governed.
These are just about the most sacred words of any American founding docu-
ments, but we need to delve just a little beneath their surface. Let’s take a 
look at some of these rolling phrases:
 
✓ We hold these truths to be self-evident: This is an admission that these 
“truths” can’t be proved.
 
✓ All men are created equal: How could this statement be reconciled 
with slavery? Thomas Jefferson himself, the author of the Declaration of 
Independence, was a slave owner, as were many other Founding Fathers. 
Similar wording in the Massachusetts Constitution of 1780 led to a legal 
challenge to slavery in the state courts, which effectively ended slavery 
in that state. But slavery was legally abolished throughout the nation 
only with the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865 (see 
Chapter 20).

24
Part I: Exploring Constitutional Basics 
 
✓ Creator: Does the appearance of this word — and the appeal “to the 
Supreme Judge of the world” later on in the Declaration of Independence — 
mean that the United States is based on acceptance of religious belief? 
The last verse of the U.S. national anthem, “The Star-Spangled Banner,” 
contains the words “And this be our motto: ‘In God is our trust’.” The 
motto “In God We Trust” has appeared on the penny since 1909, and 
since 1956 it has been the official national motto of the United States. 
But is this public display of religious belief in accordance with the First 
Amendment? I discuss this important subject in Chapter 14.
 
✓ Unalienable Rights: The word unalienable — in modern English, 
inalienable — refers to something that can’t be taken away, or even 
given away. Inalienable rights are therefore fundamental rights that 
automatically belong to every human being. They can be seen as God-
given rights or as rights conferred by natural law — similar therefore 
to what are commonly labeled natural rights. Not everybody believes 
that such rights actually exist. The British philosopher Jeremy Bentham 
famously declared, “The idea of rights is nonsense and the idea of natu-
ral rights is nonsense upon stilts.”
 
✓ Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness: This phrase is a variant on 
the phrase “lives, liberty, and property” that appeared in the Articles 
of Association of the First Continental Congress in 1774. The pursuit of 
Happiness is broader than property and harder to pin down. In the case of 
Loving v. Virginia, decided in 1967, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a 
Virginia statute outlawing interracial marriage, on the ground that “The 
freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of the vital personal 
rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.”
 
 Even the term Liberty is hard to define. In Meyer v. Nebraska, the U.S. 
Supreme Court decided in 1923 that a Nebraska law banning the use of 
a foreign language as the medium of instruction to kids in grade school 
was unconstitutional and a denial of the “liberty” protected by the Due 
Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Justice Anthony Kennedy 
commented in 2000 that, had Meyer’s case been decided more recently, 
it would probably have been based not on the Fourteenth Amendment 
but rather on the First Amendment’s protection of freedom of speech, 
belief, and religion.
“Deriving their just powers from 
the consent of the governed”
The Declaration of Independence goes on like this:
[T]o secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving 
their just powers from the consent of the governed.

25
 Chapter 2: Framing the U.S. Constitution: Big Thinkers, Big Thoughts
In other words:
 
✓ The purpose of government is to safeguard the rights of the people.
 
✓ The only legitimate type of government is one based on popular 
consent.
What exactly is meant by “consent of the governed”? By putting these words 
into the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson gave early notice 
that the government of the new United States was to be based on consent. 
New state constitutions soon followed suit, with elected governors and 
legislatures. And the government of the United States itself was designed 
on the same pattern, although it was at first confined, under the Articles of 
Confederation, to a Congress made up of delegates appointed by the state 
legislatures. (I discuss the Articles of Confederation later in this chapter.)
But how genuine was the claim that the governments set up by the American 
patriots did, indeed, govern by consent of the governed? It doesn’t take 
much scrutiny to see that the American Revolution was not a democratic 
revolution. Instead, it was the overthrow of a colonial power by a wealthy 
elite, who then naturally stepped into the shoes of their former colonial 
masters.
In fact, the Framers never claimed to be democrats, and the word democracy 
doesn’t appear anywhere in the U.S. Constitution (see Chapter 1). In estab-
lishment circles in the American colonies — as in England — democracy was 
a dirty word:
 
✓ John Adams, the future president, attacked the proposals of the radi-
cal Thomas Paine as “so democratical, without any restraint or even an 
attempt at equilibrium or counterpoise, that it must produce confusion 
and every evil work.”
 
✓ James Madison, often described as “Father of the Constitution” and also 
a future president, was no fan of democracy either. Indeed, he attacked 
it in even stronger terms than the more conservative Adams. Here’s 
what Madison said about democracy:
 
 Democracy is the most vile form of government . . . democracies have 
ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention: have ever been found 
incompatible with personal security or the rights of property: and have 
in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their 
deaths.
The Founders just didn’t trust the ordinary people and deliberately kept them 
at arm’s length, as can be seen from the way they drafted the Articles of 
Confederation and then the U.S. Constitution. Keep reading to see what I mean.

Part I: Exploring Constitutional Basics 
Establishing a Republic
The Founding Fathers weren’t democrats, so what were they? The concept 
that they embraced was republicanism. John Adams — the same John Adams 
who attacked democracy — waxed lyrical in his praise of republicanism. 
Here’s how Adams defined it:
A government, in which all men, rich and poor, magistrates and subjects, 
officers and people, masters and servants, the first citizen and the last, are 
equally subject to the laws.
As you start reading this definition, you get the impression that it’s going 
to be egalitarian — based on the equality of all people. But the last phrase 
gives the game away. Republicanism, according to this definition, isn’t about 
any power that the people have but about a power that they are under. In a 
republic, says Adams, everybody is equally under the law.
This definition of republicanism ties in with Adams’s better-known statement of 
the goal aimed at by the newly independent states. As I note earlier in the chap-
ter, this objective was so fundamental to Adams that he incorporated it into the 
Massachusetts state constitution: “A government of laws and not of men.”
 
Adams’s ideal was not one of people power at all. Rather, his ideal was one in 
which the people were subservient to laws made by an elite group (of which 
he was a prominent member) — with the last word on the interpretation of 
those laws going to judges drawn from the same elite group.
Democracy doesn’t figure in the U.S. Constitution at all — but republicanism 
sure does. Article IV, Section 4 says:
The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican 
Form of Government.
There is no precise definition of Republican, but Adams’s views on the sub-
ject are a reflection of the Framers’ thinking (although Adams himself didn’t 
attend the Constitutional Convention, as he was serving as U.S. ambassador 
to Britain at the time).
Getting rid of the king
The absence of a king is an important aspect of republicanism. The main 
body of the Declaration of Independence is taken up with a long list of griev-
ances against King George III. Most of these grievances start with the word 
“He,” referring to the King in person.

27
 Chapter 2: Framing the U.S. Constitution: Big Thinkers, Big Thoughts
The truth is that King George did not call all the shots personally. He del-
egated a lot of his power to his ministers and, as I explain in the sidebar 
“Powerful Parliament, weak king,” he just didn’t have a great deal of power. 
(Later in life, after the American Revolutionary War, the poor guy was 
replaced by his son as Regent because King George suffered from serious 
mental illness.)
As a result, the King was in reality no longer head of government but only 
head of state — an increasingly purely ceremonial position in which the King 
represented the nation but was under pressure to become politically neutral.
This British model of government in which the head of state is separate from 
the head of government has spread around the world — not only among 
monarchies but also widely among republics, including Germany, Italy, 
Poland, India, and Israel.
 
But the American revolutionaries didn’t understand these subtleties about 
British rule. As far as they were concerned, their main enemy was King 
George. For this reason, among others, the form of government of the United 
States of America wasn’t about to be a monarchy; it would be a republic with 
a president who combined the positions of head of government and head of 
state — in other words, an executive presidency. The Framers never even real-
ized that the separation between head of state and head of government was 
possible, let alone desirable.
Powerful Parliament, weak king
The British monarchy lost a lot of its power 
during the revolutions of the 17th century:
 ✓ The English Civil War between King Charles I 
and Parliament. The King lost the war and, 
after a show trial, he lost his head too, 
in 1649.
 ✓ The so-called “Glorious Revolution” of 
1688–1689, in which King James II was 
deposed from the throne.
The Glorious Revolution enabled Parliament 
to consolidate its power by establishing the 
doctrine of the Sovereignty of Parliament as 
the most fundamental principle of the British 
Constitution. This doctrine meant:
 ✓ That Parliament could make or unmake any 
law it liked.
 ✓ That the King was obliged by convention — 
although not by strict law — to give his con-
sent to any bill passed by both houses of 
Parliament. In fact, no king or queen of the 
United Kingdom has vetoed a bill since 1708.
 ✓ That a law passed by Parliament — known 
as an Act of Parliament — was the highest 
form of law under the British Constitution.
 ✓ That the validity of an Act of Parliament 
could never be challenged in any court of 
law nor declared unconstitutional.

28
Part I: Exploring Constitutional Basics 
Crafting the Articles of Confederation
Hot on the heels of the Declaration of Independence came the Articles of 
Confederation, adopted by the Second Continental Congress in 1777. These 
Articles were the first instrument of government of the fledgling United States 
of America, but they didn’t really establish a single national government.
The Articles of Confederation didn’t establish any national executive or any 
national judiciary. The Congress was the only national institution, and its 
powers were restricted to defense and foreign affairs.
 
How democratic was the Congress? Not at all. The Congress was made up not 
of elected representatives but of delegates appointed by each of the state leg-
islatures for just a year at a time. And the state legislatures themselves weren’t 
that democratic either. The right to vote was restricted to adult white men of 
property.
Distinguishing confederation, federation, and union
The word confederation is not the same as 
federation. Let’s take a moment to disentangle 
these terms.
Confederation: This is the weakest type of 
association between a number of independent 
regions, cantons, or states. The central govern-
ment barely exists at all and is in control only of 
foreign affairs and defense. The best example of 
a confederacy or confederation in the modern 
world is Switzerland.
America has had two totally unconnected con-
federacies at two different times:
 ✓ The confederacy that lasted from 1777 
until 1788, governed by the Articles of 
Confederation. However, the Articles stated 
at the beginning that “The Stile of this 
Confederacy shall be: ‘The United States of 
America.’”
 ✓ The Confederate States of America, the 11 
breakaway southern states that seceded 
from the United States, resulting in the Civil 
War in 1861.
Federation: The U.S. Constitution established 
a federal system of government, in which 
quite extensive powers were delegated to 
the national, or federal, government. But any 
powers not delegated to the federal govern-
ment were — and still are — retained by the 
states or by the people. See more on this topic 
in Chapter 19, which deals with the Tenth 
Amendment.
Union: The word union appears quite a few 
times in the U.S. Constitution in reference to the 
federal government, and it is still often used in 
that sense: for example, the President’s annual 
“State of the Union” address. In fact, union is a 
misnomer as a description of a federal system. 
Strictly speaking, the word union refers to a 
much more centralized system of government 
where all power is concentrated in the national 
government, as in present-day France.

29
 Chapter 2: Framing the U.S. Constitution: Big Thinkers, Big Thoughts
But this lack of democracy was not the reason the Articles of Confederation 
were eventually abandoned in 1788. The problem was that, in the absence 
of any proper national authority, the states started quarreling among them-
selves. George Washington and other leading figures felt the need for more 
central control. This resulted in the calling of a convention in Philadelphia to 
revise the Articles of Confederation. But, instead of merely tinkering with the 
Articles, the convention ended up drafting a whole new instrument of govern-
ment: the U.S. Constitution.
Leaving democracy out of 
the U.S. Constitution
The U.S. Constitution in its original form wasn’t a lot more democratic than 
the Articles of Confederation. Here’s why:
 
✓ The Senate was not originally directly elected, but made up of members 
appointed by the state legislatures.
 
✓ The President was not elected by the people but by an Electoral College. 
The Electoral College system still exists, but, thanks to the rise of politi-
cal parties, it has been short-circuited and is therefore more democratic 
than the Framers ever intended. (I discuss presidential elections in 
Chapter 10.)
 
✓ Even elections to the House of Representatives — the only body directly 
elected under the original version of the U.S. Constitution — were not 
truly democratic, because the right to vote was narrowly restricted in 
the early days of the Republic. It took more than a half century before 
the United States could be described as a democracy. The move-
ment toward democracy was largely the achievement of a political 
party that started out by calling itself the Republican Party, then the 
Democratic-Republican Party, and later, under Andrew Jackson, — who 
was President from 1829 to 1837 — simply the Democratic Party (see 
Chapter 6).

Chapter 3
Debating the Constitution
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding why the Constitution is not self-explanatory
▶ Considering whether some provisions are out-of-date
▶ Exploring ambiguities
▶ Agonizing over major omissions
▶ Analyzing conflicting schools of interpretation
T
he U.S. Constitution is only a few pages long (see the Appendix). It makes 
a pretty neat pocket-size pamphlet.
Why do you need to read this big book when you can just read the 
Constitution itself? One reason is that my publishers need to make a few 
bucks. (It’s not for my benefit — we authors only get peanuts!)
Seriously, though, there are many reasons why everybody — and I do mean 
everybody — needs help to understand the Constitution. I explore these rea-
sons in this chapter so you can begin to understand why this short document 
is such a source of confusion and debate.
Listing Some Sources of Confusion
Here are some of the key reasons the Constitution is such a difficult docu-
ment to digest:
 
✓ Technical language: The Constitution is a statement of law, so it’s not 
surprising that it contains some legal jargon. For example, ratifying an 
amendment is not the same thing as ratting on that amendment! To ratify 
an amendment means to confirm it. To change the Constitution, it’s nec-
essary for an amendment to be proposed and then ratified. (The Fifth 
Amendment deals with the process of amending the Constitution. For 
more on that subject, see Chapter 5.)

32
Part I: Exploring Constitutional Basics 
 
✓ Old-fashioned language: Most of the Constitution was written more 
than 200 years ago. The meanings of some words have changed a bit 
since then. For example, what is the meaning of the word compact — as 
in, “No State shall, without the Consent of the Congress . . . enter into 
any Agreement or Compact with another State, or with a foreign Power”? 
In modern English, compact often refers to something that occupies 
very little space. As a noun, compact can mean a small cosmetic case 
containing face-powder. But in the clause that I just quoted from Article 
I, Section 10 of the Constitution, compact means an agreement or an alli-
ance. So, the quoted words mean that individual states are not allowed 
to pursue their own foreign policy. This provision gives the federal gov-
ernment a lock on foreign policy.
 
✓ Old-fashioned ideas: Just as a lot of the language of the Constitution 
is old-fashioned, so are some of the ideas and values that it expresses. 
For example, the Seventh Amendment guarantees a right to trial by 
jury in any civil suit “where the value in controversy shall exceed 
twenty dollars.” In 1791, when the Bill of Rights (including the Seventh 
Amendment) was ratified, the average wage earner made only about $16 
a week. Times have certainly changed. But in this case, the discrepancy 
is not important. If anything, it’s good that the threshold for jury trial is 
so low, because that means that trial by jury is available for almost all 
civil suits.
 
✓ Obsolete concepts: The Constitution is based on old concepts and 
ideas. But does that mean the Constitution is no longer relevant to the 
present day? Some people have leveled this accusation against the 
Constitution. I examine this serious charge in this chapter (see the sec-
tion “Discarding Out-of-Date Ideas?”).
 
✓ Ambiguity: The Framers of the Constitution were educated, articulate 
men. But even these intellectual giants made a few boo-boos. I take a 
look at some of the unintended ambiguities in the Constitution in this 
chapter (see “Untangling Ambiguities”).
 
✓ Omissions: Some of the most important constitutional concepts and 
institutions don’t actually figure in the text of the Constitution at all. 
These missing features include democracy, political parties, the death 
penalty, privacy, and abortion. The death penalty does at least rate 
a couple of indirect mentions in the text of the Constitution. But the 
rest of these missing concepts don’t get any mentions at all. I tackle 
this topic in the section “Giving Some Important Principles the Silent 
Treatment.”
 
✓ Interpretation: The U.S. Supreme Court has made a lot of major changes 
to the Constitution — without altering a single word of the text. This 
is the most important reason why just picking up and reading the 
Constitution doesn’t really tell you what it means. See the section 
“Interpreting the Constitution” to find out more.

33
 Chapter 3: Debating the Constitution
Discarding Out-Of-Date Ideas?
It’s easy to criticize the Constitution as being past its sell-by date. The 
Framers recognized the danger that later generations might want to keep 
changing the Constitution in accordance with shifting political fashions. 
That’s why the Framers deliberately made the Constitution so difficult to 
amend. (See Chapter 5 for a discussion of the official and unofficial ways that 
the Constitution has been changed.)
Here are just three of the many constitutional provisions that have been 
singled out for attack as obsolete:
 
✓ The right to bear arms, contained in the Second Amendment, has 
always been controversial, but is it also obsolete? That depends on how 
it is interpreted. If you interpret the amendment as giving individuals 
the right to buy and use guns, the amendment appears obsolete to those 
people who view that right as part of a long-gone Wild West culture. 
But that same interpretation is seen as sensible and relevant to modern 
life if viewed from the perspective of human rights — and it is the inter-
pretation now accepted by the Supreme Court. On the other hand, if 
you interpret the Second Amendment as protecting gun ownership and 
usage only by people who participate in state militias, the amendment 
may be seen as obsolete. That’s because the National Guard, which is 
the modern successor to the militia, has since 1933 been a component 
of the U.S. Army (and its members sure don’t have to provide their own 
weapons!). But that narrower interpretation is seen by its supporters as 
relevant to the need for gun control. See Chapter 15 for all the details 
and debates surrounding this amendment.
 
✓ The right to trial by jury, guaranteed for criminal trials by the Sixth 
Amendment and for civil trials by the Seventh Amendment, may be seen 
by some as anachronistic. Jury trial originated in England, but it has 
disappeared there from practically all civil trials, and even in criminal 
trials it is available in far fewer cases than it used to be. However, as a 
practicing trial lawyer, I would prefer to try a case in front of a bunch of 
ordinary folk than in front of any judge you could name.
 
✓ The Electoral College system for picking the President, as laid down 
by Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution and modified by the Twelfth 
Amendment, is often criticized as obsolete because it doesn’t appear to 
be democratic. There is actually a confusion here between two different 
things: the Electoral College system on one hand and, on the other, the 
winner-take-all system.
 
 In most states these two systems are combined. That means that the 
winner of the presidential race in a particular state usually takes all 
the electoral votes of that state. So, if the Democratic candidate gets 
60 percent of the votes in California and the Republican candidate gets 

34
Part I: Exploring Constitutional Basics 
40 percent, all 55 of California’s electoral votes go into the Democratic 
column. But the Constitution doesn’t actually demand this approach. 
The Constitution only says that the electoral vote for a state is calculated 
by adding the number of representatives for that state in the House of 
Representatives to the number of senators (which is always two).
 
 If California preferred, it could adopt a split vote system. For example, 
California could decide to split the electoral vote in the same proportion 
as the popular vote. So, if the Democratic candidate won 60 percent of 
the vote, that candidate would get 60 percent of California’s electoral 
votes, which is 33 votes, and the Republican candidate would get the 
remaining 22.
 
 If every state adopted this form of the Electoral College system, the 
Electoral College system would produce the same result as a straight 
popular-vote system calculated without reference to state boundaries — 
which is what most critics of the Electoral College system are angling for.
 
 Whether a state goes for the winner-take-all system or for a split vote 
system is entirely a matter for that state to decide. At present, Nebraska 
and Maine are the only two states that operate a form of split vote. And 
that system did actually produce a split vote in the 2008 election, with 
Barack Obama getting one electoral vote from Nebraska while the other 
four electoral votes from that state went to John McCain.
Untangling Ambiguities
The Constitution has a reputation for being ambiguous at times. If it weren’t, 
the members of the Supreme Court might have a lot more free time on their 
hands! Consider just two examples:
 
✓ Does the Second Amendment give individual citizens the right “to keep 
and bear Arms”? Or does it restrict the right to members of militias or 
their modern equivalent? James Madison, who drafted the amendment, 
must have known what he intended it to mean, but he didn’t express it 
very clearly. As I explain in Chapter 15, proponents of both sides of the 
gun rights debate find support for their arguments within the murky 
structure of this one-sentence amendment.
 
✓ What happens if the Vice President takes the reins when the President 
dies or resigns? Is the Veep actually the President or just the acting 
President? Article II of the Constitution is clear as mud, and the issue 
became very real when William Henry Harrison died in 1841 and Vice 
President John Tyler took over as President. Tyler refused to be just an 
acting President, and he set a precedent that was followed by every sub-
sequent Veep. But it was only in 1967 that the Twenty-Fifth Amendment 
finally settled the issue in crystal-clear language. For much more detail 
on this topic, see Chapter 4 and Chapter 22.

35
 Chapter 3: Debating the Constitution
Giving Some Important Principles 
the Silent Treatment
The whole idea of a written constitution is to lay everything on the line. Chief 
Justice John Marshall famously remarked, “The government of the United 
States has been emphatically termed a government of laws, and not of men.”
But how can this ambitious ideal ever be achieved if the Constitution omits 
all mention of some of the most important principles on which that constitu-
tion is based?
Here are some important principles and institutions that don’t figure in the 
text of the Constitution at all:
 
✓ Democracy: As I explain in Chapter 1, the words democracy and demo-
cratic don’t figure anywhere in the text of the Constitution. Is the United 
States a democracy? It sure wasn’t in the early days of the Republic.
 
 The Founders didn’t trust the ordinary people. Democracy was a dirty 
word as far as they were concerned. Voting rights were restricted 
to property owners, and the House of Representatives was the only 
directly elected federal institution. Senators were appointed by the state 
legislatures, and the President was elected by an Electoral College. (The 
Electoral College system is still in place today, but it’s now largely nomi-
nal. The existence of parties has short-circuited the Electoral College 
and democratized presidential elections. See my preceding discussion in 
the section “Discarding Out-Of-Date Ideas?”)
 
 The U.S. Constitution doesn’t read as a blueprint for a democracy — 
simply because democracy wasn’t on the agenda as far as the Founders 
were concerned.
 
✓ Political parties: The Constitution contains not a single reference 
to political parties, but political parties are the lifeblood of the 
Constitution. The competition between the parties has turned the 
United States into a democracy.
 
 Parties started crystallizing quite early on, but the Framers didn’t rec-
ognize their importance. As a result, the 1800 presidential election was 
a mess — and the Twelfth Amendment was needed to remedy the situa-
tion. (I discuss the Twelfth Amendment in Chapter 20.)
 
 The United States has always had two main parties competing for power — 
at first Federalists and Democratic Republicans, then later Whigs and 
Democrats, and, since 1854, Republicans and Democrats. This two-party 
system gives voters a choice and prevents power from being concen-
trated in the hands of one group.

36
Part I: Exploring Constitutional Basics 
 
✓ The death penalty: The Constitution doesn’t specifically allow or disal-
low the death penalty, but both the Fifth and the Fourteenth amend-
ments refer to it. The Fifth Amendment opens with these words:
 
 No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous 
crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury.
 
 A capital crime means a crime carrying the death penalty. Which crimes 
were these? The amendment doesn’t say, but it takes it for granted 
that such crimes exist. Murder is the most common capital crime, but 
it’s usually a state crime rather than a federal crime — and the Fifth 
Amendment refers purely to federal law.
 
 The Fourteenth Amendment does refer to state law, and the Due Process 
Clause in Section 1 of that amendment recognizes the death penalty:
 
 nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without 
due process of law.
 
 For a state to deprive somebody of life by due process of law can only 
mean that execution was a recognized sentence in 1868, when the 
Fourteenth Amendment was ratified. So, how come the Constitution 
doesn’t say in so many words that capital punishment is okay as long as 
certain due process is given? Because the Constitution doesn’t restate 
the whole of the criminal law, which had always imposed the death pen-
alty for murder, treason, and other “infamous” crimes.
 
 The presence of these references to capital punishment in the Fifth 
and Fourteenth amendments, side by side with the ban on “cruel and 
unusual punishments” in the Eighth Amendment, makes it crystal clear 
that capital punishment in itself was not viewed as being cruel and 
unusual. However, the mode of execution could well make a difference 
as far as the Eighth Amendment is concerned. For example, execution by 
boiling in oil or by tearing the offender limb from limb would undoubt-
edly qualify as “cruel and unusual punishments.”
 
 Execution by lethal injection is acceptable, according to the 2008 U.S. 
Supreme Court ruling in the case of Baze v. Rees. The case arose out 
of a challenge by two men sentenced to death by lethal injection in 
Kentucky. Ralph Baze was convicted of murdering a sheriff and deputy 
sheriff who were trying to serve him with a warrant. Thomas Bowling 
was convicted of killing a husband and wife after ramming their car. 
The test used by the U.S. Supreme Court for “cruel and unusual punish-
ments” is whether the punishment in question carries the risk of inflict-
ing “unnecessary pain.” In the words of Chief Justice John Roberts, 
writing for the majority on the court, “Kentucky has adopted a method 
of execution believed to be the most humane available, one it shares 
with 35 other States.”

37
 Chapter 3: Debating the Constitution
 
✓ Privacy: The word privacy also doesn’t figure anywhere in the text of the 
Constitution. However, in the case of Griswold v. Connecticut, decided in 
1965, Justice William O. Douglas, writing for the majority, found the right 
to privacy in the “penumbras” formed by “emanations” of guarantees 
contained in the First, Third, Fourth, and Fifth amendments. Concurring 
judgments cited also the Ninth and Fourteenth amendments.
 
 Justice Potter Stewart disagreed, stating: “With all deference, I can find 
no such general right of privacy in the Bill of Rights, in any other part of 
the Constitution, or in any case ever before decided by this Court.” But 
the powerful dissent by Stewart, joined by Justice Hugo Black, wasn’t 
enough to block this far-reaching reinterpretation by the majority on the 
court. (For more on this subject, see Chapter 5.)
 
✓ Abortion: The new-found right to privacy served as the springboard to a 
right of abortion in certain circumstances. This controversial right was 
established by the court in Roe v. Wade, which I discuss in Chapter 5.
Interpreting the Constitution
Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes famously remarked that, “We are under 
a Constitution, but the Constitution is what the judges say it is, and the judi-
ciary is the safeguard of our liberty and our property under the Constitution.” 
The Chief Justice was right to point out that the meaning of the Constitution 
keeps changing as a result of judicial interpretation and reinterpretation, 
without any change in the words on paper.
Hughes was not criticizing the courts for this process but was actually prais-
ing them. Not everyone would agree with this view. Here are some of the rea-
sons for opposing judicial changes to the Constitution:
 
✓ Article V of the Constitution makes it clear that the only way that the 
Constitution can be changed is by formal amendment, which requires a 
two-thirds majority in both houses of Congress and ratification by three-
fourths of the state legislatures.
 
✓ The Framers deliberately made amendment difficult, so that any change 
would command broad general support.
 
✓ The Supreme Court justices are unelected, are appointed for life, and are 
removable only by impeachment. This means that the justices are inde-
pendent and not answerable to the electorate or to anybody else.
 
✓ Supreme Court justices who interpret the Constitution in ways that 
depart from the text are effectively rewriting that document by imposing 
their own views on it.

38
Part I: Exploring Constitutional Basics 
The reply to these points is along the following lines:
 
✓ The Constitution was mostly written more than 200 years ago. It’s 
impossible to get back to the original intention of the Framers — even if 
we wanted to.
 
✓ To remain relevant and meaningful, the Constitution must be interpreted 
afresh by each new generation, as a “living Constitution.”
 
✓ This process of interpretation in the light of changing political, social, 
and moral values does not amount to unauthorized amendment but is 
needed in order to make sense of the Constitution and to apply it to the 
modern age.
Comparing interpretations of “cruel 
and unusual punishments”
The Eighth Amendment’s ban on “cruel and unusual punishments” provides a 
good example for comparing two different approaches to constitutional inter-
pretation: on the one hand, the “living Constitution” approach coupled with 
judicial activism, and, on the other hand, strict constructionism coupled with 
judicial restraint.
During World War II, private Albert Trop was found guilty of desertion and 
was sentenced to three years’ hard labor and a dishonorable discharge 
from the U.S. army. After serving his sentence, Trop applied for a passport. 
It was denied on the ground that he had lost his citizenship because of his 
conviction for desertion. The question before the Supreme Court in Trop v. 
Dulles was whether depriving Trop of his citizenship in this way amounted 
to unconstitutional “cruel and unusual punishments” under the Eighth 
Amendment.
By 5 votes to 4, the high court ruled that depriving Trop of his citizenship 
did indeed infringe on his Eighth Amendment rights. In the words of Chief 
Justice Earl Warren, writing for the majority, “The Amendment must draw its 
meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a 
maturing society.”
The minority rejected this approach as a rewriting of the amendment depart-
ing from the meaning of “cruel and unusual punishments” as understood in 
1791 — and also as an exercise in judicial activism, arrogating to the court 
more power than it was entitled to have.

39
 Chapter 3: Debating the Constitution
Justice Felix Frankfurter’s dissenting opinion, supported by three other jus-
tices, pointed out that desertion from the army in time of war had been a 
capital offense since the first year of independence. Can it be seriously urged, 
asked Frankfurter, “that loss of citizenship is a fate worse than death?”
Frankfurter went on to stress that the court should exercise “with the utmost 
restraint” the “awesome power” to strike down laws passed by Congress and 
approved by the President — “the two branches of our Government directly 
responsive to the will of the people and empowered under the Constitution 
to determine the wisdom of legislation.”
Comparing interpretations 
of partial-birth abortion
In the past several decades, abortion has become a generally reliable litmus 
test to determine the approach to interpretation adopted by a Supreme 
Court justice. So let’s take a look at the court’s handling of the Partial-Birth 
Abortion Ban Act.
In 2003, President George W. Bush signed into law the Partial-Birth Abortion 
Ban Act, which makes it a criminal offense for a physician to carry out a par-
tial-birth abortion. The act defines partial-birth abortion as
An abortion in which the person performing the abortion, deliberately and 
intentionally vaginally delivers a living fetus until, in the case of a head-
first presentation, the entire fetal head is outside the body of the mother, 
or, in the case of breech presentation, any part of the fetal trunk past the 
navel is outside the body of the mother, for the purpose of performing an 
overt act that the person knows will kill the partially delivered living fetus; 
and performs the overt act, other than completion of delivery, that kills the 
partially delivered living fetus.
The act was generally welcomed by pro-life opinion — people opposed to 
abortion — and opposed by pro-choice advocates — people in favor of abor-
tion rights.
 
The constitutionality of the act was immediately challenged in Gonzales v. 
Carhart, which was heard by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2007. The result was 
a cliffhanger, with a 5–4 decision in favor of the act. The lineup showed the 
usual conservative–liberal split, with Justice Anthony Kennedy casting the 
swing vote. But the case shows just how extreme the polarization is between 
the different interpretative approaches on the court. Here’s the breakdown of 
the three opinions that were delivered:

40
Part I: Exploring Constitutional Basics 
 
✓ A lengthy and unexciting majority opinion, written by Justice Kennedy, 
upheld the constitutionality of the act by steering a careful course 
between respect for a law passed by Congress and respect for previous 
pro-choice rulings by the high court.
 
✓ A very short and explosive concurring opinion written by Justice Clarence 
Thomas with the support of Justice Antonin Scalia — generally considered 
to be the most politically conservative members of the court — supported 
the majority opinion upholding the constitutional validity of the act. But 
the main thrust of this bombshell concurring opinion is a total rejection 
of the court’s previous pro-choice rulings: “The court’s abortion jurispru-
dence, including Roe v. Wade, has no basis in the Constitution.”
 
✓ A dissenting opinion, penned by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg — probably 
the most politically liberal member of the court — described the major-
ity decision as “alarming.” She wrote, “The notion that the Partial-Birth 
Abortion Ban Act furthers any legitimate government interest is, quite 
simply, irrational.”
Identifying methods of interpretation
The classification of the different schools of constitutional interpretation is 
messy, to say the least. But here’s a bird’s-eye view of the main divisions:
 
✓ Living Constitution: This school of thought sees the Constitution as 
a living and breathing document that must be interpreted and rein-
terpreted according to the changing needs of society. On the present 
Supreme Court, Justices Ginsburg, David Souter, and Stephen Breyer 
generally adhere to this approach. Justice Scalia has attacked this 
approach as undemocratic by wanting “matters to be decided not by the 
people, but by the justices of the Supreme Court.”
 
✓ Strict constructionism: This label used to refer to a literal approach to 
constitutional interpretation. Thomas Jefferson favored this approach, 
which took a narrow view of the powers of the federal government as 
against the states. Chief Justice William Rehnquist was often described 
as a strict constructionist, as are Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin 
Scalia. Scalia rejects the label, saying that he is “not a strict construc-
tionist and no-one ought to be” — because the correct approach is to 
understand the words of the Constitution in their “ordinary” meaning 
and not only in their “strict” meaning.
 
✓ Textualism: Judges who are referred to by politicians and the media as 
strict constructionists nowadays tend to prefer to be regarded as textu-
alists, formalists, or originalists. Although these three labels are not iden-
tical, we can lump them all together under the title of textualists. These 
judges believe that the Constitution should be interpreted in accordance 
with its original meaning.

41
 Chapter 3: Debating the Constitution
 
 These judges are also often regarded as conservatives, but there is some 
confusion here. Conservative judges normally have a certain reverence 
for stare decisis — the doctrine that courts should adhere to previ-
ous decisions. But what should a textualist do when his reading of the 
Constitution disagrees with a previous Supreme Court decision? In those 
circumstances, some of them, like Clarence Thomas, tend to jettison 
stare decisis.
 
✓ Originalism: This term is now applied to several different schools of 
thought, which share the view that the Constitution had a clear and 
definite meaning at the time it was drafted and that to interpret the 
Constitution a court must get back to that original meaning.
 
 The most influential branch of this school of thought, claiming adher-
ents such as Scalia, stresses original meaning at the expense of original 
intent — the meaning of the text as it would have been understood by 
a reasonable person at the time it was drafted, rather than some secret 
purpose that the Framers may have had. Critics of this approach have 
pooh-poohed as unrealistic the attempt to recapture the meaning of a 
text as it was understood more than 200 years ago.
 
 The sight of judges beating one another over the head with old diction-
aries can be entertaining. In 1994, Scalia, relying on a raft of dictionar-
ies, ruled that the word modify meant no more than “to make minor 
changes.” He rejected the argument, based on Webster’s Third New 
International Dictionary published in 1976, that modify could also refer to 
the making of major or fundamental changes.
 
 If this is the sort of mess a court can get into on the basis of word mean-
ings of the late 20th century, how easy can it be to reach the original 
meaning of texts drafted in the late 18th century? Interpreting the 
Constitution on the basis of its meaning at the time it was written sure 
makes sense. The problem may be that neither Scalia nor any of the other 
high court justices is trained as a historian, a linguist, or a philologist.
 
✓ Judicial activism: Politically liberal judges are often identified as “judicial 
activists,” while political conservatives are often assumed to be in favor 
of “judicial restraint.” This is by no means always the case. For example, 
Felix Frankfurter, one of the most liberal Supreme Court justices of all 
time, was also noted for his loyalty to the federal government. So, in the 
1944 case of Korematsu v. United States, he voted with the majority on 
the court to uphold a racially based executive order excluding Japanese-
Americans from a designated military area in California. More recently, 
in 1995, conservative Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote the majority 
opinion in United States v. Lopez — supported by conservative Justices 
Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas and vaguely conservative Justice 
Sandra Day O’Connor — striking down as unconstitutional a federal law 
prohibiting the knowing possession of a gun in a school zone. Opponents 
of this decision labeled it as an exercise in judicial activism, but it could 
also be characterized as an example of strict constructionism.

Introducing . . . the Constitution! 
The Preamble and the 
Seven Articles
In This Chapter

▶ Delving beneath the surface of the text
▶ Recognizing that the real story may not figure in the text at all
I
s the Constitution complicated, hard to understand, and boring? You 
betcha! Okay, so don’t read it yet. Read this chapter first.
In this chapter, I introduce you to the Preamble — the introduction — to the 
Constitution, as well as the seven articles. I deal with the subject matter of 
these seven articles in detail in later chapters.
My goal in this chapter is to look beneath the surface of the Constitution and 
identify what I consider the most important (and sometimes disputed) issues 
it addresses. I also reveal that some of the most important principles that 
formed the basis of the Constitution don’t actually figure in the text at all.
Presenting the Preamble: 
“We the People . . .”
“We the People” are the best-known words of the U.S. Constitution. They are 
the opening words of the Preamble — the almost lyrical introduction to the 
Constitution:

44
Part I: Exploring Constitutional Basics 
We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, 
establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common 
defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to 
ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the 
United States of America.
The language of the Preamble is very different from that of the rest of the 
Constitution. The Constitution is essentially a legal document, but the 
Preamble reads more like a political statement. Let me examine the wording 
more closely:
 
✓ We the People of the United States . . . do ordain and establish this 
Constitution for the United States of America: Did “the people of the 
United States” really “ordain and establish” the Constitution? Yes and 
no. The delegates to the Philadelphia Convention that drafted the 
Constitution in 1787 were not directly elected; they were selected by 
their state legislatures. But the Constitution was then submitted for rati-
fication to a directly elected convention in each state.
 
✓ in Order to form a more perfect Union: This clause refers to the perceived 
failure of the Articles of Confederation, the first American constitution, 
that had been in effect since 1777. The Philadelphia Convention drafted 
a Constitution that aimed “to form a more perfect Union” — a closer 
union than the loose association of sovereign states that existed under 
the Articles of Confederation.
 
✓ [in Order to] establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the 
common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of 
Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity: This is an impressive list of objec-
tives. The Articles of Confederation weren’t able to deliver these goals. 
They didn’t even set up any national law courts. The states were at one 
another’s throats. And Congress wasn’t able to offer protection against 
foreign enemies or the Native American tribes. But the Framers were 
confident that their new Constitution could secure these benefits for 
their own age and for the future. They turned out to be right!
Article I: Setting up the Congress
Article I is by far the longest article of the Constitution (see the Appendix). 
Section 1 of that article reads as follows:
All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the 
United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.

45
 Chapter 4: Introducing . . . the Constitution!
At first sight this section looks as though it gives Congress total legislative 
power — the power to make any laws it likes. The very first word, “All,” cer-
tainly contributes to this impression. But that impression is false.
The most important word in this section is not “All” but the easily-missed 
“granted.” This important section can be rewritten like this:
 
✓ The Constitution grants the federal government certain limited legisla-
tive powers — the power to pass laws on certain matters, but not on 
just anything.
 
✓ The Constitution grants all these limited legislative powers to a 
Congress.
 
✓ The Congress shall consist of two houses: a Senate and a House of 
Representatives.
Sections 2 through 7 of Article I spell out who can run for election to each 
branch of Congress, how often those elections take place, how many mem-
bers each branch has, and (in broad terms) how the business of Congress is 
to be run. I discuss these topics in Chapter 11.
But by far the meatiest sections of Article I are Section 8, which lists the 
powers of Congress, and Section 9, which details specific limits on congres-
sional power. In the following sections, I explain two reasons that Section 8, 
in particular, deserves special attention.
Magnifying the commerce power
Over the years, the Constitution has been interpreted in such a way that the 
most important part of Article I, Section 8 is the Commerce Clause, which con-
fers on Congress the power
To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, 
and with the Indian Tribes.
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has at times interpreted this clause — and particu-
larly Congress’s power over interstate commerce — so widely as to embrace 
virtually all economic activities. This interpretation is a far cry from what the 
Framers appear to have intended because the wording of the clause places 
interstate commerce slap bang between international trade and trade with the 
Native American tribes. This positioning can only mean that interstate com-
merce must be understood in the same limited way as the other two catego-
ries. I deal more fully with the Commerce Clause in Chapter 9.

46
Part I: Exploring Constitutional Basics 
(Mis)interpreting the “necessary 
and proper” clause
The “necessary and proper” clause of Article I, Section 8 is also impor-
tant, but it too has suffered at the hands of greedy feds. This clause gives 
Congress the power
To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into 
Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this 
Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or 
Officer thereof.
Once again, it’s easy to be unduly influenced by the opening words, “To make 
all Laws.” But a close reading of the rest of the clause appears to indicate 
a serious limitation. The key words are “necessary and proper.” Does this 
phrase apply to all congressional legislation? If it does, then it clearly acts as 
a limitation on the power of Congress.
 
In the leading case of McCulloch v. Maryland, decided in 1819, Chief Justice 
John Marshall disagreed with this interpretation and held that, far from 
restricting the power of Congress, the “necessary and proper” clause actu-
ally extended that power. My own view is that Marshall was wrong about this 
and that his interpretation of this clause is one of his many “twistifications” (a 
phrase that Thomas Jefferson coined). See my full discussion of this important 
decision in Chapter 8.
Article II: Hailing the Chief
Section 1 of Article II begins with these words:
The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of 
America.
Section 2 adds:
The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the 
United States, and of the militia of the several states, when called into the 
actual service of the United States.
 
In addition to his executive and military powers, the President’s approval 
is needed for a Bill to become an Act of Congress. If the President doesn’t 
approve a Bill, he is commonly said to veto it. The presidential veto kills the 
Bill concerned (but the veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in 
both houses of Congress). These legislative powers of the President are found 
in Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution.

47
 Chapter 4: Introducing . . . the Constitution!
The President is also Head of State of the United States, a position that isn’t 
mentioned in the Constitution at all — because the Framers didn’t recognize 
it as a separate position. I discuss this and the other powers of the President 
in Chapter 10.
Listing presidential powers and duties
Article II is surprisingly brief. The only presidential powers and duties that 
are specifically enumerated are the following:
 
✓ The power to make treaties — subject to confirmation by the Senate.
 
✓ The power — subject to confirmation by the Senate — to appoint 
“Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, judges of the 
supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose 
Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for.”
 
✓ The power to fill casual vacancies in the Senate that occur during 
congressional recesses.
 
✓ The duty to report to Congress on the state of the union (the origin of 
the annual State of the Union Address).
 
✓ The power to recommend legislation to Congress.
 
✓ The power to call a meeting of one or both houses of Congress “on extraor-
dinary Occasions” — a power that has been exercised by 16 presidents.
 
✓ The power to adjourn Congress “in Case of Disagreement” between the 
two Houses “with Respect to the Time of Adjournment.”
 
✓ The right to “receive Ambassadors and other public Ministers” repre-
senting foreign nations.
 
✓ An obligation to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed” — a 
really important duty.
 
✓ The power to appoint all officers of the United States armed forces.
Finally, Article II, Section 4 contains one of the best-known features of the 
Constitution — the provision for the impeachment of “The President, Vice 
President and all civil Officers of the United States.” I discuss impeachment in 
Chapter 13.
Identifying the real issues
This list of presidential powers and duties looks boringly straightforward. 
So how come different presidents have exercised such different degrees of 
power? You need only compare a weak president like James Buchanan with 

48
Part I: Exploring Constitutional Basics 
his immediate successor, Abraham Lincoln, to notice the difference — or, 
say, a strong president like Theodore Roosevelt with his weak hand-picked 
successor, William Howard Taft.
The reason for these contrasts is the divergent interpretations of the 
Constitution that these different presidents embraced. These days, the main 
areas of dispute include
 
✓ Presidential power in regard to war.
 
✓ Presidential power in regard to homeland security.
 
✓ The President’s role in regard to healthcare.
I discuss all these topics in Chapter 10.
A drafting boo-boo
A big chunk of Article II deals with presidential elections. Most of these pro-
visions were scrapped and replaced by the Twelfth Amendment, ratified in 
1804, which I discuss in Chapter 20.
Article II had to be amended because, in drafting the rules for presidential 
elections, the Framers had totally ignored the role of political parties — 
which, in fact, aren’t mentioned anywhere in the Constitution. This serious 
omission put the Framers in a delicate spot in the election of 1800.
The original version of Article II said that the members of the Electoral 
College had to vote for two candidates for President. The candidate with the 
most votes would then become President, and the candidate with the next 
highest number of votes would become Vice President.
This arrangement was naïve — because each political party naturally put up 
two candidates, one of them being the presidential candidate and the other 
his running-mate. But, because the Constitution didn’t differentiate between 
a vote for President and a vote for Vice President, in the 1800 election 
Thomas Jefferson ended up with the same number of electoral votes as his 
running-mate, Aaron Burr. The result was a mess. Aaron Burr nearly became 
President. The outcome was decided by the House of Representative — after 
no fewer than 36 ballots!
Succeeding to the presidency
The provision for succession on the removal, death, or incapacity of the 
President is another defective piece of draftsmanship. The “Powers and 

49
 Chapter 4: Introducing . . . the Constitution!
Duties” of the office of President were to “devolve on [pass on to] the Vice 
President.” This provision appears clear enough. But, did it mean that the 
Vice President was to become President or only acting President?
After the death in 1841 of William Henry Harrison, the first President to die 
in office, Vice President John Tyler was referred to by his enemies as “His 
Accidency.” But he took the presidential oath of office and was officially 
recognized by the Senate as President and not merely acting President. And 
to make a point, he returned unopened all mail addressed to the “acting 
President.” He is counted as the tenth President on the official list.
All subsequent Vice Presidents who succeeded to the presidency were 
regarded as Presidents and not just as acting Presidents. But this status was 
not finally put on a constitutional footing until the ratification of the Twenty-
Fifth Amendment in 1967 (see Chapter 22).
Article II also made no provision for the appointment of a new Vice President 
when the Vice President succeeded to the presidency. So, until the Twenty-
Fifth Amendment came around, there was no Vice President during the presi-
dency of a Vice President who had succeeded to the post.
Article III: Understating Judicial Power
Article III, which sets forth the power of the judiciary, looks pretty straight-
forward — and mind-numbingly dull. Here’s Section 1:
The judicial Power of the United States shall be vested in one supreme 
Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time 
ordain and establish. The judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, 
shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour.
 
The provision allowing federal judges to hold office “during good Behaviour” 
is effectively the same as saying “for life.” That’s why the battle over who will 
receive a coveted appointment to a federal judgeship is often protracted and 
heated. Quite a number of Supreme Court justices — including most recently 
Chief Justice William Rehnquist — died in harness at an advanced age.
Article III, Section 2 lists the types of cases that the federal courts are empow-
ered to hear. The U.S. Supreme Court is the most important court in the 
nation. The “inferior” federal courts include the U.S. courts of appeals, U.S. 
district courts, and also specialist courts such as the U.S. bankruptcy courts 
and the U.S. Tax Court.
There is only one surprise in the list of judicial functions in Article III: It 
includes cases “between a State and Citizens of another State,” which were 
later excluded by the Eleventh Amendment (see Chapter 20).

50
Part I: Exploring Constitutional Basics 
 
The most important power of the Supreme Court doesn’t figure in the text of 
the Constitution at all. This is the power of judicial review, which I discuss at 
length in Chapter 12. In brief, here’s what judicial review means: It allows the 
U.S. Supreme Court to decide whether a federal or state law is in violation of 
the U.S. Constitution. If the court finds that a law conflicts with the 
Constitution, it declares the law unconstitutional. This means that the law (or 
the relevant part of the law) is void, or of no effect.
Because of judicial review, the Supreme Court is extremely powerful — arguably 
more powerful than either of the other two branches of government. The court 
can strike down a law that has been passed by both houses of Congress and 
signed by the President! In the words of Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, 
“the Constitution is what the judges say it is.”
Two key questions come to mind, both of which I discuss in Chapter 12:
 
✓ How come this great power of the Supreme Court isn’t spelled out any-
where in the text of the Constitution? The Framers of the Constitution 
may not have intended for the court to wield such power; the court 
arrogated the power of judicial review to itself. Chief Justice John 
Marshall started the ball rolling with a famous 1803 opinion in Marbury v. 
Madison — a case I discuss in Chapter 23.
 
✓ Was the court’s decision to give itself the power of judicial review 
wrong? Probably. But nonetheless, the power remains intact today.
Article IV: Getting Along with the 
Neighbors — and Uncle Sam
The first sentence of Section 1 of Article IV is known as the Full Faith and 
Credit Clause. It reads as follows:
Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, 
and judicial Proceedings of every other State.
This clause appears to mean that every state has to recognize the laws and 
court decisions of every other state. But the Supreme Court established a 
“public policy” exception to the operation of this clause. In 1939, the court 
ruled that “there are some limitations to the extent to which a state may be 
required by the full faith and credit clause to enforce even the judgment of 
another state in contravention of its own statutes or policy.”

51
 Chapter 4: Introducing . . . the Constitution!
Same-sex marriage is the latest issue to put the Full Faith and Credit Clause 
to the test. Is a state required under the Full Faith and Credit Clause to recog-
nize a same-sex marriage, if that marriage was valid in the state where it was 
performed?
The opening sentence of Section 2 of Article IV, the Privileges and Immunities 
Clause, is less controversial. It reads as follows:
The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities 
of Citizens in the several States.
But even this clause has had its problems — especially when it has come up 
against the clause modeled on it in the Fourteenth Amendment, which I dis-
cuss in Chapter 21.
Article V: Changing versus 
Amending the Constitution
Article V lays down the rather complicated procedure required for amend-
ing the Constitution — or, to be precise, four alternative routes that can 
be adopted for this purpose. With one exception — the Twenty-First 
Amendment, repealing Prohibition — the procedure adopted for every 
amendment has been the same, namely:
 
✓ Proposal by a two-thirds majority in both houses of Congress; and
 
✓ Ratification by three-fourths of the state legislatures.
The Framers deliberately (and cleverly) made the procedure for amending 
the Constitution as complicated and elaborate as possible — because they 
didn’t want their handiwork undone by the shifting breezes of political fash-
ion. On the face of it, the Framers appear to have achieved their objective: 
Since the ratification of the Bill of Rights (the first ten amendments) all at 
once in 1791, only 17 amendments have been made to the Constitution — in 
the space of more than two centuries.
 
Does this remarkable fact mean that, with the exception of these 17 amend-
ments, the Constitution today is the same as it was in 1791? No, not at all. 
It means only that the wording of the Constitution hasn’t been changed by 
formal amendment. There have been plenty of changes, accomplished by 
judicial interpretation. The power of the Supreme Court is such that it is able 
to “amend” the Constitution — sometimes quite radically — by interpreting a 
word or phrase. I discuss this topic in Chapter 5.

52
Part I: Exploring Constitutional Basics 
Article VI: Fudging Federalism
The most important part of Article VI is the Supremacy Clause, which reads 
as follows:
This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in 
Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the 
Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the 
judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution 
or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.
This clause purportedly has the following effects:
 
✓ It sets federal law above state law.
 
✓ It makes the U.S. Constitution the highest law in the nation.
 
✓ It places international treaties above state law, and even above federal 
power.
I explore these effects, and the questions they raise, in Chapter 7.
Article VII: Ratifying the Constitution
A nice, easy one at last! Article VII of the Constitution, the last part of the 
original, unamended Constitution, sets out the requirement for ratifying the 
Constitution:
The Ratification of the Conventions of nine States, shall be sufficient for the 
Establishment of this Constitution between the States so ratifying the Same.
In fact, all 13 of the original states ratified the Constitution — although North 
Carolina and Rhode Island didn’t do so until after March 4, 1789, the date 
appointed “for commencing proceedings under the Constitution.”
Article VII is purely of historical interest. It does not apply to the ratification 
of amendments, which is governed by Article V.

Chapter 5
Amending versus Interpreting 
the Constitution: Taking 
Time for Change
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the Framers’ intention
▶ Jumping through the amendment hoops
▶ Explaining why there are so few amendments
▶ Reviewing proposed amendments that never made it
▶ Recognizing how the Supreme Court unofficially amends the Constitution
H
ow does the Constitution change? Only with difficulty. The Framers of 
the Constitution believed that they’d hit the jackpot. They had thought 
and debated long and hard about the best form of government, and they 
wanted to make sure that future generations wouldn’t mess up their perfect 
construction by adding or subtracting bits arbitrarily. Benjamin Franklin, one 
of the Framers, described the Constitution as creating a system of govern-
ment that was “near to perfection.” So the Framers deliberately made the 
Constitution very hard to change — not impossible, just very complicated.
I’m talking here about amendments: official, formal changes to the 
Constitution. But there is another, less formal kind of change — through deci-
sions of the U.S. Supreme Court interpreting the Constitution. You won’t find 
that type of change even mentioned in the Constitution because the Framers 
never imagined change could come about in that way. It simply wasn’t sup-
posed to happen.

54
Part I: Exploring Constitutional Basics 
Some of the most important changes to the Constitution have been made as a 
result of Supreme Court decisions. These include:
 
✓ Banning racial segregation
 
✓ Expanding the rights of people charged with crimes
 
✓ Declaring a right to privacy
 
✓ Establishing a (limited) right to abortion
I come back to judge-made changes later in the chapter. But first I discuss the 
type of change allowed by the Constitution: amendment.
Noting the Four Paths to an Amendment
Article V of the Constitution provides for no fewer than four different ways of 
amending the Constitution. Ready for some fancy footwork?
 
✓ Congress proposes an amendment — passed by a two-thirds majority of 
both houses. This amendment is then ratified (confirmed) by the legisla-
tures of three-fourths of all the states.
 
✓ Congress proposes an amendment — passed by a two-thirds majority of 
both houses. This amendment is then ratified by special conventions in 
three-fourths of the states.
 
✓ Two-thirds of the state legislatures ask Congress to call a national con-
vention. This convention proposes an amendment, which is then ratified 
by the legislatures of three-fourths of the states.
 
✓ Two-thirds of the state legislatures ask Congress to call a national con-
vention. This convention proposes an amendment, which is then ratified 
by special conventions in three-fourths of the states.
Whew! A lot of this technical detail is of academic interest only. The first of 
the four ways of amending the Constitution has by far the greatest practi-
cal significance. This method has been used for 26 of the 27 amendments 
ratified so far. The second method was used once — for the Twenty-First 
Amendment, which repealed the Eighteenth Amendment (Prohibition). And 
the third and fourth routes for amendment provided by the Constitution have 
never been used.
 
The President is not involved in the amendment process at all. He can neither 
propose an amendment nor veto it. This is surprising, to say the least, because 
Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution gives the President the right to approve 
or disapprove “Every Order, Resolution, or Vote” needing the agreement of the 
House and the Senate. Doesn’t this cover amendments as well? On the basis of 
Article I, Section 7, it sure looks like it. But Article V, the article that deals with 
amending the Constitution, doesn’t mention the President at all.

55
 Chapter 5: Amending versus Interpreting the Constitution
No President has ever tried to muscle in on the amendment process. But the 
question of his involvement was raised before the U.S. Supreme Court early 
on in Hollingsworth v. Virginia, decided in 1798. Hollingsworth claimed that the 
Eleventh Amendment was invalid because it had not been presented to the 
President in accordance with Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution. The court 
rejected the claim and accepted the literal wording of Article V, meaning that 
the President had no say in regard to amendments, and this is still the position 
today. Presidents have occasionally signed proposed amendments nevertheless, 
in order to give them extra support. In 1861 President James Buchanan signed a 
pro-slavery proposed amendment for this reason, and in 1865 Abraham Lincoln 
followed his example by signing the Thirteenth Amendment abolishing slavery.
Explaining What Happens in Practice
As is so often the case, the words of the Constitution raise more questions 
than they answer. Let me tackle a few of these questions:
 
✓ Two-thirds of both houses of Congress can propose an amendment. 
Does this mean two-thirds of all members? No. Only two-thirds of those 
present and voting at the time — provided there is a quorum (more than 
half of the members) present in each house.
 
✓ What exactly is meant by a convention? A convention is a meeting of 
delegates, and Article V provides for two different kinds of conventions: 
a national convention for proposing amendments, and state conventions 
for ratifying amendments.
 
✓ Who gets to be chosen as a member of a national convention? The 
only national constitutional convention in U.S. history was the initial 
Philadelphia Convention that drafted the U.S. Constitution in 1787. The 55 
delegates were not elected, but selected by the state legislatures. More 
than 500 requests for a national convention have recently been made 
by states, but Congress has remained resistant to all such requests. The 
method of choosing delegates to any future convention is undecided.
 
✓ What powers would a national convention have? A national conven-
tion would be permitted to propose amendments but not to ratify 
them. Why? Because Article V of the Constitution leaves the “Mode of 
Ratification” up to Congress. But a national convention would in practice 
have unlimited power to propose amendments or even a radical rewrit-
ing of the Constitution — which is probably why Congress is reluctant to 
agree to another national convention.
 
✓ Who gets to be chosen as a member of a state convention? The only 
time state conventions were ever called was in 1933, in order to ratify 
the Twenty-First Amendment. Different states had different arrange-
ments. But a common method was for the voters in the state concerned 
to elect delegates from a list chosen by the state governor in consulta-
tion with other state officials.

✓ What powers does a state convention have? State conventions can ratify 
proposed amendments but can’t themselves propose any amendments. 
The Twenty-First Amendment is the only one that has been ratified by 
this method.
 
In the 200-plus years that the Constitution has been in force, no fewer than 
5,000 — that’s right, 5,000 — amendments have been introduced in Congress. 
Of these, only 33 have gotten over the two-thirds hurdle to be formally pro-
posed, and of these just 27 have made it through the ratification process to 
become part of the Constitution. This figure of 27 includes the first ten amend-
ments, which were all ratified together on December 15, 1791, and are collec-
tively known as the Bill of Rights. This leaves the amazingly small total of 17 
amendments in the whole period from 1791 to the present day.
Listing the Amendments
Here is a rundown of all 27 amendments that have made it into the U.S. 
Constitution:

✓ Second Amendment: Right to bear arms
 
✓ Third Amendment: Ban on quartering of soldiers
 
✓ Fourth Amendment: Unreasonable search and seizure

Rating the Ratification of the 
Fourteenth Amendment
The Fourteenth Amendment is one of the most important parts of the U.S. 
Constitution. But was the Fourteenth Amendment properly ratified? This is 
an important question. If the amendment was not properly ratified, then it’s 
not part of the Constitution.
The problem is that the Fourteenth Amendment was the product of the Civil 
War, which ended in 1865. Congress proposed the Fourteenth Amendment in 
June 1866, and the amendment was ratified in July 1868.
The main objections to the constitutionality of the Fourteenth Amendment 
are twofold:
 
✓ The Congress that proposed the Fourteenth Amendment was an 
unconstitutional body because 80 representatives and 28 senators 
from the 11 former Confederate states were excluded from it. It is true 
that the two-thirds majority of both houses of Congress required to pro-
pose the Fourteenth Amendment was obtained in this way. Eight state 
legislatures objected to this procedure at the time on the ground that 
Article V of the Constitution guarantees all states “equal Suffrage in the 
Senate.”

58
Part I: Exploring Constitutional Basics 
 
✓ The Fourteenth Amendment was not ratified by three-fourths of the 
states. This objection is even stronger than the previous one. The United 
States was made up of 37 states in 1868. Ratification therefore required 
the approval of 28 states. However, no fewer than 15 states specifically 
rejected the Fourteenth Amendment in 1866 and 1867, including 4 states 
that had remained in the Union during the Civil War.
 
 This rejection of the amendment by well over one-fourth of the states 
should have meant that the amendment was dead in the water. However, 
Congress then passed — over the veto of President Andrew Johnson — 
the Reconstruction Acts, which placed 10 of the 11 former Confederate 
states under military rule and made their readmission to the Union 
conditional on their ratifying the Fourteenth Amendment. Ratification 
by five of these states — three of which had previously rejected the 
amendment — was necessary for the Fourteenth Amendment to become 
part of the Constitution.
 
 In short, the Fourteenth Amendment became part of the Constitution 
only by coercion. Does this important fact invalidate the amendment? 
It probably should have that effect, but the moral of the story is that, in 
practice, war and politics trump strict law.
Reviving a Forgotten Amendment
The Twenty-Seventh Amendment, the most recent addition to the Constitution, 
took more than 200 years to be ratified. It was passed by a two-thirds majority 
in Congress in 1789, together with 11 other proposed amendments — ten of 
which went on to become the Bill of Rights.
This particular proposed amendment prohibited members of Congress from 
voting themselves a pay raise without the approval of the electorate. By 1791 
this proposal had been ratified by 6 of the 11 state legislatures that were 
needed. Then, after a few flurries, it just languished and was completely for-
gotten until 1982.
Its resuscitation came from an unlikely source. In 1982, Gregory Watson, a 
Texas college student, recognized that if Congress did not set a deadline for 
the ratification of a particular amendment, there was no time limit. No dead-
line had been set for this particular proposal.
Watson embarked on a frantic letter-writing campaign, which resulted in the 
ratification of the proposal by 38 states (the requisite three-fourths of the 
50 states) and its formal certification as the Twenty-Seventh Amendment 
to the Constitution in 1992. But, as is so often the case, its effect has been 
blunted or even nullified by judicial interpretation. This happened in 1994, 

59
 Chapter 5: Amending versus Interpreting the Constitution
when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that 
the amendment has no effect on annual cost of living adjustments (COLAs), 
which are really just pay-raises by another name!
Calling Time on an ERA
The fate of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) has been less happy than that 
of the Twenty-Seventh Amendment. The ERA’s wording mirrors that of the 
Fifteenth, Nineteenth, and Twenty-Sixth amendments. The first and main sec-
tion of the ERA says,
Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the 
United States or by any state on account of sex.
The ERA got off to a flying start in 1972 with overwhelming support in 
Congress, which gave it a seven-year deadline for ratification. At first it looked 
as though that was not going to be a problem, as 22 states fell over one 
another to ratify it. But the enthusiasm for it cooled, and Congress extended 
the time limit to 1982. At that point, the ERA was still 3 states short of the 38 
needed for ratification, and in the meantime, 5 states that had ratified the ERA 
changed their minds. A federal court held that these states had the right to 
reverse their previous decisions but that Congress had acted unlawfully in 
extending the deadline! Before this rather strange decision could be appealed 
to the U.S. Supreme Court, the extended ratification period expired, killing off 
the ERA. (There have been more recent attempts to revive it in Congress but 
without the requisite two-thirds majority.)
Reviewing Other Unratified 
Proposed Amendments
The ERA differs from the other unratified proposed amendments because 
Congress imposed a deadline for the ratification of the ERA but not for any of 
the others. Here’s a brief rundown of these other proposed amendments:
 
✓ The Congressional Apportionment Amendment: This was the very 
first amendment ever proposed, in 1789. After being ratified by 11 
states through June 1792, this proposal died. The whole question of 
Congressional representation is now satisfactorily dealt with by ordi-
nary legislation. There is no chance that this proposed amendment will 
ever be revived.

60
Part I: Exploring Constitutional Basics 
 
✓ Titles of Nobility Amendment (TONA): Article I, Section 9 of the 
Constitution doesn’t allow any U.S. officeholder to accept any foreign 
title of nobility without the permission of Congress. TONA goes further 
and strips of his or her citizenship any U.S. citizen who accepts any for-
eign title of nobility.
 
 TONA was proposed by Congress in 1810 and was ratified by 12 states 
at a time when only 13 were needed. It was long thought that TONA 
had indeed been ratified, and many 19th-century printings of the 
Constitution show it as the Thirteenth Amendment. It would now need 
to be ratified by an additional 26 states, making a total of 38 (three-
fourths of the present complement of 50 states). If you’ve been offered a 
foreign title of nobility, better grab it now before those 26 states ratify it! 
But don’t worry, that’s not going to happen any time soon.
 
✓ The Corwin Amendment: This proposed amendment is an historical 
relic. It prohibits any amendment ever to be made to the Constitution 
abolishing slavery! Yet it was passed by a two-thirds majority in both 
houses of Congress in 1861, just weeks before the outbreak of the Civil 
War. Outgoing President James Buchanan endorsed the proposed 
amendment. Amazingly, the new President, Abraham Lincoln, also 
expressed his support for it in his first inaugural address. However, 
the proposal was soon overtaken by events. It can’t stand with the 
Thirteenth Amendment abolishing slavery, which was ratified in 1865.
 
✓ Child Labor Amendment: This proposal gives Congress the power to 
regulate and even prohibit the labor of children under 18. Proposed in 
1924, it has so far been ratified by 28 states. It needs to be ratified by an 
additional ten states if it’s ever to make it into the Constitution. In 1939, 
the U.S. Supreme Court held that this amendment was still pending busi-
ness before the state legislatures because Congress had not placed a 
deadline on ratification.
Debating the Need for Judge-Made Law
 
Article V of the Constitution lays down pretty clear procedures for amend-
ing the Constitution, providing a choice of four routes. Isn’t this enough? The 
objections to limiting constitutional change to the methods set out in Article V 
are as follows:
 
✓ The Article V procedures are cumbersome and slow.
 
✓ As a result, we are stuck with a constitution that is largely the product of 
a bygone age.

61
 Chapter 5: Amending versus Interpreting the Constitution
 
✓ This situation makes it difficult for the Constitution to respond to 
changes in society and politics.
 
✓ The old-fashioned language of the Constitution has to be interpreted and 
made relevant to modern society.
 
✓ The U.S. Supreme Court is very well-suited to making the Constitution 
relevant to modern society.
On the other side are people who argue that we should stick to the proper 
Article V procedure for amending the Constitution. They believe that it’s just 
plain wrong for judges to rewrite the Constitution. Here are some of the rea-
sons supporting this view:
 
✓ The Article V procedures ensure that changes to the Constitution are 
made only after due consideration and with wide support.
 
✓ The principles enunciated in the Constitution are timeless.
 
✓ The Constitution should not become the plaything of changing fashions.
 
✓ The language of the Constitution does have to be interpreted, but that is 
not the same thing as changing its meaning.
 
✓ If judges rewrite the Constitution according to their own predilections, 
this can only lead to disagreement over what the Constitution means.
 
✓ The U.S. Supreme Court — made up of unelected judges — is not enti-
tled to change the Constitution.
 
✓ It’s simply undemocratic, or even anti-democratic, for judges to rewrite 
the Constitution according to their own likes and dislikes.
 
Which of these two points of view is right? You’re welcome to make up your 
own mind, but my own view is that it’s wrong for judges to try to amend the 
Constitution. To help you make up your mind on this question, let’s take a 
look at a key example of a judge-made constitutional amendment: the right to 
privacy.
Reading a Right to Privacy 
into the Constitution
The word privacy doesn’t appear anywhere in the Constitution, yet there 
is now supposedly a constitutional right to privacy. How could this change 
have come about?

62
Part I: Exploring Constitutional Basics 
Using a sledgehammer to crack 
a nut: Griswold v. Connecticut
The right to privacy stems from the Supreme Court decision in Griswold v. 
Connecticut, decided in 1965. An old Connecticut law prohibited the use of 
contraceptives. Was this law unconstitutional? That was the question facing 
the U.S. Supreme Court.
 
By a majority of seven to two, the court found that the Connecticut statute 
was indeed unconstitutional. But on what basis? The Bill of Rights contains 
no specific right of privacy, so the majority on the court relied on a less direct 
approach. They located the right to privacy in some pretty vague phrases:
 
✓ “Penumbras” (shadowy surrounds) of specific guarantees in the Bill of 
Rights “formed by emanations from those guarantees”
 
✓ The (vague) Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (which I 
discuss in Chapters 17 and 21)
 
✓ The (extremely vague) Ninth Amendment (which I discuss in Chapter 19)
Now let’s take a look at the dissenting opinions in Griswold.
Disliking a law versus declaring 
it unconstitutional
It’s important to remember that the question before the justices was not 
whether they agreed or disagreed with the Connecticut birth-control law, but 
only whether the law was constitutional or not.
Justice Potter Stewart, in his dissent, held that the Connecticut law was not 
unconstitutional. But Stewart made no secret of his disdain for the state law. 
He described it as “an uncommonly silly law” and “obviously unenforceable.” 
Was Stewart contradicting himself, then? Not at all. He recognized the funda-
mental difference between not liking a law and declaring it unconstitutional.
Stewart examined all the claims made by the majority on the court. He con-
cluded, “I can find no such general right of privacy in the Bill of Rights, in 
any other part of the Constitution, or in any case ever before decided by this 
Court.” Pretty powerful stuff, eh?

63
 Chapter 5: Amending versus Interpreting the Constitution
So, should Connecticut be stuck with this “uncommonly silly law,” then? 
No. Stewart pointed to the correct, democratic solution: If the people of 
Connecticut didn’t agree with the birth-control law, they should persuade 
their state legislature to repeal it. As Stewart put it, “That is the constitu-
tional way to take this law off the books.”
 
Was it really necessary to find a right of privacy lurking between the lines of 
the Constitution in order to knock a ridiculous old state law on the head? No — 
and especially not if it meant allowing judges to usurp the democratic right to 
amend the Constitution.
Embarking on the road to Roe v. Wade
 
When the Supreme Court makes a decision adopting a certain position, that 
decision becomes a precedent that is then followed in later decisions. And 
precedents are not just followed — they are often expanded. That is what hap-
pened with Griswold: It became the basis of a constitutional right of privacy, 
which was then expanded to include a constitutional right to have an abor-
tion. Quite a stretch. Hold on to your hat!
The Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade in 1973. The question before the 
court was whether Texas antiabortion laws were constitutional. The Supreme 
Court declared the Texas laws unconstitutional. But in so doing, the court 
also struck down many other state and federal antiabortion laws.
Justifying abortion rights
What is the justification for such a major judge-made change to the 
Constitution? The Supreme Court split seven to two in favor of abortion 
rights. Justice Harry Blackmun wrote for the majority. Here are the main legal 
points in his opinion:
 
✓ “The Constitution does not explicitly mention any right of privacy.”
 
✓ However, “the Court has recognized that a right of personal privacy . . . 
does exist under the Constitution.” (Justice Blackmun here listed a 
number of Supreme Court decisions, including Griswold and some 
search and seizure cases.)
 
✓ This right of personal privacy is based largely on the Due Process Clause 
of the Fourteenth Amendment.
 
✓ This right of personal privacy includes a pregnant woman’s right to 
terminate her pregnancy — an absolute right up to the end of the first 
trimester (weeks 1 to 12). After that time, the right to an abortion contin-
ues when it’s necessary to protect a woman’s health.

64
Part I: Exploring Constitutional Basics 
Denying abortion rights
Obviously, not everyone agrees with the majority opinion in Roe V. Wade. 
Here are some of the arguments against it:
 
✓ Having read a right of privacy into the Constitution in Griswold, the U.S. 
Supreme Court took a huge leap beyond it in Roe v. Wade.
 
✓ If there is a constitutional right of privacy, this right no doubt gives 
everyone the right over his or her own body. So, nobody has the right to 
cut off your hand or to take your kidney and give it to someone else.
 
 But is a fetus just another part of the pregnant woman’s body? Or is it 
a separate life with its own rights? This is a highly charged moral, reli-
gious, and political question.
 
✓ Even if a fetus is not considered as having any rights — at least in the 
first trimester — why should the right to terminate it belong solely to 
the mother? Does the father have no rights?
 
✓ For the Supreme Court to decide this important issue according to the 
personal beliefs of the majority on the court was, in the words of Justice 
Byron White (dissenting), “an exercise of raw judicial power.” White 
added, “I find nothing in the language or history of the Constitution to 
support the Court’s judgment.”
Even Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a strong pro-choice advocate, has criti-
cized Roe v. Wade as “heavy-handed judicial intervention” in an issue that 
should rather have been left to the democratic political process.
On the other hand, Justice Harry Blackmun, who wrote for the majority in 
Roe v. Wade, firmly believed in abortion rights as fundamental to the equality 
of women.

We the People: 
How the United 
States Is Governed

In this part . . .
T
his part provides an analysis of some of the biggest 
constitutional topics: sovereignty (who really rules 
the United States?); federalism (the power-sharing 
arrangement between the national government and the 
states); the separation of powers between Congress, the 
President, and the courts; and the Commerce Clause 
(probably the most important power wielded by 
Congress). No need to be terrified of these big beasts 
anymore!

Chapter 6
Scrutinizing Sovereignty: 
Who Rules America?
In This Chapter
▶ Figuring out who “We the People” were and are
▶ Measuring the power of the President, Congress, and the Supreme Court
▶ Recognizing states’ influence
▶ Testing some conspiracy theories
“W
e the People” rule the U.S. of A. Right? Ummm, well, maybe not. 
The President and a few other big hitters are involved too. Here 
are the main contenders for the title of ruler of the United States:
 
✓ We the People
 
✓ The President
 
✓ The Congress
 
✓ The U.S. Supreme Court
 
✓ The Council on Foreign Affairs, the Trilateral Commission, and the 
Bilderberg Conference
I examine the claims of each of these contenders in turn. My conclusion is that 
sovereignty isn’t held by any one single person or institution — sovereignty is 
shared among the first four institutions that I have just listed. But that doesn’t 
mean that all four institutions have an equal share. They do not, but the degree 
of dominance that any one institution enjoys at any one time varies in accor-
dance with circumstances and with the personalities concerned.

68
Part II: We the People: How the United States Is Governed 
Introducing “We the People”
The phrase “We the People” entered history when it appeared in the Preamble 
(or introduction) to the U.S. Constitution (see Chapter 4). The Preamble is 
a fanfare proclaiming the nature and purpose of the Constitution. It doesn’t 
form part of the Constitution as a legally enforceable instrument. But courts 
sometimes cite the Preamble as evidence of the Framers’ intentions in drafting 
the Constitution as a whole.
 
Does the use of the phrase “We the People” mean that the Framers claimed to 
be establishing a democracy? Not at all. Ancient constitutions and legal sys-
tems claimed to have been handed down by a god, a king, or some semi-divine 
lawgiver. The Framers tacitly rejected these models and claimed a popular 
basis for the U.S. Constitution — but that is not the same as claiming that 
the system of government established by that constitution was a democracy. 
Indeed, neither the word democracy nor the word democratic figures anywhere 
in the text of the Constitution (see Chapter 1).
Ordaining and establishing a Constitution
The Preamble claims that “We the People . . . do ordain and establish 
this Constitution for the United States of America.” Is this claim true? The 
Constitution was drafted by the Philadelphia Convention made up of 55 del-
egates from 12 of the 13 states. (Rhode Island refused to participate.) The 55 
delegates included most of the Founding Fathers of the nation, with the nota-
ble exceptions of John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, who were both serving 
in Europe at the time. Jefferson described the Convention as “an assembly of 
demigods” but regretted their decision to conduct their deliberations behind 
closed doors.
Who picked these demigods? Not “We the People.” They were selected by 
the state legislatures, which in turn were elected. But only about 15 percent 
of the adult white male population had the right to vote. So “We the People” 
rings a bit hollow as far as the drafting of the Constitution is concerned.
But “We the People” at least ratified (confirmed) the Constitution, right? Not 
exactly. Ratification was entrusted to a specially elected convention in each 
of the 13 states (except Rhode Island). So “We the People” had only an indi-
rect say on ratification.
 
The Constitution did not aim to establish a democracy. Instead, the Framers 
were aiming to establish “a Republican Form of Government” — which was not 
the same thing at all. See Chapter 2 for a full explanation.

69
 Chapter 6: Scrutinizing Sovereignty: Who Rules America?
Resolving to preserve democracy
The first six presidents were all members of a wealthy elite. The election of 
Andrew Jackson to the presidency in 1828 broke with that aristocratic tradition.
Andrew Jackson’s form of democracy
Jackson was an unabashed populist. The first plank in the program of 
Jacksonian democracy was the extension of voting rights to all white men, 
sweeping away property qualifications. Jackson also repeatedly called for a 
constitutional amendment to abolish the Electoral College system, which he 
saw as an undemocratic way of electing the President.
But Jackson was no liberal. His populism extended only to the white popu-
lation; he was himself a slave owner. And his belief in the Manifest Destiny 
of the United States to expand westward and control the whole of North 
America from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean resulted in a less than sympa-
thetic attitude toward Native Americans.
 
As a result of Jackson’s two-term strong presidency followed by the single 
term of the skillful Democratic Party organizer, Martin Van Buren, and that 
of the much underrated James K. Polk, populist democratic ideals became 
widely accepted in the 1840s.
Making democracy fashionable
The acceptability of democracy as a political 
ideal can be gauged from the use of the word 
democratic as a party political label.
Historians often refer to the political party 
founded in 1791 by Thomas Jefferson and 
James Madison as the Democratic-Republican 
Party, but in fact both Jefferson and Madison 
referred to themselves simply as Republicans 
and to their party as the Republican Party down 
to 1823. (That party had nothing to do with the 
modern Republican Party, by the way.)
Adherents of the party of Jefferson and Madison 
were sometimes called democrats — not by 
themselves but as an insult by their opponents, 
who equated democrats with Jacobins, the most 
extreme French revolutionaries. Ex-President 
George Washington himself said of a “pro-
fessed Democrat” that “he will leave nothing 
unattempted to overturn the Government of this 
Country.”
At the party’s first national convention, held in 
1832, it was still calling itself the Republican 
Party. It officially changed its name to the 
Democratic Party only in 1844. By this time 
democratic had become a positive political 
label — thanks largely to Andrew Jackson, who 
was instrumental in extending voting rights to 
all adult white males.

70
Part II: We the People: How the United States Is Governed 
Abraham Lincoln’s vision of democracy
By the time of Abraham Lincoln, who was first elected President in 1860, 
democracy had become quite respectable. Lincoln concluded his famous 
Gettysburg address with a solemn pledge that has echoed down the years:
We here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain — that 
this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom — and that 
government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish 
from the earth.
This is pretty heady stuff. But what exactly does it mean? Lincoln delivered 
his speech on November 19, 1863, just a few months after the bloody battle 
of Gettysburg. The occasion was the dedication of the Soldiers’ National 
Cemetery in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.
Abraham Lincoln doesn’t use the word democracy, but his three rhythmical 
phrases — “government of the people, by the people, for the people” — are 
commonly taken as a definition of democracy.
Was Lincoln holding up democracy as an ideal for the future? Yes, but he 
also seems to have thought that it already existed. Indeed, the theme of his 
two-minute address was that the cause of the Union in the Civil War was the 
cause of democracy.
But did Lincoln really have the right to cast himself as the spokesman for 
democracy? His own election to the presidency in 1860 was anything but a 
landslide. Although he won a majority of electoral votes, he carried only 18 
states out of 33 and got less than 40 percent of the popular vote. His election 
to the presidency was the most divisive in American history. When Lincoln 
was declared the winner of the 1860 presidential election, seven southern 
states seceded even before his inauguration.
Lincoln’s identification with democracy also has another problem, because 
government “by the people” looks very much like direct democracy, which 
has never existed in the United States.
Defining democracy
The word democracy comes to us from the Greek demokratia, meaning the 
“power of the people.”
But can the people ever rule themselves? Well, it did happen in ancient 
Athens — sort of. The citizens all met together in the Ekklesia, or Assembly, 
and deliberated. But only adult males had the rights of citizenship. Women, 
slaves, and resident aliens had no civic rights. Athens had about 30,000 citi-
zens at its height — about 10 percent of the population.

71
 Chapter 6: Scrutinizing Sovereignty: Who Rules America?
Athenian democracy was direct democracy. That form of government would 
be impossible in the United States today with a population of around 300 mil-
lion! Instead, the type of democracy that exists now is indirect or representa-
tive democracy — in which the people don’t run the government themselves 
but pick other people to do it for them.
So, how does an indirect democracy stand up to Lincoln’s three-part test?
 
✓ Government of the people: This is the easy one. Any government is 
automatically a government of the people. It doesn’t have to be a demo-
cratic form of government. A monarchy, a dictatorship, an oligarchy — 
all are governments of the people, but they aren’t governments by the 
people.
 
✓ Government by the people: This is the elusive one. Government by the 
people has never existed in the United States — and could never exist. 
So what was Abe Lincoln thinking of? Or did he just figure that it had a 
nice ring to it as part of a threesome?
 
✓ Government for the people: Every government of every kind every-
where in the world always maintains that it governs in the interests of 
its people — or for the people. This is not a specifically democratic fea-
ture at all.
In fairness to Abe, he probably figured that the sort of indirect, representa-
tive democracy that we have in the United States was actually government by 
the people — a pretty dangerous assumption to make by a guy who got into 
the White House with just 39.8 percent of the popular vote.
Testing for democracy today
But what about today? Is the United States a true democracy in the 21st cen-
tury? Yes and no.
Here are some points in favor of and against classifying the United States as 
a democracy:
 
✓ Everybody over the age of 18 has the right to vote. The voters are usu-
ally presented with a choice of one out of only two candidates — if that. 
The really important election often is not the general election but the 
Democratic or Republican primary.
 
✓ Voters can also pick the candidates for the political party of their 
choice by participating in the primaries. But the choice in primaries is 
usually among a bunch of millionaires because primary candidates have to 
fund their own ad campaigns.

72
Part II: We the People: How the United States Is Governed 
 
✓ Office-holders are mostly restricted to comparatively short terms, like 
four years for the President and two years for members of the House 
of Representatives. Presidents are limited to two elected terms, but repre-
sentatives can be reelected indefinitely — and quite often are!
 
✓ More posts are filled by popular election than in most other countries — 
often including state judges, mayors, school boards, and (previously) 
even dogcatchers. Most elective positions are at the state level. It’s a pity 
federal judges aren’t elected too!
 
✓ Popular or citizens’ initiatives or referenda are the closest thing 
in the United States today to ancient direct democracy. They allow 
the voters a direct say in no fewer than 24 states plus the District of 
Columbia. But initiatives are just votes on specific issues — a far cry from 
decision-making on a day-to-day basis. Also, initiatives exist purely at the 
state level. Moves to allow national initiatives have never gotten very far.
 
✓ The United States has a healthy two-party system that guarantees com-
petition. But quite a number of districts — and even whole states — are 
routinely in the red or blue column.
 
✓ The views represented in U.S. political institutions span a wide range. 
But third parties and independents have little chance of being elected — 
largely because of the winner-take-all electoral system.
So, do “We the People” rule the roost? No, because the power of the people is 
indirect. But We the People must certainly be regarded as having some share 
of sovereignty at least. Let us now turn to the power of the President, which I 
examine in more detail in Chapter 10.
Hailing the Chief
The President of the United States is commonly said to be the most power-
ful person in the world, but how much power does he exercise in the United 
States?
From the beginning, critics of the Constitution were afraid that the President 
would become too monarchical. For example, Patrick Henry, the radical 
revolutionary, characterized the Constitution as “squinting towards monar-
chy.” To counter these fears, George Washington discouraged people from 
addressing him as “Your Excellency,” preferring the more republican appella-
tion, “Mr. President.”
The Framers were careful to incorporate into the Constitution the principle 
of the separation of powers coupled with a system of checks and balances. The 
purpose of this arrangement was to prevent any one of the three branches 
of government — Executive, Legislative, and Judicial — from becoming too 
powerful.

 Chapter 6: Scrutinizing Sovereignty: Who Rules America?
Here are the points in favor of and against regarding the President as 
sovereign:
 
✓ The President combines the position of head of state with executive 
power, so his dominance over the federal government is guaranteed. 
Not so. Periods of strong presidential power have alternated with periods 
when the President was pretty insignificant compared to Congress and the 
Supreme Court. Abraham Lincoln was a strong President, but the Presidents 
who preceded and succeeded him were mostly pretty weak. After the strong 
presidencies of Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, Congress became 
dominant again, until the so-called “imperial presidency” of Franklin D. 
Roosevelt. In 1973, Watergate dealt a severe blow to presidential power, but 
Ronald Reagan put the presidency on a strong footing again, which benefited 
Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.
 
✓ The President has control over foreign affairs and defense, especially 
in times of war. Sure, but the War Powers Act allows Congress to limit 
presidential war powers. The Senate also has the power to block presiden-
tial appointees. And the Supreme Court can clip the President’s wings too, 
as happened with President George W. Bush in regard to Guantanamo Bay.
 
✓ The President can veto bills that have passed Congress, and a presi-
dential veto can be overridden only by a two-thirds majority in both 
houses of Congress. True, but vetoes can backfire, as President Bill 
Clinton found out when his deadlock with Congress over the budget twice 
paralyzed the federal government for months.
At the time of this writing, the power of the President is great but certainly 
not unchallenged. I turn now to Congress, which I examine more closely in 
Chapter 11.
Congress: Flexing Its Lawmaking Muscle
With the exception of the presidencies of Andrew Jackson, James K. Polk, 
and Abraham Lincoln, the first century of the republic was dominated by 
Congress — so much so that when in 1884 a young Woodrow Wilson wrote a 
book about the U.S. constitutional practice, he titled his book Congressional 
Government. He wrote, “The actual form of our present government is simply 
a scheme of congressional supremacy.”
Grover Cleveland, who ended up as both the 22nd and 24th president, broke 
the pattern of weak presidents who were subservient to Congress. He was 
succeeded by several other strong presidents: William McKinley, Theodore 
Roosevelt, and Woodrow Wilson himself. But then came another period of 
congressional dominance — until FDR’s “imperial presidency,” which, with a 
few hiccups along the way, still survives today.

74
Part II: We the People: How the United States Is Governed 
But the conflict between the President and Congress has recently paled in 
comparison with the conflict between the Supreme Court and Congress. Here 
are just a few recent examples:
 
✓ In 1995, the Supreme Court struck down the Gun-Free School Zones Act 
of 1990. This was the first time since the New Deal that the court chal-
lenged Congress’s power under the Commerce Clause of Article I of the 
Constitution (see Chapter 9).
 
✓ In 1997, the Supreme Court struck down part of the Religious Freedom 
Restoration Act of 1993.
 
✓ In 1999, the Supreme Court struck down a federal law allowing citizens 
to sue a state without that state’s consent.
 
✓ In 2000, the Supreme Court struck down parts of the Violence Against 
Women Act of 1994.
 
✓ In the 2008 decision Boumediene v. Bush concerning the lawfulness of 
detaining “enemy combatants” at Guantanamo Bay, the Supreme Court 
struck a blow not only at the President but also declared the Military 
Commissions Act of 2006 unconstitutional.
What has this judicial challenge done to the power wielded by the legisla-
ture? It has undoubtedly weakened Congress to some extent, but not enough 
to have deprived Congress of a share of sovereignty.
The High Court: Saying What the Law Is
The Supreme Court certainly deserves to be up there with the President and 
the Congress as a sharer in sovereignty.
This idea would have come as a shock to the Framers. The Constitution estab-
lishes the principle of the separation of powers, in which the three branches 
of government — the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches — are all 
equal, and each acts as a check and balance against the others.
However, one of the leading Framers of the Constitution, Alexander Hamilton, 
was convinced that, with separation of powers, the judiciary “will always be 
the least dangerous” to the other two branches of government. He contrasted 
the powers of the three branches:
The Executive not only dispenses the honors, but holds the sword of the 
community. The legislature not only commands the purse, but prescribes 
the rules by which the duties and rights of every citizen are to be regulated. 
The judiciary, on the contrary, has no influence over either the sword or the 
purse; no direction either of the strength or of the wealth of the society; and 

75
 Chapter 6: Scrutinizing Sovereignty: Who Rules America?
can take no active resolution whatever. It may truly be said to have neither 
FORCE nor WILL, but merely judgment; and must ultimately depend upon 
the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of its judgments.
Hamilton drew this conclusion:
It proves incontestably, that the judiciary is beyond comparison the weakest 
of the three departments of power; that it can never attack with success 
either of the other two; and that all possible care is requisite to enable it to 
defend itself against their attacks.
From a present-day vantage point, Hamilton’s view of the judiciary as a 
shrinking violet seems almost laughable. For example, Hamilton speaks of the 
power to “prescribe the rules by which the duties and rights of every citizen 
are to be regulated.” This is a perfect description of one of the many powers 
exercised by the Supreme Court — but Hamilton attributes it to Congress!
 
Hamilton wrote the words that I have just quoted in 1788. Hamilton could not 
have known how completely the role of the Supreme Court was to be trans-
formed by Chief Justice John Marshall, who held office from 1801 to 1835. In 
the famous case of Marbury v. Madison, decided in 1803, Marshall said,
It is emphatically the province and the duty of the judicial department to say 
what the law is.
These words are so important and so often quoted that they can now be seen 
inscribed on the wall of the Supreme Court building behind John Marshall’s 
statue.
 
But where in the Constitution does it say that the Supreme Court has this huge 
power? Nowhere. So, where did Marshall get this idea from? It was one of his 
many twistifications — Thomas Jefferson’s word to describe the way in which 
Marshall’s mind worked. (And Jefferson ought to have known, as the two men 
were distant cousins and lifelong foes.)
The word “emphatically” in Marshall’s quotation is a dead giveaway. If the 
courts really had the power that Marshall says they had, there would have been 
no need to use the word emphatically at all. Emphatically is a word of argument, 
of debate. Marshall puts it in to underline the claim that he is making for the 
court — a claim that goes way beyond anything that the Constitution envisioned.
Jefferson, the third President, recognized the danger of judicial activism. He 
wrote these words during his presidency in 1804, the year after Marbury v. 
Madison:
But the opinion which gives to the judges the right to decide what laws are 
constitutional, and what not, not only for themselves in their own sphere 
of action, but for the legislature and executive also, in their spheres, would 
make the judiciary a despotic branch.

76
Part II: We the People: How the United States Is Governed 
Charles Evans Hughes, Chief Justice from 1930 to 1941, famously said, “We 
are under a Constitution, but the Constitution is what the judges say it is.” 
This looks like a cynical recognition of the power of the Supreme Court. But 
Hughes then went on to say, “and the judiciary is the safeguard of our liberty 
and our property under the Constitution.” So, he recognized the power of the 
judges but saw it as a power for good.
It’s impossible to disagree with Hughes’s assessment of the power of the 
Supreme Court, but not everyone would agree with his characterization of 
that power as benign.
I deal with the judiciary in Chapter 12. Here I list just a few of the issues in 
regard to which the Supreme Court has recently reinterpreted the law:
 
✓ The death penalty
 
✓ Gun law
 
✓ The rights of “enemy combatants”
 
✓ Affirmative action
 
✓ Police powers
Giving the States Their Due
Do the states have a share in the sovereignty of the United States? 
Absolutely. The history of the United States could easily be written in terms 
of the tensions between state and federal power.
I deal with the power of the states in Chapters 7 and 20. But here are just a 
few of the landmarks in the interaction between federal and state power:
 
✓ The Articles of Confederation, in force between 1777 and 1789, were the 
first instrument of government of the United States. They provided for a 
loose association of 13 sovereign states (which proved unsatisfactory).
 
✓ The Philadelphia Convention of 1787 was called in order to provide the 
United States with a stronger central government. The Constitution was 
drafted, as the Preamble says, “in Order to form a more perfect Union” 
(plus to accomplish a few other objectives).
 
✓ Slavery posed a problem right from the start because some states 
entered the Union as slave states and others as free states. The problem 
did not go away. As new territories were taken over and became states, it 
had to be decided whether slavery was to be allowed in each one or not.

77
 Chapter 6: Scrutinizing Sovereignty: Who Rules America?
 
✓ Did states have the right to secede from the Union? This question 
was never conclusively answered before 1861. Then in 1861 came 
the Civil War, or the War between the States, in which 11 southern 
states seceded and formed the Confederate States of America, or the 
Confederacy.
 
✓ The victory of the North over the South in 1865 ushered in a period 
of Reconstruction in which all but one of the secessionist states were 
placed under military governors.
 
✓ The victory of the Union also led to the Fourteenth Amendment, which 
extended to the states many of the obligations of the federal government.
 
✓ The passing of the Sixteenth Amendment in 1913, which legalized fed-
eral income tax, placed citizens more directly under federal power than 
before.
 
✓ The Great Depression leading to FDR’s “New Deal,” followed by World 
War II, placed more power in the hands of the federal government than 
ever before.
 
✓ The so-called Dixiecrats, a breakaway movement from the Democratic 
Party in the South, fought unsuccessfully for more states’ rights, espe-
cially in the interests of segregation.
 
✓ The rise of the Civil Rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s and its sup-
port by the Democratic Party at the federal level drove many conserva-
tive southern Democrats into the arms of the Republican Party.
 
✓ The U.S. Supreme Court under Chief Justice William Rehnquist broke 
with long tradition and started supporting states’ rights increasingly 
from 1995 onward in what is sometimes called the new federalism. This 
trend has continued to some extent under Chief Justice John Roberts, 
who was appointed in 2005.
Uncovering Conspiracies
Conspiracy theories have been around forever. Any organization or group 
of people that was a bit separate from the rest of society, a bit different, or 
a bit secretive was likely to find itself targeted as holding the controlling 
power behind the scenes. The theory behind this kind of thinking is that 
the Constitution is just a front for the exercise of power by some group or 
groups. Groups that have been targeted in this way include the Jews, the 
Catholic Church, and the Freemasons.

78
Part II: We the People: How the United States Is Governed 
Three associated organizations — the Council on Foreign Relations, the 
Trilateral Commission, and the Bilderberg Conference — have been attacked in 
recent years as being the secret power-brokers not only over the United States 
but also internationally. Here’s a brief rundown on these three organizations:
 
✓ The Council on Foreign Relations is a private, U.S.-based organization 
established in 1921 and dedicated to a study of foreign policy. Its mem-
bers include Republicans, Democrats, and independents. It is widely 
believed to have had considerable influence on U.S. foreign policy, 
including the normalization of relations with Red China.
 
✓ The Trilateral Commission is a private association of about 350 mem-
bers established in 1973. The idea behind it was to develop closer 
economic cooperation between North America, Europe, and Japan. Its 
membership is said to include former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger; 
former U.S. presidents Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, and Bill Clinton; 
former Vice President Dick Cheney; and Senator John McCain.
 
✓ The Bilderberg Group, Club, or Conference is the strangest of the 
three associated organizations, as its 130 members meet only once a 
year. The group was founded in 1954 to counter growing anti-Ameri-
can sentiment in Western Europe by fostering mutual understanding 
between Europe and the United States. There are generally two invitees 
from each participating nation: one conservative and one liberal. The 
membership of this club overlaps to quite a marked extent with that 
of the Trilateral Commission and to some extent also with that of the 
Council on Foreign Relations.
The membership of the three organizations includes a lot of influential names. 
But are they influential because of their membership, or are they members 
because they were already influential? The latter seems to be the case.
The three organizations have been accused of aiming to establish a single 
world government or “New World Order,” in which the United States would 
lose its separate identity and become absorbed into an international state 
ruled by a small elite. But if that is the plan, it doesn’t appear to have made 
much headway so far.

Federalism: Forming 
One out of Many
In This Chapter
▶ Tracing the history of U.S. federalism
▶ Evaluating John Marshall’s contribution to federal power
▶ Placing the “new federalism” under the microscope
▶ Asking the big questions about states’ rights
T
he United States has a federal system of government, right? Right. Any 
time anybody doesn’t like what the federal government is doing, he 
blames “the feds.” And when you come across a government acronym starting 
with the letter “F”, chances are it stands for Federal (think FBI, FCC, FDIC . . .).
 
The United States has a federal system of government, but the word federal 
doesn’t figure anywhere in the text of the Constitution. This fact raises some 
pretty important questions, which I tackle in this chapter:
 
✓ What is federalism?
 
✓ How do we know that the United States has a federal system of 
government?
 
✓ Has U.S. federalism changed over time and, if so, how?
Tracing the Origins of U.S. Federalism
A federal system of government is one in which power is shared between the 
federal government — the central or national government — and the state, 
provincial, or regional governments. The United States is the oldest federal 
nation in the world, but it sure isn’t the only one. Just a few of the other coun-
tries that also have federal systems of government are Argentina, Australia, 
Austria, Brazil, Canada, Germany, India, Mexico, and Nigeria.

Part II: We the People: How the United States Is Governed 
Analyzing the founding documents
The United States began life as 13 separate British colonies, which united 
in opposition to their treatment by the British government of the day — 
particularly against the imposition of taxes by the British Parliament, on 
which the American colonies were not represented. This opposition was 
expressed in the slogan “No taxation without representation.”
The Declaration of Independence
The Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776, was headed “The unanimous 
Declaration of the thirteen united States of America.” We are now used to 
using the term “The United States of America” as referring to one single coun-
try. But that phrase didn’t have the same meaning back in 1776 — as can be 
seen from a close reading of the text of the Declaration. The concluding part 
of the Declaration is particularly revealing. It declares
That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and 
Independent States; . . . and that as Free and Independent States, they 
have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish 
Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States 
may of right do.
 
The Declaration of Independence is commonly taken to mark the beginning of 
the existence of the United States of America as a nation. The Declaration cer-
tainly severed all ties with Britain, but it did not create a single new country. 
Instead, it created 13 separate new countries. Notice that the language of the 
Declaration is all in the plural. The key to its meaning lies in the last sentence 
that I have quoted. Each of the states, says the Declaration, has the power to 
make war and peace! And the end of the quoted passage contains an assertion 
that the 13 colonies are “Independent States.”
The Articles of Confederation
The Articles of Confederation, passed by Congress in 1777 and formally ratified 
in 1781, served as the constitution of the United States from 1777 until 1788.
 
A confederation is a weaker form of association between states than a federa-
tion. The best-known confederation today is Switzerland, which has a very 
weak — almost nonexistent — central government. Power resides with the 
governments of the 26 cantons that together form the Swiss Confederation.
The American Articles of Confederation recognized the sovereignty of each of 
the 13 states. Article II of this document made the position quite clear:
Each state retains its sovereignty, freedom, and independence, and every 
power, jurisdiction, and right, which is not by this Confederation expressly 
delegated to the United States, in Congress assembled.

81
 Chapter 7: Federalism: Forming One out of Many 
The Congress was the only central institution established by the Articles 
of Confederation. The Congress was not an elected body but was made up 
of delegates appointed by each of the state legislatures for a year at a time. 
Congress had power only over foreign affairs and defense. The Articles of 
Confederation did not establish any form of central executive or any national 
courts. The Articles established not a single country but merely “a firm 
league of friendship” among the 13 sovereign states.
Forming “a more perfect Union”
The form of government set up under the Articles of Confederation was hope-
lessly weak, and conflicts among the states arose. George Washington and 
some other leading figures recognized the need for a new constitution “to 
form a more perfect Union.” So a “Grand Convention” was called to meet in 
Philadelphia in May 1787. Its original purpose was to revise and amend the 
Articles of Confederation, but the Convention ended up drafting a whole new 
instrument of government: the U.S. Constitution.
The first printed draft of the Constitution, dated August 6, 1787, is signifi-
cantly different from the final version approved by the Convention only a 
few weeks later, on September 17, 1787. Instead of the now-familiar “We the 
People of the United States” in the Preamble, the earlier draft had a list of all 
the states:
We the People of the States of New-Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode-
Island and Providence Plantations, Connecticut, New-York, New-Jersey, 
Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North-Carolina, South-Carolina, 
and Georgia, do ordain, declare and establish the following Constitution for 
the Government of Ourselves and our Posterity.
The change from this formulation to “We the People of the United States” sig-
nals a last-minute shift in emphasis from the states to the national government.
However, both versions of the Constitution assert the supremacy of the U.S. 
Constitution and federal law over the state constitutions and laws. In the final 
version of the Constitution, this fundamental principle is found in the so-
called “Supremacy Clause” in Article VI:
This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in 
Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the 
Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the 
judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution 
or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.

82
Part II: We the People: How the United States Is Governed 
 
Does the Supremacy Clause mean that the federal government can simply ride 
roughshod over the states and do whatever it likes? No. The Supremacy 
Clause gives supremacy to the federal (or union) government subject to the 
limits imposed upon it by the Constitution. The Tenth Amendment makes the 
position clear:
The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor 
prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to 
the people.
This amendment, ratified in 1791 together with the other nine amendments 
that form the Bill of Rights, sets out the true historical perspective of the way 
the Constitution came into existence:
 
✓ Power originated with the people of each individual state.
 
✓ In each state, the people delegated some of their power to their state 
government.
 
✓ In the U.S. Constitution, the states then delegated some of these powers 
to the federal government — for example, the power to make war and 
peace with foreign countries.
Banking on McCulloch v. Maryland
McCulloch v. Maryland, decided in 1819, was one of the earliest Supreme 
Court cases — and by far the most important — to deal with the relation-
ship between the federal and state governments. Chief Justice John Marshall 
wrote the unanimous opinion of the court. The two main questions before 
the court were these:
 
✓ “Has Congress power to incorporate a bank?” (in the words of Chief 
Justice Marshall).
 
✓ If so, do the states have the right to tax such a bank?
In 1816, Congress incorporated the second Bank of the United States by 
granting it a charter. The federal government owned only 20 percent of the 
bank stock, so the bank was essentially a privately owned corporation. But 
there was a lot of opposition to the whole idea of a bank that could open 
branches in any state without a charter from that state.
The state of Maryland imposed a tax on all banknotes issued by the Bank of 
the United States. This tax was apparently intended as a punitive measure 
against the federal government.

83
 Chapter 7: Federalism: Forming One out of Many 
Testing the limits of federal power
“Has Congress power to incorporate a bank?” asked Chief Justice Marshall. 
This was not an easy question for Marshall, a dyed-in-the-wool Federalist who 
believed in upholding federal power at the expense of the states.
Marshall desperately wanted to find in favor of the federal government, 
but he was forced to recognize that federal power was limited under the 
Constitution. Referring to the Supremacy Clause in Article VI, Marshall said:
If any one proposition could command the universal assent of mankind, we 
might expect it would be this — that the government of the Union, though 
limited in its power, is supreme within its sphere of action.
“Supreme within its sphere of action”? Okay. But this formulation begs the 
question: “What is its sphere of action?” Maryland struck a potentially killer 
blow by invoking the last clause of Article I, Section 8, which provided that
The Congress shall have Power . . . To make all Laws which shall be 
necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and 
all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United 
States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.
Maryland argued that the phrase “necessary and proper” places a severe 
restriction on the legislative power of Congress, because it must mean that 
Congress can pass only those laws that are “necessary and proper” for imple-
menting the powers listed in Article I, Section 8.
But Marshall didn’t accept this apparently unanswerable point. He was in a 
characteristically combative mood, and he constructed an argument in sup-
port of the federal government.
Expanding the definition of “necessary”
Marshall redefined the word “necessary” to suit his purpose. This is one of 
Marshall’s most unpersuasive “twistifications” (Thomas Jefferson’s phrase). 
Marshall first correctly distinguished necessary from absolutely necessary. But 
he then proceeded to equate necessary with “convenient, or useful, or essen-
tial.” The first two of these, from a purely linguistic or semantic point of view 
(whether in 1819 or today), are just plain wrong.
But this twistification enabled him to conclude that “To employ the means 
necessary to an end is generally understood as employing any means calcu-
lated to produce the end, and not as being confined to those single means 
without which the end would be entirely unattainable.”

84
Part II: We the People: How the United States Is Governed 
Marshall was now practically home and dry. Having destroyed the force of 
the “necessary and proper” clause, he was able to greatly widen the powers 
of the federal government and, in so doing, to curb those of the states.
Skirting the question of Congress’s scope of power
 
Marshall had now established to his own satisfaction that “There is nothing 
in the Constitution of the United States . . . which exclude[s] incidental or 
implied powers.”
Sidestepping the “necessary and proper” clause enabled Marshall to pro-
pound another grandiose principle: “If the end be legitimate, and within the 
scope of the Constitution, all the means which are appropriate, which are 
plainly adapted to that end, and which are not prohibited, may constitution-
ally be employed to carry it into effect.”
Realizing the repercussions
Why is McCulloch v. Maryland considered a landmark case? Because it estab-
lished some fundamental constitutional principles. The fact that some of 
these principles are based on very dubious twistifications has not affected 
the continued acceptance of the principles themselves.
 
Following are the principles established in McCulloch v. Maryland. Not all the 
principles that Marshall put forward in that case are wrong. The principles 
that I consider to be true constitutional principles are printed in bold; those 
principles that are more likely to be true than not are printed in plain text; and 
the principles based on twistifications are shown in italic. So, here goes:
 
✓ Federal law is superior to state law.
 
✓ The U.S. Constitution is the highest form of law.
 
✓ The federal government possesses only those powers that are del-
egated to it by the U.S. Constitution.
 
✓ But these powers must be broadly interpreted.
 
✓ In particular, the “necessary and proper” clause in Article I, Section 8 of 
the Constitution must be read not as limiting congressional power but as 
expanding it.

85
 Chapter 7: Federalism: Forming One out of Many 
Navigating the Commerce Clause 
with John Marshall
After Marshall effectively knocked the “necessary and proper” clause on the 
head in the case of McCulloch v. Maryland, the conflict between federal and 
state power shifted to the interpretation of the Commerce Clause, which 
remains to this day a potential battleground between the feds and the states.
The Commerce Clause appears in the long list of powers granted to Congress 
in Article I, Section 8. The clause grants Congress the power
To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, 
and with the Indian Tribes.
The case of Gibbons v. Ogden, decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1824, was 
a lot easier for Chief Justice Marshall to handle than the rather tricky case of 
McCulloch v. Maryland.
Both Aaron Ogden and Thomas Gibbons had a supposedly exclusive license 
to operate a ferry service between New York and New Jersey. Ogden’s 
license was issued by the State of New York, while Gibbons was licensed by 
Congress. The question before the U.S. Supreme Court was this: Did the grant 
of navigation licenses fall within the Commerce Clause? If it involved the reg-
ulation of interstate commerce, then it did fall within the Commerce Clause. If 
this was indeed the case, then navigation was a matter for Congress and not 
for the states.
Marshall had no trouble finding that navigation was a branch of commerce 
and that the ferry service in question was a matter of interstate commerce, 
the regulation of which was reserved by the Constitution to Congress. 
This clear decision set the tone for subsequent Commerce Clause disputes 
between the feds and the states for a long time to come. See the next section 
of this chapter and also Chapter 9 for later twists and turns in this saga.
Riding the Federalism Rollercoaster
The United States has had a rollercoaster ride along the federalism highway — 
including a serious detour in the shape of the Civil War. Here are just a few of 
the major milestones viewed from a constitutional standpoint:
 
✓ 1819: McCulloch v. Maryland, discussed earlier in this chapter.
 
✓ 1824: Gibbons v. Ogden, discussed in the previous section.

86
Part II: We the People: How the United States Is Governed 
 
✓ 1851: Cooley v. Board of Wardens. John Marshall was succeeded in 1835 
as Chief Justice by Roger Taney, a Jacksonian Democrat who was much 
more favorable to states’ rights than Marshall. The Cooley case was 
remarkably similar to Gibbons v. Ogden, but an opposite conclusion 
was reached. A Pennsylvania law required all ships entering or leav-
ing a Philadelphia harbor to hire a local pilot. The question before the 
Supreme Court was whether this law violated the Commerce Clause of 
the Constitution. The court said no — a result that could never have 
been reached on the Marshall court!
 
✓ 1861–1865: The Civil War. I discuss this crucial time later in this chapter.
 
✓ 1869: Texas v. White. In this case, decided during the so-called 
Reconstruction period that followed the Civil War, the Supreme Court 
ruled that states were not allowed by the Constitution to secede from 
the Union, and that any legislation passed by a secessionist state was 
“absolutely null.”
 
✓ 1877: Pensacola Telegraph Co. v. Western Union Telegraph Co. The Civil War 
and Reconstruction — when the South was occupied by Union troops — 
strengthened the hand of the federal government against the states. The 
growing industrialization of the country intensified this development 
still further. The Pensacola case provides a good example of this fact. 
The court ruled that Congress’s power under the Commerce Clause to 
regulate interstate commerce included the right to establish telegraph 
lines, and that states could not interfere with this federal power.
 
✓ 1886: Wabash, St. Louis & Pacific Railroad Company v. Illinois. Illinois 
passed a law regulating interstate transportation contracts. The U.S. 
Supreme Court ruled that this law violated the Commerce Clause. This 
decision marked a major departure from the Cooley case. Wabash led 
to the creation in 1887 of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), 
which survived until 1995, when its functions were transferred to the 
Surface Transportation Board. The ICC was the first of the so-called 
independent agencies of the U.S. government, of which there are now 
several hundred. Although independent, these agencies are mostly run 
by appointees of the federal government, and their rules or regulations 
have the force of federal law. Wabash and the establishment of the ICC 
therefore mark a major turning point in favor of federal power.
 
✓ 1895: The Sugar Trust Case. The feds’ big victory of 1886–1887 was put on 
hold by the rise of a new breed of Supreme Court justices, who placed 
the principle of freedom of contract ahead of most anything else. Under 
the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, the federal government asked for the 
cancellation of some contracts that gave the American Sugar Refining 
Company a monopoly of sugar manufacture in the United States. But the 
Supreme Court refused to play ball with the feds. The court ruled that 
manufacture did not fall within the Commerce Clause. Interstate com-
merce, it held, does not begin until goods “commence their final move-
ment from their State of origin to that of their destination.”

 Chapter 7: Federalism: Forming One out of Many 
 
✓ 1905–1937: This period is often termed the Lochner era, named for a con-
troversial U.S. Supreme Court decision striking down a New York labor 
law that limited the number of permissible hours of work in bakeries — on 
the basis that the state law violated the freedom of contract of employers 
and employees alike. Lochner itself clearly didn’t favor the states any more 
than it assisted the feds. The doctrine of freedom of contract opposed 
government interference in the economy in general. It didn’t distinguish 
between state and federal government intervention.
 
 In the 1930s, the doctrine of freedom of contract was used to strike 
down program after program of FDR’s New Deal. This opposition to the 
President’s policies came to a sudden end in 1937, and in the period after 
that the Supreme Court handed the economy, bound hand to foot, over 
to the federal government. I discuss this topic in depth in Chapter 9.
 
✓ 1951: Dean Milk Co. v. City of Madison. The doctrine of the “Dormant 
Commerce Clause” is sometimes used to strike down state laws. This 
doctrine has been traced to a couple of throwaway remarks made by 
Chief Justice John Marshall back in the 1820s, but it really came into its 
own only in the latter half of the 20th century. The Dormant Commerce 
Clause doctrine says that a state law violates the Commerce Clause if it 
interferes with interstate commerce — even if Congress hasn’t already 
legislated on the particular product or issue concerned. The Dean Milk 
Co. case is a typical example of the cases decided under the Dormant 
Commerce Clause.
 
 The case dealt with a municipal law that required all milk sold in 
Madison, Wisconsin, to have been pasteurized within 5 miles of the city, 
a law justified by its proponents as being necessary for the health of 
the consumers. The Supreme Court struck the law down, even though 
Congress had never legislated milk issues, because it discriminated 
against out-of-state milk producers (even though it also discriminated 
against Wisconsin milk producers who happened to be more than 5 
miles from Madison!).
 
 The Dormant Commerce Clause is a highly controversial judge-made 
doctrine, which is rejected by some Supreme Court justices.
 
✓ 1995: United States v. Lopez. Such was the power of the federal govern-
ment over the economy between 1937 and 1995 that during the whole 
of that period the U.S. Supreme Court didn’t strike down a single federal 
law as being an unconstitutional exercise of power under the Commerce 
Clause. But in Lopez, the court did declare a federal statute unconstitu-
tional, and it also set aside part of a federal law five years later in United 
States v. Morrison. These decisions were hailed by some as a sign of the 
“new federalism” heralded by Chief Justice William Rehnquist. But then 
in 2005 came Gonzales v. Raich, which was a step backward. For more 
on these developments, see Chapter 9.

Part II: We the People: How the United States Is Governed 
Ignoring the Elephant in the Room: 
The Question of State Sovereignty
The U.S. Constitution is not at all clear about the status of the states and 
their relationship with the federal government. Above all, are the states sov-
ereign? And what is the meaning of sovereignty anyway?
Defining sovereignty
A sovereign state is one that has complete legal independence. For example, 
the United Kingdom is a sovereign state, but Scotland is not. Scotland forms 
part of the United Kingdom and enjoys a high degree of autonomy, or self-
rule, but Scotland does not have complete legal independence.
 
The United States started out as 13 British colonies that declared themselves 
individually independent as 13 sovereign states. In 1777, these 13 sovereign 
states banded together under the Articles of Confederation, which recognized 
each of the states as sovereign.
This loose association of sovereign states didn’t work out too well, which is 
why the U.S. Constitution was created. But the Constitution didn’t directly 
address the question of whether the 13 states were still sovereign or whether 
they had surrendered some of their independence to the federal government.
A sovereign state automatically enjoys sovereign immunity, meaning that it 
can’t be prosecuted for any crime or sued in a civil court unless the sovereign 
state itself gives permission for that to happen. (That’s why cars belonging to 
the representatives of foreign nations can ignore parking tickets — a serious 
problem in Washington, D.C. and New York City!)
Are the states of the United States sovereign, and do they enjoy sovereign 
immunity? The Eleventh Amendment, which was intended to settle this 
issue, can be interpreted in four different ways! The most generally accepted, 
though vague, answer to these tricky questions is that the states are not sov-
ereign in the fullest sense of that term and that they therefore enjoy only par-
tial immunity from suit. For more on this discussion, see Chapter 20.

89
 Chapter 7: Federalism: Forming One out of Many 
Testing state sovereignty: 
Chisholm v. Georgia
The question of sovereignty arose early in the history of the U.S. Supreme 
Court, in the leading case of Chisholm v. Georgia, decided in 1793. Alexander 
Chisholm of South Carolina filed suit against the state of Georgia for breach 
of contract, seeking payment for goods supplied to Georgia during the War of 
Independence.
Georgia refused to enter an appearance before the U.S. Supreme Court, argu-
ing that, as a state, it possessed sovereign immunity from suit and could be 
sued only if it gave its consent. The court found in favor of Chisholm and 
held that Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution took away the states’ sov-
ereign immunity because in the list of cases that could be heard by the U.S. 
Supreme Court that section included “Controversies . . . between a State and 
Citizens of another State.”
Such was the outcry against this decision that the Eleventh Amendment was 
passed to stop any such suits from being brought in the future. I discuss this 
amendment in Chapter 20.
Can a state secede from the union?
Can a state lawfully secede from the United States of America? The 
Constitution doesn’t provide an answer to this crucial question.
When 11 southern states did in fact secede in 1860–1861and constituted 
themselves into the Confederate States of America, — or the Confederacy, as 
it’s commonly known — their action was condemned as “rebellion,” and a 
bloody civil war ensued.
Would it have made any difference if secession had been clearly permitted 
under the U.S. Constitution? Probably not. But the legal position remains 
unclear to the present day.
Dredging up the Articles of Confederation
In the 1869 case of Texas v. White, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Texas 
had remained a state throughout the Civil War, that its secession from the 
Union was unconstitutional, and that the laws passed by its secessionist 
state government were “absolutely null.” Amazingly, the court based its con-
clusion not on the U.S. Constitution but on its predecessor, the Articles of 
Confederation, which were in effect from 1777 until 1788.

90
Part II: We the People: How the United States Is Governed 
The argument put forward by Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase was as follows:
 
✓ The Articles of Confederation, passed in 1777 and ratified in 1781, 
described themselves as “perpetual,” meaning eternal and unchangeable.
 
✓ The Articles of Confederation were found to be “inadequate to the exi-
gencies of the country,” so “the Constitution was ordained ‘to form a 
more perfect Union.’”
 
✓ “It is difficult to convey the idea of indissoluble unity more clearly than 
by these words. What can be indissoluble if a perpetual Union, made 
more perfect, is not?”
 
On the face of it, this argument looks persuasive, but it falls apart on closer 
scrutiny. Chief Justice Chase based his argument primarily on the Articles of 
Confederation. But the key fact is that the Articles were no longer in force in 
1869. They ceased to have any legal effect the moment they were replaced by 
the U.S. Constitution in 1788. Couldn’t the Constitution also have expressed 
itself as creating a perpetual union? Sure, but it didn’t. Why not? We just don’t 
know — and we can’t call James Madison to ask.
What about Chase’s argument regarding “a more perfect Union”? His point 
is that the Constitution actually goes even further than the Articles of 
Confederation — because the Articles created a perpetual union and the 
Constitution built on it and made it “more perfect.”
 
Chase’s argument is flawed because the concept of a perpetual union is a 
matter of time, whereas the concept of a “more perfect Union” is a matter of 
degree of closeness. The Articles are talking apples, while the Constitution is 
talking pears. You can’t add apples and pears together. The one doesn’t build 
on the other.
But it’s easy enough to see why Chief Justice Chase was anxious to conclude 
that secession was unconstitutional:
 
✓ The year was 1869, and Texas and the other secessionist states were in 
the throes of Reconstruction.
 
✓ Chase himself had been Secretary of the Treasury in President Abraham 
Lincoln’s cabinet.
 
✓ Chase and four other justices who sat on Texas v. White were appointed 
to the Supreme Court bench by Abraham Lincoln.
So, did the Supreme Court have an ulterior political motive for declaring that 
secession was unconstitutional? You betcha!

Chapter 8
Separation of Powers: 
To Each His Own
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the meaning of this doctrine
▶ Giving each branch its own membership and function
▶ Bringing checks and balances into the mix
T
he separation of powers is one of the fundamental principles of the U.S. 
Constitution — right up there with federalism, democracy, the rule of 
law, and judicial review. And like these other principles, the separation of 
powers is not specifically mentioned in the text of the Constitution.
What exactly is the meaning of separation of powers? At its simplest, this doc-
trine refers to separation between the three branches of government:
 
✓ Legislative: Congress, the lawmaking branch of government
 
✓ Executive: The President, who has the duty under Article II, Section 3 of 
the Constitution to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed”
 
✓ Judicial: The Supreme Court justices and other judges who interpret 
and enforce the law through the courts
We must examine separation of powers from four angles:
 
✓ The membership of the three branches of government
 
✓ The functions of the three branches of government
 
✓ The purpose of separation of powers
 
✓ Checks and balances between the three branches
I discuss each of these topics in this chapter, but first I trawl the text of the 
Constitution for any cryptic references to separation of powers.

92
Part II: We the People: How the United States Is Governed 
No Moonlighting for the President
Although the Constitution never uses the phrase separation of powers, it does 
contain some oblique references to that principle. This fact is significant, 
because it shows that separation of powers was embedded in the Constitution 
from the beginning but the Framers took the principle for granted.
Here are the references to separation of powers in the Constitution:
 
✓ Article I, Section 1 gives Congress “all legislative Powers” under the 
Constitution. This means that the other two branches of government 
are not allowed to be involved in legislation. (In reality, they both are 
involved, as we see when we look at the workings of checks and bal-
ances later in this chapter.)
 
✓ Article III, Section 1 similarly reads, “The judicial Power of the United 
States shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts 
as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.” Although 
this section doesn’t say “All judicial Power,” the phrase “The judicial 
Power” makes it clear that the courts are to have all judicial power, 
excluding the other two branches of government from judicial activities.
 
✓ Article II, Section 1 forbids the President from receiving any pay-
ment from the United States or any of the states besides his salary as 
President. This means that the President isn’t allowed to moonlight as 
a senator or a judge. Here’s the actual wording: “The President shall, at 
stated Times, receive for his Services, a Compensation . . . and he shall 
not receive within that Period any other Emolument from the United 
States, or any of them.”
Tracing the origins of separation of powers
The Framers of the Constitution constantly had 
before their eyes the examples of Britain and 
Europe. They adopted what they liked from these 
systems, modified the features that they thought 
needed tweaking, and rejected the rest.
In France, Spain, and other so-called absolute 
monarchies, a great deal of power was concen-
trated in the hands of the King. King Louis XIV of 
France famously remarked, “I am the state.”
The American Founding Fathers greatly admired 
the writings of Baron de Montesquieu, an 
18th-century French aristocrat who praised the 
British Constitution for its supposed separation 
of powers. In fact, Montesquieu had an exag-
gerated impression of the degree of separation 
of powers that actually existed in the British 
Constitution.
The Framers of the U.S. Constitution had no 
firsthand experience of the workings of the 
British Constitution. They simply accepted 
Montesquieu’s analysis of the British 
Constitution, together with his theoretical 
framework.

93
 Chapter 8: Separation of Powers: To Each His Own 
Keeping the Branches Apart
Would it be possible to have strict separation between the members of the 
three branches of government without strict separation of functions? Yes, 
it would — and that is the case with the U.S. Constitution. For example, the 
President can never be a member of the legislature or the judiciary, but he 
does exercise some legislative functions and actually appoints the federal 
judiciary. (To be more precise, the President nominates the federal judges, 
who must be confirmed by the Senate. If they are confirmed, the President 
appoints them as federal judges.) The sections that follow explore the mem-
bership and functions of each branch of the U.S. government.
Membership
Separation of powers is strictly observed in regard to membership of the 
three branches of government:
 
✓ No member of the legislature — Congress — is allowed to hold an execu-
tive position at the same time.
 
✓ No member of Congress is allowed to hold a judicial post — as a 
Supreme Court justice or other judge — at the same time.
 
✓ Neither the President — the executive head of the nation — nor any 
member of his Cabinet is allowed to combine that position with a seat in 
Congress.
 
✓ Neither the President nor any member of his Cabinet is allowed to com-
bine that position with a judicial post.
 
✓ No justice of the Supreme Court or any other judge is allowed to com-
bine that judicial position with a Cabinet post or a seat in Congress.
The President comes to Congress every year to give the State of the Union 
address, but he or she is not a member of Congress. That is why the 
Congress generally goes wild when the President arrives, with everyone 
wanting to shake his hand or even get his autograph — and why large num-
bers of normally staid legislators jump to their feet every few minutes during 
the President’s speech.
It’s unthinkable that the President could be a member of Congress while serv-
ing as President, even though that kind of combination is quite normal (even 
obligatory) in many other countries, like Britain, Ireland, and Germany. But 
where in the U.S. Constitution does it say that the President is not allowed to 
combine these two positions? The only reference to this rule is the oblique 
prohibition that we’ve already looked at in Article II, Section 1:

94
Part II: We the People: How the United States Is Governed 
The President shall, at stated Times, receive for his Services, a 
Compensation . . . and he shall not receive within that Period any other 
Emolument from the United States, or any of them.
Does this mean that it’s okay for an incumbent President to serve as a member 
of Congress as long as he doesn’t get a paycheck for doing so? Ummm, no.
The same rule applies to the President’s Cabinet, to whom the President del-
egates some of his executive power. Neither the Secretary of State, nor the 
Secretary of the Treasury, nor the Attorney General, nor any other Cabinet 
member is allowed to combine that position with a seat in Congress.
But why doesn’t the Constitution spell out this prohibition more directly?
The Philadelphia Convention that passed the Constitution recognized the 
need for strict separation between the three branches in their membership 
while retaining flexibility of function. But the Convention stopped short of 
putting this two-pronged rule into words — except in the oblique manner 
that I have already mentioned.
The reason for this omission is unknown, but the rule of strict separation 
among the membership of the three branches has nevertheless been reli-
giously followed at all times.
Not only is it unconstitutional to hold office in more than one branch of the 
government at the same time, but it is also illegal under state law in many 
states even to run for more than one office at the same time. When Lyndon 
Johnson was picked as John Kennedy’s vice presidential running mate in the 
1960 presidential race, Johnson also ran for a third term in the U.S. Senate — 
just in case the Kennedy–Johnson ticket lost the election.
Johnson had to get Texas law changed in order to be permitted to run for 
both offices at the same time — in what came to be called “Lyndon’s law.” 
Johnson won both elections, but he made no attempt to hold down both 
positions. As soon as his second term in the Senate ended on January 3, 
1961 — and before being inaugurated as Vice President — Johnson resigned 
his Senate seat, and with it his position as Senate majority leader. (He soon 
regretted having to give up this powerful position because as Vice President 
he was almost totally sidelined by President Kennedy!)
Functions
Strictly speaking, the Legislative branch should legislate, the Executive branch 
should “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,” and the Judicial 
branch should interpret and enforce the law through the courts — and each 
branch should stay away from the functions of the other two branches. But 
there are two problems with this theory:

95
 Chapter 8: Separation of Powers: To Each His Own 
 
✓ In practice, overlap between the functions of the three branches can’t be 
entirely avoided — and in some important situations, overlap is quite 
deliberate.
 
✓ If each of the three branches kept religiously to its own specific func-
tions and didn’t stray into the preserve of the other branches, the 
branches couldn’t act as checks and balances on one another.
I discuss the first problem here and the second in the next section, “Checking 
and Balancing.”
Some of the overlap between the three branches of government is the result 
of a genuine desire of one branch to help out another. For example, after 
Congress has passed a law, the Executive branch must enforce it. Sometimes, 
enforcing a law may involve making additional rules. But this practice has 
come under attack. A Supreme Court ruling in 1825 established what’s 
called the non-delegation doctrine. Chief Justice John Marshall in Wayman v. 
Southard held that “important” matters can’t be delegated, but Congress may 
delegate the power to one of the other branches of government “to fill up the 
details.” For example, Congress delegates to executive agencies, such as the 
Food and Drug Administration and the Internal Revenue Service, the power to 
make detailed regulations in the areas that they cover.
The U.S. Supreme Court has given its blessing to Congress’s delegation of 
power to other government bodies. Here’s the test that the court applies in 
deciding whether a particular delegation is kosher or not:
Congress simply cannot do its job absent an ability to delegate power 
under broad general directives. Accordingly, this Court has deemed it 
“constitutionally sufficient if Congress clearly delineates the general policy, 
the public agency which is to apply it, and the boundaries of this delegated 
authority.”
The Supreme Court has only rarely struck down Acts of Congress delegating 
power to the other branches of government. An exception to this trend was 
the 1998 case Clinton v. City of New York, in which the Supreme Court struck 
down the Line Item Veto Act of 1996, which allowed the President unilaterally 
to delete individual items of expenditure approved by Congress. The idea 
behind the act was to allow the President to cut pork barrel spending — 
government spending that benefits a particular region rather than the nation 
as a whole. Most state governors have long had this power. President Ronald 
Reagan asked for a line item veto in his State of the Union address in 1986, 
saying, “Give me the authority to veto waste, and I’ll take the responsibility, 
I’ll make the cuts, I’ll take the heat.”
Surprisingly, perhaps, the Line Item Veto Act of 1996 originated not with the 
Democratic President but with his Republican opponents, who had just won 
control of both houses of Congress in the 1994 midterm elections. President 
Bill Clinton then also eagerly embraced the idea of a line item veto. So, what 

96
Part II: We the People: How the United States Is Governed 
was wrong with the act? In a nutshell, the objection to the line item veto is 
that it allows the President to legislate, contrary to the principle of the sepa-
ration of powers.
Muscling in on the other branches of government
Since the United States was founded, the three 
branches of government have jockeyed for 
position, with each trying to get one over on the 
other branches. Here are a few examples:
 ✓ Legislative courts: From an early date, 
Congress tried to break the courts’ lock on 
litigation by setting up its own courts for 
certain purposes. The U.S. Supreme Court 
hit back by narrowly restricting the scope 
of the power of these legislative courts. 
In Murray’s Lessee v. Hoboken Land & 
Improvement Co., decided in 1856, the court 
ruled that a legislative court couldn’t hear 
“a suit at the common law, or in equity, or 
admiralty” — in other words, any regular 
lawsuit. This left only “public rights” deter-
minations to the legislative courts — cases 
between a citizen and the government.
 ✓ The Supreme Court strikes back: In a 
1982 case called Northern Pipeline Co. 
v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., a plurality of 
the Supreme Court struck down an Act of 
Congress that had set up bankruptcy courts 
with wide jurisdiction. The main objection 
to these bankruptcy courts was that they 
posed a “serious threat that the exercise 
of the judicial power would be subject to 
incursion by other branches.” Not that the 
Supreme Court had ever heard many bank-
ruptcy cases!
 ✓ Jurisdiction stripping: Article III, Section 2 of 
the Constitution says, “[T]he supreme Court 
shall have appellate Jurisdiction . . . with 
such Exceptions . . . as the Congress shall 
make.” Justice Felix Frankfurter commented, 
“Congress need not give this Court any 
appellate power: it may withdraw appel-
late jurisdiction once conferred.” Was 
Frankfurter right? Absolutely. The Illegal 
Immigration Reform and Immigrant 
Responsibility Act of 1996 provides a good 
example of Congress’s exercise of the 
power to restrict the power of the courts. 
Under this act, if the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service (INS) refuses to 
grant a particular person asylum, no fed-
eral court — including the high court — is 
permitted to review that decision.
 ✓ Guantanamo Bay: Could Congress exclude 
the jurisdiction of the courts in regard to 
detention in Guantanamo Bay? The Military 
Commissions Act (MCA) of 2006 did just 
that. The MCA established special “mili-
tary commissions” to try “alien unlawful 
enemy combatants engaged in hostilities 
against the United States.” In the 2008 case 
Boumediene v. Bush, the U.S. Supreme 
Court ruled 5 to 4 that the MCA was uncon-
stitutional and that foreign detainees held 
in Guantanamo Bay did have the right to 
challenge their detention in the ordinary 
U.S. courts. Justice Antonin Scalia, in his 
dissenting opinion, held that the majority’s 
“analysis produces a crazy result.”
It’s important to distinguish these examples 
of competition among the different branches 
of government from the checks and balances 
between them that the Framers deliberately 
inserted into the Constitution in order to prevent 
concentration of power in too few hands.

97
 Chapter 8: Separation of Powers: To Each His Own 
Checking and Balancing
Here’s what James Madison said in the Federalist Papers in support of separa-
tion of powers:
The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in 
the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, 
selfappointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of 
tyranny.
Madison and the other Framers considered separation of powers essential 
in order to avoid “tyranny.” But the Constitution went much further than 
the mere separation of powers — it also established an elaborate system of 
checks and balances.
 
The concept of checks and balances is in one sense a natural extension of 
separation of powers, but in another sense the two concepts — separation of 
powers and checks and balances — are actually in opposition to each other.
On its own, separation of powers should just mean that each branch of 
government would go its own merry way without interference from any 
other branch. But this arrangement isn’t practical, because the boundaries 
between the three branches of government aren’t clear-cut. Plus, the Framers 
deliberately introduced overlaps between the functions of the three branches 
so that they could act as checks and balances on one another.
Keeping each branch in line
Here are the most important checks and balances built into the Constitution. 
I look first at checks on Congress, then at checks on the President, and lastly 
at checks on the judiciary. Here are the checks on Congress:
 
✓ The President’s veto power: Under Article I, Section 7 of the 
Constitution, the President has the power to veto — or block — any bill 
passed by both houses of Congress. This is a really powerful tool against 
the legislature in the hands of the executive. A presidential veto can 
be overridden by Congress, but only by a two-thirds majority in both 
houses, which is notoriously difficult to achieve.
 
✓ The Veep: The Vice President is a member of the executive branch of 
government, and he is also President of the Senate by virtue of Article I, 
Section 3 of the Constitution. But, although he has the right to preside 
over the Senate, the Vice President is not a member of that legislative 
body, cannot participate in debates there, and cannot vote except to 

98
Part II: We the People: How the United States Is Governed 
break a tie. So, his potential to keep the Senate in check is very limited — 
especially since most Veeps don’t spend a lot of time presiding over the 
Senate. They tend to leave that to the president pro tem of the Senate, the 
senior senator of the day.
 
✓ Judicial review: The most serious check on Congressional power 
doesn’t appear in the text of the Constitution at all but was read into 
it by Chief Justice John Marshall in the famous 1803 case of Marbury v. 
Madison, which I discuss in Chapter 23. Marshall’s highly controversial 
ruling is still accepted today. It gives the Supreme Court the power to 
strike down any law passed by Congress or any of the state legislatures 
if the court finds that law unconstitutional. I discuss the effect of this 
ruling later in this chapter and also in Chapter 12.
Now for the main checks on the President:
 
✓ Impeachment: Impeachment is the best-known check on the President 
because it can result in his or her removal from office. But impeach-
ment has been used only twice — against Andrew Johnson in 1869, and 
against Bill Clinton in 1999. Neither Johnson nor Clinton was removed 
from office, but Richard Nixon’s resignation in 1974 was in reaction to a 
serious threat of impeachment.
 
 In impeachment proceedings, the House of Representatives prosecutes 
and the Senate sits as a jury and decides the case. A two-thirds major-
ity is needed for a conviction. The Chief Justice presides over the trial, 
which represents a further check on both the President and the Congress 
on the part of the judiciary. I discuss impeachment in Chapter 13.
 
✓ “Advice and Consent”: Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution gives 
the President the “Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the 
Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present 
concur.” This provision seriously cramps the President’s style in foreign 
policy matters. Similarly, the President’s power to appoint ambassadors, 
Supreme Court justices, and other federal officials is exercised “by and 
with the Advice and Consent of the Senate” — which translates in prac-
tice into sometimes quite lengthy and acrimonious confirmation hear-
ings. I deal with the presidency in Chapter 10.
 
✓ Commander in Chief: Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution makes the 
President Commander in Chief of the armed forces. But under Article I, 
Section 8, Congress has the power “to declare War.” The precise rela-
tionship between the President and Congress in regard to war remains 
the subject of intense debate. I discuss this issue in Chapters 10 and 11.
 
✓ Choosing the President: If no candidate running for President obtains 
a majority (more than 50 percent) of the electoral votes, the Twelfth 
Amendment provides that “the House of Representatives shall choose 

99
 Chapter 8: Separation of Powers: To Each His Own 
immediately, by ballot, the President” — with each state having one 
vote. This provision has been used twice. The Senate has the same 
power in regard to choosing the Vice President.
 
✓ Judicial review: The Supreme Court has a similar power in regard to 
decisions of the President and other members of the executive branch 
as it has in regard to Congress. The court can set aside an execu-
tive decision as unconstitutional. This derives from the power of the 
Supreme Court to interpret the Constitution — a right that doesn’t figure 
in the text of the Constitution, but which derives from Chief Justice John 
Marshall’s ruling in Marbury v. Madison, which I discuss in Chapter 23.
What about checks on the judiciary by the other two branches? There are 
remarkably few:
 
✓ Impeachment: The main check on the judiciary is impeachment. Many 
more judges have been impeached than presidents. Only one of these 
judges was a Supreme Court justice, and he was acquitted. But no fewer 
than 13 other federal judges have been impeached, seven of them being 
removed from the bench and a couple others choosing to resign. As with 
presidents, the threat of impeachment can be as effective as a successful 
impeachment conviction. Justice Abe Fortas — nominated by President 
Lyndon Johnson to become Chief Justice — is reliably thought to have 
resigned rather than face impeachment. As with presidential impeach-
ments, the House of Representatives prosecutes and the Senate tries the 
case. But the Vice President presides — not the Chief Justice as in the 
impeachment of a President.
 
✓ Appointment: Supreme Court justices and other federal judges are 
appointed by the President subject to confirmation by the Senate. But 
Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution allows them to “hold their Offices 
during good Behaviour” — in other words, for life, subject only to 
removal by impeachment.
 
✓ Pardons: Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution gives the President the 
“Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United 
States, except in Cases of Impeachment.” Is this power a check on the 
judiciary? Yes, in a sense, because a pardon cancels the sentence with-
out cancelling the conviction.
Considering the judiciary’s special position
The judiciary has fewer checks on its power than either of the other two 
branches of government because, once appointed, a federal judge is there for 
life unless he really steps out of line sufficiently to be impeached.

100
Part II: We the People: How the United States Is Governed 
 
The judiciary also exercises more control over the other two branches than 
those branches have over the judiciary. Judicial review is the killer weapon in 
the hands of the U.S. Supreme Court, which can use it against the President as 
well as against Congress, and also against the states.
Interestingly enough, this nuclear weapon doesn’t figure anywhere in the text 
of the Constitution. The Supreme Court arrogated this power to itself back 
in 1803 in the case of Marbury v. Madison, and it has clung to this power ever 
since. That ruling is doubly worrying in regard to the doctrine of the separa-
tion of powers, for two reasons:
 
✓ It gave the judiciary the exclusive right to interpret the Constitution, a 
power that the Constitution itself doesn’t confer on them. Such was the 
skill of Chief Justice John Marshall that his “twistifications of the law” 
(Thomas Jefferson’s term) have become accepted as valid constitutional 
law. Jefferson’s own take was quite different:
 
 My construction of the Constitution is . . . that each department [or branch 
of government] is truly independent of the others and has an equal right to 
decide for itself what is the meaning of the Constitution in the cases submit-
ted to its action; and especially where it is to act ultimately and without 
appeal.
 
✓ It gave the judiciary the power to add to its own power simply by means 
of a high court decision — which is also nowhere to be found in the 
Constitution, and is in any case contrary to the whole principle of the 
separation of powers.
Above all, the effect of Marbury v. Madison is to give a group of unelected 
justices the power to strike down as unconstitutional any laws passed by a 
democratically elected Congress. Here’s Jefferson’s take on that ruling:
The Constitution . . . meant that its coordinate branches should be checks 
on each other. But the opinion which gives to the judges the right to decide 
what laws are constitutional and what not, not only for themselves in their 
own sphere of action but for the Legislature and Executive also in their 
spheres, would make the Judiciary a despotic branch.
Right away in 1804, Jefferson recognized the danger of runaway power in the 
hands of the Supreme Court. He was President at the time yet was power-
less to stop that development — even though it was not sanctioned by the 
Constitution. And none of his successors has been able to stop the inexora-
ble growth of judicial power either. For more on this subject, see Chapter 12.

C
ongress is the legislative branch of the federal government — the 
branch that makes laws. But Congress can’t pass just any laws it likes. 
Its lawmaking powers are limited by the Constitution as part of the delicate 
balancing act that the Constitution performs between the federal government 
and the states.
Article I, Section 8, of the Constitution lists the powers of Congress. It’s a 
pretty long list — but don’t worry, I’m not going to bore you with it here. 
(You can turn to the Appendix if you’re dying with curiosity.)
Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 — known as the Commerce Clause — contains 
probably the most important of these listed powers. Here is what the 
Commerce Clause says:
The Congress shall have Power . . . To regulate Commerce with foreign 
Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.
As usual, there’s more to these few words than meets the eye.
How the Commerce Clause Was Born
The Commerce Clause owes its existence to the economic conflicts between 
the states during the period under the Articles of Confederation, which were 
in force from 1781 until the ratification of the U.S. Constitution in 1788.

102
Part II: We the People: How the United States Is Governed 
Under the Articles of Confederation, the national government was extremely 
weak and had no power to regulate the economy. The states were essen-
tially independent of one another. In 1787 James Madison wrote to George 
Washington in exasperation at the way the states continued “to harass each 
other with rival and spiteful measures dictated by mistaken views of inter-
est.” Examples of this problem were the taxes imposed by New York and 
Pennsylvania on imports from abroad destined for landlocked New Jersey.
Madison — often called the “Father of the Constitution” — recognized that 
the only way to put an end to this economic conflict among the states was by 
establishing a stronger national government. This was the main objective of 
the Philadelphia Convention that crafted the U.S. Constitution.
In the same letter to Washington, Madison wrote that “the national 
Government should be armed with positive and compleat authority in all 
cases which require uniformity; such as the regulation of trade, including the 
right of taxing both exports & imports.”
But how far does the Commerce Clause reflect Madison’s view on this impor-
tant subject? The poor little guy (he was only 5 foot 3 3/4 inches tall) was often 
thwarted in the Constitutional Convention.
Interpreting the Commerce Clause
The courts have pored over practically every word in the Commerce Clause. 
Here are some of the issues associated with the definitions of certain words 
and phrases:
 
✓ Power: The question here is whether the Commerce Clause gives Congress 
exclusive power to regulate commerce — particularly over interstate 
commerce — or whether the states have a concurrent power (a power 
running parallel to that of Congress). I discuss this tricky question in the 
next section.
 
✓ Commerce: Two hundred years ago, commerce referred primarily to the 
buying and selling of goods and commodities. But, in the leading case of 
Gibbons v. Ogden, decided in 1824, Chief Justice John Marshall held that 
it also included navigation. Since then, the term commerce has been nar-
rowed and widened at different times, according to the changing views 
of the Supreme Court justices.
 
✓ Regulate: To regulate was defined by Marshall as meaning “to prescribe 
the rule by which commerce is to be governed.”
 
✓ “Commerce with foreign Nations”: It is not at all surprising that 
Congress was given the power to regulate foreign trade, because foreign 
affairs generally were the concern of the national government and not of 
the states.

103
 Chapter 9: Doing Business: The Commerce Clause 
 
✓ “among the several States”: As Marshall put it, this phrase “may very 
properly be restricted to that commerce which concerns more states 
than one” — now generally called interstate commerce. The definition 
of this term has fluctuated in accordance with the views of the justices 
of the Supreme Court over time. The ruling definition of interstate com-
merce is now very broad, covering the movement of pretty much any 
goods or services — or even people — across state lines.
 
✓ “with the Indian Tribes”: Native Americans were recognized from the 
foundation of the Republic as being separate from the United States. 
However, in an 1831 case the Supreme Court decided that the Cherokee 
nation was not an independent state but a “denominated domestic 
dependent nation.” By referring to Native Americans separately from for-
eign nations, the Commerce Clause supports this high court view.
Hunting Down the Dormant 
Commerce Clause
The Commerce Clause gives Congress the power “to regulate Commerce.” Does 
this mean that Congress has exclusive power to regulate commerce, or does it 
mean that the states have concurrent power with Congress in this area — power 
running parallel to that of Congress?
Neither of these interpretations is entirely satisfactory. Let’s take a look at 
each of them in turn.
Assuming Congress has exclusive power
I first examine the view that the Commerce Clause gives Congress exclusive 
power. If Congress has exclusive power over this vast area, then these con-
clusions must follow:
 
✓ The states can’t regulate interstate commerce at all — even on matters 
that Congress hasn’t legislated about. Adherents of the Dormant Commerce 
Clause theory take this line. The theory can be traced back to a remark 
made by Chief Justice John Marshall in a case decided in 1829, but it really 
came into its own in the second half of the 20th century. The idea behind 
this misnamed theory is that, even when Congress hasn’t legislated on 
a particular aspect of interstate commerce, its power is only sleeping — 
so the states aren’t allowed to make laws affecting this aspect anyway.
 
✓ Any attempt by a state to regulate interstate commerce in any way 
must be struck down as unconstitutional. On this basis, in 1997 the U.S. 
Supreme Court struck down a Maine statute that imposed tax penalties on 

104
Part II: We the People: How the United States Is Governed 
organizations catering mainly to out-of state customers. A summer camp 
run by the Christian Science Church had to pay more than $20,000 per 
year in local property taxes just because it catered mainly to out-of-state 
campers. Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the majority, held that the 
state law infringed on the Dormant Commerce Clause and was therefore 
unconstitutional. Despite the wide definition of the Commerce Clause that 
the majority on the court applied in this case, the outcome was probably 
fair. This was an important decision, affecting many charitable organiza-
tions across the nation.
 
✓ The interests of the Federal government predominate over those of the 
states. The Supreme Court justices who support the Dormant Commerce 
Clause tend to favor federal power over state power.
Giving concurrent powers to the states
The Dormant Commerce Clause theory is a bit like a flying saucer. Those who 
believe in it are passionate in its support, while skeptics are dismissive of the 
whole idea.
Having examined the implications of a valid Dormant Commerce Clause, let’s 
turn to the alternative theory: that the states retain a concurrent commerce 
power, which is subject to the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution. The 
Supremacy Clause, which I discuss in Chapter 7, subordinates all state laws 
to the U.S. Constitution and all federal laws “made in Pursuance thereof.”
Here’s a hypothetical example of how the concurrent commerce power 
theory works in practice:
 
✓ Texas makes a law stipulating that out-of-state cowboy boots sold in 
that state must be colored pink with purple spots.
 
✓ This law clearly concerns interstate commerce, so Congress has the 
power to regulate this trade.
 
✓ But Congress hasn’t passed any laws about cowboy boots.
 
✓ So the Texas law is valid — until or unless Congress decides to pass a 
law prohibiting discrimination against out-of-state cowboy boots.
 
✓ Any such Congressional legislation automatically makes the Texas law 
unconstitutional.
This scenario is hardly more satisfactory than the one based on the Dormant 
Commerce Clause theory because it means that state laws concerned with 
interstate commerce are always teetering on the brink of unconstitutionality.
So, which theory is right?

105
 Chapter 9: Doing Business: The Commerce Clause 
Poking holes in the Dormant 
Commerce Clause
Is the Dormant Commerce Clause actually part of the Constitution at all? It 
sure doesn’t appear in the text of the Constitution. It’s a judge-made inter-
pretation of the Commerce Clause — but one that now has an apparently 
respectable pedigree simply because so many Supreme Court justices have 
accepted it over the years.
 
In my view, the arguments against the Dormant Commerce Clause theory are 
far stronger than this vague aura of respectability. Here are some of the argu-
ments against this theory:
 
✓ Article I, Section 10, of the Constitution lists a lot of things that the states 
are not permitted to do. Among these prohibitions on the states is the 
right to “lay any Imposts or Duties on Imports or Exports” except with 
the consent of Congress. Import and export duties are of course con-
nected with commerce, but they are only one small part of commerce 
and are concerned solely with foreign trade. What about the exercise by 
the states of other powers involving the regulation of commerce? These 
are not prohibited in the Constitution. So we can only conclude that 
these other powers may be exercised by the states — unless Congress 
decides to step in.
 
✓ During the period of the Articles of Confederation, from 1781 to 1788, the 
weak central government had no commerce power at all; the states had 
complete power to regulate all aspects of commerce. If the U.S. Constitution 
intended to take this major power away from the states and hand it exclu-
sively to Congress, it would have had to spell out that change really care-
fully. But there is no sign of this change in the wording of the Constitution.
 
✓ Chief Justice John Marshall did use the term dormant in reference to the 
Commerce Clause a couple of times, but it’s a mistake to think that he was 
thinking of anything like the Dormant Commerce Clause theory. Marshall 
made his view on the subject crystal clear in Gibbons v. Ogden in 1824, 
when he said, “It is perfectly settled, that an affirmative grant of power 
to the United States does not, of itself, devest the States of a like power.” 
In other words, just because the Constitution gives Congress a particular 
power doesn’t strip the states of a similar power. The states therefore 
enjoy a concurrent power with Congress to regulate interstate commerce.
 
✓ Marshall reasserted his position on the Dormant Commerce Clause 
theory in the case of Willson v. Blackbird Creek Marsh Co., decided in 
1829. A company was authorized by a Delaware state law to build a dam, 
which blocked the passage of a ship licensed under federal law. Was the 
building of the dam a violation of the Commerce Clause? The Supreme 
Court, speaking through Chief Justice Marshall, said no — simply 
because Congress had not “passed any act which bore upon the case.”

106
Part II: We the People: How the United States Is Governed 
Tracing the Changing Meaning 
of the Commerce Clause
The commerce power is one of the most important powers that the 
Constitution entrusts to Congress. So, Supreme Court justices favoring the 
federal government have tended to adopt a broad interpretation of the 
clause, while justices favoring states’ rights have generally taken a narrow 
view of the clause.
In 1824, there was debate about whether even a commercial activity like 
navigation fell within the commerce power. But within half a century the high 
court had greatly widened its interpretation of the Commerce Clause. In 1877, 
Chief Justice Morrison Waite ruled that, as the power to regulate commerce 
was “intrusted to the general government for the good of the nation, it is not 
only the right, but the duty, of Congress to see to it that intercourse among 
the States and the transmission of intelligence are not obstructed or unneces-
sarily encumbered by State legislation.”
Protecting freedom of contract
The next phase in the life of the Commerce Clause was a restrictive interpre-
tation by the high court of government power — state as well as federal — to 
regulate commerce.
 
The period between 1905 and 1937 is often termed the Lochner era, named for 
the controversial Supreme Court decision striking down a New York labor law 
that limited the number of permissible hours of work in bakeries. The majority 
on the court held that the state law violated the freedom of contract of employ-
ers and employees alike. They also ruled that freedom of contract was an inte-
gral part of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth 
Amendment. So, by infringing on this right, the New York law was unconstitu-
tional. (I discuss the Due Process Clause and the Lochner case in more detail 
in Chapter 17.)
The Lochner decision itself was not based on the Commerce Clause. But the 
principle of freedom of contract soon became a useful weapon against the 
commerce power of Congress.

107
 Chapter 9: Doing Business: The Commerce Clause 
Introducing the Four Horsemen 
and the Three Musketeers
The stage was set for a major battle in the Supreme Court between the sup-
porters of federal regulation of the economy and the champions of freedom 
of contract.
The doctrine of freedom of contract was still dominant when Franklin Delano 
Roosevelt (FDR) was elected President in 1932. FDR’s New Deal took the 
form of a series of radical programs embodied in congressional legislation. 
Four justices on the Supreme Court — nicknamed the Four Horsemen (of the 
Apocalypse) — were staunch conservatives who fought the New Deal tooth 
and nail. Luckily for the Horsemen, they found an ally in Justice Owen Roberts, 
who often provided the swing vote giving the Horsemen a majority on the 
court. The liberal wing of the court — nicknamed the Three Musketeers — was 
no match for the Horsemen when they had Roberts in tow.
Between 1935 and 1937 the conservative majority struck down one after 
another of the New Deal programs as unconstitutional.
Finding that mining and manufacture are not commerce
Carter v. Carter Coal Co. is a typical example of the approach adopted by the 
Four Horsemen. The case was about the so-called Guffey Coal Act of 1935, 
which regulated prices, wages, and “fair practices” in the coal industry. The 
question before the court was whether this federal law was constitutional or 
not. The Four Horsemen had Justice Owen Roberts in harness and declared 
the law unconstitutional.
Here is a summary of the arguments that the Horsemen used to reach this 
conclusion. I have added my comments in italic.
 
✓ The federal government “can claim no powers which are not granted to it 
by the Constitution, and the powers actually granted must be such as are 
expressly given or given by necessary implication.” This “cardinal rule” is 
not in dispute. It is quoted from an important 1816 high court decision.
 
✓ The Commerce Clause of the Constitution gives Congress the power to 
regulate commerce. No problem with this either!
 
✓ But manufacture is not the same thing as commerce. Commerce means 
“intercourse for the purpose of trade.” However, “Mining is not inter-
state commerce, but like manufacturing, is a local business subject to 
local regulation and taxation.” Yeah? But, as Justice Benjamin Cardozo 

108
Part II: We the People: How the United States Is Governed 
said in his dissent: “Mining and agriculture and manufacture are not 
interstate commerce considered by themselves, yet their relation to that 
commerce may be such that, for the protection of the one, there is need to 
regulate the other.” The Horsemen’s narrow view of the commerce power 
inevitably led to the desired conclusion. No surprises here. Check the next 
bullet.
 
✓ So the Guffey Act is unconstitutional. Whew! That wasn’t too difficult, 
now, was it?
Showing how a switch in time saved nine
FDR was sick of the way the Four Horsemen thwarted him repeatedly in the 
court by, as he put it, “reading into the Constitution words and implications 
which are not there, and which were never intended to be there.”
Not a single vacancy on the Supreme Court bench opened up during FDR’s 
first term, so the President wasn’t able to name any new justices. But, bol-
stered by two landslide victories and an overwhelming majority in both 
houses of Congress, FDR decided to play the Horsemen at their own game — 
the game of constitutional interpretation.
 
Article III of the Constitution establishes a Supreme Court, but nowhere 
does the Constitution say how many members that court should consist of. 
Roosevelt therefore proposed a law giving the President the power to appoint 
an additional Supreme Court justice for every sitting member of the court who 
had reached the age of 70
1⁄2. This measure would immediately have allowed 
FDR to appoint six more justices, which would have given him indirect con-
trol over the court — something that even some of his staunchest supporters 
opposed as an abuse of presidential authority.
In the end, Roosevelt didn’t need his court-packing scheme in order to get 
the Supreme Court on his side. The threat of it was enough. The turning point 
came when Justice Owen Roberts switched sides — the famous “switch in 
time that saved nine” (justices) in West Coast Hotel v. Parrish, decided in 1937, 
which I discuss in Chapter 23. (There is still some doubt whether Roosevelt’s 
plan really was the reason for Roberts’s sudden switch, because it appears 
that Roberts had written his opinion before the President even announced 
his proposal.)
West Coast Hotel v. Parrish signaled the end of the Lochner “freedom of con-
tract” era. With a pro-New Deal majority on the court, it was inevitable that 
federal power under the Commerce Clause would grow exponentially.
Signaling the feds’ control of the economy
The first sign of this growth in federal power came in National Labor Relations 
Board (NLRB) v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation, decided in 1937. The 

109
 Chapter 9: Doing Business: The Commerce Clause 
NLRB, set up under a New Deal law, found Jones & Laughlin guilty of discrimi-
nating against employees of theirs who wanted to join a labor union. The 
NLRB ordered the corporation to rehire ten employees whom it had fired 
and to give them back pay. The corporation refused to comply with the NLRB 
ruling on the ground that the act setting up the NLRB was unconstitutional 
under the Commerce Clause.
The high court ruled in favor of the NLRB, holding that the Commerce Clause 
gave Congress the power to regulate labor relations. The court cast to the 
four winds the previous restrictive interpretation of the Commerce Clause.
But this decision was by no means the most extreme manifestation of the 
control over the economy that the federal government had now obtained. 
That honor probably goes to a 1942 case about a small farmer and his small 
allotment: Wickard v. Filburn.
Controlling the production of wheat 
that never left its home farm
The Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 — part of FDR’s vast New Deal 
program — restricted the area that farmers could use for growing wheat. The 
idea was to keep wheat prices stable by controlling production.
Roscoe Filburn was a small farmer in Ohio. He produced 239 bushels more 
wheat than his federal quota allowed him. So he was hit with a penalty 
amounting to 57 percent of the market value of his excess production.
Roscoe pointed out that he didn’t sell any of his excess wheat production. 
Not only did none of his wheat crop enter interstate commerce, but also none 
of it ever left his farm. All his wheat was consumed right there by himself, 
his family, his poultry, and his livestock. Roscoe figured that this explanation 
gave him an ironclad case against the feds — but he hadn’t reckoned on the 
new pro-government approach of the Supreme Court.
The question before the high court in the case of Wickard v. Filburn was quite 
simple: Was the law setting production quotas in keeping with the Commerce 
Clause — even when the wheat crop in question never left the state where it 
was grown?
Amazingly, the high court ruled unanimously in favor of the federal legisla-
tion. It held that if Filburn had not grown and consumed his excess wheat, 
he would have had to buy it from someone else — which is commerce. In the 
words of Justice Robert H. Jackson, writing for the court, “Even if [Filburn’s] 
activity be local, and though it may not be regarded as commerce, it may 
still, whatever its nature, be reached by Congress if it exerts a substantial 
economic effect on interstate commerce.”

110
Part II: We the People: How the United States Is Governed 
 
Justice Jackson was not noted as a comedian, but was this a joke? Did he 
really say “though it may not be regarded as commerce”? Yep, he sure did. So, 
that must mean that even something that’s not commerce at all — let alone 
interstate commerce — can still be regulated by the feds under the Commerce 
Clause! But that’s not all he said. How about the phrase “if it exerts a substan-
tial economic effect on interstate commerce”? Seriously, how could 239 bushels 
of wheat exert a substantial effect on anything?
Using the Commerce Clause 
to advance civil rights
The high court’s decision in Filburn’s case was a signal that allowed the feds 
to muscle in on pretty much any economic activity. Not surprisingly, the feds 
took the opportunity to use their economic power to further their political 
program — including, above all, civil rights. Federal legislation outlawed seg-
regation, and the Supreme Court under Chief Justice Earl Warren was quick 
to support this legislation in any way it could, including using the Commerce 
Clause. One leading example of this kind occurred in a case involving an 
Atlanta motel.
The Heart of Atlanta Motel in Atlanta, Georgia, offered accommodation only 
to white people. This policy was directly contrary to federal law. The Civil 
Rights Act of 1964 specifically outlawed racial discrimination “in any place of 
public accommodation” if its operations “affect commerce.”
The owner of the motel filed suit in federal court arguing that, in passing 
this provision, Congress exceeded its powers under the Commerce Clause. 
A unanimous Supreme Court ruled that the ban on racial discrimination 
in public accommodations was well within Congress’s powers under the 
Commerce Clause. The court also noted that three-fourths of the motel’s 
guests came from outside Georgia, so the business clearly affected interstate 
commerce.
Turning back the federal tide?
The Heart of Atlanta case was no isolated example. The Commerce Clause 
was a convenient tool in the hands of the Supreme Court to bring the states 
to heel. But the court itself was beginning to change, most notably after the 
appointment of William Rehnquist as Chief Justice in 1986. Rehnquist was a 
conservative who tended generally to favor states’ rights in what came to be 
called “the new federalism.”

111
 Chapter 9: Doing Business: The Commerce Clause 
In United States v. Lopez, decided in 1995, the Supreme Court at last struck 
down a federal law on the ground that it went beyond the permissible limits 
of the Commerce Clause. This was the first high court decision since 1937 to 
restrict congressional authority to legislate under the Commerce Clause.
The legislation in question, the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, made it 
“unlawful for any individual knowingly to possess a firearm at a place that the 
individual knows, or has reasonable cause to know, is a school zone.”
Alfonso Lopez, a twelfth-grader, walked into his high school in San Antonio, 
Texas, carrying a concealed .38-caliber handgun and five bullets. He was con-
victed under the 1990 federal law and was sentenced to six months in prison.
On appeal, Lopez claimed that the provision under which he had been con-
victed was unconstitutional because it exceeded Congress’s power to legis-
late under the Commerce Clause.
The high court agreed with him. Chief Justice William Rehnquist, writing for 
the majority, held that the relevant section of the 1990 law “is a criminal stat-
ute that by its terms has nothing to do with ‘commerce’ or any sort of eco-
nomic enterprise, however broadly one might define those terms.”
This decision is undoubtedly right — although the idea of keeping guns away 
from schools is not a bad one. Mass school killings have been all too frequent 
in recent years.
Lopez was first charged under a Texas law. It’s not clear why those charges 
were dropped in favor of federal charges. If Congress had not mistakenly 
assumed that it had the power to legislate gun control, Lopez would probably 
have been duly convicted and sentenced under a perfectly valid state law.
“Appropriating state police powers under 
the guise of regulating commerce”
United States v. Morrison, decided in 2000, was another case in which the 
high court struck down part of a well-intentioned federal statute. The law 
in question was the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), and the relevant 
provision allowed female victims of gender-based violence to file civil suits in 
federal court.
Here are some of the arguments used by the majority on the court, speaking 
through Chief Justice Rehnquist:

112
Part II: We the People: How the United States Is Governed 
 
✓ Violent crime has only a minimal effect on interstate commerce.
 
✓ “No civilized system of justice” could fail to provide a remedy for inde-
cent assault or rape, but under our federal system that remedy must be 
provided by the states and not by federal law.
 
✓ The scope of the commerce power must not “embrace effects upon 
interstate commerce so indirect and remote that to embrace them . . . 
would effectually obliterate the distinction between what is national and 
what is local and create a completely centralized government.” (Here, 
Rehnquist is pointing back to the NLRB New Deal case that I discuss ear-
lier in the chapter.)
 
✓ The economic effects of crimes against women are indirect and don’t 
therefore fall under the commerce power — even if a whole lot of 
incidents are “aggregated” together. (This “aggregation principle” sup-
posedly comes from Wickard v Filburn, but it’s not actually mentioned 
there.)
Justice Clarence Thomas, concurring with Rehnquist, charged Congress in 
the VAWA with “appropriating state police powers under the guise of regulat-
ing commerce.” This statement puts the majority decision in a nutshell.
 
It’s important to note that the high court did not invalidate the whole of VAWA 
but only the part allowing a civil remedy in federal court. The rest of VAWA — 
mainly providing funding for the investigation and prosecution of sexual vio-
lence in the criminal courts — is still alive and well. It was reauthorized by 
Congress in 2005 and signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2006 — 
with the addition of relief for male victims of domestic violence and indecent 
assault.
Taking a step backward
 
After the successful check on the feds in United States v. Morrison, we find 
ourselves back in 1942. In Gonzales v. Raich, decided in 2005, the high court 
upheld a federal law banning the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes — 
although a California state law allowed such use. Angel Raich, who brought 
the case, used only in-state marijuana. In the words of Justice Clarence 
Thomas, dissenting, Raich’s “local cultivation and consumption of marijuana 
is not ‘Commerce . . . among the several states’.” The result of this sad case 
was the same as that in the remarkably similar case of Wickard v. Filburn — 
victory for the feds over the little person, over the states, and over the correct 
interpretation of the Commerce Clause.

W
ant to know what the different branches of the 
federal government can and can’t do? It’s all here, 
starting with the President, then moving on to Congress 
and the judiciary. If you’re not satisfied with their 
performance, you may want to fire them. Chapter 13 
tells you how to impeach the President and the judges. 
(Members of Congress can only be voted out.)

T
he President of the United States is commonly described as the most 
powerful person in the world. So it’s pretty important to understand how 
the President is chosen and exactly what powers and responsibilities the 
President has under the Constitution. That’s what this chapter is all about.
Being “Eligible to the 
Office of President”
Thinking about running for president? Want to know if you qualify? Article II, 
Section 1 of the Constitution lays down the requirements for eligibility:
No person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, 
at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office 
of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall 
not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a 
Resident within the United States.

116
Part III: Balancing the Branches of Government 
In other words, to be eligible for the office of President, you have to be
 
✓ “[A] natural born” U.S. citizen — but see the discussion that follows.
 
✓ At least 35 years old.
 
✓ A U.S. resident for at least 14 years.
Do you really need to have been born a citizen of the United States in order 
to become President? A close reading of the quoted section shows that you 
don’t — provided you became a U.S. citizen by June 21, 1788. The only snag 
is that you’d have to be more than 220 years old to qualify under that rule!
Does the term “natural born Citizen” mean that you have to be born in a state 
of the United States? Or is it good enough if you were born in a U.S. territory? 
Barry Goldwater, the Republican presidential nominee in 1964, was born in 
Arizona Territory before it became a state, but his right to run for President 
was never seriously questioned. The same applied to John McCain, who was 
born to U.S. parents (his father was an admiral) at a U.S. military base in the 
Panama Canal Zone, which was a territory of the United States at the time.
 
The phrase “eligible to the Office of President” has been the subject of a lot of 
recent debate. Some people have suggested that a former two-term President 
of the United States could lawfully run for election as Vice President, and then, 
if the President resigned, become President for a third term!
It’s a two-party system
In order to run for President, it helps to be a 
billionaire. It also helps to have been nomi-
nated as the candidate of one of the two major 
political parties, Democratic or Republican. 
Nomination can be achieved only by winning 
enough primary elections — contests within 
one of the major parties — to ensure the sup-
port of a majority of pledged delegates at the 
party convention.
These are not constitutional requirements, but 
in practice it’s almost impossible for a third-
party candidate to be elected President. In 
1912, ex-President Theodore Roosevelt, run-
ning on a Progressive Party (or “Bull Moose”) 
ticket, made a strong showing as a third-party 
candidate. He received 88 electoral votes, far 
superior to incumbent Republican President 
William H. Taft’s 8 electoral votes. But what 
Roosevelt really accomplished was putting 
Democratic nominee Woodrow Wilson into the 
White House (with 435 electoral votes).
More surprisingly, in 1992, Ross Perot, a 62-year-
old billionaire who had never held public office, 
picked up 18.9 percent of the popular vote. 
Although Perot got no electoral votes because 
he didn’t get a majority in any one state, he 
arguably cost incumbent President George 
H.W. Bush the election and put Bill Clinton into 
the White House.

117
 Chapter 10: Looking at the Role of Commander in Chief
This is no abstract discussion. It was motivated by the desire to see Bill 
Clinton back in the White House. The suggestion is preposterous because 
the Twenty-Second Amendment states categorically that “No person shall be 
elected to the office of the President more than twice.” The pro-Clintonites 
argue that this amendment is a prohibition only on being elected President, 
but not on becoming President by some other route, like being elected 
as Veep and then succeeding to the Presidency on the resignation of the 
President. For a discussion on the Twenty-Second Amendment see (appropri-
ately enough) Chapter 22.
“[E]ligible to the Office of President” just means “able to be elected to the 
office of President.” This phrase in Article II, Section 1 dovetails with the 
Twenty-Second Amendment, and also with the Twelfth Amendment, which 
provides that “no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President 
shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States.” In short, if 
you can’t be elected President, you also can’t be elected Vice President. 
Reading the three constitutional texts together, we get this: A former two-
term President can’t be elected to a third term as President, and he also can’t be 
elected as Vice President.
Picking a President
The Constitution goes into great detail on presidential elections — but much 
of what it says on that subject is obsolete or misleading.
The biggest problem in regard to the constitutional rules for presidential elec-
tions is the Framers’ total disregard of the existence of political parties, which 
they scorned as “factions” but which came to play a major role in elections.
Paying the price for passing 
over political parties
Article II, Section 1 of the original, unamended Constitution contains a long 
spiel about presidential elections. The system of presidential elections set 
out there was applied in the elections of 1796 and 1800 — with disastrous 
consequences. In 1796, John Adams emerged as President with his politi-
cal opponent, Thomas Jefferson, as his Vice President! In 1800, the election 
ended up with a contest for the top spot between Jefferson and his intended 
running-mate, Aaron Burr. Luckily, Jefferson won — but only after a lot of 
backstairs intrigue and horse-trading. For more on these early boo-boos, see 
Chapter 20.

118
Part III: Balancing the Branches of Government 
Why did the Framers flunk so badly on the issue of presidential elections? 
The problem was their failure to recognize the importance of political par-
ties. Parties were in an embryonic state when the Constitution in its original 
form was ratified in 1788, so the Framers can’t really be blamed.
Rescuing the situation with 
the Twelfth Amendment
After the fiasco of the 1800 election, reform of the electoral system was 
urgently needed. The Twelfth Amendment, which was ratified just in time 
for the 1804 election, prevented the earlier anomalies from recurring. The 
Twelfth Amendment still didn’t refer to political parties, but it tacitly recog-
nized the role that parties played in the electoral process.
 
The system for electing the President is still governed by Article II, Section 1, 
subject to the Twelfth Amendment — at least in theory. The Framers of the 
Constitution didn’t trust the ordinary people. So the system they set up 
was indirect election of the President by electors, whose title indicates their 
intended function: picking the President. The Twelfth Amendment didn’t 
change this feature.
Examining the modern electoral system
Let’s take a look at how the President gets elected today:
 
✓ How many electors does each state get? Each state chooses electors 
equal in number to the total of the representatives from that state plus 
the two senators from that state. So, for example, at present Florida has 
27 electors because that state has 25 representatives and 2 senators. A 
state with a small population, like Wyoming, may have only one repre-
sentative but, like all states, has two senators. So Wyoming is entitled to 
three electors.
 
✓ Who elects the electors? The Constitution leaves it up to each state 
legislature to decide how the electors for that state are chosen. Today, 
the electors are always directly elected. I discuss this point more in a 
minute.
 
✓ What is the Electoral College? The term Electoral College is commonly 
used to refer to the electors of all the states together. But the phrase 
Electoral College doesn’t figure in the text of the Constitution. And the 

119
 Chapter 10: Looking at the Role of Commander in Chief
Electoral College never meets together as a national body — only as 51 
separate groups of electors (one for each state plus one for Washington, 
D.C., which has three electors).
 
✓ What about the popular vote? The real election — the vote by the 
people — doesn’t rate a mention in the Constitution! The reason for this 
omission is that in the early days the people didn’t get to vote for the 
President at all. The state legislatures would often choose the electors 
themselves, and the electors would then pick the President according to 
their own personal preferences. Democracy triumphed only through the 
rise of the party system, under which the voters in each state were pre-
sented with a slate of electors for each party. Voters picked the slate of 
the political party of their choice. The electors were pledged to support 
the presidential candidate of one or the other particular party. So, in 
choosing, say, the Republican slate, a voter was actually voting for the 
Republican presidential candidate.
 
✓ What is the short ballot? Nowadays, the whole Electoral College system 
is usually short-circuited. Most states use the so-called short ballot, 
which just shows the names of the presidential candidates themselves. 
Anonymous slates of electors still lurk behind the candidates’ names, 
but the voters are given the impression — which is almost invariably 
correct — that they are picking the President directly themselves.
 
✓ What happens when the electors meet? The electors then meet in their 
respective states and formally cast their votes. They vote separately for 
the President and for the Vice President. But the whole of this stage of the 
election is a charade because the electors almost always vote for the can-
didates to whom they have pledged their support. Can an elector step out 
of line and refuse to vote for his pledged candidate? Sure, but it doesn’t 
happen all that often. (In Chapter 20, I discuss the so-called faithless elector.)
 
✓ Who tallies the formal vote count? Each state certifies the number of 
votes cast by its electors for the different candidates. These certificates 
are sent to Washington, D.C. and are opened at a joint sitting of both 
houses of Congress. The electoral votes from all the states are then tal-
lied up, and the official result is formally announced.
 
✓ What happens if a candidate gets a majority? If the presidential candi-
date with the most votes has more than 50 percent of the total number 
of electoral votes cast, that candidate becomes President. The same 
applies to the candidates for Vice President.
 
✓ What happens if no presidential candidate gets a majority? If the top-
scoring presidential candidate doesn’t receive a majority of electoral 
votes, or if two candidates tie, the election is thrown into the House of 
Representatives, which chooses the President from the three top-scoring 
candidates. Here each state has only one vote. To become President, a 

120
Part III: Balancing the Branches of Government 
candidate needs 26 states to vote for him. This procedure has been used 
twice, in 1800 and 1824 — and should probably also have been used in 
2000. This arrangement gives a great advantage to the smaller states. 
For example, it gives Alaska the same say as California, although under 
the normal Electoral College system Alaska has only 3 electoral votes to 
California’s 55.
 
✓ What happens if no vice-presidential candidate gets a majority? If no 
vice-presidential candidate gets the requisite majority in the normal 
Electoral College process, the Senate picks the Vice President. Support 
from 51 out of the 100 senators is needed for victory.
Exploding some myths about 
the Electoral College
 
Presidential elections are so important that it would be surprising if they 
weren’t surrounded by a few myths. The commonest myth is that the Electoral 
College system is by its very nature undemocratic. This fallacy is based on 
the assumption that the winner-take-all system, or plurality voting system, is a 
necessary part of the Electoral College system.
The winner-take-all arrangement sure is unfair because a difference of one 
vote out of millions can switch all the electoral votes of a state from one 
party’s column to the other. Here’s how the system works.
Let’s take a hypothetical state with 12 electoral votes. In a presidential elec-
tion, let’s assume that 2,000,000 votes are cast for the Democratic ticket in 
that state and that the Republican ticket garners 1,999,999 votes — just one 
vote less. The winner-take-all arrangement dictates that in those circum-
stances all 12 electoral votes for that state stand in the Democratic column.
In that scenario, the winner at least has a majority — more than 50 percent — 
of the votes. But the same rule applies where the winner has only a plurality: 
less than 50 percent but more votes than any other candidate.
This doesn’t look like a very fair outcome — and it also makes disputed elec-
tions and recounts much more likely. The close vote in Florida in the 2000 
election is an excellent example of this problem.
The election result in our hypothetical state appears unsatisfactory, to say 
the least. But is that outcome the fault of the Electoral College system, as is 
generally assumed? No, the problem is caused not by the Electoral College 
system itself but by the winner-take-all arrangement that is associated with it. 
But, isn’t winner-take-all part and parcel of the Electoral College system? The 
two systems are generally found together, but that isn’t necessarily so.

121
 Chapter 10: Looking at the Role of Commander in Chief
The winner-take-all arrangement is
 
✓ Not a necessary part of the Electoral College system
 
✓ Not laid down by the Constitution
 
✓ Not used by all states
Explaining the Nebraska and Maine “district method”
Can you really have the Electoral College system without winner-take-all? 
Sure. Two states have already taken the step of separating these two fea-
tures. These states are Nebraska and Maine, which allow the electoral vote to 
be shared between the parties in accordance with the proportion of the vote 
each party gets.
Maine has four electoral votes, based on its two congressmen plus its two 
senators. The state is divided into two congressional voting districts. Let’s 
assume the following results in a hypothetical presidential election:
 
✓ Statewide vote: Democrat 60%, Republican 40%
 
✓ District 1: Democrat 80%, Republican 20%
 
✓ District 2: Democrat 40%, Republican 60%
In this hypothetical situation, the Nebraska–Maine “district method” gives 
two electoral votes to the Democratic ticket for winning the statewide 
popular vote, plus a third electoral vote for winning in District 1, while the 
Republicans pick up one electoral vote for winning in District 2. The overall 
result is then a 3:1 split of the electoral vote, instead of the winner-take-all 
approach which would give all four electoral votes to the Democrats.
Until 2008, neither Nebraska nor Maine had ever actually split its electoral 
votes because Nebraska was normally overwhelmingly Republican, while 
the Democrats have always had big majorities in Maine since the system 
was introduced there in 1972. However, in the 2008 presidential election, 
Senator Barack Obama, the Democratic Party candidate, was awarded one of 
Nebraska’s five electoral votes, with the remaining four electoral votes going 
to Senator John McCain, the Republican flag-bearer.
A simpler version of this system was proposed for Colorado in 2004, but it 
was roundly rejected by an almost two-thirds majority of the voters. The pro-
posal was for the state’s electoral votes to be split in proportion to the votes 
cast for each ticket. So, if the Democrats received 55 percent of the votes and 
the Republicans received 45 percent, Colorado’s nine electoral votes would 
have been split 5:4.

122
Part III: Balancing the Branches of Government 
Those campaigning against the change argued that, because presidential 
elections in Colorado tend to be close, 4 of Colorado’s 9 electoral votes 
would always go to the loser, so that Colorado’s influence on the election 
would amount to only one electoral vote — 5 minus 4. The logic of this argu-
ment may be flawed, but it played well with Colorado voters.
On the basis of the Colorado experience, the winner-take-all method of cal-
culating electoral votes looks set to survive as the dominant system for the 
foreseeable future.
But what about scrapping the Electoral College altogether and going to a 
pure nationwide popular vote system?
Picking the President by popular vote?
The biggest objection to the Electoral College system is that it has on four 
occasions — most recently in 2000 — denied victory to the winner of the popu-
lar vote. I must stress once again that these supposedly “stolen elections” were 
the product not of the Electoral College system itself but of the winner-take-all 
arrangement that is usually, but not necessarily, associated with it.
In the 2000 election, for example, George W. Bush would have been elected 
President with 273 electoral votes to 264 electoral votes for Al Gore if the 
electoral vote in each state had been split in proportion to the popular vote 
in that state. This was very much the same result as was finally certified in 
the actual election of 2000 — but it would have been done without the inter-
vention of the U.S. Supreme Court!
Instead of the legal circus that actually occurred in 2000, under the 
Constitution the election ought to have been thrown into the House of 
Representatives. In that scenario, Bush would have won hands-down 
because he had 30 states in his column as against only 20 (plus the District of 
Columbia) for Gore.
However, on the basis of the popular vote alone, Gore would have won 
because he ended up with about 543,000 votes more than Bush. Scrapping 
the Electoral College altogether and replacing it with a pure popular vote 
system would require an amendment to the U.S. Constitution. What chance 
such an amendment would have of being adopted is hard to say, but it would 
face concerted opposition from those favoring states’ rights, from the smaller 
states generally, and probably from most conservatives.
 
Although pure popular election looks simple, democratic, and modern, it has 
problems of its own. For example, would a plurality of the popular vote be 
enough to win the election, or would the winning candidate need to have a 
majority? If the latter, would there have to be a runoff election — or would the 
House of Representatives have to decide, as under the present system? I dis-
cuss the arguments for and against popular election in Chapter 20.

123
 Chapter 10: Looking at the Role of Commander in Chief
Canning the President
Firing a President — known as impeachment — is just as important as pick-
ing a President in the first place. So how come impeachment gets only this 
itsy-bitsy paragraph here dedicated to it? In fact, impeachment has a whole 
chapter of its own in this book: Chapter 13. Check it out.
Signing, Vetoing, and 
Pocketing Legislation
Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution gives the President an important 
power against Congress: the power to stop any bill passed by both houses of 
Congress from becoming law. This is known as the presidential veto power, 
although the word veto doesn’t appear anywhere in the Constitution.
Here’s a summary of how the President’s veto power works.
 
✓ Every bill (proposed law) has to pass both the Senate and the House of 
Representatives by a majority in each house.
 
✓ After passing both houses, a bill is sent to the President for his approval.
 
✓ If the President approves the bill, he signs it, which makes it law — he 
signs it into law.
 
✓ If the President doesn’t approve a bill, he can veto it by returning it 
unsigned to Congress with his objections.
 
✓ Congress then reconsiders the vetoed bill. A two-thirds majority in both 
houses is needed to override the President’s veto.
 
✓ If the President has not returned a bill within ten days of it being sent to 
him, it becomes law anyway, without the President’s signature.
 
✓ If the President doesn’t sign the bill, and if Congress adjourns before 
the ten-day period is up, the bill doesn’t become law. This provision is 
called the pocket veto.
 
 A pocket veto is better for the President than an ordinary veto because a 
pocket veto kills a bill stone-dead. If Congress still wants the bill passed, 
the bill must start life again in the next session and go through the whole 
procedure from the beginning.
 
 In the 1938 case of Wright v. United States, the Supreme Court approved 
the possibility of Congress appointing agents to send and receive mes-
sages on behalf of Congress during an adjournment, in order to stop 
the President from taking unfair advantage of the pocket veto rule. That 

124
Part III: Balancing the Branches of Government 
practice is now routinely used. The agent is usually either the Clerk of 
the House of Representatives or the Secretary of the Senate, depending 
on the house where the bill originated.
Appointing Key Positions
Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution says that the President
shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, 
shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, judges 
of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose 
Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be 
established by Law.
This provision gives the President the power to make a lot of important 
appointments: Supreme Court justices, other federal judges, Cabinet officers, 
and diplomats, to mention but a few. But all appointments are subject to the 
confirmation of the Senate. The Senate has blocked presidential appoint-
ments so frequently that the phrase “Advice and Dissent” is now often jocu-
larly used instead of the phrase “Advice and Consent” that appears in the 
Constitution.
 
The Senate has sometimes exercised its power to advise and consent in such 
a way as to amount to a veto over the President’s power to appoint qualified 
officials. This power has been exercised more savagely in recent times than 
previously. Besides actually voting a nomination down, the Senate can tie a 
nomination up in committee for so long that it has to be withdrawn, or sena-
tors seeking to block a nomination can keep talking indefinitely to stop a vote 
on the nomination from being taken — a technique known as a filibuster. Here 
are a few examples of these tactics:
 
✓ The Senate started blocking presidential appointments very early on. 
In 1795, by 14 votes to 10, the Senate voted down George Washington’s 
nomination of John Rutledge as Chief Justice of the United States. This 
rebuff to Washington appears to have been motivated by a combination 
of opposition to Rutledge’s political views and a feeling that he was men-
tally unstable.
 
✓ The degree of support enjoyed by a President in the Senate is an impor-
tant factor determining how that body is likely to react to any particular 
nomination. Vice President John Tyler, who succeeded to the presi-
dency on the death of the Whig President William Henry Harrison in 
1841, had more of his nominees to the Supreme Court rejected by the 
Senate than any other President — four nominees, some of whom were 
rejected twice. The reason for this was that the Senate had a majority 

125
 Chapter 10: Looking at the Role of Commander in Chief
of Whigs, whom Tyler had angered by vetoing all their proposed legisla-
tion. He was then expelled from the Whig party and became known as 
“the man without a party.”
 
✓ In 1987, the Senate rejected President Ronald Reagan’s nomination of 
Judge Robert Bork by 58 votes to 42. Bork was extremely well-qualified 
for the appointment in terms of knowledge, intellect, and integrity. He 
was rejected because of his extremely conservative views on politics 
and on the role of the judiciary.
 
✓ Justice Clarence Thomas, nominated to a seat on the Supreme Court 
by President George H.W. Bush in 1991, was subjected to probably the 
most embarrassing hearings of any presidential nominee ever. Thomas 
faced opposition both on the grounds of his conservative views and 
because of allegations of sexual harassment leveled against him by Anita 
Hill, a former colleague of his at the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission. Thomas managed to weather the storm, and he was con-
firmed by the Senate by 52 votes to 48.
 
✓ The nomination by President George W. Bush of John Bolton, an outspo-
ken conservative, as the Permanent U.S. Representative to the United 
Nations, was blocked in May 2005 by a Democratic Party filibuster in the 
Senate. The President appointed Bolton anyway while the Senate was 
in recess — which is specifically allowed under the Constitution as a 
temporary measure. Bush then renominated Bolton in 2006, but oppo-
nents kept a vote from being taken in the relevant Senate committee. 
Eventually, Bolton decided to step down when his recess appointment 
expired in December 2006.
Hailing the Chief: The President’s 
Administration
Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution says, “The executive Power shall be 
vested in a President of the United States of America.” Executive power means 
the power to enforce the law and to administer — or run — the govern-
ment on a day-to-day basis. This provision gives the President power over 
all aspects of the federal government: financial issues, domestic affairs, and 
foreign affairs (not to mention military matters, which I discuss separately a 
little later in this chapter).
The Constitution is silent on the way that the President is expected to per-
form this mammoth task. In practice, the President operates through a vast 
administrative machine — hence the description of a President’s period in 
office as his administration.

126
Part III: Balancing the Branches of Government 
Uncovering the secrets 
of Cabinet secretaries
The President’s chief lieutenants in running his huge empire are his Cabinet 
secretaries, including the Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, Secretary 
of the Treasury, Secretary of the Interior, and Secretary of Homeland 
Security.
 
What’s with this title of secretary? It makes these high officers of state sound 
like jumped-up typists. The title of secretary originated in England, where the 
Secretary of State was originally the King’s private secretary — and the word 
secretary reflected the fact that this office-holder really was the keeper of con-
fidential information.
The secret about U.S. Cabinet secretaries is that their activities are not 
secret. The President does also have some more personal and more confiden-
tial advisers — in the Executive Office of the President, which I discuss a bit 
later in this chapter.
Faithfully executing the laws?
A throwaway clause tucked away in Article II, 
Section 3 of the Constitution requires that the 
President “shall take Care that the Laws be 
faithfully executed.” What exactly does this 
mean? The President does not make law: His 
job is to execute, or enforce, the laws made by 
Congress.
Abraham Lincoln claimed that his duty as presi-
dent to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully 
executed” allowed him to suspend habeas 
corpus — the right of a detained person to ask 
a court to release him or her from detention.
Lincoln also based his decision to suspend 
habeas corpus on the presidential oath of 
office, as laid down in Article II, Section 1 of 
the Constitution, in which the new President 
swears that he “will to the best of my Ability, 
preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of 
the United States.”
In the leading case known as Ex parte 
Merryman, decided in 1861, Chief Justice Roger 
Taney (sitting as a federal circuit judge) ruled 
that Lincoln’s suspension of habeas corpus was 
unconstitutional. Lincoln ignored the ruling.
Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution pro-
vides, “The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas 
Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when 
in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public 
Safety may require it.” But who has the right 
to suspend habeas corpus? The fact that this 
section forms part of Article I, which deals with 
Congress, probably means that the power to 
suspend habeas corpus can be exercised only 
by Congress, with presidential consent, and not 
by the President alone.

127
 Chapter 10: Looking at the Role of Commander in Chief
Article II, Section 2 contains the only reference to the Cabinet officers in the 
original, unamended Constitution:
[The President] may require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer 
in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the 
Duties of their respective Offices.
This cryptic provision raises more questions than it answers. Does this brief 
clause envision a Cabinet at all, or just several separate government depart-
ments doing their own thing? And what’s with “may require the Opinion, 
in writing”? Is that the only way that the President can communicate with 
his own Cabinet secretaries? What about Cabinet meetings? And can’t the 
President give instructions to his Cabinet officers?
The Framers were probably in a hurry to go out to lunch when they drafted 
this baffling snippet, which is both too vague and too precise at the same 
time — if that makes any sense!
In practice, presidents have not been hamstrung by this curious clause. Some 
Presidents have given their Cabinet officers a free hand, while others have 
tried to micromanage the whole enchilada.
Cabinet officers — and in particular Secretaries of State — were much more 
important in the early days than they are today. In the first 60 years of the 
Republic, no fewer than six Secretaries of State made it to the presidency, 
starting with Thomas Jefferson and ending with James Buchanan. Since then, 
not a single President has come from the ranks of the Secretaries of State.
The Tenure of Office Act
In 1867, Congress passed the Tenure of Office 
Act over the veto of President Andrew Johnson. 
This act required the President to obtain the 
consent of the Senate for the removal of any 
Cabinet officer — which had never been the 
case before.
The reason for the passing of this law was that 
President Johnson and Congress didn’t see eye 
to eye. Johnson succeeded to the presidency 
on the death of Abraham Lincoln in 1865 and 
kept Lincoln’s Cabinet in place. But Johnson 
soon fell out with Cabinet members, in particu-
lar with Secretary of War Edwin Stanton.
Johnson attempted to fire Stanton in breach of 
the Tenure of Office Act. Stanton barricaded 
himself in his office with the support of the radi-
cal Republicans in Congress, who proceeded to 
impeach Johnson. The President was acquitted 
by a single vote in the Senate. The Tenure of 
Office Act was repealed in 1887, and a similar 
law was declared unconstitutional by the U.S. 
Supreme Court in 1926.

128
Part III: Balancing the Branches of Government 
Here’s a quick rundown of some important facts about Cabinet officers, most 
of whom (fortunately!) don’t hit the headlines that often:
 
✓ How do you become a Cabinet officer? The President can appoint whom-
ever he likes to his Cabinet — subject to confirmation by the Senate. The 
Senate doesn’t usually give the President as hard a time over Cabinet 
appointments as over his nomination of Supreme Court justices.
 
✓ How do Cabinet officers get fired? The President doesn’t have to con-
sult the Senate or anybody else if he wants to fire a Cabinet secretary. 
This has not always been the legal position, as I explain in the nearby 
sidebar “The Tenure of Office Act.”
 
✓ What do Cabinet officers do? Each Cabinet officer heads up a depart-
ment of the federal government. For example, the Secretary of State, the 
most important Cabinet member, is in charge of foreign affairs. He or 
she is the boss of all ambassadors and ministers representing the United 
States in foreign countries. The Secretary of Defense is responsible for 
the whole defense establishment.
 
✓ Where do Cabinet officers figure in the presidential succession? The 
importance of Cabinet officers is recognized by their presence in the 
order of succession on the death, resignation, or removal of the President. 
The Presidential Succession Act of 1947 places the Vice President in first 
position, followed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the 
President Pro Tempore of the Senate. But then comes the Secretary of 
State and all the other Cabinet secretaries in the order of seniority of their 
offices — so the Secretary of Homeland Security is last in line, because 
that office was created only in 2003. I discuss the question of succession 
to the presidency more fully in Chapter 22.
Unmasking the imperial presidency
The Founders took a lot of flak for creating what some critics saw as a monar-
chy. George Washington was often addressed as “Your Excellency,” although 
he preferred the simpler, more republican-style “Mr. President,” which 
became the normal form of address for all later Presidents — except when 
they were being mocked. (John Adams was referred to as “His Rotundity” 
for being short and fat, and John Tyler was ridiculed as “His Accidency” for 
being the first Vice President to succeed to the Presidency as a result of the 
previous President’s death.)
 
With a few notable exceptions — Andrew Jackson, Abraham Lincoln, and 
Theodore Roosevelt — the President’s power rarely outmatched that of 
Congress in the period before the election of Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 
1932. But then the power of the presidency rapidly escalated. On the basis of 
the Great Depression followed by World War II, FDR established what is some-
times called an “imperial presidency”: a presidency with far greater powers 
than were envisioned by the Framers of the Constitution.

Unlocking the Executive 
Office of the President
The Executive Office of the President (EOP) first came into existence in 1939 
and now comprises a staff of about 1,800 people who are directly responsible 
to the President. Staff in the EOP have the title “Assistant to the President” 
or “Special Assistant to the President.” Senior officials in the EOP include the 
White House Chief of Staff and the White House Press Secretary. Most staff on 
the EOP don’t have to be confirmed by the Senate — which is a great boon to 
presidents.
 
For national security and foreign policy matters, presidents now rely to a 
great extent on the National Security Council (NSC), which is part of the EOP. 
The NSC was first set up during the presidency of Harry Truman in 1947. The 
President chairs this august body himself. Meetings of the NSC are regularly 
attended by Cabinet officers such as the Secretary of State, the Secretary of 
Defense, and the Secretary of the Treasury, as well as by the Vice President. 
However, the NSC, together with the White House Situation Room, is run by 
the National Security Adviser, who is directly responsible to the President. 
(This position’s formal title is Assistant to the President for National Security.)
The Secretary of State as policy-maker
Some Presidents have allowed their Cabinet 
officers more latitude and independence than 
others. Secretaries of State who stand out as 
major policy-makers include:
 ✓ William Henry Seward, who served under 
presidents Abraham Lincoln and Andrew 
Johnson.
 ✓ Elihu Root, who served under presidents 
William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt 
as Secretary of Defense and later as 
Secretary of State, and who was awarded 
the Nobel Peace Prize in 1912.
 ✓ Cordell Hull, who served as FDR’s Secretary 
of State for 11 years, making him the lon-
gest-serving Secretary of State in U.S. 
history. Despite being blamed for denying 
900 Jewish refugees entry into the United 
States in 1939, Hull was awarded the Nobel 
Peace Prize in 1945.
 ✓ General George Marshall, who served as 
Secretary of State and later as Secretary of 
Defense under Harry Truman. He was the 
author of the European Recovery Program — 
known as the Marshall Plan — in the imme-
diate aftermath of World War II. He was 
awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1953.
 ✓ John Foster Dulles, Secretary of State 
under President Dwight D. Eisenhower. He 
is the only Cabinet officer to have an airport 
named for him — the Washington Dulles 
International Airport.
 ✓ Henry Kissinger, who served as Secretary 
of State under presidents Richard Nixon 
and Gerald Ford — a colorful and rather 
controversial character who was awarded 
the Nobel Peace Prize in 1973.

Part III: Balancing the Branches of Government 
The Homeland Security Council (HSC) was established by President George 
W. Bush in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist outrages in 2001. It mirrors the NSC 
on the domestic front. Like the NSC, the HSC forms part of the EOP and is 
chaired by the President himself. As with the NSC, the HSC is under a non-
Cabinet official, in this case the Assistant to the President for Homeland 
Security and Counterterrorism.
Why aren’t the NSC and the HSC under Cabinet officers, the Secretary of State 
and the Secretary of Homeland Security respectively? Because it suits the 
President to keep more direct control of these important bodies by chairing 
their meetings himself and by placing their day-to-day running under hand-
picked “Assistants to the President” — who, if need be, can also be used as 
counterweights to overambitious or unduly independent Cabinet secretaries.
Selling the President’s legislative program
In spite of the separation of powers, the President is inevitably involved in 
legislation. The President’s approval is needed for a law to be passed by 
Congress. But modern presidents do not just wait around for Congress to 
propose legislation: The President has his own legislative program as well.
The President used to connect with Congress through the Bureau of the 
Budget or the Office of White House Counsel. However, in 1953 President 
Dwight Eisenhower formalized the relationship between the executive and 
legislative branches by establishing a Legislative Affairs Office in the White 
House.
 
This arrangement still survives today, with a permanent Legislative Affairs 
Office of about 12 members under the Office of Management and Budget, 
which forms part of the Executive Office of the President. One of the tasks of 
the Legislative Affairs Office is to produce Statements of Administration Policy 
(SAPs) addressed to a house of Congress that set out the President’s views 
on a particular bill or issue. During the second session of  the 110th Congress 
alone, in 2008–2009, no fewer than 88 SAPs were issued.
Most modern presidents have recognized the importance of liaison with 
Congress for the implementation of the President’s legislative program. Even 
before taking office, President Barack Obama named Phil Schiliro as Assistant 
to the President for Legislative Affairs, or simply the Director of Legislative 
Affairs.
Presidents have also employed more direct methods of persuasion in respect 
to policies dear to their hearts. The use of President Lyndon Johnson’s famed 
“Johnson Method” of twisting the arms of recalcitrant lawmakers came into 
its own in the push to have the Civil Rights Act signed into law in 1964. Bill

 Chapter 10: Looking at the Role of Commander in Chief
Clinton appointed an “Intensive Care Unit” to promote the President’s abor-
tive healthcare reform package in Congress. President George W. Bush had a 
hard time selling what became the Medicare Modernization Act to lawmakers 
in 2003.
At the time of this writing, healthcare reform is a top priority with the Obama 
administration, second only to ending the war in Iraq and tackling the eco-
nomic recession. The direct involvement of the President in healthcare 
reform is now taken for granted.
President Obama’s financial “bailout” plan — an extension of one first pro-
posed by President George W. Bush in 2008 — and a major economic stimu-
lus package together represent the closest involvement a President has had 
in legislation regulating the economy since FDR’s New Deal in the 1930s. It 
remains to be seen what effect, if any, this development has on the relative 
power exercised by the President and by Congress.
Battling Executive Privilege
The President has long claimed executive privilege, the right to withhold 
information from the courts or from Congress. The expressed ground for 
this claim is national security, or else the need for confidentiality within the 
executive branch. The claim of executive privilege is ultimately based on 
the doctrine of the separation of powers, under which the three branches of 
government — the executive, the legislature, and the judiciary — are kept 
separate in terms of membership. (But there is a certain amount of overlap in 
function for the purpose of checks and balances.) I discuss the separation of 
powers in Chapter 8.
Claiming executive privilege 
in the early days
The Constitution doesn’t say anything about executive privilege. The term 
“executive privilege” was coined by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in the 
1950s, but the right was first claimed by President George Washington himself.
Washington invoked this right in 1796 by denying a request from the House 
of Representatives for documents relating to the so-called Jay Treaty with 
Britain. Washington gave the documents to the Senate but not to the House, 
on the ground that the Constitution gives the Senate, but not the House, the 
power to ratify treaties.

132
Part III: Balancing the Branches of Government 
The next attempt to use executive privilege resulted in a presidential climb-
down. This occurred when the U.S. Supreme Court ordered President 
Thomas Jefferson to produce private letters about former Vice President 
Aaron Burr, who was tried for treason in 1807. Jefferson reserved “the neces-
sary right of the President of the United States to decide, independently of all 
other authority, what papers coming to him as President the public interest 
permits to be communicated, and to whom.” Jefferson expressed willingness 
to turn over the letters in question, but not in response to a court order, 
because, under the principle of the separation of powers, the President was 
independent of the courts.
Chief Justice John Marshall, who was Jefferson’s spiteful distant cousin, 
ruled that the President had to obey the court order. Jefferson did so, and 
in so doing allowed Marshall to strike a major blow in favor of the power of 
the court. Marshall turned the knife yet further with one of his characteristic 
“twistifications of the law” (Jefferson’s phrase) by defining treason so nar-
rowly that Burr — another of Jefferson’s enemies — had to be acquitted.
Achieving a total blowout 
against President Nixon
The most serious blow to executive privilege was administered by the 
Supreme Court against President Richard Nixon. In 1972, seven White House 
aides were indicted in connection with a break-in at the Democratic National 
Committee offices in the Watergate building in Washington D.C. Special 
Watergate prosecutor Leon Jaworski subpoenaed the tape recordings of 64 
of Nixon’s conversations. The President contended that the special prosecu-
tor couldn’t sue him and that the request was for “confidential conversations 
between a President and his close advisers that it would be inconsistent with 
the public interest to produce.”
 
A unanimous Supreme Court (without Justice William Rehnquist, who recused 
himself because of his friendship with Richard Nixon) ordered the President 
to hand over the tapes. Chief Justice Warren Burger, writing for the court, 
rejected the absolute privilege claimed by Nixon but admitted the existence 
of a qualified executive privilege: “The President’s need for complete candor 
and objectivity from advisers calls for great deference from the courts.” But, 
added Burger, executive privilege had to be based on “a claim of need to pro-
tect military, diplomatic, or sensitive national security secrets.”

133
 Chapter 10: Looking at the Role of Commander in Chief
Balancing recent claims of justice 
against executive privilege
President Bill Clinton crossed swords with the courts over his affair with 
intern Monica Lewinsky. Clinton unwisely invoked executive privilege in 
refusing to allow his aides to be called to testify about the affair. Clinton lost. 
A federal judge ruled that the aides could be called.
Clinton later agreed to waive executive privilege and testify before a grand 
jury himself — but only under certain conditions. In the words of indepen-
dent counsel Kenneth W. Starr, “Absolutely no one is above the law.” On 
the basis of evidence collected by Starr, Clinton became only the second 
President to be subjected to impeachment proceedings. (However, he was 
acquitted and served out the remainder of his second term. He left office in 
January 2001 with a 65 percent approval rating, the highest end-of-term rating 
of any President since Dwight D. Eisenhower 40 years earlier.)
President George W. Bush’s administration also got involved in some battles 
over executive privilege. For example, the administration claimed execu-
tive privilege in declining to disclose information about Vice President Dick 
Cheney’s energy taskforce. In the 2004 case Cheney v. U.S. District Court for the 
District of Columbia, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the administration. 
Here’s an extract from the 7-to-2 ruling:
While the President is not above the law, the Judiciary must afford 
Presidential confidentiality the greatest possible protection, recognizing 
the paramount necessity of protecting the Executive Branch from vexatious 
litigation that might distract it from the energetic performance of its 
constitutional duties.
President George W. Bush also invoked executive privilege over the firing 
of eight federal prosecutors. The administration refused to comply with a 
Senate Judiciary Committee subpoena requiring presidential advisers to tes-
tify before the committee. However, quite a number of Justice Department 
officials resigned — including Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The Bush administration also claimed executive privilege in relation to the 
death in Afghanistan — by “friendly fire” — of popular football player Pat 
Tillman, who had passed up a football contract offer of $3.6 million over 
three years to enlist in the U.S. army.

134
Part III: Balancing the Branches of Government 
Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy identified the central problem in 
regard to claims of executive privilege:
Once executive privilege is asserted, coequal branches of the Government 
are set on a collision course. The Judiciary is forced into the difficult 
task of balancing the need for information in a judicial proceeding and 
the Executive’s Article II prerogatives. This inquiry places courts in the 
awkward position of evaluating the Executive’s claims of confidentiality and 
autonomy, and pushes to the fore difficult questions of separation of powers 
and checks and balances.
This statement recognizes executive privilege as lurking within Article II of 
the Constitution. But the bottom line is that the Supreme Court has given 
itself the right to decide the limits of the President’s powers — and of its 
own powers. Can that be what the Framers of the Constitution intended? See 
Chapter 12 on the judiciary for more discussion.
Making War versus Declaring War
The Founders clearly intended to split responsibility for national defense 
between the President and Congress. Article II, Section 1 gives the President 
total executive power. This broad power links up with Article II, Section 2, 
which says:
The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the 
United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the 
actual Service of the United States.
The problem is how the two passages relate to Article I, Section 8, which 
gives Congress the Power
To declare War . . .;
To raise and support Armies, but no Appropriation of Money to that Use 
shall be for a longer Term than two Years;
To provide and maintain a Navy;
To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval 
Forces;
To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, 
suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions;
To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the Militia, and for 
governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the 
United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the 
Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline 
prescribed by Congress.

135
 Chapter 10: Looking at the Role of Commander in Chief
 
Don’t forget, the Founders were well-bred 18th-century gentlemen who would 
have regarded war between nations as a sort of polite parlor game played by 
the rules of international diplomacy. So, step 1 must be a formal declaration of 
war by Congress. Step 2 is the raising of an army, again by Congress. Step 3 is 
the calling out of the militia. It’s only when you get to Step 4, the actual con-
duct of the war, that the President becomes involved as Commander in Chief 
by deciding on strategy and tactics and leading the troops into battle.
The first five full-scale international wars that the United States was involved 
in were all initiated with a formal declaration of war passed by Congress. 
These wars are the following:
 
✓ The War of 1812 against Great Britain
 
✓ The Mexican–American War of 1846–1848
 
✓ The Spanish–American War of 1898
 
✓ World War I, in which the United States was involved from 1917 to 1918
 
✓ World War II, which for the United States lasted from 1941 to 1945
Controlling the President through 
the War Powers Act of 1973
After World War II, the United States became involved in the Korean War 
in 1950 without any declaration of war. President Harry Truman relied on 
United Nations resolutions as a justification for U.S. involvement and never 
sought congressional authorization.
 
Some members of Congress weren’t happy about this bypassing of Congress 
on the part of the President. The Vietnam War, which lasted from 1964 to 
1973, aroused much fiercer resentment in Congress.
So, in 1973 Congress passed the War Powers Act, providing that
The constitutional powers of the President as Commander-in-Chief to 
introduce United States Armed Forces into hostilities, or into situations where 
imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances, 
are exercised only pursuant to (1) a declaration of war , (2) specific statutory 
authorization, or (3) a national emergency created by attack upon the 
United States, its territories or possessions, or its armed forces.
If any troops are already engaged, the President must pull them out within 
60 days
unless the Congress (1) has declared war or has enacted a specific 
authorization for such use of United States Armed Forces, (2) has extended 

136
Part III: Balancing the Branches of Government 
by law such sixty-day period, or (3) is physically unable to meet as a result 
of an armed attack upon the United States.
The Act goes on to say that, “notwithstanding” the 60-day rule,
any time that United States Armed Forces are engaged in hostilities outside 
the territory of the United States without a declaration of war or specific 
statutory authorization, such forces shall be removed by the President if the 
Congress so directs by concurrent resolution.
It’s worth noting that this act was vetoed by President Richard Nixon, but his 
veto was overridden by a two-thirds majority in both houses of Congress.
Every President since 1973 has declared the War Powers Act unconstitutional — 
yet they have all been careful to comply with its requirements.
Preventing presidential precedents?
If every President has recognized the War Powers Act in practice while 
rejecting it as unconstitutional, who has the correct interpretation of the 
Constitution in this respect, the President or Congress? The answer is that 
both are partly right.
And, if presidents for the past 35 years have all complied with the Act, why 
do they need to reject its validity? In order to free themselves from a law 
that limits presidential power. If the President admits that the act is consti-
tutional, then all presidential actions complying with it since 1973 automati-
cally become legally binding precedents subordinating the President to 
Congress.
Congress’s case in favor of the constitutionality of the War Powers Act is, as 
is stated in Section 2(a) of the act itself, that the act fulfills “the intent of the 
framers of the Constitution of the United States” to “insure that the collective 
judgment of both the Congress and the President will apply to the introduc-
tion of United States Armed Forces into hostilities.”
The President’s position is exactly the opposite. Here is a statement of the 
constitutional position as seen from the President’s point of view, taken from 
a 2003 legal brief from the administration of President George W. Bush:
The Constitution vests the President with full “executive Power,” and 
designates him “Commander in Chief” of the Armed Forces. Together, these 
provisions are a substantive grant of broad war power that authorizes the 
President to unilaterally use military force in defense of the United States’ 
national security.

137
 Chapter 10: Looking at the Role of Commander in Chief
The main difference between the President’s position and that of Congress 
is that the President interprets his constitutional powers as Commander 
in Chief broadly, while Congress adopts a narrow interpretation of these 
powers.
The President’s role as Commander in Chief must surely mean that the 
President is in charge of military operations. To that extent the presidential 
approach is correct.
But the power of the Commander in Chief appears from the Constitution to 
be triggered by a declaration of war, the deployment of troops, and the sum-
moning of the militia (or nowadays, of the National Guard) — all of which are 
functions entrusted by the Constitution to Congress and not to the President.
Perhaps the most important provision in the War Powers Act is the recogni-
tion that insisting on a declaration of war or even congressional authoriza-
tion is unrealistic and unnecessary in the event of “a national emergency 
created by attack upon the United States.”

In This Chapter

▶ Looking at other congressional powers and privileges
T
he United States may be a democracy, but that doesn’t mean that “We 
the People” get to directly elect every branch of the government. Citizens 
don’t vote for Supreme Court justices, for example, and even the President 
is elected indirectly through that thing called the Electoral College (which I 
discuss in Chapter 10).
Where your vote has the most direct effect is in the legislative branch of 
government: the House of Representatives and the Senate. But I’d bet serious 
money that the vast majority of U.S. citizens can’t name both senators cur-
rently representing their state plus the House representative elected from 
their district. Can you?
In this chapter, I explore the responsibilities of both houses of Congress. 
By the time I’m done, I hope you’ll have a better understanding of just how 
important your vote can be and why, if you couldn’t tick off the names of 
your senators and representative just now, you may want to get to know 
these folks a little better.

140
Part III: Balancing the Branches of Government 
Making the Laws That Govern the Land
Article I, Section 1 of the Constitution states:
All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the 
United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.
In a nutshell, this means that Congress has the power to create all federal 
laws. It can’t do so in a vacuum — the President gets a say as well — but all 
laws are birthed in the two houses of Congress. Later in the chapter, in the 
section “Passing Legislation,” I explain in detail the steps Congress takes to 
draft a bill, debate and modify it, and pass it into law.
One function, two houses
 
The fact that there are two houses of Congress means that it is bicameral — 
a word you probably learned in middle school. The Senate is sometimes 
referred to as the upper house and the House as the lower house, but the 
Constitution doesn’t use these designations.
Why a bicameral legislature? George Washington supposedly explained 
the reasoning like this to Thomas Jefferson, who was pouring his tea into a 
saucer before drinking it. “Why did you do that?” Washington asked. “To cool 
it,” came the reply. “Exactly so,” explained Washington. “We pour the House 
legislation into the Senatorial saucer to cool it.” The implication was that the 
House tended to be more partisan while the Senate was more of a delibera-
tive body. Washington’s observation still holds true today (because there are 
fewer senators than representatives, because senators serve longer terms 
than representatives, and because Senate rules are somewhat more relaxed).
 
Strictly speaking, the term congressman or congresswoman should apply to 
a member of either house, but in practice it is used only for members of the 
House, who are also referred to as representatives. Members of the Senate 
are referred to only as senators. Each house is a bit coy when referring to the 
other. Each stops short of ignoring the other house altogether but never refers 
to it by name, calling it instead “the other body.”
Keeping the President in the loop
Do the two houses of Congress have the power to pass any laws as long as 
they both agree? A federal law is known as an Act of Congress, and every Act 
of Congress starts with the formula “Be it enacted by the Senate and House of 
Representatives of the United States in Congress assembled.”

141
 Chapter 11: The House of Representatives and Senate 
 
What about the President? Doesn’t he play a role in legislation? Yes, he most 
certainly does. His approval is needed before a bill (a proposed law) can 
become an Act of Congress. He must respond to a bill within ten days (not 
counting Sundays) because if he doesn’t the bill becomes law automatically. 
The President can veto any bill, and Article I, Section 7 states that his veto can 
be overridden only by a two-thirds majority of both houses. Also, in practice 
many bills nowadays originate from the White House rather than from the 
Capitol (the building occupied by Congress). So it turns out that Congress 
does not have all legislative power after all.
Visiting the People’s House
The two houses of Congress are equal under the Constitution, and both are 
needed for a law to be made, but each house has special features and func-
tions that are not shared with the other. In this section, I walk you through 
the particulars of the House of Representatives.
Who gets to elect the House?
Since the day the Constitution was enacted, 
“the People” have had the right to elect the 
House of Representatives. But which people 
have that right? The Constitution isn’t particu-
larly helpful on that point. All it says is this, in 
Article I, Section 2:
 
 The House of Representatives shall be com-
posed of Members chosen every second 
Year by the People of the several States, 
and the Electors in each State shall have 
the Qualifications requisite for Electors of 
the most numerous Branch of the State 
Legislature.
This seems a surprisingly vague and round-
about provision. But there is a reason for the 
murkiness. The right to vote in federal elections 
is based on the right to vote in state elections, 
and this right is left to the states to decide.
In the early days, voting rights were not uniform 
across the country; they varied from state to 
state. Hence the provision that the right to vote 
for the House of Representatives would go to 
everyone entitled to vote for “the most numer-
ous Branch of the State Legislature.” (This is 
the lower house in those states — all except 
Nebraska — that have a bicameral or two-
house legislature. In 41 states, the lower house 
is called the House of Representatives, in five 
states it’s called the Assembly, and in three it’s 
called the House of Delegates.)
Today, voting rights for the upper house, or 
state senate, are exactly the same as those 
for the lower house, but this was not always 
the case. Originally, voting rights for the lower 
house were more liberal.

142
Part III: Balancing the Branches of Government 
Representing the U.S. population
The House of Representatives has always been directly elected by the people 
(unlike the Senate, as I explain later in the chapter). Therefore, it’s known 
as “the people’s house.” Since 1911 (except for the period from 1959 to 1963), 
the House (as it’s commonly referred to) has had 435 voting representatives. 
The present makeup of the House is
 
✓ 435 representatives from the 50 states
 
✓ Non-voting delegates (one each) from Washington, D.C. and the territo-
ries of American Samoa, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands
 
✓ A Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico
There’s roughly one representative for every 647,000 U.S. residents (based on 
the census of the year 2000). Keep in mind I’m talking about population here, 
not the number of voters.
 
Because representation is based on a state’s population, it’s possible for a 
state to gain or lose representatives as its population changes. These gains or 
losses take place during the reapportionment of House seats, which happens 
every ten years based on the U.S. Census. In 2000, for example, four states 
gained an extra two representatives each, two states lost two seats each, and 
quite a few states either gained or lost one seat.
Although House seats are based on population, each state is entitled to at 
least one representative, no matter how small it is. Wyoming has way below 
647,000 inhabitants but still has one representative in the House.
Respecting the power of the Speaker
The Framers of the Constitution make only one mention of the important 
office of Speaker of the House: “The House of Representatives shall chuse 
their Speaker and other Officers.” They probably didn’t think it was neces-
sary to write a job description because the position was already familiar from 
colonial times and from the British Constitution, which says that the Speaker 
presides over debates without being allowed to participate in them.
The Speaker of the British House of Commons remains studiously neutral and 
has practically no political power. By contrast, the Speaker of the House of 
Representatives has an armory of powers, just about the least of them being 
the right to participate in debate and to vote — which is rarely exercised, 
except on constitutional amendments or other really important issues.

143
 Chapter 11: The House of Representatives and Senate 
 
The Speaker comes immediately after the Vice President in the line of succes-
sion to the presidency. This chain of succession isn’t in the Constitution itself 
but in the Presidential Succession Act of 1947. Some people have questioned 
the constitutionality of this provision, but it has never been tested because no 
Speaker has ever succeeded to the presidency.
Redistricting and gerrymandering
Each of the 435 representatives in the House 
represents a voting district, referred to by state 
and number. For example, Speaker Nancy 
Pelosi represents the eighth Congressional 
District of California, which covers most of San 
Francisco. As populations shift, congressional 
voting districts sometimes have to shift as well. 
Otherwise, a district may be home to too many 
or too few residents to be represented by a 
single member of the House.
In 36 states, redistricting is done by the state 
legislature, mostly subject to the approval of 
the governor. Seven states have handed this 
important power to an independent bipartisan 
commission, though in two of these states the 
state legislature has the final say. The remain-
ing seven states have only one representative 
each, so the problem doesn’t arise.
The term gerrymander is the dubious legacy 
of Elbridge Gerry, who was governor of 
Massachusetts from 1810—1813 and Vice 
President from 1813—1814. Gerry proposed a 
redistricting bill for Massachusetts that blatantly 
favored his own Democratic-Republican party. 
One narrow, elongated district so resembled 
a lizard that it prompted someone to remark 
“Salamander?” To which a wag retorted, “No, 
gerrymander.” The name stuck, and Gerry went 
down to defeat for reelection as state governor.
There has been no shortage of charges of 
gerrymandering over the years. The object is to 
maximize the number of seats won by your 
own party without wasting too many votes. 
Two techniques of gerrymandering have been 
identified:
 ✓ Where the opposition party has a comfort-
able majority in a particular district, you 
add more opposition-dominated counties 
to it so that the opposition has, if possible, 
an 80 percent or 90 percent majority in 
that district. This strategy is called pack-
ing. The opposition party would carry that 
district anyway, but now a lot of its votes 
are wasted because it needs only a simple 
majority (50+ percent) to win. By packing 
an opposition-controlled district, you don’t 
waste too many of your own party’s votes.
 ✓ Next comes cracking, which is redistricting 
so that your party has a comfortable but not 
overwhelming majority in as many seats as 
possible. You crack a minority of opposi-
tion voters into those districts so that those 
votes are wasted without wasting too many 
of your own party’s.
The Supreme Court has found that the 
Fourteenth Amendment, which I discuss in 
Chapter 21, provides some protection against 
gerrymandering. However, in a 2004 decision, 
the Supreme Court found that claims related to 
political (but not racial) gerrymandering cannot 
be resolved by the court.

Part III: Balancing the Branches of Government 
Presiding over debates, or not
The role of Speaker of the House has developed into one of the most power-
ful in the U.S. system of government. As is so often the case, the Speaker’s 
true position is attributable more to party politics than to constitutional law. 
The Speaker is the presiding officer of the House, but that’s just the start.
The function of actually presiding over debates is usually delegated to a rep-
resentative of the Speaker’s choosing. During debates, whoever is presiding 
is addressed as “Mr. Speaker” or “Madam Speaker,” except when the House 
resolves itself into a Committee of the Whole — which is a fancy way of saying 
that the House considers itself to be a committee for the purpose of making 
changes (amendments) to bills. When that happens, the Speaker passes the 
gavel to another presiding officer, who is addressed as “Mr. Chairman” or 
“Madam Chairman.” For important debates, the presiding officer will be a 
senior member of the majority party, but for routine debates it could be quite 
a junior representative.
The presiding officer decides who to recognize, meaning who to allow to 
speak in debates. He or she also rules on points of order, though such rulings 
can be appealed to the whole House. (Joseph Gurney Cannon, who served as 
Speaker from 1903 to 1911, ruled the House with an iron fist and supposedly 
recognized only the representatives he liked.)
Leading the House’s majority party
The Speaker’s most important role is as leader of the majority party in the 
House. (The House Majority Leader, who is subordinate to the Speaker, 
assists the Speaker in persuading the representatives of the majority party 
to support the party’s legislative program.) Because the Constitution doesn’t 
recognize the existence of political parties (see Chapter 10), it’s not surpris-
ing that the Speaker’s true role isn’t even mentioned. But from this strong 
partisan base, the Speaker’s power and influence flow.
The Speaker’s chief concern is to make sure that the majority party’s program 
is passed into law. The Speaker’s influence extends to deciding which bill is 
considered when. Subject to the approval of the majority party’s conference 
or caucus (a body made up of all representatives belonging to that party), 
the Speaker chooses 9 of the 13 members of the powerful Rules Committee 
(the other 4 coming from the minority party). The Rules Committee controls 
amendments, debate, and timetabling. Here’s what I mean:
 
✓ Amendments are changes to a bill on its way to becoming an Act of 
Congress, or a law. These changes can be very important, and no bill 
goes through unchanged. Representatives propose amendments to bills. 
The Rules Committee sifts through these proposals and decides which 
amendments should be allowed to be considered by the whole House.
 
✓ Debate, or discussion, on a bill happens before the House votes on it. 
Representatives try to persuade their fellow members to vote either in 

145
 Chapter 11: The House of Representatives and Senate 
favor of a bill or against it. Debate in the House is not unlimited (in con-
trast with the Senate, which I discuss later in this chapter). The Rules 
Committee decides on the limits in the scope and time available for 
debate on any particular bill.
 
✓ Timetabling is important because the fate of a bill may depend on 
the amount of time allowed for its debate. If the majority party leader-
ship wants a bill passed quickly and without much publicity, the Rules 
Committee may allocate little or no debate time to it. But if the majority 
party leadership wants to create a big publicity campaign in favor of a 
bill, they are more likely to arrange a liberal debate schedule for it.
So by controlling the Rules Committee, the majority party and the Speaker 
have a stranglehold over the House.
Dancing with the President
When the White House is occupied by a president of the same party as the 
Speaker, the Speaker tends to defer to the President. But when the Speaker 
and President are from opposite parties, the Speaker can become essen-
tially the leader of the opposition. For example, Speaker Tip O’Neill openly 
opposed President Ronald Reagan’s domestic and defense policies; President 
Bill Clinton came up against a formidable foe in Speaker Newt Gingrich; and 
Speaker Nancy Pelosi took a strong line against President George W. Bush.
But being members of the same party doesn’t guarantee harmony either. At 
the start of the 20th century, Speaker Joseph (“Uncle Joe”) Gurney Cannon 
didn’t get on well with fellow Republican President Teddy Roosevelt, who 
was described by the Speaker as having “no more use for the Constitution 
than a tomcat has for a marriage license.”
Controlling the nation’s purse strings
 
The House is in charge of the nation’s finances — an enormous responsibility 
in a nation whose budget is in the trillions, and reason enough for you to get 
familiar with the person representing your home district. You wouldn’t just 
hand your wallet over to a stranger in the grocery store and say, “I need some 
food. Can you buy it for me?” The U.S. government buys lots of things on your 
behalf — infrastructure, public education, the military — so it makes sense to 
know who’s collecting your money to make those purchases.
Here’s what Article I, Section 7 of the Constitution says about this responsibility:
All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; 
but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills.
The first half of this provision means that the House alone can originate tax 
legislation, but the second half ensures that the Senate has influence as well.

146
Part III: Balancing the Branches of Government 
 
Why does the House get first dibs at crafting tax-related legislation? The 
Framers of the Constitution didn’t forget the slogan that led to U.S. indepen-
dence in the first place: “No taxation without representation.” For the Senate 
to initiate tax bills would be unfair because in the Senate small states are over-
represented in terms of their population and big states are underrepresented. 
The Framers knew that “the people’s house” should have the principal voice 
in deciding how much of the people’s money the government can claim.
But just because the House gets it paws on revenue legislation first doesn’t 
mean the Senate is in a weak position. The power to add amendments to 
legislation is crucial. The reality is that when the Senate receives revenue leg-
islation, it can add new provisions, change tax rates — alter it as much as its 
members (at least a majority of them) deem appropriate.
The flip side of raising money is spending it, which occurs thanks to appro-
priation bills: bills authorizing the spending of federal funds. The Constitution 
doesn’t specify that the House is solely responsible for originating those bills, 
so in theory, they could originate in the Senate as well. And sometimes they 
do. However, the House wants to keep the upper hand in all financial legisla-
tion, so when the Senate does send it an appropriations bill, that bill usually 
gets ignored.
Deciding disputed presidential elections
The House also has another special power that the Senate doesn’t: the right 
to decide disputed presidential elections. The Twelfth Amendment, ratified 
in 1804, states that if no candidate has a majority of electoral votes, the elec-
tion is taken to the House of Representatives. As I explain in Chapter 10, it’s 
not enough for a winning candidate to have a plurality of electoral votes; that 
person must receive an absolute majority of more than 50 percent.
The House has exercised this power on two occasions: in 1800 (to elect 
Thomas Jefferson) and in 1824 (to elect John Quincy Adams). In 1876, in 
the midst of highly disputed election results, it delegated its power to an 
Electoral Commission, which ushered Rutherford B. Hayes into power.
Some people think the House should have been asked to decide the election 
of 2000, which instead was decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. The House 
gets involved in deciding a presidential election only after all the states 
have certified their election results. But in 2000, the presidential candidates 
rushed to court over the Florida election result before it was certified. So the 
House never got a look-in.

147
 Chapter 11: The House of Representatives and Senate 
A couple of flaws exist with the House’s power to decide a disputed election:
 
✓ Each House member gets one vote. That may seem fair because the 
number of representatives in a state is determined by the state’s popula-
tion. The problem is that this system differs from the Electoral College 
system, which lets each state have as many votes as it has senators and 
representatives. In other words, a state with a small population (and 
only one representative in the House), like Alaska or Vermont, gets three 
votes in the Electoral College. But that same state gets only a single vote 
if the disputed election goes to the House.
 
✓ The House has the power to choose the President, but the Senate has 
the power to choose the Vice President. If the two houses are controlled 
by different parties, this could result in having a Republican President 
and a Democratic Vice President, or vice versa.
 
 Why does this flaw exist? The Framers of the Constitution failed to 
appreciate the importance of political parties. As a result, Thomas 
Jefferson served as Vice President under John Adams, who belonged to 
a different party. Difficult as that situation was 200 years ago, it would be 
a serious problem in today’s extremely partisan political environment. 
In my opinion, a better solution would be to throw disputed elections 
to both houses of Congress together, which would choose both the 
President and the Vice President.
Impeaching the President 
and other civil officers
The Constitution gives the House of Representatives “the sole Power 
of Impeachment.” It then gives the Senate “the sole Power to try all 
Impeachments.” This language means that in impeachment cases, the House 
of Representatives acts as the prosecutor and is empowered to bring the 
charges, and the Senate acts as the jury and decides the outcome or ver-
dict. This is such an important function of the two houses of Congress that I 
devote an entire chapter to it: Chapter 13.
Declaring war
The Constitution splits war powers between the President and Congress. The 
President is Commander in Chief , but in Article I, Section 8, Congress is given 
the power to “declare War” and to “raise and support Armies.”

148
Part III: Balancing the Branches of Government 
Congress has exercised its power to declare war only five times during the 
whole history of the United States. The last time Congress declared war was 
in World War II. Congress didn’t declare war in any of these major conflicts:
 
✓ The Korean War
 
✓ The Vietnam War
 
✓ The Persian Gulf War
 
✓ The war in Afghanistan
 
✓ The Iraq War
 
Congress did “authorize” all these military engagements, but that isn’t the 
same thing as a declaration of war. Critics of presidential power say that all 
these wars were illegal because a legal war requires a Congressional declara-
tion of war. Those who defend the President’s war powers say that Congress’s 
constitutional power to “declare War” isn’t the same as a power to commence 
or initiate war. The people who take this line of argument believe that the 
President as Commander in Chief can initiate a legal war without the need for 
a Congressional declaration of war.
The War Powers Resolution (or Act) of 1973 says that, “in the absence of a 
declaration of war,” the President has to submit a written report to Congress 
within 48 hours of sending U.S. troops into action in any foreign country. The 
Act goes on to say that the President must withdraw these troops from the 
foreign country concerned within 60 days unless Congress has in the mean-
time either declared war or specifically authorized the President’s decision 
to send the troops into the foreign country.
Can you run for the House or Senate?
If you plan to run for a seat in the House of Rep-
resentatives, keep these requirements in mind:
 ✓ You have to be at least 25 years old.
 ✓ You have to have been a citizen of the 
United States for at least seven years.
 ✓ When elected you must be living in the state 
where the voting district that you represent 
is situated.
The Senate gets its name from a similar body 
in the Roman Republic. The name comes from 
the Latin word senex, which means “old man.” 
So it’s not surprising that senators have to be 
a little older than representatives. Here’s the 
scoop on becoming a senator:
 ✓ You have to be at least 30 years old.
 ✓ You have to have been a citizen of the 
United States for at least nine years.
 ✓ When elected you must be living in the state 
that you represent.

149
 Chapter 11: The House of Representatives and Senate 
 
Is the War Powers Act constitutional? Presidents have generally taken the 
view that the 1973 law is unconstitutional. So, every time a President has 
drafted a report required by that Act, he has said that his report was “consis-
tent with” the War Powers Act — not that it was “pursuant to” the Act. Writing 
a report “pursuant to” a particular law means that the writer is acting in obedi-
ence to that law. But writing a report that is “consistent with” a particular law 
doesn’t entail recognition of the validity or constitutionality of that law. The 
question of the constitutionality of the War Powers Act has not yet been 
tested in court. I tackle the serious and topical question of the President’s war 
powers in Chapter 10.
Getting to Know the Senate
The Senate is an august body made up of just 100 members (two from each 
state) who serve six-year terms — longer than those of any other elected 
officeholders in the federal government. The Senate has two ancestors:
 
✓ The Senate of Ancient Rome
 
✓ The British upper house, the House of Lords
The Senate is the embodiment of federalism: a political system in which 
national and state governments share power. Hence the words emblazoned 
above the Dirksen Senate Office Building: “The Senate is the Living Symbol of 
Our Union of States.”
 
If the House of Representatives is “the people’s house,” the Senate is the 
states’ house. James Madison wrote that “the government ought to be 
founded on a mixture of the principles of proportional and equal representa-
tion.” The House of Representatives provides proportional representation: 
States are represented according to the size of their populations. The Senate 
provides equal representation for each state.
For example, California has 53 representatives for its 36 million inhabitants, 
and Wyoming has just one representative for its population of 515,000. But in 
the Senate, Wyoming and California get two members each. So in the House, 
the biggest states are dominant, but in the Senate, the smallest states have 
equal influence.
So important is this principle that Article V of the Constitution protects it in a 
way that no other provision is protected: “No State, without its Consent, shall 
be deprived of its equal Suffrage [right to vote] in the Senate.” For example, 
say a constitutional amendment was proposed that said Alaska was hence-
forth to have only one seat in the Senate. Even if this amendment was ratified 
by the requisite three-fourths of all state legislatures, it would not take effect 
unless Alaska (through its elected officials) gave its consent.

150
Part III: Balancing the Branches of Government 
Electing a senator
Originally, the Constitution called for senators to be chosen by each state’s 
legislature rather than by popular vote. This arrangement worked okay at 
first, but it broke down under bitter party rivalries in the 19th century, which 
sometimes left senate seats vacant for years at a time.
In the late 19th century, some states started using a type of referendum 
that effectively allowed the direct election of senators. Popular pressure 
built up in favor of a constitutional amendment for the direct election of 
senators nationwide. About two-thirds of the states had already introduced 
direct election to the U.S. Senate by the time this reform became part of the 
Constitution through the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913 
(see Chapter 22). Unlike members of the House of Representatives, who are 
elected by their individual voting districts, each senator is elected by the 
state as a whole.
Direct popular election gave the Senate democratic credibility that it had 
lacked before, and with it came enhanced prestige. Senators now tend to refer 
to themselves not by their official designation as “senator from New Mexico” 
but rather as “senator for New Mexico,” which sounds more democratic.
Senators with higher aspirations
After 1913, when the Seventeenth Amendment 
called for senators to be elected by popular 
vote, senators became much more likely to 
be nominated for higher office. Here are some 
recent examples:
 ✓ Both Barack Obama and John F. Kennedy 
were sitting senators who were elected 
President without ever being a state gover-
nor or Vice President.
 ✓ Harry Truman and Richard Nixon were 
elected to the Vice Presidency immediately 
after serving in the Senate, and both of 
them later became President.
 ✓ Senator Hubert H. Humphrey was elected 
Vice President in 1964 and ran for President 
on the Democratic ticket in 1968.
 ✓ In 1992, Democratic Senator Al Gore was 
elected Vice President. After serving two 
terms, he ran for President in 2000 with 
Senator Joe Lieberman as his running mate.
 ✓ In 1996, the Republicans chose Senator 
Robert Dole as their presidential candidate.
 ✓ In 2004, the Democratic ticket was made up 
of two senators: John Kerry for President 
and John Edwards as his running mate.
 ✓ In 2008, senators really came into their 
own. Not only were the two main party 
nominees — Barack Obama and John 
McCain — sitting senators, but the contend-
ers for the Democratic Party nomination were 
mainly drawn from the ranks of the Senate as 
well. They included Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, 
Christopher Dodd, and John Edwards.

151
 Chapter 11: The House of Representatives and Senate 
Of the two senators from a particular state, the one with the longer unbroken 
tenure is known as the senior senator from that state, and the other is known 
as the junior senator. But these titles don’t reflect any difference in status. 
The official title of a senator takes this form: “The Honorable John Doe, 
the junior senator from Wyoming.” But nowadays, we generally just write 
“Senator John Doe.”
 
Elections to the Senate are staggered. A class, made up of roughly one-third 
of the Senate, is up for election every two years. Senators’ terms of office are 
arranged so that both seats from a particular state are never contested at 
the same time. And while senators enjoy longer terms than any other elected 
federal officials (six years), they can also run for reelection as many times as 
they like.
Presiding over the Senate
The Constitution gives the Vice President the job of presiding over the 
Senate. Here’s what Article I, Section 3 of the Constitution says:
The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate, but 
shall have no Vote, unless they be equally divided.
In practice, the Veep doesn’t often preside over the Senate. He’s likely to 
have more important things to do, and in any case, he doesn’t have an active 
role to play in the Senate. He can’t participate in debate and can cast a vote 
only to break a tie. For this reason, the Constitution provides for the election 
of “a President pro tempore, in the Absence of the Vice President.”
The position of president pro tempore (“president for the time being”) usu-
ally goes to the most senior senator of the majority party. Election to this 
position is a great honor, and the president pro tempore ranks immediately 
after the Speaker of the House of Representatives in the line of succession to 
the presidency. But the president pro tempore of the Senate wields a lot less 
power than the Speaker of the House.
The functions of the office of president pro tempore are not fixed. Each 
holder of the office molds it in his own image. When he chairs the Senate, 
the president pro tempore has full authority to administer oaths and to sign 
legislation on behalf of the Senate. In the absence of the Vice President, the 
president pro tempore presides together with the Speaker of the House when 
both houses of Congress sit together in joint sessions. The president pro 
tempore presides over the Senate as frequently or infrequently as he likes 
and quite often names other senators, sometimes even freshmen senators, to 
chair meetings of the Senate in his absence.

152
Part III: Balancing the Branches of Government 
The president pro tempore forms part of the leadership of his party in the 
Senate, but his role in the party is subordinate to that of the majority leader. 
(In the House, by contrast, the Speaker is the leader of the majority party, as I 
explain earlier in this chapter.)
Advising and consenting
The Senate has some important powers not shared by the House of 
Representatives, most notably the power of “Advice and Consent.” Here’s 
what Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 says about this power:
[The President] shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of 
the Senate, to make Treaties . . . ; and he shall nominate, and by and with 
the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other 
public Ministers and Consuls, judges of the supreme Court, and all other 
Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise 
provided for . . .
 
There has been some disagreement about what this provision means in prac-
tice. The text indicates that the President is meant to have both the power to 
nominate and the power to appoint. Some people argue that the Senate was 
intended to question or prevent those nominations and appointments only in 
cases of favoritism, incompetence, or fraud. But from the beginning, partisan 
politics influenced the Senate’s power to advise and consent.
For example, George Washington’s 1796 nomination of John Rutledge as the 
second Chief Justice was blocked by the Senate at least partly for political 
reasons (though Rutledge also had some mental problems). Since then, a 
lot of presidential nominations have been blocked by the Senate on a party 
political basis, including Judge Robert Bork’s nomination to the U.S. Supreme 
Court by President Ronald Reagan.
Judges up for confirmation are now routinely asked questions about their 
views on privacy and abortion, which are just as much political as legal ques-
tions. Another technique favored by both parties in recent years is simply 
to delay the holding of hearings, which has left a good number of vacancies 
among federal circuit and district court judges, who form the backbone of the 
federal judiciary.
The views of the senators from a nominee’s home state are often weighted 
in the Senate. The term blue slip process refers to this situation. The blue slip 
system has lately been expanded, giving a senator virtual veto power over 
appointments of judges not only from her home state but also from any other 
state in the circuit to which her home state belongs. (The states are grouped 
into 11 circuits for the federal court system.)

153
 Chapter 11: The House of Representatives and Senate 
Passing Legislation
The main function of Congress is to make laws, and Congress is the federal 
lawmaking body in the United States. A law passed by Congress is known as 
an Act of Congress, which starts life as a bill. No fewer than 14,000 bills were 
introduced during the 110th Congress of 2007–2009, but only 449 of these 
were actually passed (and of those, 144 just renamed some federal buildings). 
But where do all these bills come from? There are several possible sources:
 
✓ Lobbyists. There are now almost 35,000 registered Congressional lob-
byists, double the number that there were in 2000. Lobbyists may even 
prepare the text of a bill for a sympathetic member to introduce.
 
✓ Election campaign promises or party platforms.
 
✓ Petitions from citizen groups.
 
✓ State legislatures. They may pass memorials asking Congress to pass 
certain laws.
 
✓ Executive communications. These may come from the President, a 
Cabinet member, or an independent agency.
 
An alternative way of proposing legislation is by joint resolution, which is 
practically indistinguishable from a bill except that it normally begins with a 
preamble explaining the need for the legislation. Like a bill, a joint resolution 
must be passed by both houses of Congress and must be accepted or vetoed 
by the President. And like a bill, it becomes a law. Joint resolutions are used to 
authorize minor government expenditures, to create commissions and other 
bodies, and for other fairly technical legislation. But they can also be used for 
some pretty important stuff, like admitting new states into the Union (a power 
specifically reserved to Congress by Article IV, Section 3 of the Constitution) 
and proposing an amendment to the Constitution.
Tracking a bill’s progress
A bill may start its life either in the House or in the Senate. (As I explain 
earlier in the chapter, if the bill raises taxes, it must originate in the House, 
which has power over revenue.) The way in which bills are proposed differs 
between the two bodies:
 
✓ In the House, a member wishing to introduce a bill places it in the hopper, 
a wooden box next to the rostrum. The bill, or at least its title, used to be 
read out before the whole House, but this practice is no longer followed.
 
✓ In the Senate, the procedure may be more formal, with the sponsor 
introducing his bill from the floor. But the bill can also simply be left 
with the clerk without any comment.

154
Part III: Balancing the Branches of Government 
The bill is referred to the appropriate standing committee, of which the 
House has 20 and the Senate 16. Each committee is led by a chairman belong-
ing to the majority party and a “ranking member” of the minority party. The 
committee may hold hearings and collect relevant evidence. I explain the 
committee process in detail in the next section.
If the committee is in favor of the bill, it is reported out of the committee and 
reaches the floor of the chamber concerned. (If the committee doesn’t favor 
the bill, it can be killed without ever reaching the floor.) The House or Senate 
may then debate the bill and amend it. The debate process differs between 
the two houses.
Debating in the Senate
In the Senate, the presiding officer must recognize the first senator who rises 
to speak about a bill, but the majority and minority leaders are generally 
given first dibs. Senate speeches aren’t required to be relevant to the bill 
being debated, and senators may usually speak for as long as they like.
 
To delay or block a vote on a bill, senators can use a special tactic not avail-
able in the House: the filibuster. Essentially, to filibuster means to talk so long 
that the Senate can’t actually vote on a bill. The record is held by Senator 
Strom Thurmond, who filibustered the Civil Rights Act of 1957 by talking con-
tinuously for more than 24 hours.
Since 1917, it has been possible to end a filibuster by passing a cloture 
(French for “closure”) motion. This tactic isn’t often used because it needs 
a three-fifths majority to pass or, if it involves changing Senate rules, a two-
thirds majority. Plus, cloture doesn’t stop debate immediately; it allows 30 
more hours of debate — a number that can be increased by another three-
fifths majority.
Debating in the House
In the House, debate is much more tightly controlled. The presiding offi-
cer has a good deal of freedom to decide whom to recognize. The Rules 
Committee determines whether amendments to a particular bill are going 
to be allowed or not. Debate is normally limited to one hour: a half hour for 
each party. Each party appoints a floor manager, who allocates time to mem-
bers who wish to participate in the debate. If a lot of members want to have 
their say, a member may be allocated 2 minutes or even just 30 seconds.
Voting
After the debate, the bill is put to a vote. The House uses several different 
forms of voting but nowadays generally uses an electronic vote. The Senate 
shuns such modern gadgetry. In that body, the typical manner of voting is by 
roll call: The clerk calls out the name of each senator in alphabetical order, 

155
 Chapter 11: The House of Representatives and Senate 
the member votes “Aye” or “No,” and the clerk repeats the member’s vote. 
It’s a time-consuming process. (Thank heavens there are only 100 senators.)
Moving to the other body
After a bill is passed by one house of Congress, it is sent to the other cham-
ber, which may pass, reject, or amend it. If the bill is amended by the second 
house, a conference committee made up of members of both houses meets 
to reconcile the differences. Conference committees have, on occasion, 
departed from both versions in producing a composite bill. President Ronald 
Reagan once remarked, “If an apple and an orange went into conference con-
sultations, it might come out a pear.” For the bill to pass, both houses have 
to agree to the conference committee’s version.
Landing on the President’s desk
The bill is then ready to be presented to the President. The President may 
either sign it into law or veto it, and he offers a message giving the reasons 
for either action. A presidential veto can be overridden only by a two-thirds 
majority of both houses.
If the President does nothing, the bill automatically becomes law after ten 
days (excluding Sundays). However, if Congress adjourns during that ten-day 
period, the bill fails. This situation is known as a pocket veto because it’s as 
if the President just puts the bill in his pocket and forgets about it. Unlike a 
regular veto, a pocket veto can’t be overridden by Congress because the bill 
is not returned to Congress.
 
The pocket veto has recently attracted some controversy. If a President tries 
unsuccessfully to exercise a pocket veto on a bill, then the President’s non-
response allows that bill to become law automatically. To avoid this outcome, 
recent presidents have started using a so-called protective return veto. The 
President exercises a pocket veto but then returns the vetoed bill to Congress. 
President George H.W. Bush and President Bill Clinton both used this tactic. If 
it is successful, this type of veto kills the bill in question without any chance 
of a Congressional comeback. But, just in case this tactic doesn’t work, the 
President can at least be sure that he has vetoed the bill in the ordinary way 
and that it will not automatically become law.
Examining congressional committees
In his 1885 book on Congressional Government, future President Woodrow 
Wilson wrote, “It is not far from the truth to say that Congress in session is 
Congress on public exhibition, whilst Congress in its committee rooms is 
Congress at work.” There are no fewer than 200 congressional committees 
and subcommittees. Although the first committees were established in 1789, 
the present committee system dates from 1946.

156
Part III: Balancing the Branches of Government 
Types of committees
There are three main types of congressional committees:
 
✓ Standing: Permanent committees within the House and the Senate.
 
✓ Select, or special: Committees created by the House or Senate to do 
work not covered by existing standing committees.
 
✓ Joint: Committees with members from the House and the Senate that 
tackle issues relevant to both. Most of these are standing committees, 
but a select committee can also be a joint committee.
There’s a standing committee for most every branch of government, includ-
ing Armed Services, Budget, Foreign Affairs (which in the Senate is called the 
Foreign Relations Committee), Judiciary, and Homeland Security. As I note 
earlier in the chapter, a powerful standing committee in the House is the 
Rules Committee. (Its counterpart in the Senate, known as the Committee on 
Rules and Administration, is much less powerful.)
At present there are only two select committees in the House:
 
✓ The Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming
 
✓ The Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence
In the Senate, there are three select committees:
 
✓ Ethics
 
✓ Intelligence
 
✓ A Special Committee on Aging
Committee powers
 
Congressional committees have very wide powers, including the power to 
investigate and keep a check on the President, his Cabinet, and other execu-
tive branch officials. Committees may look into the effectiveness of laws that 
have been passed, the need for new legislation, and the performance of the 
executive (and to some extent of the judiciary).
Committees may hold hearings and can compel a witness to testify or to pro-
duce certain documents by issuing a subpoena. Witnesses who ignore a sub-
poena can be cited for contempt of Congress, which is similar to contempt of 
court. The penalty for this offense is a maximum of 12 months in jail.
 
A debate has long raged about whether Congress can subpoena executive offi-
cials and compel their testimony. People who take this line are likely to reject 
executive privilege while upholding congressional privilege (which I explain in 
a nearby sidebar). For more on this topic, see Chapter 8 on the separation of 
powers.

The Judicial System

▶ Recognizing the courts’ jurisdiction
▶ Securing a court position
▶ Valuing the crown jewel of judicial independence
▶ Tracing the power of judicial review
▶ Watching the swing vote in action
▶ Defining judicial labels
T
he legislature, the executive, and the judiciary are the three branches of 
government. The legislature, or Congress, passes laws. The executive, or 
the President, must “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” But what 
is the function of the judiciary? It’s more complex than you may imagine, and 
I start this chapter with a brief discussion of that function.
With the function of the judiciary defined, I then delve into discussions of 
how someone becomes a judge, why judges aren’t subject to the same types 
of term limits as presidents and members of Congress, and how the courts 
have assumed greater powers than the Founding Fathers ever imagined.
Examining the Courts’ Function
Section 1 of Article III of the Constitution says:
The judicial Power of the United States shall be vested in one supreme 
Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time 
ordain and establish.

158
Part III: Balancing the Branches of Government 
But what exactly does this judicial power consist of? Section 2 of Article III 
was drafted to answer this question, and it’s a mouthful. I’ll let you turn to 
the Appendix if you’re brave enough to read it, but here are the key points:
 
✓ The U.S. Supreme Court has original jurisdiction over cases involving 
ambassadors and other diplomats, and cases in which a state is a party. 
This means that in these two types of cases alone the Supreme Court 
can hear the case from the beginning, as a court of first instance.
 
✓ In all other cases, the Supreme Court has only appellate jurisdiction — 
the power to act as an appeal court from lower federal courts or, in 
regard to certain matters, from state courts.
Defining jurisdiction
The appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court (and all other federal courts) 
is made up of two main categories: federal question jurisdiction and diversity 
jurisdiction. These terms don’t actually appear in the text of the Constitution; 
they are a form of modern shorthand for what Article III, Section 2 says. Both 
of these categories are pretty technical, but here are the basic concepts 
involved:
 
✓ Jurisdiction refers to the power of a court to hear a particular case or 
type of case. For example, if a citizen of Florida sues a citizen of Ohio in 
a dispute over real estate situated in Texas, the state courts of Florida, 
Ohio, and Texas all have jurisdiction to hear the case, but the courts of 
New Jersey would have no jurisdiction to hear it.
 
✓ Federal question jurisdiction and diversity jurisdiction are the two main 
types of jurisdiction possessed by the federal courts:
 
• Federal question jurisdiction essentially covers cases involving fed-
eral law.
 
• Diversity jurisdiction covers cases where the plaintiff and the 
defendant are from different states, provided the amount of money 
in controversy is above a certain threshold, which is now set at 
$75,000 and is periodically adjusted to keep up with the times. The 
question here is what law is applicable. Should it be the law of the 
plaintiff’s state, the law of the defendant’s state, or federal law? 
Under the so-called Erie Doctrine, adopted by the high court in 
1938, the Supreme Court (and other federal courts) must apply the 
substantive law of the state where the cause of action arose.

159
 Chapter 12: “During Good Behaviour”: The Judicial System 
Applying the law
How do Supreme Court justices and other federal judges decide cases in 
practice? To put it at its simplest, they apply the law to the facts of the case. 
Trial courts spend a lot of time sorting out the facts, but the Supreme Court 
doesn’t hear any live evidence, so it concentrates on the law.
Here are some of the important questions that the Supreme Court has to ask 
about the law:
 
✓ What is the relevant law that is being challenged?
 
✓ How should it be interpreted?
 
✓ What are the relevant constitutional provisions?
 
✓ How should they be interpreted?
 
✓ Is the challenged law in keeping with the Constitution, or is it 
unconstitutional?
 
✓ What previous relevant cases are there?
 
✓ Should these cases be followed, distinguished, or overruled?
Appointments and Elections: 
Becoming a Judge
Federal judges are appointed by the President, subject to confirmation by 
the Senate. Supreme Court justices, District Court judges, and judges of the 
federal Courts of Appeals are appointed “during good Behaviour” — meaning, 
for life. Other federal judges are appointed for long terms — for example, 15 
years in the case of bankruptcy judges.
State court judges, by contrast, are mostly chosen by popular election. No 
fewer than 39 states elect at least some of their judges, and 87 percent of 
all state judges in the nation are elected. In some states, judges are initially 
appointed by elected officials but can then be reappointed by means of reten-
tion elections. These elections may take the form of a “Yes” or “No” vote, 
where the judge in question is not running against anybody else. Yet, even in 
such cases, unpopular judges have been voted out. Chief Justice Rose Bird of 
California is an example. She was removed from office in 1986 on the basis of 
a sweeping vote against her.

160
Part III: Balancing the Branches of Government 
Judging the election process
Here are some of questions to consider about popularly elected judges:
 
✓ Can anybody run for election as a judge? No. In most states with 
elected judges, you have to be a member of the state bar in order to 
qualify.
 
✓ How does a lawyer become a judge? Whenever a vacancy occurs 
between elections, the state governor appoints someone to fill the office 
temporarily. At election time, these appointees run as incumbents (and 
usually get elected).
 
✓ For how long do elected judges serve? Terms vary from state to state, 
but a six-year term is common for the lower courts. Judges can run for 
reelection as many times as they want.
 
✓ How do voters pick a judge? Here’s how elections usually work:
 
• State bar associations sometimes rate the candidates. This may 
be helpful to voters, but it may also favor the more establishment-
minded candidates or those who have been members of the local 
bar association for a long time.
 
• The candidates usually finance their campaigns using their own 
funds or by soliciting contributions, and they put out their own 
campaign literature.
 
• In most states, candidates for judgeships must run as individuals 
without party labels, but they often hint at their party affiliation.
 
• Candidates are not normally allowed to make specific campaign 
promises, but some give an indication that they are going to be 
tough on crime.
 
✓ Can candidates for judicial election announce their views on dis-
puted political and legal issues? Yes. That was the answer that the 
U.S. Supreme Court gave in the 2002 case known as Republican Party 
of Minnesota v. White. The Minnesota Supreme Court prohibited judi-
cial candidates from revealing their views on most issues. By 5 votes 
to 4, the high court ruled that the Minnesota prohibition violated the 
First Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech. Justice Ruth Bader 
Ginsburg, writing for the minority, opined, “Judges are not politicians, 
and the First Amendment does not require that they be treated as politi-
cians simply because they are chosen by popular vote.”

161
 Chapter 12: “During Good Behaviour”: The Judicial System 
Considering whether elections 
taint the judiciary
 
Justice Ginsburg’s remark goes to the heart of the matter. She seems to have 
assumed that judges are above politics and that they decide cases purely on 
the basis of law. In fact, judges have political views just like anybody else — and 
their political views cannot help but color their legal decisions. Most judges are 
not too difficult to pigeonhole in terms of their political preferences — on the 
basis of which it’s usually quite easy to predict how they are likely to rule.
This fact applies just as much to unelected U.S. Supreme Court justices as to 
elected state court judges. Justice Ginsburg is herself a prime example of a 
judge whose views on any given case can usually be predicted. She is one of 
the most politically liberal members of the court, and her voting record on 
the court matches her political outlook.
Justice Sandra Day O’Connor formed part of the majority in the White case, 
but she later said that she regretted her vote. O’Connor had herself started 
out as an elected judge in Arizona but favored the switch from elected to 
appointed judges that took place there in the 1970s. She said, “I watched the 
improvement of the judiciary in that state.” Her preference? “If I could wave 
a magic wand . . . I would wave it to secure some kind of merit selection of 
judges across the country.”
Even in her concurring opinion in White, Justice O’Connor took some side-
swipes at elected judges. As she put it, “I am concerned that, even aside from 
what judicial candidates may say while campaigning, the very practice of 
electing judges undermines” the state interest in having an impartial judiciary.
O’Connor made the following attacks on elected judges (and my responses 
are in italic):
 
✓ Elected judges are less likely to be impartial, because they “cannot 
help being aware that if the public is not satisfied with the outcome of a 
particular case, it could hurt their reelection prospects.” Maybe. But is 
this necessarily a bad thing? It means that elected judges’ rulings are more 
likely to be in tune with public opinion — in contrast with the decisions 
of U.S. Supreme Court justices, who do not answer to the people and can 
remain in office until they drop dead.

162
Part III: Balancing the Branches of Government 
 
✓ “Contested elections generally entail campaigning. And campaigning for 
a judicial post today can require substantial funds . . . Even if judges were 
able to refrain from favoring donors, the mere possibility that judges’ 
decisions may be motivated by the desire to repay campaign contribu-
tors is likely to undermine the public’s confidence in the judiciary.” This 
sure looks bad. But should the whole system of elected judges be thrown 
out because of it? That would be throwing the baby out with the bathwater. 
Instead, why not introduce some campaign finance reform? North Carolina 
has already done that with the Judicial Campaign Reform Act, which man-
dates using public money to pay for judicial election campaigns.
Understanding Judicial Independence 
without Accountability
The independence of the federal judiciary is enshrined in the Constitution. 
It’s easy to miss because the relevant section doesn’t actually include the 
word independence at all. Instead, the relevant provision is buried in this 
throwaway clause in Article III, Section 1:
The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their Offices 
during good Behaviour, and shall, at stated Times, receive for their Services 
a Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in 
Office.
Bypassing term limits and salary concerns
What exactly is meant by “during good Behaviour”? Convicted criminals in 
jail are usually allowed time off for good behavior. Does that phrase have the 
same meaning as it does here? No.
 
“During good Behaviour” is the guarantee of judicial independence. It means 
that Supreme Court justices, federal district judges, and appeals court judges 
can’t be fired by the President or anybody else for any reason — unless they 
are impeached and found guilty of “Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes 
and Misdemeanors.” I discuss impeachment in Chapter 13.
So, unless removed from office after impeachment, these top judges are 
appointed for life. Many of them resign of their own accord when they feel 
no longer able to cope with the demands of the job. But some have stayed in 
office until they dropped dead, like Chief Justice William Rehnquist, follow-
ing the example of his idol, John Marshall, who died in office after serving as 
Chief Justice for 34 years.

163
 Chapter 12: “During Good Behaviour”: The Judicial System 
The “during good Behaviour” provision is linked with a prohibition on reduc-
ing a judge’s salary after his or her appointment. Justices and judges pro-
tected by these two provisions can certainly afford to be independent. No 
matter what views on law and politics they may espouse at the time of their 
appointments, they can change their minds as much as they like afterward.
Is that a bad thing? Not necessarily, but it means they can decide cases 
entirely according to their personal predilections — or “the whim of the 
gavel.” This situation is particularly dangerous in the U.S. Supreme Court, 
which decides many highly sensitive political issues. The independence of 
the Supreme Court justices is independence without accountability. Nine 
unelected and unaccountable people can decide the fate not only of individu-
als but also of the nation as a whole. And all too often the decision is in the 
hands not of nine but of one — the swing vote. (I discuss the swing vote in 
detail later in this chapter.)
 
Chief Justice William Rehnquist termed judicial independence “one of the crown 
jewels of our system of government.” Supreme Court justices owe their appoint-
ments to the President, but once in office they can take whatever line they like.
Consider some examples:
 
✓ Chief Justice Earl Warren was picked for the top spot by President 
Dwight Eisenhower in 1953 on the assumption that he was a conserva-
tive. When Warren turned out to be one of the most liberal justices of 
all time, Eisenhower famously remarked that Warren’s appointment was 
“the biggest damned-fool mistake I ever made.” But there was nothing 
Eisenhower nor any other President could do about that.
 
✓ More recently, Justices Harry Blackmun, John Paul Stevens, and David 
Souter also turned out to be much more liberal on the bench than was 
anticipated. Souter, appointed in 1990, was widely expected to adopt 
extremely conservative positions. The National Organization for Women 
held a rally to oppose his confirmation, and the then-president of that 
organization actually testified at Souter’s confirmation hearing that his 
appointment would “end . . . freedom for women in this country.” Souter’s 
confirmation was also opposed by the NAACP, which asked its members 
to write their senators to block his appointment to the court. Yet Justice 
Souter has emerged as one of the most liberal justices on the court.
Grappling with issues the Constitution 
doesn’t address
Such examples are what judicial independence is all about — or is it? 
Independence from direct political pressure is one thing. But what about 
independence from indirect political, social, and intellectual currents?

164
Part III: Balancing the Branches of Government 
Some of the most contentious recent constitutional battles concern affirma-
tive action, abortion, gay rights, and same-sex marriage. What did Benjamin 
Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, or James Madison think about these issues? 
The answer is nothing. None of these issues were in the air when the 
Constitution was being drafted, nor for a very long time afterward.
 
So, what does the Constitution have to say on these issues? The Constitution 
doesn’t address any of them, precisely because the Framers weren’t aware 
of them. Justices who adhere to the living Constitution school of thought read 
into the Constitution the broad doctrines that they claim to have found there 
by way of extrapolating from the words that actually figure in the text. On the 
other hand, textualists, originalists, and other justices loosely described as 
strict constructionists generally refuse to speculate on how the Framers would 
have reacted to the modern problem issues but claim to stick to what the 
Constitution actually says. In the upcoming section “Labeling Supreme Court 
Justices,” I explain each of these approaches to the Constitution.
Examining the abortion litmus test
Why did Harry Blackmun, who wrote for the majority in Roe v. Wade, 
espouse abortion rights? Nobody put a pistol to his head to force him to do 
so. It was an exercise of free will on his part — and it formed part of a pattern 
of liberal beliefs that he had come to hold after his appointment to the high 
court. These beliefs included women’s rights generally, gay rights, and the 
rights of convicted prisoners.
Blackmun concluded his concurring opinion in a 1992 abortion case, Planned 
Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, on a personal note: “I am 
83 years old. I cannot remain on this Court forever, and when I do step down, 
the confirmation process for my successor well may focus on the issue 
before us today. That, I regret, may be exactly where the choice between the 
two worlds will be made.” The phrase “the choice between the two worlds” is 
telling. Based on what we have seen in subsequent confirmation hearings for 
Supreme Court justices, Blackmun was absolutely right in identifying abor-
tion rights as a litmus test for future appointments to the high court.
Blackmun’s choice of one world rather than the other was the product 
of complex factors — including his social and economic background, his 
psychology, and his temperament — which led him to adopt ideas and doc-
trines that would be labeled liberal. Similar but opposite forces made Justice 
William Rehnquist consistently oppose liberal ideas, which is why he dis-
sented in Roe.
Were Blackmun and Rehnquist independent in choosing these two different 
worlds? Independent, yes, but maybe not autonomous — a term which is 
often used loosely as a synonym for independent but is not quite the same. 

165
 Chapter 12: “During Good Behaviour”: The Judicial System 
Blackmun and Rehnquist, just like all of us, were conditioned by innumer-
able factors to be influenced by opposing social, political, and legal stimuli. 
Justices are human, after all, and cannot block out influences that affect the 
rest of the population.
 
So, how does the judicial independence of unelected judges and justices 
differ from that of elected judges? Probably only in this regard: that unelected 
judges have independence without accountability while the independence of 
elected judges is tempered by political accountability. Is there anything wrong 
with that? In my opinion, no, as long as elected judges don’t allow themselves 
to be bought by campaign donors and wealthy backers.
Making the Judiciary Paramount: 
Judicial Review
In Marbury v. Madison, decided in 1803, Chief Justice John Marshall claimed 
the power of judicial review for the courts, and in particular for the U.S. 
Supreme Court. I discuss this landmark case throughout the book and par-
ticularly in Chapter 23. (The nearby sidebar “John Marshall’s conflict of inter-
est” provides some background.)
Understanding the nature 
of judicial review
Almost all the cases heard by the Supreme Court today fall under the court’s 
appellate jurisdiction, which I discuss earlier in the chapter. Since the pass-
ing of the Judiciary Act of 1925, the great majority of cases heard by the high 
court under this head are cases of judicial review — which, strictly speaking, 
are not appeals at all.
 
An appeal is normally an application to a higher court contesting the decision 
of a lower court. In contrast, in a judicial review, the appellate court concerned 
reviews the lawfulness of a law passed by Congress or a state legislature, or a 
decision or other executive action taken by the President or a state.
Application for judicial review is made by filing a petition for a writ of certio-
rari with the appropriate appellate court. If the court agrees to hear the case, 
it is said to grant certiorari. This phrase does not mean that the court agrees 
with the petitioner — only that the court is prepared to hear the petitioner’s 
case. An appellate court exercising the power of judicial review doesn’t get to 
hear any live witnesses, and there is no jury — only a bench of judges. In the 

166
Part III: Balancing the Branches of Government 
U.S. Supreme Court, the decision whether certiorari is to be granted or not is 
decided by four justices. Every case in which certiorari has been granted is 
then heard by all nine justices sitting together — which places a huge burden 
on them.
Judicial review doesn’t figure in the wording of the Constitution. Yet early in 
the country’s history, it became the mainstay of the power of the Supreme 
Court. Today, judicial review is more important than ever.
 
Judicial review gives the U.S. Supreme Court the power to decide whether a 
federal or state law is in violation of the U.S. Constitution. If the court finds 
that the law in question conflicts with the Constitution, the court declares the 
law unconstitutional. This ruling means that the law (or the relevant part of 
the law) is void, or of no effect. Another way of describing this situation is to 
say that the court strikes the law down, because the effect of the court’s deci-
sion is to strike the law (or the relevant part of the law) from the record as if it 
never existed in the first place.
John Marshall’s conflict of interest
One of the key problems with the case of 
Marbury v. Madison relates not to the decision 
itself but to the circumstances surrounding it.
The case arose out of lame-duck President 
John Adams’s attempt to appoint a whole bunch 
of “midnight judges” — 16 circuit judges and 42 
justices of the peace — the day before his term 
was due to end. These were all political appoin-
tees. Adams, a Federalist, had been deprived 
of a second term by his defeat at the hands 
of his own Vice President, Thomas Jefferson, 
a Democratic-Republican, in the 1800 elec-
tion. So Adams decided to take his revenge by 
ensuring that the judiciary remained Federalist-
dominated well beyond his presidency.
All these “midnight” appointments were rushed 
through the Senate. But the commissions, or 
official letters of appointment, still had to be 
delivered to each of the new appointees. Time 
ran out on Adams’s presidency before all the 
commissions had been delivered — and with-
out an official commission, an appointment 
could not take effect.
William Marbury was one of Adams’s “mid-
night” justices of the peace whose commission 
was not delivered in time. President Thomas 
Jefferson ordered the new Secretary of State, 
James Madison, to withhold the commissions 
that hadn’t been delivered, including Marbury’s. 
So Marbury petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to 
order Madison to deliver his commission to him.
Madison was the named defendant because 
delivering commissions to new appointees 
was one of the duties of the Secretary of State. 
Marbury’s beef was with Madison for not deliv-
ering the commission to him. But the guy who 
really let Marbury down wasn’t Madison — it 
was Madison’s predecessor as Secretary of 
State, John Marshall. Yes, that’s the very same 
John Marshall who presided over the case as 
Chief Justice. If ever there was a blatant exam-
ple of a conflict of interest, this had to be it!
But that didn’t stop Marshall from going on to 
expand the power of the Supreme Court — and 
of himself as Chief Justice — by means of judi-
cial review.

167
 Chapter 12: “During Good Behaviour”: The Judicial System 
Judicial review is more important today than ever before because:
 
✓ The U.S. Supreme Court has expanded the scope of the Constitution to 
cover issues that the Framers never intended it to cover, such as abor-
tion, affirmative action, and gay rights.
 
✓ The high court has narrowed down the political question doctrine, 
which says that the courts should keep its hands off questions that are 
entrusted by the Constitution to one of the other branches of govern-
ment, either the President or the Congress. A good example of this 
development is the Supreme Court’s determination of the presidential 
election of 2000 in Bush v. Gore.
 
✓ The high court has interpreted the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth 
Amendment so widely as to make practically the entire Bill of Rights 
applicable to the states as well as to the federal government — giving the 
court far more control over the states than the Framers ever envisioned.
Tracing the origins of judicial review
If the high court wasn’t given the power of judicial review by the 
Constitution, where did this power come from? There is considerable dis-
agreement on this question. Here are some possible answers:
 
✓ Although judicial review isn’t specifically mentioned in the 
Constitution, it’s implied. This position was taken by Alexander 
Hamilton in the Federalist Papers even before the Constitution was rati-
fied. (Note that the Federalist Papers were published precisely in order 
to win enough support for the Constitution to be ratified.) Hamilton’s 
argument runs as follows:
 
• The Constitution is “fundamental law.”
 
• Any law that conflicts with the Constitution is therefore void.
 
• Who should decide the constitutionality of a particular law? It’s 
“rational to suppose” that the courts were intended to have this 
power because “The interpretation of the laws is the proper and 
peculiar province of the courts.”
 
 The problem with this explanation is that judicial review is so important 
a power of the Supreme Court that, if the Framers really intended to give 
the court this power, it’s hard to understand why they didn’t actually 
spell it out. The  omission of any mention of judicial review from the text 
of the Constitution is unlikely to be accidental and may well indicate a 
deliberate decision not to give the court this awesome power.

168
Part III: Balancing the Branches of Government 
 
✓ The existence of a written constitution with the status of fundamen-
tal law makes judicial review necessary. Somebody has to decide 
whether any federal or state law is in conflict with the fundamental 
law — and who more appropriately than the courts? How convenient! 
Why can’t such conflicts be decided by the legislature? This solution is 
what the Virginia constitution of 1776 provided for that state. (See the 
upcoming section “Considering alternatives for solving Constitutional 
conflicts.”)
 
✓ Judicial review was invented by John Marshall in Marbury v. 
Madison. Judicial review was discussed long before Marbury at the 
Constitutional Convention and in the state ratifying conventions — and 
it also figures in the Federalist Papers. But all this discussion makes 
it more rather than less likely that its omission from the Constitution 
was deliberate — which can only mean that judicial review was feared 
as likely to give the judiciary too much power. That certainly was the 
view of certain individual Framers. Here, for example, is what Charles 
Pinckney of North Carolina had to say in 1799:
On no subject am I more convinced, than that it is an unsafe and 
dangerous doctrine in a republic, ever to suppose that a judge ought to 
possess the right of questioning or deciding upon the constitutionality of 
treaties, laws, or any act of the legislature. It is placing the opinion of an 
individual, or of two or three, above that of both branches of Congress, 
a doctrine which is not warranted by the Constitution, and will not, I 
hope, long have many advocates in this country.
 
 So if some of the Framers held such strong views against judicial review, 
why didn’t they specifically ban it in the Constitution? As I explain 
above and in the upcoming section “Considering alternatives for solving 
Constitutional conflicts,” Alexander Hamilton was one Framer who did 
support the idea of judicial review. But, though Hamilton was influential, 
he recognized the fears that the prospect of judicial review aroused 
even before the Constitution came into force (at a time when Hamilton 
was desperately trying to ensure the Constitution’s ratification). 
Hamilton’s state, New York, ratified the Constitution by the narrow 
margin of 30 votes to 27. In that situation, Hamilton wisely did not press 
for judicial review to be spelled out in the text of the Constitution — and 
those who opposed judicial review could take comfort from its omission.
 
✓ John Marshall didn’t cite any precedents for judicial review in his 
opinion in Marbury v. Madison. So this must mean that no such 
power existed before. No. In fact, there were some earlier Supreme 
Court precedents. Why did Marshall not mention them? Probably 
because of the ginger approach adopted in them. In two of them, while 
striking down congressional legislation, Justice Samuel Chase shrank 
from laying claim to the right to judicial review: “It is unnecessary, 
at this time, for me to determine, whether this court constitutionally 

169
 Chapter 12: “During Good Behaviour”: The Judicial System 
possesses the power to declare an act of Congress void, on the ground 
of its being made contrary to, and in violation of, the constitution.” Here 
are the relevant precedents:
 
• Hayburn’s Case of 1792, which declared an Act of Congress void 
because it required high court justices to undertake some nonjudi-
cial work.
 
• Hylton v. United States, decided in 1796, in which the high court set 
aside an Act of Congress.
 
• Ware v. Hylton, decided in 1796, in which a Virginia law was 
struck down. As it happens, the future Chief Justice John Marshall 
appeared as counsel in this case and argued in favor of upholding 
the Virginia law.
 
• Calder v. Bull, decided in 1798, affirming the decision in Ware v. 
Hylton.
Noting Jefferson’s response to 
Marbury v. Madison
Thomas Jefferson, a distant cousin and sworn enemy of John Marshall, was 
President at the time of Marbury v. Madison. Jefferson rejected what he called 
Marshall’s “twistifications of the law” in claiming the power of judicial review 
for the Supreme Court. Here’s what he wrote shortly after the Marbury ruling:
The opinion which gives to the judges the right to decide what laws are 
constitutional and what not, not only for themselves in their own sphere 
of action but for the Legislature and Executive also in their spheres, would 
make the Judiciary a despotic branch.
Jefferson’s fears proved well-founded. Judicial review gave the Supreme 
Court power over Congress and the President that was contrary to the whole 
idea of three coequal branches under the doctrine of separation of powers.
What did Jefferson do to counter Marshall’s twistifications? He first set in 
motion the impeachment of Justice Samuel Chase. This move was blatantly 
political. Chase, like Marshall, was a staunch member of the opposition 
Federalist Party. Jefferson was hoping to use Chase’s impeachment as a 
springboard to impeaching Marshall. Chase was impeached but was acquit-
ted on all counts — and Jefferson gave up any hope of going after Marshall.
But what about challenging the decision in Marbury? Not even Jefferson could 
figure out a way of doing so — despite the glaring conflict of interest involved 
(see the sidebar “John Marshall’s conflict of interest”).

Part III: Balancing the Branches of Government 
Considering alternatives for solving 
Constitutional conflicts
The real problem was a practical one. If judicial review was abolished, how 
would conflicts between the Constitution and other laws be resolved? The 
1776 Constitution of Virginia suggested an alternative approach. Section 7 of 
that Constitution’s Bill of Rights read as follows:
That all power of suspending laws, or the execution of laws, by any 
authority, without consent of the representatives of the people, is injurious 
to their rights, and ought not to be exercised.
We should not be surprised to learn that the Constitution of Virginia was 
mainly drafted by none other than Jefferson himself.
 
The section in question clearly takes away from the judiciary the power of 
“suspending” and, therefore, also of setting aside any law. In other words, judi-
cial review was not permitted under the Virginia constitution. This power was 
given instead to the popularly elected legislature. This is not a bad solution 
and is much more in keeping with democratic principles than judicial review 
exercised by unelected judges.
The legislature would presumably take its time in deliberating whether any 
particular law should be suspended — but the courts are not exactly noted 
for their speed of action either.
So, why didn’t Jefferson try to introduce the same ban on judicial review 
into the federal Constitution? Jefferson was abroad and didn’t attend the 
Philadelphia Convention that drafted the U.S. Constitution, but there was no 
reason a prohibition on judicial review couldn’t have been included in the 
Bill of Rights. Jefferson returned from France in 1789. The Bill of Rights was 
drafted in 1789 and ratified in 1791. There would have been ample opportu-
nity to add a prohibition on judicial review.
If Jefferson had tried to prevent judicial review, he would have found himself 
up against a formidable adversary, Alexander Hamilton, one of the leading 
Framers of the Constitution. In the influential and authoritative Federalist 
Papers, Hamilton in 1788 described the judiciary as “the least dangerous 
to the political rights of the Constitution” and as “beyond comparison the 
weakest of the three departments of power.” On this basis, Hamilton actu-
ally specifically advocated judicial review — before the Constitution was 
even in force. (Keep in mind that the very possibility of conflict between 
the Constitution and other laws was in 1788 purely hypothetical, and most 
people did not give it much thought at all.)

171
 Chapter 12: “During Good Behaviour”: The Judicial System 
Watching the Supreme Court’s 
power seep into politics
 
Like Alexander Hamilton,  James Madison saw judicial review as implied by 
the Constitution. But Madison’s take on this possibility was very different from 
Hamilton’s. Instead of justifying judicial review like Hamilton, Madison foresaw 
and deplored the danger of judicial review. Here’s what Madison wrote on 
October 15, 1788:
In the State Constitutions, and, indeed, in the Federal one also, no provi-
sion is made for the case of a disagreement in expounding them; and as the 
Courts are generally last in making their decision, it results to them, by refus-
ing or not refusing to execute a law, to stamp it with its final character. This 
makes the Judiciary Department paramount in fact to the Legislature, which 
was never intended and can never be proper.
The problem has turned out in practice to be far more serious than Madison 
could have predicted, largely because of the bold intrusion of the high court 
into politics.
The political question doctrine is potentially one of the most valuable consti-
tutional doctrines. It springs from the fundamental doctrine of the separation 
of powers. The doctrine requires the courts to decline jurisdiction in a case 
which the Constitution has entrusted to either the executive or the legislature.
Here are a couple of recent examples of the application of this doctrine:
 
✓ In Goldwater v. Carter, decided in 1979, Senator Barry Goldwater and 
other members of Congress challenged President Jimmy Carter’s right 
to break a treaty with Taiwan — thereby favoring Red China — without 
consulting the Senate. The U.S. Supreme Court threw out the application 
on the ground that it raised a political question “because it involves the 
authority of the President in the conduct of our country’s foreign rela-
tions.” The court left open the question of the constitutionality of the 
President’s action.
 
✓ In Nixon v. United States, decided in 1993, a federal judge, Walter Nixon 
(no relation to the former president), challenged the handling of an 
impeachment trial by the Senate. Nixon had been convicted of perjury 
before a grand jury but refused to resign from office even after he had 
been jailed. The Senate then impeached and removed him from office. 
The Supreme Court unanimously threw out his application on the 
ground that impeachment was under the control of Congress and the 
court had no right to get involved.

172
Part III: Balancing the Branches of Government 
Cases like these are obvious political questions. But what about all the other 
issues in which the court gets involved, like abortion, gay rights, or the elec-
tion of the President? Aren’t these actually political questions too? That 
argument has never been used in relation to those issues. Yet other countries 
around the world have laws about abortion and gay rights that are decided 
by legislators, not judges.
For the courts to become embroiled in such highly fraught political debates 
could easily be interpreted as judicial activism at its worst, usurping the role 
of the other branches of government. On the other hand, the very existence 
of a written constitution makes it likely that almost any issue of importance is 
likely to find its way sooner or later into a high court docket.
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has recognized that for the court to have made 
abortion a constitutional issue could also have harmed the pro-choice cause 
that she favors. Here’s what she said about Roe v. Wade long before she took 
her seat on the Supreme Court: The court’s ruling terminated “a nascent 
democratic movement to liberalize abortion law.” And: “Heavy-handed judi-
cial intervention was difficult to justify and appears to have provoked, not 
resolved, conflict.”
Casting the Swing Vote
With judicial review as its main weapon against the President, Congress, 
and the states, the power of the Supreme Court grew unchecked. For nine 
unelected judges to exercise this kind of power has often been criticized as 
undemocratic. But at certain times, the power has been exercised not by nine 
judges but by one — the wielder of the swing vote. If judicial review is by its 
very nature undemocratic, then unbridled judicial review power exercised by 
a single judge can only be regarded as anti-democratic in the extreme. In this 
section, I present some key examples of the power of the swing vote.
Recalling “the switch in 
time that saved nine”
In the 1930s, Franklin D. Roosevelt found his New Deal programs blocked at 
every turn by a 5–4 majority on the Supreme Court — made up of four con-
servative judges (the so-called “Four Horsemen”) plus Justice Owen Roberts, 
exercising a swing vote. As I discuss in Chapter 9 and Chapter 23, Roberts 
was so influential that his decision to switch sides in 1937 was hailed as “the 
switch in time that saved nine.” (The “nine” were the high court justices.) 

173
 Chapter 12: “During Good Behaviour”: The Judicial System 
Roosevelt had proposed naming additional justices to the Supreme Court 
(because the Constitution doesn’t limit the number of justices), but Roberts’s 
decision to switch sides made that proposal unnecessary.
Wielding the swing vote under 
Rehnquist and Roberts
Under Chief Justices William Rehnquist and John Roberts, Justices Sandra 
Day O’Connor and Anthony Kennedy were able to flex their muscles by cast-
ing swing votes. Since O’Connor’s retirement in 2005, Kennedy has exercised 
disproportionate influence by holding in his hands the determination of a 
number of sensitive cases — which also often gave him the right to write the 
majority opinion for the court. For example,
 
✓ Kennedy’s swing vote put George W. Bush into the White House in the 
2000 decision in Bush v. Gore.
 
✓ His vote also gave victory to the conservatives on the court in Boy 
Scouts of America v. Dale, which allowed the Boy Scouts to exclude gays 
from membership as scoutmasters. But in Lawrence v. Texas, decided in 
2003, he joined O’Connor and the liberals on the court to strike down a 
Texas law criminalizing homosexual intercourse.
 
✓ On abortion, Kennedy has taken the side of the liberals. In Planned 
Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, decided in 1992, his 
vote produced a controlling plurality that struck down a Pennsylvania 
law requiring a husband to be notified before an abortion could be per-
formed. In this case, Kennedy initially supported the four conservative 
justices — thus producing a majority — in favor of striking down Roe v. 
Wade. However, at the last minute Kennedy switched his swing vote to 
save Roe v. Wade.
 
✓ The debate on partial-birth abortion in Stenberg v. Carhart in 2000 saw 
Kennedy on the side of the conservative minority.
 
✓ Kennedy has generally adopted a liberal line on capital punishment. In 
Roper v. Simmons, decided by 5 votes to 4 in 2005, Kennedy wrote the 
opinion for the majority, ruling that it was unconstitutional to execute 
Christopher Simmons for a murder committed when he was under 18.
 
 Despite the horrendous nature of the murder, Kennedy ruled that “The 
Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments forbid imposition of the death pen-
alty on offenders who were under the age of 18 when their crimes were 
committed.” His opinion was that no exceptions are allowed to this blan-
ket ruling, which effectively strikes down provisions in the death penalty 
laws of 20 states. I discuss the Simmons case in more detail in Chapter 21.

174
Part III: Balancing the Branches of Government 
 
✓ However, in Kansas v. Marsh, decided in 2005, Kennedy gave the con-
servatives a 5–4 majority in another capital punishment case. The issue 
here was whether a defendant could be sentenced to death where 
the mitigating factors and aggravating factors were of equal weight. A 
Kansas law said yes. The question before the high court was whether 
this law was unconstitutional. As a result of Kennedy’s swing vote, the 
court upheld the Kansas law.
 
✓ Kennedy wrote for the 5–4 liberal majority in the 2008 case Kennedy v. 
Louisiana, which ruled that state laws imposing the death penalty for 
child rape are unconstitutional. In crimes against individuals, Kennedy 
held, “the death penalty should not be expanded to instances where the 
victim’s life was not taken.”
 
✓ The very next day after handing down this liberal ruling, Kennedy gave 
a 5–4 victory to the conservative wing of the court in the important gun-
rights case District of Columbia v. Heller (see Chapter 15).
 
✓ In yet another historic case decided in 2008, Boumediene v. Bush, 
Kennedy wrote for the liberal 5–4 majority that he had created, ruling 
that foreign detainees at Guantanamo Bay had the right to challenge 
their detention according to the principles of habeas corpus under the 
U.S. Constitution.
 
✓ Kennedy also gave a 5–4 victory to the more liberal wing of the court 
in the highly contentious 2005 case of Kelo v. City of New London about 
“eminent domain” under the Fifth and Fourteenth amendments. I discuss 
this case in Chapter 23.
These examples are merely a selection of some of the important cases whose 
outcome has been determined by Justice Kennedy’s views. I pick on him only 
because he has managed to place himself in a pivotal position on the current 
court.
Can it be right that a single unelected judge should have this kind of power? 
Since John Kennedy’s election to the presidency, there has been much specu-
lation about the power of the Kennedy clan. But in fact Justice Kennedy — no 
relation to the former president — has for well over 20 years exercised more 
power and influence than all the members of the Kennedy clan put together, 
and can probably expect to do so for many more years to come.
The reason for this concentration of power in the hands of a single judge is 
twofold:
 
✓ The tremendous power wielded by the U.S. Supreme Court, in particular 
in regard to judicial review
 
✓ The absence of any agreed-upon approach to constitutional interpreta-
tion, resulting in the division of the court into two opposed ideological 
blocs

175
 Chapter 12: “During Good Behaviour”: The Judicial System 
 
If the members of the high court could agree on a common approach to the 
Constitution, the amount of power possessed by the court as an institution 
would be less frightening than it is now, where all that power can often be con-
trolled by just one person.
Chief Justice Roberts clearly recognizes this problem, because he has made 
it a priority to promote unanimity and collegiality on the court — but so far 
to no effect. On the contrary, the disagreements on the court appear more 
acrimonious than ever, and there is no solution in sight.
Labeling Supreme Court Justices
Supreme Court justices can be classified in a number of different ways, which 
can sometimes cut across one another. Following are discussions of the basic 
divisions.
Conservative/liberal
Political conservatives generally favor states’ rights over federal power. But 
when it comes to individual rights, the position is less clear. Liberals tend to 
favor women’s rights, gay rights, and affirmative action, which conservatives 
largely oppose. But conservatives tend to be more libertarian than liberals — 
in the sense of favoring small government, low taxes, and generally allowing 
individuals to live their lives with as little interference from government as 
possible. Liberals, by contrast, are more likely to favor big government, wel-
fare programs, and government involvement in healthcare and other facets of 
life in the interests of what they see as socially desirable goals.
Political conservatives are much more likely than liberals to support indi-
vidual gun rights, while liberals are more likely to support gun control. That 
dichotomy is well illustrated by the Supreme Court’s 2008 decision on the 
Second Amendment, District of Columbia v.Heller, which I discuss in Chapter 
15. In that case, the lineup of liberal justices — Stevens, Breyer, Souter, and 
Ginsburg — faced the conservative lineup — Scalia, Roberts, Thomas, and 
Alito — together with swing-vote Justice Anthony Kennedy. But the justices 
don’t always line up so predictably.
Strict constructionism/living Constitution
Politically conservative justices are more likely to adopt a conservative 
approach to constitutional interpretation by seeking to get back to the origi-
nal meaning of the Constitution — originalism — or by sticking closely to the 

176
Part III: Balancing the Branches of Government 
meaning of the text — textualism. Both approaches are commonly lumped 
together under the label of strict constructionism. Justices who reject this 
approach view the Constitution as a living and growing organism that must 
be interpreted in accordance with social change and with “the evolving stan-
dards of decency.” Strict constructionists retort that judges who support the 
“living Constitution” doctrine are guilty of judicial activism (which I discuss 
momentarily).
Stare decisis/free exercise of power
Stare decisis, or the doctrine of precedent, means that judges are expected to 
follow previous decisions on the same legal issues. The U.S. Supreme Court 
pays lip service to this ancient doctrine but is not formally bound by it and 
has, in fact, overruled its own decisions in well over 100 cases in the past 
half-century. In general, stare decisis is a conservative doctrine — both politi-
cally and judicially conservative.
But what is a strict constructionist judge to do when his own view of what 
the Constitution means is contradicted by a longstanding high court prec-
edent? Does he go with his own view of what the text of the Constitution 
means, or does he follow the precedent, even though he thinks it’s wrong? 
Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas — both conservatives — differ 
in this respect. As Scalia put it, Thomas “doesn’t believe in stare decisis, 
period. If a constitutional line of authority is wrong, he would say let’s get it 
right. I wouldn’t do that.”
What about believers in a “living Constitution”? Such justices wouldn’t regard 
it as a big deal to break with precedent when they thought it was wrong. For 
example, in Brown v. Board of Education, decided in 1954, the liberal-dominated 
Supreme Court under Chief Justice Earl Warren had no trouble departing from 
the 1896 high court ruling in Plessy v. Ferguson, which had accepted racial 
segregation.
Judicial activism/judicial restraint
The term judicial activism is almost always used as a derogatory or negative 
label to refer to the exercise of judicial power that goes beyond its proper 
limits. Judges pilloried by critics as guilty of judicial activism are typically 
accused of
 
✓ Making law instead of applying and interpreting it
 
✓ Legislating from the bench
 
✓ Ruling by the whim of the gavel
 
✓ Deciding cases on the basis of their own political predilections

177
 Chapter 12: “During Good Behaviour”: The Judicial System 
Nobody ever claims to be a judicial activist. This label is pinned on judges 
by their critics — including other judges. Chief Justice William Rehnquist 
expressed himself anxious “to prevent judges from roaming at large in the 
constitutional field guided only by their personal views.” By what, then, should 
judges be guided? Rehnquist opined, “It is impossible to build sound consti-
tutional doctrine upon a mistaken understanding of constitutional history.”
Justice Harry Blackmun is a likely candidate for consideration as a judicial 
activist. In 1972, he dissented in Furman v. Georgia, which declared the capi-
tal punishment laws of a number of states to be unconstitutional. Blackmun 
specifically rejected the majority opinion on the ground that it was an exer-
cise in judicial activism. However, in subsequent cases Blackmun himself 
came out against the constitutionality of the death penalty. And Blackmun 
also was the author of the majority opinion in Roe v. Wade, the highly conten-
tious 1973 abortion rights case, which has often been characterized by its 
opponents as a prime example of judicial activism.
Judicial restraint is the opposite of judicial activism and refers to the doctrine 
that the judiciary should show due deference to the elected branches of 
government and, in particular, should be slow to strike down laws as uncon-
stitutional. Judicial restraint is a judicially conservative doctrine and is often 
associated with political conservatives as well. Chief Justice Roberts, a con-
servative, has identified himself with judicial restraint, saying “Judges are like 
umpires. Umpires don’t make the rules; they apply them.”
Judicial restraint can also restrict the scope of the subject matter that the high 
court is prepared to accept as falling within its purview. For example, in 1964 
Justice John M. Harlan II, attacked what he called
a current mistaken view of the Constitution and the constitutional function 
of this court. This view, in short, is that every major social ill in this country 
can find its cure in some constitutional principle and that this court should 
take the lead in promoting reform when other branches of government 
fail to act. The Constitution is not a panacea for every blot upon the public 
welfare nor should this court, ordained as a judicial body, be thought of as a 
general haven of reform movements.
Harlan is generally regarded as a conservative. But liberals also lay claim to 
judicial restraint. For example, Justice John Paul Stevens, widely regarded 
as the most liberal member of the present-day court, has also claimed to be 
an adherent of judicial restraint. In 1983, he declared that a policy of judicial 
restraint “enables this Court to make its most effective contribution to our 
federal system of government.”

Impeachment Process
In This Chapter
▶ Separating impeachment from criminal prosecution
▶ Following the process through Congress
▶ Exploring historic cases
▶ Removing state officials
T
he key to democracy is people power. And the most important power the 
people have is to hire and fire their own government. This is normally 
done by means of elections, but there is a problem here: Presidential elec-
tions are held only every four years. Does this mean that a president can’t 
be fired between elections? No. The Framers of the Constitution took care of 
that. They wrote into the Constitution an alternative way of getting rid of a 
president: impeachment.
This chapter looks at what impeachment is, who can be impeached, and how 
the process works. I also discuss another method for removing an unwanted 
politician from office: recalling a state governor.
There’s Nothing Peachy 
about Impeachment
Election campaigns have something of a carnival atmosphere about them, 
accompanied as they are by hoopla, wild rallies, and raucous music. 
Impeachment has its own brand of exuberance but more in the nature of 
a lynching. A president who fails to be reelected is just a loser in the high-
stakes game of politics and can come back to run again. (Grover Cleveland 
did so successfully in 1892.) But a president who lost his job as a result of 
impeachment would be finished. He would be also probably be barred from 
running for any federal office again, and his name would be mud forever. That 
has never happened, but there have been a couple of near misses.

180
Part III: Balancing the Branches of Government 
Impeachment is nothing like an election; it’s really a trial. Most people think 
of impeachment as a peculiar form of torture reserved for presidents. Not 
so. The Constitution says that impeachment can be used to remove the 
President, Vice President, or any other “civil Officers of the United States.” 
(Note that members of the armed services cannot be impeached. However, 
they can be removed by court martial.)
Only two Presidents have been impeached, and both were acquitted. These 
were Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1999. (I devote a section 
to each later in this chapter.) Many people think that Richard Nixon was 
impeached too, but he wasn’t. He jumped before he could be pushed; he 
was the only President in history to resign. (More on this topic later in the 
chapter as well.) Another 14 federal office-holders have been impeached, 7 
of them successfully. All 14 were federal judges, and all were removed from 
office. Their names are not well-known, even though three of these impeach-
ments took place less than 20 years ago.
“High Crimes and Misdemeanors”: 
What Impeachment Is and Isn’t
The Constitution is a pretty short document, yet it contains no fewer than 
seven mentions of impeachment. Article II, Section 4 states:
The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall 
be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, 
Bribery, or other High Crimes and Misdemeanors.
Following are a few other mentions of impeachment:
 
✓ Article I, Section 2, Clause 5: “The House of Representatives . . . shall 
have the sole Power of Impeachment.”
 
✓ Article I, Section 3, Clause 6: “The Senate shall have the sole Power to 
try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on 
Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the 
Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the 
Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present.”
 
✓ Article I, Section 3, Clause 7: “Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall 
not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to 
hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United 
States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject 
to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.”

181
 Chapter 13: You’re Fired! Investigating the Impeachment Process 
Defining impeachment
Despite the impressive rolling phrases, these provisions raise more ques-
tions than they answer. For example,
 
✓ Is impeachment a purely political offense?
 
✓ Can you be impeached for something that isn’t a crime?
 
✓ If you’re impeached for something that is a crime, and then you’re pros-
ecuted for that crime, isn’t that double jeopardy?
Congress has never tried to second-guess the Framers of the Constitution 
by defining impeachment — not officially, anyway. But maybe Congressman 
(later President) Gerald Ford’s 1970 definition isn’t so far from the mark (and 
he wasn’t walking and chewing gum when he delivered this pearl of wisdom):
What, then, is an impeachable offense? The only honest answer is that an 
impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives 
considers it to be at a given moment in history; conviction results from 
whatever offense or offenses two-thirds of the other body [i.e. the Senate] 
considers to be sufficiently serious to require removal of the accused from 
office. . . . There are few fixed principles among the handful of precedents.
Can you be impeached for something 
that isn’t a crime at all?
Not one of the 11 articles of impeachment hurled at Andrew Johnson by 
his accusers amounted to a crime under the ordinary law. But that doesn’t 
necessarily mean that Johnson’s enemies were wrong; the Constitution itself 
seems to support the view that “high crimes and misdemeanors” don’t neces-
sarily have to be crimes in the ordinary sense.
To arrive at this conclusion, we need to consider what the Constitution has 
to say about the punishment for impeachable offenses. Article I, Section 3, 
Clause 7 says that the only punishment for impeachment is removal from office 
and disqualification to hold office in the future. That’s a pretty stiff penalty in 
anybody’s language, but it’s not the end of the story. The same clause says that 
even if you’ve been convicted on impeachment, you will still “be liable and sub-
ject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment, and Punishment, according to Law.”
In other words, if the offense that leads to impeachment also involves break-
ing a law, the person under the microscope can be both impeached and 
prosecuted. After being impeached, tried, found guilty, and deprived of office 
(by Congress), that person can still be hauled up before a judge and jury and 
maybe do some jail time.

182
Part III: Balancing the Branches of Government 
How many times can someone be punished for the same thing? After all, 
being punished twice for the same thing just isn’t allowed — that’s called 
double jeopardy and is strictly forbidden by the Fifth Amendment (see 
Chapter 17).
 
The point is that being impeached is not the same thing as being punished 
under the law. That’s why double jeopardy doesn’t apply. With this under-
standing in mind, we can deduce that the Framers of the Constitution distin-
guished between impeachable offenses and illegal behaviors. It’s certainly 
possible that one action can be both impeachable and illegal, but it’s also 
possible that an action can be impeachable without being illegal.
What would qualify someone for impeachment without being illegal? See the 
sections on Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton later in this chapter for the two 
prime examples in U.S. history. And consider what Alexander Hamilton wrote 
about impeachment in the Federalist Papers, an influential series of 85 articles 
written by Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay in 1787 and 1788 advocat-
ing the ratification of the newly drafted Constitution:
The subjects of its jurisdiction are those offenses which proceed from the 
misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of 
some public trust. They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be 
denominated POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately 
to the society itself.
Not bad for a description written before the Constitution even came into 
effect!
Tracking the Impeachment Process
The Constitution says that “The House of Representatives shall have the sole 
Power of Impeachment.” But it doesn’t specify how the House shall use that 
power. Does that mean that the procedure is fluid and can change any time 
the House likes? Yes and no.
On the one hand, the basic procedure is hundreds of years older than the 
U.S. Constitution. The House’s role derives from that of the British House 
of Commons, which used to prosecute impeachments before the House 
of Lords, and the Lords’ function as a trial jury has come down to the U.S. 
Senate. On the other hand, both the House of Representatives and the Senate 
have their own detailed “Rules of Procedure and Practice,” which change 
from time to time. The Senate revised its rules in 1974 after Watergate. The 
current version of the Senate rules dates from 1986.

183
 Chapter 13: You’re Fired! Investigating the Impeachment Process 
Playing grand jury and prosecutor: 
The role of the House
Any member of the House can propose an impeachment resolution, and in 
fact the initial complaint can even come from outside Congress. President 
Clinton’s impeachment, for example, was set in motion by Independent 
Counsel Ken Starr, who dumped 36 boxes of evidence on the House, together 
with a 453-page report citing 11 possible impeachable offenses allegedly com-
mitted by the President.
As with most things in the House, the Rules Committee gets to see any 
impeachment proposal first. From there, the proposal generally goes to the 
House Judiciary Committee, which may conduct its own hearings. (I explain 
these committees in Chapter 11.)
In the Clinton impeachment, the full House voted 258–176 to authorize a full 
impeachment inquiry. The Judiciary Committee then began holding televised 
hearings. The Committee drafted four articles of impeachment, all of which it 
approved essentially along party lines. The first three articles alleged perjury 
and obstruction of justice in regard to Paula Jones, a woman who had accused 
the President of sexual harassment, and in connection with his relationship 
with intern Monica Lewinsky. The fourth and last article of impeachment 
alleged that Clinton had “misused and abused his office by making perjurious, 
false and misleading statements to Congress.”
The next stage is for the articles of impeachment to return to the full House 
for a debate, possibly in closed session, followed by a vote on whether to 
impeach or not to impeach. In the Clinton case, two of the four articles were 
passed by the full House. (The fourth article was rejected by a whopping 
285–148.)
The impeachment process doesn’t end here — the Senate must then try the 
case and decide whether to convict, as I explain in the next section. However, 
if the House approves one or more articles of impeachment, the person is 
officially “impeached.”
 
The role of the House in impeachments is as the prosecutor. At first it acts as 
a grand jury, deciding whether the case should go to trial. Then, if it decides 
that the case should move forward, the House appoints managers to act as 
prosecuting counsel at the trial. (In the Clinton impeachment, 13 Republican 
members of the House Judiciary Committee served as managers under the 
chairmanship of Representative Henry Hyde of Illinois.)

184
Part III: Balancing the Branches of Government 
Trying the articles of impeachment: 
The role of the Senate
 
After passing the House, an impeachment is ready for trial by the Senate. The 
Senate acts as the trial jury but, unlike a jury, has the freedom to ask ques-
tions and debate the issues. The Senate hears all the legal arguments and evi-
dence and then decides the outcome by a roll-call vote. A simple majority vote 
cannot convict; the Constitution states that a two-thirds vote is required.
The trial process can take weeks or even months. Andrew Johnson’s trial 
in 1868 took almost three months, but Clinton’s in 1999 took only about 
five weeks. In the Clinton case no live witnesses were called, but videotape 
evidence was presented. In both the Johnson and Clinton trials there was 
a majority vote for impeachment, but both of them got off — Johnson by a 
single vote — because the prosecutors failed to convince a two-thirds major-
ity, as is needed for conviction.
The Framers of the Constitution were careful to appoint the Chief Justice of 
the U.S. Supreme Court to preside over an impeachment when the President 
is on trial. All other impeachment trials of lesser officials are presided over 
by the Vice President, who is the president of the Senate. (In practice, the 
president pro tempore — the highest-ranking senator — or a deputy will often 
preside.) The Vice President couldn’t very well be allowed to preside over 
the impeachment trial of the President because he’d have a conflict of inter-
est: The conviction of the President would turn the presidency over to the 
Vice President!
Understanding the Implications 
of Impeachment
Impeachment is one of the sexiest aspects of the Constitution. It’s a fun thing — 
except of course for the person being impeached. And when it happens to a 
president, everybody has an opinion. But there are a lot of misconceptions 
about it too.
Impeaching isn’t the same as convicting
The words “impeach” and “impeachment” sound pretty bad. When we hear 
“A.B. was impeached,” this seems to imply that he was found guilty of some-
thing. In fact, all it means is that A.B. was formally charged and tried. It says 
nothing about the outcome, which would either be a conviction (a guilty ver-
dict) or an acquittal (a not guilty verdict).

185
 Chapter 13: You’re Fired! Investigating the Impeachment Process 
 
It’s quite correct to say that Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton were impeached, 
though both were acquitted. That’s why the Constitution uses the clumsy 
phrase “impeachment for, and conviction of . . .” — because impeachment and 
conviction are two different things.
Keeping Congress out of the fray
According to the Constitution, any “civil officer of the United States” can be 
impeached. But what exactly is a civil officer? Does the term include mem-
bers of Congress? This question was put to the test early in U.S. history.
In 1797, Senator William Blount of Tennessee was impeached by the House 
of Representatives. The Senate decided that it didn’t have the right under 
the Constitution to try him. The arguments by which it reached that conclu-
sion were far from clear, but the gist may have been that senators are not 
regarded as “civil officers of the United States” who alone are subject to 
impeachment.
An important practical consideration was the fact that Blount had already 
been expelled from the Senate for being guilty of a “high misdemeanor” 
inconsistent with his duty as a senator. (This decision was based on Blount’s 
involvement in a military conspiracy to take Florida and Louisiana from Spain 
and hand them over to Britain.)
So does this mean that a person can escape impeachment if he is no longer 
a “civil officer” at the time? The punishment laid down for impeachment by 
Article I, Section 3, Clause 7 is not only removal from office but also “dis-
qualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the 
United States.” This language seems to indicate that even somebody who is 
no longer in office can be impeached because, if found guilty, he can still be 
disqualified from holding office in the future. But in practice, after a person 
has jumped ship it is most unlikely that he will still be pursued for impeach-
ment. (Richard Nixon is a good example of this fact, as I discuss in a sidebar 
in this chapter.)
No member of Congress has been impeached since Blount, and it’s unlikely 
that any ever will be.
Impeaching for poor private conduct
The Constitution doesn’t specify whether someone can be impeached only 
for acts carried out in his or her official capacity. In 1881, a Minnesota judge 
was removed from office in a state impeachment for being found guilty of 
“frequenting bawdy houses and consorting with harlots.” The question of 
whether private conduct can be the basis of an impeachment is still very 
much a live issue, as President Clinton’s case proves.

186
Part III: Balancing the Branches of Government 
The Constitution allows for impeachment in cases of treason and bribery, 
which seems clear enough. But it also allows impeachment for “High Crimes 
and Misdemeanors” — a strange combination. “High Crimes” sounds solemn 
and serious, but “Misdemeanors” usually refers to pretty insignificant 
offenses like jaywalking. Presumably, we need to read this phrase to mean 
“High Crimes and High Misdemeanors.” But a “High Misdemeanor” sounds 
like a contradiction in terms, something like “grand jaywalking” or “aggra-
vated jaywalking.” Or maybe “Misdemeanor” here refers to something that is 
not really a crime at all but essentially means “misconduct.”
 
The phrase “High Crimes and Misdemeanors” found its way into the 
Constitution as the result of compromise. George Mason, one of the delegates 
to the Constitutional Convention, wanted to include “maladministration” as 
a ground for impeachment, but James Madison felt that this word was too 
vague. Mason then came up with “High Crimes and Misdemeanors” to cover 
what he called “attempts to subvert the Constitution.”
“High Crimes and Misdemeanors,” then, seems to be a formula to represent 
political rather than purely legal offenses. This interpretation agrees with 
Alexander Hamilton’s view of impeachment that I quote earlier in the chap-
ter. Andrew Johnson’s impeachment falls into this category. As I explain in a 
moment, his real crime was that he wasn’t Abraham Lincoln, and he opposed 
everything (except the Union) that Lincoln stood for.
Pardoning is not an option
Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution gives the President a general “Power 
to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except 
in Cases of Impeachment.” This wording is another recognition of the special 
(political) nature of impeachment.
Didn’t Richard Nixon get a presidential pardon from his successor, Gerald 
Ford? Yes. But keep in mind that Nixon wasn’t impeached; he quit. The 
pardon protected Nixon from any criminal charges or civil lawsuits in the 
ordinary courts but had nothing to do with impeachment.
Impeachment in Action: Johnson, 
the Judges, and Clinton
Impeachment is a British invention, but it hasn’t been used there for more 
than two centuries because it was perceived as essentially political. Plus, it 
was very time-consuming. The celebrated trial of Warren Hastings on corrup-
tion charges lasted seven years (from 1788 to 1795), took up 145 sittings of 
the House of Lords, and resulted in a unanimous acquittal on all charges!

187
 Chapter 13: You’re Fired! Investigating the Impeachment Process 
 
Similar issues hover over U.S. impeachments. As I explain here, Andrew 
Johnson’s impeachment was clearly politically motivated — as was Bill 
Clinton’s. Clinton’s sexual exploits and his alleged perjury should have been 
dealt with through the ordinary courts. Impeachment is a valuable constitu-
tional tool and should not be misused.
Andrew Johnson: “Let them 
impeach and be damned”
“His faith in the people never wavered” reads the epitaph on Andrew 
Johnson’s grave in Greenville, Tennessee. History mostly remembers the 
seventeenth President differently. If he’s remembered at all, it’s for being the 
first President to be impeached.
Abraham Lincoln was assassinated in 1865 only six days after the end of the 
Civil War and six weeks after his second inauguration. He was succeeded by 
his Vice President, Andrew Johnson, a pro-slavery southerner who was not 
even a member of Lincoln’s Republican Party; he was a Democrat.
Not only was Johnson not a Republican; he had a visceral hatred of the 
Republican Party and all it stood for (except the Union, which he supported 
passionately). After he was installed as President, he was determined to put 
his own political program into effect. A clash with Congress loomed large on 
the horizon from the moment he took the Presidential oath of office. When 
Johnson vetoed the Civil Rights Bill granting citizenship to blacks, Congress 
not only overrode his veto but also went on to propose the Fourteenth 
Amendment to the Constitution guaranteeing “due process” and “equal pro-
tection of the laws” to all.
Johnson loudly opposed the amendment and, in the 1866 midterm elections, 
campaigned for conservative Democrats who felt the same way he did. But 
his efforts backfired badly, especially when he likened himself to Jesus Christ 
and claimed that the divine purpose behind Lincoln’s assassination was to 
make Andrew Johnson the President.
The President’s trial before the Senate — the first in U.S. history — was the 
high point of the Washington social season. It was open to the public, and 
tickets were in great demand. Scalpers had a field day! After a rather boring, 
technical trial lasting almost three months, the Senate voted 35–19 against the 
President. Though this was a majority, it was just one vote short of the two-
thirds majority required for conviction and removal from office. So Andrew 
Johnson was saved by the skin of his teeth to serve out the rest of his term.
 
What were the “High Crimes and Misdemeanors” for which Andrew Johnson 
was impeached? The source of his problem was the Tenure of Office Act, 
which made it unlawful for the President to remove any member of his own 
Cabinet without the approval of the Senate. Johnson believed that this law 

188
Part III: Balancing the Branches of Government 
was unconstitutional, so he ignored it and dismissed his Secretary of War 
anyway. (History has proven him right: In Myers v United States, the U.S. 
Supreme Court declared the Tenure of Office Act unconstitutional. But that 
was in 1926 — a bit too late to help Johnson!)
Johnson’s impeachment was really a power struggle between the President 
and Congress. His main accuser told the House of Representatives that 
“Andrew Johnson must learn he is your servant and that as Congress 
shall order he must obey.” This same Congressman also referred to the 
Constitution as “a worthless bit of old parchment.” (The Constitution, based 
as it is on the concept of the separation of powers, makes it clear that the 
President is not subordinate to Congress any more than Congress is subordi-
nate to the President. For more on the separation of powers see Chapter 8.)
If Johnson had been convicted, not only would he have been out of a job, but 
every President after him would have been the servant of Congress.
Judging the judges
Thomas Jefferson called impeachment a “scarecrow” because the threat of 
impeachment is often enough to deter an official from pursuing an unaccept-
able course of conduct. But in some cases the threat of impeachment isn’t 
enough: It’s necessary to initiate an impeachment prosecution. Judges are 
the officials who are most likely to face impeachment proceedings. A total of 
14 federal judges have been impeached, and 7 of them were found guilty and 
removed from office.
The most recent of these cases was Judge Walter Nixon (no relation to the 
former President), who was impeached in 1989 for committing perjury before 
a grand jury. He was convicted by the Senate and removed from office. 
This impeachment, which was based on perjury, served as a precedent for 
impeaching President Clinton in 1999.
Bill Clinton: “I did not have 
sexual relations . . .”
Like Andrew Johnson more than a century earlier, President Clinton was 
impeached but not fired — there were not enough votes in the Senate to con-
vict him. Unlike all previous impeachments, Clinton’s case arose out of his 
sex life.

189
 Chapter 13: You’re Fired! Investigating the Impeachment Process 
Richard Nixon: Close, but no impeachment
Some people are under the impression that 
Richard Nixon was impeached. He wasn’t. Instead, 
he resigned — the only U.S. President ever to do 
so. But did he jump before being pushed?
Nixon remains one of the most controversial 
and enigmatic figures in U.S. history. He first 
made his name as a right-wing Republican 
political “gut fighter,” as he called himself, 
dedicated to exposing politicians and govern-
ment officials who were “soft on communism.” 
After serving as a congressman and then briefly 
in the Senate, Nixon was picked as Dwight D. 
Eisenhower’s running mate in 1952 and again 
in 1956. Two landslide victories and eight years 
as Vice President made Nixon a shoo-in for the 
Republican nomination for President in 1960. He 
lost to John Kennedy in one of the closest and 
most questionable elections ever.
Nixon’s presidential moment eventually came in 
1968, and he was reelected in 1972 by more than 
60 percent of the popular vote. Yet it was in the 
run-up to this election that the fateful Watergate 
break-in took place. The aptly named CREEP 
(Committee to RE-Elect the President) hired a 
band of “plumbers,” as they were referred to, 
to bug the offices of the Democratic National 
Committee in Washington’s Watergate building. 
An address book left on the scene by one of the 
“plumbers” pointed to a White House connec-
tion. Was Nixon privy to this burglary? He always 
steadfastly denied it. But, even if he only found out 
about it afterward, was he involved in the cover-
up? This question opened up a can of worms, or, 
to be more precise, hundreds of cans of audio-
tapes containing voice-activated recordings of 
every conversation that had ever taken place in 
the oval office throughout the Nixon presidency.
Claiming executive privilege, Nixon refused to 
hand the tapes over to the special prosecutor 
appointed by the Senate. Nixon then ordered his 
Attorney General to fire the special prosecutor, 
Archibald Cox, but the Attorney General refused 
to do so and was therefore himself obliged to 
resign. The Deputy Attorney General followed 
suit. The President’s instruction was passed 
down to the Solicitor General, Robert Bork, who 
duly fired Cox in what came to be known as the 
“Saturday Night Massacre.”
When the House of Representatives started 
moving toward impeachment, Nixon surrendered 
some of the tapes, but they turned out to have 
been edited. One of the tapes contained a 1972 
conversation in which Nixon told the FBI to butt 
out of investigating the Watergate burglary, as 
this was a “national security” operation. Did this 
instruction amount to an obstruction of justice?
A new special prosecutor appointed by the 
Senate called for more of the tapes. Nixon 
again refused to disclose them on the basis of 
“executive privilege.” In July 1974 the Supreme 
Court decided against the President. The House 
Judiciary Committee then voted to recommend 
that Nixon be impeached on three counts, alleg-
ing obstruction of justice, abuse of executive 
power, and failure to comply with Congressional 
demands for the tapes.
Nixon was not prepared to take a chance on the 
outcome of an impeachment. He resigned, and 
a month later he was granted a full presiden-
tial pardon by Gerald Ford. Since he had never 
been formally charged, the pardon was a broad 
one rather than for specific offenses.
Was Nixon involved in the Watergate break-in? 
We’ll never know for sure. It may seem strange 
that he felt the need to bug the Democratic 
Party’s offices in the run-up to an election that, 
as it turned out, he won by a landslide. Nixon 
always felt insecure and constantly under 
threat, which made him extremely suspicious 
and in general very cautious — so cautious 
that (if he was directly involved in the break-
in) it impelled him into a senseless rash act 
that brought him down. As he said in an inter-
view given to David Frost a few years later, “I 
brought myself down. I gave them a sword and 
they stuck it in. And they twisted it with relish.”

190
Part III: Balancing the Branches of Government 
It all started with a federal lawsuit filed against the President by Paula Jones 
in 1994. Her story was that back in 1991 when Clinton was governor of 
Arkansas and Jones was an Arkansas state employee, she was approached 
by a state trooper bearing a note reading “The Governor would like to meet 
with you in Suite no. XXXX.” Jones claimed she had never met or spoken to 
Clinton before and had no idea what the note was all about. When asked, 
the state trooper said, “It’s okay. We do this all the time for the Governor.” 
Reassured by this response, Jones allowed the state trooper to escort her 
to Clinton’s hotel suite. After a few flattering remarks about her hair and her 
figure, she claimed, he exposed his erect penis and invited her to “kiss it.” 
According to her testimony, she recoiled in horror and left. Paula Jones sued 
Bill Clinton for $700,000 for sexual discrimination in his alleged unwanted 
advances and subsequent unfair treatment of her as a state employee.
Was it right for a President to have to face a lawsuit like this while still in 
office? Clinton’s lawyers argued that it was unconstitutional. But the U.S. 
Supreme Court, after putting the lawsuit on hold till after the 1996 election, 
allowed it to go ahead. Clinton eventually got Jones to drop her suit by 
paying her $850,000 but without issuing any apology or admission of guilt or 
legal liability.
 
So ended the Paula Jones saga — or so we thought. The problem was Clinton’s 
videotaped deposition in the Paula Jones case. It was the first time that a sit-
ting President had ever been required to give evidence as a defendant. It was 
here that Clinton came out with the remark “I have never had sexual relations 
with Monica Lewinsky” in sworn testimony. (He later repeated that claim in a 
slightly paraphrased form that became notorious.)
This comment, which was later proven to be untrue and therefore perjuri-
ous, enabled Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr to expand his investigation 
of the President (originally confined to the Whitewater real estate venture in 
Arkansas) to include Clinton’s sex life and, in particular, his relationship with 
White House intern Monica Lewinsky. This investigation led directly to his 
impeachment.
How could the President’s sexual conduct in private possibly amount to 
“High Crimes and Misdemeanors”? Clinton’s supporters pooh-poohed the 
whole thing as too trivial for impeachment. But his critics made the point 
that if he lied under oath, how could you trust him as a leader?
Clinton was confronted with two charges:
 
✓ Perjury, on the ground that the President had lied under oath during the 
Paula Jones case before Kenneth Starr’s grand jury.
 
✓ Obstruction of justice, on the ground that the President tried to hide 
some evidence relating to the same case.

191
 Chapter 13: You’re Fired! Investigating the Impeachment Process 
On Article I, the vote in the Senate was 55 for acquittal and only 45 for con-
viction. On Article II, the Senate was split 50–50. A two-thirds majority was 
needed for conviction, so the impeachment managers were 17 votes short 
of a firing squad. Bill Clinton remained in office and left with a 65 percent 
approval rating — the highest of any retiring President since Dwight D. 
Eisenhower.
Removing State Officials from Office
Impeachment is not confined to federal officials. It applies equally to state 
officials in 49 of the 50 states. The one exception is Oregon, where “public 
officers” charged with “incompetence, corruption, malfeasance, or delin-
quency in office” are tried in the ordinary courts, which have the power 
to strip them of their office as well as to punish them in other ways. In the 
remaining 49 states, impeachment is a possibility, though the form it takes 
may differ slightly from the federal model.
 
Many state constitutions mirror the language of the U.S. Constitution, but the 
language is varied. There is a procession of “malfeasance,” “malpractice,” 
“misconduct,” and even the vague term opposed by James Madison, “malad-
ministration.” Four states cite “moral turpitude” or “moral turpitude in office” 
as grounds for impeachment. (Had this language been in the U.S. Constitution, 
would President Clinton have been fired?)
Courting justice for Supreme Court justices
Richard Nixon was not the only public figure 
who jumped before he could be pushed (see 
the other sidebar in this chapter). Justice Abe 
Fortas, appointed to the Supreme Court bench 
by President Lyndon Johnson, was hounded by 
the media after accepting $20,000 for becoming 
a consultant to a charitable foundation headed 
up by a former client. Johnson, himself embat-
tled over Vietnam, had already announced that 
he would not be seeking reelection. As a lame-
duck President he could do nothing to help 
his longtime friend. In 1969, with the threat of 
impeachment hanging over his head, Abe Fortas 
resigned from the Supreme Court in disgrace.
Several Supreme Court justices have been 
confronted with calls for their impeachment, 
notably Chief Justice Earl Warren and Justice 
William O. Douglas. In Douglas’s case a reso-
lution calling for his impeachment was spon-
sored by 110 congressmen and introduced into 
the House of Representatives in 1970 by (future 
President) Gerald Ford. But that is as far as it 
got. The only Supreme Court Justice who was 
ever actually impeached was Samuel Chase, 
back in 1805 — and he was acquitted.

192
Part III: Balancing the Branches of Government 
Impeaching governors
Governors are the equivalent of the President at the state level, so they are 
liable to impeachment. Twelve state governors have been impeached over 
the years. Eight were convicted and removed from office, and one resigned.
In 2008, Governor Eliot Spitzer of New York resigned in the face of impeach-
ment threats arising out of a scandal involving a prostitute. In 2009, Governor 
Rod Blagojevich of Illinois was impeached for allegedly trying to sell the Senate 
seat vacated by President Obama. His whirlwind impeachment trial before the 
Illinois State Senate ended with a unanimous 59–0 vote against him. He was 
immediately removed from office and disqualified from ever again holding any 
“office of honor or trust” in Illinois. Blagojevich’s impeachment conviction did 
not exempt him from facing criminal charges in a regular criminal court.
Total recall, or terminating a governor
Some states have devised an even more ingenious way of ridding themselves 
of elected public officials between elections: recall. The best-known example 
of a recall occurred in California in 2003, when Governor Gray Davis, who had 
been reelected for a second term only the previous year, was recalled and 
replaced by Arnold Schwarzenegger.
 
Recall has been available to Californians since 1911. To set the process in 
motion requires the signatures of 12 percent of the number of votes cast in the 
previous election. In the 2003 case this meant that the signatures of 897,158 
registered California voters were needed!
A recall election ballot has two parts:
 
✓ In the first part you vote “Yes” or “No” to recall the incumbent.
 
✓ If “Yes” wins, there is a second round, in which you select the replace-
ment candidate of your choice.
It’s pretty easy to get on the ballot. All you need is 65 nomination signatures 
and a $3,500 filing fee.
In the 2003 California recall ballot, there was a 55.3 percent vote to recall 
Gray Davis, with Arnie taking 48.7 percent of the vote in part two, a remark-
able feat considering that there were no fewer than 131 candidates on the 
ballot, 41 of them Republicans!
Without a superstar candidate to galvanize public support, recall elections 
are clearly not the easiest way to remove a governor from office, but they are 
an interesting safety valve. Above all, they are a form of direct democracy.

Part IV
The Bill of Rights: 
Specifying Rights 
through Amendments

In this part . . .
H
ere’s where you get the lowdown on your 
constitutional rights. The Bill of Rights may 
have been an afterthought as far as the Framers of the 
Constitution were concerned, but for most people these 
first ten amendments are crucial. Read all about them 
here.

Chapter 14
The First Amendment: Freedom of 
Religion, Speech, and Assembly
In This Chapter
▶ Establishing freedom of religion
▶ Protecting freedom of speech responsibly
▶ Guarding against obscenity
▶ Protecting freedom of assembly and association
T
he First Amendment forms part of the Bill of Rights — the name we give 
to the first ten amendments. The First Amendment is arguably the most 
important part not only of the Bill of Rights but also of the Constitution as a 
whole because it guarantees some pretty fundamental rights:
 
✓ Freedom of religion and belief
 
✓ Freedom of speech
 
✓ Freedom of the press
 
✓ Freedom of assembly and association
 
✓ Freedom to petition the government
In this chapter, I explain each of these rights and how they’ve been inter-
preted through the years.
Considering the Amendment’s Wording
Here’s what the First Amendment says:
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or 
prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, 
or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to 
petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

196
Part IV: The Bill of Rights: Specifying Rights through Amendments 
Prohibiting Congress from 
taking away rights
 
Notice the unusual wording. The whole amendment is governed by the open-
ing phrase “Congress shall make no law . . .” No other amendment starts that 
way. How come the First Amendment differs from all the other amendments in 
this important respect?
The answer is that in this amendment the Framers were not granting new 
rights to the people. They assumed that those rights already existed. The 
amendment was clearly designed to stop Congress from taking away rights 
that already existed.
Applying the amendment to the states
The opening word of the First Amendment makes it clear that the amendment 
applies only to Congress, which is part of the federal government. There is 
no indication that it applies to the states. Should we conclude that the First 
Amendment doesn’t apply to the states? You may assume that’s the simple, 
logical conclusion. But the U.S. Supreme Court in its wisdom has decided 
otherwise.
As I explain in Chapter 17, the high court has expanded its interpretation of 
the famous Due Process Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment to incorporate 
much of the Bill of Rights — including the First Amendment — and apply 
it to the states. In other words, the high court has ruled that based on the 
Fourteenth Amendment, states must adhere to much of the Bill of Rights, just 
as the federal government does.
 
The First Amendment is considered completely incorporated. That means all 
the rights spelled out in the amendment must apply at the state level, as well 
as at the federal level.
Separating Church and State
The first two clauses of the First Amendment are about religion. The first of 
these clauses — Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of 
religion — is commonly referred to as the Establishment Clause. Let’s break 
down the wording of this clause:

197
 Chapter 14: The First Amendment: Freedom of Religion, Speech, and Assembly 
 
✓ Congress shall make no law: The word shall, even in more modern legal 
documents, means “must.” So “Congress shall make no law respecting 
an establishment of religion” means “Congress must not make any law 
about the establishment of religion.”
 
✓ establishment: In England there was (and still is) an established religion 
and state church, known as the Church of England. Opposition to this 
state church was one of the most important motivating forces leading 
the early settlers to leave England and come to America. A number of 
the colonies replaced the Church of England with their own favored 
brand of Protestantism, and this situation continued after independence. 
The intention of the Establishment Clause was to prevent Congress from 
establishing a national church — and also to stop Congress from inter-
fering with existing state establishments. The only high court justice 
who ever showed any sign of understanding this important latter point 
was the much underrated Justice Potter Stewart (the judicial hero of 
Justice John Paul Stevens).
 
✓ respecting: The phrase “respecting an establishment of religion” just 
means “about an establishment of religion.”
Testing, testing
The high court has formulated the Lemon Test for 
legislation concerned with religious matters — 
named for the 1971 case Lemon v. Kurtzman, in 
which a legal challenge was mounted against 
Pennsylvania and Rhode Island statutes provid-
ing state aid to church-related schools. Chief 
Justice Warren Burger, writing for the majority, 
set out the test in these terms:
 ✓ First, the statute must have a secular legis-
lative purpose;
 ✓ Second, its principal or primary effect must 
be one that neither advances nor inhibits 
religion;
 ✓ Finally, the statute must not foster “an 
excessive government entanglement with 
religion.”
In Lee v. Weisman, heard in 1992, the high court 
supplemented the Lemon test with Justice 
Anthony Kennedy’s “coercion test,” which ruled 
as unconstitutional the giving of a nonsectarian 
benediction by a clergyman at a public school 
graduation ceremony — on the dubious basis 
that this religious feature placed the graduating 
students under subtle religious “coercion.”
Justice Sandra Day O’Connor’s “endorsement 
test” makes it even easier for a law or govern-
ment action to “run afoul” of the Establishment 
Clause. This test asks whether the govern-
ment action in question “conveys a message 
of endorsement or disapproval” of religion — 
either of which is unconstitutional.

198
Part IV: The Bill of Rights: Specifying Rights through Amendments 
If the Establishment Clause was intended to prevent the establishment of any 
official church at either the national or state level, why didn’t it say so? The 
Establishment Clause raises more questions than it answers. Here are some 
of those questions:
 
✓ Is it okay for a state to authorize the recitation of a voluntary, non-
denominational prayer at the start of each school day? The prayer in 
question, introduced by the school district of New Hyde Park, New York, 
read as follows: Almighty God, we acknowledge our dependence upon 
Thee, and we beg Thy blessings upon us, our parents, our teachers, and our 
Country. In the 1962 case Engel v. Vitale, the high court ruled that the use 
of the prayer “breaches the constitutional wall of separation between 
Church and State.” Justice Potter Stewart, in his lone dissent, made 
some trenchant points against this ruling, notably:
 
• The majority placed too much reliance on the phrase “wall of sepa-
ration between Church and State,” quoted from a letter written by 
Thomas Jefferson in 1802 — “a phrase nowhere to be found in the 
Constitution.”
 
• Both houses of Congress open their daily sessions with prayer.
 
• The President’s oath of office ends with “so help me God” (added 
to the official wording in the Constitution by George Washington 
and every one of his successors).
 
• The National Anthem, “The Star-Spangled Banner,” contains the 
verse, “And this be our motto ‘In God is our Trust.’”
 
• “Since 1865, the words ‘IN GOD WE TRUST’ have been impressed 
on our coins.”
 
• Since 1954, the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag has contained the 
words “one nation under God . . .” (Several so-far indecisive legal 
challenges have been launched against this wording.)
 
• The Supreme Court itself starts each day with the invocation by 
the court crier, “God save the United States and this Honorable 
Court.”
 
✓ Is it okay for a state to provide tuition vouchers for use in public or 
private schools, including religiously affiliated schools? In the 2002 
case of Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, the majority on the court said yes — 
provided the vouchers went to parents and not to the schools, and 
provided the parents had a choice of nonreligious as well as religious 
schools.

 Chapter 14: The First Amendment: Freedom of Religion, Speech, and Assembly 
 
✓ Is it okay for the Ten Commandments to be displayed in a courthouse? 
In 2003, the Chief Justice of Alabama, Roy Moore, was fired for refus-
ing to remove a granite monument of the Ten Commandments from the 
central rotunda of the Alabama Judicial Building. Moore’s removal from 
office followed a ruling by a federal District Court declaring that the 
monument violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment 
and was therefore unconstitutional. In 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court 
decided in a 5–4 split that displaying the Ten Commandments on a 
Kentucky courthouse wall violated the First Amendment’s require-
ment of separation between church and state. But a display of the Ten 
Commandments on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol in Austin, 
Texas, was held by the same margin to be permissible!
Guaranteeing the Free 
Exercise of Religion
The second clause of the First Amendment says that [Congress shall make 
no law] prohibiting the free exercise [of religion]. This clause is known as the 
Free Exercise Clause.
In the 1879 case of Reynolds v. United States, the Supreme Court divided the 
exercise of religion into two parts: belief or opinion on the one hand and, on 
the other hand, practice. The court ruled that the law can’t interfere with “mere 
religious beliefs and opinions,” but it may interfere with religious practices.
The Reynolds case was about polygamy, as practiced at that time by some 
Mormons. Could religion be a defense to illegal actions? No, said Chief Justice 
Morrison Waite, writing for the court; otherwise, even religiously based 
human sacrifice would have to be allowed.
Adopting a strict scrutiny test
In the 1963 case Sherbert v. Verner, the Supreme Court adopted a strict scru-
tiny test to determine whether a person’s rights under the Free Exercise 
Clause have been violated. Adell Sherbert was a Seventh Day Adventist 
who was fired from her job because she refused to work on Saturdays. She 
couldn’t find another job, so she applied for unemployment compensa-
tion. But her unemployment claim was denied by the Employment Security 
Commission, by a South Carolina trial court, and by the South Carolina 
Supreme Court. Sherbert’s claim for unemployment compensation eventually 
reached the U.S. Supreme Court.

200
Part IV: The Bill of Rights: Specifying Rights through Amendments 
The high court established the following criteria for the Sherbert Test, as it 
was quickly dubbed:
 
✓ Whether the plaintiff’s religious belief was sincere: Adell Sherbert’s 
religious sincerity was not in doubt.
 
✓ Whether the government action imposed a “substantial burden” on 
the plaintiff’s ability freely to exercise her religion: The Supreme Court 
found that this requirement had been met in the Sherbert case.
If these two criteria are satisfied, then the government has to prove
 
✓ That there was “a compelling state interest” justifying the govern-
ment’s action: In the Sherbert case, no compelling state interest was 
found that denied Adell Sherbert unemployment compensation.
 
✓ That it could not have pursued its compelling interest in a way that 
did not infringe on the plaintiff’s freedom of religion: In the Sherbert 
case, this point didn’t arise.
So Adell Sherbert won her case in the Supreme Court — and in the process 
established a sensible strict scrutiny test that protected the free exercise of 
religion of others.
However, in 1990 the Supreme Court abandoned the need for strict scrutiny 
in cases involving the free exercise of religion. This change meant that free-
dom of religion was no longer accorded the same protection as under the 
Sherbert Test. To restore the Sherbert Test, Congress passed the Religious 
Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) with overwhelming bipartisan support.
 
But RFRA put the high court’s nose out of joint because it looked as though 
Congress was not just enforcing the Constitution but interpreting it — a privi-
lege that the court had long ago arrogated to itself (see Chapter 12). In the 
words of Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the majority on the court, 
“Congress does not enforce a constitutional right by changing what the right 
is.” Come again? Wasn’t it the Supreme Court that changed the test in the first 
place — and, in so doing, changed the right also?
Witnessing judicial gyrations: Jehovah’s 
Witnesses and the Supreme Court
No religious group has been given a rougher rollercoaster ride by the 
Supreme Court than the Jehovah’s Witnesses. As has happened so often in 
the history of the court, it keeps changing its mind.

201
 Chapter 14: The First Amendment: Freedom of Religion, Speech, and Assembly 
In the 1940 case Minersville School District v. Gobitis, Jehovah’s Witnesses 
challenged the right of public schools to compel students to salute the flag 
and recite the Pledge of Allegiance. Justice Felix Frankfurter, writing for the 
majority on the court, ruled against the Jehovah’s Witnesses. He held that 
“the flag is the symbol of the nation’s power, the emblem of freedom in its 
truest, best sense.”
Three years later, the high court changed its mind in West Virginia State 
Board of Education v. Barnette, an almost identical case to Gobitis. During the 
three-year interval, some Jehovah’s Witness children were threatened with 
expulsion from public schools, and a spate of physical attacks on Jehovah’s 
Witnesses occurred. This situation undoubtedly factored into the high court’s 
change of heart — as did a change in the composition of the court itself.
In Barnette, it seemed clear that Jehovah’s Witnesses were not refusing to 
salute the flag because of any lack of patriotism but purely on the basis of a 
deeply-held faith according to which saluting the flag amounted to idolatry. 
In the words of Hugo Black and William O. Douglas, two of the justices who 
changed sides, “Words uttered under coercion are proof of loyalty to nothing 
but self-interest.”
Guaranteeing Freedom of Expression
After religion, the First Amendment turns to freedom of expression. Here are 
the relevant words:
Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the 
press.
Flag burning: Protecting unspoken speech
In the 1989 case of Texas v. Johnson, a 5–4 major-
ity on the court characterized flag burning as 
protected “speech” under the First Amendment. 
Interestingly, the conservative Chief Justice 
William Rehnquist and the liberal Justice John 
Paul Stevens both strongly dissented for differ-
ent reasons. Stevens highlighted the illogicality 
of the majority ruling by pointing out that if a pro-
testor had “chosen to spray-paint his message 
of dissatisfaction on the façade of the Lincoln 
Memorial, there would be no question about the 
power of the Government to prohibit his means 
of expression.”

202
Part IV: The Bill of Rights: Specifying Rights through Amendments 
This provision looks pretty straightforward. But let’s look at it as little more 
closely:
 
✓ The whole provision is couched in negative terms and is governed 
by the words “Congress shall make no law.” Why? Because the First 
Amendment is not granting any new rights. It’s only guaranteeing rights 
that already existed.
 
✓ The right to freedom of speech already existed in colonial times — but 
subject to certain exceptions, notably defamation and obscenity.
 
✓ The amendment draws a distinction between freedom of speech and 
freedom of the press. But doesn’t the term “freedom of speech” cover 
freedom of the press? Sure, but press freedom was considered impor-
tant enough to deserve separate protection.
 
✓ However, press freedom can also sometimes actually conflict with individ-
ual freedom of speech. A good example of this occurred in the run-up to 
the 2008 presidential election, when The New York Times refused to print 
an op-ed piece by John McCain responding to one by Barack Obama.
Denying protection to speech creating 
a “clear and present danger”
Congress has passed a number of laws that prohibit certain types of expres-
sion, particularly in regard to revolutionary speeches or writings. And the high 
court has addressed many questions relating to such types of expression. Here 
are a few:
 
✓ Can speech lose its First Amendment protection if it creates a “clear 
and present danger”? The court answered yes (until 1969 — see the last 
bullet of this list). Charles Schenck, a Socialist, published a leaflet urging 
young men to refuse to serve in World War I if drafted. In Schenck v. 
United States, heard in 1919, the high court rejected Schenck’s claim that 
his publication was protected by the First Amendment. Justice Oliver 
Wendell Holmes, writing for a unanimous court, held that the leaflets 
created a “clear and present danger” that draftees would refuse to serve 
in the armed forces, which was a “substantive evil” that the government 
had the right to prevent. Holmes based this doctrine on a shaky parallel: 
“The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man 
in falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic.”
 
✓ How clear and how present does the “clear and present danger” have 
to be? According to the Supreme Court, not very clear and not very 
present. In Gitlow v. New York, decided in 1925, the majority on the court 
greatly widened the “clear and present danger” test, upholding Benjamin 
Gitlow’s New York conviction for advocating the violent overthrow of 
the government. Oliver Wendell Holmes, the originator of the “clear and 

203
 Chapter 14: The First Amendment: Freedom of Religion, Speech, and Assembly 
present danger” test, dissented. He held that the publication of Gitlow’s 
revolutionary writings did not create any such danger, as his views were 
shared by only a small minority of people — and Gitlow was only calling 
for a revolution at some “indefinite time in the future.”
 
✓ Is the “clear and present danger” test still in force? No. The high court 
unanimously replaced it, in the 1969 case of Brandenburg v. Ohio, with 
a new, more liberal test, allowing First Amendment protection even to 
advocacy of the use of force — “except where such advocacy is directed 
to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or 
produce such action.”
Allowing obscenity to be seen?
Are pornography and obscene publications protected under the First 
Amendment?
Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for the court in the 1964 case Stanley 
v. Georgia, famously held that “If the First Amendment means anything, it 
means that a State has no business telling a man, sitting alone in his own 
house, what books he may read or what films he may watch.”
 
In a nutshell, here’s where the court stands on protections related to obscene 
materials: The possession of obscene material is protected under the First 
Amendment. The sale and distribution of obscene material, on the other hand, 
does not enjoy First Amendment protection (although the American Civil 
Liberties Union [ACLU] successfully challenged parts of the Communications 
Decency Act of 1996 that made it a crime to use the Internet to send or display 
to anyone under the age of 18 any communication that is “patently offensive, 
obscene or indecent”).
The possession protection does not extend to child pornography. The law on 
child pornography has been tightened through the years, including with the 
PROTECT Act of 2003. (PROTECT is an acronym for Prosecutorial Remedies 
and Other Tools to end the Exploitation of Children Today.) The constitu-
tionality of this act was unsuccessfully challenged in the 2008 case of United 
States v. Williams.
This whole discussion begs the question, what is the definition of obscenity? 
The high court had a major problem with this question until, in 1973, it hit 
upon a definition that is still generally accepted. This definition, formulated 
in the case of Miller v. California, restricts the label obscene to
works which, taken as a whole, appeal to the prurient interest in sex, which 
portray sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, and which, taken as a 
whole, do not have serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.
What a mouthful!

204
Part IV: The Bill of Rights: Specifying Rights through Amendments 
Using and abusing the right 
to freedom of the press
In the early days of the United States, anybody could set up a printing press 
in a back room of his or her house. The Framers regarded press freedom as 
something very precious because it gave the little person a voice against big 
government.
In the early 20th century, the state of Minnesota challenged freedom of 
the press with a state law that provided for the gagging of any “malicious, 
scandalous and defamatory newspaper, magazine or other periodical.” The 
Saturday Press, a particularly scurrilous rag, was prosecuted under this law. 
But, in the 1931 case of Near v. Minnesota, the U.S. Supreme Court struck 
down the state law as unconstitutional. Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, 
writing for the majority, held that “Liberty of speech and of the press, is not 
an absolute right, and the State may punish its abuse” — but only after publi-
cation, not before.
The high court gave a great boost to press freedom in the landmark 1964 case 
of New York Times Co. v. Sullivan. Sullivan was a police chief in Montgomery, 
Alabama. The New York Times ran an advertisement that Sullivan claimed 
was defamatory of himself. Sullivan was awarded damages of $500,000 by 
an Alabama court. The U.S. Supreme Court took this money away from him 
and created a new rule applicable to public officials bringing a defamation or 
libel suit concerning their official conduct. To win a libel suit, a public official 
needs to prove not only that the words he objects to are untrue but that they 
also involve actual malice — meaning that the person who published those 
words knew that they were false or didn’t care whether they were true or 
false.
What if the published falsehood is deliberate but intended to be satirical? 
The well-known 1988 case of Hustler Magazine v. Falwell concerned a spoof 
interview with the Rev. Jerry Falwell in which Falwell “admitted” that his 
“first time” was drunken incest with his mother in an outhouse. Falwell was 
awarded $150,000 for emotional distress. But the high court found in favor of 
the magazine because the purported claims contained in the offending article 
were so extreme that nobody could be expected to take them seriously.
 
In 1971, The New York Times led another notable, but somewhat dubious, 
triumph for press freedom. The case centered on the Pentagon Papers — a 
14,000-page top-secret government report about the handling of the Vietnam 
War. The report was leaked to The New York Times by Daniel Ellsberg, who 
was involved in a study of the documents originally commissioned by Defense 
Secretary Robert McNamara. The Times at once began publishing excerpts 
from these top-secret documents in serialized form.

205
 Chapter 14: The First Amendment: Freedom of Religion, Speech, and Assembly 
The majority on the high court found in favor of the newspaper’s right to 
publish the excerpts, arguing that except when the nation was actually at 
war, the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech is absolute. In the 
words of Justice William Brennan:
The entire thrust of the Government’s claim has been that publication 
of the material sought to be enjoined “could,” or “might,” or “may” 
prejudice the national interest in various ways. But the First Amendment 
tolerates absolutely no prior judicial restraints of the press predicated upon 
surmise or conjecture that untoward consequences may result.
Chief Justice Warren Burger dissented, describing the published information 
as “purloined documents.” Justice Harry Blackmun, who also dissented, con-
cluded that publication of the Pentagon Papers “could clearly result in great 
harm to the nation.” Blackmun set the First Amendment against the back-
ground of the Constitution as a whole:
The First Amendment, after all, is only one part of an entire Constitution. 
Article II of the great document vests in the Executive Branch primary power 
over the conduct of foreign affairs, and places in that branch responsibility 
for the Nation’s safety.
Protecting the Right to 
Assemble and Petition
The right to march to Washington D.C. and make your feelings known to the 
government is still an important one, but probably less important than it was 
in the early days of the nation, before the rise of the party system, before 
radio, before television, and before the Internet.
The connection between the right to assemble and the right to petition can 
easily be seen, and so can the connection between the right to assemble and 
the right to free association — which has been interpreted to allow member-
ship of labor unions and other associations.
United States v. Cruikshank, decided in 1875, is one of the few leading cases on 
this aspect of the First Amendment. An armed white mob clashed with a large 
gathering of African Americans at the courthouse in Colfax, Louisiana, at the 
time of a gubernatorial election. Some whites were charged under a Louisiana 
law that made it a felony for two or more persons to “combine, conspire, and 
confederate together, with the unlawful purpose of depriving United States 
citizens of African descent” of their civil rights. The U.S. Supreme Court threw 
out the indictments for vagueness. But the most important part of the ruling 

206
Part IV: The Bill of Rights: Specifying Rights through Amendments 
in Cruikshank was to refuse to apply the First Amendment to the states. In 
other words, the high court did not regard the First Amendment as “incorpo-
rated” by the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. The court held 
that the First Amendment applied only to the national government.
 
However, the U.S. Supreme Court now regards the whole of the First 
Amendment as “incorporated” — including the right to petition and freedom 
of assembly. So the states are now subordinate to the feds in regard to these 
rights also.
In the 1937 decision in De Jonge v. Oregon, a unanimous U.S. Supreme Court 
overturned the conviction of a Communist leader for addressing a meeting 
allegedly advocating “criminal syndicalism and sabotage.” The high court 
declared the interpretation of the Oregon law by the state Supreme Court to 
be “repugnant” to the First Amendment as incorporated into the Due Process 
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
National Socialist Party of America v. Village of Skokie is an interesting and 
highly controversial 1978 case illustrating the conflicting forces at work. A 
neo-Nazi group wanted to stage a march through the village of Skokie, Illinois, 
a largely Jewish area. The local authorities wanted to keep the neo-Nazis out. 
The Illinois Supreme Court, upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, refused to ban 
the march. The Illinois Supreme Court even specifically refused to ban the 
display of the swastika emblem — using the rather dubious parallel of per-
mission given to war protesters in another case to wear black armbands. In 
the end, the neo-Nazis didn’t march through Skokie, but they had won a legal 
victory without doing so.

Chapter 15
The Second Amendment: 
Bearing Arms
In This Chapter
▶ Weighing individual versus states’ rights
▶ Parsing the amendment’s language
▶ Taking a quick tour through Supreme Court decisions
▶ Considering the future of gun laws
T
he Second Amendment is one of the shortest — and one of the most 
controversial — of all the amendments. Here’s how the amendment 
reads, according to the handwritten version of the Bill of Rights now hanging 
in the U.S. National Archives in Washington D.C. (as painstakingly inked on 
parchment by congressional clerk William Lambert back in 1789):
A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the 
right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.
But the version of the amendment that was actually passed by Congress and 
ratified by the states is worded this way:
A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the 
right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
This version looks more modern. The difference between the two versions 
is two extra commas in the Lambert version: one after “Militia” and another 
after “Arms.” Do the commas really matter? Probably not. Punctuation was 
more arbitrary 200 years ago than it is today. A comma could just indicate a 
pause without any grammatical significance.
But the interpretation of this single sentence — with or without the two extra 
commas — is the focus of heated debate. In this chapter, I introduce the 
arguments surrounding this amendment and explain the impact of a recent 
Supreme Court decision about gun rights.

208
Part IV: The Bill of Rights: Specifying Rights through Amendments 
Debating Interpretation: Individual 
versus State Rights
Two main schools of thought do battle over the Second Amendment: the indi-
vidual (or personal) rights school of thought and the states’ (or collective) 
rights school of thought. In a nutshell, here’s how the two differ:
 
✓ Individual rights: The individual rights school interprets the amend-
ment as giving people the right to buy guns and use them for sport, self-
protection, or any other lawful purpose. This school believes that every 
person has the same right, not just members of the military, the National 
Guard, or any other kind of militia.
 
✓ States’ rights: This school sees the amendment as giving states the right 
to establish militias like the National Guard but not giving any rights to 
individuals.
A range of intermediate views exists, of course, which fall somewhere 
between these two schools of thought. For example, some people believe 
that the amendment
 
✓ Restricts the right to possess firearms to members of some sort of mili-
tia but allows such members to use their arms for their own personal 
protection as well as for national defense.
 
✓ Allows any law-abiding and responsible citizen to possess firearms after 
undergoing a background check.
 
✓ Grants individual citizens the right to have firearms for their personal 
use, provided the firearms are of a standard military type.
If you pay any attention to politics, you probably realize that people who 
define themselves as conservative tend to fall on one side of the debate 
between individual and states’ rights, and people who call themselves liberal 
often fall on the other side. In case you opt not to pay attention to politics at 
all (which means you probably get less heartburn than the rest of us), here’s 
the general breakdown:
 
✓ Conservatives: Broadly speaking, conservatives favor the right of U.S. 
citizens to arm themselves if they so wish. Conservatives tend to oppose 
placing restrictions on the purchase or possession of guns because they 
assume that criminals can gain access to firearms anyway. By clearing 
away legal restrictions, they argue, the law favors law-abiding citizens 
over the criminal element.
 
✓ Liberals: Liberals tend to fall into the states’ rights camp. Many liberals 
fear the possibility of individuals taking the law into their own hands and 
are more inclined to support restrictions on buying and carrying guns.

209
 Chapter 15: The Second Amendment: Bearing Arms 
Obviously, these are generalizations, and you probably wouldn’t have too 
much trouble finding exceptions to the rule.
Breaking Down the Amendment’s 
Clauses
Why, exactly, do people debate the Second Amendment so heatedly? After all, 
the entire Second Amendment is contained in a single sentence. The problem 
is that the two halves of that sentence seem to point in opposite directions:
 
✓ The first half — A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security 
of a free State — appears to place an emphasis on collective rights and 
obligations.
 
✓ The second half — the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not 
be infringed — places the emphasis on individual rights.
To understand the true meaning of the Second Amendment, we must take 
both its clauses into account. But the two schools of thought on this amend-
ment each emphasize one clause at the expense of the other. The individual 
rights school emphasizes the second clause, while the states’ rights school 
concentrates on the first.
In terms of English grammar, the second half of the amendment is the main 
clause, while the first half is a subordinate clause. This structure seems to 
support the individual rights interpretation, but nothing about this amend-
ment is quite clear-cut. As I show in the next section, states’ rights support-
ers have a different way of interpreting the sentence structure.
Understanding the states’ 
rights interpretation
The Second Amendment is the only part of the U.S. Bill of Rights that has 
a preamble or prefatory clause. I have enough faith in the amendment’s 
authors to believe that the sentence structure is not accidental, but what 
does the first clause tell us?
Finding meaning in “Militia”
To get an answer, consider that the word militia also appears in Article 
I, Section 8 and Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution and in the Fifth 
Amendment. (See the nearby sidebar “‘Militia’ in other parts of the 
Constitution.”) I believe that the word militia means the same thing in all 
these passages.

210
Part IV: The Bill of Rights: Specifying Rights through Amendments 
The Framers of the Constitution had markedly different feelings about armies 
than about militias. The Framers didn’t trust standing armies, which you 
can see from the fact that Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution prohibits 
Congress from financing an army for more than two years at a time. The 
function of keeping order and even of repelling invasions is entrusted to “the 
Militia” rather than the army.
Moreover, although the President is designated as Commander in Chief of 
the militia as well as of the army and navy (in Article II, Section 2), that chain 
of command applies only when the militia is “called into the actual Service 
of the United States.” Under normal circumstances, the militia is under the 
control of the individual states, not of the federal government. This fact was 
explained by President Thomas Jefferson in a letter to Destutt de Tracy in 
1811, in which Jefferson writes that the governor of each state is “constitu-
tionally the commander of the militia of the State.”
Jefferson was very concerned that the young Republic should have an effi-
cient and effective militia. He referred to it frequently in his annual messages 
to Congress. For example, in 1808 he said:
For a people who are free, and who mean to remain so, a well-organized 
and armed militia is their best security. It is, therefore, incumbent on us, at 
every meeting to revise the condition of the militia, and to ask ourselves 
if it is prepared to repel a powerful enemy at every point of our territories 
exposed to invasion.
 
Why the sharp contrast between the attitude toward militias and toward 
armies? Keep in mind that in the 18th century, police as we know them did not 
exist, so law and order had to be kept by soldiers. But if those soldiers were 
formed into a standing (permanent) army, the executive government would 
have tremendous power. A standing army owed its loyalty to the government, 
and in Europe governments had often used their troops as a repressive police 
force. Militias, by contrast, were the citizenry under arms (and generally car-
ried their own arms).
By the time the Second Amendment was ratified in 1791, the original part of 
the Constitution had been in force for about three years. It would have been 
strange, therefore, if “the well regulated Militia” of the Second Amendment 
referred to anything other than the type of militia that had been given such 
prominence elsewhere in the Constitution.
Its presence in the Constitution has invested the term militia with a certain 
sanctity. Not surprisingly, a number of self-proclaimed militias exist in the 
United States, some of which are really no more than vigilante groups. By 
using this label, they wrap themselves in the flag and claim a specially pro-
tected status. But are they entitled to it? Not unless they are militias in the 
sense intended by the Second Amendment.

211
 Chapter 15: The Second Amendment: Bearing Arms 
Interpreting the second clause with states’ rights in mind
The states’ righters like the first clause of the amendment better than the 
second, but they can’t get away from the fact that the second clause is the 
main clause. So how do they interpret it — in particular the words “the right 
of the people to keep and bear arms”?
They start by recognizing that a militia is made up of ordinary citizens under 
arms that they provide for themselves. They then focus on the word “bear.”
In 1840, the Tennessee Supreme Court in Aymette v. The State was adamant 
that the word “bear” had a distinctly military connotation:
The words ‘bear arms’ have reference to their military use, and were not 
employed to mean wearing them about the person as part of the dress.
A man in the pursuit of deer, elk, and buffaloes might carry his rifle every 
day for forty years, and yet it would never be said of him that he had borne 
arms; much less could it be said that a private citizen bears arms because 
he has a dirk or pistol concealed under his clothes, or a spear in a cane.
“Militia” in other parts of the Constitution
The term militia appears in several places in the 
Constitution. Its usage in other passages helps 
us determine how the Framers intended it to be 
interpreted in the Second Amendment.
Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution con-
tains two clauses dealing with the militia and 
one dealing with armies. It gives power to 
Congress
 
 To raise and support Armies, but no 
Appropriation of Money to that use shall be 
for a longer Term than two Years;
 
 To provide for calling forth the Militia to 
execute the Laws of the Union, suppress 
Insurrections and repel Invasions;
 
 To provide for organizing, arming, and 
disciplining, the Militia, and for governing 
such Part of them as may be employed in 
the Service of the United States, reserving 
to the States respectively, the Appointment 
of the Officers, and the Authority of training 
the Militia according to the discipline pre-
scribed by Congress.
Article II deals with the presidency. Section 2 
starts:
 
 The President shall be Commander in Chief 
of the Army and Navy of the United States, 
and of the Militia of the several States, 
when called into the actual Service of the 
United States.
The Fifth Amendment says that nobody is to be 
charged with “a capital, or otherwise infamous 
crime” unless indicted by a grand jury “except 
in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or 
in the Militia, when in actual service in time of 
War or public danger.”

Part IV: The Bill of Rights: Specifying Rights through Amendments 
This passage was fully endorsed by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 
Silveira v. Lockyer in 2002.
Interpreting “the right of the people”
Now that we have a sense of how states’ rights advocates interpret the two 
clauses of the Second Amendment, let’s turn our attention to the individual 
rights school of thought. To start, keep in mind that individual rights advo-
cates focus on the second half of the amendment, which is the main clause: 
the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.
The Second Amendment is not the only one to contain the phrase “the right 
of the people.” This same expression also appears in the First and Fourth 
amendments (see Chapters 14 and 16), where it clearly refers to individual 
rights.
If the Second Amendment gives rights to individuals, what exactly are those 
rights and what lawful restrictions can be placed on them? For example, does 
the right apply to any kind of firearm, or are there some justifiable restric-
tions? As I show later in this chapter, the U.S. Supreme Court in United States 
v. Miller recognized the right as being a personal or individual one but held 
that it had to be exercised in accordance with “the security of a free State.”
 
What are the nature and scope of the rights claimed by pro-gun advocates? 
Most of them insist that the purpose of the Second Amendment was not to grant 
any new rights but to preserve and guarantee rights that were already in exis-
tence. Some take the view that these rights are absolute, or unlimited. They’re 
afraid of the “slippery slope” — the danger that apparently minor restrictions 
are likely to lead to the eventual disappearance of gun rights altogether.
Others are prepared to accept restrictions on the purchase of certain types 
of firearms, such as automatic and semiautomatic weapons, and don’t object 
to background checks before buying a gun. Sportsmen are sometimes pre-
pared to accept a ban on handguns, as long as they can still buy shotguns 
and hunting rifles. But gun rights activists reject this approach as defeatist 
and insist that the amendment doesn’t protect only hunting but is intended 
primarily for self-defense.

213
 Chapter 15: The Second Amendment: Bearing Arms 
Upholding Individual Rights: 
D.C. v. Heller
In 2008, in the case District of Columbia v. Heller, the Supreme Court for the 
first time actually decided on the meaning of the Second Amendment. The 
court was finally able to get its teeth into this important question because of 
a challenge to a Washington, D.C. law.
The law in question totally banned the possession of handguns in the home. 
It also made it a crime to carry any unregistered firearm and required any 
lawful firearm in the home to be bound by a trigger-lock.
 
Those opposed to the D.C. law portrayed it as completely preventing home-
owners and other residents from defending themselves against intruders. The 
law banned handguns, the firearm of choice for home protection, and disabled 
all other firearms by insisting that they have a trigger-lock on.
The question before the high court was therefore quite simple: Was the D.C. 
law in keeping with the Second Amendment, or did it violate rights under that 
amendment?
To answer that question, it was necessary for the court to interpret the 
meaning of the amendment. As I explain earlier in the chapter, there are two 
main interpretations of the Second Amendment: the individual rights inter-
pretation and the states’ rights interpretation.
In its ruling, the Supreme Court divided along traditional lines, with two of 
the court’s big hitters slugging it out:
 
✓ The heavyweight conservative standard-bearer Justice Antonin Scalia 
did battle in favor of individual rights.
 
✓ The agile 88-year-old liberal Justice John Paul Stevens (on the court 
since 1975) gave as good as he got on the states’ rights side.
 
Stevens emphasized the first clause of the amendment, while Scalia argued 
that the second clause was the really important one. Scalia won a narrow but 
decisive 5–4 victory. So it’s official: You do have an individual constitutional 
right to own and use a gun.

214
Part IV: The Bill of Rights: Specifying Rights through Amendments 
Concentrating on the D.C. law’s ban on handguns and its requirement that 
licensed firearms in the home be kept inoperable at all times, the majority 
ruled that “This makes it impossible for citizens to use firearms for the core 
lawful purpose of self-defense and is hence unconstitutional.” The court 
therefore struck the D.C. law down as unconstitutional.
The minority on the court sought to uphold the D.C. law, relying on the fact 
that some regulation of the possession and use of firearms had always been 
allowed and the D.C. law’s restrictions did not go beyond proper limits.
Justice Stephen Breyer, in an additional dissent, opined:
The protection the Amendment provides is not absolute. The Amendment 
permits government to regulate the interests that it serves. . . . The majority’s 
view cannot be correct unless it can show that the District’s regulation 
is unreasonable or inappropriate in Second Amendment terms. This the 
majority cannot do.
Considering an earlier Supreme 
Court decision
Although Heller was the first Supreme Court case to offer a comprehensive 
interpretation of the Second Amendment, the amendment was considered in 
several earlier Supreme Court cases. The most important of these was United 
States v. Miller, decided in 1939. Two suspected robbers and moonshiners were 
charged with transporting an unregistered sawed-off shotgun across state 
lines in violation of the National Firearms Act of 1934. The question before the 
Supreme Court was whether this law violated the Second Amendment. The law 
didn’t prohibit the possession or transportation of any kind of firearm. It just 
required certain classes of firearms, including sawed-off shotguns, to be regis-
tered at a cost of $200.
Justice James McReynolds, writing for a unanimous high court, ruled that the 
1934 act did not conflict with the Second Amendment. McReynolds held that 
the Second Amendment “must be interpreted and applied” with the view of 
maintaining a “militia.” A sawed-off shotgun didn’t have any “reasonable rela-
tionship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia,” so the 
restriction on such firearms by requiring them to be registered didn’t violate 
the Second Amendment.

215
 Chapter 15: The Second Amendment: Bearing Arms 
Taking two sides on what Miller meant
The minority in Heller expressed great respect, even reverence, for the unani-
mous opinion in Miller, which Justice John Paul Stevens summarized as hold-
ing that the Second Amendment “protects the right to keep and bear arms for 
certain military purposes, but . . . does not curtail the legislature’s power to 
regulate the nonmilitary use and ownership of weapons.”
Antonin Scalia for the majority rejected this interpretation of Miller out of hand:
Miller did not hold that and cannot possibly be read to have held that. Miller 
stands only for the proposition that the Second Amendment right, whatever 
its nature, extends only to certain types of weapons. It is particularly 
wrongheaded to read Miller for more than what it said, because the case did 
not even purport to be a thorough examination of the Second Amendment.
The conservative majority therefore effectively distinguished Miller — side-
lined it as irrelevant — while the liberal minority strongly believed that it 
should have been followed and applied to Heller.
Considering the Future of the Debate
The Second Amendment is one of the most topical and controversial of all 
parts of the Constitution — and that is not going to change any time soon in 
spite of the Supreme Court’s ruling in Heller. But the debate is likely to be 
narrower than before.
The high court says that individuals have the right to own and use guns — 
but Justice Scalia, writing for the majority, freely admitted that the right is 
not unlimited. It is not “a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in 
any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.”
Scalia identified the following as lawful restrictions on individual gun rights:
 
✓ “prohibitions on carrying concealed weapons”
 
✓ “prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill”
 
✓ “laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as 
schools and government buildings”
 
✓ “laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale 
of arms”
 
✓ Prohibitions on “the carrying of ‘dangerous and unusual weapons’”

216
Part IV: The Bill of Rights: Specifying Rights through Amendments 
Arguments about the definition and scope of these restrictions are likely to 
open up a whole new can of worms — making the Second Amendment as 
controversial as ever.
The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act of 2005 is another likely 
source of controversy. This law essentially prevents anyone from bringing a 
lawsuit against a gun dealer because of the “misuse” of a gun. But when does 
use become “misuse”?
 
Yet another source of controversy is the question whether the Second 
Amendment binds the states as well as the federal government by being 
“incorporated” into the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 
The current doctrine as accepted by the high court is that the whole of the 
Bill of Rights is incorporated in this way — with the exception of the Second, 
Ninth, and Tenth amendments.
But why should the Second Amendment not be applicable to the states? That 
question is more topical than ever after Heller. Several cases have been filed 
in federal court asking for a ruling that the Second Amendment is applicable 
to the states too. Watch this space.

Chapter 16
The Third and Fourth Amendments: 
Protecting Citizens from 
Government Forces
In This Chapter
▶ Recognizing your home as your castle
▶ Analyzing “unreasonable searches and seizures”
▶ Understanding how the Supreme Court has changed the law
T
he Third and Fourth amendments (which are part of the Bill of Rights — 
the first ten amendments that were all ratified together in 1791) both 
safeguard people against intrusion. In brief, the Third Amendment prohibits 
the quartering of soldiers in your house without your consent. The Fourth 
Amendment prohibits “unreasonable searches and seizures” of “persons, 
houses, papers, and effects.”
Keeping the Feds Out of Your House
Before the American Revolution, a rumor spread among the colonists that 
the British government was about to force homeowners to accommodate 
troops free of charge in their homes. This fear was the product of a mistaken 
reading of the Quartering Acts of 1765 and 1774, which in fact allowed the 
British colonial authorities to quarter troops only in “uninhabited houses, 
outhouses, barns, or other buildings.” Despite this restriction, the 1774 Act 
was soon labeled by the colonists as one of the “Intolerable Acts.”
During the course of the Revolutionary War, both sides in fact quartered 
troops in private homes. The Framers of the Constitution believed that quar-
tering troops in private homes was an evil — but recognized that in times of 
war it was a necessary evil. So, in drafting the Third Amendment, they drew a 
clear distinction between war and peace.

218
Part IV: The Bill of Rights: Specifying Rights through Amendments 
 
The Third Amendment is a bit of a Cinderella. It hasn’t had the attention lav-
ished on so many other parts of the Constitution. The U.S. Supreme Court has 
never had to interpret it, and the amendment has been the direct subject of lit-
igation in a federal court only once since it was ratified in 1791. But I think this 
is a blessing in disguise, because when the courts get their teeth into any part 
of the Constitution, they tend to make a meal of it — and sometimes one that 
is not too appetizing!
The Third Amendment is neither long nor complicated. Here’s what it says:
No Soldier shall, in time of peace be quartered in any house, without the 
consent of the Owner, nor in time of war, but in a manner to be prescribed 
by law.
This wording looks pretty straightforward, but there’s always room for 
debate about the meaning of any part of the Constitution. The potentially 
controversial terms here are as follows:
 
✓ Soldier: This word evokes multiple questions:
 
• Does this word include navy seamen, marines, air force person-
nel, and coastguard personnel as well? Probably. In 2007, a couple 
hundred supporters of the National Anti-Quartering Association 
(NAQA) descended on a private residence in Fairfax, Virginia, in 
the belief that three navy seamen were demanding to be quartered 
there. The NAQA members sheepishly dispersed when the three 
sailors turned out to be the sons of the house owner who were 
home on shore leave!
 
• Does this word include National Guardsmen, who are under state 
control? Yes. This was decided by the Second Circuit Court of 
Appeals in the 1982 case of Engblom v. Carey. The court based 
this decision on the controversial incorporation doctrine — the 
belief that most of the rights in the Bill of Rights are applicable 
to the states (as well as to the federal government) as a result of 
being incorporated into the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth 
Amendment. I discuss this thorny problem in the later section 
“Rewriting the Fourth Amendment,” as well as in Chapter 17.
 
• Could this word include nonmilitary government agents, like 
maybe a police SWAT team snooping on a neighboring house? 
Hard to say. This practice is sometimes employed, but I don’t 
know of any legal complaints about it.
 
✓ quartered: In Colonial times, courts often ordered felons to be “hanged, 
drawn and quartered” — meaning that, after being cut down, the felon’s 
body was cut in four. So, does the Third Amendment mean that you 
mustn’t cut a soldier’s body in four? Ummm, probably not. Quartering 
means the same as billeting, which means that the homeowner has to 
provide the soldier with free board and lodging.

219
 Chapter 16: The Third and Fourth Amendments
 
✓ in time of peace . . . in time of war: Troops were quartered in private 
homes in the War of 1812 — a formal war declared by Congress — 
without any legal provision for it. In the Civil War — an undeclared 
war — the U.S. government quartered troops in both “rebel” and Union 
states without any legal authority. But what about times when the 
United States is fighting an undeclared war purely on foreign soil — 
like the Korean War, the Vietnam War, or the war in Iraq? Do these 
actions entitle the government to quarter troops in private homes in 
the United States? Possibly — but then such quartering must be done 
“in a manner . . . prescribed by law.”
 
✓ in any house: House must be understood as covering any form of resi-
dential accommodation, including an apartment, a condominium, or 
possibly even a dorm-style room — which was the form of residential 
accommodation at issue in the Engblom case.
 
✓ Owner: The court in Engblom rejected a narrow view of this term in 
favor of a broad interpretation covering anyone “who owns or lawfully 
possesses or controls property.”
 
✓ but in a manner to be prescribed by law: But means “except.” So, this 
phrase means that in wartime, no quartering is allowed except in ways 
laid down by law. What sort of law does this refer to? Although the refer-
ence is vague, this presumably refers to legislation passed by Congress.
Putting the Third Amendment in perspective
Your doorbell rings. You open the door to a troop 
of smartly uniformed GIs. Their sergeant hands 
you an official-looking document identifying 
your home as their billet for an indefinite stay.
How do you react to this prospect? With enthu-
siasm? With resignation? With horror? Most 
homeowners would probably be less than 
enthusiastic about this scenario — and this 
reaction is reflected in the Third Amendment.
But what is the legal basis for the Third 
Amendment? Its legal foundation goes all the 
way back to the old English legal maxim “An 
Englishman’s home is his castle,” which tradi-
tionally gave homeowners extensive rights to 
protect their property against intruders — even 
to the point of being allowed to kill such intrud-
ers with impunity. In England this protection has 
now largely been lost — but it still survives in 
the United States.
The position in U.S. law generally is that if 
someone tries to break into your house and you 
have a reasonable fear that there is a present 
or immediate danger that the assailant intends 
to commit a felony or to attack yourself or your 
family, then the law allows you even to kill the 
intruder to stop him from entering your house.
This legal rule is based on property rights rather 
than on any right of privacy. But the concept 
of privacy actually grew largely out of property 
rights. In the case of Griswold v. Connecticut 
(1965), which first established a constitutional 
right to privacy, Justice William O. Douglas, 
writing for the majority, identified the Third 
Amendment as creating a “zone of privacy.”

220
Part IV: The Bill of Rights: Specifying Rights through Amendments 
A restatement of the Third Amendment would read something like this:
In peacetime, neither the federal government nor any state is permitted to 
billet troops in any residence without the consent of the owner, tenant, or 
lawful occupant. In wartime, the federal government and the states may 
not billet troops in private residences except in ways permitted by an Act of 
Congress.
Keeping the Government Off Your Back
The Fourth Amendment reads as follows:
The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and 
effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, 
and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath 
or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the 
persons or things to be seized.
A careful reading reveals that the amendment is in two parts:
 
✓ “unreasonable searches and seizures” are prohibited.
 
✓ valid warrants require “probable cause,” as well as a precise description 
of “the place to be searched, and the person or things to be seized.”
 
What is the connection between these two parts? Although the two halves of 
the amendment are linked by the word “and,” there is a logical gap between 
them. Does the amendment say that a warrant is needed for a search to be 
lawful? Not really — although it is often taken for granted that the amendment 
does require a warrant for a search and seizure to be lawful.
Unlike the Third Amendment, the Fourth Amendment is often applied and 
interpreted. It’s most often called into question in criminal cases involving 
searches of property that result in seizure of evidence that is later intended 
to be used at trial against a criminal defendant. But, as is so often the case 
with the U.S. Constitution, the Fourth Amendment raises more questions 
than it answers. Here are some of those questions.
 
✓ What exactly are “unreasonable searches and seizures”?
 
✓ Does the Fourth Amendment prohibit “unreasonable searches and sei-
zures” only by government agents, or by just anybody?
 
✓ Does the Fourth Amendment apply to “unreasonable searches and 
seizures” by the feds alone, or does it also cover actions by state 
governments?
 
✓ What is the meaning of “probable cause”?

221
 Chapter 16: The Third and Fourth Amendments
 
✓ Why does a valid warrant have to describe the specific “place to be 
searched, and the persons or things to be seized”?
 
✓ Is a warrant always required for a lawful search and seizure?
I answer each of these questions in turn.
Prohibiting “unreasonable 
searches and seizures”
“The Fourth Amendment protects people, not places,” said the Supreme 
Court in Katz v. United States in 1967. In that case, Justice John Marshall 
Harlan came up with a twofold test that the court has now accepted: “first 
that a person have exhibited an actual (subjective) expectation of privacy 
and, second, that the expectation be one that society is prepared to recog-
nize as ‘reasonable’.” Justice Harlan explained:
Thus, a man’s home is, for most purposes, a place where he expects 
privacy, but objects, activities, or statements that he exposes to the “plain 
view” of outsiders are not “protected,” because no intention to keep them 
to himself has been exhibited. On the other hand, conversations in the 
open would not be protected against being overheard, for the expectation of 
privacy under the circumstances would be unreasonable.
In the Katz case, Charles Katz was convicted of illegal gambling on the basis 
of a recording made by the FBI of a telephone conversation that Katz made 
from a public phone booth. Was Katz’s conversation protected by the Fourth 
Amendment? The high court said yes, even though the feds’ recording device 
was attached to the outside of the phone booth.
In the words of Justice Potter Stewart:
No less than an individual in a business office, in a friend’s apartment, or in 
a taxicab, a person in a telephone booth may rely upon the protection of the 
Fourth Amendment.
Had Katz committed a federal crime by placing that bet? Sure he had. So, why 
couldn’t the feds nail him? Because they didn’t have a warrant. Could they 
have gotten a warrant? Ummm, it depends . . . I deal with that thorny ques-
tion a bit later in this chapter.
 
The feds ought not to have recorded Katz’s conversation without a warrant. 
But the real problem was that they couldn’t use the recording in evidence at 
the trial against Katz. The exclusionary rule stops the authorities from using 
evidence obtained in breach of the Fourth Amendment. But that rule isn’t 
absolute.

222
Part IV: The Bill of Rights: Specifying Rights through Amendments 
Excluding evidence
English common law didn’t concern itself with how evidence was obtained. Even 
if evidence was stolen, it was still admissible in court. U.S. law followed suit 
until 1914, when the Supreme Court ruled that evidence obtained illegally — 
in particular, contrary to the Fourth Amendment — could not be used.
The Supreme Court first adopted this exclusionary rule in the case of Weeks v. 
United States. Missouri police and a federal marshal entered Fremont Weeks’s 
house in his absence and seized a lot of stuff — including some candy! The 
candy wasn’t the problem. The search turned up evidence that Weeks had 
been sending lottery tickets through the mail — a federal offense. Neither the 
police nor the federal marshal had a warrant, so the search and seizure was 
held to be a violation of the Fourth Amendment — and the evidence derived 
from it was excluded.
The exclusionary rule makes sense because if police know that they can use 
evidence even if it has been obtained by illegal search and seizure, they can 
simply ignore the Fourth Amendment. On the other hand, strict enforcement 
of the exclusionary rule in the 1970s and 1980s wrapped criminal defendants 
in a protective cocoon and made it harder to get convictions.
An extension of the exclusionary rule may also exclude evidence indi-
rectly obtained with the use of illegally obtained information. The evidence 
obtained in this situation is called “the fruit of the poisonous tree.” The 
scope of this extension of the exclusionary rule is not always clear.
In the 1980 case of United States v. Crews, three women were robbed in a 
women’s restroom by a 16-year-old boy. The robber’s description was cir-
culated, and he was picked up by police ostensibly for truancy. He was later 
charged with armed robbery. His victims identified him in a court-ordered 
lineup. But his lawyers argued that the identification evidence should be 
excluded as “fruit of the poisonous tree” because it derived from the initial 
arrest, for which there was no probable cause. The District of Columbia 
Court of Appeals bought this argument. But a unanimous U.S. Supreme Court 
disagreed and allowed the identification evidence to stand. Justice William 
Brennan, writing for the court, made the point that the identification evi-
dence was independent of the original truancy arrest.
Addressing a police convention in 1981, President Ronald Reagan attacked 
the exclusionary rule, which he described as based on the “absurd proposi-
tion that a law enforcement error, no matter how technical, can be used to 
justify throwing out an entire case,” even when the defendant was plainly 
guilty of a serious criminal offense.

223
 Chapter 16: The Third and Fourth Amendments
 
The U.S. Supreme Court recognizes that the exclusionary rule is “a judicially 
created remedy designed to safeguard Fourth Amendment rights generally 
through its deterrent effect, rather than a personal constitutional right of the 
party aggrieved.” On this basis, the court has carved out more and more 
exceptions to the exclusionary rule. Here are some of these exceptions:
 
✓ The exclusionary rule doesn’t apply to evidence before a grand jury. 
This was decided by the Supreme Court in United States v. Calandra 
in 1974.
 
✓ Evidence obtained illegally is admissible if it would have been found 
legally anyway. Here is an example of this exception to the exclusion-
ary rule: On Christmas Eve 1968, Robert Anthony Williams abducted and 
murdered a 10-year-old girl. He confessed to the police and pointed out 
to them where he had hidden the body. Because the police had agreed 
not to question Williams until his attorney was present, the finding of 
the body was technically a violation of Williams’s Fourth Amendment 
rights. A strict application of the exclusionary rule would have made the 
body and the autopsy inadmissible at Williams’s trial — as a result of 
which a brutal killer would probably have walked. Fortunately, however, 
the Supreme Court decided in Nix v. Williams in 1984 that this evidence 
was admissible because the police would inevitably have found the body 
anyway.
 
✓ Evidence obtained from an independent legal source is admissible. 
This exception to the exclusionary rule is similar to the previous excep-
tion. Here is an example: Police followed suspects into an apartment 
without a warrant. One of the suspects was found to be in possession 
of cocaine and was immediately arrested. Two officers remained in the 
apartment until a search warrant was issued — 19 hours later! After get-
ting the warrant, the officers found cocaine and records of drug dealing. 
The case reached the Supreme Court in 1984 under the name of Segura 
v. United States. The court ruled that “whether the initial entry was ille-
gal or not is irrelevant to the admissibility of the evidence, and exclusion 
of the evidence is not warranted as ‘fruit of the poisonous tree’.” The 
court reached this eminently sensible decision only by the narrowest of 
margins, 5 votes to 4.
 
✓ Good faith is an exception to an unduly strict interpretation of the 
rules. A literal application of the exclusionary rule can easily result 
in injustice by giving undue protection to criminal defendants. The 
good faith exception is a welcome commonsense counterblast to the 
exclusionary rule — which, it must always be remembered, is just a 
judge-made rule anyway. A good example of this exception is the 1984 
case of United States v. Leon. After an anonymous tip, the police placed 
Alberto Leon under surveillance. On this basis, the police got a warrant 
from a judge to search Leon’s house. Large quantities of illegal drugs 

224
Part IV: The Bill of Rights: Specifying Rights through Amendments 
were found there, and Leon was charged. His lawyers objected that the 
information on which the search warrant was based was too vague, so 
the warrant should be set aside and the evidence obtained under the 
warrant should be excluded. But the Supreme Court ruled that, even if 
the police should not have been given a search warrant, they acted in 
good faith, so the evidence obtained under the warrant was admissible 
in court. In the words of Justice Byron White, writing for the majority, 
“Indiscriminate application of the exclusionary rule may well generate 
disrespect for the law and administration of justice.”
Avoiding making “a crazy quilt of the 
Fourth Amendment”
Does the Fourth Amendment prohibit “unreasonable searches and seizures” 
only by government agents, or by just anybody?
The wording of the first part of the amendment is unhelpful on this score. 
But the mention of “Warrants” in the second part makes it clear that the 
amendment as a whole deals only with government actions. If a private 
person breaks into your house, ties you up, and grabs stuff belonging to you, 
that person is guilty of several felonies, for which he may go to jail. You can 
also file a civil suit against such a person. But he hasn’t violated the Fourth 
Amendment.
The distinction between public and private actions is not always quite so 
clear-cut. For example, in a 1979 high court case, Smith v. Maryland, a woman 
received threatening phone calls from somebody who had robbed her. She 
identified the man to the police, who got the phone company to install a “pen 
register” on the man’s home phone. This device made a list of all the num-
bers the man called but didn’t record the content of the calls themselves. 
The man claimed that the pen register violated his Fourth Amendment rights.
Writing for the U.S. Supreme Court, Justice Harry Blackmun ruled:
We are not inclined to make a crazy quilt of the Fourth Amendment, 
especially in circumstances where (as here) the pattern of protection would 
be dictated by billing practices of a private corporation. We therefore 
conclude that petitioner in all probability entertained no actual expectation 
of privacy in the phone numbers he dialed, and that, even if he did, his 
expectation was not “legitimate.” The installation and use of a pen register, 
consequently, was not a “search,” and no warrant was required.
As a result of this sensible decision, the police were able to nail the assailant — 
and it allows law enforcement agencies a useful tool.

225
 Chapter 16: The Third and Fourth Amendments
The relevant points here are as follows:
 
✓ When you make a phone call, the phone company automatically knows 
what number you dialed.
 
✓ The phone company is a private corporation, so it’s not under any duty 
to you under the Fourth Amendment.
 
✓ You don’t have a legitimate expectation of keeping secret the identity of 
the number you dialed.
 
✓ If the phone company makes a list of all the numbers you dial, that is not 
a “search” within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.
 
✓ So, it’s okay for the phone company to hand that list to the police.
Rewriting the Fourth Amendment
Okay, so the Fourth Amendment applies only to government searches and 
seizures. But which government? Does the amendment apply only to the feds, 
or to the states as well?
The Sixth, Tenth, and Eleventh amendments specifically mention the states — 
but not the Fourth. Was James Madison, who drafted the whole of the Bills of 
Rights, such a sloppy thinker as to assume that the Fourth Amendment applied 
to the states without bothering to say so in so many words? No way!
So how come the Supreme Court now says that the Fourth Amendment — 
and most of the rest of the Bill of Rights too — binds the states as well as 
the feds? This ruling is based on the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth 
Amendment, which reads as follows:
nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without 
due process of law.
This clause sure binds the states. But can the little phrase “without due pro-
cess of law” really burden the states with the obligations of much of the rest 
of the Bill of Rights?
 
This question opens up a huge can of worms labeled the doctrine of incorpora-
tion, which can be blamed on the vague wording of the Due Process Clause. 
For a full discussion of this controversial doctrine, see Chapter 14. The drafts-
men of the Fourteenth Amendment, which was ratified in 1868, weren’t in the 
same ballpark — or even in the same league — as James Madison. But could 
even these little league draftsmen have been that dumb that they just assumed 
they’d incorporated the bulk of the Bill of Rights in one vague five-word 
clause? Most unlikely.

226
Part IV: The Bill of Rights: Specifying Rights through Amendments 
The thinking behind the draftsmen of the Fourteenth can be seen from the so-
called Blaine Amendment. In 1875 — just seven years after the ratification of the 
Fourteenth Amendment — James G. Blaine, a leading politician who had been 
a member of Congress during the passing of the Fourteenth Amendment, pro-
posed a constitutional amendment that passed the House of Representatives 
but was four votes shy of the necessary two-thirds majority in the Senate.
The Blaine Amendment read:
No State shall make any law respecting an establishment of religion . . .
 
Familiar? Sure. The wording is lifted straight from the First Amendment but 
applies specifically to the states. This wording can mean only one thing: that 
Blaine and the majority of Congress did not think that the First Amendment 
already applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment.
Despite this evidence, in 1949 the Supreme Court decided in Wolf v. Colorado 
that the Fourth Amendment was incorporated into the Due Process Clause 
of the Fourteenth Amendment and that the Fourth Amendment therefore 
applied to the states as well as to the federal government — but that the 
exclusionary rule did not apply to the states. So, the states were bound by 
the Fourth Amendment, but any evidence found by state police in violation of 
the Fourth could still be used in court!
In 1961, the high court abandoned this position for a more extreme but 
more logical position in Mapp v. Ohio, which brought the states’ obligations 
under the Fourth Amendment into line with the feds’ obligations. The court 
ruled that “all evidence obtained by searches and seizures in violation of the 
Constitution is, by [the Fourth Amendment] inadmissible in a state court.”
This decision was one of many made by the Supreme Court under Chief 
Justice Earl Warren that favored criminal defendants. Although the wording 
of this ruling looks clear enough, it presented the court with the problem of 
how and when to exclude evidence in individual cases. I discuss the excep-
tions to the exclusionary rule earlier in this chapter.
Defining “probable cause”
The concept of probable cause holds the key to the second part of the Fourth 
Amendment, which says that “no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable 
cause.”
The word but here means “except.” Warrant refers to a legal document issued 
by a judge or magistrate authorizing law enforcement officers to do some-
thing that would otherwise be against the law — in particular, to search and 
seize evidence for use in a criminal prosecution.

227
 Chapter 16: The Third and Fourth Amendments
So this clause means that a valid warrant needs to be based on probable 
cause. But what is the meaning of probable cause? In 1878, the Supreme Court 
defined it like this:
If the facts and circumstances before the officer are such as to warrant 
a man of prudence and caution in believing that the offense has been 
committed, it is sufficient.
But, “good faith on the part of the arresting officer is not enough” to consti-
tute probable cause:
If subjective good faith alone were the test, the protections of the Fourth 
Amendment would evaporate, and the people would be ‘secure in their 
persons, houses, papers, and effects,’ only in the discretion of the police.
The case of Illinois v. Gates, heard by the high court in 1983, is a good 
example of the commonsense approach now adopted by the court on the 
question of probable cause. The police received an anonymous tip accusing a 
husband and wife of interstate drug trafficking. After finding that the couple’s 
movements conformed to the pattern described in the anonymous letter, the 
police got a search warrant and found drugs and weapons in the couple’s car 
and house. The couple challenged the legality of the search on the ground 
that the anonymous letter couldn’t constitute probable cause. However, the 
high court ruled that the question of probable cause could not be reduced to 
a formula but depended on “the totality of the circumstances” — and in this 
case the anonymous tip-off plus police corroboration of some of its details 
did amount to probable cause. Justice William Rehnquist put the whole ques-
tion in context by remarking that “[t]he most basic function of any govern-
ment [is] to provide for the security of the individual and of his property.”
Prohibiting police fishing expeditions
The second half of the Fourth Amendment reads as follows:
no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or 
affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the 
persons or things to be seized.
Why are there such detailed requirements for a valid warrant? To answer this 
question, we have to go back to colonial times.
In 1765, Lord Camden, Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas in England, 
handed down an historic decision against the British Government known as 
Entick v. Carrington. Three government agents had entered the house of John 
Entick, a radical journalist, armed with a “general warrant” issued by the 
Secretary of State allowing the agents to search through all of Entick’s papers 
and possessions. The agents spent several hours doing just that.

228
Part IV: The Bill of Rights: Specifying Rights through Amendments 
Lord Camden’s judgment was in strong terms. Here is an extract from it:
The great end for which men entered into society, was to secure their 
property . . . By the laws of England, every invasion of private property, be it 
ever so minute, is a trespass.
From that time onward, general warrants were banned — and couldn’t be 
issued by the government itself anyway. In order to conduct a lawful search 
and seizure, the government had to get a warrant from a judge on the basis of 
a sworn statement specifying the place that was to be searched and the per-
sons or things to be seized.
The Fourth Amendment essentially repeats these requirements, as a safe-
guard of the liberty of the individual against the government.
But too literal an application of these provisions can hinder law enforcement. 
So it is fortunate that in recent years the U.S. Supreme Court has relaxed the 
rigor of its application of these requirements.
For example, in the 1987 case of Maryland v. Garrison, police intending to 
search an apartment occupied by the McWebbs had a warrant specifying 
“third floor apartment.” In fact, there were two apartments on the third floor, 
although the police didn’t realize this fact at the time. The police accidentally 
entered the wrong apartment — and found drugs and cash. They arrested the 
occupant, Mr. Garrison, who objected that the warrant wasn’t valid.
The Supreme Court rejected this contention and held that the search and 
seizure were lawful. In the words of Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the 
majority:
There is no question that the warrant was valid and was supported by 
probable cause . . . Prior to the officers’ discovery of the factual mistake, 
they perceived McWebb’s apartment and the third-floor premises as one 
and the same; therefore their execution of the warrant reasonably included 
the entire third floor. Under either interpretation of the warrant, the 
officers’ conduct was consistent with a reasonable effort to ascertain and 
identify the place intended to be searched within the meaning of the Fourth 
Amendment.
Searching without a warrant?
The Fourth Amendment says that a warrant is required for a lawful search 
and seizure to take place — or does it? The two halves of the amendment are 
linked by the word and, but not by any clear, logical connection.

229
 Chapter 16: The Third and Fourth Amendments
In certain circumstances, the Supreme Court is prepared to allow evidence 
in on the basis of probable cause alone — even in the absence of a warrant. 
Terry v. Ohio, heard by the Supreme Court in 1968, is a good example of this 
approach. A very experienced police officer observed two men walking up 
and down past a store window and stopping to look into the same window 
no fewer than 24 times in the space of a few minutes. The officer suspected 
the men of “casing a job, a stick up.” He stopped the men, patted them down, 
and found a concealed revolver on each of them. The question before the 
Supreme Court was whether the revolver found on one of the men was admis-
sible in evidence against him — because the police officer who arrested him 
did not have a warrant. The high court held that the evidence of the revolver 
was admissible in court because the men’s suspicious behavior constituted 
probable cause, and in the circumstances no warrant was needed.
Can the police ever search premises without a warrant? Yes. In 1999, in 
Flippo v. West Virginia, the high court ruled that “police may make warrant-
less entries on to premises if they reasonably believe a person is in need of 
immediate aid and may make prompt warrantless searches of a homicide 
scene for possible other victims or a killer on the premises.” But the court 
rejected a general “murder scene exception” allowing the police to conduct a 
warrantless search of premises just because a homicide had been committed 
there.
Protecting America without a warrant?
What about the lawfulness of a wiretap without a warrant? In Katz v. United 
States, discussed earlier in the chapter, the high court ruled that a recording 
of a telephone conversation was unlawful — even though the call was made 
from a public phone booth and the recording device was attached to the out-
side of the booth.
How does this decision apply to national security? The Katz court didn’t con-
sider this angle. But the question has become topical since then. Here are a 
few of the controversial issues that have been raised in this connection:
 
✓ FISA: The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) of 1978 set up two 
courts, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) and the Foreign 
Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review (FISCR), both of which meet 
in secret. FISC hears requests from the FBI and other government agen-
cies for surveillance warrants against suspected foreign spies inside the 
United States. FISC operates like a grand jury; the government is the only 
party that appears before it. If FISC denies a government application for 
a warrant, the case goes to the FISCR. Most applications are granted, 
though sometimes with modifications.

230
Part IV: The Bill of Rights: Specifying Rights through Amendments 
 
 Is this set-up in accordance with the Fourth Amendment? Despite the 
secrecy, this arrangement doesn’t violate the Fourth Amendment. After 
all, any ordinary application for a search warrant will normally be made 
to a judge or magistrate without the other side being present.
 
✓ Call database: In 2006, the press broke the story that the National 
Security Agency (NSA) had compiled a database of more than 1.9 tril-
lion phone-call-detail records. The Bush administration neither con-
firmed nor denied this report. Is the database a violation of the Fourth 
Amendment? Not if it’s just a list of numbers called without recording 
the content of the calls themselves.
 
✓ Protect America Act: This Act was passed by Congress in 2007 and 
expired because of a “sunset clause” in February 2008. The Act allowed 
wiretapping by the federal government of any phone calls that begin 
or end in a foreign country — without a warrant from the FISC. Is this 
power a violation of the Fourth Amendment? The President said no, 
on the ground that it was an extension of his powers as Commander in 
Chief. But this argument would probably fail if challenged in court. I deal 
with the President in Chapter 10.

Chapter 17
Taking the Fifth — and 
a Bit of the Fourteenth
In This Chapter
▶ Avoiding self-incrimination
▶ Indicting suspects with a grand jury
▶ Banning double jeopardy
▶ Disentangling due process
▶ Trying to understand the incorporation doctrine
▶ Taking private property for public use
T
he Fifth Amendment, ratified in 1791, is one of the meatiest of all the arti-
cles of the Constitution, and one of the most controversial. It deals with 
some heavy-hitting issues:
 
✓ The so-called “Great Right” against self-incrimination
 
✓ The role of the grand jury
 
✓ Double jeopardy
 
✓ Due process
 
✓ Eminent domain
Due process is picked up in the Fourteenth Amendment, ratified in 1868. For 
that reason, I tackle part of the Fourteenth in this chapter as well. (I give the 
rest of the Fourteenth Amendment its due in Chapter 21.) But first we need 
to give our rapt attention to the Fifth so you can be the most informed Law & 
Order viewer on the block.

232
Part IV: The Bill of Rights: Specifying Rights through Amendments 
Invoking the “Great Right” 
Against Self-Incrimination
If you watch movies or TV shows, you’ve heard of the Fifth Amendment. (If 
you don’t watch movies or TV shows, I’m guessing you’re better read and 
more muscular than the rest of us.) “I’ll take da Fift(h)” is the gangster’s stock 
in trade. Why? Because the Fifth Amendment doesn’t allow anyone to be 
“compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.”
 
This is the “Great Right” that gives protection against self-incrimination. If 
you’re asked a question in court (or in some other formal proceeding) and 
your reply could amount to an admission of a crime on your part, you can 
refuse to answer.
The Miranda warning
The Fifth Amendment clearly states that you 
can’t be forced to give evidence against your-
self. But if you choose to answer an incriminating 
question, you must accept the consequences. 
Do you have to be warned about this fact in 
advance? Not in a court of law. But in 1966, the 
U.S. Supreme Court decided that you do have to 
be warned if you are being questioned by police. 
The case in question was Miranda v. Arizona, 
and the statement a police officer must make to 
a suspect is the well-known Miranda warning:
 
 You have the right to remain silent. Anything 
you say may be used against you in a court 
of law. You have the right to an attorney. If 
you cannot afford an attorney, one will be 
provided for you.
The wording varies slightly from state to state, 
but unless you’re cautioned in proper form, any 
statement you make to the police should be 
thrown out by the court.
Not everyone has been thrilled by this require-
ment. In 2000, Chief Justice William Rehnquist 
stated the problem with the Miranda warning 
this way: “Statements which may be by no 
means involuntary, made by a defendant who 
is aware of his ‘rights,’ may nonetheless be 
excluded and a guilty defendant go free as a 
result.”
In 1968, Congress passed a law seeking to 
reverse the worst excesses of the Miranda rule. 
If a confession was voluntary, said Congress, 
it should be allowed as evidence even if no 
Miranda warning was given. But in 2000, 
Dickerson v. U.S. set the Congressional law 
aside and put the Miranda rule back in the driv-
ing seat. The argument was that the Miranda 
rule had become part of the Constitution, and 
the law passed by Congress was therefore 
unconstitutional.
I would argue (as others, like Justice Antonin 
Scalia, have done) that the Miranda rule isn’t 
part of the Constitution; it’s simply based on the 
Constitution. But for now, the Miranda warning 
is required prior to any police interrogations.

233
 Chapter 17: Taking the Fifth — and a Bit of the Fourteenth
Normally, you have to answer any question that you are asked in court, and 
lying under oath can expose you to the serious charge of perjury. The Fifth 
Amendment gives you a way out under some circumstances. The formal 
way of invoking the Fifth is by saying “I refuse to answer the question on the 
ground that it might incriminate me.” A witness may claim this privilege in 
criminal cases as well as civil cases — if the witness is afraid that his answer 
is likely to expose him to a criminal charge.
However, there is a catch: Taking the Fifth is often interpreted as an admis-
sion of guilt. For example, the label Fifth Amendment Communists was 
attached to people who refused to answer questions before the House 
Un-American Activities Committee just after World War II.
 
The Fifth Amendment, like the rest of the Bill of Rights, was originally taken to 
apply only to federal law. To what extent it now applies to state law (if at all) 
has been the subject of heated debate. I present the basics of this debate in a 
sidebar later in the chapter called “The scope of the Fourteenth Amendment’s 
Due Process Clause.”
Peeking Behind the Closed 
Doors of the Grand Jury
The opening clause of the Fifth Amendment actually isn’t related to self-
incrimination. Instead, it deals with the grand jury system. It reads, in part:
No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous 
crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury . . .
The words “infamous crime” have been interpreted to mean that a grand jury 
is required only for felonies — not for misdemeanors.
The grand jury is a wonderful American institution. Like so many others, it 
long predates the U.S. Constitution. Its origins lie in the earliest days of the 
English Common Law, even before the Norman Conquest of 1066. By 1368, 
grand juries had taken on something very like their modern American form, 
but they were abolished in England in 1933 and have not survived anywhere 
else except in the United States.
The grand jury gets its name from its size. A regular trial jury usually has 12 
members, but grand juries are generally bigger. Federal grand juries range 
from 16 to 23 members. However, the real difference between a grand jury 

234
Part IV: The Bill of Rights: Specifying Rights through Amendments 
and a regular jury is not size but function. Regular juries are trial juries. In 
criminal cases they decide whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty. 
Grand juries are not trial juries. They come in at a much earlier stage to 
decide whether a suspect should be indicted with a crime at all.
It’s worth noting that although this part of the Fifth Amendment applies only 
to federal law, grand juries are found in plenty of states too.
Deciding whether to indict
The chief function of a grand jury is to decide whether to bring criminal 
charges against a suspect. In the federal courts (and in many states), nobody 
can be charged with a felony unless a grand jury has decided to indict that 
person. (However, in certain states it’s possible for the district attorney to 
file what’s called an information or accusation as an alternative to a grand jury 
indictment. This step is followed by a preliminary hearing before a judge at 
which the defendant can be represented by counsel.)
 
Grand juries generally do the prosecutor’s bidding. Sol Wachtler, former Chief 
Judge of New York, said in 1985 that a prosecutor could get a grand jury to 
indict a ham sandwich! A grand jury is very much the prosecutor’s show, and 
its proceedings are secret. No judge is present. The prosecutor presides and 
can call witnesses, forcing them to come by serving them with a subpoena. 
Here are some other ways a grand jury hearing differs from a regular trial:
 
✓ The normal rules of evidence are relaxed. For example, the usually 
strict “exclusionary rule,” which makes any evidence inadmissible if it’s 
obtained on an “unreasonable search and seizure,” doesn’t apply. (See 
Chapter 16 for more about this rule.) The practical effect of this is that a 
prosecutor can use evidence to secure a grand jury indictment that later 
may not be admissible at the trial on the same charges.
 
✓ Suspects are not allowed to call witnesses or cross-examine prosecution 
witnesses, but a suspect can be called to testify.
 
✓ A suspect or a witness before a grand jury can have a lawyer, but the 
lawyer can’t be inside the jury room! However, generally the suspect or 
witness is free to leave the proceedings to consult with counsel.
 
✓ A grand jury witness is normally given a warning against self-incrimination, 
but if the warning isn’t given and the witness lies under oath, the witness 
can still be prosecuted for perjury. As Justice William Brennan noted in 
the case that decided this issue, “Our legal system provides methods for 
challenging the Government’s right to ask questions — lying is not one 
of them.”

235
 Chapter 17: Taking the Fifth — and a Bit of the Fourteenth
Victimizing suspects or protecting victims?
The grand jury system has been criticized as unfair to defendants and sus-
pects. After all, they can’t be represented by counsel, can’t call witnesses, 
and can’t cross-examine prosecution witnesses. Some critics don’t like the 
ease with which prosecutions can be achieved as a result. They particularly 
don’t like the control that prosecutors usually have over grand juries.
There’s no doubt that the grand jury process is one-sided. But many people 
see the grand jury system as acting in the interests of victims of crime, pro-
viding a small but essential counterbalance to the elaborate apparatus of 
protection surrounding criminal suspects and defendants. (For a taste of this 
apparatus, see the sidebar “The Miranda warning” in this chapter.)
Avoiding Double Jeopardy
I’m not talking about the game show here. Double jeopardy means being tried 
twice for the same crime, and the second clause of the Fifth Amendment for-
bids it:
nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in 
jeopardy of life or limb.
As with the rest of the Bill of Rights, the ban on double jeopardy originally 
applied only to federal courts. But in 1969, the U.S. Supreme Court “incor-
porated” this guarantee into the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth 
Amendment, making it applicable to state courts too. (To get a sense of the 
debate behind this decision, see the upcoming sidebar “The scope of the 
Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause.”)
Applying the principle
Protection against double jeopardy is way older than the U.S. Constitution; 
it can be traced back to ancient Greece and Rome. There are three practical 
applications of the principle:
 
✓ If you’re acquitted (found not guilty) of a crime, you can’t be put on trial 
for it again. This is by far the most important aspect of the principle, 
which is confined to criminal cases.
 
✓ You can’t be tried again for a crime of which you have been convicted.
 
✓ If you’ve already been punished for committing a certain crime, you 
can’t be given a second punishment for that same offense.

236
Part IV: The Bill of Rights: Specifying Rights through Amendments 
Mistrials are an exception. A mistrial occurs when the judge cancels the trial — 
usually for some procedural reason — before the jury has returned a verdict. If 
a mistrial occurs, a retrial can be ordered. Another exception is when the origi-
nal trial is a nullity — for example, if a defendant bribes the judge or members 
of the jury to achieve an acquittal. This offense makes the trial a nullity, or a 
non-trial. It’s as if the original trial never took place.
Allowing for an end to litigation
It seems only fair that after you’ve faced the music and the music has finally 
stopped, that should be the end of the matter. Especially if you’ve been 
acquitted, it would seem wrong for the same crime to hang over your head 
for the rest of your life.
However, some arguments against this principle carry weight. Say you’ve 
been tried and acquitted of a particular crime and new evidence later comes 
to light pointing to your guilt. Wouldn’t it be fair to your victim for you to be 
hauled before the court again?
It may not seem fair in every instance, but there is an ancient principle of law 
going back to Roman times that “it’s in the public interest for there to be an 
end to litigation.” In other words, it’s not good to keep flogging a dead horse. 
Doing so would result in an intolerable situation for successful defendants, 
who would have all their old charges hanging over them indefinitely, or until 
the statute of limitations ran out. (Or until they were retried and convicted.)
 
Because of this ancient principle, repackaged in the Fifth Amendment, if some-
one literally gets away with murder there is nothing to stop that person from 
crowing about it. Oh, except that the victim’s family can take him or her to the 
cleaners in a civil wrongful death suit. This situation is not considered to be 
double jeopardy because the parties are not the same as in a criminal pros-
ecution and the standard of proof is different.
Let me explain: A criminal case is brought by the prosecution against a 
named defendant. In federal cases the prosecutor is the United States, and 
in state criminal cases the prosecutor is the state (often designated “The 
People” or sometimes “The Commonwealth”). The burden of proof is on 
the prosecution, and the standard of proof is “beyond a reasonable doubt,” 
which is a very high standard indeed.
In a civil suit, the case is brought by the victim or the victim’s family, which 
bears the burden of proof but on a much lower standard. The burden of 
proof is to demonstrate that a “preponderance of the evidence” indicates the 
defendant did the deed, which just means that it’s more likely than not.

237
 Chapter 17: Taking the Fifth — and a Bit of the Fourteenth
O.J. Simpson provides us with probably the best-known example of the differ-
ence between the two types of cases. Simpson was found not guilty of murder 
in a criminal trial but was later found liable for the death of his ex-wife Nicole 
Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman in a civil wrongful death suit.
Jeopardizing “life or limb”
The Fifth Amendment clause on double jeopardy talks about being “put in 
jeopardy of life or limb.” What’s with this “life or limb” business? You may 
interpret that to mean that double jeopardy applies only to really serious 
crimes. “Life” refers to the death penalty. But “limb” refers to old-fashioned 
punishments such as the stocks — a wooden frame used to torture and humil-
iate criminals found guilty of even quite minor offenses. So double jeopardy 
covers misdemeanors as well as felonies.
In general, what this clause means is that you can’t be tried twice for the 
same offense, no matter whether you were found guilty or acquitted the first 
time around.
Agonizing over Due Process
If the courts have made a meal of double jeopardy, they have made a 
gargantuan, indigestible, multi-course banquet of due process. The Fifth 
Amendment wording goes like this:
No person shall be . . . deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due 
process of law.
This wording was picked up in the Fourteenth Amendment, ratified in 1868 
during the Reconstruction period just after the Civil War:
nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without 
due process of law.
Why was it necessary for due process to be repeated in the Fourteenth 
Amendment when it was already included in the Fifth Amendment? The Fifth 
deals with federal law, and the Fourteenth with the states. Other than that 
difference, the Due Process clauses in the two amendments are practically 
identical.

238
Part IV: The Bill of Rights: Specifying Rights through Amendments 
Trying to define the term
What does due process mean, anyway? In 1884, the Supreme Court defined 
due process really broadly. Ready for a mouthful?
[A]ny legal proceeding enforced by public authority, whether sanctioned by 
age and custom, or newly devised in the discretion of the legislative power, 
in furtherance of the general public good, which regards and preserves these 
principles of liberty and justice, must be held to be due process of law.
 
Let me help you out: Due process is really just an old-fashioned way of saying 
“proper procedure.” The Due Process clauses in both amendments originally 
meant no more and no less than this: You can’t be executed, imprisoned, 
or fined, or have your property confiscated, except after a fair trial con-
ducted according to proper legal procedure. As Supreme Court Justice Felix 
Frankfurter put it: “The history of American freedom is, in no small measure, 
the history of procedure.”
The next question is, what exactly is proper legal procedure? In 1914, the 
U.S. Supreme Court gave a short answer to this important question: “The 
fundamental requisite of due process of law is the opportunity to be heard.” 
This explanation may seem too narrow, but it happens to be one of the two 
principles of natural justice that have come down to us from antiquity (the 
other being the rule against bias, which is covered by the Sixth Amendment). 
Natural justice is a philosophy that says that God or nature has laid down 
certain moral standards that form the basis of civilized society. Thomas 
Jefferson was strongly influenced by this philosophy. This influence is clear 
in the Declaration of Independence, of which Jefferson was the main author. 
(I discuss the Declaration of Independence in Chapter 2.)
Triggering due process
Two important questions emerge:
 
✓ What’s needed to trigger a due process claim?
 
✓ How much due process is actually due?
Let’s consider an example. A security guard in Cleveland wrote on his job 
application that he’d never been convicted of a felony. He got the job. But it 
turned out that he’d been convicted of grand larceny, which sure is a felony. 
(The guard claimed he thought it was only a misdemeanor!) He was fired 
without being given an opportunity to explain or defend himself.

239
 Chapter 17: Taking the Fifth — and a Bit of the Fourteenth
In 1985, the U.S. Supreme Court heard the case. It concluded that, because 
this man’s employment could be terminated only “for cause,” this meant that 
it was a property right within the Fourteenth Amendment, which triggered 
due process. But the extent of due process due to him was only the right to 
be heard before dismissal — not anything more. What does this example 
mean? Essentially two things:
 
✓ The word “property” in the Due Process clauses of the Fifth and 
Fourteenth amendments has a very broad meaning. It can even include 
possession of a job.
 
✓ There’s a whole range of due process rights. The issue is decided on a 
case-by-case basis, which makes sense but which also makes it difficult 
to predict what a court will decide in any particular situation.
At the beginning of this section I asked, “What’s needed to trigger a due pro-
cess claim?” Back in 1855, the U.S. Supreme Court said that in order to deter-
mine whether a process is due process or not, the court must “examine the 
Constitution itself, to see whether this process be in conflict with any of its 
provisions.” An unfair trial, for example, is always contrary to due process. In 
addition, there are some rights that do not appear to be connected with due 
process but are now regarded by the U.S. Supreme Court as protected by due 
process:
 
✓ Privacy
 
✓ Contraception
 
✓ Abortion
These all belong to substantive due process, which I discuss next.
Wrestling with substantive due process
Due process is about procedure, right? Right. But a significant body of judi-
cial opinion indicates that it can also be about the substance of a law. The 
doctrine of substantive due process, which emerged as early as the mid-19th 
century, says that due process is not just about how something should be 
done but also what should be done.
Substantive due process has undergone some important changes. Justice 
Hugo Black, who always opposed substantive due process of any kind, par-
ticularly criticized the old-style approach to due process. In Black’s words, 
this approach “authorizes courts to hold laws unconstitutional when they 
believe the legislature has acted unwisely. . . .” In other words, the courts 
gave themselves the right to second-guess Congress. If the Supreme Court 

240
Part IV: The Bill of Rights: Specifying Rights through Amendments 
thought Congress had passed a law that the court didn’t agree with, the court 
declared that law unconstitutional. Black opposed this approach because he 
believed it was unconstitutional for the courts to “substitute their social and 
economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies, who are elected to 
pass laws.”
 
Substantive due process greatly expanded the power of the courts — 
especially the U.S. Supreme Court. The doctrine gave the courts the power 
to examine not only the procedure used to enforce a law but also the actual 
content of the law.
Noting some famous early cases
Possibly the earliest use of substantive due process was in the notorious Dred 
Scott case in 1856. Dred Scott was a slave who had moved with his master to 
various free states and territories. At that time, certain states were designated 
as slave states and others as free. Dred Scott claimed that after he’d breathed 
the free air of Illinois, he became a free man and couldn’t then be reduced to 
slavery again on return to a slave state. This claim was rejected by the U.S. 
Supreme Court, which held that the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause 
protected a slave owner from being deprived of his property — including his 
slaves — just because he’d brought it into a free state.
The 1905 case Lochner v. New York put substantive due process on the map. 
In those days, journeymen bakers worked very long hours in unhygienic con-
ditions, often in basements. New York State passed the Bakeshop Act of 1895 
limiting work to a maximum of 10 hours a day or 60 hours per week. Joseph 
Lochner owned a small bakery and was fined $50 because one of his employ-
ees had worked more than 60 hours in a particular week.
After losing two appeals before the New York courts, Lochner took his case 
to the U.S. Supreme Court. He argued successfully that the Bakeshop Act was 
contrary to the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because it 
infringed on Lochner’s “liberty of contract.” The Bakeshop Act was struck down 
as unconstitutional. This is an example of substantive due process because it 
addresses the fact that certain rights we hold cannot be taken away from us — 
in this case, Lochner’s right to enter into contracts with his employees.
Lochner gave its name to an era because for the next 32 years, a conservative 
brand of substantive due process dominated the Supreme Court. State laws 
setting minimum wages; banning child labor; or regulating the banking, insur-
ance, or transportation industries were declared unconstitutional on the 
basis of substantive due process.
Threatening the New Deal
This trend reached a climax during Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal. In 
a radio fireside chat, FDR said that the Constitution was “so simple and prac-
tical that it can always meet extraordinary needs.” But the President hadn’t 

241
 Chapter 17: Taking the Fifth — and a Bit of the Fourteenth
reckoned with the Supreme Court. After initially accepting some New Deal 
legislation, the court struck down the provisions of Roosevelt’s economic 
recovery program one by one. The cases threatened doom for the New Deal, 
which had been endorsed by an unprecedented proportion of the popular 
vote in the 1932 election.
FDR wasn’t about to allow a bunch of unelected judges to trample the New 
Deal. He condemned the court for reverting to “the horse-and-buggy defini-
tion of interstate commerce” and came up with a novel plan to counter the 
judges. Cleverly using the Constitution against the court itself, he proposed 
to increase the size of the Supreme Court — which was not fixed by the 
Constitution — by adding one new justice (up to a maximum of six) for every 
justice over the age of 70, plus up to 44 new lower court judges.
FDR was met with a barrage of criticism for this bold plan. Even the liberal 
justices on the Supreme Court, who mostly supported the New Deal, were up 
in arms. But the mere announcement of the proposal was enough to achieve 
the desired effect. In 1937, in an apparent bow to FDR, the court upheld a 
Washington state minimum wage law that was practically identical to one 
declared unconstitutional just a year before. The court similarly upheld the 
constitutionality of the National Labor Relations Board Act, which created an 
agency charged with investigating claims of unfair labor practices.
The conservative economic phase of substantive due process was over.
Reemerging in recent decades
In 1965, a new-style substantive due process doctrine appeared thanks to 
Griswold v. Connecticut. The question before the U.S. Supreme Court was 
the constitutionality of an “uncommonly silly law” (as Justice Potter Stewart 
called it) banning contraceptives. The court held that it was unconstitutional. 
Justice William O. Douglas wrote that though the law in question did not 
exactly breach any express right in the Bill of Rights, it offended against a 
right of privacy.
But Justice John Marshall Harlan put the matter firmly on the basis of the 
Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. He wrote:
In my view, the proper constitutional inquiry in this case is whether this 
Connecticut statute infringes the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth 
Amendment . . . I believe that it does.
Justice Hugo Black disagreed with Harlan’s broad application of the 
Fourteenth Amendment, arguing that even if the Supreme Court believes that 
certain laws are “unreasonable, unwise, arbitrary, capricious or irrational,” 
the court shouldn’t have such broad authority to strike down those laws. 
Otherwise, the court would have too much power, which would “jeopardize 
the separation of governmental powers that the Framers set up and . . . 
threaten to take away much of the power of States to govern themselves. . . .”

242
Part IV: The Bill of Rights: Specifying Rights through Amendments 
Despite Black’s dissent, the new-style substantive due process doctrine 
continued to gain ground, most notably in Roe v. Wade (1973), which struck 
down two antiabortion state laws. The argument put forward by Justice 
Harry Blackmun, writing for the majority, was that a woman’s right to choose 
is based on her right of privacy, which in turn is based on the Due Process 
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Continuing to stoke controversy
Today, some Supreme Court justices, notably Antonin Scalia and Clarence 
Thomas, argue against substantive due process, which Scalia has called an 
oxymoron. In 1994, he wrote that “the Due Process Clause guarantees no sub-
stantive rights, but only (as it says) process.”
The accepted position is probably still that expressed by Chief Justice 
William Rehnquist in 1997: acceptance of substantive due process within 
closely defined limits. But I have no doubt that the court will continue to 
wrestle with the issue of whether the Constitution permits courts to create or 
take away rights under the auspices of substantive due process.
Opening Up the Incorporation Debate
Before the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, the U.S. Supreme Court 
understood that the Bill of Rights applied only to federal law and not to the 
states. But the Fourteenth Amendment changed that understanding for some 
people, and it opened a can of worms that clogged the legal system for quite 
some time.
Does the Bill of Rights apply to the states?
Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black, who served the court from 1937 to 1971, 
argued that the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment — the section that 
deals with due process — incorporates the bulk of the first eight amendments 
to the Constitution, making all those guarantees of the Bill of Rights binding 
on the states as well as on the federal government. In other words, because 
the Fourteenth Amendment mentions due process as a protection under 
state law, it also provides protection under state law for freedom of speech 
and the right to bear arms; against unwarranted search and seizure, self-
incrimination, and double jeopardy; and for all the other provisions included 
in the Bill of Rights.
Black prided himself on taking every word of the Constitution at face value. 
“The Constitution is my legal bible,” he would say, referring to the well-
thumbed copy that he kept on him at all times. “I cherish every word of it 
from the first to the last.”

243
 Chapter 17: Taking the Fifth — and a Bit of the Fourteenth
 
But here’s the flaw with Black’s argument: The Fifth Amendment guarantees 
due process as one of several separate rights. Nothing in the Fifth Amendment 
suggests that due process encompasses all the other rights contained in that 
amendment, let alone in the whole of the Bill of Rights. So why should due pro-
cess in the Fourteenth Amendment be any different?
If due process in the Fifth Amendment had an all-embracing nature, this fact 
would surely have been indicated by the wording. Instead, it’s listed as one of 
several guarantees, each on the same level as the others.
If the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment had wanted to incorporate all 
of the Bill of Rights guarantees, they could easily have listed them or oth-
erwise indicated that those rights were to be applicable to the states as 
well as to the federal government. Instead, the Due Process Clause of the 
Fifth Amendment is the only provision in the Bill of Rights repeated in the 
Fourteenth Amendment.
There is a rule of interpretation that lawyers use, known in Latin as expres-
sio unius est exclusio alterius, or “the expression of one thing amounts to the 
exclusion of another.” When a kid asks, “Mommy, can I have some cake?” and 
the reply comes back “You may have a cookie,” this means not only what it 
says (expressio unius) but also that the kid is not allowed any cake (exclu-
sio alterius). In the Constitution, the specific mention of due process in the 
Fourteenth Amendment amounts to an exclusion of all the other guarantees 
referred to in the Bill of Rights.
Watching selective incorporation in action
The Supreme Court didn’t buy Justice Black’s total incorporation approach to 
due process. Instead, it adopted the slightly less extreme doctrine of selective 
incorporation. The Supreme Court considered the merits of a variety of cases 
that dealt with whether the Fourteenth Amendment made the entire Bill of 
Rights applicable under state law, and it made decisions on a case-by-case 
basis.
The result is that the court gradually broadened its interpretation of the 
Fourteenth Amendment until the bulk of the guarantees of the Bill of Rights 
were accepted as being binding on the states as well as the federal government.
It is commonly said that essentially the whole of the Bill of Rights is now incor-
porated against the states. However, that is not the case. The true position is 
much messier. Some amendments in the Bill of Rights are recognized by the 
high court as completely incorporated; others as partly incorporated; and 
others again as not incorporated at all. This patchwork is in itself a strong 
argument against the whole incorporation doctrine. If the drafters of the 
Fourteenth Amendment really intended their Due Process Clause to have such 

244
Part IV: The Bill of Rights: Specifying Rights through Amendments 
an uneven effect on the Bill of Rights, how could they have expected that inten-
tion to be understood from a reading of the amendment? There is absolutely 
no indication in the text of the Fourteenth Amendment of any incorporation 
whatsoever. So why should we not just accept that as being the true position?
Here’s a breakdown of the parts of the Bill of Rights that the high court now 
recognizes as incorporated:
 
✓ First Amendment: Completely incorporated; see Chapter 14.
 
✓ Second Amendment: Not recognized as incorporated. However, the 
2008 Supreme Court ruling in D.C. v. Heller has made the question of the 
incorporation of this amendment a live issue, and several applications 
have been filed in federal court to get the Second Amendment incorpo-
rated. See Chapter 15 for more.
 
✓ Third Amendment: Not recognized as incorporated. The possible 
incorporation of this amendment has never been considered by the 
high court. But, in the 1982 case of Engblom v. Carey, the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the Second Circuit accepted that this amendment applied to 
the states. See Chapter 16.
 
✓ Fourth Amendment: Completely incorporated; see Chapter 16.
 
✓ Fifth Amendment: Completely incorporated, except for the right to 
indictment by a grand jury, as decided by the high court in 1884 in 
Hurtado v. California. Justice Stanley Matthews, writing for the major-
ity, pointed out that, as the Fifth Amendment contains both a right to 
due process and a right to grand jury indictment, the one cannot be 
included in the other. So the absence of any mention of grand juries in 
the Fourteenth Amendment must mean that that right does not apply to 
the states. See Chapter 17.
 
✓ Sixth Amendment: Completely incorporated; see Chapter 18.
 
✓ Seventh Amendment: Not recognized as incorporated. This amendment 
guarantees the right to jury trial in civil suits. In the 1974 case of Curtis v. 
Loether, a civil rights case, the high court specifically refused to rule on 
whether the Seventh Amendment was incorporated, especially in civil 
rights cases. See Chapter 18.
 
✓ Eighth Amendment: The prohibition against “cruel and unusual punish-
ments” is recognized by the high court as incorporated. However, the 
high court has never ruled on whether the prohibitions of “excessive 
bail” and “excessive fines” are incorporated. See Chapter 18.
 
✓ Ninth and Tenth amendments: Not incorporated. It is commonly 
assumed that, although these two amendments form part of the Bill of 
Rights, they do not specifically confer any rights. For a discussion of 
these amendments, see Chapter 19.

245
 Chapter 17: Taking the Fifth — and a Bit of the Fourteenth
Note: Those parts of the Bill of Rights that are not regarded as incorporated 
apply only to federal law. But some of them do apply to the states anyway — 
by virtue of state law. Prohibition of excessive bail is an example of this, as 
it’s found in every state constitution.
 
What about reverse incorporation? Some commentators have suggested that 
the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which applies 
specifically to the states, should be read as applying also to the federal 
government through incorporation into the Due Process Clause of the Fifth 
Amendment. Whew! That is not the law at present, and the U.S. Supreme Court 
has never ruled on it.
Taking Private Property
The last part of the Fifth Amendment hasn’t clogged the courts to quite the 
extent due process has done, but it has generated its share of heated contro-
versy. It reads as follows:
nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just 
compensation.
The Blaine Amendment: A compelling
argument against incorporation
The framers of the Fourteenth Amendment 
didn’t understand it as incorporating the bulk of 
the Bill of Rights. How do we know this? James 
G. Blaine proposed a new amendment to the 
Constitution mirroring the first clause of the First 
Amendment but applying it to the states. Instead 
of starting “Congress shall make no law . . .,” 
the Blaine Amendment began, “No State shall 
make any law respecting an establishment of 
religion . . . .”
Blaine proposed his new amendment in 1875 — 
just seven years after the ratification of the 
Fourteenth Amendment. If Blaine’s proposed 
amendment was already sitting inside the 
Fourteenth Amendment, there would have been 
no need for Blaine to propose it. Was Blaine just 
plain ignorant of the Fourteenth Amendment? No, 
sirree. He was one of the most influential mem-
bers of the House of Representatives, one of the 
framers of the Fourteenth Amendment, and then 
Speaker! He wouldn’t have gone to all the trouble 
of putting the Establishment Clause of the First 
Amendment (the first clause, which refers to “an 
establishment of religion”) into a new amendment 
applicable to the states if the First Amendment 
already applied to the states by “incorporation.” 
This is perhaps the strongest argument against 
the whole incorporation theory.

246
Part IV: The Bill of Rights: Specifying Rights through Amendments 
Recognizing eminent domain
This clause is intended to offer protection to property owners, but it also rec-
ognizes the absolute right of the government to take private property. This 
had been the case for hundreds of years under English law, and earlier under 
Roman law. In the words of the famous Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius, written in 
1625, “the property of subjects is under the eminent domain of the state.” 
That is why U.S. law uses the term eminent domain to refer to the right of the 
government to take private property.
 
The taking of private property can only be “for public use,” and the definition 
of this phrase has been highly controversial. At first it was narrowly defined, 
referring to use by the public, as for example the taking of someone’s home to 
build or widen a roadway. But the U.S. Supreme Court has broadened the defi-
nition considerably.
Losing protection
In 1954, the Supreme Court heard a case about a department store that the 
District of Columbia wanted to take possession of and hand over to a private 
agency for redevelopment for private use. Because the private agency was 
redeveloping a larger area surrounding the department store with the inten-
tion of removing slum properties, the court refused to interfere with the rede-
velopment project. The justices argued that the project had to be looked at as 
a whole. If the success of the larger project depended on clearing a non-slum 
property such as the department store, that was an acceptable casualty.
 
In 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court went even further. It ruled that local gov-
ernments could take private homes and businesses against the wishes of 
their owners and hand the property over to private developers of shopping 
malls and hotel complexes. Writing for the liberal majority, Justice John Paul 
Stevens held that local officials knew better than federal judges what was 
good for their communities. He also recognized that the states could, if they 
wished, pass laws granting property owners more rights than under the U.S. 
Constitution.
The conservative members of the court, and swing-voter Justice Sandra Day 
O’Connor, registered a strong dissent. “Any property may now be taken for 
the benefit of another private party,” wrote O’Connor, “but the fallout from 
this decision will not be random. The beneficiaries are likely to be those 
citizens with disproportionate influence and power in the political process, 
including large corporations and development firms.”
The 2005 decision was greeted with dismay across the nation, and in 2006 no 
fewer than 34 states adopted some form of eminent domain reform in order 
to minimize the effects of the judgment.

Individual Rights: The Sixth 
through Eighth Amendments
In This Chapter
▶ Recognizing the rights of criminal defendants
▶ Identifying the requirements of a fair trial
▶ Understanding the importance of juries in criminal and civil trials
▶ Explaining “cruel and unusual punishments”
T
he Sixth through Eighth amendments of the Constitution are part of the 
Bill of Rights, the unofficial name that belongs to the first ten amend-
ments, collectively, which were all ratified together on December 15, 1791.
Amendments six through eight do not have the glamour or pizzazz of the 
First Amendment, the Fifth, or even the Fourteenth. But amendments six 
through eight are still pretty important. Here’s a brief summary:
 
✓ The Sixth Amendment guarantees a fair trial to defendants in a crimi-
nal prosecution, including the right to a jury trial and the assistance of 
counsel.
 
✓ The Seventh Amendment guarantees the right to trial by jury in civil 
trials.
 
✓ The Eighth Amendment is best known for banning “cruel and unusual 
punishments.”
I discuss all three amendments in this chapter.

Part IV: The Bill of Rights: Specifying Rights through Amendments 
Outlining Defendants’ Rights in Criminal 
Prosecutions: The Sixth Amendment
The Sixth Amendment is quite a mouthful (see the Appendix). It contains no 
fewer than eight rights applicable to “all criminal prosecutions.” Here are the 
rights that this article guarantees to a defendant in a criminal prosecution:
 
✓ The right to a speedy trial
 
✓ The right to a public trial
 
✓ The right to a trial by an impartial jury from the district where the crime 
was committed
 
✓ The right to be informed of the nature of the accusation
 
✓ The right to be informed of the cause of the accusation
 
✓ The right to be confronted with the witnesses against him
 
✓ The right to compel the attendance of witnesses in his favor
 
✓ The right to be represented by counsel
This list of rights looks pretty comprehensive, but it raises quite a few ques-
tions, including these:
 
✓ Do these eight rights really apply to “all criminal prosecutions,” as the 
Sixth Amendment says? Do they apply to prosecutions for misdemean-
ors as well as to felonies, and to state and federal prosecutions alike?
 
✓ How speedy must a speedy trial be?
 
✓ Why is a public trial necessary?
 
✓ What exactly is meant by “an impartial jury,” and how can it be 
guaranteed?
 
✓ What exactly is meant by the “cause of the accusation”?
 
✓ Why is it a right for a defendant to be confronted by the witnesses 
against him?
 
✓ How can witnesses be compelled to attend?
 
✓ Is the right to be represented by counsel a general right? What if the 
defendant can’t afford it? And what if a defendant wants to defend him-
self? Does he have the right to do so?
I tackle each of these questions in turn.

249
 Chapter 18: Dealing with Justice and Individual Rights
Having the same rights in 
a state and federal trial
The opening words of the Sixth Amendment state categorically that all the 
rights guaranteed in that amendment apply “[i]n all criminal prosecutions.” 
But is that really true?
The Bill of Rights originally applied only to federal law, but the U.S. Supreme 
Court has gradually incorporated more and more of its provisions into the 
Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which applies to the 
states. I discuss the whole incorporation debate in Chapter 17.
 
As of now, the whole of the Sixth Amendment is accepted as incorporated 
in this way. So the rights listed in the Sixth Amendment do apply to state 
prosecutions as well as to federal prosecutions (with some exceptions). The 
crucial case in applying the amendment to state prosecutions was Duncan v. 
Louisiana, decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1968.
Gary Duncan, a 19-year-old African American, was charged with slapping a 
white youth in Louisiana. In law this offense is a misdemeanor called simple 
battery. Under Louisiana state law, jury trial is not available for misdemeanors. 
Duncan was convicted and sentenced to a fine of $150 and 60 days in jail. He 
took his case to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1968 on the ground that the state had 
violated his right to a jury trial under the Sixth and Fourteenth amendments.
Duncan won big-time. The Supreme Court ruled that the right to trial by jury 
in criminal cases is fundamental and central to the American concept of 
justice. So the right to a jury trial applies to the states as well as to federal 
courts — except for “petty crimes” whose maximum possible punishment is 
a $500 fine and six months jail time.
The Supreme Court held that the whole of the Sixth Amendment was incor-
porated into the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that 
all the rights enumerated in the Sixth Amendment are therefore available in 
state courts as well as in federal courts.
How speedy is a speedy trial?
“Justice delayed is justice denied.” This old saying puts the importance of a 
speedy trial in a nutshell. Delaying a trial means that the accusation hangs 
over the defendant until the case comes to court. In the meantime, witnesses’ 
memories can become increasingly unreliable, and some witnesses may dis-
appear or even die.

250
Part IV: The Bill of Rights: Specifying Rights through Amendments 
If a guilty defendant has posted bail, he can commit more crimes during a 
long wait for his trial. So the right to a speedy trial is not only in the interest 
of defendants; it also protects society. And if a defendant can’t make bail, 
he has to sit in jail until his trial; a long wait is unfair to him and adds to the 
overcrowding of the prisons.
In 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court identified four factors that must be tested to 
decide whether there has been a violation of the right to a speedy trial:
 
✓ The length of the delay: The court held that a delay of a year or more 
from the date of arrest can usually be presumed to violate the defen-
dant’s right to a speedy trial, but the court declined to set any definite 
limit. The court held instead that this issue has to be decided on a 
case-by-case basis.
 
✓ The reason for the delay: Here, the court proposed a sliding scale. “A 
deliberate attempt to delay the trial in order to hamper the defense 
should be weighted heavily against the government,” it determined. At 
the other extreme, “a valid reason, such as a missing witness, should 
serve to justify appropriate delay.”
 
✓ The defendant’s assertion of his right to a speedy trial: Does a defen-
dant lose his right to a speedy trial if he doesn’t assert this right? No, 
but “failure to assert the right will make it difficult for a defendant to 
prove that he was denied a speedy trial.”
 
✓ Prejudice to the defendant: The Supreme Court identified three factors 
that would likely prejudice (or harm) the interests of the defendant, 
including “oppressive pretrial incarceration” and “the possibility that 
the defense will be impaired.”
Appreciating the need for a public trial
“Justice must not only be done but must be seen to be done.” It would be 
hard to disagree with this old saying. If you don’t know what went on in a 
trial, how can you be sure that it was fair?
U.S. courtrooms have always been open to the public, and now many trials 
are even televised, which may not always be a good thing. For example, O.J. 
Simpson’s murder trial in 1995 turned into a media circus. But whether a trial 
should be televised or not is a different question from whether it should be 
open to the public.

251
 Chapter 18: Dealing with Justice and Individual Rights
 
Is a trial behind closed doors ever justified? If the evidence is so sensitive that 
it would be dangerous for the evidence to be published, yes. Also, if one of the 
parties files a motion of closure (meaning the trial should be conducted in pri-
vate), the judge has to decide whether to grant the motion. Closure may be 
allowed in cases involving organized crime or rape and is routinely ordered in 
juvenile cases.
It’s important to realize that the question of public trials affects rights not 
only under the Sixth Amendment but may also implicate First Amendment 
rights of freedom of speech and freedom of the press. I discuss the First 
Amendment in Chapter 14.
Guaranteeing trial by jury
Trial by jury is an important constitutional right, which can be traced back to 
Magna Carta in 1215 (see Chapter 2).
 
Courts have always treated petty offenses as an exception to the right to trial 
by jury. Petty offenses are those that carry a sentence of not more than six 
months in jail or a fine of not more than $500, or both.
What if a defendant is charged at the same trial with a number of petty 
offences, so that his total jail time could exceed six months? In 1996, the U.S. 
Supreme Court said that a trial for multiple petty offenses would not trigger 
the right to a jury trial.
Selecting an impartial jury
The Sixth Amendment says that criminal defendants have the right to trial 
by “an impartial jury.” But is this really a right that defendants are likely to 
claim? Aren’t they more likely to want juries that are favorably disposed 
toward them — just as prosecutors prefer juries that are more likely to con-
vict? Of course. Maybe the Framers were a bit naïve in this respect.
But, whether defendants want an impartial jury or not, the system is set 
up to deliver impartial juries, although it clearly doesn’t always succeed in 
doing so. The states compile lists of people who are eligible for jury service. 
A jury pool or a jury in waiting is summoned. The actual group of 12 jurors 
is selected from these potential jurors. The prosecution and the defense can 
challenge these potential jurors for cause, and both sides can also exercise a 
fixed number of peremptory challenges:

252
Part IV: The Bill of Rights: Specifying Rights through Amendments 
 
✓ Challenge for cause: Any potential juror can be challenged “for cause.” 
Examples of “cause” are bias against one party, acquaintance with a 
party or lawyer, and inability to serve as a juror. The judge and attor-
neys ask potential jurors a number of questions to find out more about 
them and whether there is some reason they should not serve on the 
jury. (The Simpsons poked fun at jury selection when Homer Simpson 
explained how he got out of jury duty: “The trick is to say you’re preju-
diced against all races.”)
 
✓ Peremptory challenge: Both parties also have the right to have a pre-
determined number of individual jurors excluded from the jury without 
“cause.” This is called a peremptory challenge and can generally be 
freely exercised by a lawyer. However, in 1986, in Batson v. Kentucky, the 
Supreme Court decided that a peremptory challenge could not be used 
to exclude jurors solely on grounds of race. In other words, a lawyer 
could not “stack” the jury with members of a certain race. Chief Justice 
Warren Burger dissented, arguing that the majority decision effectively 
abolished peremptory challenge, “a procedure which has been part 
of the common law for many centuries and part of our jury system for 
nearly 200 years.”
So important is jury selection that lawyers increasingly hire jury consultants 
in high profile or high stakes cases. A jury consultant can charge hundreds 
of thousands of dollars to pick the right jury for the side that has hired him 
or her. An apparently innocuous question put to prospective jurors can pay 
dividends to the perceptive analyst. Prospective jurors may be asked, “Who 
is your favorite person?” If your answer is Cher, according to jury consultant 
Howard Varinsky, “It says you’re not very bright.” Does that mean that such 
a person should not be selected for the jury? Not at all. Says Varinsky: If the 
case involves complex information that is unfavorable to your side, a juror 
who doesn’t understand the information could be a plus. This statement 
echoes the cynical comment made by the humorist Dave Barry: “If you are 
accused of a crime, you have the right to a trial before a jury of people too 
stupid to get out of jury duty.”
Recognizing the importance of juries
You should never underestimate the importance of jury trials in the whole 
constitutional framework. The role of the jury is as the finder of fact. The 
judge advises the jury on the law that should be applied to those facts. But 
the jury’s verdict decides whether the defendant is guilty or not guilty.
The power of juries has increased in recent years. For example, in Ring v. 
Arizona, heard in 2002, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that only a jury was 
allowed to determine whether there were aggravating factors necessary for 
imposing the death penalty. This decision struck down the rule in Arizona 
and some other states that allowed judges to make this determination.

253
 Chapter 18: Dealing with Justice and Individual Rights
Juries are not usually informed of another power that they have long had: 
jury nullification. The judge is supposed to instruct the jury on the law, and 
the jury is supposed to accept the judge’s instructions. But in practice juries 
have long reserved the right to ignore the law and to act according to their 
consciences. This is called jury nullification. During Prohibition, for example, 
juries often refused to convict defendants charged under the alcohol control 
laws. This resistance may well have contributed to the repeal of Prohibition 
by the Twenty-First Amendment.
Most judges are not too happy about jury nullification. In a 1988 case, a judge 
who was asked by the jury about jury nullification replied, “There is no such 
thing as valid jury nullification.” In 1997, the Second Circuit held that a juror 
who intended to nullify the law could be dismissed from the jury panel. But 
perhaps the last word should go to Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, 
who described juries as “the spinal column of American democracy.”
Being “informed of the nature 
and cause of the accusation”
A fair criminal justice system must let an accused person know exactly what 
charges he or she is facing. An indictment is normally based on a statute — a 
law passed by Congress or a state legislature. It is essential in the interests 
of justice that the statute is clear. If it isn’t clear, it can be declared void for 
uncertainty or void for vagueness, and therefore unconstitutional. The tests 
for vagueness include the following:
 
✓ Is it clear which persons fall within the scope of the statute?
 
✓ Does the statute alert those persons who are subject to it?
 
✓ Are there safeguards against the arbitrary or discriminatory application 
of this statute?
 
✓ What conduct does the statute prohibit?
 
✓ What punishment does the statute impose?
But clarity in the law itself is not enough. The indictment may have to go 
beyond the words of the statute and “must descend to particulars,” as the 
U.S. Supreme Court held in United States v. Cruikshank in 1875.
Confronting adverse witnesses
Why does the Sixth Amendment guarantee the right of criminal defendants to 
confront the witnesses giving evidence against them? The alternative would 

254
Part IV: The Bill of Rights: Specifying Rights through Amendments 
be to allow witnesses’ statements to go unchallenged, which is not fair unless 
the statement is uncontroversial and is accepted by both sides.
The principle that criminal defendants must be allowed to confront their 
accusers dates back to the revulsion at the way Sir Walter Raleigh was 
treated in his treason trial in 1603. Raleigh was not allowed to question the 
witnesses against him, whose signed statements had been extracted under 
torture.
The right to cross-examine your accusers is important for several reasons:
 
✓ It enables skillful counsel to confront witnesses with inconsistencies in 
their evidence.
 
✓ It may even result in a witness being caught in a lie.
 
✓ It gives the jury a view of the demeanor of the witness — including the 
witness’ body language, which can be revealing.
 
Child witnesses or other vulnerable witnesses may be allowed to give their 
evidence in the judge’s chambers without being cross-examined. This situa-
tion is the main exception to the rule stated in the Sixth Amendment.
Compelling witnesses to attend
If a witness supports your case, that witness will surely be only too happy to 
come to court to give evidence in your favor, right? Unfortunately not. Too 
many people are afraid of appearing in court, or just can’t be bothered. So it’s 
necessary to be able to compel them to attend. This is done by serving such 
a witness with a subpoena — a formal document issued by the court ordering 
the witness to appear in court to give evidence at a certain time and place. 
The reason this procedure is called a subpoena — from the Latin, mean-
ing “subject to penalty” — is that a witness who disobeys the order may be 
found guilty of a contempt of court, for which the penalty can be jail.
Demanding the right to counsel
The Sixth Amendment says that “In all criminal prosecutions, the accused 
shall . . . have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.” In 1968, the 
U.S. Supreme Court decided that the whole of the Sixth Amendment was 

255
 Chapter 18: Dealing with Justice and Individual Rights
incorporated into the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In 
other words, all the rights enumerated in the Sixth Amendment apply to the 
states as well as to federal courts.
However, the right to counsel has not always been recognized by the courts. 
In Betts v. Brady, the Supreme Court decided in 1942 that criminal defen-
dants in state courts could not claim legal representation unless there were 
“special circumstances” in their cases — for example, if they were facing the 
death penalty.
Betts is one of the few Supreme Court cases that have been overruled by a 
later Supreme Court decision. This overruling happened in the landmark case 
Gideon v. Wainwright, heard by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1963. The court 
held that the right to counsel in the Sixth Amendment was indeed incorpo-
rated into the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and did 
therefore apply to state trials as well as to trials in federal court.
 
In an equally famous case, Miranda v. Arizona, heard in 1966, the U.S. Supreme 
Court went further, holding that “The right to have counsel present at the 
interrogation is indispensable to the protection of the Fifth Amendment privi-
lege” against self-incrimination. As a result of this holding, the right to counsel 
at public expense is now incorporated into the Miranda warning routinely 
given to suspects by police officers:
You have the right to remain silent. . . You have the right to speak to an 
attorney, and to have an attorney present during any questioning. If you 
cannot afford a lawyer, one will be provided for you at government expense.
But what if a criminal defendant doesn’t want legal representation? In 1975 
the U.S. Supreme Court held that it is in keeping with the Sixth Amendment 
for a defendant to represent himself: “A knowing and intelligent waiver” of 
the right to counsel “must be honored out of that respect for the individual 
which is the lifeblood of the law.”
However, in Martinez v. Court of Appeals of California, decided in 2000, the 
U.S. Supreme Court denied the right of a criminal defendant to conduct his 
own appeal against a conviction. The court held that the Sixth Amendment 
right to represent yourself applies to trials but not to appeals.
 
It’s hard to understand the justification for making this distinction. The Sixth 
Amendment guarantees rights, but in Martinez the Supreme Court appears to 
have treated a right as if it were an obligation. This is a serious logical error. 
If you’re playing Who Wants to be a Millionaire, you have the right to phone a 
friend; you don’t have an obligation to do so.

256
Part IV: The Bill of Rights: Specifying Rights through Amendments 
Guaranteeing Jury Trials in Civil Suits: 
The Seventh Amendment
The Seventh Amendment preserves an old right of trial by jury in certain civil 
suits. Here is what the amendment says:
In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty 
dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a 
jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than 
according to the rules of the common law.
The right to trial by jury in civil suits long predates the U.S. Constitution. It 
existed in English law from time immemorial, but it has been largely abol-
ished there. Thanks to the Seventh Amendment, jury trials in civil lawsuits 
are still alive and well in the United States.
 
The Seventh Amendment right does not extend to state courts because the 
U.S. Supreme Court does not regard the Seventh Amendment as incorporated 
into the Fourteenth Amendment by the Due Process Clause (see Chapter 17). 
However, most states have provisions for civil jury trials in their individual 
constitutions, so civil juries are alive and well in state courts too.
What’s with the emphasis on the common law in the Seventh Amendment? 
When this amendment was ratified in 1791, English law drew a distinction 
between common law and equity. Not only were the two types of law distinct, 
but there were separate law courts for each:
 
✓ Common law courts tried cases involving contract, tort, and many other 
types of lawsuits.
 
✓ Disputes involving wills, trusts, and real estate went to the courts of 
equity.
In the common law courts, jury trials were the norm, but in the courts of 
equity all trials were bench trials — heard by a judge sitting alone.
This pattern existed not only in England but also in the 13 American colonies, 
and it is reflected in the Seventh Amendment. Because jury trials were found 
only in common law suits, not in equity, the amendment preserves and per-
petuates this distinction.

257
 Chapter 18: Dealing with Justice and Individual Rights
 
This tradition sometimes results in tedious arguments. For example, in 
Chauffeurs, Teamsters & Helpers Local No. 391 v. Terry, heard in 1990, the U.S. 
Supreme Court had to decide whether a labor dispute would have been a suit 
“at common law” back in 1791. Justice William Brennan held that many of the 
legal rights available today cannot easily be classified in terms of the catego-
ries of English law of 200 years ago, and that modern U.S. judges are not quali-
fied to analyze the law in those terms. The right to trial by jury, he added, was 
too important to depend on such “needless and intractable excursions into 
increasingly unfamiliar territory.”
Prohibiting “Cruel and Unusual 
Punishments”: The Eighth Amendment
The Eighth Amendment is best known for banning “cruel and unusual punish-
ments,” but it also contains prohibitions against excessive bail and excessive 
fines. Here is the entire wording of the Eighth Amendment:
Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel 
and unusual punishments inflicted.
Banning excessive bail
After someone has been arrested and booked on suspicion of committing a 
crime, he or she appears before a judge for arraignment. The judge hears the 
charges and asks the accused person to enter a plea. If the plea is “not guilty,” 
a court date is set for the trial. But that date may be months or even years 
away. So the court has to decide whether to keep the accused person, or 
defendant, in jail or whether to allow him or her to go free until the trial date.
The bail system is intended to give a defendant an incentive to appear in 
court as required and not to skip town before the trial date. A defendant 
facing a murder charge is likely to be given bail of at least $500,000. But in 
order to post bail it’s usually necessary to pay only 10 percent of the bail 
amount up front. If the defendant duly shows up in court, the amount paid 
is refunded. (However, if a bail bondsman is used to post bail, he retains the 
10 percent of the bail amount paid to him as his fee.) If the defendant fails to 
appear in court, the whole amount of the bail has to be paid to the court.

258
Part IV: The Bill of Rights: Specifying Rights through Amendments 
The words “Excessive bail shall not be required” were lifted directly from the 
Virginia Constitution, which in turn comes straight from the English Bill of 
Rights of 1688. This formulation raises some questions:
 
✓ How much is “[e]xcessive”? You know from the news that celebrities 
and rich defendants are often required to pay very high amounts of bail, 
sometimes running into hundreds of thousands of dollars or even more. 
So, does the appropriate level of bail depend on the seriousness of the 
charge or on the resources of the accused person? The level of bail 
set should be just enough to ensure that the defendant in question will 
not skip town before his trial, but this amount is not easy to assess. If a 
defendant believes that he has been asked to post too much bail, he can 
apply to the court for a reduction.
 
✓ Does the Eighth Amendment mean that criminal defendants must always 
be given the opportunity to post bail? No. Where a defendant is facing 
a very serious charge like murder, bail can be denied. At the same time 
that Congress debated the Eight Amendment, it also considered the 
Judiciary Act, which defined which offenses were bailable and which 
were not bailable. As so often is the case, the words of the Constitution 
have to be read in conjunction with other legislation.
 
✓ Does the Eight Amendment allow “preventive detention” without bail? 
The U.S. Supreme Court answered yes to this question in United States 
v. Salerno in 1987. The court was deciding on the constitutionality of 
the Bail Reform Act of 1984. This law allows a federal court to detain an 
arrestee pending trial if the government shows that no release condi-
tions “will reasonably assure the safety of any other person and the 
community.” This provision goes way beyond any previous law that 
allowed denial of bail. Anthony Salerno was alleged to be a mafia boss, 
but the 1984 law is tailor-made for use against suspected terrorists. In 
the words of Chief Justice William Rehnquist, here are some factors that 
have to be considered in deciding whether to deny bail to an arrestee:
 
• “The nature and seriousness of the charges,
 
• The substantiality of the Government’s evidence against the 
arrestee,
 
• The arrestee’s background and characteristics, and
 
• The nature and seriousness of the danger posed by the suspect’s 
release.”
Removing excessive fines
The U.S. Supreme Court has generally taken a narrow view of the meaning of 
the word fines. In 1989, the court adopted the definition of fines that was cur-
rent when the Eighth Amendment was ratified in 1791: “The word ‘fine’ was 

259
 Chapter 18: Dealing with Justice and Individual Rights
understood to mean a payment to a sovereign [government] as punishment 
for some offense . . . The Excessive Fines Clause was intended to limit only 
those fines directly imposed by, and payable to, the government.”
 
However, in 1993 the court decided that an order for forfeiture of property 
could be considered a fine under the Eighth Amendment, though it declined to 
determine how much forfeiture would amount to an excessive fine.
Barring “cruel and unusual punishments”
The ban on the infliction of “cruel and unusual punishments” is one of the 
best-known provisions of the Constitution. This prohibition applies to state 
law as well as to federal law because the U.S. Supreme Court accepts it as 
incorporated by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (see 
Chapter 17). But what exactly is meant by this memorable phrase?
Understanding the importance of “and”
Does the word and have any significance? Does “cruel and unusual punish-
ments” have a different meaning from “cruel or unusual punishments”? The 
answer is yes. On this basis, the three strikes laws have been upheld: laws 
that allow courts to impose an extra-long jail sentence on anyone convicted 
of three felonies. This type of punishment sure was unusual, but it was held 
not to be cruel.
However, some three-strike cases make for worrying reading, like the 2003 
California case Lockyer v. Andrade. The theft of five videotapes was classified 
as a felony and, because the offender had a few prior convictions, he was 
sentenced to jail for 50 years to life. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that this 
sentence did not amount to cruel and unusual punishment.
Identifying some completely forbidden punishments
Here are some punishments that are completely forbidden:
 
✓ Torture: This term presumably includes the use of those old-time favor-
ites, the pillory, the rack, the stocks, and cutting off ears and limbs. The 
exact meaning of the prohibition on cruel and unusual punishments has 
been debated since the days of the Framers. In 1789, Representative 
Samuel Livermore said, “It is sometimes necessary to hang a man, vil-
lains often deserve whipping, and perhaps having their ears cut off; but 
are we in the future to be prevented from inflicting these punishments 
because they are cruel?” The answer was yes. In 1878, the U.S. Supreme 
Court in Wilkerson v. Utah ruled that all punishments “of unnecessary 
cruelty” were forbidden by the Eighth Amendment.

260
Part IV: The Bill of Rights: Specifying Rights through Amendments 
 
✓ Canceling the citizenship of a U.S. citizen: Albert Trop, a native-born 
U.S. citizen, escaped from an army stockade while serving in the U.S. 
Army in World War II. He was court-martialed, sentenced to three years 
at hard labor, and received a dishonorable discharge.
 
 Later, Trop applied for a passport and was denied on the grounds that 
his army desertion had stripped him of U.S. citizenship. In 1958, the U.S. 
Supreme Court branded this refusal “cruel and unusual punishment.” 
Chief Justice Earl Warren, writing for the majority, held that “denation-
alization” is “the total destruction of the individual’s status in society.” 
Pointing out that desertion from the army can be punishable by death, 
Justice Felix Frankfurter hit back in his dissent: Can it “be seriously 
urged that loss of citizenship is a fate worse than death?”
 
✓ Punishing someone for suffering from an illness: Drug addiction, for 
example, is an illness and should not be criminalized; the Supreme Court 
said so in Robinson v. California in 1962. But this decision put the court 
on a slippery slope, as the 1968 case of Powell v. Texas illustrates. In 
that case the majority of the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that criminalizing 
public drunkenness did not amount to cruel and unusual punishment. 
Where to draw the line? Justice Abe Fortas suggested this test: “criminal 
penalties may not be inflicted upon a person for being in a condition he 
is powerless to change.” On this basis, Fortas dissented in favor of the 
drunk in Powell. But is an alcoholic really powerless to change his condi-
tion? Alcoholics Anonymous might dissent from Abe Fortas!
 
✓ Punishments that are cruel and unusual because they’re excessive: 
Can a punishment be held to be cruel and unusual purely because it is 
regarded as excessive? Yes. This doctrine was first adopted by the U.S. 
Supreme Court back in 1910. In Coker v. Georgia, heard in 1977, the court 
held that the death penalty for the rape of an adult female was excessive 
and amounted to cruel and unusual punishment.
Debating the death penalty
When the Bill of Rights was ratified in 1791, capital punishment was com-
monplace and taken for granted. Nobody then thought that the death penalty 
could constitute “cruel and unusual punishments.” The Fifth Amendment 
refers to capital punishment no fewer than three times:
 
✓ No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous 
crime . . . A capital crime means one that carries the death penalty.
 
✓ nor shall any person be subject to the same offences to be twice put in jeop-
ardy of life or limb. The word life here refers again to the death penalty.
 
✓ Nor be deprived of life, liberty or property, without due process of law. Yep, 
the good ole Due Process Clause itself takes it for granted that you can 
be executed by due process.

261
 Chapter 18: Dealing with Justice and Individual Rights
The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, ratified in 1868, simi-
larly shows that capital punishment was still perfectly acceptable then:
nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without 
due process of law.
How could a state deprive anyone of his or her life by due process of law if 
the death penalty was unconstitutional? Obviously, it would be impossible.
In the case of Wilkerson v. Utah, heard in 1878, the U.S. Supreme Court made 
it clear that certain modes of execution did amount to cruel and unusual 
punishments, but others didn’t. Burning people alive at the stake, drawing 
and quartering, and disemboweling were all unconstitutional as cruel and 
unusual punishments. But death by firing squad — the form of execution 
used in Utah — was constitutionally acceptable.
The first real challenge to the death penalty as such occurred in Furman v. 
Georgia, heard by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1972 together with two other 
death penalty cases. By 5 votes to 4 the court overturned all three capital 
sentences. Only two justices (William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall) actu-
ally went so far as to declare that the death penalty by its very nature consti-
tuted cruel and unusual punishment. Three justices concurred in overturning 
the particular sentences under review but stopped well short of condemning 
capital punishment as being invariably and inescapably unconstitutional. 
Instead they focused on the arbitrariness and capriciousness with which the 
death penalty was imposed, especially as it tended to fall disproportionately 
on African Americans.
Only four years later the U.S. Supreme Court changed its position on capital 
punishment. The key case was Gregg v. Georgia, which was heard in 1976 
together with four other cases. The majority of the court held that
 
✓ The death penalty for murder does not in itself violate the Eighth and 
Fourteenth amendments.
 
✓ Capital punishment for murder can’t be unconstitutional because it was 
accepted by the Framers of the Constitution and has been accepted by 
the U.S. Supreme Court for 200 years.
 
✓ Retribution and deterrence are relevant considerations for sentencing.
 
✓ Capital punishment for murder is not disproportionate to the severity of 
the crime.
In recent years, Congress and 36 states have enacted new statutes providing 
for the death penalty. This fact seems to show that the death penalty is not 
contrary to contemporary standards of decency.
In 2008, the high court heard a landmark case on capital punishment called 
Baze v. Rees. The question before the court was whether execution by lethal 
injection constituted “cruel and unusual punishment.” In a 7–2 decision, 

262
Part IV: The Bill of Rights: Specifying Rights through Amendments 
the court ruled that lethal injection — or, to be more precise, execution by 
means of the particular cocktail of lethal drugs administered by injection 
under Kentucky law — is not unconstitutional. Justice Antonin Scalia, in his 
concurring opinion, concluded with this line:
I take no position on the desirability of the death penalty, except to say . . . 
that it is preeminently not a matter to be resolved here. And especially when 
it is explicitly permitted by the Constitution.
Scalia here draws an important logical distinction, which Justices William 
Brennan and Thurgood Marshall in the 1970s failed to make: namely the 
distinction between what the Constitution says and what we would like the 
Constitution to say. Scalia recognizes that there are some strong arguments 
against the death penalty but that it would be wrong of the court even to 
get involved in that debate because that would lead to judges amending the 
Constitution, which is not permitted. The only way that the death penalty 
could be made unconstitutional would be by means of a proper constitutional 
amendment proposed and ratified by the procedure laid down in Article V of 
the Constitution — which I figure ain’t gonna happen any time soon!

The Ninth and Tenth Amendments: 
Leaving Things Up to the 
People and States
In This Chapter
▶ Recognizing the importance of the Ninth and Tenth amendments
▶ Understanding the meaning of “rights retained by the people”
▶ Getting a load of federalism
▶ Understanding how power is shared between the feds, the states, and the people
▶ Using these two amendments as guides to interpreting the Constitution
T
he Ninth and Tenth amendments are both really important parts of 
the Bill of Rights. Unlike the first eight amendments, neither the Ninth 
Amendment nor the Tenth Amendment contains actual concrete rights. Both 
amendments appear vague, which is why so many people have failed to rec-
ognize their importance.
The Ninth Amendment gives guidance on how to interpret the Constitution 
and makes it clear that rights that are not mentioned in the Constitution 
belong to the American people. But Judge Robert Bork has described this 
amendment as “a meaningless inkblot,” and other influential commentators 
have been hardly less flattering.
Thomas Jefferson called the Tenth Amendment “the foundation of the 
Constitution,” but its importance hasn’t always been recognized by the U.S. 
Supreme Court. In 1931, the court commented that this amendment “added 
nothing to the Constitution as originally ratified.” However, in recent years 
the court has started to give the Tenth Amendment the respect that it 
deserves.

264
Part IV: The Bill of Rights: Specifying Rights through Amendments 
Reading the Constitution: 
The Ninth Amendment
The Ninth Amendment is probably the most misunderstood part of the 
Constitution. It’s hard to understand why so many people have made such 
heavy weather of this fairly straightforward single-sentence provision:
The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed 
to deny or disparage others retained by the people.
Let me put this amendment in plain English. It may help if I expand it slightly:
 
✓ The U.S. Constitution confers or guarantees a number of individual rights.
 
✓ But those are not the only rights that individuals possess.
 
✓ The rights that are not mentioned in the Constitution belonged to the 
people before there was a United States of America.
 
✓ And those rights still belong to the people.
 
✓ The fact that the Constitution doesn’t mention those rights doesn’t 
cancel or detract from them.
 
✓ The Constitution must not be construed, or interpreted, in a way that 
deprives the people of those retained rights.
The theoretical underpinnings 
of the Ninth Amendment
In drafting the Ninth Amendment (and also the 
Tenth Amendment), James Madison was draw-
ing on a popular theory of his day: the theory 
of the social contract. This theory says that in 
the beginning there was no government or law. 
Everybody did whatever they liked. As a result, 
there was “a war of every man against every 
man,” and human life was “nasty, brutish, and 
short.” But eventually people got wise to the 
problem. They decided it was better to trade 
some of their freedom for order and peace. So 
they chose a government and entered into a con-
tract with it. The people gave up some rights in 
return for protection from the new government. 
But the people did not give up all their rights, 
only some. The rest they retained.
Although the idea of a social contract is theo-
retical, it actually fits in remarkably well with 
the birth of the United States. The people of 
the 13 colonies threw off the British yoke. The 
people then had total independence. But then 
they got together and chose a government. 
They devised a constitution, under which they 
gave up some of their rights to this new govern-
ment but retained all other rights. Sound famil-
iar? Of course. James Madison was steeped in 
the fashionable theories of his day.

265
 Chapter 19: The Ninth and Tenth Amendments
So, what exactly are these rights “retained by the people”? The word retained 
indicates that the people had these rights before. But when? Clearly, before 
the U.S. Constitution was ratified. In short, these rights derive from English 
common law, going back at least 600 years before the United States came into 
existence.
Is the Ninth Amendment an inkblot?
It’s quite alarming to see how many eminent 
jurists have totally misunderstood the Ninth 
Amendment:
 ✓ Judge Robert Bork describes the amend-
ment as “a meaningless inkblot.” The mean-
ing of the Ninth Amendment, says Bork, is 
as indecipherable as it would have been 
had the text been obscured by an inkblot.
 ✓ In Griswold v. Connecticut, heard by the 
U.S. Supreme Court in 1965, Justice Arthur 
Goldberg opined that the Ninth Amendment 
did not constitute “an independent source of 
rights protected from infringement by either 
the States or the Federal Government.”
 ✓ In Roe v. Wade, decided in 1972, Justice 
William O. Douglas wrote, “The Ninth 
Amendment obviously does not create fed-
erally enforceable rights.”
 ✓ Professor Laurence Tribe wrote that “The 
Ninth Amendment is not a source of rights 
as such; it is simply a rule about how to 
read the Constitution.”
 ✓ In Troxel v. Granville, Justice Antonin 
Scalia wrote in 2000: “The Constitution’s 
refusal to ‘deny or disparage’ other rights is 
far removed from affirming any one of them, 
and even farther removed from authorizing 
judges to identify what they might be, and 
to enforce the judges’ list against laws duly 
enacted by the people.”
Am I right in saying that all these characteriza-
tions of the Ninth Amendment are wrong? Of 
course. Here’s why:
 ✓ The Ninth Amendment is at pains to empha-
size that the pre-Constitution rights that the 
people possessed are still there. So how 
can that mean that the amendment doesn’t 
“affirm” those rights? It can’t.
 ✓ Can retained rights be claimed in a court of 
law? Sure. For example, if you’re charged 
with possession of an illegal drug, you can’t 
be convicted if you show that what looked 
like cocaine was actually a bag of salt. You 
must assert your right to be in possession 
of salt. Is there such a right? Of course. It’s 
one of the innumerable retained rights. How 
do you know you have that right? Because 
there’s no law against being in possession 
of a bag of salt.
 ✓ Does the Ninth Amendment tell us how to 
read the Constitution? Yes, it does. It tells 
us that we must not construe (interpret) the 
Constitution to “deny or disparage” — to 
negate or downplay — the rights retained 
by the people. So, the Ninth Amendment 
tells us how to read the Constitution, but it 
does much more than that. It tells us that 
the rights stated in the Constitution are not 
the only rights enjoyed by the people. There 
are plenty more, and you must not interpret 
the Constitution in a way that interferes 
with those rights.

266
Part IV: The Bill of Rights: Specifying Rights through Amendments 
 
The Constitution confers or guarantees positive rights, but the common law 
works negatively. Under the common law, anything that is not prohibited — 
usually by statute — is allowed.
In drafting the Ninth Amendment, James Madison was anxious to make it 
clear that the fact that the Constitution contained some rights didn’t mean 
that these were the only rights people had. He also wanted to make it quite 
clear that the rights not mentioned in the Constitution didn’t somehow fall to 
the new U.S. government but remained where they had always been — in the 
hands of the people.
There are hundreds, probably thousands, of these rights “retained by the 
people.” Here are just a few examples:
 
✓ The right to pick your nose in public: It’s not a very nice thing to do, 
but as long as there is no law against it, you have the right to do it. In a 
recent poll, the majority of Americans admitted that they did exercise 
this right!
 
✓ The right to kill bugs: Certain religions regard the killing of any living 
thing as a heinous sin, but it’s not a crime under U.S. law — not yet 
anyway!
 
✓ The right to engage in lesbian sex: Unlike male homosexual activity, 
which used to be a criminal offense, sex between women was never 
a crime under U.S. law. Does this mean that you always had a right to 
engage in lesbian sex? Yes, but it was a bit difficult for about half the 
population!
Considering the Tenth Amendment
The Tenth Amendment packs some pretty powerful punches. It tackles these 
topics:
 
✓ Federalism
 
✓ States’ rights
 
✓ People power
The Tenth Amendment also provides guidance on how to read the 
Constitution. This amendment views the Constitution not as the sole source 
of legal power in the nation, but as only one of three sources, the other two 
being the states and the people.

267
 Chapter 19: The Ninth and Tenth Amendments
Analyzing the wording
Here’s what the Tenth Amendment says in its entirety:
The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor 
prohibited by it to the States, are reserved for the States respectively, or to 
the people.
What does this amendment mean? The key word here is “delegated.” To del-
egate a power means to hand it down to somebody else. For example, your 
boss at work may delegate to you the power to purchase stationery.
The Tenth Amendment looks at the political structure of the nation this way:
 
✓ In the beginning, all power belonged to the people.
 
✓ After the Declaration of Independence, the people delegated some of 
their power to the states.
 
✓ When the states ratified the U.S. Constitution, they delegated some of 
their power to the federal government.
 
✓ The federal government doesn’t possess any powers that are not specifi-
cally delegated to it by the Constitution.
 
✓ All powers not delegated to the federal government continue to be 
“reserved” to the states or to the people.
Balancing power between federal 
and state governments
Sharing power between the federal government and the states is what fed-
eralism is all about, and the United States has a federal form of government 
(see Chapter 7).
The Tenth Amendment makes it clear that power originates with the states 
and the people — not with the federal government. In the words of James 
Madison, the author of the Bill of Rights (including the Tenth Amendment):
The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal 
government are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State 
governments are numerous and indefinite. This division of authority was 
adopted by the Framers to ensure protection of our fundamental liberties.

268
Part IV: The Bill of Rights: Specifying Rights through Amendments 
Does this explanation mean that state law is higher than federal law? No. 
That would be too easy. The U.S. Constitution is supreme, but its scope is 
limited. The more complicated reality is this:
 
✓ The U.S. Constitution is the highest law in the nation, and any law that 
conflicts with it is treated as void, or as if it had never existed in the first 
place. (I discuss the legal status of the Constitution in Chapter 3.)
 
✓ The U.S. Constitution delegates certain powers to the federal govern-
ment, including the President and the Congress.
 
✓ The federal government has no right to exercise any powers that are not 
mentioned in the Constitution (known as unenumerated powers).
 
✓ In the interests of the liberty of the people, the constitutional powers of 
the federal government must be strictly interpreted by the courts.
 
✓ All powers other than those delegated by the Constitution to the federal 
government belong to the states or to the people.
This explanation raises further questions. Here are a few:
 
✓ Exactly which powers have been delegated to the federal government?
 
✓ What is meant by “powers prohibited by [the Constitution] to the 
States”?
 
✓ What is the split between the powers that are reserved to the states and 
the powers that are reserved to the people?
I address each of these questions in turn.
Determining the limits of federal power
The Constitution sets out the powers of the federal government, but the pre-
cise nature and scope of these powers are open to interpretation. This fact 
creates a serious problem because neither the courts nor the government 
stick to the same interpretation all the time. Let me illustrate this problem 
with a couple of examples.
The Alien and Sedition Acts
The Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 made the offense of seditious libel a 
federal crime. Seditious libel means writing words intended to subvert the 
government. This legislation attempted to silence critics of the administra-
tion of President John Adams. These laws greatly expanded the power of 
Congress and came close to claiming that Congress had a power to enforce 
the common law — the case law hammered out by the courts over centuries.

269
 Chapter 19: The Ninth and Tenth Amendments
The problem with this view was that the Constitution didn’t give Congress 
any such power. So the Alien and Sedition Acts were clearly in violation of 
the Tenth Amendment, which restricts the power of the federal government 
to powers specifically delegated to it by the Constitution.
Thomas Jefferson beat the incumbent Adams in the 1800 presidential race. 
Jefferson then denounced the Alien and Sedition Acts as unconstitutional and 
void, and he pardoned everyone who had been convicted under them. (The 
Alien and Sedition Acts in their original form contained four laws. None of 
these laws has been tested in the courts, and only one of them — the Alien 
Enemies Act — still survives.)
The Violence Against Women Act
The U.S. Supreme Court under William Rehnquist — who served as Chief 
Justice from 1986 to 2005 — returned to a more traditional, conserva-
tive approach to the Constitution, which some people have named the 
“Federalism Revolution.” (I discuss earlier phases of the Supreme Court in 
Chapter 12.)
The Rehnquist court enforced the Tenth Amendment by taking a narrow view 
of federal power and even striking down parts of some federal laws as uncon-
stitutional because they did not conform to the principles of that amend-
ment. One such law was the Violence Against Women Act of 1994.
A freshman at Virginia Tech, Christy Brzonkala, claimed that she’d been 
raped by two members of the school’s football team. A Virginia grand jury 
was unable to find enough evidence to charge either man with any crime. So 
Brzonkala filed suit in federal court under the Violence Against Women Act 
(VAWA), passed by Congress and signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 
1994. The act allowed women to file a civil suit in federal court for rape and 
sexual harassment.
Brzonkala’s case reached the U.S. Supreme Court in 2000. The court ruled as 
unconstitutional the part of VAWA that allowed women to file suit in federal 
court. Here’s how the Supreme Court reached this conclusion:
 
✓ Civil suits for sexual assault and harassment fall under the jurisdiction 
of the state courts.
 
✓ Federal courts can hear cases only on issues specifically enumerated in 
the Constitution or on issues concerned with interstate commerce. (I 
deal with interstate commerce in Chapter 9.)
 
✓ Sexual assault and harassment are not enumerated in the Constitution 
and have nothing to do with interstate commerce.
 
✓ Therefore, the part of VAWA allowing women to file suit in federal court 
for sexual assaults and harassment is unconstitutional.

270
Part IV: The Bill of Rights: Specifying Rights through Amendments 
President Clinton must have regretted signing VAWA into law, because Paula 
Jones used that very law against him just a year later! Clinton paid Paula 
Jones $850,000 to make her VAWA lawsuit go away.
Hanging together: The origins 
of the Tenth Amendment
The Declaration of Independence of 1776 
rejected British rule over the 13 colonies, which 
became the original 13 states. All 13 states 
signed the Declaration. But each state claimed 
independence for itself. The United States of 
America did not yet exist, and the 13 states did 
not claim to form a single government.
Benjamin Franklin recognized how important 
unity was. “We must all hang together,” he 
said, “or assuredly we shall all hang sepa-
rately.” Franklin knew that, unless the 13 states 
united, the leaders of the American Revolution 
would all likely be executed for treason against 
Great Britain.
The delegates from the 13 states took Franklin’s 
advice. Eight days after the adoption of the 
Declaration of Independence, a constitution for 
the proposed new country was presented to 
the delegates. The constitution was called the 
Articles of Confederation, and the new country 
was named the United States of America.
The 13 states were in a life-and-death struggle 
with the British government. The revolutionar-
ies rose up against Britain because the British 
government denied the colonies autonomy. The 
revolutionaries regarded British rule as a form 
of tyranny, and they were not about to substi-
tute one tyranny for another by imposing a new 
strong central government on themselves.
Thomas Jefferson believed that “The govern-
ment which governs least, governs best.” So 
the Articles of Confederation created a loose 
association of the 13 states known as a con-
federacy. The 13 states retained their individual 
independence, and the central government of 
the confederacy was confined to a Congress 
made up of delegates from all 13 states. George 
Washington thought that this arrangement was 
too decentralized. He described the govern-
ment created by the Articles of Confederation 
as “little more than the shadow without the 
substance.”
Support grew for a stronger federal govern-
ment. This consensus led to the drafting and 
eventual ratification of the U.S. Constitution, 
which created a much more powerful federal 
government under a President as head of state, 
head of the Executive branch, and Commander 
in Chief.
This arrangement satisfied Washington and 
the other Federalists, as they were called, but 
it aroused a lot of hostility among the more 
radical Anti-Federalists. This opposition was 
so strong that there was a serious danger that 
the Constitution might not be ratified by all 13 
states. A Bill of Rights was promised in order to 
ensure ratification.
This is where the Tenth Amendment comes 
in. As part of the Bill of Rights, it explains that, 
although the Constitution is the supreme law of 
the United States of America, the power of the 
federal government created by the Constitution 
is strictly limited.

271
 Chapter 19: The Ninth and Tenth Amendments
Puzzling over “prohibited” powers
The Tenth Amendment is only one sentence long, but one phrase is slightly 
puzzling. Let me quote the amendment again and put the phrase in bold:
The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor 
prohibited by it to the States, are reserved for the States respectively, or 
to the people.
Recognizing states’ limits
The amendment classifies powers like this:
 
✓ Powers delegated by the Constitution to the federal government
 
✓ Powers prohibited by the Constitution to the states
 
✓ Powers reserved to the states
 
✓ Powers reserved to the people
The second category refers to Article I, Section 10 of the Constitution. The 
list of prohibited powers is a long one, including the power
 
✓ To make treaties with foreign powers
 
✓ To coin money
 
✓ To “grant any Title of Nobility”
 
✓ To impose import duties
 
✓ To “engage in War, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger 
as will not admit of delay”
These powers all belong to nations, so it’s easy to see why they are denied to 
individual states. Most of these powers are granted to Congress by Article I, 
Section 8 of the Constitution. (However, the power to grant titles of nobility 
is specifically denied to the federal government by Article I, Section 9. The 
Constitution therefore makes it clear that no U.S. institution, either federal or 
state, has the power to grant titles of nobility. The United States is a republic, 
and any formal gradations in society just don’t belong.)
Probably the most interesting power is the last one I’ve listed: the power 
to engage in war. Do the states really have this power? Article I, Section 10 
of the Constitution essentially says “yes, but only in exceptional circum-
stances.” It’s easy enough to see whether a state has been invaded, but who 
decides whether a state is threatened by “imminent Danger”? Presumably the 
state governor and legislature. But the precise interpretation of this provi-
sion has never been tested in the courts.

272
Part IV: The Bill of Rights: Specifying Rights through Amendments 
Dragging in the Fourteenth Amendment
Does Article I, Section 10 contain the only restrictions on state power in the 
Constitution? No. The Fourteenth Amendment also contains major restric-
tions on the power of the states. When the Tenth Amendment was ratified in 
1791, nobody could have anticipated the Fourteenth Amendment, which was 
a product of the Civil War and became part of the Constitution only in 1868.
But we must read the Tenth Amendment in the light of the Fourteenth 
Amendment, Section 1, which says:
No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or 
immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any 
person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to 
any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.
 
These words come from a completely different world than the one that pro-
duced the Tenth Amendment. The Tenth Amendment is anxious to emphasize 
the limitations on federal power, but the Fourteenth Amendment sharply 
restricts the power of the states. Does the Fourteenth Amendment modify the 
Tenth Amendment? Yes, undoubtedly.
But, if the Tenth Amendment has to be read in the light of the Fourteenth, 
doesn’t that interpretation nullify the whole purpose of the Tenth 
Amendment? The answer to this question depends on how broadly or 
narrowly the Fourteenth Amendment is interpreted. If the Fourteenth 
Amendment is given a broad interpretation, it seriously diminishes the power 
of the states, and that sure knocks a dent in the Tenth Amendment. A narrow 
interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment is more in keeping with the 
spirit of the Tenth Amendment. I deal with the Due Process Clause of the 
Fourteenth Amendment in Chapter 17 and with the rest of that amendment in 
Chapter 21.
Disentangling states’ rights 
from individual rights
The Tenth Amendment says that any powers not delegated to the federal 
government are reserved to the states or to the people. But what happens 
if there is a conflict between the interests of a state and the interests of the 
people? This situation has arisen quite a few times, and the result is not 
always easy to predict. Following are a couple of examples.

273
 Chapter 19: The Ninth and Tenth Amendments
Protecting freedom of contract?
In 1896, New York State passed a law setting a maximum of 60 hours of work 
per week in bakeries. Joseph Lochner owned a bakery in Utica, New York. 
He required his employees to work for more than 60 hours a week. He was 
charged, convicted, and fined for breaking this state law. Lochner unsuccess-
fully appealed his conviction to the highest court in New York State.
He then took his case to the U.S. Supreme Court, which heard it in 1905. 
Lochner’s appeal was based on the Fourteenth Amendment, and I discuss 
this aspect of the case in Chapter 17. But the case is also relevant to an 
understanding of the Tenth Amendment.
Arguing for individual liberty
Four potentially conflicting forces were involved in this case:
 
✓ The federal government — particularly the U.S. Supreme Court
 
✓ New York State
 
✓ Bakery owners
 
✓ Bakery workers
Lochner said that his employees had freely entered into a contractual agree-
ment to work more than 60 hours a week. Lochner’s lawyers argued that the 
New York State law limiting working hours was contrary to freedom of con-
tract and therefore infringed on individual liberty.
New York State claimed that the law about working hours in bakeries was 
necessary to protect the health of bakery employees.
The high court agreed with Lochner and overturned his conviction under the 
New York law. The Supreme Court called the New York law an “unreasonable, 
unnecessary and arbitrary interference with the right and liberty of the indi-
vidual to contract.”
Analyzing the Supreme Court decision
Was the Lochner case really a victory for people power, as the Supreme Court 
claimed? Probably not. Lochner himself wanted his employees to work long 
hours. His employees agreed to do so. But was their agreement truly free? 
(Did they really want to put in as many paid hours of work as possible?) Or 
did they agree to the contract because that was the only way they could keep 
their jobs? It is impossible to tell.

274
Part IV: The Bill of Rights: Specifying Rights through Amendments 
The majority decision in the Lochner case was savaged by Justice Oliver 
Wendell Holmes, Jr., who in his dissent accused the majority of judicial 
activism — making law rather than interpreting it, as they were supposed 
to do. Holmes said that the majority decision was based on “an economic 
theory which a large part of the country does not entertain . . . But a constitu-
tion is not intended to embody a particular economic theory.”
Let’s look at this case from the point of view of the Tenth Amendment. The 
Tenth Amendment says that the federal government — including the U.S. 
Supreme Court — is not entitled to exercise any power that is not delegated 
to it by the Constitution. In my opinion, the Supreme Court had no right to 
overturn the New York law in the first place. By doing so the court over-
stepped its constitutional role.
Next, let me look at the New York law. Did the state have the right under its 
“police powers,” as it claimed, to pass a law limiting working hours in bak-
eries? Note that the term police powers is used here in a very broad sense, 
meaning the power of the state to regulate behavior in the interests of public 
welfare, security, or morality. So the answer must be yes: The state was right 
in claiming that the health of the workers was in danger.
 
Does this conclusion infringe on the rights of the people? No, because free-
dom of contract is fine in general, but it is not a sacred principle. And in the 
Lochner case it is doubtful that the workers did freely agree to the long work-
ing hours that Joseph Lochner required.
In 1937, the Supreme Court rejected the approach that it had taken in 
Lochner, and Lochner is no longer an authority followed by the courts. 
However, Lochner is useful in helping to understand the competing interests 
involved in some legal disputes.
Recognizing gay marriage?
 
In 2004, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts legalized same-sex mar-
riage in that state. This is a very controversial topic and one that can be ana-
lyzed under the Tenth Amendment.
First, some background: In 2001, seven same-sex couples applied unsuccess-
fully for marriage licenses in Massachusetts. The seven couples took the 
matter to court. Chief Justice Margaret Marshall, writing for the majority, 
held that the state constitution “affirms the dignity and equality of all individ-
uals” and that the state had no “constitutionally adequate reason” for refus-
ing to allow same-sex marriages.
Since May 17, 2004, same-sex marriages have been valid in Massachusetts, 
and they have also been allowed in Connecticut since October 10, 2008. 
New Jersey, New Hampshire, and Vermont now also offer same-sex couples 

275
 Chapter 19: The Ninth and Tenth Amendments
the same rights and responsibilities as married couples without using the 
label “marriage” for same-sex unions. Maine, Hawaii, Oregon, Washington 
State, and the District of Columbia give same-sex couples varying rights and 
responsibilities falling short of those of married couples. On the other hand, 
more than 40 states (including some that allow same-sex couples certain 
rights) explicitly restrict the use of the term “marriage” to refer to a union 
between a man and a woman.
Adding the Defense of Marriage Act to the mix
In 1996, Congress had passed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which 
was signed into law by President Clinton. This law says that
 
✓ No state is required to recognize same-sex marriages.
 
✓ In federal law the “word ‘marriage’ means only a legal union between 
one man and one woman as husband and wife.”
Is this law constitutional? It hasn’t been tested in the courts as yet, but it has 
been severely attacked by critics.
Considering the constitutionality of DOMA and gay marriage
The Tenth Amendment provides a simple, logical approach to interpreting 
the Constitution as a whole, starting with the feds, and then moving to the 
states, and finally to the people. Using that approach, here I consider the con-
stitutionality of DOMA and same-sex marriages. Let’s go step by step:
 
✓ Question: What part of the Constitution gave Congress the power 
to pass DOMA? Answer: None. For Congress to dictate to the states 
whether they may or may not recognize a form of marriage is simply 
unconstitutional.
 
 DOMA is also unconstitutional because it is an attempt to stop states 
from obeying Article IV, Section 1 of the Constitution, which says: “Full 
Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records 
and judicial Proceedings of every other state.” If Massachusetts’ legaliza-
tion of same-sex marriage is valid, then all other states must recognize 
a gay marriage performed in Massachusetts, just as a heterosexual mar-
riage contracted in one state is routinely recognized in every other state.
 
✓ That brings us to the Massachusetts ruling in favor of same-sex mar-
riage. Marriage sure is an area under state control. So the Massachusetts 
ruling must be kosher, right? Wrong, for at least two reasons:
 
• The ruling is an example of judicial activism — judges taking the 
law into their own hands and actually making law instead of just 
interpreting it, as they are supposed to do.

276
Part IV: The Bill of Rights: Specifying Rights through Amendments 
 
• The court made a mockery of the English language. Courts are 
supposed to accept the ordinary and usual meaning of words. 
Since time immemorial, the English word marriage has referred 
to the union between a man and a woman. What right does the 
Massachusetts court have to redefine it? None. The court may as 
well have redefined the word horse to include elephants.
 
 Both these reasons make the Massachusetts decision unconstitutional.
 
✓ Last but not least come the people. The Massachusetts court decision 
recognizing same-sex marriages polarized opinion. An amendment to the 
state constitution forbidding same-sex marriage has yet to be put to the 
people of Massachusetts.
 
In my opinion, same-sex marriage in Massachusetts is unconstitutional, and 
the other states therefore don’t have to recognize such unions. I am available 
if anyone wants to take this issue to the U.S. Supreme Court!
The passing in November 2008 of Proposition 8 in California by 52.3 percent 
of the votes cast is indicative of the highly controversial nature of this issue. 
Proposition 8 is intended to add a new section to the state Constitution that 
reads, “Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in 
California.” At the time of this writing, the validity of Proposition 8 is being 
challenged in the California Supreme Court.
Giving the Tenth Amendment its due
The Tenth Amendment was once said by the U.S. Supreme Court to be a mere 
“truism,” just stating the obvious without adding anything new. I don’t agree. 
On the contrary, I think the Tenth Amendment is crucial.
The Tenth Amendment provides a checklist on how to read and interpret the 
Constitution. Here’s how it guides us to determine the constitutionality of a law:
 
✓ For federal laws: What part of the Constitution gives Congress the 
power to pass this law? If there is no such justification, the law is 
unconstitutional.
 
✓ For state laws: Does this law belong to one of the areas prohibited to the 
states by the U.S. Constitution? If it does, it’s unconstitutional. If not, the 
next question is: Have the people delegated to the state — for example, 
by means of the state constitution — the power to make this law? If so, 
the law is okay. If not, the law is void.

Part V: Addressing Liberties and Modifying the Government: More Amendments 
The Eleventh Amendment: Asserting 
State Sovereign Immunity?
The Eleventh Amendment, ratified in 1795, contains only 43 words, but it has 
been interpreted in at least four different ways. Here is what the amendment 
says:
The judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend 
to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the 
United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any 
Foreign State.
Overruling the Supreme Court
The Eleventh Amendment was passed to overturn the Supreme Court ruling 
in the 1793 case of Chisholm v. Georgia. Alexander Chisholm of South Carolina 
filed suit against the State of Georgia for breach of contract, seeking payment 
for goods supplied to Georgia during the War of Independence.
Georgia refused to play ball, saying that Chisholm couldn’t sue a state with-
out its consent because it possessed sovereign immunity from suit. The court 
didn’t like this argument — not surprisingly, because it cut the court’s power. 
The court found in favor of Chisholm and ruled that Article III, Section 2 of 
the Constitution took away the states’ sovereign immunity because in the list 
of cases that could be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court that section included 
“Controversies . . . between a State and Citizens of another State.”
However, such was the outcry against this decision that two days after 
the Supreme Court handed down its decision in Chisholm, a senator put a 
proposal before Congress that was to become the Eleventh Amendment. 
The intention of the amendment was never a secret: It was passed to stop a 
federal lawsuit from being brought against a state without its consent. But is 
that really what the Eleventh Amendment says?
Interpreting the Eleventh Amendment
There are four main interpretations of the Eleventh Amendment:
 
✓ The simplest and most straightforward interpretation of the amendment 
reads it as saying that nobody can sue a state in federal court without 
the consent of the state concerned.

281
 Chapter 20: States’ Rights, Elections, and Slavery
 
✓ The second interpretation reads the amendment as permitting a state to 
be sued by a citizen of another state or of a foreign country, but not by 
a citizen of the state itself. According to this reading, the State of Utah 
can’t be sued in federal court by a resident of Utah itself, but Utah can 
be sued by a resident of Nebraska or by a citizen of Outer Mongolia.
 
✓ The third interpretation is exactly the opposite, excluding only lawsuits 
against a state by a citizen of a different state.
 
✓ The fourth interpretation is broader. It says that in general federal 
courts can’t hear cases against states, but Congress can take away a 
state’s sovereign immunity. If Congress does so, that state is no longer 
protected against suits in federal court.
Cutting across these four different interpretations are four recognized 
exceptions to the ban on lawsuits against states:
 
✓ A lawsuit can always be brought in federal court against a state’s 
subdivisions, such as counties, cities, and municipalities.
 
✓ A state can always consent to a lawsuit being brought against it in federal 
court.
 
✓ Congress can abrogate — or remove — a state’s immunity from suit in 
federal court, provided Congress’s intention to abrogate a state’s immu-
nity is “unmistakably clear.” However, in the 1996 case of Seminole Tribe 
v. Florida, the Supreme Court ruled that the Commerce Clause in Article 
I, Section 8 of the Constitution does not give Congress the power to 
abrogate a state’s immunity from suit in federal court. This ruling calls 
into question the power of federal courts to hear lawsuits against states 
to enforce congressional legislation under the Commerce Clause relating 
to environmental law, bankruptcy, or intellectual property, to name but 
three major areas of commercial law.
 
✓ If a state violates federal law, the state itself can’t be sued in federal 
court — but a federal court can order state officials in their own name 
to comply with federal law. This was decided by the Supreme Court in 
the controversial 1908 case Ex parte Young. This ruling was based on 
the fiction that a state official enforcing an unconstitutional state law is 
a private person — while still remaining a state agent when it comes to 
remedying the unconstitutional law! For example, in the 1993 ruling in 
Martin v. Voinovich, the high court ordered the governor of Ohio to con-
struct housing for handicapped people to comply with the Americans 
with Disabilities Act.

282
Part V: Addressing Liberties and Modifying the Government: More Amendments 
 
The question that lies at the heart of the Eleventh Amendment is whether the 
individual states can still be regarded as possessing sovereignty: complete 
legal independence. This certainly was the position for the first decade of 
independence under the Articles of Confederation. But did this position con-
tinue under the U.S. Constitution, which was ratified in 1788? In short, are, say, 
Maine, Ohio, Kentucky, and Texas as independent of one another and of the 
U.S. federal government as, say, France, India, Brazil, and Australia are of one 
another? Clearly not, but they obviously have a high degree of autonomy nev-
ertheless. If the states were indeed sovereign states in the fullest sense, immu-
nity from suit would follow. Because they don’t have full sovereignty, their 
immunity from suit is also only partial.
Cleaning Up the Framers’ Political Mess: 
The Twelfth Amendment
The mess that the Twelfth Amendment was intended to clean up reflects the 
Framers’ childish innocence in the dirty world of politics.
The Twelfth Amendment introduced the system of presidential elections that 
is still in force today — at least in theory. It was intended as an emergency 
fix for the 1804 presidential election after the two previous elections, held in 
1796 and 1800, had gone badly wrong.
Electing the President: The original rules
The original arrangements for presidential elections are to be found in the 
unamended text of Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution. The arrangements 
were as follows:
 
✓ Each state legislature appointed as many electors for that state as 
there were senators plus representatives from that state combined. 
Let’s take a hypothetical state with 12 representatives in the House of 
Representatives. This state would also have had two senators (because 
every state is entitled to two senators). So, the total number of electors 
for that state would have been 14.
 
✓ The electors of each state met separately.
 
✓ Each elector had two votes without differentiating between President 
and Vice President.
 
✓ The candidate with the most votes (provided they amounted to more 
than 50 percent of the total) became the President, and the runner-up 
became the Vice President.

283
 Chapter 20: States’ Rights, Elections, and Slavery
 
✓ If no candidate obtained more than 50 percent of the votes, the presi-
dential election was thrown into the House of Representatives, and the 
Senate picked the Vice President.
These original rules omitted all mention of political parties. The whole 
arrangement was undemocratic because the Framers didn’t trust the ordi-
nary people to pick the President. Their naïve idea was that the electors 
would choose the best candidate to be the President and the second-best 
candidate to be the Vice President.
Not surprisingly, the whole of this arrangement came unstuck as soon as it 
was put into practice in the first real contested presidential election in 1796.
Understanding politics 1796 style
In the 1796 presidential election, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, the 
two main opposing candidates for President, ended up as President and 
Vice President respectively. It’s just as if Jimmy Carter had become Ronald 
Reagan’s Veep!
John Adams, a Federalist, got 71 electoral votes — more than 50 percent of 
the total — and Thomas Jefferson, a Republican or Democratic-Republican, 
received 68 electoral votes. Although Jefferson and Adams didn’t see eye-
to-eye politically, Jefferson was sworn in as Adams’s Vice President. What a 
mess! But worse was to follow.

The 1800 election was a rematch between Adams and his own Vice President, 
Jefferson. To avoid a repetition of the same problem as in 1796, the political 
parties each nominated two candidates, one intended to run for President 
and the other for Vice President. The Federalist ticket of John Adams and 
Charles Pinckney was confronted by the Democratic-Republican ticket of 
Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr.
Jefferson and Burr won with 73 electoral votes each. It was well understood 
that Jefferson was the party’s presidential candidate and Burr his running 
mate, but the Constitution drew no distinction between candidates for the 
two offices. Each elector just had two equal votes.
Because neither Jefferson nor Burr had a majority, the choice of President 
was left to the House of Representatives. Here the contest was no longer 
between Jefferson and Adams but between Jefferson and his own running 
mate, Aaron Burr!

Part V: Addressing Liberties and Modifying the Government: More Amendments 
After 36 ballots and a lot of horse-trading, Jefferson was elected President 
and Burr Vice President.
This chaotic election made an amendment to the Constitution a pressing 
necessity, and the Twelfth Amendment was duly ratified on June 15, 1804, 
less than five months before that year’s presidential election.
Preventing future chaos
The Twelfth Amendment has stood the test of time, even though it still 
doesn’t mention political parties. It indirectly recognizes the existence of 
parties by providing that electors cast a separate vote for President and Vice 
President.
So, it’s no longer a problem if a party’s vice-presidential candidate gets the 
same number of electoral votes as that party’s candidate for President — 
which indeed is what normally happens.
 
Some people criticize the entire Electoral College system as laid down in the 
Constitution and the Twelfth Amendment, labeling it undemocratic. I discuss 
the Electoral College in depth in Chapter 10 and explain why the Framers 
opted for this method of election instead of relying on the popular vote.
Removing the Blot of Slavery: 
The Thirteenth Amendment
“All men are created equal,” proclaims the Declaration of Independence, 
written by Thomas Jefferson — a lifelong slave owner. How can slavery be 
lawful in a nation based on equality? This conundrum took a civil war to 
sort out.
Although the words slave and slavery don’t appear in the original unamended 
Constitution, slavery was legally established in a number of states, particularly 
in the South. And there are indirect allusions to slavery in the text of 
the Constitution. For example, Article I, Section 9, Clause 1 refers to “the 
Importation of . . . Persons” — clearly a reference to the slave trade. And 
Article I, Section 2 allowed slaves to be counted as three-fifths of free persons 
when calculating state populations for purposes of representation in the 
House of Representatives — an ironic rule, considering that slaves didn’t 
have the right to vote!

 Chapter 20: States’ Rights, Elections, and Slavery
Tracking the debate on slavery
As the United States expanded in the first decades after independence, the 
question of slavery reared its ugly head at every turn. The main question 
was whether slavery was to be allowed in the territories — the large areas 
incorporated into the United States but not yet organized into states. As the 
territories were organized into states, it was crucial to decide whether each 
new state was to be admitted into the Union as a free state or as a slave state. 
These decisions had an important effect on the delicate balance of power 
between the slave states and the free states in Congress, and in particular in 
the Senate. Here are some of the landmarks in this debate:
 
✓ The Missouri Compromise: In 1820, Congress enacted the Missouri 
Compromise, which prohibited slavery in the unorganized territory of 
the Great Plains but permitted it in Missouri and the Arkansas Territory.
 
✓ The Compromise of 1850: The Mexican-American War of 1846–1848 
gave the United States an additional 1.2 million square miles! This huge 
territory was carved into a number of new states. The question, as 
always, was whether these states should be free states or slave states. 
The Compromise of 1850 was made up of five laws passed by Congress 
that balanced the interests of the southern slave states with those of the 
free states of the North. The compromise also introduced the concept of 
“popular sovereignty” into the slavery issue. This doctrine allowed the 
residents of a new state to decide whether slavery was to be permitted 
there or not. The Compromise also introduced a stringent new Fugitive 
Slave Act obliging law-enforcement officers throughout the nation to 
round up all suspected fugitive slaves and return them to people 
claiming to be their owners. By making the free states responsible for 
enforcing slavery, this Act infuriated abolitionists in the North.
 
✓ The Kansas-Nebraska Act: This law, passed by Congress in 1854, effectively 
nullified the Missouri Compromise that had been in place for 34 years. 
The Missouri Compromise prohibited slavery north of latitude 36°30’. But 
the Kansas-Nebraska Act allowed “popular sovereignty” in the Kansas 
Territory and the Nebraska Territory, both of which were north of that 
line. The act provoked bitter conflict in the two territories — and in the 
nation as a whole.
 
✓ Dred Scott v. Sandford: Dred Scott was a slave whose master was an 
army doctor who kept moving around, taking Scott with him. Scott was 
born into slavery in Virginia, a slave state, but lived for a time in Illinois, 
a free state, and also in the Wisconsin Territory, where slavery was also 
prohibited. Dred Scott claimed that his residence in a free state and a 
free territory had emancipated him from slavery.

286
Part V: Addressing Liberties and Modifying the Government: More Amendments 
 
 The U.S. Supreme Court roundly rejected this argument in 1857. Chief 
Justice Roger Taney, writing for the majority, ruled that the Fifth 
Amendment prohibited the federal government from depriving anybody 
of property — including slaves — “without due process of law.” The 
Missouri Compromise of 1820, he held, was therefore unconstitutional. 
In Taney’s words, “An act of Congress which deprives a citizen of the 
United States of his liberty or property merely because he came himself 
or brought his property into a particular Territory of the United States, 
and who had committed no offence against the laws, could hardly be 
dignified with the name of due process of law.” On this basis, the court 
decided by 6 votes to 2 that Dred Scott was still a slave and, moreover, 
that no African American, whether slave or free, could ever become a 
U.S. citizen.
 
 By denying the power of Congress to prohibit slavery in the territories, 
the Supreme Court incensed antislavery opinion throughout the nation. 
The widening rift between the free North and the slave-owning South led 
to increasing talk in the South about secession from the Union.
For the election of 1860, the recently formed Republican Party adopted 
a platform that opposed the spread of slavery to the territories but did 
not propose to abolish slavery in those states where it already existed. 
The Republican presidential candidate, Abraham Lincoln, was a moderate 
Republican. Lincoln regarded slavery as immoral, but he accepted that it was 
recognized by the Constitution.
Sliding into secession
The 1860 election revealed just how divided the nation was. Lincoln won 
handily in the North, while incumbent Vice President John C. Breckinridge 
swept the South. Lincoln’s name didn’t even appear on the ballot in nine 
southern states. Lincoln won less than 40 percent of the popular vote 
nationwide, but this translated into just under 60 percent of the electoral 
votes, which put him into the White House.
Although Lincoln was not an abolitionist, the South assumed that he was, 
and he refused to promise not to abolish slavery altogether. Seven southern 
states seceded from the Union even before Lincoln was inaugurated on 
March 4, 1861.
In a last-ditch attempt to placate the South and bring the seceding states 
back into the Union, lame-duck President James Buchanan asked Congress to 
propose an “explanatory amendment” to the Constitution based on the Dred 
Scott decision of the Supreme Court.

287
 Chapter 20: States’ Rights, Elections, and Slavery
A special committee of the House of Representatives under Thomas Corwin 
of Ohio, a Republican, quickly produced a draft. On March 2, 1861 — with 
just two days of Buchanan’s presidency left — Congress passed the proposed 
amendment with the requisite two-thirds majority in both houses. President 
Buchanan signed it enthusiastically, although the President’s approval is not 
needed for amendments.
Considering the Corwin amendment
The Corwin amendment, as it’s usually called, reads as follows:
No amendment shall be made to the Constitution which will authorize or 
give to Congress the power to abolish or interfere, within any state, with 
the domestic institutions thereof, including that of persons held to labor or 
service by the laws of said state.
Despite the absence of the word slave or slavery, there was no mistaking the 
meaning of this proposed amendment. It clearly guaranteed the preservation 
of slavery in all already-existing slave states without, however, dealing with 
the vexed question of slavery in the territories or new states.
It’s significant that this proposed amendment was able to command such 
widespread support in Congress at a time when many southern members 
had withdrawn. This means that an amendment guaranteeing the permanent 
existence of slavery in the established slave states had substantial support 
among the politicians representing the free states of the North.
Amazingly, two days later, on March 4, 1861, the newly elected President 
Lincoln also gave the proposed amendment his grudging blessing in his first 
inaugural address.
The proposed amendment was then sent on its way to obtain the ratification 
of the states. It was validly ratified by Ohio and Maryland and invalidly by 
Illinois (by a constitutional convention that just happened to be in session 
at the time). But Buchanan’s and Corwin’s frantic efforts to avert a civil war 
came too late. By the time the proposed amendment passed Congress, not 
only had seven states seceded; they had already established a breakaway 
government under the title of the Confederate States of America, or the 
Confederacy, as it’s commonly known.
Jefferson Davis, who became the President of the Confederacy, was a U.S. 
senator from Mississippi from 1857 to 1861. After Mississippi seceded in 
January 1861 — against Davis’s advice — he withdrew from the Senate. In 
his farewell address, he identified the reason for the secession of the South 
as the Republican Party’s failure “to recognize our domestic institutions 
[slavery] which preexisted the formation of the Union — our property, which 
was guarded by the Constitution.”

288
Part V: Addressing Liberties and Modifying the Government: More Amendments 
 
Recognition of slavery where it was already legally established was precisely 
what the Corwin amendment sought to achieve. The Buchanan-Corwin initiative 
was not the first time that such a solution had been proposed. But it was the 
first time that it had reached the stage of being adopted by Congress for 
ratification as a constitutional amendment.
President Buchanan deplored the secession, saying, “The South has no right 
to secede, but I have no power to prevent them.” Prevention is better than 
cure, but a cure was at hand — military action. Buchanan regarded that cure 
as worse than the disease, but it was eagerly embraced by his successor, 
Lincoln, who was determined to bring the seceding states to heel. With a 
full-scale civil war raging as of April 1861, the Corwin amendment was quickly 
forgotten.
Could the ratification of the Corwin amendment have prevented the bloody 
carnage that followed Lincoln’s inauguration? Or was Lincoln’s famous earlier 
remark more accurate? — that “A house divided against itself cannot stand. I 
believe this government cannot endure, permanently half slave and half free.”
Graduating from emancipation to abolition
The Civil War raged from 1861 to 1865. In the early stages, Lincoln didn’t 
allow his generals to free slaves in captured territories, and he even reversed 
their emancipation proclamations. For example, when General John Frémont 
freed all slaves in Missouri, Lincoln canceled the general’s proclamation and 
relieved him of his command.
In 1862, in response to a call by a newspaper editor for the total abolition of 
slavery, Lincoln wrote, “My paramount object in this struggle is to save the 
Union, and is not either to save or destroy slavery. If I could save the Union 
without saving any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the 
slaves I would do it.”
Lincoln had long been an advocate of sending freed slaves to colonize 
Liberia, in West Africa. As President he also championed a succession of 
schemes of black colonization in Panama and off the coast of Haiti.
Lincoln took the view that the Constitution didn’t give a peacetime President 
the power to abolish slavery. However, a mass rally of abolitionists in 
Chicago held in September 1862 calling for an immediate end to slavery 
placed the President under pressure.
Later the same month, Lincoln issued his Emancipation Proclamation as a 
wartime measure. It freed the slaves living in those states of the Confederacy 
that had not returned to Union control by January 1, 1863. However, it did 
not have any effect on the slaves in border states that had remained loyal to 

289
 Chapter 20: States’ Rights, Elections, and Slavery
the Union. Remarkably, the Proclamation also favored the idea of encouraging 
African Americans to leave the country and establish settlements elsewhere 
in the Americas or in Africa.
The radical Republicans, hard-line abolitionists, pressed for the immediate and 
complete abolition of slavery throughout the nation. They thought Lincoln 
was pussyfooting around the issue of slavery. So in May 1864 they nominated 
General John Frémont — the radical abolitionist who had had a run-in with 
Lincoln earlier in the war — to run against Lincoln for President.
Introducing an entirely different 
thirteenth amendment
In the meantime, the strongly Republican Senate spearheaded the introduction 
of a very different thirteenth amendment — one abolishing slavery altogether. 
This was to become the actual Thirteenth Amendment and is still part of the 
Constitution today. Section 1 reads as follows:
Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime 
whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the 
United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.
This amendment was proposed in 1864 while the Civil War was still raging 
and the slave-owning states of the South still formed part of the breakaway 
Confederacy. So, an amendment abolishing slavery might have been expected 
to enjoy widespread support in Congress, from which the Confederate states 
were excluded.
But in fact abolition was by no means universally popular in the North. For 
example, Francis Hughes, an influential Pennsylvania Democrat, warned that 
abolition would flood the state with freed slaves. In the 1862 midterm elections 
to the House of Representatives, the Republican Party had lost 22 seats, 
leaving them with only 86 seats out of a total of 185, or just over 46 percent of 
the seats.
So, although the proposed amendment easily passed the Senate — whose 
members in those days were not directly elected but appointed by their state 
legislatures — it was initially rejected by the House of Representatives, which 
it passed only nine months later, on January 31, 1865.
By this time Lincoln felt much more secure after comfortably winning a second 
term as President. Congress had taken the initiative over abolition, so 
Lincoln — always a cautious politician — could now safely come out in its 
favor. He followed President Buchanan’s example (in regard to the Corwin 
amendment) by writing by hand on the Joint Resolution of Congress passing the 
proposed new amendment, “Approved February 1, 1865 — Abraham Lincoln.”

290
Part V: Addressing Liberties and Modifying the Government: More Amendments 
The proposal was quickly ratified by the free states in the North but was 
rejected by slave states that had remained loyal to the Union, including 
New Jersey (which had only a handful of slaves), Delaware, and Kentucky. 
Nevertheless, by the time the Civil War ended in April, 1865, no fewer than 
20 states had ratified the proposed amendment — out of a requisite 27, 
three-fourths of the 36 states then in existence.
The last seven states to complete the ratification process included some 
southern states under Union occupation. Ratification was completed with 
the ratification by the occupied state of Georgia on December 6, 1865. By 
contrast, Mississippi, another Confederate state, which still had its own 
elected (Democratic Party) governor at the same time, rejected the 
amendment on December 5, 1865 — and ratified it only on March 16, 1995!
 
The importance of the slavery issue in the history of the United States cannot 
be exaggerated. It has generated — and still generates — strong emotions. 
To put the whole subject in perspective it may be helpful to read two very 
different accounts of what slavery was like. First, there is Kenneth M. Stampp’s 
classic negative portrayal of slavery in a 1956 book titled The Peculiar 
Institution: Slavery in the Ante-Bellum South. A very different view of slavery 
emerges from a 1974 two-volume blockbuster by the Nobel laureate Robert W. 
Fogel together with Stanley L. Engerman called Time on the Cross: The 
Economics of American Negro Slavery. This radical revisionist work, based on 
detailed economic data, concluded that the material conditions of slaves 
compared favorably with those of free industrial workers in the North.
Justifying the draft?
Is conscription, Selective Service, or the draft 
prohibited by the Thirteenth Amendment as a 
form of “involuntary servitude”? The Supreme 
Court in Arver v. United States, heard in 1918 
during World War I, ruled that performance 
of a citizen’s “supreme and noble duty of 
contributing to the defense of the rights and 
honor of the nation, as the result of a war declared 
by the great representative body of the people” 
couldn’t possibly “be said to be the imposition 
of involuntary servitude in violation of the 
prohibitions of the Thirteenth Amendment.”
That decision specifically refers to wars 
declared by Congress. But what about wars 
not officially declared by Congress? After all, 
the United States has not issued any formal 
declaration of war since World War II. Does the 
1918 ruling mean that the draft is legal only for 
wars formally declared by Congress? Probably 
not, but this question remains open. For more on 
the President’s war powers, see Chapter 10.

Chapter 21
The Fourteenth Amendment: 
Ensuring Equal Protection
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding citizenship
▶ Laying some heavy burdens on the states
▶ Achieving the equal protection of the laws
▶ Calculating proportional representation
▶ Addressing the heritage of the Civil War
T
he Fourteenth Amendment, ratified in 1868, is one of the most 
important — and one of the most controversial — parts of the 
Constitution. It’s a meaty amendment, dealing with some pretty weighty 
topics. These include:
 
✓ The definition of citizenship
 
✓ The obligation of the states to uphold the privileges and immunities of 
United States citizens
 
✓ Due process
 
✓ The obligation of the states not to deny “the equal protection of the laws”
 
✓ How representation in Congress is calculated
 
✓ Disqualification from holding office
 
✓ Denial of any obligation to compensate former slave owners for the 
emancipation of their slaves
With the exception of due process, which I discuss in Chapter 17, you can 
sink your teeth into all these topics in this chapter. I hope you’re hungry!

292
Part V: Addressing Liberties and Modifying the Government: More Amendments 
Defining Citizenship
The first clause of Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment defines citizenship:
All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the 
jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein 
they reside.
This definition looks pretty straightforward, but it isn’t. Here’s why:
 
✓ United States citizenship is based on birthright rather than on the “right 
of blood.” Birthright citizenship means that citizenship depends on 
where a person is born rather than who his or her parents are. The 
birthright basis of U.S. citizenship was confirmed by the U.S. Supreme 
Court in 1898. This ruling was made in the case of Wong Kim Ark, who 
was born in the United States to Chinese noncitizen parents. The court 
decided that he was a U.S. citizen even though his parents were not.
 
 Chief Justice Melville Fuller in his dissenting opinion in Wong’s case put 
his finger on a problem with the birthright rule: “It is unreasonable to 
conclude that ‘naturalborn citizen’ applied to everybody born within 
the geographical tract known as the United States, irrespective of 
circumstances; and that the children of foreigners, happening to be 
born to them while passing through the country . . . were eligible to the 
presidency, while children of our citizens, born abroad, were not.”
 
✓ The definition of citizenship in the Fourteenth Amendment is very 
different from what it would have been at the time when the Bill of 
Rights was ratified in 1791. Back then, not everybody who was born in 
the United States “and subject to the jurisdiction thereof” was a citizen, 
because slaves were not recognized as citizens even though most of 
them had been born in the United States.
 
✓ This definition of citizenship contains a twofold test. To be a citizen you 
have to be “born or naturalized in the United States” and “subject to the 
jurisdiction thereof.” Let’s see how that pans out in practice:
 
• The children of U.S. citizens are automatically citizens if they are 
born in the United States.
 
• Laws passed by Congress have also given automatic U.S. citizenship 
to children born outside the United States, provided at least one 
of their parents is a U.S. citizen — even if they are born out of 
wedlock. (Precise conditions vary according to the dates of birth 
of the children concerned.)
 
• Any child under 18 who has been adopted by a U.S. citizen gets 
citizenship immediately on arrival in the United States under the 
Child Citizenship Act of 2000.

293
 Chapter 21: The Fourteenth Amendment: Ensuring Equal Protection
 
• The children of aliens who are lawfully in the United States are 
automatically U.S. citizens — provided the children are born in the 
United States.
 
• What about the children of illegal aliens? The law is clear on this 
point. All children born in the United States are U.S. citizens, 
regardless of their parents’ legal status. But this law is not 
universally popular among Americans.
 
• Where does “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” come in? This 
provision excludes the children of foreign diplomats from becoming 
U.S. citizens, even if they are born in the United States. Don’t 
foreign diplomats and their kids have to obey U.S. law while they’re 
in the United States? No. The best evidence of their privileged 
position is the mountain of parking and speeding tickets that 
diplomats and their families are allowed to ignore every year.
What about disloyal citizens? Can they be stripped of their citizenship on 
the ground that they have rejected the jurisdiction of the United States? No. 
In 2004, the U.S. Supreme Court heard a case involving Yaser Hamdi. Hamdi 
was allegedly fighting on the side of the Taliban when he was captured in 
Afghanistan in 2001. Could the U.S. government hold him in Guantanamo 
Bay and deny him due process as an “illegal enemy combatant”? No, said 
the Supreme Court, because he was a U.S. citizen. He was born in the United 
States and raised in Saudi Arabia, of which he was also a citizen. Faced with a 
judicial brick wall, the U.S. government made a deal with Hamdi. In return for 
his release, Hamdi gave up his U.S. citizenship and promised to live permanently 
in Saudi Arabia.
Understanding States’ Obligations
The Bill of Rights contains a lot of rights enjoyed by the people against the 
government. But which government is that: the federal government, state 
governments, or both? This important question is not directly answered in 
the Bill of Rights. The U.S. Supreme Court confronted it only in 1833, in the 
case of Barron v. Baltimore.
The court’s answer was clear: The Bill of Rights binds only the federal govern-
ment, not the states. In the words of Chief Justice John Marshall, “The question 
thus presented is, we think, of great importance, but not of much difficulty.” He 
explained that the U.S. Constitution is concerned only with the federal govern-
ment and not with the individual states, each of which has its own constitution.
This restrictive reading of the Constitution prevailed right up until the 
ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868. The wording of the 
Fourteenth Amendment makes it quite clear that it applies just as much to 
the states as to the federal government. Allow me to underline references to 
the states to demonstrate:

294
Part V: Addressing Liberties and Modifying the Government: More Amendments 
All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the 
jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein 
they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the 
privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State 
deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; 
nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.
Let’s look more closely at the obligations of states contained in this section.
Disentangling state citizenship
All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the 
jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein 
they reside.
Okay, so all U.S. citizens are also citizens “of the State wherein they reside.” 
Generations ago, that may have seemed simple enough, but these days, few 
people live their entire lives in the states in which they’re born. If you are 
born in Arizona, go to college in Indiana, and then move to Hawaii, of which 
state are you a citizen? All of them, at different times. You can get a driver’s 
license in whichever state you move to, vote in that state’s elections, and 
enjoy all the rights of state citizenship as if you were born and raised there.
Analyzing “privileges or immunities”
Look again at the opening of the second clause of Section 1 of the Fourteenth 
Amendment:
No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or 
immunities of citizens of the United States . . .
What exactly does it mean?
 
✓ To abridge means to shorten, restrict, limit, or reduce.
 
✓ A privilege is a right that is enjoyed only by some people. The privileges 
referred to in the Fourteenth Amendment are specifically the privileges 
enjoyed only by U.S. citizens.
 
✓ Immunities are really the flip side of privileges. Privileges are positive, 
immunities negative. Nowadays, the word immunity is most often used in 
reference to disease. But in the Constitution, immunity means a special 
negative right enjoyed by U.S. citizens, such as the right not to be 
deported to a foreign country.
 
✓ The first shall means “must” and the second one “will.”

295
 Chapter 21: The Fourteenth Amendment: Ensuring Equal Protection
Let me rewrite the whole clause in modern English. Here goes:
No state is allowed to make or enforce any law that reduces the special 
positive and negative rights of citizens of the United States.
But what exactly are these special positive and negative rights?
Dredging the past for “privileges or immunities”
The answer to this question lies in the history of the phrase “privileges 
or immunities.” The “privileges or immunities” clause of the Fourteenth 
Amendment clearly echoes the first clause of Section 2 of Article IV of the 
Constitution, which reads:
The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities 
of Citizens in the several States.
This wording in turn can be traced back hundreds of years to the English 
common law.
The phrase crystallized in a wonderful judgment given in 1823 by George 
Washington’s nephew, Justice Bushrod Washington, in Corfield v. Coryell. 
Congress cited this decision when it adopted the “privileges or immunities” 
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Justice Washington stressed that the phrase “Privileges and Immunities” in 
Article IV of the Constitution does not refer to all the privileges and immuni-
ties enjoyed by citizens, but only to “those privileges and immunities which 
are, in their nature, fundamental.” If this is the meaning of “Privileges and 
Immunities” in Article IV, it must also be the meaning of the phrase in the 
Fourteenth Amendment, which intentionally echoes it. (The only reason for 
the switch from “and” to “or” is that the phrase in Article IV is positive, and 
the phrase in the Fourteenth Amendment is negative. Check it out.)
Listening to George Washington’s favorite nephew
Here are some of the privileges and immunities that Bushrod Washington 
identified:
 
✓ “Protection by the government”
 
✓ The enjoyment of life, liberty, and property
 
✓ “The right of a citizen of one state to pass through, or to reside in any 
other state”
 
✓ The right “to claim the benefit of the writ of habeas corpus”
 
✓ The right “to institute and maintain actions of any kind in the courts of 
the state”
 
✓ The right “to take, hold and dispose of property, either real or personal”
 
✓ The right to vote

296
Part V: Addressing Liberties and Modifying the Government: More Amendments 
Slaughtering the “privileges or immunities” clause
As Justice Clarence Thomas put it in 1999, the 
U.S. Supreme Court “all but read the Privileges 
or Immunities Clause out of the Constitution in 
the Slaughter-House Cases” in 1873.
The State of Louisiana passed a law that 
allowed the city of New Orleans to set up a 
corporation to centralize all slaughterhouse 
operations. This law threatened the livelihood 
of a number of independent butchers. The 
butchers’ lawyer figured that the law was 
unconstitutional because it infringed on the 
right enjoyed by the butchers “to sustain 
their lives through labor.” The U.S. Supreme 
Court disagreed with this broad reading of the 
“privileges or immunities” clause in the recently 
ratified Fourteenth Amendment. The majority of 
justices held that the clause was concerned 
only with the rights of “national citizenship” 
and not state citizenship — and the right to 
work for a living was not a privilege attached 
to national citizenship. So the butchers lost the 
case, and the state law to which they objected 
was upheld by the court.
The U.S. Supreme Court has considered 
the “privileges or immunities” clause of the 
Fourteenth Amendment on surprisingly few 
occasions since 1873.
The most recent Supreme Court case on this 
clause was Saenz v. Roe, decided in 1999. 
The key fact in this case was the higher level 
of welfare payments available in California by 
comparison with most other states. In 1992, 
California passed a law to discourage people 
from moving there in order to get the more 
generous welfare payments. The law said that 
for their first 12 months’ residence in California, 
welfare recipients would get only the amount to 
which they were entitled in the state from which 
they had moved. In 1996, a federal statute was 
passed that allowed states to operate the sort 
of system that California had introduced.
The Supreme Court ruled that the California 
law infringed on the welfare recipients’ “right 
to travel” and settle in any state they liked. The 
court also struck down the federal law because 
“Congress may not authorize the States to 
violate the Fourteenth Amendment.”
The “right to travel” certainly is among the 
“Privileges and Immunities” identified by 
Justice Bushrod Washington. But does that 
right include the right to pick up higher welfare 
checks from day one? Unlikely. We can’t ask 
Bushrod, because, unfortunately, he isn’t in the 
phonebook.
Writing for the majority in Saenz v. Roe, Justice 
John Paul Stevens opined: “The States do 
not have any right to select their citizens.” 
This is undeniable but irrelevant to the case. 
California never denied any citizen the right to 
live in that state. All it did was try to discourage 
welfare-shoppers from picking California 
because they regarded it quite literally as the 
Golden State.
Achieving “Equal Justice 
Under Law” — Or Not
Equality is one of the big principles of the American Revolution, but more in 
theory than in practice. The Declaration of Independence proclaims “all men 
are created equal,” but Thomas Jefferson, who drafted the Declaration, was a 
slave owner.

 Chapter 21: The Fourteenth Amendment: Ensuring Equal Protection
You may have seen the words “Equal Justice Under Law” emblazoned above 
the entrance to the U.S. Supreme Court building. (Surprisingly enough, this 
slogan was coined not by any Supreme Court justice, but by the architects of 
the building!) The concept encapsulated in this memorable phrase is a close 
cousin to the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment:
nor [shall any State] deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal 
protection of the laws.
As is so often the case, this clause raises more questions than it answers. In 
the following sections, I address some of the topics that are — or could be, if 
challenged in court — affected by the Equal Protection Clause.
Age discrimination
A 1984 federal law called the National Minimum Drinking Age Act indicates 
that federal revenue will be withheld from states that allow people under the 
age of 21 to buy alcohol. Even so, each state technically still has the right to 
decide the legal drinking age within its borders. Most states set that age at 
21 (although some states sidestep the issue somewhat by forbidding the 
purchase — but not the consumption — of alcohol by people under age 21).
You can vote when you turn 18, so why do you have to wait another three 
years before you can drink? Is it in accordance with “equal protection of the 
laws” to allow 21-year-olds to drink but not 18-year-olds? No, but most people 
would probably regard this kind of discrimination as justified.
South Dakota, which allowed 19-year-olds to buy beer containing up to 3.2 
percent alcohol, challenged the 1984 federal law in the U.S. Supreme Court. 
The challenge was based not on the Fourteenth Amendment but on the 
Twenty-First Amendment, which gives the states control over liquor (see 
Chapter 22). South Dakota’s challenge failed, and the 1984 federal law was 
upheld. Would a challenge based on the Fourteenth Amendment have been 
more likely to succeed? Probably not, mainly because of the problem of 
drunk driving among young drivers.
Capital punishment
What about executing juveniles or the mentally retarded? Is it right to treat 
them the same as everybody else? Is that the type of “equal protection” the 
Fourteenth Amendment refers to?
The U.S. Supreme Court has come out against the execution of anyone who 
fits in either of these categories. In the case of Roper v. Simmons, which was 
heard in 2005, the court ruled that a 17-year-old murderer could not be 
executed, even though

✓ He broke into his victim’s house, tied her hands, and blindfolded her.
 
✓ He then drove her to a state park and threw her off a railroad bridge 
while she was still alive, all for the theft of six dollars!
 
✓ He had planned his actions carefully.
 
✓ He videotaped a reenactment of events afterward.
 
✓ He boasted about his actions.
 
✓ He confessed to the killing.
 
Did this killer deserve to be spared the death penalty just because he was a 
few months shy of his eighteenth birthday? The Missouri jury that sentenced 
him to death sure didn’t think so. This is a case where most people might 
agree that equal justice was called for. However, the case was not fought on 
that basis at all, but simply under the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition of 
“cruel and unusual punishments,” which I discuss in Chapter 18.
Racial segregation
In the well-known case of Plessy v. Ferguson, decided in 1896, the U.S. Supreme 
Court ruled in favor of a Louisiana law requiring racial segregation on the rail-
road. The court held that this law did not violate the Equal Protection Clause 
of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Equal Protection Clause, said the court, 
was concerned with equality in civil rights, not in social arrangements. The 
Louisiana law, it held, satisfied the test of reasonableness and was based on 
“the established usages, customs and traditions of the people.”
However, in 1954, in Brown v. Board of Education, the U.S. Supreme Court 
signaled a fundamental change of mind. The court, speaking through Chief 
Justice Earl Warren, proclaimed that
in the field of public education the doctrine of ‘separate but equal’ has no 
place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal. Therefore, we 
hold that the plaintiffs and others similarly situated . . . are, by reason of 
the segregation complained of, deprived of the equal protection of the laws 
guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.
I discuss this important case in Chapter 23.
School busing
Does the ban on segregation entitle the courts to enforce mixed schools? 
In 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court ordered the integration of all 105 schools 
in Charlotte-Mecklenburg, North Carolina, by busing students to different 
schools. The intention was to achieve the same whites-to-blacks ratio in 

299
 Chapter 21: The Fourteenth Amendment: Ensuring Equal Protection
the schools as in the population of the area as a whole. The Supreme Court 
based its unanimous decision specifically on the Equal Protection Clause of 
the Fourteenth Amendment.
But this important decision backfired. The Supreme Court believed that 
forced integration would lead to greater equality in the education offered 
to members of different ethnic groups — and to an improvement in the 
educational levels attained by minority students. Yet a 1992 Harvard 
University study found that black and Hispanic students lacked “even 
modest overall improvement” as a result of busing.
Here are some other bad effects of busing:
 
✓ Some students were spending as much as three hours a day on the bus! 
As a result, less time was available for sports and other extracurricular 
activities.
 
✓ Busing sometimes transported kids to dangerous neighborhoods.
 
✓ Kids were often bused from integrated schools to less integrated 
schools.
 
✓ “White flight” to the suburbs occurred at least partly in response to 
forced integration. Another response to busing was for white parents to 
send their children to private or parochial schools.
 
✓ The result was that inner city public schools became largely made up of 
minorities — exactly the opposite of the intention behind busing. Today, 
Boston public schools are 85 percent African American and Hispanic, 
even though Boston’s black and Hispanic populations together represent 
less than 40 percent of the city’s total population. Similar examples 
abound. Private schools sprang up in Pasadena, California — 63 at the 
last count — where white kids now make up only 16 percent of the 
public school population.
Since 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court has gradually pulled away from the 
extreme interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause that led to forced 
busing. In Milliken v. Bradley, heard in 1974, the Supreme Court banned 
forced busing across district lines unless a number of school districts had 
engaged in deliberate segregation. In Board of Education of Oklahoma City v. 
Dowell, decided in 1991, the Supreme Court recognized that the existence 
of single-race schools did not necessarily amount to a violation of the Equal 
Protection Clause.
In two cases decided together in 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court finally almost 
reversed its harmful 1971 interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause. The 
Supreme Court now rejects the use of race in assigning students to schools. 
This turns the 1971 interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause on its head. 
In the words of Chief Justice John Roberts, “The way to stop discrimination on 
the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race” — an important 
recognition that discrimination in favor of minorities is racial discrimination 

300
Part V: Addressing Liberties and Modifying the Government: More Amendments 
nevertheless. See Chapter 23, where I discuss these two landmark cases — 
Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1 and 
Meredith v. Jefferson County Board of Education.
Affirmative action
A related topic is whether affirmative action is supported by the Equal 
Protection Clause. In Grutter v. Bollinger, heard in 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court 
upheld the affirmative action admissions policy operated by the University of 
Michigan Law School. Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, writing for the majority, 
held that there was “a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits 
that flow from a diverse student body.” Justice Clarence Thomas, in a strongly 
worded dissent, labeled the law school’s admissions policy as racial discrimina-
tion and “a practice that can only weaken the principle of equality embodied in 
the Declaration of Independence and the Equal Protection Clause.”
The two 2007 decisions mentioned in the previous section are also relevant 
here — and point to the final emergence of a color-blind Constitution.
The courts’ standard of scrutiny
What standard of scrutiny should the courts 
apply in lawsuits brought under the Equal 
Protection Clause? The U.S. Supreme Court has 
identified three levels of scrutiny:
 ✓ Strict scrutiny, applicable to cases 
involving race, religion, voting rights, and 
other rights regarded as fundamental. 
The test here is that a challenged law or 
decision is unconstitutional unless it is 
“narrowly tailored” to serve a “compelling 
government interest.”
 ✓ Heightened or intermediate scrutiny, 
applicable to cases involving sex or gender. 
The test here is that a challenged law must 
be “substantially related” to an “important 
government interest.” The U.S. Supreme 
Court first applied this standard in 1976 in the 
case of Craig v. Boren. This case mounted a 
challenge of an Oklahoma law that permitted 
the sale of low-alcohol beer to females over 
the age of 18 but to males only over the age 
of 21. The Supreme Court held that the 
Oklahoma law didn’t pass the requisite test, 
contravened the Equal Protection Clause, 
and was therefore unconstitutional.
 ✓ Rational basis scrutiny, applicable to all 
other cases. The test here is that a chal-
lenged law must be “reasonably related” 
to a “legitimate government interest.” 
The court applied this level of scrutiny 
to a proposed amendment to the Constitution 
of Colorado. The proposed amendment 
banned the passing of any state law 
that accorded homosexuals or bisexuals 
“minority status, quota preferences, 
protected status or a claim of discrimina-
tion.” The case in question was Romer v. 
Evans, decided in 1996. The U.S. Supreme 
Court ruled that the proposed amendment 
was unconstitutional. The majority on the 
court claimed not to be applying strict scrutiny 
or even heightened scrutiny, on the ground 
that the proposed amendment did not even 
come up to the much lower standard of being 

301
 Chapter 21: The Fourteenth Amendment: Ensuring Equal Protection
Gerrymandering
Gerrymandering refers to redrawing the boundaries of a voting district to 
favor one political party. The word is the dubious legacy of Massachusetts 
Governor Elbridge Gerry, whose 1812 redistricting map showed an elongated 
voting district that resembled a salamander. Gerry plus salamander produced 
the new word gerrymander.
Obviously, gerrymandering has been practiced for a long time, but is it legal, 
or does it violate the Equal Protection Clause?
In 2006, the League of United Latin American Citizens challenged the recent 
redistricting of Texas on the ground that it diluted the Latino vote and amounted 
to an unconstitutional gerrymander, contrary to the Equal Protection Clause. 
The U.S. Supreme Court rejected this argument, but the debate is sure to continue.
Apportioning Representatives
Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment reads rather strangely to modern 
eyes. It’s a long passage, so I won’t quote it here. Take a look at the Appendix 
to see what I mean, and then allow me to explain.
Recognizing proportionality 
80 years too late?
Section 2 says that representatives
shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective 
numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State.
“reasonably related” to “a legitimate govern-
ment interest.”
The outcome of a case can easily depend on the 
level of scrutiny that the court decides to apply to 
it. The stricter the scrutiny, the harder it is for the 
law or decision under review to pass muster.
A 1996 case involving the Virginia Military 
Institute (VMI) provides a good illustration 
of this important point. VMI, a state military 
college, had an all-male admissions policy. This 
policy was challenged in the U.S. Supreme Court 
under the Equal Protection Clause. The majority 
on the court held that the school’s admissions 
policy violated the Equal Protection Clause 
because the school failed to show “exceedingly 
persuasive justification” for that policy. Justice 
Antonin Scalia pointed out in his dissent that 
this test was essentially one of strict scrutiny, 
which was far too high. The appropriate 
standard was that of intermediate scrutiny or 
even just that of a rational-basis review.

302
Part V: Addressing Liberties and Modifying the Government: More Amendments 
Does the word numbers refer to numbers of voters or numbers of inhabitants? 
The word persons shows that it refers to the size of the population, not to the 
number of voters, though that should not make any real difference. If state X 
has twice the population of state Y, the number of voters in X is likely to be 
roughly double that of the voters in Y.
So, a state with a population of 10 million must have twice the number of 
representatives of a state with only 5 million inhabitants. Fine. Nothing 
strange about that.
What other basis could there possibly be for apportioning representatives? 
And how come this basic rule of proportionality first appears in an amendment 
dating from 1868, 80 years after ratification of the Constitution in its original 
form?
 
The answer to this puzzle lies in the Civil War. Under the original Constitution, 
voting rights were not exactly proportional to population. Slave states were 
given a special concession. They were allowed an additional three-fifths of a 
vote for every slave — who of course didn’t have the right to vote.
That’s why the proportional principle appears for the first time here in the 
Fourteenth Amendment, after the abolition of slavery by the Thirteenth 
Amendment, ratified in 1865.
Denying or abridging the right to vote
The whole of the rest of Section 2 is about what happens if a state “denies or 
abridges” any of its citizens’ right to vote. This mammoth clause — all one 
sentence — clearly envisages a state preventing a sizeable number of its 
citizens from voting. If a state does that, it loses the relevant proportion of its 
representation.
Let me take as a hypothetical example a state with 30 seats in the House of 
Representatives. If that state denies or abridges (reduces in any way) the 
voting rights of 10 percent of its voters, that state loses 10 percent of its 
seats. So, that state’s representation is reduced from 30 to 27.
This provision has never been put into practice, and the clause doesn’t say 
who has the power to strip a state of part of its representation in this way. 
Did southern states fall under this provision in the early 20th century by 
introducing literacy tests and poll taxes in order to reduce the number of 
black voters? Possibly, but none of those states ever had its representation 
reduced, although literacy tests and poll taxes were declared unconstitutional.
Let me just explain a couple of dated terms in this section:

303
 Chapter 21: The Fourteenth Amendment: Ensuring Equal Protection
 
✓ “Indians not taxed”: Native Americans were not automatically U.S. 
citizens until the passing of the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924. So they 
were not counted in the population of the states where they lived until 
then — unless they had acquired U.S. citizenship by marriage, by serving 
in the U.S. army, or by special treaty.
 
✓ Males aged 21: Why are states to be punished only when they deny or 
abridge the voting rights of males over 21? Does this mean that it’s okay 
to deny or abridge the rights of women or male voters under 21? Not 
anymore, because this provision was amended by
 
• The Nineteenth Amendment, ratified in 1920, which gave women 
over 21 the right to vote.
 
• The Twenty-Sixth Amendment, ratified in 1971, which lowered the 
voting age to 18.
 
✓ “Rebellion or other crime”: Denying or abridging the voting rights “for 
participation in rebellion, or other crime” doesn’t result in any reduction in 
representation. Does this mean that it’s okay to deny or abridge voting 
rights for these reasons? Or does it only mean that denying or abridging 
voting rights for these reasons doesn’t reduce a state’s representation? 
There’s no agreement on this point. “Participation in rebellion” means 
siding with the Confederacy in the Civil War. This provision is academic 
because not too many graybacks (Confederate soldiers) are still around. 
What about felons? Unfortunately, felons are never in short supply. 
This provision of the Fourteenth Amendment has never been applied 
to deprive them of the vote, but many states have laws doing so, either 
only when they are actually doing jail time or, in many cases, even after 
their release from prison.
Disqualifying Confederates from Office
Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment bars from public office anyone in 
public office before the Civil War who then supported the Confederacy. This 
section was aimed at the leading figures in the Confederacy, most of whom 
had held public office in the pre-war United States.
After the war, Jefferson Davis, the first and only President of the Confederacy, 
was elected to the U.S. Senate again by the state legislature of Mississippi, 
but this provision in the Fourteenth Amendment prevented him from taking 
his seat.
The section ends with a clause of remarkable foresight, allowing Congress to lift 
the service ban on a particular individual by a two-thirds majority vote in both 
houses. In 1978, Congress applied this provision and lifted the ban posthumously 
on Jefferson Davis and the Confederate commander, General Robert E. Lee.

304
Part V: Addressing Liberties and Modifying the Government: More Amendments 
Repudiating Confederate Debts
Section 4 of the Fourteenth Amendment is in two parts. The first part pro-
claims: “The validity of the public debt of the United States . . . shall not be 
questioned.” This provision is hard to understand in isolation, but it becomes 
clear when you read the second part. This part repudiates all Confederate 
debts and makes it clear that the United States would not pay compensation 
to slave owners for the loss of their slaves.
Empowering Congress
The fifth and last section of the Fourteenth Amendment is brief:
The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the 
provisions of this article.
The same wording is also found at the end of the Thirteenth, Fifteenth, 
Nineteenth, Twenty-Third, Twenty-Fourth, and Twenty-Sixth amendments.
You may wonder why Congress needs to be given this power. Does the 
amendment not speak for itself? None of the first ten amendments contains 
any such provision, so why do so many later amendments need it?
The answer is that this provision was first used just after the Civil War, which 
gave the federal government much more power than before. The Civil War 
also resulted in great distrust between different sectors of U.S. society.
The Voting Rights Act of 1965 is a good recent example of a law passed by 
Congress under this provision. Section 4(e) of that Act says that “no person 
who has completed the sixth grade” in a school in Puerto Rico “shall be dis-
franchised for inability to read or write English.”
This section came before the U.S. Supreme Court in the case of Katzenbach 
v. Morgan in 1966. The question before the high court was whether Congress 
had the power to enact section 4(e). The objection to this section was that it 
went well beyond the Fourteenth Amendment itself. Another objection was 
that it was contrary to the fundamental principle of the separation of powers, 
because Congress was here usurping the Supreme Court’s position as inter-
preter of the Constitution.
The court in Katzenbach ruled that section 4(e) was not unconstitutional 
and that Congress had been quite entitled to pass it. But the approach of the 
Supreme Court has changed since then and is now less prepared to allow 
Congress to interpret the Constitution as it likes.

T
he U.S. Constitution is more than 200 years old, but it hasn’t remained

✓ 1788 — The original Constitution is ratified, which is made up of all 
those heavy articles about what Congress, the President, and the 
Supreme Court can and cannot do.
 
✓ 1791 — Ratification of the first ten amendments, or the Bill of Rights, 
takes place.
 
✓ 1865 — The end of the Civil War ushers in some pretty important 
amendments prohibiting discrimination on grounds of race and 
dictating to the states.
 
✓ 1870 to the present — A grab bag of 13 diverse amendments have been 
passed, most of which are not very well known.
I deal with the 13 latest amendments in this chapter. I take them one by one.
Removing Race Qualifications for Voting: 
The Fifteenth Amendment
The Fifteenth Amendment is the last of three amendments introduced in the 
wake of the Civil War. The Thirteenth Amendment abolished slavery. The 
Fourteenth Amendment went further and declared that “all persons born or 

306
Part V: Addressing Liberties and Modifying the Government: More Amendments 
naturalized in the United States . . . are citizens of the United States and of the 
State wherein they reside.”
Didn’t this provision automatically take care of voting rights? No, because 
the states each had their own rules governing voting rights. So citizenship 
alone didn’t guarantee the right to vote. Hence the need for the Fifteenth 
Amendment, ratified in 1870, the main part of which reads as follows:
The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or 
abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or 
previous condition of servitude.
The meaning of this provision is self-explanatory: Racial voting qualifications 
are no longer allowed. But is this all that the amendment means?
Some people, including some who are regarded as constitutional law experts, 
have suggested that the Fifteenth Amendment contains a “cluster” of rights 
that go way beyond the simple right to vote in elections. Where do these 
people get this idea from? Their argument runs along these lines:
 
✓ The Fifteenth Amendment confers the right to vote.
 
✓ But the right to vote isn’t confined to voting in elections.
 
✓ Congressmen and other legislators also have the right to vote — for or 
against bills.
 
✓ So the Fifteenth Amendment must include the right to run for election to 
Congress and state legislatures.
 
Is this argument correct? No. It’s one of many examples of trying to change the 
Constitution by reading stuff into it that isn’t actually there. Here’s why the 
argument that I’ve just summarized is wrong:
 
✓ The original draft of the Fifteenth Amendment presented to Congress 
contained the right to run for election as well as the right to vote. The 
right to run for election was dropped from the final version.
 
✓ The reason for this change was that this amendment was difficult 
enough to pass in its cut-down form. In 1868, 11 of the then 21 northern 
states denied blacks the right to vote. New York withdrew its ratification 
of the Fifteenth Amendment and then re-ratified it as power shifted in 
that state. Delaware ratified it only in 1901, Oregon in 1959, California in 
1962, Maryland in 1973, Kentucky in 1976, and Tennessee in 1997.
 
✓ Does the right to vote in elections automatically include the right to run for 
election? No. Check out the Twenty-Sixth Amendment, whose wording mir-
rors that of the Fifteenth Amendment in extending the right to vote to all U.S. 
citizens “who are eighteen years of age or older.” Does this amendment give 
18-year-olds the right to run for Congress? Not at all. You’ve got to be at least 
25 to run for the House of Representatives, and there are a couple of other 
requirements too, as laid down by Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution.

307
 Chapter 22: Starts, Stops, and Clarifications: Amendments since 1870
The meaning of the Fifteenth Amendment isn’t a problem. But the amend-
ment does have two other major problems:
 
✓ Was the Fifteenth Amendment validly ratified?
 
• It was proposed in 1869 by a Congress from which the 11 former 
breakaway Confederate states were excluded.
 
• Ten of these southern states ratified it only because the First 
Reconstruction Act of March 2, 1867 — passed over the veto of 
President Andrew Johnson — gave all adult black males in those 
states the right to vote as a precondition of readmission of those 
states into the Union.
 
✓ Did the Fifteenth Amendment have any effect in practice? In the North, 
yes. But in the border states, and in the South after 1876, blacks tended 
to be excluded from the vote by the imposition of literacy tests and poll 
taxes. Literacy tests were finally outlawed by the Voting Rights Act of 
1965, and poll taxes were eventually declared unconstitutional by the 
U.S. Supreme Court in 1966.
 
 After the end of Reconstruction in 1877, the Republican Party in the 
South collapsed. The Democratic Party controlled the “solid South,” as 
it came to be known, until the 1960s. So, the really important election 
in the Southern states was not the general election but the Democratic 
primary. Here’s what a Texas statute said that was still in force in 1924: 
“in no event shall a negro be eligible to participate in a Democratic party 
primary election held in the State of Texas.” The U.S. Supreme Court 
declared this particular law unconstitutional, but it was not until 1944 
that all-white primaries were completely banned.
Letting Uncle Sam Raid Your Piggy 
Bank: The Sixteenth Amendment
Can Uncle Sam legally tax you on your income? You may resent this govern-
ment power, but it is kosher. However, that hasn’t always been the case. 
Income tax is a direct tax because it’s paid directly to the government. But it 
was unknown in the early days of the Republic. The earliest form of direct tax 
was a capitation tax — or poll tax — a flat tax of the same amount payable by 
everybody regardless of wealth or earnings.
Article I, Section 9 contains this little tidbit about direct taxes:
No Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion to the 
Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken.

308
Part V: Addressing Liberties and Modifying the Government: More Amendments 
A capitation tax is of course automatically in proportion to population — but 
income tax normally varies according to income, which prevents it from 
being proportional to population.
Income tax was first introduced in 1861 to pay for the Civil War. It was 
abolished in 1872, and when the government tried to reintroduce it in 1894 it 
was immediately challenged. In 1895 the U.S. Supreme Court declared income 
tax unconstitutional.
However, most politicians recognized the need for income tax. In the 
presidential election of 1912, all three main candidates — incumbent 
President William H. Taft, former President Theodore Roosevelt, and the 
winner, Woodrow Wilson — supported the legalization of income tax. The 
Sixteenth Amendment was introduced precisely to achieve that objective. 
Here’s what it says:
The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from 
whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, 
and without regard to any census or enumeration.
Electing the Senate: The Seventeenth 
Amendment
The Framers of the Constitution didn’t trust the people. Under the original, 
unamended Constitution, the House of Representatives was the only directly 
elected body. Article I, Section 3 provided that
The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from 
each State, chosen by the Legislature thereof . . .
The Senate was intended to balance the House in two ways:
 
✓ By favoring the smaller states — because each state regardless of size is 
entitled to two senators. California with its population of 36 million has 
two senators, and Wyoming, with just over half a million, also has two 
senators.
 
✓ By being selected by the state legislatures rather than directly elected by 
the people.
U.S. senators were originally seen as ambassadors of their states. The states 
kept their senators on a tight rein and actually instructed them how to vote 
on particular issues — something that never happened with members of the 
House, who were not chosen by state legislatures.

309
 Chapter 22: Starts, Stops, and Clarifications: Amendments since 1870
The system of state-appointed senators worked smoothly at first, but in 
the run-up to the Civil War, difficulties started appearing. The two houses 
of a state legislature didn’t always agree on who the senators from that 
state should be. Federal legislation required the winning candidate to have 
obtained a majority (more than 50 percent) in the state legislature, but some 
states allowed candidates to be declared elected when they had only a 
plurality of votes in the legislature (meaning more than any other candidate).
In the 1850s, one of the senate seats for Indiana was vacant for two years 
because of the inability of the Democrats and the fledgling Republican Party 
to work together. The situation got a lot worse as the 19th century drew to a 
close. Between 1891 and 1905, there were no fewer than 45 deadlocks in 20 
states. For four years Delaware had only one senator. In some states the 
legislature left the choice of senators to a popular referendum.
Between 1893 and 1902, popular pressure mounted for the Senate to be 
directly elected, and each year a constitutional amendment to that effect 
was proposed in Congress only to be defeated — not surprisingly — in the 
Senate. By 1913, such was the pressure on Congress that only one more state 
was needed to call a national constitutional convention.
The prospect of a national convention has always terrified Congress, because 
once a convention was summoned there was no guarantee that it would limit 
itself to considering the one amendment that had brought it into existence. 
It could well become a loose cannon destroying the whole carefully crafted 
fabric of the Constitution. The prospect of a national convention quickly 
galvanized Congress into action in 1913, and what became the Seventeenth 
Amendment was soon ratified, simply providing for the direct election of 
senators by the people of each state.
Outlawing Liquor: The Eighteenth 
Amendment
The Eighteenth Amendment, ratified in 1919, banned the manufacture, sale, 
transportation, import, or export of all “intoxicating liquors,” which were 
defined by a companion Act of Congress as any beverage containing over 0.5 
percent alcohol.
The evils of alcohol had been preached since early colonial days, and 
Massachusetts banned the sale of “strong liquor” in 1657. However, the 
temperance movement really came into its own after the Civil War. The 
Prohibition Party was founded in 1869, and in 1873 the influential Women’s 
Christian Temperance Union came into existence.

Part V: Addressing Liberties and Modifying the Government: More Amendments 
Although only one congressman and one governor were ever elected on the 
Prohibition Party ticket, the party managed to get liquor banned in many 
cities and a number of states. During World War I, the pressure on lawmakers 
by the prohibition lobby was so great that Congress proposed the Eighteenth 
Amendment in 1917, and it was ratified in 1919. Two states, Connecticut and 
Rhode Island, rejected the amendment and never ratified it.
 
The Eighteenth Amendment is an excellent example of just how impossible it 
is to change human nature by legislation — and how disastrous it is even to 
try. As a direct result of prohibition, illegal, or bootleg, liquor became available 
in speakeasies: illicit, disguised bars. Prohibition was the best thing that ever 
happened to the mafia, which took full advantage of it.
Giving Women the Vote: The 
Nineteenth Amendment
Did women first get the right to vote in the United States as a result of the 
ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920? Yes and no. The Nineteenth 
Amendment gave the right to vote to all women in the nation over the age 
of 21. However, women had the vote in New Jersey between 1776 and 1807. 
Wyoming Territory gave women the vote in 1869. Colorado followed suit in 
1893, and Utah in 1896.
The drive for votes for women across the nation began in earnest with the 
formation of the National Woman Suffrage Association in 1869. This organization 
lobbied every Congress between 1869 and 1919. In 1915, a woman’s suffrage 
bill was brought before the House of Representatives but was defeated by 
174 to 204 votes.
In 1918, President Woodrow Wilson put his weight behind an amendment 
extending the vote to women. On January 10, 1918, a bill proposing this 
amendment passed the House with just one vote more than the two-thirds 
required. In the Senate, the proposed amendment lost out by two votes in 
September 1918. When it was presented to the Senate again in February 1919, 
it was only one vote short of the requisite two-thirds majority.
President Wilson was anxious to get the amendment passed in time for the 
election of 1920, in which he was planning to run for a third term. He called a 
special session of Congress to consider the proposed amendment. This time 
it passed the House with 42 votes to spare, and the Senate also accepted it 
with a victorious margin of two votes.
The amendment was quickly ratified by the three-fourths of the states 
required by the Constitution, but a few states held out. The last states to 
ratify it were eight southern states. Mississippi ratified it only in 1984.

311
 Chapter 22: Starts, Stops, and Clarifications: Amendments since 1870
The wording of the Nineteenth Amendment was borrowed from the Fifteenth 
Amendment. Here’s the main part of the amendment:
The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or 
abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.
Moving Out of the Horse and Buggy Age: 
The Twentieth Amendment
In the time of George Washington, travel was slow and roads were bad. So the 
Founders allowed a period of four months between the presidential election 
and the inauguration. The original, unamended Constitution fixed March 4 as 
the date when all presidential and congressional terms started. This arrange-
ment meant that, when there was a change of President, the nation had to 
endure a four-month period of a lame-duck administration.
The Twentieth Amendment fixed a much earlier date, January 20, for presi-
dential inaugurations, and January 3 for the start of congressional terms.
The amendment also dealt with a couple of other questions, notably: What 
happens if a president-elect dies before taking office? Answer: The Vice 
President-elect becomes President. Surprisingly, the Twentieth Amendment 
did not address the more basic question: If the President dies in office and is 
succeeded by the Vice President, does the Vice President become President 
or only Acting President? This issue was left to be dealt with by the Twenty-
Fifth Amendment.
The Twentieth Amendment met with very little opposition. It was passed 
by Congress on March 2, 1932, and was finally ratified on January 23, 1933. 
The first presidential term it applied to was when Franklin D. Roosevelt suc-
ceeded himself as President on January 20, 1937.
Repealing Prohibition: The 
Twenty-First Amendment
The Eighteenth Amendment introducing Prohibition is the only amendment 
ever to have been repealed. This was done by the Twenty-First Amendment 
just under 14 years after Prohibition had been introduced.
What happened in that short time to turn opinion so completely around? 
In fact, local politicians hadn’t really changed their minds because many of 
them either owed the Prohibition lobby favors or else were afraid of the influ-
ence wielded by that lobby in their localities.

312
Part V: Addressing Liberties and Modifying the Government: More Amendments 
But Prohibition had never been that popular among ordinary Americans. 
After Prohibition ushered in an orgy of crime, Congress was determined to 
end Prohibition, and it used the nation’s deep-seated dislike of Prohibition 
to achieve this end. So, after handily passing the proposed Twenty-First 
Amendment, Congress stipulated that ratification was to be effected not by 
the state legislatures but by the alternative method laid down in Article V 
of the Constitution — by special conventions in the individual states. The 
Twenty-First Amendment was the only amendment ever ratified this way.
South Carolina rejected the Twenty-First Amendment, and the voters of 
North Carolina refused even to call a convention to consider it. But all the 
other states held conventions that duly accepted the amendment.
 
It’s important to realize, however, that the Twenty-First Amendment doesn’t 
just repeal the Eighteenth Amendment. It does so in Section 1, but it then goes 
on to provide that
The transportation or importation into any State, Territory, or possession of 
the United States for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors, in viola-
tion of the laws thereof, is hereby prohibited.
This section enabled any state that wanted to remain “dry” to do so. 
Mississippi was the last state to remain dry, which it was until 1966, and 
Kansas banned public bars until 1987. There are still over 500 dry municipali-
ties in the nation because many states have delegated the power to ban alco-
hol to local authorities.
Taking George Washington’s Lead: 
The Twenty-Second Amendment
Article II, Section 1 of the original, unamended Constitution set the 
President’s term of office at four years, but it didn’t place any limit on the 
number of times that a president could be reelected.
George Washington was elected President without any opposition in 1788 
and again in 1792. He would undoubtedly have been reelected without any 
problem in 1796 as well, but he decided that he’d had enough. So he deliv-
ered his famous Farewell Address — not a live speech, incidentally, but 
an open letter to the nation carried by many newspapers — and retired to 
Mount Vernon to dedicate himself to farming and to the construction of a 
large whiskey distillery.
As two terms were good enough for the Father of the Nation, that should 
be enough for anybody. That was the conventional wisdom on the subject. 
Thomas Jefferson recognized the danger of the absence of term limits on the 

313
 Chapter 22: Starts, Stops, and Clarifications: Amendments since 1870
tenure of the presidency. In 1807 he wrote, “If some termination to the ser-
vices of the chief Magistrate be not fixed by the Constitution, or supplied by 
practice, his office, nominally four years, will in fact become for life.” In other 
words, according to Jefferson, either the Constitution had to set a limit or 
else some limit should be set by convention.
Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and James Monroe — all of whom were 
two-term Presidents — respected Washington’s example and didn’t attempt 
to run for a third term. They effectively established a convention that was fol-
lowed, sometimes reluctantly, until Franklin Delano Roosevelt decided to run 
for a third term in 1940.
Roosevelt, ever the wily politician, employed a ruse to get over the two-
term tradition. First, he switched the 1940 Democratic Party Convention 
to Chicago, which was controlled by a tightly organized Democratic Party 
machine — which of course also controlled the public address system in 
the convention hall. Then FDR disarmed his opponents by announcing that 
he would not run unless drafted, and that the delegates were free to vote 
for whoever they liked. Dead on cue, the loudspeakers in the hall screamed: 
“We want Roosevelt . . . The world wants Roosevelt!” The delegates joined in 
the manufactured frenzy and nominated Roosevelt by 946 votes to 147. After 
that, winning the general election was a walk in the park. And, having shat-
tered the two-term mold, Roosevelt had no trouble getting nominated for a 
fourth term, which he again easily won, though with a reduced majority. He 
died less than three months after his fourth inauguration.
When the Republicans swept Congress in the 1946 midterm elections, they 
were determined to prevent any future president from emulating Roosevelt’s 
successful flouting of the two-term limit. They recognized that to achieve this 
aim they needed a constitutional amendment. So in March 1947 Congress 
passed a proposal to enforce the two-term limit. The proposal became the 
Twenty-Second Amendment, which was finally ratified in February 1951. Only 
two states rejected it: Oklahoma and Massachusetts.
The main part of the Twenty-Second Amendment reads as follows:
No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, 
and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, 
for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected 
President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.
Here’s what it means:
 
✓ You can’t be elected to more than two presidential terms — regardless 
of whether they are consecutive or not.
 
✓ If you have succeeded to the presidency on the death, removal, or 
resignation of the President and have served more than two years of 
that President’s term, you can’t be elected President yourself more 
than once.

314
Part V: Addressing Liberties and Modifying the Government: More Amendments 
 
✓ If you have succeeded to the presidency on the death, removal, or 
resignation of the President and have served two years or less of that 
President’s term, you can be elected President yourself a maximum of 
two times.
 
✓ If you have been filling in for an indisposed President only as Acting 
President, you can be elected President yourself for a maximum of two 
terms, unless you have been Acting President for more than two years, 
in which case you can’t be elected President yourself more than once.
One thing that the Twenty-Second Amendment doesn’t do is to place any 
term limit on the vice presidency. No, sirree! You can be elected Veep as 
many times as you like — or rather, as many times as the voters like.
Repeal of the Twenty-Second Amendment has been suggested several times, 
notably in the 1980s in order to “win one more for the Gipper” (Ronald 
Reagan) and again in the 1990s to elect Bill Clinton to a third term. Those 
moves came to nothing.
Enfranchising the Nation’s Capital: 
The Twenty-Third Amendment
When the Constitution was ratified in its original form in 1788, New York 
City was the nation’s capital. But the so-called “District Clause” in Article I, 
Section 8 of the Constitution made provision for a purpose-built new capital, 
which was to be under the exclusive authority of Congress. Washington, 
D.C. became the nation’s capital and the seat of the federal government on 
December 1, 1800 — on land ceded by Virginia and Maryland.
William Henry Harrison, the short-lived ninth President who died on April 4, 
1841, just one month into his term of office, championed the cause of the 
inhabitants of the nation’s capital in his long inaugural address. He described 
them as being “deprived of many important political privileges,” adding, “The 
people of the District of Columbia are not the subjects of the people of the 
States, but free American citizens.”
By 1960, when the District of Columbia had a bigger population than 13 of 
the 50 states, Congress proposed the Twenty-Third Amendment giving the 
District of Columbia three electoral votes in presidential elections — the 
same number as the smallest states, whose entitlement is calculated by 
adding their two senators to their single representative in the House. The 
amendment was ratified in 1961 and was first applied in the 1964 presidential 
election.

315
 Chapter 22: Starts, Stops, and Clarifications: Amendments since 1870
 
In regard to presidential elections, therefore, the District is now treated as if it 
were a state. It is important to realize, however, that the amendment does not 
make the District a state.
The District has no representation in the U.S. Senate, but since 1971 it has 
sent a delegate to the House of Representatives. Until 1993, the delegate from 
the District, in common with the delegates from the U.S. territories, didn’t 
have voting rights. That changed in 1993, but voting rights (except in com-
mittees) were lost again two years later after the Republicans gained control 
of the House. In 2007, the House gave the D.C. delegate the right to vote in 
the Committee of the Whole, which considers amendments — subject to the 
proviso that if the delegate’s vote tips the balance, the vote is taken again 
without the delegate’s participation.
Proposed amendments to make the District a state (possibly under the title 
of “New Columbia,” which makes it sound like an encyclopedia), or at least 
to give it proper representation in Congress, have all failed. Any such amend-
ment would have the effect of repealing the “District Clause” in Article I of the 
Constitution, which places Washington, D.C. under congressional authority. 
The real reason for opposition to congressional representation for D.C. is 
political — because the District is solidly Democratic.
Banning Tax Barriers to Voting: 
The Twenty-Fourth Amendment
After the end of Reconstruction in the South in 1877, barriers were erected 
to reduce the number of blacks registering as voters. The two most common 
ways of discouraging voting were literacy tests and taxation, especially the 
poll tax. No fewer than 11 southern states introduced a poll tax requirement 
for voting. This was a simple tax of a fixed sum to be paid by everybody, 
regardless of race, color, earnings, or wealth.
 
In what way was the poll tax disadvantageous to blacks? Proof that you had 
paid your poll tax was often made a condition of voting in an election. But 
some southern states had a “grandfather clause” that allowed you to vote 
regardless of whether you’d paid your poll tax or not — provided your grand-
father had voted at a named date before the abolition of slavery. This type of 
clause placed blacks and poor whites at a disadvantage as compared with 
property-owning white men.
The amount of the poll tax was usually quite low. In Georgia it was limited 
by law to $1 per person per year. In Breedlove v. Suttles, decided by the 
U.S. Supreme Court in 1937, a 28-year-old white man was denied the right 

316
Part V: Addressing Liberties and Modifying the Government: More Amendments 
to vote because he hadn’t paid his poll tax, which was a condition of voting 
under Georgia law. He claimed that the tax infringed on his rights under the 
Fourteenth and Nineteenth amendments. The court dismissed his applica-
tion. Justice Pierce Butler, writing for the court, pointed out that voting rights 
are determined not by federal but by state law, and that, within the bounds of 
the Constitution, “the state may condition suffrage as it deems appropriate.” 
He went on to rule that “The payment of poll taxes as a prerequisite to voting 
is a familiar and reasonable regulation long enforced in many states and for 
more than a century in Georgia.”
Although Breedlove was white, objections to the poll tax came mainly from 
blacks. So, in 1962 Congress proposed the Twenty-Fourth Amendment to 
make it unlawful to make the right to vote conditional on the payment of the 
poll tax or any other tax. The amendment was finally ratified on January 23, 
1964, but several southern states never ratified it.
The main part of the Twenty-Fourth Amendment reads as follows:
The right of citizens of the United States to vote in any primary or other 
election for President or Vice President, for electors for President or Vice 
President, or for Senator or Representative in Congress, shall not be denied 
or abridged by the United States or any State by reason of failure to pay any 
poll tax or other tax.
The wording of the amendment makes sure it covers all bases — but only in 
respect to federal elections. It doesn’t cover state elections at all.
So it was left to the U.S. Supreme Court to ban the use of poll taxes as a con-
dition for voting in state elections. It did so in the 1966 case Harper v. Virginia 
Board of Elections. Justice William O. Douglas, writing for the majority, ruled 
as follows:
We conclude that a State violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 
Fourteenth Amendment whenever it makes the affluence of the voter or pay-
ment of any fee an electoral standard. Voter qualifications have no relation 
to wealth nor to paying or not paying this or any other tax.
Hugo Black, one of the three dissenting justices, stressed that the majority 
decision “is to no extent based on a finding that the Virginia law as written or 
as applied is being used as a device or mechanism to deny Negro citizens of 
Virginia the right to vote on account of their color.”
Justice Black then rounded on the majority for departing without good 
reason from the unanimous decision in Breedlove and for amending the 
Constitution, which the court is not allowed to do under Article V.

Succeeding to the Presidency: 
The Twenty-Fifth Amendment
The Twenty-Fifth Amendment, ratified in 1967, made some arrangements 
about the presidency and vice presidency, most of which ought to have been 
tackled much earlier.
Succeeding as President 
or Acting President?
When the President dies, resigns, or is removed from office, does the Vice 
President become President or only Acting President?
By 1967, this question had long been settled in practice. When President 
William Henry Harrison died on April 4, 1841, just one month after his 
inauguration, he was succeeded by Vice President John Tyler. But was 
Tyler then President or only Acting President? Article II, Section 1, Clause 6 
of the Constitution was ambiguous. Tyler, a southern Democrat in a Whig 
administration, was surrounded by enemies who did not want him to be the 
President but only Acting President — the Vice President acting as President. 
Tyler himself was equally adamant that he was the President, and he managed 
to get Congress to agree.
Tyler struck a blow not only for himself but also for all subsequent Vice 
Presidents succeeding to the presidency, all of whom were recognized as 
being presidents and not just acting presidents.
The Twenty-Fifth Amendment belatedly endorsed Tyler’s position — luckily, 
otherwise we’d have to renumber all the presidents since 1841 and disqualify 
a few of them. Section 1 of the amendment provides in clear and simple 
terms that
In case of the removal of the President from office or of his death or 
resignation, the Vice President shall become President.
Replacing the Veep
The next question that the Twenty-Fifth Amendment addresses was completely 
neglected for 180 years: Who takes over as Vice President when the Vice 
President becomes the President — or when the Veep simply drops dead 
(which has also happened)?

318
Part V: Addressing Liberties and Modifying the Government: More Amendments 
The answer to this question until the Twenty-Fifth Amendment came along 
was: nobody. That’s right. The Constitution previously just allowed the vice 
presidency to remain vacant. Was that a problem? Not really, because since 
1792 there has been a Presidential Succession Act laying down a long and 
detailed line of succession to the presidency.
But now Section 2 of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment provides for the appoint-
ment of a new Vice President when the vice presidency falls vacant. Here’s 
what it says:
Whenever there is a vacancy in the office of the Vice President, the 
President shall nominate a Vice President who shall take office upon 
confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress.
This provision has been used twice. The first time was when President 
Richard Nixon picked Congressman Gerald Ford to succeed Spiro Agnew 
when Agnew resigned as Vice President in 1973. Then, when Ford became 
President on Nixon’s resignation in 1974, Ford appointed former New York 
Governor Nelson Rockefeller as Vice President.
Acting as President
Sections 3 and 4 of the Twenty-Fifth Amendment deal with another neglected 
(but this time very real) problem — arrangements for when the President is 
incapacitated. These sections provide that, when that situation occurs, the 
Vice President becomes “Acting President.”
Amazingly, the presidency lasted for 180 years without any such provision 
in place — although there was clearly a need for it. For example, in 1881, 
President James Garfield lingered for 80 days before dying from an assassin’s 
bullet, during which time he was unable to attend to affairs of state. President 
Woodrow Wilson’s incapacity from a stroke was kept even from his Vice 
President and Cabinet — by his wife, who was the effective President for the 
last year and a half of his second term.
Section 3 provides for the situation when the President himself recognizes 
his incapacity, which was done once by President Ronald Reagan and twice 
by President George W. Bush. On all three occasions, the transfer of power to 
the Vice President as “Acting President” lasted a very short time.
Section 4, which has never been used, deals with the much trickier situation 
when the Vice President and Cabinet decide that the President is “unable to 
discharge the powers and duties of his office.” This provision is potentially 

319
 Chapter 22: Starts, Stops, and Clarifications: Amendments since 1870
dangerous, as it could be used as a political weapon against a president who 
is disliked by his Vice President and a majority of his Cabinet — which is not 
at all impossible.
Lowering the Voting Age: The 
Twenty-Sixth Amendment
The voting age was 21 until the ratification of the Twenty-Sixth Amendment in 
1971, which lowered it to 18. What was the justification for this change?
The Vietnam War was probably the main reason for lowering the voting age. 
Young men became liable for the draft at age 18. “Old enough to fight, old 
enough to vote” was a slogan that became popular during that time.
In 1970, Congress passed a law lowering the minimum voting age to 18 for all 
elections, state and federal alike. The state of Oregon challenged the law’s 
constitutionality. In Oregon v. Mitchell, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that 
Congress could set the voting age for federal elections but not for state and 
local elections.
This ruling was impractical. States wanting to leave the minimum voting age 
at 21 would have had to establish two voters’ rolls, one for federal elections 
and the other for state and local elections.
Congress therefore decided to short-circuit the court ruling by amending the 
Constitution. The result was the Twenty-Sixth Amendment, which was ratified 
on July 1, 1971.
The wording of the amendment is copied from that of the Fifteenth and 
Nineteenth amendments. The main part of it reads as follows:
The right of citizens of the United States, who are eighteen years of age or 
older, to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any 
State on account of age.
The amendment was ratified in record time — just over three months from 
passing Congress to ratification by three-fourths of the states. The reason for 
this enthusiasm on the part of the states was no doubt because it saved the 
states from the muddle that would have resulted from an attempt to imple-
ment the Supreme Court ruling in Oregon v. Mitchell.

320

Limiting Congressional Pay Raises: 
The Twenty-Seventh Amendment
A fun amendment at last! The Twenty-Seventh Amendment is of interest less 
for what it says than for the way it was ratified. It was proposed by Congress 
in 1789 but was ratified only in 1992, more than 200 years later. I discuss this 
curious constitutional footnote in Chapter 5. Check it out.
The Twenty-Seventh Amendment reads as follows:
No law varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and 
Representatives shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall 
have intervened.
This seems to be saying that if members of Congress vote themselves a pay 
raise, the new salaries can’t come into effect until after a congressional 
election. This looks good because voters would be unimpressed by senators 
and representatives who’d voted themselves more money — so members of 
Congress would be less likely to do so, in case the voters turned them out in 
the intervening election.
However, Congress has gotten around this sensible provision by voting 
themselves annual cost-of-living adjustments, or COLAs. The U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled in 2001 that COLAs are not 
repugnant to the Twenty-Seventh Amendment. The U.S. Supreme Court 
has yet to pronounce on this question. Watch this space.

Chapter 23
Ten Landmark Constitutional Cases
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding that leading cases are not necessarily good decisions
▶ Illustrating how two bunches of judges can disagree totally
▶ Tracing the Supreme Court’s attitude toward presidential privilege
T
he best-known Supreme Court decisions have effectively changed the 
Constitution and expanded the power of the court in the process. But 
are these decisions necessarily good? No, because the Constitution does not 
actually give the court the power to encroach on the authority of Congress or 
the President. Some Supreme Court justices have recognized this problem. In 
the words of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, an advocate of judicial restraint, 
“I do not think the United States would come to an end if we lost our power 
to declare an Act of Congress void.”
In addition to facts about these cases, in this chapter I sometimes offer 
commentary, which I’ve put in italic. To help you see the judicial process in 
perspective, I don’t discuss these cases in chronological order. Instead, after 
the first one, I’ve grouped them loosely by subject matter.
Marbury v. Madison (1803)
Marbury v. Madison established the U.S. Supreme Court’s right of judicial 
review — the power to strike down a law as unconstitutional. As I explain 
in Chapter 12, William Marbury was appointed a Justice of the Peace by 
outgoing President John Adams. But the new Secretary of State, James 
Madison, refused to deliver Marbury’s commission — the formal document 
of appointment. Marbury asked the U.S. Supreme Court to order Madison to 
hand him his commission.
Chief Justice John Marshall, writing for the court, held that
 
✓ Madison’s refusal to deliver the commission to Marbury was unlawful. 
This is undoubtedly correct.

324
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ But the Supreme Court did not have the power to make such an order. 
This is not actually correct.
 
✓ Because the law that purportedly gave the Supreme Court this power 
was itself invalid. This is also probably wrong.
 
✓ And the Supreme Court had the power to strike down invalid laws. 
Yeah? The Constitution sure doesn’t say so, although Alexander Hamilton 
in the influential Federalist Papers, written in 1788, assumed that the Court 
had this power.
This judgment is an excellent example of Marshall’s “twistifications” (Thomas 
Jefferson’s term). Note that Marshall should have recused himself from 
hearing the case anyway because the whole case arose out of the failure of 
President John Adams’s Secretary of State to give Marbury his commission. 
And who was that Secretary of State? Why, none other than John Marshall 
himself!
Here’s what Jefferson himself said about Marshall’s new doctrine of judicial 
review: “The opinion which gives to the judges the right to decide what laws 
are constitutional and what not . . . would make the Judiciary a despotic 
branch.”
Brown v. Board of Education (1954)
In Brown v. Board of Education, a unanimous Supreme Court outlawed racial 
segregation in public schools throughout the United States. In so doing, the 
court declared 17 state laws unconstitutional, including some from northern 
states. The court also overturned its own 1896 ruling in Plessy v. Ferguson 
that had approved the “separate but equal” formula, which had said that it 
was okay to provide separate facilities for the different races as long as those 
facilities were equal.
In Brown, Chief Justice Earl Warren crafted a short opinion that commanded 
unanimous support. Here are the main points he made:
 
✓ The history of the Fourteenth Amendment with respect to segregated 
schools was “inconclusive.” Not at all! The Fourteenth Amendment, ratified 
in 1868, gives Congress the power to enforce it. Congress exercised this 
power by enacting several laws. But none of these laws says anything about 
segregation in education — which must mean that Congress did not then 
regard segregated schools as being a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.
 
✓ “We cannot turn the clock back to 1868 when the Amendment was 
adopted.” Warren was not interested in finding out the meaning of the 
amendment in 1868 — nor even the intention of its framers. He adopted 
the “living Constitution” approach, enabling him to interpret the amend-
ment any way he liked.

325
 Chapter 23: Ten Landmark Constitutional Cases 
 
✓ “Segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detri-
mental effect upon the colored children.” And years of forced integration 
by busing didn’t really help.
 
✓ “We conclude that in the field of public education the doctrine of ‘sepa-
rate but equal’ has no place. Separate educational facilities are inher-
ently unequal.” True. Yet the long-term effect of heavy-handed judicial 
intervention has been “white flight” to the suburbs, a huge increase in the 
number of white kids in private education, and a serious decline in the 
standards of the predominantly black inner city schools.
Parents Involved in Community Schools 
v. Seattle School District No. 1 and 
Meredith v. Jefferson County Board of 
Education (2007)
These are two separate cases that the high court heard together. Chief 
Justice John Roberts filed an opinion that marks a major retreat from Brown 
v. Board of Education while cleverly using that case as a precedent.
The main question before the court was this: Is it constitutional for a school 
district to use race as a factor in assigning students to public schools? 
Roberts’s 5–4 majority said no.
The Chief Justice went on — with the support of only three other justices — 
to quote the unanimous Brown II (a sequel to the original Brown decision) 
holding that school districts should “achieve a system of determining admis-
sion on a nonracial basis.” Doing so enabled him to end his opinion with a 
flourish: “The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop dis-
criminating on the basis of race.”
West Coast Hotel v. Parrish (1937)
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt had no trouble getting his New Deal leg-
islation passed through Congress, but the Supreme Court struck down one 
New Deal program after another as unconstitutional (see Chapter 9).
The judicial attack on the New Deal was spearheaded by four conservative 
justices — nicknamed the “Four Horsemen” (of the Apocalypse) — supported 
by swing vote Justice Owen Roberts. Their opposition to the New Deal was 
based on the principle of freedom of contract.

326
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Roosevelt retaliated with a proposal that would have allowed him to pack 
the court with his own nominees. (The Constitution doesn’t establish a 
specific number of Supreme Court justices, so FDR proposed adding six new 
justices — one for every member of the Court who was older than 70
1⁄2 at that 
time.)
Seeing the writing on the wall, Justice Roberts changed sides in West Coast 
Hotel v. Parrish — the famous “switch in time that saved nine” (justices). The 
Court’s decision upheld a minimum wage law in Washington State, and the 
outcome signaled a movement away from supporting the freedom of contract 
(see Chapter 9). In the words of Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, “The 
Constitution does not speak of freedom of contract.”
This case is important because it illustrates how two bunches of judges can 
interpret the Constitution in totally opposite ways. It also shows that a strong 
president can get in on the act of constitutional interpretation.
United States v. Lopez (1995)
This was the first high court decision since 1937 to limit government regulation 
of the economy. A 1990 federal law used the Commerce Clause as the basis 
for prohibiting anyone from knowingly carrying a gun in a school zone. The 
Supreme Court declared this law unconstitutional, noting that the law in 
question was a “criminal statute” that had nothing to do with commerce. I 
discuss this case in much more detail in Chapter 9.
Kelo v. City of New London (2005)
Susette Kelo lost her lovely old house. The City of New London, Connecticut, 
had condemned her home and 114 other lots in a working-class neighborhood 
in the interests of “economic development.” However, the beneficiaries of 
this program were not the public at large, but Pfizer, the pharmaceutical 
giant, and a property development corporation — a private entity.
Does the “takings clause” in the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution entitle 
a city to take property from private citizens for the benefit of other private 
citizens and corporations? By a 5–4 majority, the high court said yes, even 
though the Constitution says that private property can be taken only for 
“public use.”
It’s significant that in this case, the four liberal justices on the court (plus 
swing-vote Justice Anthony Kennedy) supported heavy-handed local 
government power against the interests of poor property owners. On the 
other hand, the conservative minority stood up for the rights of the 

327
 Chapter 23: Ten Landmark Constitutional Cases 
individual. In her dissent, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor cited a 1798 opinion 
condemning “a law that takes property from A. and gives it to B.” as “against 
all reason and justice.”
United States v. Nixon (1974)
Does the President enjoy absolute immunity from judicial process (except 
impeachment)? A unanimous high court said no.
Claiming “executive privilege,” President Richard Nixon refused to hand over 
audiotapes of conversations that took place in the Oval Office. A unanimous 
high court (without Justice William Rehnquist, who had recused himself) 
admitted that the President enjoyed a certain limited executive privilege but 
that “the legitimate needs of the judicial process may outweigh Presidential 
privilege.” The court ordered Nixon to hand over the tapes. He did so and 
resigned shortly afterward.
Nixon v. Fitzgerald (1982)
This case decided that the President is “entitled to absolute immunity from 
damages liability predicated on his official acts” — and he remains immune 
from suit for his official acts taken while in office, even after he is out of 
office. Writing for the majority, Justice Lewis Powell based this conclusion on 
the “President’s unique office, rooted in the constitutional tradition of sepa-
ration of powers and supported by our history.”
Does this decision contradict the unanimous ruling in the 1974 case just 
discussed? Probably not. But it sure seems strange that the President can’t 
be sued for anything he does in his official capacity, yet when it comes to 
demands for documents produced in his official capacity, the court decides 
how much executive privilege he’s allowed!
Clinton v. Jones (1997)
This case is the flip side of Nixon v. Fitzgerald. In that case, the high court 
ruled that the President is totally immune from civil suits for anything he 
does in his official capacity. In this later case, a unanimous high court held 
that the President is not immune from suit for anything that he did before he 
became president — and that such private lawsuits can go ahead even while 
the President is still in office. What about civil lawsuits arising out of private 
acts that the President commits while in office? Can a sitting president be 
sued for these too? Yes, apparently so.

328
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
The case arose out of a civil suit brought against President Bill Clinton 
by Paula Jones, who accused Clinton of sexual harassment while he was 
Governor of Arkansas. The case led indirectly to Clinton’s impeachment. 
(Clinton survived the impeachment process and was acquitted, thereby 
remaining in office for his entire term.)
Boumediene v. Bush (2008)
Did foreign terrorist suspects detained at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, have the 
right to challenge their detention in the U.S. courts? By a 5–4 majority the 
court ruled that the detainees did have this right, which is known as habeas 
corpus. Here are the points made by the majority on the court:
 
✓ Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution prohibits the suspension of 
habeas corpus by Congress “unless when in Cases of Rebellion or 
Invasion the public safety may require it.”
 
✓ Habeas corpus had not been formally suspended, so the Military 
Commissions Act passed by Congress in 2006 amounted to an 
unconstitutional suspension of habeas corpus.
 
✓ Therefore, the foreign Guantanamo detainees have the right to habeas 
corpus just like everybody else.
Guantanamo Bay is not part of the United States; it is part of Cuba. But the 
United States has an indefinite lease and control over it. Justice Antonin 
Scalia classified Guantanamo as foreign territory. He dissented with what he 
called the “crazy result” of the majority ruling, holding that
Today, for the first time in our Nation’s history, the Court confers a 
constitutional right to habeas corpus on alien enemies detained abroad by 
our military forces in the course of an ongoing war.
Chief Justice John Roberts, who also dissented, asked,
So who has won? Certainly not the American people, who today lose a bit 
more control over the conduct of this Nation’s foreign policy to unelected, 
politically unaccountable judges.
Note this attack by the Chief Justice himself on judicial activism!
As I write these words, President Barack Obama has signed an executive 
order to close the Guantanamo detention center.

Chapter 24
Ten Influential Supreme 
Court Justices
In This Chapter
▶ Tracing the court’s power
▶ Recognizing the importance of judicial restraint
▶ Identifying some big hitters in the court’s history
T
he U.S. Supreme Court has experienced an exponential increase in power 
and influence since it opened for business in 1789. In the early days, the 
court didn’t even have a building to call its own, and it was unsure of the 
extent of its powers. John Jay, the first Chief Justice, lamented that the court 
lacked “the energy, weight, and dignity which are essential to its affording 
due support to the national government.”
That all changed with the appointment of John Marshall as Chief Justice in 
1801. Marshall started the transformation that has made the court probably 
the most important branch of government.
But is the expansion of the power of the court necessarily a good thing? The 
other two branches of government — Congress and the President — are 
popularly elected. By contrast, the court is made up of unelected justices 
appointed “during good Behaviour,” meaning essentially for life. This 
arrangement protects the independence of the judiciary. Alexander Hamilton 
remarked in the Federalist Papers, written in 1788 (before the Constitution 
came into force), that this security of tenure was “the best expedient which 
can be devised in any government, to secure a steady, upright, and impartial 
administration of the laws.”
But appointment for life also enables the judiciary to butt into areas reserved 
to the other two branches of government — particularly by making law 
rather than merely interpreting it, as judges are supposed to do.

330
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Among the ten most influential Supreme Court justices that I introduce in this 
chapter, I include some judicial activists and some practitioners of judicial 
restraint. (Keep in mind that no judge ever labels himself a judicial activist. 
That label yells that the judge in question habitually exceeds the proper 
powers of a judge or justice.)
John Marshall
John Marshall was the longest serving Chief Justice in U.S. history, hold-
ing office from 1801 until his death in 1835. He was also the most influential 
Supreme Court justice.
As a person, Marshall was easygoing, affable, friendly, and unassuming. Even 
Marshall’s political enemies liked him — except Thomas Jefferson, who was 
actually a distant cousin of his. Jefferson realized that Marshall’s bland exte-
rior concealed a wily nature and a crafty mind. “You must never give him an 
affirmative answer,” said Jefferson, “or you will be forced to grant his conclu-
sion. Why, if he were to ask me if it were daylight or not, I’d reply, ‘Sir, I don’t 
know, I can’t tell.’”
Some of Marshall’s “twistifications of the law” (Jefferson’s phrase) occurred 
in the following leading cases:
 
✓ Marbury v. Madison: This case established the right of the Supreme 
Court to declare Acts of Congress unconstitutional and therefore void. I 
discuss this landmark case in Chapter 23.
 
✓ Fletcher v. Peck: This was the first case in which the Supreme Court 
struck down a state law as unconstitutional — while upholding a corrupt 
contract.
 
✓ McCulloch v. Maryland: This case established the supremacy of federal 
law over state law.
 
✓ Cohens v. Virginia: This case established the power of the Supreme 
Court to hear all cases involving constitutional issues.
 
✓ Gibbons v. Ogden: In this case, the Supreme Court held that the 
Commerce Clause in the U.S. Constitution gave Congress a power over-
riding state law. I deal with the sticky subject of the Commerce Clause in 
Chapter 9. Read it at your peril!
John Marshall wrote the opinion of the Supreme Court in all these cases, and 
in 519 of the 1,106 opinions filed by the court during his tenure.

331
 Chapter 24: Ten Influential Supreme Court Justices
Marshall had the mind of a lawyer but the heart of a politician. His judicial 
decisions were heavily influenced by his political views, which
 
✓ Favored a strong federal government over states’ rights
 
✓ Promoted the power of the Supreme Court over that of Congress and the 
Presidency
 
✓ Advanced commercial and industrial interests over rural and agrarian 
concerns
Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.
Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., who was an associate justice from 1902 to 1932, is 
still probably the most oft-quoted Supreme Court justice of all time.
A strong believer in freedom of speech, Holmes nevertheless upheld the 
conviction of a socialist for exhorting draftees in World War I to oppose the 
draft. Holmes found that the words used created “a clear and present danger 
that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to 
prevent.” Holmes added that “The most stringent protection of free speech 
would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing 
panic.”
Holmes is less well known for his practice of judicial restraint — his reluc-
tance to interfere with laws passed by elected legislatures. But sometimes he 
went too far in this direction, as when he upheld Virginia’s compulsory steril-
ization law with the flippant remark, “Three generations are enough.”
Louis Brandeis
Louis Brandeis is particularly well known for his championing of the right 
of privacy. In his dissent in Olmstead v. United States, he claimed that the 
U.S. Constitution protected this right and declared in ringing tones that the 
right of privacy was “the most comprehensive of rights and the right most 
valued by civilized men.” That was in 1928. But it took nearly 40 years before 
the majority on the court came around to Brandeis’s view, in Katz v. United 
States, decided in 1967 — by which time Brandeis was long dead.
Between 1932 and 1937, Brandeis was known as one of the “Three Musketeers”: 
liberal justices highly supportive of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New 
Deal legislation. Brandeis advocated judicial restraint as part of his respect for 
two kinds of separation of power that he identified as vertical (federal/states/
individual) and horizontal (legislative/executive/judicial).

332
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Felix Frankfurter
Felix Frankfurter was named to the Supreme Court by FDR in 1939 and served 
until 1962. Frankfurter was particularly influenced by Oliver Wendell Holmes, 
Jr., and became the court’s firmest adherent of judicial restraint.
Although his politics were liberal, Frankfurter’s belief in judicial restraint led 
him to file some surprising opinions — and earned him the animosity of other 
liberal justices on the court. In Minersville School District v. Gobitis, decided 
in 1940, two Jehovah’s Witnesses were expelled from public school for refus-
ing on religious grounds to salute the flag, which was mandatory under state 
law. Frankfurter wrote the majority opinion upholding the state law and the 
expulsions. In a later case on the same subject, he opined, “As judges, we are 
neither Jew nor Gentile, neither Catholic nor agnostic.”
In Korematsu v. United States, decided during World War II, the Supreme 
Court ruled in favor of federal laws that ordered the internment of Japanese 
Americans. Frankfurter wrote an opinion upholding the constitutionality of 
the laws, without approving or disapproving of them. “That is their business, 
not ours,” he wrote — an excellent example of his judicial restraint.
When Earl Warren became Chief Justice in 1953, Frankfurter tried desperately 
to win him over to judicial restraint. Warren’s increasing commitment to 
judicial activism created a rift between them manifested by sharp exchanges 
in open court. In opposition to Warren’s politics-driven approach to law, 
Frankfurter opined, “The Supreme Court exists to establish rules of law, not 
to provide justice.”
Earl Warren
President Dwight Eisenhower was looking for a conservative Chief Justice 
when he nominated Earl Warren to fill that seat in 1953. Warren soon turned 
out to be a liberal activist who hugely expanded the power of the court. 
Eisenhower regretted his choice, remarking that his nomination of Warren 
“was the biggest damned-fool mistake I ever made.”
A typical example of Warren’s views is the opinion that he wrote in 1967 
ruling that a member of the Communist Party could not be barred from work-
ing in a defense establishment — even though there was a federal law against 
it. Two justices dissented, noting that “Nothing in the Constitution requires 
this result.”

333
 Chapter 24: Ten Influential Supreme Court Justices
Warren is best known for his opinion in Brown v. Board of Education striking 
down state laws that established segregated public schools. Referring spe-
cifically to this decision, Supreme Court Justice James F. Byrnes said, “The 
Court did not interpret the Constitution — the Court amended it.” (I deal with 
Brown in Chapter 23.)
In Miranda v. Arizona, decided in 1966, Warren’s opinion commanded only 
a 5–4 majority. But this was yet another landmark decision that cast a long 
shadow. The ruling in this case introduced the familiar Miranda warning that 
you’ve heard so many times on TV and in the movies: “You have the right 
to remain silent. . . .” Three dissenting justices maintained that the major-
ity decision “represents poor constitutional law and entails harmful conse-
quences for the country at large.”
Thurgood Marshall
Thurgood Marshall was the first African American to sit on the court, serving for 
24 years, from 1967 until 1991. A straight line can be drawn from Marshall’s 
appointment in 1967 to the election of another African American lawyer as 
the first black President in 2008. It’s hard to envision the election of President 
Barack Obama without the long struggle for black civil rights so successfully 
waged by Thurgood Marshall.
As chief counsel for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored 
People (NAACP) between 1940 and 1961, Marshall argued 32 cases before the 
Supreme Court — of which he won no fewer than 29! The best-known of his 
victories was the earth-shattering 1954 case of Brown v. Board of Education, 
which forever consigned the doctrine of “separate but equal” to the trash can 
of history.
Marshall’s time on the court was marked by his championing of liberal 
causes, most of which are less fashionable today. Here’s a bird’s-eye view of 
two of Marshall’s key issues:
 
✓ Death penalty: Marshall and his close ally Justice William Brennan 
consistently held that the death penalty always amounted to “cruel and 
unusual punishment” prohibited by the Eight Amendment. Their stance 
caused the death penalty to be suspended between 1972 and 1976.
 
 Since 1976, the majority on the court has rejected the view that capital 
punishment is automatically unconstitutional. In the 2008 decision in 
Baze v. Rees, the high court found execution by lethal injection to be 
constitutional. At the time of this writing, capital punishment is permitted 
in 36 states.

334
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Affirmative action: Allan Bakke, a white man, was twice rejected for 
admission to medical school by the University of California (UC) Davis. 
Bakke’s qualifications were superior to those of 16 minority students 
who were admitted under the university’s affirmative action program. 
Bakke claimed that he was the victim of racial discrimination. When 
Bakke’s case reached the Supreme Court in 1978, the majority on the 
court held that race could be taken into account together with other 
factors in determining admissions to a university, but that a fixed quota 
system such as the one operated by UC Davis was unconstitutional.
 
 Marshall robustly dissented from this conclusion. He came out strongly 
in support of the university’s affirmative action program favoring the 
admission of minorities. Marshall didn’t even mention Bakke’s claim that 
he was the victim of racial discrimination himself.
 
 Today, more than 30 years later, the majority on the court opposes 
discrimination of any kind, and they recognize that affirmative action 
is by its very nature discriminatory. In the words of Chief Justice John 
Roberts in a 2007 majority opinion striking down race-based student-
assignment systems by public school districts in Louisville, Kentucky 
and Seattle, Washington, “The way to stop discrimination on the basis of 
race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.”
William Rehnquist
Only 9 percent of people participating in a 1989 public opinion poll knew that 
the Chief Justice was William Rehnquist — 54 percent thought that position 
was held by Judge Joseph Wapner of The People’s Court.
Despite this rebuff, Rehnquist’s name is unlikely to be forgotten — and 
not only because of his 32-year membership on the court. As Chief Justice, 
Rehnquist managed to nudge the court in a more conservative direction than 
before, but he was not completely consistent in his views:
 
✓ “The new federalism”: Rehnquist frequently championed the rights 
of the states against the federal government. This stance is sometimes 
termed “the new federalism.” For example, in United States v. Lopez, 
decided in 1995, Rehnquist was just able to scrape together a majority of 
justices to strike down a federal law prohibiting the carrying of firearms 
in a school zone.
 
✓ Miranda: After repeatedly impugning the constitutionality of the 
Miranda warning, in 2000 Rehnquist wrote an opinion that commanded 
a 7–2 majority in favor of Miranda.

335
 Chapter 24: Ten Influential Supreme Court Justices
 
✓ Bush v. Gore: Rehnquist headed up a bare majority of the court that 
handed the presidency to George W. Bush in 2000. Rehnquist’s pre-
paredness to get involved in this highly controversial political issue was 
itself an exercise in judicial activism, which he had so often condemned.
 
✓ “Illegal enemy combatants”: Rehnquist joined the majority in Hamdi v. 
Rumsfeld in 2004, holding that a U.S. citizen being detained as an “illegal 
enemy combatant” has the right to apply to a court for judicial review.
Rehnquist said he wanted to be remembered above all as a good administrator. 
Yet, the Supreme Court over which he presided was very divided. He was 
able to command a majority only by moderating — and sometimes completely 
changing — his views. But he held fast to a belief in the right of majority 
opinion to prevail, which kept him from taking extreme positions.
Sandra Day O’Connor
Sandra Day O’Connor was the first woman ever to sit on the U.S. Supreme 
Court, which she did from 1981 to 2006. This fact alone earned her a place in 
history. But she deserves to be remembered for her opinions too — and for 
her tactics, which gave her added influence as the swing vote in a number of 
leading cases.
O’Connor adopted a case-by-case approach to her work on the court, which 
enabled her to switch sides when it suited her. For example, she was on dif-
ferent sides in two cases decided in 2003 about the affirmative action admis-
sions policy of the University of Michigan Law School. The court decided 
both cases by a 5–4 majority — and O’Connor was in the majority both times!
Among her many skillful tightrope acts was her opinion in Webster v. 
Reproductive Health Services, a case on abortion. She was careful to oppose 
overturning Roe v. Wade while effectively cutting back on it. As so often was 
the case, she managed to be the swing vote in a 5–4 majority decision.
Antonin Scalia
Antonin Scalia has served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court since 
1986. He is an originalist — believing that the Constitution means what it 
meant to the Framers. He is, in general, a conservative in political terms, but 
his strict view of the Constitution has sometimes given him strange bedfellows.

336
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
For example, in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, he was allied with liberal Justice John 
Paul Stevens in taking an uncompromising stand against the U.S. government.
In general, however, Scalia’s conservatism has gotten the better of his 
originalism when the rights of the President are at stake, as in Hamdan v. 
Rumsfeld, involving the rights of detainees held at Guantanamo Bay.
Scalia’s inflexibility and doctrinaire, even pedantic, approach to the law have 
limited his influence on his fellow justices — except in one respect. Scalia 
early on started subjecting counsel to the third degree with quick-fire ques-
tions. This novel approach soon caught on amongst new appointees to the 
court (except for Justice Clarence Thomas, who generally maintains a stony 
silence throughout).
John Roberts
John Roberts has been Chief Justice since the death of William Rehnquist in 
2005. Roberts has already put his stamp on the court, although it’s still too 
early to say whether he will emerge as one of the really big hitters of all time.
The first change he introduced was to lose the rather pompous and almost 
comical gold stripes that Rehnquist had had sewn onto his robe to differenti-
ate himself from mere associate justices. By departing from this non-tradition, 
Roberts signaled that he was just one of the boys (and girls).
This action chimed in with Roberts’s declared aim of achieving more unanim-
ity on the court. But this intention has not stopped him from following his 
conservative views, even at the expense of bitter recriminations from those 
who disagree with him. The cases in question have involved police searches, 
desegregation, and women’s rights.

Chapter 25
Two Sides of Five Constitutional 
Conundrums
In This Chapter
▶ Asking some of the big constitutional questions
▶ Understanding why there is never agreement on constitutional issues
▶ Recognizing that some constitutional principles are a double-edged sword
D
ear Reader, please don’t think you’ve been short-changed. Yes, I know 
that this is “The Part of Tens” and this chapter contains only five sections. 
But please don’t go back to the bookstore — or worse, the publishers — and 
ask for your money back! I couldn’t do justice to more than these five topics 
in the limited space available for this chapter. But I have given you both sides 
of the argument on all these highly controversial issues — and two times five 
equals ten!
The point of this chapter is to identify some issues that are at the forefront of 
debate on the Constitution. These are
 
✓ Whether the Constitution is still relevant today
 
✓ Whether presidential elections are truly democratic
 
✓ Whether the Supreme Court has too much power
 
✓ How to interpret the Constitution
 
✓ Whether the President has too much power
Is the Constitution Outdated?
The U.S. Constitution is more than 220 years old. If the Constitution were 
a person, it would be long dead — or, at the very least, extremely frail and 
completely out of touch with the realities of modern life! Is the Constitution 
any different?

338
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Here are some arguments in favor of the view that the Constitution is 
outdated:
 
✓ When the Constitution was drafted, not only were there no cheeseburgers, 
no cell phones, and no MP3 players — which some people today regard 
as necessities — but there also were no automobiles, no airplanes, no 
electricity, no TV, and no computers. It really was a totally different 
world.
 
✓ Social values were way different then too: Slavery was rife, the death 
penalty was unquestioned, and women had no legal rights.
 
✓ A constitution emanating from such an alien background can remain 
relevant only if it’s constantly reinterpreted by the Supreme Court to 
keep abreast of changing values.
But a lot of people reject this approach. Here are some of the arguments 
against the view that the Constitution is outdated:
 
✓ The core values enshrined in the Constitution are timeless and 
represent the underpinnings of this country as originally conceived.
 
✓ The Constitution is a force for stability in law, government, and society.
 
✓ Only by sticking closely to the original meaning of the Constitution 
could the Supreme Court achieve a uniform approach to it.
 
✓ A proliferation of inconsistent interpretations of the Constitution 
could lead people to lose respect for the Supreme Court — and for the 
Constitution itself.
 
✓ It’s wrong for judges to second-guess the Framers of the Constitution, 
because that would amount to changing the meaning of the Constitution.
 
✓ The Supreme Court is not allowed to change the Constitution. That can 
be done only by the elaborate process of amendment as laid down in the 
Constitution itself.
Should the Electoral College 
Be Abolished?
The Framers of the Constitution didn’t trust the ordinary people. In the 
original, unamended Constitution, the House of Representatives was the 
only directly elected body. Senators were originally chosen by the state 
legislatures, and the President was elected by an Electoral College.

339
 Chapter 25: Two Sides of Five Constitutional Conundrums
The Electoral College system is still in force for presidential elections. The 
rise of political parties has made the whole operation much more democratic 
than the Framers ever intended, but it’s still not completely democratic. (See 
Chapter 10 for an explanation of how the system works.)
Here are some of the undemocratic features of the Electoral College system, 
which have resulted in calls for its abolition:
 
✓ Although members of the Electoral College are pledged to support a 
particular candidate for President, there have been no fewer than 
158 “faithless electors” over the years in votes for President or Vice 
President. Although pledged to vote for a particular candidate, these 
electors all cast their votes for somebody else.
 
 In 71 of the 158 cases, the voting change made perfect sense because 
the pledged candidate had died before the election. But the remaining 
cases have been more complex. The biggest defection occurred in 1836, 
when all 23 of Virginia’s electors who had pledged to vote for Martin 
Van Buren as President refused to vote for his running mate, Richard M. 
Johnson, because he had been living with a family slave with whom he 
had two daughters.
 
✓ With the exception of Maine and Nebraska, the candidate winning a 
plurality of the popular vote in a state carries that state and takes all its 
electoral votes. For example, in 2000, the whole election turned on a 
few votes in Florida. By declaring George W. Bush the winner of the 
popular vote in Florida, the U.S. Supreme Court gave him all 25 of Florida’s 
electoral votes and thus handed him the presidency.
 
✓ This winner-takes-all arrangement can result in the candidate with the 
smaller number of popular votes becoming president. This happened in 
1824, 1876, 1888, and 2000, and possibly also in 1960.
 
✓ In the event of a tie in the Electoral College, the election of the President 
is thrown into the House of Representatives, with each state having just 
a single vote — hardly a democratic solution.
On the other hand, the Electoral College also has its supporters, who point 
out that
 
✓ The Electoral College system reflects and maintains the federal structure 
of the nation. No state, however small, has fewer than three electoral 
votes — because the number of electoral votes allocated to a state is 
the number of representatives from that state in the House, plus two, for 
its two senators. This formula compensates the smaller states for their 
lower levels of population.

340
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Although the election result is calculated by the total number of electoral 
votes won by each candidate across the nation, the number of states 
carried by each candidate is also important, as is the result in each 
particular state. Take, for example, the significance of Al Gore’s failure 
to carry his home state, Tennessee, in the 2000 election — which cost 
him the election. He wouldn’t have needed to carry Florida if he’d had 
Tennessee’s 11 electoral votes under his belt.
 
✓ The Electoral College favors the two-party system by making it harder 
for a third party to break through. Some people think this is a bad 
feature of the Electoral College system. But if the President was directly 
elected by popular vote, the practical result of a serious third-party 
challenge would likely throw the election into the House of Representatives. 
In both 1992 and 1996, the Reform Party candidate, Ross Perot, took 
enough votes to deprive either of the major party candidates of a 
majority of the popular vote. Without the Electoral College, both of 
these elections would have been decided by the House.
Does the U.S. Supreme Court 
Have Too Much Power?
Thomas Jefferson completely rejected Chief Justice John Marshall’s claim 
in Marbury v. Madison, decided in 1803, that the Supreme Court had the 
exclusive right to decide the constitutionality of a law. Jefferson remarked, 
quite correctly, that “there is not a word in the Constitution which has given 
that power to them [the Supreme Court justices] more than to the Executive 
or Legislative branches.”
However, Marshall had the last word and scored a lasting victory over 
Jefferson in that case, which I discuss in Chapter 23. A century later, Chief 
Justice Charles Evans Hughes could say, “We are under a Constitution, but 
the Constitution is what the judges say it is.” (Hughes’s remark was not 
meant as a criticism.)
Hughes’s observation is still correct and, since 1791, the Constitution has 
changed far more as a result of judicial interpretation than through formal 
amendments. Here are some major constitutional changes brought about by 
the court’s decisions:
 
✓ Enforcing “freedom of contract” as a supposed constitutional principle 
in 1905 — and abandoning it 30 years later. The court then went to the 
opposite extreme of supporting tight central government control of 
the economy through a broad interpretation of the Commerce Clause. 
Since 1995, there have been intermittent signs of a return to more states’ 
rights. I discuss the Commerce Clause in Chapter 9.

341
 Chapter 25: Two Sides of Five Constitutional Conundrums
 
✓ Outlawing segregation in public schools in 1954 — overruling a Supreme 
Court decision from half a century earlier.
 
✓ Approving the use of busing to achieve desegregation of public schools. 
Busing is now largely abandoned.
 
✓ Providing additional protection for criminal defendants, for example by 
requiring the well-known Miranda warning.
 
✓ Disapproving of the death penalty in 1972 in Furman v. Georgia — even 
though it’s explicitly referred to in the Constitution. Within four years, 
the Supreme Court pulled back from this position. Capital punishment is 
now lawful in 36 states and in federal law.
 
✓ Establishing the expectation of privacy as a constitutionally-protected right.
 
✓ Supporting a woman’s right to have an abortion (within certain time 
constraints).
The question here is not whether you agree or disagree with any of these 
Supreme Court rulings, but rather whether these are matters that should 
be decided by judges at all. Most of them have involved striking down state 
laws, and in some cases they struck down federal laws as well. In my opinion, 
these decisions should have been left to legislators. Here’s why:
 
✓ Judges are unelected, so they should not strike down laws passed by 
democratically elected legislatures. In the words of Chief Justice William 
Rehnquist, “How can government by the elected representatives of the 
people coexist with the power of the federal judiciary . . . to declare 
invalid laws duly enacted by the popular branches of government?”
 
✓ Supreme Court decisions have no teeth. (I’m not referring here to the 
justices’ dental health, although they are allowed to continue to sit on 
the bench until they drop stone dead!) The court has no police force to 
ensure obedience to its decisions.
 
✓ Judge-made law is also contrary to the fundamental constitutional prin-
ciple of the separation of powers. The Supreme Court is part of the judi-
ciary, but laws are supposed to be created only by a legislature.
 
✓ The U.S. Supreme Court is a branch of the federal government. When 
it strikes down state laws, this amounts to an attack on federalism and 
democracy alike.
Why do some people believe it’s a good idea for the high court to have 
such sweeping powers? The most common argument in favor of the court’s 
power relates to the concept of the living Constitution. The idea is that the 
Constitution needs to be constantly reinterpreted in order to reflect society’s 
changing values and needs. For example, Professor Michael C. Dorf wrote a 
2008 article in support of the living Constitution position, arguing that those 
who ratified the Constitution in its original form didn’t include any women or 
slaves — but “the Constitution’s current authority derives at least in substan-
tial part from the fact that we the living people accept it as authoritative.”

342
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Why Is There No Agreed-Upon 
Interpretation of the Constitution?
“Do you think the Constitution of the United States could have one meaning 
this week and another meaning next week?” Senator James Eastland hurled this 
challenge at William Brennan during the Senate hearings to confirm Brennan as 
a high court justice in 1957. The senator was expressing a widely shared con-
cern about unelected judges taking it upon themselves effectively to amend the 
Constitution in accordance with their personal beliefs and opinions.
Brennan had a ready retort, explaining, “We look to the history of the time 
of framing and to the intervening history of interpretation. But the ultimate 
question must be, what do the words of the text mean in our time?” Brennan 
maintained that if the words of the text mean something different today from 
what they meant 220 years ago — or even 20 years ago — the court must 
simply dump the old meaning in favor of the current meaning.
Brennan belonged to the living Constitution school of thought, which I discuss 
in Chapter 12 (along with the competing schools of thought regarding how to 
interpret the Constitution).
For example, Brennan, following Chief Justice Earl Warren, held that the 
phrase “cruel and unusual punishments” in the Eighth Amendment “must 
draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the 
progress of a maturing society.” This approach allowed Brennan to con-
clude that the death penalty is always automatically a violation of the Eighth 
Amendment and is therefore unconstitutional.
Brennan’s approach has a certain attraction. A point in its favor is that 
figuring out what a particular word or phrase meant to the Framers two 
centuries ago can be tough. It’s also undeniable that concepts and values 
change over time.
 
But, in my opinion, adherents of the living Constitution school fall into a 
serious logical trap, for these reasons:
 
✓ Values may have changed since 1788, but current values are far from 
unanimous. For judges to decide what the applicable values are today 
gives them a blank check to fill out with their own personal values. The 
death penalty is a good example. Justice Brennan was totally opposed to 
capital punishment in any shape or form, but polls show that about three-
fourths of the U.S. population consistently supports the death penalty.
 
✓ Champions of the living Constitution are in danger of confusing what 
the Constitution says with what they would like it to say. For example, 
the Constitution clearly recognizes and accepts capital punishment, 
which is mentioned three times in the Fifth Amendment and again in the 
Fourteenth Amendment.

343
 Chapter 25: Two Sides of Five Constitutional Conundrums
So, if the Constitution accepts the death penalty as valid, what does it mean 
by “cruel and unusual punishments”? A long line of cases shows that this 
phrase refers only to extreme forms of the death penalty and other punishments, 
such as burning at the stake, boiling in oil, racking, and other forms of torture.
For those people who would like the Constitution to say that any kind of 
capital punishment constitutes “cruel and unusual punishments,” Article V of 
the Constitution tells them how to get their wish — by means of the proper 
democratic process of amendment.
Does the President Have 
Too Much Power?
The U.S. president is arguably the most powerful leader in the world. But this 
has not always been the case. In the 19th century, the only presidents who 
interpreted their constitutional powers broadly and acted accordingly were 
Andrew Jackson, James K. Polk, and Abraham Lincoln. The 20th century began 
with another strong president, Theodore Roosevelt, but it was only Franklin 
Delano Roosevelt who established the modern imperial presidency, where the 
President is more powerful than he is entitled to be under the Constitution.
Two areas of particular concern about the degree of presidential power are 
terrorism and war powers. Let me look briefly at these.
 
✓ Terrorism: What powers does the President have to curb terrorism?
 
• Does the President have the power to detain a U.S. citizen indefi-
nitely as an “enemy combatant”? In Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, decided in 
2004, a majority on the Supreme Court said no. Justice Clarence 
Thomas in a powerful lone dissent opined that “This detention falls 
squarely within the Federal Government’s war powers, and we lack 
the expertise and capacity to second-guess that decision.”
 
• In Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, decided in 2006, the President lost again. 
(Note that despite the similarity in name, this case is entirely 
separate from Hamdi v. Rumsfeld.) The question before the Supreme 
Court was whether it was legal for “enemy combatants” to be tried 
by military commissions. The majority on the court said no. Justice 
Clarence Thomas, dissenting, claimed that the majority opinion 
“openly flouts our well-established duty to respect the Executive’s 
judgment in matters of military operations and foreign affairs.”
 
✓ War powers: The Constitution gives Congress the power “To declare 
War,” but it makes the President the Commander in Chief. Does this 
mean that the President’s role as Commander in Chief takes effect only 
after Congress has made a declaration of war? If that is the right 
interpretation, then most presidents since World War II have acted 

344
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
unconstitutionally — because Congress has not made a single formal 
declaration of war since that time. And even the War Powers Act of 
1973 would be unconstitutional because, although the Act limits the 
President’s power to wage war without the consent of Congress, it does 
not prohibit it. However, the War Powers Act has never been declared 
unconstitutional.
 
 In October 2002, Congress passed a Joint Resolution authorizing 
President George W. Bush “to use the Armed Forces of the United 
States as he determines necessary and appropriate in order to defend 
the national security of the United States against the continuing threat 
posed by Iraq.” This resolution was certainly not a declaration of war 
against Iraq but claimed to be based on the War Powers Act. Did this 
Joint Resolution authorize the President to invade Iraq? It’s not clear, 
but the President certainly applied it in that sense.
So, does the President have too much power in the two areas we have looked 
at? He certainly has a good deal of power, which, however, is restricted by a 
Constitution that clearly was not intended to create an imperial presidency. 
If the Supreme Court or Congress wishes to rein the President in on the basis 
of a close reading of the Constitution, it would be difficult for the President to 
break free.
In 1861, without consulting Congress, President Abraham Lincoln suspended 
habeas corpus — the right of a detained person to challenge his detention 
in court. Chief Justice Roger B. Taney roundly condemned the President’s 
action in the case of John Merryman. Lincoln, said the Chief Justice, “cer-
tainly does not faithfully execute the laws if he takes upon himself the legisla-
tive power, by suspending the writ of habeas corpus, and the judicial power 
also, by arresting and imprisoning a person without due process of law.” 
Lincoln simply ignored Taney’s ruling. A 21st-century president could hardly 
do the same!

he shall return it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have 
originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and

ARTICLE II
Section 1. The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United 
States of America. He shall hold his Office during the Term of four Years, and, 
together with the Vice President, chosen for the same Term, be elected, as 
follows:
Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may 
direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and 
Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no 
Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit 
under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.
[The Electors shall meet in their respective States, and vote by Ballot for 
two Persons, of whom one at least shall not be an Inhabitant of the same 
State with themselves. And they shall make a List of all the Persons voted 
for, and of the Number of Votes for each; which List they shall sign and certify, 
and transmit sealed to the Seat of the Government of the United States, 
directed to the President of the Senate. The President of the Senate shall, 
in the Presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the 
Certificates, the Votes shall then be counted. The Person having the greatest 
Number of Votes shall be the President, if such Number be a Majority of 
the whole Number of Electors appointed; and if there be more than one 
who have such Majority, and have an equal Number of Votes, then the 
House of Representatives shall immediately chuse by Ballot one of them for 
President; and if no Person have a Majority, then from the five highest on the 
list the said House shall in like Manner chuse the President. But in chusing 
the President, the Votes shall be taken by States, the Representation from 
each State having one Vote; a quorum for this Purpose shall consist of a 
Member or Members from two thirds of the States, and a Majority of all the 
States shall be necessary to a Choice. In every Case, after the Choice of the 
President, the Person having the greatest Number of Votes of the Electors 
shall be the Vice President. But if there should remain two or more who have 
equal Votes, the Senate shall chuse from them by Ballot the Vice President.] 

352
U.S. Constitution For Dummies 
[The preceding section in square brackets has been changed by the Twelfth 
Amendment.]
The Congress may determine the Time of choosing the Electors, and the Day 
on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout 
the United States.
No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at 
the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office 
of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall 
not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a 
Resident within the United States.
In Case of the Removal of the President from Office, or of his Death, 
Resignation, or Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of the said 
Office, the Same shall devolve on the Vice President, and the Congress may 
by Law provide for the Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both 
of the President and Vice President, declaring what Officer shall then act 
as President, and such Officer shall act accordingly, until the Disability be 
removed, or a President shall be elected. [The preceding provision has been 
affected by the Twenty-Fifth Amendment.]
The President shall, at stated Times, receive for his Services, a 
Compensation, which shall neither be encreased nor diminished during the 
Period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within 
that Period any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them.
Before he enter on the Execution of his Office, he shall take the following 
Oath or Affirmation: “I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully 
execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my 
Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.”
Section 2. The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy 
of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called 
into the actual Service of the United States; he may require the Opinion, in 
writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon 
any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices, and he shall 
have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United 
States, except in Cases of Impeachment.
He shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, 
to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur; and 
he shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, 
shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, judges 
of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose 
Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be 
established by Law: but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of 
such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the 
Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.

353
 Appendix: Constitution of the United States of America
The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen 
during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire 
at the End of their next Session.
Section 3. He shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the 
State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as 
he shall judge necessary and expedient; he may, on extraordinary Occasions,

An in-depth look at the defining 
document of America
Want to make sense of the U.S. Constitution? This plain-
English guide walks you through this revered document, 
explaining how the articles and amendments came to 
be and how they have guided legislators, judges, and 
presidents and sparked ongoing debates. You’ll understand 
all the big issues — from separation of church and state 
to impeachment to civil rights — that continue to affect 
Americans’ daily lives. 
•  Get started with Constitution basics — explore the main 
concepts and their origins, the different approaches to 
interpretation, and how the document has changed over the 
past 200+ years
•  Know who has the power — see how the public, the President, 
Congress, and the Supreme Court share in the ruling of America
•  Balance the branches of government — discover what it means 
to be Commander in Chief, the functions of the House and 
Senate, and how Supreme Court justices are appointed 
•  Break down the Bill of Rights — from freedom of religion to the 
prohibition of “cruel and unusual punishments,” understand 
what the first ten amendments mean 
•  Make sense of the modifications — see how amendments have 
reformed presidential elections, abolished slavery, given voting 
rights to women, and more
