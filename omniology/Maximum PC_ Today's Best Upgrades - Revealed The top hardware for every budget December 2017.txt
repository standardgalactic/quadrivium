Tuan 
Nguyen
I’ll never forget the joy I felt on the day 
I opened my first multimedia upgrade 
kit. In it was a soundcard, CD-ROM drive, 
and a pair of speakers. I was so excited—
mainly with the prospect of not having to 
continue listening to the clicks and beeps 
from my “PC speaker.” It was my first 
step into upgrading.
That was back in the early ’90s. 
These days, we have so much more to 
play with: SSDs, graphics cards, CPUs, 
RAM, keyboards…. If you’re just getting 
into the components game now, the list 
of things you can upgrade is endless. 
But what about stuff outside of the PC? 
Sure, you can keep throwing things inside 
the box to make it more powerful, but 
things outside can enhance your overall 
experience, too.
Recently, I’ve started to include my 
environment as being part of my entire 
computing experience. Whether that’s 
an electronically adjustable desk, voice-
activated LED room lighting, or creating 
a killer network setup, everything that 
surrounds you can be taken into account.
I’ve pretty much done everything I can 
to my room, save for installing automatic 
sliding doors. But as much as I’ve done, 
I still feel there’s always more to do. I 
can’t stop tinkering and building. When 
I moved into my current place, I gave 
myself a mandate: Go simple, clean, 
minimalistic. Turns out, I failed miserably 
with that. My room turned into a server 
room that rivals those from many small 
and medium-sized businesses. And 
guess what—I love it.
I’m 
actually 
in 
the 
process 
of 
considering a complete upgrade to 
my system. Although my specs aren’t 
horrible by any stretch, they are getting 
a little dated. I’m using a system based 
around a Core i7-4960X, with 32GB of 
DDR3 Samsung “green” RAM. I know—
these components can still cook, but 
there have been instances when I’ve run 
out of memory. Unfortunately, to solve 
my RAM dilemma, I’m going to have to 
gut the entire system.
First, the motherboard would come 
out. It’s an Asus X79 Rampage IV Black 
Edition, but it’s got strange quirks that 
annoy me, such as constantly not being 
able to enumerate the keyboard during 
POST. It’s served me well for years, but 
now it’s time to move things into the 
X299 realm. I haven’t decided what CPU 
I’m going to need, but I never felt that I 
was starving for CPU power. What I’m 
actually craving is simply more of the 
same experience.
There have been times when I’ve 
actually had some doubts. I thought I 
would outgrow my fancy for all the PC 
stuff, and just get myself a simple, ready-
to-go system instead. I’ve certainly had 
my fair share of frustrations and near-
endings, but like any great relationship, 
it’s only gotten better with time.
I’m still in love with you, PC.

Headphones and microphones 
are notable omissions.
Hardware 
requirements 
depend on the mode. MR 
can run in Regular and Ultra 
modes. The lower mode, using 
integrated graphics, isn’t to 
be recommended; the refresh 
rate drops to 60Hz, which can 
quickly lead to VR’s Achilles’ 
heel: nausea. Regular mode 
requires a Core i5-7200U or 
better processor with HT, and 
integrated HD 620 
graphics or better. 
Ultra 
mode 
needs a Core 
i5-4590 quad-
core CPU, and an 
Nvidia GeForce GTX 
960, AMD Radeon RX 
460, or better graphics—
fairly chunky, but not as 
demanding as rival virtual 
reality systems. 
What can you run on your new 
MR headset? Quite a bit: some 
top titles from the Microsoft 
Store, including Minecraft VR 
and Halo Recruit, as well as 
access to titles from SteamVR. 
These headsets have the weight 
of Microsoft Windows behind 
them, so expect support to be 
much more robust, and with 
strong exclusives titles.
VR has been the next big 
thing for so long that it’s easy 
to be cynical, but this is a huge 
step. When Microsoft integrates 
something 
into 
Windows, 
and starts spending serious 
development money, it’s time 
to take note. The Oculus Rift 
and HTC Vive have remained 
niche gaming gear. Microsoft’s 
MR headsets aim to break out 
of pure VR gaming into wider 
usage, such as productivity, 
entertainment, 
and 
social 
media. For example, Microsoft 
has a new VR social network 
called AltspaceVR, where your 
avatar can chat to others. 
MR headsets are unlikely to 
sell in big numbers initially, but 
prospects look good. Putting all 
the tracking on the headset is 
a system others would do well 
to copy. Software support is 
decent and will get better, and 
hardware requirements are OK. 
VR in Ultra mode is a match 
for the established systems, 
and the MR part adds a new 
dimension, with the potential 
for some innovative uses. If any 
VR-style system has a chance 
to become truly mainstream, 
this is it. Get the popcorn ready, 
and watch this space. –CL
“With WindoWs mixed reality, 
you can escape the everyday 
into a world of imagination.” 
According to Microsoft’s sales 
pitch, at least. Mixed reality is 
the headline act for the Window 
10 Fall Creators Update. The 
first five headsets have been 
unveiled, and will be ready to 
buy by the time you read this. 
Why use the term mixed 
reality instead of virtual reality? 
Because the headsets all have 
front-mounted cameras, which 
enable the blending of the real 
world with the virtual one. This 
enables some neat tricks. Your 
virtual world could include 
subtle boundary markers taken 
from the physical world, to stop 
you blundering into the scenery. 
At the other end of the scale, it 
can present a view of the real 
world, with added avatars and 
virtual elements, Pokémon Go 
style. The cameras also enable 
the tracking to be done entirely 
on the headset—no external 
tracking cameras are required, 
so any area is the play area.
The new headsets all follow a 
similar pattern, with variations 
in ergonomics and build quality. 
The prices are a little higher 
than we had hoped. There was 
talk of $299 headsets, which 
haven’t materialized yet. The 
Acer MR Headset and Dell Visor 
are $399, the Lenovo Explorer 
and HP MR Headset are $449, 
while 
Samsung’s 
Odyssey 
weighs in at $499. The first four 
The first batch of 
headsets is here, 
ready to add mixed 
reality to Win 10. 
VR has seen many 
false dawns, could 
this really be it?

Tech Triumphs and Tragedies
securiTy ouTfiT McAfee has released a study that examines the most 
dangerous search terms—those most likely to lead you to malicious sites that 
aim to steal personal data, install malware, or just bombard you with spurious 
pop-ups. The average risk rate is 1.7 percent (2 in 125 results are potentially 
risky), but it can reach over 25 percent if you search for particular things. 
Some terms are pretty obvious targets: “free music downloads,” “make 
money,” and “game cheats,” for example, or anything with the words “free” or 
“lyrics” in them bring out the hackers. Other dangerous terms are a little harder 
to fathom: “myspace” and “solitaire.” The worst search string? At a risk of 
16.1 percent, it is “word unscrambler.” Are puzzlers more trusting than most?
Diving deeper into the data and grouping together variations in terms brought 
out a clear winner: “screensavers.” Variations on this brought an average 34.4 
percent risk. Another area full of scammers is “working from home”—four 
times riskier than average. Be wary of searching for “Rihanna,” too. Some 
results are odd, though: “viagra” turns out to be relatively safe, at 0.1 percent. A 
bit of fun for most perhaps, but some of these numbers are alarmingly high. –cl

it had lost details on one billion accounts. However, in June, the struggling Yahoo was 
acquired by Verizon for $4.5 billion, and a new investigation, with the help of outside forensic 
experts, has shown that Yahoo lost details on all three billion of its accounts. 
Yahoo claims that stolen data did not include passwords in plain text (encrypted 
passwords were stolen then?), payment card, or bank account details. Cold comfort 
perhaps. What was taken included birth dates, email addresses, telephone numbers, and 
more. A treasure trove for identity theft. It was the worst cybersecurity failure in history by 
some margin, and it has taken four years to learn the full extent. The company is sending 
out emails to “additional affected user accounts.” That will be an awful lot of emails. –cl

google has an annual hardware event 
now, cementing its increasing involvement 
in selling physical gear. This year, it has 
updated what was already one of the best 
Android phones: The new Pixel 2 and the 
larger XL version (now with a 2880x1440 
six-inch screen) are not dramatic upgrades 
to look at, but have a raft of tweaks under 
the skin. Both have Edge Sense—squeeze 
the sides and it launches Google Assistant. 
You also get water resistance, a much-
requested improvement. The 3.5mm jack 
has gone, though there’s an adapter in the 
box. Camera optimization includes optical 
image stabilization and other trickery to 
offer what is claimed to be the best image 
quality on any smartphone. They also sport 
the latest Android OS. Prices start at $649, 
and they’re already said to be in short supply.
There are two new smart speakers, 
too. The little Google Home Mini, a $49 
pebble akin to the Echo Dot, and the $399 
Home Max, a Sonos rival, with decent 
audio and clever AI to work out volumes 
and playlists. Then there’s the Pixelbook, 
a sleek aluminum premium Chromebook 
with a 360-degree hinge. It integrates neatly 
with the Google family, including Play and 
Assistant. Undoubtedly funky, but it starts at 
$999, and reaches a hefty $1,649. 
More fun are the Pixel Buds, like Apple’s 
offering, but with Google Assistant built in, 
and linked to Google Translate. Not quite a 
Babel fish, but getting close. There’s also 
Google Clips, a small AI-controlled camera 
that takes images of what it thinks you 
want—odd at best, creepy at worst.
Google’s gear hasn’t reached Apple’s level 
of aspirational cool, but it is turning out some 
decent pieces of hardware. You’ll also notice

PC and gaming enthusiast  
for over 30 years.
Making a Mesh of Things
Modern CPUs are complex, and the task of routing 
data between various parts—cache, cores, memory, 
and I/O controllers—is a critical element of the CPU 
architecture. For several generations, Intel’s HEDT 
CPUs have used a ring bus architecture.
Think of it as mass transit for data, running in 
a loop, with stations where data can get on or off. 
As core counts increase, dual rings are added, with 
a buffered switch between them. If data needs to 
move between rings, it’s like getting off at a transfer 
station, and waiting for the next train—a five-cycle 
delay, on top of the delay from traversing the rings.
The Broadwell HCC (High Core Count) designs 
supported up to 24 cores, and while it’s possible 
to use additional rings for higher core counts, 
the increased latency limits scalability. With the 
Skylake-X HCC/XCC designs (6 to 28 cores), Intel 
is using a new mesh network. Each block (core, 
memory, I/O, cache, and so on) has a router, with the 
blocks in grids. It’s like city blocks, with the router 
switches at each intersection directing traffic. The 
goal is improved scalability through lower latency.
Despite all the talk of the mesh lowering latency, 
reducing power use, and improving scalability, in 
testing it’s not all sunshine and roses. Comparing 
the 10-core Broadwell-E i7-6950X to the 10-core 
Skylake-X i9-7900X, inter-core communication 
latencies have increased from 80ns to 100ns. The 
real-world impact is nowhere near that, though, and 
higher per-core performance does compensate.
More concerning in my testing of Skylake-X 
CPUs is that power draw has gone way up from 
Broadwell-E. At stock, power draw isn’t too bad, but 
all X299 motherboards I’ve tested auto-overclock. 
Intel rates the i9-7900X for all-core turbo of 4.0GHz, 
with a maximum turbo of 4.3GHz (or 4.5GHz via Turbo 
Boost 3.0 Max), but the base clock is only 3.3GHz.
That base clock is what the CPU is guaranteed 
to achieve without exceeding TDP, and it’s up to 
At the beAting heArt of your PC sits the CPU, crunching tasty bits of 
0s and 1s in byte-sized chunks. It does so at an extremely fast rate—
around four billion cycles per second—but each core can do up to six 
instructions per cycle, with Skylake-X CPUs containing up to 18 cores. 
That’s 100 billion operations per second (give or take). It’s enough to 
make a math teacher weep with joy.
the mobo firmware to keep things 
in check. If power use goes over 
TDP, clock speeds should drop, but 
boards are being more aggressive. 
Some run all cores on the i9-7900X 
at 4.0GHz, no matter what, and 
others default to 4.3GHz and even 
4.5GHz. Power use scales rapidly, 
but the real problems start to show 
up on the i9-7960X and i9-7980XE.
The TDP is 165W for both, and 
they went well over that. System 
power use in Cinebench R15 is 
around 350W, with 50-100W going to 
other components, so the CPUs use 
over 200W. Push clock speeds to 
4.0-4.4GHz on all cores, and it goes 
to over 500W. Overclocker der8auer 
took things to the next level with 
liquid nitrogen on the i9-6980XE, 
and got all 18 cores to 6.1GHz—
using over 1,000W just for the CPU.
These are amazingly fast CPUs, 
but we’re hitting the limits of 14nm. 
Mesh topology may pave the way 
for more cores, but even though it 
has two fewer cores, the i9-7960X 
is only 3-5 percent slower than the 
i9-7980XE. If Intel made a 24-core 
CPU, without 10nm it’s unlikely 
to deliver a significant boost in 
performance without an equivalent 
increase in power use. Moore’s Law 
is dead, right when we need it most.
Skylake-X uses a mesh topology to allow scaling to higher core counts.

It happened again: There’s been another breach of 
security that leaves the personal information and 
Social Security numbers of US citizens exposed. I’ve 
seen this once before with the Office of Personnel 
Management hack a couple years ago. This time, 
however, the scale of the breach dwarfs all others. I 
also noticed that the affected organization was using 
open-source software. What?
One thing open-source and Linux users like to 
say is that the OS and software is more secure than 
proprietary software. This is true for one big reason: 
A volunteer programmer is free to experiment and 
contribute any code in order to fix bugs or add new 
features. Any open-source code that is found to 
have a vulnerability can be fixed by anyone with 
the interest and skill to do so. Generally speaking, 
security holes are fixed as soon as they are found. 
When the SambaCry vulnerability was discovered, 
patches were available within a day or two.
There are downsides, though. Vulnerabilities (also 
called “vulns") can be reported in public mailing 
lists or bug trackers. While it’s great for developers 
to have easy access to the information they need 
to patch the code, it also makes the vuln public 
knowledge. Furthermore, patch notes often have 
details about what type of vulnerability the patch 
fixes. At that point, running unpatched software is 
like living in an old circular saw blade warehouse 
that’s been marked seismically unsafe in a city such 
as Tokyo or San Francisco. When 
something goes wrong, you can’t 
say someone didn’t warn you.
As for the Equifax hack, a vuln in 
Apache Struts (CVE-2017-5638) was 
posted by the National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST) 
on March 10. (The notice describes 
a vulnerability that would allow a 
remote attacker to upload a file and 
execute arbitrary code.) The Struts 
team released a patch that mitigated 
CVE-2017-5638 on March 7. Equifax 
issued a statement on September 
7 saying it detected an intrusion as 
early as May. I’ll let you do the math.
Besides a sudden interest in 
how credit freezes work, what you 
should take away from this as an 
end user is that updating software 
matters. After all, Equifax isn’t 
alone. There are countless blogs 
running old versions of WordPress 
or WordPress plugins that are 
compromised every day. There’s 
also a lot of angst about the Internet 
of Things: Many IoT devices don’t 
have an update mechanism for 
users to keep those devices patched. 
There’s a legitimate fear that a 
botnet of smart LED bulbs could 
bring down critical infrastructure.
Sure, we love to moan about 
Windows 10 updates, but they keep 
you safe. Likewise, running Linux 
without regular updates only offers 
a false sense of security. Running 
updates manually one per week is

For Goodness’ Sake, Apply 
Your System Updates
We (should) all knoW by noW that system updates are important. If you 
don’t keep your system updated, your data could be compromised. And 
that sucks for you. When an enterprise doesn’t run a system update, it 
can compromise millions of people’s data. That sucks for everybody.
a good habit to get into. And since 
running an update often only takes 
one or two console commands, 
it’s not exactly a burden. If you’re 
running programs compiled from 
source, be aware that your package 
manager 
won’t 
update 
those 
programs, and updates are your 
responsibility. If you’re running an 
Internet-facing web server or NAS 
at home, keeping your systems 
updated is even more crucial.
When 
you 
do 
find 
yourself 
updating your system, remember 
that any of the programs listed in 
the update, left unpatched, could be 
a potential weak point; it only takes 
one application to compromise 
a 
system. 
With 
the 
growing 
complexity of computer systems, 
there will always be security holes. 
But if you update your system 
regularly, you can plug those holes 
as soon as they become apparent.

Twitch was once the dominant force in streaming, but that’s not necessarily the case today—
like any large online entity worth its salt, it’s being chased by a host of competitors. While 
we could have considered the likes of hitbox.tv, gaminglive.tv, and their ilk, streaming only 
has a value if it has an audience, so we’ve bashed the big three against each other: Twitch, 
YouTube Live, and Microsoft’s Mixer, which is baked in to Windows 10, post Creators Update.
Best Sites for  
Game Streaming
Tools
Much of the streamer’s toolbox consists 
of third-party tools such as XSplit, OBS, 
or Gameshow. The former pair happily 
support all three services on test here, 
while Gameshow only supports Twitch 
and YouTube at this time. But preparing 
your stream is only one part of the DIY 
puzzle; working with it is quite another.
Twitch’s back end is well seasoned 
and, while sometimes complex, has 
been built with its huge community of 
users in mind. The Twitch Dashboard 
is super-handy to have open while 
you’re streaming, giving you an at-a-
glance overview of chat, your stream 
quality, and much more, and there are 
services in there to test the stability of 
your connection and how it relates to 
Twitch’s standards.
YouTube Live’s online controls are, 
like those of its standard service, a 
little haphazard. There’s plenty of fine 
operational control on offer, but some 
questionable design decisions mean its 
dashboard doesn’t easily fit everything 
above 
the 
fold 
in 
your 
browser, 
something of an oversight, considering 
your hands will likely be on the controls. 
And then there’s Mixer, which presently 
offers a rather simple interface. Good 
for beginners, but control is important.
Winner:  
Twitch
Quality
Your stream quality is going to depend 
hugely upon the stability and capacity 
of your broadband connection. Even 
faster pipes are often weighted heavily 
toward downloading rather than upload 
speed, so the broadcast quality you get 
out of any of these services is rather 
subjective. Streaming hosts generally 
ask you not to compensate for lagging 
with a variable bitrate stream, because 
this causes massive problems for some 
viewers, and higher bitrates mean that 
most viewers are forced to switch to a 
lower-quality transcoded stream.
If you happen to be able to fling 
packets at the Internet with limitless 
abandon, your selection of streaming 
service will, as ours does, come down to 
the maximum bitrate supported. Twitch 
offers a soft limit, so you can send 
whatever bitrate you like, but it would 
prefer you to keep your stream under 
3,500kb/s, and it warns streamers who 
exceed this mark. YouTube Live, which 
transcodes every stream sent to it, can 
accept just about anything, but higher 
bitrates are squashed by its compression 
algorithm. Microsoft’s Mixer supports 
a maximum of 10,000kb/s without 
moaning, by which point your router will 
be on fire anyway. 
Winner:
Mixer
Audience
If eyes on your content is your concern, 
you’d be wise to question whether 
Mixer is the right platform for you with 
its present userbase. Microsoft hasn’t 
announced any concrete numbers for 
the fledgling service, which had only 
been around for six months before 
Redmond snatched it up, but even its top 
channels don’t exceed more than a few 
hundred viewers.
You’d imagine that YouTube, the most 
popular video service in the world, would 
mean big numbers for streams, but 
that’s still not necessarily true. Users 
with an existing name and reputation 
can attract a hefty viewership, it’s true, 
but YouTube’s live offering is still finding 
its feet, and realistically you’ll need to 
attract subscribers before anyone will 
stumble on your live output.
Twitch’s growth has slowed due 
to 
increasing 
competition, 
but 
it 
certainly 
hasn’t 
reversed. 
Its 
top 
streams (admittedly, these are large 
esports events) have broken a million 
concurrent viewers, and even the top 
solo streamers have been able to attract 
a quarter of a million eyes. It’s also a 
lot easier to discover new streamers 
on Twitch, and its users will habitually 
search by game—a handy driver.
Winner:  
Twitch

Extra Tech
One streaming service is much like 
the other, right? Not so. Stream delay 
can be a benefit if you’re a big player, 
and Twitch’s revised stream delay is 
perfectly acceptable. Users at partner 
level can go the other way, and add up 
to 15 minutes of lag to their streams 
to prevent games of PlayerUnknown’s 
Battlegrounds becoming a festival of 
honking horns and incessant trolling. 
YouTube does offer latency options, 
although nothing so extreme, and its 
ultra-low setting can lead to some fairly 
ropey output. If you really want to go 
near-instant, Mixer’s FTL streaming 
can take advantage of higher bitrates 
for 
direct 
streaming 
to 
viewers 
with virtually no lag—perfect for an 
interactive stream.
We should also point out integrations 
at this point. If you’re not concerned 
about presentation, or plastering your 
webcam and a bunch of other stuff on top 
of your stream, Mixer’s integration with 
the Windows Game Bar (and, indeed, 
with the Xbox One) make it a great 
choice for fire-and-forget streaming 
to a bunch of your buds. While Twitch 
also has its claws in the major consoles, 
there’s nothing more simple on the PC 
than Mixer.
Winner:  
Mixer
Monetary Gain
When—sorry, if—your profile blows up, 
there’s a lot to gain from streaming. A 
lucky few are even able to ditch the day 
job and play games for a living. This 
funding could come through private 
donations, via Patreon, or it might be by 
taking advantage of one of the services’ 
partner programs.
Twitch leads the way here. Hit one 
milestone—50 followers and proof of 
regular streaming—and your viewers 
can subscribe to your channel, chipping 
in a little each month (shared with 
Twitch) to receive additional benefits. 
Cement your status, and you can 
become a Twitch partner, which offers a 
host of extra goodies, such as control of 
(and a slice of the profits from) mid-roll 
ads. Twitch viewers can also earn Bits, 
a local currency with which they can tip 
their favorite streamers. 
Mixer’s 
subscription 
program 
is 
relatively young and, given its current 
viewership, 
not 
yet 
particularly 
profitable, although you can apply 
to jump to Mixer if you’re already 
established elsewhere. YouTube Live 
offers Super Chat, where viewers can 
pay to highlight their messages, as well 
as a share of ad revenue, and in some 
cases, sponsorship opportunities.
Winner:  
Twitch
We’ve 
surprised 
ourselves 
here. 
Mixer’s win on two key criteria is, 
frankly, not the result we were 
expecting, coming in to this head-to-
head, and it’s a bit of a skewed result, 
given the importance of the audience 
metric. In truth, we’d never actively 
lean toward Mixer if we were looking 
to create a growth stream. YouTube 
Live’s relative lack of success is also 
something of a shock, although as it 
continues to grow, and its discovery 
features (and its viewers’ tendency to 
use them) expand, it’ll surely become 
more of a viable option: There’s no 
stopping the machine.
In all, though, Twitch is far and away 
the platform to choose for beginners 
and experts alike. It is the home of 
gaming streams. Some of its policies 
seem archaic and restrictive, but if you 
can work within its guidelines, and 
present a quality product, Twitch gives 
you every opportunity to take your 
livestreaming to the next level, and 
perhaps even earn a little spending 
money to boot. Ask us in a couple of 
years, though, and the answer could 
well be different.... 
And the
Winner Is…
ROUND 4
ROUND 5
Twitch, borne of Justin.tv and now part of 
Amazon, is the home of big-numbers streams.
Microsoft Mixer’s Channel One aids in the 
discovery of streams.

Storage Limits
Hi Doc, I have a Plex media 
server on a Windows 10 
system, using storage spaces 
for the media files. I was using 
five 4TB hard drives in RAID 
with parity, but decided to 
upgrade the drives one at a 
time, so purchased a new 8TB 
disk, removed one of the older, 
smaller HDDs, and installed 
the larger repository.
When I went to increase 
the size of the storage spaces, 
I received an error saying 
they could not be extended, 
because the number of 
clusters would exceed the 
maximum supported by the 
filesystem. Apparently, I 
defaulted to a 4KB cluster 
size, and now my storage 
spaces are gimped to 16TB. Is 
there any way to increase the 
cluster size without wiping 
everything and reformatting 
each disk? 
–Jon Preu
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: What 
you’re running up against 
is a limitation of Microsoft’s 
proprietary New Technology 
File System, which keeps 
volumes constrained to 2^32-1 
clusters. Multiplying that out 
by a 4KB cluster size gives you 
your 16TB ceiling. Jumping to, 
say, 64KB clusters (the largest 
allowed by NTFS) increases 
the maximum to 256TB, 
yielding plenty of headroom for 
expansion in the future.
This means the smallest 
unit of disk space allocation 
grows to 16x the existing 4KB 
clusters, so available capacity 
is utilized less efficiently. For 
instance, a 65KB file would 
normally span 17 4KB clusters, 
wasting 3KB on the last one. 
The same file eats up 128KB 
across two 64KB clusters, 
63KB of which goes unused. On 
a server hosting lots of little 
files, big clusters are more of 
an issue. Fortunately, media 
servers typically host large 
files, minimizing the impact of 
this inefficiency.
The Doc has mentioned 
MiniTool’s Partition Wizard 
before; the free version is very 
useful as a supplement to 
Microsoft’s Disk Management 
console. Upgrading to the 
Professional version for $39 
unlocks a feature to change 
cluster sizes without data loss. 
Acronis Disk Director offers 
similar functionality for $50. If 
you’re already running backups 
(and verifying them), there’s 
always the option to wipe the 
previous volume and re-format 
with larger clusters before 
restoring your media files.
Sudden Shutdowns
Dear Doctor, I have an Asus 
Transformer Book T100TAM 
running Windows 10 that has 
a 500GB hard drive. It shuts 
off automatically after being 
on for 29 minutes and 39 
seconds. It does this whether 
I plug into an AC socket or run 
on battery power. I checked 
all the Windows power 
settings I am aware of, and 
found nothing that might be 
triggering shutdowns. I read 
a number of online forums as 
well, and noticed others with a 
similar problem. To determine 
whether my issue is caused by 
hardware or software, I even 
tried booting into Linux from a 
USB thumb drive (which didn’t 
work). This doesn’t appear 
to be a problem caused by 
high temperatures, because 
there is no fan to begin with. 
Please help! 
–Calvin
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: The 
30-minute shutdown issue 
pops up intermittently across 
the web, and doesn’t seem 
limited to one specific PC 
make or model. What most 
of the threads with solutions 
have in common, though, is 
motherboard work—most 
suggesting a replacement.
Boot up your Transformer 
Book, enter the BIOS, and let 
it sit. If it shuts down right 
when you’d expect, Windows 
isn’t the culprit. Make sure 
you’re running the latest 
firmware (build 400, released 
on 5/19/2016), even if it doesn’t 
sound like updates fix this issue 
for most people reporting it.

Microsoft Office Issues
Doc, I have a long-standing 
issue with Microsoft Office 
2010 32-bit (on a system 
running Win 10 Pro 64-bit). I've 
exhausted every avenue for 
getting help from Microsoft, 
including its nightmare of a 
public support forum.
When I double-click any 
Office file, I get a message 
that the software is installing 
Microsoft Office Single Image 
instead of just opening the 
corresponding program. But 
if I open Word, say, through 
a shortcut I make to the app, 
the message doesn’t appear. I 
need help understanding the 
difference between double-
clicking a file and opening the 
same file with Word, or any 
other Office app, already open. 
Office 2010 is currently the 
only software on this machine, 
although I’ve installed and 
uninstalled previous versions 
along the way as I upgraded.
 
–Ken St. John
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: For 
some reason, Office files are 
pointing to the binary OEMs 
used for deploying the various 
versions of Office 2010. And as 
you’ve experienced, searching 
for answers can be an exercise 
in frustration with such a large 
and complex suite of apps.
Providing you have the 
means to re-install your copy 
of Office, it may be best to 
completely uninstall it and start 
afresh. Check out https://goo.
gl/NY4Kdm for instructions to 
manually eradicate every bit of 
the suite from your system.
Understanding GPUs
Doc, I’m trying understand 
how memory bandwidth on 
GPUs works by comparing the 
Zotac GeForce GTX 1080 Ti 
AMP Extreme and MSI Radeon 
RX Vega 64. Correct me if I 
am wrong, but the GTX 1080 Ti 
offers bandwidth of 1Gb/s per 
pin, while the Vega 64 boasts 
2Gb/s per pin (Pascal versus 
HBM2). Respectively, they 
include 11GB of GDDR5 and 
8GB of HBM2.
What does the difference 
in memory bandwidth per 
pin mean for performance? 
Is there a use for the higher 
bandwidth that would allow 
AMD’s card to outperform 
the 1080 Ti? Is the difference 
irrelevant when we consider 
that the Zotac board only costs 
$100 more? 
–Kevin G
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: 
Memory bandwidth is a function 
of memory technology, clock 
rate, and bus width. Although 
HBM employs very wide busses, 
it also operates at much lower 
frequencies than GDDR5X. So, 
in the case of GeForce GTX 1080 
Ti versus Radeon RX Vega 64, 
you’re looking at dissimilar 
architectures.
On the GTX 1080 Ti, Nvidia 
enables 11 of the GP102 
processor’s 12 available 32-bit 
memory controllers, yielding 
an aggregate 352-bit bus. 
Each controller hosts 1GB of 
GDDR5X operating at 11Gb/s. 
Take 352 bits, divide by eight 
to turn the number into bytes, 
then multiply by the memory’s 
transfer rate: you get 484GB/s 
of peak bandwidth.
On the Vega 64, AMD uses 
two stacks of HBM2, facilitating 
a 2,048-bit bus. Each stack adds 
4GB, which is how the card gets 
its 8GB total. Compared to the 
GTX 1080 Ti’s 11Gb/s GDDR5X, 
though, Vega 64’s HBM2 runs 
at 1.89Gb/s. When you plug 
those numbers into the same 
equation, AMD’s theoretical 
bandwidth matches Nvidia.
As we’ve already seen in 
the benchmarks, the Radeon 
RX Vega 64 performs more 
like the GeForce GTX 1080 
than the higher-end 1080 Ti, 
so gaming performance in this 
case isn’t defined by a memory 
bandwidth bottleneck, but by 
other architectural trade-offs 
that AMD made to give Vega 
workstation/compute appeal.
Electronic Snail Mail
Hi Doc, do you know any 
services that allow you to 
send snail mail printouts 
from the web, similar to 
those postcard-from-photo 
services? I know there is 
FlyDoc from Esker.com, but it 
requires a minimum $100 fee 
upfront. –Tatyana Shmeleva
THE DOC RESPONDS: If you’re 
looking for a low-volume 
alternative to FlyDoc, check out 
LetterStream, Docsaway, and 
Mail A Letter. Between them, 
sending a basic one-page, one-
sided letter starts under $1, and 
quickly gets more expensive 
if you need tracking, Certified 
Mail, or Registered Mail to other 
countries. Options abound for 
double-sided printing, return 
envelopes, postcards, and even 
check/payment printing.
Ripping CDs in 2017
Hi Doc, I am a long-time 
reader of Maximum PC, and 
I’d like to follow up on a couple 
of questions about ripping 
audio CDs that were asked in 
previous issues.
In the “Ultimate Guide 
to Digital Media” from May 
2011, you mention that if 
you want to ensure ripped 
CDs are 100 percent error-
free, use AccurateRip, Exact 
Audio Copy, or dBpoweramp 
Reference. Does the Doc still 
think that those represent the 
best way to rip a collection of 
over 200 newly acquired CDs?
From “Rip Archival-Quality 
MP3s from Audio CDs” back 
in the Holiday 2009 issue, you 
mention Lame and EAC. Again, 
are they still the best for 
archival-quality MP3s?
Lastly, if a hacker gained 
access to a machine protected 
by BitLocker, wouldn’t the 
system’s information be 
useless because it was 
encrypted? –Marvin Malasky
THE DOCTOR RESPONDS: The 
recommendations you cite are 
still good today, Marvin. Exact 
Audio Copy is regarded as 
perhaps the best free CD ripper, 
while dBpoweramp is top-shelf 
as far as paid software goes 
(a single-PC license sells for 
$39). Both take advantage 
of AccurateRip’s technology 
for verifying the perfection 
of ripped tracks against an 
online database.
If your BitLocker-enabled 
PC is compromised by a hacker, 
its contents are not protected 
while Windows is running. The 
feature safeguards against 
offline attacks. In the event that 
your hard drive is removed and 
attached to another machine 
for the purpose of reading its 
data, 128/256-bit encryption 
makes the disk unreadable. 
But if someone sneaks off with 
your notebook or connects to 
your desktop over a network, 
BitLocker won’t help. Strong 
passwords, strict permissions, 
and some common sense are 
your best defenses against 
unauthorized guests.

Bring your system bang up to date 
with some choice hardware picks
By MaxiMuM PC staff
Upgrading is fUndamental to the 
PC. It’s one of the cornerstones of our 
platform of choice, and it’s why the 
PC has survived while other systems 
have failed. It’s also the reason why 
you can focus on the hardware that 
matters the most, and spend your 
money appropriately. You can upgrade 
in stages—if you want to focus on a 
performance CPU first, with a mind to 
upgrading your graphics card or storage 
later, you can. As long as you know 
what’s happening in the tech world, 
you’re in good shape.
On that note, we’ve just had an 
incredible year for processors. AMD 
has come out swinging with its Ryzen 
line, with increased core counts and 
strong raw performance. And Intel 
has just responded with its eighth-
generation CPU line—we’ve managed to 
squeeze the first chips to arrive into our 
recommendations, too. Which means 
we’re now looking at two completely 
new mainstream platforms that didn’t 
exist a year ago. Plenty of opportunities 
for upgrades, in other words.
Bear in mind that any new piece of 
gear should have a legitimate upgrade 
path as well. Getting the best processor 
for your motherboard is fine, but it takes 
the shine off it a bit if you know there’s 
a whole new platform doing the rounds. 
That’s why our recommendations all 
relate to the latest hardware lines. 
This shouldn’t stop you upgrading older 
hardware as far as it can go, though, 
because that can often be a cost-effective 
route—especially if you’re happy to take 
the risk of buying used hardware (great 
for older processor deals, and making 
the move to SLI).
Over the page, we look at the best 
hardware upgrades you can buy right 
now, with performance benchmarks 
where they matter. We cover all the 
major components, and highlight things 
to watch out for when upgrading. It’s a 
great time to give your machine a new 
lease of life, as you’re about to find out.

There is an argumenT for 
going with Intel’s Core i9-
7980XE for your high-end 
upgrade: It’s an absolute 
beast, with its 18 cores and 36 
threads. It does cost $2,000, 
though. For the vast majority 
of us, such a move makes no 
sense. If you want high-end 
performance that will leave 
your bank balance vaguely 
intact, Threadripper is the 
way to go. And at $999, the 
16-core 1950X is the best that 
AMD has on offer. Yup—half 
the price for two fewer cores 
(four threads).
The AMD Ryzen 
Threadripper 1950X is an 
incredible slice of silicon, 
effectively squeezing a pair 
of Ryzen 1800Xs into one 
package. There are big wins 
in addition to the phenomenal 
core count, too, including 64 
PCIe lanes, support for quad-
channel DDR4, and 40MB of 
L3 cache. This is a serious 
chip that will relish high-end, 
multithreaded applications. It 
happily turbos up to 4GHz, and 
stays cool while doing so; 60 C 
puts Intel’s latest to shame. 
The resultant chip 
is physically huge, so 
AMD has introduced a 
whole new package and 
mounting mechanism—
it’s an interesting system 
that helps ensure you 
don’t damage your new 
motherboard or expensive 
CPU when installing it. 
Speaking of which, you 
will, of course, need a new 
motherboard to go along with 
your top-end chip, and we 
cover our recommendation 
for X399 on page 34. 
aT lasT, we’ve seen it come to 
fruition. intel has finally thrown 
off the shackles of those four-
core limitations, and added an 
additional two cores to the vast 
majority of chips in its arsenal 
of mainstream processors. it 
is, in essence, an effective way 
of combatting amD’s ryzen 
eight-core parts, without 
having to redevelop an entire 
architecture to do so.
The Core i5-8400 is the 
absolute sweet spot in the 
lineup, and for those looking 
for a mid-range, no fuss chip, 
that gets the job done, it’s the 
new king of the hill. although it 
still lacks the hyper-Threading 
of its Core i7 superior, the 
inclusion of those two Coffee 
lake cores on top of the usual 
four provides a raft of additional 
processing prowess, capable 
of demolishing the older Core 
i7-7700K. it is, by far, the best 
value processor you can buy 
to date, coming in at a faintly 
ridiculous $190.
That’s not to say there 
aren’t any limitations with 
Coffee lake, the big one being

temperature. intel is still 
refusing to invest in any form 
of decent thermal interface 
material between the die and 
the ihs, and because of that, 
temperatures are toasty, even 
on this locked Core i5. Plus, 
although the socket may be 
the same, there’s no backward 
compatibility at all, meaning 
you’ll be investing in a new 
motherboard as well.

as an uPgraDe, a budget 
chip is a tricky concept. We’ve 
been recommending the 
Intel Pentium G4600 for our 
budget build for the best part 
of a year, but when it comes 
to an upgrade, we can’t really 
recommend a last-gen CPU 
that slots into a last-gen 
motherboard. So instead of 
tying ourselves in knots trying 
to predict which platform 
you’re upgrading from, we’ve 
picked a chip that offers strong 
performance at a great price 
point. The Ryzen 3 1300X may 
not have the headline-grabbing 
thread count of the top-of-the-
range 1800X, but this is still an

Talking of cost, you’ll need 
to buy an AM4 motherboard 
to use it, and possibly some 
DDR4 memory to go with it, if 
your current system is a little 
long in the tooth. So that $130 
price tag isn’t the whole story,

proposition, with a decent 
upgrade path of its own, which 
is always worth considering 
at the budget end of the 
scale. The retail chip comes 
with the Wraith cooler as well, 
which does a fine job of keeping 
it cool while hitting the 3.7GHz 
turbo, so no immediate need to 
grab a separate all-in-one to 
get the most from this chip.

Oh, hOw mid-range has 
changed over the last few 
years. Once upon a time, 
the card to have for anyone 
wanting a fairly healthy PC 
was the GTX 660 Ti. It was 
cost-effective, powerful for 
its day, and clocked like a 
champ. However, as the battle 
lines widen, and GPU prices 
extend ever upward, our idea 
of what a mid-range card 
actually includes has inevitably 
increased, too. 
It isn’t all bad, however, 
because central processing 
prowess becomes ever more 
affordable—offsetting the 
GPU price with a cheap CPU 
balances the books, while 
providing higher frame per 
second solutions for the same 
amount of green.
The GTX 1070 is a prime 
example of this. With 
performance matching the 
height of Maxwell’s frame-
rendering capabilities, it’s a 
card that makes the once-
premium 9 series Titan 
X affordable, cutting the 
graPhiCs CarDs are in a bit 
of an odd state right now. For 
the last 18 months, nvidia has 
been left unchallenged, with 
amD only providing any hint of 
competition in the mid-range. 
The rX 500 refresh was little 
more than a badge swap, and 
vega a dud—a disappointing 
high-end solution, overhyped 
to its own detriment (although 
it struts its stuff nicely when 
it comes to cryptocurrency 
mining, annoyingly).

price by 66 percent. MSI’s 
Gaming X variant provides 
an exceptionally fine balance 
between noise reduction

There’s no superfluous RGB 
lighting here, and the only 
hint of any “gaming” heritage 
lies in the small red accents

that with a powerful stack of

a high-end gPu? how do you 
power a 4K gaming rig in today’s 
market? well, fortunately, 
nvidia hasn’t been resting on 
its laurels, and is still focused 
on trying to capture as much 
of that market share as it can. 
at the start of this year, it 
dropped the bombshell that is 
the geForce gTX 1080 Ti, and 
hasn’t really looked back.
Think of it as a cut-down

focused solely on gaming, 
but coming in at a far more 
attractive price point. The 
differences are slim, with its 
1gB of gDDr5X being one of the 
few things cut from the titanic 
juggernaut. The Titan Xp is ever 
so slightly more powerful—
about 15 percent or so—but it 
also costs $500 more, making 
it a superfluous product aimed

iF Cash is tight, there’s 
nothing wrong with using 
the cooler that comes with 
your CPu (as long as it’s the 
retail version—Oems don’t 
have coolers). however, if 
you want to overclock, or 
keep temperatures down 
so your machine runs more 
quietly, water cooling gets 
the nod from us. Obviously, 
piecing together your own 
loop is the pro choice here, 
although for an easier life, 
an all-in-one cooler has a lot 
going for it. we’ve seen quite 
a few of these recently as 
new manufacturers enter the 
market, but the likes of the 
Corsair h110 ($124) and nZXT

out as the ones to buy.

iF yOu’re gOing with the 
mighty powerhouse of 
Threadripper, you need a 
suitable motherboard. We 
admit, there’s not a huge 
selection of X399 boards out 
there right now (seven in 
total), so pickings are slim, 
but that’s not to say there’s 
no choice to be had. In our 
opinion, Asus’s Prime X399 is 
ideal. For this number of cores, 
unless you have very specific 
needs (overclocking, more 
PCIe SSDs, specific storage 
solutions, and so on), there’s 
very little to justify investing in 
a pricier motherboard.
Asus’s Prime X399 was 
the board we chose for our 
recent workstation rendering 
machine, because of these very 
reasons. We wanted to keep 
an eye on the price, yet still 
have access to a fantastically 
smooth BIOS for additional 
tweaking, overclocking, and 
more if we needed it. Throw 
in the gorgeously understated 
color scheme and design of the 
board, plus cooling and storage 
support, and it’s an all-around 
no-brainer.
That said, one of the biggest 
reasons we chose this board 
is due to market share. Why? 
Simply put, Asus has loads 
of money and resources to 
invest in BIOS development, 
pushing the boundaries 
of memory support in the 
process—and good memory 
support is still key to unlocking 
the real potential of AMD’s 
potent processor. Stability is 
also an important factor, and 
you can max both of those 
factors out using this powerful 
motherboard. Throw in the 
strong feature set and raw 
power on offer, and this is an 
easy recommendation to make.

iT isn’T a great time to upgrade 
memory right now. not because 
there’s no benefit in giving your 
Os and apps more room, but 
because pricing is currently 
horrible. memory pricing has 
almost doubled in the last 12 
months, so while we’d love 
to recommend that everyone 
aims for at least 16gB in their 
systems, it’s a tough call to 
make when even a budget kit 
will set you back nearly $150.
aim for 8gB as an absolute 
minimum for most normal 
use, although 32gB is nice for 
serious work. if you’ve got room 
to double up on what you’ve 
already got, do so, because 
hopefully pricing will calm 
down by the time you upgrade 
again. when it comes to what to 
buy, aim for capacity first and 
frequency after. low latency 
kits are the way to go if you can 
afford them, although given 
the current inflated pricing, 
being picky will cost you. 
as an example, you can pick 
up DDr4 kits rated at up to 
4,600mT/s (PC4 36800 with 19-
23-23-43 timings), although you 
will pay a lot for the privilege 
($430-plus for 16gB). 
it’s worth noting that ryzen 
benefits from faster memory, 
because its infinity fabric 
operates at the speed of the 
memory, but be mindful of 
compatibility—check your 
mobo’s supported memory list 
for capacity and speed first.

we haven’T haD chance 
to play with a lot of Z370 
motherboards yet (we have 
some seriously juicy ones 
coming up next issue), because 
as this issue goes to press, 
Coffee Lake will have only just 
dropped. That said, it’s hard 
to argue with the Asus ROG 
Maximus Hero’s heritage. 
We’ve been using this lineup 
of motherboards in our test 
benches since Devil’s Canyon 
and Z97.
The Asus ROG Maximus X 
Hero is a fantastic update to the 
series, featuring an integrated 
rear I/O cover, oodles of USB 
ports, BIOS reset switches, 
Ethernet ports, integrated 
Wi-Fi, dependable audio, a ton 
of onboard storage support, 
M.2 heatsinks, and more. One 
of the things we’ve already 
touched upon with our love for 
Asus is just how easy it is to 
use the UEFI BIOS. It may be 
difficult to quantifiably review 
a BIOS, because those familiar 
with one manufacturer’s BIOS 
will almost always know how 
best to take advantage of that 
compared to another, and it’s 
often personal preference that 
dictates the issue; however, 
the placement of menus, along 
with the options and items you 
can tweak in Asus’s BIOS make 
it one of the more intuitive and 
easy-to-use that we’ve seen in 
the last few years.
This board is a touch on the 
pricey side, but if you’re looking 
to shell out on a high-end 
Coffee Lake processor, it’s well 
worth the investment.
Ryzen at this point—
however, if you’re after a 
no-fuss, plug-and-play build, 
the AB350 is where it’s at. This 
board isn’t for tweakers—you 
won’t be able to overclock 
on it—but it does provide you 
with everything you’ll need 
to support multi GPUs, PCIe 
storage, USB 3.1, and more. 
It even supports memory 
up to 3,200MT/s as well, 
meaning you can net yourself 
a 10–15 percent increase in 
performance in some cases, 
just by turning on the AMD

that’s not strictly true, but it’s 
a good sound bite, and there 
are some transfers where you 
can notice the difference. Not 
every system has access to 
M.2, though, and even those 
that do tend to be limited to 
one or maybe two slots. M.2 
drives also demand a slight 
premium over 2.5-inch SSDs. 
That means there is still a 
market for the more traditional 
SSD, and such drives are still 
the go-to upgrade for anyone

Samsung 960 Evo 
$150-$465  www.samsung.com   
samsung is the go-to company 
for high-end ssDs, but it’s also 
our recommendation for the 
mid-range. The 960 evo mixes 
a lot of the same magic as the 
960 Pro, but at a lower price. 
The big difference is the type 
of nanD used: The 960 Pro 
uses mlC (multi-level Cell) 
flash, while the evo uses TlC 
(Triple-level Cell). They’re both 
3D nanD architectures, but the 
Pro manages to squeeze more 
into the same space, which 
is why it’s available in larger 
capacities—512gB–2TB, while 
the evo ships at 250gB–1TB.
Performance-wise, there 
is a difference between the 
Pro and evo, but it isn’t huge—
sustained reads and writes 
of 3,200mB/s and 1,800mB/s 
aren’t too far off the Pro. in fact, 
there are benchmarks that can 
see the evo ahead of the Pro. it’s 
worth noting that the 960 Pro 
does have a five-year warranty 
(or 800TB written), while the 
960 evo only has a three-year 
warranty (or 400TB written).
Samsung 960 Pro 
$295–$1,265  www.samsung.com   
nO-Brainer Time: If you want 
the fastest storage around, 
you’ll want an SSD. Not just 
any SSD either—you’ll want a 
PCIe M.2 drive that is capable 
of producing the kind of 
transfer rates that make grown 
system admins weep. And at 
the top of that pile of drives 
at the moment is Samsung, 
with its 960 Pro range of 
M.2 drives, where you’ll see 
sustained transfer reads 
and writes of 3,400MB/s and 
2,100MB/s respectively. The 
random 4K performance is no 
slouch either, hitting 57MB/s 
and 194MB/s when throwing 
around smaller files.
You’ll notice that we haven’t 
specified a capacity with our 
recommendation, and that’s 
because we suggest getting the 
biggest drive you can afford, 
without getting silly; $295 will 
net you a fairly sizeable 512GB 
model, which is more than 
enough for your OS and your 
main applications. Jumping up 
to a 1TB drive means you can 
hold a good chunk of your data 
on the drive as well, with the 
pricey 2TB model allowing for 
serious data usage.

reCOmmenDing a display is 
tricky because there are so 
many subjective variables. 
what may be perfect for 
one may not work for you. 
gamers, for instance, want 
to prioritize the high refresh 
rates and low latency of a 
Tn panel over iPs’s color 
accuracy and viewing angles, 
while video editors may 
prefer the higher contrast 
ratios of va panels. 
most of us want the best 
of all worlds—which tends 
to mean iPs panels, although 
newer tech is blurring these 
lines. add in screen sizes, 
native resolutions, Freesync/
g-sync, high dynamic ranges 
(hDr), and more, and it’s 
clear that recommending a 
screen is difficult. we’re still 
searching for the “perfect” 
panel at a price we’re 
comfortable with—the asus 
Pa329Q is great, but at $1,250, 
it’s not for everyone.
Cases are ineviTaBly a 
very personal thing for many 
people. After all, a big factor is 
aesthetics. Whether you care 
can dictate how much you’re 
willing to spend. Looking for a 
super-slick, clean build? Then 
it’s likely you’re hunting for a 
svelte, aluminum, tempered 
glass solution. Couldn’t give a 
damn? A square tin can sans 
window will do the job just fine.
That said, if you’re building a 
premium system, you can’t go 
wrong with a premium chassis. 
Ease of building, materials, 
paint finish, and internal cable 
routing options all contribute to 
a happier enthusiast. 
For us, all this is epitomized 
by Phanteks—the Dutch 
company has a knack 
for making the premium 
affordable, and nowhere

options with its Define series, 
Fractal provides a plethora of 
more exotic styled, cooling-

into the heady realms of custom 
PC perfection, all without

The meshify is a perfect 
example: a small, stylish,

with maximum airflow in mind. 
The polygon-esque 3D diamond

to up to 360mm radiators, and 
although liquid cooling isn’t 
the best solution, it’s perfect

nothing’s more satisfying 
than upgrading that old hunk of

collecting dust, because their owners didn’t 
have a plan. And it’s time to change that. 
So, dust off that unloved hardware, 
put visions of the slightly underwhelming 
Raspbian desktop experience behind you, 
and stop worrying about the dark depths 
of Linux. Achieving everything we’re going 
to show you here is plausible for just about

and every one of these potential projects 
will put your Pi to work around your home.

Every one of these ideas is the start of a new

Whatever you decide to do with it, we 
do have a key recommendation: Ensure 
you’re supplying power to your Raspberry

If you don’t feed it the 2.5 amps it desires, 
you’re likely to get severely degraded

Run Pre-Packaged Applications
Nard a little too complex for you? How about trying out Docker, and using its 
containers to install full-featured web apps on your Pi with no configuration? You 
can’t run too many concurrently on the Pi, because each individual container’s VM 
snatches some of its limited system resources away, but something such as ResinOS 
(www.resinos.io) or HypriotOS is the perfect way to throw up a quick file server, 
database, or web stack as and when you need it. The fine folks at Hypriot have even 
built a number of useful, shaved-down, Pi-compatible containers for tons of tasks, 
which you can find at https://hub.docker.com/u/hypriot. www.hypriot.com
Set Up a PBX 
a 
pBx—or 
switchBoard—is 
a 
great thing to play with. While you 
can hook up a physical phone line 
to your Pi via hardware, it’s more 
practical to route a SIP-linked 
number (from the likes of Skype) 
or a Google Voice account, which 
translates PSTN to VoIP for you. 
Asterisk, a seasoned PBX, can 
route calls through your home, 
deal with conference calls, and 
more—and the inclusion of the 
FreePBX web front end makes its 
dedicated distro more fathomable 
than setting it up from scratch. 
http://raspberry-asterisk.org
Host a Website
There’s a sTandard stack of packages 
used to run a basic website: Linux, the 
Apache webserver, MySQL to handle 
the database side of things, and PHP to 
interact with that database. Setting up a 
LAMP stack isn’t difficult—you can do it 
with  sudo apt-get install lamp-server  on 
Raspbian—but with one on your Pi, you 
can forego the cost of server hosting, and 
take full control over what you install and 
what you put online. Redirect web traffic 
to an open port on your home network 
with a service such as Dyndns.org, and 
you’re set, though the Pi can only handle 
minimal traffic. http://apache.org
Build a BitTorrent Box 
GraB yourself some storage—an 
external hard drive, large USB stick, 
or similar—and hook it up to your Pi, 
because it’s time to fill it with Linux 
ISOs and historical artifacts from 
http://archive.org. Using a Pi as an 
always-available 
torrent 
client 
makes sense; the protocol is based 
on sharing and availability, but 
leaving your main PC ramping up 
your electricity bill isn’t the right way 
to go about hosting that data. Run 
Raspbian, 
install 
torrent 
client 
Transmission with  sudo apt-get 
install transmission-daemon , then 
immediately stop it with  sudo service 
transmission-daemon stop , so that 
we can edit its configuration file. Run  
 
sudo 
nano 
/etc/transmission-
daemon/settings.json  to do so.
Find the line that says “rpc-
whitelist,” and add a comma after 
“127.0.0.1” 
followed 
by—if 
your 
network hands out IP addresses in this 
range—“192.168.1.*” and tweak that 
address range if required. Then head 
to 
“rpc-authentication-required,” 
and change its value from “true” to 
“false.” Exit Nano with Ctrl-X then Y, 
and run  sudo service transmission-
daemon  start  to set Transmission 
running again. You should now be 
able to log in to Transmission’s web 
interface from any machine on your 
network, by pointing a browser at, for 
example, 192.168.1.2:9091, switching 
the IP address for that of your Pi.
The RaspbeRRy pi is a great device to 
tuck away on a network. It’s silent, it draws 
little power, and it can add the same 
functionality to your home setup as many 
rack-mounted appliances do to large 
businesses. don’t expect enormous 
throughput or the capability to handle 
massive amounts of traffic, but the Pi is the 
perfect companion for a home network.

Another Raspberry Distribution—is, as its name suggests, not 
actually a distro at all. It’s a development kit for embedded 
systems. Install it on an SD card, and your Pi will boot the entire 
OS into RAM, leaving you free to remove the SD without 
damaging the system. You then get a truly headless box to work 
with as you wish, logging in through a web interface, adding 
packages via an SD card, or—if it’s misbehaving—communicating 
through its USB null modem connection. You’re then free to 
build whatever system you require from its wide selection of 
lightweight apps, or by making use of the Debian compatibility 
layer. http://arbetsmyra.dyndns.org/nard/

Pen-Test Your Devices
how vulNeraBle is your network and the machines on it? Penetration testing 
distros such as Kali Linux aim to give you all the tools you need to hammer your own 
hardware. And we do mean your hardware, because this entails turning your Pi into 
a toolkit that could cause chaos when plugged into any other network. Like taking a 
crowbar to a windshield, it’s liable to land you in jail if that windshield doesn’t belong 
to you. Kali is a mature pen-testing distro, with over 600 tools for everything from 
vulnerability exploration to wireless attacking and digital forensics. www.kali.org
Create a VPN Server
hostiNG your owN Virtual Private Network 
solves two key problems when you’re away 
from the sanctuary of your home setup: It 
grants you access to your files and devices as 
though you were there, and it encrypts your 
traffic, obfuscating it from anyone who might 
be listening in on whatever seedy public Wi-Fi 
network you’ve managed to connect to. Leaving 
a home-based Pi running the OpenVPN server 
(you’ll find it in your chosen distro’s package 
manager) should do the trick, although RSA key 
configuration and the amount of IP table 
fiddling that’s required mean this isn’t the most 
trivial task. http://openvpn.net
Route Your 
Network Traffic 
let’s Be BluNt: a Pi isn’t the best 
choice of hardware for a router; its 
Ethernet port sits on its single USB 
2.0 bus, bottlenecking its data 
allocation between all devices, so 
you’re likely to top out at 50Mb/s 
throughput. That said, a lot of 
routers aren’t the best choice for 
a router, as they’re filled with dumb 
software that wouldn’t know a 
packet from a hole in the ground. 
OpenWRT is replacement router 
firmware that gives you pinpoint 
control; if your hardware doesn’t 
support it, switch into modem mode, 
and send traffic through OpenWRT 
running on a Pi. www.openwrt.org
Protect Your Network
the wiNdows firewall is a formidable 
foe, but it’s useless at protecting 
anything other than the machine it’s 
on. So, your phone, tablet, and IoT 
fridge are all vulnerable. Unless you 
put something in the way, and don’t 
mind sacrificing even more data than 
you would with OpenWRT. Using a USB 
Ethernet dongle, you’ll be down to 
25Mb/s per port. Forgive a little 
sluggishness, though, and a Raspbian-
equipped Pi running Gufw is all you 
need to fend off an uncomfortable 
number of packet sniffers. Adding 
Pixelserv 
(http://proxytunnel.source 
forge.net/pixelserv.php) also blocks 
ads network-wide. www.gufw.org
Build a File Server 
if you’re leaviNG a Raspberry Pi 
running at all times, it might as well 
make itself useful. Setting up a Samba 
share means you (and other users of 
your network) can store files on it, and 
because Samba incurs little system 
overhead, it’s realistic to install it on 
a machine that’s otherwise dedicated 
to a different task. Open a terminal, 
and type  sudo apt-get install samba 
samba-common-bin  to install it.
Next,  sudo mkdir -m 1777 /share  
creates a shared directory in the 
root of your SD card, gives everyone 
permission to read and write to it, and 
uses the sticky bit (the “1” in “1777”) 
to stop it being deleted. Run  sudo 
nano /etc/samba/smb.conf  and add 
the following to the config file:
 [share]
 Comment = Shared folder
 Path = /share
 Browseable = yes
 writeable = yes
 only guest = no
 create mask = 0777
 directory mask = 0777
 Public = yes
 Guest ok = yes
Set up a password for your share 
with  sudo smbpasswd -a pi , restart 
Samba with  sudo /etc/init.d/samba 
restart , and you’re all set to go. On a 
Windows machine, you should see a 
machine called “Raspberrypi” in the 
“Network” section of Explorer—open 
it, and you’ll find your shared folder.

Network Audio Player
easily eNhaNced with aN add-oN DAC—the Allo 
Boss ($59) gives a massive sound and attaches to the 
Pi’s GPIO pins—a Pi makes an ideal network audio 
player. There’s a couple of ready-to-rock distros that 
aid in setting up support for the likes of Spotify, DNLA 
audio, web radio stations, and all the formats you 
could want. Our pick, Volumio, bills itself as “the open 
audiophile audio player,” enabling you to fire off tunes 
using its comprehensive web interface on your phone 
or PC, and even offering its own hardware, including 
amps that do away with the need for anything beyond 
a pair of passive speakers. https://volumio.org
Plex Player
yes, we literally just talked about Plex, but 
there’s good reason to separate out the tasks 
of using your Pi as a server and as a player: 
It’s far, far better at the latter. A Raspberry 
Pi 3 can easily handle 1080p video at 60fps, 
which is adequate for all but the most eagle-
eyed 4K-fancying viewers. Install a distro such 
as RasPlex, and you’ll be all but ready to go. 
Just connect to your TV, log in to your server, 
and you’ll be playing back media in no time. All 
you need is a way to control it, and you’ll find a 
few options above in the “Remote-Controlling 
the Raspberry Pi” box. http://rasplex.com
Plex Server 
the more we cut the cord, the more we 
need other options for our TV viewing 
pleasure. If you’ve already amassed a 
large media library, Plex is a top choice: 
It’s super-slick, fills up your library with 
cover images, theme songs, and episode 
information automatically, and requires 
very little in the way of technical 
knowledge to set up. It even streams 
online to your mobile devices. There’s a 
catch, though: Running a Plex server on 
a Pi isn’t really feasible if you want to 
enjoy your media in anything other than 
its 
stored 
resolution 
and 
format, 
because even the Raspberry Pi 3 doesn’t 
have 
the 
required 
muscle 
for 
transcoding video. http://plex.tv
Remote-Control  
the Raspberry Pi 
it’s fairly easy to attach wireless 
peripherals to the Raspberry Pi, and 
most should work without special 
drivers. Just plug in the USB portion 
and go, or use  sudo apt-get install 
bluetooth bluez blueman  to install 
Bluetooth management tools on the 
Raspbian GUI, then connect your 
devices from “Menu > Preferences 
> Bluetooth Manager.” There’s a 
command-line Bluetooth interface, 
which can be a bit more reliable, 
but it’s tricky to get started with. If 
you’re setting up your Pi to use as a 
living room media box, a combined 
mini keyboard and trackpad, such as 
the second-generation backlit Aerb 
(available for $17) is a great choice.
What if you want to get a bit more 
granular 
and 
old-school—not 
to 
mention technophobe-friendly—with 
your 
remote 
controlling? 
MSL 
Digital’s RemotePi Board (http://
msldigital.com) sits on top of a few of 
your Pi’s GPIO pins, and is fully 
configurable to accept commands 
from whatever IR remote you point at 
it. MSL paints the RemotePi primarily 
as a power control board, fixing the 
key problem with the Pi’s design, and 
letting you gracefully switch your 
media box on and off with a remote.

Master Minecraft
there’s a versioN of miNecraft for the Pi (https://minecraft.net/en-us/edition/pi/), 
which is free, and a great way to get stuck into a bit of programing if you decide to 
wade into the code and hack it. You can also jam the full version of Minecraft on to 
a Pi 3 (www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=186547), though it’s a little 
experimental. Your Pi may be better put to use as a Minecraft server; there’s enough 
power to host a few concurrent players of the full version, and while it’s a little slow 
to generate new chunks, it’s adequate. For better performance (with fewer features), 
try Cuberite, a multi-platform server designed to be lightweight. http://cuberite.org
Bring Back DOS
traNslatiNG x86 instructions to the 
RISC structure of an ARM chip takes a 
lot of processing power. It is possible 
to use virtual machine environment 
QEMU (http://qemu.org) to emulate a 
486-class PC on a Pi, and you can even 
run a treacle-slow Win 98 install on 
top. But that’s ridiculous. Instead, try 
the ARM port of DOSBox, so you can 
resurrect the classics without having 
to dredge up a machine that’ll deafen 
you and double your electricity bill. Just 
run  sudo apt-get install dosbox  from 
the Raspbian package manager. To get 
really authentic, dig out that old box of 
floppies, and use a USB floppy drive to 
read them. http://dosbox.com
Play Arcade Games 
the raspBerry pi’s arm architecture 
might not lend itself to some of the 
applications that x86 machines handle 
with aplomb, but it’s absolutely 
perfect for emulation. So, let’s take a 
trip through the old school by running 
classic arcade games on the miniature 
marvel. While it’s not been updated 
for a while, we place PiPlay (formerly 
PiMame) at the top of the list for 
running the collection of legal MAME 
ROMs available from http://mamedev.
org/roms, and only those ROMs. We 
couldn’t possibly say how well it runs 
any other ROMs. http://piplay.org
Keep Up with Kodi
Kodi is a BiG Name in the streaming 
world, and not necessarily for the 
right reasons. Forget piracy, though: 
Kodi 
(once 
called 
XBMC, 
and 
spawned from a project that turned 
the original Xbox into a media center) 
really ought to be known for how 
easy it makes getting a media box up 
and running. It’s supported by just 
about every Raspberry Pi distro. On 
Raspbian, you can install it using the 
following pair of commands in a 
terminal window:
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install kodi
If that sounds too much like hard 
work, there is, like most of the 
projects we’ve talked about, a single-
serving option to get a working Kodi 
installation running from scratch. In 
fact, there are several for you to 
choose 
from. 
OpenELEC 
(http://
openelec.tv), the slightly more open 
source LibreELEC (http://libreelec.
tv), OSMC (http://osmc.tv), and Xbian 
(http://xbian.org) all include Kodi 
pre-installed and configured, and are 
perfect if you’re dedicating a Pi to the 
TV task; Kodi runs as both media 
server and player, so make sure you 
have some storage available for your 
content. You can also install Kodi to 
run through RetroPie, which is an 
immensely useful option.
Emulate Classic Consoles
aNyoNe with half aN eye on the Raspberry Pi 
has probably heard of this one already, but we 
think it bears repeating: RetroPie is a simply 
incredible package of pre-configured, super-
accurate console emulators, with a gorgeous 
front end supplied by EmulationStation. Most 
are built on top of the Libretro engine, which 
ties a number of different systems into a single 
package, meaning that you can make global 
changes to settings, which are automatically 
reflected across all platforms. Grab a USB 
adapter for your favorite set of console 
controllers—or just plug in a wired Xbox pad—
and you’ll be away. http://retropie.org.uk

Monitor the Weather
WITh onlY $88-worth of parts—including 
the Pi at its heart—you can construct a 
weather station that monitors humidity 
and temperature, then logs it to a web 
interface. It’s a great way to learn a bit 
of Python, pick up the basics of 
interacting with sensors, and create a 
project that you could extend later on. 
It’s not as full-featured as the weather 
station the Raspberry Pi team gave 
out to schools (http://raspberrypi.org/
education/weather-station), 
however 
Raspberry 
Weather’s 
tutorial 
is 
a 
valuable resource that’ll get you going 
fast. http://raspberryweather.com
Your Own Project 
the pi is desiGNed as an educational, 
experimental board. You can use it to 
follow; there are plenty of projects 
where others have done the hard 
work for you. Or you could use it to 
lead; make something new. Turn that 
invention in your head into reality. 
If this appeals, there’s a pair of add-
on boards that appeal to the tinkerer. 
The first is the Sense HAT ($40, 
www.adafruit.com), a combination of 
sensors (gyroscope, magnetometer, 
accelerometer, et al) along with a 
joystick, and an LED matrix display. 
This is the board that made it to the 
International Space Station as part of 
the Astro Pi project, and includes a 
Python library to allow you to access 
everything the board has to offer.
The other, which has been making 
waves more recently, is the MATRIX 
Creator ($100, http://creator.matrix.
one). Designed to facilitate quick 
hardware prototyping, it includes 
libraries in multiple programing 
languages, an eight-point MEMS 
mic array, a programmable FPGA, a 
bunch of 3D sensors, and a waterfall 
of connectivity options to interface it 
with whatever hardware you like.
Security Made Easy
oNe of the first hardware add-ons 
for the Raspberry Pi was a camera. 
Indeed, there’s even a special header on 
the board for such a device, so you can 
hook it up without blocking any of your GPIO 
pins. The second-generation sensor, available in both 
regular or infrared flavors for $25, can take 8MP snaps or stream 
1080p video at 30fps, and is supported by plenty of software within 
the Raspbian ecosystem. Add in a bunch of IoT motion detectors and 
door switches, and you can (with a little effort) build your own home 
security system that you can monitor from your smartphone. The 
PrivateEyePi project has everything you need to get started.

Upgrade Your Car
with a douBle diN-sized touchscreeN, a Pi, and possibly some in-car Wi-fi, you 
have all you need for an in-car upgrade. Will you use Navit (www.navit-project.org) to 
add a module, and set up your own GPS? Will you entertain passengers with an in-car 
media center? Perhaps you want to use your Pi to monitor your engine via your car’s 
OBD-II port using a $20 Bluetooth module? The possibilities are myriad. The guys at 
iCarus can furnish you with everything from the software (which runs on Raspbian), 
to individual components, to entire pre-assembled units. www.i-carus.com
Create a Voice Assistant
who Needs the amazoN echo? People who can’t do 
things for themselves. With a Raspberry Pi, a suitable 
microphone, an external speaker, and a certain level of 
patience, you can create your very own voice assistant 
that uses precisely the same voice service that Amazon 
uses on the Echo, meaning you have access to all the 
skills and enhancements that go along with it, and it 
starts automatically when you power up your Pi. You 
need to register a free Amazon developer account in 
order to gain access to the API—and, if we’re honest, 
the combined cost of hardware is greater than the 
price of an Echo Dot, but don’t let a silly thing like that 
put you off. http://github.com/alexa-pi 
Build a Robot 
scratch is the pi’s key learner 
language. You can build complex 
programs by dragging and dropping 
elements of code, and filling in the 
odd variable here and there. But 
don’t take that to mean it’s simplistic. 
You can also use Scratch (or Python, 
or C) with a hardware control board, 
such as the Laika Explorer ($47), to 
interface with motors, servos, and 
sensors, turning your Pi into a full-
featured robot. Laika’s programing 
library is packed with all the 
functions you need to prototype a 
’bot, so all you need to worry about 
is supplying the power. If you plan to 
give 
your 
creation 
wheels, 
we 
recommend an external battery 
pack. http://project-laika.com
Build an  
Arcade  
Machine
if your emulatioN interests have been 
piqued by PiPlay or RetroPie, Pimoroni’s 
Picade HAT may be for you. Jam it on 
top of your Pi’s GPIO pins, and you gain 
a 3W DAC for audio, power routing 
through its USB port, and screw 
terminals, enabling you to attach real 
arcade controls. It comes on its own 
($15.75), with buttons and a joystick 
($120), or as a mini cabinet with monitor 
($240). Try spending a little more and 
securing authentic Sanwa or Seimitsu 
parts from www.focusattack.com to 
build your own. www.adafruit.com
Build a Cluster 
earlier, we meNtioNed the possibility 
of installing Docker containers on 
the Raspberry Pi. While they’re 
excellent at getting preconfigured 
applications running, there’s another 
aspect of Docker that suits the Pi’s 
low cost and low energy footprint 
very well: Swarm mode. In essence, 
it’s a simple way of setting up cluster 
computing, which combines multiple 
physical machines with networking 
to create a single logical machine. 
Hook up two Raspberry Pi 3 units as 
processing nodes, for example, and 
you’ll have eight ARM cores and 2GB 
RAM at your disposal. Scale it up, and 
you’ll outpace the processing power 
of the original Cray supercomputers 
with only a small investment.
Normally, this isn’t at all easy, as 
anyone whose high school computer 
lab had them set up a Beowulf 
cluster of tired Pentium 2 machines 
will attest. Thankfully, the software 
wizards at Hypriot have developed 
the Cluster Lab, a super-simple 
way to set up a Docker Swarm with 
several Raspberry Pi units. Check 
out the instructions at http://github.
com/hypriot/cluster-lab. In essence, 
you simply need to flash a specific 
OS image to each node, tell them 
they’re part of a swarm, and they’ll 
find each other, and work together 
automatically. Now it’s just a question 
of what to do with your cluster...

Discover the tips and techniques you 
need to boost your PC’s performance 
and lengthen its life. By Nick Peers
D
oes your PC struggle to keep up with the demands 
you place upon it? Do you think that it might be time to 
bite the bullet and buy a new one? If your PC is under 
five years old, there’s a good chance you can extend its life 
without having to incur the cost of a total replacement. In this 
guide, we’ll show you all the tips and tricks you need to speed 
up your PC—and many of the techniques we reveal won’t cost 
you a dime.
There’s the inevitable clean-up of course—most speed 
problems can be traced to the increasing load on your 
computer over time, so we’ll start things off by stripping 
things back there. This is often compounded by the fact that 
Windows Updates can be less than optimal at cleaning up 
after themselves, so tossing out the junk, and getting rid of 
things you don’t need can often have a significant effect on 
the overall speed of your machine. After that, we’ll help you 
examine the time it takes your system to start up—not only 
will our tips and tricks eliminate boot-time bottlenecks, but 
you’ll also free up more system resources, and give your 
computer a new lease of life. Honestly, even if your machine 
feels fine to you right now, speeding up your Windows 
boot can have a serious effect on your perception of how 
responsive it is (or isn’t). 
We’ll then look into some clever system tweaks that can 
free up your machine even further, helping to improve its 
responsiveness and performance when heavier demands 
are placed upon it. And if there’s a particular job you need to 
perform at the fastest possible performance, we’ll show you 
how to strip everything else back. 
Follow our guide to its end, and you’ll wonder why you ever 
thought about replacing your PC, as it frees itself from its 
shackles, and really starts to fly.

tep one to speeding up your PC is 
giving it a clear-out. If your last spring 
clean wasn’t long ago, you might be 
tempted to skip this, but you’ll be surprised 
by how quickly detritus can accumulate, so 
these tips are still worth following.
First, we need to ensure there’s sufficient 
free space on your system drive—aim to 
leave at least 5GB (preferably much more) 
spare. Open File Explorer, right-click your 
drive, and choose “Properties.” Click “Disk 
Clean-up,” wait for the scan, then click 
“Clean up system files” to find more files 
to clear out. You may need to scroll through 
and check further items to clean up; select 
each one to read more about it, as some—
such as ESD files—are best left in place.
If you want to push things further—or 
you’re still lacking free space—follow 
the “Clear Out Using CCleaner” boxout 
opposite. You can download and install 
CCleaner from www.piriform.com.
Clear Out Unused Apps 
It doesn’t matter how diligent you are, 
at some point you’ll start to accumulate 
redundant programs on your PC, each one 
demanding its share of space and system 
resources. You can manage these from 
the Programs and Features Control Panel 
(Windows 7 or 8.1), “Settings > Search 
and apps > App sizes” (Windows 8.1—
Store apps only), and “Settings > Apps” 
(Windows 10—desktop and Store apps).
That’s all well and good, but programs 
leave bits of themselves behind—leftover 
Third-party clean-up tools—such as CCleaner—include 
Registry cleaning tools, with the promise of streamlining and 
speeding up Windows. These tools scan areas of the Registry 
for supposedly redundant entries, offering to delete them. 
Hundreds or even thousands of entries get removed at a time, 
but even if your tool doesn’t accidentally delete an important 
Registry entry (and it will, sooner or later), Registry cleaning 
offers no benefit to performance whatsoever.
You can potentially improve performance—but not by 
much—by defragging the Registry files (known as “hives”) 
using a dedicated tool, such as Registry Defrag Free (www.
registry-clean.net/free-registry-defrag.htm). It analyzes 
the Registry and tells you whether significant “bloating” has 
taken place; if it has (over 10 percent), you can take a Restore 
Point, then let the program compress and defrag the files.
If you’re running Windows on an SSD, however, there’s 
little benefit in defragging the files. In most cases, you’ll also 
find that Windows has done a reasonable job of keeping the 
hives in good order, making the process redundant.
RegistRy cleaning
Before you start targeting specific areas of your 
computer, begin with a much-needed clear-out of

plan to reinstall the app again, these can 
be safely deleted with the help of a third-
party program, such as Revo Uninstaller

“Downloads,” followed by “Free Portable”). 
Note that Revo Uninstaller only works 
with desktop programs. You can clear out 
both desktop programs and Windows Store

“Windows” and “Applications” tabs in 
the “Cleaner” section, reviewing each

Pay particular attention to the “Windows

what you’ve selected, click the “Analyze” 
button, and wait for the scan.
2. review carefully
When complete, a summarized list is 
displayed. Be sure to right-click any 
questionable items and choose “View

individual files from being deleted by 
right-clicking them and choosing “Add to

see the “Registry Cleaning” boxout on the 
opposite page.
While you’re going through your installed 
apps—particularly if you’re running a low-
powered 
machine—consider 
ditching 
any resource-hungry programs for their 
lightweight equivalents. Microsoft Office, 
for instance, too much for your tablet or 
low-end laptop? Remove it and then install 
WPS 
Office 
2016 
(www.kingsoftstore.
com) or LibreOffice (www.libreoffice.org) 
instead. Also, try switching to portable 
apps, where possible, to prevent clutter 
from accumulating on your PC’s main 
storage drive—save these to a separate 
partition or drive instead, and they’ll also 
survive Windows reinstallation, with all 
your settings intact, too. 
Finish Your Clean-Up
Most of our lives are spent on the Internet, 
so if your web browser is starting to creak 
at the seams, consider taking steps to give 
it a clean-up and refresh. First, perform 
an audit of all the browser add-ons you’ve 
installed—the procedure for reviewing 
what’s installed varies from browser 
to browser: Chrome users should type 
“chrome://extensions/” into the Address 
Bar, for example, while Firefox users can 
use “about:addons.”
Disable or remove any add-ons or 
extensions that you no longer need—if you 
have a lot of items and multiple browsers 
to process, you’ll find that both CCleaner 
(“Tools > Browser Plugins”) and IObit 
Uninstaller (“Toolbars & Plugins”) make 
it easy to manage everything from one 
convenient spot.
Another area to focus on is fonts. If you 
have a lot of fonts installed on a low-memory 
PC, they affect performance. Manage them 
using AMP Font Viewer (www.ampsoft.net/
utilities/FontViewer.php), which makes it 
possible to uninstall those you don’t use 
regularly, loading individual or groups of 
fonts back into memory for temporary use 
when the need arises.
There’s one major area we’ve yet to 
look at, and that’s the start-up process. 
Turn the page for a complete guide to both 
monitoring the boot process and optimizing 
it to speed up how quickly your PC starts up. 
We’ll also explain how to optimize system 
resources further.

O
ver time, you’ll notice how much 
longer it takes Windows to start up. 
Optimizing your startup times isn’t 
simply about getting your PC to boot faster, 
though—it also has a beneficial effect on 
your 
machine’s 
general 
performance. 
That’s because, as you install programs 
on your computer, some of them configure 
themselves to load at startup. The process 
of loading these startup apps naturally 
lengthens boot times, but the apps also 
consume additional resources, producing 
a 
drag 
on 
your 
computer’s 
overall 
performance, too.
Some startup processes—your security 
software for one—are essential, and 
shouldn’t be touched. Others, such as your 
cloud sync app, are best left running, too, 
but you’ll find many apps and programs 
aren’t used often enough to justify allowing 
them to gobble up resources in the way 
that they do. The trick is identifying and 
disabling them.
Monitor Boot Times
Startup programs aren’t the only things 
that slow down Windows’ boot time. The 
step-by-step guide below shows you how to 
monitor your boot time and manage startup 
programs using the free BootRacer app. 
You’ll see that it divides the boot process 
into four stages. The first is pre-boot, and 
this covers the time it takes your computer 
to initialize its hardware and run various 
checks before handing over control to 
Windows. The figure should be three to five 
seconds on a PC with Fast Boot enabled—
see the “Fast Boot” boxout above-right for 
more details. 
If it doesn’t appear to be enabled, type 
“power” into the Search box and click 
“Choose a power plan.” Click “Choose 
what the power buttons do.” If “Turn on 
fast startup (recommended)” isn’t checked, 
click “Change settings that are currently

Download bootracer_freeb.zip from 
www.greatis.com/bootracer and extract 
the MSI file inside. Double-click this 
to install the program. Click “Finish” 
when complete. The main window 
opens automatically—click “Boot Time 
Test,” then “Yes” to restart your PC and 
perform the first boot test.
2. teSt and review
Windows restarts as normal with 
one difference: When the desktop 
appears, you’ll see a countdown timer 
appear in the bottom-right corner. 
When complete, a stopwatch showing 
your boot time is displayed. When the 
summary screen appears, click “Know

3. detailed analySiS
BootRacer splits the results into four 
parts—see the main text above for a 
detailed explanation of each. BootRacer 
performs the same test each time you 
restart Windows, so restart again to repeat 
the test at least once to get more results to 
compare. Click “History” to see the trend 
over time.

4. take control
BootRacer can be used to monitor (and 
control) individual startup programs 
and processes. Click “Startup Control,” 
then click the button next to “Disabled” 
to enable it. Click “Next,” leave the 
“Enabled” box checked to measure 
program start times, and click “Restart 
your PC and Analyze Results.”
5. Monitor appS
Now, when Windows reboots, startup 
apps are paused until the desktop has 
finished loading, then each one is timed. 
Keep an eye out for programs that take 
much longer than others to complete 
loading—click “Which programs slow 
down startup?” to analyze the results in 
greater detail.
6. Manage Startup
Click “Startup Control,” and you can 
disable (clear the check) or even delete 
startup items like other apps, such as 
CCleaner. Click “Set Order,” and you can 
even change the order in which startup 
programs are run, ensuring important 
apps launch before others. Click “Finish 
Reordering” when you’re done. 
When you switch on a Windows 7 
machine, it always starts from 
a “cold boot,” which has to load 
Windows from scratch. With the 
advent of modern PC hardware 
and the launch of Windows 8.1 
(and now Windows 10), supported 
PCs can be instructed to switch 
on Fast Boot instead. This uses 
“hybrid 
shutdown,” 
a 
feature 
that effectively hibernates your 
PC, rather than shutting it down 
completely, by storing the contents 
of memory in a special file,  
called hiberfil.sys. When starting 
back up, the file is loaded back into 
memory—a much quicker process 
than starting Windows completely 
from scratch.

changes.” Should you need to access the 
UEFI settings going forward, go to “Settings 
> Update and recovery.” Click “Restart 
now” under “Advanced startup,” then select 
“Troubleshoot > Advanced Options > UEFI 
Firmware Settings.”
Speed Up Windows Boot
The Windows Boot section refers to the time 
your PC takes to get to the login screen. This 
is determined by your version of Windows 
as well as the speed of your drive—under 
10 seconds on a fast SSD, for example—and 
the drive’s condition. 
If the time has got noticeably longer 
(minutes rather than seconds), check the 
condition of the drive. To do that, open a 
Command Prompt window with admin 
privileges—Windows 8.1 and 10 users can 
choose “Command Prompt (admin)” after 
pressing Win-X—then type the following, 
and hit Enter:
 chkdsk c: /f /r /x 
You need to reboot to run Disk Check. Be 
patient—it may take some time to complete, 
and appear to be stuck at certain points. If 
errors are found and fixed, you should find 
that Windows now boots more quickly.
If you’re running Windows 7 on a non-
SSD drive, click “Start > All Programs 
> Accessories > System Tools > 
Disk Defragmenter” to analyze and—if 
necessary—defragment the drive. Again, 
if defragmentation is required, you should 
find performance improves.

ou’ve cleaned up your PC, but 
there’s still lots of room for 
improvement. If it’s still struggling 
on a day-to-day basis—particularly if it has 
2GB of RAM or less—it’s worth exploring 
additional ways to free up more resources 
by optimizing which services (low-level 
processes) are running in the background.
Doing this by hand is tricky and time-
consuming, which is where Easy Services 
Optimizer 
(www.sordum.org/?p=8637) 
comes in. This makes it easy to disable 
a range of services safely to recover the 
resources you need. Once downloaded, you 
can quickly tweak your system one of four 
ways: Default (your existing setup); Safe 
(a good choice for most); Tweaked; and 
Extreme. The higher up you go, the more 
likely it is you’ll lose functionality, such as 
support for printers or Bluetooth devices. If 
an option doesn’t work, roll back to Default. 
If you’d rather temporarily suspend 
resources while running a specific app—a 
game, say—try JetBoost (www.bluesprig.
com/jetboost.html) instead. Once installed, 
launch the program, and click the big blue 
button to shut down services. Run your app, 
then after closing it, click “Restore” to put 
things back the way they were. 
Advanced users can click “Customize” to 
add custom processes, services (typically 
non-Windows services, but avoid key ones 
such as security software), and “other,” 
which includes ensuring your power 
settings are set to high performance.
Tune Up Search 
If you’re not averse to keeping documents 
and other files outside your key user folders, 
If your PC occasionally—or even frequently—finds itself 
grinding to a halt before mysteriously coming back to 
life again, it’s likely that a rogue process or program is 
attempting to claim more system resources than are 
available. Again, it’s a problem that affects older and 
slower machines, and the solution lies in a program called 
Process Lasso (https://bitsum.com).
This app runs in the background and offers several 
performance benefits, the key one of which is ProBalance. 
This keeps an eye out for those processes attempting to 
grind your system to a halt. When Process Lasso spots 
one, it immediately reduces that process’s priority level, 
to prevent it from stealing too many system resources, so 
keeps your PC running smoothly as a result.
Be sure to download either the 32-bit or 64-bit version, 
according to your system type—older and low-memory 
PCs tend to be running 32-bit Windows, but confirm this 
by pressing Win-Pause/Break. The free version of Process 
Lasso is all you need, and because everything is done 
automatically, you can leave this handy tool to its own 
devices once installed.

If you have two internal drives, spread virtual memory across them to boost performance.
chances are Windows takes a long time to 
find them when you perform a search—if 
they’re found at all. Let Windows add these 
locations to its index, and future searches 
will be much quicker. Open File Explorer 
in Windows 8.1 or Windows 10, and click 
inside the “Search” box to open the context-
sensitive “Search” tab on the Ribbon. Click 
“Advanced options,” and choose “Change 
indexed locations.” Windows 7 users should 
type “indexing” into the “Start” menu’s 
search box, and click “Indexing Options.”
From here, click “Modify” to add the 
folders containing your files to the index—
also consider removing those locations 
you don’t need indexed, to keep things 
streamlined. Once done, Windows takes 
some time to index the new locations fully—
this is much quicker on SSDs, obviously.
If you’ve partitioned your drive, move 
your search index off your Windows system 
drive, and you’ll be able to easily restore 
it after reinstalling Windows in the future. 
To do this, click “Advanced,” followed by 
“Select New” under “Index location,” to 
choose another drive or partition to put it.
Optimize Memory Settings
The following tweaks aren’t necessary 
if your PC is packed with RAM or you’re 
running an SSD, but they help PCs with 
2GB or less running 32-bit Windows on a 
regular hard drive. You need a USB 2.0 or 
better flash drive with 4GB of free space, 
enabling you to use the spare capacity on 
larger drives for other purposes. Windows 
should be able to automatically detect when 
you’ve plugged it in, and offer to use all or 
If your web browser is groaning under the weight of all 
those open tabs, you might be able to improve performance 
without having to close them all. If you’re a Firefox user 
with lots of RAM, open “Settings > General,” and uncheck 
“Use recommended performance settings.” Then, if it’s not 
grayed out, up the “Content process limit” to four or even 
higher, to see whether it helps.
Next, there are a few browser-related efficiency tips 
you can try to speed things up generally. First, enable your 
browser’s Bookmarks bar, giving you one-click access 
to your favorite websites. Also, right-click frequently 
used tabs, and look for a “Pin Tab” option, to make them 
permanently available.
Speed up logging into websites—and make them more 
secure at the same time—using either the LastPass (www.
lastpass.com) or KeePass (www.keepass.info) password 
managers. Finally, make better use of search engine 
timesavers—Google users can perform quick conversions 
direct from the search bar (“$5 to CAD”), and search a 
specific website’s content by prefixing the search terms 
with “site:pcgamer.com,” for example.

some of it for ReadyBoost. If not, open File 
Explorer, right-click the USB drive, and 
choose “Properties > ReadyBoost tab.” 
The second tweak requires that your PC 
has two internal hard drives—both non-
SSD. It enables you to move your paging 
file—which Windows uses for virtual 
memory—to the second drive, which can 
also give overall performance a boost. Press 
Win-Pause/Break, click “Advanced system 
settings,” switch to the “Performance” 
tab, and click “Settings.” Switch to the 
“Advanced” tab, and click “Change.”
Uncheck “Automatically manage paging 
file size for all drives,” then select your 
current Windows drive (usually drive C). 
Choose “Custom,” and enter “800” into both 
the “Initial” and “Maximum Size” boxes, 
before clicking “Set.” This 800MB file is 
required to enable Windows to boot. Now 
select your second drive (or—if it’s been 
partitioned—the least-used partition on 
that drive), and choose “System managed 
size.” Click “Set” again, then click “OK” 
three times, and reboot. Once done, return 
to this screen to verify the correct settings 
are in place (800MB for drive C; and 
“System managed” for your second drive). 
This should lead to improvements in your 
PC’s performance.

Making intel 
Better
I’ve spent a good while trying AMD’s 
Ryzen architecture at home, and 
although it’s a fantastic little chip, the 
overclocking experience is incredibly 
limited, and it hasn’t quite satisfied my 
progressive power itch.
Recently, Intel loaned us two Core 
i9-7900Xs, and I’m tempted to take 
one of those for a personal upgrade. 
The thing is, X299 has issues involving 
overclocking, too. The first is to do 
with the VRMs (voltage regulation 
modules) throttling the processor 
once they hit 107 C. That’s a fairly easy 
fix—the answer is to invest in a liquid-
cooled monoblock that cools both the 
processor and the VRMs.
Far more terrifying to solve is the 
fact that Intel refuses to solder the 
IHS (heat spreader) on to the CPU die, 
instead using cheap thermal paste to 
transfer heat from the die to the IHS. 
The solution would be to delid the CPU, 
a risky process that typically requires 
you to use a razor blade to separate 
the IHS from the CPU and PCB. So, we 
got in touch with Der8auer, the world 
famous overclocker, to see whether 
he could loan us one of his Delid Die 
Mate Xs. It’s a neat little device, that 
removes the IHS safely. It’s then up to 
us to clean off the glue, apply liquid 
metal thermal paste between the CPU 
die and the IHS, then reglue the IHS 
back down for far lower temperatures. 
Still terrifying, but in the hunt for 
better thermals, overclocks, and 
more, we simply have to give it a try. 
Set up Storage SpaceS in WindoWS 10
We’ve been messing around with a plethora of drive setups 
recently. Whether that’s been with Dream Machine 2017, or 
our own rendering rigs, more secure drive configurations 
have begun to be a vital part of our systems, and will continue 
to be so going forward. Luckily, with Windows 10, they’re much 
easier to set up. All you need to do is click the “Start” menu, 
type “manage storage spaces,” select the drives you want to 
use, hit “create pool” at the bottom, then choose your parity, 
and you’re good to go.

BACKGROUND
Apple’s skipped its iPhone “S” update, so we skipped ahead 
a couple timezones. We went to Circuitwise headquarters, in 
Sydney, Australia, for our iPhone 8 teardown. Time to find 
out whether Apple’s merely playing numerical catch-up to 
Samsung’s Galaxy S8 line, or if glass backing and wireless 
charging warrant skipping ahead a grade. 
MAJOR TECH SPECS
•  A11 Bionic chip, with embedded M11 motion coprocessor
•  64GB or 256GB onboard storage capacity
•  4.7-inch IPS multitouch 1334x750 (326 ppi) Retina HD display
•  12MP camera with f/1.8 aperture, optical image stabilization, 
and 5x digital zoom
•  7MP FaceTime HD camera with f/2.2 aperture and 1080p HD 
recording capability
•  Support for fast-charge and Qi wireless charging
•  802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi, MIMO, Bluetooth 5.0, and NFC
KEY FINDINGS
•  Features include a solid-state home “button,” with Touch ID 
fingerprint sensor, and a (still) IPS display, similar to the one 
in the iPhone 7 (but now featuring True Tone). On the back, 
we spy the snazzy new glass backing, with its seven-layer 
color finish. Apple assures us that it is reinforced with “an 
internal laser-welded steel and copper structure,” but time 
and durability tests will tell if this phone will suffer from a 
snap, crackle, pop—or another Bendgate. 
•  As we crack open the display, we are greeted by the display 
cable bracket, but instead of the cursed tri-point screws, 
we’re met by friendly Phillips #000 screws! We decouple a 
few cables—battery, display, and home button—and the 
display is free! We note a lack of gaskets on the display’s 
pentalobe tabs, previously seen in the iPhone 7. However, 
both the iPhone 7 and 8 have an IP67 water resistance rating. 
•  A new Lightning port bracket seems to reinforce the new 
peach-colored port and trap the Taptic engine. Up until now, 
we’ve plugged along with our Phillips screwdriver—but in 
removing this bracket, we encountered our first tri-point 
screw. We suspect the colored Lightning port could be made 
of a heat-transferring plastic to allow for safer fast-charging. 
•  We take a stab at separating the rear glass, but after a lot of 
heat and wetwork, we’ve instead shivved our way under the 
reinforcement panel. After more arduous stabbing, we get 
the seven-layer burrito glass sandwich off the midframe. 
This isn’t what we thought Apple meant when it said the glass 
was stronger. The process left the backing plate a bit bent. 
•  Repairability Score: 6 out of 10 (10 is easiest to repair). The 
two most commonly replaced components, display and 
battery, remain straightforward to access with the proper 
knowledge and tools. Wireless charging means less strain 
on your Lightning port, a common point of failure. Water and 
dust seals complicate repair, but make the need for difficult 
liquid-damage repairs less likely. The battery connector 
sports common Phillips/JIS fasteners—but you still need up 
to four different driver types for many repairs. The durability 
of the glass back remains to be seen—but replacements are 
likely to be very difficult. The iPhone’s lower components, 
once readily removed, now lie trapped under a fussy 
combination of brackets and delicately folded flex cables.

Power and heat
When you overclock, applying more voltage and ramping up the 
multiplier inevitably does two things to your rig: it introduces 
more heat to your system, and draws more power from the wall. 
You need to make sure you have a power supply that has around 
20 to 30 percent more headroom than you’re currently using, 
and ensure that your cooling solution is suitable for the task. We 
recommend that your chassis has, as the absolute minimum, 
two well-ventilated intake fans, one exhaust fan, and a suitably 
powerful CPU heatsink. You can achieve this with some of the 
chunkier air coolers, but you’ll get better results by investing in 
an AIO (all-in-one) liquid cooler. Any processor with fewer than six 
threads needs a 120mm AIO, while we recommend a 240mm AIO 
for 6 to 16 threads, and for anything higher than that, you need a 
280mm AIO, or a full custom loop.

how well our system handles at stock. To do this, we head 
to the BIOS and activate the Extreme Memory Profile (or XMP). 
Restart your system, mash the Delete key, and enter Asus’s UEFI 
BIOS. Then, hit F7 to go into Advanced Mode, and select the “Ai 
Tweaker” menu at the top [image b]. Go down to “Ai Overclock 
Tuner,” and select “XMP.” Hit F10, save, and go back to the desktop.
If you’ve read our revIew of the Core i9-7980XE on page 76 [image a], you’ll know it’s one 
monster of a processor. This thing is a beast: 18 cores and 36 threads of pure 14nm fury made 
manifest. Assuming you’re willing to invest the $2,000 needed to home this heady chip, or eager to 
splash the cash on any of the prestigious Skylake-X processors, if you want to get the most out of 
your new CPU, the only option is to overclock it. 
It’s fair to say that Intel hasn’t had the best of times when it comes to overclocking its last two 
generations of chips. Both the mainstream Z270 and HEDT X299 chipsets have been fraught with 
everything from temperature issues to VRM throttling, and more. There’s plenty of aftermarket 
solutions to these conundrums, though, from delidding and replacing the stock thermal paste on 
your sexy slither of silicon, to using a more substantial cooling solution to chill the VRMs.
However, that’s not to say these chips can’t clock, because, boy, they really can. And with the 
Core i9-7980XE clocking a phenomenal 30 percent improvement in both single and multicore 
performance in render-heavy workloads, the temptation to amp up the voltages is arguably greater 
than ever. So, how do you get the most out of your chip? We’re here to show you. –ZAK STOREY

window, and look for the subheading with your processor’s model 
name in it. Take note of the maximum temperature of the overall 
package, and the highest core clock achieved across all cores.

chanGe the mUltiPlier
Now, open CPU-Z and Cinebench R15. In the latter, run 
the CPU test, and note down the score when it’s finished. 
While it’s running, take a quick look at the Core Voltage, displayed 
by CPU-Z. Head back into the BIOS, and straight back to the “Ai 
Tweaker” section. Find the drop-down menu that reads “CPU Core 
Ratio.” By default, this should be set to “Auto,” so change it to “Sync 
All Cores.” Now to calculate your multiplier – it’s the max turbo 
frequency across all cores in GHz multiplied by 1,000 (conversion 
to MHz), and divided by 100 (frequency of the base clock). Once you 
know this, you can then change the “All-Core Ratio Limit” from 
“Auto” to a suitable multiplier of your choice. We recommend going 
up by one or two at a time. 
5 
retest
Once you’ve changed the multiplier, scroll down to “CPU Core 
Voltage,” change it to “Manual,” then set the override voltage 
to the one you noted down earlier from CPU-Z during your test. 
We’re going to start out using 1.0V, with a multiplier of 36 [image d]. 
Then hit F10, save, and exit, log in to the desktop, and run the same 
tests we performed earlier to see whether your overclock, with the 
new multiplier, is stable.
6 
keeP GoinG
Keep increasing the multiplier, until you reach instability and 
blue screen. At this point, you need to head back to the BIOS 
D
E
and increase the core voltage. It’s extremely important not 
to overload the chip with too much voltage—we suggest 
increasing the VCore by 0.05V at a time, especially on the 
higher end Skylake X chips. Then head back to the desktop 
to see whether your chip is stable in the benchmarks. 
You should start to see an increase in both power draw 
and temperature at this point. Then it’s simply a case of 
increasing the voltage and multiplier until you can no 
longer achieve a stable overclock, then dial back the 
multiplier by one or two, and you’re all set.
7 
additional tweaks
There are a few extra things we can do to improve 
stability and push our overclock further, the first of 
which is altering the VRM profile. Back in the “Ai Tweaker” 
menu, go into the “External Digi+ Power Control” 
section. Once there, find the setting labeled “VRM Spread 
Spectrum,” and disable it. Then, find the “CPU Power 
Phase Control” setting, and change that from “Auto” to 
“Extreme”—this should help balance the current across 
the VRMs, ensuring a higher overclock. Finally, if you 
want to go all-out, go back to “Ai Tweaker,” then to “Intel 
CPU Power Management,” and disable “Intel’s Speedstep 
technology” [image e].
8 
measUre yoUr Gains
That ensures you get the absolute most out of your 
overclock attempts with Skylake-X. Then you can 
go back to desktop, and run Cinebench R15 again, to see 
just how much performance you’ve gained. 
You can actually do a fair amount of 
this from the desktop, using Intel’s 
Extreme Tuning Utility (XTU). It’s a neat 
piece of freeware developed by Intel, 
which enables you to adjust a variety 
of settings from the desktop. You can 
adjust the multiplier, base clock, and 
voltages, and apply these settings 
direct from the desktop. You still face 
similar instability issues once you push 
the multiplier higher, but it does save 
time, as you don’t need to restart your 
rig every time you apply new settings.
The only major downsides are to do 
with how you apply the core voltage. By 
default, Intel’s XTU sets it to “Adaptive” 
(think “Auto”)—to change this, you have 
to adjust the “Core Voltage” figure 
to the right (we recommend 1.0V for 
any Skylake-X chip), then change the 
“Core Voltage Mode” from “Adaptive” 
to “Static,” and adjust the “Core Voltage 
Offset” by the increments we mention in 
the main tutorial.
It even detects whether you’ve 
made any changes in BIOS and applies 
them directly to the same settings on 
desktop, and includes its own stress 
tests and integrated benchmarks, along 
with a plethora of monitoring tools.

Secure Your 
Network Devices
1
Port-based VLaNs
Routers that support VLANs enable you to segment your 
network by assigning separate VLANs to individual Ethernet 
ports. Everything plugged into that port (including any switch you 
connect) becomes a member of that VLAN. Some routers—including 
the TP-Link Archer VR900 we’re featuring here [Image a]—can also 
assign wireless networks to specific VLANs.
2
CoNfIgure your router
Once you’ve consulted its manual to discover how to set 
up port-based VLANs, log into your router’s configuration 
utility via your web browser. Archer VR900 users should navigate 
to “Advanced > Network > LAN Settings > Interface Grouping” 
[Image b]. Click “Add,” give your group a name, and select which 
ports and wireless networks will become part of the new VLAN. 
Make sure “Enable Group Isolation” is checked, and click “OK”—
this ensures the VR900 bans any cross-network traffic.
>> Each new VLAN is assigned a different subnet. To see what 
these settings now are, you need to go back to “LAN Settings.” 
Any devices connected to this VLAN that don’t use DHCP for their 
network settings need to be manually configured to access the 
new subnet.
EvEr wantEd to split your nEtwork in two (or more)? Perhaps you want to divide up an 
Internet connection in a shared household, giving everyone their own private network, or maybe 
you’re worried about certain devices from a security point of view, and would like to isolate them 
from the rest of your network. Perhaps you’re interested in dividing between home and work, or 
have heard you might be able to improve overall network performance by splitting off those devices 
that often bring things grinding to a halt.
The potential solution to all these problems is to set up a VLAN (virtual LAN). VLAN-capable 
hardware enables you to split a single physical network into two or more separate entities. They 
share your Internet connection, but nothing else. Many mid to high-end consumer routers offer 
VLAN capabilities, while managed (or “smart”) switches offer varying levels of VLAN support, too.
If your router doesn’t seem to support VLANs, visit www.dd-wrt.com to see if it supports the 
open-source DD-WRT firmware. If it does, replacing your stock firmware with this—a task we don’t 
recommend for less experienced users (you could render your router unusable)—can 
give you VLAN capabilities similar to those outlined below. –Nick peers

Managed switches, such as TP-Link’s TL-SG108E, 
also come with support for VLANs, enabling you 
to set up VLANs for different locations in your home using 
smart switches as the central point—particularly handy in 
a powerline network, where your switch can’t be directly 
plugged into the router.
>> Log in to your SG108E’s Easy Smart Configuration 
utility. Switch to the “VLAN” tab, and you’ll see several 
options. “MTU VLAN” is a rough and ready option, enabling 
you to quickly isolate all the ports from each other—
but your devices remain visible and accessible to any 
computer not connected via the switch. The best option 
by far is “802.1Q VLAN,” which works by tagging network 
traffic in each VLAN with the VLAN ID, enabling it to be 
filtered accordingly.

Select “802.1Q VLAN,” set its status to “Enable,”

2–4094 are available).
>> The “VLAN Name” field is optional. Assuming your 
switch is connected to the rest of your network via port 1, 
click “1” under “Tagged Ports.” The port can be a member 
of multiple VLANs, enabling you to provide Internet access

to all the VLANs you create. Next, select the ports you wish to 
isolate from the rest of your network, by clicking their numbers 
in turn under “Untagged Ports.” Click “Apply.” Now select “802.1Q 
PVID Setting” in the left-hand menu. Type the VLAN ID you set 
up into the “PVID” field, then check all the untagged ports you’re 
isolating, and click “Apply” [Image C].
>> The effect should be immediate. Try pinging any of the devices 
on this switch from your PC via a command prompt, and you should 
get no response, or a “destination unreachable” error [Image d]. 
Congratulations—you’ve just isolated these devices from the rest 
of your network; they should still have Internet access, enabling 
you to remotely connect to smart home equipment, for example. 
Add more VLANs to split devices further.
5
exteNd VLaN
If you have two or more managed switches, you can extend 
your VLANs from one switch to the next, which enables you 
to group devices together into the same VLAN, even if they’re on 
different switches. In this scenario, only one of your switches needs 
to be connected to your router—the other is connected daisy-chain 
fashion to the first switch. The diagram [Image e] reveals how 
this works in practice—we tested this successfully using TP-Link 
SG108E and TP-Link SG2008 switches. 
>> First, make sure the switches are connected as shown, then 
open the Easy Smart Configuration Utility on the SG108E, and 
navigate to the “802.1Q VLAN” section. Follow the advice in step 
four to set up your two VLANs as shown in the diagram—remember, 
port 1 is tagged, and all other ports are untagged. Don’t forget to set 
the PVIDs. Click “Save” when you’re done.

navigate to “VLAN.” Type “101” into the “VLAN ID” box, and 
click “Create,” then repeat to create VLAN 102.
>> Next, check the box next to “101” in the VLAN table. 
Set port 1 to untagged and port 2 to tagged, both with a 
PVID of 1, and set ports 3–5 as untagged, with a PVID of 
101 [Image f]. Click “Apply,” then select “102” in the VLAN 
table, set ports 1 and 2 as previously, and ports 6–8 to 
untagged, with a PVID of 102. Click “Apply” again.
>> You should now find that devices can only see other 
devices within the same VLAN using the ping test. Internet 
access should be available to both VLANs. Any devices 
connected to either switch that aren’t placed in either 
VLAN remain visible to both VLAN groups and the rest of 
your network. Job done. 
E
When you want to divide a physical network up, each separate 
part is known as a subnet. You can identify which subnet a 
device belongs to by the first three numbers in your IP 
address—for example, 192.168.0. Networked devices can 
only see other devices on the same subnet, so a device with an 
IP address of 192.168.0.2 can see another device on the same 
physical network with an IP of 192.168.0.3. It cannot, however, 
see one with the IP address 192.168.1.3, because 192.168.1 is 
a separate subnet.
VLANs work in a different way—instead of carving up the 
network into different subnets, they insert a tag or “magic 
packet” into network traffic sent to and from the VLAN, 
ensuring it’s filtered accordingly.

Make Cut-Out Text 
in Photoshop
1 
Choose a baCkground image
A little planning goes a long way here. You want an image with 
an area that will still be interesting when you put the text over it 
and only part of it is visible, coupled with some strong interest in the 
areas not covered in text. If your background image is recognizable 
enough, you can go ahead and completely cover it in text, but make 
sure the letterforms fall in such a way that the most recognizable 
parts of the image show through—the eyes and mouth if you’re 
using a face, for example. We’ve chosen a photo of a motherboard 
[image a], as if this magazine wasn’t already full enough with them, 
and what a beauty it is: that pin-grid array, that ZIF locking lever, 
those capacitors.... We get the shivers just thinking about it.
2 
Find a Font
Enough of that. Let’s cover up the board’s nakedness with 
some text. Choose your font with care, because a typeface 
can say a great deal about your project, even before a viewer has 
begun to read the words. Some are designed for use in large blocks 
of running copy, while others are meant for shouting headlines, 
and some are novelty typefaces, meant for decoration as much 
as conveying information. What we’re saying is: Don’t cover your 
image in Comic Sans or Strumpf if you want to be taken seriously. 
Also, consider the layout of your lettering. Groups of three letters 
look good, but whole words arranged in a vertical stack can also 
Cut-out text is a staple of the advertising world, and Amazon Prime’s Preacher series uses it to 
great effect in its titles. Blending images and text in this way looks stylish, and has uses far beyond 
violent, stylized comic-book adaptations. 
Photoshop has some sophisticated typography tools, the match of those in some page layout 
software, and full support for vector fonts, so you can do just about anything you like with lines of 
text—you can even set full paragraphs if you want, but Photoshop isn’t really the best application 
for doing that.
Rather than cutting out parts of your background image and pasting them over your letter shapes, 
to give the impression that the letters have been turned into holes showing the layer underneath 
them, you actually do turn the letters into holes. It’s called a “clipping mask” in Photoshop parlance, 
and it’s used for all kinds of graphic design elements and special effects tricks. Master this, and 
there’s nothing you can’t do in Photoshop. –Ian EvEndEn

have a lot of impact. Don’t try to cram too much in, because 
readability from a distance is key with a design like this.

tweak your text
The “Character” panel, found under the “Window” 
menu, and its brother the “Paragraph” panel 
[image b] are the ones you need to control type in your 
composition. As you’ve probably deduced from their 
names, “Character” is for use on individual letters, while 
“Paragraph” affects whole blocks of text at a time. They do 
slightly different things, with “Character” geared toward 
letter sizes and spacing, while “Paragraph” contains 
options for alignment and indents. Type out your text, 
use Enter to put it on as many lines as you want, select it 
with the mouse, and use “Character” to change font size.

The standard Photoshop drop-down menu only goes as high as 
72pt, which in these days of high-resolution images looks comically 
small. We had to go up to 300pt for our image, which isn’t particularly 
large. Adjust the vertical spacing of your lines using the box with 
two letter As on top of one another—for tight spacing, make it less 
than your point size—we went for 250pt [image C]. Using the two 
capital T boxes, you can adjust the height and width of your letters, 
while V/A is for kerning (how close the letters are to one another). 
Play around, and get your text looking the way you want.
4 
add something to Cut through
Getting on to the clipping mask, first we need to provide 
it with something to clip through. We’re going to use the 
Rectangle tool to create a simple black rectangle that covers half 
our image. This appears as a Live Shape, and therefore on its own 
layer, so there’s no need to create a new one first. Move your text so 
it’s on the same side of your image as the black rectangle.
5 
re-arrange your layers
Now we need to do a little layer shuffling. Create a new layer 
and fill it with black, or a color that fits your image and the 
mood you’re trying to convey, placing it just above “Background” 
in the stack [image d]. Double click “Background” to turn it into 
a normal layer, and move it to the top of the stack. Select your 
D
text and rectangle layers, and use Ctrl-G to group them, 
placing them second in the stack.
6 
Clip away
Now for the clipping. Right-click the top layer 
and select “Create Clipping Mask.” Immediately, 
you should be able to see through to the layers below 
[image e]. The clever thing about these masks is that your 
text remains editable, and you can still play with Blend 
modes to change how the layers relate to each other—
though they may not respond precisely as you expect. 
The rectangle shape can be altered by selecting its layer 
and using “Edit Free > Transform.” Keep in mind the way 
the layers are stacked, if you’re wondering why fading a 
layer out is affecting a completely different part of the 
image. Save your work as a PSD file to preserve the layer 
structure, and export as a PNG when you want to share it, 
using “File > Export > Export As.” Adobe is in the process 
of retiring “Save For Web,” but if you want to use it instead, 
it’s still there on the “Export” menu, marked “Legacy.” 
E
Masks are incredibly useful in Photoshop, but 
operate slightly differently from selections, and 
can feel like they come from a backward dimension. 
When you select, you’re choosing pixels you want 
to operate on. When you mask, you’re choosing the 
pixels that will fall outside the area being affected by 
what you do next. So, if you use a Quick Mask to paint 
over the face in a portrait, for example, you’ll get a 
selection at the end of the process that excludes the 
face, and you need to go to “Select > Inverse” to get 
the same result as if you’d gone over the face with the 
Quick Selection tool.

Coffee Flavored 
Processing
As consumers, it’s our responsibility to give 
the industry crap if it’s failing us. It’s the very 
notion of a capitalist democracy: If you don’t 
like something, change it; if you can’t change 
it, make your voice heard.
People were fed up with four cores being 
the mainstream norm, so AMD responded 
with its Ryzen lineup. Eight months on, 
we’re witness to Intel’s response: Coffee 
Lake.  With its confusing architectural lineup, 
an increase in core count finally makes it to 
the company’s mainstream processors. 
Although lacking some of the wow factor 
associated with a new architecture, at the top 
end Coffee Lake provides six of Intel’s highly 
refined Kaby Lake cores, with slight tweaks 
to power efficiency and base clocks, at a 
similar, if not identical, price. What you’re left 
with is a processor capable of ripping up any 
multithreaded application, while retaining 
the title of single-thread processing king. 
That’s not to say it’s perfect—the top-end 
part is hot, exceedingly so. The addition of 
those two extra cores hasn’t come for free, 
and coupled with Intel’s continued refusal 
to provide any form of suitable TIM material 
between the IHS and the die, you’re left with 
a six-core, 12-thread part that can generate 
80 C of heat at stock under load. That’s hot—
and not the sexy kind. 
Coffee Lake’s real gem is the Core i5-8400. 
At just $190, it’s six cores and six threads 
of well-balanced performance, without the 
crazy temperature issues of the 8700K.

The core i5 series has always been centered around gamers. Its 
heritage goes back a long way, to the days of the Core i5-2500K 
and Sandy Bridge, as the chip of choice for anyone wanting to 
enjoy a casual gaming session. As such, it’s one of the world’s 
more popular chips, at least in the custom PC ecosystem. 
This issue, we decided to recreate that idea of a perfect mid-
range gaming system. One capable of driving what we consider 
the new mid-ground for resolution: 1440p with relative ease at 
60fps. But what do you pair with a Core i5 to really give it a kick?
We knew we wanted to run a GTX 1070 in this build—our MSI 
Gaming X being a solid choice for that position. As far as 1440p 
goes, the GTX 1070 is the perfect budget GPU, bringing last-gen 
Titan X performance to mainstream prices.
On top of that, we threw in a healthy 16GB of DDR4, alongside 
a 480GB Crucial BX300, and a 1TB Seagate Constellation.2 2.5-
inch hard drive—the latter being particularly important. Deciding 
to invest in a quiet 1,200W full-size PSU alongside a 360mm AIO 
meant we had to ditch the hard drive caddy for 3.5-inch drives 
below the PSU cover. However, Fractal includes a neat little 
2.5-inch mounting tray behind the motherboard. Simply invest 
in a small form factor high-capacity HDD, and the problems are 
solved, leaving us with 1.5TB of workable storage for all our 
applications and media.
When Building A neW sysTem, we usually recommend 
that you strip your chassis down as far as you possibly 
can. Remove all the panels, and place them out of the 
way, in the box that the case was delivered in. This 
means that you won’t damage the panels as you put 
your system together, and you’ll have more room to 
work in. With the Meshify chassis, because the I/O is 
located on the top and front of the case, it’s impossible 
to fully remove that front panel without damaging the 
cables. Simply put, carefully remove the panel only 
when you want to install fans or radiators in the front 
of the chassis.
modulAr poWer supplies Are greAT for a number 
of reasons. For starters, they reduce the amount of 
cable clutter inside your build. They are often higher 
specced and more efficient than their non-modular 
cousins as well, and they tend to be easier to install, 
too. That said, when installing a PSU like this, you 
should figure out just what cables you’re going to need 
to use, then plug them into the PSU while it’s outside 
the chassis. It’ll save you time and frustration in the 
long run, because there’s nothing worse than clipping 
in those connectors under a cramped PSU cover, as in 
the Meshify C.

Although the Meshify C is technically an ATX midi tower, it’s 
worth remembering that C notation in its name. It stands 
for “compact.” And it certainly is. Install a full-length rad 
in the front, and GPU length suddenly becomes food for 
thought. If you do decide on a longer card, yet still want to 
retain that cooling, you’d have to drop down to a 240mm 
AIO, and mount it in the roof instead, then install three 
additional fans in the front, for better air intake.
When iT comes to all-in 
one liquid coolers, you’re 
often limited by the sizes 
on offer. Thanks, in no 
small part, to the patents 
that Asetek has taken out 
on its cooling technology, 
it 
can 
be 
somewhat 
challenging 
to 
find 
anything above 280mm 
in 
size. 
Fortunately, 
Thermaltake is one of 
the few manufacturers 
that still go up to and 
beyond 
that 
280mm 
limitation. The 360mm 
Riing Floe is perfect for 
any toasty Coffee Lake 
processor—even 
our 
Core i5-8400 sits merrily 
at just 40 C. There 
are 
some 
additional 
superfluous 
cables 
that come with it, which 
connect to a USB RGB 
fan hub, but that aside, 
this is the perfect AIO for 
our build.

Asus has really worked hard on 
integrating its m.2 heatshields into 
the design of its mobos. They look great,

yeah, we’re not really sure why 
Thermaltake decided to put the 
tubes in front of the logo either.
We’ve Thoroughly enjoyed the processor 
race of the last year. From Kaby Lake to Ryzen 
to Coffee Lake, 14nm has produced some 
absolute gems. And we can safely say that 
older parts—even our favorite, the Intel Core 
i5-2500K—might finally be drawing their last 
gasps, as single-core performance and core 
count increase so dramatically.
All in all, this build was a pretty smooth 
ride. We had a few issues with placement 
fairly early on, but it all worked out in the end. 
The triple rad in the front caused the most 
issues. We did intend to use a 2TB 3.5-inch 
drive in the lower hard drive cage, under the 
PSU cover, but as we had a large PSU and that 
rad in the front with the fans, we couldn’t fit it 
all in, so had to use a 2.5-inch instead. Not the 
end of the world, but we do expect it to affect 
performance in games and media load times. 
We were saved by Fractal’s mounting tray 
across the back of the motherboard cut-out, 
which supports up to three 2.5-inch devices. 
More Thermaltake rage came in the form 
of the cooler’s RGB fans. Fortunately, they 
only have one cable, but they are USB-headed, 
and plug directly into an included USB hub, 
which then plugs into a molex power, then into 
a USB port on the motherboard, forcing you 
to use Thermaltake’s software, and adding 
excessive lengths of cable to the build—
less than ideal for the Meshify’s already 
compact compartmentalization.
Moaning over—how was performance? 
Pretty damn good. It’s amazing how far Intel 
has come just by adding two more two cores 
to the majority of its lineup. Seeing those 
multithreaded scores climb as high as 956 
points, for a $190 part, is pretty awesome for 
Team Blue. That’s just a touch off the pace of 
our zero-point’s overclocked Core i7-6700K. 
But if you compare the Core i5-8400 against its 
$190 competitor from AMD, the Ryzen 5 1500X, 
it starts to paint a better picture. Single-core 
performance is 12 points higher, multi-core 
150 points higher, and you don’t have to worry 
about potential memory compatibility issues. 
The big difference lies in Intel’s reluctance 
to unlock all of its processors, though. 
Hypothetically, you can still overclock the 
1500X, eking out just enough performance to 
surpass its competitor.
So, is this the core to have? We’ll let you 
decide, but for a mid-range build, it’s perfect 
for demolishing that 1440p target alongside 
a GTX 1070. We saw average frame rates at 
1440p sit comfortably at 67 and 64fps in Far 
Cry Primal and The Division respectively, 
with 38 and 35 in Total War: Attila and Rise 
of the Tomb Raider. It’s a cool, well-equipped 
rig, with enough grunt to future-proof you 
for the next five years, minimum, and that’s 
something we can definitely get behind.

So it iS with Intel’s new Core i9 megachips. 
For years, we’ve been begging Intel to cut 
the crap and launch some really exciting 
CPUs that properly push the boundaries of 
performance. After all, Intel’s Xeon server 
chips have offered huge core counts well 
beyond its desktop lines for years.
Then Intel suddenly revealed plans for 
chips with up to 18 cores and, somehow, 
there was skepticism. It seemed like a 
cynical ploy to undermine the impact of 
AMD’s Ryzen Threadripper processors. 
That notion was only enhanced by the 
fact that Intel announced the new many-
core models without revealing detailed 
specifications. Knee jerks all around, in 
other words.
But we’re far beyond rumored spec 
sheets now. Today, we have the Core i9-
7980X, the $2,000 daddy of them all, in 
our dirty paws. And what a monster it is. 
The 18 cores and 36 threads you already 
knew about. To those you can add a base 
clock of 2.6GHz, a Turbo speed of 3.4GHz, 
and a TurboMax of 4.4GHz. If that 2.6GHz 
figure looks pretty puny, in practice the 
actual operating speeds of these new 
many-core chips are quite complex. They 
involve a sliding scale that starts with that 
preferred-core 4.4GHz, and gently tails off 
to 3.4GHz with all 18 cores heavily loaded, 
albeit with the proviso that the AVX floating 
point engines aren’t maxed out. In that 
Be careful what you ask for. You might just get it...

scenario, speeds will be lower, though it’s 
not clear how much.
In between, there’s a number of 
intermediate frequencies that come into 
play when several cores are loaded, but 
not all 18. For instance, with between 5 
and 12 cores under load, you can expect a 
frequency of 3.9GHz. Whatever, from all of 
this there are two take-homes. First, forget 
about that modest-looking 2.6GHz. Nearly 
all the time, this is, at worst, a 3.4GHz chip. 
Second, when the core counts get this high, 
even the seemingly simple question of how 
fast a CPU runs becomes complicated.
Elsewhere, the specs look as beefy as 
you’d expect. The 7980XE, of course, slots 
into Intel’s LGA2066 socket, hooks up to 
four DDR4 memory DIMMs, and supports 
quad-channel frequencies up to 2,666MHz. 
You also get 1.375MB of L3 cache memory 
per core for a grand total of 24.75MB, plus 
44 PCI Express lanes directly into the chip. 
That latter figure is, perhaps, the only area 
where the 7980XE looks a little lightweight 
versus its AMD Threadripper nemeses. 
Those AMD CPUs pack 64 lanes.
What Threadripper can’t do—not even 
the top 16-core model—is match the 
7980XE’s stellar all-around performance. 
Doubters, prepare to suck it up. This CPU 
flies. It hammers the AMD competition in 
single-threaded tests. Intel’s cores are 
still the best in the business in stand-alone 
terms. But the contest in multithreaded 
workloads isn’t such a given, what with 
AMD’s clever modular approach using two 
CPU dies to Intel’s monolithic architecture. 
But, in the end, Intel owns it all. 
The 7980XE sails straight past the 
Ryzen 7 1950X’s 3,012 points in Cinebench 
to record 3,331 points. Similarly, it’s ahead 
at 41fps to 38fps in x265 video encoding. In 
Fry Render, the gap is even bigger, with the 
Intel chip completing the test in 64 seconds 
to AMD’s 85.
As for games, the headline benchmark 
results don’t tell the whole story. Intel’s 
architecture doesn’t need any complicated 
game modes, and it doesn’t suffer from 
stutter in some titles, like AMD. It’s 
comfortably the better option for gamers. 
As if all that wasn’t enough, the 7980XE is 
an overclocking beast. We got it running 
at 4.4GHz on all 18 cores, at which speed it 
clocked a crazy 4,284 points in Cinebench, 
not to mention over 500W power draw at 
the wall. In short, this is easily the fastest 
and finest CPU in history. As well it should 
be for 2,000 bucks. –Jeremy Laird

It’s been one hell of a year for processor 
launches: Kaby Lake, Ryzen, Threadripper, 
Skylake-X, Kaby Lake-X, and now Coffee 
Lake as well. That’s six different SKUs 
in less time than it takes to spit, each 
housing a plethora of fantastic advances 
for the computing enthusiast. It’s hard 
to deny just how much of an effect AMD’s 
Ryzen has had on the industry. Intel, in 
particular, has upped its game in response 
to the multithreaded prowess of the red 
core. And that response has come in two 
forms: Skylake-X to combat Threadripper 
at the high end, and Coffee Lake to take the 
fight back to the mid-range.
So, then, what’s so different? To be 
honest, not a lot. Coffee Lake’s architecture 
isn’t very different from its Kaby Lake 
predecessor—it’s 
more 
a 
refinement 
of that architecture, which is, in itself, a 
refinement of Skylake. The big difference 
lies in core count. Intel has reshuffled both 
core and thread counts across its range. 
The Core i7-8700K features 6 cores and 12 
threads, the Core i5 has six cores and six 
threads, the Core i3 comes with four cores 
and four threads, and (if the rumors are to 
be believed) the Pentium has just two cores 
and four threads. 
It’s still shy of the eight cores found 
on AMD’s Ryzen 7 1800X. However, Intel 
is banking on its outstanding single-
core

pricing to level the playing field. And they 
certainly do.
The Core i7-8700K is impressive. 
Although 
architecturally 
identical 
to 
its predecessor, both its synthetic and 
real-world 
benchmark 
performance 
is exceptional. Scoring 1,553 points in 
Cinebench R15 puts it just 60 points 
behind the Ryzen 7 1800X. The big 
difference, though, lies in that single-core 
performance, as expected—the 8700K 
comes in at 205 points, versus Ryzen’s 159. 
This also translates in-game, because it 
scores higher than any of the processors 
we’ve tested in the last year. 
And 
there’s 
the 
clincher: 
Intel’s 
core architecture is a well-established 
platform. Whether it’s memory support, in-
game performance, or platform reliability, 
it just all works. There are caveats to this 
“more cores” approach, however. We’ve 
seen power draw increase by over 88W 
under load, compared to the last-gen 
Core i7-7700K, even drawing 10W more 
than Ryzen’s 1800X, and temperatures 
are elevated, too. Under our 280mm AIO, 
temps easily hit 70 C or more at stock. 
It’s a well-established fact at this point 
that Intel still refuses to solder the IHS 
to the dies of its CPUs, leading to higher 
temperatures overall. It’s disappointing, 
although the Ryzen parts aren’t exactly 
chilled 
chips, 
either. 
Adjusting 
the 
manufacturing process to go back to that 
Sandy Bridge-style of solder would have 
alleviated these temperature issues, and 
allowed for beefier stock clocks on the 
majority of its parts, without necessarily 
losing out on stability, potentially enabling 
team blue to surpass AMD’s Ryzen flagship 
with little risk.
Because of that, the overclocking is 
equally not as stellar an experience. 
Although we managed to get our chip up 
to 5.2GHz (maximum true turbo sticks 
resolutely at 3.7GHz), both temperature 
and stability held us back from going any 
further. Again, we’re at that point where 
the only solution would be to delid the 
processor to take it higher, something not 
exactly enticing for the average user.
The Core i7-8700K is an impressive 
retaliatory blow to AMD’s Ryzen. It comes 
at an attractive price, on an already well-
established platform, and unless AMD can 
really drop the price points on its Ryzen 
components, it makes far more sense for 
everyday upgraders to opt for team blue 
over team red, at least until Ryzen 2 arrives 
next year. –Zak storey

We mentioned in our upgrade feature 
(pg. 26) how the Vega series has been a 
botched launch for AMD. Whether that’s the 
jabbing marketing campaigns, the hushed-
up launch, the confusion over initial price 
rebates, or the horrendous power draw, 
pricing, and performance of Red’s flagship 
card, it’s been less than appealing to 
jump aboard the AMD hype train. Vega 
56, on the other hand, is a different beast. 
Almost. It’s designed to challenge the mid 
to high-end range of GPUs, sitting snuggly 
between the GTX 1070 and GTX 1080, at an  
affordable price.
So, what are the key differences between 
this and its elderly kingpin, the Vega 64? 
For a start, the core clocks have been 
reduced by 90MHz (from a 1,247 core clock 
down to 1,156), you get 512 fewer streaming 
cores (limiting it to 3,584), and 32 fewer 
TMUs (Texture Mapping Units). Everything 
else is identical, from the ROPs to the 8GB 
of HBM 2.0 VRAM. The big differentiator is 
the price. You can currently grab a Vega 56 
for a cool $500, compared to the 64’s $620. 
And it’s that last part that makes most, if 
not all the difference.
For the price, Vega 56 is a totally 
acceptable mid-range 1440p card. In our 
testing, it easily hit the 60fps sweet spot 
at the QHD resolution, with an average

frame rate of 69 in Far Cry Primal, 67 in 
The Division, and Total War: Attila and 
Rise of the Tomb Raider scoring 31 and 36 
respectively. On top of that, power draw 
was far more acceptable than its beefier 
cousin, drawing a maximum of 331W 
throughout our load testing.
AMD has clearly been working on the 
latest drivers for these cards as well, 
because we saw a marked improvement in 
frame rates since first testing Vega 64. In 
fact, in some cases, the 56 outperformed 
the 64’s figures on our first testing runs. 
This helps shunt the 56 slightly higher 
than the GTX 1070 in most cases as well, 
with the card registering a 5–10 percent 
performance increase over its Nvidia rival. 
However, there’s a problem. Let’s get 
one thing straight: If you’re after a card 
designed to hash out cryptocurrency, Vega 
is the go-to card right now. Nvidia falls a 
little flat in this regard, which is good for 
consumers, and sort of bad for AMD’s 
rep. As the GeForce series is drastically 
cheaper than its AMD counterparts, if 
all you’re interested in is gaming, Nvidia 
reigns as king—quite dramatically, in fact. 
You can pick up a GTX 1070 right now for 
less than $400. That’s a $100 saving for 
a performance difference of less than 
7 percent. For a card that’s cooler, quieter, 
with aftermarket versions available, and 
drawing less power from the wall, it’s hard 
to argue against it.
Ultimately, the Radeon RX Vega 56 is a 
solid attempt at capitalizing on the Vega 
architecture. Its performance and design 
are decent enough for the price. However, 
Nvidia still lies unchallenged across the 
lion’s share of the high end, with AMD’s 
only hope lying with Vega 56. And with 
rumors of a GTX 1070 Ti now seemingly 
set in stone, it’s unlikely that we’ll see 
AMD make its way back into the hearts 
of gamers and out of the hands of the 
cryptofiends anytime soon. –Zak Storey

laptop that offers solid 1080p performance 
in a frame that’s not just portable, but is 
actually light and thin enough to toss in a 
regular backpack for gaming on the go. 
The kind of machine that a college student 
could take to class, or a young professional 
into a meeting—and not have to worry 
about loud whirring fans disturbing their 
colleagues. In short, a MacBook Pro that 
can play games.
The GS63VR comes pretty close to 
fulfilling that dream. With an Intel Core i7-
7700HQ CPU, 16GB DDR4-2400 RAM, and a 
256GB SSD, the GS63VR is nearly identical 
to (if not a small step up from) the 15-
inch Apple prodigy on productivity specs, 
while its GeForce GTX 1070 absolutely 
demolishes the Mac’s Radeon Pro 555 
GPU—all while costing $300 less. 
Of course, Apple products have never 
been known for their frugality. It’s the 
intangibles—design, build quality, and 
ease of use—that make its products 
appealing to pretty much everyone who 
doesn’t want to play games. But with the

Our laptop zero-point is the Asus GL502VM-DS74, with an Intel Core i7-7700 HQ, an 8GB GTX 1070, and 16GB of 
DDR4-2400. All game tests are performed at 1080p at the highest graphical profile.
MSI GS63VR, we might have finally found 
a competitor. 
The black aluminum chassis and screen 
hinges feel solid to the touch, with an 
elegant, understated design—by gaming 
laptop standards, at least. The SteelSeries 
keyboard offers full RGB backlighting, but 
more importantly, feels great to type on. 
Similarly, the touchpad is one of the best 
we’ve used on a Windows machine. And 
while MacBooks still reign supreme in the 
battery life category, we were able to get a 
modest three hours and eight minutes out 
of the GS63VR—enough time for back-to-
back meetings or a very lengthy movie. 
The GS63VR does all this in a frame that 
weighs in at just shy of four pounds, and 
measures only 0.69 inches thick—nearly 
identical to the 15-inch MacBook Pro. But 
unlike the MBP, it can also play games.
In our gaming tests, the GS63VR pulled 
in an average of 71fps across Rise of the 
Tomb Raider’s three-part benchmark, 
scoring 95fps in the Mountain Pass, 61 in 
Syria, and 56 in the Geothermal Valley. Total 
War: Warhammer II’s Battle benchmark 
returned 55fps, while the demanding 
Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon: Wildlands 
came back at 43fps—all at 1080p using 
the highest available graphics preset. 
Performance-wise, this puts the GS63VR 
and its Max-Q-tuned GTX 1070 on par with a 
“regular” GTX 1060, as in Asus’s ROG Strix 
GL502VM or Acer’s Predator Helios 300. 
This is the one area where the GS63VR 
disappoints us. We knew there would be 
a performance trade-off that came along 
with the Max-Q design—after all, light and 
thin is essentially the antithesis to high-
performance. The Max-Q GTX 1080 that 
we tested in Asus’s ROG Zephyrus didn’t 
perfectly match a desktop-class GTX 1080, 
but it still outperformed the next card 
down: a desktop-class GTX 1070. By that 
logic, we knew a Max-Q GTX 1070 probably 
wouldn’t keep pace with a desktop 1070, but 
we were hoping it would still be a moderate 
step up from the GTX 1060. 
It seems that isn’t the case—so, why 
should you pay over $500 more for a Max-Q 
GTX 1070 than a regular GTX 1060-powered 
laptop? We already talked about size and 
weight. The other key factor is noise. Every 
GTX 1060-powered laptop we’ve tested 
sounds like a jet taking off as soon as the 
fans spin up. Not here—the GS63VR Stealth 
Pro lives up to its name. You just won’t hear 
this jet coming. –BO MOOre

Laptop engineering is often a difficult 
thing to fathom. In this case, we’ve bent 
our brains trying to work out exactly how 
Lenovo’s engineers have distorted space 
and time in order to crush everything they 
have into this tiny machine. If we drop it on 
the wrong corner, will we rip open a portal 
to another dimension? Existential worries 
aside, the list is mighty impressive. There’s 
a cool, hyper-fast Kaby Lake i5 in the CPU 
slot, a proper SSD looking after storage, 
a wholly reasonable 8GB of DDR4 RAM 
flinging the quick bits about, and discrete 
graphics, too, in the form of a GeForce 940X 
mobile chipset. All this in a 0.8-inch thick 
shell. Plus, presumably, those dangerous 
boffins have inserted a miraculously 
miniaturized portable wind tunnel in 
there—this thing makes a mighty whoosh 
through its large base-mounted ventilation 
port when it’s under load.
Just as impressive a feat is the gorgeous 
full HD IPS screen, a slim-bezel number 
that trims the side and top edges to a 
minimum, giving more screen real estate 
in a smaller 13.3-inch shell. It’s no Dell 
InfinityEdge, of course (that’s a whole other 
level of scientific engineering), but Lenovo 
has at least had the good sense to put the 
webcam at the top of the panel, rather than 
Dell’s odd off-center screen-base position. 
Nobody really wants to spend a Skype 
conversation staring at your neck, after all.
We’d say the crushed keyboard—which 
has standard-sized backlit keys, with 
regular spacing, but squashes the arrow 
keys and all other peripheral buttons into an 
oddly compacted layout—is a compromise

Our laptop zero-point is the Asus G752VT-DH72, with an Intel Core i7-6700HQ, GTX 970M, and 16GB of DDR4.  
Rise of the Tomb Raider tested at very high settings with SMAA at 1080p.
of the unit’s size, but Lenovo has replicated 
that on larger laptops. It must be a Lenovo 
“thing,” just like the ridiculous decision to 
put the power key—a keyboard key, like any 
other—right next to Delete and Backspace. 
Yes, it’s almost impossible to accidentally 
power off your machine, but come on—
that’s not great design. 
Power games
While Lenovo has definitely filled the 
aluminum shell of the 720s—and it’s 
a dense little thing, at 3.4lb—it hasn’t 
reserved a lot of that space for the battery. 
Go calm and you can, as we did, tease out 
just over five hours from its cells (the 
company claims 14, which is nonsense), 
but a decent load, and making the most 
of discrete graphics rather than the 
switchable Intel 620 chipset, drops this 
down to a shade above three hours. These 
aren’t gaming laptop numbers, but it 
doesn’t have gaming laptop power to offer 
either. That GeForce 940X is a nice extra to 
have, but it was outclassed upon release, 
let alone now, over a year later. The 720s is 
adequate for older games at low to medium 
settings, but you’re completely out of luck 
with today’s AAA titles.
But, then, this really isn’t supposed to 
be a gaming machine. It’s about working, 
and working in relative luxury—the 720s 
absolutely looks and feels like a premium 
machine, one that defies its upper-mid-
range price point. We could (and, indeed, 
did) stare at that panel for days on end. We 
wouldn’t be ashamed to whip this out in 
public, and it’s compact enough for airline 
tables or your lap in the back of a cab. The 
rhythm section of the machine is a great 
match; while a little extra SSD space would 
have been appreciated, 256GB is enough 
to get by on, and despite slightly slow read 
times, it’s quick enough. Combined with 
the dual-core i5-7200U and a perfectly 
adequate RAM supply, this machine doesn’t 
let up on desktop performance.
So, forgive it some sketchy benchmark 
figures, 
because 
raw 
power 
isn’t 
everything. Put its little compromises and 
that cacophonous fan to the back of your 
mind. The 720s is a remarkable white-coat 
combination that works for business or 
everyday pleasure, with enough squeezed 
inside that you can push it just a little 
further if you really need to. –aLex Cox

Keep those expectations in check. That’s 
not the most enthralling way to approach 
a new SSD, but it’s very much the attitude 
to have when considering a standard SATA 
drive, such as the Crucial BX300.
For starters, it’s a SATA drive in an age 
when SSDs hooked up via the far faster 
PCI Express interface are becoming ever 
more mainstream. Not only is SATA limited 
to a real-world maximum throughput of 
about 550MB/s, but its control protocols 
were never intended to jive with solid-
state memory. That means random access 
performance is compromised, compared 
with the full potential of the latest SSD 
controllers and flash memory.
What’s more, the BX300 isn’t merely a 
SATA drive. It’s an aggressively priced SATA 
drive, sold as a value offering, rather than 
a premium performance proposition. This 
480GB model, for instance, costs $145. A 
top-notch SATA drive in this 500GB-plus-
or-minus-a-few-GB category, such as 
Samsung’s 850 Pro, will hit you to the tune 
of $230. Even Samsung’s value drive, the 
850 Evo, is more expensive at $170.
So, it’s a cheap drive, and with that 
come those aforementioned reasonable 
expectations. Do not expect the BX300 to 
tear it up in the benchmarks. But before 
we nose around those particular numbers, 
let’s peruse the BX300’s speeds and feeds.
Intriguingly, Crucial has wound back 
the clock technologically, and returned 
to MLC, or two-level, flash memory cells, 
each capable of storing two bits of data. Its 
previous budget drive, the BX200, ran with

TLC, or triple-level cells. Indeed, Crucial’s 
premium offering, the MX300, retains TLC. 
That said, this isn’t old-school planar 
memory. It’s 32-layer 3D NAND memory. 
In short, due to the slightly unusual 384Gb 
capacity of Crucial’s first TLC 3D NAND 
memory chips, using them in small, 
budget-oriented SSDs doesn’t add up. 
Crucial does have more suitable 256Gb and 
128Gb chips on the way. In the meantime, a 
fallback to MLC has proved expedient.
Other highlights include Silicon Motion’s 
latest SM2258 controller chipset, 512MB of 
cache memory, and a write endurance of 
160TB. Peak speeds for the 480GB model 
are quoted at 550MB/s for reads and 
510MB/s for writes. 4K random reads and 
writes are 95k and 90k IOPS respectively. 
As for our tests, the BX300 cranks 
out some surprisingly good numbers. 
Sequential throughputs for both reads and 
writes are well over 500MB/s in ATTO Disk 
Benchmark. In CrystalDiskMark’s slightly 
tougher test of sequential performance, 
the numbers are still strong, with 536MB/s 
for reads and 486MB/s for writes.
Even more impressive for a budget 
drive are the results in CrystalDiskMark’s 
4K random access test. The BX300 spits 
out 33MB/s reads and 130MB/s writes. 
Those numbers compare favorably with 
a premium drive, such as Samsung’s 850 
Pro. In fact, all of the BX300’s performance 
numbers look good next to more expensive 
SATA SSDs.
Of course, the subjective difference 
in terms of the computing experience 
delivered by various modern SATA SSDs 
has narrowed. You would be hard pressed 
to tell the difference in terms of how 
responsive each one makes a PC feel. 
Arguably of more significance is longevity, 
and that’s where the BX300 betrays its 
budget intentions.
Crucial provides a three-year warranty, 
which matches other budget drives. 
However, Samsung’s 850 Pro comes with 
10-year cover. In the end, then, you pays 
your money and you takes your choice. If 
you need an SSD with maximum staying 
power, the BX300 isn’t for you, and you’ll 
simply need to pay more.
For most, however, three years is a 
decent lifespan for a cheap SSD. In all 
likelihood, this drive will keep on trucking 
for many years beyond. Combine that with 
very respectable performance for a budget 
SSD, and you have a pretty awesome value 
proposition. Just so long as you keep those 
expectations reasonable. –Jeremy Laird

Hands, eH? Weird things. Even if you’re 
not under the influence of mind-bending 
drugs, looking at your hands for any 
length of time will confirm just how 
strange 
those 
wiggly 
flesh-tentacles 
truly are. Every tried to draw a hand? 
It’s impossible—for good reason. And 
everyone’s fingers are different, so it falls 
to mouse manufacturers to create pointing 
devices shaped in such a way that they 
will suit as many demented digit designs 
as possible. Most opt for thumb-friendly 
mouse molds that slot into the right hand. 
Some, however, are aware that the world 
is not made entirely of righties, and while 
we’re unlikely to see many manufacturers 
catering solely to the worldwide left-
handed 10 percent, there is such a thing as 
a mouse for every hand.
And so we have the Sensei 310, far from 
the first both-ways pointer ever released, 
but directly marketed as an ambidextrous 
esports mouse. As you’d expect, it’s 
completely 
symmetrical, 
though 
this 
doesn’t really affect its feel appeal in either 
hand. The two main buttons, each equipped 
with Omron mechanical switches, are split 
from the case itself, rather than being part 
of the overall lid structure, with a slight 
ridge to provide a tactile buffer between 
them and the notched, rubberized scroll 
wheel. Each edge carries a pair of thumb 
buttons above a grippy silicon pad, and 
there’s a DPI switcher behind the wheel—
it’s all fairly standard design, although

bring a bundle of super-high-end mouse 
tech to as many hands as possible. The 
core of this package is SteelSeries’s 
TrueMove 3 sensor, which promises true 
one-to-one tracking. This means there’s 
no smoothing, snapping, or acceleration 
added to your movements to compensate 
for lag, and what you move is what you get. 
The counts-per-inch level you’re using is 
precisely what the mouse sends to your 
PC, and you can set this anywhere from 
100 to 12,000 cpi in 100 cpi increments, 
with a nominal 1ms polling rate.
Armed services
Whatever settings you choose are stored in 
the mouse itself, which also sports its own 
32-bit ARM processor, presumably to keep 
tabs on that ultra-accurate sensor. The 
storage extends to the lighting, picking out 
the wheel and palm logo with SteelSeries’s 
excellent 
synchronized 
RGB 
system. 
SteelSeries Engine drivers are required 
for initial configuration, but not once 
you’re all set up, so you can cart the Sensei 
wherever the gaming urge takes you.
In practice, and certainly in terms 
of desktop use, you may not notice the 
sensor’s skills. Honestly, we couldn’t tell 
the difference even through extensive use; 
while gaming mice have been great for a 
long time, a complete lack of acceleration 
does not, sadly, make this feel like a brand 
new horizon of pointing, though it does 
remove at least one source of blame if you 
lose an online firefight. The sensor itself 
is also part of a rather simple package, at 
least in comparison to many of its market 
rivals. There’s little lighting and not much 
to speak of in terms of buttons, as quality 
as the switches clearly are. But perhaps 
that’s the point.
This is a raw, unfussy, highly functional 
mouse. It’s not outrageously expensive 
by any means. It has a sensor that’s 
versatile enough to suit you, whatever 
your preferences, a shape that will work 
for your peculiar hands, buttons that feel 
great, and lighting that you can configure to 
your liking. The Sensei 310 really has been 
built for every set of fingers out there. And, 
hey, if you’re picky and like a more molded 
feel, SteelSeries’s Rival 310 is the same 
package mashed into a curvy right-handed 
configuration instead. –alex Cox

Wireless 
keyboards and mechanical 
switches don’t go together. Or, at least, 
they haven’t before. There are plenty of 
sensible reasons for the divide between 
the two technologies, primary of which 
is the usual proximity between keyboard 
and PC. Why tack on the extra cost of 
a wireless interface when the average 
mech-user is more interested in a flashy, 
ostentatious, loud experience, one they’ll 
be having at their desk? Why add input 
lag when the key market for mechanical 
keyboards is gamers, a group that 
demands instantaneous response from 
its peripherals?
Logitech has not put out this high-
profile wireless release without a few 
answers to those questions, the first of 
which is to strip back the experience as far 
as possible. For many potential users, we 
expect the lack of modern conveniences 
will be a blissful relief from the gimmick-
heavy keyboard market of 2017. There’s no 
battery-sucking RGB, or any lighting at all 
beyond the occasional connection LED and 
indicators for Caps Lock and the level of its 
AA batteries. There’s no pass-through of 
any kind, presumably because firing audio 
through it would likely ruin the wireless 
response time. There’s no harsh angles, 
unusually-molded keys, or chrome-plastic 
effigies to some alien god. 
What is there is as functional as it is 
aesthetically mute. A black and gray color 
scheme with the merest hint of blue, a 
set of comfortably shaped and clearly 
labeled (though not double-shot) keys, and 
Romer-G keyswitches, a co-development 
between Logitech and Omron, with a high 
actuation bump, and a satisfying soft feel.

with the experience of typing on them. 
They’re not as tooth-looseningly loud 
as many switches you’ll find, but that’s 
probably for the best.
Rest Room
Outside the main components, there’s an 
integrated wrist rest, non-detachable, 
which deepens the G613’s footprint, and 
means it’s a joy to use on an outstretched 
lap. There’s a string of six macro keys 
on the left edge, of which only two are 
realistically reachable with the pinkie of a 
game-positioned hand, which limits their 
immediate usefulness somewhat. There’s 
a set of clicky media microswitches, and a 
row of connection options—a Windows key-
blocking game mode toggle, and buttons to 
select between Bluetooth operation and 
Logitech’s LightSpeed interface.
About that, then. LightSpeed is some 
kind of proprietary wireless wizardry 
straight out of Logitech’s labs, and the thing 
that’s probably most remarkable about 
this keyboard. It drags down input lag to 
a claimed 1ms. We believe it, too: There’s 
not a shred of sluggishness about the 
G613, no dropped inputs, a great range. It 
drops to standby after a couple of minutes, 
yet wakes instantly on any keypress. On 
LightSpeed, it’s very easy to forget that 
you’re using a wireless keyboard at all. 
This does bring us back to our original 
point, though. While its gray button-
down staidness does have a certain 
retro-classic appeal, and Logitech has 
clearly taken a little inspiration from the 
enthusiast market in terms of the old-
school key labels, we can’t help but feel 
that the wireless functionality means you 
lose a lot that a cable might otherwise 
make trivial. The addition of Bluetooth is 
a nice touch, particularly as it means you 
can hook the G613 to a second device and 
quickly switch to it, but it’s not enough to 
make this essential.
Judged by its merits alone, Logitech’s 
G613 is an excellent keyboard, and 
LightSpeed is a tremendous wireless 
technology, but we wouldn’t consider

“Welcome to the cult of RazeR,” says an 
embossed line of text inside the Tiamat’s 
immaculately presented box, bringing 
to mind a certain other tech company 
with a knack for presentation. As with its 
stablemates in the current Razer lineup, 
every effort is made to make this headset 
feel luxurious, starting with the spot UV 
printed packaging, and going right through 
to the generous memory foam earpads. On 
those grounds, it can’t be faulted. 
An 
aluminum 
headband 
over 
a 
memory foam contact pad gives the cans 
a comfortable fit, without the need for 
squeaky retractable parts. Indeed, there’s 
very little noise from this model when 
you adjust it in any direction—moving the 
mic to purpose, rotating the earcups, and 
shifting the fit while on your head are all 
silent operations. A reasonably light 14.6oz 
overall weight and those aforementioned 
foam pads make it comfortable to wear for 
long periods, although synthetic leather 
and closed cups being what they are, it 
does get hot around the ears after a while.

The headline act on this revamped 
Tiamat 2.2’s spec sheet, however, is the 
introduction of two 50mm drivers inside 
each earcup. At the base of the right cup is a 
toggle switch, which gives you the power to 
activate all four drivers, or go with the more 
standard two. If your internal gimmick 
alarm’s going off at the very mention of 
this, we feel that. But to Razer’s credit, the 
effect of having all four drivers activated 
is a well-balanced and warm overall tone. 
Bass-heavy, yes, but not to the extent that 
it muddies the mid-range frequencies, and 
streets ahead of the “no such thing as too 
much bass” school of gaming headsets, 
circa 2012. The impedance of each second 
driver is half that of the primary driver, so

than two? Razer runs

it simply offers more punch when listening 
to music, or a more cinematic sound to 
games, if that’s your thing. We always 
prefer as close to a totally flat frequency 
response as possible in a headset—yes, 
that is like saying we prefer black filter 
coffee to espressos because you can 
really taste the beans. Pretentious or not, 
flat’s our thing, yet we did find ourselves 
reaching for the toggle switch to get a bass 
fix several times during Divinity: Original 
Sin 2 sessions and PUBG matches. So, 
while it might seem a little gimmicky, it’s 
actually a great call on Razer’s part to put 
this choice in your hands. 
Let’s go into the overall sound with just 
two drivers activated before we raise the 
Tiamat 2.2 V2 on our shoulders and start 
singing it songs, though. While it is a flatter 
and clearer sound than in four-driver 
mode, it lacks a bit of mid and high clarity 
(“sparkle,” if we’re being filter coffee-
drinking posers) that you might hear in 
Sennheiser’s higher end models, although 
at $130, it’s not really going up against 
the GAME ZERO et al. Instead, it’s in the 
trenches with Kingston’s HyperX Cloud 
Revolver and SteelSeries’s Arctis, both of 
which host impressive audio quality. The 
mic, set on a malleable hinge arm, is good 
quality, too, picking up voices without the 
mechanical keyboard taps beneath them.
There’s a big “but,” sadly, and unlike 
Sir Mix-A-Lot, we don’t like those. The 
4ft cable might just about be considered 
“braided,” but it’s noticeably thin and 
fragile-looking. The same’s true of its 
additional 2ft splitter cable, and right out of 
the box we had connection problems with 
the audio jack. In fact, it took significant 
cable-wiggling to even produce a sound, 
and in the end we had to resort to taking 
the extension cable out of the equation. It’s 
a shame to see this otherwise competitive 
headset hobbled by a flimsy cable, 
because the addition of four drivers—and, 
importantly, user control over them—is 
really enticing. –PhIl IWaNIuK

Every sin here has been done before, we guarantee
Divinity: Original Sin 2
The isomeTric rPG has been a mainstay 
of PC gaming since the ’90s, and feels 
most at home here, thanks to the high-
res screens and mouse input that, until 
recently, consoles couldn’t match.
Original Sin 2 is a sequel to the prequel 
to the Divine Divinity series, thus tracing its 
lineage back to 2002 and some awful cover 
art. Today, thanks to Kickstarter’s largesse, 
we have a huge game, oozing the kind of 
polish we could only imagine in the early 
’00s, yet some things feel very familiar.
Take the immediate beginning. You wake 
up on a table, and a huge bell marked 
“Planescape: Torment” begins to ring. As it 
turns out, you’re not immortal, merely quite 
easily resurrected, but the rest is up to 
you. Or not, as Larian Studios has included 
several ready-baked characters for you to 
pick from in the character creator. You can 
still roll your own, but choosing one of the 
ready-made avatars means you’re treated 
to a full origin story and additional options 
in dialogue. Of which there’s rather a lot. 
The backstories are rich, and the 
dialogue 
options 
often 
helpful 
and 
frequently amusing. The pre-cooked also 
bring a sense of playing a role in the world, 
rather than just being yourself, as many 
RPG characters end up. If we can overcome

lighting and particle effects.

very charismatic, is one of the game’s 
weaker aspects, making it all too easy to 
get bunched up under an area-of-effect 
spell. The limited action points per turn are 
to blame for this, despite being a perfectly 
good system for turn-based brawling, as 
you’re more likely to want to use them for 
attacks rather than movement. Again, you 
must play a role—that of someone who 
wants to get out of this alive, rather than 
someone who wants to see particle effects.
Built on top of the Enhanced Edition of 
the previous game, and benefiting from 
everything Larian learned while enhancing 
it, Original Sin 2 is a highly polished RPG. It 
can take a long time to get into, the zoom 
level never seems to go wide enough, and 
the completely manual camera can hide 
things from you, but this detailed world is 
aching to be explored. –ian evenden
our natural instincts and offer a kind word 
to a pauper, or maybe flirt with a kitchen 
maid, because that’s what your lusty sea-
dog of a character would do, rather than 
hiding behind our natural shyness, we’re in 
a realm of role-playing streets away from 
considering “what would I do?”
Every line is voiced, including those of 
the narrator, so there’s a lot to sit back 
and listen to. It’s perhaps not a game for 
quick-fix playing, because it’s all too easy 
to sink hours into it, but it rewards this time 
investment with interesting characters and 
the kind of depth we rarely see. Everyone 
(including animals with the right ability) can 
be spoken to, even if they simply tell you to 
go away, traded with, or murdered. Killing 
a quest-specific character may close off 
that avenue to progress, but there are so 
many ways to do anything, you’re hardly 
ever faced with having to reload in order to 
un-break your campaign. 
The plot, involving powerful magic (which 
you can’t use at the beginning, thanks to a 
damping collar that needs to be removed), 
revenge, and the ascendancy to godhood, 
starts slowly, with a cleverly masked 
tutorial section laying out the turn-based 
combat and elemental magic system. The

Every night’s alright for fighting
Absolver
When is an MMOG not an MMOG? When 
it’s M, and O, and a G, but not M (that’s the 
first M, by the way, the one that means 
“massively”). Absolver would be better 
described as a GMOG—a gently multiplayer 
online game. With only a few “real” players 
in the same space as you at one time, and 
the ability to turn even this off, it’s a novel 
way of handling PvP encounters, turning 
them into one-on-one duels.
Absolver is a martial arts fighting game, 
set in a small open world, and illustrated in 
one of the best, most successful graphical 
styles we’ve seen in a while. Creamy, 
watercolor-like washes and painterly trees 
mix with some chunky ruined architecture 
and a lovely softening effect into the 
distance. It’s a look that will probably age 
well, so it’s a shame that it’s coupled to 
a game that, based on its current early 
showing, might not.
It’s in the very nature of online games 
that they are patched and expanded, of 
course, but at the time of writing, Absolver 
has you skilling up your character by 
beating up newbies, in order to take out 
a number of sub-bosses and a big bad. 
There’s a high-level end game, involving 
combat schools and the training of others, 
but Absolver is crying out for some large 
alt-moves, and flying fists. New styles, 
such as drunken boxing or those involving 
weapons, can be learned, changing the way 
you fight. Of course, forget the controls 
or get confused, and it becomes a button-
mashing hell, and while it may be possible 
to win low-level fights in this way, you won’t 
last for long without a little practice.
Absolver is deep and beautiful, capable 
of holding you in its clutches for the time it 
takes to defeat the biggest baddies. After 
that, there’s nowhere to go, and there’s not 
enough meat in the end-game to hold your 
attention for much longer. An expanded 
world would do the game so much good. 
Let’s hope it’s going to get one. –ian evenden
injections of content. We want new things to 
hit—and lots of them.
Combat is the heart of the game, and 
while you start with a range of kicks and 
punches, the only way to get new moves 
is to get beaten up by them, and learn 
the blows as they crunch against your 
skull, literally beating some sense into 
you. However, the only way to cement this 
knowledge into a move that can be added 
to your combat deck is to win the fight. This 
turns fights against those with complex 
moves into battles of attrition, as you fight, 
lose, respawn, and return to fight again. 
Playing with a full deck?
The combat deck is where the great depths 
of the game’s combat system can be found; 
a list of attacks your character can use, 
which you can shuffle into combos. Attacks 
require stances, of which there are four, and 
some are exclusive to a particular stance. 
Switching stance also changes the direction 
from which you approach an enemy, so it’s 
possible to cut around someone’s guard 
by approaching from front-left, feinting, 
switching stance, and slamming a fist into 
the other side of their head. 
Done well, it’s a rather lovely ballet 
of violence, all sweeping kicks, flaming

Some vistas are really 
worth pausing for.
Two- or three-on-one 
brawls are common.
You’re given a mask at the 
start, but can find others.

Jarred Walton, Senior editor
2017 is the year of the CPU—I can’t recall 
a year when new product launches were 
so frequent. And these aren’t meaningless 
100MHz bumps in performance either, as 
both AMD and Intel have been on a roll.
To recap, Intel kicked off 2017 with 
the initial Kaby Lake desktop launch in 
January. AMD followed with its first major 
architectural overhaul in more than five 
years, with a staggered rollout of its Ryzen 
7, 5, and 3 processors, and finally the 
beastly Threadripper. Intel also released 
its Skylake-X 6–10-core models and Kaby 
Lake-X processors, and later the 12–18-core 
parts, topping out with the Core i9-7980XE. 
And wrapping things up, Intel’s Coffee Lake 
brings 6 cores/12 threads to its mainstream 
platform with new 300-series chipsets.
That’s at least five major launches, 
complete with new chipsets, in 2017. By 
comparison, in 2016, Intel’s Broadwell-E 
was the only fully new line of processors, 
and Intel was again the primary name in the 
processor space in 2015, with the launch 
of Skylake and LGA1151. AMD’s Godavari 
refresh was unfortunately still slower than 
the FX-series Piledriver chips it launched 
in 2012.
If your primary interest is PC gaming, 
many 
older 
CPUs 
remain 
perfectly 
acceptable solutions, but if you’re running 
CPU-intensive workloads, the deluge of 
new processors breathes new life into what 
has been a stagnating market. Intel claims 
top bragging rights in the consumer CPU 
rankings with the i9-7980XE and the i9-
7960X, but at half the price, Threadripper is 
impressive in its own right.
In short, right now, it’s a fantastic time 
to be a PC enthusiast. Everyone from 
the bargain hunters to the well-funded 
enthusiasts has something to consider. 
And if you’re already rocking a perfectly 
capable processor in your machine, there 
are still plenty of other ways in which you 
can upgrade your system. Let’s just hope 
that 2018 can keep up the pace!
That was the year that was—the past 12 months in processors

two screens enable me to

back to one screen for 8K?

i’ve wanted to talk aboUt this little 
gadget of mine for two whole years 
(our executive editor wouldn’t let me, 
because he thinks it’s ridiculous). It is, 
by far, the most useful thing I’ve ever 
purchased when it comes to my work for 
Maximum PC. So, what is it? Something 
typically associated with other more 
arduous 
mechanical 
pursuits 
and 
hobbies than PC building—it is, in short, 
a magnetic bowl.
Now, I know what you’re thinking: 
“What the hell?” But just hear me out. 
When it comes to building, upgrading, 
or tweaking systems, it’s generally 
advisable to use some sort of container 
to store all the nuts, bolts, and screws 
you’re using for the job, so you don’t lose 
them, rather than just littering them all 
over your workbench. A magnetic bowl 
goes one better, by additionally securing 
every metal component you throw into it 
via the power of magnets, ensuring you’ll 
never lose them.
It’s also pretty neat because you can 
attach the bowl itself to anything metal 
as well without worry, including cases, 
shelving units, refrigerators—you name 
it. It’s simply a metal bowl, with a giant 
magnet attached to the bottom of it, 
surrounded by a rubber, err, surround— 
and that’s all there is to it.
Additional magnetic magic includes its 
ability to magnetize tools. For instance, 
take a non-magnetic screwdriver, move 
it back and forth on the base of the bowl, 
and it becomes magnetic. Handy. –Zs

There’s 
hasn’t 
been 
much in the way of 
mouse 
tech 
that’s 
gotten me excited in a 
while. Sure, DPI sensor 
numbers are hitting astrological levels, but 
for FPS precision, I tend to keep everything 
more reasonable. Luckily, sensors aren’t 
the only place mice can improve themselves.
Lately, I’ve been playing with Razer’s 
new Basilisk gaming mouse. It has all the 
high-performance sensors and such you’d 
expect, but also comes with some nice bells 
and whistles specifically for FPS players. 
The marquee features include a scroll 
wheel with adjustable resistance and a 
DPI clutch that lets you swap to a second DPI 
setting on the fly—then go right back to your 
primary number. The clutch is a removable 
magnetic paddle, meaning you can swap it 
out for whatever size you like (or remove it 
altogether), and while its default behavior is 
a DPI clutch, you can change its functionality 
to whatever you choose.
Of course, on-the-fly DPI swapping and 
scroll-wheel resistance adjustments are 
nothing new, but it’s nice having all these 
FPS-focused features in one package. The 
Basilisk also uses Razer’s new Synapse 3 
software—I haven’t dug into it too deeply yet, 
but it seems to be a nice update to the utility.

We often wax lyrical

I’m

more 
interested in the gear that we use day to day. 
This G.Skill keyboard has been serving me 
well for nearly a year, and while the red key 
glow picks up some of the inevitable dust 
that it has collected over time, it still looks 
and acts like a premium piece of equipment. 
The keyboard is available with the usual 
gamut of Cherry key switches, but mine 
employs the Cherry MX Brown switches. 
These aren’t “clicky” like the blues, but 
require a bit more force than the reds. 
They’re a happy middle ground that work as 
well for gaming as they do for typing, which 
is good, because that’s exactly what I use my 
machine for: lots of work and plenty of play.
There are numerous features on offer, 
though I don’t tend to use many of them on a 
regular basis. The lighting is set to a barely 
perceptible glow (no RGB lighting here, 
just “crimson” red), the macro recording 
has hardly been used, and the custom 
gaming keycaps survived a day before being 
swapped back for the standard caps. The 
media keys and volume control are much 
more welcome, though, and the general 
comfort means I’m not in a rush to replace it.

Windows Backup
There was much good 
advice in your “Reinstalling 
Windows” feature, but I 
differ on the idea of doing a 
disk image. When I upgrade 
or reinstall, I take the 
occasion to replace the hard 
drive/SSD with a newer or 
bigger model. The old drive 
becomes my safety net. If 
the reinstall or upgrade goes 
awry, I simply put the old 
drive back and can get work 
done. It’s also there in case 
I missed transferring a file I 
need later. Alternatively, I 
can reformat the old drive 
and use it for data backup 
once I'm sure the new install 
works. 
–Rick Thompson
ExEcutivE Editor AlAn 
dExtEr rEsponds: I do the 
same, which explains why 
I’ve got piles of old hard 
drives sitting around (I 
rarely make it to the final 
stage). Such a routine 
doesn’t protect you if your 
new drive crashes—any 
work on there is gone for 
good—but it does mean you 
can have a transition period. 
Minecraft on Pi

1.12.2, with most people 
in my opinion scattered 
between 1.7.10, or 1.10-plus. 
Why would you recommend 
installing a less popular 
version that is no longer 
supported or updated? 
Is there something I’m 
missing, or was that a copy/
paste from an older article? 
Thank you for many years of 
great articles and hardware 
reviews.

ExEcutivE Editor AlAn 
dExtEr rEsponds: I’ve just 
looked through the article, 
and can’t spot a reference 
to installing an outdated 
version of Java. The closest 
thing was where we talked 
about installing SpigotMC, 
where we suggested 
installing version 1.11.2, 
because that was the most 
recent version at the time 
of writing, although we did 
state that you should install 
the latest version (which is 
indeed 1.12.2). Regardless, 
we always recommend that 
you run the latest version 
of all software, unless we 
specifically state a version 
for a particular feature.

I’ve been reading your July

“Bottleneck Highlight.” For 
a long time, I wondered the 
exact same thing. How would 
you pair a CPU and GPU 
without physically having the 
parts on hand? The solution 
is http://thebottlenecker.
com. I recently wanted to 
upgrade my old Core i7-870 
and GeForce GTX 650 Ti, but 
did not know what would be 
the best GPU for it. Being 
as old as it is, I didn’t want 
to overdo it, particularly in 
price. Then I found this site, 
and paired my CPU with a 
GeForce GTX 1060 3GB. Now, 
even this old dog of an 870 
can run Doom on medium 
settings, and my GF is happy 
we can play more games 
together, having something 
a lot better than her ever-
aging non-gaming laptop.

dExtEr rEsponds: That’s 
a nice find, because it isn’t 
a website we’ve visited 
before. The advice you get 
when entering your system 
details is fairly broad, and 
the problem still remains 
that some application-
specific bottlenecks won’t 
be picked up, but it’s a good 
enough guide to help you 
spot whether your graphics 
card or your processor is 
holding you back. Some of 
the recommendations seem 
a bit off, though: If you enter 
the details of your upgraded 
system, it rightly highlights 
that your CPU is now holding 
you back, but then goes on 
to recommend upgrading 
to a Xeon E3-1270 V2—a 
workstation chip is a little 
overkill for a spot of light 
gaming in our books. Still, 
it’s a good place to start.

always really liked working 
with the vector art in Corel, 
and it’s gotten me thinking: 
Why doesn’t Microsoft 
migrate the Windows 
desktop to a vector-based 
layout? Obviously, years 
ago, the computational 
power required for such 
a thing would have been 
impractical. Today, we 
have more than enough 
horsepower in even 
the most modest new 
systems to support a full 
vector desktop. It would 
eliminate most of the 
scaling problems that 
plague Windows, and raster 
images could be layered 
over the top to maintain 
backward compatibility. 
Plus, you would no longer 
need multiple copies of 
icons and fonts at different 
resolutions. I can’t see a 
downside, other than the 
work involved in rewriting so 
much of Windows code. I was 
wondering if you had any 
opinions, and whether you 
could maybe even see what 
Microsoft had to say.

dExtEr rEsponds: This isn’t 
an awful idea by any means,

that modern operating 
systems already have a lot 
of scalable elements baked 
in, although vector-based 
icons don’t seem to have 
taken off. There’s a couple 
of reasons why this last 
step hasn’t been taken: one 
is that creating icons and 
interfaces would suddenly 
become a whole lot trickier; 
another is that a lot of what 
we do deals with raster 
images (movies, websites, 
documents, photography). 
There’s also the fact that it 
isn’t really perceived as a 
problem. Raster graphics 
may not be the most 
efficient way of building 
a scalable UI, but they’ve 
got us where we are today 
(with our sometimes clunky 
interfaces, font issues, and 
multiple-resolution icons).
Subjective Objectivity
I’ve written this so many 
times, and always stopped 
short of sending. I don’t 
want to be ripped apart in 
your magazine. Then, in 
the October issue, I read 
the “Security Concerns” 
letter (Mark Van Noy), and 
two things hit home. First, 
Mark’s comment regarding 
opinion and news. Then, I 
read that Linux users tend 
to be more clued up about 
vulnerability than Windows 
users. That’s absolutely 
opinion, not fact, and false, 
in my opinion. In one broad 
stroke, Windows users are 
less educated. That really 
bothered me. The letter 
I deleted over and over 
dealt with a similar issue, 
different companies: Intel 
and AMD. Editorials and 
opinion pieces aside, even 
in news and reviews, the 
bias is staggering. I love 
the magazine, but enjoy the 
escape from our everyday 
climate of “better” when I 
read about new tech. Just 
my opinion.  
 –Anonymous
ExEcutivE Editor AlAn 
dExtEr rEsponds: We don’t 
rip our readers apart, that 
would be foolish, and far 
too messy. Besides, you’re 
absolutely right: When I 
responded to Mark’s letter, 
I was, indeed, voicing my 
opinion. I’m sure you could 
find someone who’s running 
a version of Linux who has 
no idea what they are doing 
(or, in fact, any operating 
system), but I still think it 
would be much easier to 
find a Windows user who is 
truly clueless. We share a 
room with the company’s IT 
department, and the team 
assures me such a task 
would take seconds.
Essentially, not everyone 
is as knowledgeable about 
their PCs as we are. And 
it’s nothing to do with 
being less-educated, 
more the fact that lots of 
Windows users are not 
interested in the systems 
they use. According to 
NetMarketshare, the various 
versions of Windows account 
for over 90 percent of the 
market, with Apple’s OSes 
at just under 6 percent, and 
Linux just over 3 percent. 
Statistically, there are 
simply more clueless people 
using Windows.
As for bias, we can 
and do add opinion where 
we think it’s needed, but 
we’re not biased. When 
it comes to reviews and 
recommendations, we pride 
ourselves on being objective 
(well, as much as anyone 
truly can be, although that’s 
a different conversation). 
Opinions are important; they 
give the world color. We 
could have a magazine that 
has no commentary at all, 
but it would be so bland that 
no one would want to read it, 
or write for it.
Money for Nothing
As a long-time subscriber, 
I wanted to express my 
gratitude for the ongoing 
coverage of cryptocurrency. 
I am not sure if many other 
readers keep older parts 
around, as I do, and it seems 
like no time has been better 
than now to put some of that 
unused equipment to use 
mining some (virtual) coins.
 
–Hans Huang
ExEcutivE Editor AlAn 
dExtEr rEsponds: We have 
covered cryptocurrencies  
in the past, and some of  
us have mined (and lost) 
coins over the years, too. 
Given that there’s  
something of a renewed 
interest in the subject at  
the moment, we will keep  
an eye on it, but we find 
it hard to recommend 
seriously investing in it, 
because it’s so volatile. 
Using your old hardware 
for the job isn’t a bad idea, 
although such parts are 
lacking in terms of modern 
hash rates.

How to stability test 
your computer
So, you’ve just spent the majority of your weekend tweaking 
voltages, multipliers, and the BCLK. You’ve gone through 
several blue screens, BIOS resets, and have finally managed 
to get into Windows—so far so good, no crashes, no stuttering.
As much as you may want to celebrate, you’re going to have 
to resist the urge, because there is much to do before you can 
brag about that 2fps advantage you’ve just obtained. To be 
sure that your system is stable, you need to push it to the limit.
There are many programs that simulate a workload; most 
of them work equally well, but we prefer Intel’s XTU. If you 
have an AMD CPU, you need to use another program; AMD’s 
own OverDrive is a good place to start.

We’ll probably sWap over to the eighth-gen Intel Core i5 for our mid-
range build next issue, but we haven’t seen enough new motherboards 
to make the call yet, so we’ll stick with our Ryzen 5 1600 build for now. 
In fact, there’s nothing different about this build from last issue, bar 
a few price shifts (in the usual places). If there’s nothing wrong with 
a build, though, there’s no need to change it. It looks as though the 
Etherium effect is definitely behind us now, as we saw the GeForce 
GTX 1070 drop again, down to $400, which is only $20 more than it was 
before this mining nonsense started. The big price hit this month was 
on the memory—the G.Skill TridentZ saw a $25 price increase, and 
once again there were no alternatives to reach for instead. Finally, 
we saw the M.2 drive increase by $7. So, despite the saving on the 
graphics card, overall the system rolls in $17 more than last issue.
There isn’T much in The Way of changes this month, as our budget 
system sees a couple of price hikes, but little in the way of options to 
see us switching out for cheaper components. The one area where we 
did see a better deal is on the graphics card front, where our previous 
selection of the Gigabyte GTX 1050 Ti saw a $10 price increase, 
prompting us to move over to MSI for the same GPU. We also saw a 
price increase on the Enthoo Evolv ITX, but we’re so sold on this case 
at the moment, that we just absorbed the $5 hike. The story of DDR4 
pricing continues to frustrate, with the Patriot Viper Elites seeing an 
$11 increase in just a month. Unfortunately, we couldn’t find anything 
cheaper, so ultimately had to accept that increase as well. Overall, 
we’re looking at a total price increase of $16 compared to last month, 
for the exact same performance.

turBo
The graphics card market has had to weather storms before, 
but the last cryptocurrency crisis lasted longer than any of 
us were happy with. Even so, it looks like the pricing on our 
favorite cards is just about returning to normal. To that end, 
if you’ve been putting off either building a system or finishing 
off the one you’ve been piecing together, now is a good time to 
complete that task. The budget and mainstream cards were 
most affected, so it’s good to see these return to price points 
that actually make sense for the performance that they deliver. 
$150, www.msi.com 
our Turbo build is designed for those who need a seriously kick-ass 
system. It costs a fair chunk of cash, but you know you’ll be rocking 
a monumental machine if you put one together. And this certainly is 
a system to behold—your own dream machine for a lot less than we 
spend each year to push the limits of system building. We’re mindful 
of the final system price, in other words, and we always challenge any 
price increase in the same way that we do with the budget and mid-
range machines. 
This goes some way to explaining why it was so frustrating this 
month to discover that the G.Skill TridentZ DDR4 3200 RAM we use 
has seen a hefty price increase. We’ve seen price bumps in every build 
this month, but the extra $60 is not easy to swallow. The problem is, 
as we’ve seen with the other machines, that there aren’t any serious 
alternatives worth considering. We could have saved a few dollars 
(we’re talking about $9) to go for a less common brand, but with no 
guarantees that it would work with Threadrippper, we decided to stay 
with the sticks that we do know work. There are alternative routes we 
could have gone down—dropping to 4x 4GB sticks or even 2x 8GB—but 
neither fulfilled the first part of the Turbo mantra about producing a 
kick-ass machine.
There’s little play in the pricing elsewhere, at least, and in fact we 
even saw a couple of small savings on the storage front: $4 on the 
512GB Samsung 960 Pro, and a whole buck on the 4TB WD Black. The 
end result is still very much a kick-ass machine, it’s just one that will 
cost you $55 more than it would have done a month ago.
