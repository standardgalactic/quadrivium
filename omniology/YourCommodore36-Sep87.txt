OOPS!
We would like to point out a technical
inaccuracy in the Metrocross review
in our August 1987 issue. The game
legend of Kagc was incorrectly quoted
as being published by US Gold. The

We would also like to take this

package from two points of view; that of the experienced
player and also from someone who is just learning how to
play the game.

The game comes in two parts. There is a mini-tutorial of
ten example hands designed to illustrate various aspects of
playing bridge. The trouble with these is that they are poorly
chosen and are not really suitable for beginners. The on-
screen analysis looks messy; layout could have been
improved 100% and the odd spelling mistake and bug that
crashes the program doesn't help matters either.
The main program is the one that lets you get down to
actually playing some hands. You always play the south
hand unless south happens to be dummy, in which case you
play north. There are a whole host offeatures available to
you which include rebidding or replaying a hand. having

cards recommended to you and inputting your own hands.
Onscreen presentation is reasonable although a joystick
option would have been nice — moving the cursor over the
desired card or bid.
All these options are cosmetic though and my non-
beginner is going to want to know how well the game plays.
The answer is not very well I'm afraid, either in bidding or
card play. This is nothing particular to Colossus Bridge, but
to all bridge programmes so far released. Bridge. unlike
chess, does not lend itself to computer analysis.
is the program worth buying then? A guarded yes if you
are constantly short of people to play with. Don't expect it to
do wonders for your game though. Now let's hear what Vow-
Conunodore's resident beginner made of it all. G . H .
COLOSSUS BRIDGE — The Beginner's Tale
was quite pleased to see that a Bridge program had turned
up in Your Commodore's ofﬁce. I've only just started
learning the game in the past month or so, can't play for
toffee, and a computerised tutorial is just, what I need.
Unlike chess, bridge is, a pre-eminently social affair —
you need four for a game and it helps to be on speaking terms
with your partner. A computerised opponent avoids all the
embarrassment of playing with people vastly better than
you, and human players won't let you bow out gracefully
before the end.
Sadly, my hopes were mostly to be dashed. I'd much
rather spend my time with a book than try to hack through
Colossus's Bridge Tutorial. I feel that the analysis screens
could be useful, being written by various experienced
players, but they're almost unreadable, and the program
only provides ten specimen games anyway, so it's hardly
worth even starting. As for the game screens, the less said the
better.
The actual Bridge playing part of the program looks even

tackier, but this has a lot more going for it. I don't see how it
would interest a good player, but for someone like myself,
who is struggling to make obvious tricks, it's a challenge at
times. It can't be too clever though, because I can beat it most
of the time. I also like the range of options the game offers,
such as replaying the hand, playing it open or playing only
hands with a 'balanced shape'.
There isn't much excuse for the prinlitive look of this
program, nevertheless I felt I learnt the odd thing or two, if
only how to score: so it can't be all bad.

computer novels from the Swedish software company with
the somewhat curious name of American Action.
The format o f the game is that of a multiple choice
graphic adventure, and as such, should appeal mostly to
younger players.
You play the part of D'Artagnan, the fourth Musketeer
and you're entrusted with carrying out a secret mission for
the Queen involving the theft of some diamonds. Behind the
plot is the evil Cardinal Richlelieu who wants to expose the
Queen's love affair with the Duke of Buckingham.
The story starts in the streets of Paris where you must
Find three erstwhile colleagues, Portos, Athos and Aramis
and persuade them that there are more important things in
life than wine, women and song. You must also secure passes
to let the three of you out of the city gates before heading off
towards England.

Movement in the game is controlled via the four function
keys. Onscreen prompts inform you if there is more text to be
read or a choice to be made. Most of the time, the correct
option is fairly easy to guess but even if you get it wrong, the
ﬁrst section is small enough for you to try all the available
options without taking too much time over it. You are
allowed one RAMsave per section but annoyingly, there is
no permanent save facility so that if you make a mistake in
the later sections, the whole game has to be started from
scratch.
Onscreen presentation is good with some attractive
illustrations and a redeﬁned character set. My own feeling
though is that there is not enough meat in this game to keep
seasoned adventurers happy for very long.

software world. After sinking our teeth into Bram Stoker's
Dracula, we are now invited to sample the Mary Shelley
monster hit, Frankenstein.
Strip away the gory digitised graphics and what have we
got? A trio of short adventures based on the book. In the ﬁrst
two parts you assume the role of Frankenstein in his search
for the monster. Starting at your father's house you progress
through to the meeting with the old blind man and the
showdown with the monster. Part three is the monster's tale.
The parser leaves a little to be desired. giving weird
responses to some of the requested actions. For example, I
discovered a picture of Frankenstein's parents and suggested
that it should be burned. The computer claimed to have done
this but when I checked the inventory, the picture was still
there.
The response time is a little slow too and because the
input buffer appears to be one character long, there is no
opportunity to type ahead through locations you have
visited before.
Dying happens too often for my liking. Like some of the
Level 9 adventures, the sands of time are running out from
the beginning of the game. You only have a few moves to
vacate the bedroom in your fathers house before the roof
comes crashing down in a storm. When you do get out, you
ﬁnd yourself trapped in the living room with no obvious way
out. The solution is not obvious and eventually I ran out of
things to examine. In despair I sat down and paused for
thought. Immediately Frankenstein's father entered, opened
the door and disappeared back to his room.

After this  y ou have t o  negotiate that much loved
invention of adventure writers — the maze. With a bear hot
on your trail it takes several deaths before you ﬁnd your way
through.
As you can see this is not an easy adventure to get on
with. The only way to progress is to save the game regular! N•
and be prepared for anything.
The graphics are bordering on video nasty level. I'm
surprised that CR L got away with a 15 and over age limit and
not a maximum I. certiﬁcate. Severed heads, blood and guts
festoon the screen for disk users.
As a sequel to Dracula, this game lacks the atmosphere
of evil and is more sick than successful in achieving its aim to
entertain.

TREASURE ISLAND
n years after the original trip to Treasure Island you're
T
e
on your way back with Long John Silver as a partner! This
seemed like a good idea when he told you that he'd found out
that the bulk of Flint's treasure was still buried there! Now
you're not so sure, after all that's happened, can you trust
h i m ?
As the game unfolds you realise that it wasn't a good idea
at all as vour main objective must be to survive and that isn't
going to be easy. Unlike other adventures in Treasure Island,
Jim Hawkins (that's you) must eat and drink regularly
otherwise you'll run out of energy and die leaving all the
booty to Long John Silver. I f  that wasn't enough you're
limited to what you can carry and must type in either RUN,
WALK, WADE or SWIM to move anywhere.
The daft thing is that if you happen to walk into water
you ﬂounder around and climb out exactly where you don't
want to be but if you wade you're OK. Why can't you walk
or run and then automatically wade if  you hit water and
swim i f  it's too deep? It might actually make the game
playable.

All this doesn't help a game that's desperately slow to
play, as each location is  represented by  painfully slow
graphics while the game clock races away at one hour, every

Rasterscan is a wreck and is drifting slowly towards the
nearest star. Your job as a small service robot is to repair the
ships systems and save yourself and the ship from a ﬁery
destruction.
M.S.B. (that's you) has also been damaged and since
your only  remaining program is how to repair toasters
you're in for an uphill struggle.
The game is in fact an adventure without any text and
features logic problems that must be solved using a joystick.
For example, the generator is down because a fuel pipe is
broken which you must locate and replace with a spare pipe
from the stores (once you've found them) but you must
hurry as the back-up batteries that are working now are
running Out. Once you've done that you have to ﬁx the
engines, ﬂip on the right combination of switches to turn on
the scanner and ﬁnally steer the ship to safety.
I found the game was  har d enough without the
uncontrolled movement of the M.S.B. slowing down the
action as it hurtles around the ship which ﬂips screens at an
alarming rate that's guaranteed to distract anyone. This is a
shame as there's a good game trying to get out_

mega game and you rush to your computer to try it, but it
doesn't LO AD. You try it on a friend's recorder and it
works! Try it on your own again and it still won't work.
Feeling disgruntled, you return it to a shop to be supplied
with a replacement that seems to have the same *fault'. What
can you do? You've wasted hours and you still can't play the
game. Buying a disk drive is one answer but Solihul based
'Load-it' have a cheaper solution.
When a computer program is recorded on a tape it is
stored in  a  thin band on a  relatively wide tape. Your
datassette then tries to read it but if the tape has run slightly
out o f  line during recording, your tape head will miss the
data track. The same will also happen if the tape is recorded
properly but the datasette's head is out of alignment. If this is
happening, then chances are you wron't be able to LO AD
anything.
The Solution
The answer is simply to adjust the head alignment screw
that's jus t above the R EWIN D  key on the datassette.
LOAD-IT appreciate that only a few people will have the
conﬁdence to do this and risk messing up the alignment thai
worked for all their other tapes. To get around this reticence
and make the whole process of head alignment a lot easier, a
modiﬁcation package has been produced that includes a
knob that when ﬁtted, can turn the head up to 180 degrees
and a piezo electric speaker so that you can hear the tape
load and adjust the knob to get the clearest signal.
Package to Suit You
The package comes in two formats and at two different
prices. F o r  E9.95 y ou get a  k it  w ith short but clear
instructions explaining how to ﬁt the knob in place of the
existing aligning screw. Solder the speakers' two connections
and cut a small slot in the datassettes case so that the knob
can move when the PLAY button is pressed and ﬁnally add a
small calibrated scale so you can note down the setting that

end to .frustrating loading problems.
works for each tape. I f  you don't think you could manage
this you can send off your datassette and LOAD-IT will do it
for you for 1'.19.95.
But Does it Work?
That's the theory, but does it work? To test it 1 tried to
LOAD a selection of tapes that included readers SU bmission
and game tapes that I 'knew' didn't LOAD. It worked! All
but one loaded and the exception was a tape that turned out
to be creased. Not even this can LO AD damaged tapes.
Using it couldn't be easier, as all you have to do is try to
LOAD the tape and adjust the knob until you get the clearest
signal_ I then wrote the setting on the cassette label for later
use and sat back to play the game, happy in the knowledge
that my loading problems were over.

 ur history is littered with tales of such heroes and
damsel-eating monsters just waiting to be slain. The Welsh
ﬂag features a dragon, the Irish talk of the little people and
the English patron Saint is best known for slaying a dragon.
And i f you ask any Scot what lurks bneneath the misty
waters of Loch Ness they'll reply *the monster!'
With such heritage it's understandable that within us all
there's a buckle waiting to be swashed and a hearty laugh to
be heard. So gather your swords and spells for we travel in
search of monsters, magic and treasure!
The search fo r  adventure will inevitably lead t o
adventure games, but it doesn't stop there as the computer
hero can ﬁght for fame and fortune (and his life) in a series of
role playing games. coin-op conversions, arcade games and
even some strategy games! Whatever your taste in games
you'll be able to taste adventure.
The adventure games were ﬁrst into the fray with the
classic Zork trilogy from the equally impressive Infocom.
Does anyone know a bad Infocom adventure? The quality of
the text descriptions, the puzzles that are set and the
packaging packed full of clues and red herrings is second to
none. Much has been said about Zork I, II. and III as well as
the sequel trilogy Enchanter, Sorcerer and the recent
Spellbreaker, and I'l l  just add that i f you enjoy good
adventures that really challenge you and you have never
played an Infocom, where have you been? Climb out of your
Outer Mongolian cave, get a disk drive and get adventuring.
Meanwhile back on this side of the pond, Melbourne
House were making the headlines with an adventure version
of Tolkien's Hobbit. Although the game attracted (justiﬁed)
rave reviews such as 'You can actually talk to the characters'
most of the headlines weren't about the game itself but about
the growing speculation about a followup game based on the
Lord of the Rings.
In 1985 the ﬁrst part of the trilogy appeared which was
followed recently by part two, The Shadows of Mordor. As
in part one the Shadows of Mordor are based on a book in
R E V I E W S
Fantasy
Games
I f  your ﬂights of Jan!l e a d  you to
imagine heroic quests for lost treasure or
battles with monsters and demons, then
stop thinking and start playing, as your
C64 can quench your thirst for adventure.
By Tony Hetherington
Tolkein's classic trilogy, this time The Twin Towers. It ﬁnds
our Hobbit heroes once again alone and in trouble_ as they
attempt to cross the desolute wastelands, survive the evil
mountains until ﬁnally they reach Sauron's homeland and
the third and ﬁnal part.
The Jewels o f Darkness is another classic adventure
trilogy and consists of three early, and for my money the
best, Level 9 adventures bundled together, improved and
repackaged b y Rainbird for E14.95. This treatment o f
Colossal, Adventure and Dungeon Adventures obviously
impressed the wizards of Level 9 as they are now adding the
ﬁnal touches to Knight Orc which promises to be even
better.
If you mention Rainbird you must also mention the
Pawn. Written by Magnetic Scrolls this superb adventure
has become the new standard by which others will be judged.
The Pawn isn't actually a fantasy game although there is a
wizard in it, but it is the prequel to The Guild Of Thieves
which is already a must for Amiga adventurers and due to
appear on the C64 in a few weeks.
The game revolves around your attempts to qualify as a
member o f  Reknaught's Raiders b y  becoming a n
accomplished thief. To test your mettle as well as your skill,
determination, puzzle solving and general thieving abilities,
you're given a test in which you are dropped on an island and
told not to come back until you've given a test in which you
are dropped on an island and told not to come back until
you've got all the booty. Some is easy to ﬁnd such as a chalice
that's sitting in plain view. Unfortunately it's also guarded
by an equally visible grizzly bear! Other problems aren't so
easy and half your time you're left wondering what's
important and what isn't.
Despite the ﬁendish problems and incredible text, there's
actually space left on the disk for some of the best adventure
graphics you are likely to see. Better than the Pawn. If you
don't believe me then track down a copy when it's released
and see for yourself.

Value for Money?
Adventures such as the Guild of Thieves and the Infocom
games are superb value for money but won't leave you much
change out o f Ea). Mastertronic's Spellbound offers an
ingenious plot, window menus and animation for only
£2.00! You star in the game as Magic Knight who has been
transported to the mythical castle of Kahn by a misﬁred spell
cast by your friend Gimbel the wizard while he was trying to
improve the ﬂavour of his rice pudding. Now you have to
solve the mysteries of the castle, it's objects and it's banshee
so you can return home, but only when you've discovered
DruKans Lair
how to get through a darkened room full of inﬂammable gas
and over an unclimbable wall.
Role Play Your Adventures
Fantasy gaming isn't just adventuring as role playing games
such as Dungeons and Dragons and Runequest have proved.
Software has tried to match the depth and excitement of
steering a party through these games with a succession of
games such as Ultima IV, The Shard of Spring, Phantasie I
and II. Master of Magic and The Bard's Tale.
The fantasy role playing adventures split into two
groups; those that show a party moving around a wilderness
and it's dungeons and castles, and those that show a 3D view
of the corridor or room that you're in. They both have one
R E V I E W S
thing in common, they take a long time to play, sometimes
over 100 hours!
'When the going gets tough, the bard goes drinking' is the
motto of Ariolasoft's (Electronic Arts) superb Bard's Tale.
The evil wizard Mangar has the town of Skara Brae in an icy
grip. Under an eternal winter spell nothing moves in comfort
except perhaps the monsters that control the streets of the
town and the dungeons that lie below them.
As soon as the brave bard has quaffed an ale and raised a
party of fellow adventurers he'll set off and tackle the 128
different monsters that populate the taverns, temples,
towners and turrents of the town and seek the 85 magic spells
and that they will use in the 16 levels of dungeons, All in 3D!

If you think the Bard's Tale sounds challenging then why not
try Alternate Reality. It also features 3D views of the city,
that you have been abducted and brought to as well as the
insides of Inns to eat drink and hear gossip. shops to buy
armour, weapons and supplies and even a bank to store your
booty.
Nothing too surprising there, but wait, this is alternate

R E V I E W S
The king of the wilderness roleplaying adventures is
undoubtably Ultima IV. The graphics may be primitive but
the atrirsphere is piled on thick. For example, instead of
rolling dice to decide your characteristics, a fortune teller
turns cards and asks you questions. Your answers form your
character. Then it's out into a massive world of cities and
dungeons and your quest to become the Avatar, the pinnacle
of bravery and virtue to lead the land of Britannia into a new
era.
Anyone who has played Exodus Ultima III will know
that this isn't going to be easy but will be amazed by the fact
the Ultima IV is sixteen times bigger than III! Thanks to
Microprose who has now set up a UK operation and a deal
with Origin (the Ultima authors) you will soon be able to
play Ultima I and II as well as the forthcoming Ultima V.
The Ultima series may be the best but they've got stiff
competition from games that are getting better and better.
SSI games Shard of Spring and Rings of Zilﬁn were covered
by the recent article Warlocks and Wargames and have now
been joined by two more. Wizard's Crown and Phantasie
In Wizard's Crown you mount an expedition of eight
characters to regain the stolen Crown of the Emperor. These
brave adventurers include sorcerers, priests, ﬁghters, rangers
and thieves that are deﬁned by an incredible number of
factors that include their ability to haggle, scan, picklocks
and swim.
The game itself features the most complicated and most
accurate combat system you will ﬁnd in a role playing game
giving each character and critter a bewildering number of
options every combat turns including a choice of offensive
and defensive spells.
Meanwhile the Dark Lord Nickadem us has fashioned an
evil orb to enslave the people of the beautiful island of
Fennorah. Undaunted by the task ahead you lead a party of
brave monks, priests, wizards rangers, thieves and ﬁghters
through the dark wilderness, dank dungeons and then onto
the Astral plane and the Netherworld as you tackle the quest
set in Phantasie II.
This is ofcourse the sequel to Pharnasie and you can even
use your surviving party from the original in this sequel.
Newcomers can raise a new band of adventurers but I'd
suggest they travelled through Phantasie before tackling this
quest. Coming soon. Phantasie III!
Economy Role Players
For computer role players with a  budget, who want
maximum value for money, they should look no further than
Mastertronic's Master of Magic. This marvellous program
was written by Richard Darling (who has gone on to form
Code Masters) and features the music of Rob Hubbard.
Using duck shoot menus to select your commands you
must cast your magic missile, ﬁreball, energy drain and
magical shield spells with care and collect any scrolls,
shields, armour and weapons you can ﬁnd from your slain
victims until you can complete your quest and retrieve the
amulet o f immortaility that is lost in the underground
caverns. Return this to the Wizard Thelric and escape from
the underworld.
Even the coin-op machines are spellbound by fantasy
gaming and in a growing number of coin-op conversions that
you can now get for your C64. The best known of these
conversions is of course Gauntlet which brings fast shoot
Finally, not even hard line strategists can escape as one of
the best strategy games of all time is a chess variant called
Archon (Electronic Arts). This is no ordinary chess game as
each piece is a mythical creature joined in battle as light
ﬁghts darkness, An army of unicorns, knights, archers and a
phoenix stand by the wizard against the dark forces o f
goblins, manticores basilisks and dragon's led by the evil
Sorceress. Each piece has it's own unique way of moving,
strengths and weaknesses that come into a play when one
piece tries to take another, as in Archon, if you want to take a
square you have to ﬁght for it in a seperate combat screen!

'em up action to a world full of grunts, ghosts, sorcerers,
death and lobbers. 512 levels of monsters, traps. treasure and
magical potions await our brave adventurers that can enter
on their own or with a friendly warrior, elf, wizard or
va lkerie.
Dragon's Lair was thought to be the coin-op machine
that couldn't be converted but the cynics were wrong, as
Software Projects produced the C64 versions of the video
disk screens in Dragon's Lair and Escape of Singe's castle.
Incredibly, the action is all there as the heroic Dirk the
Daring risks plummeting disks, rapids and whirlpools, mud
monsters. giant boulders and Singe the dragon himself' to
rescue the fair Princess Daphne.
Druid, Ranarama and Wizard form a trio of games that
show the variety of fantastic arcade games that you can get
for your C64. Druid was labelled a Gauntlet clone when it
was ﬁrst released, It wasn't long before players realised it
was a completely different game and worthy o f a Your
Commodore Game of the Month accolade. The combination
of Gauntlet style graphics, the need to  ﬁght o ff the
continuous onslaught of beetles, ghosts and critters while
ﬁnding fresh supplies of' spells and keys ensured a chart*
topping success for Firebird.
Wizard (Ariolasoft) added a new dimension to platform
games by casting you as a wizard who could gain spells from
collecting keys and use them against the screens critters to
complete each level.
Hewson's Ranarama gives you a tricky situation. You've
turned yourself into a frog as the warlocks invaded, and now
he must hop around an eight level dungon. ﬁght the
warlocks and gain their ruins to create better spells to repel
the invasion and return himself to his former glory. A nice
balance between arcade reactions and strategic planning are
required to complete this one.

Plus/4 Praise
Thank you for the support that you are
giving to the Plus /4 computer. May I
help t o  c lear  u p  s ome popular
misconceptions r e g a r d in g  t h i s
Cinderella machine?
Many readers may understandably
think that the Plus /4 is little more than
a deluxe C16, simply because C16
software is advertised 1
machines.
This association w it h  a  mor e
limited machine has been unfortunate
(or the Plus /4 which is blessed with a
full 60(71 bytes free (please excuse the
dig at the C64!). It also) possesses dual-
tasking capability, given the right
software.
Since the Plus/4 was reduced from
its original C300+, to around .C50. the
number o f  users h a s  increased
dramatically — I now have two, and
no, regrets!
The Plus/4 can use the 1551 drive
as well as the venerable 1541, but the
1551 has the advantage that it operates
in parallel and is therefore very fast.
They are also being sold at giveaway
prices — I paid C200 for two! Coupled
with t w o  ex-Reuters green-screen
monitors, a second-hand DPS 1101
daisywheel printer, and my trusty MPS
801, m o d iﬁe d  t o  g iv e  i t  t r u e
descenders. All this, which resembles
the command module of the Starship
Enterprise. cost less than C700, and
provides me with a work station more
than adequate (hi' my  purpose, the
collection and management of several
thousands of genealogical ( lam ily tree)
records.
Until fairly  recently, w e Plus /4
types have been a t  a  considerable
disadvantage i n  the software ﬁeld.
True, we have our built-in software.
This is of doubtful usefulness though it
fortunately does n't interfere w i t h
memory, and is  easily removable i f
desired. T h e  s ituation h a s  n o w
however, improved enormously, for
Precision Softw ar e h a s  released
Version 2  o f  Superbase and Script
Plus, a word processor program which
I rate higher than Easy Script on the
Not t o be outdone by Precision.
Impex Software has recently produced
a fair ly  comprehensive accounting
system f o r  t h e  Plus / 4,  entitled
"Company Pac 1.2.3
include a spreadsheet?). Although not
needing this program pur c has ed it
simply to support their effort.
The future then for P1us/4 owners
is looking much brighter, user group
clubs are starting up, and I see that we
are now catered for  on the modem
ironWe could do with better support
from the hardware manufacturers. I
am approaching the point when I
could use a  hard disk system, but
unfortunately I am not aware of one
which is compatible. Perhaps someone
out there can help'?

Features stunning graphics that have only been previously
seen in static adventures such as The Pawn. In the Last Ninja
some of these are animated and form the back cloth for some
bone-crunching battles.
You play Armakuni who was left as The Last Ninja when

on the island of Lin Fen, by the dark forces summoned by
the evil Shogun Kunitoka. You have sworn to seek revenge
of this Shogun and his false Ninja's that are now being
trained on the despoiled island.
To complete your quest you must ﬁght your way through
the six areas of the island until you come face to face with the
Shogun in his palace. In each stage you will have to ﬁght the
Shogun's Ninja's that are armed with a variety of weapons
which you can also use, if you can ﬁnd them hidden in the
undergrowth. Yo u  w ill ﬁnd temples and fountains o f
knowledge and be given divine guidance for what to look for.

The Last
Ninja
After Way of the Exploding Fist,
which started the Kung-Fu craze,
we all wondered where it would end.
System 3's Last Ninja is the answer
- nothing can possibly beat this
Kung Fu King.
Controlling the Ninja isn't that easy as your using a
complicated selection of joystick moves that have different
results depending o n  whic h weapon you're using and
whether you've pressed t h e  ﬁr e button. I t ' s  n o t  as
complicated as some games such as Rock and Wrestle but it
takes some practice before you make better use of your three
lives.
It's a fair bet that you'll lose a few lives trying to leap
across the river or marsh on the ﬁrst level since success
depends on the correct combination o f  jumps. This is
another acquired skill but you didn't expect it to be easy, did
you?
Your quest begins in the wilderness where you must
search for important weapons and useful objects as well as
practice your jumping and ﬁghting skills. After a few games
you may be good enough to get past the ﬁre breathing
dragon at  the end o f  the level and go on to enter the
wastelands. Survive the wastelands and cross the Lin Fen
mountains to the Palace Gardens, and then it's through the
dungeons t o  t h e  palace ( lower  level) unt il a  ﬁnal
confrontation in the Inner Sanctum.
The graphics are superb and I can assure you that the
standard is maintained throughout the game. However, that
is only  half the story. T he Last Ninja features some
ﬁendishly difﬁcult logic problems, such as how do you get
past the dragon without getting fried and one of the most
realistic combat systems seen in a game where the damage
inﬂicted by a blow not only depends on the weapon used but
also where you hit him. So a chop to the head with a sword
will d o considerably more damage that a  kick in  the
stomach.
The last Ninja is quite simply the last word in combatH
games.

Code Masters
C
just seven months ago last November, at the time of the great
budget bonanza. Software giants like US Gold launched
their own American budget games so there surely wasn't
room for a newcomer, There was, and now Code Masters
boasts Gallup ﬁgures that make it the number two budget
software house and claim it's hot on the heels of the leader
Mastertronic.
The Code Masters story began four years ago with a
company called Galactic Software that was formed by
David and Richard Darling to sell their own mail order VIC-
20 games. This went remarkably well and soon they were
writing games for other software houses on other machines
such as Master o f  Magic and B M X  Simulator fo r
Mastertronic and the Mirrorsoft Games Creator. I n
November 1986, Richard and David were joined by Jim
Darling (their father) and subsequently formed Code
Masters.
The current Code Masters collection contains ten games
for the C64 that includes eight fast action arcade games, an
adventure and the release of the Games Creator.
BMX Simulator
This is the all action sequal to B M X  Racers and is the
toughest BMX challenge you'll face. Using joystick power
instead of pedal power you must race around seven courses
packed with bumps, ramps, hills and different surfaces.

The sequel to the superb Last V8, only this time you're riding
a superbike as you attempt to save the Astroworld from
certain destruction. The game begins as you awake to
ﬁnd that the Renegade Lords have sabotaged the ship and
now you have to save it. This. isn't going to be easy as you
must drive around the bike crunching landscape t o
deactivate 27 ﬁssion mines before descending to  the
engineering level to power up eight back up cooling systems.
shut down four power plants and ﬁnally wake the crew in the
hibernation centre!
Super Robin Hood
Robin Hood is back in Super Robin Hood in my favourite
Code Masters game. It's an excellent animated platforr
game in which Robin must battle his way past crossbows
ﬁring, guards, ﬁnd keys to operate ancient lifts and collect
enough heart symbols to save Maid Marion. The action is
fast and furious and so smooth. If you like platform games
you'll love this one.
Mr Angry
This nearly got Code Masters into trouble with the supposed
similarity between the game and the character on Radio
One's Steve Wright show. The game features your attempts
to get a picture of a glamour model staying somewhere in the
hotel. First you must collect your camera, ﬂash and press
pass before you're ready to get the picture. Unfortunately,
the hotel staff will try and stop you as well as one of the
guests, Mr Angry.
Thunderbolt
It had to happen sooner or later. Both sides in the war
between Earth and Proxima had developed the chronoclasm
bomb that could not only destroy things but things that had
been and things that were about to be. It was inevitably used
ripping the space time continuum over Europe mixing ten
centuries of history in battle. You are Thunderbolt the pilot
of an Earthonian ﬁghter and you must destroy anything that
moves until the effects of the bomb subsides and you survive
until the end of the game.

robot in only a small scout ship. Each screen is full of ship
wrecking walls as well as time shifts that send you back to
screen one (particularly annoying if you're on screen 99!) but
you will also ﬁnd extra fuel dumps, bonus scores, extra lives
and force ﬁeld generators that make you invulnerable to the
constant alien onslaught, but only for a few seconds. Seven
screens down, 93 to go!
Creations
If you think you can create your own game then why not try
Creations which is a reincarnation of the original Games
Creator complete with three sample games. Now you can
deﬁne the backgrounds, sprites, sound effects, alien
movements and player characteristics for your own games
for only £1.99. The Ciames Creator was a good buy at its
original full price but now it's a budget bargain.
Neeris Dome
Finally, Necris Dome takes us into the world of adventure
onboard -
that's been taken over by the rogue Archmandroid who is
now training the mandroids for an attack on Earth. You're
smuggled Onto the ship with the next shipment of cofﬁns to
try and stop them. Will you succeed or are you just early for
your funeral? These questions are answered as you delve
deeper into a fascinating graphic adventure with puzzles that
will challenge even the toughest adventurer.
The Next Move
Anybody who has played any of the Code Masters games
will realise their tremendous success is due to the standard of
their games. At times it easy to forget that they only cost
.E1.99 each, as many are as good, if not better, than their full-
price counterparts.
That was all achieved in just seven months and already
the Code Masters are planning their next move. The next
move comes in the guise of Lazer-force which is to be a
sequel to Thunderbolt. The game is to feature 30 main levels
with bonus stages between each level and graphics showing
erupting volcanoes, mutating landscapes and a  giant
metallic millipede. You've got just a few weeks to practice
with the other games before you can sign up for the Lazer-

Talking
through your
RS232
A
most exciting product a s fa r  a s
appearance is concerned. For your
money all you appear to get is two
connectors with a length of cable to
separate them. Don't be deceived by
appearances, this could be one of the
most gratifying additions fo r your
Commodore.
An RS232 is the Commodore's link
with the real world via the user port.
the most ignored socket on the back of
any recent Commodore machine. Via
this outlet you can communicate with
Compunet, link up with another CM,
access a wider range o f printers or
perform electronic wizardry with a
whole series of domestic equipment.
I can already heat the muttering
about the user port being RS232 and
There's more to this interlace than meets the eye. Do
not be deceived by ﬁrst impressions.
By Eric Doyle
you're n o t wrong b u t th e  great
drawback i s  that the Commodore
implementation o n l y provides a
0/+5V output and most true RS232
equipment requires a +/-I2V supply.
York Electronic Research's interface
does the necessary conversion for you.
Value for Money?
For your money you also get a disk or
tape which initialises the port for use
and will also convert the 64 into a
terminal emulator fo r use with a
suitable modem.
It is obvious by reading the manual
that the modem link and printer
interface are considered to be the most

important uses for the unit and the
detail is sufﬁcient to get you up and
running. As far as connecting two Ms
together, the detail is sketchy and a few
wiring diagrams would avoid the
possibility o f  the keen amateur
blowing up two 64s in one fell swoopl
RS232 communications have a
language all their own. Handshakes,
baud rate, parity and duplex form the
new vocabulary which n o t  o n l y
confuses the newcomer but also has an
off-putting effect on those considering
modem communications. The new
syntax is explained quite well in a
concise way which proves that the
jargon is no more than part of the rites
of telecommunication.
Handshaking is a way in which one
terminal tells the other that it is about

H A R D W A R E  R E V I E W
to send data and the other terminal
says it is ready to receive. Baud rate is
the speed a t  whic h information is
transmitted. Quite often the speed of
transmission can be different to the
speed at which information is received.
In human terms this means that one
machine speaks more slowly than the
other.
Parity i s  a  c hec k  f o r  d a t a
corruption. Anyone who has used a
telephone knows how a bad line means
that conversation can be difﬁcult. This
is also true in the comms world. Parity
does not solve the problem but it can
let you know that something is wrong.
Information is sent in binary form, a
string of ones and zeros in bursts of
eight digits. If you're working on even
parity, seven o f  the bits  hold the
information for a single character, the
computer counts the number of ones in
that character and i f  this is an odd
number the eighth bit will be a one if
not i t  w i l l  transmit a  zero. T he
receiving terminal knows that if there is
an o d d  number  o f  ones i n  t h e
transmitted byte something has gone

wrong. Similarly 'some systems use
parity based on odd nu mbers.
Full duplex is when both machines
are able to talk simultaneously to one
another a n d  h a l f  duplex  means
transmission in one direction must end
before the machine can receive.
The s oftware f o r  YER ' s  RS232
interface supports any of these systems
via a simple menu selection system.
The Set Up program is mainly for use
with RS232 printers and your only real
concern is the baud rate. If the printer
does not tell you which rate to use it
will n o t  damage t h e  machine t o
experiment a little. The worst that can
happen is that the printer will, fail to
respond.
A handy troubleshooting section
should solve most of the problems with
printers, but if a baud rate over 2400 is
required the 64 cannot respond fast
enough. Luckily most printers have
switches to select various rates so all
may not be lost,
Limitations
The one drawback o f  the Terminal
Emulator i s  t h a t  i t  c an't handle
Viewdata/Prestel style graphics which
limits y our  entry in t o  the comms
%vorld slightly. Apart from this, the
software menu is ﬂexible enough for
any system you'd want to talk to and
cuts down the sophistication and cost
of the modem required.
York Electronic Research have
provided a  service whic h t o  most
Commodore owners never realised
they required. RS232 interfacing is the
subject of several books and articles
which beneﬁts a sector of users who
wish to combine an interest in amateur
electronics with their computer hobby.
For these people YER can supply the
missing link.

was one of the most crowded ever. The reason -  software -
very cheap software.
The crowds were not surrounding the Amiga stands,
gasping at the Blitter chips capabilities, and thinking that the
Amiga would be the next thing, but crowding around the
benches, with boxes and trays of games from 50p upwards,
gasping at the bargains and thinking that they'd never had it
so good.
More and more people are getting the message that the
Commodore show offers amazing software bargains, not
only hardware ones, often in excess 01E200. Companies such
as Sheklana, Tvvillstar Computers. J B  Software and
Trybridge were reporting t h e  highest turnovers, n o t
Commodore and the other assorted hardware suppliers.
Many software companies were there, but mainly the
smaller independent ones, and although this is a good sign,
showing us that they are still around, and that we have a
choice, most of the major houses were conspicuous by their
absence.

This was selling like hot cakes, as was Terra Nova, a

Summer Events featured speech.
Tynesoft, the Newcastle based house were showing off
Phantoms, a one player gauntlet variant which I recently
awarded a Gamer Gold and Spy vs Spy, which they've
acquired the C16 rights to and produced a faithful copy. The
other main CI6 Producer, Gremlin was, like so many others
absent. We are still waiting for Thing on the CI6 and it
would have been nice to have seen Thing Bounces Back,
Rebounder, and their promised Amiga products.
Where Were They?
Imagine weren't there to show us Army  moves or  their
conversion of Taito's excellent coin-op, Slaplight. Irnagine's
controlling house. Ocean weren't there either, so we didn't
get a glimpse of Tai-pan, !lead Over Heels or their much
praised Wizball. Hewson didn't turn up but their Eagles
were on sale elsewhere. Jeff Minter wasn't there, so we are
still guessing about a release date for Revenge 2 and whether
there are going to be any more C16 conversions.

presence, so we did not have a chance to see Metrocross,
Roadrunner, World Class Leaderboard (the fourth so far) or
Killed Until Dead. Budget Wonders, Mastertronie were not
there, neither were their newly acquired full price label,
Melbourne House. Activision weren't there, so we couldn't
sec how their arcade conversions of Wonderboy and Quartet
were coming along. This also meant that there was no news
of their offshm System 3's Last Ninja, which should have
come out in January.
Also missing were Ariolasoft, Firebird and Codemasters
but it was their loss, not ours. Their software was selling fast,
and if they didn't want to be there to cash in on it. so be it.
That was the attitude shared by most at the show, we got the
software and those who did turn up made a fortune. The
show was a great success without the Elites, Palaces and US
Ciolds.
Bargains Galore
There were some real bargains however, Thai Boxing,
Allevkat, Lightforce, Terra Cresta, Bazooka Bill, Psycastria,
Now Games, Impossible Mission. Ghosts and Goblins.
Many, many' more were .£2 or less, so as you can imagine, to
snap up these bargains, a  b it  o f  elbow was required!
Gimmick of the show award went to Postronix, the mail
order software and video suppliers who were selling the
major new releases such as Barbarians and The Big Four at
£8 each, 1
free camera with every purchase. Many people, including
myself were taken in by this, ﬂow well it will work. I don't
know, but Postronix are laughing all the way to the bank
There were a few hardware bargains on offer, such as tli
Music Expansion System at t  75, but it's been available
mail-order at this price for a good few months now. Ther.-
was the odd tener off a disk-drive, printer or monitor here or
there, but there was no kindness from Commodore (so
what's new?), They might at least have given us t 100 off the
Amiga A500, or thrown in a free monitor, but no such luck.
The hardware stands had many people gazing in awe. but
not many buying. With the exception of the A500, we'd seen
it all before. The hardware stands were offering nothing new.
and any discounts were minimal. With games like Lightforce
and Tenth Frame at 12 it was destined to be a softwa re s how
with or without the support of the major software houses,
and it was.
Garners had the bargains of a lifetime, and there was a
new feature this year. I 6C6L1s (not the lager) in a segment
all their own. A l l  with games loaded up so players could
try out some of  the latest releases of the companies whki
didn't exhibit. This too was very popular, and almost as
crowded as the software stands. Anyway, as I have said, it
was a software show, and a very good one at that, and I
would advise anyone who did not go, to go to the next
one, and maybe next time there will be more hardware
sri pport, and, of course, bargains.

port and a decent operating system,
the Commodore 64 tends to be a lonely
computer. sitting on its own, talking to
its own peripherals, but being ignored
by all the posher computers as they
talk to each other.
Why this is so is a bit of a mystery.
Compared to the BBC Micro, which
leads in the communications stakes,
the C64 is more than well enough
endowded. The BBC Micro has a
printer and disk drive port: the C64 has
its intelligent peripherals bus —  a
considerably more advanced piece of
interfacing. The BBC has eight lines of
user port with two handshake lines; so
does the CM. but provided by a much
more advanced chip and with extra
handshake lines.
The BBC has a four line RS4.23
interface; the C64 has a  full spec
RS232C (almost!). The BBC has four
A to D converters; so does the C64,
and some joystick ports too. The BBC
has the 1MHz bus and the tube; the
hardware of the C64 cartridge port is
more advanced than both these put
together.
What it comes down to is software;
the in-built software in the C64 stinks.
You have to write all the assembler
yourself and the operating system just
doesn't want to know.
The user port can transmit data at
very high rates, with no errors and with
very little hassle. As a lot of other
computers have similar capabilities for
Hook-Ups
Is your poor little 64 sitting in a corner with no-one to
talk to? No more! Follow this series, and your computers
could soon be communicating with Beebs. Species, and
eVCII other 64s!
By My croft Appleby
a parallel interface like this, usually
called a printer interface, though on
occasion i t is hooked up to some
joystick ports. With suitable software,
you should be able to  send huge
amounts o f data. at extremely high
speed, between any popular computer
and the Commodore 64,
Imagine using a BBC Micro to
develop a  program on, and then
sending the code down the line to the
C64, or sending graphics information
from a C64 to an Amstrad for plotting
on its hi-res screen!
The possibilities a re  endless.
Communication between two or more
computers is great once you start. The
power of the modern microcomputer
is astounding. But when you get two
processors hooked up together sharing
tasks i t gets even better. A  lot o f
'serious' computer enthusiasts have
more than one computer because some
computers are better suited for some
jobs than others. You wouldn't buy a
C64 because of its fast disk drive, or
masses of development software. But
on the other hand you wouldn't get a
BBC Micro just for games.
And then...
What this series is setting out to do is to
provide hardware and software details
of hooking up a Commodore 64 to any
other popular home computer.
intend covering connecting to BBC,
Amstrad CPC, Spectrum. Atari, and
of course other Commodore 64s.
To do this a few concepts need
explaining ﬁrst. Next month will be the
ﬁrst practical example o f  th e
connection o f a BBC Micro and a
Commodore M. This month we will
look at the hardware involved.
Most computers have serial and
parallel ports, both of which can be
used for communication.
A serial port is designed to use as
few wires as possible to connect two
computers together — in a minimum-
conﬁguration one-way system, just
two wires are needed. The eight bits in
a byte of information are sent down
the line one after another to be picked
up at the other end. Complex error
checking is needed, as it is easy to miss
bits or count them twice, and this
makes th e  software extremely
complex. Also, the two computers
have to be perfectly syrnchronised. In
general, serial communication is a pain
even at the best of times. We will not be
using serial communication!
Parallel communication is another
kettle of ﬁsh. It uses enough wires to
send all eight bits in the byte at once.
However, the disadvantage of this is
that more wires are needed —  a
minimum of 11 for our purposes (eight
for the data, one earth and two for
control). A l s o ,  t h i s  t y p e  o f
communication is more susceptible to
interference than serial with its error
checking, so parallel links are usually
limited to 10 feet in length of cable run.
YOUR COMMODORE september 1987
37

Parallel communication goes at the
speed of the slowest computer, but is
typically at least ten times faster than
serial communciation.
How do you do!
The extra lines in the connection are
used by the communicating computers
to tell each other that the data is being
put o n  t h e  line. T hey  ar e called
handshaking lines . T h e  s ending
computer tells the receiving computer
that there is data on the line, and once
the receiving computer has received
the data, it sends a signal to say that it
has the data and is ready for the next
lot. The process then repeats.
The hand-shaking lines c an b e
interrupt oper at ed o r  c hec k ed
manually. They can be set manually,
or automatic ally  b y  t h e  c h i p
responsible to the interfacing to the
rest of the computer.
A detailed example will make this a
lot clearer, so let us consider two C64s
t alk ing t o  e a c h  o t h e r .  T h e
handshaking is in full interrupt receive
ode a n d  b o t h  computers hav e
-Ivanced software that allows the
)mputer to get on with other tasks
hile the data is  being received. A
typical interchange w o u ld  g o  a s
follows:
The sending computer sets its user
port to full output mode. This means
that all the I / 0  lines in the user port
will be used for sending data. The byte
to be sent is put onto the output port_
This makes the port take up the binary
image of the byte being sent. Each one
of the eight lines represents a binary 0
or a 1. with OV for 0 and 5V for T h e
sending c omputer  t h e n  ﬂip s  i t s
handshake line From OS" to 5V and
back again. It then waits, looking at
the other handshake line fr om the
receiving computer.
At the other end of the cable, the
receiving c omputer  i s  ex pec ting
something to appear on the connection
and so has set its I/O user port to full
input mode (if it hasn't, there will by
now be two fried I/O  chips!) This
means that 5V on any of the lines will
be read as a binary I by this computer
and DV as a binary O. It has also set up
an interrupt program ar ound t h e
handshake lin e  f r o m  t h e  sending
computer. But at the moment it  is
minding its own business and getting
on with something else.
Suddenly the handshake line from
C64 C O M M U N I C A T I O N S
the sending computer 'bounces' and
this makes the interface chip interrupt
the receiving computer from whatever
it is doing and look at the input port.
"Ah h a ! ,  a  by te,"  t h e  receiving
computer thinks and reads it. Haying
read t h e  b y t e  i t  'bounc es ' t h e
handshake line back to the sending
computer and gets back to whatever
it was doing.
The sending computer however,
has notic ed t h e  c hange i n  t h e
handshake line fr om the receiving
computer and puts another byte onto
the output port —  and so the cycle
continues.
These bytes could be anything:
data transfer, memory dumps, screen
messages, graphics information, o r
data to control the other computer.
The Hardware
The connection is to be made from one
User Port to the other, all eight I/O
lines of one computer to the other: this
is the main data highway. FLAG  2 is
the N M I  g e n e r a t in g in c o m in g
handshake line on the ('64 side and
PA2 is the main outitoing one. FLAG2
gets connected to CBI on the BBC side
which is the outgoing handshake line
From the BBC micro. PA 2 is connected
to CB2 which is the IRQ generating
incoming handshake line of the BBC'.
Ground is common as usual.
The User Port of the C64 is the port
on the far left of the machine as you
look at it from the front. The User Port
occupies all the connections on the
bottom o f  t h is  connector. ' I  lie
connections on the top are of some use.
but not in  this application, mainly
being used to power external devices
using this port.
The conﬁguration (looking at the
port from the rear) is as follows:
Gnd FLAG2 1)0 DI D2 1)3 1)4 D5
D6 D7 PA2 Gnd
The plug that y ou need is  a
standard 0.156 in c h  p it c h  edge
connector and needs to be soldered
I'm afraid.
The BBC  side is  slightly easier
being a 20 way IDC connector. You

The reason that nybbles had to be

However you are not left with the

The software listed here is in BBC

better assembler and is much faster at
loading. it is easier to load a small boot
program into the C64, then load the
CM transfer program into the BBC
and squirt it down the line.
So to load the system in you should
ﬁrst load the C64 hoot program into

the C64 hoot program, type 'C ALL

Future Sounds
We must apologise for not giving a
price or contact for Futuresound in
our last issue. Thanks to those who
called a n d  r e m in d e d  u s !  T h e
Futuresound sound sampler for the
Amiga is available from Tri Computer
Software. It costs t l  70 + VAT  which
comes to t  195 including delivery to
your door. See touchline for the full
address details.
Database by Design
A very interesting demonstration of a
brand new database for the Amiga has
come our way. Available from Taurus
Impex, t h e  Ac quis ition database
appears to excel in both presentation
and user friendly behaviour, including
'cut and paste' of data between ﬁelds.
Graphic images can be stored as well
as more conventional text, date and
numeric data A  single ﬁeld c an
contain a picture or document.
A *mapped ﬁling system' allows
both relational and hierarchical ﬁling
structures, in combination if required.
Up to 16 ﬁles can be handled in one
application.
The Acquisition editors follow full
design of both data format and data
presentation. Data is manipulated in
one tier and placed i n  reports i n
another. A  190 function database
language called ACO M allows direct
setup and automatic control o f  the
database. Apparently Acquisition can
read and write information t o  and
from other software.
Acquisition is being aimed both at
non-programmers and professionals
who need to build turnkey database
systems.

explains a method of calling compiled
C routines from BASIC.
If you enjoy programming then
Conversation with a Computer is an
excellent introduction to many aspects
of working with the Amiga.
Display Debate
The Amiga is obviously stirring both
m a n u t
concerning how to actually observe
the famous graphics quality. This is
because the A500 is being sold with
and without monitor. G. Slade from
Crewkernc has written to Your Amiga
saying that he bought an Amiga 500
from Busbyte (Hobbyte) at their stall
at the Commodore Show in London,
but only after he had been promised a
TV modulator the following week. It
transpired that Busbyte c ould not
deliver. A phone call to Commodore
revealed t h a t  t h e y  h a d  m o r e
modulators t h a n  computers'. M r
Slade rang Busbyte again with the
good news. They phoned Commodore
who by this time changed their minds.
They were ordering modulators. The
moral of this story is don't leave the
shop without monitor or modulator
because the stylish grey hardware can
get boring on its own!
Good news for owners o f  CBM
1901 monitors. Trilogic can convert
the 1901 for use with the Amiga so that
it can display any of the 4096 colours.
The 1901 was intended for use with the
C128 and has video and RGBI inputs.
By adding a SCART (euro) socket,
plus other modiﬁcations and a special
lead (including audio), Trilogic can
realise t h e  f u l l  c olour , medium
resolution capability of the monitor.
The price of the upgrade is t 24.96.
Mail order upgrades will cost a further
t 15.00 f o r  d a t a p o s t  d e l i v e r y
(remember to send your monitor by
insured post of some kind). Those in
the Bradford area can of course call in

Commodore at Comet
By the time you read this article your
local Comet store should have its
special 'demons tr ation m o d u le '
installed and a stack of A500s in the
storeroom. Commodore announced
this ﬁrst 'high street' deal in mid June
and their national sales manager said
'this is the ﬁrst in a series of multiple
retail announcements that c an b e
expected fr om Commodore i n  the
coming months.'
Television Output
The Amiga A500 is very reasonably
priced considering its performance but
the price of a colour monitor can push
the tr ue system cost much higher.
Many users will happily plug their
A500 into their television. T his  is
cheaper but a terrible waste o f  the
graphics quality. Triangle Television,
specialists i n  t h e  combination o f
Amiga and video, have come up with a
solution t o  the problem with their
ROB t o  Video and R G B t o  R F
converter boxes. There arc currently
rive units, BR3 through BR7, which
combine t o  provide either o r  both
video out and RE Out.
The convertor boxes tak e t he
Amiga RGB output and convert it for
a television o r  f o r  a  home v ideo
recorder. A valuable offshoot of this is
the ability to record the Amiga screen
on v ideo tape. a  portable way  o f
distributing A m ig a  ar twor k  a n d
animation. Amiga graphics can o f
course be used as an opening title
screen o r  for  a lis t o f  credits on a
conventionally shot video.
Triangle's John Clark  (Research
and Development) says: 'This unit has
an innovative design feature which
produces what we call "Super RE" and
means that the colours and deﬁnition
are of a very good quality on the home
television.'
For A1000 owners who wish t o
record o n  video, the units give a
cleaner s ignal t h a n  t h e  standard
composite out. Prices range fr om
07.00 to £79.93.

to look at it in detail, as there seems to

The Third Option
We looked at Analyze in detail. The
ﬁrst thing we did was to copy the
diskette. so that we could put the
original safely away, as recommended
by the Analyze manual. As Analyze
isn't c opy  protected, this  is  very
stniigh tl orward.
When you click on the Analyze
icon, a requester pops up asking how

Commodore designed the Amiga to be a business

games machine. One of the main applications for micros
in business is the spreadsheet, so just how successﬁdly
have these been implemented on the Amiga to date?

Theoretically if you ask for too much,
the requester stays up, but in practice
the requester goes away, and you have
to click on Analyze again.
Sometimes, the whole screen goes

blank, and you have to refresh it before
you can try again. It would have been
better i f  the requester told you the
maximum space available f o r  the
spreadsheet. as they tend to be very
memory-hungry applications. O u r

5I2K Amiga wouldn't allow 256K of
memory, but when we requested 200K,
it happily let us into the spreadsheet.
Lotus 123 Similarities
At th i s  point, w e  h a d  a  very
pleasant surprise, Analyze i s very
reminiscent o f the old version la of
Lotus 123. This has been a major best
seller on the IB M  PC, and quite
rightly, as it has all the functionality
that a business user requires.
MSS have not copied the full 'look
and feel' of 123, which has turned out
to be a wise move, as Lotus are suing
two US software houses for doing this
on the IBM. They have adapted the
123 user interface so that it is more
suited t o  the Amiga, b u t i n  o u r
opinion, they have not gone as far as
they could have.
To load an existing spreadsheet,
you bring up the menu with the right
mouse button, as usual. You choose
Project, th e n  Archive, a n d  th e
requester that pops up lets you get

The Archive requester also lets you

can also use this requester to move

unwanted ﬁles.
MSS provide a  f e w  simple

S O FTWA R E  R E V I E W
what is possible. It would be a good
idea to start o ff by loading one of
these, and changing it around, to get
the idea of a spreadsheet, and to get the
feel of Analyze.
The e n d  p ro d u ct o f  m o s t
spreadsheets is a report on paper. So
Analyze gives you various ways to
format your Output, and you can then
print it either directly to your printer,
or else to  disk, so that i t can be
incorporated i n t o  so me  larger
document.
Cells can be formatted in several
ways. The default is General, numbers
are displayed in the most natural way.
But you can change the format either
for the whole spreadsheet, or for a
range of cells.
Fixed gives a ﬁxed number of
decimal places
Scientiﬁc uses the E (exponential)
format, and is suitable for very large
or very small numbers,
Currency puts a dollar sign in front
of ﬁgures, and puts negative
numbers in brackets. It also uses a
comma to separate thousands.
There's no way to get the pound
sign.
Commas is like currency, but
without the dollar sign.
Percent displays the value times 100,
followed by a Ci•

Text displays the formula. rather than
the result of' the formula, and is useful
for documenting the spreadsheet.
Date is used for formatting the date.
YOUR AMIGA september 1987

Having formatted the output, you
can then print it. Analyze lets you
choose the range you want to print,
allows you to  deﬁne headers and
footers for each page, deﬁne the page
width and length, and send the printer
a set-up string so you can put your
printer into NLQ mode before starting
the print (or whatever else you want).
so it is possible to set up attractive
reports, and incorporate these into a
major document.
For a report with more impact you
might choose to display the ﬁgures in
one of three graph types, pie, bar and
line. The graph data is entered in
sequence by choosing data from the
spreadsheet. This can involve as
little as clicking the mouse on an
individual cell. Explanatory text
is entered i n  a  parallel sequence.
The graphs are rapidly drawn in a
new window.
Manoeuvrability
One o f the most important factors
affecting how nice a spreadsheet is to
use, is how easy it is to move around in
it. Lotus 123 is very easy to move
around, even without a  mouse,
because of all the different ways there
are for navigating the cursor around
the spreadsheet. Analyze gives you a
Few ways, a n d  th e y a re  badly
insufﬁcient.
The most obvious way is to use the
cursor control keys and this will move
the cursor around the displayed screen
changes to reﬂect the new position, but
it doesn't try to  refresh the screen
immediately (as per 123). I t  just
refreshes the row numbers, until you
take your ﬁnger off the cursor, and
then the whole screen is updated. This
speeds things up quite a lot, compared
with the way Lotus did it. But it still
feels rather slow.
You can also move around using
the mouse, but this has not been done
very well. You can only move around
within the screen currently displayed:
you can't move off the bottom and
expect the screen to scroll in the same
way as you can with the cursor
controls. This is a major limitation, as
it means that the mouse is almost
useless f o r  moving around, a s
spreadsheeting usually involves
moving large distances. It's hard to see
why MSS didn't let you move off the
bottom with the mouse, or provide
scroll bars, or let you drag the screen.

Even using the cursor keys, there
are big limitations in your Keedom of
movement. You can move .up and
down a page at a time, using Shift-
arrow keys, but there is no fast way to
move right or left, a page at a time. It is
a big pain that spreadsheets tend to be
wide rather than deep. One of the most
useful navigation keys in 123 is the End
key, which mgniﬁes any arrow key so
that the cursor moves to the end of the
row or column. There is no equivalent
in analyze. There is only one method
provided fo r  making large jumps
around the spreadsheet, and that is to
use the Goto key (F5) to move directly
to the cell required. But this is not the
intuitive way to move around, and
very few Lotus users move this way,
even though this method is available in
123. We think that MSS should put a
LOT more work into the different
ways o f  mo vi n g  a ro u n d  t h e
spreadsheet.
Entering data into Analyze is easy
you simply type the number, formula
or label into the cell. It is also easy to
replicate cells, using. Copy. Copy can
be invoked by Using the mouse to bring
up the menu, and choosing Range
Copy, or by hitting C while holding
down the right Amiga key. Since the
mouse isn't very useful for moving
around t h e  spreadsheet, yo u 'l l
probably use Amiga-C, as i t feels
better to stay on the keyboard than to
keep switching between that and the
mouse.
You can then type in the range you
want to copy from (such as DI E 6 )
and then the range to copy to. But it's
more natural to point to the 'from' and
'to' ranges. To do this, you move the
cursor to the start of the from-range,
press the key (this anchors one end of
the cursor), then you move the cursor
to the far end of the from-range. As
you move i t, the cursor expands,
showing you the calls you've chosen to
copy. When you get to the far end, you
press RETURN and Analyze asks you
where to copy these cells. You move
the cursor to the top left hand corner of
the area you want to copy to, and press
Enter, and the range is copied.
This is all very simple and intuitive
in action, but could be made easier by a
wider variety of movement methods.
People w h o  have never seen
spreadsheets i n  action before are
always pleasantly surprised by the way
that formulae adjust themselves when
copied, so that they are still correct. So
that i f a formula that refers to C2 is
SOFTWARE R E V IE W
copied one cell to the right, the copy
refers to D2 and all is right with the
world. Most of the time, this is how
you want it to work, but sometimes,
you don't.
So you can pui an absolute (as
opposed to a relative) reference into a
cell. This is done by using $ in the
formula. So SCS2 in a formula means
that even when it is copied, the copy
will still refer to cell C2. You can also
have mixed references, such as $C2 -
when this is copied. it will always refer
to column C. but the row number will
be adjusted. Similarly, you can have
C$2.
Another feature th a t serious
spreadsheet users think is vital, is what
is called 'natural' recalculation order.
Some spreadsheets a l l o w  t h e
recalculation to proceed row by row or
column by column. This means that if
you refer to a cell below and to the
right, the spreadsheet will get the
answer wrong, unless you recalculate
according to their dependencies, in the
way that you would expect. Analyze
uses natural recalculation order,
although you can tell it to work row
wise or column wise. Recalculation is
normally automatic: every time a cell is
changed, the spreadsheet recalculates.
But when a spreadsheet grows large.
recalculation can take a long time, so
Analyze provides a Manual recalc -
you can enter a lot of data, and then hit
the Recalc (F9) key.
Analyze provides all the formulae
that you are likely to need, as well as a
number you're not likely to need (such
as Arctan). The usual functions such as
@ SUM, @ AVG (average), S Q R T
are all there, as well as ﬁnancial -
functions like Future Value, N e t
Present Value, and Present Value.
YOUR AMIGA september 1987
You can also create your o n
functions with H LOOKUP, which lets
you set up a look-up table, and you can
return values from the table that
depend on the index you supply. This
is very useful for tax tables, or payroll
calculations, where the answers are not
smooth formulae, but can best be
represented a s  a  look-up table.
VLOOKUP is the same thing, but the
table is a column of cells instead of d
row.
Another powerful feature is @
as this lets you return one value if the
condition is true, and another i f it's
false. You can create conditonals to
test using the usual equality and
inequality tests, and you can then
combine th e m using #  NOT #
AND# , and #OR#
Conclusion
If we wanted a spreadsheet, and a
computer to run it on, we would not f
choose Analyze on the Amiga. But if
we had a n  Amiga and needed a
spreadsheet, ,Analyze i s  a  quite
serviceable product. Most import-
antly. at no time during its use were we
invited to meditate on some strange
number, with consequent loss of all
our work -  that would be the most
unforgiveable sin, and i t  did not
happen. But the means o f moving
around the spreadsheet should be
improved, as that should not be too big
a programming job.

rts,
Gold Disk have released an
important extension to their
Pagesetter software, the
LaserScript package which acts as
an interpreter for any laser printer
which understands the Postcript
page description language.
Pagesetter, like other graphics
based programs, usually prints the
screen page on a dot matrix
printer, translating the dots seen
on screen into the appropriate
pattern and intensity of printed
dots on the paper. Postscript is
one of a new generation o f
languages (sets of codes) which
both laser printers and typesetting
machines can understand.
LaserS cript describes a
Pagesetter page in the correct
codes for such printers. Not all
laser printers have the Postscript
interpreter built- in, including the
latest cheap lasers, such as the
Epson and Citizen. Pagesetter can
certainly "dump" its pages to these
printers but even LaserScript will
not be able to "aescriLe" them.
Postcript Power
What is the difference then?
LaserScript will allow Pagesetter
pages to use high quality
typesetting fonts like Helvetica,
Times, Courier and Symbol.
These are supplied in 8, 12,16 and
24 point sizes and there is a utility
to convert to other point sizes as
required. Some laser printers are

Publisher
powerful computers themselves
and contain a number of fonts in
ROM. The full resolution of the
laser printer or typesetter will be
used, not the resolution of an
Epson dot matrix emulation.
LaserScript also allows you to
stack Pagesetter pages onto just
one custom designed page. You
can create "forms" which are
templates for the Pagesetter pages.
The Postscript language can be
used to create all sorts of
typesetting effect's such as grey
tints, white text on black
background and text printed in a
curved fashion.
Postscript is a full language
with its own commands and
structures. However LaserScript
does not supply the language in a
form which is programmable but
provides a front end "studio" in
which you choose typefaces and
page design. Laserscript then
translates the appropriate
Pagesetter pages and sends the
correct Postscript codes to the
printer.
This text is a Pagesetter page
printed on a dot matrix printer.
We have used the Times typeface
in different sizes, the Courier font
in 12 point and there is an example
of the PS ymbol (special character)
font at the end of the page.
These fonts can be copied to
the Pagesetter disc or, with a two
drive system, become the default
fonts by inserting the LaserScript
disc at the Workbench prompt.

) n g , ,  h e  ideal assembler and associated software tools are
designed to make the writing of code as easy as possible.
Requirements include ease o f  documentation a n d
debugging, the ability to use meaningful tables and different
number bases (e.g. binary, octal), When you buy a
professional assembler i t  i s also fair to  expect lucid
documentation and for the beginner to 68000, a basic
introduction to the chip.
In actual fact the assemblers looked at here provide
different combinations of editor -  in which the program
instructions (source code) are written: assembler - which
takes the assembler instructions and turns them into
machine instructions (object code); monitor/debugger - for
checking the actions of the instructions; and linker - which
takes combinations of object code (created by assembler or
high level compiler) and links them together into one ﬁle.

Seka
When using Seka. the programmer ﬂicks between a full
screen editor and a command window in which single
keypress commands invoke both assembly and ﬁle
management. Various assembly options, such as listing
output to the printer, are available,
The neat text editor lacks the sophistication of Ed but is
functional. Some two dozen pseudo operators can be
inserted in the assembler listing providing things like
conditional assembly (IF, IFR, ELSE, ENDIF), macros and
printer output.
The debugger can examine memory locations and
registers, edit contents, disassemble code and single step
through a program. Interesting Seka acts both as assembler

and linker, accepting linkable code while assembling source
at the same time.
The Seka manual packs alot into its 35 pages including
brief appendices o n  AmigaDOS libraries and 68000
instructions but there is only one short example program.
Devpac
Hi-Soft's Devpac is the lastest assembler release and the ﬁrst
to use Amiga windows and pull-down menus in the editor.
Devpac comes recommended from the Atari ST and Hi Soft
proudly tell us that Argonaut used Devpac to write Star
Glider for ST and Amiga. Devpac provides the editor,
assembler and debugger. Pull-down options have key press
equivalents and the editor is a window which can be resized
and moved around like other Intuition window. Proper
requesters prompt for user input and the actions o f the
assembler can be setup from an 'installation' program as
well as from within.
The assembler, Genamiga, includes features such as
conditonal assembly, macros, position dependent code (for
ROM or other micros), printer controls, title strings and the
ability to include standard libraries of code from speciﬁed
directories. There are conditonal assembly directives such as
if greater than', i f  string equivalent to  other string'.
Conditonal assembly is useful for debugging code in test
versions and writing for different machines,
The Devpac disk contains a range of include ﬁles, much
as on the Metacomco disk, but with directives in place of
macros and with comments removed. The originals are in
the ROM kernal manual. The assembler can be directed by
an OPT command to, among others, include debugging
information for Genmon, to list to a narrow printer and to

force position independent code. Each option has both on
and off settings.
Genmon, the debugger, lets you set breakpoints, single
step through the code, missing out operating subroutines if
required - examine and edit memory and registers.
Hi-soft have also provided BLINK, a public domain
linker which improves on the A LINK standard. Instructions
are found in text ﬁles on disk. The version of Devpac I
looked at (end of June) was provided with a modiﬁed
Workbench 1.1 and had a slight problem with Kickstart 1.2.
The user has to issue a 'setmap usa0' command before
issuing the GENAM command. I had to write an alternative
startup-sequence ﬁle with Ed.
The Devpac manual is desktop published and comes in a
ring binder. It provides a generous number of examples on
disk (e.g. using library functions to open a window or startup
in Workbench) as well as instructions on setup and syntax.
Appendices on AmigaDOS and on the role of libraries in the
operating system should prove especially useful for the
newcomer. The Motorola 68000 reference guide is sensibly
included.
Macro Assembler
To use the Metacomco assembler the programmer writes the
instructions in the Ed text editor, which is supplied as part of
AmigaDOS. The assembler is then called with the name of
the instructions ﬁle. The assembler command can take
various parameters such as source and object ﬁlenames.
veriﬁcation ﬁle, header ﬁle and equate ﬁle. There is a further
options parameter and ﬁnally the programmer can add a
directory list for the INCLUDE command.
Metacomco's assembler has a large number of assembler
directives for symbol and data deﬁnition, assembly control
(e.g. relocate origin, conditional assembly) and listing
control (e.g. NOPAGE to turn off paging). There are eight
versions of the conditional (e.g. LED - assemble if a label is
deﬁned, 1FGT - assemble if expression is >  0). There are
directives to change the program counter, to equate labels
with symbols, to list selected parts of the code, to set page
and line length and to print a program title at the top of each
sheet. References to linkable code can be made with XDEF
and XREF. INCLUDE combines selected ﬁles from disk
into the assembly sequence.
H A R D WA R E  R E V I E W

YOUR AMIGA september 1987

The Metacomco manual is stylishly produced in their
now standard A5 format. There are sections on the Ed text
editor, calling the assembler, controlling the assembly and a
brief introduction to the 68000. The assembler directives are
individually explained.
Macros
A macro is a labelled set of instructions which generates
object code when called. Metacomco's assembler is not
alone in supporting macros, both Seka and Devpac have
MACRO commands.
However Metacomco are justiﬁed in emphasising this
aspect of their assembler. The inclusion in MCC's assembler
of special text manipulating directives VALOF, STRLEN,
LEFT, RIG HT and M I D  (which work like their BASIC
equivalents) means that the macro can be instructed to
modify arguments appropriately by testing the contents of
strings passed to it.
lii both Genamiga and Metcomco's assembler macros
are deﬁned within MACRO...ENDM directives with
MEXIT allowing a quick exit after a conditional test. By
default, macro generated code is not included in a listing but
can be switched on by the appropriate directive.
Calls to the macro can pass variable arguments and a
special argument can produce unique labels within the
macro generated object code. In Metacomco's assembler up
to ten previously deﬁned macros can be called from within a
macro but nesting is not permitted. In Genamiga up to eight
levels of macros can be nested allowing recursion.
Conclusions
These three assemblers reﬂect the strength of  Amiga
software in general and offer an excellent choice for the
assembler programmer. However none of  the manuals
attempt to teach assembly programming so beginners will
require a suitable book.
Seka is an efﬁcient set of programmes, editor, assembler
and debugger, but you will have to become familiar with its
way of working. I didn't ﬁnd this a great obstacle with the
programmes, but feel that Seka's poor interaction with the
user clouds the abilities of the software.
The Metacomco assembler (09.95) is a very powerful
program with a set of sophisticated assembler controls
designed t o ease the difﬁculties of  development and
documentation. A further plus is the use of Ed, the Amiga
text editor, with which you may already be familiar.
Experienced 68000 programmers will want to take advant-
age of this assembler's sophistication.
Devpac (09.00) provides an 'Amiga style' editor which
is easy to use, a comprehensive set of assembler controls and
formatting options and a debugger. With its excellently
presented manual, Devpac is the best of the bunch for
newcomers to the Amiga and 680130.

We've reviewed some of the latest

A
the muddy :Airﬁeld. Algy shouted, "chocks away". Moments
later the engine seemed to burst into life and the plane lifted
away from the French turf, circling as it climbed and there
was Biggles waving to the crew below.
Another daring mission behind enemy lines had begun.
They . were waiting for  him, the Baron and his lighter
squadrons. the anti-aircraft batteries, his own bombs if they
failed to drop at the vital moment over the enemy factories.
aerodromes and supply depots.
The mountains ahead formed a massive backdrop to the
war-torn scene, the river streaked below indicating that
enemy territory was violated. There was no turning back.
If like me, you enjoy a good fantasy ﬂight to death or
glory then this is just one scenario you might corkiu re up fora
ﬂight in the Sub Logic II Flight Simulator on t) tir  Amiga.
The World War One Ace option is one of three possible
realistic aircraft simulators to choose from.
The Gates Learjet is the executive jet par excellence, the
ultimate status symbol f o r  t he American millionaire
businessman. You can enter its luxury cabin and sit at the
controls for a realistic and rapid ﬂight. Modern means more
complicated with more controls, longer ﬂights, the need for
navigation aids; basically i t  means more manual! An d
there's a keyboard reference card. It would he easier to tell
you which keys don't do something.
Good God, these guys have even had to stamp 'not for
use in real night situations' on the route maps they supply
with the game. ,iust in case someone gets it into their head
that 40 hours on the Sub Logic II Simulator qualiﬁes for the
real thing. The sampled sounds coming out of my stereo
could raise a few eyebrows in a high building, no problem.
But let's not get above ourselves. The Learjet is for
experienced ﬂyers. We must gain our wings in the popular
Cessna Turbo Skylane, a variant on the 182, the third
option. I think of it as the Fergie option. The old Cessna has
been Uround since the early seventies, not this one
particular you understand. The Sublogic Flight Si mulat or ip.
is perfectly safe, I think. A crash is in fact a bit ola relief aftty
the previously unrelenting realism.
The scenery appears to be inexhaustible. Perhaps it thins
out a bit as you move away from airports. but the disk drive
keeps whirring and it keeps on coming in three dimensions.
You can look at it from six different viewpoints, and line-
scroll or 700111 these viewpoints if you wish.
Also you can look at yourself - sounds crazy? Well you
can look at yourself from the control tower, tracking the
plane even when well in the distance or you can look at
yourself from a tracker plane set in motion at a constant
relative distance. It's like someone taking a movie of your

on somewhere near Champaign. Illinois (Sublogic's home),
it covers the entire continental United States and extends
well into Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean.
Airports and other features were digitised directly from
aerial photographs o r  taxi charts -  wow. Fortunately,
Sublogic don't expect vou to spend the rest of your life
around this world so they let you either 'SLEW' at high
speed to your destination or select •POSITION SET' and
manually set your co-ordinates. The maps help with some
example airports and areas.
Well, that's ail there is to it. The graphics can appear a bit
slow but resizing the main window helps. The sound is
superb, the detail enthralling, the scale exhilarating, the
documentation all-encompassing. I'll leave you in control
now. You are on the ground on runway 27 Right (that's a 270
degree heading, facing west) at Oakland International

tournament, seek a conquest or go raiding. Chivalry also
requires your presence at the tournaments of other lords.
The second action involves building a campaign army from

play. Robin of Sherwood's help can be enlisted in both.
A map can be studied to get more detailed information

against other warlords involve demolishing castle walls with
catapults and utilising Greek Fire (balls of burning pitch).
Various tactics are open to you both in overall strategy and
on the battleﬁeld. There's an initial opportunity to move
decisively to increase your territories and income from
taxation.
The defender of the Crown booklet adds to the fun that
' you can have with this game. As well as hints and tips there is
a bit of history, the myth of Robin Hood and the many ﬁlms
made about him.
Defender of the Crown combines strategy and stunning
visual sequences to impress and entertain the player. The
Cinema ware concept is  maintained with well prepared
documentation. claims of historical authenticit a n d  a long
list o f  credits f o r  production. music, animations and
artwork. The Amiga is ﬁnding work for a new brand of
artist-technician in the creation of these complex games.
For me the game lacks the edge which would force me
back to play regularly and I ﬁnd the ﬂoppy disk access delays
irritating. Cinemaware has something in common with good
board games and playing Defender of the Crown can be a
family affair or an evening in. Others I know however are
constantly raiding, jousting and fencing their way into the
charms (and arms) of the fair maiden in the castle.
It is interesting brieﬂy to look at the way Defender of the
Crown has been created bv the team of programmers and
artists. The standard graphics format known as !FT means
that pictures c an b e  swopped between programmes.
Artwork can be drawn in Deluxe Paint 2 or Aegis Images,
The animation of a burning ﬁre is achieved by painting in
cycling colours of yellow, orange and red.
The next stage of animation such as the catapult's pivot
or the maiden ﬂuttering her eyelashes within an essentially
still scene can be designed and perhaps even programmed in
a package such as Aegis Animator, Even more complex
animation such as the ,
similarly storyboarded. For realism. digitised pictures can
be combined with electronic painting as in the introductory
identikit pictures of the knights. In similar fashion, stirring
music can be written by specialists with programmes such as
Deluxe Music and incorporated into the game at  the
appropriate moments.
That then is  Cinemaware. Mindscape produce their
programmes across a range of computers but for them too
the Amiga offers the best opportunities to realise their
games' designs. Electronics Arts too have said that they can
do things with the Amiga which they cannot do with any
other computer, and that's why they continue to concentrate
their efforts on it, So close the curtains, get out the popcorn
and beer and settle in for an evening's entertainment.

The judge had a novel approach to trying cases that came
before him. Anxious to cut through as much red tape as
possible, a barrister was likely to be jailed for wittering on
about legal nicities. If you were ugly as well, then there was a
fair chance that the sentence would be doubled! The fact that
he was also partial to the occasional backhander made him a
ﬁrm favourite with the accused — unless of course they were

The Judge's theory went something like this. There will
always be criminals so why not bring some discipline to the
profession and form a Guild. It took some time and not a few
threats to bring this feat about, but RQQT managed it,
setting himself up as the head of the newly formed institution
according to the well-founded method of one man, one vote.
He was the one man and chose to vote for himself,
The Guild worked well until it was noted that few new
members were joining and membership amongst the old
guard was dropping off. It was eventually decided that this
was due to a somewhat gruesome initiation ceremony and
test of courage. The details of this are so gruesome that wild
horses would not make me reveal them in a family magazine,
although a sackful of used ﬁvers left behind the third basin in
the gents on Kings Cross Station might help jog my memory.
Sufﬁce to say, this method has now been dropped and a
simple practical test substituted.
The Guild of Thieves is the second adventure from the
pens of Magnetic Scrolls and looks set to consolidate the
success that they had with their ﬁrst game —The Pawn. Three
things set it head and shoulders above other games of this
type. The storyline, the parser and the graphics.
The game starts with you in a boat alongside a rickety old
jetty. A master thief explains that he has totally cased the
joint — in this case an old castle — and knows the value of
everything in the place worth nicking. All you have to do is
till your swag bag with the ill-gotten gains.
If you can get into the windmill, the owner is very glad of
your company and seems keen t o sell y ou a lute. The
problem here is that you don't have any money and anyway,
a thief would never buy anything when he could get it
dishonestly. There seems to be some sort of do on at the
castle, a reunion banquet of the 3rd Kerovnian Defenders,
and that proves to be the key to your gaining admission to
the castle.
A friendly guard invites y ou t o  a  rat race i n  the
courtyard. Perhaps that could be a source of money but not
wanting to leave anything to chance, you may want to
improve the odds by ﬁxing the race a bit.
As you explore the castle, the only obvious treasure
seems to be a platinum chalice but that is guarded by a huge
bear in a cage. The library is always good for a few clues as
you make your way through servants quarters, the billiard
room and the various bedrooms including one with a
retractable bed.
Outside, the main feature is a temple, complete with safe,

organ, garden and bee-hive and a  statue which, o n
examination does little for your well-being.

The location descriptions ar e excellent w ith some
marvellous touches of hymour. I particularly enjoyed the
description of a painting — a classic by Ripov, painted during
his dead period. The puzzles are original and the general
storyline more cohereent that in the Pawn.
The parser is quite simply the best there is, surpassing
even the mighty Infocom. It is a rare moment indeed when it
can't make sense of the gibberish that you have just entered.
The nice thing about this is that you start conversing
normally with the game rather than using *ad venturespeak%
there is a comprehensive editor as well, should you make a
typing mistake.
I have gone on record in the past for saying that graphics
have no place in adventure games. They should be text only
as pictures can never do justice to atmospheric location
descriptions. I t  is  eat my  hat time. The pictures that
accompany the game are superb. There is nothing else to say.
The game comes complete with the latest copy of What
Burglar magazine and your indenture forms. the magazine,
as well as acting as an anti-piracy device, contains some
lovely snippets. Anyone who has played the Pawn will be
pleased to know that Honest .John has now gone public and
is recruiting trainee salesmen. There is also a built in hint
sheet should you get stuck. Simply type in enormously long
passages of maeaningless characters and let the computer
decipher them. You will then get a cryptic clue that may or
may not prove helpful.
Is there nothing wrong with this game? Well, the optional
speech facility is naff hut that apart, I can ﬁnd no reason at

packaging formula of disk, novella, manual, keyguide and
poster effectively wor k  together t o  create a  software
'experience', something a bit more than just a game. The
novella is especially tied in with the game and you will only
know what it is you are trying to achieve and how you can go
about it by reading the story.

bravery of Kat ra and Jaysan as they try to defeat the Egron

minded android, AGRO. The male moonbasers are a little

SILENT SUBMARINER
re you a patient tactician with an eye for detail but also
A
an opportunist with a ruthless killer streak? Well, there's a
job opportunity for a submariner on an American sub-
patrolling the Paciﬁc Ocean. circa 1943.
Silent Service took a number of plays before it grabbed
me. One particular cat and mouse session with the destroyers
of an enemy convoy kept me playing into the night.
The game is based on accurate mapping of the war patrol
region. the Paciﬁc between Japan and Australia. a full war
patrol is  a good evening's entertainment. The manual
provides maps with convoy routes. naval bases and facts and
ﬁgures from history. You can also choose training patrols
and convoy action scenarios based on historical situations.
The scale o f  the simulation is  geographically and
chronologically accurate. But you don't have to spend 50
days at sea! The passing of time can be increased by up to 32
times 'realtime'.
The time of day is important. You can happily sail on the
surface during night at a maximum o f  20 knots. When
attacked during the day you have to operate below the
surface where you won't get above ten knots, and you have
limited staying power as the batteries drain.
The game reports actions such as sonar picking up
explosions. enemy ships and depth charges seeking out your
ﬂimsy hull, When you are in trouble you can blow the
emergency tanks to halt an uncontrolled dive or release
debris and oil to deceive the ships above.
On board your submarine you move between the map
room. the bridge, the periscope, a display of vital guages,
damage report and quartermaster's log. This process is
irritatingly slow because of the disk access involved. There's
no lack of excitement however when it comes to tracking a
target with the periscope, tiring the deck gun or launching a
torpedo on its way. The Torpedo Data Computer (an early
analogue device) gives you information on the target and
1.1)u make your calculations based on bearing, heading and
angle on bow. I f  they are accurate the torpedo will strike
home causing ﬂames and oily black smoke to burst forth.
The graphics o f  the bridge, the conning tower. the
submarine damage report and the maps are nicely produced
in different styles. There's a nice full screen graphics display
of the guages which show the current status of fuel, battery

charge, torpedos, shells, time, depth. distance to bottom and
so on. The enemy ships are less detailed but this serves to add
realistic difﬁculty to the game.
Sound effects include the low purring, acceleration and
deceleration of the engines, the gun ﬁre and torpedo launch.
You will jump out of your skin the ﬁrst time you choose to
dive and the claxon goes off.
As well as reasonable use of the Amiga's sound and
graphics the parallel keyboard and mouse/joystick controls
are very responsive, the manual is  superb with maps.

then Barbarian should suit your gameplaying style. It will
also introduce you to some of the best character animation
yet seen on the Amiga. O n seeing the game. the usual
reaction is • I must get an Amiga'. Barbarian lacks nothing in
panache, from slickly painted fantasy screens to animated
scenes with accompanying digitised cracks of lightening and
the rumble of thunder.
The game is an exploration and a mission. You have to.
destroy the lair of Necron and claim the Kingdom's crown. •
The ﬁnale involves ﬂeeing an exploding volcano against the
clock. Hegor moves around his world via a network o f
ladders, each full screen scrolling into view as he reaches the
edge horizontally or vertically, this involves the briefest of
pauses. The disk must stay in the drive because as you
progress further data is read in.
Control is by a means new to me. combining mouse

button and screen icon. By 'clicking' on an icon you can
make Hegor walk. run, jump. stop. move left, right, down
and thrust with his sword. One thing you will have to get
used to is the repeat effect of clicking the mouse on an icon.
This can lead to Hegor dashing in where sensible barbarians
employ a degree of caution. If Hegor tries to go beyond the
limit of a screen. he hits an invisible wall and jumps back in
hilarious fashion, smarting as though stung by a wasp!
The icons also offer the options to defend and to ﬂee.
What Barbarian would ever use that one? A second line of
icons gives you a score, lives left and allows you to pick up
and use objects found during the game, a bow is an essential
addition to the armoury but you'll have to take a few risks
and pick up some arrows too.
If r e a c t s  to commands in different ways depending
on the situation, a  normal jump becomes a gymnastic
somersaulting leap on a collapsing bridge. You have to avoid
falling boulders, scale ladders and deal w ith a  mean
menagerie o f  creatures intent on making sure you never
achieve 100% in this game. Getting a bow for  instance
involves lighting the tin man from Yellow Brick Road on one
side and a multicoloured leaping lizard/cat on the other.
Various grunts and groans are uttered by the monsters,
wraiths, werewolves, rock throwing beasts and armour
plated adze swingers. Hegor sighs heroically when *killed'
but is capable of all sorts of contortions depending on the

H A R D W A R E  R E V I E W

Amiga
System Time
t

A
continually rewrites and updates his
ﬁles giv ing them odd and cryptic
names w h ic h ,  a lt h o u g h  s eemed
reasonable at the time, a week later
always leave me scratching my head
wondering which of 'Program newer'
and 'Program latest' is really the most
recent version.
Fortunately for  me, AmigaDOS
has a feature which can save much of
this frustration. Whenever a ﬁle is
saved or rewritten to disk, A migaDOS
automatically stores the system time
along with the ﬁle, and this can be
easily accessed u s in g  t h e  L I S T
command from a CLI. In this way I
alwavs know which is the most recent
VCrSi011.
Of course, life is never really that
easy, I. like most Amiga users do not
have a hardware clock in MN' system
and s o every time the computer is
powered up. the date and time need to
be reset manually. This  is  not too
difﬁcult to do from a CLI using the
DATE command, b u t  i f  y ou ar e
working with the workbench then you
have to use the preferences program
which is  quite large ( >50K) and so
eats up masses of memory for storage
Unorganised — read on, discover the advantages of
getting the date and time from the workbench using the
Intuition gadget interlace capabilities.

and time for loading. Not good enough
I 'say.
'Well'. I hear you say. 'Why  not
modify your start-up-sequence ﬁle to
include the date command and prompt
for user input. In this way the date can
he set every time the system is started.'
(See listing I.)
Accidents can Ihippen
OK. this is true. I'm glad to hear that
you are all tirelessly delving into the
magical workings of the CLI despite
the considerable effort Commodore
seem to have put in to prevent we mere
users from even knowing it's there.
But, what happens i f  you make a
typing error (and believe me I often
dool) and enter an invalid date or use
the wrong format. Yes, date returns
some enormous error code, the system
gets confused a n d  t h e  command
sequence is terminated immediately.
This leaves you to set the date. load
the workbench and close down the
CLI manually — which quite frankly is
too much work to expect. This may
sound lazy to you, but what do you
expect from someone who won't even

take the trouble to give his ﬁles logical
names.
*So what is the answer?'. I hear you
cry while desperately waiting for me to
get to the point of this article. What all
this has been leading u p  t o  is  a
program which allows you to get the
date and time from the workbench
using the Intuition gadget interface
capabilities.
Such a  program would be more
efﬁcient than loading in preferences
with the thousands of bytes it requires
to reconﬁgure the rest of the universe.
In fact, why not write the program so
that it will also run from a CLI. In that
way you could call it from the start-up-
sequence and hav e a  mor e error
tolerant way  t o  set the date upon
power-up.
The program is presented in listing
two a n d  i s  wr itten i n  assembly
language f o r  t h e  Seka assembler.
Assembly language was chosen over C
simply because i t  is  faster, more
compact and cheaper (which makes it
a little more accessible to most Amiga
users), and because I don't have a C
compiler. I n  addition, t h e  Seka
assembler can be easily used on a
system without an external disk drive

Programmers cast their vote!
Right now, leading software developers
are hard at work on the next generation
of Amiga® products. To add the
spectacular sound effects we've all
come to expect from Amiga software,
they are overwhelmingly choosing one
sound recording package...
FutureSound. As one developer put it,
"FutureSound should be standard
equipment for the Amiga."
FutureSound the clear winner...
Why has FutureSound become the clear
choice for digital sound sampling on the
Amiga? The reason is obvious: a
hardware design that has left nothing
out. FutureSound includes two input
sources, each with its own ampliﬁer,
one for a microphone and one for direct
recording; input volume control; high
speed 8-bit parallel interface, complete
with an additional printer port; extra
ﬁlters that take care of everything from
background hiss to interference from
"Open the pod bay doors, HAL..."
the monitor, and of course, a
microphone so that you can begin
recording immediately.
What about software?
FutureSound transforms your Amiga
into a powerful, multi-track recording
studio. O f  counie, this innovative
software package provides you with all
the basic recording features you expect.
But with FutumSound, this is just the
beginning. A  forty-page manual will
guide you through such features as
variable sampling rates, visual editing,
mixing, special effects generation, and
more. A  major software publisher is
soon to release a simulation with an
engine roar that will rattle your teeth.
This incredible reverberation effect was
designed with FuturtSound's software.

Question: What can a 300 pound
space creature do with these
sounds?
Answer: Anything he wants.
Since FumreSound is IFF compatible
(actually three separate formats are
supported) your sounds can be used by
most Amiga sound applications. Wi t h
FutureSound and Deluxe Video
Construction Set from Electronic Arts,
your video creations can use the voice
of Mr. Spock, your mother-in-law, or a
disturbed super computer.
Programming support is also provided.
Whether you're a "C" programming
wiz or a Sunday afternoon BASIC
hacker, all the routines you need are on
the non-copy protected diskette.
Your Amiga dealer should ha$e
FutureSound in stock. II not, just ghe
us a call and for the ne l o w  price of
£175.00 Inc. VAT in cash with order
sw'll send one right out to you. Ahead

(which I don't have either).
I don't intend now  t o  give a
detailed description o f  h o w  t h e
program functions, t h e  comments
included i n  t h e  lis ting should b e
sufﬁcient for any interested person to
work out what is going on, provided
they ar e familiar  w it h  t h e  basic
concepts of structures and library calls
used in Amiga assembly language, and
the differences between r u n n in g
programmes from the workbench and
from a  C L I .  T his  i s  particularly
necessary knowledge when using the
Seka assembler which does not come
supplied with the standard Amiga
include tiles.
If you are not familiar with the
particular peculiarities o f  Amiga
assembly language then I suggest you
write to the Editor of this September
publication a n d  demand t h a t  h e
publish a series of articles to clarify this
topic. You could even mention that I
am available at modest rates.
Rack to the point — basically, this
is what the program does. It opens a
window (in the upper left-hand corner
of the workbench screen) in which the
current date and time are displayed.
Above and below each o f  the day,
month. y ear. h o u r .  minutes  a n d
seconds, displays are arrow shaped
gadgets whic h, when clicked ov er
using the left mouse button, w ill
increment the day, month. etc.
In this way thedate and time can be
set to the desired values. This does not,
however, change t h e  system t im e
immediately. To do this it is necessary
to click t
'SET' gadget in the lower left of the
window. This converts the new date
and time into system time.
Next to the 'SET' gadget. there is
another gadget marked 'SAVE' which
can be used to update the system time
on the disk. When the Amiga is booted
It looks on the system disk to ﬁnd when
the last ﬁle was saved. It reads this
time, adds a few seconds and uses it as
the system time. T he save gadget
simply writes a n empty ﬁle called
'DateStany' into the root directory of
whichever disk is in drive DEO. The
idea of this is that if you don't set the
time, then every time you boot your
system disk the system time will at least
be set later than at the last ﬁle save.
Thus each tiles date stamp, although
not the correct time, w ill give an
indication of the order in which ﬁles
were created.
H A R D W A R E  R E V I E W
HOWCVer. care should be taken in
using this process, particularly if you
use more than one boot disk. If, for
example, you boot from a disk which
you haven't used for a while and then
'LIST' ﬁles on another, more recently
used disk you will ﬁnd AmigaDOS will
mysteriously dis play  t h e  t im e  o f
creation as 'future' as if it is trying to
predict what you will be working on at
some later date.
If you know save a ﬁle onto this
disk with the 'future' tiles it will be
stamped with the system time and the
disk will not preserve the correct order
of creation.
Thus, the SAVE function is only
included for completeness hut it is a
better ideal always to set the correct
time upon start-up.
Finally, when you've ﬁnished with
the program just click on the standard
close window gadget. The window will
disappear a n d  t h e  pr ogr am w i l l
terminate.
Using it yourself
To use this program yourself all you
need t o do is type it in, assemble it
and it will be ready to run from a CU.
If y ou wis h t o  us e i t  f r o m t he
workbench then create an appropriate,
info, ﬁle  us ing t h e  Ic onEd t o o l
supplied with the workbench disk and
you're away. I  hope you ﬁnd it as
useful as I do. Ciood lock, and may
time never run backwards for you.

he Amiga is the graphics microcomputer par excellence
T
with a number o f  powerful and highly rated paintbox,
technical drawing and animation programmes. The latest
'effects' program from Eagle Software is now available in the
UK from Arithmos Software. Rather inappropriately, but
shockingly titled 'Butcher', the program comes complete
with axe screen icon which chops down when double clicked!
Butcher provides a  number of  special effects for an
IL BM (IFF Interleaved Bitmap) format tile. Thus pictures
from Deluxe o r  Aegis packages can be imported for
attention. The simplest feature to use and one of the most
useful is  that o f  printing a selected part o f  the screen.
including H o ld  and Modify  screens. I n  this  way  any
rectangular shaped window can be dumped to a printer
supported by Preferences, black and white, colour or laser,
either in a standard or enlarged format.
Butcher will load different screen modes and convert
between H A M  and lo w  resolution w it h  and without
interlace, This will be particularly handy for Deluxe Paint
users. Dpaint 2 users can change screen format. Butcher will
not load the 320 by 340 full page or 352 by 240 full video
formats. Butcher provides basic line, rectangle and freehand
drawing f o r  retouching purposes. T he picture can be
reversed or ﬂipped a very fast operation.
Any picture on screen has a default palette. Butcher can
adjust the palette and you can maintain three different
versions in memory. You can also save them. You can work
on individual colours picked from the screen pixels or
modify factors such as RGB mix and hue saturation value
over the whole range. Colours can be sorted by intensity,
copied and 'spread' between two speciﬁed colours. Butcher
will also 'map' one palette onto another for a closer match.
The mos t s tunning effects available ar e edging,
pixelating (called mosaic) and ﬁltering. During the edging
process Butcher decides whether any particular pixel is part
of an edge by examining its neighbouring pixels. You can
control the threshold at which Butcher will judge the pixel at
sufﬁcient variance with its neighbours to be plotted as the
edge. The resulting effect sharpens the picture.
Pixelation i s  t h e  conversion o f  the picture in t o
rectangular 'titles', a favourite effect in the printing industry.
A variety of tile sizes are available, but I felt the smallest
possible was not quite small enough. Filtering again looks at

the individual pixels, removing any isolated groups from the
picture. The size of group and the area of picture processed
are both under user control.
Butcher offers an insight into the way an Amiga screen is
built up, offering the ability to change the number of bit
planes displayed. Ea c h  screen p ix e l h a s  i t s  o w n
corresponding bit of data. A 320 by 200 display has 64,000
individual pixels per plane (8.000 bytes o f  memory). A
histogram of the different coloured pixels can be displayed
and colours from any clipped (selected) part of the screen
merged, exchanged o r  sorted. These sometimes drastic
changes to a picture can usually be restored because Butcher
retains a backup bitmap.
Despite t he lacklustre packaging, Butcher proved
exciting software for anyone manipulating graphics on their
Amiga. The processes are basically those used in much more
powerful systems in the printing and video industries and are
therefore educational as well. Anyone contemplating desk
top publishing or presentation graphics will ﬁnd Butcher can
liven up their screens.

graphics with drawing and painting
commands available in Basic, Unfor-
tunately it  does not have hardware
sprites and so it is difﬁcult to produce
convincing animation.
The following ' program, written
mainly in Basic uses the technique of
cartooning to produce movement in
hi-res graphics. Six different pictures
are repeatedly displayed on the screen
giving the effect of repeated motion.
Operating in text mode the Pitts /4
(or C16 with a 64K RAM pack ) has
60671 bytes free t o  Basic. This  is
situated in the 64K of RAM from 4K to
64767. The RAM below 4K is used by
the text screen, the operating system
and Basic itself. Above 64767 are the
graphics/sound c hip registers a n d
other I/0 devices.
When a graphics mode is selected,
the RAM from 6K to I6K is reserved
for the 2K colour map and 8K bit-map.
The start of Basic is moved up to I6K.
This leaves 2K of RAM unused from
4K to 6K.
If the top o f  Basic is set to 6K
before selecting the graphics mode. the
start o f  Basic remains a t  4 K  and
extends to 6K. So the 2K of RAM is
regained for the Basic program.
This leaves enough R A M  free
above 1 6 K t b r  ﬁve additional 8 K
graphic bit-map screens which the
graphics chip can be directed to look at
in addition t o  the normal bit-map.
Each b it - m a p  screen shares t h e
original colour map from 6K to 8K.
Program Description
The program starts ( line 105) by
setting the pointers to the top of Basic
to 6143: this will ensure that Basic is
located between 4K and 6K when the
P

movement in hi-res mode is still possible, as this
program shows.
By Barry Dunntall
hi-res bit map mode is selected with a
GRAPHIC I  command later in the
program.
In line 115 the variable GC is set to
65298: this  is  t he address o f  the
graphics chip register. The contents of
this register must be changed when it is
required to look at a bit map located
somewhere other than the normal 8K
to I6K.
Lines 130 t o  140 are a  routine
which P O K  Es a  m a c h  in e c o d e
subroutine into memory at locations
818 to 860 (the start of the tape buffer).
The routine, when called with a SYS
818 command, will copy an SK block
of a RAM from 8K to I6K. the normal
bit-map location, to a start address
POK Ed into location 827. The data for
the code is in lines 145 to 170.
Lines 185 to 210 are where the bit
map pictures are drawn and copied
into the appropriate locations. The
variable SC is set initially to 5 in the
FOR-NEXT loop; this  means that
screen 5 will be drawn and copied ﬁrst
Followed by screen 4 down to screen O.
Screen 0 does not in fact need to be
copied but is  copied t o  itself as a
convenience.
Line 195 calls the subroutine which
draws the picture for the appropriate
screen number (SC); this routine starts
at line 705. You will notice that all
drawing commands are referenced to
the screen number: this is a COnVell lent
way of controlling what is being drawn
and also means that you will be able to
produce a complicated picture within
the 2K o f  Basic R AM available by
calling the same subroutine six times
with only SC' being changed.
After each picture is  drawn the
copy subroutine is called (line 205):
this is situated at line 345. First the
destination address is poked into 827,
the required value being completed
from the screen number: the mach'
code subroutine is  then called wi
SYS 818 in line 355.
When all the bit maps have bee
drawn and copied, a subroutine to s
the colour map is called in line 225: tin
routine is situated at line 505.
You will recall from earlier that a
the bit maps share the same colon
map located between OK and 8K. Th.
is necessary because there is  t
enough continuous R AM left in t
machine t o  provide a  separate
colour map for each screen.
The implication of a shared colon
map i s  t h a t  c o lo u r  m a p  cells

the bit map must be appropriatley s

ﬂow would you like to marry someone lacking these?
So off she goes to rebuild her hubby. First she will need to
get the right keys to open doors to different parts of the castle
- there are seven altogether but she can only carry one at a
time, which makes things difﬁcult.
She will also need a shovel to dig the graves and get the
second-hand bits and bobs from the corpses.
Another important item is the lamp which you will need
in order to enter the crypts which are otherwise totally black.

YOUR COMMODORE september 1987

If you manage to ﬁnd the pickaxe you can have a smashing
time in here, and you may even be able to defend yourself
from the ghouls and skeletons which scare you slowly to
death.when they touch you. •
You are given only one life to complete the game, and
this is represented by a beating heart, that beats faster and
faster until it explodes, depending on how many times the
ghouls touch you.
The castle is made up of 60 rooms which are full o f
puzzles and traps, it will be a long while before you manage
to explore them all.
The sound is not too bad, with a few spot effects and the
sound of your heart beating which adds to the atmosphere of
the game. On the title screen a rendition of toccata plays
with Frankestein chained to the wall in the top.of the castle
with lightning ﬂashing now and then.
Frankenstein is not a bad game, although it does grate a
little in the lives department and can be quite frustrating at
times. A few times F had all the objects, only to enter a room
and get trapped in the door by a ghost (most annoying) and
killed almost straight away. F promptly turned it  off in
frustration, only to load it up half an hour later.
All that aside, I enjoyed Frankie's Bride, the game is very
addictive and not for the weak-hearted.

known children's program. Witc-A-Day ran a cartoon series
called the Gobots. And almost a year on they are still
,showing it.
The cartoon tells the story of two. kinds of robots, the
good guys are the Gobots and the bad. guys who are
controlled by the evil Gog. They have been sworn enemies
for,many, many years and now the evil Gog has decided that
he wants to take over the Earth.
He has built huge bases on the Mobius planet, which will

produce clones of your good buddy (true American style eh!)
Scooter. Ile will then use these to cause havoc on the Earth
and give the Gobots a bad name.
•
important Gobot, Leader One, sets out to put an end to these
evil plans and to rescue Scooter. Being a M obit's planet it has
a ceiling and a ﬂoor and both have gravity — very weird,
Your objective is to destroy all the green bases in each
wave of the game. To blow these to bits you will need to pick
up the Scooter clones and they will become missiles which
You can use to wipe out the bases. While you are doing this
you are being constantly attacked b y  helicopters and
meanies which try to ram you There are also robots that
beam from one surface to another and they cannot be shot,
so avoid them.
Throughout the game you will be harassed by a large
number of aliens and robots, which makes the game harder
as you go along.
I was impressed by the game as it was original in the way
it is played. with the Mobius planet.
I can recommend Gobots to you, especially if you are a
fan o f  the cartoon. Another addictive and playable game
from A riolasoft.

Ultimates Knite Lore: remember the game that caused a stir
on the Spectrum with its wonderful graphics and superb
gameplay? Not to worry though, it's better than Knite Lore,
so read on.
You play the part of two characters — one called Head
and one called Heels. Apart. they are pretty useless, but
together they make a great team, and that is your ﬁrst task:
to get them back together.
You are sent to the rebel slave planets by the people of the
planet Freedom. with Head and Heels being highly trained

t last one o f  my favourite arcade games has been
A
released, if you haven't seen Stoplight in the arcades where
have you been for the last year, huh?
Slaplight does not involve any slapping or such like, in
fact it does not refer to the game at all, which is a fast and
Furious shoorem-up.
The idea is to pilot a slow-moving spacecraft across an
alien planet, with the goal being to reach a giant complex in
the centre of this strange world and blow it to bits.
As you can imagine this is not an easy task as there is a lot
of ground to cover.
You can build up your spaceship by collecting stars that
are dropped when enemy ships are shot, but not all of them
drop these. The weapons available are: speed, which will give
you up to ﬁve times the normal speed (depending on how
many stars you pick up); shot will give you normal ﬁrepower
if you have lazer or ﬂ; missiles; side will give you power
beams on the side of your ship which will melt any alien that
gets too near. The Wing will extend the size of your ship and
enhance your ﬁre by one: bomb is next but this is a weak
weapon and iffy to use. The next is the lazer which ﬁres an
invisible beam, a good buy. The Homing Missiles are the
ultimate weapon, press the button and eight missiles will
zoom into the targets - brilliant. Last but not least comes the
Shield, get his and you won't have to worry about getting
blown up by aliens (for a while anyway).
I enjoyed playing Stoplight as it's addictive, colourful.
and most importantly close to the arcade version. The music
however is dreadful and bland, no doubt you'll be racing for

I've just played Hades Nebula and I can't stop. This is the
new game from Nexus, and a very good one at that. The
story behind this awesome game goes like this. It's 2124 and
not a good year. Just about everything that makes life
pleasant is running out or running down. The serious people
at WE C  (that means Wor ld Energy Committee) have
formulated The Plan to get round the problem.
The plan is WEC Colony plan, it involves ten really big.
like mega-huge, colony ships. They're going to use a Meason
Accelerator (a go-faster gadget) to throw them to the far
corners of the universe. A long way, 'cos that's where the
energy is.
Well, that was the idea, but thanks to the totally evil
overlord Hades, all your ﬂeets were killed off. leaving only
you to brave the long journey that lies ahead. You must
penetrate his Kingdom that although once peaceful is now
crawling with aliens intent on blowing you to bits.
While you try to avoid the aliens and their lasers you must,
also shoot panels on the ﬂoor which contain gadgets for your
ship. released by the rebel miners enslaved by Hades. There
are quite a few extras that can be used for your ship such as
Speed, which will double your speed. Also rotators, which
can be ﬁtted to the side or front of your ship, which will kill
any foolhardy aliens foolish enough to get too near. Lasers
come in ON 0 forms - tri-lasers, which ﬁre in three directions,
and normal lasers, which will ﬁre upwards killing any aliens
that cross its path, (gasp!).
You can also have Warp, which will warp you out of any

tricky spots that you may get yourself into. Powerwings are
next on the menu and, these will increase your lire power
vastly, but they also make you more vulnerable as the ship
will also grow in size.
I liked Hades Nebula very much as it has that 'just one
more go appeal, Als o some stunning graphics mixed in
with a touch of good presentation, which left a nice taste in
my mouth.
I would not recommend this if you already have Tera-
Cresta or games or that kind, but if you haven't then get this.

QUARTET
hen terrorists capture a space colony there's only one
thing you can do. send in the Quartet (the galactic equivalent
of the A-Team). Edgar. Lee, Mary  and Joe form the
meanest, toughest and deadliest team in the Universe (it's
just as well they're on our side) that are the stars of the four
player coin-op game Quartet. In this C64 conversion either
one or two players can play one or two of these heros and go
iind trash some space pirates.
Although zapping the pirates forms an essential part of
your mission the real task is to get through the game's 22
levels. To complete a level you must battle your way through
past the hordes of pirates to the exit that's guarded by a giant
mechanical monster. Destroy this with several repeated hits
and you'll get the key and a bonus score.
Each level consists o f  a series o f  sideways scrolling
screens reminiscent o f  Gremlin's Future Knight full o f
platforms and ladders for you to climb around and doors for
the pirates to stream through. Help is at hand either from a
second player who should work together with you and not
dive in to steal the objects that might keep you alive long
enough to complete the level. These objects include springs
to give you extra jump, shields to protect you for 15 seconds,
jet packs to reach the parts other players can't reach and

war but as an ofﬁcer you set about your duty to plan and
execute the great escape!
The POW camp you're i n  is an old castle. that's
surrounded on three sides by sheer cliffs and the sea and is
packed w i th  patrolling guards l e d  b y  th e  camp
Kommandant. There are, of course, other prisoners but most
of them have been here too long and just follow the roll call,
exercise and eating routine of prison life. If you don't do
something quick you'll slump to that level as well and the
game will end.
As the game begins the camp security is fairly slack and
you should follow the routine to plan when you're least
likely to be missed. During these times you can slip off
unnoticed to do some exploring. During these excursions
you'll ﬁnd objects that may be useful as well as some of the
tunnels that form a labyrinth under the castle and your best
chance to get to key off limits areas and ﬁnally to escape.
If you miss roll call or are found in the wrong place then
the alarm will go and if caught you'll spend the night in
solitary and lose some morals. This starts at 100 and drops
when you're caught, but can be topped up by ﬁnding objects
and exploring. However, i f it gets too low you'll ﬁnd it
difﬁcult to regain control of your prisoner as he falls into
depression.
Actually mounting an escape attempt will take planning,
the right objects and the knowledge and timings of guard
patrols. Get it right and you could be home soon but get it
wrong and the war for you will be over.
A great game from Ocean.

old rubbish it was, but I persevered and it began to appeal to
me. The ﬁrst thing I  noticed was the tiny graphics and
matchstick man, then a smart tune started to play and when I
moved the tiny ﬁgure the animation was great (impossible
mission style). So I  started to play, got killed and had
another go. and it went on like that for quite a while.
But sadly it proved too hard for me as I kept getting stuck
in the same place, which was quite annoying.
But don't get me wrong, I still like it, as it's one of those
games that you keep coming back to.
You play the part of Joe, a man who has it made. He has
his very own multi-million pound complex hidden deep
underground. One day, however Joe wakes up t o ﬁnd
himself' with a hangover from the bubbly and discovers
hundreds of aliens have invaded his home. So what can he
do? Escape from his paradise.
Apart from the Spectrum 'Tiny Char' graphics, this
game doesn't look too bad.

they do that' or 'why didn't they leave out the fourth level?'
People who played Revs did: they sent in their suggestions
and have had them included in Revs +.
The original Revs was undoubtedly the most realistic
C64 racing game when it was released last year. Since then
players have realised that you had to be a world class racing
driver to play it! It featured an incredibly detailed version of
the classic Silverstone course with every bend i n  lyre
squealing detail mainly due to  a certain David I  lunt
Iformula three racing driver and James Hunt's brother)
helping out with the game.
Revs + has all those features plus a few new ones to help
the beginner and four extra tracks to tackle the experts. Now
you can play Revs + with any joystick or the keyboard and
beginners can enjoy the luxury of assisted steering to get you
around the tricky corners. Plus, once you've mastered both
Silverstone and Brand's Hatch you can try out Donnington
Park, Snetterton and Oulton Park as well as the Nuberg Ring
which is widely acknowledged as the toughest drive in
Europe.
Revs + is fast and realistic (once a car is overtaken it
stays overtaken and doesn't teleport to meet you around the
next corner) and it's nice to be able to use an ordinary
joystick, but why didn't Firebird get it right the ﬁrst time?

WIZ
here are two worlds of lightness and dark that touch on
T
the Magical Isle. Evil is pouring forth and even you, a mere
ﬁrst level wizard, can see that some monumental cataclysm
is likely to be forthcoming.
The only people who don't seem able to see are your
masters, the council of Wizards. They seem content to play
at ostriches and stick their heads in the sands. Nor are they
too pleased when you decide to take matters into your own
hands. They cannot prevent you from advancing as a wizard,
but they have removed your protective shielding so that you
become vulnerable to attack.
Any wizard worth his salt must have a ﬁne collection of
spells at his disposal. You start off with a few written into
your spellbook and can learn others from itinerant wizards
that you meet on your journey providing that you have
enough power to assimilate the magic runes. You need to be
careful which spells you learn though for your spellbook
will only hold 20 different types. These include zap spells.
teleports, tree pruning, bridge repairing and turning yourself
into an evil proof bunny!
Runes are the stuff of which spells are made and you
must learn how to assemble the ones that you want. Each
spell has a formula — a sequence consisting of four different
rune types. There is a limit to how many runes you can keep
stored and others have to be acquired by use of, surprise,
surprise, a rune spell. This kills baddies and converts them to
runes but only two types can be found on each plane of
existence.
It is essential to prepare your spells quickly for if you stay
in one place too long, a Tracer appears. This malevolent
beast is indestructible and will follow you on your journey.
The best that you can do is to temporarily blast back to the
Planet of Darkness.
The game itself is a Gauntlet clone with a top-down view
of your surroundings. The graphics are large and clear and
the puzzles lobe solved, combined with the use of magic, add
a pleasant twist to a well worked theme.

Probably not.
The racing track consists of four lanes that are graded
from the easy inside track to the almost suicidal outside
track. Unfortunately, the track appears on the screen as a
featureless blue band that then turns green behind you as
you can see through your rear mirror. Most of the game
involves swapping tracks to avoid or blasting the hazards
that appear before you.
The most deadly objects are walls that destroy you on
contact that are joined by one other skimmer that you must
kill or be killed and mines that must be blasted before it
blows you up into tiny pieces. Luckily, there are also ammo
dumps to restock your weapons and warp gates to get you to
top speed.
The whole game is as ﬂat as a pancake (rather than a
doughnut) and would barely survive as a budget game. At
£4.99 it's no bargain and about as exciting as a wet August

For any of you who missed the original games, WCLB is
a golf simulation. You must select your club and then judge
the power and timing of your swing in order to hit the ball to
the best effect. There are the usual hazards of water, sand
and trees to be avoided as you hack your 'way round the
course, trying to achieve as low a score as possible.
WCLB offers you four courses, three taken from real life
(St_ Andrews_ Doral Country Club and Cypress Creek),
together with one especially constructed for the occasion —
The Gauntlet. There is also a partial course designer with
which you can access any of these 72 holes and put together
your own courses. You can make minor changes to these
holes such as changing the type of trees but, somewhat
disappointingly, you don't have complete control of what
goes where. No doubt that will come out in the next version,
There are three skill levels to choose from — kids, ama teur
and professional. With the courses being as tough as they
are, you have to be pretty good to play at professional level.
Whereas on previous versions, I could blast my way round in
just about level par, my ﬁrst two rounds here were plus
twelve and I'd rather not say.
One reason for this is that you don't now get any
assistance when you are putting, as to how hard you have hit
the ball. The sliding scale stops after the ﬁrst marker leaving
you to judge the rest. Not having read the instructions and
thinking that it was a bug, my ﬁrst putt took me straight off
the green and back into a bunker!
Other features include a top down view of each hole
available at the press of a key. driving, practice putting
ranges and print-out facilities.
The big question with WCLB is should you buy it if you
already have one of the earlier versions. If you enjoyed the
game, then my answer is yes. This is sufﬁciently different to
give value for money. If you don't already own a golf game,
then I have no hesitation in recommending this as the best
and most challenging game you can buy. Until the next
version comes out (  how about a  Martian course with
variable gravity?)

BALLOON CHALLENGE
here have been simulations covering all forms of air
transport: helicopters, jets and even gliders. With Richard
Branson attempting to cross the Atlantic in a balloon, you
might be forgiven for assuming that Transatlantic Balloon
Challenge was in the same sort of mould. How wrong could
you be.
Instead, Virgin Games have come up with a  truly
dreadful arcade game. The idea is to cross the pond before
R E V I E W S
your rival does. So far, so good, but the plot soon takes a
nosedive, as credibility is  stretched t o  limits previously
unsurpassed in the annals of computer games.
To start with, you don't actually get to play Richard or
his rival. You take on the part of an eagle. Your task is to
defend y our  own balloon while also try ing t o  create
maximum trouble for your opponent (either human or
computer). You are not just an ordinary eagle though. You
do have a sonic beam capability and must use this to the best
of your ability to defend yourself against incoming missiles
and planes,
will give the odds of 1000 to I that you cannot guess
how the planes will try to destroy your balloon. Give up?
They drop paint on you. I suppose on reﬂection, this is not a
bad idea. Defences against the heat seeking missiles are
straightforward but you name me one airforce that can
defend itself against a paint attack.
While all this is going on, you must also try to catch any
passing boys who happen to be holding on to a bunch of
balloons. You may have assumed that the main balloon is
incidental to all this, but you must still try to navigate it as
best you can by altering its direction and height. These are
controlled by a series of icon situated at the right of the
screen.
This method does not work particularly well with the
wraparound system of movement used. Your eagle is too
sluggish to give you proper control (the penalties of sonic
beam perhaps?) A fourth icon allows you to pass into your
opponent's half of the split screen display but in practice,
you don't have the time to bother. Gameplay is reduced to
the level of farce.
There is an old joke that says that there will be no money
left in the world by the year 2000 because Richard Branson
will have it all. Don't add to his cause by buying this
rubbish,

Ever heard of 'indirect indexed addressing'? In this
article on machine code programming we will discover
all about it. and ﬁll the whole screen.
By Burghard-Henry Lehmann
So the task o f  the machine code
programmer is a bit similar to that °fa
ﬁrst-form primary teacher whose job it
is to give a class of youngsters their
ﬁrst t i m i d  steps i n t o  elementary
arithmetic. The simpler the steps, the
better!
Programming i n  machine code
means doing an awful lot with precious
little to start with. And this is where the
real challenge lies.
Task 3
With this in mind, let us return to the
practical programming theme w ith
which we started off in the last two
articles. All the time we have been up
against one of the major limitations of
the 6510: the fact that all the pro-
grammable registers of the 6510 can
only hold numbers in the range of 0 to
"55.
In the ﬁrst article, this was no
problem because all we did was output
a number to the ﬁrst location of the
screen memory — 1024. This is called
(Awhile addressing and is very straight
forward indeed.
In the last article we output a byte
to a series of successive locations. For
that we in i n d e x e d  addressing
which allowed us to ﬁll 256 locations
of the screen.
And there we had to stop, not just
because the editor wouldn't allow me
to ﬁl l  o n e  whole issue o f  Your
Cominothwe, b u t  because we came
right u p  against the mos t obvious
limitation o f  the 6510, the fact that
neither the X-register n o r  the )(-
register can hold more than 255.
In this article we want to go the
whole hog and ﬁll the Commodore
screen, But  the whole Commodore
screen holds 1000 bytes — way beyond
the limit of any of the 6510 registers.
So what can we do?
There is, of course, a way of doing
it and this is called indirect athkessing.
Indirect Addressing
This s ounds  l i k e  a n  undercover
operation o r  something a  mathe-
matician does to his salad, doesn't it?
But it is based on a very simple idea:
use one location to point at another
location.
Look at it like this: you are in a
strange city and have to ask somebody
where the railway station is. Maybe
you ask a policeman. If you are a long
way away from the station the friendly
bobby might give you a whole string of
directions, "Turn left and then right
and then left again ,
Maybe our policeman is not only

helpful but also a bit of a psychologist.
He realises that there is a limit to the
number of left turns and right turns
which anybody can memorize. So he
says: "Go to such and such a street and
then ask another policeman." In other
words, the policeman is pointing you
to a location where another policeman
will direct you to your ﬁnal location.
This is precisely what happens in
indirect addressing: we want to output
a byte, let's say, to the beginning of
screen memory, which is  1024. But
instead of giving this location directl>
to the microprocessor, we give it in-
directly, that is, we load 1024 into one
location and then we point the 6510 at
that location, which we in c a l l  the
painter-kwation. I n  other words, we
tell the microprocessor the location,
where it can ﬁnd the location, where it
can get the data from (or output the
data to).
At this point, dear reader, you arc
permitted a gasp of sheer incompre-
hension: even though you will doubt-
less understand the above concept, you
will as k , " W h y  t h e  hec k  w o u ld
anybody want t o do a complicated
thing like that?"
But the whole point of indirect ad-
dressing is that it overcomes the major
limitation of an 8-bit microprocessor.
Since we are using one location t o
point at another location, this pointer
location can be made to point at any
location in the computer.
The reason w hy  the novice i n
machine code programming seems to
build u p  a  k ind o f  mental barrier
against the concept of indirect address-
ing lies in the fact that it seems to be so
unnecessarily complicated. Why  not
use absolute addressing and add any
number to that? But this is precisely
what the 6510 can't do. By putting the
address o f  a location into another
location we making it into a number
Like any other number. And that the
6510 can deal with, or, more correctly.
you can write a program which will do
the job. As we will ﬁnd out later, there
are instructions which allow you to
add a n d  s ubtr ac t number s  o f
practically any size. But the 6510 does
not allow you do do that directly to the
address of a location. You ﬁrst have to
make it into a number like any other
number. A n d  this  is  what indirect
addressing is really all about.
Suppose I  p u t  1 0 2 4  —  t h e
beginning of screen memory —  into
the pointer location, s o i t  is  now
pointing at 1024. I want to move 500
t)tes up. which is ()I course was over
M A C H I N E  C O D E  P R O G R A M M I N G
the limit of any 8-hit register, so I add
500 t o 1024, giving 1524. Now the
pointer location will point at 1524‘
which is exactly what I want. And if I
add one to that, it will point at the next
location. namely 1525 and so on.
This system gives me access to the
whole memory range of the computer.

something I  j u s t  c ouldn't hav e
obtained w i t h  either  absolute o r
indexed addressing.
The basic obstacle when pr o-
gramming in  machine code is  that
there are more things you can't do than
things you can. So you have to get used
to inventing ways of doing what you
basically can't do, with the few things
you can do. It's  a bit like building
Westminster Cathedral out of match-
sticks o r  constructing a  v ac uum

Index —
There ar e o d d  moments i n  6510
machine c ode programming when
there are actually some attempts made
to m a k e  l i f e  e a s ie r  f o r  t h e
programmer! Indirect addressing is, as
you might imagine, one of the most
often used instructions of the 6510 and
the c ons ider ate engineers  w h o
designed the thing have added a n
indexing facility to it.
Above I  explained that we can
make the pointer location point to any
location in the computer by adding or
subtracting any number to it But since
we have to do this in the form of a
program with extra instructions, it can
also be pretty cumbersome. Imagine
what would happen every time we
wanted to ﬁll successive locations! We
would have to add one to our pointer
location with every pass through our
loop, which would waste an enormous
amount of time and memory.
So indirect addressing is indexed
with the help of the Y-register. This
means that we have to add or subtract
only ever 256 bytes. Within 256 bytes
— or a page, as it is also called — we
can index in exactly the same way as we
did in the last article.
But there are a couple of rules to
indirect indexed addressing (aren't
there always!)The pointer location has
to be a location in zero page. that is, it
has to be between location Oand 255 in
the computer. As a trade-off for this
limitation we get the advantage that
the whole instruction uses only two
bytes.
YOUR COMMODORE septemher 1987
99
And, secondly, unlik e indexed
addressing the uses of the X-register
and the Y-register are not identical. If
you use Y, then the contents of the y-
register are added to the contents of
the pointer location. But if you use X.
the contents o f  the X-register are
added to the pointer location it s elf
not to the contents of it.
Since, as I can tell you from experi-
ence, indirect-X addressing is  used
very little, you might as well forget all
about i t  for  the time being. (As a
matter o f  fact, indirect-X isn't used
once in the whole of the Commodore
ROM, and I  am still looking for a
machine code routine which uses it ...)
On the other hand, indirect-Y is
used constantly in 6510 machine code
programming, so you had better ﬁx the
principles of it ﬁrmly in your mind: a
location in zero-page is loaded with the
address of the location where the data
is to be found and the Y-register is used
to index 256 bytes of the contents of
the pointer location.
And to close the "theory" section
of this article: in assembly language
indirect indexed addressing is  con-
ventionally expressed by  putting the
address of the zero page location into
round brackets and then a comma and
then the Y afterwards, e.g. :"(251,),Y"
or, if  you use a label "(LABEL).Y".
And, if you should ever use it, indirect-
X is expressed like this: "(251.X)" or
"( LABELX) ".
Back to Work
After all this dry theory. let us now
return to our programming task and
see how we can use all this in practice.
Listing 1 gives you the assembly
listing of a program which will ﬁll the
whole of the Commodore Screen.
Zero Page
In lines 90-170 I initiate the pointer-
locations in zero page which will be
needed f o r  i n d i r e c t  i n d e x e d
addressing.
In 6 5 1 0  mac hine c ode p r o -
gramming z er o page has  special
relevance. Since the 6510 has only
three programmable registers ( A, X
and Y), there is no room to store data
even t e m p o r a r i l y  i n s i d e  t h e
microprocessor. The 6510 makes up
for this lack of' registers by using the
locations in  zero page as what one
might call pseudo-registers. That is,
you may see zero page as a kind of

extension of the 6510. For this purpose
all instructions concerning zero page
can be given without the high byte of
the location: i f  it is  zero page. it's
included i n  the instruction and the
6510 will know that it is zero page. This
saves you one byte.
Secondly, all zero page instructions
take less time to execute. So, if you
want maximum speed of execution use
zero page whenever you can!
Thirdly, as we have already found
out, when you want t o use indirect
indexed addressing you have to use
locations i n  z er o page as  pointer
locations!
But you have to be aware that both
the BASIC' interpreter and the Kernal
use zero page locations for their main
system variables. So me  o f  these
variables ar e v ital f o r  the proper
functioning o f  the Commodore 64.
For example, if you wrote unwittingly
into location 1, you might switch the
whole o f  the BASIC interpreter and
the Kernal off so that, when you want
to return to BASIC, there will be no
BASIC to return to! This, of course,
will result in a massive crash, because
you w ill be unable to communicate
with the computer any more!
Other zero page locations you can
use quite happily: locations decimal
251-255 are completely safe because
they aren't used at all by the operating
system. If you use a disc-drive you've
got a  whole number o f  zero page
locations which are only used for tape-
operations (146. 150, 155, 156, 158,
159, 166-179). I also use locations 73-
'28 quite a lot. They are all right, as
long as you don't use the ﬂoating point
calculator o f  the C 6 4  and don't
intermix BASIC with machine code.
Low Byte/High Byte
In line 90 I do something which, on the
face of it. I shouldn't be able to do at
all: u s in g  immediate addressing
(preﬁxed with #  " )  I  load 1024,
which is  o f  course a I6-bit number,
into the A-register! How can I do such
a thing when I havesaid, over and over
again, that none of the registers of the
6510 can hold numbers greater than
255?
Well, notice the "<"-sign before
"1024". T his  has special relevance
here! With it I tell the assembler not to
load t h e  whole o f  1024 in t o  the
accumulator, which would surely give
me an overﬂow, but only the low byte
M A C H I N E  C O D E  P R O G R A M M I N G
of 1024, which is  1024-[(1024/256-
256l= O.
Then I load this low byte into the
ﬁrst of the zero page locations I have
chosen: 251. In machine code 16-bit
numbers a r e  always wr itten i n t o
memory with the low byte ﬁrst and the
high byte following after that,
The low byte of a 16-bit number is
of course the remainder you get when
you divide the number by 256. The
number o f  times vou can divide the
number by 256 is the high byte.
In line 110, I instruct the assembler
to calculate the high byte of 1024 by
putting i n  front of  1024 — and.
again, load it into the accumulator,
The high byte of 1024 is 1024/256=4.
T her efor e, 4  g o e s  i n t o  t h e
accumulator, and fr om there i t  is
transferred into the second zero page
location (in our case decimal 252).
Now zero page locations 251 and
252 are pointing at the beginning of the
Commodore screen memory. In other
words, zero page location 251 holds
the low byte of 1024 (=O)and zero page
location 252 holds the high byte o f
1024 (=4).
In lines 140-170 I do the same thing
with t h e  beginning o f  the c olour
memory. This ﬁnishes the initializing
part o f  our program. N ow  we can
begin the action, starting from line
210.
Since we have to ﬁll 1000 bytes and
can index up to 256 bytes every time, the
obvious way to do the job is in four
goes. This will of course result in an
additional 24 bytes being written into
since 2 5 6
can be quite casual about this. Nothing
vital will be overwritten by those 24
bytes.
At other times you have to be more
cautious and do the job exactly right.
On the whole, stick to the rule: always
be aware that strange things c an
happen if  you write unwittingly into
certain locations!
In line 210 1 set up the variable
which I use as the counter of the four
blocks. I  use the X-register for that,
because in this routine I won't need it
for anything else. Furthermore I count
downwards a s  they  d o  a t  Cape
Kennedy. T his  saves me  a n extra
instruction, because when the count
reaches 0 in line 380, the zero-ﬂag will
be set and the 6510 will leave the loop
and exit.
Next I  zero die Y-register (line
220), which does the main character
count. W i t h  ev ery  pass thr ough

We start off with 1024 and the Y
register contains O. So when it comes t
line 240 the microprocessor gets ilk
value 1024 from zero page locatio

Y-register to it. Therefore the outp

Now the contents of the Y-regist
is 1, and this is added again to 1024
giving 1025. which of course is the no
position of the Commodore screen.
And so it goes on, ﬁlling the ﬁr
256 positions of the screen. Since t

Waiting for a Break
In order to make our program more

routine at the end which makes it yvait
for the RUN/STOP-key to be pressed.
Without this you would get the Com-
modore 'Ready' message and cursor

any time to admire the full page you

This is  a  loop which loads the

into the A-register and tests it against

If loc ation 1 4 5  contains a n y

In this case the zero-ﬂag will be clea red
and it will jump back to the beginning
of the loop in line 420.
If, on the other hand. location 145
contains 127, then that means that the

Now i t  w ill compare w ith the

he idea of the whole program is to select the model you
T
want to make, set it up, and then print it onto normal printer
paper. That is then the computer's job over. It is now up to
you and your creative abilities to produce an accurate
model, Not only are these models nice to look at but they are
also working models. Some of them are just made from the
paper, but for the more sturdy models you stick the paper to
the card before cutting it out.
A very extensive manual is included in the package, along
with three disks, adhesive-backed card, wooden dowels
pieces of wire, rubber stripping, cotton cord and balloons.
The manual has easy instructions for using the program and
then a detailed construction guide for each model. All you
need to supply is the computer, a printer and some glue and
paper clips. (The package gives a list of the printers that can
be used.)
Design your own
The selection of drawings and modiﬁcations is carried our
with easy-to-use menus. It you have quite a creative mind
you may not be happy just doing the set models, so for you
there is a chance to customize and adapt the models. So
though there are only plans for 20 models there are hundreds
of possible variations. You can add personalised text,
change fonts and type style and alter print patterns.
There is an option in the program to browse through the
whole selection of toys and models. You will be shown a
detailed picture and description of each one, and using this
you can decide which model you would like to make, ﬁnd
out how easy or difﬁcult it will be and what materials you
will need. I f  you know beforehand what you would like to
make, you can go straight to an alphabetical list and select it
from there.

Having made your selection you can then either print,
customize or load your choice. The load option allows you
to re-use your own customized model which you previously
saved on disk. There are nearly 40 print patterns for you or if

own print patterns from scratch. (Rather you than me.)
These you can then save on a separate disk to be used again.
After all. why waste your creativeness!

select 'print' from the menu. You can print up to nine copies
at any one time, and you can also select certain pages from
each model to print out rather than the whole thing. This is
especially useful if you spoil or loose one sheet. To ﬁnd out
which speciﬁc sheet you need. there is an index at the back of
the manual showing a full layout of each sheet.
The printout times are probably longer than you are used
to They  range from about eight minutes for the simpler
models, to about 20 minutes for the more detailed ones.
Putting them together
The second part of the manual, the construction guide, gives
detailed instructions on how to put each model together and
provides a photograph of each one, so you can corn pare your
end result with what it should look like! The models range
from easy, medium and challenging so i f  you are a bit
clumsy. like me you might be as well to start at the begin ning.
As already mentioned some of the models need to be made
from the card. I t  will say on each sheet whether this is
necessary or  not. Should you run out o f  card, more is
available in a reﬁll pack.
Alternatively y ou can use ordinary card and spray
adhesive. When you have printed out the pieces you can
colour them before assembling them, with either coloured
pencils, water colours, oil paints or felt pens. An alternative
is to print the models on coloured printer paper.
Fun can he had by all
You may think all this sound like Blue Peter. with their
sticky-back plastic, but believe me it's great fun. I'm not very
artistic but I had a great time producing these models. You
have to be patient as some of them are complicated and if
rushed will not look very good. It is great fun for adults and
children alike and will provide hours of entertainment! The
package is quite expensive at around E40 but having looked
at it I think this is reasonable, especially if it keeps the kids or
husbands quiet!

e submit transient command is at
T
h
least as powerful as the PIP command.
What it allows you to do is to make up
several C P / M  commands i n t o  a
sequence o f  instructions. The most
common use is to start off a complex
program where a number of terminal
options need to be set, or other system
changes made.
The c ommand tak es  t h e  f o r m
SUBMIT name.SUB: this will read the
ﬁle 'name' and execute the commands
in it as if they were entered in at the
keyboard. The difference between this
and t h e  G E T  command i s  t h a t
SUBMIT is  muc h mor e powerful,
particularly in its parameter passing
and actual operation of programs.
The objec t ﬁle  c ontaining t h e
commands is  usually entered using
ED, as discussed last month. It's usual
to end its name with SU B,  the ﬁle
extension whic h tells  the SU BMIT
command that this is a SUB ﬁle. An
example of a SUB ﬁle (which well call
WS.SUB) might take the form:
ERA ﬁle.BAK
REN ﬁle,BAK ﬁle.TXT
B:
WS
Typing S U B M I T  WS,SUB w o u ld
rename a commonly used text rile, set
the default drive to B: and start up a
word processor — nothing complex in
that. GET could have done the same,
and probably faster.
Suppose, in the same example, we
didn't k now  the name o f  the ﬁle
that we wanted to back-up: we would

need t o  use the parameter-passing
option. Parameters are typed in after
the SUBMIT command SUB ﬁlename.
Up to nine parameters may be passed
and they are referred to by the names
$I, $2. etc, to $9, $1 being the ﬁrst
parameter

lithe example ﬁle above is changed
to the following:
ERA $1.BAK

it will deal with any text tiles. Now
typing SUBMIT  WS.SUB ﬁle w ill
perform the same function as above,
but S U B M I T  WS.SUB Fred w i l l
perform the same function but with the
name fred instead of ﬁle.
The astute reader will have spotted
that t his  method makes i t  rather
difﬁcult to use dollar signs normally
when you don't want to use variables.
This is overcome in CP/M by typing
two dollar signs, S$, which will get
replaced by a single dollar. S. when the
time comes.
11 you wish to direct control of an
actual program, a  slightly different
method must be used. Take the follow-
ing example:
PIP
*
DER
This, as a SUB ﬁle will enter PIP and
copy the contents of one drive over to
another. The less than sign. < , must
precede all in-program commands. A<
on its own is taken as a carriage return.
The SUBMIT command is a form of
RSX as discussed in an earlier install-
ment, SUBMIT commands, as well as
the cruder G ET  commands can be
nested so that they call each other, but
eventually you run out or memory.
There is  a  special SU BMI T  ﬁle
which must be called PROFILESUB_
This SUB ﬁle is called when CP/M+
ﬁrst starts up. this can be used to
personalise your system.
Programming in CP/M
CP/M was originally designed to make
the programming o f  the Intel 8080
microprocessor slightly easier than
typing in hex codes.
CP/M provides all the routines
necessary for all the basic computing
functions or twinratives as well as some
fairly complex dist handling and some
crude editing facilities.
To program in CP/M you need to
know t w o  things  —  h o w  CP/NI
operates, and how to program in 8080
or Z80 code.
CP/M is  similar t o  many other
operating systems in the way that it
performs tasks: ﬁrst the user sets up
various parameters, calls the appro-
priate routine, and then the OS carries
out the task: the OS returns to the user
either with the results of the task or
some helpful (one hopes) informatioo
about why the task wasn't completed
successfully,

Examines the ﬂags or register state
The C64 Operating system works
along these lines: you set up registers,
and then call an address where the
routine is stored or  where there is a
jump to where the routine is stored.
You have t o  keep track o f  all the
locations o f  t h e  r out ines  a n d
addresses.
The BBC  mic ro (which is  very
similar to the C64 in hardware terms)
uses a different system; the OS keeps
its own table of where the routines are
stored, and can keep track of changes
in the memory map. As a result, you
make the same call whatever changes
may have been made to the memory
map, and the OS does not have to be
altered to take account.
Because CP/M was designed from
the s tart t o  b e used o n  different
systems with different conﬁgurations,
it uses the same method as the BBC (or
rather, the other way round).
The actual operating part of CP/M
is held at the high end of memory. but
the ﬁrst 84100H bytes of memory are
reserved by the system. One of these is
the place to call for your OS function
— 8z0005/1 actually.
The C  register is located with the
number referred to the function that
you want to perform. A. D. and E, are
loaded w i t h  d a t a ,  t h e n  ' C A L L
8c0005H is  all you need to perform it.
The A  register then returns with the
success status of the instruction.
When C P/M ﬁrst came out with
V1.4, it had 27 instructions. V2.2 had
just under 40, whilst CP/M+ (V3.0)
that we are using has about a hundred.
This isn't the biggest CP/M version
though: M P / M  I I  -  the multi-user
version o f  CP/M h a s  around 150
commands available!
As an example, consider the most
simple OS command in any operating
system — outputting a character to the
screen. A  quick glance at our CP/M
programming manual reveals that the
code f o r  this  i s  8c02H, a n d  t h e
character to be output must be held in
the E register. The code for this could
look like this:
LD Elz.21H
LD C,&0211
CALL ez0005H
This would print an •1' on the screen
taking in t o  account scrolling and
pauses from the keyboard.
A s lightly  m o r e  c omplic ated
function would be to print a string on
the screen. This has 8z09H as its code:
code L B  DEJxt
I.D C8z091-1
CALL '&000511
C128 C P / M  M O D E
In this case the D and E registers are
treated as  one 16-bit register and
contain the 16-bit address for the start
of the string. The $ sign indicates the
end of the text string. C, as usual, holds
the CP/M function code. However to
print a dollar sign on screen you need
to use function 02as above (nothing is
ever easy in CP/M1).
C for Control
As w i t h  a n y  system, ther e a r e
assemblers and monitors to help you
program i n  mnemonics and t o  test
your results. Howev er  w it h  t h e
standard CP/Tvl utilises MAC, ASM,
SID. DDT and the like there is a small
problem. They all work with 8080 code
rather than with Z80. There is no great
problem with this. You will just have
to learn 8080 mnemonics rather than
Z80 ones. It all produces the same code
in the end whether you use 'MO V
A,C'A OR 'I.D C,A'.
MAC,RMAC, and ASM all work
in much the same way. A ﬁle is created
with ED and the program is invoked,
assembling the program into a .HEX
ﬁle which can then be converted into a
program that CP/M can run. But it all
has to be in 8080 code. You will do
much better if you buy, or obtain via
public domain, a 'real' Z80 assembler.
SID is  the 'symbolic instruction
debugger' a n d  replaces the earlier
DDT o r  'dynamic debugging tool'
which was used on earlier versions of
CP/M and will not be discussed here.
There is also a ZS1D that uses Z80
codes rather than 8080 codes and is
much more useful.
Like I I  NI. t h e  C ommodor e
monitor ( and almos t every other
monitor in existence), commands are
entered in with one letter and some
data. T h e  table shows a  lis t o f
commands -  most o f  them will be
familiar to Commodore users.
YOUR COMMODORE september 1987
105
There are a  few more complex
commands, but they require a  full
explanation of MAC the 8080 macro
assembler and its  symbol handling.
and it's not worth it for 8080 code, The
commands in ZS1D arc basically the
same hut use Z80 mnemonics.
I hope you've ernoy•ed this  s hort
series on the 'hidden' side of the Cl28
and CP/M in general. With the advent
of the Amstrad range of CP/M based
machines. CP/M has received a new
lease of life and many programs are
now being re-released, as well as lots of
books being re-published.
If you have any problems or queries
with C P/M, then don't hesitate t o
write in ,  Unfortunately w e cannot
answer problems personally. but in a
few months we will run a couple of
pages with the most common queries
and answers.
CP/M is a ﬁne operating system if
put to the use it was intended for —

program is the comprehensive error-
checking system i t  employs. T his
warns y ou o f  minor hiccups before
they become major calamities.
Speedy  A s s e m b l e r  g i v e s
'intelligent' error reports, that is, there
are 26 error messages which tell you
clearly and concisely which error has
arisen. Most error reports are given
immediately after a faulty line has been
entered, and this will result in the line
not being placed in the source ﬁle. This
immediate error-checking system
speeds up assembly and prevents those
seemingly endless lists of error reports
which you might otherwise get after
the ﬁrst pass.
Futhermore, if  you give a wrong
command t o  t he screen editor o f
Speedy Assembler, there will be an
arrow pointing to the incorrect letter
or parameter.
All this  permits y ou t o use the
program right from Day One without
1 0 . W O M
having constantly t o  wor r y  t h a t
something might go lethally wrong!
The Assembler
Once you've used the screen editor to
create an assembly listing, or source
ﬁle, as  i t  is  also called, y ou can
assemble it into machine code straight
away. Since the whole program is
memory-based you d o  not have to
waste t i m e  lo a d in g  a  separate
assembler module into the computer.
The as s embler produc es t h e
machine code you want in a matter of
seconds, ready t o  be executed and
tested.
There a r e  ﬁv e  o p t io n s  t h e
assembler gives you: You can have an
assembler listing or , i f  you prefer
maximum speed, not. Furthermore
you can have the listing in hex or
decimal.
An important option gives you an
ENTER C M0  !
assembler listing (either in  hex  o r
decimal) but does not produce any
object code. There are times where this
option comes in very handy. This is
when you want to see how a particular
source ﬁle assembles but don't want
the object code t o  be written into
memory because it  might overwrite
something else.
The whole idea of the program is
that y ou can develop your machine
code with a  minimum o f  fuss and
without having constantly to save and
load. And since 'Speedy Assembler' is
so fast, you don't have to dread every
time you want to re-assemble a routine
after you have modiﬁed it
But there is  even mor e t o  the
package we are offering you:
Speedy Assembler includes t w o
powerful capabilities -  a  mas ter
symbol table and a  ﬁle catalogue
facility - which no assembler we know
of has got. These two Options have
been designed to assist the experienced
machine code proura miner who wants
to write larger programs, like arcade
games, w o r d  processors, m a j o r
utilities and so on.
The Master Symbol Table
The master symbol table is a second
symbol table which allows a linkage
between different source tiles. Unlike
the ordinary symbol table it is not built
up automatically. lnstead y ou can
decide w it h  t he help o f  a  simple
transfer facility which labels you want
to keep in the master symbol table.
Once a label is in the master symbol
table t h e  assembler takes i t  in t o
account just like any other.
This allows you to declare the main
variables used in your program once
only, and all subsequent source ﬁles
will b e  assembled w it h o u t  a n y
problems.
The master symbol table is also
very useful for jump vector table and
subroutine calls.
The Filecata log
The second advanced fac ility  o f
'Speedy Assembler' is the lite catalog.
This is a list of all the source ﬁles you
have designed so far, each entry
you the ﬁlename and beginning and
end addresses of the object code of that
particular source ﬁle. In this way you
get a complete record of the program
YOUR COMMODORE september 1987
107

you are writing which is constantly
updated by the computer. At a glance
You can tell how much code you can
add to a certain source ﬁle before the
adjacent object code is in danger of
being overwritten.
And because of the ﬁle catalog the
assembler is even able to give you a
warning error report i f  this should
happen!

Maximum Flexibility
Another aim of 'Speedy Assembler' is
to give as much ﬂexibility in memory
management as possible.
Memory management is  o f  vital
importance when it comes to machine
code programming. because unlik e
Basic you have to plan how to make
the best use o f  available memory,
especially i f  you are writing a large.
self-contained machine code program.
And as things go, however well You
plan your memory layout, in the end
things nev er  quite w o r k  o u t  a s
planned.
R E A D E R S  S E R V I C E S
This is  where the ﬂexibility o f
Speedy Assembler comes i n :  t h e
beginnings and endings of the source
ﬁle, t h e  symbol table, the master
mbol table and the ﬁle catalogue are
made visible to you and you can block-
move any of these ﬁles at any times to a
more suitable position. So if you have
to switch things around you can do it
with a minimum of fuss.
In addition to this all the above
ﬁles are constantly checked to see if
any of them is in danger of overwriting
another ﬁle or the program itself. And
before this can happen a warning is
given.
User-friendliness saves you a lot of
work in the long run!
Finally
There is much more we could tell you
about this  excellent machine code
development package. But in the end
there is no substitute for trying it out
yourself. And at £9.95 per copy well
be very surprised if you don't!

use the standard size Commodore text,
but this tends to look insigniﬁcant on a

With this program, you can create
titles t h a t  appear i n  double size

of standard text) with the addition of
smooth vertical scrolling. Even if you
don't hav e a  v ideo recorder, the
program is great fun at parties (what

and can be very useful at meetings.
The system is in two parts, the code
boot and the editor/scroller.
These Boots
The code boot will read in the machine
code and character data fr om the
DATA Matt:MOUS, and enter them
into memory. Type in the program as
listed, and then SAVE it immediately.
The code uses memory which overlaps
with that used by the program, so it is
initially relocated. I iowever, when all
the code is entered correctly, a prompt
will be given to save the generated code.

composing your ﬁrst title screen.
In Use
To use the system:
I. Load in the code generated by code
boot e g: LO AD "MC CODE",8,1
2. Type NEW
3. Load the editor (Part 2), and run it.
The screen will go white, and a black
square should appear in the upper left
corner of the screen Th is is yourcursor.
Messages may not be typed in, but only
up to 16 characters may be entered per
line. The cursor will not allow you to
advance past column 16 of the screen.
After typing in  each line, press
RETURN. This is very important as
each line is processed only after the
RETURN key is pressed. This editor is
a pseudo-screen editor, that is , i t
YOUR COMMODORE september 1987

behaves rather like the screen editor
you use to type in programs on the 64.
However, only alphanumerics may be
entered, and, only in upper case. In
addition. the ".", and "- " keys may be
used, not to mention spaces.
The cursor up/down keys do what
you might expect, allowing you to type
in messages down all 25 rows of the
screen. Cursor right also functions as
normal, but use the 'der key to perform
a cursor left. With a little practice, you
will be able to enter messages quickly
and efﬁciently.
This system can be used to produce
hundreds of lines of titles in onego,and
so I have allowed the screen to scroll
both up and down to enter messages in
the correct places.
One point to note is that the routine
will automatically centre the text on
screen when it comes to output the
ﬁnished product, so do not preceed
messages by leading spaces.
If you use the cursor keys to edit a
message, remember t o  press return
afterwards to reprocess the modiﬁed
line. Before pressing return, though.
move the cursor to theend of the line, as
otherwise the character that the cursor
is on and all characters afterwards on
the same line will be deleted.
When y o u  hav e entered y o u r
messages, you can view the title by
pressing the asterisk key.

The screen will clear and you will
receive a prompt for the speed of the
scroll. By pressing the c ursor down key.
you can alter the speed setting, which is
indicated o n  screen. There are two
speeds, 1 and 2. I is the faster. 2 is half
speed. Having made your choice, press
ret urn.
prompt will appear for the fore-
ground colour. A s  before, use the
cursor &war and return keys to make
your choice.
Finally, there is the background
colour to choose. Again use the cursor
down and return keys.
Now the screen will clear, and after
a few seconds the title will appear. This
takes about three seconds at speed 1.
and six at speed 2. The title will .ci'oll
smoothly up the screen, and when it is
ﬁnished, press the space bar. This
button can be used at any time while
viewing the title, 11
appear alter six seconds. press the
space bar and re-roll the titles (occas-
ionally, the titles will not appear, bta
this should ﬁx a).
Pressing the space bar will take you
to another menu where you can either
re-roll the titles, i.e. view them again,
or re-enter titles, i.e. return to the echt
screen.
From the edit screen, pressing the
left arrow key will take you to thi.
input/output menu. Here you have
several options:
save tide data just typed in using the
editor:
re-load such title data;
create a demo.
The ﬁr s t  t w o  options  a r e  s elf-
explanatory. Create-demo will allow
you to save your title in a form which
can be reloaded in a single ﬁle. and run.
Whether you wish to load or save
data, or to creak: a demo, you will be
asked to identity the type of storage
device you will be using. disk or tape.
The options will appear. and again.
cursor down and ret urn keysare used to
make the choice,
The system will allow for tape units
as well as disk drives of device 8 or 9.
The ﬁlename is required nex t To
avoid errors for disk users, the program
must have a ﬁlename before proceed-
itig. Only alphanumeric characters are
valid, and only up to .11 characters.
Finally, instructions will appear for
your option to set the storage device
and press return,
Note, however, that if you creak: a
demo. you should load it back with a
secondary address o f  zero: s o for
example, you should type in:
C64 P R O G R A M
LO AD"Fl LENAM E
or
LO AD " F ILEN AME
You should not type in:
LOA D"1
or
L O A D
as the demo will not run lik e this.
Nothing else is required for the demo to
run, so the scrolling system does not
have to be loaded ﬁrst.
With both the save title and create
demo routines riot quite the whole area
of text memory available isstored. Text
will be stored only up to the last line
before the line with the cursor on it. By
this I am referring to the lines for text
entry on the edit screen. So, if the cursor
is on line 3 of the text edit screen, then
on calling, up the save or demo routines.
only lines I and 2 are saved. This is to
avoid saving unnecessary memory, and
to thus reduce loading and saving
times.
The demo will, upon running, scrol
the title at the same speed and colours it
was saved with, and to stop scrolling it.
use the space bar. It can then be re-run
to play again etc.
As before, i f  the title does not
appear after six seconds. press the
space bar and re-run the demo.

Life-Savers
Whenever you go out for a drive in a
car you never have to reinvent the
wheel before you can get anywhere, the
wheel is here to stay. Why isn't it like
this with computers? Every time a
programmer writes a program he/she
will no doubt rewrite routines that have
been used many times before.
In the February 1987 issue of Your
Commodorewe launched a series titled
Machine Code Library where we were
going t o  publish machine code
routines th a t people ﬁn d  handy.
Letters ﬂooded i n  f r o m  Basic
programmers asking fo r something
similar for them, so here it is -a totally
revamped series - Life-Savers.
Within this series w e  will b e
bringing you a whole range of life-
saving information. We may produce a
machine code listing to read the error
channel on a disk drive or multiply two
TIPS A N D  T R I C K S
Looking for a Basic or machine code routine? Want to
know a speciﬁc POKE? We provide all this and more.
numbers together, a Basic routine to
print a  scrolling message could be
printed - you may even ﬁnd a series of
handy POKEs for the Plus/4. Just
what vie print is up to you, since it is
you the readers that we are relying on
for all of those invaluable routines and
interesting POKEs.
Cut it Out
Life-savers will be published in such a
way that they may be cut-out o r
photocopied and stuck onto a card
suitable for a card index box. This
means that you will always have useful
information a t your ﬁngertips. A n
index of the cards published will also
be printed on a regular basis.
Send it in
As mentioned above we are relying on
you the reader to make this series an
invaluable reference. We are relying on
you to send in all of those machine
code subroutines, sh o rt Basic
programmes and other hints and tips
for all the Commodore computers.
Ten pounds per card printed will be
paid to the author, of course longer
tips. etc, will be spread over more than
one card.
So get to it, get those hints, tips and
programmes sent off. A  cassette or
disk should b e  sent w i th  a n y
programmes, which will of course be
returned to you.

u may have noticed that our
Y
o
listings are free of those horrible little
black blobs which send you searching
around the keyboard for a suitable
graphic symbol. You may also have
noticed the funny numbers by the side
of each line of the listing. Fret no more.
it's all part of our easy entry aid.
Instead of those nasty graphics and
rows o f countless spaces in PRINT
statements and strings we use a special
coding system. T h e  co d e , o r
mnemonic, i s always contained i n
square brackets and you'll soon learn
to decipher their meanings.
For example, [SA] would mean
type in a Shifted A, or an ace of spades
in layman's terms, and [SA10] would
mean a row of ten of these symbols.
[S+21 means hold down the shift
key and press the plus key twice, It
doesn't take a great leap of logic to
realise that [C-F21 means exactly the
same thing except that the Commo-
dore key (bottom left of the keyboard)
is held down instead of the shift key.
If more than two spaces appear in a
statement then this will be printed as
[SPC4] o r. exceptionally, [SSPC4].
Translated into English this means
press the spacebar four times or in the
latter case hold the shift key down
while you do it.
A string of special characters could
appear as:
[CTRL N ,  DOWN2,LEFT5,BLUE,
F3.C3]
This would be achieved by holding

down the CTRL key as you press N.
press the cursor key down twice, the
cursor left key ﬁve times, press the key
marked BLUE while holding down the
CTRL key, press the F3 key and,
ﬁnally hold the Commodore key down
while pressing the number two key (C2
would of course make the computer
print in brown).
Always remember that you should
only have a row of graphics characters
on your screen with no square brackets
and no commas, unless something like
this appears:
[SS],[0]
In this case the two characters should
have a comma between them.
On rare occasions [REV T ] will
appear in a listing. This is a delete
symbol and is created by entering the
line up to this mnemonic. Then type a
closing quotation mark (SHIFT & 2)
and delete it. This gets the computer
out of quotes mode. Hold down CTRL
and press th e  number nine key
(RVSON). type the relevant number of
reversed T's and then hold down
CTRL and press zero (RVSOFF).
Next type another quotation mark and
delete it again. Now ﬁnish the line and
press RETURN.
A list of these special cases is given
in the table but remember that only
one o f  these mnemonics will appear
outside of a PRINT string: the symbol
for pi. This may appear when its value
is needed in a calculation so this may
look something like:
YOUR COMMODORE september 1987

:CC=2*[PI]*R:
Ignore the square brackets and just
type i n  a  shifted upward pointing
arrow (ie. the pi symbol).

At the start of each programming
session, load Checksum and run it.
The screen will turn brown with yellow
characters and each time you type in a
line and press the RETURN key a
number will appear on the screen in
white. This should be the same as the
corresponding value in the magazine.
If the two values don't relate to one
another. you have not copied the line
exactly as printed so go back and check
each character carefully. When you
ﬁnd the error si nply correct it  and
press RETURN again.
If you want to turn off the checker
simply type SYS49 152 and the screen
will return to the familiar blue colours.
You can then do whatever it was you
wanted to do and if this doesn't use the
area where Checksum lies you can go

No system is  foolproof but the

believe our listings are more reliable
than any other magazine in the world.

Commodore 128 Companion
BOOK R E V I E W S
Books
To keep up-to. date with what's on the
bookshelves, read on.
_y far the greatest challenge to a book reviewer is the
B
assessment of a dictionary. In computer terms the equivalent
is a book like the Commodore 128 Companion. It is by no
means a 'good read' in the conventional sense but to those
who need its  vast tables o f  memory locations, Basic
breakdowns and chip characteristics it will more than justify
the £10 price tag.
Despite the technical nature of the book, it reveals an
honest but critical approach t o the Cl28 and you soon
realise that this book has its roots in that noble fellowship of
Commodore users: ICPLIG (the Independent Commodore
Products Users Group). For example, the ﬁrst section is the
YOUR COMMODORE september 1987
122
usual appraisal of the 128 in the context of the wider world of
computers but does point out the failings of the machine's
CP/M mode. The 1571 drive will read from and write to
standard M FM system CP/M disk but cannot format the
wretched things!
Immediately you get the impression that this is not a
sycophantic stroll through the 128 but a serious attempt at
coming to terms with the machine's failings as well as its
undoubted assets.
The ﬁrst section of detailed information lays bare the
Basic implementation. Each keyword is dealt with in great
depth and the header to each page lays out all the parameters
relating to the word. The token value representing the word,
accepted abbreviation and syntax are supplemented by
further details of the location of the keyword in both 128 and
64 modeROMS in addition to the dispatch vector and actual
start of the ROM routine.
This gives way to a further exposition of Basic program
storage in memory and variable formats. Greater depth in
the description of ﬂoating point storage would have been
helpful in this section to further clarify a rather thorny
subject but this is glossed over as. usual.
It is outside the brief of such a book to give detail on
machine code programming, b u t  t o  those w h o  have
penetrated the mystic implementation of 6500 series coding
the location of kernal ju mp routines are detailed to enable
the serious user to crib ROM routines for their own use.
Again deeper penetration is inhibited by a lack of detail on
passing the essential parameters to these routines, but a bit
of ROM disessemblv would soon reveal the relevent memory
locations.
The ﬁnal section of the book looks at the hardware which
handles the software. A chip by chip architectural tour of the
innards of the 128 reveals which does what, where and why.
The appendices take the form of detailed maps of zero
page, Basic ROM and Kernal locations in both 64 and 128
mode.
As you can see, all of the essential elements of the C128
are dealt with to give more than a mere sketch map. The
book is a browsing reference book, absolutely essential to
anyone who needs a deeper understanding of this hunk of hi-
tech wizardry.

Science & Engineering for the Commodore
A
or a programmer interested in all? If so, this is the book for
you. I t  i s  n o t  a  book  o f  elementary mathematical
programming as handled by the C64. but is intended for
those interested in the techniques of programming which
handle more advanced equations.
The author has structured the book in a very detailed
manner and gives a complete analysis of the object of each
program p r i o r  t o  t h e  listings. Y o u r  knowledge o f
mathematics will determine how easy you will ﬁnd the book.
As most mathematicians know, the Chi squared formula in
statistics is  rilatively simple: getting the computer t o
interpret this, however, is a matter of some intricacy and it is
here that the author excels, The programmes themselves are
not lengthy, and the fundamental steps i n  advanced
equation techniques ar e w ell interspersed w it h  R E M
statements so that you know exactly what you are doing at
each step. The programmes which I  have checked are
without fault.
Well, what does the book cover?The initial four chapters
are a good general introduction to structured programming
in Basic and other languages. Inclusive of ﬂow diagrams; the
speed and accuracy of the C64 in mathematical computation
are discussed, while a comparative program of bubble, linear
and 'quick-sort' times is given. These chapters should not be
skipped, by any means as you will ﬁnd some good ideas and
suggestions in them. 
.
The m a in  par t o f  the book  i s  sub-divided in t o
mathematics, chemistry, physics, biology and technical
programmes. In all sections the programmes are well set out
and there is an appendix at the back for listing symbols.
MATHEMATICS: fourteen programmes ar e included
ranging from differentiation and numerical integration to
statistics, probability, binomial distribution, vector analysis
and matrix calculations. By far my favourite is the statistics
and probability section where randomness, Chi squared
calculations and Fourier analysis are deﬁned in full, along
with simple questions as sample entries. Vector analysis is
equally well discussed and routines for the more familiar
matrix calculations are not omitted.
At this point. I think it should be made clear that, while
most o f  these problems can b e solved using relevant
calculators, the programmes themselves are designed as sub-
routines t o  b e  inc orporated i n t o  o t h e r  teac hing
programmes. In other words, use them in conjunction with a
suitable hires graphics programme which interlinks with
Basic (Videobasic, Simons' Basic for example) to create your
own educational project. This applies to all sections in the
book.
CHEMISTRY: her e the author uses relative ﬁles t o
maximum advantage in a small database. Naturally, you will
require to store all the relevant data you wish in the database
itself (in this instance the elements and attributes of  the
Periodic System): depending o n  t h e  extent o f  y our
knowledge of chemistry, the database may be altered to your
own requirements. This database is then followed by a
'reading ﬁle' which will call up all the information you have
stored.
Other programmes in this section are a pH chart, a
Titration calculator and a rather hefty program on quantum
mechanics i n  relation t o  complex • molecular orbits o f
chemical elements! This is a real classic, providing data such
BOOK R E V I E W S
YOUR COMMODORE september 1987
123
as charge densities, free valencies, bond ordering and
electron energy. Printer output is provided here in view of
the large amount of data computed.
PHYSICS: the ﬁrst program here is a nice little insert to
bring you back into orbit. It uses the TI built-in clock to give
you a measurement of THREE overlapping times — try it.
Two other useful programmes here detail Optical Geometry
and Planetary Orbit Calculations.
BIOLOGY: represented with a single program involving
Dynamic Population Models. However, with what has been
detailed before in the other sections, it should not be difﬁcult
to create programmes involving rates of enzyme reactions,
etc. Indeed the scope is unlimited, if  use is made of the
statistical data in the mathematics section.
TECHNICAL PRO G RAMS: her e w e  hav e H eat
Transmission and total coverage of combination circuits in
relation t o  resistance, inductance, capacitance, serial
circuits, parallel circuits, branch currents a n d  node

don't know how to start can seek refuge in the Adventure
Gamewriter's handbook.
The book  contains a ll y ou need t o  k now t o  g o
adventuring on y our C64 and contains listings for  the
adventure editor to create your game, the interpreter to play

it and two sample adventures called Gold Fever and the
Enchanted Castle. T he author explains the sometimes
complex theory of adventuring clearly and consisely and
takes vou through a step by step guide on how to create an
adventure with examples all along the way..
The process naturally starts with the idea (for example a
haunted house or a quest), ﬂeshing out your idea to form the
plot, creating a map and programming these along with text
descriptions, special events, player actions and commands,
manipulating objects and limitations and counters.
The above theory is backed up with numerous examples
as well as the gradual buildup of the adventure Gold Fever.
Unfortunately, the book and its game system offers little
more than what already exists in programmes such as the
Quill and since they're ready to LO AD  in and go. why
bother buying a book to start from scratch? Starting from
scratch is not the only question but also E he answer as some
adventure authors think the Quill is too limited and will use
the book's system as a base to write their own systems with
the book as a tutor until they can go it alone.

Apart from an introduction explaining how the authors
could write a 300+ page book about a printer the book also
includes notes about interfaces. printer ROM listings and a
few useful listings.
Most of this is well written and at times a chatty book. It
would only  be used as a reference guide t o  check the
connections on an interface or to delve into the ROM of the
MPS 801 or VIC 1520 printer plotter. These heavy sections
are nestled between programmes to create 3D objects, screen
dumps, a simple text editor and poster size printouts.
However, the heavy technical sections and the light
reading( and typing) lie uneasily next to each other and feel
that the authors would have done better to write two
slimmer volumes, a beginners' guide packed full of useful
programmes and routines and a separate technical guide.
Since the two are mixed and the balance is towards the
technical I would suggest beginners follow their own printer
instructions and leve the rest to software packages such as
Print Shop and Rainbird's Art Studio.

m e m o r y  s e e m  i n s u f ﬁc i e n t .
Consequently, it is frequently necessary
to use some form of data compression.
In t h e  nex t f ew  Reliable Routines
articles, I  w i l l  giv e some s imple
routines f o r  the handling o f  data

There are Ehree main areas to be

I. T e x t  compression.

When you're trying to program a large masterpiece, the
C64's memdry capacity can sometimes seem very
limiting. Data compression could be the solution.

In this article, I will concentrate on
text compression.
In relation t o its usefulness, text
occupies a lot of memory and a more
efﬁcient storage method is frequently
necessary. One method is to replace
common words with a single byte, as in
Table 1.

Table 1
the
and
to
for
These frequently used words could
be replaced with a single byte with bit 7
set to distinguish it from ASCII codes.
So "the" could be replaced with 129
and s o  o n .  T his  is  t he basis o f
tokenisation used by Basic. With long
words, this is a very effective method
but since y ou c an only  have 128
tokens, the overall compression is only
about 20%.
There ar e s ome drawbacks i n
writing such a compression system:
1. Y o u  must sort out your list of 128
frequently used words.
2. Y o u  must tell the system how to
code upper case letters. You will
want to be able to use "the" and
"The", for example.
3. T h e  code will be quite long with
the need for a clever interpreter.
This system i s  quite complex.
however, and there is an easier way.
The Simple Method
The simple approach limits  you t o
31 characters but will sufﬁce for many
applications.
Imagine t hat  y o u  number  t he
alphabet from one to 26. In addition,
you number ﬁve punctuation marks
from 2 7  t o  3 1 .  Ea c h  letter  i s
represented by ﬁve bits even though it
occupies a  w h o l e  b y t e .  T h r e e
CM
YOUR COMMODORE september 1987
125
characters would occupy 15 bits which
could be crunched into two bytes.
Thus w e  achieve a n  instant 33%
compression from three to two bytes.
So how d o we d o  it? Consider
Table 2. i n  whic h t h e  ﬁrst three
characters of our list are shown.
First we lop off the top three bits of
each code value, as in Table 3.
The next steps are:
1. M o v e  the top three bits of the code
for B into the bottom three bits of
the code for A.
2. M o v e  the live bits of the code for C
into bits one to ﬁve of the code for
B and set bit zero of B to zero.
If we do this we get:
00001000 1 0
These bytes are then stored and
decoded on demand. Since all you
have is a string of bytes, zero bytes are
inserted i n  the encoded tex t as  a
sentinel. This is why you can only have
codes one to 31. If you were to encode
two consecutive c ode zero's, y o u
would create an erroneous sentinel in
the ﬁnal data. This may sound very
complicated but don't worry since the
routines given later handle everything.

The text compression will, if the text is
!mg, take a Few seconds. Once the
compression is complete you will be
given some statistics. You are advised
to note carefully the start address of
each block of code.
The test option allows y ou t o
conﬁrm that y our text is  correctly
compressed.
The SAVE option will save the
block of text speciﬁed. It will handle
code stored in addressed up to KET T
(53247), Any saved code can be loaded
into your own programs by:
LOAD -
or

The LO AD  option allows you to
resume coding at a later date. This
option does not t ell y ou the end

remember to write it down!
So how do you USC encoded data in

(advisable), the formatting and handling of work disks and
the creation of a 'letter ﬁle' disk. Read these two sections
rather carefully as there is a lot of  information here on
opening and closing of  ﬁles, ﬂipping, page reading, ﬁle
deletion, etc.
The 'real' handling of  GEOS starts at chapter three
through to ﬁve. It includes a detailed description of  the
different operations available to you in the system, with an
excellent selection o f  screen d u m p  illustrations t o
supplement the instructions. Indeed there are a total (484 of
the latter, which will give you some idea of the work that has
gone into writing this book.
Initially your screen has a display of seven icons (Geos,
Geos Boot. Geos Kernal, Desk Top, Geopa int. Geowrite
and Backup); this is called the Desk Top. The authors have
discussed these in considerable detail - so much so that you
should be joy-stick clicking in top gear by the time you have
read it all once, twice or three times. Certainly you will want
to explore more and more. Everything is here to give you a
complete grasp of all operative systems.
It has been said more than once, that GEOS is most
suited as a  word processor and not as an artist's tool
(perhaps such contentions were made with GEOS VI?). In
any event, read up the Geopa in Section where you will ﬁnd
that there is ample opportunity for artistry; all aspects of
painting, cycling, pattern ﬁlling, cutting, pasting. mirroring.
use of the 32 brushes available,etc, have been well described;
VI.2 is most certainly an artist's tool as the authors show.
Taking this a step further, there is a very good section on

'organising and planning with Geopaine. Here the authors
have extended the basic concepts t o  planning rooms,
gardens, schematic electronic circuits, etc.
Should you care to type in a program called Filemaster
(ten pages) -
your standard C 64 ﬁles t o  t h e  G EO S format; also
incorporated is a 'sprite designer' to create new icons. Again
this is fully described. Abacus Software have adisk available
with all the programmes in the book (Contact Adamsoft
concerning this if you wish to purchase the disk.)
Chapter six (Inside GEOS) is  fairly lengthy and is
intended essentially for the machine code programmer. A
single step simulator is listed for direct entry to memory with
a monitor. This should then be saved to disk, from which it
can be reloaded as a GEOS accessory in conjunction with
Filemaster. A  Basic loader is listed for the simulator. The
concept o f  the simulator is  t o  investigate the GEOS
operating tool and many facets o f  creating self-made
windows ar e detailed. A l l  this  is  fully  explained and
documented a n d  pr ov ides  t h e  pr ogr ammer  w i t h
opportunities to extend GEOS.
The book has a good glossary and is well indexed. It only
remains to be said that it is obviously of immense value to the
GEOS user, particularly in view of the non-prohibitive price.
A highly commendable book.

We have had a  number o f  queries
regarding errors i n  t h e  Cruncher
programmes printed in the July 1987
issue of Your Commodore.
There are no errors in the program
printed. However the variable L that is
set up to report the line number of any
lines with a typing error in them starts
off a t  t h e  wr ong v alue i n  b o t h
programmes. This  doesn't stop the
program from working. however, i f
you have made a mistake while typing
the program in. the program will give
you a n  incorrect line number f o r
correction. The lines to be replaced are
