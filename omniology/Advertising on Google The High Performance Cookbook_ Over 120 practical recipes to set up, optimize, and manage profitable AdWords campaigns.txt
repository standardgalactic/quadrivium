Introduction
This chapter covers the basic research we should conduct as we consider advertising with 
AdWords. Before we start competing in an online ad auction, we need to understand how 
saturated the market is and what our competition is doing in the online ad space. The first 
recipe explains how to identify our pay-per-click (PPC) competitors, while the next two recipes 
will help us analyze how much our competition is spending on AdWords. The final recipes will 
guide us on how to use this competitive information to set our own spend-and-bid goals and 
then calculate the potential return.

Focusing on relevance
AdWords is all about relevance and ensuring that Google users see quality ads, which directly 
relate to what the people are searching for. The system was designed to reward advertisers 
who create quality campaigns and is monitored through key metrics called Quality Score 
and clickthrough-rate (CTR). Focusing on relevance will help you pay less and achieve better 
profits from your ad efforts.
Getting ready
Keep in mind the following basic terms and concepts discussed in this book:
f
f
Keywords: These are words or phrases describing your products or services that you 
can choose to help you to determine when and where your ad can appear
f
f
Impressions: These are counted each time your ad is shown
f
f
Clicks: This is when someone clicks on your ad
f
f
Cost-per-click (CPC): This is the cost for each click on your ad
f
f
Pay-per-click (PPC): This is an online advertising model in which advertisers pay for 
clicks accrued
How to do it...
As you create your campaigns and plan AdWords strategies, focus on relevance by:
1.	 Achieving a high CTR: The general rule of thumb is to aim for a CTR of 1 percent and 
above, though CTR varies widely by industry and the type of keywords.
2.	 Keeping healthy Quality Scores: Once you create your AdWords account and start 
running campaigns, you'll be able to see your Quality Scores at the keyword level. 
Choose keywords that are relevant and have good Quality Scores and then refine 
those that do not.

Chapter 1

How it works...
Clickthrough-rate (CTR) is the number of clicks divided by the number of impressions.
CTR (expressed as %) = Clicks / Impressions
Each of your ads and keywords have their own CTRs, indicating how compelling users are 
finding your ads and keywords. CTR helps you gauge the success of your marketing efforts 
and it factors into Quality Score.
Quality Score is a measure of how relevant your keywords are to your ads and to your landing 
pages. It is calculated at the keyword level every time someone does a search for one of your 
keywords, and ranges from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest). Quality Score affects your ad position 
as well as how much you'll pay for clicks. Advertisers with higher Quality Scores are rewarded 
with lower CPCs and better ad positions.

Identifying your competitors using Google 
search results
Advertisers considering PPC ads need to understand which similar websites and businesses 
are already using AdWords, and also how they are positioning themselves in the online 
search market. This competitive information can be used to research keywords, which the 
competition is taking advantage of and identify our own unique advantages.
Getting ready
You likely already have a list of businesses that you consider your key competitors in a 
particular market. However, they may not all be advertising on AdWords. Armed with a list of 
websites you consider your competition, you can begin researching their online ad presence.

Researching the Market and Competition and Setting Goals

How to do it...
Start with a search on Google using terms that you consider your main keywords or ways that 
customers look for your products or services. In the following example, we searched Google 
for PPC ads to figure out which websites are coming up in both organic and paid listings.
Organic, or natural listings, are on the left below the search query, while the paid ads are to 
the right and potentially above the organic listings.
Take note of paid ads coming up for your key searches, including how many ads are 
appearing. Scroll to the next page of search results to see additional pages and websites that 
come up after the first page of Google's search results. The more ads there are, the greater 
the competition and the more saturated the market is for those keywords.
The paid ads that we see may not be the same businesses we identified as our competition 
prior to doing the search. Our competitors may not be advertising with AdWords or our search 
query may not be triggering their ads at the time of our research. You may also find new 
businesses that you were not previously aware of that you will be competing against.

It's also possible that your keywords are applicable to different industries and areas of focus. 
In any case, the ads that consistently come up for your most important keywords in your 
target locations will be your competition in the online ad auction, and you'll need to better 
understand their strategies to make your own campaigns successful.
There's more...
Perform the Google search, as previously explained, multiple times a day and on different 
days. Each auction is in real time and we'll likely see different results every time we search 
on Google. Your competitors' ads may or may not show when we perform a search based on 
their campaign settings, including during what days and times of the day they have set their 
campaigns to show, or what locations they have chosen to target via their campaigns.

The Using third-party tools to research competitors recipe
Using third-party tools to research 
competitors
There are a variety of tools other than Google that can help us get more information about 
websites whose online marketing efforts we are interested in researching further. Such tools 
scan the search results pages and extrapolate keywords and ads for various domains. They'll 
provide data such as keywords used, daily budgets, how much our competitors are spending 
on individual keywords, and history of budget and ad changes.
Getting ready
The following are a couple of popular PPC spy tools that will allow us to do basic domain and 
keyword research for free:

How to do it...
Use tools such as KeywordSpy and SpyFu to research competition as follows:
1.	 Search for your keywords of interest. Following is an example of results for a keyword 
search on KeywordSpy and the free information the tool provides. For example, you 
can see how many advertisers are showing for a particular query and average CPCs:
2.	 Search your competitors' URL to see if they are advertising through AdWords and 
learn more about their budgets, clicks per day, average ad position, and average 
cost-per-click (CPC). You'll also learn how many ad copies and keywords a domain is 
coming up for, which can help you better understand how comprehensive a particular 
domain's PPC program is.
3.	 Note budget trends over time, which can help you determine seasonality or changes 
in a particular business's strategy and marketing budget. You'll also be able to see 
some of the top keywords and ads for a domain, as well as related PPC competitors 
who are using overlapping keywords on AdWords:

How it works...
Third-party keyword spy tools analyze a domain's behavior over time on various search 
engines, including what keywords and ads websites are appearing on. Spend data is 
estimated based on assumptions that take into account ad position and how often ads  
are appearing for the various keywords. Data may not be available for all countries.
There's more...
It's important to note that PPC keyword spy tools do not actually have access to other 
advertisers' accounts, and as such they are not 100 percent accurate. You can use them as 
a starting point in understanding your competition, but ultimately you should do your own 
keyword testing to determine what works best with your goals and budgets.

Analyzing budgets and bids to determine 
market saturation
Understanding how competitive the online search ads' market for your industry is, will help you 
determine your own marketing budgets and how much you may want to bid on your keywords.
Getting ready
Decide which tool you would like to use. You can start with one of the free basic PPC keyword 
spy tools, such as KeywordSpy (www.keywordspy.com), for basic budget and average  
CPC look-ups.
How to do it...
1.	 Enter a domain URL into keywordspy.com to get daily AdWords spend and average 
CPC estimates for a particular business.
2.	 Repeat this search for multiple businesses of various sizes to better understand the 
different spend ranges.
3.	 You can also use a tool like keywordspy.com to figure out average CPCs for 
keywords of interest and how many advertisers are showing ads on a particular 
keyword. Generally, the higher the average CPCs, the more competitive the industry. 
The more advertisers that show up in the auction, the more saturated the search 
ads' market is for a particular term. In some industries, advertisers are also more 
willing to pay for each click, driving up average CPCs, since a single lead can be very 
valuable. For example, in the legal industry, one ad click can result in a multi-million 
dollar settlement, making many legal terms competitive and expensive.

4.	 Another tool you can use to figure out how high the CPCs are for your keywords 
is the free AdWords keyword tool. Go to https://adwords.google.com/o/
KeywordTool and enter a keyword of interest to see search volumes and 
competition denoted from low to high for keywords related to your search:

Check out the most expensive AdWords keywords in the 
following article:

most-expensive-google-adwords-keywords
How it works...
The Google AdWords keyword tool uses historic data and provides estimates only, not 
exact numbers. Once you have an AdWords account and are logged in, you'll see additional 
information in the Google AdWords keyword tool, including average CPCs and local search 
trends, which provide a sense of seasonality and traffic volumes throughout the year. While 
logged into your AdWords account, you can import the keywords you are researching in the 
keyword tool directly into your campaigns.
There's more...
Keep in mind that results will vary for different websites and that budgets should 
be consistent with your marketing goals. High spend advertisers typically have more 
comprehensive ad campaigns and are likely seeing a positive return on investment (ROI) 
from AdWords. However, low spend does not necessarily mean that AdWords is not profitable. 
A business could simply have budget constraints unrelated to AdWords' performance. Also, 
just because a competitor is investing a lot into AdWords does not mean that you will not be 
able to compete without a large budget. I recommend starting with conservative spend as you 
figure out what works for you and test the various options that AdWords has to offer.

Setting advertising goals
For companies that are interested in branding, clicks and engaged visitors are sufficient. 
However, for most businesses, the ultimate goal is not simply a click, or a website visit, but 
a sale or a lead. This type of action that we want website visitors to ultimately take on our 
website is also known as a conversion.
Getting ready
Before you start spending money on AdWords, you will want to determine what you'd like your 
visitors to do once they come to your website. It's important to understand your end goal so 
you can properly track and measure results of your ad campaigns.

How to do it...
Think about what you would like your visitors to do once they come to your website. The 
following are some common conversion goals advertisers have:
f

Sales
f
f
Registrations
f
f
Leads
f
f
Downloads (whitepapers and apps)
f
f
Sign-ups
f
f
Visits to a particular page, such as the contact page
The goal of online ads is to get as many visitors as possible to take the actions you previously 
identified. In essence, you'll try to maximize clicks that result in conversions and optimize the 
ad to increase your conversion rate.
There's more...
Conversion rate is the number of conversions (sales, leads, and so on) divided by the number 
of clicks received during a set time period. For example, if you received 5 online leads 
(conversions) out of 100 clicks from AdWords, your conversion rate would be 5 percent.
Conversion rate = Conversions / Clicks x 100
Conversion rates vary based on a variety of factors, including a website's look and feel and 
how easy or difficult it is for visitors to get through the conversion process. You can get an idea 
of how your website converts and how many visitors are completing your desired actions in 
your Google Analytics account, or through other web analytics programs you may be using.
Simplicity is key, and you should aim to minimize distractions and website features that would 
complicate or hinder the conversion process. For example, "Buy Now" buttons should be 
prominent and easy to spot, contact options displayed prominently on the website, and lead 
and registration forms as simple as possible.
I have heard industry experts throw around 2 percent as an AdWords average conversion  
rate across different industries. Typically, websites with a higher level of commitment required 
on a user's part (such as e-commerce) will have lower conversion rates than websites with 
lower levels of commitment required (such as lead generation). The Fireclick Index,  
http://index.fireclick.com/, can help provide some additional guidance on online 
conversion rates by industry.
The simpler conversion goals such as lead generation or e-mail collection will usually convert 
closer to 3 percent but can go as high as 5 to 15 percent. For lead generation, conversion 
rates can be all over the place since the marketing offers, the value of the product, and costs 
vary so widely.

The Predicting if AdWords will be profitable and calculating potential returns recipe
Predicting if AdWords will be profitable and 
calculating potential returns
Use simple math to figure out how many clicks you can get with your target AdWords budget 
by reviewing average CPCs for your industry. You can take this information a step further by 
taking into consideration your current conversion rates to figure out what types of returns you 
can expect from AdWords.
Getting ready
First, understand average CPCs for your target keywords by following the steps outlined in the 
Analyzing budgets and bids to determine market saturation recipe.
How to do it...
1.	 Once you know the average CPCs for your keywords, pick a budget that you're 
considering testing AdWords with. Next, you can calculate potential returns using 
some assumptions about conversion rates across different industries, or even better, 
using conversion rates from other online marketing efforts you may have tried.
2.	 If you've done some advertising online and have an idea of how your website 
converts, you can use that number to make some initial assumptions about potential 
AdWords returns. However, keep in mind that different sources of traffic do tend to 
convert differently as well. For example, you'll likely see higher conversion rates from 
repeat visitors who are returning to your website after bookmarking it than you would 
from first-time visitors who are researching a product.
3.	 If you are not sure how many of your visitors tend to convert, you can use more 
general and conservative assumptions. Start with 2 percent until you gather some 
data specific to your industry or specific to your website.
4.	 Let's now try to calculate potential return from AdWords. Let's say our average CPC is 
$1 and we have a budget of $100 with which we'll get 100 clicks. With an assumed 
conversion rate of 2 percent, we'll get 2 conversions for each $100 spent on AdWords 
with each conversion costing us $50.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 1
17
5.	 Even if we are not sure what your conversion rates will be like, you can use average 
CPCs to figure out if AdWords is a viable way to advertise online. If average CPCs 
for your industry are high, say $10, and you are only willing to pay $20 for each 
conversion, then AdWords is most likely not going to bring the returns you expect, 
since you would need a 50 percent conversion rate for the math to work in your favor, 
and such conversion rates are very unlikely.
6.	 The next important question is how much each conversion is worth to you. If you 
are paying $50 for each conversion, but make $1,000 from each conversion, then 
AdWords is obviously profitable. However, if it costs you $50 to convert a visitor but 
that visitors buys a $10 product and tends to never to come back to your site again, 
you are likely losing money with a 2 percent conversion rate on AdWords.
One of the most important metrics you'll want to set for yourself is how much you are willing to 
pay for each conversion and then optimize AdWords campaigns with that goal in mind.
How it works...
The cost-per-conversion is often referred to in the PPC world as your CPA.
Cost-per-action (CPA) = Total Cost / Conversions
CPA as cost-per-action usually corresponds to pay-per-lead, 
while CPA as cost-per-acquisition usually corresponds to 
pay-per-sale.
There is no such thing as high or low CPA that we can generalize across all advertisers. CPA 
is relative and different business models will have different CPA thresholds. For example, a 
lawyer could pay $400 for an AdWords lead but that lead could result in a case that brings  
the firm millions of dollars, in which scenario a CPA of $400 would be a bargain.
Your returns will vary based on a variety of factors, including your website, how compelling 
your products and services are, pricing, and special offers to name just a few. Your conversion 
rates will also vary based on how you stack up in all of these considerations against similar 
businesses online.

There's more...
I've had clients who said that one of their conversions could pay for a month of their 
advertising costs due to the nature of their business, and I've had clients who were only willing 
to pay a few dollars for each conversion, as the average value of each converted user was 
much lower. How much you should pay for each conversion will be unique to your business 
model, goals, and objectives.

AdWords is managed through an online interface, and to sign up and manage it you'll need 
an Internet connection. You also need an e-mail address, which will be associated with your 
account. If you do not have a Google account already, you'll need to sign up for one first.
How to do it...

signup prompt. 
2.	 On the next screen, you will have the option to either use a Google account you 
already have or to set up a new one. You can only use one e-mail address per 
AdWords account, so if your e-mail address is already related to an AdWords  
account you will need to use a different e-mail ID.

The Determining the right billing option for your needs recipe
Determining the right billing option for your 
needs
AdWords offers three main options to pay for ads. Advertisers can choose to pay before  
ads run (manual payments) or after clicks are accrued (automatic payments). Advertisers  
can also apply for invoicing to get a line of credit from Google—an option typically used by 
large advertisers.

Setting up Your Account
22
Getting ready
The following table explains the three payment options in more detail and for whom each 
option is most appropriate:
How you pay
Billing option
How it works
Manual payments
Advertisers prepay and add funds manually to AdWords 
before ads run.
Automatic payments
AdWords charges you after ads run. You are billed either 
30 days after your last payment or when you reach your 
next billing threshold.
Monthly invoicing
Google provides a line of credit and advertisers pay 
via check or wire transfer after ads run. To be eligible, 
businesses have to be registered for a minimum of one 
year, and meet country-specific spending requirements. 
AdWords will review your credit history and will send you 
an e-mail with their payment terms and credit line offer.
What you pay with
Once you decide which payment setting is most appropriate for your needs, you'll be able  
to pick from various methods of payment, including direct debit, credit card, and money 
transfer. Payment methods vary by country and you'll need to check what options you'll have 
by going to the billing page in your AdWords account or reviewing country-specific options at 
http://support.google.com/adwords/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=2375433&
topic=1714069&ctx=topic#US.
How to do it...
Once you have created your AdWords account, you will need to go through the billing 
preferences pages to complete the account setup.
1.	 On your billing page, choose your country, or where your billing address is located:

AdWords distributes coupons to new advertisers that you can use 
towards free advertising. You may get a promotional credit in the 
e-mail, through your hosting provider, such as GoDaddy, or you can 
search on Google.com for AdWords coupons. Make sure to apply 
the coupon code to your billing page and enjoy the free clicks.
There's more...
It is recommended to choose automatic payments rather than manual, since with manual 
payments you'll need to remember to add funds to your account each time you run out.  
Most advertisers will forget to add manual funds occasionally, resulting in your ads being 
down and a loss of traffic. You can always switch from one payment setting to another (from 
manual to automatic, for example), but you cannot change the account currency you select.

Inviting other users to access your account
As you continue to manage AdWords, you may need to invite other users, such as your 
associates or employees, to access your account. Depending on the level of access you grant 
other users, they may be able to review reports or help you make changes to campaigns.
Getting ready
Decide who you'd like to invite and what level of access they should have. For example,  
should this person be able to make changes to your campaigns or just receive reports?
How to do it...

You will need to review and confirm the request under your Account Access  
section in AdWords. You'll see Pending invitations on your account access

How it works...
There are four different levels of access you'll need to choose from:
f
f
E-mail only: Users can receive e-mail notifications and reports, but will not be able  
to sign in to AdWords, or make any changes to the account or campaigns.
f
f
Read only: Users can log in to the account, view and run reports, and review the 
campaigns, but are not able to make any changes to the account or campaigns.
f
f
Standard access: Users can make changes to the account and have most of the 
privileges of account admins. However, standard access users cannot invite,  
change, or disable access levels. An exception here is that standard users can  
add e-mail only users.
f
f
Administrative access: Users can make changes to the account and campaigns, 
add, and remove users or change user access levels.
There's more...
Note that account access invitations do expire, and you will need to resend them if they 
have not been accepted in time. You can revoke a previously sent invite or re-send expired 
invitations, which will be listed under your Pending invitations.
If you'd like to invite an AdWords agency to connect to your account, you will likely need 
to follow different steps since agencies typically manage AdWords through a single login 
AdWords interface called My Client Center (MCC). If your agency uses an MCC, you will  
need to provide them with your 10-digit AdWords customer ID, which you can find at the  
top-right corner of your AdWords screen.

Next, the agency will request access to your account via your customer ID. You'll still need  
to follow the same steps to accept a client manager request under your account access  
page. You'll see a client manager access request right below the standard Users with account 
access section.

Enabling auto tagging at the account level
You are likely already using or planning to use a web analytics program to analyze your

you should make sure to enable Auto-tagging in AdWords.
How to do it..
To enable Auto-tagging, follow these steps:
1.	 Navigate to the My account tab.
2.	 Choose the Preferences sub tab.
3.	 Make sure that the Auto-tagging checkbox is selected.

you'll be able to see in Google Analytics which campaigns, keywords, and ads led to visits,  
as well as the associated cost data.
There's more...
You can also choose to tag your keywords and ads manually by adding URL parameters  
that are compatible with your analytics tracking tool. You'll need to make sure to tag all  
of your ads and keywords in order to track properly. As this can be a time consuming  
process, auto-tagging is the preferred method.

Introduction
This chapter discusses how to set up your account to track past the click, in order to truly 
understand the returns you are getting from your advertising efforts. For most of you, simply 
bringing visitors to your website will not be the end goal. You'll likely want those visitors to 
purchase a product, fill out your lead form, sign up for a trial, or view a key page of your 
website. AdWords allows you to track these actions via AdWords' conversion tracking and 
Google Analytics. Setting up your account to incorporate the visitor behavior you care about 
will be the key to optimizing AdWords for the maximum performance.

Linking AdWords to Google Analytics
Linking AdWords and your Google Analytics accounts will help you better evaluate the results 
of your ad efforts and will arm you with the necessary information to maximize ROI. You'll be 
able to see how many pages are visited by the people who click on your AdWords ads, how 
long they stay on your website, how many leave immediately, what pages they browse, and a 
wealth of other useful information that will help you fine tune your ad campaigns.
After you link AdWords and Google Analytics, you will also be able to compare AdWords results 
to traffic from other sources. For example, you might want to compare how long visitors from 
AdWords and Bing Ads stay on your website.
Getting ready
In order to link your AdWords and Google Analytics accounts, you will need to be listed as an 
administrator on both accounts. You should also have the Google Analytics tracking code 
installed on your website. Make sure that the same e-mail address that you are using to log in 
to AdWords is also an administrator user in your Google Analytics.
Of course, you'll also need a Google Analytics account. If you do not have one already, you can 
create it at http://www.google.com/analytics/.
How to do it...
To link your AdWords account to Google Analytics, perform the following steps:
1.	 Sign in to your AdWords account. You will not be able to link AdWords and Google 
Analytics unless you sign in to AdWords first.
2.	 Go to the Tools and Analysis tab, and click on Google Analytics.
3.	 Click on the Admin link at the top-right corner of the screen:

to customize data views in AdWords to include Google Analytics metrics directly in your AdWords 
account, so there's less need for back-and-forth navigation. In order to see Google Analytics data 
in your AdWords reports, go to My Account and click on Linked accounts. Choose the View 
details option in your Google Analytics section and follow the prompts to add your property.
Make sure that you have enabled auto tagging in your AdWords 
account in order to see all of your AdWords data in your Google 
Analytics reports.

Creating a conversion goal in AdWords to 
track leads or sales
I recommend setting up conversion tracking before you run any AdWords campaigns so that 
you can properly measure them right from the start. Rather than optimizing for just clicks, you 
should optimize your campaigns for conversions or visitor actions that you care about, such as 
sales or leads.
Getting ready
First, decide what actions you'd like to track on your website. For many online businesses, sales 
is the end goal. However, you could track a variety of other behaviors that signify engagement, 
such as lead submissions, whitepaper downloads, sign ups, and views of key pages.
You can also track multiple conversions in AdWords by creating separate conversion actions in 
your account.

How to do it...
To create a conversion in AdWords and generate the code, perform the following steps:
1.	 Navigate to the Tools and Analysis tab and click on Conversions.
2.	 Click on New Conversion and name your conversion:
3.	 Choose from the following three conversion location options:


Webpage (most common)


Call on-site


App download
4.	 Click on Save and continue. In the next step you will be able to choose  
your settings.
5.	 Choose your Conversion category from one of the following:


Other


Purchase/sale


Signup


Lead


View of a key page
6.	 Choose your Markup Language. In most cases, you'll choose HTML.
7.	
Conversion value is optional. If a conversion is worth a certain amount to you, say 
$20, you can assign that value to the conversion.

8.	 You have the option to show or not to show Tracking indicator on your website. If 
you choose to show it, a Google site stats notification will appear when someone 
completes a conversion. You have the option to customize what this notification will 
look like on your website. If you omit the Google site stats notification, be very clear in 
you privacy policy that you track users' surfing behavior, especially in the EU because 
of the "cookie law".
9.	 Click on Save and continue.
If someone else will be placing the code on your website, you have the option to e-mail 
them the code through AdWords. Or, if you make changes to your website's code, click the 
appropriate button to get the code.

Copy and paste the code between the tags of the pages you will be tracking (between the 
body tags of the page). The tracking pixel needs to show on your conversion confirmation  
page when a user reaches that page, in order for conversions to be recorded.
How it works...
It can take up to 24 hours before conversions appear in your AdWords account, so do not 
worry if you do not see conversion data right away. Once you have enabled conversion tracking 
and have added the code to your website, AdWords will start to attribute conversions to 
individual campaigns, keywords, and ads.
If you make any changes to the conversion Settings page, make 
sure that you update the tracking code on your website as well. 
Otherwise, conversions might no longer be tracked properly.

Conversions (1-per-click) will count only one conversion per ad click. If more than one conversion 
occurs after a click, only the first one will be counted. Conversions (many-per-click) will count 
multiple conversions per click. View-through conversions are counted when someone views an 
ad and converts without clicking on that ad.

Importing goals from Google Analytics into 
AdWords
Goals in Google Analytics are similar to conversions in AdWords, in that they can help you 
track specific behaviors on your website, such as sign ups or sales. If you already have a 
goal (or multiple goals) created in your Google Analytics account, you can import them into 
AdWords as conversions. This will enable you to see how your ad efforts relate to specific 
goals you already decided to track via Google Analytics, without needing to set up AdWords' 
conversion tracking and add an additional pixel to your website.
Getting ready
In order to be able to import Analytics' goals into your AdWords account, your AdWords and 
Google Analytics accounts will need to be linked first. You will need to enable auto tagging 
in AdWords, and be opted into data sharing settings in your Google Analytics account under 
the Account settings page in your Admin section. Finally, your AdWords ads will need to have 
resulted in a goal completion.

How it works...
AdWords conversion tracking and Google Analytics are calculated differently, so do not be 
surprised if you see some discrepancies between AdWords conversion tracking data and 
goal completions in Google Analytics. The following are the three main reasons for the 
discrepancies you might notice:
f
f
Attribution: AdWords conversion tracking attributes the conversion to the last 
AdWords click, while Google Analytics will attribute the conversion to the source of the 
last visit. For example, if a visitor clicked on your AdWords ad, but did not convert, and 
instead converted after finding your website via Google organic search the next day, 
Analytics will attribute this conversion to organic. AdWords, on the other hand, would 
still attribute this conversion to the appropriate AdWords keyword and ad, if you have 
conversion tracking enabled.
f
f
Cookie length: AdWords cookies expire after 30 days while Google Analytics  
cookies last 6 months. This means that if a visitor converted 30 days after clicking 
on your AdWords ad, AdWords conversion tracking would not count it but Google 
Analytics would.
f
f
Date of conversion: AdWords reports the conversion for the day the click that led to 
the conversion happened, rather than when the conversion occurred. Analytics, on 
the other hand, reports the conversion the day it actually occurred. For example, if 
a visitor clicked on your ad on October 15th but did not convert until October 17th, 
AdWords would report this conversion under October 15th and Google Analytics 
under October 17th.
There's more...
You can set up both AdWords conversion tracking and import goals from Google Analytics. 
If you choose to do that, your Conv. (1-per-click) column in the reporting dashboard will de-
duplicate any of the same conversions and only count one conversion. However, your Conv. 
(many-per-click) column will report both AdWords conversions and imported Google Analytics 
goals. To see individual conversion metrics broken out further, go to Segment and choose 
conversion action name from the Conversions segment.

Verifying that conversion tracking is working
After setting up AdWords conversion tracking, I recommend making sure that it's working 
properly so you can start acting on your data as soon as possible.
Getting ready
You will need access to your AdWords account, your conversion actions in AdWords, as well as 
the URL for your confirmation page. 
How to do it...
There are a few steps you can take to verify conversions are being tracked.
Check the source code
First, I recommend checking that the code is indeed on the appropriate page and that the 
code matches the tracking code in your AdWords account:
1.	 In your browser, go to your confirmation page URL, such as yourwebsite.com/
thank_you.
2.	 Click to view the source code. The following table entails the view page source 
shortcuts for the Chrome and Firefox:
Command
Windows
Mac
Chrome
Ctrl + U
Command + Option + U
Firefox
Ctrl + U
Command + U
3.	 In your AdWords account, go to Tools and Analysis and select Conversions.
4.	 Click on the conversion action you created and go to the Code tab. Choose the  
I make changes to the code option to view the code you created.
5.	 Look for var google_conversion_id in your code and search for the value you 
see in your account on your confirmation page's source code.
6.	 If you do not see it, the code was not added to the right page and will need to  
be installed.
Wait for conversions to occur
Once you are confident that the conversion tracking code is on the proper pages, you can 
simply wait for conversions to occur. I recommend checking back 24 hours after implementing 
conversion tracking to see if any conversions have been attributed to your campaigns.

Tracking beyond the Click

You should see them in your Campaign Management tab next to other performance data. If 
you do not see any conversion columns in your AdWords Campaign Management page, you 
may need to customize your views and columns to show conversion data.
Another place where you should see conversions in AdWords is under Conversions in Tools 
and Analysis:
Complete a test conversion
If you prefer testing conversion tracking on your end, you can do so by clicking on your own ad 
and completing a fake conversion, as follows:
1.	 Do a Google search for one of your keywords.
2.	 Click on your ad. You will need to click on your AdWords own ad to do this.
3.	 Complete a test conversion.
4.	 Check your AdWords account to see if it's reporting conversions. Allow up to 24 hours 
for a conversion to appear in your AdWords account.
How it works...
Please note that AdWords reporting is not real time and is delayed by at least a few hours. It 
can take up to 24 hours for AdWords to reflect a conversion in your account, so make sure to 
allow for some time for reporting to sync.
If you are importing your goals from Google Analytics into AdWords, it can take up to 48 
hours to see the conversion data in the AdWords interface. However, you can still see Google 
Analytics goals in the Analytics interface, even though they may take longer to sync to AdWords.

There's more...
One common mistake when it comes to conversion tracking includes the code being pasted on 
the wrong pages, such as on the landing page instead of on the confirmation page. A good hint 
that you may have made this mistake is if you see an over-inflated number of conversions in 
your AdWords account. In such an instance, you would be counting each visit as a conversion 
and you would need to move the code from your landing page to your confirmation page.
Conversions are also not tracked properly if the tracking code is modified in any way, such 
as with an extra space. To confirm that the code has been pasted exactly as it appears in 
your AdWords account, copy the entire block of code in AdWords and search for it on your 
confirmation page.

Analyzing how long it takes to convert 
customers
Have you ever wondered how long it takes for your typical customer to convert after clicking on 
your ad and browsing through your website? You likely have assumptions about this process, 
but luckily AdWords has hard data that can help you better understand the time lag between a 
click and a conversion.
Getting ready
You will need to have AdWords conversions enabled and tracking in your account. If you do, 
AdWords automatically tracks the time lag for you, and you just need to dig up the data.

AdWords analyzes impressions, clicks, and conversions your ads accrue over time and 
aggregates this data for a snapshot of a search path. In addition to finding out how many days 
your customers take to convert, you can also analyze average impressions and clicks before a 
conversion. In other words, you'll learn how many times users will see your ads and how many 
times they will click on it before finally taking the desired action.
There's more...
The default history window in Search Funnels is 30 days. You have the option to change this 
to 60 or 90 days at the top-right corner of the Search Funnels screen.

Analyzing assist clicks and impressions
Most of your customers will do a bit of research online before they finally settle on a product 
they'd like to purchase or choose a service to commit to. In fact, many of your visitors will likely 
see your ad multiple times and may even click on it more than once before finally converting, 
and they'll probably use slightly different keywords to research during this process. Search 
Funnels in AdWords, including assist click and impression reports help you analyze this 
search path that leads up to a conversion.
Getting ready
You will need to have conversion tracking enabled in your account, and your campaigns will 
need to have generated some conversions.
How to do it...
To analyze which keywords help guide your customers toward a conversion, perform the 
following steps:
1.	 Log in to your AdWords account. If you prefer the Google Analytics interface, Multi 
Channel Funnels in your Google Analytics account will provide similar data.
2.	 In AdWords, select Conversions from the Tools and Analysis tab.
3.	 Click on Search Funnels.

SEARCH FUNNELS | First Click Analysis

5.	 Sort by Assist Clicks and Impressions or Last Click Analysis. The larger the number, 
the more often this campaign, ad group, or keyword contributes as an assist. If the 
number is less than 1, then it's mostly a last click contributor.
How it works...
AdWords relies on last click data to attribute conversions. This means that when someone 
converts via AdWords, the conversion will be attributed to the keyword, which generated the 
last click, even though that person may have originally clicked on your ad via a completely 
different keyword. Here is an example:
Mary searches Google for contact lenses on Tuesday and clicks on your ad. She does  
not convert.
Mary searches Google again on Wednesday, but this time types in buy contacts online 
and converts via your ad.

Keyword buy contacts online is attributed a conversion in AdWords. You might conclude 
that keyword contact lenses is too costly and does not convert, but you are not taking into 
consideration that keyword contact lenses is in fact a team player keyword, which helps 
generate sales through assist impressions and clicks.
This information can help you understand which keywords are good team players, and while 
they may not show conversions, are worth advertising on.

Analyzing AdWords data in Google Analytics
Once you link your AdWords and Google Analytics accounts, you'll be able to easily analyze 
AdWords data in your Analytics reports. For example, you'll be able to compare bounce rates 
(percentage of visitors who view only a single page) or time spent on site by campaign. This 
will help you better optimize your ad efforts based on user engagement.

Bounce Rate: The percentage of visitors who view only a single page. For example, a 
visitor who clicks on your ad and leaves after a few seconds without viewing any other 
page but the landing page.
Please note that a visit is not the same as a click in AdWords 
and you will likely see some discrepancies between the two 
metrics. Clicks in AdWords are counted when a user clicks 
on your ad, even if that person doesn't reach your site, such 
as if they bounce and change their mind or if your site is 
temporarily down. Visits in Analytics indicates the number of 
unique sessions initiated by your visitors. For example, if a 
user clicks on your ad twice, Google Analytics will count that 
as one visit. For a detailed breakdown of the key differences 
between clicks and visits, refer to the following article:

Analyzing time on site data and bounce rates
Understanding how visitors who have clicked on your ads interact with your products and 
services is vital to optimizing to your marketing campaigns. Some of your campaigns might 
generate low quality visits and bring users that immediately leave your site. You have an 
opportunity to analyze this behavior and optimize to ensure that you are focusing your spend 
on visitors that are interested in your website.
Getting ready
You can analyze AdWords visitor engagement either in Google Analytics directly, or by 
customizing your column views in AdWords to include Google Analytics data. In order to  
see AdWords data in Google Analytics, you will need to have first linked your accounts.
How to do it...
To analyze time on site data and bounce rates:
1.	 Log in to your Google Analytics account.
2.	 Navigate to the Advertising section.
3.	 Click on AdWords.
Start by reviewing campaign-level data first. I recommend initially analyzing the following 
pieces of information:
f
f
Bounce Rates
f
f
Avg. Visit Duration
f
f
Pages / Visit
f
f
Goal Completions (if you set up goals)
Are you seeing differences in user engagement by campaign? If some of your campaigns are 
bringing visitors who spend a lot less time on your website and are more likely to bounce, you 
might want to revisit and optimize these campaigns. Similarly, if some of your campaigns are 
showing really low bounce rates and engaged visitors, you might want to focus more of your 
budget there.
Keep in mind that high bounce rates are not necessarily always a negative. Perhaps a visitor 
is comparing shopping options and will return to your website after exploring other options. 
Before turning off high bounce rate keywords or lowering your budgets and bids, review the 
conversion data to ensure you are not de-prioritizing high bounce rate campaigns that are 
actually converting.

In the following example, Campaign Example 6 is showing higher bounce rates and less time

Clicking on any of your campaigns will take you to the ad group level view, so you can pin-point 
any particular problem ad groups.

Introduction
Account structure is the fundamental basis of being able to write relevant ads, track and 
optimize your campaigns, and keep your budget manageable. Poor account structure is one of 
the most common reasons why advertisers fail, and it can make or break the success of your 
account. Taking some time to properly plan out your campaigns can save you time and money 
down the road.

Structuring Your Account

Planning account structure
Proper account structure will help you lay a solid foundation for your ad campaigns and will 
simplify account management and reporting. Although there are many different ways to 
structure an account, there are some best practices that have proven to work. Your account 
structure will depend on your unique business and your goals, and it will likely change over 
time as you optimize.
Getting ready
Before you start adding in keywords and ads you'd like to advertise on, think about the following:
f
f
What products or services would you like to advertise?
f
f
Are some of your product lines or services of greater priority?
f
f
Where are your potential customers? What locations and regions would you like  
to target?
f
f
Do you have different budgets for your various products and services?
How to do it...
Before you start creating a campaign, consider the AdWords account hierarchy and how you 
can best organize your offerings within that structure. An AdWords account has the following 
major components:
Campaign
10,000 per account
Ad Group
20,000 per Ad Group
Ads
4 million per account
Keywords, Placements,
Audiences, Product
Targets
20,000 per ad group
Campaign
10,000 per account
Ad Group
20,000 per Ad Group
Account
1 per advertiser

Chapter 4
59
An advertiser typically has one AdWords account with multiple campaigns. Each campaign 
should have themed ad groups to further group keywords, placements, and other targets. In 
addition to keywords and other targets, an ad group also contains ads that should reflect each 
ad group's theme.
As you plan your structure, keep in mind the following best practices:
1.	 Organize your campaigns by themes. Create separate campaigns for different 
products or services to take advantage of settings that you choose at the campaign 
level. For example, as a retailer, you might want to create separate campaigns for the 
different types of products you sell.
2.	 Split up your campaigns by Search and Display. Create separate campaigns for the 
different networks, as they require different strategies.
3.	 Organize by spend. Create unique campaigns for sets of products that have separate 
budgets. This will allow you to allocate and control ad spend for each category.
4.	 An AdWords account has a limit of 5 million targeting items per account, which could 
include targets such as keywords or placements.
The following are some example campaigns a website that sells furniture might want to  
start with:
Campaign:
Patio Furniture
Bedroom Furniture
Campaign:

How it works...
You are not forever locked into the account structure that you choose when you first set up 
your account. You can continue to restructure and refine your campaigns as you go and test. 
The campaigns you'll develop over time will likely be structured differently than what you start 
out with.

There's more...
I recommend most advertisers start their initial campaigns by advertising on search only, 
and to avoid display at first, while you learn more about AdWords and what will work for your 
business. Once you have a solid understanding of the interface and the various options, I 
recommend testing display with a smaller budget via a campaign separate from your search 
campaigns. This way display ads do not dominate your overall spend.

Common ways to structure campaigns
There is no one right or wrong way to structure an account. Each business is unique with 
different advertising goals, budgets, and priorities. An account structure that works for one 
advertiser may not work for another. Ultimately, proper account structure with intuitively 
labeled campaigns will simplify account management and analysis, and will help you to 
properly test and optimize.
Getting ready
Review your website's sitemap to determine if you can re-use it for AdWords. Many advertisers 
choose to structure their campaigns according to their website's layout. You have probably 
structured your website carefully by topics or product, and you'll have landing pages to reflect 
these categories that you can use for your campaigns and ad groups.
Decide if you'd like to advertise on search, display, or on both networks.
How to do it…
The following are some common ways and best practices to structure your campaigns:
f
f
By network: Always keep search and display networks separate. Create different 
campaigns for search and display strategies so you can customize settings and use 
different budgets.

f
f
By location: If your business operates in different locations, you might want to 
consider creating different campaigns targeting these locations so you can better 
customize keywords and ads for each region. For example, if you sell Halloween 
costumes in the United States and the United Kingdom, you could create separate 
campaigns for each country, customizing ads within each campaign with country 
specific offers, such as shipping.


Halloween costumes - US


Halloween costumes - UK
f
f
By types of products or services: You can create separate campaigns for sets 
of products or similar services. For example, if you sell shoes, you can create the 
following campaigns:


Women's shoes


Kid's shoes


Men's shoes
f
f
By brand: Many businesses, especially retailers and e-commerce websites, sell a 
variety of brands that can each have their own campaigns.


Samsung


Apple


Nokia
f
f
By priority or ROI: If some of your products or services are higher priority than others 
you may wish to keep them in their own campaigns. This will allow you to use a higher 
budget for that strategic set of keywords. For example, you can have two campaigns:


High priority keywords with a bigger chunk of your budget


Low priority keywords with a smaller budget
f
f
By language: If your target audience speaks multiple languages, you can choose to 
segment campaigns by language. For example:


Kid's shoes - English


Kid's shoes - Spanish
Name your campaigns to reflect the keywords and 
settings you are choosing, so you can easily analyze the 
data. You can rename your campaigns and ad groups 
at any time. However, if you rename a campaign in 
AdWords, it will be tracked as a brand new campaign in 
your Google Analytics reports.

Structuring Your Account
62
How it works…
Keeping campaigns separate is important because you can allocate different budgets  
for each campaign. It also helps you better analyze returns, prioritize ad budgets and 
spending on what's working, and act based on changes to business inventory, priorities,  
or customer demand.
For example, if you had separate campaigns for two different brands of shoes, you could turn 
off the brand that is currently out of stock and increase the budget on a brand that came out 
with a popular new model.
If you simply lumped all of your keywords into one campaign, the highest search volume 
keywords which may not even be converting for you might end up dominating your spend  
and might prevent your important keywords from showing up.
There's more…
You will likely start with a more simple account structure that will develop and change as 
you learn what works for you. You can always move keywords and ads from one campaign to 
another and split up one campaign into multiple campaigns to a more precise target. If you 
choose to re-organize your campaigns, your new campaigns will start out with fresh statistics, 
but you will be able to access past reports and data at any time.

Deciding where to show your ads
As you are setting up your AdWords campaigns, you have the option to choose your targeting 
preferences more broadly to maximize your ad reach, or to restrict targeting to ensure ads are 
only showing to your very specific audience. Who will end up seeing your ads will depend on 
the campaign settings you choose as you create your campaigns.
Getting ready
The first setting you'll need to consider when creating your campaigns will be which networks 
you'd like to show ads on. Google has two main networks through which ads are served:
f
f
Search network


Includes Google.com, Google properties such as Google Maps, and search 
partners, such as AOL.com.


Ads are text based.
f
f
Display network


Includes Gmail, YouTube, and millions of partner websites, such as 
nytimes.com, where your potential customers could be reading the news 
or articles related to your products.


Ad formats include: text, image, video, and rich media.
How to do it...
If you are new to AdWords, I recommend you start with a search only campaign while you learn 
the platform. If you'd still like to test display from the start, I recommend keeping it separate 
from your search campaign:
1.	 Click on the Campaigns tab and click on the prompt to create a new campaign.
2.	 Choose either Search Network only or Display Network only. I do not recommend 
choosing Search & Display Networks from within one campaign.
3.	 If you'd like to target both search and display, create two separate campaigns, 
choosing one network within each campaign.
www.it-ebooks.info

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Structuring Your Account
64
4.	 If you already have an AdWords campaign running, you can check which networks you 
have opted to show on in your campaign Settings page under the Networks section:
How it works...
On the Search Network only option, AdWords ads are served based on a user's search query. 
Users search for specific information and do so via keywords they type in to a search box. The 
ads that are shown are driven by search queries, hence Search Network only.
On the Display Network only option, AdWords ads can be served based on the websites' 
content or user interests. Users browse online information, such as news articles, and 
AdWords ads appear alongside this content, which the AdWords system deems relevant based 
on the keywords and themes you have chosen for your campaign. Advertiser can also choose 
to target specific websites that they know are browsed by their target audience.
There's more...
Users who are seeing your ads via the Google Search network or through the Display network 
will tend to be in very different phases of the buying or decision cycle, and you should 
consider this as you plan out your advertising strategies.
The Google Search network will generally bring you visitors who are more ready to purchase, 
and they are searching for specific products and services.

Chapter 4
65
On the Google Display network, users are browsing online for content and may not be looking 
for your product or service at that moment. They are often not as likely to convert as visitors 
who find you via search ads.
However, through Display, you can show your ads to users who are browsing websites that 
are highly targeted to what you are offering or websites that are specific to your target 
demographic. The Display network is a great way to boost traffic and reach those who may  
not be even aware that they need your products.
For example, a country club in California looking to sell golf club memberships can show  
an image ad with a beautiful golf course to a user who is reading an article about the latest 
golf clubs.
For most businesses, the Search network will convert a bit better than the Display network. 
However, this is not the case for all advertisers. In fact, for some, Display outperforms 
Search, especially because the former has become quite saturated and competitive for many 
industries. I recommend you test both networks to find how your audience responds.

Device targeting options
Your customers are increasingly searching for you not just from their computers, but from  
high-end mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets. This rapid growth of mobile 
necessitates custom strategies for the different ways users behave, depending on what device 
they use. For example, people searching from their computer desks tend to use longer search 
phrases than those searching on their smartphones. While you cannot opt out of tablet devices, 
you can adjust mobile bids through each campaign and ad group. Savvy marketers track ROI 
from each device and create tailored strategies to maximize the potential of each user base.
Getting ready
By default, each campaign is designed to be displayed on all devices. However, before you 
spend money advertising on mobile phones, make sure that your website is mobile friendly. 
Many advertisers invest in creating a mobile friendly version of their website, optimized for the 
mobile browsing experience. Many visitors will not be willing to fill out a long contact form or 
complete a transaction on their smartphones, so make sure you take that into consideration.
To check out what your website looks like on a mobile device and to 
make it more mobile friendly, go to http://www.howtogomo.com.

How to do it...
To choose and modify mobile device targeting, perform the following steps:
1.	 If your website loads properly on smartphones, target all devices to start with and 
then adjust mobile bids based on performance.
2.	 Your default device targeting is preset so ads are shown on all devices as you create 
your campaign:
3.	 After you create your campaign, you can adjust mobile bids in your campaign's 
Settings page. To opt out of mobile completely, use a -100% bid adjustment:
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 4
67
4.	 Mobile bids are adjusted at the campaign or at the ad group level, and you'll need to 
repeat this process for each of your campaigns.
5.	 Your device settings page does not provide the option to opt out of computers or 
tablets. However, you can set very low default ad group bids (for example, $0.01) and 
use aggressive mobile bid adjustments (for example, increase by 500 percent) to 
virtually opt a campaign out of computers and tablets and run mostly on mobile. You 
may still get some traffic from computers and tablets, but with very low default bids, 
such clicks should be minimal.
How it works...
To help you better segment how your customers are finding you, AdWords offers the following 
device targeting options:
f
f
Desktop and laptop computers
f
f
Mobile devices with full browsers
f
f
Tablets with full browsers
Advertisers cannot opt campaigns out of computers or tablets, but you can adjust this by 
increasing or decreasing mobile bids.
You can see each campaign's traffic segmented by device in your AdWords Campaign 
Management page. Simply click on Segment and choose Device to see device-specific 
performance breakdowns by campaign:

Choosing which locations to target
Precise location targeting is one of the biggest selling points of AdWords, offering advertisers 
the flexibility to reach their customers wherever they might be and to customize messaging 
based on location. You can target as broadly as worldwide, or get as granular as targeting a 
specific city or a predefined radius.
Your ads will appear to people you are targeting, avoiding irrelevant clicks and helping you to 
zero in on the most targeted audience, but please note that location targeting may not always 
be 100 percent accurate.
Getting ready
Think about where your target customers are located and who you'd like to see your ads. Ask 
yourself the following questions:
f
f
Do you ship products internationally or work with customers outside of your country?
f
f
If you are a local business, how far of a radius are your customers willing to travel 
from, or how far are you willing to travel to reach your customers?
f
f
Are there specific metro areas or cities that you would like to focus on?
f
f
Do you have multiple business locations that will require customized messaging?
How to do it...
You will choose your location targeting preferences as you set up each campaign. You can also 
edit any location preferences you may have set up already:
1.	 Navigate from the campaign setting page to the Locations section.

71
How it works...
AdWords figures out a user's location and serves ads based on one of following factors:
f
f
Physical location (IP address): AdWords determines someone's physical location 
based on their computer location, which is determined via an Internet protocol (IP) 
address. An IP address is a unique number assigned by Internet service providers 
(ISP) to each computer. Please note that some ISPs mask their users' IP addresses, 
so IP address targeting is not 100 percent accurate.
f
f
Search intent: AdWords serves ads based on interest in geographic areas indicated 
through searches. A user may indicate interest in a specific location via a search 
query, even though that user could be located outside the target location. For 
example, Mary from San Francisco is looking for a spa in New York. Even though Mary 
is physically located in San Francisco, AdWords recognizes that she is interested in 
a spa outside of her current physical location, because of her spa in new york 
search query, and an AdWords ad targeting the New York area pops up.
f
f
Google domain: Each country has a unique URL that helps Google determine where 
a user is located. For example, someone searching Google from France might be on 
google.fr.
f
f
Mobile device location: If a user is searching from a high-end mobile device, 
AdWords may be able to detect device location and serve relevant ads.

Excluding locations from seeing your ads
AdWords offers the ability to restrict whom your ads are shown to and exclude locations you 
do not do business with, or cities and zip codes that are not profitable for you. By showing ads 
only to locations you are interested in working with, you can improve your results and ROI.
Getting ready
The following is a list of who will benefit from excluding locations:

f
Business that do not ship to certain states or regions
f

How to do it...
To exclude locations within individual campaigns, perform the following steps:

choose Settings.
2.	 Choose the Locations sub-tab and click on Edit locations.
3.	 Type the location you'd like to exclude in the search box and click on Exclude:
4.	 Save your selection.
How it works...
Location exclusion ensures that your ads are not shown to people in cities or regions you 
select. You can exclude a specific zip code, city, metro area, state, or entire country. Once you 
add a location to exclude, AdWords will not serve your ads within that region.

Creating themed ad groups
An ad group should contain closely related keywords that all speak to a similar theme. Keeping 
all keywords within a single, tightly themed ad group will allow you to create more targeted ads 
that will generate a better response, bring more qualified visitors, and improve returns.
Getting ready
To help you get ready, following are some examples of ad groups that follow best practices as 
well as ad groups that do not.

Recommended ad group structure
The following three ad groups each have small, closely themed keyword lists, which will allow 
us to write specific ad text for each group of keywords:
Keywords:

Keywords:
Rug cleaning
Rug cleaning service
Rug cleaning services
Ad Group:

Ad Group:

Ad Group:

Poor ad group structure
If an ad group has several keywords, all with different themes, your ads are less likely to 
be effectively targeted. The following is an example of a poorly themed ad group with only 
keywords within that ad group loosely related:
Ad Group:
Cleaning Service
Keywords:
Sofa cleaning
Carpet cleaning service
Stains
Drapery cleaning
A good test to double check if your themes are tight enough 
is to ask yourself if each keyword within your ad group has 
been reflected in your ad text. Make sure you find a balance 
between relevant groupings and being too specific. Creating 
a separate ad group for each individual keyword is likely not 
the best use of your time!

Introduction
Keywords are the backbone of your account, setting the stage for those who see your ads, as 
well as those who do not. They're a powerful method to connect to potential customers at the 
moment they are searching for you. Advertisers choose their own keywords in AdWords, and 
this process of choosing relevant keywords is vital to marketing success.
Many advertisers think that adding as many keywords as possible will boost traffic and 
generate more sales. However, that's not necessarily the case for AdWords, where adding too 
many irrelevant keywords can actually hurt you in the long run.

Creating Relevant Keywords
82
Keep in mind that some keywords are more relevant to your website than others and also 
have different conversion potential. If you choose to run ads on irrelevant keywords you might 
end up spending money on clicks that are unlikely to convert.
What's more, adding keywords in AdWords that are too general and irrelevant to your  
website will likely lead to low Quality Scores and might hurt your chances of being profitable  
on even the more specific keywords. AdWords punishes advertisers who historically choose 
low quality keywords, in order to protect the user experience and ensure relevant ads are 
shown on Google.
I recommend starting with smaller, targeted keywords lists, and adding to them as you learn 
what works to build your Quality Scores.
Using keyword matching options effectively
Keyword matching options allow you to control who sees your ads by broadening or restricting 
what searches your ads appear in. They range from broad to specific. The broader match types 
are designed to generate more traffic and show your ads on related searches that you may not 
have thought to add to your campaigns. The more specific match types restrict the queries that 
your ads show on and typically bring fewer impressions, but potentially more targeted traffic.
How to do it…
To add keywords in different match types, perform the following steps:
1.	 Click on the Campaigns tab, go into a specific campaign and ad group where you 
wish to add keywords.
2.	 Navigate to the Keywords tab and click on + Add keywords.
3.	 Add keywords according to the parameters outlined in the following table. For 
example, if you wish to use exact match, add brackets around each keyword,  
such as [red roses].
4.	 Click on Save.
The following is an example of how to enter the example keyword red roses in each of the 
match types to your AdWords account:

variations AdWords finds 
relevant that you may 
not have added to your

Broad match 
modifier:
+red +roses
Ads will show on close 
variations but not

Broad match is showing 
your ads on irrelevant 
queries and you need 
to restrict traffic. Broad 
match modifier is a great 
in-between option when 
broad is too general but 
phrase too restrictive.
Phrase:
"red roses"
Word order is preserved 
and the phrase with 
its close variants will 
trigger your ads. Words 
used before and after 
the phrase you entered 
might be eligible for the

The exact keyword and its 
close variants will trigger 
your ads. Your ads will

The default match type in AdWords is broad, and broad is what most advertisers use throughout 
their accounts. However, you might find that you get better ROI from some of the more specific 
match types, such as phrase and exact. If you are using broader keyword match types, you can 
see what other queries your ads are appearing on by running a search terms report.

I recommend most advertisers start with mostly broad match 
combined with negative keywords. Over time, you can refine 
and optimize your campaigns based on results and search 
query reports.
There's more…
I recommend using your most important keywords, as well as your highest traffic generating 
keyword in various match types, so you can adjust bids based on performance. For example, you 
might find that your exact match version of a particular keyword converts at a more profitable 
CPA than broad match, and you can then increase the bid on that exact match keyword.
By default, AdWords will include plurals, misspellings, and other close variants of your phrase 
and exact match keywords. However, you have the option to opt out of this in your campaign 
Settings page, under Advanced settings for Keyword matching options. I do not recommend 
excluding close variants, since the additional traffic will be very close to the keywords you  
have chosen.

Finding relevant keywords
Choosing the right keywords to show your ads can make or break the success of your AdWords 
account. The keywords you select, if properly researched and are relevant to your website, 
can bring highly interested visitors to your website, or if too general, can cost you a lot without 
generating any sales.
Getting ready
Ask your customers what terms they use on Google.com to find you. Note down the 
top phrases that are used consistently and save them for future research and keyword 
development.
Also, brainstorm key terms, which you think describe your business. Do not worry at this step if 
they are too general or specific enough for AdWords. Simply note the general keyword ideas.
How to do it…
Once you have brainstormed a list of potential keywords, research and develop them further 
with Google's keyword tool. The tool is free and is available to all advertisers within their 
AdWords account.
If you do not yet have an AdWords account, you can access the keyword tool by visiting 
https://adwords.google.com/o/KeywordTool. To access the tool via your AdWords 
account, go to Tools and Analysis and choose the Keyword Tool option.
You can research keywords you brainstormed earlier via Google's Keyword Tool to find out 
potential traffic, costs, and the level of competition:
1.	 Type in the keyword you're considering using in your account in the Word or phrase 
box in the Keyword Tool window.
2.	 Choose your location under Advanced Options and Filters.
3.	 Select the Keyword ideas tab in Keyword Tool.
4.	 Click on Search to get data on your original search term and additional keyword 
ideas. The keyword tool will provide you with additional phrases related to your 
original search that can serve as ideas for new keywords to add to your campaigns.

5.	 If many of the related keywords suggested by the tool are not relevant to you, your 
original search query may be too general. Instead, use some of the other, more 
relevant suggestions from the keyword tool.
6.	 In the previous example, a family lawyer looking for new customers is considering 
running on keyword lawyer. When we review the related keyword ideas in the 
keyword tool, we can see them most of the related searches are not relevant to 
a family lawyer. So, the keyword lawyer is not the best choice for an attorney 
specializing in family matters.
7.	
Next, we can refine our search by entering a more specific query, such as family 
lawyer. The keyword tool provides additional suggestions, including keywords with 
location pre-qualifiers and other ways of saying family lawyer, such as divorce 
attorney. The list in the following screenshot is looking more relevant to a family 
attorney and has some specific keyword options we can work with.

Chapter 5

8.	 We can further pre-qualify our search by excluding terms from the keyword analysis. 
Enter any words not applicable to your business in the Exclude terms box to leave 
them out from the keyword ideas results.
9.	 Review the monthly search data and competition columns to get data on how 
many people are searching related terms, and whether the competition on your 
keywords will be Low, Medium, or High. If competition is high, there are a lot of other 
advertisers bidding on those keywords.
10.	 The Approximate CPC (Search) column will give you an idea of how much each 
keyword costs, or how much advertisers on average pay for each click. Keep in mind 
that these are rough estimates and actual CPCs will vary greatly.
11.	 Sort by Global Monthly Searches or Local Monthly Searches to review the highest 
traffic search terms first.

12.	Check the box next to the keywords you like to save them to My keyword ideas.
13.	Once you have a list of keywords in your saved keyword ideas, you can add them to 
your account directly, download them, view as text, or view in Traffic Estimator.
For those of you who are not sure where to start, the keyword tool will also provide keyword 
suggestions based on the content of your website. Here is how to use this feature:
1.	 Type in your website's URL in the Website box in Google' Keyword Tool.
2.	 Click on Search.

Not all keywords suggested by the system will necessarily be right for your business. You 
should still review them carefully and only add phrases that are relevant.
How it works…
In general, one-word keywords tend to be too general, as we can often not be sure what 
the users typing them in are actually searching for. For example, someone searching for 
accountant on Google.com could be an actual accountant who is looking for salary 
information or a new job. Or, it could also be a business that's looking for an accountant to hire.
The more general keywords will tend to have lower Quality Scores, they can be more 
competitive with more advertisers eligible for the auction, and they will potentially cost more 
than the specific keywords.
Two to three word keywords are generally a better choice for AdWords. They pre-qualify your 
users better, tend to get better Quality Scores in AdWords, and may be less competitive with 
fewer advertisers bidding on those terms.
If you'd like to use one-word and more general keywords, start 
by entering them in exact match to restrict any additional 
expansions to irrelevant variations.

AdWords does not provide information on what keywords your competitors are bidding on. 
However, there are a number of tools outside of Google that can help you analyze who's 
ranking on specific terms, as well as what keywords individual domains are showing up for.
Getting ready
Several competitor keyword tools provide free basic searches but do require monthly

How to do it...
We shall use SpyFu's SEM keyword tool to demonstrate how to access and review a list of 
keywords for a specific domain.
1.	 Go to http://www.spyfu.com/.
2.	 Enter a domain's URL into the Classic search box and click on SEARCH to see 
keywords a specific domain's ads are showing up for.
3.	 You'll get a general pay-per-click (PPC) summary with spend trends, as well as organic 
and paid keywords this domain is showing up on.

4.	 Choose to Export CSV at the bottom of the paid keywords list. 
5.	 If you purchased a subscription, you'll be able to download a full list of keywords a 
domain ran on.
6.	 You can sort this keyword list by clicks or cost per day to figure out a domain's best 
keywords.
7.	
Not all of the keywords from these reports will necessarily make sense for you. Make 
sure you scrub the list and only add the terms most applicable to our business.
How it works...
Competitor keyword tools do not access private AdWords accounts, and individual domains 
are certainly not sharing this data. Tools such as SpyFu gather public information provided by 
Google based on what's showing up on their search results pages.
There's more...
Remember that tools such as SpyFu do not have access to your competitors' accounts and 
that their keyword reports may not be 100 percent accurate. If a competitor is using a lot of 
broad match in their keyword list, keyword spy tools will pick up domain activity on keywords 
that are not necessarily in your competitor's AdWords campaigns.

Adding negative keywords to your account is one of the best methods you have at your

keywords will ensure you are not paying for traffic that you already know will not convert to 
sales and leads.
Getting ready
You'll need to do some research to generate a thorough list of negative keywords. Part of this 
process is using your common sense and thinking of potential related queries that will not be 
relevant. Aside from brainstorming potential negatives, you can also use the following tools:

Google.com: Search your most general keywords and pay attention to both

searches irrelevant?

Search term reports: Once your campaigns are up and running, you can run search 
term reports in AdWords to see actual search queries that triggered your ads. This 
will be a great source of ongoing negative keyword ideas that directly relate to your 
campaigns and keywords you have chosen.
Run search query reports once a week to identify new negative 
keywords to add to your campaigns. You'll get negative keyword 
ideas from actual searches that triggered your ads.
How to do it…
You can add negative keywords to individual ad groups or to an entire campaign, if the 
negative terms are applicable to all of the keywords within this campaign. To add negative 
keywords, perform the following steps:
1.	 Go to the Campaigns tab, and click on the Keywords tab.
2.	 Scroll down to the bottom of the keyword list until you see Negative keywords.
3.	 Use the column on the left to enter ad group specific negatives and the column on 
the right to enter campaign level negatives.

How it works…
Negative keywords are phrases that prevent your ads from showing on certain search queries. 
For example, if you add a negative keyword free to your campaign, any search that contains 
the word free will not trigger your ad.

Negative keyword lists should be thorough and include all possible variations, since AdWords 
does not include any variations of a negative phrase you add to your account. Expand your 
initial list of negative keywords to include singulars and plurals, synonyms and similar words. 
For example, if you decide that you would like to add the negative keyword jobs, you can add 
the following additional negatives:
f
f
Job

You'll likely be able to utilize some of the negative keywords you generate across your campaigns 
(such as free, images, and reviews). To automate the negative keyword generation process, 
you can create campaign negative lists to add to your account's shared library. You can then 
easily access these campaign negatives when you are creating new campaigns. In your AdWords 
account, go to Shared library and click to view Campaign negative keywords. Here, you can 
name your new negative keyword list and enter the specific terms that should be excluded.

Identifying keyword duplicates
Having duplicate keywords in your AdWords account is generally not recommended, as they 
compete against each other and make account management and analysis more difficult.  
I recommend going through your account periodically to identify duplicates, clean up, and  
get rid of any low performers to maximize performance.
Getting ready
The easiest way to identify if you have duplicate keywords in your account is by downloading 
your account to AdWords Editor. AdWords Editor allows advertisers to easily manage 
campaigns, keywords, and ads in bulk. You can do all of the work offline and typically much 
faster than through the AdWords interface. You can download AdWords Editor by visiting 
http://www.google.nl/intl/en/adwordseditor/.
How to do it…
To identify keyword duplicates:
1.	 Open up AdWords Editor and sign in to your account by entering your AdWords 
customer login and password.
2.	 Make sure to get recent changes before you proceed to download the latest version 
of your account. You can choose the Basic (faster) option. The download tends to be 
pretty fast, so the basic option may not be necessary.
3.	 When you get the option to select which parts of the account to download, select  
All campaigns and click on OK.

4.	 Go to Tools and select Find duplicate keywords.
5.	 Choose the campaigns that you'd like to compare.
6.	 Decide if you'd like to preserve the Word order. It usually makes sense to choose 
Strict word order.
7.	
Under Match types, select if you'd like to compare keywords with the same match 
type or different match types.
8.	 Under Location of duplicates, choose if you'd like to analyze the same ad group, the 
same campaign, or across selected campaigns. In most cases, you'll want to choose  
Across selected campaigns.
9.	 Under Optional: Hide duplicates, you can choose to hide the deleted, paused, and 
ended campaigns and ad groups. This will ensure any old campaigns or ad groups 
that you decided to pause are ignored by the analysis.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 5
99
10.	 On the next screen, you'll see all of your duplicates filtered out by campaign  
and ad group. The Select duplicates by tool will allow you to select and delete 
duplicates based on your chosen criteria, such as low CTR or average position.  
If you have duplicate keywords and one is getting a better CTR, keep the better 
performing instance.
11.	 You'll likely see some differences in performance between the duplicates in your 
account, and you will want to go through this list and pause or delete lower CTR or 
lower converting duplicates, so the better performing instances of your keywords get 
more exposure.
How it works…
AdWords discourages advertisers from using duplicate keywords across campaigns and ad 
groups. Only one keyword can trigger an ad per search in the auction. Identical keywords 
compete with each other, and the keyword with the higher ad rank will show and trigger the 
ads it is associated with.
There's more…
In some cases, it might make sense to have the same keyword in multiple campaigns, such 
as if you have different campaigns targeting desktops and mobile devices, or different 
campaigns for different location targets.
However, if the duplicate keyword is not on purpose and needs to be consolidated, use 
performance data when deciding which instance of the keyword to keep or remove.

Multiplying keyword phrases
As you build your keywords lists, you will find that you'll continue to use some of the words 
throughout your campaigns. For example, as a furniture business, you might combine the 
word furniture with specific furniture brand names. This process can be time consuming 
when done manually; however, there are a few free tools outside of Google that can help you 
streamline keyword expansion.
Getting ready
Build out your core terms and modifiers that you'll want to combine. I usually do this in Excel 
or Notepad, noting the structure, or what campaigns and ad groups the keywords should be 
added to.

in bankruptcy:

Changing broad keywords to broad  
match modifiers
Broad match modifier may be the right match type for customers who are seeing poor ROI from 
their broad match keywords. It's also a good option for those who are mainly using phrase and 
exact match and are not receiving enough traffic, but are wary of using broad match.
Getting ready
As a first step, I recommend running a search term report to see what actual queries your 
ads are appearing on. In your Keywords tab, go to Details and select All from the SEARCH 
TERMS drop-down menu. If the report shows a large percentage of irrelevant queries that are 
triggering your ads, broad match modifier may me the right keyword option for you.

103
How to do it…
To enter keywords in broad match modifier:
1.	 Add + before each word within your keyword string.
2.	 Make sure you do not enter in any extra spaces after the + sign; however, do add a 
space after each word within a keyword phrase.
The following are examples of correctly broad match modified keywords:
f
f
+buy +halloween +costumes
f
f
+halloween +costumes
The following are examples of incorrectly broad match modified keywords:
f
f
+ halloween + costumes (extra spaces should not be used)
f
f
Halloween+ costumes ( "+" should be used before each word you'd like to preserve, 
not after)
f
f
+halloween+costumes (you need to use a space between each word)
You can change keywords to broad match modifier in bulk by 
using Acquisio's free tool, available at the following link:
http://www.acquisio.com/ppc/google-adwords-
modified-broad-match-keyword-tool/
Paste the keywords you wish to modify and generate modified 
broad keywords with a click of a button.
How it works…
Broad match modifier is a match type in AdWords that gives you more control than the default 
broad match, but is still less restrictive than phrase match. It will show your ads on very 
close variations of your keywords, such as singulars, plurals, misspellings, abbreviations, and 
acronyms. Synonyms are not considered close variants. For each word that you put a + sign 
before, the user will have to type in a close variant in order to see your ad.

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Creating Relevant Keywords
104
There's more…
Changing your keyword match type from broad to broad match modifier could potentially cut 
down on some valuable relevant traffic, since broad match places you in auctions on keywords 
you did not think to add to your account, and broad match modifier restricts this expanded 
matching. To test the effects of implementing broad match modifier, you may want to run two 
identical ad groups, one with broad match keywords and another with the same list of keywords 
in broad match modifier. You can run both of these ad groups at the same time. Make sure that 
they have the same bids and ads, so that you are not introducing other variables into this test 
aside from the match type. Compare the two ad groups and review your key success metrics, 
such as conversion rates and CPA, before you change all of your broad keywords to broad 
match modifier. You can also test different match types with AdWords experiments.

AdWords provides bid recommendations for any keywords that have below 
first page bids. This means that some of your keywords may not be showing 
on the first page of Google.com and your bids might need to be increased to 
improve your ad rank or you need to work on improving your Quality Score. You 
can edit any keywords with bids below first page estimates and have AdWords 
automatically prefill CPCs to first page bids in the edit keywords table.
How it works…
Pausing or deleting keywords will ensure that your ads are not showing for terms that did not 
work for you. You can pause or delete poor performers, such as costly keywords that are not 
generating any conversions or low-quality keywords to boost ROI and account performance.
After you edit a keyword, AdWords reads it as a new keyword and impressions are reset back 
to zero. This includes editing the keyword's match type or altering the actual search phrase.
If you choose to delete a keyword, you will not be able to restore it if you wish to run it again, 
and you'll need to re-add it as a new keyword, starting with a fresh history. Pausing a keyword 
has the benefit of being able to restore it again, resuming its history.
If you move a poorly performing keyword to a new campaign or a new ad group with a unique 
ad, you can boost Quality Score by achieving a better CTR with more targeted ad copy.

Introduction
Ads are your opportunity to describe your business to potential customers and entice them to 
click through to your website. Since AdWords' ad character limits do not provide much space, 
you must convey your message concisely and choose carefully what to communicate. The 
most effective marketers test various messages and special offers to find the most effective 
ad copy that attracts visitors most likely to convert.

Researching competitors' ads
You likely already have some phrases and special terms in mind that you'd like to promote in 
your ad text. However, I would advise you to research what your competition is highlighting in 
their ad copy before you write your ads. If the specials and pricing you are considering are not 
as compelling as what's offered by your competitors, you might want to pick other areas of 
focus to make your ads stand apart.
Getting ready
Prepare a list of your most important keywords to research. Choose high-traffic keywords that 
show the highest impression volumes to start with.
How to do it...
Perform the following steps for researching competition on Google:
1.	 Visit https://www.google.com/ in your web browser.
2.	 Search your most important keywords and review the paid ads that show up.
3.	 Note the special offers, pricing, and calls-to-action that are being used in AdWords ads.

Chapter 6
115
Research competition on third-party tools, such as KeywordSpy or SpyFu.
1.	 Visit http://www.keywordspy.com/ or http://www.spyfu.com/ in your  
web browser.
2.	 Enter a keyword of interest into the search box and click on Search. For example, 
search for San Francisco dentist to see what competitors are showing ads  
on that term.
3.	 Scroll down to the Ad Overview list.
4.	 Note the special offers, pricing, and calls-to-action that are being used.
How it works...
Each ad auction on Google.com is real time and the ads that you see might change as you 
search on different days or from different locations. Your competitors are also continuing to 
adjust and refine their ads, so the results you see on one day may be different from ads a 
month later. I recommend regularly monitoring other advertisers in your industry to ensure 
your ads are competitive.
There's more…
Avoid looking up your own ad on Google.com, since you will accumulate unnecessary 
impressions and lower your own Quality Scores, which are Google's measure of relevance.  
Use the Ad Preview and Diagnosis tool in your AdWords account instead.

Setting campaign ad rotation
Each ad group can have multiple ads that will trigger the keywords within that ad group. 
The ads will rotate and either be displayed evenly or start to be preferred and optimized by 
AdWords, according to the settings you choose.
Getting ready
Here is what you'll need to consider when choosing ad rotation settings:
f
f
If you are not tracking conversions and would like to maximize clicks, choose the 
Optimize for clicks option. This is the default option when you create a new campaign.
f
f
If you are tracking conversions and your goal is to maximize conversions within a 
campaign, your best bet is to choose Optimize for conversions.
f
f
Are you A/B split testing ads within this campaign? If so, you should choose either 
Rotate evenly or Rotate indefinitely. A/B testing allows you to experiment and test 
the impact of using different ad elements, requiring an even number of impressions 
delivered to each ad.
How to do it…
To edit a campaign's ad rotation settings, perform the following steps:
1.	 Go to the Campaigns tab, and choose a specific campaign you'd like to edit.
2.	 Click on the Settings tab and stay in the All settings sub-tab.
3.	 Scroll down to the Advanced settings.
4.	 Under Ad delivery: Ad rotation, frequency capping, choose to edit Ad rotation.
5.	 After you select your ad rotation option, click on Save.

How it works…
In ad groups that have multiple ads, AdWords rotates ads at first evenly, and then eventually 
the more successful ads start to be preferred and will show more often. You have the option 
to choose how AdWords optimizes and rotates ads from the following options:
f
f
Optimize for clicks: This option shows ads that are expected to provide more clicks
f
f
Optimize for conversions: This option shows ads that are expected to provide  
more conversions
f
f
Rotate evenly: This option shows ads evenly for at least 90 days, then  
optimizes them
f
f
Rotate indefinitely: This option shows low performing ads more evenly with high 
performing ads, and does not optimize
When you first create a campaign, your ad rotation will by default be set to Optimize for 
clicks, and you'll need to change this setting if you prefer to rotate ads evenly or optimize 
them for conversions.
If you are tracking conversions, I recommend you change the 
default AdWords setting to optimize ad rotation for conversions 
across all of your campaigns. Ads that get the most clicks are not 
necessarily ads that convert the best, yet they may monopolize 
your budget and not allow the better converting ads to show if 
you are using the optimize for clicks ad rotation setting.
There's more…
Ad rotation is set at the campaign level, rather than the account or ad group level. This means 
that the ad rotation you choose will apply to all ad groups within a given campaign. AdWords 
does not offer the option to change ad rotation within a single ad group.

Creating effective ads
Your ad text is the only part of your account that users see. It is your opportunity to convey 
what you offer and why your website is worth taking a look at. However, the amount of space 
available for you to write your message in AdWords is limited, so you need to be careful in 
choosing what to communicate.

Getting ready
First, research your competition to understand how your pricing and special offers  
compare. Next, make a list of all of your most compelling product or service features  
you'd like to highlight.
Keep in mind the following five ad copy best practices:
f
f
Use your keywords in your ad text, ideally in your headline. When you use keywords in 
your ad text, they are made bold by Google, making the ad stand out more.
f
f
Prequalify your products or services, so your visitors know what to expect when they 
click on your ads. While attracting new visitors is important, you also do not want 
to pay for clicks that will not convert. Here are some ways you can ensure the right 
people are clicking:


Display your prices: This will help you attract visitors who are already OK 
with your price range.


Explain who should not click on your ads: This might eliminate some  
clicks but will help improve your ROI. For example, a mortgage lender can  
say For loans over $100,000 to weed out anyone looking for a loan  
of a lower amount.
f
f
Mention any discounts or special offers, first making sure that these offers are 
compelling in the industry and that your competitors are not offering more enticing 
deals. Examples include:


20% off

How to do it…
To write an ad, perform the following steps:
1.	 Go to the Campaigns tab, and navigate to the Ads tab or first choose a specific 
campaign and ad group you'd like to edit.
2.	 Click on the New ad button and choose Text ad from the list of possible ad formats.
3.	 If you did not choose a campaign and ad group already, you'll be able to do it on the 
next screen.
4.	 Write a headline in the Headline field. Ideally, your headline should contain some of 
your keywords.
5.	 Describe your product or service in Description line 1 and Description line 2. Mention 
any special offers and use a call-to-action. I generally describe the product and special 
offers in the first line and reserve the second line for a strong call-to-action.

6.	 Enter your URL in the Display URL ad text field.
7.	
Enter the address of your website where users will be redirected after they click on 
your ad in the Destination URL field.
8.	 If you would like an ad to be given preference on a mobile device check the Device 
preference box. For example, you may want to promote your local store or office 
with a mobile-preferred ad, which can be shown on desktops when there aren't any 
normal ads defined. Also, the mobile-preferred ads are only preferred over normal 
text ads—other kinds of ads (dynamic, image) may still show on mobile.
9.	 Click on Save ad.

Choosing landing pages
Your landing page or the destination URL is the website's URL you choose to take visitors to 
after they click on your ad. It should match the user's query and be as general or as specific 
as the keyword it is matched up with. Most visitors only spend seconds on a website before 
they decide if they should stay or leave. Taking your visitors to the right landing page helps you 
ensure that they find what they are looking for and do not bounce after clicking on your ads.
Getting ready
Familiarize yourself with your website's URL structure. Next, match the list of your AdWords 
keywords to the most relevant sections of your website. You can divide up your keywords into 
groups or themes and pick a URL on your website that best matches each group or keyword.
How to do it…
Following are the guidelines to keep in mind when choosing landing pages.
www.it-ebooks.info

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Writing Compelling Ads

Pick a URL that best matches your keywords
Your landing page should be as general or as specific as your keywords. Here is an example of 
landing pages you might want to pick for different sets of keywords if you sell mobile phones:
Keyword
Correct Landing Page
Incorrect Landing Page
Mobile phones
Home page with all available brands.
Specific brand or specific 
phone model.
Samsung 
phones
Samsung brand page with list of all 
available Samsung phone models.
Home page or specific 
Samsung phone model, such 
as Galaxy S4.
Samsung 
Galaxy S4
Page highlighting the Samsung Galaxy 
S4 phone, price, and link to buy.
Home page or a list of all 
Samsung phones.
To check if you picked the right landing page, ask yourself the question, "Does this page 
match the user's intent?" and monitor your bounce rates through Google Analytics.
Make sure your landing page is conversion friendly
Your landing page should be easy to navigate and conversion friendly. Visitors that arrive to 
each landing page should easily be able to spot the next step, be it to purchase from you 
online, download a whitepaper, sign up, or contact you.
The conversion activity should be prominently displayed on your landing page, ideally above 
the fold. However, I would advise against taking visitors directly to the product signup page or 
the checkout page as your AdWords destination URL, as most visitors will want to learn more 
about your products or services first.
How it works…
Your landing page is a part of your Quality Score. You can look up Quality Scores at the 
keyword level and see if there are issues with your landing page by going to the Keywords  
tab and hovering over the status box.

When a landing page doesn't match a user's query, it leads to a poor user experience and low 
quality ads that don't appeal to users and don't work for advertisers.
To determine your landing page experience, AdWords looks at the content of your page as well 
as your design. The following are the three most important factors to focus on:
f
f
Relevant and original content that's useful to visitors.
f
f
Transparency about what you do with information you may collect from your visitors. 
Easy to find contact and business information.
f
f
Ease of navigation without too many links or ads that might be distracting  
and confusing.
There's more…
You can choose to set landing pages or destination URLs either at the ad group level or at  
the keyword level. If you properly structure your campaigns into themed ad groups, I 
recommend you use ad group level destination URLs, rather than keyword level URLs. 
However, every time you change an ad's destination URL, its history resets, while this is  
not the case for keyword URLs.
If you are tracking conversions, you can test different landing pages and analyze conversion 
rates by A/B testing to find the landing pages that work best.

Implementing dynamic keyword insertion  
in ads
Dynamic keyword insertion is a tool that allows AdWords advertisers to automate their 
ads with a single piece of code in the ad copy. Keywords that users are searching on are 
automatically populated into the ad text, making the ad more relevant, and saving you hours 
of work. There are many benefits to using keyword insertion, but you should also be careful to 
avoid ads that don't make sense or aren't converting for you.
www.it-ebooks.info

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Writing Compelling Ads
124
Getting ready
If you decide to use dynamic keyword insertion, scrub your keyword lists of the following:
f
f
Misspelled keywords
f
f
Grammatically awkward phrases
f
f
Competitor terms
f
f
Keywords that do not make sense when inserted into your ad text
Keyword insertion should not replace proper account structure or be used with thousands 
of unrelated keywords all lumped into one ad group. Structure your keywords into relevant 
themes, and then use keyword insertion to make the ads even more relevant to every 
individual keyword within a well themed ad group.
How to do it…
To set up dynamic keyword insertion in your ad text, perform the following steps:
1.	 Enter the following piece of code into your ad: {KeyWord:Default Text}.
2.	 Choose default text that will be inserted into the ad if any of your keywords are not 
eligible. In the previous example, the default text is Red Shoes.
3.	 Keyword insertion is used most commonly in headlines. However, the code could also 
be placed in the rest of your ad text, as well as in your display and destination URLs. 
Keyword insertion in your destination URLs would be mainly used for reporting and 
tracking purposes.
4.	 Create separate ad groups with static ads that do not feature dynamic keyword 
insertion for any keywords that do not make sense when inserted into the ad text or 
are misspelled.
5.	 Make sure your landing pages are still relevant to the numerous variations you'll create.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 6
125
How it works…
Dynamic keyword insertion automatically inserts your keywords into a text ad with the 
following snippet of code in your ad: {KeyWord:Default Text}. The tool can help you 
generate hundreds or thousands of highly targeted ads instantly. Following is an example  
of how your ads could appear:
Keyword 
Your ad 
Red shoes
Buy Red Shoes
Huge Selection of Stylish Shoes.
Shop Today and Get 10% Off!
www.example.com
Cheap red shoes
Buy Cheap Red Shoes
Huge Selection of Stylish Shoes.
Shop Today and Get 10% Off!
www.example.com
Red designer shoes
Buy Red Designer Shoes
Huge Selection of Stylish Shoes.
Shop Today and Get 10% Off!
www.example.com
If the inserted term is too long for the AdWords character limits, the default word or phrase 
you choose will be inserted. Also, Google will only insert keywords that are actually in your 
account. For example, if your broad match keyword shoes generates an impression on term 
tap shoes that you do not have in your account as a keyword, phrase tap shoes will not 
appear in your ad.
There's more…
You can change the capitalization of the keyword that's inserted into the ad text by modifying 
the keyword insertion code. Here are the guidelines:
Keyword insertion snippet
How your ad will appear
{keyword:}
red shoes
{Keyword:}
Red shoes
{KeyWord:}
Red Shoes
{KeyWORD:}
Red SHOES
{KEYWord:}
RED Shoes
{KEYWORD:}

Standard AdWords editorial policies still apply, and you will most likely not be able to use 
excessive capitalization, unless your keyword is an abbreviation, acronym, or a trademark.

Avoiding common ad copy mistakes
Many advertisers write ads that do not follow best practices and tend to get low clickthrough-
rates. Keeping in mind common ad copy mistakes can help you avoid learning the hard way.
How to do it…
The following mistakes can hinder your ad performance:
f
f
Not using a call-to-action: Your ads should motivate visitors to take the next step and 
set the stage for what you would like them to do once they click on your ad.
f
f
Using your company's name in your headline: Unless you are a prominent brand, 
your company's name in a headline is wasting space that you could be using to 
highlight your keywords or special offers. One of the recommended times to use your 
company's name in a headline is if you are advertising company brand keywords.
f
f
Not using proper landing pages: Your ad destination URL should match your 
keywords and there should not be a disconnect between what your users are 
searching for and where they'll be taken when they click on your ad. Taking your 
visitors to a landing page that's too general or too specific will cost you conversions.
f
f
Not differentiating your company: Many ads are generic, play it safe, and fail to 
include why visitors should go with your business rather than a competitor's. If your 
ads look just like everyone else's, users will have little motivation to click on them and 
you'll suffer low CTRs.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 6
127
f
f
Not prequalifying visitors: Some advertisers are so focused on squeezing in special 
offers that they forget to explain what the users will see once they click on an ad. 
You can save costly clicks and improve your ROI by pre-qualifying your visitors and 
weeding out those that are unlikely to convert. For example, if you sell high-end 
furniture, you would benefit from setting the expectation rather than attracting 
visitors who cannot afford your products.
f
f
Focusing on product features instead of benefits: Don't talk about the product 
feature your customers are already aware of but how they will help their lives. If 
someone is looking for a lawn mower, they already know that it cuts grass. Think 
about the benefit to the consumer and play that up in your ads. Take some time to 
think about what your customers are hoping to find and how to present the solution 
to them.
f
f
Not understanding what's working: After setting up your campaigns, make sure to 
review performance regularly and take a note of what ad copy is generating clicks 
and conversions. You can re-use some of the phrases that worked in new ad copy 
tests and combine them with new discounts or calls-to-action.
f
f
Not testing: AdWords can be time consuming and many advertisers are so relieved 
when they set it up that they simply let the ads they initially created run without much 
follow-up. However, your savvy competition will be testing and coming back  
with their strongest offers, and so should you.
How it works…
Ads that get low CTRs not only cost you potential customers but also negatively affect your 
Quality Scores. Avoiding common pitfalls and writing compelling ads can help:

Split testing ad copy
Split testing ad copy or A/B testing compares the effectiveness of two different ad variations. 
Your first ad or the one that you find the most appealing will not necessarily be the one that 
will attract most of your visitors. Luckily, you get instant feedback on AdWords, where people 
vote through clicks and conversions to help you choose messaging that works best for you.
Getting ready
Brainstorm ad text elements you'd like to test, such as:
f
f
Different landing pages: If you are not sure what landing page would work better for 
a certain group of keywords, you can run two identical ads that are taking visitors to 
a different destination URL. Metrics such as conversion data can help you determine 
which landing page generates a better ROI.
f
f
Calls-to-action: Test different phrases that entice users to take your desired  
action after the click. For example, you can test Register Now against Sign-Up 
For Free.
f
f
Headlines: You can try static headlines against dynamic keyword insertion. Or, 
headlines that are phrased as a question.
f
f
Ad text descriptions: Test audience specific phrases, such as Family Friendly or 
different ways to describe the product or its benefits. You can also compare different 
special offers, or using a percentage discount versus a specific price discount.
f
f
Display URL: Add extra words to your display URL to squeeze in extra language 
into a limited ad space. For example, you can test www.example.com against 
www.example.com/Free_Trial in your display URL. If you do not have enough 
characters, you can leave out www. from your display URL.
Determine your goals or what metric you will be evaluating. If you are looking for more clicks, 
CTR will be your metric to watch. If your goal is to increase conversions, you should evaluate 
conversions, conversion rate, cost-per-conversion, and ROI.

How to do it…
To run an A/B split test, perform the following:
1.	 Choose the campaign and ad group where you would like to run the test. The  
high-traffic ad groups are a good place to test. You can also create a new campaign 
and ad group for the test.
2.	 Set your test campaign's ad rotation settings to Rotate evenly so the test ads get 
even exposure.
3.	 Choose your control, and determine what ad you would like to use as a baseline. One 
of your current top performers would be a good choice.
4.	 Create a test ad within the ad group where you are performing the test. This ad group 
should only have two ads, your control and your test.
5.	 Keep the ads you are testing identical, except for the element that you are trying to 
compare. So, if you are trying to evaluate if one call-to-action will perform better than 
another, keep the headlines, ad descriptions, and the ad's destination URL the same, 
except for the call-to-action you are A/B testing.
6.	 Let the ads compete. Accumulate enough data so the differences are significant. How 
long you'll need to run the test will depend on how much traffic you'll get. If you'd like 
to ensure that the data differences between your control and test ads are statistically 
significant, you can enable Experiment settings in AdWords, which you can locate in 
your campaign Settings page.

7.	
Measure test performance; if you are looking for more clicks, compare CTRs. The ad 
that generates a better CTR will be your winner. If your primary goal is conversions, 
evaluate conversion metrics. 
8.	 Pause the loser and keep the winner. Decide for yourself what defines a winner. If you 
have a 0.1 percent increase in CTR, it might not be good enough. Re-iterate and aim 
for doubling your CTR.
9.	 Continue testing and refining to stay ahead of your competition.
How it works…
An A/B test involves testing two versions of an ad to compare which ad generates more clicks 
or more sales. You will see that 50 percent of your visitors are exposed to one version of your 
ad, while the other 50 percent see another ad version. In the AdWords interface, you can 
evaluate real time results of each ad to determine which one generates a better ROI. Some 
tests will show great results, and others won't. However, testing is always better than guessing.
There's more…
Once you test different ad elements, you may wish to implement the winning ad phrases 
across other ad groups in your account. For example, if you find through ad copy testing that 
Save 20% works better than using Get $5 Off, you can apply that learning in your other 
ads, as appropriate.

Editing your ad text
One of the great features of AdWords is that you can change your ad copy at any time to 
match the latest promotions. Unlike with traditional print advertising, changes you make  
can go into effect within minutes.
If you have a high performing ad, do not edit it; pause it instead, creating new ads when you 
want to run special promotions. If you edit a high-performing ad, that resets its history back  
to zero.

How to do it…
To edit a single ad, perform the following steps:
1.	 Navigate to the Campaigns tab and click on the Ads tab.
2.	 Hover over the ad you'd like to edit until you see a pencil icon, then click on it. This 
will bring up the Edit window box, where you'll be able to edit any part of your text ad.
3.	 Make the necessary edits and click on Save to save your ad.
To edit ads in bulk, perform the following steps:
1.	 Sign in to your AdWords account.
2.	 Navigate to the Campaigns tab and click on the Ads tab.
3.	 In the search box, type in the phrase you'd like to edit. For example search for  
Free Shipping.
4.	 Select the ads you'd like to edit by clicking the box in the menu bar.

How it works…
When you edit an ad, AdWords deletes your previous version and creates a new ad. All of your 
statistics, such as impressions or clicks, start back at zero. The new ad may still need to go

Pausing or deleting ads
You can pause or delete ads in AdWords at any time. For example, you may need to pause

Introduction
One of the great selling points of AdWords is that budgets are flexible and you can start 
advertising and testing the system with only a few dollars. You also choose how much you  
are willing to pay for individual clicks. Advertisers can lower or increase AdWords budgets 
and bids at any time, based on changing business needs. This makes for an extremely cost 
effective advertising solution that's flexible and easy to modify without long-term contracts  
or budget commitments.
Setting and adjusting campaign budgets
All advertisers have budgets for their various marketing efforts, including AdWords. If you are 
new to AdWords, your budget should be an amount you are comfortable testing with, while you 
refine your campaigns and figure out what works for you.
Your AdWords budget controls how often your ads are shown. The greater your budget, the 
more impressions your ads will receive. However, your budget should still be an amount you 
are comfortable spending on AdWords.
Start small while you test keywords and ads that generate the 
best response. Once you figure out which campaigns convert, 
you can easily increase your daily budgets.
Getting ready
Decide how much you would like to spend on each product category or service. Are some of 
your products of greater priority to you? If so, make sure that you have the structure in place 
to support separate budgets with unique campaigns for each category that should have its 
own budget.
How to do it...
To set a budget for a new campaign, perform the following steps:
1.	 Click on + New campaign in the Campaigns tab.
2.	 Scroll to the Bidding and budget section of the campaign Settings page.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Chapter 7
137
3.	 Enter the daily budget you would like to set for your campaign in the Budget box.
4.	 Click on Save and continue.
To adjust a campaign's budget, perform the following steps:
1.	 Sign in to your AdWords account, and click on the Campaigns tab.
2.	 In the campaign overview page, hover next to the campaign you'd like to edit and click 
on the budget amount you'd like to adjust. In this example, we see a $10 daily budget 
that we can change to a new amount.
www.it-ebooks.info

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Budgets and Bidding
138
3.	 You can also adjust a campaign's budget by navigating to that campaign's  
Settings page.
4.	 Enter the new amount and click on Save.
How it works...
AdWords budgets are set per day, rather than per month. Multiply the daily budget amount 
you choose by days in a month to figure out how much you'll spend in a given month.
Daily budgets are set per campaign and will apply to all ad groups and keywords within that 
campaign. If you have multiple campaigns, add up each campaign's budget to figure out your 
total AdWords budget. For example, if you have 5 campaigns with a $10 daily budget each, your 
total daily budget would be $50 and you should be prepared to spend up to $1500 per month.
Because daily traffic patterns vary, AdWords may deliver more clicks and go over your actual 
budgets on the busier days when there is more traffic available. This is to make up for the 
slower days, when the system does not deliver enough traffic to maximize your daily budget.
There's more…
Your budget controls ad delivery or how often your ads will be shown. If your budget is more 
conservative and less than the recommended amount, AdWords slows ad delivery and shows 
your ads only intermittently, to avoid going over your set budget. This means that your ads 
might not be displayed every time a user searches your keywords. Limited budget is one of the 
most common reasons advertisers are not seeing their ads when searching on Google.com.

The Evaluating your current budget and potential impact of budget changes recipe
Evaluating your current budget and  
potential impact of budget changes
Budget ideas is a tool in AdWords that can help you evaluate if there is more potential for 
traffic within your campaigns, as well as how many more clicks you could get if you increased 
your budget.
Getting ready
Most advertisers do not have unlimited budgets and will not be able to afford increasing 
their spending to maximize all available clicks. Before you increase your budget, make sure 
a campaign is profitable first. Review your conversions and cost-per-conversion data and 
consider increasing your budget if the campaign is cost effective.

different budget increases can impact clicks and costs.
3.	 Choose your new budget amount and click on Apply now to increase your budget.

How it works...
The AdWords Limited by budget message means that your ads are not shown as often as they 
could be if your budget was higher. Your current budget is below the system-recommended 
amount to maximize impressions and clicks. Your ad delivery slows throughout the day to avoid 
going over your set budget, and your ads are not showing every time your potential customers 
are running a search for your keywords.
There's more...
If you are unable to increase your budget to the system-recommended amount, you can also 
lower your bids to get more clicks out of a limited budget.

The Setting and adjusting ad group level bids recipe
Setting and adjusting ad group level bids
Bidding competitively in an ad auction is a key ingredient in obtaining your desired ad position 
and getting traffic to your website. While your budget controls how often your ads are shown, 
your Max cost-per-click (CPC) controls your ad rank, or where your ads show on Google.com.
Getting ready
Decide how much you are willing to spend on each set of keywords. Analyze average CPCs  
for similar terms using Google's keyword tool as well as third-party tools, such as SpyFu,  
which you can access at http://www.spyfu.com/. Keep in mind that SpyFu only  
provides data for the US and UK. If you need international data, try KeywordSpy at  
http://www.keywordspy.com/ or SEMrush at http://www.semrush.com/.
How to do it...
To set an ad group bid in a new campaign, perform the following steps:
1.	 Click on + New campaign in the Campaigns tab.

3.	 Navigate to the ad group you'd like to edit and click on the Default Max. CPC amount 
you'd like to adjust.
4.	 Enter the new amount and click on Save.
How it works...
Your ad group bid is the most that you are willing to pay per click for all of the ad group's 
keywords. The ad group's max CPC will apply to all keywords within an ad group, unless you 
set keyword level bids, which then override ad group bid defaults. The higher your max CPCs, 
the greater your chances of achieving a better ad rank and a top spot.

In addition to being able to set ad group level bids, which apply to all keywords within an ad 
group, you can also set keyword level bids. Individual keywords within an ad group will perform 
differently, and you'll want to consider increasing bids for low position keywords or decreasing 
max CPCs for keywords that are not profitable.
Getting ready
Before you adjust bids, research keyword performance. Pay special attention to the  
following keywords:
f
f
Costly keywords with no conversions or few conversions: Decrease bids for 
keywords that you are spending money on but that are not converting. For example, 
with a target CPA of $10, decrease bids on keywords that are generating conversions 
at a $15 CPA.

Keywords below first page bid: Consider increasing bids on keywords that are not 
shown on the first page of Google's search results.
f
f
Cost effective keywords: Increase bids for keywords that are generating profitable 
conversions to boost ad rank and get more clicks. For example, with a target CPA of 
$10, increase bids on keywords that are generating conversions at a $7 CPA.
How to do it...
To set or adjust keyword level bids, perform the following steps:
1.	 Click on the Campaigns tab.
2.	 Click on the Keywords tab.
3.	 Find the keyword you'd like to adjust the bid for and click on the Max. CPC field. Enter 
a new max CPC value and click on Save.
4.	 You can also adjust keyword bids by selecting one or multiple keywords and choosing 
Change bids from the Edit menu.
How it works...
Each ad group has a default bid, which applies to all of the keywords within an ad group, 
unless you set keyword level bids. If you set a keyword specific max CPC, that bid overrides  
the ad group level default values.

Enabling enhanced bidding
AdWords offers several tools that help you maximize conversions and get more out of your 
budget. Enhanced CPC (eCPC) changes your bids by lowering them on keywords that are less 
likely to convert, and increasing bids on keywords that do convert.
Getting ready
You will need to have implemented conversion tracking in your AdWords account. There are no 
minimum conversion requirements to start using eCPC, which means that you can enable this 
feature as soon as your campaigns start generating conversions.
How to do it...
To enable enhanced bidding, perform the following steps:
1.	 Click on the Campaigns tab, and click on the campaign you'd like to enable eCPC in.
2.	 Navigate to the Settings tab.
3.	 Scroll to the Bidding and budget section of the campaign Settings page.
4.	 Under Bidding option, mark the checkbox under Enhanced CPC.
5.	 Click on Save.

How it works...
Enhanced CPC automatically adjusts your max CPCs up or down for each auction with the  
goal of increasing conversions while maintaining your CPA. If you enable eCPC, AdWords  
could increase your bids up to 30 percent more than your original bid.

The Enabling Conversion Optimizer recipe
Enabling Conversion Optimizer
Savvy advertisers measure conversions and adjust bids based on how much they are willing 
to pay for each conversion. This can be done manually by regularly reviewing your conversion 
data, or you can take advantage of Conversion Optimizer in AdWords. It uses historical data 
to predict which clicks are more valuable to you and adjusts bids in real time to maximize 
conversions without additional work on your part.
Getting ready
In order to use Conversion Optimizer, you will need to implement conversion tracking in your 
AdWords account and your campaign will need to have received at least 15 conversions in the 
last 30 days. If your campaign did not generate 15 conversions in the last 30 days, you will 
not have the option to enable Conversion Optimizer and you will need to wait until you receive 
the required number of conversions.
How to do it...
To enable Conversion Optimizer, perform the following steps:
1.	 Click on the Campaigns tab.
2.	 Click on the campaign that you'd like to enable Conversion Optimizer for.
3.	 Go to the Settings tab.
4.	 Scroll to the Bidding and budget section and click to edit Bidding option.
5.	 Select Focus on conversions (Conversion Optimizer). If the campaign is not eligible 
to use Conversion Optimizer, you will not be able to select this option.

6.	 Choose from:

Start with recommended bid: AdWords will show you what target CPA it 
recommends based on the last 30 days of conversion data. If you are new  
to CPA bidding, I recommend you go with this option.


Start with custom bid $: You can enter your own custom target CPA bid 
you'd like AdWords to optimize for. Maybe you are OK with a slightly higher 
CPA than the system-recommended bid. If you choose a higher bid than the 
system-recommendation one, your CPA will increase and you'll also get more 
clicks. On the other hand, if the most recent CPA average is too high, you 
can enter a lower target CPA bid. Keep in mind that entering a bid lower than 
the recommended amount may help lower your CPA but it will also limit your 
traffic, since Conversion Optimizer will need to bid less to stay within your 
lower target CPA.


Starts with previous target CPA bids: If you previously used Conversion 
Optimizer and disabled it, you can go back to your previous target CPA bids.

How it works...
Conversion Optimizer adjusts your bids automatically with the goal of getting the most 
possible conversions out of your budget. It lowers bids on less profitable keywords and 
increases them on keywords that are more likely to convert.
Conversion Optimizer takes into account historical conversion information, such as the 
customer's location and times of the day conversions are likely to take place. The more 
historical conversion data you have, the better the tool is able to predict which clicks are 
valuable. Advertisers with limited conversion data may not see the best results, so do not  
rush into using the tool.
If you are not happy with the results that you get while using Conversion Optimizer, you can 
disable it at any time. Your bids will revert back to the max CPCs you were using prior to 
implementing Conversion Optimizer.
It will take a couple of weeks or longer, depending on how 
much traffic your campaign receives, before you'll be able 
to gauge the effects of using Conversion Optimizer. Analyze 
your CPA and conversion rate before and after enabling 
Conversion Optimizer to assess its effectiveness and if you 
should implement it across other campaigns.
There's more...
Your conversion rate and average CPA depend partly on other factors, besides the bidding option 
you are using, such as seasonality, what your competition is doing, changes in your pricing, 
website, or changes to your keywords and ads. Once you enable CPA bidding, do not make too 
many changes to your campaign while you evaluate the effects of Conversion Optimizer.

Setting separate bids for calls
For many businesses, calls are more important than clicks or even web-based leads.  
Getting to talk to someone who's considering your product or service directly can make  
the difference between converting that person to a lifelong customer or losing a sale to  
a competitor. Because Google understands just how valuable phone calls are, AdWords  
offers Max. CPP (cost-per-phone call), which is the option to set unique bids for calls.
Getting ready
You'll need to enable call extensions in AdWords and choose to use Google's call forwarding. 
The feature is only available in select countries.
Before you are able to bid separately on calls, you'll also need to meet a number of calls that 
came via your call extension. If you do not yet meet that threshold, you will see Ineligible Bid 
in the CPP Bid column.

How to do it...
To set max CPP bids, perform the following steps:
1.	 Click on the Campaigns tab, and then click on the campaign where you'd like to set 
unique bids for calls.
2.	 Click on the Ad groups tab.
3.	 Click directly in the ad group table on the Max. CPP row and enter a new max CPP

from the Edit tab.
5.	 Click on Preview changes to see which ad groups will be edited, and choose Make

How it works...
Max CPP (cost-per-phone call) is the maximum amount you are willing to pay per phone call 
through call forwarding. The minimum CPP you can use is $1. Your max CPC, or the most you 
are willing to pay per click, can be less than your max CPP.

In order to be able to set max CPPs, you'll need to use call extensions with Google's call 
forwarding. With call forwarding, Google shows a toll free phone number in your ads, which 
forwards to your business phone number.
There's more...
If you decide to use max CPP, you'll only pay if someone decides to call the call-forwarding 
number from your ad. If a customer clicks through to your website and calls the customer 
support number on your home page, you will not pay Google for that call.

Modifying mobile bids
The default option for all new advertisers when creating accounts is to have all campaigns 
opted into all devices, including computers, tablets, and mobile phones. However, you can and 
should adjust bids for mobile, depending on what types of results you are getting.
Getting ready
Analyze past mobile performances to determine how much traffic you received from mobile 
and how this traffic has historically converted for you. If conversion rates are on par with 
computers and tablets, leave mobile bids the same as the default. If mobile conversion rates 
are much lower, decrease the bids. On the other hand, if you get better performance from 
mobile, you can also increase bids to capture even more mobile traffic.

Visit your website on a mobile device to see if it's mobile friendly. If the user experience is not 
ideal and it's difficult to navigate your website on a smartphone, decrease bids. Also, consider 
investing in a mobile-optimized website, which will become increasingly vital as the mobile 
user's base continues to grow. Explore http://www.howtogomo.com/ to see how your 
current website looks in mobile and to find additional resources.
How to do it...
To modify mobile bids, perform the following steps:
1.	 Go to the Campaigns tab.
2.	 Click on the specific campaign you'd like to edit.
3.	 Go to the Settings tab and select Devices.
4.	 The screen will show you your campaign's past performance for all three devices.

5.	 Next to Mobile devices with full browsers, click in the Bid adj. column.
6.	 Choose from Increase by or Decrease by and enter your % change.

To opt your campaign out of mobile completely, choose Decrease by and enter 100%.
8.	 Click on Save.
How it works...
Mobile bid adjustments help you increase or decrease bids for mobile devices. Bid 
adjustments are set as a percentage of your default bid.
Mobile bid adjustments are not compatible with Conversion Optimizer, so if your campaigns 
are taking advantage of CPA bidding, modifying bids will not have any effect. However, you 
can still opt for a Conversion-Optimizer-enabled campaign for mobile devices by using a 
100-percent mobile bid decrease. Mobile bid adjustments are not compatible with Conversion 
Optimizer since this feature already takes into consideration devices users are searching from 
when adjusting bids.

Currently, AdWords does not provide an option to modify tablet bids. They are the same as the 
default computer bids.

The Optimizing bids for ROI recipe in Chapter 11, Optimizing Performance
Adjusting location bids
With some recent improvements to AdWords, advertisers can now modify bids for different 
locations all through a single campaign. Location-specific bids can help you achieve higher 
ad rank in places where you get the best response and spend less in regions and cities that 
don't work as well. For example, a retailer selling snow tires can set higher bids for customers 
searching from snowy Colorado than for people who are located in sunny California.
Getting ready
First, you'll need to analyze the results you are getting from you current target locations.  
To see location specific data, follow these steps:
1.	 Click on the Campaigns tab.
2.	 Choose a campaign to focus on and click on the Settings tab.
3.	 Click on Locations.
4.	 From the Location details drop-down menu choose What triggered your ad or 
Where your users were. The option Where your users were reports on the physical 
location of users that saw your ads. The option What triggered your ad also includes 
locations users were searching for or viewing pages about.

5.	 Choose the geographic level of detail. Your options are:


Country/Territory


Region

Most specific location
6.	 Review performance data by geographic level of interest (such as by city), including 
conversions. Are some regions performing better than others? If you do not have 
historical data, think about where your products or services are the most successful.
How to do it...
Once you understand which locations are performing better, you'll be able to adjust bids 
through the Locations setting of your campaign.
1.	 Click on Locations to see location details.
2.	 Sort by performance metric of interest, such as Cost / conv. (1-per-click).

3.	 Select low performing locations and go to Add targets and set bid adjustments.  
For low performers, choose Decrease by and enter a % amount. Click on Add.
4.	 Next, select your high performing regions, go to Add targets and set bid 
adjustments, and choose Increase by with a specific % amount. Click on Add.
Location bids are adjusted at the campaign level and this process will need to be repeated for 
additional campaigns for which you wish to modify bids.
How it works...
Location bid adjustments allow you to increase or decrease bids for specific locations within a 
single campaign. Bid adjustments are set as a percentage of your default bid.

Running Display Ads

Introduction
The Google's Display network (GDN) helps advertisers reach a greater audience through ads 
that show on websites outside of Google.com, such as news, blogs, and a variety of popular 
or niche websites. The Display network can be a great supplement to search campaigns. 
It helps advertisers reach customers who may not be searching for products and services, 
but can still be enticed by relevant ads as they browse the Internet. A well-executed display 
campaign can lift your search performance and helps build trust as people move through the 
purchase funnel.
Before creating display campaigns, define who you would like to reach. As a best practice, 
always keep search and display campaigns separate, so that you can use separate budgets 
and analyze and maximize each network's potential.
If you are mainly interested in branding, you have the option to pay for impressions on GDN 
through maximum CPM (cost-per-thousand impressions) bidding. With CPM bids, you pay for 
impressions rather than clicks. However, for advertisers who are interested in sales or leads 
(most advertisers), max CPC bidding is the recommended bidding option for display.
Creating an automatic placements 
campaign
If you are new to Google Display, I recommend you start with automatic placements. This 
is where AdWords shows your ads on relevant websites based on your keywords and other 
factors. You have the option to simply opt a search campaign into the Google Display network, 
however, that is not the recommended setup. I recommend creating a new AdWords campaign 
targeting Google Display only, so you can allocate a separate budget and customize other 
settings for display.
Getting ready
Decide how much of your budget you'd like to allocate for testing display. Start with a smaller 
budget until you evaluate if display will work for you while you optimize your campaign.

How to do it...
To create an automatic placements display campaign, perform the following steps:
1.	 Click on the Campaigns tab.
2.	 Click on + New campaign to create a new campaign.
3.	 Choose Display Network only:
4.	 Name your campaign. I recommend including Display in your naming convention for 
easier reporting and analysis.
5.	 Choose your target locations and languages.
6.	 Choose your bidding option. I recommend you start with I'll manually set my bids for 
clicks for greater control over how much you bid on each ad group.
7.	
Set a daily Budget. Start small while you optimize and evaluate the effectiveness  
of display.
8.	 Click on Save and continue.
9.	 Next, you'll create your first display ad group. Choose an ad group name that reflects 
the theme of the keywords you'll add.
10.	 Choose your Default bid value. This is the most you are willing to pay for clicks in  
an ad group.

11.	 Under Choose how to target your ads, select Display Keywords:
12.	Enter your keywords into the keyword box and click on Find related keywords for 
additional ideas. Select a small, targeted keyword list of 3 to 5 keywords and no more 
than 20 keywords. Smaller keyword lists tend to work better on the Display network. 
Keywords are used to identify websites with similar themes and therefore function 
very differently from keywords in your search campaigns. You do not need to use 
misspellings or be too specific with your keyword lists, as this might filter out too  
many relevant websites.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Chapter 8
167
13.	Click on Save and continue.
14.	 Next, create an ad. You can run image, display rich media, text, and video ads in your 
display campaigns. If you have image or video ads, you can add them to your campaign.
15.	 If you do not have an image ad, you can use the Display ad builder feature to create 
one. Keep your ad targeted to your keyword list and follow other ad copy best practices, 
such as including calls-to-action and special offers. You do not need to add all ad 
formats at once and can come back to add in additional ad formats at a later time.
16.	 Click on Save ads when you are done.
17.	 Create additional ad groups following the same guidelines of small keyword lists and 
targeted ads. I recommend you start with several display ad groups, rather than just 
one, as they will likely perform differently based on the keywords and ads you choose.
How it works...
With automatic placements, AdWords uses your keywords and other factors to match your 
ads to relevant placements that are part of Google's Display network. Rather than choosing 
specific placements to show ads on, AdWords places your ads based on your ad group's 
theme, matching it up to relevant websites on the Display network through contextual 
targeting. For example, if you have an ad group with keywords related to dog toys, your ads 
could show next to an article that discusses dog training techniques.
There's more...
The easiest way to get started with AdWords display is to create a campaign that's a mirror 
version of your search campaign, customized for the Display network. You can quickly create 
a duplicate version of your search campaign with AdWords Editor. Copy and paste an existing 
campaign and make sure to select the appropriate networks for your new display campaign 
under the Campaigns tab. You might need to make some edits to your keywords, removing 
keyword misspellings and keywords that are too specific, keeping your keyword lists small and 
targeted. Keyword match types are not relevant for display campaigns, so you should just use 
the broad match modifier.

Creating a managed placements campaign
In addition to letting AdWords contextually target ads based on your keywords (automatic 
placements), you can choose specific websites you'd like to show ads on (managed 
placements). This is a good strategy for advertisers who only want to show ads on specific 
websites and want more control over where their ads are shown.
Getting ready
Brainstorm websites or types of websites where you'd like your ads to be shown. These 
properties may or may not be part of Google's Display network, but you'll be able to research 
them and find similar websites as you create your campaign.
How to do it...
To create a managed placements display campaign, perform the following steps:
1.	 Go to your Campaigns tab.
2.	 Click on + New campaign to create a new campaign.
3.	 Choose Display Network only.
4.	 After choosing all of the relevant campaign settings and your budget, click on  
Save and continue.
5.	 Name your new ad group and choose the Default Bid value. This bid will apply to all 
placements you choose within this ad group, unless you set placement-specific bids, 
which will override the default ad group bid.
6.	 Under Choose how to target your ads, select Use a different targeting method and 
select Placements:

In the next step, you'll be able to search for placement ideas by entering a word, 
phrase, or website. The tool provides data on how many impressions each placement 
receives as well as what ad types (text ad, image ad, audio ad, or In-Stream ad) each 
placement accepts. The In-Stream ads are video ads that appear as an ad break 
before or during YouTube partner videos.

8.	 Select the placements you'd like to add and click on Save and continue.
9.	 Add text, image, display, or video ads to your ad group. Add a combination of different 
ad formats for greatest reach.
10.	 You can create additional ad groups with different placements or types of websites.
How it works...
Placements are websites, specific pages on a website, app, or ad units within a webpage 
where AdWords shows ads. A website needs to be part of Google's Display network to be  
eligible as a placement. You'll also need to win a bid in each ad auction in order for your  
ads to be shown.
To maximize reach, set competitive bids, especially if you are 
targeting popular websites.
There's more...
In addition to selecting specific placements to show ads on, you can narrow your targeting 
further by the following criteria:
f
f
Display keywords: Ads will be shown on websites relevant to keywords you add
f
f
Audiences: Ads will be shown to people based on their interests, types of websites 
they visit, and if they previously visited your website (remarketing)
f
f
Topics: Ads will be shown on pages about specific topics or sub-topics
f
f
Age: Ads will be shown to people that fall into specific age ranges
f
f
Gender: Ads will be shown to males or females
If you combine multiple display targets in one ad group, you restrict your ads to be shown 
only to those users who meet all of your chosen targets. For example, if you use keywords 
and placements in one ad group, your ads will only be shown on specific websites that you 
selected when the content of a publisher's website is relevant to your keywords. Keep in 
mind that if you layer on too many targets at once, you may be restricting your ad visibility to 
a very narrow audience. In the following screenshot, you can see an example of how using 
placements and keywords together in one ad group can restrict your reach:

Targeting display sites based on topics
If you would like to cast a wider net on display and show your ads to a collection of websites 
related to certain topics, such as travel or news, you can do so through AdWords display. This 
is a good option for those who are not sure what specific websites to target on display or may 
not have the time to research and add individual placements to their campaigns. You may also 
want to try this approach if you are not getting enough traffic from your display campaigns, 
and if your CPA goals are more flexible.
Getting ready
Think about topics that would be relevant to your business. Do not limit yourself to just the 
most specific topics, but try other, more loosely related topics as well as ones that your target 
customers are likely to browse. For example, if you sell diet products, you may want to target:
f
f
Weight Loss
f
f
Fashion & Style
f
f
Food & Drink
While you can add topics to an existing display campaign, I recommend creating a separate 
campaign for topic targeting. This allows you to bid and use your budget more effectively.
How to do it...
To add topics to your display campaign, perform the following steps:
1.	 Click on the Campaigns tab.
2.	 Click on + New campaign to create a new campaign.
3.	 Choose Display Network only.

all topics you choose within this ad group, unless you set topic—specific bids, which 
override the default bid.
6.	 Under Choose how to target your ads, select Use a different targeting method and 
select Topics.

On the next screen, you'll be able to search for topics with your key phrases, or you 
can browse available topics. There are also numerous sub-topics that you can pick 
and choose from:

Running Display Ads

How it works...
Topic targeting on the Google's Display network lets you show ads on websites related to 
specific topics, such as finance or biotech. Google analyzes the keywords on a page to 
determine the topic of the page, categorizing it into topics and sub-topics. If you choose to 
target via topics, your ads will be shown on websites related to topics you choose to add to 
your campaign.
There's more...
You can further pre-qualify topic targeting by layering on keywords or specific placements in 
addition to topics. If you choose to use keywords in combination with topic targeting, your 
ads will only show on pages that meet both criteria you selected. For example, if you choose 
the Finance topic and add keywords about agriculture, your ads could show on the finance 
section of a local news website featuring an article about agricultural stock prices.

Excluding irrelevant and poorly performing 
placements
If you are running display campaigns, you should periodically review performance on specific 
placements to ensure that your ads are shown on quality pages that meet your goals. This is 
especially important if you are running keyword-based, interest- or topic-targeted campaigns, 
where AdWords places your ads on pages you may not have chosen. If your ads are shown on 
low-quality placements, or placements that generate clicks without any conversions, you can 
exclude them in AdWords and block such websites from displaying your ads.
Getting ready
Before you start excluding specific placements, review their performance. Specifically, pay 
attention to the following:
f
f
High-cost placements that generated zero conversions.

Avoid displaying your ads on certain pages
You can exclude an entire set of topics from showing your ads on Google's Display network. 
This strategy can help you get more out of display by blocking all irrelevant websites related  
to certain subjects at once.
Getting ready
Review the campaign's performance and individual display placements where your ads have 
appeared. If you notice that certain types of websites, such as gaming websites, show your 
ads but are not relevant to your audience, consider excluding gaming topics.
How to do it...
To exclude topics, perform the following steps:
1.	 Go to your Campaigns tab.
2.	 Click on the display campaign you'd like to add exclusions to.
3.	 Click the Display Network tab.
4.	 Scroll down to the bottom of the screen and click on Exclusions.

If you are showing ads on the Display network, you can exclude entire categories of websites 
and pages, which discuss potentially sensitive topics from showing your ads. Your display 
traffic will be more efficiently targeted and you'll prevent your ads from appearing on 
questionable pages.
Getting ready
The category exclusions that are most pressing to exclude are:
f
f
Crime, police & emergency
f
f
Death & tragedy
f
f
Military & International Conflict
f
f
Juvenile, gross & bizarre content
f
f
Profanity & rough language

2.	 Go into a campaign targeting display.
3.	 Navigate to the Display Network tab.
4.	 Scroll down to the bottom of the page and open up Exclusions.

How it works...
Excluding categories prevents your ads from showing on certain potentially sensitive 
categories of web pages, such as pages about crime, death, and sexual content. You can also 
block your ads from showing on certain types of websites, such as parked domains, error 
pages, games, social networks, and more.
AdWords cannot guarantee that your ads will never show on pages related 
to the topics or categories you excluded. Review placement data regularly 
and exclude individual pages you do not want your ads to show on.

To add image ads to your campaign, perform the following steps:
1.	 Click on the Campaigns tab.
2.	 Go into a campaign targeting display.
3.	 Click on the ad group to which you'd like to add image ads to.
4.	 Navigate to the Ads tab.
5.	 Click on + New ad and select Image ad from the drop-down menu.

How it works...
Image ads use a picture or interactive graphic to present your products and services visually. 
They generally follow the same policies as text ads and also have the technical requirements 
outlined at http://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/bin/answer.py?hl=en-

Creating rich image ads with Display Ad 
Builder
Google's Display Ad Builder is a tool that helps you easily create image ads without any  
prior graphic design experience. The tool is available for free to all advertisers using  
Google AdWords.
Getting ready
Prepare product images or company logos you'd like to use. Make sure that you own or have 
the necessary permissions to use the images you plan to leverage.
Review your search ad text performance to find descriptions, special offers, and call-to-action 
phrases that perform best for you. You'll want to add these phrases to your image ads as you 
build them with the Display Ad Builder tool.
How to do it...
To create image ads using Google's Display Ad Builder, perform the following steps:
1.	 Navigate to the Ads tab.
2.	 Click on + New ad and select Display ad builder from the drop-down menu. Here, you'll 
be able to choose a template from one of the many different themes and formats.

3.	 Choose one of the ad templates provided by AdWords. Search by Industries, Seasons 
and events, or select General Purpose for more generic templates. The Advanced 
section contains ad formats, which allow you to showcase multiple images with 
different URLs or expandable ads that show additional information at the click of  
a button:

4.	 Once you have selected a template you'd like to use, follow the screen prompts to 
create your ad. The elements you'll need to fill in will vary, depending on the template 
you choose.
5.	 Generally, you'll need to first name your ad. Choose a name that's descriptive of the 
products or offers you are promoting.

6.	 Write a headline and description in the Headline and Description fields. Follow the 
same best practices as for text ads. Be informative and descriptive and include special 
offers and calls-to-action. You can customize text colors and fonts, if necessary.
7.	
Add a company logo. 
8.	 Customize your Click button field with language that best fits your offer. You can also 
change the button font and color.
9.	 Add a product image or multiple images, depending on your template.
10.	 Customize background colors, if you'd like to adjust the color scheme provided in  
the template.
11.	 Write in your Display URL and Destination URL values.
12.	Always use the Ad preview feature to see what your ads would look like in all 
available ad sizes. Your images or logos might be difficult to see or even illegible 
in some ad sizes, or the text might not fit properly together. Some of the templates 
allow you to adjust the various text and image elements by ad size. Make sure to go 
through each ad size in the Ad preview screen and make any necessary adjustments.
13.	Click on Preview and Save. If you do not like how your ad appears in a specific ad 
size, you can unselect that ad in the Ad preview screen.
14.	 Once you click on Save, AdWords will populate your ad group with all of the display ad 
sizes you have chosen.
You can edit the ads you created with the Display Ad Builder tool at any time, if you need to 
update your images or text. Continue to experiment with additional templates to test alternate 
formats, colors, and messaging.
How it works...
Google's Display Ad Builder is a free tool that helps advertisers create professional looking 
display ads. Advertisers can choose from hundreds of available templates, different fonts, 
colors, and images, or upload their own logos, images, and video. Each template also allows 
for text to be customized and easily updated directly in your AdWords account.
There's more...
The Suggested ads feature in the Display Ad Builder will scan your website and automatically 
generate relevant ads by pulling in text and images into multiple ad variations you can choose 
from. You can further refine and customize the ads by clicking on one of the suggested options.

Analyzing relative CTR to benchmark  
display performance
CTR on display is typically much lower than CTRs you're used to seeing from your search 
campaigns. Instead of comparing your display CTR to your search CTR, a more useful metric 
would be to understand how your display ads fare against other display campaigns. To help 
you analyze and benchmark how your display CTR compares to other ads, AdWords provides 
the Relative CTR metric in your account.
How to do it...
To view relative CTR, perform the following steps:
1.	 Click on the Campaigns tab. You can also view Relative CTR at the ad group level.
2.	 Click on Columns and choose Customize columns.
3.	 Under Competitive metrics, scroll until you see Relative CTR:
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 8
191
4.	 Click on Add to add the metric to your dashboard and click on Apply to save  
your settings.
5.	 You should now see Relative CTR as a metric in your campaign dashboard. The 
average Relative CTR is 1x, and you should aim above that (such as 1.5x). If your 
Relative CTR is under 1x (such as 0.5x), consider optimizing your display campaign.
How it works...
Relative CTR is a measure of how your ads perform on Google's Display network when 
compared to other ads appearing on the same pages. It's calculated by dividing your  
CTR by the average CTR of all advertisers appearing on your placements.
The average Relative CTR is 1x, which means that your CTR equals the average CTR of all 
advertisers on the same pages. If your Relative CTR is higher than 1x (such as 2x), your ads 
are getting better clickthrough-rates than other ads on the same placements.
Relative CTR is available at the campaign and ad group levels, however, it doesn't work with 
campaigns that use CPM bidding as a bidding strategy.
There's more...
Search and Display Quality Scores are completely separate. On Google's Display network, 
AdWords also considers your performance on a site, in addition to your ad's relevance and 
your landing page. Like on Google Search, a more relevant and high CTR ad on the Google 
Display network will help you be more competitive in an ad auction. If your CTR is lower than 
average, you may want to take the following actions:
f
f
Exclude low performing and irrelevant placements. These include any placements 
that have lower CTRs than other placements, but make sure to not exclude 
placements that are generating profitable conversions.
f
f
Add new ads, pausing the lower performing ad copy.
f
f
Add image and rich media ads, in addition to text ads.
f
f
Create more themed ad groups to allow AdWords to better target your ads to  
relevant placements.
f
f
Pause low performing keywords, if you are running a display campaign that uses 
keywords to target.

Remarketing to Past Visitors

Introduction
Have you noticed ads that seem to just know what you want to buy, following you around the 
Web? I recently searched for "tennis shoes," visiting various websites but did not buy from any 
of them. Over the next few days, wherever I went on the Internet, be it my favorite news website 
or a blog I regularly read, I kept seeing ads for tennis shoes that I recently researched. This is 
called remarketing and is also referred to as retargeting in the world of online marketing.
Remarketing allows you to reconnect with users who previously visited your website as they go 
on to browse the Display network, setting you up for a second chance to convert. Remarketing 
can be an extremely powerful method of reminding your potential customers of your brand or 
reconnecting with them as they click on your ads but navigate away from your website without 
performing the desired action. This can help you look like a big brand, even if you are on a 
small budget.
If you are advertising with Google, you can set up remarketing through your Google AdWords 
campaigns. To get started, you'll need to place some code on your website, define your 
audiences or who you'd like to target, and create a separate campaign for remarketing.
Generating the remarketing code
The first step of setting up remarketing is adding the remarketing code to your website. You'll 
need to access this code in your AdWords account, where it might be pre-populated already 
for you. If not, you can easily set it up.
You can also create remarketing lists through Google Analytics by editing your Analytics 
tracking code. For additional details about setting up remarketing lists through 
Google Analytics, see the article at https://support.google.com/analytics/
answer/2611270?hl=en&ref_topic=2611283.
Getting ready
You'll need to have an AdWords account to use Google's remarketing. You'll also need to add 
the code to your website, so make sure you have access to the website's code or get in touch 
with your webmaster, if someone else edits your website for you.

How to do it...
To generate the remarketing code in your AdWords account, follow these steps:
1.	 Sign in to your AdWords account.
2.	 Click on the Shared library link at the bottom-left corner of your campaign 
management page.
3.	 Click to View the shared settings for Audiences.

4.	 Click on the Set up remarketing prompt to set up remarketing.
5.	 Next, AdWords will show you the code that you'll need to add to every page of your 
website, right before the </body> tag. You can copy and save this code for later, 
or send it to your webmaster. This is your Main list that AdWords automatically 
generates for you.
Do not use the code from the example below. Your 
remarketing code is unique to your AdWords account.

6.	 Click on Continue to create specific audiences you'd like to reach with your ads.
How it works...
AdWords automatically pre-populates a Main remarketing list that you can access in your 
shared library. Once you add this single tag to your entire website, you'll be able to create as 
many lists as you want based on sections of your site that people visit.
There's more…
If you don't see a Main list, you can create one by following these steps:
1.	 Click on the Shared library link at the bottom left of your campaign management page.

optional list description, such as All visitors.
7.	
Click on Save and you'll be taken to the screen where you can see your audiences 
and access their tags. Click on the Main list [Tag] to copy and paste the remarketing 
code snippet at the bottom of each webpage, just before the closing </body> tag in 
your source code.

The Creating remarketing audiences in AdWords recipe
Creating remarketing audiences in AdWords
With AdWords, you have the option to target broad as well as highly specific audiences via 
your remarketing campaigns. For example, you can target all visitors or only those who 
browsed certain product pages but did not convert. Segmenting who you remarket to allows 
you to tailor your ads to visitors you already know are interested in your website. You can 
further customize messaging with personalized ads based on what content someone browsed 
on your website.
Getting ready
If you have not done so already, go through the prompts to enable remarketing in your account 
and generate the Main list remarketing code. Add this code to all pages of your website.
Next, define your audiences or what segments of visitors you'd like your ads to reach. Here are 
some recommended audiences:
f
f
All visitors: Anyone who came to your website. This is the most basic and simple way 
to set up remarketing but also the least targeted.
f
f
By products or services: You could target users who visited specific pages on your 
site with custom ads and messages. You could take this further and only target 
visitors to specific pages who did not convert.
f
f
Converters: You could target those who already purchased a product or became a 
lead and continue to nurture your relationship with past customers.
f
f
Non-converters: All visitors minus those that purchased a product or became a lead. 
Targeting such audiences can remind your non-converting visitors of your brand and 
entice them to come back to your site and convert.
f
f
By membership duration: You can segment visitors by the number of days a 
cookie stays on your remarketing list. For example, you could create a shorter 7-day 
audience list to show one message, and a longer 30-day list audience for a different 
message or offer.
How to do it...
In this section, I'll go through examples of how to create an audience of users who visited 
specific product pages and an audience of all visitors who converted.

To create a remarketing audience for users who visited specific product pages, follow  
these steps:
1.	 Go to your Campaigns tab.
2.	 Click on Shared library at the bottom-left corner of your screen.
3.	 Click on View to view your Audiences.
4.	 Choose + New audience and select Remarketing list.
5.	 Select the first option, Define a list of site visitors based on the selection below.
6.	 Next, define what URLs should be included in this audience. You'll be able to choose 
if your URL contains or does not contain the specified parameters. If your URLs are 
descriptive and contain words such as "roses" or "tulips" you can use these words to 
include all URLs with these terms in them. If your URLs are not descriptive, you can 
still create audiences around common parameters within your URL structure. You can 
also be more specific by including a specific URL for your audience by choosing the 
equals option. Here are all of the available options to define your list:
7.	
After defining your URL parameters, choose your membership duration. The default is 
30 days, but you can choose up to 540 days. Your membership duration should follow 
your sales cycle. For example, if you have a short sales cycle of a few days, your ads 
should not follow your customers long after they have decided not to buy. However, if 
you have a typically longer sales cycle of a few months, such as expensive machinery, 
longer remarketing membership duration is more appropriate.

list definition or Start with an empty list. If you choose to include past visitors, the 
list will include visitors from up to the past 30 days that still fit your list definition.
Click on Save.
If you track conversions in AdWords, you can easily create a remarketing audience for users 
who converted:
1.	 In your shared library's Audiences section choose + New audience and select 
Remarketing list.
2.	 Select the second option, Define a list of site visitors by placing a new tag on

Creating custom remarketing combinations 
via rules
Custom combinations enable advertisers to further define and segment visitors based on 
multiple criteria. For example, they allow you to remove customers that already converted  
from your remarketing list and avoid spamming existing customers who already purchased 
your product.
Getting ready
You'll need to first enable remarketing in your AdWords account and add the code to your 
website. Then, decide what custom audiences you'd like to target. I suggest you start with one 
of the following:
f
f
All visitors except for those that converted already.
f
f
Visitors to specific pages or categories of pages except for those that converted already.
f
f
Visitors who abandoned the shopping cart. This is one of the most effective ways to 
target via remarketing, as you can reach someone that was already considering a 
purchase but did not yet complete it.
If you'd like to create custom combinations for the above audiences who did not convert, you'll 
first need to create remarketing lists for all visitors, visitors to specific pages, and shopping cart 
visitors. Then, you'll exclude anyone that's already converted from your custom combination.

Setting up a remarketing campaign
In order to show remarketing ads, you'll need to set up a separate campaign in AdWords. This 
campaign should target the Google Display network (rather than Google Search) and will not 
require keywords, but should be built around audiences you'll add to individual ad groups.
Getting ready
Before setting up a remarketing campaign, you'll need to:

Create remarketing audiences for visitors you'd like to target
How to do it...
To create a remarketing campaign, follow these steps:
1.	 Click on the Campaigns tab.
2.	 Click on + New campaign to create a new campaign.
3.	 Choose Display Network only.
4.	 Name your campaign and pick your locations and languages. 
5.	 Under Bidding and budget in your campaign settings page, choose I'll manually set 
my bids for clicks and enter your budget.
6.	 Click on Save and continue.
7.	
Next, create your first ad group. Your remarketing campaign should have separate ad 
groups for your different remarketing audiences. For example, your campaign could 
have the following remarketing ad groups:


Ad group #1: All visitors


Ad group #2: All visitors except for those who converted


Ad group #3: All shopping cart abandoners


Ad group #4: Specific product or category shopping cart abandoners  
(for example, Levi's 501 jeans shopping cart abandoners)
8.	 Name each ad group after the remarketing audience you'll target. This will allow you 
to prioritize bids and evaluate performance based on each remarketing segment.
9.	 Set a Default bid, keeping in mind that the higher your bid, the greater the likelihood 
that your ads will show.
10.	 Under Choose how to target ads, select Interests & Remarketing.

13.	Write a text ad on the next step. You can also add image or video ads, or build an ad 
using Google's Display ad builder.
Use a combination of text and image ads for greatest reach. Your 
message should be customized to the audience you are trying 
to reach. For example, if you are targeting visitors who did not 
convert, your ads should remind them why your brand is awesome 
or you can offer customers special discounts for coming back.

How it works...
Remarketing allows you to show ads to users who previously visited your website after they 
leave and go on to browse other websites on the web. After adding a piece of remarketing 
code to your website, you can create custom lists to target specific segments of visitors and 
deliver them customized messages.
The costs are the same as for other AdWords campaigns. You only pay when someone clicks 
on your remarketing ads or sees them (depending on if you're using CPC or CPM bidding 
methods) and you set your own bids and budgets.
There's more…
After you set up remarketing, continue to test and experiment with audiences and campaign 
settings while keeping a close eye on results. As you tailor the campaign to your many unique 
audience segments, you can make powerful connections with your customers and improve 
your ROI.

Setting remarketing bids
You'll need to bid competitively on your remarketing ad groups in order for your ads to show 
on Google's Display network. You'll be competing against all of the other advertisers who are 
running remarketing campaigns as well as against other ads targeting the Display network. 
Keep in mind the purchase cycle and your different remarketing audiences as you decide how 
much to bid on each segment.
Getting ready
You'll need to create a remarketing campaign and multiple ad groups for your different 
audiences. Creating separate ad groups for each remarketing audience will allow you to  
better segment and bid separately based on priority.

How to do it...
1.	 First decide if you'd like to use Max Cost-Per-Click (CPC) or Cost Per 1000 
Impressions (CPM) bids. I recommend going with CPC bids if you are direct response 
focused. You can choose and adjust your bidding strategy at the campaign level in 
your remarketing campaign setting page.
2.	 Once you have chosen your bidding strategy at the campaign level, you'll set actual 
bids at the ad group level. Start with a higher initial bid to be competitive in the  
ad auction.
3.	 Set different bids for individual ad groups with your different remarketing audiences. 
Your bids should be lower for lower funnel audiences (such as All Visitors) and 
higher for audiences further along the conversion cycle (such as Shopping cart 
abandoners). Here is an example of how you might want to set your initial bids 
based on the different remarketing segments:
Remarketing Ad Group
Max CPC
All visitors
$2
All visitors except for those who converted
$2.1
All shopping cart abandoners
$2.2
iPhone 5 shopping cart abandoners
$2.3
4.	 Monitor impressions, clicks, and conversions, and adjust based on results. If you are 
not getting enough impressions and clicks, try increasing your Max CPCs. If your ad 
groups are getting a large number of clicks without any conversions, lower Max CPCs.

How it works...
The following bidding strategies are available for remarketing campaigns:
f
f
Max CPC: The maximum amount you are willing to pay for each click. Your Max CPC 
affects your ad rank on Google's Display network. Increasing Max CPC increases your 
ad rank and improves your chances of ads appearing.
f
f
Max CPM: The maximum amount you are willing to pay for 1,000 impressions. 
You pay for impressions, rather than clicks. CPA bidding is most appropriate for 
advertisers focused on branding.
f
f
CPA: specify a Target or a Maximum CPA bid and Google's Conversion Optimizer will 
help you maximize conversions within your targets based on historical information. 
Your remarketing campaign will need to have received at least 15 conversions in the 
last 30 days to be eligible.

Setting frequency caps to limit how often 
ads show
Many advertisers considering remarketing campaigns are concerned about inundating their 
visitors. In fact, you could alienate your customers by spamming them with ads that constantly 
follow them around. To protect your brand, you can set frequency caps in AdWords, which 
by default Google does not enable in your campaigns. However, it's easy to set this up and 
it can make the difference between a highly effective remarketing ad and a customer never 
purchasing from you again.
Getting ready
Decide how often you'd like your ads to show to past visitors. Advertisers differ on how often 
they like to show their ads to past visitors, and I recommend testing different frequency caps 
to find what produces the best results. There is no right or wrong impression cap limit, and 
you'll want to test to figure out what's most effective for you. I recommend starting with 3 to 5 
impressions per day and adjusting from there.
You can limit impressions by the following criteria:
f
f
Campaign
f
f
Ad group

I like to set my impressions caps per campaign to ensure all ads within a remarketing 
campaign show only a predefined number of impressions. However, your strategy will differ 
based on your goals, and I recommend you experiment with different settings.
Keep in mind that just because an impression was served, that 
does not mean that someone actually saw your ad. The ad could 
have appeared below the fold, or the person simply may not have 
noticed it while browsing the Google Display network.
How to do it...
To set impressions caps in your remarketing campaign, follow these steps:
1.	 Click on the Campaigns tab.
2.	 Click on your remarketing campaign and go to Settings.
3.	 Scroll down to Advanced Settings and click to expand the section Ad delivery: Ad 
rotation, frequency capping.
4.	 Click on the Edit option under Frequency capping.
5.	 Set your desired impression cap and choose if you'd like to limit impressions per day, 
per week, or per month. Also choose if you'd like to limit impressions for the entire 
campaign, an ad group, or per ad.
ad.
6.	 Click on Save.
How it works...
Frequency capping in AdWords limits the number of times your ads show to each user on  
the Google Display network over a given time period. By limiting how often ads show to the 
same person, you can protect your brand and ensure remarketing ads are not spamming  
your customers.
You can set impression caps per day, per week, or per month. You can also cap impressions 
by campaign, ad group, or an ad.

Increasing traffic to your remarketing 
campaign
If your remarketing campaign is not getting enough impressions and clicks, you can make 
some changes to increase reach and ensure your ads are showing as much as possible. Since 
with remarketing you are reaching users who already showed interest in your website, your 
settings can be less restrictive while still reaching an extremely targeted set of visitors.
How to do it...
To ensure maximum visibility, try making some of the following changes:
f
f
Budget: Is your remarketing campaign consistently reaching or is close to reaching its 
daily budget? Try increasing it to get more impressions and clicks.
f
f
Bids: Increase bids to be more competitive in the ad auction against other advertisers.
f
f
Location and language targeting: Relax your location and language targeting settings.
f
f
Frequency capping: Try increasing impression caps (if you have frequency capping 
enabled) to increase impressions or how often ads show to each user.
f
f
Ad scheduling: Review ad scheduling to make sure ads show all days and hours and 
you are not restricting your remarketing campaign too much.
f
f
Remarketing audiences: Consider creating new remarketing audiences to capture 
additional visitors.
f
f
Delivery method: Set your campaign's ad delivery method to Accelerated, so ads 
show as soon as possible.

Remarketing to YouTube viewers
AdWords remarketing now allows you to reach viewers who interacted with your YouTube 
videos, helping you strengthen your brand and relationship with your YouTube audience. 
By showing tailored ads to viewers who chose to interact with your videos or your YouTube 
channel, you can increase ROI with custom ads unique to YouTube interactions.
Getting ready
To get started, you'll need to link your AdWords and YouTube accounts first, if you have not 
already. To link your YouTube account to AdWords, choose to create a new online video 
campaign in your AdWords account.

After you choose this new campaign type, you'll see an option to link your YouTube account 
to AdWords. You'll need to enter your YouTube credentials using the e-mail address and 
password on the account that owns your YouTube channel.
Once you sign in, you'll be automatically redirected to AdWords, and you should see your 
channel linked to your AdWords account.
How to do it...
Once your YouTube and AdWords accounts are linked, you'll need to access your video 
remarketing lists.
1.	 Sign in to your AdWords account.
2.	 Click on All video campaigns at the bottom left of your campaign management page.
3.	 Access the Video remarketing lists under the Shared library section.

audiences, which AdWords automatically populates for you.
5.	 After choosing your list type, click on Create list and fill in the list name, membership 
duration, and any other necessary parameters.
6.	 Once you've decided who you'd like to remarket to and have created your audiences, 
set up a new remarketing campaign, adding the YouTube audiences you just created 
as your targets. Make sure to customize ad messaging for the audience you are 
reaching and include relevant offers and calls-to-action.
How it works...
YouTube remarketing helps you reach viewers based on their past interactions with your 
videos and your YouTube channel. With YouTube remarketing you can automatically create 
remarketing user lists without adding any additional pixels to your website. You can choose to 
remarket to users who watched or liked specific videos, and subscribed or unsubscribed from 
your channel. You can even create custom audiences and combinations to further subdivide 
who sees what message. For example, you can remarket to anyone that's viewed a video but 
did not yet convert through your site.

Introduction
AdWords offers rich and detailed reporting to help you analyze ad performance and get the 
most out of your investment. For example, you can find out where your most valuable clicks 
are coming from and use that data to set up regionally targeted campaigns. You can also 
analyze how your website visitors using different devices (such as tablets versus mobile) 
convert and make adjustments to your campaigns based on trends you observe. Successful 
advertisers review their reports regularly and react to the traffic and conversion patterns. This 
chapter highlights some of the key reports to pay attention to as well as ways to react to the 
data to maximize your ROI.

Running and scheduling reports
Running reports in AdWords is easy and can be done in the campaign management section 
of your account. In addition to seeing the data in the interface, you can choose to download 
reports to one of the many available formats (such as .pdf or Excel.csv) as well as schedule 
reports to be e-mailed on a regular basis to account users.
Getting ready
If you would like to schedule reports to be automatically e-mailed to specific e-mail addresses, 
make sure they are listed as users on your AdWords account. If they are not, you will need to 
invite them.
Here are the basic reports I recommend you run on a regular basis:
f
f
Campaigns
f
f
Ad groups
f
f
Keywords
f
f
Ads
How to do it...
To view, schedule, and download AdWords reports, follow these steps:
1.	 Navigate to the Campaigns tab.
2.	 One of the most basic reports you'll want to analyze on a regular basis is an account 
summary of all of your campaigns. However, you can also run reports on your ad 
groups, keywords, ads, and many other segments using the same steps outlined in 
the following example.
3.	 Adjust the date range at the top-right corner of your campaign management page to 
reflect the period you are interested in analyzing. You can choose to review all time 
data, or most recent performance, such as this week or the last 30 days. You can 
also enter custom date ranges and turn on the Compare dates feature to compare 
recent performance to the same period last year, for example.

Customizing columns to personalize  
data views
Once your campaigns have been set up, there are many different pieces of data that you can 
analyze in AdWords. AdWords allows rich customization of your campaign management page, 
so that you are looking at data that is most pertinent to your analysis. The default view will 
most likely not include all of the information that you'll need as you review performance and 
optimize, and you'll need to customize the views to include the metrics of interest.
Getting ready
Think about what data is useful for a particular analysis. For example, you may wish to  
review performance data at the campaign level so that you can decide which campaigns  
are generating the most clicks and conversions.
How to do it...
To personalize your data views, follow these steps:
1.	 Click on the Campaigns tab.
2.	 Choose the sub tab you are interested in, such as Campaigns or Keywords.
3.	 Click on Columns and select Customize columns.
4.	 Select the metric you wish to further segment. The available metrics will be different 
based on what sub tab you are looking at. For example, in your Campaign sub tab, 
you will see the following options:


Performance


Conversions


Attributes


Call details


Competitive metrics

5.	 Once you select the metric of interest, you'll be able to further select columns within 
each metric. Click on Add to see the data you are interested in.
It can be overwhelming and distracting to look at all possible columns at once, so limit your 
views to the information that's most pertinent to the analysis at hand.
How it works...
Users with access to your account have their own custom campaign management views 
based on their unique settings. You cannot customize data views for other users. However, 
once you select your settings, you will see the same columns the next time you log in.
There's more...
You can save your preferred view or create multiple views for different types of goals and 
toggle back and forth between those settings. This can be useful for different types of 
analyses, such as analyzing Google Analytics data or analyzing competitive metrics.

You can also remove certain data from being shown or re-order the metrics at any time so the

Analyzing the days and times when ads 
perform best
Curious if your customers are searching for you more during the week or on weekends? How 
people interact with your website likely depends on the day of the week and even the time of 
the day. For example, if you sell pizzas, people are more likely to search for you in the evenings 
than early in the morning. To help you figure out your traffic patterns, AdWords provides a 
report where you can analyze impressions, clicks, and conversions by day and hour.

Getting ready
In order to run this report, your campaigns will need to have accumulated some data. If you 
are already restricting your campaigns to show only during certain days and hours via ad 
scheduling, keep that in mind, as it will skew your totals.
How to do it...
To view performance by day or hour of the day, follow these steps:
1.	 Click on the Campaigns tab.
2.	 Go to the Dimensions tab.
3.	 From the View drop-down menu, choose Time and select from one of the  
available options:

5.	 You can apply these segments to the entire account or select individual campaigns 
and ad groups. You can view data for a specific campaign's ad groups by selecting 
them from the left navigation menu in your campaign management page.
6.	 You can sort your data by your chosen time segment or by performance metrics, such 
as impressions, clicks, or conversions. Customize your columns, adding additional 
metrics of interest to see the data that's most important to you.
7.	
If you find that certain days of the week or hours of the day bring you more traffic or 
convert better and your budget is limited, you can implement ad scheduling to take 
advantage of these patterns and maximize clicks during high traffic periods. Schedule 
ads to run during key days and times through your campaign settings page.
How it works...
The Dimensions tab allows you to analyze data across different periods of time, such as by 
day of the week or by hour of the day for your entire account or by campaign or ad group.

7.	
If you find that certain locations perform better for you, you can increase bids through 
your campaign settings page. This can help you get a better ad position and even 
more clicks from your most important locations.
How it works...
The geographic report allows you to analyze performance across different countries, regions, 
metro areas, or cities.
The Most specific location column shows the most detailed information available, such as 
the postal code (the most specific location data varies by country).
The Location type column indicates whether an impression was matched by physical location 
(where a user was physically located) or location of interest (location a user was searching for 
or viewing content about).
Geographic performance data is available for the entire account or you can choose to analyze 
individual campaigns and ad groups.
There's more…
The geographic report can help you fine tune performance by concentrating your budget  
and bids on areas that produce the best results, For example, if you find that you get a lot  
of clicks from a certain region but these clicks are not converting, you might want to exclude 
this region.

Reviewing call details
Many people searching online prefer calling a business as they do their research. If you are 
using AdWords call extensions with Google's call forwarding, AdWords will record call data 
associated with the phone number that appeared in your AdWords ads. This information can 
help you measure the effectiveness of your campaigns beyond just the click-based metrics.

You'll need to be using call extensions with Google's call forwarding number to get detailed call 
reports. Google's call forwarding extensions are currently only available to advertisers in the 
US, UK, and Germany.
How to do it...
To review call details for calls that came through Google's call forwarding number:
1.	 Click on the Campaigns tab.
2.	 Go to the Dimensions tab.
3.	 Adjust the date range to reflect the period you are interested in analyzing.

Call details are also available in your campaign and ad group tabs. You'll need to 
customize columns to see call data in your dashboard summary page. The following 
columns are available:


Phone impressions: The number of times your ad was shown with a Google 
call forwarding number


Phone calls: The number of valid calls received through your Google call 
forwarding number


PTR: Phone-through-rate or the number of calls received divided by the 
number of times your phone number was shown

Segmenting performance reports 
Segments in AdWords allow you to further split up your performance data and take your 
reporting to the next level. For example, you can segment how your campaigns perform on 
Google Search versus Search Partners or compare performance by device. Segments arm you 
with the tools necessary to pinpoint trouble areas or what's working for you.
How to do it...
To segment your AdWords data, follow these steps:
1.	 Go to the Campaigns tab.
2.	 Click on the tab you are interested in examining further. Most tabs have segments but 
the available segments will vary depending on if you are analyzing your campaigns, 
ad groups, ads, keywords, or display.

3.	 Click on Segment and choose one of the available options, such as Network.
4.	 Adjust the reporting date range to see data for the periods of time you are interested 
in analyzing.
5.	 Select None from the Segment drop-down menu to remove the segment or apply a 
different one.
6.	 Make changes based on what you learn from your segments. For example, if you find 
out that clicks from mobile devices do not perform as well as clicks from computers, 
decrease mobile device bids.
How it works...
Segments allow you to split up reports into multiple rows to further analyze various aspects of 
your AdWords performance. The segment options you'll see will vary depending on which tab 
in your campaign management page you are analyzing.
The following segments are available:

Creating filters to customize reporting
Filters can help you further slice your reports to identify areas of improvement or to analyze 
how certain sets of campaigns or strategies are performing. For example, you may wish 
to filter out in your reports poorly performing keywords, evaluate how branded versus not 
branded campaigns perform, or analyze ads featuring special promotions.
Getting ready
You'll need to name your campaigns by using common terms that will help you filter. 
For example, name all campaigns that do not include non-branded keywords with NB. 
Alternatively, you can create labels to group certain campaigns together and apply a label  
to each campaign that should be included.
Evaluate your goals, such as desired CPA and maximum CPA you are willing to tolerate. Keep 
these goals in mind when you set up various performance centered filters.

How to do it...
To create a filter to isolate groups of campaigns, follow these steps:
1.	 Click on the Campaigns tab.
2.	 Adjust the date range at the top right of your campaign management page.
3.	 From the Filter drop-down menu choose Create filter.
4.	 In this example, we'll create a filter to analyze all non-branded campaigns. In the 
previous step we renamed all campaigns that do not include branded keywords 
by appending a common identifier such as NB to the campaign name. Next, after 
clicking to create a filter, choose Campaign name, select contains, and write in NB or 
any other words you wish to filter campaigns by. If you are using labels, you can also 
filter just by your NB label.
5.	 Check Save filter to access it again at a later date and click on Apply.
In the next example, we'll create a filter to isolate costly keywords that are not converting.
1.	 Go to your Keywords tab and click on Create filter.
2.	 From the Conversions drop-down choose Conversions (1-per-click), select <=, and 
enter in 0.

3.	 Click on + Add another and from the Performance drop down choose Cost and write 
in a specific amount. For example, if you target CPA is $10, you may wish to analyze 
all keywords that have accumulated over $10 but have not converted.
Save the filter if you plan to use it again, and click on Apply.
Save your most commonly used filters to easily access them at 
any time and use them with different date ranges. Filters you 
create are user-specific and will not be available to another 
user who has access to your account.
How it works...
Filters help you isolate campaigns, ad groups, keywords, or other account segments by 
predefined criteria to help you better analyze performance. AdWords may provide certain 
predefined filters in your account or you can create custom filters to focus on metrics specific 
to your goals.
You can add multiple layers to each filter and save these filters for future use and analysis.
There's more…
Here are a few common filters you may wish to set up and review regularly:
f
f
Keywords below first page bid. This is a predefined filter that you can access in 
your keywords tab. It shows you all of the keywords with ad rank below the first page. 
Consider raising your bid and work on improving your Quality Score. For example, 
refine your ad or add negative keywords to increase CTR.

f
Costly keywords without any conversions. Keywords that accumulate a certain 
amount in spending without generating any conversions. Consider lowering bids, 
creating new ads, adding negative keywords, or pausing these keywords.

f
Campaign or ad group performance filters. Create filters to isolate campaigns and 
ad groups converting above or within your target CPA. Use this data when budgeting 
and to help you bid and prioritize optimization efforts.
f
f
Ad filters. You can analyze how certain sets of ads performed against others. For 
example, you may wish to review how ads featuring "Free Download" fared against 
ads that used the call-to-action "Download Now."

Evaluating sitelink extensions
Sitelink ad extensions can help boost your CTR and make your ads stand out with additional 
relevant page links. However, some sitelinks perform better than others and there are some 
sitelinks that may need to be re-worded or eliminated completely based on performance.
Getting ready
First, you'll need to set up sitelink extensions in at least one of your campaigns and your 
extensions will need to have been approved to run. Your sitelinks may not show all the time, 
depending on performance and ad position. Also, each sitelink needs to direct customers to 
a unique landing page. If a sitelink stops showing, check if it was disapproved and make the 
necessary edits.
How to do it...
1.	 Click on the Campaigns tab.
2.	 Go to the Ad Extensions tab.
3.	 Select Sitelinks Extensions from the View drop-down menu.
4.	 Each of your sitelinks will have impression, click, cost, and other data you choose to 
view. Make sure to customize columns to include conversion data and other metrics 
on interest.

5.	 Next, go to Segment and choose Click type to see sitelink specific data. Segmenting 
by click type shows you how many people are choosing to click on a particular sitelink 
versus your headline.
6.	 From the Segment drop-down menu, choose This Extension vs. Other to see how an 
individual sitelink performs against another sitelink extension you are using.
If you notice that some of your sitelinks have low CTRs, consider 
rephrasing the sitelink text with more appealing descriptions 
or calls-to-action. If a sitelink is getting plenty of clicks but no 
conversions, consider deleting it, as it could be distracting 
users from the desired conversion path.
How it works...
AdWords sitelink ad extensions expand your text ads with additional page links, providing your 
visitors with other navigation options. AdWords reports on the performance of each extension 
you create so you can analyze the effectiveness of each sitelink.

Using impression share metrics to

Getting ready
You'll need to customize columns to see competitive metrics, currently available in campaign 
and ad group tabs.
Once you customize your data columns to include competitive metrics, your campaign and ad 
group tabs will include extra impression share (IS) columns for the metrics you have chosen.
How to do it...
Search Lost IS (budget) and Display Lost IS (budget):
The Search Lost IS (budget) and Display Lost IS (budget) columns help you identify if you 
need to increase your campaign budgets. If the number is greater than 0 percent, this means 
that your ads did not show on the Search or on the Display network because your budget was 
low. For example, if your Search Lost IS (budget) is 50 percent, your ads were eligible but did 
not show to 50 percent of the user searches because of your budget.
f
f
Sort your campaigns by Search Lost IS (budget) or Display Lost IS (budget)  
columns to see which campaigns are losing the greatest share of impressions.

f
Next, review your Cost/Conv. data for all campaigns that have high percentages of 
lost impressions due to budget. If a campaign is within your target Cost/Conv. but is 
losing impression share, consider increasing budget. 
f
f
Segment data by hour of the day to analyze how your coverage varies throughout the 
day or by device to analyze coverage for computers, tablets, and mobile devices.
Search Lost IS (rank) and Display Lost IS (rank):
f
f
The Search Lost IS (rank) and Display Lost IS (rank) columns help you identify 
impressions you're missing out on due to low ad rank. For example, if your Display 
Lost IS (rank) number is high, such as 62%, this means that your ad was eligible  
but did not show on Google's Display network 62% of the time due to low ad rank.
f
f
The actions you can take to improve lost impression share due to ad rank include 
raising your bids and improving your Quality Score. However, if your Cost/Conv. is 
outside your target CPA, raising your bids is not recommended. In that case, focus  
on improving Quality Score by refining structure, keywords, and ads.

Search Exact match IS:
Search Exact match IS helps you understand your impression share for just the keywords you 
have chosen. If you are using broad match keywords, your ads could be showing on variations 
of the keywords you have entered.
Sort campaigns or ad groups by Search Exact match IS and focus efforts where the number 
is low. A high number means you're getting high quality clicks on keywords you obviously found 
relevant enough to add to your campaigns.
If the number is low, run a search query report to analyze what queries are triggering clicks. 
Add the relevant queries as keywords and add negative terms to weed out irrelevant clicks.
How it works…
Impression Share (IS) is the number of impressions you received divided by impressions you 
were eligible to receive in your AdWords campaigns and ad groups. IS helps you analyze your 
share of voice with your current settings (such as your location targeting) and Quality Score.
Available IS metrics include:
Search Impression share: The percentage of time your ads were shown out of the times that 
your ads were eligible to show on the Search network.
Search Exact Match IS: The percentage of time your ads were shown for queries that exactly 
matched your keywords divided by exact match impressions you were eligible for.
Search Lost IS (rank): Search impressions you are missing out on due to low ad rank.
Search Lost IS (budget): How often your campaign's ads did not show on Google's Search 
network because of a limited budget.
f
f
Display Impression share: The percentage of time your ads were shown out of the 
times that your ads were eligible to show on the Display network. 
f
f
Display Lost IS (rank): Display impressions you are missing out on due to low  
ad rank.

Introduction
The most successful advertisers continuously refine and optimize their campaigns to keep 
them profitable. Your initial keywords and ads will need to be regularly updated, paused, and 
refined to stay on top of the latest trends in your market. Also, you'll need to adjust bids and 
other settings to keep on target with your goals such as a specific ad position or CPA.

Improving relevance and Quality Score
AdWords rewards advertisers who choose relevant keywords and write compelling ads with good 
Quality Scores. The better your Quality Scores, the less you'll need to pay for each click, resulting 
in more profits for you. This ecosystem evolved to benefit users, Google, and advertisers. If the 
ads on Google were irrelevant and of poor quality, users would get frustrated and not click on 
them, and Google would lose revenue. From an advertiser's perspective, when users click on 
irrelevant ads, they tend to leave your website, costing you money and not contributing to your 
bottom line. AdWords was designed to encourage high-quality ads, and as an advertiser you'll 
reap many benefits from optimizing them to improve relevance.
Getting ready
First, check your Quality Scores to identify low quality keywords to focus on. 
1.	 Go to the Campaigns tab.
2.	 Click on the Keywords tab.
3.	 Go to Columns and choose Customize columns.
4.	 From the Attributes section, choose Qual. score.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 11
247
5.	 Click on Apply and you will see an extra column with your Quality Scores.
6.	 In your Keywords tab, sort the Qual. score column to review low Quality Score  
keywords. Generally, Quality Score 1 to 3 is considered low, 4 to 6 is average  
with room for improvement, 7 to 9 is good, and 10 is considered great. 
7.	
Another way you can identify low-quality keywords is with filters. Create a keyword 
filter to see all keywords that are below a certain Quality Score. Download this report  
to have an easy to refer to summary of all keywords you'll need to focus on.
How to do it...
To improve your Quality Scores, follow these 10 tips:
1.	 Start with low Quality Score keywords that get the most impressions. This is where 
you'll have the biggest impact.
2.	 Re-organize your keywords into more tightly themed ad groups. If a keyword has a  
low Quality Score, try moving it to its own ad group with more specific ad text and  
its own negative keywords.
3.	 Your broad match keywords may be getting expanded to irrelevant variations.  
Try changing them to a more specific match type. 
4.	 Add negative keywords to eliminate irrelevant impressions and increase your CTR.  
For example, add free as a negative keyword to eliminate someone looking for  
free products and services online. Run a search terms report to see what queries  
are triggering clicks and get new negative keyword ideas.

5.	 Some of your low quality keywords may not be relevant to your website. If a keyword 
has a very low Quality Score and rarely shows, it could be negatively impacting the 
rest of your account. Consider deleting it.
6.	 Write new ads for your low Quality Score keywords, placing each keyword in your  
ad text, ideally in your headline.
7.	
Test multiple ad versions to see which one resonates better with your customers. 
Experiment with different calls-to-action, promotions, and ways to describe the  
unique benefits of your products and services.
8.	 Pause the lower performing ads in each ad group, if you are testing multiple 
variations to ensure that ads getting a better CTR show more often.
9.	 Try implementing dynamic keyword insertion to have AdWords automatically insert 
your keywords into the ad titles or description lines.
10.	 Choose more specific landing pages. Your landing page should be relevant to your 
keywords and contain your keywords on the page. If it does not, consider creating 
new landing pages for your most important keywords.
How it works...
Quality Score is a measure of relevance and is calculated by taking into account the  
following factors:
f
f
Your keyword's CTR: Your CTR is like an online voting system; people in the search 
auction vote on how relevant your ads are with their clicks.
f
f
Your display URL's CTR: Your display URL's past CTR affects your Quality Scores.
f
f
How relevant your keywords are: Some keywords you choose will be more relevant to 
your business than others. If you sell snowboards, but would like to run on a keyword 
like "snow," a generic term that's not as relevant to your business, you will receive a 
much lower Quality Score. Pick specific keywords that clearly describe your products 
and stay away from general keywords that could apply to many different businesses.
f
f
The relevance of your ads to your keywords: Your ads need to include your keywords 
in the ad text. If you have too many keywords for them all to be reflected in your ad 
copy, create additional, smaller ad groups. When a searched keywords is included 
in an ad text, that term is highlighted by Google in your ad, helping it stand out even 
more on the Google search results page.
f
f
Landing page quality: The keywords you choose should be included in your ad text 
and further mirrored on your landing page. In addition to your landing page being 
relevant to your keywords, it also needs to be transparent and easy to navigate.

Chapter 11
249
f
f
Historical account performance: Advertisers who continue to choose poor quality 
keywords will receive low Quality Scores when adding new keywords. This system 
helps Google discourage advertisers who continue to choose irrelevant keywords  
and encourage advertisers who create relevant, quality keywords and ads.
f
f
Performance in the regions you are targeting: The regions you target via your 
campaign settings page will affect your Quality Scores. 
f
f
Performance on the devices you are targeting: You may get different Quality Scores 
on mobile and tablet devices, if your keywords perform differently depending on device.
Quality Score is dynamic and is calculated every time a search triggers your ad. In order  
to achieve better Quality Scores, you'll need to focus on tying together all of the various 
elements that comprise Quality Score. Increasing relevance helps you achieve a better  
ad rank and pay less for each click. The Quality Score algorithm is designed to reward 
relevancy and encourage advertisers to create high-quality accounts, which will in turn  
help you achieve better ROI with AdWords.
There's more…
The more general your keywords are, the more difficult it will be to obtain a high Quality Score 
for them, even after following all of the recommended AdWords best practices. In such cases, 
you'll need to weigh if the lower Quality Score is worth the traffic and conversions you get from 
these keywords. Keep in mind that if you continue to choose low-quality keywords, this will 
hurt your overall account performance.

and long-term strategies that will help you obtain the best possible ad rank.

How to do it...
To improve your ad rank, you can:
1.	 Increase your bid
2.	 Improve your Quality Score
Increasing your bids is the easy fix short-term solution. However, continuing to increase  
how much you spend on each click when your ad rank slips is not going to be profitable  
in the long run.
The long-term strategy to improving ad position is to raise your Quality Scores. To improve 
Quality Score, start with the following:
1.	 Refine your campaign structure, breaking out related keywords into their own  
ad groups, which will help you write more relevant ads.
2.	 Refine ads with more compelling ad copy, using keywords in ad text.
3.	 Pause lower CTR ads if you are running multiple ad variations.
4.	 Add negative keywords to weed out impressions that are not relevant and are 
weighing down your CTR.
How it works...
Your ad rank determines your ad position, or where your ads show in relation to other 
advertisers. The ad rank formula consists of your Quality Score and your bid:
Ad Rank = Quality Score x Max CPC
www.it-ebooks.info

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com

Ad rank is calculated each time your ad enters the ad auction. This means that for each  
new query your ads could appear in a different position.
There's more…
The higher your Quality Score, the less you'll need to bid to maintain your ad rank.  
This strategy helps AdWords ensure high quality ads on Google.com and encourages 
advertisers to optimize their accounts.

Changing keyword match types
Keyword match types control who sees your ads and how the keywords you have chosen  
are expanded to match other relevant queries. Using too many of your keywords in the  
most restrictive match types can limit your traffic, while using too many broad keywords  
can generate some or a lot of irrelevant clicks.
Getting ready
Determine which keywords you might want to change match types for. Here are a couple  
of common edits advertisers make:
f
f
Broad match keywords with low Quality Scores and no conversions.  
Change to phrase or exact match to restrict variations.
f
f
Exact match keywords with no impressions. Change to more general  
match type to broaden reach.
How to do it...
To change a single keyword's match type:
1.	 Go to the Campaigns tab.
2.	 Click on the Keywords tab or click on a specific campaign and ad group first.

3.	 In your keyword table, click on the keyword you'd like to edit. Before you can proceed, 
you might need to agree to the system warning by clicking on Yes, I understand. The 
system warns you that if you edit a keyword, it will be deleted and treated as a new 
keyword in AdWords. You can check the Don't show this message again checkbox  
so you don't have to see this warning each time you edit a keyword.
4.	 Next, you'll be able to choose a different match type from the drop-down menu.  
In this screenshot, we are choosing to change a broad keyword to a more specific 
match type.
5.	 Click on Save.
To change match types for multiple keywords:
1.	 From your Keywords tab, check all of the keywords you'd like to edit.
2.	 From the Edit drop-down menu, choose Change match type.
3.	 Choose what you'd like to change your match type from and to.
4.	 Since changing a match type deletes the old keyword and creates a new one, you 
have the option to create duplicate versions of the keywords you have selected and 
add them in the new match types. To use that option, check Duplicate keywords  
and change match type in duplicates.
5.	 You can preview your changes before they go live by clicking on Preview changes.

Scheduling ads to run during key days and 
times
Many advertisers choose to run AdWords campaigns only during hours when they have 
customer support available. If you have a limited budget, you might want to focus your ad 
budgets on days and times your customers are most likely to be looking for you.
Getting ready
Determine if ad scheduling is necessary and appropriate for your business. Advertisers that may 
benefit from this include businesses that operate primarily during specific hours. For example, 
a website with customer support available to take calls during business hours only, or a pizza 
delivery service that only delivers evenings.
Review performance by day and hour of day, keeping in mind that you will see fewer clicks and 
impressions during less busy times, so you have focus on conversion rates and CPA instead. 
Some advertisers get great conversion rates during off peak hours, late at night and in the 
early mornings, when fewer advertisers are competing in the ad auction.
Keep in mind how your customers interact with you. If you rely on calls and only have 
customer support during specific hours, make sure your ads are focused on when you  
have the proper support available.
How to do it...
To enable ad scheduling:
1.	 Go to the Campaigns tab.
2.	 Click on the specific campaign you'd like to edit.
3.	 Go to the Settings tab.
4.	 Select Ad schedule.

Ad scheduling helps you control when your ads appear to potential customers. Ad scheduling 
is set at the campaign level, which means that it applies to all keywords and ads within a 
single campaign. By default, AdWords campaigns are set to run all days of the week and  
all hours of the day.
There's more…
When you set up ad scheduling, keep in mind your account's time zone. You can find out your 
time zone by going to My Account | Preferences. AdWords will also reference your time zone 
as you create a custom schedule for each campaign. You cannot change your time zone.

Expanding your keyword list
Expanding your keywords will be one of your main strategies to increase clicks as well as 
conversions. Just as markets evolve and search patterns change, your keywords also need  
to be updated in order not to become stagnant. Here we will discuss several tools you can  
use to build up and refresh your keyword list.
Getting ready
Review your website and compare your list of products and services to your AdWords account. 
Are your current keywords covering all of the categories you specialize in? Are there other 
ways to describe some of your key offerings? Who are your main competitors and are they 
doing PPC?
How to do it...
To expand your keyword list, try one of the following strategies.
Automated keyword suggestions
To see automated keyword ideas relevant to your website, follow these steps:
1.	 Click on the Campaigns tab.
2.	 Go into a specific campaign and ad group.
3.	 Clock on + Add keywords above your ad group's current keyword summary.
4.	 AdWords will suggest new sample keywords based on a scan of your website  
grouped into related categories.

5.	 Click to expand each category and review the suggested keywords. If you like a 
keyword, click on Add to move it to the Add keywords box. Do not simply add all  
of the automated suggestions, as not all of them will be specific enough. You as  
a business owner know your audience best and should pick and choose only the 
keywords that are the most relevant. Make sure that you are not adding keywords 
that may be already present in your other campaigns or ad groups.
6.	 Click on Save after adding all of the relevant keywords.
Search terms report
Review your search terms report regularly and add any relevant keywords that resulted in 
clicks and conversions. Click on Add as keyword recipe after viewing your search terms to  
add them to your account.

Competitor keywords
Use websites such as spyfu.com to see what keywords your competitors' ads are appearing  
on and to download their keyword lists. Enter a competitor's URL into the search box to 
uncover profitable keywords you missed.
You can download a competitor's full keyword list, sort, and filter it, or export it to an  
AdWords-friendly format. The tool can even organize a domain's keywords into targeted  
ad groups so you have less manual work to do.

Google's keyword tool
In addition to entering your own domain into Google's keyword tool, try typing in a competitor's 
website and see what keywords are being recommended.
How it works...
Adding new relevant keywords to your AdWords account will help drive more impressions 
and clicks. With new and unique keywords, you can capitalize on previously untapped 
opportunities to drive new leads and sales.

Analyzing ad copy performance and picking 
top performers
A big advantage of AdWords over traditional media is that you can easily set up and run 
multiple ad versions in just minutes. Even better, you'll get fast responses via real-time  
votes or clicks from your actual customers on what speaks to them so you can fine tune  
your message to reach even more qualified visitors.

Getting ready
In order to compare ads against one another, you'll need to set up multiple ads within an 
ad group. Create no more than 2 to 3 ads per ad group while you are testing. Let your ads 
accumulate some impressions and clicks before you make decisions about the effectiveness 
of each ad.
How long you'll need to wait before analyzing your tests will vary greatly based on how many 
impressions and clicks you receive, which will partly depend on your budgets. The general rule 
of thumb is to have at least 1000 impressions per ad copy before analyzing performance.
Set your campaign's ad rotation to rotate evenly to get an even split in impressions to each ad.
How to do it...
To analyze multiple ads within an ad group:
1.	 Go to the Campaigns tab.
2.	 Click on the campaign you're looking to analyze and choose an ad group.
3.	 Click on the Ads tab.
4.	 If the ads you are analyzing are low in impressions and clicks, allow for more time, 
until you have ~1000 impressions per ad version.
5.	 Review multiple metrics, rather than basing your decision on just one metric, such as 
only CTR or just conversion rates. The following table shows an example of two ads 
being tested within an ad group:
Ad 
Clicks
Impress-ions
CTR
Avg 
CPC
Cost

6.	 In the preceding example, Ad 1 is the winner. It has a higher CTR, lower average  
CPC, and even though it's converting at about the same rate as Ad 1 it costs less  
to convert a visitor through Ad 1.
7.	
In some instances, you'll see clear winners, such as ads that are clearly getting a 
better CTR and are converting at better rates. However, the ad with the best CTR  
will not always have a better conversion rate, and you'll need to review other metrics 
to determine your next steps.

8.	 If an ad is getting a high CTR but no conversions, it might not pre-qualify visitors 
enough and it might in fact be too appealing. Pausing it might lower your CTR,  
but if another ad is converting better and your goal is to have more conversions, 
pausing the high CTR ad without conversions might be a cost effective decision.
9.	 Once you determine a winner and a loser, pause the lower performing ad.
10.	 Some tests will have a major positive impact and others will fall flat. Continue  
to add new ad text variations to keep your message fresh and learn about what  
your customers will find compelling.
How it works...
Pausing low-performing ads helps you get more impressions and clicks on ads that work 
better. Even if you turn on Optimize for clicks or Optimize for conversions ad rotation 
settings, your low performers will continue to show occasionally. Figuring out which ads are 
meeting your goals and pausing the ones that don't ensures  
that the ads that work are shown to more users.

Adjusting budgets to maximize traffic and 
conversions
Most advertisers, except for large companies with unlimited funds, have specific budgets  
for AdWords that will need to be managed and redistributed among the different campaigns.  
This section discusses the key considerations and data to review as you decide where to  
focus your funds.
Getting ready
Keep in mind your overall ad budgets. Also, review your current performance and outline  
your goals. Are your conversion rates and cost per conversion acceptable and you'd like to  
get more such traffic? Or, are your current CPAs a bit outside your comfort zone and you  
need to improve on that?
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 11
263
How to do it...
1.	 First, determine which campaigns are limited by budgets. 
2.	 In your main Campaigns tabs, some campaigns may show a Limited by budget 
message, indicating that they could earn more impressions and clicks if you raised 
your daily budget. Sort your campaigns by the Status column to see which campaigns 
are limited by budget.
3.	 You can also review competitive metrics Search Lost IS (budget) and Display Lost IS 
(budget) to find out which campaigns are losing impression share due to low budgets. 
Customize your column views to see those metrics and sort the data to highlight 
campaigns where ads are not capturing all possible impressions. The higher the 
percent, the more impression share you are losing due to insufficient funds.
4.	 Next, analyze conversion rates and cost/conversion for each campaign that's limited 
by budget. 
5.	 If a campaign is within your target CPA and is losing impression share, move some 
funds over from a less profitable campaign.
6.	 If a campaign is outside your target CPA and it's limited by budget, it might not make 
sense to raise its budget, since this would further increase your overall CPA.
Here is an example of how you might want to redistribute a budget of $100/day based on 
performance with a CPA goal of $10:
Current 
budget
Limited by 
budget
CPA
Recommended budget action
Campaign #1
$30
Yes
$10
Increase budget 
Campaign #2
$30
No
$9
Leave budget as is
Campaign #3
$30
Yes
$15
Decrease budget, move funds 
to Campaign #1
How it works...
With AdWords, you have the flexibility to adjust budgets across your different campaigns at any 
time and as often as you would like. Performance varies and shifts all the time, which is why 
budgets should be monitored and adjusted regularly to maximize returns.

Change budget.
Then, choose to set your budgets to a specific amount, or increase or decrease budgets across 
selected campaigns by a specific percent. You can set an upper or lower budget limit to make 
sure your budget changes are not going above or below what you are comfortable with.

due to low ad rank. Focus on ad groups that are generating conversions within your 
CPA goal.
3.	 Change your campaign's ad delivery from Standard to Accelerated, so ads are 
displayed as soon as possible.
4.	 Expand your keywords with additional relevant terms. Create new ad groups for

5.	 Add new campaigns and ad groups for products and services you are not currently 
advertising. For example, if you sell car parts and are only advertising your Honda  
car parts through AdWords, add campaigns for additional brands you feature, such  
as Toyota or Mercedes.
6.	 Test the various targeting options available through Google's Display network. If you 
are already running display campaigns, consider adding some of the less frequently 
used campaign types. For example, you can target display ads through interest 
categories to reach users visiting pages about specific topics.
7.	
Consider expanding your locations to additional relevant geographic locations where 
your customers are located as well as targeting additional appropriate languages.

How it works...
Raising your bids and budgets helps you achieve a better ad rank and increases your ad 
delivery with your ads showing more throughout the day.
Adding new campaigns and keywords helps to increase your impressions and clicks through 
new terms that you were not previously bidding on.
Loosening some of your campaign settings, such as location and language targets, can help 
you reach additional customers not captured through your previous settings.

Running search term reports to optimize 
keywords
If you are using keywords in match types other than exact, your ads are showing on a number 
of other variations that you should be aware of. You can find out what these variations are 
through the search terms report and use it to add new relevant keywords or exclude the 
irrelevant queries.
How to do it...
To run a search terms report:
1.	 Go to the Campaigns tab.
2.	 Go down into a specific search campaign or ad group. You can also run a search 
terms report for keywords across all campaigns, but it might be overwhelming and 
difficult to focus. It is recommended that you start with specific campaigns instead.
3.	 Go to the Keywords tab.
4.	 This recently changed in AdWords. This sentence should read "Click on the Details

5.	 Next, you'll see a list of search terms that triggered your ads as well as CTRs and 
other performance data.
6.	 Column Added/Excluded tells you if a keyword is already a part of your keyword  
list (Added), if you previously excluded it (Excluded), or if it triggered your ads but  
you have yet to add or exclude it (None).
Once you know what search terms are triggering your ads, you have three options:
1.	 If a keyword has solid performance, such as a high CTR or has generated 
conversions, add it to your account. You can do so easily from within the  
AdWords interface by selecting the high performing keyword and clicking  
on the Add as keyword button above the report.
2.	 If a keyword is irrelevant to your business, has low CTR, or has not generated any 
conversions despite high costs, exclude it from your keyword list. Be careful not to  
use negatives that could prevent your relevant keywords from showing. Select the  
low performing keyword and click on the Add as negative keyword button. You will 
need to select whether the exclusion should apply to just the individual ad group or  
to an entire campaign.

3.	 You can choose to download your search terms into an Excel file or other convenient 
format as well as schedule it as an ongoing report that can be e-mailed to you.
How it works...
The search terms report shows you the exact queries that triggered your ads and led to the 
clicks. It is available for searches performed on Google.com and Google's Search Partners.
Search terms reports are not real time; they have a one-day delay before you see the data. You 
will only see impression data if a search term generated at least one click in the last 30 days.
There's more…
If you'd like to eliminate clutter in your search terms report and only focus on keywords that 
you have not added or excluded already, you can create a filter after viewing your keyword 
details. Saving this filter will allow you to access it again the next time you log in.

Optimizing bids for ROI
ROI focused bid optimization is the key to keeping your conversion rates high and CPA as low 
as possible. Many advertisers get distracted by ad position and keep increasing their bids to 
stay above their competitors. That's not always the optimal strategy, when it comes to ROI. 
This recipe focuses on identifying which keywords to adjust bids for and how to adjust them 
based on conversions.
Getting ready
In order to optimize for ROI, you will need to implement conversion tracking and your keywords 
will need to have accumulated some data that you can work with.
Also, keep in mind your overall CPA goal. That goal will help you identify ad groups and 
keywords outside and within a profitable range.
www.it-ebooks.info

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Optimizing Performance
272
How to do it...
You can optimize bids at the ad group level as well as at the keyword level. The rule of thumb 
is as follows:
f
f
Increase bids on ad groups and keywords that are converting within your target CPA, 
so you can get a better ad rank and more clicks.
f
f
Decrease bids on ad groups and keywords that are converting outside of your target 
CPA. This can help you lower your CPA on terms that are currently not cost effective.
For the purposes of this exercise, we'll focus on keyword bid strategy, but the same general 
guidelines apply to ad groups as well. The following table outlines the recommended bid 
adjustments for various performance scenarios with a CPA goal of $10.
Keyword
CPA 
Recommended bid action
New car
$15.34
Decrease bid
Honda dealership
$12.67
Decrease bid
Honda civic
$9.35
Leave the bid as is

$5.36
Increase bid
Here are four ways you can interact with your AdWords data and use the various AdWords 
tools to prioritize bid optimization efforts:
f
f
Sort keywords by Cost/conv. (1-per-click) to see the most costly and highest CPA 
terms first. Decrease bids on the worst offenders. You can start with a 20 percent 
decrease, but if the CPA is way outside of your target, you might want to decrease 
bids even more.
f
f
Create a filter that isolates all cost effective keywords. Increase bids if the CPA is  
well within your target.

f
f
Create a filter to isolate all costly keywords with no conversions to see where you are 
spending money without any results. Decrease bids on these terms or pause them.
f
f
Monitor and adjust bids on a regular basis to ensure CPAs stay within your targets. 
You can even set up automated rules to increase and decrease bids regularly (such 
as each week or every day) based on performance.
How it works...
Increasing and decreasing your bids based on prior conversion data will help you bid more  
on keywords that are working for you, and less on keywords that do not convert.
There's more…
To automate the process of adjusting bids, you can test CPA bidding in AdWords to let the 
system adjust bids for you based on a specific CPA goal. Make sure to watch results closely 
after you implement conversion optimizer, as it does not work for all advertisers. If CPA 
bidding does not produce the desired results, you can also try enhanced bidding.

Optimizing keywords to improve ROI
You've set up your campaigns and added lots of keywords, and people have started clicking on 
your ads. Now the ongoing work of fine tuning begins. A key aspect of optimization is making 
sure that the keywords that work for you get the most possible exposure while the keywords 
that do not are properly identified.
Getting ready
First, understand your low and high performers. Customize your keyword columns to include 
conversion metrics.
Use filters and sorting to identify keywords that fall within and outside your CPA goals. Download 
keyword data into an Excel file, or another easier to work with format.
How to do it...
First, focus on your top performers:
1.	 Create separate campaigns for your best keywords to set a unique budget for top 
performers. This will help you ensure that your other, less profitable, keywords are  
not taking impressions away from your highest ROI terms.
2.	 Increase bids on keywords that are profitable but are not appearing in the top 
position. This will help you get a better ad rank and more clicks from keywords  
that you know do well.
Next, make changes to keywords that are underperforming:
1.	 Lower bids for keywords that are converting at high costs or on keywords  
that have accumulated lots of clicks without any conversions.
2.	 Add negative keywords to improve CTR and quality of your low  
performing keywords.
3.	 Restructure by moving poor performers into their own ad groups  
with custom ads.

4.	 Try using different, more specific landing pages that better match your keywords.
5.	 Change the keyword match type to a more specific keyword matching option.  
This can help you reduce impressions and improve CTR.
6.	 If a keyword continues to under-perform, pause it. Click on the green status button  
to the left of the keyword you wish to pause and change the status from Enabled  
to Paused.
How it works...
Optimizing keywords based on your historical conversion data helps you improve performance 
and maximize ROI, since you can assume similar patterns from future searches. Optimizing 
keywords for ROI involves maximizing ad visibility and ad rank on keywords that work and 
refining keywords that have not performed well in the past.

Excluding IP addresses from seeing  
your ads
Are you worried that competitors are clicking on your ads? The good news is that AdWords 
offers a comprehensive click-fraud system that will in most cases filter out those clicks from 
your bill. However, you can also exclude competitors and other suspicious IPs from seeing your 
ads to further protect yourself.
Getting ready
AdWords does not provide IP address data for impressions and clicks you receive. However, 
you can get this information from your web logs.
How to do it...
To exclude specific IP addresses:
1.	 Go to the Campaigns tab.
2.	 Go to the Settings tab of a specific campaign you'd like to add IP exclusions to.
3.	 Scroll down to the Advanced Settings until you see + IP exclusions and click to 
expand this section.
4.	 Click on the Edit link.
5.	 Enter one IP address you'd like excluded per line.

their users.

Optimizing your landing pages
Your landing pages are a key part of the sales process and need to convince the visitors who 
clicked on your ads not only to stay, but to continue browsing your website and buy what you 
are selling. A typical visitor stays on a website only a few seconds before deciding to bounce, 
and it is the job of your landing page to keep potential customers from leaving. Even if you 
have chosen the best keywords and ads, your online campaigns will not be a success without 
an effective landing page.
Getting ready
Analyze your bounce rates and time on site through Google Analytics. Figure out if specific 
campaigns and ad groups have higher bounce rates than others and zero in on the landing 
pages you are using.
How to do it…
First, make sure that you are taking visitors to the most appropriate pages on your website. 
Perhaps you are taking your visitors to a page that's too general or too specific, and there is a 
section that is a better match for your keywords.
Next, consider some of the landing page optimization best practices to help improve 
engagement and conversions:
f
f
Customize your landing page's headline to your keywords. This will help reassure  
the users that they have arrived at the right place and will help boost your AdWords 
Quality Scores.
f
f
Keep important information above the fold, including your heading and any other 
important elements.
f
f
Make your conversion activity prominent and easy to spot. If you are capturing  
leads, your lead form should not be below the fold where many visitors might not 
even look. If you sell products, the product "Buy" button should be big and enticing.
f
f
Keep your forms short and only require users to fill out the most essential 
information. Each additional form field you add reduces the chances that the form 
will actually be completed.
f
f
Include customer testimonials on your landing page to build trust and showcase  
what others love about your business.
f
f
Include affiliations, guarantees, awards, privacy, security statements, and other 
reassurances that help build trust and reassure your customers of your credibility.

f
f
Focus on a single call-to-action. Your landing page should have a single purpose.  
Do not distract visitors with too many options, such as a newsletter sign-up, 
whitepaper download, and a demo request all at once.
f
f
Experiment with "Submit" button text, trying more enticing and non-intimidating 
language. For example, avoid the commitment-heavy "Subscribe Now" and try the  
less committal "Unlimited Access" instead.
f
f
Show your products and services being used in context.
f
f
Reduce unnecessary language and navigation, keeping the steps to complete a 
conversion short. Write succinct and to the point copy using easy-to-read bullets.
Keep testing and reiterating until you find what works best for you. There is no one size fits all 
approach when it comes to landing pages.
How it works...
Landing pages are a part of Google's Quality Score formula, affecting your overall ad 
performance. Your landing pages need to reflect your keywords but also be transparent  
and easy to navigate.
There's more…
To test different versions of your website and the impact of changing various landing  
page elements, set up Google Analytics Content Experiments. Content Experiments  
help you figure out which landing page elements work better for your predefined goals,  
such as signups or purchases. You can read more and find out how to get started at

Common AdWords mistakes
Introduction
AdWords offers a variety of advanced features many advertisers overlook, such as ad 
extensions that show your business phone number or links to other relevant pages on your 
website. You can also explore other ad formats such as product listings ads and video ads 
to get more traffic and engage with your customers through different channels. Not all of the 
advanced features and strategies will be applicable to your business, but hopefully a few can 
help your ads stand out in a saturated marketplace and give your campaigns the edge over 
your competition.

Creating sitelinks
An AdWords ad can only have one destination URL where visitors are taken after clicking on 
your ad. But, in many cases, there are actually multiple pages on your website that could 
potentially be applicable and relevant to a list of keywords. AdWords sitelinks help solve for 
that by allowing you to show alternate URL options in addition to your ad's main destination 
URL. However, they can also distract visitors from your target conversion activity, so be careful  
when adding sitelinks and monitor results after implementing them.
Getting ready
Brainstorm the additional page URLs you'd like to highlight in your ads. Here are some ideas 
for pages on your website you can promote via sitelinks:

How to do it...
To set up sitelinks, follow these steps:
1.	 Click on the Campaigns tab.
2.	 Go into a campaign you wish to edit. Set up sitelinks at the campaign level or go into 
a specific ad group if you wish to create sitelinks unique to an ad group.
3.	 Go to the Ad extensions tab.

7.	
Write in the link text (25 character limit) and enter a link URL. Make your sitelinks 
compelling and interesting. For example, if you plan to use your testimonials page as 
a sitelink, say something like See Why Customers Love Us.
8.	 Click on Save.
9.	 Create additional sitelinks for other URLs you wish to promote. Add as many sitelinks 
as possible to increase your chances of sitelinks appearing.
10.	 Click on Save after creating multiple sitelinks.
How it works...
Sitelinks allow you to show links to other pages on your website in addition to your main ad 
destination URL. They only appear if your ad is ranked at the top or at the bottom of Google's 
search results.
Sitelink text needs to be 25 characters or less. You can create sitelinks at the campaign level, 
but can also set unique sitelinks for each ad group. You can add up to 10 sitelinks but not all 
of them will show.

only on mobile devices.
You can also enable ad scheduling to show sitelinks during certain days and times only. For 
example, you can choose specific dates on which an ad extension can show up with your ad 
(for example, only for special holiday promotions).

Setting up call extensions
If you are in a business that values calls more than website visits, you should be taking 
advantage of call extensions in AdWords. When you set up call extensions, your ad text 
is extended with an extra line of text for your phone number on computers and tablets. 
Additionally, when you set up "click-to-call", people searching for you on their mobile devices 
have the option to call you instead of clicking through to your website, saving customers the 
extra step of having to go to your website to look up your phone number.
Getting ready
Decide if you'd like to show your own business phone number or use Google's call forwarding. 
If you use Google's call forwarding, Google will assign a toll-free number that will dial through 
to your phone number. The advantage of using Google's free call forwarding is the ability to 
see data about calls that are dialed through this call extension (such as call area code and 
duration) and the option to track calls as conversions.
How to do it...
To set up call extensions, follow these steps:
1.	 Click on the Campaigns tab.
2.	 Go into a specific campaign. You can set-up call extensions at the campaign level and 
at the ad group level. To set them up at the ad group level, go into a specific ad group.
3.	 Go to the Ad extensions tab.
4.	 From the View drop-down, select Call Extensions.

6.	 Click on + New phone number:
7.	
Choose your country and enter the phone number.
8.	 Next, decide if you'd like to use Google's call forwarding or show your own  
phone number.
9.	 Under Show the following links, pick if you would like to show both a link to your 
website and your phone number, or just the phone number. The default is to show 
both options, since that gives your customers more flexibility to choose what they 
prefer. With the second option, only the phone number will be clickable when your 
ad is shown on mobile devices capable of making phone calls. This option is most 
appropriate for businesses that need to talk to their customers first, such as a salon 
that makes all appointments over the phone.

10.	 Under Report phone call conversions, you can choose to count any calls that last 
longer than a certain amount of time as conversions. Keep this option checked and 
adjust your desired call duration (default is 60 seconds). This option is only available 
for call extensions using Google's call forwarding.
11.	 Expand +Start/end dates, scheduling to choose when your call extensions can run. 
Set a specific schedule when your phone number will show if you only have customer 
support during set hours.
12.	Click on Save to keep your call extension settings and then click on Save again to add 
this call extension to your campaign.
How it works...
Call extensions extend your text ads with an extra line of text that shows a phone number on 
all devices. You can create call extensions at the campaign and ad group levels.
Advertisers can choose to show their business number in ads or use Google's free call 
forwarding, which provides additional reporting to help you evaluate calls that are coming 
through AdWords.

Promoting application downloads
Application promotion ads extend your AdWords ads with a link to your application to drive 
downloads. Customers can choose to click on the application link instead of on your ad text 
headline to learn more about the application and download it.
Getting ready
You'll need to have an iOS or an Android app live on iTunes or on the Google Play store. You 
may also need your App ID (for iOS apps) or Package name (for Android apps), though you can 
also look up this information as you're setting up the ad.
How to do it...
To set up app extensions:
1.	 Go to the Campaigns tab and click on a specific campaign and ad group where you'd 
like to create an app ad.

The ads you create will only show on devices that the app can be downloaded from. For 
example, if a user is searching on an iPhone, only the ad you created for the iOS platform with 
a link to your iTunes app download will show. If a user is searching on an Android device, only 
the ad with an option to download your app from Google Play will show up.

Setting up Dynamic Search Ads
If you sell a large number of products and would like to automate the process of creating and 
managing AdWords ads, you could benefit from a new campaign type called Dynamic Search 
Ads. You do not need to pick keywords or write unique ads with custom landing pages for your 
various products, and you don't need to pause products that are out of stock. AdWords does 
this work automatically for you, matching up the appropriate keywords to the most relevant 
landing pages based on your website's content.
Getting ready
Determine if Dynamic Search Ads are appropriate for you. This campaign type works best for 
businesses that offer a large number of products or services that change frequently based 
on inventory or seasonality. Dynamic Search Ads do not work as well for smaller websites with 
fewer landing pages.
How to do it...
To set up Dynamic Search Ads, follow these steps:
1.	 Go to the Campaigns tab.
2.	 Click on + New campaign to create a new campaign and choose Search  
Network only.
3.	 Choose Dynamic Search Ads from the list of available campaign types:

your website content to target ads.

Click on Save and continue.
8.	 Now, create an ad group. You'll need to customize your description lines and your 
display URL. Your headlines will be dynamically generated for you.
9.	 Under Auto targets, keep All pages checked to allow AdWords to include all pages 
from your website domain:
10.	 Adjust your Default bid, if necessary, and click on Save ad group.
11.	 You can add multiple ads to dynamic ad groups to test how different description  
lines perform.
12.	Create additional ad groups if you'd like to target specific groups of pages and further 
customize bids and ads for specific products. Go to the Auto targets tab and click on 
+ Add dynamic ad target. Choose from the following available options:


CATEGORY: AdWords may automatically pre-populate categories based on 
your website's content, after you choose this target. This can help you bid  
up or down based on the importance of a category.


URL: Enter specific pages or a string of words and underscores to denote  
a page.


PAGE_CONTENT: Define what pages should be included with words 
describing page content.
How it works...
Dynamic Search Ads automate AdWords campaign management by serving ads based on your 
website's content. Unlike standard search ads, where you have to pick keywords and write 
unique ads, with Dynamic Search Ads, Google determines which keywords are relevant and 
matches them up to the appropriate landing pages.
Additionally, Google creates a custom headline for each ad using content from the landing 
page being served. While the headline is generated dynamically, you still need to write ad 
description lines.
You can choose if you would like AdWords to create ads for all of the products on your website 
or just specific pages or categories.

There's more…
Continue to monitor search terms that are triggering your ads to ensure that the searches are 
relevant to your website. Go to the Dimensions tab of your Dynamic Search Ads campaign and 
review search terms data on an ongoing basis. If you find that some irrelevant searches are 
triggering your ads, or certain searches are generating a lot of traffic without any conversions, 
you can add them as negative keywords.

The Creating product ads recipe
Creating product ads
Product listing ads are a powerful ad format available through Google which allows retailers to 
showcase merchandise through images on Google.com. Because users can already see what 
the products look like and how much they cost, it's an extremely effective and profitable way 
to advertise with often better conversion rates than your standard text ads.
Getting ready
You'll need to have an account and a data feed submitted with Google's Merchant Center. The 
Merchant Center allows retailers to submit products, which show on Google Shopping, Product 
Listing Ads, and on Google Commerce. If you do not have a Merchant Center account, you can 
get started at www.google.com/merchants.
You'll need to create, upload, and regularly update a formatted feed with all of your products. 
There are feed management companies that specialize in creating and optimizing your feeds, 
including http://godatafeed.com/ and https://www.singlefeed.com.

11.	 Go back to your original ad and hover over it to change it to Control only:
12.	Now that you have your experiment set up, monitor the results to see how your 
experiment ad stacks up against your control. How long you'll need to let the 
experiment run to get statistically significant data will depend on how much traffic you 
get. The general rule of thumb is to allow for 2 to 4 weeks.
13.	Under your Ads tab, go to Segment and choose the Experiment option to 
see data for your control and experiment ads, as well as if the results are statistically 
significant. Make sure that you are looking at a date range specific to when you 
started the experiment, rather than at all time data, for example.
14.	 If you would like to stop the experiment or need more time to accumulate statistically 
significant data, adjust the experiment end date in your campaign settings page.

15.	If the experiment was successful and you would like to implement the changes, click 
on Apply: Launch changes fully. If the experiment underperformed and the control 
did better, choose Delete: Remove changes. Choosing to delete the changes will 
pause the experiment ad. If you apply the experiment changes, your control ad will  
be paused and your experiment ad will remain active.
How it works...
Experiments in AdWords allow you to test the impact of changes you are considering making 
to your AdWords account. With experiments, you can evaluate if the differences you are seeing 
are statistically significant, or unlikely to have occurred by chance. You can make experimental 
changes to ad groups, bids, keywords, and ads. You can also choose how many people will be 
exposed to your experimental changes with the option to start and stop your experiment at 
any time.

How it works...
Negative Broad match is the default negative option that will exclude any query that includes 
your negative broad terms. Word order does not matter but misspellings and variations are 
not included. For example, if you have a negative broad keyword "it jobs" your ads would 
not appear on a query like "jobs it" but traffic for another irrelevant query like "information 
technology jobs" would not be filtered out. Ideally, you would add "jobs" as a negative broad 
keyword to exclude any query containing that term.
Negative Phrase match allows you to exclude specific phrases from triggering your ads by 
including quotations around the phrase. The word order is preserved, meaning if someone 
searches for a negative keyword you are using in a different word order, your ads could still 
appear. For example, if you have a negative phrase "it jobs," your ads would not show on query 
"find it jobs," but could show on a query such as "jobs in it."
Negative Exact match allows you to exclude a specific phrase only by including brackets 
around a word or phrase. Any additional words, variations or queries in a different order would 
still potentially trigger your ads. For example, if you have [it jobs] as a negative exact, your ads 
could still show on searches like "find it jobs" or "it job."
The following table highlights how the different match types would help you filter traffic and 
what queries would and would not trigger your ads based on your negative match type:

There's more…
Review your list of negative keywords regularly to ensure you are using negative match types 
correctly and are not excluding any relevant traffic. Since misspellings, plurals, or other 
variations are not included with any of the negative match types, expand your negatives by 
including all related phrases.

Automating actions based on rules  
and goals
Automated rules in AdWords can save you time managing and optimizing your account by 
performing changes to your campaigns based on the criteria you specify. For example, you 
can adjust bids based on specific goals and latest performance or pause ads when a certain 
promotion is set to end.
Getting ready
Plan how to best take advantage of automation. Here are a few ways you can use  
automated rules:
f
f
Adjust bids based on ad position, conversions, and other factors. For example, you 
can increase bids on your top converting keywords.
f
f
Pause or activate campaigns, keywords, or ads that feature special promotions. For 
example, if you have a free shipping promotion running for a few days only, you can 
activate and schedule ads to be paused automatically on specific start and end dates.
f
f
Adjust campaign budgets based on performance. For example, you can schedule 
campaign budgets to automatically increase when a campaign is losing impression 
share due to budget.
f
f
Pause low performing ad groups or keywords. For example, you can pause poor 
Quality Score keywords that are not generating any conversions.

Common AdWords mistakes
In this section, we'll discuss some of the common mistakes advertisers make with AdWords. 
Google AdWords offers so many features and options that it's easy to overlook a few key 
components. Review the following list and compare them to your campaigns to ensure you are 
following AdWords best practices and not committing some of the common errors.
Getting ready
Review your campaigns and revisit of structure, keywords, budgets and bids. Prepare to take 
note of any issues and opportunities based on the following list.
How to do it...
Here are 10 common mistakes I see advertisers make with AdWords:
f
f
Not separating campaigns by network. Having separate campaigns for search and 
display allows you to control your budget more precisely and help you ensure that the 
network that's performing better gets more of your ad dollars.
f
f
Poor ad group structure. Most businesses starting out with AdWords create one 
campaign and one ad group with many only loosely related keywords. This practice 
results in low Quality Scores and costly clicks.
f
f
Picking the wrong keywords. Monitor conversion rates, bounce rates and time on site 
to ensure keywords you have chosen bring engaged visitors to your website. Keywords 
that are too general, such as one-word keywords, can use up a lot of your budget and 
lower your Quality Scores.
f
f
Forgetting about negative keywords. Negative keywords are a key tool you can use 
to achieve better Quality Scores, CTR and conversion rates. Failing to add negative 
keywords means you are paying for some unqualified clicks and losing money.
f
f
Using a generic ad that is not customized to the ad group and keyword themes. Some 
advertisers split up their keywords into multiple ad groups, but they often forget to 
take that next step and customize the ads. Ads that are specific to your keywords get 
better CTRs and help with your Quality Scores, reducing how much you need to pay 
for each click. 
f
f
Setting default bids not adjusted based on actual performance. Ad group and 
keyword bids should be modified regularly based on position, conversions and  
other key metrics.
f
f
Forgetting to implement ad extensions, such as sitelinks, social annotations or call 
extensions. Adding these extra elements help your ads stand apart by adding extra 
relevant lines to your ad text.
www.it-ebooks.info

Chapter 12
319
f
f
Not monitoring your competition. Use third-party tools to keep track of any changes 
to keywords and test any new terms your competition is trying out. Also keep track of 
changes to competitors' ad copy to make sure your ads are unique and appealing.
f
f
Making changes to your account without keeping your end goal in mind. For example, 
you might get distracted with the need to be in the #1 position for some of your 
keywords, when those keywords might not be profitable for you. Keep your business 
goals first and foremost as you make changes.
f
f
Set and forget it mentality. Not every campaign and strategy you try in AdWords 
will actually work for you. After launching any new keywords, ads or other features, 
monitor performance to ensure you're getting the traffic that you want. Schedule 
reports to be emailed to you on a regular basis to help you stay on track.
How it works...
Not following best practices and monitoring your campaigns can hurt your AdWords 
performance. Go through the list of common errors periodically, to make sure you are not 
committing some of the typical mistakes advertisers make.

Troubleshooting why your ads are not 
showing up
There are a variety of reasons why your ads might not be showing on Google, with the most 
common issue being a limited budget. To help you take the guesswork out of this process, 
AdWords provides the Ad Preview and Diagnosis tool.
Getting ready
Take note of keywords that you are concerned about, as well as locations and devices you are 
searching from.
How to do it...
To diagnose why your ads are not showing up on Google, follow these steps:
1.	 Click on Tools and Analysis and choose the Ad Preview and Diagnosis Tool.
2.	 Choose your domain, language, location, and device.
3.	 Enter your keyword into the search box and click on Preview.
4.	 Once you click on Preview, your diagnosis for the searched keyword will load and 
you'll see if your ads are showing under Showing ads right now?.
5.	 If your ads are not showing you'll receive an explanation detailing what is causing this 
(such as low ad rank or limited budget):
6.	 Clicking on the What can I do? link will take you to a help article with tips on how to 
resolve your issue.
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Chapter 13
323
At the bottom of the Ad Preview and Diagnosis tool, you'll see Google's search results for your 
query. If your ad is currently showing up, you can preview your ad through this tool, rather than 
searching on Google.com and accumulating impressions on your own keywords.
How it works...
Ad Preview and Diagnosis tool is available to all AdWords advertisers to help preview ads and 
troubleshoot performance issues. It diagnoses your budgets, bids, Quality Scores and other 
settings to provide a custom analysis of why your ads are not showing. It's also helpful when 
you'd like to see the ad position your ads are appearing on Google.com, or see ads that are 
appearing in multiple geographies.

The Finding out your ad's approval status recipe
Finding out your ad's approval status
Each ad submitted to AdWords goes through editorial review to ensure that your ads and 
website comply with Google's advertising policies. Depending on your approval status, your 
ads might not be showing to all users, so make sure you understand your ad's status. An 
automated AdWords check makes the ad "eligible" to show to users with safe search turned 
off. Once the ads have been approved, they can be shown to all users.
How to do it...
To check the status of your ads:
1.	 Click on the Campaigns tab.
2.	 Click on the Ads tab.
www.it-ebooks.info

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
Managing AdWords

3.	 Check the Status column for each ad to see an ad's current approval status:
4.	 If your ad is disapproved, you'll find out why your ad was rejected as you hover over 
the disapproved status speech bubble.
5.	 Create a filter if you wish to easily access any disapproved ads or ads that are under 
review. Go to your Ads tab and click on Create filter from the Filter drop-down menu. 
Choose Approval Status from the available filter options, and select the ad statuses 
you wish to monitor:

Chapter 13
325
How it works...
Your ad's status determines if your ad is eligible to run and who can see your ads. Ads that 
have not yet been reviewed may not be showing up. If an ad does not meet the editorial and 
product requirements, your ads are disapproved and you'll receive an e-mail. However, if your 
ad has been approved or is still pending, you will not receive an e-mail and you'll need to 
check your account to understand the status of your ads.
Possible approval statuses include:
f
f
Under review: Your ad is in queue to be reviewed and is not currently running.
f
f
Eligible: Your ad has still not been reviewed but it's eligible to show on Google.
f
f
Approved: Your ad passed the editorial review and is eligible to run.
f
f
Approved (limited): Your ad was approved but there are limitations on where or when 
it can show. This is a common approval status for groups of restricted products like 
alcohol or trademarks.
f
f
Approved (non-family): Your ads and website content have adult themes and will not 
appear to users who have activated safe search filters.
f
f
Approved (adult): Your ads have nudity and other non-family safe content and will 
only appear to select users searching for adult content. Your ads may not be eligible 
to show up in all countries.
f
f
Disapproved: Your ads violated advertising policies and are currently not running.
f
f
Site suspended: Your website does not comply with AdWords policies and none of 
your ads pointing to the suspended website are currently running.

Automated rules allow you to monitor performance trends and receive e-mail alerts when 
certain conditions are met. You can create multiple e-mail alerts and pause or edit your 
requirements at any time. To access and edit your rules, go to Bulk operations in your 
AdWords account and choose Automated rules.

Viewing or hiding paused or deleted items
The AdWords campaign management page can be customized so that you are only looking at 
data of interest to you. One of the more basic features is viewing or hiding paused or deleted 
items. For example, if you have a lot of campaigns you have been testing, you may choose 
to hide deleted or paused campaigns so that you can focus on just the campaigns you are 
currently running.
Getting ready
Before you can use this feature, you will need to have a few campaigns, keywords, or ads in 
your account. Some of them should be active while others can be paused or deleted.
How to do it..
To hide paused or deleted items, follow these steps:
1.	 Click on the Campaigns tab.
2.	 Navigate to your sub-tab of interest. For example, click on Campaigns.
3.	 Select All enabled to only see active campaigns and hide paused or

Copying campaigns or ad groups with 
AdWords Editor
Do you need to create mirror versions of your campaigns to target different locations? Or 
perhaps you want to copy entire ad groups and simply replace certain phrases to create new, 
unique ad groups? You can do all of that easily through AdWords Editor.
Getting ready
Decide which campaigns or ad groups you'll need to copy. Next, figure out what you'll need to 
adjust once you copy a campaign or an ad group.
For example, if you are copying a campaign, you'll likely want to adjust a copied campaign's 
target locations and budget.
How to do it...
To copy campaigns or ad groups in AdWords Editor:
1.	 Open up AdWords Editor.
2.	 Click on Get recent changes.
3.	 Click on the Campaigns tab. If you are planning to copy ad groups, click on the  
Ad groups tab.

4.	 Select the campaigns or ad groups you wish to copy. 
5.	 Go to Edit and click on Copy, and then Paste. You can also use keyboard shortcuts.
6.	 Next, you'll want to rename your copied campaigns or ad groups and make any other 
necessary adjustments. For example, if you copied an ad group, you might want to 
replace keyword phrases or text in the copied ad groups. Go to Edit and click on 
Replace text in selected items or use keyboard shortcuts:
7.	
When you are confident that the changes are ready to go live, click on Post changes.
How it works...
The copy and paste features in AdWords Editor help you expand your account in a scalable way. 
The various elements of campaigns or ad groups being copied are duplicated in the application 
and can be posted directly to your AdWords account. Keep an eye on Quality Scores when  
copy-pasting a large amount of campaigns or ad groups.

Adding keywords in bulk using AdWords 
Editor
If you have dozens, hundreds, or thousands of keywords that you need to add to your account, 
AdWords Editor can be a great time saver. You can import your keywords from a spreadsheet 
into the application, or copy and paste keyword lists you are working on into select campaigns 
and ad groups.
Getting ready
Prepare your new keywords and figure out which campaigns and ad groups they should be 
added to. You have the following options:
f
f
Create an AdWords Editor-friendly CSV file  and import it to AdWords Editor. The 
easiest way to get started would be to export your current campaigns and then add 
any new keywords you wish to create to the exported spreadsheet. In AdWords Editor, 
go to File, choose Export spreadsheet (CSV) and select what you would like to 
export. Click on Save to keep a copy of your file and choose where on your computer 
you'd like to save it. Your new keywords should have campaign and ad group names 
filled in so Editor knows where those keywords should go. Make sure you include 
keyword match types as well as unique bids, if necessary.

The other option is to copy and paste keywords you're working on directly into select 
campaigns and ad groups. You do not need to create custom columns for your 
campaigns and ad groups, and you can choose keyword match types after you add 
your keywords to AdWords Editor.
How to do it...
To add keywords via AdWords Editor, follow these steps:
1.	 Open up AdWords Editor.
2.	 Click on Get recent changes.
3.	 If you have an AdWords Editor-ready CSV file to import, go to File, choose Import CSV, 
and choose if you would like to paste text or import an actual file. Move through the 
prompts to confirm and review your changes:
4.	 AdWords Editor will summarize the changes you are about to make for you, including 
how many keywords you'll be adding and any other edits.
5.	 The new additions will be highlighted in green and you'll be able to keep or reject  
the changes:

6.	 If you do not have a properly formatted CSV file, you can still add new keywords 
through a simple copy and paste. Click on the Keywords tab. You can either add a 
single keyword by clicking on + Add keyword, or you can add multiple keywords by 
choosing Make multiple changes:
7.	
Select the campaigns and ad groups your keywords should be added to. Type or paste 
your keywords into the keyword box. You can also set match types, maximum CPCs, 
and unique destination URLs, as well as a keyword's status. Once your keywords have 
been entered in, click on Process and then on Finish.

8.	 If you do not set specific match types, you can change them in the Keywords tab after 
you import the new terms:
9.	 Review the changes highlighted in green and accept or reject them.
10.	 Click on Post selected campaigns to make the changes live in AdWords.
How it works...
AdWords Editor allows you to import keyword lists from a spreadsheet to add or update 
multiple keywords across your campaigns. You can review the new keywords before they go 
live, set unique bids, destination URLs, choose match types and keyword statuses, and post 
the new keywords to your AdWords account.

Updating ads in bulk using AdWords Editor
Creating, editing, or pausing ads can be much more efficient through AdWords Editor, 
especially if you need to update many ads at once. For example, AdWords Editor allows you 
to update destination URLs across all of your campaigns and ad groups at once, without the 
need to click into individual campaigns and ad groups in your AdWords online interface.

Getting ready
Decide which campaigns and ad groups will need to be updated. If you would like to add new 
ads, prepare the new ad copy elements, and plan out where they should go.
You can add, edit, pause, or delete ads either manually or by importing a CSV spreadsheet. If 
you would like to use the spreadsheet option, download your current ads first. Go to File, choose 
Export spreadsheet (CSV), and choose which parts of your account you'd like to work on. Click 
on Save to keep a copy of your CSV file. Make sure to preserve all of the exported columns as 
you work on your ads, so that the revised file remains compatible with AdWords Editor.
How to do it...
To update ads in bulk through AdWords Editor, follow these steps:
1.	 Open up AdWords Editor.
2.	 Click on Get recent changes.
3.	 Click on the Ads tab. Then, click on + Add text ad to add a single ad to a specific 
campaign or ad group:

If you would like to update all ads containing specific URLs or phrases, use the search 
feature at the top-right corner of the tool above your Ads tab to filter out your desired 
parameters. Then, highlight the ads you want to update and make the necessary 
change, such as replacing text in the selected items:
8.	 If you have an AdWords Editor-friendly CSV spreadsheet, where you made all of 
your desired edits, go to File, choose Import CSV, select From file and find your 
spreadsheet on your computer. Follow through the prompts to import and review  
your edits or additions.

About Packt Publishing
Packt, pronounced 'packed', published its first book "Mastering phpMyAdmin for Effective MySQL 
Management" in April 2004 and subsequently continued to specialize in publishing highly focused 
books on specific technologies and solutions.  
Our books and publications share the experiences of your fellow IT professionals in adapting and 
customizing today's systems, applications, and frameworks. Our solution-based books give you the 
knowledge and power to customize the software and technologies you're using to get the job done. 
Packt books are more specific and less general than the IT books you have seen in the past. Our 
unique business model allows us to bring you more focused information, giving you more of what 
you need to know, and less of what you don't.
Packt is a modern, yet unique publishing company, which focuses on producing quality,  
cutting-edge books for communities of developers, administrators, and newbies alike.  
For more information, please visit our website: www.PacktPub.com.
About Packt Enterprise
In 2010, Packt launched two new brands, Packt Enterprise and Packt Open Source, in order  
to continue its focus on specialization. This book is part of the Packt Enterprise brand, home 
to books published on enterprise software – software created by major vendors, including (but 
not limited to) IBM, Microsoft and Oracle, often for use in other corporations. Its titles will offer 
information relevant to a range of users of this software, including administrators, developers, 
architects, and end users.
Writing for Packt
We welcome all inquiries from people who are interested in authoring. Book proposals should be 
sent to author@packtpub.com. If your book idea is still at an early stage and you would like to 
discuss it first before writing a formal book proposal, contact us; one of our commissioning editors 
will get in touch with you. 
We're not just looking for published authors; if you have strong technical skills but no writing 
experience, our experienced editors can help you develop a writing career, or simply get some 
additional reward for your expertise.
