Notes
EU Directive: This is a legal instrument that applies generally in the 
European Union (EU) nut requires individual implementing 
laws in each individual member state. The main EU data pro-
tection law was and EU Directive from 1995, the DPD95.
EU Regulation: This is a legal instrument that applies generally and 
directly in all EU member states without the need for any 
individual implementing measures in the EU member states.
Recitals: The Recitals to the GDPR are interpretative aids to a regu-
lation but do not form part of the formal legal rules. They are, 
however, instructive and help describe the background and 
context to the introduction of the GDPR, in particular the 
need or an updating of the data protection regime on foot of 
new issues, concerns, and challenges. Some of these themes 
are referred to below.
Articles: The Articles to the GDPR are the legal rules or legally 
binding parts of the regulation.
Personal data: Any data or information identifying or relating to the 
individual data subject. (In the United States, personal data is 
often referred to as personally identifiable information [PII]).
Data subject: The individual who the personal data relates to.
Controller: The organization collecting, processing, and holding the 
personal data.

x x
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
Processor: An outsourced third-party organization or related entity 
carrying out certain defined outsourced activities for and on 
behalf of the main data controller with the personal data for 
example outsourced payroll, outsourced direct marketing, and 
so on.
Supervisory authority: An official data protection supervisory 
authority of one of the respective EU member states, such 
as the Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) in Ireland or 
the Information Commissioner’ s Office (ICO) in the United 
Kingdom.
Data retention: Note that the data protection regime is separate to 
the issue of mandated retention of certain telecommunications 
data for access in relation to terror law investigations— which 
is known as data retention law. This book refers to data pro-
tection only and not data retention issues. See further details 
in Appendices.
PII: Personal data is often referred to as personally identifiable infor-
mation or PII in the United States.
TFEU: Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

Necessary to 
Consider EU Rules
Introduction
Commercial imperatives and what is expected by employees, 
customers, and users mean that data protection is a fast-growing 
global compliance issue. Organizations and businesses must respect 
personal data and data protection issues as regards their employees’ , 
customers’ , and users’  data. As part of this, organizations also need to 
be aware of new European rules in relation to personal data and data 
protection. EU rules that were already in existence dating from 1995 
have been replaced and enhanced. The 1995 data protection directive 
(DPD95) was replaced in 2016 with a new wider data protection reg-
ulation. The new regulation is formally referred to as the EU General 
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The GDPR is the single most 
important personal data and data protection set of rules to arrive in 
over 20  years. It strengthens the applicable rules as well as introduc-
ing many new ones. The GDPR is one of the most important devel-
opments for EU, US, and other organizations to be aware of. This 
is also important for those who professionally advise organizations. 
Understanding what is required in the new EU data protection rules 
is essential.
Under the EU data protection rules, an organization is referred to 
as a “ controller”  (i.e., the data controller). (An outsourced organiza-
tion carrying out certain defined activities for and directed by the 
main data controller organization is referred to as a “ processor”  [i.e., 
data processor for the controller organization]).

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
EU Data Protection Rules Are Important for US Businesses
Why are EU data protection rules important for US businesses? Some 
of the reasons include
•	 The EU accounts for approximately 20% of worldwide exports 
and imports.
•	 The EU is the largest (or second largest, depending on fig-
ures) worldwide importer.
•	 The EU is made up of 28 states (with standardized rules mak-
ing it streamlined and easier for business).
•	 Even after Brexit, EU or EU equivalent data protection legal 
standards will apply in the UK— including the new GDPR.
•	 The EU market is approximately 510  m people (third largest 
world population after China/India).
•	 EU data protection rules apply across all relevant organiza-
tions (regardless of size).
•	 EU data protection rules apply to controller organizations.
•	 EU data protection rules apply to processor organizations.
•	 EU data protection rules apply to and protect all relevant 
individuals.
•	 EU data protection rules require compliance from all US 
organizations based in the EU.
•	 EU data protection rules apply to US organizations exporting 
to EU consumers.
•	 EU data protection rules apply to proposed transfers or 
exports of personal data from the EU to the US.
•	 The EU data protection rules have been modernized and 
enhanced significantly in the new GDPR.
•	 There are new requirements in relation to the growing prob-
lem of data breach issues.
•	 There are new and enhanced compliance rules.
•	 There are mandated Data Protection Officers in organizations.
•	 There are new rights for individuals against businesses.
•	 Most striking perhaps is the new penalties and fines regime.
•	 Non-compliance or inadequate compliance can result in pen-
alties of up to € 20  m or 4% of global annual turnover .
•	 This is a lightning bolt for US, EU, and other organizations 
assessing and understanding the new EU data protection rules.

Necessary to Consider EU Rules
So, EU data protection rules can apply from the smallest to the 
largest US businesses when they seek to exploit the EU consumer 
marketplace.
Transatlantic business is significant, including Internet, eCom-
merce, aeronautics, technology, computing, finance, services, and so 
on. The Internet means that data protection is “ clearly a global matter.” *
Even where a US company is not dealing directly with EU con-
sumers, such as processors, outsource companies, and cloud storage 
entities such as third-party data processors that hold or deal with the 
EU consumer or employee data for the organization, it must note that 
EU data protection rules can also apply.
As indicated in the preceding list, the new fines rules are very sig-
nificant and present a risk for organizations in the EU, dealing with 
the EU, and/or receiving data from the EU.
Therefore, EU data protection rules can be directly relevant for 
many US businesses, and compliance is required. The new EU rules 
are also important for other reasons. The previous EU rules (in the 
DPD95) were viewed around the world as the best standard for data 
protection and for other countries modeling their own data protec-
tion rules. European data protection laws are frequently recognized as 
being “ of the highest standards in the world.” † There have also been 
calls for the US to adopt similar rules. Indeed, certain US state rules 
have been described as similar to some of the EU rules.
Any processing of personal data in the context of the activities of 
an establishment of a controller or a processor organization in the EU 
should be carried out in accordance with the GDPR, regardless of 
whether the processing itself takes place within the EU.‡ 
To ensure that persons are not deprived of protection, the process-
ing of personal data of individual data subjects who are in the EU by 
a controller or a processor not established in the EU is subject to the 
GDPR where the processing is related to offering goods or services to 
such individual data subjects (irrespective of a payment).§

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
Processing of personal data of individual data subjects who are in 
the EU by a controller or processor not established in the EU should 
also be subject to the GDPR when it is related to the monitoring of 
the behavior of such individual data subjects (including tracking and 
profiling) insofar as their behavior takes place within the EU.* 
The new GDPR also provides for a one-stop-shop mechanism 
to facilitate organizations in an efficient non-duplicatory manner. 
“ Businesses will only have to deal with one single [data protection] 
supervisory authority. This is estimated to save € 2.3 billion per year.” † 
This will facilitate US– EU business and organizations doing business 
with the EU.
Comparable Analysis Beneficial
All US organizations operating in or targeting the EU or receiving 
EU data need to be aware of and compliant with EU data protec-
tion rules. Even if not directly applicable to certain US organizations 
(e.g., not operating in or targeting the EU or receiving EU data), it is 
still beneficial to consider the EU data protection regime. The nature 
of these rules means that they apply generally and across the board 
to all  EU personal data. In the US, comparable rules do not apply 
wholesale, but rather are limited to specific sectors or specific sec-
toral types of personal data, for example health data, genomic data, 
financial data, data involved in certain types of data breaches, and 
so on. The EU rules are general, wide, and all-encompassing. The 
US rules are limited and case specific— thus naturally leaving many 
gaps. How the EU regime deals with data in areas not yet expressly 
covered in the US can be insightful, instructive, or of assistance to 
organizations, officers within organizations responsible for dealing 
with personal data, and external advisors. It is also useful to review 
and compare how the EU deals with issues that also arise and are of 
concern in the US.

Pre-Problem-Solving Works in EU and US
While there is a long history and evolution of data protection con-
cerns, the current increase in security, hacking, data breach, and data 
loss brings data protection issues to the fore. When issues go wrong, 
there can be litigation, lost sales, customer drop-off, diminished 
goodwill and brand reputation, and so on. There can be direct tan-
gible financial effects. Corporate officers and even managing directors 
are in the spotlight in ways that have not occurred before. Sometimes 
they can be sued. There are increasing examples of corporate officers 
and managing directors losing their positions as a result of not ade-
quately dealing with or preventing data breach issues.
The EU data protection regime now expressly mandates compliance 
with the concept of data protection by design.* This is the concept 
of formally considering data protection issues and implications at all 
stages of development and roll out of new products and services— ver-
sus an add-on consideration at the very end of development. In the 
latter instance, if problems arise, it may mean costly amendments, 
delaying go-live, cancelling a launch, major revisions, or worse, can-
celling the product entirely. It can be worse if the product has actually 
launched, with withdrawal, lost sales, and so on arising. Incorporating 
data protection by design is a form of pre-problem solving, ensur-
ing that speed bump or road block problems do not arise at a critical 
stage later on. US companies who transact with the EU can benefit by 
pre-problem solving US and EU issues all at once, avoiding potential 
problems in advance as well as gaining associated efficiencies, cus-
tomer goodwill, and commercial advantage over competitors. In any 
event, data protection by design (and privacy by design) is increasingly 
recognized and popular in technology organizations in Canada, the 
US, and Europe. Microsoft has adopted and promoted this concept 
for many years. Other multinational organizations such as Intel and 
McAfee also favor the concept. Dr. Anne Cavoukian, Ontario data 
protection commissioner, is credited with developing and promot-
ing the concept as well as tools for applying the concept to real life 
*	 Data protection by design (DPbD) is also sometimes referred to as privacy by design 
(PbD).

situations. The book The Privacy Engineer’ s Manifesto, Getting from 
Policy to Code to QA to Value * also promotes this concept.
As indicated on Page 1, where US organizations and businesses 
collecting or receiving EU personal data fail to comply with the EU 
data protection regime, the bottom line can suffer directly from very 
significant official fines and penalties— quite apart from the potential 
for users, customers, or representative bodies to pursue litigation in 
addition.
This guide is essential for all US businesses and organizations that 
directly or indirectly deal with EU personal data, as well as those who 
aim to expand their markets. It is also essential to seek to reduce or 
avoid data incidents arising regardless of where the organization is 
located.

from Policy to Code to QA  (Aspen Open, 2014).
REGULATIONS AND DIRECTIVES 
On a technical note, the import of an EU “ regulation”  is that it 
is applies across all EU member state countries once initiated, as 
opposed to an EU “ directive,”  which must wait until each mem-
ber state enacts its own national laws to bring in or effect the 
directive. The previous rules from 1995 applied via a data protec-
tion directive (DPD95) which was required to be implemented 
on a case-by-case basis in each EU member state. The new rules 
in the GDPR apply directly without the need for country-by-
country legislation to implement them.
RECITALS AND ARTICLES IN 
REGULATIONS AND DIRECTIVES 
The new GDPR, like all formal EU regulations, is divided into 
“ recitals”  and “ articles.”  The recitals provide background inter-
pretative context but are not legally binding. The articles are the 
legally binding rules of the regulation. It is recommended to

consider both so as to better understand the rational and legal 
import of the new EU data protection rules.

US–EU Similarities, 
Differences, and Bridges
Introduction
There is a long history of concern over and protection for privacy. 
More recently, there is concern over and particular protections for 
informational protection or data protection. These concerns are not 
unique to the EU or, indeed, to the United States. Most countries 
share these concerns.
However, there are some differences in how protection is achieved 
and how wide specific protections are. One avenue is to establish pro-
tection for personal data generally across all sectors of the economy, 
while another approach may be to provide for individualized data pro-
tections, sector by sector. The EU favors the former approach, while 
the United States in general favors data protection sector by sector or 
issue by issue. 
History
The legal discussion in relation to privacy is frequently linked to Warren 
and Brandeis’ s legal article in 1890 entitled “ The Right to Privacy,”  
published in the Harvard Law Review .* Warren and Brandeis were 
notable jurists and academics in the United States.
Arguably, data protection is (part of) the modern coalface of the 
discussion in relation to privacy and privacy protection.† Data pro-
tection, in many respects, can be wider than privacy rights and is 
an express stand-alone fundamental right. The EU data protection

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
regime can be seen as setting standards in certain areas of informa-
tional privacy protection, which have come to be followed in other 
jurisdictions internationally, beyond the EU,* and even followed by or 
influencing US states.
The growth of the processing of information relating to individu-
als in electronic computer data format from the 1970s onwards led 
to ever-increasing concerns regarding such processing. Existing laws 
were “ insufficient to deal with concerns about the amount of informa-
tion relating to individuals that was held by organizations in elec-
tronic form.” † 
The impetus for formal national data protection laws began in 
Germany, and has since spread. Originally, the main EU data pro-
tection instrument was the DPD95.‡ The purpose is largely to pro-
mote openness and transparency to individuals of information held 
about them in filing systems, whether manual or computerized, and 
*	 See Birnhack, The EU data protection directive: An engine of a global regime,  
Computer Law & Security Report   (2008) (2) at 512. However, the data protection 
regime is separate and distinct from privacy. Data protection and data protection 
rights exist as stand-alone enumerated fundamental rights in the EU, separate from 
privacy. Data protection is, in many respects, more explicit and enumerated than 
privacy rights. There have also been calls for international-level data protection rules. 
Certainly, if this were to come to pass, it could bring greater certainty for both orga-
nizations, industry, and individual data subjects. There are frequent comments in 
relation to disparities between US and EU protection for personal data. While this 
is frequently correct, there are also frequent similarities as well as, it has to be said, 
certain instances where US laws may be more explicit than EU data protection laws. 
More recently, there is also an endeavor called “ privacy bridges,”  whereby academics 
are trying to link up the similarities and common interest of protection between the 
US and EU in relation to personal data concerns. Spiekermann and Novotny, “ A 
Vision for Global Privacy Bridges: Technical and Legal Measures for International 
Data Markets,”   Computer Law and Security Report   (2015) (31:2) 181. Peter Heim 
states that “ European data protection laws have some of the highest standards in the 
world,”  Heim, “ The Quest for Clarity on Data Protection and Security,”   Network 
Security   (2014) (2014:2) 8.

‡	 The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and previously the 1995 data 
protection directive (DPD95) are the main EU measures. However, there was pre-
viously the Council of Europe Data Protection Convention in relation to personal 
data (1981). Various EU states also enacted personal data legislation nationally. For 
example, the German state of Hessen enacted a data protection law in 1970, and a 
federal German data protection law was proposed in 1971.

11
US–EU Similarities, Differences, and Bridges
to protect their data protection interests and rights in relation to such 
information.* 
Even prior to the DPD95, concern for informational privacy in 
the computer environment was recognized in an early data protec-
tion regime. The Council of Europe proposed and enacted the Data 
Protection Convention in 1981.†  National data protection laws 
were enacted following on from the Data Protection Convention. 
Subsequently, these were updated and amended to also implement 
the DPD95.
The Data Protection Convention sets out the following principles 
and requirements: personal data must be
•	 Obtained and processed fairly and lawfully.
•	 Stored for specified and legitimate purposes and not used in a 
way incompatible with those purposes.
•	 Adequate, relevant, and not excessive in relation to the pur-
poses for which the personal data are stored.
•	 Accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date.
•	 Preserved in a form that permits identification of the individ-
ual data subject for no longer than is required for the purpose 
for which those data are collected and stored.‡
In addition, the Data Protection Convention provides that
•	 Personal data that reveal racial origin, political opinions, or 
religious or other beliefs, as well as personal data relating to 
health or sexual life, or criminal convictions, may not be pro-
cessed automatically unless member state law provides appro-
priate safeguards.
•	 Appropriate security measures must be taken to protect per-
sonal data stored in automated data files against accidental or 
unauthorized destruction, accidental loss, and unauthorized 
access, alteration, or dissemination.

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
•	 Any data subject is entitled to establish the existence of an 
automated personal data file, its main purposes, as well as the 
identity, habitual residence, or principal place of business of 
the controller.
•	 Any data subject is entitled to obtain at reasonable inter-
vals and without excessive delay or expense confirmation of 
whether personal data are stored in the automated data file as 
well as communication to the individual data subject of such 
data in an intelligible form.
•	 Any data subject is entitled to obtain rectification or erasure 
of such data if these have been processed contrary to the pro-
visions of domestic law giving effect to the basic principles set 
out in the Data Protection Convention.*
•	 Any data subject is entitled to have a remedy if a request for 
confirmation, communication, rectification, or erasure is not 
complied with.†
Similarities and Differences
The United States and the EU both have data protection rules. 
Importantly, in the United States, these are generally only on an issue-
by-issue basis. The US issue-by-issue approach therefore leaves many 
gaps and areas not covered by data protection in the United States. 
The EU data protection regime and the laws referred to in the 
previous section generally operate at a wide general level to cover all 
types of personal data. They govern all personal data collection and 
processing use by an organization. 
This differing approach to types of personal data, and what is and is 
not covered by the data protection regimes, is a significant difference 
between the EU and the United States.
One of the most notable examples of a specific data protection type 
law in the United States is the Video Privacy  Protection Act  of 1988. 
This specific act was introduced after Judge Robert Bork was asked 
embarrassing questions relating to his alleged video rentals during 
his Supreme Court nomination hearing. The Act was introduced as a 
*	 Articles 5 and 6 of the Data Protection Convention.
†	 ibid.

13
US–EU Similarities, Differences, and Bridges
reaction to ensure that in future, personal data relating to an individ-
ual’ s personal video rental history would remain protected, personal, 
and confidential.
As yet, the US approach to data protection for an individual’ s 
personal information and data is on a case-by-case basis. There is no 
wide, general, uniform law in the United States across all types of 
personal data.
While there is no general overall federal law governing the collec-
tion and use of all personal data or personally identifiable information 
(PII), there are a growing number of individual state laws. These state 
laws are also frequently issue specific.
Certain federal data protection– focused laws relate to the col-
lection, use, and processing of certain types of personal data. These 
include financial or health information and electronic (marketing) 
communications. The following federal legislation relates, whether 
directly or  indirectly, to personal data issues

•	 Title V of Gramm– Leach– Bliley Act (GLBA).†

•	 Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and 
Marketing Act (CANSPAM Act).¶ 
*	 Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act) 15 USC § § 41– 58. The FTC may agree 
mutual agreements of understanding with data protection supervisory authori-
ties or regulators in other countries. One such example is the bilateral agreement 
between the FTC and the national official data protection supervisory authority in 
Ireland, entitled the Data Protection Commissioner. The official agreement is the 
Memorandum of Understanding with US Federal Trade Commission (FTC– Irish 
Data Protection Commissioner).

and Accountability Act (HIPAA).*
Organizations also need to note, for example, the

•	 FTC Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral 
Advertising.
While various states have some form of data protection– related 
legislation, California law and policy frequently lead the way in rela-
tion to personal data and data protection. Other states sometimes fol-
low the lead of the California initiatives in this area: for example, 
the California Security Breach Notification Law and the California 
Online Privacy Protection Act. California was the first state to enact a 
security breach notification law.† This requires that organizations dis-
close breaches of security to individuals whose personal information 
was acquired by an unauthorized third party. The California Shine the 
Light law‡ requires organizations to disclose details of the third par-
ties with whom they have shared their personal data. The California 
data security law§ requires organizations to implement security proce-
dures to protect personal data against unauthorized access, destruc-
tion, use, modification, or disclosure. On occasion, the approach of 
Californian data protection laws is compared to the EU data protec-
tion model. Presidents Obama and Trump favor initiatives (including 
an Executive Order) in relation to federal agency data security.
Some of the contrasts and similarities between US and EU data 
protection law include 
•	 Under EU data protection law, a legal basis and a legitimate 
purpose are needed before personal data may be processed.
•	 In the United States, commercial data may be processed 
unless there is some legal rule preventing it.
•	 The EU recognizes data protection as a fundamental right.

US–EU Similarities, Differences, and Bridges
•	 Lawful conditions on collecting and processing personal data 
apply as well as consent for the use of personal data.
•	 The EU also places emphasis on the principle of proportional-
ity and expectations of data protection.
•	 While the issues and concerns for individuals may be the 
same in the United States, the EU, and elsewhere, the form 
of regulating is somewhat different: that is, general versus 
specific.
•	 The EU applies a high level of data protection.
•	 Enforcement, however, is often left to individuals and to data 
protection supervisory authorities. This is not at all dissimi-
lar to the United States, where individuals, class actions, and 
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) actions can apply.
•	 The United States has a large number of privacy laws, both 
federal and state, as well as the federal prosecutors and even 
state prosecutors/attorneys general.
•	 The FTC has emerged as the leading data protection regula-
tor in the United States.
•	 It engages in investigations, consent orders, and prosecutions.
•	 Enforcement actions also arise under HIPAA legislation.*

data protection bridges report states that there are indeed areas of 
commonality, but also differences, thus demonstrating a need for 
bridges and related research.
These data protection bridges are 
•	 BRIDGE 1: DEEPEN THE ARTICLE 29 DATA 
PROTECTION WORKING PARTY (WP29)/FEDERAL 
TRADE COMMISSION RELATIONSHIP—The EU 
WP29 and the US FTC should commit to regular, public 
dialogue and policy coordination on leading data protec-
tion challenges faced in the transatlantic region. This bridge 
would institutionalize the working relationship between the 
WP29 and the FTC via a memorandum of understanding 
(MOU). This MOU will foster better cooperation and more 
efficient policy development and enforcement by these regula-
tors, thereby delivering enhanced data protection to individu-
als on both sides of the Atlantic.
•	 BRIDGE 2: USER CONTROLS—Users around the 
world struggle for control over their personal information. 
This bridge calls on technology companies, data protection 
regulators, industry organizations, data protection scholars, 
civil society groups, and technical standards bodies to come 
together to develop easy-to-use mechanisms for express-
ing individual decisions regarding user choice and consent. 
The outcome should be usable technology, developed in an 
open standards-setting process, combined with clear regula-
tory guidance from both EU and US regulators, resulting in 
enhanced control by users over how data about them are col-
lected and used.
•	 BRIDGE 
3: 
NEW 
APPROACHES 
TO 
TRANSPARENCY—This bridge recommends that the 
WP29 and the FTC rely on the MOU described in Bridge 
1 to coordinate their recommendations on data protec-
tion notices and then jointly encourage an international 
standardization process. By pooling the insights that they 
gained from earlier and ongoing standardization efforts, 
and drawing on lessons learned by other industries on 

17
US–EU Similarities, Differences, and Bridges
required notifications (e.g., nutrition labeling), they can 
develop more definitive guidance on transparency and 
thereby achieve a necessary condition for the user controls 
described in Bridge 2.
•	 BRIDGE 4: USER-COMPLAINT MECHANISMS: 
REDRESS OF VIOLATIONS OUTSIDE A USER’ S 
REGION—Users interact with web-based services from all 
around the world. When they have complaints, they should 
have an easy path to resolution. This bridge encourages all 
online services to provide contact information and calls on 
the appropriate EU and US public agencies to cooperate on 
the creation of a directory of basic information about relevant 
jurisdictions and how and to whom complaints concerning 
data protection may be brought.
•	 BRIDGE 5: GOVERNMENT ACCESS TO PRIVATE 
SECTOR PERSONAL DATA—This bridge offers guid-
ance to, in particular, telecommunication and Internet ser-
vices faced with surveillance from their own and foreign 
governments. Specifically, it recommends that all such 
companies establish uniform internal practices for handling 
such requests regardless of jurisdiction, citizenship, and data 
location; report on practices relating to government access 
requests on a regular basis; and adopt best practices based on 
international standards (such as those of the Global Network 
Initiative), with the goal of developing a framework for assess-
ing and responding to requests for data originating outside 
national territory.
•	 BRIDGE 
6: 
BEST 
PRACTICES 
FOR 
DE-IDENTIFICATION OF PERSONAL DATA—
De-identification of personal data is a critical tool for protect-
ing personal information from abuse. This bridge calls on EU 
and US regulators, who already share common views about 
de-identification, to identify concrete, shared standards on 
de-identification practices. Common standards will improve 
data protections on both sides of the Atlantic while enhanc-
ing legal certainty for both EU and US organizations that 
follow these recommendations.

18
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
•	 BRIDGE 7: BEST PRACTICES FOR SECURITY 
BREACH 
NOTIFICATION—Although 
information 
security breaches have a global impact on users, given that 
many of them reside in different jurisdictions than those of 
service providers, there is a lack of uniformity in security 
breach notification laws, both domestically (across distinct 
sectors) and even more so internationally. This bridge recom-
mends that the relevant authorities cooperate when dealing 
with multi-nation breaches, both in terms of enforcement and 
in establishing a more harmonized breach-reporting regime. 
It also recommends that firms complement their reporting 
obligations by adopting robust information governance sys-
tems, which should result in an increase in the level of data 
protection of end users.
•	 BRIDGE 8: ACCOUNTABILITY—Both EU and US reg-
ulators have accepted the idea of organizational responsibility 
(or “ accountability” ) as a means to assure data protection and 
for firms to satisfy domestic legal obligations. This bridge iden-
tifies the common elements of enforceable corporate account-
ability programs. It recommends that the WP29 and FTC 
harmonize their approaches while emphasizing the need for 
the private sector to develop more effective means for external 
verification and scaling of accountability programs for use by 
small and medium enterprises. The hoped-for outcome is an 
improvement in actual data processing practices that not only 
benefits individuals but also offers companies more effective 
compliance guidelines for international operations.
•	 BRIDGE 
9: 
GREATER 
GOVERNMENT-TO-
GOVERNMENT ENGAGEMENT—This bridge pro-
poses that in parallel with the MOU suggested in Bridge 1, 
EU and US executive agencies and decision-making bodies 
engage in active dialogue and, where appropriate, effective 
coordination of their regulatory activity. Such government-to-
government engagement seems especially valuable in a num-
ber of new sectors in the transatlantic economy (an interesting 
example is the development and use of drones) that pose acute 
data protection challenges. The exchange of information on 
a regular basis and development of transparent platforms for 

19
US–EU Similarities, Differences, and Bridges
active discussion and practical policy development will yield 
a variety of benefits to governments, individuals, and com-
mercial actors alike.
•	 BRIDGE 10: COLLABORATING ON PRIVACY 
RESEARCH PROGRAMS—Finally, this bridge encour-
ages the growth of common perspectives on data protection 
in the EU and the United States by fostering collaborative, 
multidisciplinary engagement of data protection researchers 
on both sides of the Atlantic. It identifies barriers to bringing 
together academics to work on joint data protection research 
projects in a variety of fields and suggests ways to overcome 
them.
The WP29 is made up of representatives of each of the respective 
national data protection supervisory authorities in the EU. The refer-
ence to the WP29 changes under the new GDPR, where the WP29 
is replaced by a new European Data Protection Board (EDPB).
The data protection bridges report states that
These ten data protection bridges are all practical steps that require no 
change to the law yet will result in better-informed, and more consis-
tent, regulatory cooperation, policy guidance, and enforcement activity. 
Our mandate as a group is to produce recommendations that can be 
acted upon without changes in the legislative environment of either the 
EU or the United States.* 
The data protection bridges report adds that
While many members of the expert group that produced these recom-
mendations have strong views about the future direction of US and 
EU rules, here we seek to surmount challenges facing the information 
society, without entering into divisive debates on changes to underlying 
constitutional or statutory frameworks. Changing the law is an arduous

and lengthy endeavour, and waiting for it to happen can become simply 
an excuse for inaction. Ideally, this report will bring about improve-
ments in protection due to positive actions not only by governments and 
regulatory authorities, but also by the private sector, civil society, and 
others, all of whom may implement its recommendations.* 
Organizations and individuals must assess their expanded rights 
and obligations under the new GDPR, as well as initiatives referring 
to the commonality between the US and the EU, such as the data 
protection bridges initiative.
KEY CONCEPTS 
There are differences between the US and the EU on data pro-
tection; however, there are also many similarities. The issues of 
concern facing organizations, individuals, and regulators are 
similar across an increasingly connected globe. Pre-problem-
solving is a shared interest regardless of borders.

The Need for Data 
Protection
Introduction
Why do we have a data protection regime? There is a data protection 
regime because of the legal and political recognition that society 
respects the personal data protection and informational data protection 
of individuals. In the context of data protection, that means respect 
for, control of, and security in relation to informational personal data. 
Data protection protects personal data relating to individuals, which 
includes employees, contractors, customers, and users. Personal data 
issues apply to every individual and every organization.
Data protection rules exist to ensure
•	 Protection in relation to personal information.
•	 Obtaining consent from individuals to collect and process 
personal data.
•	 Security in respect to personal information.
•	 Protection against personal informational abuse.
•	 Protection against personal information theft and identity 
theft.
•	 Protection against unsolicited direct marketing.
•	 Protection for the data protection rights of individuals.
•	 Increased protection in recognition of new technological and 
Big Data issues.
•	 Transparency in collection.
•	 Transparency in use and processing.
•	 Pre-problem-solving.
•	 No waiting for a problem issue to arise and reacting to it, 
whether breaches, incidents, or access requests.

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
Growing Importance of Data Protection
Data protection compliance is important for all organizations, large 
and small. One example of this importance is data protection super-
visory authority investigation of various organizations in relation to 
specific data protection issues. The commercial reality of cross-border 
transfers of personal data is also recognized in transfer mechanisms 
created for the default transfer ban on transferring personal data out-
side of the EU (as many countries have lower standards of personal 
data protection). The Intel group, for example, has been approved 
under the EU binding corporate rules (BCR) transfer procedure to 
exempt it from the EU transfer ban in relation to transferring per-
sonal data.*
Fundamental Right
The protection of natural persons’  personal data is a fundamental 
right. Article 8(1) of the EU Charter and Article 16(1) of the EU 
Treaty provide that everyone has the right to the protection of their 
personal data.† The principles and rules on the protection of individu-
als’  personal data must, whatever the nationality or residence of natu-
ral persons, respect their fundamental rights, notably their right to 
personal data protection.‡ The right to personal data protection may 
*	 This examination and approval process occurred under the auspices of the Irish data 
protection supervisory authority (DPC). The BCR procedure is one of the mech-
anisms by which an organization can export or transfer personal data outside of 
the European Economic Area (EEA). Without the BCR (or a similar exemption 
mechanism), the organization would not be permitted to make such a transfer. These 
transfers are sometimes referred to as trans-border data flows or cross‑border data 
flows. The default position is that trans-border data flows may not occur from the 
EEA to non-EEA countries unless exempted. See “ Commissioner Approves Intel 
Corporation Binding Corporate Rules,”  DPC.

NEED FOR DATA PROTECTION
sometimes be balanced with other fundamental rights in accordance 
with the principle of proportionality.*
Digitization
The increasing “ centralisation of information through the computeri-
sation of various records has made the right of [data protection] a fun-
damental concern.” † Data protection is important, increasingly topical 
and an issue of legally required compliance for all organizations. More 
importantly, it is part of management and organizational best prac-
tice. Individuals, employees, and customers expect that their personal 
data will be respected. They are increasingly aware of their rights, and 
increasingly enforce their rights. “ [D]ata protection issues are never 
far from the horizon at the moment. There are waves of discussion in 
this area …  and …  that wave is riding high.” ‡ The significant atten-
tion focused recently on the fallout of the EU– US Safe Harbor trans-
fer regime being declared void,§ its impact on transatlantic business, 
and the complex political negotiations required for the new EU– US 
transfer regime entitled EU– US Privacy Shield highlight the main-
stream commercial and political significance of data protection law 
and the importance of US– EU trade.
Online Abuse
The issue of online abuse, which involves, among other things, harass-
ment, threats, revenge porn, and data protection, has also been hit-
ting the headlines.¶ Data protection issues are also in the headlines

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
because of public and official data protection supervisory authority 
concerns with the problem of the damage of certain permanent data 
online. The EU Court of Justice, on the foot of such concerns, issued 
an important decision in a “ right to be forgotten”  case directing that 
certain personal data online had to be deleted from search engine 
listings.* This case received major media attention both inside and 
outside of the EU. Issues of takedown, deletion, and forgetting have 
been increasing in importance, and sometimes also urgency, for many 
years. The award-winning book Delete: The Virtue of Forgetting in the 
Digital Age  highlights some of these issues.†
Benefits
A further reason why data protection is important, and increasingly 
the focus of press attention, is that organizations are increasingly 
using security and respect for data protection as an advantage and 
commercial differentiator in the marketplace. Apple has repeatedly 
announced that it does not operate on a data-intrusive model  collect-
ing user data. In fact, it has even criticized some of its technology 
competitors. Most recently, Apple has had a skirmish with the FBI in 
relation to mandated new software to access iPhone data. Microsoft 
has for many years promoted the data protection– friendly policy of 
data protection by design. Separately, Microsoft has also had an offi-
cial skirmish in relation to protecting and preventing access to per-
sonal data held on its servers outside of the US.
Post Snowden, many US technology companies have been heavily 
lobbying the US administration for a roll back of certain data col-
lection and data retention activities and practices, particularly those 
argued to be extra-judicial, extra-legal, and/or hidden-legal, on the 
basis that they will disadvantage the US-based data-, cloud-, and 
cloud storage– driven industries.

27
NEED FOR DATA PROTECTION
Many companies have been highlighting the fact that they are non-
US based. Companies are now promoting the fact that they have or 
are building EU-based cloud storage facilities, and in some instances, 
that EU data will remain located in the EU.
Applies to All Organizations
All organizations collect and process personal data. Whether they 
are big organizations or new start-ups, they need to comply with the 
data protection regime. Bear in mind also that even a new technology 
start-up can scale relatively quickly to millions of users. Many issues 
enhance the importance of getting the organizational data protec-
tion understanding and compliance model right from day one. These 
include legal obligations; director, board, and officer obligations; 
investigations, fines, penalties, prosecutions, being ordered to delete 
databases, and adverse publicity on the front pages of the press media; 
commercial imperatives, and even positive commercial advantages. If 
one also considers some of the recent large-scale data breach inci-
dents, there are examples of chief technology officers as well as man-
aging directors/CEOs losing their employment positions as a result of 
the incident. On a separate issue, Apple, for example, sees the com-
mercial (and ethical) values in protecting personal data.
In addition, organizations often fail to realize that data protection 
compliance is frequently an issue of dual compliance. They need to be 
looking at both inward  and outward  data processing issues.
Internally, organizations have to be data protection compliant in 
relation to all of their employees’  (and contractors’ ) personal data. 
Traditionally, this may have related to personnel files and employee 
contracts, but it now includes issues of electronic communications, 
social media, Internet usage, filtering, monitoring, on-site activity, 
off-site activity, company devices, employee devices, vehicles, location 
services, and so on. The consequences of getting it wrong are now 
more significant.
Separately, organizations have to be concerned about personal data 
relating to persons outside of the organization, for example custom-
ers, prospects, and so on. Comprehensive data protection compliance 
is also required for those outward-facing issues. The consequences of 
non-compliance are significant.

28
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
Fines
Substantial fines have been imposed in a number of recent cases. Fines, 
and frequency of fines, are increasing. In some instances, organiza-
tions have been ordered to delete their databases. In a new technology 
start-up situation, this can be the company’ s most valuable asset. The 
consequences, therefore, cannot be overstated. Data protection is also 
one of the most important due diligence issues to consider when busi-
nesses are being bought and sold.
A data protection supervisory authority can also impose significant 
fines for a non– data loss incident. A financial organization was fined 
for mixing up details of financial data relating to two separate indi-
viduals. This would have caused financial loss and damage for one of 
the individuals, as they were not credited with all of their payments 
and contributions.* The account details were not kept accurate and up 
to date. This was despite complaint correspondence to the financial 
organization from one of the individuals over a period of time. The 
data protection supervisory authority comments:
We hope this penalty sends a message to all organizations, but par-
ticularly those in the financial sector, that adequate checks must be in 
place to ensure people’ s records are accurate. Staff should also receive 
adequate training on how to manage and maintain them, with any con-
cerns fully investigated in order to ensure problems are addressed at an 
early stage.†
Data Breach and Data Loss
Data protection is also increasing in coverage in mainstream media. 
This is due in part to the large number of recent data loss and data 
breach incidents. These have involved the personal data of millions of 
individuals being lost by commercial organizations and, perhaps more 
worryingly, by trusted government entities.

Office (ICO), “ Prudential Fined £ 50,000 for Customer Account Confusion,”

29
NEED FOR DATA PROTECTION
Up until recently, the issue of data loss was a proverbial small back 
page story. More recently, however, the loss of personal data files of 
tens of millions of individuals in a single instance— including from 
official governmental sources— make data loss a front page issue. 
There is increased scrutiny from the data protection supervisory 
authorities and others, and new regulation of data security issues, pre-
paredness, and reactivity. Organizations must look at security issues 
with increasing rigor. Organizations can face liability issues in breach 
incidents but also in the aggravating situation where a vulnerability 
may have been already known and highlighted internally but was not 
acted on, thus contributing to the breach incident. As well as official 
investigations, fines, penalties, and sanctions, organizations also face 
liability issues to users and in some instances, potential liability to 
banks and financial intermediaries also. Target, for example, was sued 
not just by individual data subjects but also by financial intermediar-
ies. Examples such as this are likely to increase.
Class actions, in relation to both data protection and other issues, 
have been a common theme in the US landscape for many years. 
While these are less common in the EU, they will likely increase in 
future as the new GDPR expressly recognizes the possibility of indi-
vidual data subject representative organizations.
Requirements to Report Data Breaches
There are enhanced obligations to report all data breaches and data 
losses.* There are also enhanced financial penalties. In some instances, 
personal director responsibility for data loss can arise. The need for 
compliance is now a boardroom issue and an issue of senior corpo-
rate compliance. Proactive and complete data protection compliance 
is also a matter of good corporate governance, brand loyalty, and a 
means to ensuring user and customer goodwill.
The frequency and scale of breaches of security are increasing. 
There are many examples, such as breaches at
•	 Yahoo (two breaches affecting 500  million and one billion 
users, respectively).
*	 Unless exempted.

30
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
•	 Adobe.
•	 TalkTalk.
•	 Target.
•	 Home Depot.
•	 Sony PlayStation (70 million individuals’  personal data 
affected in one instance and 25 million affected in another*).
•	 Sony  Interview breach.
•	 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) (official, 22 million 
affected).
•	 Insurer Anthem (80 million affected).
•	 Affair dating website Ashley Madison (37 million affected).
•	 Hotels.
•	 Even security firms; for example, hacking firm Hacking Team.
•	 Children’ s’  toymaker VTech.
•	 and others.
These examples emphasize the increasing importance of data secu-
rity compliance for personal data. The UK Revenue and Customs loss 
of discs with the names, dates of birth, and bank and address details 
for 25 million individuals† and the hack of federal employee databases 
in the US highlight that official breaches also occur. There are already 
many examples of substantial fines for data protection breaches,‡ 
including commercial and official organizations.

vidual customers. See, for example, Oates, “ UK Insurer Hit with Biggest Ever 
Data Loss Fine,”  The Register , August 24, 2010. This was imposed by the Financial 
Services Authority (FSA). Text spammers are often investigated; for example, see 
Arthur, “ Spam Text Senders Face Fines of up to £ 500,000,”  Guardian , October 
1, 2012. A police authority has been fined £ 120,000 in relation to a data breach 
involving unencrypted personal data; see “ Police Force Fines £ 120,000 after Theft 
of Unencrypted Data,”  Guardian , October 16, 2012.

NEED FOR DATA PROTECTION
Prosecutions
The data protection supervisory authorities in the US, EU, and else-
where prosecute breaches. This ability to prosecute includes directors 
as well as companies. Errant outsource private investigators have also 
been prosecuted. Many large organizations have been prosecuted and 
fined in relation to data breach incidents.
Proactive Official Audits
Data protection supervisory authorities are increasingly proactive and 
undertake audits of data protection compliance as well as incidents of 
breaches.* They can also be critical of organizations and the data pro-
tection policies and practices of organizations.†  The phone hacking 
scandal in the United Kingdom also highlights the importance of per-
sonal data.‡ A major news organization had to close down. There has 
been previous criticism from data protection supervisory authorities 
of the abuse of official databases by unauthorized access by police and 
civil servants, sometimes for personal reasons and on other occasions 
being paid for data by external third parties. A previous Minister for 
Justice also criticized unauthorized police access of an official police 
database for personal or non-official use.

authority (DPC). The audit relates to Facebook internationally, outside of the

Need for Updating 
Data Protection
Introduction
The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is overhauling 
and modernizing the data protection regime. Organizations through-
out the EU and elsewhere will be affected and will have to prepare for 
the new rules.
The 1995 data protection directive (DPD95) in the EU dates from 
1995. Obviously, therefore, there have been many changes since. For 
example, it pre-dates online social networking. Cloud computing, Big 
Data and wider Web 2.0 services, online abuse such as revenge porn, 
and so on did not exist in 1995. Modern activities such as drones, 
vehicle data, and self-driving vehicles were not envisaged at the time 
of the 1995 rules.
Threats to personal data and informational data protection have 
increased in line with the increased ease with which personal data 
can be collected and transferred electronically. This has increased fur-
ther with digital technology, computer processing power, Web 2.0,* 
aggregation, Big Data, Internet of things (IoT), localization data, and 
social media.† The Internet continues to develop and also brings up 
new challenges.‡
*	 That is, the second generation of Internet websites and Internet services.
†	 Note, generally, comments of the UK data protection supervisory authority the 
Information Commissioner’ s Office (ICO) in relation to privacy by design (PbD) and 
the report Privacy by Design at https://ico.org.uk. The GDPR refers to data protection 
by design, art. 23. Also note Information and Privacy Commissioner, Ontario.

Protection: Current Issues,”  Legal Information Management (2015) (15:1) 61.

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
The whole area of transfers of personal data outside of the EU 
(known as cross-border transfers)* is regularly changing; for example, 
new countries are added to a white list of permitted data export coun-
tries in relation to the default transfer ban after having been examined 
by the EU Commission. This is one of the cross-border data transfer 
mechanisms. There are also other changes, such as contractual clauses 
and binding corporate rules. If an organization needs to consider 
the possibility of data transfer exports to non-European Economic 
Area (EEA) countries, the most up-to-date transfer rules should be 
assessed, and appropriate professional advice should be sought. It may 
be necessary to have specific legal contracts in place. These rules may 
also be sector specific for certain industries; for example, airlines fly-
ing to the United States from Europe.
Further topical issues are regularly being analyzed by the Article 29 
Data Protection Working Party (WP29) and now the European Data 
Protection Board (EDPB). The WP29 has also recently referred to
•	 The implementation issues for the new GDPR.†
•	 The consequences of the Schrems  EU Court of Justice case.‡
Some of the areas of concern that the GDPR seeks to address§ 
include
•	 The data protection regime in the online age.
•	 Social media.
•	 Cloud computing.
•	 Minimum/maximum standards.
•	 The data protection principles.¶
*	 Previously known as trans-border data flows.

Need for Updating Data Protection
EU Commission
The EU Commission recognizes the need for modern update. The EU 
Commission states* that the policy in reviewing the data protection 
regime seeks to
•	 Modernize the EU legal system for the protection of personal 
data, in particular to meet the challenges resulting from glo-
balization and the use of new technologies.
•	 Strengthen individuals’  rights and at the same time reduce 
administrative formalities to ensure a free flow of personal 
data within the EU and beyond.
•	 Improve the clarity and coherence of the EU rules for personal 
data protection and achieve a consistent and effective imple-
mentation and application of the fundamental right to the 
protection of personal data in all areas of the EU’ s activities.†
It aims to enhance consumer confidence in eCommerce.‡ In addi-
tion, it aims to bring comprehensive savings to organizations, as the 
obligations of complying with somewhat differing member state 
data protection regimes will be reduced, if not eliminated.§ The EU 
Commissioner dealing with data protection issues further summa-
rizes the need for new data protection rules as follows:
The current EU data protection rules date from 1995. Back then, the 
Internet was virtually unknown to most people. Today, 250 million 
people use the Internet daily in Europe.
Think how that has changed our personal data landscape through 
the explosion of ecommerce, social networks, online games and cloud 
computing.
The [EU] Commission has therefore adopted proposals for updat-
ing data protection rules to meet the challenges of the digital age. In

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
particular, the proposals will strengthen protection of …  personal data 
online.*
The GDPR also seems to ensure an element of future proofing to 
deal with further upcoming issues. One EU Minister for Justice states:
A minority of EU citizens had access to personal comput-
ers, mobile phones and Internet when the Data Protection 
Directive was adopted in 1995. The opposite is now the case 
…  developments have in some instances led to …  “ commodi-
tisation of human beings,”  whereby personal information is 
bundled and sold to commercial entities for financial gain. 
This is done without the knowledge or express permission of 
the individual.
The [new] data protection [regime] …  will not only serve to 
protect the [data protection] of all European citizens but, 
in doing so, will also increase the confidence and trust con-
sumers have in online transactions and encourage their 
greater use.
…  [the expanded right to be forgotten] seeks to address the pos-
sible reputational, financial and psychological risks associated 
with social networking and other Internet-based sites. Those 
who fail to comply could face [significant] fines.†
The EU Commission’ s press statement notes that the GDPR “ will 
enable people to better control their personal data. At the same time 
modernised and unified rules will allow businesses to make the most 
of the opportunities of the [EU] Digital Single Market by cutting red 
tape and benefiting from reinforced consumer trust.” ‡

39
Need for Updating Data Protection
The EU Commission also refers to the benefits of the changes. It 
states:
The reform will allow people to regain control of their personal 
data. Two-thirds of Europeans (67%), according to a recent 
Eurobarometer survey, stated they are concerned about not 
having complete control over the information they provide 
online. Seven Europeans out of ten worry about the potential 
use that companies may make of the information disclosed. 
The data protection reform will strengthen the right to data 
protection, which is a fundamental right in the EU, and allow 
them to have trust when they give their personal data.
The new rules address these concerns by strengthening the exist-
ing rights and empowering individuals with more control over 
their personal data.*
These include “ [m]ost notably,”  according to the EU Commission
•	 Easier Access to Your Own Data : Individuals will have more 
information on how their data is processed and this informa-
tion should be available in a clear and understandable way.
•	 A Right to Data Portability : It will be easier to transfer your 
personal data between service providers.
•	 A Clarified “ Right to Be Forgotten”  : When you no longer want 
your data to be processed, and provided that there are no 
legitimate grounds for retaining it, the data will be deleted.
•	 The Right to Know When Your Data Has Been Hacked : For 
example, companies and organizations must notify the 
national [data protection] supervisory authority of serious 
data breaches as soon as possible so that users can take appro-
priate measures.†

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
Clear Modern Rules for Businesses 
In today’ s digital economy, personal data has acquired enormous 
economic significance, in particular in the area of big data. 
By unifying Europe’ s rules on data protection, lawmakers are 
creating a business opportunity and encouraging innovation.
One Continent, One Law 
The [GDPR] will establish one single set of rules that will make 
it simpler and cheaper for companies to do business in the 
EU.
One-Stop-Shop 
Businesses will only have to deal with one single [data protec-
tion] supervisory authority. This is estimated to save € 2.3 bil-
lion per year.
European Rules on European Soil 
Companies based outside of Europe will have to apply the same 
rules when offering services in the EU.
Risk-Based Approach 
The rules will avoid a burdensome one-size-fits-all obligation 
and rather tailor them to the respective risks.
Rules Fit for Innovation 
The [GDPR] will guarantee that data protection safeguards 
are built into products and services from the earliest stage 
of development (data protection by design). [Data protec-
tion]– friendly techniques such as pseudonymization will be 
encouraged, to reap the benefits of big data innovation while 
protecting [data protection].
Benefits for Big and Small Alike 
The data protection reform will stimulate economic growth by 
cutting costs and red tape for European business, especially 
for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The EU’ s data 
protection reform will help SMEs break into new markets. 
Under the new rules, SMEs will benefit from four reductions 
in red tape.*
*	 European Commission: Press release, “ Agreement on Commission’ s EU Data 
Protection Reform Will Boost Digital Single Market,”  Brussels (December 15, 
2015), at http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-15-6321_en.htm. Note format 
amended.

Need for Updating Data Protection
The four red tape reductions are
No More Notifications 
Notifications to [data protection] supervisory authorities are a 
formality that represents a cost for business of € 130 million 
every year. The reform will scrap these entirely.
Every Penny Counts 
Where requests to access data are manifestly unfounded or 
excessive, SMEs will be able to charge a fee for providing 
access.
Data Protection Officers 
SMEs are exempt from the obligation to appoint a data protec-
tion officer insofar as data processing is not their core business 
activity.
Impact Assessments 
SMEs will have no obligation to carry out an impact assessment 
unless there is a high risk.*
The EU Commission also refers to
Better Protection of Citizens’  Data 
Individuals’  personal data will be better protected, when pro-
cessed for any law enforcement purpose including prevention 
of crime. It will protect everyone— regardless of whether they 
are a victim, criminal or witness. All law enforcement pro-
cessing in the EU must comply with the principles of neces-
sity, proportionality and legality, with appropriate safeguards 
for the individuals. Supervision is ensured by independent 
national data protection authorities, and effective judicial 
remedies must be provided.
The Data Protection Directive for Police and Criminal Justice 
Authorities provides clear rules for the transfer of personal 
data by law enforcement authorities outside the EU, to ensure 
that the level of protection of individuals guaranteed in the 
EU is not undermined.†

42
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
In one survey, 72% of Internet users are concerned that they give 
away too much personal data.* However, red tape reduction and eco-
nomic growth are also commercial issues considered under the new 
regime. New technological changes are also recognized and encom-
passed. European harmonization issues are also a central consideration.
Update and New and Enhanced Provisions
The key changes are referred to in the following list. In some respects, 
these could also be seen as advantages of the new GDPR data protec-
tion regime
•	 Administrative costs are to be reduced with a single EU-wide 
set of rules and obligations.
•	 There may be less need to interact with the data protection 
supervisory authority as more responsibility and accountabil-
ity are passed to the organizational level.
•	 The consent requirement has been clarified to mean explicit 
consent (previously there were references to different catego-
ries of consent).
•	 Rights are improved with easier access to personal data as well 
as its transferability.
•	 The enhanced right to be forgotten will improve the position 
of individual data subjects and the ability to delete data.
•	 The EU data protection regime will apply to non-EU entities 
operating with regard to EU personal data and EU citizens.
•	 The national authorities will be able to impose significant 
new fines including millions of euros or a percentage of global 
turnover.†

to demonstrate that they have measures in place to ensure personal 
information is properly protected.” *
The GDPR recognizes the need for updating the rules and that 
there is a need for updating the data protection regime. In particular, 
it refers to the following
•	 Technology and Increased Data Collection : Rapid technologi-
cal developments and globalization have brought new chal-
lenges for the protection of personal data. The scale of the 
collection and sharing of personal data has increased signifi-
cantly. Technology allows both private companies and public 
authorities to make use of personal data on an unprecedented 
scale to pursue their activities. Natural persons increasingly 
make personal information available publicly and globally. 
Technology has transformed both the economy and social 
life, and should further facilitate the free flow of personal data 
within the EU and the transfer to third countries and interna-
tional organizations, while ensuring a high level of protection 
of personal data.†
•	 Need for Stronger Data Protection and Control : These devel-
opments require a strong and more coherent data protection 
framework in the EU, backed by strong enforcement, given 
the importance of creating the trust that will allow the digi-
tal economy to develop across the internal market. Natural 
persons should have control of their own personal data. Legal 
and practical certainty for natural persons, economic opera-
tors, and public authorities should be enhanced.‡
•	 Freedoms and Specific Issues : To ensure a consistent and high 
level of protection of natural persons and to remove the 
obstacles to flows of personal data within the EU, the level of

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
protection of the rights of natural persons with regard to the 
processing of such data should be equivalent in all member 
states. Consistent and homogeneous application of the rules 
for the protection of the fundamental rights of natural per-
sons with regard to the processing of personal data should 
be ensured throughout the EU. Regarding the processing of 
personal data for compliance with a legal obligation, for the 
performance of a task carried out in the public interest, or in 
the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, mem-
ber states should be allowed to maintain or introduce national 
provisions to further specify the application of the rules of 
the GDPR. In conjunction with the general and horizontal 
law on data protection implementing DPD95, member states 
have several sector-specific laws in areas that need more spe-
cific provisions. The GDPR also provides a margin of maneu-
ver for member states to specify its rules, including for the 
processing of special categories of personal data (“ sensitive 
data” ). To that extent, the GDPR does not exclude member 
state law that sets out the circumstances for specific process-
ing situations, including determining more precisely the con-
ditions under which the processing of personal data is lawful.*
•	 Rights and Obligations : The effective protection of personal 
data throughout the EU requires the strengthening and set-
ting out in detail of the rights of individual data subjects 
and the obligations of those who process and determine the 
processing of personal data, as well as equivalent powers 
for monitoring and ensuring compliance with the rules for 
the protection of personal data and equivalent sanctions for 
infringements in the member states.†
•	 Data Flows : The economic and social integration result-
ing from the functioning of the internal market has led to 
a substantial increase in cross-border flows of personal data. 
The exchange of personal data between public and private 
actors, including natural persons, associations, and organiza-
tions, across the EU has increased. National authorities in the 
*	 GDPR Recital 10.

45
Need for Updating Data Protection
member states are being called on by EU law to cooperate 
and exchange personal data so as to be able to perform their 
duties or carry out tasks on behalf of an authority in another 
member state.*
•	 Freedoms, Transfers, Fragmentation, Update Needed : The objec-
tives and principles of DPD95 remain sound, but it has not 
prevented fragmentation in the implementation of data pro-
tection across the EU, legal uncertainty, or a widespread pub-
lic perception that there are significant risks to the protection 
of natural persons, in particular with regard to online activity. 
Differences in the level of protection of the rights of natural 
persons, in particular the right to the protection of personal 
data, with regard to the processing of personal data in the 
member states may prevent the free flow of personal data 
throughout the EU. Those differences may therefore consti-
tute an obstacle to the pursuit of economic activities at the 
level of the EU, distort competition, and impede authorities 
in the discharge of their responsibilities under EU law. Such 
a difference in levels of protection is due to the existence of 
differences in the implementation and application of DPD95.†
	
	
To ensure a consistent and high level of protection of natu-
ral persons and to remove the obstacles to flows of personal 
data within the EU, the level of protection of the rights of 
natural persons with regard to the processing of such data 
should be equivalent in all member states.‡
•	 Protection of Natural Living Persons : The GDPR protects nat-
ural persons , of whatever nationality or residence, regarding 
personal data. The GDPR cannot be claimed by legal persons 
and organizations.§ Protection must be technologically neu-
tral and not depend on the techniques used; otherwise, this

including determining more precisely the conditions for processing personal data;

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
would create a serious risk of circumvention. Protection must 
apply to personal data processing by automated and manual 
means, if the data are contained or are intended to be  contained 
in a filing system.*
	
	
The GDPR should not apply to personal data processing by 
a natural person in the course of a purely personal or house-
hold activity and thus without a connection with a profes-
sional or commercial activity. However, the GDPR applies to 
controllers or processors that provide the means for process-
ing personal data for such personal or household activities.† 
The GDPR does not  apply to data of deceased persons .‡
•	 Identifiers : The background Recitals refer to identifiers and 
the increasing possibility of identifying individuals through 
linking different data sets together. Natural persons may be 
associated with online identifiers provided by their devices, 
applications, tools, and protocols, such as Internet protocol 
addresses, cookie identifiers, or other identifiers such as radio 
frequency identification tags. This may leave traces that, in 
particular when combined with unique identifiers and other 
information received by the servers, may be used to create 
profiles of the natural persons and identify them.§
•	 Combining Data : If the personal data processed by a control-
ler do not permit the controller to identify a natural person, 
the data controller should not be obliged to acquire additional 
information to identify the individual data subject for the 
sole purpose of complying with any provision of the GDPR. 
However, the controller should not refuse to take additional 
information provided by the individual data subject to support 
the exercise of their rights. Identification should include the 
digital identification of an individual data subject, for example

not fall within the GDPR; ibid.

through authentication mechanisms such as the same creden-
tials used by the individual data subject to log in to the online 
service offered by the data controller.*
•	 Coupling : By coupling information from registries, research-
ers can obtain new knowledge of great value with regard to 
widespread medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease, 
cancer, and depression. On the basis of registries, research 
results can be enhanced, as they draw on a larger popula-
tion. Within social science, research on the basis of regis-
tries enables researchers to obtain essential knowledge about 
the long-term correlation of a number of social conditions, 
such as unemployment and education, with other life con-
ditions. Research results obtained through registries provide 
solid, high-quality knowledge, which can provide the basis 
for the formulation and implementation of knowledge-based 
policy, improve the quality of life for a number of people, and 
improve the efficiency of social services. To facilitate scientific 
research, personal data can be processed for scientific research 
purposes, subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards set 
out in EU or member state law.†
•	 Cloud : The popularity of cloud computing and virtualization 
services with users, enterprise, and official organizations is 
ever-increasing. However, there are real concerns in relation 
to data protection, data security,‡ continuity, discovery, liabil-
ity, record-keeping, and so on.§ One commentator refers to

cloud computing as the data protection storm on the hori-
zon.* Any organization considering cloud services needs to 
carefully consider the advantages, disadvantages, assessments, 
and contract assurances that will be required. Such organi-
zations, as well as the service operators, also need to assure 
themselves as to how they ensure data protection compliance.
•	 Need for Consent : The background Recitals refer to the impor-
tant issue of the consent of individual data subjects. Consent 
should be given by a clear affirmative act establishing a freely 
given, specific, informed, and unambiguous indication  of the 
individual data subject’ s agreement to the processing of per-
sonal data relating to them, such as by a written statement, 
including by electronic means, or an oral statement. This 
could include ticking a box when visiting an Internet website, 
choosing technical settings for information society services, 
or another statement or conduct that clearly indicates in this 
context the individual data subject’ s acceptance of the pro-
posed processing of their personal data. Silence, pre-ticked 
boxes, or inactivity should not, therefore, constitute consent. 
Consent should cover all processing activities carried out for 
the same purpose or purposes.†
	
	
When the processing has multiple purposes , consent should 
be given for all of them. If the individual data subject’ s con-
sent is to be given following a request by electronic means, the 
request must be clear, concise, and not unnecessarily disrup-
tive to the use of the service for which it is provided.‡
	
	
Where processing is based on the individual data sub-
ject’ s consent, the controller should be able to demonstrate 
that the individual data subject has given consent to the pro-
cessing operation. In particular in the context of a written 
declaration on another matter, safeguards should ensure that 
the individual data subject is aware of the fact that, and the 
extent to which, consent is given. A declaration of consent

pre-formulated by the controller should be provided in an 
intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain 
language, and it should not contain unfair terms.*
	
	
For consent to be informed, the individual data subject 
should be aware at least of the identity of the controller and 
the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are 
intended. Consent should not be regarded as freely given if 
the individual data subject has no genuine or free choice or is 
unable to refuse or withdraw consent without detriment.†
	
	
To ensure that consent is freely given, consent should not 
provide a valid legal ground for the processing of personal data 
in a specific case where there is a clear imbalance between the 
individual data subject and the controller, in particular where 
the controller is a public authority and it is therefore unlikely 
that consent was freely given in all the circumstances of that 
specific situation. Consent is presumed not to be freely given 
if it does not allow separate consent to be given to different 
personal data processing operations, despite its being appro-
priate in the individual case, or if the performance of a con-
tract, including the provision of a service, is dependent on 
the consent despite such consent not being necessary for such 
performance.‡
	
	
For processing to be lawful, personal data should be pro-
cessed on the basis of the consent of the individual data sub-
ject concerned or some other legitimate basis, laid down by 
law, either in the GDPR or in other EU or member state law 
as referred to in the GDPR, including the necessity for com-
pliance with the legal obligation to which the controller is 
subject or the necessity for the performance of a contract to 
which the individual data subject is party or to take steps at 
*	 GDPR Recital 42. In line with Directive 93/13/EEC, a declaration of consent pre-
formulated by the controller should be provided in an intelligible and easily acces-
sible form, using clear and plain language, and it should not contain unfair terms;

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
the request of the individual data subject prior to entering into 
a contract.*
•	 Consent : Broader parameters are contained in the GDPR in 
relation to consent. The definition and conditions are broader 
than previously. The inclusion of the words “ freely given,”  
“ specific,”  and “ unambiguous indication”  in Article 4(11) is 
more specific than the previous “ unambiguously”  consented.
•	 Consent and Scientific Research Purposes : It is often not pos-
sible to fully identify the purpose of personal data processing 
for scientific research purposes at the time of data collec-
tion. Therefore, individual data subjects should be allowed to 
give their consent to certain areas of scientific research when 
in keeping with recognized ethical standards for scientific 
research. Individual data subjects should have the opportu-
nity to give their consent only to certain areas of research or 
parts of research projects to the extent allowed by the intended 
purpose.†
•	 Pseudonymization and Anonymization : The background 
Recitals refer to the need for pseudonymization and anony-
mization. Personal data that have undergone pseudonymiza-
tion but that could be attributed to a natural person by the use 
of additional information should be considered to be informa-
tion on an identifiable natural person. To determine whether 
a natural person is identifiable, account should be taken of 
all the means reasonably likely to be used, such as singling 
out, either by the controller or by another person to identify 
the natural person directly or indirectly. To ascertain whether 
means are reasonably likely to be used to identify the natural 
person, account should be taken of all objective factors, such 
as the costs of, and the amount of time required for, identi-
fication, taking into consideration the available technology at 
the time of the processing and technological developments. 
The principles of data protection should therefore not apply 
to anonymous information— that is, information that does 
not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person— or 
*	 GDPR Recital 40.
†	 GDPR Recital 33.

51
Need for Updating Data Protection
to personal data rendered anonymous in such a manner that 
the individual data subject is not or is no longer identifiable. 
The GDPR does not  therefore concern the processing of such 
anonymous information, including for statistical or research 
purposes.*
	
	
The application of pseudonymization to personal data can 
reduce the risks to the individual data subjects concerned and 
help controllers and processors to meet their data protection 
obligations. The explicit introduction of “ pseudonymization”  
in the GDPR is not intended to preclude any other measures 
of data protection† to create incentives to apply pseudonymiza-
tion when processing personal data; measures of pseudony-
mization should, while allowing general analysis, be possible 
within the same controller when that controller has taken the 
technical and organizational measures necessary to ensure, 
for the processing concerned, that the GDPR is implemented 
and that additional information for attributing the personal 
data to a specific individual data subject is kept separately. 
The controller processing the personal data should indicate 
the authorized persons within the same controller.‡
•	 Added Innovative Measures : Commentators have indicated 
that parts of the GDPR contain particular “ legislative inno-
vation.” § Some examples of this innovation are indicated to 
be the
•	 Data protection principles
•	 Individual data subjects’  rights
•	 Controllers’  and processors’  obligations
•	 Regulation issues regarding technologies¶
	
	
It has been noted that while the DPD95 emphasizes pro-
tection for the fundamental rights of individuals “ and in par-
ticular their right to [data protection],”  the GDPR in Articles 
1 and 2 stresses the need to protect the fundamental rights of

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
individuals “ and in particular their right to the protection of 
personal data.” * Further references also emphasize data pro-
tection as a stand-alone concept from data protection, such as 
data protection assessments and data protection by design.
•	 Consistency : There is a new consistency mechanism whereby 
the national data protection authorities are obliged to coop-
erate with each other and with the EU Commission.† Two 
examples given include data protection assessments and also 
obligation in terms of notifying individual data subjects in 
relation to data breaches.‡
•	 Data Portability : Data portability is a newly expressed right. 
It implies the right of data subjects to obtain from the [data] 
controller a copy of their personal data in a structured and 
commonly used format (Article 18.1) …  data portability is a 
kind of right to backup and use personal information under 
the management of the controller. Second, data portability 
grants the right to transmit personal data and other informa-
tion provided by the data subject from one automated process-
ing system to another one (Article 18.2) …  therefore the right 
to take personal data and leave.§
•	 Proportionality and Excessive Processing : The DPD95 requires 
that the controller must not process personal data excessively. 
However, this is now more limited. The GDPR states that data 
collection and processing must be limited to the minimum.
•	 Automated Decisions : The DPD95 Article 15 protection in 
relation to automated individual decisions “ is considerably 
enlarged” ¶ regarding profiling in GDPR Articles 21 and 22. 
The use of, inter alia , the word “ measure”  in the GDPR as 
opposed to “ decision”  in the DPD95 makes the category of 
activity encompassed within the obligation now much wider.** 
There is greater individual data subject protection. While there

were previously two exemptions, in terms of contract and also 
a specific law, the GDPR adds a third in terms of consent from 
the individual data subject. However, controllers will need to 
ensure a stand-alone consent for profiling separate from any 
consent for data collection and processing per se.*
•	 Policies and Procedures : The GDPR also moves significantly 
further than the DPD95 in terms of creating obligations, 
responsibility, and liability on controllers.† Appropriate poli-
cies must be implemented by controllers, as well as compliant 
data processing, secure data processing, the undertaking of 
data protection impact assessments, liability as between joint 
controllers, appointing representatives within the EU where 
the controllers are located elsewhere, and provisions regard-
ing processors.‡
•	 Controllers/Processors : While the DPD95 imposed compensa-
tion obligations on controllers in the case of harm to individ-
ual data subjects, the GDPR extends liability to processors. In 
addition, where harm is suffered by individual data subjects, 
any joint controller and/or processors are “ jointly and sever-
ally liable for the entire amount of the damage.” §
•	 Data Protection by Design, Data Protection by Default, and 
Impact Assessments : The concepts of data protection by design, 
data protection by default, and impact assessments all empha-
size the ability of the data protection regime to become 
involved in standards setting and the regulation of particu-
lar technologies and technical solutions.¶ The Ontario Data 
Protection Commissioner, Anne Cavoukian, refers to data 
protection and privacy by design (a form of data protection by 
design).** The GDPR describes it as follows in GDPR Article 
25, indicating that

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
	
	
[t]aking into account the state of the art, the cost of imple-
mentation and the nature, scope, context and purposes 
of processing as well as the risks of varying likelihood and 
severity for rights and freedoms of natural persons posed by 
the processing, the controller shall, both at the time of the 
determination of the means for processing and at the time 
of the processing itself, implement appropriate technical and 
organisational measures, such as pseudonymisation, which 
are designed to implement data-protection principles, such as 
data minimisation, in an effective manner and to integrate the 
necessary safeguards into the processing in order to meet the 
requirements of [the GDPR] and protect the rights of data 
subjects. 
	
	
Data protection by default is referred to and defined in 
Article 25(2) as follows:
	
	
The controller shall implement appropriate technical and 
organisational measures for ensuring that, by default, only 
personal data which are necessary for each specific purpose 
of the processing are processed. That obligation applies to the 
amount of personal data collected, the extent of their pro-
cessing, the period of their storage and their accessibility. In 
particular, such measures shall ensure that by default personal 
data are not made accessible without the individual’ s inter-
vention to an indefinite number of natural persons.
	
	
The concept of data protection by design and data protec-
tion by default as provided in the GDPR are predicted to soon 
impact on organizational contracts and contracting practices 
relating to data processing activities.*
•	 Certification : The new Article 25(3) provides that an approved 
certification mechanism pursuant to Article 42 may be used 
as an element to demonstrate compliance with the require-
ments set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article.
	
	
These accord with the general principle of data minimi-
zation, whereby non-personal data should be processed first, 
and where the collection and processing of personal data are 
required, it must be the minimum data as opposed to the 
*	 ibid. at 260.

55
Need for Updating Data Protection
maximum data that are so processed. This is referred to in 
Article 5(1)(c).
	
	
Individual data subjects have more control over their per-
sonal data. In the context of social networks, individual pro-
files should be kept private from others by default.*
	
	
As mentioned earlier, one of the new areas is the obligation 
to engage in data protection impact assessments. Article 35(1) 
provides that
	
	
[w]here a type of processing in particular using new tech-
nologies, and taking into account the nature, scope, context 
and purposes of the processing, is likely to result in a high risk 
to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller 
shall, prior to the processing, carry out an assessment of the 
impact of the envisaged processing operations on the protec-
tion of personal data. A single assessment may address a set of 
similar processing operations that present similar high risks.
	
	
This is particularly the case where the envisaged processing 
could give rise to specific risks.
•	 Group Claims/Class Actions : One further addition is the pos-
sibility of mass group claims or claims through representa-
tive organizations. This is referred to as “ collective redress”  
and allows data protection non-governmental organizations 
to complain both to the data protection supervisory authority 
and to the courts (see Article 80).† “ Civil procedure rules” ‡ 
may also need to be introduced.
	
	
The regime as regards cross-border data flows will be “ sig-
nificantly altered.” § These are included in Articles 40 and 41.

56
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
•	 Data Protection Supervisory Authorities : The GDPR also 
enhances and expands the various powers of the national 
authorities, such as the data protection supervisory authority.*
	
	
One of the data protection supervisory authorities’  annual 
reports notes the following:
	
	
the data protection landscape is changing. We are now 
seeing a definite shift in the nature and type of complaints 
received by the Office from the traditional complaint related 
to inappropriate or unfair use of personal data to a clearer 
technology focus with individuals concerned about the secu-
rity of their personal data and the uses made of that data by 
software and technology applications. Last year for the first 
time the number of data breach notifications outstripped 
the number of complaints opened for investigation (by six). 
The need to deal with the reality of the potential impact on 
individual …  data protection rights which can be caused by 
poorly thought out technology is in many respects the back-
drop to the [EU] Commission’ s proposals for a new uniform 
[GDPR] that will apply across all EU member states.†
•	 Free Movement : The new GDPR should not be viewed sim-
ply as merely promoting rights of individual data subjects. In 
addition, it recognizes the need for the free movement of data 
and commercial imperatives.
	
	
To ensure a consistent level of protection for natural per-
sons throughout the EU and to prevent divergences hamper-
ing the free movement of personal data within the internal 
market, a Regulation is necessary to provide legal certainty 
and transparency for economic operators, including micro, 
small, and medium-sized enterprises, and to provide natural 
persons in all member states with the same level of legally 
enforceable rights and obligations and responsibilities for 
controllers and processors, to ensure consistent monitoring 
of the processing of personal data, and equivalent sanctions 
in all member states as well as effective cooperation between 
the data protection supervisory authorities of different

member states. The proper functioning of the internal mar-
ket requires that the free movement of personal data within 
the EU is not restricted or prohibited for reasons connected 
with the protection of natural persons with regard to the 
processing of personal data. To take account of the specific 
situation of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises, 
the GDPR includes a derogation for organizations with 
fewer than 250 employees with regard to record keeping. 
In addition, the EU institutions and bodies, and member 
states and their data protection supervisory authorities, are 
encouraged to take account of the specific needs of micro, 
small, and medium-sized enterprises* in the application of 
the GDPR.†
DPD95 Repealed
Given the update to the data protection regime with the new GDPR, 
the GDPR repeals the DPD95. Processing already under way on 
the date of application of the GDPR must be brought into confor-
mity with the GDPR within the period of two  years , after which the 
GDPR enters into force. Where processing is based on consent pur-
suant to DPD95, it is not necessary for the individual data subject to 
give consent again if the way the consent has been given is in line with 
the conditions of the GDPR.‡
EU Commission decisions adopted and authorizations by data pro-
tection supervisory authorities based on DPD95 remain in force until 
amended, replaced, or repealed.§
Conclusion
Data protection compliance is never a one-size-fits-all or a single 
one-time policy document. The nature of what amounts to personal 
data and the activities for which such data can be processed are ever

changing. Those within an organization, therefore, need to be con-
stantly alert to compliance issues and changes. Organizations also 
need to be constantly alert to new issues and dangers.
All organizations need to become very familiar with the new 
GDPR. It reflects the shape of the new and expanded EU data 
protection regime. While in some instances the current compliance 
mechanisms are continued, there are many new requirements for 
compliance. Organizations need to start now in terms of ensuring 
compliance. Indeed, the most prudent organizations will continu-
ally adopt best practice, and data protection compliance is an area 
where best practice has positive benefits above and beyond mere 
compliance.
KEY CONCEPTS 
The imperative for change and update has been growing for 
some time, and the new GDPR addresses many of the devel-
oping problem issues. The implementation of these will affect 
many organizations for years to come.

EU Data Protection 
Concepts
Introduction
Everyone is concerned with personal data. Organizations are con-
cerned to know personal data for certain commercial activities 
and also in relation to their legal obligations. These obligations 
are increased with the new data protection regime under the new 
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Individuals are con-
cerned with information relating to them that is in the hands of 
third-party organizations. This can often be legitimate. However, 
there are increasing instances where it is not legitimate and infor-
mation has been collected without the individual knowing that it 
would be collected or what it would be used for. In addition, there 
are increasing instances of organizations legitimately collecting per-
sonal data relating to individuals, but which the organization then 
seeks to use in an unlawful manner; for example, a charity selling its 
database of donors to a bank or marketing company without permis-
sion or transparency.
Personal Data
What is personal information or personal data? The new GDPR 
defines personal data as any information relating to an identified or iden-
tifiable natural person  (“ data subject” ).* 
*	 Personal data in the United States are referred to as personally identifiable 
information (PII).

62
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
PERSONAL DATA 
Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural 
person (“ data subject” ); an identifiable natural person is one who 
can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference 
to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, loca-
tion data, or an online identifier or to one or more factors spe-
cific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, 
cultural, or social identity of that natural person.
This means that the net of personal data is much wider than those 
individuals for whom data are immediately transparently identified, as 
it includes not only currently identified data but also particular data 
that may become identified or linked to a living individual. An identi-
fiable person is a person who can be identified, whether directly or indi-
rectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or factors 
specific to their physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural, or 
social identity. The net is wide. The GDPR also recognizes that data 
sets are becoming easier to couple, link, and cross reference; thus, data 
that might not have identified anyone become capable of identifying 
an individual through amalgamation of different data from different 
sources. Coupling, Big Data, and so on make this an important issue.
The Parties
Data protection involves a number of key parties:
Individuals : Individuals are referred to as “ data subjects.”  It is 
their personal information and personal data that are being 
protected.
Organizations : Organizations are referred to as “ controllers”  that 
wish to collect, use, and process individuals’  personal data.
Outsource organizations : Outsource organizations are referred to 
as “ processors.”  The main controller organization has out-
sourced or delegated some of its processing activities to a third-
party organization; for example, payroll processing regarding 
employees; marketing or market research regarding customers 
or prospective customers.

63
EU Data Protection Concepts
In addition, organizations need to consider the following roles in 
relation to data protection compliance and data protection issues that 
arise:
Data protection officer : The data protection officer is the indi-
vidual office holder in the organization tasked with ensuring 
data protection compliance, education, and so on. He or she 
is the general point of contact within organizations for queries 
regarding personal data.
Board member : Organizations should ensure that data protection 
compliance is prioritized at organizational board level. The 
data protection officer should regularly report to this board 
member.
IT Manager : Given the importance of security for personal data 
enshrined in the data protection regime, the IT Manager 
needs to be appraised and involved in assisting compliance.
Data protection supervisory authority : The official agency in 
each EU member state responsible for data protection 
compliance.
European Data Protection Board : The EU body made up of rep-
resentatives of each national data protection supervisory 
authority, which investigates issues and provides guidance 
and reports on data protection issues. (Previously, the Article 
29 Data Protection Working Party [WP29] under the 1995 
data protection directive [DPD95] undertook similar tasks.)
Personal Data Use and Compliance
Appreciation of and compliance with the data protection regime in 
relation to personal data are important. Everyone has personal data 
relating to them. Every organization and entity collects and pro-
cesses personal data of individuals. Sometimes this is on a small scale. 
Sometimes it is on a massive scale. Data protection compliance obli-
gations apply to all organizations, whether small, large, commercial 
enterprises, government organizations, or even charities. Obligations 
also apply to the primary organization involved (the “ controller”  orga-
nization) as well as to outsource entities such as agents, consultants, 
processors, and so on. Arguably, the extent varies between the United 
States and the EU.

64
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
Furthermore, the instances where personal data are used are ever-
increasing. Every reservation, booking, transaction, or journey, and 
every organization that one deals with, whether governmental, enter-
prise, non-profit, or other, uses or creates data in relation to the per-
son. The volume of such personal data collection and processing is 
now even more prevalent with the advent of digitization, the Internet, 
social media, and eCommerce. Big Data, coupling, and increasing 
aggregation and linking capabilities also have implications in relation 
to personal data and what may become personal data. Commercial 
organizations realize the value in personal data. Increasingly, new 
business models are relying on personal data. Regardless, the data 
still remain the personal data of the individual data subject.*
The default position is that organizations must inform individuals 
that they intend to collect and use their personal data, and for what 
purposes, and obtain consent to do so. Frequently, tensions arise when 
organizations do not do so, or seek to do so in a manner that does not 
fully or transparently respect the rights of individuals. While com-
pliance is always possible, there are many instances of organizations 
getting it wrong and facing the consequences of audit, fine, penalty, 
prosecution, investigation, and/or litigation.
Describing Data Protection
Data protection laws protect the personal information of individuals; 
that is, the personal data of and in relation to individuals. The data 
protection regime provides a regulatory protection regime around 
personal informational and personal data. Personal data are data 
or information that relates to or identifies, directly or indirectly, an 
individual. Data protection is in many respects wider than data pro-
tection and confidentiality. Personal data is defined in the previous 
EU DPD95 and now the new GDPR. It is also an express fundamen-
tal right.
*	 On the general topic, see Rees, “ Who Owns Our Data?”  Computer Law and Security 
Report (2014) (30:1) 75. On Big Data, note, for example, Sampson, “ Rights of 
Individuation: The Need for Greater Protection of Individual Rights in Big Data,”  
2014 IEEE/ACM 7th International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing (2014).

65
EU Data Protection Concepts
The data protection legal regime governs whether, when, and how 
organizations may collect and process personal data, and, when per-
mitted, for how long.
This applies to all sorts of personal information, from general to 
highly confidential and sensitive. Examples of the latter include sensi-
tive health data, sexuality data, and details of criminal offenses.
The data protection regime is twofold in the sense of
•	 Providing obligations (both inward-facing and outward-fac-
ing) that organizations must comply with.
•	 Providing individuals (or individual data subjects, as they are 
technically known) with various data protection rights  that 
they, representative organizations, and/or the data protection 
supervisory authority can invoke or enforce, as appropriate. 
Significantly, the ability to invoke the data protection rights 
on behalf of individuals by data protection groups and collec-
tive non-governmental type organizations is new.*
Previously, organizations, as part of their compliance obligations, 
had to register or notify the data protection supervisory authority in 
relation to their data processing activities (unless exempted). This 
compliance obligation in the national data protection laws and the 
DPD95 is changed in the new GDPR. Now, there is no need for gen-
eral registration, unless they come within special categories of data 
protection risk activities (which can include frequency and volume as 
factors).†
Certain specific sections of industry and certain specific activities 
(e.g., data transfers abroad, direct marketing, etc.) also have additional 
data protection compliance rules.
In terms of individuals, they can invoke their rights directly with 
organizations; with the data protection supervisory authority; and 
also with the courts in legal proceedings. Now, particular requests 
may also be made by representative organizations on behalf of groups 
of individuals. Compensation can also be awarded. Injunction relief

can also arise.* In addition, criminal offenses can be prosecuted.† Data 
protection compliance is therefore very important. Indeed, fines and 
penalties are significantly increased under the new GDPR in the 
event of breach or non-compliance.
As regards implementing compliance frameworks, organizations 
must have defined structures, policies, and teams in place to ensure 
that they know what personal data they have and for what purposes, 
and that it is held fairly, lawfully, and in compliance with the data 
protection regime and is safely secured against damage, loss, and 
unauthorized access. A significant new measure is the obligation to 
designate a data protection officer. Data protection aims in part to 
reduce or eliminate data breach incidents, in particular in various 
security-related rule requirements.
The cost of loss, and of security breach, can be significant finan-
cially, brand-wise, and publicity-wise. An IBM study in 2015 esti-
mates the cost of data breach study as averaging $3.8  million per data 
breach incident. The TalkTalk mobile company data breach (2015) is 
estimated as costing £ 35  million. The One Target (a US retail chain) 
data breach is estimated as costing $162  million plus a 5.3% drop in 
sales. Breaches can also give rise to criminal offenses, which can be 
prosecuted. In addition, personal liability can attach to organizational 
personnel separately and in addition to the organization itself.
The Data Protection Regime
Personal data protection is enshrined in national data protection laws 
and the new GDPR.‡ The definitions, or building blocks, of data pro-
tection are referred to in this section. The GDPR significantly enhances 
the data protection regime. The new GDPR is directly effective in EU

EWHC 3410.

member states. However, it may require parts of the data protection 
rules to be amended and equivalent national laws updated.
Outward-Facing   Data Protection Compliance 
The data protection regime, as implemented in the data protection 
laws and the new GDPR, creates legal obligations organizations must 
comply with when collecting and processing the personal data of 
individuals: “ if someone can be distinguished from other people, data 
protection legislation is applicable.” * This applies to customers and 
prospective customers. Hence, these are outward-facing  obligations. 
It can also apply to non-customers, who may be using a particular 
website but are not registered customers, if their personal data is being 
collected.
Customers, and indeed users who may not be customers but whose data 
is collected by the organization, all have rights in relation to their personal 
data. These rights may be used and enforced by customers against con-
trollers. Controllers need to prepare for respecting these rights and also 
for preparing to deal with rights issues in advance of requests being made. 
Some of these are referred to later (e.g., Chapter 14).
Beyond the inward-facing employee-related sphere, organizations 
also need to consider the outward-facing sphere. For many organiza-
tions, the outward-facing data protection issues frequently seem to 
dominate more. They can also be the most contentious. These issues 
raise significant data protection concerns and compliance issues to be 
dealt with.
Some of the queries that can arise include
•	 New designated data protection officers.
•	 The forms of outward-facing personal data to consider.
•	 How organizations can comply with the data protection 
regime when dealing with existing customers.
•	 Organizations contacting potential customers yet seeking to 
remain data protection compliant.
•	 Organizations engaging in direct marketing.
*	 Costa and Poullet, “ Privacy and the Regulation of 2012,”  Computer Law & Security 
Review (2012) (28) 254, at 256.

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
•	 Whether profiling is possible generally, or even in more lim-
ited circumstances.
•	 Additional issues with users who are not customers.
•	 Security considerations arising.
•	 Whether there are even more new security issues to consider.
•	 Whether there are higher security obligations for customers 
and users.
•	 How the deletion and right to be forgotten regime work.
•	 What the new risk assessment and impact assessment provi-
sions mean.
•	 Information where data is collected from the individual data 
subject.
•	 Information provided where data is not obtained from the 
individual data subject.
•	 Right of access.
•	 Right to rectification.
•	 Right to be forgotten.
•	 Right to restriction of processing.
•	 Notification obligation regarding rectification, erasure, or 
restriction.
•	 Right to data portability.
•	 Right to object.
•	 Automated individual decision-making, including profiling.
The general increase in data, data collection capabilities, Internet 
usage, profiling, advertising, marketing, and social media is also an 
important issue to consider. Abuse, whether online or via social media or 
related websites, is increasingly recognized as a problem to be dealt with. 
There is likely to be an increase in the instances where civil sanctions and 
actions may need to be invoked. In some instances and in some jurisdic-
tions, organizations may also need to consider criminal law sanctions.
How can an organization focus on the elements that will ensure 
data protection compliance when dealing with the personal data of 
customers, prospects, and/or users? In terms of personal data collected 
and processed relating to these categories, the following must be con-
sidered and complied with
•	 Data protection principles.
•	 Legitimate processing conditions.

69
EU Data Protection Concepts
•	 Sensitive personal data legitimate processing conditions.
•	 Prior information requirements.
•	 Security requirements.
•	 Data protection impact assessments.
•	 Data protection by design and by default.
•	 Notification requirements (note potential changes in this 
regard).
•	 Risk and risk assessments, particularly as regards new pro-
cesses and activities.
•	 Security requirements.
•	 Direct marketing.
•	 Consequences of non-compliance.
•	 Users versus customers.
Particular considerations can arise in relation to users who may not 
be customers in the normal and contractual sense.
When organizations begin to look outwards, a separate range of 
data collection possibilities will arise. The avenues for data collec-
tion are more diverse. In addition, the intended uses of this type of 
personal data will be potentially more numerous. The data protec-
tion principles and legitimate processing conditions require particu-
lar consideration and configuration to the intended data processing 
activities of customers’  personal data. Different security and enforce-
ment risks can arise, and it is necessary to protect against these. It 
cannot be assumed that everyone from whom the organization may 
wish to collect personal data will be an actual customer. Therefore, 
organizations need to consider how to ensure separate consent and 
notifications to this category of person. An example of this may be 
cookies that can obtain personal data. There are significant new issues 
for organizations to consider and to comply with under the new data 
protection regime.
Inward-Facing   Data Protection Compliance 
The data protection regime applies to an organization in its dealings 
regarding the personal data of its employees. Equally, where the orga-
nization is engaging third-party independent contractors but is col-
lecting, processing, and using their personal data, the data protection 

70
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
regime will also apply. Hence, the data protection regime in relation 
to organizations is inward-facing .
This refers to employees. Organizations will also be considering 
other persons in addition to actual employees, such as employee fam-
ily members, retirees, contractors, and so on. Organizations some-
times focus on their customer-relations data compliance issues. It is 
important for new and existing organizations to look inwards. There 
are important inward-facing data protection obligations. Personal 
data include the personal data of employees also. In addition, the 
employees of the organization also have individual data subject rights 
that must be respected. Data protection compliance is also an inward-
facing requirement.
The variety of inward-facing data protection issues that organiza-
tions need to deal with on a daily basis is ever-increasing. Some of 
these include whether to allow employees to bring their own devices 
(bring your own devices [BYOD]) into the organization and whether 
to permit them to place organizational data onto such devices. If this 
is permitted, a particular BYOD policy needs to be considered and 
implemented. If employee’s own devices are not permitted, it should 
be expressly specified in a transparent manner that is permitted.
The ability for organizations to track their employees off-site is also 
a new consideration. This can include technologies on board vehicles 
as well as satellite and location technologies. It also includes the orga-
nization’ s (and employee’ s) smartphone (and other) devices.
Clearly, there are many more means by which new and/or expanded 
sets of personal data may be collected and used by an organization. 
However, it is equally necessary to consider the data protection com-
pliance issues, and which collections are permissible and which are 
not, at the earliest opportunity.
Who is covered by the inward-facing organizational data protec-
tion obligations? Organizations should be aware that while this sec-
tion refers to “ employees,”  it really includes employees and related 
parties. While full-time employees are the most obvious example, 
they are not the only ones. Organizations must consider the inward-
facing personal data of
•	 Full-time employees.
•	 Part-time employees.

71
EU Data Protection Concepts
•	 Other workers such as temps and casual staff.
•	 Agency staff.
•	 Contractors.
•	 Ex-employees.
•	 Retired employees.
•	 Job applicants, including unsuccessful applicants.
•	 Volunteers.
•	 Apprentices and trainees.
•	 Work experience staff.
•	 Suppliers.*
•	 Indirectly engaged persons, such as actors (e.g., the massive 
data breach incident related to the Sony film The Interview , 
after which the online publication of internal disparaging 
emails regarding certain actors caused significant reputational 
damage and potential lawsuits. It also cost key personnel their 
jobs).
It can also include
•	 Family members of these individuals.
Universities and schools might also consider that some or all 
inward-facing data protection issues also include
•	 Students and prospective students.
Where an organization engages with any of these categories, it will 
have to ensure that the data protection regime is complied with.
Organizations need to have actively considered data protection 
compliance issues. Compliance issues arise even before an employee 
is engaged. Data protection and personal data are gathered at recruit-
ment, selection, and interview stages. Personal data and issues of noti-
fying relevant policies are important issues for organizations to deal 
with systematically. Unless data protection issues and policy issues 
are properly incorporated into the employment relationship, the orga-
nization may be non-compliant. In addition, it may not be able to 
enforce and rely on particular contract terms, policies, employee obli-
gations, disciplinary rules, and suchlike. The advent of the new data 
*	 MacDonald, Data Protection: Legal Compliance and Good Practice for Employers 
(Tottel, 2008) 41.

72
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
protection officer obligations in relation to employee inward-facing 
issues will understandably take some bedding-in time for organi-
zations. It clearly creates a new dynamic. Organizations need to be 
aware of the data protection rights of employees.*
One of the more contentious areas of employee data protection 
issues relates to the nature of the monitoring of employee usage of 
email, Internet, and so on. This issue has also been highlighted in 
a recent controversial case. Unfortunately, there has been significant 
misreporting in relation to the case, which may cause certain organi-
zations to misunderstand the position in relation to monitoring and 
the data protection regime.†
A large number of issues arise in terms of dealing with employee 
personal data in terms of audits, planning, and compliance.‡ Note 
*	 The rights of employees include: right to transparency; right to prior information: 
directly obtained data; right to prior information: indirectly obtained data; right of 
confirmation and Right of Access; right to be informed of third-country safeguards; 
right to rectification; right to erasure (right to be forgotten) (RtbF); right to restric-
tion of processing; notifications re rectification, erasure, or restriction; right to data 
portability; right to object; rights re automated individual decision-making, includ-
ing profiling; data protection by design; security rights; data protection impact 
assessment and prior consultation; and communicating data breach to individual 
data subjects. Also note the data protection officer obligations and employee rem-
edies, liability, and sanctions.
†	 More generally, and apart from the above case, employers may not be familiar 
enough with their obligations under the data protection regime. The most common 
reason for this is that employers are concerned about certain risks that can arise as 
result of the activities of employees in the workplace. In addition, the new data pro-
tection changes are only just finalized, and organizations may not be immediately 
familiar with them.
‡	 Some examples of the legal issues and concerns that can arise for employers and 
organizations as a result of the actions of their employees include vicarious liability; 
defamation; copyright infringement; confidentiality breaches and leaks; data protec-
tion; inadvertent contract formation; discrimination; computer crime; interception 
offenses; criminal damage; data loss; data damage; computer crime; criminal dam-
age; eCommerce law; arms and dual use good export restrictions; non-fatal offenses 
against the person; child pornography; data protection policy; Internet usage pol-
icy; social media usage mobile and device usage policies; vehicle use policy; loca-
tion; evidence; enforceability; data breach; notification of employee data breaches; 
employee data organizations; employee misuse of email, Internet, and so on; online 
abuse; offline abuse; contract; employment equality; harassment; dealing with the 
employee risks; employee– corporate communications usage policies; focus of orga-
nizational communications usage policies; data protection and employee monitor-

checks on potential employees;† monitoring and employee guid-
ance‡ (see the European Court of Human Rights [ECHR] case of 
Bă rbulescu v Romania  (January 2016),§ which refers to monitoring 
in the employment context); official guidance on monitoring issues;¶ 
guidance in relation to whether an organization can access employee 
email or Internet usage;** enforced access offense (it is an offense for 
an employer to require a prospective or current employee to provide 
their police records in conjunction with applying for a job or continu-
ing to hold their job); general compliance checklists.†† The Canadian 
Supreme Court also held that employees have data protection inter-
ests in work-related activities.‡‡
A Rights-Based Regime
As well as creating legal compliance obligations for organizations, the 
data protection regime enshrines rights or data protection rights for 
individuals in terms of ensuring their ability to know what personal 
data is being collected, to consent— or not consent— to the collection 
of their personal data, and to control the uses to which their personal 
data may be put. There is also a mechanism through which individu-
als can complain to controllers holding their personal data, to the data 
protection supervisory authority, and to the courts directly. Data pro-
tection and data protection rights are fundamental legal rights.
employment processing; WP29: electronic communications; employment contracts, 
terms, policies; processing compliance rules; suggested guidelines. These are exam-
ples of an expanding list of concerns for organizations. Obviously, some of these will 
be recalibrated in importance depending on the type of organization, the business 
sector, and what its activities are. Confidentiality, for example, may be critically 
important for certain organizations, but less important for others.

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
National Data Protection Supervisory Authorities
To ensure that the duties are complied with and the rights of indi-
viduals vindicated, official data protection supervisory authorities are 
established in EU member states to monitor and act as appropriate 
in relation to the efficient operation of the data protection regime. 
The importance of EU member state data protection authorities is 
enhanced in the new GDPR.
Data Protection Rules Introduced
Controllers (i.e., the organizations that collect and process personal 
data; see definitions section) must comply with a number of data pro-
tection issues, perhaps the foremost of which relate to
•	 Fairness.
•	 Consent.
•	 Transparency.
•	 Accuracy.
•	 Security.
•	 Proper and transparent purposes for processing.
•	 Proportionality of the need and use of personal data.
•	 Risk assessments.
•	 Correction and deletion.
The collection, use, and onward transfer of personal data must 
be fair, legitimate, and transparent. There are particular definitions 
and provisions as regards the “ processing”  of personal data. There are 
also restrictions in relation to the ability of organizations to trans-
fer personal data both to third-party organizations generally and also 
to third-party organizations outside of the EU/ European Economic 
Area (EEA). Transfers were referred to as trans-border data flows 
under the old data protection regime, and are now referred to as cross-
border transfers under the new GDPR regime.
The personal data must be correct and accurate. The reason is that 
damage or harm to the individual data subject can be a consequence 
of inaccurately held personal data. For example, a credit rating could 
be adversely affected through incorrect or wrong personal data records 
being recorded regarding personal payment histories.

75
EU Data Protection Concepts
There is a general obligation in terms of safeguarding personal 
data. Organizations must assess and implement security measures to 
protect personal data. Increasingly, this is also being considered in 
relation to the developing cloud environment and the increasing use 
of processors and third parties.*
There can also be an obligation on controllers to register or notify 
the data protection supervisory authority as regards their high-risk 
data processing activities.
If EU personal data are permitted to be transferred to third coun-
tries, they must first qualify under a specific exemption, as well as the 
general security conditions. No such transfer is permitted from the 
EU unless explicitly exempted. The issue of the EU–US Safe Harbor 
Arrangement exemption mechanism is a matter of particular con-
tention and import at this time, given that the EU Court of Justice 
has invalidated this mechanism.† The EU and the US have therefore 
negotiated a new arrangement, entitled the EU–US Privacy Shield. 
The application, changes, and any challenges will need careful atten-
tion from organizations and data protection officers.
Organizations have a duty of care to individuals as regards their 
personal data being processed by the organization, particularly if 
loss or damage arises. Injunctive relief is also possible in appropriate 
circumstances.
Controllers and processors have obligations to have legal contracts 
in place between them. Processors process and deal with personal

The 
case technically related to Prism and Facebook Europe and transfers to the United 
States. However, the wider import turned out to be the entire EU-US Safe Harbor

important cases, if not the most important, decided by the Court of Justice to date.

data for and on behalf of a controller in relation to specific, defined 
tasks; for example, activities such as outsourced payroll, personnel, 
marketing, market research, customer satisfaction surveys, and so on. 
Additional issues and considerations arise for cloud services and data 
protection compliance.*
Data Protection Concepts
The previous DPD95 and the new GDPR set out a number of struc-
tures, obligations, rights, and implementing criteria that are together 
the basis of the legal data protection regime.
The main criteria and obligations to be followed, respected, and 
complied with so as to be able to legally collect and process personal 
data include
•	 The definitions of personal data and the data protection 
regime (the building blocks of data protection).
•	 The data protection principles, also known as the “ data qual-
ity principles.” 
•	 The legitimate processing conditions.
•	 The requirement that processing of personal data be “ legit-
imate”  under at least one of the legitimate processing 
conditions.
•	 Transparency and the prior information requirements.
•	 Recognition of the two categories of personal data covered 
by the data protection regime: namely, sensitive personal data 
and non-sensitive or general personal data.
•	 In the case of sensitive personal data, compliance with the 
additional sensitive personal data legitimate processing 
conditions.
•	 Ensuring that all personal data collected and processed is 
obtained fairly.
*	 From an organizational perspective, it is sometimes considered that organizational 
customers have less opportunity to negotiate clauses in cloud service provider con-
tracts, including processor and security-related issues. There is, therefore, a greater 
obligation to be satisfied with the cloud service provider, where data is located, and 
the security measures and security documentation available.

77
EU Data Protection Concepts
•	 Appropriate security measures in relation to all processing 
activities.
•	 Implementation of formal legal contracts when engaging or 
dealing with third-party processors (e.g., outsourcing data 
processing tasks or activities).
•	 Compliance with the separate criteria in relation to auto-
mated decisions.
•	 Compliance with the legal criteria for direct marketing.
•	 A duty of care exists in relation to the individual data sub-
jects whose personal data the organization is collecting and 
processing.
•	 Transfer of personal data outside of the EU is strictly con-
trolled. Personal data may not be transferred outside of the 
EU unless specifically permitted under the data protection 
regime.*
•	 Compliance with access requests, or requests by individu-
als for copies of their personal data held by the organization 
(unless excepted).
•	 Compliance with registration obligations by organizations.
•	 Implementation of internal data protection policies and terms.
•	 Implementation of outward-facing data protection policies for 
customers, etc.
•	 Implementation of outward-facing website data protection 
statements (generally, a data protection policy covers organiza-
tion-wide activities. A website data protection statement† gov-
erns only the online collection and processing of personal data).
•	 Implementation of device, mobile, computer, and Internet 
usage policies.
•	 Implementation of data loss, data breach, incident handling, 
and incident reporting policies and associated reaction plans.‡ 
*	 The EEA is wider than the EU member states and includes Iceland,  Liechtenstein,  
and  Norway. Switzerland has  a similar arrangement with the EU. EU data protec-
tion law frequently refers to the EEA, generally meaning the EU member states plus 
the EEA countries.
†	 Also known as a privacy statement.
‡	 Note, for example, the UK data protection supervisory authority (ICO) 
PECR (privacy and electronic communications regulations) security breach 
notifications— guidance for service providers, at https://ico.org.uk.

78
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
•	 Reporting of data incidents, losses, and breaches to the data 
protection supervisory authority (unless exempted).
•	 Keeping abreast of the increasing trend toward sector/issue 
specific rules, for example spam; direct marketing.
•	 Industry codes of conduct* in relation to personal data.
•	 Children and personal data issues.
•	 Children, consent, and social media.
•	 Data protection impact assessments and privacy consultations.
•	 Data protection by design and by default.
•	 Compliance with new legal developments.
General Criteria for Data Processing
Generally, to lawfully collect and process personal data, an organiza-
tion should be aware that
•	 The individual data subject must consent to the collection and 
processing of their personal data.
•	 The data subject may object to processing or continued 
processing.
•	 Legal data protection requirements must be complied with.
•	 The prior information requirements, transparency, data pro-
tection principles, legitimate processing conditions, sensitive 
personal data legitimate processing conditions (in the case 
of sensitive personal data), and security obligations must be 
complied with.
•	 and so on; risk assessment; risk minimization; data protection 
by design; and data protection by default.
The interests of the controller can sometimes be relevant in par-
ticular instances in deciding what data processing is necessary and 
permitted.
*	 The EU national data protection laws and the EU data protection regime provide for 
codes of conduct being agreed with national data protection authorities in relation 
to specific industry sectors.

79
EU Data Protection Concepts
Legitimate Processing
There is a prohibition on the collection and processing of personal 
data and sensitive personal data unless
•	 The processing complies with the data protection principles.
•	 The processing comes with one of a limited number of speci-
fied conditions (the legitimate processing conditions or sen-
sitive personal data legitimate processing conditions, as 
appropriate).
•	 The processing also complies with the security requirements.
Definitions
The data protection rules and new GDPR contain a number of key 
definitions. These are central to understanding the data protection 
regime and complying with it. These are essentially the building 
blocks of the data protection regime. While these can be “ complex 
concepts,” * organizations need to fully understand them. Some exam-
ples of the matters defined include
•	 Individual data subject.
•	 Controller.
•	 Processor.
•	 Personal data.
•	 Processing.
•	 Sensitive personal data.
The definitions are found in greater detail later (e.g., Chapter 8).

The Instruments
Introduction
What are the legal instruments of data protection? Primarily, they are 
the national data protection laws, the new General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR) and the previous 1995 data protection directive 
(DPD95).
Data Protection Laws 
The national data protection laws implement the provisions of the 
DPD95 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing 
of personal data and on the free movement of such data. The DPD95 
applies data protection to EU, and indirectly to EEA, member states.
The data protection laws have important implications for busi-
nesses and organizations that collect, process, and deal in information 
relating to living individuals— in particular, customers and employ-
ees. They contain stringent data protection measures to safeguard 
personal and informational privacy and to ensure that personal data 
are not misused or used for purposes that are incompatible with data 
protection legislation.
Legal Instruments
The introductions or Recitals to the European legal rules are not 
legally binding, unlike the main legal text-related Article provisions. 
However, the Recitals are still very influential in terms of interpreting 
the focus of the data protection rules, and they also highlight some

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
General Provisions in the DPD95
The DPD95 provides the overarching framework for data protection 
in the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA). The Directive 
provides the data protection principles, legitimate processing condi-
tions, security requirements, individual data subject rights, fair col-
lection and processing, and restriction of trans-border data flows or 
transfers of personal data and sensitive personal data. The DPD95 at 
a headline level also provides for
•	 Privacy and data protection
•	 Harmonization of such measures throughout the EU
Some of the pertinent background Recitals to the DPD95 
include the following themes, which are also illustrative of the 
aims and intentions of the DPD95: harmonization;* privacy/data 
protection/fundamental 
rights/sectors;† 
technology/increased 
processing;‡ barriers;§ automated processing;¶ member states/
jurisdiction;** third-party controllers and EU data subjects;†† 
balance;‡‡ security and technical security;§§ access right to personal 
data;¶¶ right to object to processing;*** security;††† transmission;‡‡‡ spe-
cific processing risks;§§§ court and judicial remedy;¶¶¶ trans-border 
data flows;**** and consent.††††

The Instruments
Chapter  I of DPD95 contains the general legal provisions of the 
Directive. Article 1 refers to the object of the Directive. In particular, 
Article 1(1) states that member states must protect the fundamental 
rights of natural persons and in particular their right to data pro-
tection with respect to the processing of personal data. Article 1(2) 
provides that member states must neither restrict nor prohibit the free 
flow of personal data between member states for reasons connected 
with the protection afforded.
General Provisions in the GDPR
Chapter  I of the new GDPR contains the general provisions. Article 
1 refers to the subject matter and objectives. Particularly, it states that 
the GDPR lays down rules relating to the protection of natural per-
sons with regard to the processing of personal data and rules relating 
to the free movement of personal data.
It states that the GDPR protects fundamental rights of natural per-
sons and in particular their right to the protection of personal data. 
The free movement of personal data within the EU must be neither 
restricted nor prohibited for reasons connected with the protection of 
natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data.
Article 2 relates to material scope. The GDPR applies to the pro-
cessing of personal data wholly or partly by automated means and to 
the processing other than by automated means of personal data that 
form part of a filing system or are intended to form part of a filing 
system. However, it makes clear that the GDPR does not apply to the 
processing of personal data
•	 In the course of an activity that falls outside the scope of EU 
law.
•	 By the member states when carrying out activities that fall 
within the scope of Chapter  2 of Title V of the EU Treaty.
•	 By a natural person in the course of a purely personal or 
household activity.
•	 By competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, 
investigation, detection, or prosecution of criminal offenses or 
the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguard-
ing against and the prevention of threats to public security.

86
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
In addition, the GDPR is without prejudice to the application of 
the eCommerce Directive,* in particular of limited liability defense 
rules for internet service providers (ISPs) of caching, hosting, and 
mere conduit.†
Article 3 relates to territorial scope. The GDPR applies to the pro-
cessing of personal data in the context of the activities of an establish-
ment of a controller or a processor in the EU, regardless of whether 
the processing takes place in the EU or not.
Further, the GDPR applies to the processing of personal data of 
individual data subjects who are in the EU by a controller or processor 
not established in the EU, where the processing activities are related 
to (a) the offering of goods or services, irrespective of whether a pay-
ment of the individual data subject is required, to such individual data 
subjects in the EU; or (b) the monitoring of their behavior as far as 
their behavior takes place within the EU.
The GDPR applies to the processing of personal data by a control-
ler not established in the EU, but in a place where member state law 
applies by virtue of public international law.
Data Protection Principles
Chapter  II of the GDPR refers to the data protection principles. 
Article 5 relates to principles relating to personal data processing. 
Personal data must be
•	 Processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner in rela-
tion to the individual data subject (“ lawfulness, fairness and 
transparency” ).
•	 Collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and 
not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with 
*	 Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 8, 
2000 on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular electronic 
commerce, in the Internal Market (Directive on eCommerce). Article 12 relates to 
mere conduit; Article 13 relates to caching; and Article 14 relates to hosting. Note 
also UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce; “ UNCITRAL model 
law on electronic commerce,”  Tulane Journal of International and Comparative Law 
(1999) (7) 237– 250.

providers (ISPs) are set out in Articles 12 to 15 of the eCommerce Directive.

The Instruments
those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in 
the public interest, for scientific or historical research pur-
poses, or for statistical purposes must, in accordance with 
Article 89(1), not be considered to be incompatible with the 
initial purposes (“ purpose limitation” ).
•	 Adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in rela-
tion to the purposes for which they are processed (“ data 
minimization” ).
•	 Accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every rea-
sonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that 
are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which 
they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay 
(“ accuracy” ).
•	 Kept in a form that permits identification of individual data 
subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for 
which the personal data are processed; personal data may 
be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data 
will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public 
interest, for scientific or historical research purposes, or for 
statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) subject 
to implementation of the appropriate technical and organi-
zational measures required by the GDPR to safeguard the 
rights and freedoms of the individual data subject (“ storage 
limitation” ).
•	 Processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of 
the personal data, including protection against unauthorized 
or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruc-
tion, or damage, using appropriate technical or organizational 
measures (“ integrity and confidentiality” ).
The controller must be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate 
compliance with, these principles (“ accountability” ). This will obvi-
ously require records and proofs of compliance to be kept.*
*	 The DPD95 also provided for the data protection principles. See DPD95 Article 6(2).

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
Legitimate Data Processing Conditions for Lawfulness of Processing
Article 6 of the GDPR refers to the lawfulness of processing. 
Processing must be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of 
the following applies
	
1.	The individual data subject has given consent to the process-
ing of their personal data for one or more specific purposes.
	
2.	Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to 
which the individual data subject is party or to take steps at 
the request of the individual data subject prior to entering into 
a contract.
	
3.	Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation 
to which the controller is subject.
	
4.	Processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the 
individual data subject or of another natural person.
	
5.	Processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried 
out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority 
vested in the controller.
	
6.	Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate 
interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except 
where such interests are overridden by the interests or fun-
damental rights of the individual data subject, which require 
protection of personal data, in particular where the individual 
data subject is a child.*
The purpose of the processing must be determined in that legal 
basis or, as regards the processing referred to in paragraph 1(e), must 
be necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public 
interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. 
That legal basis may contain specific provisions to adapt the applica-
tion of rules of the GDPR, inter alia : the general conditions governing 
the lawfulness of processing by the controller; the types of data that 
are subject to the processing; the individual data subjects concerned; 
the entities to, and the purposes for which, the personal data may 
be disclosed; the purpose limitation; storage periods; and processing 
operations and processing procedures, including measures to ensure 
*	 2. Section  II of the DPD95 referred to the criteria for making data processing 
legitimate.

The Instruments
lawful and fair processing such as those for other specific processing 
situations.* The EU or the member state law must meet an objective 
of public interest and be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.
Where the processing for a purpose other than that for which 
the personal data have been collected is not based on the individual 
data subject’ s consent or on an EU or member state law that consti-
tutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society 
to safeguard the societal objectives,† the controller must, to ascer-
tain whether processing for another purpose is compatible with the 
purpose for which the personal data are initially collected, take into 
account, inter alia 
•	 Any link between the purposes for which the personal data 
have been collected and the purposes of the intended further 
processing.
•	 The context in which the personal data have been collected, in 
particular regarding the relationship between individual data 
subjects and the controller.
•	 The nature of the personal data, in particular whether special 
categories of personal data are processed,‡ or whether personal 
data related to criminal convictions and offenses are processed.§
•	 The possible consequences of the intended further processing 
for individual data subjects.
•	 The existence of appropriate safeguards, which may include 
encryption or pseudonymization.

Consent Conditions
Article 7 of the GDPR relates to the conditions for consent. Where 
processing is based on consent, the controller must be able to demon-
strate that the individual data subject has consented to processing of 
their personal data.
If the individual data subject’ s consent is given in the context of a 
written declaration that also concerns other matters, the request for 
consent must be presented in a manner that is clearly distinguishable 
from the other matters, in an intelligible and easily accessible form, 
using clear and plain language. Any part of such a declaration that 
constitutes an infringement of the GDPR must not be binding.
Freely Given Consent

must be taken of whether, inter alia , the performance of a contract, 
including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the

processing of personal data that is not necessary for the performance of 
that contract. It is unclear what interpretation will be given to “ freely 
given”  and “ utmost account.”  Obviously, other factors may also be rel-
evant. There may be some contention as to what is and is not actually 
“ necessary.”  Quite often, also, consent may be conditional in practical 
terms, but may not be expressly specified as being conditional. It is 
also worth noting that the EU Commission original proposed version 
stated that consent must not provide a legal basis for processing where 
there is a significant imbalance between the position of the individual 
data subject and that of the controller.*
Consent for Processing: Conditions for Consent 
Consent is an important issue under the new GDPR.† Lawful pro-
cessing and consent are referred to in Recital 39. The WP29 also 
refers to consent issues.‡
Article 7 of the GDPR refers to conditions for consent as follows. 
Where processing is based on consent, the controller must be able to 
demonstrate that consent was given by the individual data subject to 
the processing of their personal data.§
If the individual data subject’ s consent is given in the context of a 
written declaration that also concerns other matters, the request for 
consent must be presented in a manner that is clearly distinguishable 
from the other matters, in an intelligible and easily accessible form, 
using clear and plain language. Any part of the declaration that con-
stitutes an infringement of the GDPR must not be binding.¶
The individual data subject must have the right to withdraw their 
consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent must not affect the 
lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
Prior to giving consent, the individual data subject must be informed 
thereof. It must be as easy to withdraw consent as to give consent.*
When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account 
must be taken of whether, among other things, the performance of a 
contract, including the provision of a service, is made conditional on 
the consent to the processing of personal data that is not necessary for 
the performance of this contract.† 
Withdrawing Consent
The individual data subject must have the right to withdraw their con-
sent at any time. However, the withdrawal of consent must not affect 
the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. 
Prior to giving consent, the individual data subject must be informed 
thereof. It must be as easy to withdraw as to give consent.
Conclusion
Data protection is evolving as technology changes how personal data 
are collected, used, and processed. The current data protection legal 
regime is viewed as requiring updating. The DPD95 was enacted in 
1995, prior to social media, cloud computing, mass data storage, data 
mining, electronic profiling, Web 2.0, and the threats to the secu-
rity surrounding personal data. Data protection needs to evolve to 
deal with these issues. This is partly the reason for the GDPR. This 
is important for the issues it addresses as well as the current legal 
provisions it will enhance. As a legal regulation, as opposed to a 
legal directive, it means that it is directly applicable in EU member 
states without the need for a directive or member state implementing 
legislation. Law and practice will be changed, as will many of the 
obligations of organizations. This will also differ more for organiza-
tions in particular sectors. Areas that are being highlighted include 
better awareness and more hands-on board management responsi-
bility, planning, and data protection assessment, and including risk 
assessment, data protection impact assessments, risk consultations, in

The New Rules
Introduction
The EU data protection regime is being fundamentally updated and 
expanded.* Many things have changed since the introduction of the 
1995 data protection directive (DPD95). Data processing activities 
have changed as well as increased in scale and complexity. The EU 
undertook a review of the current effectiveness of the data protection 
regime. Partly on the foot of the review, the EU Commission proposed 
a new legal update to the data protection regime. This culminated 
in the proposals for the new General Data Protection Regulation 
(GDPR). Indeed, the Council of Europe is also proposing to update 
the Data Protection Convention.† The Article 29 Data Protection 
Working Party (WP29) also refers to the need for future data pro-
tection measures in The Future of Privacy .‡ There have also been calls 
for greater political activism in relation to particular data protection 
issues.§ Others¶ have also highlighted new problematic developments 
in relation to such issues as location data and location-based services,

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
which need to be dealt with. Online and offline abuse issues are yet 
other matters needing to be addressed.
The new processing rules as set out in the new GDPR regime are 
listed here.*
Detailed core rules, known as the principles or data protection 
principles, must be complied with. These refer to
•	 Prior information requirements.
•	 Lawfulness, fairness, and transparency.
•	 Purpose limitation.
•	 Data minimization.
•	 Accuracy.
•	 Storage limitation.
•	 Integrity and confidentiality.
•	 Accountability.
There are also detailed rules relating to
•	 Lawfulness of processing and legitimate processing conditions.
•	 Consent for processing and conditions for consent.
Repeal of DPD95
The DPD of 1995 is repealed with effect from May 25, 2018 (Article 
94(1)). References to the repealed DPD95 will be construed as refer-
ences to the GDPR (Article 94(2)).
Context of GDPR
The initial provisions refer to the context of the GDPR: namely, the 
subject matter and objectives (Article 1); material scope (Article 2); 
and territorial scope (Article 3).
*	 The Recitals refer to the following: data processing must be lawful and fair (Recitals 
10, 39); processing necessary for a contract (Recital 40); processing for a legal obli-
gation (Recital 40); processing necessary to protect life (Recital 46); the legitimate 
interests of the controller (Recital 47).

101
THE NEW RULES
Fundamental Right
Personal data protection is now recognized as a fundamental legal right 
for individuals in the new GDPR and the EU Charter of Fundamental 
Rights of 2000, the Lisbon Treaty (Treaty on the Functioning of the 
European Union), and the Data Protection Convention.
EU CHARTER 
Article 8(1)
Protection of Personal Data
Everyone has the right to the protection of personal data con-
cerning them.
EU LISBON TREATY 
Article 16(1)
Everyone has the right to the protection of personal data con-
cerning them.
Formal Nature of Regulations and Directives
The GDPR is now agreed, and organizations will, in some instances, 
have two years to fully comply with the new data protection regime. 
However, it is important to note that an EU Regulation differs 
from a Directive under formal EU law.*  A Regulation is immedi-
ately directly effective in all EU member states, without the need for 
member states implementing laws. Once the Regulation is passed, it 
will apply throughout the EU. It will also change the data protection 
regime in Europe and beyond. The reform is “ comprehensive.” †
*	 Generally see, for example, Biondi and Eeckhout (eds), EU Law after Lisbon 
(Oxford University Press, 2012); Foster, Foster on EU Law (Oxford University Press, 
2011); O’ Neill, EU Law for UK Lawyers (Hart, 2011); Steiner and Woods, EU Law 
(Oxford University Press, 2011).

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
Processing of Criminal Convictions and Offenses Data
Article 10 refers to processing of data relating to criminal convictions 
and offenses. The processing of personal data relating to criminal con-
victions and offenses or related security measures based on Article 
6(1) must be carried out only under the control of official author-
ity or when the processing is authorized by EU or member state law 
providing for appropriate safeguards for the rights of data subjects. 
Any comprehensive register of criminal convictions must be kept only 
under the control of official authority.
Processing Not Requiring Identification
Article 11 refers to processing not requiring identification. If the pur-
poses for which a controller processes personal data do not or do no 
longer require the identification of a data subject by the controller, the 
controller must not be obliged to maintain, acquire, or process addi-
tional information to identify the data subject for the sole purpose of 
complying with the GDPR.*
Where, in cases referred to in the preceding paragraph, the con-
troller is able to demonstrate that it is not in a position to identify the 
data subject, the controller must inform the data subject accordingly, 
if possible. In such cases, Articles 15– 20 must not apply except where 
the data subject, for the purpose of exercising their rights under those 
articles, provides additional information enabling their identification.†
Controllers and Processors
Chapter  IV of the GDPR refers to controllers and processors. 
Chapter  IV, Section  1 refers to general obligations. The WP29 also 
refers to controller and processor issues.‡ Article 24 refers to the 
responsibility of the controller.
*	 GDPR Article 11(1).
†	 GDPR Article 11(2).
‡	 WP29 Opinion 1/2010 on the concepts of “ controller”  and “ processor.” 

105
THE NEW RULES
Responsibility of the Controller
Taking into account the nature, scope, context, and purposes of pro-
cessing as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the 
rights of natural persons, the controller must implement appropriate 
technical and organizational measures to ensure and to be able to dem-
onstrate that processing is performed in accordance with the GDPR. 
Those measures must be reviewed and updated where necessary.*
Where proportionate in relation to processing activities, these mea-
sures must include the implementation of appropriate data protection 
policies by the controller.†
Adherence to approved codes of conduct‡ or approved certification 
mechanisms§ may be used as an element by which to demonstrate 
compliance with the obligations of the controller.¶
Joint Controllers
Where two or more controllers jointly determine the purposes and 
means of processing, they will be joint controllers. They must in a 
transparent manner determine their respective responsibilities for 
compliance with the obligations under the GDPR, in particular as 
regards the exercising of the rights of the data subject and their respec-
tive duties to provide the information required by the prior informa-
tion requirements (referred to in Articles 13 and 14), by means of an 
arrangement between them unless the respective responsibilities of 
the controllers are determined by EU or member state law to which 
the controllers are subject. The arrangement may designate a contact 
point for data subjects.**
This arrangement must duly reflect the respective roles and relation-
ships of the joint controllers vis-à -vis  the data subjects. The essence of 
the arrangement must be made available to the data subject.††
*	 GDPR Article 24(1).
†	 GDPR Article 24(2).
‡	 As referred to in GDPR Article 40. 
§	 As referred to in GDPR Article 42.
¶	 GDPR Article 24(3).
**	GDPR Article 26(1).
††	GDPR Article 26(2).

106
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
Irrespective of the terms of the arrangement, the data subject may 
exercise their rights under the GDPR in respect of and against each 
of the controllers.*
Processor
Organizations that are processors also should appreciate that while 
they may indeed be processors, they can also at the same time be con-
trollers in relation to different sets of personal data.
Processing under Authority of Controller and Processor
The processor, and any person acting under the authority of the con-
troller or of the processor who has access to personal data, must not 
process those data except on instructions from the controller, unless 
required to do so by EU or member state law.†
Processing Not Allowing Identification
Article 10 refers to processing not allowing identification, and pro-
vides that if the purposes for which a controller processes personal 
data do not or do no longer require the identification of an individual 
data subject by the controller, the controller must not be obliged to 
maintain, acquire, or process additional information to identify the 
individual data subject for the sole purpose of complying with the 
GDPR.
Exemptions
In considering compliance obligation, it is also important to consider 
the exemptions that may apply.‡ The new GDPR Recitals refer to 
*	 GDPR Article 26(3). Generally see Mä kinen, “ Data Quality, Sensitive Data and 
Joint Controllership as Examples of Grey Areas in the Existing Data Protection 
Framework for the Internet of Things,”  Information & Communications Technology 
Law (2015) (24:3) 262.
†	 GDPR Article 29.
‡	 Provided for in Articles 6(1), 10, 11(1), 12 and 21.

107
THE NEW RULES
exemption issues: the GDPR does not address national security;* the 
GDPR should not apply to data processing by a natural person in the 
course of a purely personal or household activity and thus without a 
connection with a professional or commercial activity;† the GDPR is 
without prejudice to the eCommerce Directive,‡ in particular eCom-
merce defenses of Articles 12– 15;§ the GDPR does not apply to the 
data of the deceased.¶ One of the most important exemptions is per-
haps that the GDPR applies to the personal data of living individuals, 
thus excluding data of deceased persons and organizations.
The GDPR does not apply to the processing of personal data
•	 In the course of an activity that falls outside the scope of EU 
law.
•	 By the member states when carrying out activities that fall 
within the scope of Chapter  2 of Title V of the Treaty on 
European Union.
•	 By a natural person in the course of a purely personal or 
household activity.
•	 By competent authorities for the purposes of prevention, 
investigation, detection, or prosecution of criminal offenses or 
the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguard-
ing against and the prevention of threats to public security.**
For the processing of personal data by the EU institutions, bodies, 
offices, and agencies, a different Regulation applies. Regulation (EC) 
No 45/2001 and other EU legal instruments applicable to such pro-
cessing of personal data must be adapted to the principles and rules 
of the GDPR.††

108
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
The GDPR is without prejudice to the application of the eCom-
merce Directive, in particular of the liability rules of intermediary 
service providers in Articles 12– 15 of the eCommerce Directive.*
Certain exemptions can be enacted nationally, particularly pro-
cessing of personal data carried out for journalistic purposes or the 
purpose of academic artistic or literary expression, if necessary.† It 
remains to be seen whether this will occur.
Conclusion
The exemptions are important when and where they are applicable. 
They will often be more relevant to particular sectors. Generally, the 
exemptions appear to be less litigated than other areas of data protec-
tion. Particular organizations will also need to consider any national 
amending measures that may also occur.

KEY CONCEPTS 
The previous DPD95 is being repealed and replaced by the 
GDPR. The new rules are significant for all individuals and 
organizations to consider. Those who must comply must over-
haul their compliance frameworks. Individuals have important 
new rights to aid them in enforcing and protecting their per-
sonal data, enhancing the fundamental right to personal data 
and data protection.

Definitions
Introduction
What are the definitions central to data protection? It is critical to 
understanding the data protection regime to know and appreciate the 
definitions of the key terms that underpin the legal measures imple-
menting the data protection regime. The definitions are the build-
ing blocks for the data protection regime. They are contained in the 
data protection laws, the DPD95 and now the new GDPR. The new 
definitions in the GDPR should be considered in particular, as these 
expand and enhance the EU data protection legal regime. The GDPR 
will be the central EU data protection legal measure for many years 
to come. The various categories and definitions are referred to in this 
chapter.
Categories of Personal Data
Organizations need to be familiar with two separate categories of per-
sonal data in relation to their data protection actions and compliance 
obligations. These also affect what personal data they may collect in 
the first instance. The categories of personal data are general personal 
data  and sensitive personal data . (Note: in the United States, personal 
data are often generally referred to as personally identifiable informa-
tion [PII].)
The first general category is general personal data. The second gen-
eral category is sensitive personal data. The importance of sensitive 
personal data is that they trigger additional and more onerous obliga-
tions of compliance and initial collection conditions. Unless they fall 
within the definition of sensitive personal data, all personal data fall 
into the general personal data category.
Why is there a distinction? Certain types of personal data are 
more important and sensitive to individuals than other categories 

112
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
of personal data. This is recognized in the data protection regime. 
Additional rules are put in place. First, sensitive personal data are 
defined differently. Second, to collect and process sensitive personal 
data, an organization must satisfy additional processing conditions, in 
addition to the data protection principles and the general legitimate 
processing conditions; namely, it must comply with the sensitive per-
sonal data legitimate processing conditions.
General   Personal Data 
(General) personal data are data relating to a living individual who is 
(or can be) identified either from the data or from the data in conjunc-
tion with other information that is in, or is likely to come into, the 
possession of the controller.* 
Sensitive   Personal Data 
Sensitive personal data contain higher compliance obligations and 
conditions. Sensitive personal data are personal data relating to any of 
the following: (a) racial or ethnic origin; (b) political opinions; (c) reli-
gious or philosophical beliefs;  (d) trade union membership; (e) physi-
cal or mental health or condition or sexual life; (f) the commission 
or alleged commission of any offense; or  (g) any proceedings for an 
offense committed or alleged to have been committed, the disposal of 
such proceedings or the sentence of any court in such proceedings, by 
the individual data subject.
This can be summarized as personal data relating to
•	 Racial or ethnic origin.
•	 Political opinions.
•	 Religious or philosophical beliefs.
•	 Trade union membership.
*	 However, there are calls to ensure that some or all data protection rights and pro-
tections are extended to entities other than just individuals. Indeed, organizations 
have certain rights under the data protection regime as regards electronic and related 
commercial communications (e.g., anti‑spam rights). Generally see, for example, 
van der Sloot, “ Do Privacy and Data Protection Rules Apply to Legal Persons and 
Should They? A Proposal for a Two-Tiered System,”  Computer Law and Security 
Review (2015) (31:1) 26.

113
DEFINITIONS
•	 Physical or mental health or condition or sexual life.
•	 Commission of offense.
•	 Proceedings for an offense.
Article 8 of the DPD95 refers to the processing of special catego-
ries of data. It states that member states must prohibit the processing 
of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, 
religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the 
processing of data concerning health or sex life.*
Article 9 of the GDPR relates to the processing of special catego-
ries of personal data. The processing of personal data revealing racial 
or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, 
or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, bio-
metric data to uniquely identify a person, or data concerning health 
or sex life and sexual orientation must be prohibited.† Article 9(2) of 
the GDPR provides that the processing prohibitions above must not 
apply where
•	 The individual data subject has given explicit consent to the 
processing of those personal data for one or more specified 
purposes, except where EU law or member state law provides 
that the prohibition referred to above may not be lifted by the 
individual data subject; or
•	 Processing is necessary for the purposes of carrying out the 
obligations and exercising specific rights of the controller or 
of the individual data subject in the field of employment and 
social security and social protection law insofar as it is autho-
rized by EU law or member state law or a collective agree-
ment pursuant to member state law providing for adequate 
safeguards for the fundamental rights and the interests of the 
individual data subject; or
•	 Processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the indi-
vidual data subject or of another person where the individual 
*	 Member states shall determine the conditions under which a national identification 
number or any other identifier of general application may be processed; DPD95 
Article 8.

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
data subject is physically or legally incapable of giving con-
sent; or
•	 Processing is carried out in the course of its legitimate activi-
ties with appropriate safeguards by a foundation, associa-
tion, or any other non-profit-seeking body with a political, 
philosophical, religious, or trade union aim and on condition 
that the processing relates solely to the members or to former 
members of the body or to persons who have regular contact 
with it in connection with its purposes and that the data are 
not disclosed outside that body without the consent of the 
individual data subjects; or
•	 Processing relates to personal data that are manifestly made 
public by the individual data subject; or
•	 Processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise, or 
defense of legal claims or whenever courts are acting in their 
judicial capacity; or
•	 Processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public inter-
est, on the basis of EU or member state law, which must be 
proportionate to the aim pursued, respect the essence of the 
right to data protection, and provide for suitable and specific 
measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the inter-
ests of the individual data subject; or
•	 Processing is necessary for the purposes of preventive or occu-
pational medicine, for the assessment of the working capacity 
of the employee, medical diagnosis, the provision of health or 
social care or treatment or the management of health or social 
care systems and services on the basis of EU law or member 
state law or pursuant to contract with a health professional 
and subject to the conditions and safeguards referred to in 
Article 9(4) [Article 9(2)(h)]; or
•	 Processing is necessary for reasons of public interest in the 
area of public health, such as protecting against serious cross-
border threats to health or ensuring high standards of quality 
and safety of health care and of medicinal products or medi-
cal devices, on the basis of EU law or member state law that 
provides for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the 
rights of the individual data subject, in particular professional 
secrecy; or

115
DEFINITIONS
•	 Processing is necessary for archiving purposes in the public 
interest or scientific and historical research purposes or statis-
tical purposes in accordance with Article 83(1) based on EU 
or member state law, which must be proportionate to the aim 
pursued, respect the essence of the right to data protection, 
and provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard 
the fundamental rights and the interests of the individual data 
subject.
Personal data referred to in Article 9(1) may be processed for the 
purposes referred to in Article 9(2)(h) when those data are processed 
by or under the responsibility of a professional subject to the obliga-
tion of professional secrecy under EU or member state law or rules 
established by national competent bodies or by another person also 
subject to an obligation of secrecy under EU or member state law or 
rules established by national competent bodies.
Member states remain free to maintain or introduce further condi-
tions, including limitations, with regard to the processing of genetic 
data, biometric data, or health data.*
Data Protection Definitions
There are various definitions in relation to personal data. These are 
the building blocks of the data protection regime and the respective 
obligations and rights as regards organizations and individuals.
New Definitions in GDPR
The GDPR introduces certain new definitions, such as the following.
Restriction of Processing
“ Restriction of processing”  means the marking of stored personal data 
with the aim of limiting their processing in the future.

dict aspects concerning that natural person’ s performance at work, 
economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, 
behavior, location, or movements.
Pseudonymization
“ Pseudonymization”  means the processing of personal data in such a 
manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific 
data subject without the use of additional information, provided that 
such additional information is kept separately and is subject to techni-
cal and organizational measures to ensure that the personal data are 
not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.
Personal Data Breach
“ Personal data breach”  means a breach of security leading to the acci-
dental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, or unauthorized dis-
closure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored, or otherwise 
processed.
Genetic Data

scopic data.
Data Concerning Health
“ Data concerning health”  means personal data related to the physi-
cal or mental health of a natural person, including the provision of 
health care services, which reveal information about their health 
status.
Main Establishment
“ Main establishment”  as regards a controller with establishments in 
more than one member state, the place of its central administration 
in the EU, unless the decisions on the purposes and means of the 
processing of personal data are taken in another establishment of the 
controller in the EU and the latter establishment has the power to 
have such decisions implemented, in which case the establishment 
having taken such decisions is to be considered to be the main estab-
lishment; and as regards a processor with establishments in more than 
one member state, the place of its central administration in the EU, 
or, if the processor has no central administration in the EU, the estab-
lishment of the processor in the EU where the main processing activi-
ties in the context of the activities of an establishment of the processor 
take place to the extent that the processor is subject to specific obliga-
tions under the GDPR.
Enterprise
“ Enterprise”  means a natural or legal person engaged in an economic 
activity, irrespective of its legal form, including partnerships or asso-

of the member state of that data protection supervisory 
authority.
•	 Individual data subjects residing in the member state of that 
data protection supervisory authority are substantially affected 
or likely to be substantially affected by the processing.
or
•	 A complaint has been lodged with that data protection super-
visory authority.
Data Protection Supervisory Authority
Article 4 of the GDPR sets out the following definition of data pro-
tection “ supervisory authority” : an independent public authority that 
is established by a member state. This emphasizes the independence 
necessary for national data protection supervisory authorities.

119
DEFINITIONS
Cross-Border Processing of Personal Data
“ Cross-border processing of personal data”  means either
•	 Processing of personal data that takes place in the context 
of the activities of establishments in more than one member

“ Relevant and reasoned objection”  means an objection to a draft deci-
sion as to whether there is an infringement of the GDPR or whether 
envisaged action in relation to the controller or processor complies 
with the GDPR, which clearly demonstrates the significance of the 
risks posed by the draft decision as regards the fundamental rights of 
individual data subjects and, where applicable, the free flow of per-
sonal data within the EU.
Information Society Service
“ Information Society service”  means a service as defined in point (b) of 
Article 1(1) of Directive (EU) 2015/1535 of the European Parliament 
and of the Council.
International Organization
“ International organization”  means an organization and its subordi-
nate bodies governed by public international law, or any other body 
that is set up by, or on the basis of, an agreement between two or more 
countries.

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
Child
The original EU Commission proposed version for the GDPR defines 
“ child”  as any person below the age of 18  years. This is not contained 
in the agreed version of December 2015. The final version in Article 8 
refers to a child in relation to the offer of information society services 
directly to a child; the processing of the personal data of a child will 
be lawful where the child is at least 16  years old. (Note final provi-
sions below specifically relating to children and online services.)
Updated Definitions in the GDPR
The GDPR introduces certain updated and enhanced definitions from 
those in the DPD95, referred to as follows.
Personal Data
“ Personal data”  means any information relating to an identified or 
identifiable natural person (“ data subject” ); an identifiable natural 
person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in par-
ticular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification 
number, location data, or an online identifier or to one or more fac-
tors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, 
cultural, or social identity of that natural person.*
Sensitive Personal Data
The new GDPR refers to processing of special categories of personal 
data. It refers to personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, politi-
cal opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union mem-
bership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the 
purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning 
*	 The DPD95 provided the following definition of “ personal data” : any information 
relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“ data subject” ). An identifi-
able person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by refer-
ence to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to their physical, 
physiological, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity.

121
DEFINITIONS
health, or data concerning a natural person’ s sex life or sexual orienta-
tion, the processing of which is prohibited.
Background Guidance
Sensitive personal data are referred to in Recitals 10 and 51, and spe-
cial categories of personal data are referred to in Recitals 10, 51 and 
52.
Personal data that are, by their nature, particularly sensitive in rela-
tion to fundamental rights merit specific protection, as the context 
of their processing could create significant risks to the fundamen-
tal rights. Those personal data should include personal data revealing 
racial or ethnic origin, whereby the use of the term “ racial origin”  in 
the GDPR does not imply an acceptance by the EU of theories that 
attempt to determine the existence of separate human races. The pro-
cessing of photographs should not systematically be considered to be 
processing of special categories of personal data, as they are covered 
by the definition of biometric data only when processed through a 
specific technical means allowing the unique identification or authen-
tication of a natural person. Such personal data should not be pro-
cessed, unless processing is allowed in specific cases set out in the 
GDPR, taking into account that member states’  law may lay down 
specific provisions on data protection to adapt the application of the 
rules of the GDPR for compliance with a legal obligation or for the 
performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exer-
cise of official authority vested in the controller.*
In addition to the specific requirements for such processing, the 
general principles and other rules of the GDPR should apply, in par-
ticular as regards the conditions for lawful processing. Derogations 
from the general prohibition for processing such special categories of 
personal data should be explicitly provided, inter alia , where the indi-
vidual data subject gives their explicit consent or in respect of specific 
needs, in particular where the processing is carried out in the course of 
legitimate activities by certain associations or foundations, the purpose 
of which is to permit the exercise of fundamental freedoms.† Special 
*	 GDPR Recital 53.

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
categories of personal data that deserve higher protection may only be 
processed for health-related purposes and subject to conditions.*
The processing of special categories of personal data may be neces-
sary for reasons of public interest in the areas of public health with-
out consent of the individual data subject. Such processing should be 
subject to suitable and specific measures so as to protect the rights 
of natural persons. In that context, “ public health”  should be inter-
preted as defined in Regulation 1338/2008: all elements related to 
health, namely health status, including morbidity and disability, the 
determinants having an effect on that health status, health care needs, 
resources allocated to health care, the provision of, and universal 
access to, health care as well as health care expenditure and financ-
ing, and the causes of mortality. Such processing of data concerning 
health for reasons of public interest should not result in personal data 
being processed for other purposes by third parties such as employers 
or insurance and banking companies.†
Legal Rule
Article 9 refers to processing of special categories of personal data. 
The processing of personal data, revealing racial or ethnic origin, 
political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union 
membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for 
the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning 
health, or data concerning a natural person’ s sex life or sexual orienta-
tion must be prohibited.‡
This must not apply if one of the following applies
•	 The individual data subject has given explicit consent to the 
processing of those personal data for one or more specified 
purposes, except where EU or member state law provides

Processing
“ Processing”  means any operation or set of operations that is per-
formed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by 
automated means, such as collection, recording, organization, struc-
turing, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, 
disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making avail-
able, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction.*
Filing System
“ Filing system”  means any structured set of personal data that are 
accessible according to specific criteria, whether centralized, decen-
tralized, or dispersed on a functional or geographical basis.
Controller
“ Controller”  (previously referred to as “ data controller” ) means the 
natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body that, 
alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of 
the processing of personal data, where the purposes and means of 
such processing are determined by EU or member state law, the con-
troller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for 
by EU or member state law.†
*	 The DPD95 provided the following definition of “ processing of personal data”  
(“ processing” ): any operation or set of operations that is performed on personal data, 
whether or not by automatic means, such as collection, recording, organization, stor-
age, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, 
dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, blocking, 
erasure, or destruction of the personal data.
†	 The DPD95 provided the following definition of data “ controller.”  It means the 
natural or legal person, public authority, agency or any other body that alone or

data. Where the purposes and means of processing are determined by member state 
or EU laws, the controller or the specific criteria for their nomination may be desig-
nated by member state or EU law.

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
Processor
“ Processor”  (previously referred to as “ data processor” ) means a natu-
ral or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body that pro-
cesses personal data on behalf of the controller.*
Recipient
“ Recipient”  means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency, 
or another body to which the personal data are disclosed, whether 
a third party or not. However, public authorities that may receive 
personal data in the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance 
with EU or member state law must not be regarded as recipients; the 
processing of those data by those public authorities must be in com-
pliance with the applicable data protection rules according to the pur-
poses of the processing.†
Third Party
“ Third party”  means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency, 
or body other than the individual data subject, controller, processor, 
and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or pro-
cessor, are authorized to process personal data.

Representative
The GDPR sets out the following definition of “ representative” : a 
natural or legal person established in the EU who, designated by the 
controller or processor in writing, represents the controller or proces-
sor with regard to their respective obligations under the GDPR.
Relevant Filing System
In addition, the DPD95 and GDPR provide the following definition 
of “ personal data filing system” /“ filing system” : any structured set of 
personal data accessible according to specific criteria, whether central-
ized, decentralized, or dispersed on a functional or geographical basis.
Conclusion
It is important for organizations to distinguish, in advance of col-
lecting personal data, whether the proposed data collection relates to 
general personal data or sensitive personal data. They also need to be 
able to confirm compliance procedures in advance of collecting and 
maintaining personal data, and particularly sensitive personal data. 
The organization could be asked to demonstrate at a future date that it 
obtained consent and how it maintains general compliance. If it can-
not, it may have to delete the data. It may have committed breaches 
and offenses. It may potentially face prosecution, fines, and/or being 
sued by the individual data subjects. Depending on the circumstances, 
personal liability can also arise. The new GDPR risk assessments, data 
protection impact assessments, risk consultations, and data protection 
by design and by default obligations now require more nuanced poli-
cies, records, and methodologies.
*	 The DPD95 provides that “ the data subject’ s consent”  means any freely given spe-
cific and informed indication of their wishes by which the individual data subject 
signifies their agreement to personal data relating to them being processed.

Principles
Introduction
All organizations that collect and process personal data must com-
ply with the obligations of the data protection regime. The data pro-
tection regime provides details as to what constitutes fair processing 
and identifies the information that must be given to individual data 
subjects not only where the personal data are obtained directly from 
the individual data subjects but also if they are obtained indirectly. 
It also refers to the times at which this information needs to be 
given. These can serve as preconditions to lawful data processing of 
personal data.
Organizations cannot collect and process personal data unless 
they
•	 Comply with the registration requirements (to the extent 
that some or all of these will be maintained after the General 
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), given that the GDPR 
emphasizes a more industry-sensitive approach of moving 
away from a formal registration requirement unless specific 
risks arise).
•	 Comply with the data protection principles (also known as 
the data quality principles).
•	 Ensure the processing is carried out in accordance with the 
legitimate processing conditions (and the sensitive personal 
data legitimate processing conditions in the case of sensitive 
personal data).
•	 Provide specific information to individual data subjects in 
advance of the collection and processing of personal data, 
known as the prior information requirements.
•	 Comply with the security requirements, including breach 
notifications.

132
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
•	 Undertake risk assessments and data protection impact 
assessments, and implement data protection by design and by 
default.
•	 Implement compliance procedures to ensure the individual 
data subject’ s rights.
•	 Respect the data transfer restrictions and legitimizing mech-
anisms if appropriate.
Background Guidance on Lawful, Fair, Transparent
Background Recital 2 indicates that the principles and rules on the 
protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of their 
personal data should, whatever their nationality or residence, respect 
their fundamental rights, in particular their right to the protection 
of personal data. The GDPR is intended to contribute to the accom-
plishment of an area of freedom, security, and justice and of an eco-
nomic union, to economic and social progress, to the strengthening 
and the convergence of the economies within the internal market, and 
to the well-being of natural persons.
Background Recital 26 states that the principles of data protection 
should apply to any information concerning an identified or identi-
fiable natural person. Personal data that have undergone pseudony-
mization but that could be attributed to a natural person by the use of 
additional information should be considered to be information on an 
identifiable natural person.*
To determine whether a natural person is identifiable, account 
should be taken of all the means reasonably likely to be used, such as 
singling out, either by the controller or by another person, to identify 
the natural person directly or indirectly. To ascertain whether means 
are reasonably likely to be used to identify the natural person, account 
should be taken of all objective factors, such as the costs of and the 
amount of time required for identification, taking into consideration 
the available technology at the time of the processing and technologi-
cal developments. The principles of data protection should therefore 
not apply to anonymous information; that is, information that does 
not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person or to personal 
*	 GDPR Recital 39.

133
PRINCIPLES
data rendered anonymous in such a manner that the individual data 
subject is not or no longer identifiable. The GDPR does not therefore 
concern the processing of such anonymous information, including for 
statistical or research purposes.*
The background Recitals refer to the context of requirements for 
lawful, fair, and transparent data processing. Any processing of per-
sonal data should be lawful and fair. It should be transparent to natu-
ral persons that personal data concerning them are collected, used, 
consulted, or otherwise processed and to what extent the personal 
data are or will be processed. The principle of transparency requires 
that any information and communication relating to the processing 
of those personal data be easily accessible and easy to understand, 
and that clear and plain language be used. That principle concerns, 
in particular, information to the individual data subjects on the iden-
tity of the controller and the purposes of the processing and further 
information to ensure fair and transparent processing in respect of 
the natural persons concerned and their right to obtain confirmation 
and communication of personal data concerning them that are being 
processed.†
Natural persons should be made aware of risks, rules, safeguards, 
and rights in relation to the processing of personal data and how to 
exercise their rights in relation to such processing. In particular, the 
specific purposes for which personal data are processed should be 
explicit and legitimate and determined at the time of the collection of 
the personal data. The personal data should be adequate, relevant, and 
limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are pro-
cessed. This requires, in particular, ensuring that the period for which 
the personal data are stored is limited to a strict minimum.‡
Personal data should be processed only if the purpose of the pro-
cessing could not reasonably be fulfilled by other means. To ensure 
that the personal data are not kept longer than necessary, time limits 
should be established by the controller for erasure or for a periodic 
review. Every reasonable step should be taken to ensure that personal 
data that are inaccurate are rectified or deleted. Personal data should

†	 GDPR Recital 39.
‡	 GDPR Recital 39.

134
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security and con-
fidentiality of the personal data, including for preventing unauthor-
ized access to or use of personal data and the equipment used for the 
processing.*
For processing to be lawful, personal data should be processed on 
the basis of the consent of the data subject concerned or some other 
legitimate basis, laid down by law, either in the GDPR or in other EU 
or member state law as referred to in the GDPR, including the neces-
sity for compliance with the legal obligation to which the controller is 
subject or the necessity for the performance of a contract to which the 
individual data subject is party or to take steps at the request of the 
individual data subject prior to entering into a contract.†
There is specific reference and requirements to processing necessary 
for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the 
exercise of an official authority, including for health purposes.‡
There is also reference to processing necessary to protect an interest 
that is essential for the individual data subject’ s life or that of another 
person (vital interests, e.g., humanitarian purposes, monitoring epi-
demics, or humanitarian emergencies and disasters).§ The legitimate 
interests of a controller and processing are also referred to.¶
Controllers that are part of a group of undertakings and internal 
administrative purpose transfers are referred to.**
The processing of personal data to the extent strictly necessary and 
proportionate for the purposes of ensuring network and information 
security, that is, the ability of a network or an information system 
to resist, at a given level of confidence, accidental events or unlaw-
ful or malicious actions that compromise the availability, authenticity, 
integrity, and confidentiality of stored or transmitted personal data, 
and the security of the related services offered by, or accessible via, 
those networks and systems, by public authorities, by computer emer-
gency response teams (CERTs), computer security incident response 
teams (CSIRTs), by providers of electronic communications networks

and services, and by providers of security technologies and services, 
constitutes a legitimate interest of the data controller concerned. This 
could, for example, include preventing unauthorized access to elec-
tronic communications networks and malicious code distribution and 
stopping “ denial of service”  attacks and damage to computer and elec-
tronic communication systems.*
The processing of personal data for purposes other than those for 
which the personal data were initially collected should be allowed 
only where the processing is compatible with the purposes for which 
the personal data were initially collected. In such a case, no legal basis 
separate from that which allowed the collection of the personal data 
is required. If the processing is necessary for the performance of a task 
carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official author-
ity vested in the controller, EU or member state law may determine 
and specify the tasks and purposes for which the further processing 
should be regarded as compatible and lawful. Further processing 
for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical 
research purposes, or statistical purposes should be considered to be 
compatible lawful processing operations. The legal basis provided by 
EU or member state law for the processing of personal data may also 
provide a legal basis for further processing.†
To ascertain whether a purpose of further processing is compatible 
with the purpose for which the personal data are initially collected, 
the controller, after having met all the requirements for the lawful-
ness of the original processing, should take into account, inter alia : 
any link between those purposes and the purposes of the intended 
further processing; the context in which the personal data have been 
collected, in particular the reasonable expectations of individual data 
subjects based on their relationship with the controller as to their 
further use; the nature of the personal data; the consequences of the 
intended further processing for individual data subjects; and the exis-
tence of appropriate safeguards in both the original and intended fur-
ther processing operations.‡

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
Where the individual data subject has given consent, or the process-
ing is based on EU or member state law, which constitutes a necessary 
and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard, in 
particular, important objectives of general public interest, the control-
ler should be allowed to further process the personal data irrespective 
of the compatibility of the purposes. In any case, the application of 
the principles set out in the GDPR, and in particular the information 
of the individual data subject on those other purposes and on their 
rights, including the right to object, should be ensured. Indicating 
possible criminal acts or threats to public security by the controller 
and transmitting the relevant personal data in individual cases or in 
several cases relating to the same criminal act or threats to public 
security to a competent authority should be regarded as being in the 
legitimate interest pursued by the controller. However, such transmis-
sion in the legitimate interest of the controller or further processing of 
personal data should be prohibited if the processing is not compatible 
with a legal, professional, or other binding obligation of secrecy.*
Data Protection Principles
The principles or data protection principles are also known as the data 
quality principles. The background Recitals refer to context for the 
principles. The data protection principles apply to any  information 
concerning an identified or identifiable  natural person.†
The data protection principles are also known as the data quality 
principles. Personal data must be processed fairly and lawfully. In par-
ticular, personal data must not be processed unless at least one of the 
specified conditions is met, and in the case of sensitive personal data, 
the additional sensitive conditions are also met.
Hence, the general  personal data legitimate-processing-conditions, 
and the sensitive  personal data legitimate‑processing‑conditions.
The GDPR does not apply to the personal data of deceased per-
sons. Member states may provide for rules regarding the processing of 
data of deceased persons.‡
*	 GDPR Recital 40.
†	 GDPR Recital 26.
‡	 GDPR Recital 27.

137
PRINCIPLES
Article 5 GDPR sets out the new Principles relating to data pro-
tection. All organizations with personal data must comply with the 
following data protection principles. The data protection principles 
state that data must be
•	 Processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner in rela-
tion to the individual data subject (“ lawfulness, fairness and 
transparency” ).
•	 Collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and 
not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with 
those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in 
the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, 
or statistical purposes must, in accordance with Article 89(1), 
not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes 
(“ purpose limitation” ).
•	 Adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in rela-
tion to the purposes for which they are processed (“ data 
minimization” ).
•	 Accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every rea-
sonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that 
are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which 
they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay 
(“ accuracy” ).
•	 Kept in a form that permits identification of individual data 
subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for 
which the personal data are processed; personal data may be 
stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be 
processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, 
scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical pur-
poses in accordance with Article 89(1) subject to implementa-
tion of the appropriate technical and organizational measures 
required by the GDPR to safeguard the rights and freedoms 
of the individual data subject (“ storage limitation” ).
•	 Processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of 
the personal data, including protection against unauthorized 
or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruc-
tion, or damage, using appropriate technical or organizational 
measures (“ integrity and confidentiality” ).

138
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
The controller must be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate, 
compliance with the above (“ accountability” ). This will require that 
records be kept and available in the case that they are requested by the 
data protection supervisory authority.
Controllers must also give a copy of personal data  to any individual 
on request (known as a data access request). As one national data pro-
tection law states, a “ controller shall, as respects personal data kept …

Note that the EU–US Safe Harbor data transfer regime needs to 
be replaced, given that the EU Court of Justice in the Schrems  case* 
struck down the original EU–US Safe Harbor regime as invalid. 
Longstanding negotiations between the EU and the United States 
have recently resulted in the EU–US Privacy Shield arrangement 
being agreed to facilitate data transfers. This will require particular 
attention by organizations and data protection officers as it is rolled 
out, quite apart from the GDPR and new data protection regime.
*	 Schrems v Commissioner, Court of Justice, Case C-362/14, October 6, 2015. The 
case technically related to Prism and Facebook Europe and transfers to the United 
States. However, the wider import turned out to be the entire EU-US Safe Harbor 
Agreement and data transfers to the United States. Note WP29 statement on the 
case, “ Statement  on the Implementation of the Judgement  of the Court of Justice of 
the European Union of 6 October 2015 in the Maximilian Schrems v Data Protection 
Commissioner case (C-362-14)” .

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
Processor
As one of the national data protection laws states, a “ processor shall, 
as respects personal data processed …  comply with paragraph (d) of 
subsection (1) of this section” — that is the security principle. It also 
states that “ [p]ersonal data processed by a data processor shall not be 
disclosed by [it] or by an employee or agent of [it], without the prior 
authority of the controller on behalf of whom the data are processed.”  
If the processor contravenes this obligation, an offense is committed.
How to Collect and Process Personal Data
Organizations need to comply with these principles, but in addition 
need to comply with the prior information requirements and the legit-
imate processing conditions.

Conclusion
One of the most important requirements of the data protection regime 
is the data protection principles. These are now enhanced under the 
new data protection regime, and organizations, and their data pro-
tection officers, need to take careful cognizance for their particular 
organization of the changes that will be required.

PRINCIPLES
KEY CONCEPTS 
Personal data must be lawful, fair, and transparent; for a speci-
fied, explicit, and legitimate purpose (and not further processed); 
adequate, relevant, limited (necessary) to the purpose; accurate, 
kept up to date with inaccurate data erased or rectified; kept 
no longer than necessary; protected by appropriate security; and 
compliance with these points must be demonstrated. Controllers 
must also give a copy of personal data  to any individual on 
request (i.e., a data access request).

Prior Information 
Conditions
Introduction
In addition to the principles, organizations must also be compliant 
with the prior information requirements. Even prior to obtaining and 
processing personal data, organizations are obliged to provide certain 
information to individual data subjects. This is so that individual data 
subjects can be properly informed and can decide whether or not to 
consent to the proposed data processing.
An individual may consent to processing for a given transaction, 
but may be less willing to consent if they are informed that their 
details may then be sold on to unknown third parties. There are also 
many recent examples of organizations being criticized for changing 
their data protection policies (and other terms) and what they may do 
with existing and new personal data.
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Changes
The GDPR also refers to these obligations. GDPR Chapter  III 
(rights of individual data subjects), Section  1 refers to transpar-
ency and modalities. Article 12 is headed “ [t]ransparent informa-
tion, communication and modalities for the exercise of the rights of 
the data subject.”  The controller must take appropriate measures to 
provide any information referred to in Articles 13 and 14 and any 
communication under Articles 15– 22 and 34 relating to process-
ing to the individual data subject in a concise, transparent, intel-
ligible, and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, 
in particular for any information addressed specifically to a child. 
The information must be provided in writing, or by other means, 

14 4
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
including, where appropriate, by electronic means. When requested 
by the individual data subject, the information may be provided 
orally, provided that the identity of the individual data subject is 
proved by other means.
The controller must facilitate the exercise of individual data subject 
rights under Articles 15– 22. In the cases referred to in Article 11(2), 
the controller must not refuse to act on the request of the individual 
data subject for exercising their rights under Articles 15– 22, unless 
the controller demonstrates that it is not in a position to identify the 
individual data subject.
The controller must provide information on action taken on a request 
under Articles 15– 22 to the individual data subject without undue 
delay and in any event within one  month of receipt of the request. 
That period may be extended by two further months where necessary, 
taking into account the complexity and number of the requests. The 
controller must inform the individual data subject of any such exten-
sion within one  month of receipt of the request, together with the 
reasons for the delay. Where the individual data subject makes the 
request by means of electronic form, the information must be pro-
vided by electronic means where possible, unless otherwise requested 
by the individual data subject.
If the controller does not take action on the request of the indi-
vidual data subject, the controller must inform the individual data 
subject without delay and at the latest within one month of receipt of 
the request of the reasons for not taking action and on the possibility 
of lodging a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority 
and seeking a judicial remedy.
Information provided under Articles 13 and 14 and any commu-
nication and any actions taken under Articles 15– 22 and 34 must 
be provided free of charge. Where requests from an individual data 
subject are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because 
of their repetitive character, the controller may either charge a rea-
sonable fee, taking into account the administrative costs of providing 
the information or communication or taking the action requested, or 
refuse to act on the request. The controller must bear the burden of 
demonstrating the manifestly unfounded or excessive character of the 
request.

Prior Information Conditions
Prior Information Requirements: Directly Obtained Data
The GDPR refers to information and access to data, beginning with 
Article 13. Article 13 of the GDPR relates to the prior information 
requirements and information to be provided where the data are col-
lected from the individual data subject. Where personal data relating to 
an individual data subject are collected from the individual data subject, 
the controller must, at the time when personal data are obtained, pro-
vide the individual data subject with all of the following information
•	 The identity and the contact details of the controller and, 
where applicable, of the controller’ s representative.
•	 The contact details of the data protection officer, where 
applicable.
•	 The purposes of the processing for which the personal data 
are intended as well as the legal basis for the processing.
•	 Where the processing is based on Article 6(1)(f), the legiti-
mate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party.
•	 The recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data, 
if any.
•	 Where applicable, the fact that the controller intends to trans-
fer personal data to a third country or international organiza-
tion and the existence or absence of an adequacy decision by 
the EU Commission, or in the case of transfers referred to 
in Article 46 or 47, or the second subparagraph of Article 
49(1), reference to the appropriate or suitable safeguards and 
the means by which to obtain a copy of them or where they 
have been made available.*
*	 Article 10 of the DPD95 provided for information in cases of collection of personal 
data from the individual data subject. It states that member states shall provide that 
the controller, or its representative, must provide an individual data subject from whom 
personal data are collected with at least the following information, except where they 
already have it: the identity of the controller and its representative, if any; the purposes 
of the processing; any further information, such as the recipients or categories of recipi-
ents of the data; whether replies to the questions are obligatory or voluntary, as well as 
the possible consequences of failure to reply; the existence of the right of access to and 
the right to rectify the data concerning them, in so far as such further information is 
necessary, having regard to the specific circumstances in which the data are collected, 
to guarantee fair processing in respect of the individual data subject.

146
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
In addition to this information, the controller must, at the time 
when personal data are obtained, provide the individual data subject 
with the following further information necessary to ensure fair and 
transparent processing
•	 The period for which the personal data will be stored, or if 
that is not possible, the criteria used to determine that period.
•	 The existence of the right to request from the controller access 
to and rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of 
processing concerning the individual data subject or to object 
to processing as well as the right to data portability.
•	 Where the processing is based on Article 6(1)(a) or Article 
9(2)(a), the existence of the right to withdraw consent at any 
time without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on 
consent before its withdrawal.
•	 The right to lodge a complaint with a data protection super-
visory authority.
•	 Whether the provision of personal data is a statutory or con-
tractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into 
a contract, as well as whether the individual data subject is 
obliged to provide the personal data and the possible conse-
quences of failure to provide such data.
•	 The existence of automated decision-making, including pro-
filing, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) and, at least in those 
cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as 
well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of 
such processing for the individual data subject.
Where the controller intends to further process the personal data for 
a purpose other than that for which the personal data were collected, 
the controller must provide the individual data subject prior to that fur-
ther processing with information on that other purpose and with any 
relevant further information as referred to in the two preceding lists.
However, this must not apply where and insofar as the individual 
data subject already has the information.
Prior Information Requirements: Indirectly Obtained Data
Article 14 of the GDPR refers to information to be provided where 
the data have not been obtained from the individual data subject. 

147
Prior Information Conditions
Where personal data have not been obtained from the individual data 
subject, the controller must provide the individual data subject with 
the following information
•	 The identity and the contact details of the controller and, 
where applicable, of the controller’ s representative.
•	 The contact details of the data protection officer, where 
applicable.
•	 The purposes of the processing for which the personal data 
are intended as well as the legal basis for the processing.
•	 The categories of personal data concerned.
•	 The recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data, 
if any.
•	 Where applicable, that the controller intends to transfer per-
sonal data to a recipient in a third country or international 
organization and the existence or absence of an adequacy 
decision by the EU Commission, or in the case of transfers 
referred to in Article 46 or 47, or the second subparagraph 
of Article 49(1), reference to the appropriate or suitable safe-
guards and the means to obtain a copy of them or where they 
have been made available.* 
In addition to this information, the controller must provide the 
individual data subject with the following information necessary to 
*	 Article 11 of the DPD95 provided and distinguished information where the data 
have not been obtained from the individual data subject. In this case, where the 
personal data have not been obtained from the individual data subject, the controller 
or their representative must at the time of obtaining personal data or if a disclosure 
to a third party is envisaged, no later than the time when the data are first disclosed, 
provide the individual data subject with at least the following information, except 
where they already have it: the identity of the controller and of their representative, 
if any; the purposes of the processing; any further information, such as the catego-
ries of data concerned; the recipients or categories of recipients; and the existence of 
the right of access to and the right to rectify the data concerning them, in so far as 
such further information is necessary, having regard to the specific circumstances in 
which the data are processed, to guarantee fair processing in respect of the individ-
ual data subject. Article 11(2) of DPD95 provides that Article 11(1) shall not apply 
where, for processing for statistical, historical, or scientific research purposes, the 
provision of such information proves impossible or would involve a disproportion-
ate effort or if recording or disclosure is expressly laid down by law. In these cases, 
member states shall provide appropriate safeguards.

data subject
•	 The period for which the personal data will be stored, or if 
that is not possible, the criteria used to determine that period.
•	 Where the processing is based on Article 6(1)(f), the legiti-
mate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party.
•	 The existence of the right to request from the controller access 
to and rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction 
of processing concerning the individual data subject and to 
object to processing as well as the right to data portability.
•	 Where processing is based on Article 6(1)(a) or Article 9(2)
(a), the existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time 
without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on con-
sent before its withdrawal.
•	 The right to lodge a complaint with a data protection super-
visory authority.
•	 From which source the personal data originate, and if appli-
cable, whether they came from publicly accessible sources.

filing, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) and, at least in those 
cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as 
well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of 
such processing for the individual data subject.
Timing of Information
The controller must provide this prior information (in the case of indi-
rectly obtained data)
•	 Within a reasonable period after obtaining the personal 
data, but at the latest within one month, having regard to 
the specific circumstances in which the personal data are 
processed.
•	 If the personal data are to be used for communication with 
the individual data subject, at the latest at the time of the first 
communication to that individual data subject.
or

149
Prior Information Conditions
•	 If a disclosure to another recipient is envisaged, at the latest 
when the personal data are first disclosed.
Where the controller intends to further process the personal 
data for a purpose other than that for which the personal data were 
obtained, the controller must provide the individual data subject 
prior to that further processing with information on that other pur-
pose and with any relevant further information as referred to in the 
preceding lists.
The above rules will not apply where and insofar as
•	 The individual data subject already has the information.
•	 The provision of such information proves impossible or 
would involve a disproportionate effort, in particular for 
processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, 
scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical pur-
poses, subject to the conditions and safeguards referred to 
in Article 89(1) or insofar as the obligation referred to in 
paragraph 1 of this Article is likely to render impossible or 
seriously impair the achievement of the objectives of that 
processing. In such cases, the controller must take appropri-
ate measures to protect the individual data subject’ s rights 
and freedoms and legitimate interests, including making the 
information publicly available.
•	 Obtaining or disclosure is expressly laid down by EU or 
member state law, to which the controller is subject and which 
provides appropriate measures to protect the individual data 
subject’ s legitimate interests
or
•	 Where the personal data must remain confidential subject 
to an obligation of professional secrecy regulated by EU or 
member state law, including a statutory obligation of secrecy.
Conclusion
Unless the prior information conditions are complied with, there 
may remain a question as to the fairness and legality of the per-
sonal data collection and processing. These issues may not be able 

150
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
to be rectified retrospectively. Compliance from the date of initial 
collection, and even in advance of such collection, is required by 
organizations.
KEY CONCEPTS 
In addition to the principles, organizations must provide certain 
prior information to individual data subjects so as to be able to 
collect, use, and process personal data.

Legitimate Processing 
Conditions
Introduction
In addition to complying with (1) the principles and (2) the prior 
information requirements, organizations must also comply with the 
legitimate processing conditions. These legitimate processing condi-
tions are separated in relation to general personal data and also sensi-
tive personal data.
Companies and organizations, so as to function, generally col-
lect and maintain data on a variety of individual data subjects, be 
they employees, customers, prospective customers, and so on. 
However, organizations must not mislead individual data subjects 
when obtaining and processing personal data and must also provide 
a number of prior information requirements to the individual data 
subjects. Without these, it would be deemed that there is unfair 
obtaining and processing. The new GDPR enhances this obligation 
by requiring greater transparency. For example, an organization may 
have obtained consent for processing and has informed individuals 
that their personal data will only be used in relation to activity or 
purpose A. However, if it really uses the personal data in relation 
to activities or purposes A, B, C, and D, this will not be fair and 
transparent obtaining and processing in accordance with the data 
protection principles. The data protection principles will have been 
breached, in particular the first principle. The organization has not 
fairly informed individual data subjects and has not obtained fair and 
informed consent.
In addition to the data protection principles, organizations must 
satisfy and meet one of the legitimate processing conditions. These are 
divided in relation to ordinary or general personal data and sensitive 
personal data.

152
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
Lawfulness of Processing: General Legitimate Processing Conditions
The legitimate processing conditions must be complied with in addi-
tion to the data protection principles. To collect and process personal 
data, in addition to complying with the data protection principles, 
organizations must comply with or fall within one  of the following 
general or ordinary personal data legitimate processing conditions.
Personal data must not be processed by a controller unless the con-
troller complies with the principles and at least one  of the follow-
ing conditions is satisfied. Article 6 of the GDPR sets out the new 
provisions in relation to the lawfulness of processing. Processing of 
personal data must be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one 
of the following applies
•	 The individual data subject has given consent to the process-
ing of their personal data for one or more specific purposes 
(see following section and also Article 7).
•	 Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to 
which the individual data subject is party or to take steps at 
the request of the individual data subject prior to entering into 
a contract.
•	 Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation 
to which the controller is subject [c].
•	 Processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the 
individual data subject or of another natural person.
•	 Processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried 
out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority 
vested in the controller [e].
•	 Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate 
interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except 
where such interests are overridden by the interests or fun-
damental rights and freedoms of the individual data subject, 
which require protection of personal data, in particular where 
the individual data subject is a child. This must not apply to 
processing carried out by public authorities in the perfor-
mance of their tasks.*
*	 GDPR Article 6(1).

153
Legitimate Processing Conditions
Member states may maintain or introduce more specific provisions 
to adapt the application of the rules of the GDPR with regard to the 
processing of personal data for compliance with Article 6(1)(c) and (e) 
by determining more precisely specific requirements for the process-
ing and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing, includ-
ing for other specific processing situations as provided for in GDPR 
Chapter  IX.*
The basis for the processing referred to in Article 6(1)(c) and (e) 
must be laid down by EU law or member state law to which the con-
troller is subject. The purpose of the processing must be determined 
in that legal basis or, as regards the processing referred to in point 
(e), must be necessary for the performance of a task carried out in 
the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the 
controller. That legal basis may contain specific provisions to adapt the 
application of rules of the GDPR, inter alia : the general conditions 
governing the lawfulness of processing by the controller; the types 
of data that are subject to the processing; the individual data subjects 
concerned; the entities to, and the purposes for which, the personal 
data may be disclosed; the purpose limitation; storage periods; and 
processing operations and processing procedures, including measures 
to ensure lawful and fair processing, such as those for other specific 
processing situations as provided for in GDPR Chapter  IX. The EU 
or member state law must meet an objective of public interest and be 
proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.†
Where the processing for a purpose other than that for which the 
personal data have been collected is not based on the individual data 
subject’ s consent or on an EU or member state law that constitutes a 
necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safe-
guard the objectives referred to in Article 23(1), the controller must, 
to ascertain whether processing for another purpose is compatible 
with the purpose for which the personal data are initially collected, 
take into account, inter alia 
•	 Any link between the purposes for which the personal data 
have been collected and the purposes of the intended further 
processing.
*	 GDPR Article 6(2).
†	 GDPR Article 6(3).

154
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
•	 The context in which the personal data have been collected, in 
particular regarding the relationship between individual data 
subjects and the controller.
•	 The nature of the personal data, in particular whether special 
categories of personal data are processed,* or whether per-
sonal data related to criminal convictions and offenses are 
processed.†
•	 The possible consequences of the intended further processing 
for individual data subjects.
•	 The existence of appropriate safeguards, which may include 
encryption or pseudonymization.‡
Lawfulness of Processing: Sensitive Personal 
Data Legitimate Processing Conditions
In the case of sensitive personal data, an organization must, in addi-
tion  to complying with the data protection principles, be able to com-
ply with or fall within one of the sensitive personal data legitimate 
processing conditions.
Sensitive or special categories of personal data must not be pro-
cessed by a controller unless meeting one of the following conditions
•	 The data subject has given explicit consent to the processing of 
those personal data for one or more specified purposes, except 
where EU or member state law provides that the prohibition 
referred to may not be lifted by the data subject.
•	 Processing is necessary for the purposes of carrying out the 
obligations and exercising specific rights of the controller or 
of the data subject in the field of employment and social secu-
rity and social protection law insofar as it is authorized by 
EU or member state law or a collective agreement pursuant 
to member state law providing for appropriate safeguards for 
the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject.
*	 Pursuant to GDPR Article 9.
†	 Pursuant to GDPR Article 10.
‡	 GDPR Article 6(4).

155
Legitimate Processing Conditions
•	 Processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data 
subject or of another natural person where the data subject is 
physically or legally incapable of giving consent.
•	 Processing is carried out in the course of its legitimate activi-
ties with appropriate safeguards by a foundation, association, 
or any other not-for-profit body with a political, philosophi-
cal, religious, or trade union aim and on condition that the 
processing relates solely to the members or to former members 
of the body or to persons who have regular contact with it in 
connection with its purposes and that the personal data are 
not disclosed outside that body without the consent of the 
data subjects.
•	 Processing relates to personal data that are manifestly made 
public by the data subject.
•	 Processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise, or 
defense of legal claims or whenever courts are acting in their 
judicial capacity.
•	 Processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public inter-
est, on the basis of EU or member state law, which shall be 
proportionate to the aim pursued, respect the essence of the 
right to data protection, and provide for suitable and specific 
measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the inter-
ests of the data subject.
•	 Processing is necessary for the purposes of preventive or occu-
pational medicine, for the assessment of the working capacity 
of the employee, medical diagnosis, the provision of health 
or social care or treatment or the management of health or 
social care systems and services on the basis of EU or member 
state law or pursuant to contract with a health professional 
and subject to the conditions and safeguards referred to in 
paragraph 3 [h].
•	 Processing is necessary for reasons of public interest in the 
area of public health, such as protecting against serious cross-
border threats to health or ensuring high standards of quality 
and safety of health care and of medicinal products or medical 
devices, on the basis of EU or member state law that provides 
for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the rights and 
freedoms of the data subject, in particular professional secrecy.

156
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
•	 Processing is necessary for archiving purposes in the public 
interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical 
purposes* based on Union or member state law that shall be 
proportionate to the aim pursued, respect the essence of the 
right to data protection, and provide for suitable and specific 
measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the inter-
ests of the data subject.†
The personal data referred to in the preceding list may be processed 
for the purposes referred to in Point (h) above (third last bullet) when 
those data are processed by or under the responsibility of a profes-
sional subject to the obligation of professional secrecy under EU or 
member state law or rules established by national competent bodies or 
by another person also subject to an obligation of secrecy under EU or 
member state law or rules established by national competent bodies.
Member states may maintain or introduce further conditions, 
including limitations, with regard to the processing of
•	 Genetic data.
•	 Biometric data.
•	 Data concerning health.
Conclusion
It is important for organizations to fully understand the different 
legitimate processing grounds and which are most applicable to the 
circumstances of the different processing activities that the organiza-
tion would propose to engage in.
*	 In accordance with GDPR Article 89(1).

There are new express requirements on organizations to keep and 
maintain records of their processing activities in the new GDPR.
Liability and Measures to Demonstrate Compliance
The responsibility and liability of the controller for any processing 
of personal data carried out by the controller or on the controller’ s 
behalf should be established. In particular, the controller should 
be obliged to implement appropriate and effective measures and be 
able to demonstrate the compliance of processing activities with 
the GDPR, including the effectiveness of the measures. Those 
measures should take into account the nature, scope, context, and 
purposes of the processing and the risk to the rights of natural 
persons.*
Maintaining Records
Article 30 refers to documentation issues and is headed “ Records of 
Processing Activities.”  Each controller and, where applicable, the con-
troller’ s representative, must maintain a record of processing activities 
under its responsibility. That record must contain all of the following 
information
•	 The name and contact details of the controller and, where 
applicable, the joint controller, the controller’ s representative, 
and the data protection officer.
•	 The purposes of the processing.
*	 GDPR Recital 74.

case of transfers,* the documentation of suitable safeguards.
•	 Where possible, the envisaged time limits for erasure of the 
different categories of data.
•	 Where possible, a general description of the technical and 
organizational security measures.†
Each processor and, where applicable, the processor’ s representa-
tive must maintain a record of all categories of processing activities 
carried out on behalf of a controller, containing
•	 The name and contact details of the processor or processors 
and of each controller on behalf of which the processor is act-
ing, and, where applicable, of the controller’ s or the proces-
sor’ s representative, and the data protection officer.
•	 The categories of processing carried out on behalf of each 
controller.

referred to must not apply to an enterprise or an organization employ-
ing fewer than 250 persons unless the processing it carries out is likely 
to result in a risk to the rights of individual data subjects, the process-
ing is not occasional, or the processing includes special categories of 
data† or personal data relating to criminal convictions and offenses.‡
Records Requirement
Each controller and, where applicable, the controller’ s representative 
must maintain a record of processing activities under its responsibility. 
That record must contain all of the following information
•	 The name and contact details of the controller and, where 
applicable, the joint controller, the controller’ s representative, 
and the data protection officer.
•	 The purposes of the processing.
•	 A description of the categories of data subjects and of the cat-
egories of personal data.
•	 The categories of recipients to whom the personal data have 
been or will be disclosed, including recipients in third coun-
tries or international organizations.
•	 Where applicable, transfers of personal data to a third country 
or an international organization, including the identification 
of that third country or international organization and, in the 
case of transfers,§ the documentation of suitable safeguards.
•	 Where possible, the envisaged time limits for erasure of the 
different categories of data.

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
•	 The name and contact details of the processor or processors 
and of each controller on behalf of which the processor is act-
ing, and, where applicable, of the controller’ s or the proces-
sor’ s representative, and the data protection officer.

controller.
•	 Where applicable, transfers of personal data to a third country 
or an international organization, including the identification 
of that third country or international organization and, in the 
case of transfers referred to in the second subparagraph of 
Article 49(1), the documentation of suitable safeguards.
•	 Where possible, a general description of the technical and 
organizational security measures referred to in Article 32(1).*
The records referred to above must be in writing, including in elec-
tronic form.†
The controller or the processor and, where applicable, the control-
ler’ s or the processor’ s representative must make the record available 
to the data protection supervisory authority on request.‡
The obligations referred to must not apply to an enterprise or an 
organization employing fewer than 250 persons unless the processing 
it carries out is likely to result in a risk to the rights of data subjects, 
the processing is not occasional, or the processing includes special 
categories of data§ or personal data relating to criminal convictions 
and offenses.¶
The Principles’  Record Requirements
The new principles also impose record-keeping requirements. The 
Accountability Principle expressly provides that the controller must 
be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate, compliance with the 
principles. To do so, records must be available to demonstrate such 
compliance.

KEEPING RECORDS
Cooperation with the Data Protection Supervisory Authority
Article 31 refers to cooperation with the data protection supervisory 
authority. The controller and the processor and, where applicable, 
their representatives must cooperate, on request, with the data protec-
tion supervisory authority in the performance of its tasks.
Conclusion
Record-keeping is important for a large variety of reasons. However, 
in this instance, record-keeping is an express requirement in relation 
to data collection, data usage, and data deletion under the new data 
protection regime. The data protection regime has become more spe-
cific in the record-keeping obligations, as well as more specific on the 
details of what the records must contain.
KEY CONCEPTS 
•	 Record-keeping is required by the principles.
•	 Record-keeping is required by Article 30 of the GDPR.
•	 The data protection supervisory authorities can seek records 
and documentation.
•	 Records and documentation can be needed to demonstrate 
compliance and to defend complaints and legal cases.
KEY WORDS 
•	 Must demonstrate compliance with the principles.
•	 Records of processing activities.
•	 Controller.
•	 Controller’ s representative.
•	 Must maintain records of its processing activities.
•	 Data protection officer.

Representatives of 
Controllers Not 
Established in EU
Introduction
Organizations in the United States need to consider the new obliga-
tion to have a representative designated in the EU.
Representatives/Non-EU Controllers
Background Guidance
Where a controller or a processor not established in the EU is pro-
cessing personal data of individual data subjects who are in the EU, 
and the processing activities are related to the offering of goods or 
services, irrespective of whether payment is required to the individual 
data subject or to such individual data subjects in the EU, or to the 
monitoring of their behavior as far as their behavior takes place within 
the EU, the controller or the processor should designate a representa-
tive, unless the processing is occasional, does not include processing 
on a large scale of special categories of personal data or the processing 
of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offenses, and is 
unlikely to result in a risk to the rights of natural persons, taking into 
account the nature, context, scope and purposes of the processing or if 
the controller is a public authority or body. The representative should 
act on behalf of the controller or the processor and may be addressed 
by any data protection supervisory authority.*
The representative should be explicitly designated by a written 
mandate of the controller or of the processor to act on its behalf with 
regard to its obligations under the General Data Protection Regulation 
*	 GDPR Recital 80.

166
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
(GDPR). The designation of such a representative does not affect the 
responsibility or liability of the controller or of the processor under 
the GDPR. Such a representative should perform its tasks according 
to the mandate received from the controller or processor, including 
cooperating with the competent data protection supervisory authori-
ties with regard to any action taken to ensure compliance with the 
GDPR. The designated representative should be subject to enforce-
ment proceedings in the event of non-compliance by the controller or 
processor.*
Article Requirement
The GDPR refers to representatives of controllers not established in 
the EU. Article 27(1) provides that “ [w]here Article 3(2) applies, the 
controller or the processor must designate in writing a representative 
in the [EU].” 
This obligation will not apply to
•	 Processing that is occasional, does not include, on a large 
scale, processing of special categories of data† or processing of 
personal data relating to criminal convictions and offenses,‡ 
and is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights of natural per-
sons, taking into account the nature, context, scope, and pur-
poses of the processing, or
•	 A public authority or body.§
The representative must be established in one of the member states 
where the data subjects are whose personal data are processed in rela-
tion to the offering of goods or services to them, or whose behavior is 
monitored.¶
The representative must be mandated by the controller or proces-
sor to be addressed in addition to or instead of the controller or the 
processor by, in particular, data protection supervisory authorities and

§	 GDPR Article 27(2).
¶	 GDPR Article 27(3).

167
NON-EU CONTROLLERS
data subjects, on all issues related to processing, for the purposes of 
ensuring compliance with the GDPR.*
The designation of a representative by the controller or proces-
sor must be without prejudice to legal actions that could be initiated 
against the controller or the processor themselves.†
Conclusion
Organizations seeking to target or otherwise deal with EU personal 
data must ensure that they have a designated representative to deal 
with issues, particularly where they are located outside of the EU. 
This is a separate obligation from that of appointing a data protection 
officer.
KEY CONCEPTS 
Organizations must appoint a representative in the EU when 
the organization is outside of the EU and is dealing with EU 
personal data.
KEY WORDS 
•	 Controllers not established in the EU.
•	 Controllers.
•	 Processors.
•	 Must designate in writing a representative in the EU.

Rights of Individual 
Data Subjects
Introduction
The data protection regime provides, or enshrines, a number of key 
rights for individuals in relation to their informational personal data. 
These are important because organizations must respect these proce-
dural and fundamental rights.* They are also important because the 
individuals themselves can enforce their rights where, for example, 
they feel an organization is abusing their rights and obligations. Some 
of these rights also apply regardless of any suspicion of a breach or 
non-compliance by an organization. Additionally, there are increasing 
instances of groups of individual data subjects cooperating together 
against organizations. This possibility is further facilitated under the 
new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), whereby individ-
ual data subject representative organizations are permitted.
The new GDPR background Recitals refer to individual data sub-
ject rights;† principles of fair and transparent processing;‡ prior infor-
mation requirements;§ right of access right of rectification and right to 
be forgotten;¶ right to complain to single data protection supervisory 
authority;** and  automated processing,†† which set the context of the 
processes and procedures that organizations need to consider.

Treaty.

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
Recipients of Rights
When considering the respective rights, organizations should not for-
get to consider the potential recipients of the various data protection 
rights. The data protection rights apply generally in relation to any 
individuals whose personal data are being collected and processed. 
Specifically, they can include
•	 Employees.
•	 Other workers such as contractors, temps, and casual staff.
•	 Agency staff.
•	 Ex-employees and retired employees.
•	 Job applicants, including unsuccessful applicants.
•	 Volunteers.
•	 Apprentices and trainees.
•	 Customers and clients.
•	 Prospective customers and clients.
•	 Users of services provided without monetary remuneration.
•	 Suppliers.
•	 Related family members.
The list is also expanding.
Issues
Court and civil tortious remedies are available to individual data sub-
jects in addition to enforcing compliance with the prior information 
requirements, data protection principles, legitimate processing condi-
tions, and security requirements. The data protection rules contain a 
number of further important rights for individuals in respect of their 
personal data. The data protection rights enshrined in the data pro-
tection regime for individuals are set out in the data protection prin-
ciples. They include the details in the paragraphs following.
Individuals have a right to be informed by an organization as to 
their identity and details when it is collecting and processing the indi-
vidual’ s personal data.
The organization must disclose to the individual the purpose 
for which it is collecting and processing the individual’ s personal 
data.

171
Rights of Individual Data Subjects
If the organization is forwarding or transferring the personal data 
to third-party recipients, it must disclose this to the individual as well 
as identify the third-party recipients. If it is permitted to transfer the 
personal data outside of the country, the organization must then also 
identify which third-party country will be receiving the personal data.
Possibly the most important right relates to the right of individual 
data subjects to access or obtain a copy of their personal data as held 
by organizations. Organizations must reply to requests from the indi-
vidual in relation to their data protection rights. This includes requests 
for access to a copy of the personal data held in relation to the individ-
ual. This is known as a personal data access request. Every individual 
about whom a controller keeps personal information has a number of 
other rights under the data protection laws, in addition to the right 
of access. These include the rights to have any inaccurate information 
rectified or erased and to have personal data taken off a direct market-
ing or direct mailing list.
The individual data subject has a right to prevent processing likely 
to cause damage or distress. A further right relates to automated deci-
sion taking. Importantly, individual data subjects have specific rights 
in relation to rectification, blocking, erasure, and destruction. This is 
being further calibrated as encompassing the right to oblivion/right to 
be forgotten in the GDPR.
Individual data subjects are also entitled to compensation, as well 
as being entitled to complain to the data protection supervisory 
authority and to file actions in the courts to obtain judicial remedies. 
The 1995 data protection directive (DPD95) noted, for example, that 
data protection laws must not result in any lessening of the protection 
but must, on the contrary, seek to ensure a high level of protection 
in the EU.*
These individual rights are enhanced and expanded under the 
new GDPR. Transparency and consent are very important aspects 
of respecting and enabling the fundamental rights to be vindicated, 
used, and enforced by individual data subjects. Individual data subjects 
have a right of access to personal data. Certain fees may be charged 
for access copies— although they are minimal. There are also time 
limits to be complied with by the organization in relation to replying 
*	 DPD95 Recital (10).

172
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
to individual data subjects’  access requests (i.e., a request to access or 
obtain a copy of their personal data that the organization holds).
Individuals also have a right to prevent data processing for direct 
marketing purposes.
The individual data subject has a right to prevent processing likely 
to cause damage or distress.
A further right relates to automated computer decision-making, 
which relates to automated decisions being taken without human 
oversight or intervention. The traditional example often used is 
adverse credit decisions being taken automatically without human 
intervention.*
There has been a lot of publicity in relation to the deletion and 
right to be forgotten rights of individuals. Importantly, individual 
data subjects have specific rights in relation to rectification, blocking, 
erasure, and destruction and what is becoming known as the right to 
be forgotten. This has gained significance and attention given the EU 
Court of Justice decision in a “ right to be forgotten”  takedown case.†
Individual data subjects are also entitled to compensation, as well as 
being entitled to complain to the data protection supervisory author-
ity and to the courts to obtain judicial remedies.
Background Guidance
Background Recital 1 provides guidance and states that the protec-
tion of natural persons in relation to the processing of personal data is 
a fundamental right. Article 8(1) of the Charter‡ and Article 16(1) of 
the EU Treaty§ provide that everyone has the right to the protection 
of personal data concerning them. The Recitals also refer to individual 
*	 However, it can equally encompass such adverse decisions and activities as so-
called neutral algorithmic processing and arranging of information and result out-
puts. Examples include search rankings and priorities; search suggestions; search 
prompts; autosuggest; autocomplete; and so on. Other examples could arise in rela-
tion to profiling and advertising-related activities.

data subject rights;* principles of fair and transparent processing;† 
prior information requirements;‡ right of access;§ right of rectification 
and right to be forgotten;¶ right to complain to single data protection 
supervisory authority;** and automated processing issues.††
Procedures or modalities need to be provided for facilitating the 
exercise of the individual data subject’ s rights under the GDPR, 
including mechanisms to request and, if applicable, obtain, free of 
charge, access to and rectification or erasure of personal data and the 
exercise of the right to object. The controller should also provide means 
for requests to be made electronically, especially where personal data 
are processed by electronic means. The controller should be obliged to 
respond to requests from the individual data subject without undue 
delay and at the latest within one month . The organization must give 
reasons where it does not intend to comply with any such requests.‡‡ 
The main proactive rights for individual data subjects are referred to 
in the following section.
Legal Rules and Rights
Chapter  III of the GDPR refers to the rights of individual data sub-
jects. Some rights refer to compliance-type rights. The others refer to 
proactive rights exercisable directly by individual data subjects. These 
categories can interact with each other depending on individual cir-
cumstances. Some of the rights are also exercisable regardless of any 
wrongdoing or breach by the controller.
These rights include
•	 Right to Transparency : The GDPR provides that individual 
data subjects are entitled to transparency in relation to the 
collection and processing of their personal data. There are also

consequent obligations on organizations seeking to use such 
data.* See Chapter  35 for more details.
•	 Right to Prior Information: Directly Obtained Data : The GDPR 
sets out various prior information requirements or conditions 
for directly obtained data that must be satisfied prior to col-
lecting and using personal data from individuals. Individual 
data subjects have a right to be informed of certain required 
criteria in relation to directly  obtained data.† See Chapter  10 
for more details.
•	 Right to Prior Information: Indirectly Obtained Data : The 
GDPR sets out various prior information requirements or 
conditions for indirectly obtained data that must be satisfied 
prior to collecting and using personal data from individuals. 
Individual data subjects have a right to be informed of certain 
required criteria in relation to indirectly obtained data.‡ See 
Chapter  10 for more details.
•	 Right of Confirmation and Right of Access : Individual data sub-
jects have a right to know or have confirmed whether a given 
organization is holding any of their personal data. Individual 
data subjects also have a right to obtain access to their per-
sonal data, which generally means obtaining a copy of the 
data from the organization.§ See Chapter  15 for more details.
•	 Right to Be Informed of Third-Country Safeguards : Individual 
data subjects have the right to be informed, where personal 
data are transferred to a third country or to an international 
organization, of the appropriate safeguards¶ relating to the 
transfer of data.** This has added relevance as part of the 
potential ripples from the Schrems  EU Court of Justice case.††

have a right to notification regarding rectification, erasure, or 
restriction of personal data.§ See Chapter  20 for more details.
•	 Right to Data Portability : Individuals have a right to be able to 
move their personal data from one service provider to another 
service provider, essentially to port or have their data that are 
essential for the continuation or replacement of the service 
transferred; hence the reference to the data portability right.¶ 
See Chapter  23 for more details.
•	 Right to Object : Individuals have a right to object to process-
ing.** See Chapter  19 for more details.
•	 Right to Object to Marketing and Direct Marketing : Individuals 
have a right to object to processing of their personal data in 
marketing and direct marketing.†† See Chapter  19 for more 
details.
•	 Rights re Automated Individual Decision-Making, Including 
Profiling : Individuals have a right in relation to automated 
individual decisions or automated individual decision-making 
processes, including in relation to their profiling by organiza-
tions.‡‡ See Chapter  21 for more details.

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
•	 Data Protection by Design and Default : Organizations are 
obliged to adopt the policy of data protection by design and 
by default, and individual data subjects are entitled to expect 
such procedures to be adopted.* See Chapters  31 and 32 for 
more details.
•	 Security Rights : Organizations are obliged to ensure that per-
sonal data are protected, and individuals expect that their data 
will be properly protected. See Chapter  28 for more details.
•	 Impact Assessment and Prior Consultation : Organizations are 
obliged to provide, and individual data subjects expect, appro-
priate new impact design protections and prior consultation 
protections. See Chapter  30 for more details.
•	 Communicating Data Breach to Individual Data Subjects : 
Data subjects have rights to be informed in the event of data 
breaches involving their data at organizations. See Chapter  29 
for more details.
•	 Data Protection Officer : Organizations can be obliged to 
appoint data protection officers, and there are certain obli-
gations thereby owed to data subjects, such as the ability 
to contact the data protection officer with data queries. See 
Chapter  41 for more details.
•	 Remedies, Liability, and Sanctions : Chapter  VIII of the GDPR 
refers to remedies, liability issues, and sanctions regarding 
data protection. Organizations have compliance obligations 
and duties, including to data subjects, in relation to remedies, 
liability, and sanctions. These include, for example, right to 
effective judicial remedy against the controller or processor; 
representation of individual data subjects; right to compensa-
tion and liability; right to lodge complaint with data protec-
tion supervisory authority; right to judicial remedy against a 
data protection supervisory authority. See Chapters  38 and 26 
for more details.
Organizations, in dealing with individuals and in considering the 
rights of individual data subjects, must be fully aware that the data 
*	 GDPR Article 25.

177
Rights of Individual Data Subjects
protection principles must also be complied with as regards the indi-
vidual data subject. Personal data must be
•	 Lawful, fair, and transparent.
•	 For a specified, explicit, and legitimate purpose (and not fur-
ther processed).
•	 Adequate, relevant, limited (necessary) to the purpose.
•	 Accurate, kept up to date, with inaccurate data erased or 
rectified.
•	 Kept no longer than necessary.
•	 Protected by appropriate security.
•	 And organizations must demonstrate compliance with these 
points.
Organizations must also give a copy of personal data  to any indi-
vidual on request (i.e., a data access request) and ensure adequate 
security of personal data.
Conclusion
These rights are very important for organizations to recognize and pro-
tect. They need to be incorporated into the organization from day one, 
as it may not always be possible to become compliant retrospectively if 
the initial collection and processing were illegitimate. This is increas-
ingly significant as data protection authorities become more proactive 
and as the levels of fines and penalties increase. The rights are expand-
ing, more explicit, and more nuanced in the GDPR. It is important that 
organizations keep abreast of the expanding rights and obligations.
KEY CONCEPTS 
Organizations need to consider each of the various rights of 
individual data subjects, as each right refers to a separate issue, 
and therefore separate procedural mechanisms need to be con-
figured. In addition, procedures, records, and so on need to be 
established to demonstrate compliance to the data protection 
supervisory authority in the event of query, audit, or complaint. 
Compliance procedures and contentious related procedures need 

178
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
to be implemented so as to have advance preparation in the event 
of individual data subject or group data subject complaints or 
litigation arising.
KEY WORDS 
•	 Right of confirmation.
•	 Right of access.
•	 Erasure and right to be forgotten.
•	 Right to restriction of processing.
•	 Right to object to processing.
•	 Right against automated individual decision-making, includ-
ing profiling.
•	 Notification obligation regarding rectification, erasure, or 
restriction.
•	 Right to prevent processing for direct marketing.
•	 Rectification and erasure right.
•	 Portability right.
•	 Outsourcing to third-party data processors.

Rights of Confirmation 
and Right of Access
Introduction
The data protection regime recognizes that individuals are hindered 
in their ability to decide what happens with their personal data if they 
are not able to know that organizations are seeking to collect, use, and 
process their personal data. Therefore, individual data subjects should 
be able to have a given organization confirm whether or not they are 
holding their data, and if it is affirmative and they wish to do so, the 
right to be able to obtain a copy of such data.
Right of Confirmation
Individual data subjects have a right to establish the existence of per-
sonal data. An individual who believes that an organization keeps 
personal data must, when requested in writing, have a right
•	 To be informed by the organization whether it keeps any such 
data; and
•	 If it does, to be given by the organization a description of the 
data and the purposes for which the data are kept.
This must be given as soon as possible and in any event not more 
than a specified number of days after the request has been given or 
sent to the organization. The new General Data Protection Regulation 
(GDPR) refers to a maximum of one month, but this may be extended 
in particular circumstances.*

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
Background Guidance
The principles of fair and transparent processing require that the 
individual data subject be informed of the existence of the processing 
operation and its purposes. The controller should provide the indi-
vidual data subject with any further information necessary to ensure 
fair and transparent processing, taking into account the specific cir-
cumstances and context in which the personal data are processed. 
Furthermore, the individual data subject should be informed of the 
existence of profiling and the consequences of such profiling. Where 
the personal data are collected from the individual data subject, the 
individual data subject should also be informed whether he or she is 
obliged to provide the personal data and of the consequences if he or 
she does not provide such data. This information may be provided 
in combination with standardized icons to give, in an easily visible, 
intelligible, and clearly legible manner, a meaningful overview of the 
intended processing. Where the icons are presented electronically, 
they should be machine-readable.*
The information in relation to the processing of personal data relat-
ing to the individual data subject should be given to them at the time 
of collection from the individual data subject, or, where the personal 
data are obtained from another source, within a reasonable period, 
depending on the circumstances of the case. Where personal data can 
be legitimately disclosed to another recipient, the individual data sub-
ject should be informed when the personal data are first disclosed to 
the recipient. Where the controller intends to process the personal 
data for a purpose other than that for which they were collected, the 
controller should provide the individual data subject prior to that fur-
ther processing with information on that other purpose and other 
necessary information. Where the origin of the personal data can-
not be provided to the individual data subject because various sources 
have been used, general information should be provided.†
However, it is not necessary to impose the obligation to provide 
information where the individual data subject already possesses the 
information, where the recording or disclosure of the personal data is 
expressly laid down by law, or where the provision of information to

the individual data subject proves to be impossible or would involve a 
disproportionate effort. The last in particular could be the case where 
processing is carried out for archiving purposes in the public inter-
est, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes. 
In that regard, the number of individual data subjects, the age of the 
data, and any appropriate safeguards adopted should be taken into 
consideration.*
Legal Rule
The access right is also referred to in Article 15 of the GDPR. It refers 
to the right of access for individual data subjects. The individual data 
subject must have the right to obtain from the controller confirma-
tion as to whether or not personal data concerning them are being 
processed and where such personal data are being processed, access to 
the data, and the following information
•	 The purposes of the processing.
•	 The categories of personal data concerned.
•	 The recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal 
data have been or will be disclosed, in particular to recipients 
in third countries or international organizations.
•	 Where possible, the envisaged period for which the personal 
data will be stored, or if this is not possible, the criteria used 
to determine this period.
•	 The existence of the right to request from the controller rec-
tification or erasure of personal data or restriction of the pro-
cessing of personal data concerning the individual data subject 
or to object to the processing of such personal data.
•	 The right to lodge a complaint to a data protection supervisory 
authority.
•	 Where the personal data are not collected from the individual 
data subject, any available information as to their source.
•	 The existence of automated decision-making, including 
profiling,† and at least in those cases, meaningful information 
*	 GDPR Recital 62.
†	 Referred to in GDPR Article 22(1) and (4).

182
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
about the logic involved as well as the significance and the 
envisaged consequences of such processing for the individual 
data subject.
Article 15(3) provides that the controller must provide a copy of the 
personal data undergoing processing. For any further copies requested 
by the individual data subject, the controller may charge a reasonable 
fee based on administrative costs. Where the individual data subject 
makes the request in electronic form, and unless otherwise requested 
by the individual data subject, the information must be provided in a 
commonly used electronic form .
It should be noted that it may no longer be possible to charge for 
the initial copy of the personal data furnished to the individual data 
subject.
Where personal data are transferred to a third country or to an 
international organization, the individual data subject must have the 
right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards pursuant to Article 
46 relating to the transfer.*
The controller must provide a copy of the personal data undergoing 
processing.
The right to obtain a copy of the personal data must not adversely 
affect the rights of others.†
Right of Access
One of the rights that individual data subjects have is a right of access  
to personal data. This applies to individual data subjects. It is an indi-
vidual data subject’ s right. Certain fees may be charged for obtaining 
copies of personal data held by an organization. These are minimal, 
however. There are also time limits to be complied with by controllers 
in relation to replying to an individual data subject access request. It is 
*	 GDPR Article 15(2).
†	 GDPR Articles 15(4). Prior to the new GDPR, the UK data protection supervisory 
authority (Information Commissioner’ s Office [ICO]) has issued recommendations 
in relation to data access issues, namely: Access to Information Held in Complaint 
Files; Enforced Subject Access; How to Disclose Information Safely— Removing 
Personal Data from Information Requests and Datasets; Regulatory Activity 
Exemption; Subject Access: Code of Practice; Subject Access: Responding to a 
Request Checklist. These now need to be read in light of the GDPR changes.

183
CONFIRMATION AND ACCESS
also important to note that certain rights, including the access right, 
can be invoked by individuals at any time and for any reason. They do 
not have to wait for an apparent breach by an organization.
Background Guidance
An individual data subject should have the right of access to per-
sonal data that have been collected concerning them, and to exercise 
that right easily and at reasonable intervals, so as to be aware of, and 
verify, the lawfulness of the processing. This includes the right for 
individual data subjects to have access to data concerning their health; 
for example, the data in their medical records containing information 
such as diagnoses, examination results, assessments by treating physi-
cians, and any treatment or interventions provided. Every individual 
data subject should therefore have the right to know and obtain com-
munication in particular with regard to the purposes for which the 
personal data are processed, where possible the period for which the 
personal data are processed, the recipients of the personal data, the 
logic involved in any automatic personal data processing and, at least 
when based on profiling, the consequences of such processing. Where 
possible, the controller should be able to provide remote access to a 
secure system, which would provide the individual data subject with 
direct access to their personal data. That right should not adversely 
affect the rights or freedoms of others, including trade secrets or 
intellectual property and in particular the copyright protecting the 
software.*
However, the result of those considerations should not be a refusal 
to provide all information to the individual data subject. Where the 
controller processes a large quantity of information concerning the 
individual data subject, the controller should be able to request that, 
before the information is delivered, the individual data subject specify 
the information or processing activities to which the request relates. 
The controller should use all reasonable measures to verify the identity 
of an individual data subject who requests access, in particular in the 
context of online services and online identifiers. A controller should

184
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
not retain personal data for the sole purpose of being able to react to 
potential requests.*
Legal Rule
Chapter  III, Section  2 of the GDPR refers to data access. It should be 
noted that the prior information requirements might have previously 
been viewed as controller compliance obligations. However, they are 
now reformulated as part of the individual data subject rights. This is 
therefore a change in emphasis.
Article 12 of the DPD95 also provides for the right of access. It 
provides that member states must guarantee every data subject the 
right to obtain from the controller without constraint, at reasonable 
intervals and without excessive delay or expense
•	 Confirmation as to whether or not data relating to them are 
being processed and information at least as to the purposes 
of the processing, the categories of data concerned, and the 
recipients or categories of recipients to whom the data are 
disclosed.
•	 Communication to them in an intelligible form of the data 
undergoing processing and of any available information as to 
their source.
•	 Knowledge of the logic involved in any automatic processing 
of data concerning them, at least in the case of automated 
decisions.†
•	 As appropriate, the rectification, erasure, or blocking of data 
the processing of which does not comply with the provisions 
of the Directive, in particular because of the incomplete or 
inaccurate nature of the data.‡
•	 Notification to third parties to whom the data have been dis-
closed of any rectification, erasure, or blocking carried out, 
unless this proves impossible or involves a disproportionate 
effort.

CONFIRMATION AND ACCESS
Access: What Must Be Supplied
An individual must, if they so request a controller by notice in writ-
ing, be informed by the controller whether the data processed by or 
on behalf of the controller include personal data relating to the indi-
vidual. If the individual data subject requests, they must be supplied 
by the controller with a description of
•	 The categories of data being processed by or on behalf of the 
controller.
•	 The personal data constituting the data of which that indi-
vidual is the individual data subject.
•	 The purpose or purposes of the processing.
•	 The recipients or categories of recipients to whom the data are 
or may be disclosed.
Time Limits for Access
The individual data subject must have communicated to them in intel-
ligible form
•	 The information constituting any personal data of which that 
individual is the individual data subject.
•	 Any information known or available to the controller as to 
the source of those data, unless the communication of that 
information is contrary to the public interest.
•	 Where the processing by automatic means of the data of 
which the individual is the individual data subject has con-
stituted or is likely to constitute the sole basis for any decision 
significantly affecting them, information free of charge by the 
controller on the logic involved in the processing.
Making Request for Access
To make an access request, the individual data subject must
•	 Apply in writing (which can include email [or other electronic 
form]).
•	 Give any details that might be needed to help the organization 
identify them and locate all the information the organization 

186
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
may keep about them; for example, previous addresses, cus-
tomer account numbers.
•	 Pay the organization an access fee if the organization charges 
one. Such a fee is nominal.
Dealing with Access Requests
One commentary* refers to the advisability of having a process flow 
chart in place. The main components referred to include
•	 Individual data subject asks for personal data.
•	 Individual data subject access request form issued.
•	 Individual data subject access request form returned plus 
appropriate fee (if requested).
•	 Personal data located by legal department, data protection 
personnel, or other.
•	 Data examined in relation to any third-party information, 
health data, or exempt data.
•	 Data reviewed by legal department.
•	 Personal data copy issued to individual data subject.
On making an access request, any individual about whom personal 
data is kept is entitled to
•	 A copy of the personal data being held about them.
•	 Know the categories of their personal data and the purpose/s 
for processing it.
•	 Know the identity of those to whom the controller discloses 
the personal data.
•	 Know the source of the personal data, unless it is contrary to 
public interest.
•	 Know the logic involved in automated decisions.
•	 Data held in the form of opinions, except where such opinions 
were given in confidence, and in such cases, where the per-
son’ s fundamental rights suggest that they should access the 
personal data in question.
*	 Morgan and Boardman, Data Protection Strategy (Sweet & Maxwell, 2003) 252.

187
CONFIRMATION AND ACCESS
It is important that organizations have clear and documented  proce-
dures in place to ensure that all relevant manual files and computers 
are checked for personal data in respect of which the access request is 
being made.
Response to Access Requests
In response to an access request an organization must
•	 Supply the information to the individual data subject promptly 
and within a specified number of days of receiving the request.
•	 Provide the information in a form that will be clear to the 
ordinary person; for example, any codes must be explained.*
If the organization does not keep any information about the indi-
vidual making the request, the organization should inform the indi-
vidual within a specified number of days.† An organization is not 
obliged to refund any fee charged for dealing with the access request 
should it not, in fact, keep any personal data.‡ However, the fee must 
be refunded if the organization does not comply with the request or if 
the organization has to rectify, supplement, or erase the personal data 
concerned.
If the organization restricts the individual’ s right of access in 
accordance with one of the very limited restrictions set down in the 
national data protection laws, the organization must notify the indi-
vidual data subject in writing within a specified number of days, and 
it must include a statement of the reasons for refusal. The organization 
must also inform the individual of their entitlement to complain to 
the data protection supervisory authority about the refusal.
There are certain modifications to the basic right to access granted 
by the data protection laws, which include the following
•	 Access to health and social work data.
•	 Modifications to the right of access in the interest of the indi-
vidual data subject or the public interest, designed to protect 
the individual from hearing anything about them that might

188
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
cause serious harm to their physical or mental health or emo-
tional well-being.
•	 Examinations data.
In the case of examinations data, there is an increased time limit 
for responding to an access request from 40 to 60  days, and an access 
request is deemed to be made at the date of the first publication of the 
results or at the date of the request, whichever is the later.
Possible Access Exceptions and Issues
This must be done as soon as possible and in any event not more 
than a specified number of days after compliance by the individual 
with the provisions, and where any of the information is expressed in 
terms that are not intelligible to the average person without expla-
nation, the information must be accompanied by an explanation of 
those terms.
Where personal data relating to an individual data subject con-
sist of an expression of opinion about the individual data subject 
by another person, the data may be disclosed to the individual 
data subject without obtaining the consent of that person to the 
disclosure.
The obligations imposed to communicate to the individual data 
subject the personal data and details as to the source of the personal 
data can be complied with by supplying the individual data subject 
with a copy of the information concerned in permanent form, unless
•	 The supply of such a copy is not possible or would involve 
disproportionate effort, or
•	 The individual data subject agrees otherwise.
Where a controller has previously complied with an access request, 
the controller is not obliged to comply with a subsequent identical or 
similar request under that subsection by the same individual unless, 
in the opinion of the controller, a reasonable interval has elapsed 
between compliance with the previous request and the making of the 
current request. In determining whether such reasonable interval has 
elapsed, regard must be given to the nature of the data, the purpose 
for which the data are processed, and the frequency with which the 
data are altered.

189
CONFIRMATION AND ACCESS
The provision regarding automated data is not to be regarded as 
requiring the provision of information as to the logic involved in the 
taking of a decision if and to the extent only that such provision would 
adversely affect trade secrets or intellectual property (in particular any 
copyright protecting computer software).
Conclusion
Two of the earliest rights that organizations may have to interact with 
individual data subject queries will be the right of confirmation of 
whether there is personal data held in relation to the requestor, and 
also the right to provide access or copies of the personal data held, 
once so requested. This requires advance processes and procedures to 
be put in place within the organization, as well as associated records 
and designations of responsibility.
KEY CONCEPTS 
Two of the most commonly used rights by data subjects are 
the confirmation and access rights in relation to personal data. 
Organizations must comply with the new GDPR confirmation 
and access rights. This includes preparing policies and procedures 
in advance, such as designing sets of standard reply correspon-
dence and sets of internal requests to departments, guidance, 
and so on.
KEY WORDS 
•	 Confirmation right; that is, right to have confirmed whether 
personal data are being held.

Right to Rectification
Introduction
Chapter  III, Section  3 of the General Data Protection Regulation 
(GDPR) refers to rectification and erasure. The individual data sub-
ject must have the right to obtain from the controller without undue 
delay the rectification of inaccurate personal data concerning them. 
Taking into account the purposes of the processing, the data sub-
ject must have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, 
including by means of providing a supplementary statement.*
Background Guidance
Background Recital 59 states that modalities should be provided for 
facilitating the exercise of the data subject’ s rights under the GDPR, 
including mechanisms to request and, if applicable, obtain, free of 
charge, in particular, access to and rectification or erasure of personal 
data and the exercise of the right to object. The controller should also 
provide means for requests to be made electronically, especially where 
personal data are processed by electronic means. The controller should 
be obliged to respond to requests from the data subject without undue 
delay and at the latest within one month and to give reasons where the 
controller does not intend to comply with any such requests.
Background Recital 73 adds that restrictions concerning specific 
principles and the rights of information, access to, and rectification 
or erasure of personal data; the right to data portability; the right to 
object; decisions based on profiling; as well as the communication of 
a personal data breach to a data subject and certain related obligations 
of the controllers may be imposed by EU or member state law, as far 
*	 GDPR Article 16.

192
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
as necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard 
public security, including the protection of human life, especially in 
response to natural or manmade disasters; the prevention, investiga-
tion, and prosecution of criminal offenses or the execution of criminal 
penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of 
threats to public security, or of breaches of ethics for regulated profes-
sions; other important objectives of general public interest of the EU 
or of a member state, in particular an important economic or financial 
interest of the EU or of a member state; the keeping of public registers 
for reasons of general public interest; further processing of archived 
personal data to provide specific information related to the political 
behavior under former totalitarian state regimes or the protection of 
the data subject or the rights of others, including social protection, 
public health, and humanitarian purposes. Those restrictions should 
be in accordance with the requirements set out in the EU Charter and 
in the Human Rights Convention.
Background Recital 156 states that the processing of personal 
data for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or his-
torical research purposes, or statistical purposes should be subject to 
appropriate safeguards for the rights of the data subject pursuant to 
the GDPR. Those safeguards should ensure that technical and orga-
nizational measures are in place to ensure, in particular, the prin-
ciple of data minimization. The further processing of personal data 
for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical 
research purposes, or statistical purposes is to be carried out when 
the controller has assessed the feasibility of fulfilling those purposes 
by processing data that do not permit or no longer permit the iden-
tification of data subjects, provided that appropriate safeguards exist 
(such as, e.g., pseudonymization of the data). Member states should 
provide appropriate safeguards for the processing of personal data 
for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical 
research purposes, or statistical purposes. Member states should be 
authorized to provide, under specific conditions and subject to appro-
priate safeguards for data subjects, specifications and derogations 
with regard to the information requirements and rights to rectifica-
tion, to erasure, to be forgotten, to restriction of processing, to data 
portability, and to object when processing personal data for archiving 

193
RIGHT TO RECTIFICATION
purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research pur-
poses, or statistical purposes. The conditions and safeguards in ques-
tion may entail specific procedures for data subjects to exercise those 
rights if this is appropriate in the light of the purposes sought by the 
specific processing along with technical and organizational measures 
aimed at minimizing the processing of personal data in pursuance of 
the proportionality and necessity principles. The processing of per-
sonal data for scientific purposes should also comply with other rel-
evant legislation, such as on clinical trials.
Legal Rule
Individual data subjects have a right of rectification, blocking, and 
erasure. The 1995 data protection directive (DPD95) provided for the 
right of rectification, erasure, or blocking. Article 12 states that mem-
ber states must guarantee every individual data subject the right to 
obtain from the controller
•	 As appropriate, the rectification, erasure, or blocking of data 
the processing of which does not comply with the provisions 
of the Directive, in particular because of the incomplete or 
inaccurate nature of the data.
•	 Notification to third parties to whom the data have been dis-
closed of any rectification, erasure, or blocking carried out in 
compliance, unless this proves impossible or involves a dis-
proportionate effort.
Chapter  III, Section  3 of the GDPR refers to rectification and era-
sure. This was already an important and topical issue and is now even 
more important on the foot of the Google Spain  case and also issues 
such as online abuse. The GDPR contains important new rectification 
rights, known as the right of rectification and erasure. In particular, 
Article 16 provides that the individual data subject must have the right 
to obtain from the controller without undue delay the rectification of 
inaccurate personal data concerning them. Taking into account the 
purposes of the processing, the individual data subject must have the 
right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means 
of providing a supplementary statement.

194
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
Conclusion
The explosion in electronically held data means that there is increased 
potential for inaccurate or incomplete data relating to individuals. 
Recognizing this issue, the GDPR provides a right of rectification to 
individuals, which organizations must comply with.
KEY CONCEPTS 
The rectification right addresses two specific issues. The first is 
personal data that is incorrect. The second is personal data that 
is incomplete. Individual data subjects have a right as regards 
each situation.

Right to Erasure and 
Right to Be Forgotten
Introduction
The damage that perpetual retention of personal data can cause for 
individuals has been increasing. There are numerous examples of indi-
viduals being harmed. This has resulted in the enhanced argument 
for the ability of individual data subjects to have personal data erased. 
This is sometimes referred to as the right, or a right, to be forgot-
ten. This is particularly referenced recently in terms of personal data 
online. It is also sometimes abbreviated to RtbF.
Chapter  III, Section  3 of the General Data Protection Regulation 
(GDPR) refers to rectification and erasure. This was already an impor-
tant and topical issue and is now even more important on the foot of 
the Google Spain  case and also issues such as online abuse, age, when 
data may be placed online, age of data, and so on.
Background Guidance
An individual data subject should have the right to have personal data 
concerning them rectified and a “ right to be forgotten”  where the 
retention of such data infringes the GDPR or EU or member state 
law to which the controller is subject. In particular, an individual data 
subject should have the right to have their personal data erased and no 
longer processed where the personal data are no longer necessary in 
relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise pro-
cessed, where an individual data subject has withdrawn their consent 
or objects to the processing of personal data concerning them, or where 
the processing of their personal data does not otherwise comply with 
the GDPR. That right is relevant in particular where the individual 
data subject had given their consent as a child and was not fully aware 

198
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
of the risks involved by the processing, and later wants to remove such 
personal data, especially on the Internet. The individual data subject 
should be able to exercise that right notwithstanding the fact that he or 
she is no longer a child. However, the further retention of the personal 
data should be lawful where it is necessary for exercising the right of 
freedom of expression and information, for compliance with a legal 
obligation, for the performance of a task carried out in the public inter-
est or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, on 
the grounds of public interest in the area of public health, for archiving 
purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, 
or statistical purposes, or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of 
legal claims.* To strengthen the right to be forgotten in the online 
environment, the right to erasure should also be extended in such a 
way that a controller who has made the personal data public should be 
obliged to inform the controllers that are processing such personal data 
to erase any links to, or copies or replications of, those personal data. 
In doing so, that controller should take reasonable steps, taking into 
account available technology and the means available to the controller, 
including technical measures, to inform the controllers that are pro-
cessing the personal data of the individual data subject’ s request.†
One of the more important extensions and enhancements in the 
new data protection regime relates to the right to be forgotten: the 
“ right to be forgotten and to erasure, which consists of securing from 
the [data] controller the erasure of personal data as well as prevention 
of any further dissemination of [their] data.” ‡ (It is also said to inter-
face with the new right to data portability.§)
The right to be forgotten is even more enhanced in instances where 
the personal data was originally disclosed when the individual data

it is necessary for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information, for 
compliance with a legal obligation, for the performance of a task carried out in the

reasons of public interest in the area of public health, for archiving purposes in the 
public interest, or scientific and historical research purposes, or statistical purposes, 
or for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims; ibid.

subject was a child. Some commentators refer to the option of an 
entire “ clean slate.” *
Costa states
The use of data from social networks in employment contexts is a repre-
sentative example. Personal data such as photos taken in private contexts 
have been used to refuse job positions and fire people. But forgetfulness 
is larger. It is one dimension of how people deal with their own history, 
being related not only to leaving the past behind but also to living in 
the present without the threat of a kind of “ Miranda”  warning, where 
whatever you say can be used against you in the future. In this sense 
the right to be forgotten is closely related to entitlements of dignity 
and self-development. Once again, privacy appears as the pre-requisite 
of our liberties, assuring the possibility to freely express ourselves and 
move freely on the street.†
The right to be forgotten is most clearly associated with and related 
to the following in particular
•	 Where the personal data are no longer necessary in relation 
to the purposes for which they were originally collected and 
processed (and the associated finality principle).
•	 Where the individual data subject has withdrawn their con-
sent for processing.
•	 Where individual data subjects object to the processing of the 
personal data concerning them.
•	 Where the processing of the personal data does not comply 
with the GDPR.‡
The GDPR, and the right to be forgotten, “ amplifies the effective-
ness of data protection principles and rules.” §
Individual data subjects can have their data erased under the right 
to be forgotten when there is no compliance as well as where they sim-
ply withdraw their consent.¶ User control and individual data subject 
control are, therefore, enhanced.

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
The GDPR and right to be forgotten create the following compli-
ance obligations
•	 Erasing personal data and not processing it further.
•	 Informing third parties that the individual data subject has 
requested the deletion of the personal data.
•	 Taking responsibility for publication by third parties under 
the controller’ s authority.*
Legal Rule
Article 17(1) of the GDPR provides for the enhanced right to be for-
gotten and to erasure. This is known as the right to erasure and or 
right to be forgotten. It provides that the individual data subject must 
have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal 
data concerning them without undue delay, and the controller must 
have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where 
one of the following grounds applies
•	 The personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the 
purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.
•	 The individual data subject withdraws consent on which the 
processing is based,† and where there is no other legal ground 
for the processing.
•	 The individual data subject objects to the processing‡ and 
there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, 
or the individual data subject objects to the processing.§
•	 The personal data have been unlawfully processed.
•	 The personal data have to be erased for compliance with a 
legal obligation in EU or member state law to which the con-
troller is subject.
•	 The personal data have been collected in relation to the offer 
of information society services.¶

RIGHT TO ERASURE AND BE FORGOTTEN
The GDPR provides that where the controller has made the 
personal data public and is obliged to erase the personal data, the 
controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of 
implementation, must take reasonable steps, including technical mea-
sures, to inform controllers that are processing the personal data that 
the individual data subject has requested the erasure by such control-
lers of any links to, or copy or replication of, those personal data.
Article 17(3) of the GDPR provides that Article 17(1) and (2) will 
not apply to the extent that processing is necessary
•	 For exercising the right of freedom of expression and 
information.
•	 For compliance with a legal obligation that requires process-
ing by EU or member state law to which the controller is sub-
ject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public 
interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the 
controller.
•	 For reasons of public interest in the area of public health.*
•	 For archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or his-
torical research purposes, or statistical purposes† insofar as 
the right referred to is likely to render impossible or seriously 
impair the achievement of the objectives of that processing or.
•	 For the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.
There were obviously various amendments, and it must be agreed 
that the right to be forgotten is, or has been portrayed as, contentious, 
which would have been an issue during the process of negotiating the 
finalization of the GDPR.
The data subject has the right to obtain from the controller the 
erasure of personal data concerning them without undue delay, and 
the controller must have the obligation to erase personal data without 
undue delay, where one of the following grounds applies
•	 The personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the 
purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.
*	 In accordance with Article 9(2)(h) and (i) as well as Article 9(3).
†	 In accordance with Article 89(1).

In the Google Spain  case, the EU Court of Justice held that
Article  2(b) and (d) of [the DPD] …  are to be interpreted as meaning 
that, first, the activity of a search engine consisting in finding infor-
mation published or placed on the internet by third parties, indexing 
it automatically, storing it temporarily and, finally, making it avail-
able to internet users according to a particular order of preference must 
be classified as “ processing of personal data”  within the meaning of 
Article  2(b) when that information contains personal data and, second, 
the operator of the search engine must be regarded as the “ controller”  in 
respect of that processing, within the meaning of Article  2(d).
Article  4(1)(a) of [the DPD] is to be interpreted as meaning that pro-
cessing of personal data is carried out in the context of the activities of 
an establishment of the controller on the territory of a member state, 
within the meaning of that provision, when the operator of a search 
engine sets up in a member state a branch or subsidiary that is intended 
to promote and sell advertising space offered by that engine and that 
orientates its activity towards the inhabitants of that member state.‡

in a number of different locations with interested parties.
Synodinou† refers to the “ right to oblivion”  and notes in relation 
to her research that media interests are not immune to the right to 
be forgotten. Examples are given where cases have been successful in 
preventing particular media stories dragging up past events long after 
they had occurred, including court cases.‡ Indeed, many countries, 
such as Germany, Austria, Greece, Finland, Belgium, Hungary, the 
Netherlands, Poland, and Portugal, already anonymize party names 
from decisions and judgments.§ The right to be forgotten has also been 
recognized in France, Belgium, and elsewhere¶ It is also important to 
bear in mind that the GDPR introduces enhanced rights as regards 
deletion and being forgotten, and does not introduce such provisions 
de novo .

RIGHT TO ERASURE AND BE FORGOTTEN
Conclusion
One of the most important rights for organizations to be aware of 
and to provide compliance mechanisms for is the expanded right to 
erasure and right to be forgotten. Partly due to the parties involved, 
there has been a lot of media and public attention on this issue. This in 
turn has led to some contention. However, the issues involved and the 
concerns sought to be addressed are real. Arguably, this issue should 
not be as surprising or contentious as it sometimes appears.
KEY CONCEPTS 
The right to be forgotten has received substantial commercial 
and media attention following on from the Google Spain  case. 
However, the right has existed from some time and is included 
in the previous DPD95. Various national laws also refer to dele-
tion and right to be forgotten entitlements. The new GDPR 
enhances and makes the right more explicit. Organizations 
need to consider this issue in detail and must provide for com-
pliance— and processes and procedures— as appropriate to the 
organization, its activities, its services, and its business partners, 
and most importantly, the types of data and data interests that 
can be affected.
KEY WORDS 
•	 Enhanced right.
•	 Right to erasure.
•	 Right to be forgotten.
•	 Right to obtain and have organization erase personal data.
•	 Must erase without undue delay.
•	 Detailed rules and grounds apply.
•	 Rights and interests to be protected.

Right to Restriction 
of Processing
Introduction
Individual data subjects have a right to restrict the processing of per-
sonal data by organizations relating to them. Individuals have a right 
not to be subject to processing about them.
Background Guidance
The individual data subject should have the right not to be subject to 
a decision, which may include a measure, evaluating personal aspects 
relating to them, which is based solely on automated processing and 
which produces legal effects concerning them or similarly significantly 
affects them, such as automatic refusal of an online credit application 
or e-recruiting practices without any human intervention. Such pro-
cessing includes “ profiling”  that consists of any form of automated 
processing of personal data evaluating the personal aspects relating to 
a natural person, in particular to analyze or predict aspects concern-
ing the individual data subject’ s performance at work, economic situ-
ation, health, personal preferences or interests, reliability or behavior, 
location, or movements, where it produces legal effects concerning 
them or similarly significantly affects them.*
However, decision-making based on such processing, including 
profiling, should be allowed where expressly authorized by EU or 
member state law to which the controller is subject, including for fraud 
and tax-evasion monitoring and prevention purposes conducted in 
accordance with the regulations, standards, and recommendations of 
EU institutions or national oversight bodies and to ensure the security 
and reliability of a service provided by the controller, or necessary for 
*	 GDPR Recital 71.

210
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
the entering or performance of a contract between the individual data 
subject and a controller, or when the individual data subject has given 
their explicit consent. In any case, such processing should be subject to 
suitable safeguards, which should include specific information to the 
individual data subject and the right to obtain human intervention, to 
express their point of view, to obtain an explanation of the decision 
reached after such assessment, and to challenge the decision.*
Such measures should not concern a child. To ensure fair and trans-
parent processing in respect of the individual data subject, taking into 
account the specific circumstances and context in which the personal 
data are processed, the controller should use appropriate mathematical 
or statistical procedures for the profiling; implement technical and orga-
nizational measures appropriate to ensure, in particular, that factors that 
result in inaccuracies in personal data are corrected and the risk of errors 
is minimized; and secure personal data in a manner that takes account 
of the potential risks involved for the interests and rights of the individ-
ual data subject and that prevents, inter alia , discriminatory effects on 
natural persons on the basis of racial or ethnic origin, political opinion, 
religion or beliefs, trade union membership, genetic or health status, 
or sexual orientation, or that results in measures having such an effect. 
Automated decision-making and profiling based on special categories of 
personal data should be allowed only under specific conditions.†
Background Guidance on Methods to Restrict Processing
Methods by which to restrict the processing of personal data could 
include, inter alia , temporarily moving the selected data to another 
processing system, making the selected personal data unavailable 
to users, or temporarily removing published data from a website. In 
automated filing systems, the restriction of processing should in prin-
ciple be ensured by technical means in such a manner that the per-
sonal data are not subject to further processing operations and cannot 
be changed. The fact that the processing of personal data is restricted 
should be clearly indicated in the system.‡

†	 GDPR Recital 71.
‡	 GDPR Recital 67.

211
RIGHT TO RESTRICTION OF PROCESSING
Legal Rule
Article 18 of the new GDPR includes a new section on the right to 
restriction of processing. The individual data subject must have the 
right to obtain from the controller restriction of processing where one 
of the following applies
•	 The accuracy of the personal data is contested by the individ-
ual data subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify 
the accuracy of the personal data.
•	 The processing is unlawful, and the individual data subject 
opposes the erasure of the personal data and requests the 
restriction of their use instead.
•	 The controller no longer needs the personal data for the pur-
poses of the processing, but they are required by the indi-
vidual data subject for the establishment, exercise, or defense 
of legal claims.
•	 The individual data subject has objected to processing* pend-
ing the verification of whether the legitimate grounds of the 
controller override those of the individual data subject.
Where processing has been restricted under one of these condi-
tions, such personal data must, with the exception of storage, only be 
processed with the individual data subject’ s consent, or for the estab-
lishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims, or for the protection of 
the rights of another natural or legal person, or for reasons of impor-
tant public interest of the EU or of a member state.
An individual data subject who has obtained restriction of process-
ing pursuant to the above must be informed by the controller before 
the restriction of processing is lifted.
Conclusion
Perhaps more important from a practical perspective for organiza-
tions is not the right to be forgotten, but the right of the individual 
data subject to have data processing in relation to them restricted. 
This is wider in ambit, both potentially and in practice, than the right 
*	 Pursuant to Article 21(1).

212
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
to be forgotten. Separate processes and procedures must be in place 
to deal with objections and requests as regards restricted processing 
issues.
KEY CONCEPTS 
There may be instances where, apart from erasure and right to 
be forgotten, an individual data subject may prefer that the pro-
cessing of their personal data is confined or restricted. They may 
enforce a right to have such restriction apply.
KEY WORDS 
•	 New provision.
•	 Right to restriction of processing.
•	 Right to have organizations restrict processing.
•	 Contested accuracy of personal data.
•	 Verifying accuracy of personal data.
•	 Unlawful processing.
•	 Data subject opposes erasure but requests restriction of pro-
cessing instead.
•	 Organization no longer needs the personal data, but indi-
vidual data subject needs them for establishment, exercise, or 
defense of legal claims.
•	 Individual data subject has objected to processing.
•	 Verification of legitimate grounds versus right of individual 
data subject.
•	 Restricted personal data must, excepting storage, only be pro-
cessed with the individual data subject’ s consent, or for the 
establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims, or for the 
protection of the rights.
•	 Once data are restricted, individual data subject must be 
informed by organization before the restriction is lifted.

Right to Object 
to Processing
Introduction
Individuals can object to processing relating to them. This is also 
something that individual data subjects were entitled to under the 
prior data protection regime.
Background Guidance
Background Recital 50 states that where the data subject has given 
consent or the processing is based on EU or member state law that 
constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic 
society to safeguard, in particular, important objectives of general 
public interest, the controller should be allowed to further process 
the personal data irrespective of the compatibility of the purposes. In 
any case, the application of the principles set out in the General Data 
Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in particular the information of 
the data subject on those other purposes and on their rights, including 
the right to object, should be ensured. Indicating possible criminal 
acts or threats to public security by the controller and transmitting the 
relevant personal data in individual cases or in several cases relating 
to the same criminal act or threats to public security to a competent 
authority should be regarded as being in the legitimate interest pur-
sued by the controller. However, such transmission in the legitimate 
interest of the controller or further processing of personal data should 
be prohibited if the processing is not compatible with a legal, profes-
sional, or other binding obligation of secrecy.
Background Recital 59 states that modalities should be provided for 
facilitating the exercise of the data subject’ s rights under the GDPR, 
including mechanisms to request and, if applicable, obtain, free of 
charge, in particular, access to and rectification or erasure of personal 

214
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
data and the exercise of the right to object. The controller should also 
provide means for requests to be made electronically, especially where 
personal data are processed by electronic means. The controller should 
be obliged to respond to requests from the data subject without undue 
delay and at the latest within one  month and to give reasons where 
the controller does not intend to comply with any such requests.
Background Recital 65 states that a data subject should have the 
right to have personal data concerning them rectified and a “ right to 
be forgotten”  where the retention of such data infringes this GDPR 
or EU or member state law to which the controller is subject. In par-
ticular, a data subject should have the right to have their personal data 
erased and no longer processed where the personal data are no longer 
necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are collected or 
otherwise processed, where a data subject has withdrawn their con-
sent or objects to the processing of personal data concerning them, or 
where the processing of their personal data does not otherwise comply 
with the GDPR. That right is relevant in particular where the data 
subject had given their consent as a child and was not fully aware of 
the risks involved by the processing, and later wants to remove such 
personal data, especially on the Internet. The data subject should be 
able to exercise that right notwithstanding the fact that he or she is 
no longer a child. However, the further retention of the personal data 
should be lawful where it is necessary for exercising the right of free-
dom of expression and information, for compliance with a legal obli-
gation, for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest 
or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, on the 
grounds of public interest in the area of public health, for archiving 
purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research pur-
poses, or statistical purposes, or for the establishment, exercise, or 
defense of legal claims.
Background Recital 69 states that where personal data might law-
fully be processed because processing is necessary for the performance 
of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of offi-
cial authority vested in the controller, or on grounds of the legitimate 
interests of a controller or a third party, a data subject should, nev-
ertheless, be entitled to object to the processing of any personal data 
relating to their particular situation. It should be for the controller 

215
RIGHT TO OBJECT TO PROCESSING
to demonstrate that its compelling legitimate interest overrides the 
interests or the fundamental rights of the data subject.
Background Recital 70 states that where personal data are pro-
cessed for the purposes of direct marketing, the data subject should 
have the right to object to such processing, including profiling to the 
extent that it is related to such direct marketing, whether with regard 
to initial or further processing, at any time and free of charge. That 
right should be explicitly brought to the attention of the data subject 
and presented clearly and separately from any other information.
Background Recital 73 states that restrictions concerning specific 
principles and the rights of information, access to, and rectification 
or erasure of personal data; the right to data portability; the right to 
object; decisions based on profiling; as well as the communication of 
a personal data breach to a data subject and certain related obligations 
of the controllers may be imposed by EU or member state law, as far 
as necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard 
public security, including the protection of human life, especially in 
response to natural or manmade disasters; the prevention, investiga-
tion, and prosecution of criminal offenses or the execution of criminal 
penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of 
threats to public security, or of breaches of ethics for regulated profes-
sions; other important objectives of general public interest of the EU 
or of a member state, in particular an important economic or financial 
interest of the EU or of a member state; the keeping of public registers 
for reasons of general public interest; further processing of archived 
personal data to provide specific information related to the political 
behavior under former totalitarian state regimes or the protection of 
the data subject or the rights of others, including social protection, 
public health, and humanitarian purposes. Those restrictions should 
be in accordance with the requirements set out in the Charter and in 
the Human Rights Convention.
Legal Rule
Article 21 of the GDPR refers to the right to object. The individ-
ual data subject must have the right to object, on grounds relating to 
their particular situation, at any time to processing of personal data 

216
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
concerning them that is based on Article 6(1)(e) or (f), including pro-
filing based on those provisions. The controller must no longer pro-
cess the personal data unless the controller demonstrates compelling 
legitimate grounds for the processing that override the interests or 
rights of the individual data subject or for the establishment, exercise, 
or defense of legal claims.*
Where personal data are processed for direct marketing purposes, 
the individual data subject must have the right to object at any time 
to processing of personal data concerning them for such marketing, 
which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct 
marketing.† Where the individual data subject objects to processing 
for direct marketing purposes, the personal data must no longer be 
processed for such purposes.‡ At the latest at the time of the first com-
munication with the individual data subject, this right must be explic-
itly brought to the attention of the individual data subject and must be 
presented clearly and separately from any other information.§
In the context of the use of information society services, and not-
withstanding the ePrivacy Directive, the individual data subject may 
exercise their right to object by automated means using technical 
specifications.¶
Where personal data are processed for scientific or historical 
research purposes or statistical purposes pursuant to Article 89(1), the 
individual data subject, on grounds relating to their particular situa-
tion, must have the right to object to processing of personal data con-
cerning them, unless the processing is necessary for the performance 
of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.**

RIGHT TO OBJECT TO PROCESSING
Conclusion
Organizations need to assess and implement procedures for the right 
to object by individual data subjects. This requires nuanced assess-
ment and appropriate processes and procedures in advance.
KEY CONCEPTS 
Individuals have a right to object to data processing, and orga-
nizations must prepare for and comply with these detailed 
provisions.
KEY WORDS 
•	 Right to object to processing on grounds relating to individ-

Notification Obligation 
regarding Rectification, 
Erasure, or Restriction
Introduction
There is also a right dealing with those instances where changes and 
correction may have been made, and where the data may be in the 
possession of more than one organization.
One organization may have corrected or erased particular data, but 
the second organization may not, unless there is a mechanism for the 
second organization to become aware of the need to update its data-
base also.
Legal Rule
Article 19 of the new GDPR includes a new section regarding noti-
fication obligation regarding rectification, erasure, or restriction. The 
controller must communicate any rectification or erasure of personal 
data or restriction of processing carried out in accordance with Article 
16 (i.e., right to rectification), Article 17(1) (i.e., right to erasure, right 
to be forgotten) and Article 18 (i.e., right to restriction of process-
ing) to each recipient to whom the personal data have been disclosed, 
unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. The 
controller must inform the individual data subject about those recipi-
ents if the individual data subject requests it.
Conclusion
Where rectification, erasure, or a restriction applies, it may be that the 
relevant data are also held, having been transferred onwards by the 
organization, in a secondary organization. In those instances there

is, therefore, a corresponding or complementary right or obligation to 
have the third-party organization also notified of the change in status 
of the data.
KEY CONCEPTS 
There is a right to rectification, erasure, and restriction of per-
sonal data. This applied to the original personal data held by the 
organization. There is, therefore, a corresponding notification 
obligation to ensure that third-party recipients of the data are 
made aware of the changes and the need for them to make the 
corresponding changes also. In addition, the organization must 
provide details regarding the third parties to the individual data 
subject once so requested.
KEY WORDS 
•	 Notification obligation regarding rectification, erasure, or 
restriction.
•	 Organization must communicate any rectification or erasure 
of personal data or processing restriction to each data recipient.
•	 Unless impossible or disproportionate effort.
•	 Organization must inform individual data subject about 
recipients if requested.

Right against Automated 
Individual Decisions 
and Profiling
Introduction
Increasingly, organizations rely on automation and automated deci-
sion-making (including profiling). However, there is a concern when 
this brings the potential for decisions to be made using automated 
decisions regarding individuals. One of the concerns is that adverse 
decisions can arise, which may or may not be correct, and there is no 
human oversight or input to the decision, and no ability to find and 
correct incorrect automated decisions. There is also wide concern over 
the data protection impact of increased profiling techniques.*
This is essentially a right to object to automated individual decision-
making (including profiling). Individual data subjects have a right not 
to be subjected to automated decision-taking processes. This refers 
to decisions taken in relation to and affecting individuals but that 
are computer-based and automated, and that occur without human 
intervention. An example would be a financial institution making a 
credit application decision by automated computer without oversight 
by personnel of the institution. This is not the only instance of such 
automated decisions, however. Indeed, such instances may be increas-
ing.† (Also note comments on the right to be forgotten.)
Chapter  III, Section  4 of the new General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR) refers to the right to object to automated indi-
vidual decision-making.
*	 This is in the EU as well as the United States (and elsewhere). From a US per-
spective, see Roethlisberger, “ Someone Is Watching: The Need for Enhanced Data 
Protection,”  Hastings Law Journal (2011) (62:6) 1793.

decisions. DPD95 Articles 15.

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
Background Guidance on Profiling
Profiling is subject to the rules of the GDPR governing the process-
ing of personal data, such as the legal grounds for processing or data 
protection principles. The European Data Protection Board (EDPB), 
established by the GDPR, should be able to issue guidance in that 
context.* Restrictions concerning specific principles and the rights of 
information, access to, and rectification or erasure of personal data; 
the right to data portability; the right to object; decisions based on 
profiling; as well as the communication of a personal data breach to a 
data subject and certain related obligations of the controllers may be 
imposed by EU or member state law, as far as necessary and propor-
tionate in a democratic society to safeguard public security, includ-
ing the protection of human life, especially in response to natural or 
manmade disasters; the prevention, investigation, and prosecution of 
criminal offenses or the execution of criminal penalties, including the 
safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security, 
or of breaches of ethics for regulated professions; other important 
objectives of general public interest of the EU or of a member state, 
in particular an important economic or financial interest of the EU 
or of a member state; the keeping of public registers for reasons of 
general public interest; further processing of archived personal data 
to provide specific information related to the political behavior under 
former totalitarian state regimes or the protection of the data subject 
or the rights of others, including social protection, public health, and 
humanitarian purposes. Those restrictions should be in accordance 
with the requirements set out in the EU Charter and in the Human 
Rights Convention.†
Legal Rule
The new GDPR provides that the individual data subject must have 
the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated

DECISIONS AND PROFILING
processing, including profiling, that produces legal effects concerning 
them or similarly significantly affects them.*
Article 20(1) must not apply if the decision
•	 Is necessary for entering into, or performance of, a contract 
between the individual data subject and a data controller [a]
or
•	 Is authorized by EU or member state law to which the con-
troller is subject and that also lays down suitable measures to 
safeguard the individual data subject’ s rights and legitimate 
interests
or
•	 Is based on the individual data subject’ s explicit consent 
(Article 22(c)) [c]
In cases referred to in Article 22(2)(a) and (c), the controller must 
implement suitable measures to safeguard the individual data sub-
ject’ s rights and legitimate interests, at least the right to obtain human 
intervention on the part of the controller, to express their point of 
view, and to contest the decision.†
Decisions referred to in paragraph 2 must not be based on special 
categories of personal data,‡ unless Article 9(2)(a) or (g) applies and 
suitable measures to safeguard the individual data subject’ s rights and 
legitimate interests are in place.§
Conclusion
An increasing number of data decisions in relation to individuals 
occur in an automated manner. Where there is potential for adverse 
decision as a result, rights exist for individuals to check these decisions 
and processes. Organizations should assess where such potential deci-
sions or processes may occur within the organization. Arguably, this 
could be one of the more difficult issues for organizations to deal with.

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
KEY CONCEPTS 
There is an increase in automated computer decisions and pro-
cesses. The concern that some of these, which involve individuals 
and their personal data, may occur in an adverse manner or cre-
ate an adverse impact is recognized in the GDPR. Individuals 
have a right not to be subject to such automated decisions. How 
this works in practice, given the increased reliance on such pro-
cesses and the recent advent of Big Data processes, remains to 
be fully seen.

•	 Right not to be subject to a decision based solely on auto-
mated processing.

Right to Prevent Direct 
Marketing Processing
Introduction
Individual data subjects have a right to prevent processing for direct 
marketing purposes. Where personal data are kept for the purpose of 
direct marketing, the individual data subject concerned can request 
the controller in writing
•	 Not to process the data for that purpose; or
•	 To cease processing the data for that purpose.
If requested to cease processing, the controller, not more than a 
specified number of days after the request, must erase the data; and 
where the data are kept for that purpose and other purposes, cease 
processing the data for that purpose. The controller must notify the 
individual data subject in writing and, where appropriate, inform 
them of those other purposes.
Where a controller anticipates that personal data, including per-
sonal data that are required by law to be made available to the public, 
will be processed for the purposes of direct marketing, the control-
ler must inform the persons to whom the data relates that they may 
object, by means of a request in writing to the controller and free of 
charge, to such processing.
Background Guidance
Where personal data are processed for the purposes of direct market-
ing, the individual data subject should have the right to object to such 
processing, including profiling to the extent that it is related to such 
direct marketing, whether with regard to initial or further processing, 
at any time and free of charge. That right should be explicitly brought 

226
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
to the attention of the individual data subject and presented clearly 
and separately from any other information.*
Legal Rule
Article 21 of the GDPR refers as follows. Where personal data are 
processed for direct marketing purposes, the data subject must have 
the right to object at any time to processing of personal data concern-
ing them for such marketing, which includes profiling to the extent 
that it is related to such direct marketing.
Where the data subject objects to processing for direct market-
ing purposes, the personal data must no longer be processed for such 
purposes.
This has significant consequence, given that marketing is so central 
to many organizations.
Conclusion
Marketing and direct marketing are very important for many orga-
nizations. However, the ability to engage in marketing to known 
individuals is not unlimited. For example, industry codes may apply. 
In addition, the data protection regime provides that individual data 
subjects have a right to object (in advance) to and not be subject to 
direct marketing.
*	 GDPR Recital 70.
KEY CONCEPTS 
Direct marketing is a concern for the public, consumer bodies, 
and regulators. There are restrictions or controls on the extent 
to which organizations operate marketing data. In terms of data 
protection, the rule is that individual data subjects have a right 
to object to data protection for use in direct marketing activities.

227

marketing.
•	 Includes profiling for direct marketing.
•	 Can object at any time.

Portability
Introduction
The GDPR includes a new right to data portability for individual data 
subjects. The difficulties experienced by individuals seeking to move 
from one (technology) service provider to another when the first orga-
nization may be unable or unwilling to transfer the necessary cus-
tomer personal data to the alternative service provider are recognized. 
This is referred to as porting  or portability .
Background Guidance on Automated Processing and Portability
To further strengthen the control over their own data, where the pro-
cessing of personal data is carried out by automated means, the indi-
vidual data subject should also be allowed to receive personal data 
concerning them, which they have provided to a controller, in a struc-
tured, commonly used, machine-readable and interoperable format, 
and to transmit them to another controller. Controllers should be 
encouraged to develop interoperable formats that enable data portabil-
ity. That right should apply where the individual data subject provided 
the personal data on the basis of their consent, or the processing is 
necessary for the performance of a contract. It should not apply where 
processing is based on a legal ground other than consent or contract. 
By its very nature, that right should not be exercised against control-
lers processing personal data in the exercise of their public duties. It 
should therefore not apply where the processing of the personal data is 
necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the control-
ler is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public 
interest or in the exercise of an official authority vested in the control-
ler. The individual data subject’ s right to transmit or receive personal 
data concerning them should not create an obligation for the con-
trollers to adopt or maintain processing systems that are technically 

230
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
compatible. Where, in a certain set of personal data, more than one 
individual data subject is concerned, the right to receive the personal 
data should be without prejudice to the rights of other individual data 
subjects in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation 
(GDPR). Furthermore, that right should not prejudice the right of the 
individual data subject to obtain the erasure of personal data and the 
limitations of that right as set out in the GDPR and should, in partic-
ular, not imply the erasure of personal data concerning the individual 
data subject that have been provided by them for the performance 
of a contract to the extent that and for as long as the personal data 
are necessary for the performance of that contract. Where technically 
feasible, the individual data subject should have the right to have the 
personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another.*
Legal Rule
Article 20 of the new GDPR refers to the right to data portability. 
The individual data subject must have the right to receive the per-
sonal data concerning them, which they have provided to a controller, 
in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and 
have the right to transmit those data to another controller without 
hindrance from the controller to which the personal data have been 
provided, where
•	 The processing is based on consent pursuant to Article 6(1)
(a) or Article 9(2)(a) or on a contract pursuant to Article 6(1)
(b); and
•	 The processing is carried out by automated means.
In exercising their right to data portability pursuant to the above, 
the individual data subject must have the right to have the personal 
data transmitted directly from one controller to another where tech-
nically feasible.† It remains to be seen how this will apply in practice, 
and also more nuanced issues, such as how it may apply differently 
across different industries.
*	 GDPR Recital 68.
†	 GDPR Article 20(2).

231
PORTABILITY
The exercise of this right must be without prejudice to Article 17. 
That right must not apply to processing necessary for the performance 
of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official 
authority vested in the controller.* The portability right referred to 
must not adversely affect the rights of others.†
Conclusion
Organizations, particularly those in service sectors, need to accom-
modate competitors and individuals when they wish to change service 
providers by allowing the transfer of customer histories and personal 
data to the new service provider. Otherwise, the blocking of such data 
portability can mean that the new provider does not have enough 
information to actually provide the service, thus blocking the change-
over. Portability and the portability right will become ever more 
important as telephone (fixed and mobile), technology, and other ser-
vices continue to advance.
*	 GDPR Article 20(3).
†	 GDPR Article 20(4).
KEY CONCEPTS 
Across all industries, especially service industries, competition 
means that customers will move from one provider organiza-
tion to another over time. However, a difficulty can arise where 
certain historical personal data of the customer in the possession 
of the original service provider organization are not made avail-
able or transferred to the new service provider. The new provider 
may need these data to provide the service. The move to the 
new provider can be prevented if the original provider refuses 
or otherwise does not facilitate the data transfer. A right to the 
transfer, portability, or porting of the personal data to the new 
provider is granted to the individual data subject.

Outsourcing to Third-
Party Data Processors
Introduction
While many organizations may feel that they do not engage third 
parties to deal with their personal data, processes, and databases, 
closer inspection often indicates that this assumption is not correct. 
Many organizations, across all sectors of activity, engage third parties 
or outsource certain of their internal activities.*
One example is where an organization may find it more convenient 
to outsource its payroll functions to another organization specializing 
in such activities. It is necessary, therefore, that the employee personal 
data, or certain of them, are transferred to the third-party organi-
zation for processing. This third party is a processor acting for the 
organization. A contract must be in place and appropriate security 
standards implemented.
Sometimes, organizations outsource other activities, such as 
marketing, recruitment, or employment of consultants or agents or 
part-time employees. Organizations increasingly outsource market 
research and customer satisfaction surveys to third parties. These are 
all processors for which personal data are involved.
If an organization must transfer or export personal data outside of 
the EU and lawfully permit transfers outside of the restriction ban, it 
must satisfy the following, as appropriate
•	 An export to one of the safe permitted countries; or
•	 An export to the United States under the new Safe Harbor 
program; or

Data Processors and Data Sharers,”  Computers and Law (March 4, 2011).

234
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
•	 An export pursuant to the accepted standard contractual 
clauses; or
•	 An export pursuant to the accepted binding corporate rules.
Background Guidance
To ensure compliance with the requirements of the GDPR in respect 
of the processing to be carried out by the processor on behalf of the 
controller, when entrusting a processor with processing activities, the 
controller should use only processors providing sufficient guarantees, 
in particular in terms of expert knowledge, reliability, and resources, 
to implement technical and organizational measures that will meet 
the requirements of the GDPR, including for the security of process-
ing. The adherence of the processor to an approved code of conduct 
or an approved certification mechanism may be used as an element to 
demonstrate compliance with the obligations of the controller. The 
carrying-out of processing by a processor should be governed by a 
contract or other legal act under EU or member state law, binding 
the processor to the controller and setting out the subject matter and 
duration of the processing, the nature and purposes of the processing, 
the type of personal data, and categories of individual data subjects, 
taking into account the specific tasks and responsibilities of the pro-
cessor in the context of the processing to be carried out and the risk 
to the rights of the individual data subject. The controller and pro-
cessor may choose to use an individual contract or standard contrac-
tual clauses that are adopted either directly by the EU Commission 
or by a data protection supervisory authority in accordance with the 
consistency mechanism and then adopted by the EU Commission. 
After the completion of the processing on behalf of the controller, the 
processor should, at the choice of the controller, return or delete the 
personal data, unless there is a requirement to store the personal data 
under EU or member state law to which the processor is subject.*
Where processing is to be carried out on behalf of a controller, the 
controller must use only processors providing sufficient guarantees to 
implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in such 
a manner that processing will meet the requirements of the General 
*	 GDPR Recital 81.

OUTSOURCING
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and ensure the protection of the 
rights of the individual data subject.*
The processor must not engage another processor without the prior 
specific or general written authorization of the controller. In the case 
of general written authorization, the processor must inform the con-
troller of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement 
of other processors, thereby giving the controller the opportunity to 
object to such changes.†
Processing by a processor must be governed by a contract or other 
legal act under EU or member state law, which is binding on the pro-
cessor with regard to the controller and which sets out the subject 
matter and duration of the processing, the nature and purpose of the 
processing, the type of personal data and categories of individual data 
subjects, and the obligations and rights of the controller. That contract 
or other legal act must stipulate, in particular, that the processor
•	 Processes the personal data only on documented instructions 
from the controller, including with regard to transfers of per-
sonal data to a third country or an international organization, 
unless required to do so by EU or member state law to which 
the processor is subject; in such a case, the processor must 
inform the controller of that legal requirement before process-
ing, unless that law prohibits such information on important 
grounds of public interest.
•	 Ensures that persons authorized to process the personal data 
have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an 
appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.
•	 Takes all measures required pursuant to Article 32.
•	 Respects the conditions referred to in paragraphs 2 and 4 for 
engaging another processor.
•	 Taking into account the nature of the processing, assists the 
controller by appropriate technical and organizational mea-
sures, insofar as this is possible, for the fulfillment of the 
controller’ s obligation to respond to requests for exercis-
ing the individual data subject’ s rights laid down in GDPR 
Chapter  III.

•	 Assists the controller in ensuring compliance with the obliga-
tions pursuant to Articles 32 to 36 taking into account the 
nature of processing and the information available to the 
processor.
•	 At the choice of the controller, deletes or returns all the per-
sonal data to the controller after the end of the provision of 
services relating to processing, and deletes existing copies 
unless EU or member state law requires storage of the per-
sonal data.
•	 Makes available to the controller all information necessary 
to demonstrate compliance with the obligations laid down in 
this Article and allow for and contribute to audits, including 
inspections, conducted by the controller or another auditor 
mandated by the controller. (The processor must immedi-
ately inform the controller if, in its opinion, an instruction 
infringes the GDPR or other EU or member state data pro-
tection provisions).*
Legal Rule
Where a processor engages another processor for carrying out specific 
processing activities on behalf of the controller, the same data protec-
tion obligations as set out in the contract or other legal act between 
the controller and the processor as referred to in paragraph 3 must be 
imposed on that other processor by way of a contract or other legal 
act under EU or member state law, in particular providing sufficient 
guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational 
measures in such a manner that the processing will meet the require-
ments of the GDPR. Where that other processor fails to fulfill its 
data protection obligations, the initial processor must remain fully 
liable to the controller for the performance of that other processor’ s 
obligations.†

Without prejudice to an individual contract between the control-
ler and the processor, the contract or the other legal act referred to in 
paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article may be based, in whole or in part, 
on standard contractual clauses referred to in paragraphs 7 and 8 of

to personal data must not process them except on instructions from 
the controller, unless required to do so by EU or member state law.
Processors and Security
Processors also have obligations in relation to processing personal 
data and security. Where the processing of personal data is carried out 
by a processor on behalf of a controller, then the controller must have 
a contract in writing in place with the processor, containing certain 
clauses and obligations. The contracts with processors must address 
the following
•	 The processing must be carried out in pursuance of a contract 
in writing or another equivalent form.
•	 The contract must provide that the processor carries out the 
processing only on, and subject to, the instructions of the 
controller.
•	 The processor must comply with the “ security”  requirements.
There are also certain other requirements. The controller
•	 Must ensure that the processor provides sufficient guarantees 
in respect of the technical security measures and organiza-
tional measures governing the processing.
•	 Must take reasonable steps to ensure compliance with these 
measures.
Processors also have compliance obligations under the new GDPR.
New Processor Requirements
The new GDPR explicitly refers to processors. Chapter  IV of the new 
GDPR is headed “ Controller and processor.”  Processors from outside 
of the EU may have to designate a representative in the EU.* Article 
26 of the GDPR is headed as referring to processors. It provides that 
where processing is to be carried out on behalf of a controller, the 
controller shall use only processors providing sufficient guarantees to 
implement appropriate technical and organizational measures in such 
*	 GDPR Article 27.

239
OUTSOURCING
a manner that processing will meet the requirements of the GDPR 
and ensure the protection of the rights of the individual data subject.*
It should be noted, therefore, that there is no discretion left for 
organizations. They “ shall”  or must comply as regards the new 
requirements. The data controller organization must ensure that there 
is proper compliance. It follows also that the controller is responsible 
when there is non-compliance, or indeed, insufficient compliance.
The processor organization (or individual, e.g., outsource contrac-
tor) must also comply with the data protection regime. Security is the 
most obvious example. However, there are other obligations.
Controller Records
Each controller and, where applicable, the controller’ s representative 
shall maintain a record of processing activities under its responsibility. 
That record shall contain all of the following information
•	 The name and contact details of the controller and, where 
applicable, the joint controller, the controller’ s representative, 
and the data protection officer.
•	 The purposes of the processing.
•	 A description of the categories of individual data subjects and 
of the categories of personal data.
•	 The categories of recipients to whom the personal data have 
been or will be disclosed, including recipients in third coun-

•	 Where applicable, transfers of personal data to a third country 
or an international organization, including the identification 
of that third country or international organization and, in the 
case of transfers referred to in the second subparagraph of 
Article 49(1), the documentation of suitable safeguards.

Conclusion
It is also important that the organization undertakes ongoing assess-
ments and checks regarding the operation of the data processing 
undertaken by the processor. This should also include the security 
and compliance measures. This will be an increasing issue as personal 
data continues to expand in the online environment.
KEY CONCEPTS 
Organizations need to be aware that they need to be responsible 
about what data they transfer to third-party organizations on 
their behalf. While this is permitted, appropriate contractual 
documentation must be in place. Safeguards must be in place 
also. Records must be maintained. Organizations should con-
sider that they need to be alerted by the third-party processor if 
and when problems arise, such as a data breach. Another consid-
eration is whether there are limits on the transfer to ensure that 
only the data that are necessary for the particular task or activity 
are transferred; that is, that there is no over-sharing or disclosure 
of too much data. The respective tasks should be clearly under-
stood and delineated in writing. Escalation points and contact 
points should be clearly known.

Children
Introduction
The issue of children in the data protection regime has been steadily 
rising. The increased use of social media and Web 2.0 services 
enhances the exposures and risks for children and the uninitiated.* 
These concerns are expressed by children’ s groups, regulators, and 
also the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party (WP29) (now 
replaced by the European Data Protection Board [EDPB]). WP29 
issued “ Opinion on the Protection of Children’ s Personal Data 
(General Guidelines and the Special Case of Schools)” † and also 
“ Working Document on the Protection of Children’ s Personal Data 
(General Guidelines and the Special Case of Schools).” ‡ Schools are 
being encouraged to be proactive and to have appropriate codes and 
policies for children’ s social media and Internet usage.§
There is now going to be an explicit acknowledgement of children’ s 
interest in the EU data protection regime, unlike with the 1995 data 
protection directive (DPD95), which contained no explicit reference. 
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) originally  defined 
a child as any person below the age of 16  years. This is significant, 
among other things, in relation to consent, contracting, and so on.

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
It is also significant for social networks that have significant numbers 
of children. Up until now it has been common for certain social net-
works to aim to accept users only over the age of 13. Now that a child 
has been defined in the first version of the GDPR as up to 16 (but 
later reduced), this may require careful assessment in relation to social 
media contracts, terms, processes, sign ups, and so on.
The issue of children in the data protection regime has been 
steadily rising. The increased use of social media and Web 2.0 services 
enhances the exposures and risks for children and the uninitiated.* 
Children merit specific protection with regard to their personal data, 
as they may be less aware of the risks, consequences, and safeguards 
concerned and their rights in relation to the processing of personal 
data. Such specific protection should, in particular, apply to the use 
of personal data of children for the purposes of marketing or creating 
personality or user profiles and the collection of personal data with 
regard to children when using services offered directly to a child. The 
consent of the holder of parental responsibility should not be neces-
sary in the context of preventive or counseling services offered directly 
to a child.† Given that children merit specific protection, any infor-
mation and communication, where processing is addressed to a child, 
should be in such clear and plain language that the child can easily 
understand it.‡ The GDPR makes new provisions in relation to condi-
tions for children’ s consent for information society services.

Legal Rules
It is important for organizations to note the definition of “ child”  in 
the GDPR. This will have implications for how organizations
•	 Consider the interaction with children and what personal 
data may be collected and processed
•	 Ensure that there is appropriate compliance for such collec-
tion and processing for children as distinct from adults
Age
Article 6, referring to the lawfulness of processing or the legitimate 
processing conditions, provides that processing is necessary for the 
purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a 
third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests 
or fundamental rights of the individual data subject, which require 
protection of personal data, “ in particular where the data subject is a 
child.” ‡

246
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
The original EU Commission proposal for the GDPR defined a 
“ child”  as any person below the age of 18  years. This is significant in 
relation to consent, contracting, and so on. It is significant for social 
networks that have significant numbers of children. Up until now it 
has been common for certain social networks to accept users only over 
the age of 13. Defining a child as up to 18 necessitated careful assess-
ment in relation to social media contracts, terms, processes, registra-
tions, sign ups, and so on. However, the final agreed version of the 
GDPR refers instead to a child “ below the age of 16  years”  with the 
option for member states to refer to 13  years. This is in Article 8, 
which is an Article other than the definitions section.*
Article 8 of the final version of the GDPR contains particular pro-
visions in relation to the processing of the personal data of a child. 
Article 8(1) provides that
	
where the individual data subject must have the right to obtain 
from the controller restriction of processing where one of the 
following applies
•	 The accuracy of the personal data is contested by the individ-
ual data subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify 
the accuracy of the personal data.
•	 The processing is unlawful, and the individual data subject 
opposes the erasure of the personal data and requests the 
restriction of their use instead.
•	 The controller no longer needs the personal data for the pur-
poses of the processing, but they are required by the indi-
vidual data subject for the establishment, exercise, or defense 
of legal claims.
•	 The individual data subject has objected to processing pursu-
ant to Article 21(1) pending the verification of whether the 
legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the 
individual data subject.
*	 Note general commentary at Jasmontaite and De Hert, “ The EU, Children under 
13  Years, and Parental Consent: A Human Rights Analysis of a New, Age-Based 
Bright-Line for the Protection of Children on the Internet,”  International Data 
Privacy Law (2014) (5:1) 20.

247
CHILDREN
Where processing has been restricted under this rule, such personal 
data must, with the exception of storage, only be processed with the 
individual data subject’ s consent, or for the establishment, exercise, or 
defense of legal claims, or for the protection of the rights of another 
natural or legal person, or for reasons of important public interest of 
the EU or of a member state.*
An individual data subject who has obtained restriction of pro-
cessing must be informed by the controller before the restriction of 
processing is lifted.†
No Legitimate Interest Processing of Personal Data of Child
Article 6 refers to lawfulness of processing or the legitimate process-
ing conditions. This is relevant, as it refers to children. One of the 
legitimate processing conditions, which many organizations may seek 
to rely on, or fall within, is
processing …  necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pur-
sued by the controller.
However, there is a caveat, which means that this cannot be relied 
on by organizations where the processing relates to the personal data 
of a child. It states:
except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamen-
tal rights and freedoms of the data subject …  in particular where the 
data subject is a child.
Therefore, organizations cannot seek to lawfully process the per-
sonal data of a child by referring to their own “ legitimate interests.”  
The legitimate interest ground cannot be relied on, and one of the 
other grounds must be looked at.‡
Child’ s Consent and Conditions for Information Society Services
The processing of children’ s personal data is referred to in Recital 389. 
Article 8 of the GDPR makes new provisions in relation to conditions 
*	 GDPR Article 18(2).
†	 GDPR Article 18(3).
‡	 GDPR Article 6(1)(f).

248
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
for children’ s consent for information society services. Where Article 
6(1)(a) (i.e., consent) applies, in relation to the offering of information 
society services directly to a child, the processing of personal data of 
a child below the age of 16  years, or, if provided for by member state 
law, a lower age, which shall not be below 13  years, shall only be law-
ful if and to the extent that such consent is given or authorized by the 
holder of parental responsibility over the child.*
Note that member states may provide for an age of 13  years.
The controller must make reasonable efforts to verify in such cases 
that consent is given or authorized by the holder of parental respon-
sibility over the child, taking into consideration available technology.† 
This must not affect the general contract law of member states, such as 
the rules on the validity, formation, or effect of a contract in relation 
to a child.‡
Transparency and Children
Article 12 of the GDPR provides that the controller must take appro-
priate measures to provide any information referred to in Articles 13 
and 14 and any communication under Articles 15 to 22 and 34 relat-
ing to processing to the data subject in a concise, transparent, intel-
ligible, and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, “ in 
particular for any information addressed specifically to a child.”  The 
information must be provided in writing or by other means, includ-
ing, where appropriate, by electronic means. When requested by the 
data subject, the information may be provided orally, provided that 
the identity of the data subject is proved by other means.
Codes of Conduct and Certification
Article 40(2)(g) of the GDPR refers to bodies being able to provide 
codes of conduct with regard to “ the information provided to, and the 
protection of, children, and the manner in which the consent of the 
holders of parental responsibility over children is to be obtained.”

Data Protection Supervisory Authority
The tasks of the data protection supervisory authority include having 
to “ promote public awareness and understanding of the risks, rules, 
safeguards and rights in relation to processing. Activities addressed spe-
cifically to children shall receive specific attention .” *
Conclusion
The explicit reference to children is new and, some would argue, over-
due. Increasingly, the activities of children on the Internet and on 
social media are posing risks and concerns.† This has been further 
emphasized of late with tragic events involving online abuse, in par-
ticular cyber-bullying. Risks obviously arise from children’ s activities 
online (e.g., inappropriate content, cyber-bullying, but also from the 
collection and use of their personal data online and collected online, 
sometimes without their knowledge or consent). Their personal data 
and privacy are more vulnerable than those of older people.
The issues and concerns in relation to children’ s personal data are 
continually increasing. This has increased as children’ s activity has 
increased online and on new communications technologies. The new 
GDPR is just one example of rules in the United States and the EU 
that seek to protect the interests of children. Organizations should 
seek to differentiate considerations for children’ s personal data from 
adults’  personal data in relation to the organization’ s activities.

KEY CONCEPTS 
It is important for organizations to note the indirect definition 
of “ child”  in the GDPR. A child was defined in the original EU 
Commission proposal for the GDPR to mean any person below 
the age of 18  years. Ultimately, the final agreed version of the 
GDPR has been amended to 13  years.

Increased Penalties 
and Fines
Introduction
US organizations need to be particularly mindful of EU data protec-
tion rules given the new fines and penalties regime, the increase in 
fines, and the express inclusion of worldwide turnover as a factor.
Background Guidance
To strengthen the enforcement of the rules of the General Data 
Protection Regulation (GDPR), penalties including administrative 
fines should be imposed for any infringement of the GDPR in addi-
tion to, or instead of, appropriate measures imposed by the data pro-
tection supervisory authority pursuant to the GDPR. In the case of a 
minor infringement, or if the fine likely to be imposed would consti-
tute a disproportionate burden to a natural person, a reprimand may 
be issued instead of a fine. Due regard should, however, be given to
•	 The nature, gravity, and duration of the infringement.
•	 The intentional character of the infringement.
•	 Actions taken to mitigate the damage suffered.
•	 Degree of responsibility.
•	 Any relevant previous infringements.
•	 The manner in which the infringement became known to the 
data protection supervisory authority.
•	 Compliance with measures ordered against the controller or 
processor.
•	 Adherence to a code of conduct.
•	 Any other aggravating or mitigating factor.*
*	 GDPR Recital 148.

252
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
The imposition of penalties including administrative fines should 
be subject to appropriate procedural safeguards in accordance with the 
general principles of EU law and the EU Charter, including effective 
judicial protection and due process.*
To strengthen and harmonize administrative penalties for infringe-
ments of the GDPR, each data protection supervisory authority should 
have the power to impose administrative fines. The GDPR should 
indicate infringements and the upper limit and criteria for setting the 
related administrative fines, which should be determined by the com-
petent data protection supervisory authority in each individual case, 
taking into account all relevant circumstances of the specific situation, 
with due regard in particular to
•	 The nature, gravity, and duration of the infringement.
•	 Its consequences.
•	 The measures taken to ensure compliance with the obligations 
under the GDPR and to prevent or mitigate the consequences 
of the infringement.†
Where administrative fines are imposed on an organization, an 
organization should be understood to be an undertaking in accor-
dance with Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of 
the European Union (TFEU) for those purposes. Where administra-
tive fines are imposed on persons that are not an undertaking, the 
data protection supervisory authority should take account of the gen-
eral level of income in the member state as well as the economic situ-
ation of the person in considering the appropriate amount of the fine. 
The consistency mechanism may also be used to promote a consistent 
application of administrative fines. It should be for the member states 
to determine whether and to what extent public authorities should 
be subject to administrative fines. Imposing an administrative fine or 
giving a warning does not affect the application of other powers of 
the data protection supervisory authorities or of other penalties under 
the GDPR.‡

Impact
Organizations might consider that Sony was fined £ 250,000 in rela-
tion to specific hacking data breaches of the PlayStation Network 
(PSN) (which occurred in 2011) by the UK data protection super-
visory authority (Information Commissioner’ s Office [ICO]). The 
breaches were described as negligent and preventable.
Sony sales for the third quarter 2015 are reported as $21.4 billion,‡ 
which if multiplied for four quarters could be $85.6 billion (while 
acknowledging that this might not be a full annual reflection, as cer-
tain quarters can be better than others). So, a contemporary fine for a 
security data breach post the GDPR could be up to € 10,000,000  or 
2% of $85.6 billion , whichever is higher.
Other breaches could be even higher. Consider an organization 
with an annual turnover of $100 billion facing a fine of 4% , which 
would amount to $4 billion.
This emphasizes the significantly enhanced importance of data 
protection compliance by organizations. The cost of non-compliance 
is vastly increased by the new GDPR.

INCREASED PENALTIES AND FINES
General Conditions for Imposing Administrative Fines
Article 83 of the new GDPR refers to general conditions for impos-
ing administrative fines. Each data protection supervisory authority 
must ensure that the imposition of administrative fines pursuant to 
this Article in respect of infringements of the GDPR referred to in 
paragraphs 4, 5, and 6 must in each individual case be effective, pro-
portionate, and dissuasive .*
Administrative fines must, depending on the circumstances of each 
individual case, be imposed in addition  to, or instead of, measures 
referred to in Article 58(2)(a) to (h) and (j). When deciding whether 
to impose an administrative fine and deciding on the amount of the 
administrative fine in each individual case, due regard must be given 
to the following
•	 The nature , gravity , and duration  of the infringement, taking 
into account the nature, scope, or purpose of the processing 
concerned as well as the number of data subjects  affected and 
the level of damage  suffered by them.
•	 The intentional or negligent  character of the infringement (con-
sider, e.g., the Target and Sony data breach examples, where 
it is understood that particular risks were known in advance 
and documented but were not addressed. It could perhaps be 
argued that that this provision is wider in some respects than 
the Target and Sony examples, where particular risks were 
known).
•	 Any action taken  by the controller or processor to mitigate the 
damage suffered by data subjects (actions before the breach 
and actions after the breach can arise).
•	 The degree of responsibility  of the controller or processor, taking 
into account technical and organizational measures imple-
mented by them pursuant to Articles 25 and 32.
•	 Any relevant previous infringements  by the controller or 
processor.
•	 The degree of cooperation  with the data protection supervisory 
authority to remedy the infringement and mitigate the pos-
sible adverse effects of the infringement.
*	 GDPR Article 83(1).

258
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
•	 The categories  of personal data affected by the infringement.
•	 The manner in which the infringement became known to the 
data protection supervisory authority, in particular whether, 
and if so to what extent, the controller or processor notified  
the infringement.
•	 Where measures referred to in Article 58(2) have previously  
been ordered  against the controller or processor concerned 
with regard to the same subject matter, compliance with those 
measures.
•	 Adherence to approved codes  of conduct* or approved certifica-
tion  mechanisms.† 
•	 Any other  aggravating or mitigating factor  applicable to the 
circumstances of the case, such as financial benefits gained, or 
losses avoided, directly or indirectly, from the infringement.‡ 
(Obviously, each case will vary; and it will also take some 
time to flesh out what these additional factors may be, both 
generally and specifically.)
If a controller or processor intentionally or negligently, for the same 
or linked processing operations, infringes several provisions of the 
GDPR, the total amount of the administrative fine must not exceed 
the amount specified for the gravest infringement.§ One can envisage 
that this potential aggregation capping provision may be contested in 
particular cases. The nuances of this provision will take some time to 
fully appreciate. It will be interesting to see whether it contrasts with 
provisions in certain US statutes that provide for penalties per spam 
communication, which therefore can add up to significant total fines 
even where only a sample of the breaches are taken into account.
Without prejudice to the corrective powers of data protection 
supervisory authorities pursuant to Article 58(2), each member state 
may lay down the rules on whether and to what extent administrative 
fines may be imposed on public authorities and bodies established in

INCREASED PENALTIES AND FINES
The exercise by the data protection supervisory authority of its 
powers under this Article must be subject to appropriate procedural 
safeguards in accordance with EU and member state law, including 
effective judicial remedy and due process.*
Where the legal system of the member state does not provide for 
administrative fines, this Article may be applied in such a manner 
that the fine is initiated by the competent data protection supervisory 
authority and imposed by competent national courts, while ensuring 
that those legal remedies are effective and have an equivalent effect 
to the administrative fines imposed by data protection supervisory 
authorities. In any event, the fines imposed must be effective, propor-
tionate, and dissuasive.†
Penalties
Article 84 of the new GDPR refers to penalties. Member states must 
lay down the rules on other penalties applicable to infringements of 
the GDPR in particular for infringements that are not subject to 
administrative fines pursuant to Article 83, and must take all mea-
sures necessary to ensure that they are implemented. Such penalties 
must be effective, proportionate, and dissuasive .‡
Therefore, in addition to the fines regime described, organizations 
need to be aware of the potential for additional penalties arising.

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
Organizations will need to review these separate issues in particu-
lar detail, as well as any changes that may occur or be introduced over 
time.
Enforcement
The data protection supervisory authority may investigate, or cause to 
be investigated, whether any of the provisions of the data protection 
rules have been, are being, or are likely to be contravened in relation 
to an individual, either where the individual complains to them of a 
contravention of any of those provisions or  the data protection super-
visory authority is otherwise of the opinion that there may be such a 
contravention. It is clear that the data protection supervisory authority 
need not wait for the receipt of an actual complaint.
Conclusion
As noted previously, the new GDPR sets out significant amendments 
to the prosecution and fines regime. The creation of new, significantly 
enhanced penalties in the new data protection regime will be a signif-
icant spur for many organizations to seriously consider data protection 
compliance. While the Federal Trade Commission (as well as compe-
tition law rules) in the US had imposed, and also consensually agreed, 
significant fines in relation to data protection issues, the increase in 
fines and penalties in the EU— including on a percentage of world-
wide turnover level— raises the stakes for getting compliance wrong.
While it is important to get compliance right, it is also important 
to ensure compliance, and compliance with orders, in a prompt and 
timely manner. If not, this also opens up potential for penalties.
KEY CONCEPTS 
Organizations can now be fined millions of euros or a percent-
age of turnover on a worldwide basis if they get data protection 
compliance wrong. The fines and penalties can vary depending 
on the type of breach involved

Codes of Conduct 
and Certification
Introduction
Many commercial sectors have entered into various forms of indus-
try codes and codes of conduct. The new General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR) refers to the possibility of codes of conduct and 
certification in relation to data protection.
Background Guidance: Codes of Conduct
Associations or other bodies representing categories of controllers 
or processors are encouraged to draw up codes of conduct so as to 
facilitate the effective application of the GDPR, taking account of the 
specific characteristics of the processing carried out in certain sectors 
and the specific needs of micro, small, and medium enterprises. In 
particular, such codes of conduct could calibrate the obligations of 
controllers and processors, taking into account the risk likely to result 
from the processing for the rights of natural persons.*
Codes of Conduct 
Chapter  IV, Section  5 of the GDPR refers to and is headed “ Codes 
of Conduct and Certification.”  Article 40 refers to codes of conduct 
and provides that the member states, the data protection supervisory 
authorities, the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), and the 
EU Commission must encourage the drawing up of codes of conduct 
intended to contribute to the proper application of the GDPR, taking 
*	 GDPR Recital 98.

264
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
account of the specific features of the various processing sectors and 
the specific needs of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises.*
A code of conduct must contain mechanisms that enable the 
responsible body† to carry out the mandatory monitoring of compli-
ance with its provisions by the controllers or processors that undertake 
to apply it, without prejudice to the tasks and powers of data protec-
tion supervisory authorities.‡ 
Associations and other bodies that intend to prepare a code of con-
duct or to amend or extend an existing code must submit the draft 
code, amendment, or extension to the data protection supervisory 
authority, which is competent pursuant to Article 55. The data pro-
tection supervisory authority must provide an opinion on whether the 
draft code, amendment, or extension complies with the GDPR and 
must approve that draft code, amendment, or extension if it finds that 
it provides sufficient appropriate safeguards.§ 
Where the draft code, amendment, or extension is approved, and 
where the code of conduct does not relate to processing activities in 
several member states, the data protection supervisory authority must 
register and publish the code.¶
Where a draft code of conduct relates to processing activities in 
several member states, the competent data protection supervisory 
authority must, before approving the draft code, amendment, or 
extension, submit it to the EDPB, which must provide an opinion on 
whether the draft code, amendment, or extension complies with the 
GDPR or provides appropriate safeguards.**
Where the opinion referred to confirms that the draft code, 
amendment, or extension complies with the GDPR or provides 
appropriate safeguards, the EDPB must submit its opinion to the EU 
Commission.††

265
CODES OF CONDUCT AND CERTIFICATION
The EU Commission may, by way of implementing acts, decide that 
the approved code of conduct, amendment, or extension has general 
validity within the EU. Those implementing acts must be adopted in 
accordance with the examination procedure set out in Article 93(2).*
The EU Commission must ensure appropriate publicity for the 
approved codes that have been decided as having general validity in 
accordance with paragraph 9.† It must collate all approved codes of 
conduct, amendments, and extensions in a register and must make 
them publicly available by way of appropriate means.‡ 
Monitoring Approved Codes of Conduct
The new Article 41 refers to the monitoring of approved codes of con-
duct. Without prejudice to the tasks and powers of the competent data 
protection supervisory authority, the monitoring of compliance with a 
code of conduct may be carried out by a body that has an appropriate 
level of expertise in relation to the subject matter of the code and is 
accredited for that purpose by the competent data protection super-
visory authority.§
A body as referred to in this section may be accredited to monitor 
compliance with a code of conduct where that body has 
•	 Demonstrated its independence and expertise in relation to 
the subject matter of the code to the satisfaction of the com-
petent data protection supervisory authority.
•	 Established procedures that allow it to assess the eligibility 
of controllers and processors concerned to apply the code, to 
monitor their compliance with its provisions, and to periodi-
cally review its operation.
•	 Established procedures and structures to handle complaints 
about infringements of the code or the manner in which the 
code has been, or is being, implemented by a controller or 
processor, and to make those procedures and structures trans-
parent to individual data subjects and the public.

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
•	 Demonstrated to the satisfaction of the competent data pro-
tection supervisory authority that its tasks and duties do not 
result in a conflict of interests.*
The competent data protection supervisory authority must submit 
the draft criteria for accreditation of a body as referred to in this sec-
tion to the EDPB pursuant to the consistency mechanism referred to 
in Article 63.† 
Without prejudice to the tasks and powers of the competent 
data protection supervisory authority and the provisions of GDPR 
Chapter  VIII, a body as referred to in this section must, subject to 
appropriate safeguards, take appropriate action in cases of infringe-
ment of the code by a controller or processor, including suspension or 
exclusion of the controller or processor concerned from the code. It 
must inform the competent data protection supervisory authority of 
such actions and the reasons for taking them.‡ 
The competent data protection supervisory authority must revoke 
the accreditation of a body as referred to in this section if the condi-
tions for accreditation are not, or are no longer, met or where actions 
taken by the body infringe the GDPR.§ 
However, these rules may not apply to processing carried out by 
public authorities and bodies.¶ 
Details of Codes of Conduct
The member states, the data protection supervisory authorities, the 
EDPB, and the EU Commission must encourage the drawing up of 
codes of conduct intended to contribute to the proper application of 
the GDPR, taking account of the specific features of the various pro-
cessing sectors and the specific needs of micro, small, and medium-
sized enterprises.**

267
CODES OF CONDUCT AND CERTIFICATION
Associations and other bodies representing categories of controllers 
or processors may prepare codes of conduct, or amend or extend such 
codes, for the purpose of specifying the application of the GDPR, 
such as with regard to
•	 Fair and transparent processing.
•	 The legitimate interests pursued by controllers in specific 
contexts.
•	 The collection of personal data.
•	 The pseudonymization of personal data.
•	 The information provided to the public and to data subjects.
•	 The exercise of the rights of data subjects.
•	 The information provided to, and the protection of, children, 
and the manner in which the consent of the holders of paren-
tal responsibility over children is to be obtained.
•	 The measures and procedures referred to in Articles 24 and 
25 and the measures to ensure security of processing referred 
to in Article 32.
•	 The notification of personal data breaches to data protection 
supervisory authorities and the communication of such per-
sonal data breaches to data subjects.
•	 The transfer of personal data to third countries or interna-
tional organizations.
•	 Out-of-court proceedings and other dispute resolution pro-
cedures for resolving disputes between controllers and data 
subjects with regard to processing, without prejudice to the 
rights* of data subjects.†
In addition to adherence by controllers or processors subject to 
the GDPR, codes of conduct approved pursuant to paragraph 5 of 
this Article and having general validity pursuant to paragraph 9 of 
this Article may also be adhered to by controllers or processors that 
are not subject to the GDPR pursuant to Article 3 so as to provide 
appropriate safeguards within the framework of personal data trans-
fers to third countries or international organizations under the terms 
referred to in Article 46(2)(e). Such controllers or processors must 
*	 Pursuant to GDPR Articles 77 and 79.
†	 GDPR Article 40(2).

268
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
make binding and enforceable commitments, via contractual or other 
legally binding instruments, to apply those appropriate safeguards, 
including with regard to the rights of data subjects.*
The body will carry out mandatory monitoring of compliance by 
the controllers or processors.† There are also provisions in relation to 
the monitoring of approved codes of conduct.‡
Certification Seals and Marks
Background Guidance
To enhance transparency and compliance with the GDPR, the estab-
lishment of certification mechanisms and data protection seals and 
marks should be encouraged, allowing individual data subjects to 
quickly assess the level of data protection of relevant products and 
services.§
Legal Rule
Article 39 refers to certification. The member states, the data pro-
tection supervisory authorities, the EDPB, and the EU Commission 
must encourage, in particular at EU level, the establishment of data 
protection certification mechanisms and of data protection seals and 
marks for the purpose of demonstrating compliance with the GDPR 
of processing operations carried out by controllers and processors. The 
specific needs of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises must be 
taken into account.¶ 
In addition to adherence by controllers or processors subject to 
the GDPR, approved data protection certification mechanisms, 
seals, or marks may be established for the purpose of demonstrat-
ing the existence of appropriate safeguards provided by controllers or 
processors that are not subject to the GDPR pursuant to Article 3 
within the framework of personal data transfers to third countries

or international organizations.* Such controllers or processors shall 
make binding and enforceable commitments, via contractual or other 
legally binding instruments, to apply those appropriate safeguards, 
including with regard to the rights of data subjects.†
The certification must be voluntary and available via a process that 
is transparent.‡
A certification pursuant to this Article does not reduce the respon-
sibility of the controller or the processor for compliance with the 
GDPR and is without prejudice to the tasks and powers of the data 
protection supervisory authority.§
A certification shall be issued by the certification bodies or by the 
competent supervisory authority on the basis of criteria approved by 
that competent supervisory authority or by the EDPB. Where the 
criteria are approved by the EDPB, this may result in a common cer-
tification, the European Data Protection Seal.¶
The certification must be issued to a controller or processor for 
a maximum period of 3  years and may be renewed under the same 
conditions as long as the relevant requirements continue to be met. 
It shall be withdrawn, where applicable, by the certification bodies 
or by the competent data protection supervisory authority where the 
requirements for the certification are not or no longer met.**
The controller or processor that submits its processing to the cer-
tification mechanism must provide the certification body or, where 
applicable, the competent data protection supervisory authority with 
all the information and access to its processing activities that are nec-
essary to conduct the certification procedure.††
The EDPB must collate all certification mechanisms and data pro-
tection seals and marks in a register and must make them publicly 
available by any appropriate means.‡‡

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
Conclusion
As with other areas of industry, it is now recognized that industry 
codes and certification mechanisms can assist organizations within 
designated sectors in compliance with data protection. As these are 
developed, organizations should monitor them to assess the applica-
bility and benefits to their organizations of these codes and certifica-
tion mechanisms.
KEY CONCEPTS 
Organizations can assist in establishing, maintaining, and dem-
onstrating compliance by adherence to appropriate industry 
codes of conduct and/or certification mechanisms. These can 
relate to one or more aspects of data processing and compliance.

Security of 
Personal Data
Introduction
“ [Personal data] has become the prime target of hackers and cyber-
criminals. It can be exploited in many ways, from identity theft, spam-
ming and phishing right through to cyber-espionage.” * Various types 
of blackmail in relation to personal data are also increasing among 
adults, teenagers, and children. The data protection regime sets infor-
mation and data security obligations on all controllers as well as pro-
cessors. These procedural, information technology (IT), and personal 
data security requirements must be complied with. While security 
risks have increased with the Internet,† security issues are not just lim-
ited to the organization’ s Internet.
The increasing instances of data security breach, including through 
inadequate security, as well as Internet usage and social media, cloud 
computing, and online abuse, will all increase attention to security 
and data protection. Sony, for example, was fined £ 250,000 in rela-
tion to a hacking data breach incident. Recently, telco TalkTalk and 
children’ s electronic toy manufacturer VTech were hacked. The MD 
of TalkTalk has said that “ cyber criminals are becoming increasingly 
sophisticated and attacks against companies which do business online 
are becoming more frequent.” 
Directors and other executives can also face official as well as inter-
nal sanctions. Data protection officers must be appointed, and they 
have significant independence and authority in carrying out their 
functions. Risks, in particular security risks to personal data, must be

assessed and appropriate procedures put in place. The significant new 
level of the penalties regime, amounting to millions of euros, is a sig-
nificant incentive for organizations to raise their level of compliance.
In addition, quite apart from the new general data protection regu-
lation (GDPR), there is also a new Directive coming that deals spe-
cifically with security issues, in addition to the security obligations 
in the GDPR. The Network and Information Security Directive was 
proposed in 2013 and was significantly advanced by the time of writ-
ing.* Once it is finalized, organizations will need to take on board the 
relevant obligations of this new Directive also.

Risk and Damage
There is increasing opportunity for risk and damage to both individu-
als and organizations in relation to personal data. There is thus a need 
for updating new rules in this regard.

SECURITY OF PERSONAL DATA
to physical, material, or non-material damage, in particular where the 
processing may give rise to discrimination, identity theft or fraud, 
financial loss, damage to the reputation, loss of confidentiality of per-
sonal data protected by professional secrecy, unauthorized reversal of 
pseudonymization, or any other significant economic or social dis-
advantage; where individual data subjects might be deprived of their 
rights or prevented from exercising control over their personal data; 
where personal data are processed that reveal racial or ethnic ori-
gin, political opinions, religion or philosophical beliefs, trade union 
membership; the processing of genetic data, data concerning health, 
or data concerning sex life or criminal convictions and offenses or 
related security measures; where personal aspects are evaluated, in 
particular analyzing or predicting aspects concerning performance at 
work, economic situation, health, personal preferences or interests, 
reliability or behavior, or location or movements, to create or use per-
sonal profiles; where the personal data of vulnerable natural persons, 
in particular of children, are processed; or where processing involves a 
large amount of personal data and affects a large number of individual 
data subjects.*
The likelihood and severity of the risk to the rights of the individual 
data subject should be determined by reference to the nature, scope, 
context, and purposes of the processing. Risk should be evaluated on 
the basis of an objective assessment, by which it is established whether 
data processing operations involve a risk or a high risk.†
Guidance on the implementation of appropriate measures and 
on the demonstration of compliance by the controller or the proces-
sor, especially as regards the identification of the risk related to the 
processing, its assessment in terms of origin, nature, likelihood, and 
severity, and the identification of best practices to mitigate the risk, 
could be provided in particular by means of approved codes of con-
duct, approved certifications, guidelines provided by the European 
Data Protection Board (EDPB), or indications provided by a data 
protection officer. The EDPB may also issue guidelines on processing 
operations that are considered to be unlikely to result in a high risk to

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
the rights of natural persons and indicate what measures may be suf-
ficient in such cases to address such risk.*
The protection of the rights of natural persons with regard to the 
processing of personal data requires that appropriate technical and 
organizational measures be taken to ensure that the requirements of 
the GDPR are met. To be able to demonstrate compliance with the 
GDPR, the controller should adopt internal policies and implement 
measures that meet in particular the principles of data protection by 
design and data protection by default. Such measures could consist, 
inter alia , of minimizing the processing of personal data, pseudony-
mizing personal data as soon as possible, transparency with regard 
to the functions and processing of personal data, enabling the indi-
vidual data subject to monitor the data processing, and enabling the 
controller to create and improve security features. When developing, 
designing, selecting, and using applications, services, and products 
that are based on the processing of personal data or process personal 
data to fulfill their task, the producers of the products, services, and 
applications should be encouraged to take into account the right to 
data protection when developing and designing such products, ser-
vices, and applications and, with due regard to the state of the art, to 
make sure that controllers and processors are able to fulfill their data 
protection obligations. The principles of data protection by design and 
by default should also be taken into consideration in the context of 
public tenders.†
Breaches
The obligations in terms of insufficient security and data breaches are 
more detailed in the GDPR than previously.‡  The obligations are now 
more detailed than the obligation in relation to telcos and ISPs in the 
ePrivacy Directive.§ Data breaches are referred to in Articles 4 and 9 
of the GDPR. In the event of a data breach, the controller must notify

SECURITY OF PERSONAL DATA
the data protection supervisory authority.* In addition, the controller 
must communicate to the individual data subjects if there is a risk of 
harm to their privacy or personal data.†
Risk Evaluation
To maintain security and to prevent processing in infringement of the 
GDPR, the controller or processor should evaluate the risks inherent 
in the processing and implement measures to mitigate those risks, 
such as encryption. Those measures should ensure an appropriate level 
of security, including confidentiality, taking into account the state of 
the art and the costs of implementation in relation to the risks and the 
nature of the personal data to be protected. In assessing data security 
risk, consideration should be given to the risks that are presented by 
personal data processing, such as accidental or unlawful destruction, 
loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, personal data 
transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed that may in particular 
lead to physical, material, or non-material damage.‡
High Risks
To enhance compliance with the GDPR where processing operations 
are likely to result in a high risk to the rights of natural persons, the 
controller should be responsible for the carrying-out of a data protection 
impact assessment to evaluate, in particular, the origin, nature, particu-
larity, and severity of that risk. The outcome of the assessment should 
be taken into account when determining the appropriate measures to 
be taken to demonstrate that the processing of personal data complies 
with the GDPR. Where a data protection impact assessment indicates 
that processing operations involve a high risk that the controller cannot 
mitigate by appropriate measures in terms of available technology and 
costs of implementation, a consultation of the data protection supervi-
sory authority should take place prior to the processing.§

Risk and Damage
There is increasing opportunity for risk and damage to both individu-

data to fulfill their task, the producers of the products, services, and 
applications should be encouraged to take into account the right to 
data protection when developing and designing such products, ser-
vices, and applications and, with due regard to the state of the art, to 
make sure that controllers and processors are able to fulfill their data 
protection obligations. The principles of data protection by design and 
by default should also be taken into consideration in the context of 
public tenders.†
Legal Rule: Appropriate Security Measures
There are specific requirements with regard to the security measures 
that need to be implemented under the data protection laws.
*	 GDPR Recital 77.

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
There is greater emphasis on security in the new GDPR. It is a 
separate distinct section in the GDPR. Previously, the DPD95 high-
lighted security as part of the data protection principles.
Organizations and controllers must take appropriate security mea-
sures against unauthorized access to, or unauthorized alteration, dis-
closure, or destruction of, the data, in particular where the processing 
involves the transmission of data over a network, and against all other 
unlawful forms of processing. As these risks grow,* so too must the 
efforts of organizations to address the risks appropriately in compli-
ance with the data protection regime and satisfy the expectations of 
customers, users, employees, and regulators. However, it is not the 
case that one solution on one occasion will be sufficient.
The requirements regarding security of processing were originally 
contained in the data protection principles and are now more expressly 
expanded in the new GDPR. The controller must take appropriate tech-
nical and organizational measures against the unauthorized or unlawful 
processing of personal data and against the accidental loss or destruction 
of, or damage to, personal data. The controller must ensure the following:
Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation, 
and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing as well as 
the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of 
natural persons, the controller and the processor shall implement appro-
priate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security 
appropriate to the risk, including inter alia  as appropriate
•	 The pseudonymization and encryption of personal data.
•	 The ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, 
availability, and resilience of processing systems and services.
•	 The ability to restore the availability and access to personal 
data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical 
incident.
•	 A process for regularly testing, assessing, and evaluating the effec-
tiveness of technical and organizational measures for ensuring the 
security of the processing.†
*	 See, for example, “ The Cybersecurity Risk,”  Communications of the ACM (2012) (55) 29.
†	 GDPR Article 32(1).

279
SECURITY OF PERSONAL DATA
In assessing the appropriate level of security, account must be taken 
in particular of the risks that are presented by processing, in particular 
from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, or unauthor-
ized disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored, or 
otherwise processed.*
Adherence to an approved code of conduct† or an approved certi-
fication mechanism‡ may be used as an element by which to demon-
strate compliance with these requirements.§
The controller and processor must take steps to ensure that any 
natural person acting under the authority of the controller or the pro-
cessor who has access to personal data does not process them except 
on instructions from the controller, unless he or she is required to do 
so by EU or member state law.¶
The different elements and requirements, therefore, include
•	 Not just security measures, but security measures that are 
appropriate. This means that the security measures will vary 
from organization to organization and sector to sector, as 
well as depending on the history of risk in the individual 
organization.
•	 Preventing unauthorized access.
•	 Preventing unauthorized alteration.
•	 Preventing unauthorized disclosure; or
•	 Preventing unauthorized destruction; and
•	 Especially where there is a network involved, preventing all 
other unlawful forms of processing.
The security obligations are therefore serious and demanding.
The new GDPR places significantly greater emphasis on risk and 
risk assessment, in addition to security. Organizations need to be 
compliant with these obligations. It is also a somewhat complex clause 
given the different parts.
Chapter  IV, Section  2 of the new GDPR relates to data secu-
rity. Article 32 specifically refers to security of processing. It obliges

controllers and processors to implement appropriate technical and 
organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to 
the risk. The Article refers to having regard to the state of the art 
and the costs of implementation and taking into account the nature, 
scope, context, and purposes of the processing as well as the risk of 
varying likelihood and severity for the rights of individuals. After the 
primary obligation is set out in the clause, it then also refers explicitly 
to examples of technical and organizational measures. It is clear that 
these are examples only and not a fixed closed list of such measures 
to be taken, as it indicates “ including inter alia ”  before listing the 
measures.*
Section  2 refers to security in detail. Taking into account the state 
of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context, 
and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood 
and severity for the rights of natural persons, the controller and the 
processor must implement appropriate technical and organizational 
measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including 
inter alia  as appropriate
•	 The pseudonymization and encryption of personal data.
•	 The ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, 
availability, and resilience of processing systems and services.
•	 The ability to restore the availability and access to personal 
data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical 
incident.
•	 A process for regularly testing, assessing, and evaluating the 
effectiveness of technical and organizational measures for 
ensuring the security of the processing.†
In assessing the appropriate level of security, account must be taken 
in particular of the risks that are presented by processing, in particular 
from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, or unauthor-
ized disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored, or 
otherwise processed.‡

‡	 GDPR Article 32(2).

281
SECURITY OF PERSONAL DATA
Adherence to an approved code of conduct* or an approved certi-
fication mechanism† may be used as an element by which to demon-
strate compliance with these requirements.‡
The controller and processor must take steps to ensure that any 
natural person acting under the authority of the controller or the pro-
cessor who has access to personal data does not process them except 
on instructions from the controller, unless they are required to do so 
by EU or member state law.§
Article 32(1) provides that “ [t]aking into account the state of the 
art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and 
purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and 
severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller 
and the processor shall implement appropriate technical and organ-
isational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, 
including inter alia  as appropriate.”  The emphasis here is on risk over 
costs.
It is most important for controllers, and processors, to fully consider 
this obligation. They should also note that the list is noted as being 
“ including,”  and is therefore not a final fixed list. Controllers and pro-
cessors need to go even further than these expressed requirements.
Adherence to an approved code of conduct or an approved certifi-
cation mechanism may be used as an element  to demonstrate compli-
ance. Adopting a minimalistic approach could expose the organization 
both technically and in compliance terms.
The controller and processor must take steps to ensure that any 
natural person acting under the authority of the controller or the pro-
cessor who has access to personal data does not process them except 
on instructions from the controller, unless he or she is required to 
do so by EU or member state law.¶ Liability issues therefore arise 
for organizations, even if they are unaware of the breach issues until 
the event happens. As an example, an errant employee, partner, pro-
cessor, or outsource party may do something that they are not sup-
posed to do and that the organization is wholly unaware of, yet the

controller organization will be held responsible. There are examples of 
this occurring even under the previous 1995 data protection directive 
(DPD95) data protection regime, such as when Irish Life was liable 
as controller when a previous agent continued to contact the Irish Life 
client list.
Notification of Data Breach to Data Protection Supervisory Authority
Article 33 of the GDPR provides that in the case of a personal data 
breach, the controller must without undue delay and, where feasible, 
not later than 72  hours after having become aware of it, notify the 
personal data breach to the competent data protection supervisory 
authority,* unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk 
to the rights of natural persons. There is an additional requirement if 
the notification is late. Article 33 requires that where the notifica-
tion to the data protection supervisory authority is not made within 
72  hours, it must be accompanied by reasons for the delay.
The processor must notify the controller without undue delay after 
becoming aware of a personal data breach.†
There is also guidance in relation to what the notice in Article 
31(1) should contain. Article 33(3) provides that the notification must 
at least 
•	 Describe the nature of the personal data breach including, 
where possible, the categories and approximate number of 
individual data subjects concerned and the categories and 
approximate number of personal data records concerned.
•	 Communicate the name and contact details of the data pro-
tection officer or other contact point from which more infor-
mation can be obtained.
•	 Describe the likely consequences of the personal data breach.
•	 Describe the measures taken or proposed to be taken by the 
controller to address the personal data breach, including, 
where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse 
effects.
*	 In accordance with GDPR Article 55.
†	 GDPR Article 33(2).

283
SECURITY OF PERSONAL DATA
Where, and insofar as, it is not possible to provide the information 
at the same time, the information may be provided in phases without 
undue further delay.*
The controller shall document  any personal data breaches, compris-
ing the facts relating to the personal data breach, its effects, and the 
remedial action taken.† That documentation must enable the data pro-
tection supervisory authority to verify compliance.‡
Communication of Personal Data Breach to Data Subject
The new GDPR also sets out obligations to notify individual data 
subjects of data breaches. Article 34 of the GDPR refers to the com-
munication of a personal data breach§ to the individual data subject. 
When the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the 
rights of natural persons, the controller must communicate the per-
sonal data breach to the individual data subject without undue delay.¶ 
The communication to the individual data subject referred to in para-
graph 1 of this Article must describe in clear and plain language the 
nature of the personal data breach and contain at least the informa-
tion and measures referred to in Article 33(3)(b), (c) and (d).** The 
communication to the individual data subject referred to in paragraph 
1 must not be required if any of the following conditions are met
•	 The controller has implemented appropriate technical and 
organizational protection measures, and those measures were 
applied to the personal data affected by the personal data 
breach, in particular those that render the personal data unin-
telligible to any person who is not authorized to access it, such 
as encryption.

•	 The controller has taken subsequent measures that ensure that 
the high risk to the rights of individual data subjects referred 
to in paragraph 1 is no longer likely to materialize.
•	 It would involve disproportionate effort. In such a case, there 
must instead be a public communication or similar mea-
sure whereby the individual data subjects are informed in an 
equally effective manner.*
If the controller has not already communicated the personal data 
breach to the individual data subject, the data protection supervisory 
authority, having considered the likelihood of the personal data breach 
resulting in a high risk, may require it to do so or may decide that any 
of the conditions referred to in paragraph 3 are met.† It remains to be 
seen how this provision will be interpreted in practice.
Data Protection Impact Assessment
Chapter  IV, Section  3 of the GDPR refers to data protection impact 
assessments  and prior consultations . These are new requirements. This is 
a new provision. Where a type of processing in particular using new 
technologies, and taking into account the nature, scope, context, and 
purposes of the processing, is likely to result in a high risk  to the rights 
of natural persons, the controller shall , prior  to the processing, carry 
out an assessment of the impact of the envisaged processing operations 
on the protection of personal data. A single assessment may address 
a set of similar processing operations that present similar high risks.‡
The controller must seek the advice of the data protection offi-
cer, where designated, when carrying out a data protection impact 
assessment.§
A data protection impact assessment must in particular be required 
in the case of
•	 A systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects 
relating to natural persons that is based on automated pro-
cessing, including profiling, and on which decisions are based

that produce legal effects concerning the natural person or 
similarly significantly affect the natural person.
•	 Processing on a large scale of special categories of data referred 
to in Article 9(1) or of personal data relating to criminal con-
victions and offenses referred to in Article 10; or.
•	 Systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area on a large 
scale.*
The data protection supervisory authority must establish and make 
public a list of the kinds of processing operations that are subject to the 
requirement for a data protection impact assessment. The data protec-
tion supervisory authority must communicate those lists to the EDPB.†
The data protection supervisory authority may also establish and 
make public a list of the kind of processing operations for which no 
data protection impact assessment is required. The data protection 
supervisory authority must communicate those lists to the EDPB.‡
Prior to the adoption of these lists, the competent data protection 
supervisory authority must apply the consistency mechanism referred 
to in Article 63 where such lists involve processing activities that are 
related to the offering of goods or services to individual data subjects 
or to the monitoring of their behavior in several member states, or may 
substantially affect the free movement of personal data within the EU.§
The assessment must contain at least
•	 A systematic description of the envisaged processing opera-
tions and the purposes of the processing, including, where 
applicable, the legitimate interest pursued by the controller.
•	 An assessment of the necessity and proportionality of the 
processing operations in relation to the purposes.
•	 An assessment of the risks to the rights of individual data 
subjects referred to in paragraph 1.
•	 The measures envisaged to address the risks, including safe-
guards, security measures, and mechanisms to ensure the

protection of personal data and to demonstrate compliance with 
the GDPR, taking into account the rights and legitimate inter-
ests of individual data subjects and other persons concerned.*
Compliance with approved codes of conduct by the relevant control-
lers or processors must be taken into due account in assessing the impact 
of the processing operations performed by such controllers or processors, 
in particular for the purposes of a data protection impact assessment.†
Where appropriate, the controller must seek the views of individ-
ual data subjects or their representatives on the intended processing, 
without prejudice to the protection of commercial or public interests 
or the security of processing operations.‡
Where processing pursuant to Article 6(1)(c) or (e) has a legal basis 
in EU law or in the law of the member state to which the controller is 
subject, that law regulates the specific processing operation or set of 
operations in question, and a data protection impact assessment has 
already been carried out as part of a general impact assessment in the 
context of the adoption of that legal basis, paragraphs 1 to 7 must not 
apply unless member states deem it to be necessary to carry out such 
an assessment prior to processing activities.§
Where necessary, the controller must carry out a review to assess 
whether processing is performed in accordance with the data protec-
tion impact assessment, at least when there is a change of the risk 
represented by processing operations.¶
Prior Consultation
Prior consultations are also a new requirement. The controller must 
consult the data protection supervisory authority prior to processing 
where a data protection impact assessment under Article 35 indicates 
that the processing would result in a high risk in the absence of mea-
sures taken by the controller to mitigate the risk.**

SECURITY OF PERSONAL DATA
Where the data protection supervisory authority is of the opinion 
that the intended processing referred to in paragraph 1 would infringe 
the GDPR, in particular where the controller has insufficiently iden-
tified  or mitigated  the risk, the data protection supervisory author-
ity must, within a period of up to 8  weeks of receipt of the request 
for consultation, provide written advice to the controller and, where 
applicable, to the processor, and may use any of its powers referred 
to in Article 58. That period may be extended by 6  weeks, taking 
into account the complexity of the intended processing. The data pro-
tection supervisory authority must inform the controller and, where 
applicable, the processor of any such extension within 1  month of 
receipt of the request for consultation together with the reasons for 
the delay. Those periods may be suspended until the data protection 
supervisory authority has obtained information it has requested for 
the purposes of the consultation.*
When consulting the data protection supervisory authority, the 
controller must provide the data protection supervisory authority with
•	 Where applicable, the respective responsibilities of the con-
troller, joint controllers, and processors involved in the 
processing, in particular for processing within a group of 
undertakings.
•	 The purposes and means of the intended processing.
•	 The measures and safeguards provided to protect the rights of 
individual data subjects pursuant to the GDPR.
•	 Where applicable, the contact details of the data protection 
officer.
•	 The data protection impact assessment.†

supervisory authority.‡
Ensuring Appropriate Security Measures
Controllers must have an adequate level of protection and security as 
regards their storage, and so on, of personal data. What are security

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
and “ appropriate security measures” ? What must the organization do? 
The data protection principles refer to security obligations. In deter-
mining appropriate technical and organizational measures, a control-
ler may have regard to a number of factors.
In determining appropriate security measures, in particular (but 
without prejudice to the generality of that provision) where the pro-
cessing involves the transmission of data over a network, a controller
•	 May have regard to the state of technological development 
and the cost of implementing the measures.
•	 Must ensure that the measures provide a level of security 
appropriate to
•	 The harm that might result from unauthorized or unlaw-
ful processing, accidental or unlawful destruction, or acci-
dental loss of, or damage to, the data concerned
•	 The nature of the data concerned.
•	 May have regard to the state of technological development 
and the cost of implementing the measures.
A controller or processor must take all reasonable steps to ensure 
that
•	 Persons employed by it; and
•	 Other persons at the place of work concerned
are aware of and comply with the relevant security measures.
Where processing of personal data is carried out by a processor on 
behalf of a controller, the controller must
•	 Ensure that the processing is carried out in pursuance of a 
contract  in writing or in another equivalent form between the 
controller and the processor and that the contract provides 
that the processor carries out the processing only on and sub-
ject to the instructions of the controller and that the processor 
complies with obligations equivalent to those imposed on the 
controller.
•	 Ensure that the processor provides sufficient guarantees  in 
respect of the technical security measures, and organizational 
measures, governing the processing.
•	 Take reasonable steps to ensure compliance with those measures.

289
SECURITY OF PERSONAL DATA
Employees and Security
Organizations need to appraise employees and involve them in 
addressing security concerns. Employees need to be made aware of 
the overall need for security and also of the security obligations and 
protocols with which they are required to comply. Employees are also 
integral to the organization’ s efforts to deal with security issues appro-
priately. They must be aware of the issues and their role in implement-
ing and adhering to relevant policies and procedures.
Engaging Processors and Security Issues
Processors* also have obligations in relation to processing personal 
data and security. Where the processing of personal data is carried out 
by a processor on behalf of a controller, the controller must, to comply 
with the seventh principle
•	 Ensure that the processing is carried out in pursuance of a con-
tract in writing or in another equivalent form between the con-
troller and the processor and that the contract provides that the 
processor carries out the processing only on and subject to the 
instructions of the controller and that the processor complies 
with obligations equivalent to those imposed on the controller.
•	 Ensure that the processor provides sufficient guarantees in 
respect of the technical security measures, and organizational 
measures, governing the processing.
•	 Take reasonable steps to ensure compliance with those measures.
Where processing of personal data is carried out by a processor 
on behalf of a controller, the controller must have a contract in writ-
ing with the processor containing certain clauses and obligations. 
Contracts with processors must address the following
•	 That processing must be carried out in pursuance of a contract 
in writing.
•	 That the processor carries out the processing only on and sub-
ject to the instructions of the controller.
•	 That the processor must comply with the security  requirements.
*	 Note generally, for example, Morgan, “ Data Controllers, Data Processors and Data 
Sharers,”  Computers and Law (4 March 2011).

290
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
There are specific requirements where processors are engaged and 
relied on. Where controllers engage processors, the controller must
•	 Have a contract in writing or other equipment form that pro-
vides that the processor will act only on the instructions of the 
controller and will comply with the data security measures to 
which the controller is subject.
•	 Ensure that the processor provides sufficient guarantees in 
respect of the technical security measures and organizational 
measures it implements.
•	 Takes reasonable steps to ensure compliance with such matters.
What actions should an organization take if third parties process 
its data? The following may assist
•	 Ideally, an organization should have advance procedures and 
policies in place to cater for such an eventuality; for example, 
ensuring that an appropriate senior manager/board member 
has an assigned role and takes responsibility for data protec-
tion compliance, including dealing with breaches, and also 
having a documented IT security incident handling procedure 
policy in place. Needless to say, it must be properly policed, 
implemented, reviewed, and updated appropriately.
•	 Once a breach does occur, a proper procedure can assist in 
containing and recovering from the breach, assessing the 
ongoing risk, notifying the breach as appropriate, and evalu-
ating and reacting to the breach and the risk.
•	 All of the appropriate personnel within the organization 
should be aware of the procedures and consulted as appropri-
ate, including, for example, the managing director and the 
legal, IT, and media/press officers.
•	 A part of the procedure will have a designated list of external 
contact points, some or all of whom may need to be notified 
and contacted, as appropriate.
•	 Obviously, the nature of organizations, and of breaches them-
selves, differs, and the IT security incident handling proce-
dure policy will need to be tailored. After all, the cause of a 
data security breach can be any one of a number of reasons.

291
SECURITY OF PERSONAL DATA
•	 Also, such a policy, while covering breaches of data protec-
tion and privacy, may well encompass wider issues, such as 
outsourcing, backups, disaster recovery, business continuity, 
and so on.
•	 Business in other jurisdictions may require additional mea-
sures. For example, if a business owns or has access to the 
personal information of Californian residents, it may have a 
legal duty to notify those individuals if that information (such 
as names and credit card details) has been accessed illegally.
Legislative Data Protection Reviews
Member states must consult the data protection supervisory authority 
during the preparation of a proposal for a legislative measure to be 
adopted by a national parliament, or of a regulatory measure based on 
such a legislative measure, which relates to processing.*
Specific Public Interest Prior Consultations
Notwithstanding this, member state law may require controllers to 
consult with, and obtain prior authorization  from, the data protec-
tion supervisory authority in relation to processing by a controller for 
the performance of a task carried out by the controller in the public 
interest , including processing in relation to social protection  and public 
health .†

Security Awareness
EU Council Resolution 2002/C43/02* indicates the recognition and 
official concern in relation to the loss of personal data, and the fact 
that technology has changed significantly since the DPD95.
It refers to the dangers of information loss, attacks on organiza-
tions, and issues of network and information security for organizations 
and individuals. It indicates that EU member states should engage in 
information campaigns addressing the issues of security and personal 
data. There is a need to promote best practice, such as the interna-
tionally recognized standards for IT; for example, ISO 15408, ISO 
27001, ISO 31000, and BS10012:2009.
There is also an increase in eGovernment and an associated need to 
promote secure eGovernment.
It notes the increase of attacks on the security of personal data 
through technology, but some of the solutions may also come from 
new technologies. Some of these are referred to as privacy-enhancing 
technologies (PETs).†
In addition, it refers to the increase of mobile and wireless commu-
nications technologies and the need for introducing and enhancing 
wireless security.
Keeping on top of the increasing threats to information security is 
an ongoing task. The threats are ever-changing, and so equally should 
be the effort to prevent breaches and to deal with them if and when 
they occur. Some of the most current information security threats are 
highlighted annually by various IT security vendors as well as police 
and investigative officials.
Data Protection Supervisory Authorities Guides
Data protection supervisory authorities advise that that appropri-
ate security measures be put in place that take account of the harm 
that would result from unauthorized access to the information. This

SECURITY OF PERSONAL DATA
should take account of available technology and the cost of installa-
tion. In addition to technical security measures, due regard should be 
given to physical security measures such as access control for central 
IT servers and local PCs.*
According to one data protection supervisory authority, physical 
security safeguards should include the following considerations:
•	 Perimeter security (monitoring of access, office locked and 
alarmed when not in use).
•	 Restrictions on access to sensitive areas within the building 
(such as server rooms).
•	 Computer location (so that the screen may not be viewed by 
members of the public).
•	 Storage of files (files not stored in public areas, with access 
restricted to staff with a need to access particular files).
•	 Secure disposal of records (effective “ wiping”  of data stored 
electronically; secure disposal of paper records).†
Many data protection supervisory authorities have issued guides 
and codes of conduct in relation to  data security, breach issues, and 
breach reporting rules to help organizations to react appropriately 
when they become aware of breaches of security involving customer 
or employee personal information.‡
National ePrivacy rules can also place specific obligations on pro-
viders of publicly available electronic communications networks or 
services to safeguard the security of their services.§
*	 See, for example, DPC at https://www.dataprotection.ie.
†	 See DPC at https://www.dataprotection.ie. The UK data protection supervisory 
authority (ICO) has also issued a guide entitled A Practical Guide to IT Security,

to encryption issues and general security for personal data, including computers, 
emails, and so on.

Security and Article 29 Data Protection Working Party (WP29)/EDPB
The influential EU WP29 (now replaced by the new EDPB) has pub-
lished a document relating to personal data and information security.* 
This is an EU organization made up of representatives of all EU data 
protection authorities.† It refers to the surveillance of employees’  elec-
tronic communications.
In terms of compliance, it raises a number of concerns for orga-
nizations to consider when dealing with their policies and activi-
ties regarding such personal data. It suggests that organizations ask 
whether the proposed processing of the employees’  personal data is
•	 Transparent?
•	 Necessary?
•	 Fair?
•	 Proportionate?
•	 And to be used for what purpose?‡
It suggests that organizations should consider whether each pro-
posed processing activity can be achieved through some other, less

obtrusive means.* It refers to the organization informing those 
outside of the organization as appropriate in relation to the proposed 
processing.† It also highlights issues of proportionality in suggesting 
that an organization, in processing personal data, should adopt the 
minimum processing necessary and pursue a strategy of prevention 
versus detection. Detection leans more toward blanket monitoring of 
employees. Prevention is viewed as more appropriate and employee 
privacy friendly. Of course, where an issue comes to the organization’ s 
attention, it could then investigate that issue, as opposed to actively 
monitoring all employees continuously. An example would be using 
IT filtering systems, which alert the IT manager that there may be an 
issue to look at further, rather than the IT manager actively looking 
at and monitoring all employee communications.‡
Organizational Security Awareness
There is a need to ensure security awareness within the organization. 
Controllers and processors must take all reasonable steps to ensure 
that persons employed by them and other persons at the place of work 
are aware of and comply with the relevant security measures.
Identifying and Controlling Organizational IT Security
Who needs to be in charge of IT and data security in an organization? 
What organizational security measures should be in place?
The data protection rules do not require that a named individual be 
appointed with responsibility for security compliance. However, there 
are specific organizational responsibilities regarding security set out 
in the data protection rules, and these include a specific requirement 
that all staff are aware of and comply with the security standards set 
out in the data protection regime.
These security requirements apply where an organization collects 
and processes any personal data. Typically, personal data would include 
information that identifies living individuals, such as employees or

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
customers. Accordingly, for most organizations, data protection com-
pliance is likely to be an issue that crosses various aspects of the busi-
ness, such as human resources, IT, and customer support. It is not 
necessarily just an IT function. An organization’ s decision as to who 
should be responsible for IT and data security should be made with 
this in mind.
The security standards set out in the data protection rules can be 
summarized as obliging the organization to take “ appropriate”  secu-
rity measures to guard against unauthorized access, alteration, disclo-
sure, or destruction of any personal data.
In determining what is “ appropriate,”  the organization can take 
into account the state of technological development and the cost of 
implementing the security measures. However, the organization is 
obliged to ensure that the measures it decides to adopt provide a level 
of security appropriate to the harm that might result from a security 
compromise given the nature of the data concerned. For example, a 
hospital processing sensitive health data would be expected to adopt 
a particularly high security standard, while a corner shop processing 
personal data for a paper round might be subject to a less onerous 
standard.
In light of some high-profile cases of personal data theft or per-
sonal data loss, it should also be noted that the data protection super-
visory authority’ s office may take the view that an appropriate level of 
security for laptop computers used in the financial services and health 
industries requires the use of encryption in respect of the data stored 
on the hard drive (over and above the use of user name and password 
log-in requirements).
In adopting security measures within an organization, it should 
be noted that the legal standard governing personal data is over and 
above any other legal obligations of confidentiality that could be owed 
to third parties at common law or under a contract that contains con-
fidentiality provisions.
Appraising Employees
What guidance should be given to an organization’ s employees 
regarding IT and data security? An organization might consider these 
issues.

297
SECURITY OF PERSONAL DATA
The overriding principle here is that, for it to be effective, an 
employee must have clear notice of all aspects of the organization’ s 
IT and data security policy. The following refers to some of these in 
greater detail. This is an illustrative list and is not meant as a compre-
hensive list of issues arising.
General Policy
Organizations should reserve the right to monitor use of the computer 
and telephone system, including email. Disclosure of sensitive or con-
fidential information about the company or personal data about any 
individual without authorization should be forbidden.
Email
Employees should be made aware that email is an essential busi-
ness tool but not without its risks. Business communications should 
be suitable and not too chatty and should not contain inappropriate 
material. Personal use of email must be reasonable.
Internet Access
Downloading any software without approval should be forbidden. 
No improper or illegal activities (hacking, etc.) should be tolerated. 
Access to certain types of websites (adult, criminal, hate, violent, etc.) 
should be expressly restricted. The origination or dissemination of 
inappropriate material should be forbidden.
Mobile Telephones and Devices
Downloading any software, and content, without approval should be 
forbidden. No improper or illegal activities (hacking, etc.) should be 
tolerated. Access to certain types of websites (adult, criminal, hate, 
violent, etc.) should be expressly restricted. The origination or dis-
semination of inappropriate material should be forbidden.
Vehicles
Increasingly, tracking and other data from vehicles can be related to 
identified employees. It is important for organizations to consider 
these personal data issues.

298
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
Internet Social Media
Downloading any software without approval should be forbidden. 
No improper or illegal activities (hacking, etc.) should be tolerated. 
Access to certain types of websites (adult, criminal, hate, violent, etc.) 
should be expressly restricted. The origination or dissemination of 
inappropriate material should be forbidden.
Software Installation and Management
Purchase and/or installation of software and/or content not approved 
by you should be forbidden. All software must be required to be tested 
before installation on the system to ensure that it is free from viruses, 
malware, and so on.
Password Security
Clear guidelines as to the use of passwords should be given, includ-
ing the strength of password required, the importance of keeping 
one’ s password(s) confidential, the changing of passwords at regular 
intervals, and (in the light of recent events) the application of pass-
word security (at least) to laptops, mobile phones, and personal digital 
assistants. In some businesses, stronger encryption may be appropri-
ate, and employees should be required to comply with procedures in 
this regard. Carrying organizational data on vulnerable media such as 
memory sticks should be discouraged.
Connecting Hardware
Employees should be required not to connect any hardware (memory 
sticks, hard drives, etc.) without following specified procedures and 
obtaining appropriate authorization.
Remote Access
For many businesses, remote access, including web-based remote 
access, is a vital tool. However, policies should deal with such matters 
as accessing remotely from insecure locations such as Internet café s 
and emphasize the importance of logging off effectively.

299
SECURITY OF PERSONAL DATA
Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)
Increasingly, organizations are faced with the dilemma of permitting 
employees to bring their own electronic devices into the work envi-
ronment, which may interact with the organization’ s network systems 
and data. This creates inevitable risks and complications for organiza-
tions if permitted.
Organizational Security Measures
What security measures should an organization take? Some sugges-
tions may include
•	 Ensure that the organization has the appropriate security 
equipment and software to protect the organization’ s systems 
if granting third-party access. If providing access to a third 
party involves opening its business systems up to a public net-
work such as the Internet, it is essential that suitable security 
measures are taken.
•	 Obtain a complete listing of the IT provider personnel who 
have access to organizational systems, detail their level and 
status (full-time/contractor), and ensure that their employ-
ment contracts incorporate appropriate security terms.
•	 Grant third parties access to the organization’ s systems only 
when the relevant individuals in the organization (e.g., a busi-
ness manager, in conjunction with IT staff) have agreed that 
there is a business need for such access to be granted. Access 
should be only for a temporary period and renewed at regular 
intervals.
•	 Monitor third-party computer accounts (subject to legal 
agreements between the organization and the third party and 
in accordance with legal requirements) and disable them as 
soon as access is no longer required.
•	 Ensure that sensitive files are segregated in secure areas/com-
puter systems and available only to qualified persons.
•	 Ensure that the organization has inventoried the various types 
of data being stored and classified according to how impor-
tant they are and how costly it would be for the organization 
if they were lost or stolen.

300
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
•	 Scan computers (especially servers) for unauthorized programs 
that transmit information to third parties such as hackers.
•	 Be aware of programs that have a hidden purpose, known 
as Trojans. Individuals may have inadvertently or deliberately 
downloaded free programs from the Internet that send back 
information such as passwords to hackers or Internet usage 
information to marketers to build up trends of people’ s tastes.
•	 Ensure that third parties only have access to information and 
computer settings on a need-to-know basis.
•	 Ensure that the system administrator for the organiza-
tion’ s computer systems sets up computer accounts for third 
parties so that these third parties do not have access to all 
information on the organization’ s systems or have the per-
mission to install non-standard software and change com-
puter settings.
•	 When engaging an external business to destroy records or 
electronic media, ensure that references are checked. Draft a 
contract setting out the terms of the relationship. Ensure that 
destruction is done on-site, and require that a certificate of 
destruction be issued on completion.
Particular attention also needs to be given to the deletion of data 
and the decommissioning or transfer of devices so that all personal 
data are deleted. This requires expert advice. Just because certain data 
may be deleted does not mean that it is not retrievable or that it is 
deleted from all locations.
Breach Laws to Consider
What laws might affect an organization if an organization has an IT 
or data security breach? Suggested legal issues and laws to consider 
include
•	 GDPR.
•	 DPD95.
•	 The ePrivacy Directive and the proposed ePrivacy Regulation
•	 The new EU Security Directive, once enacted.
•	 National data protection laws.
•	 eCommerce laws.

301

•	 Protection of consumers in respect of contracts made by 
means of distance communication laws.
•	 Unfair terms in consumer contract laws.
•	 Unfair terms in consumer contracts laws.
•	 Child pornography laws.
•	 Child trafficking and pornography laws.
•	 Children laws.
•	 Consumer credit laws.
•	 Consumer information laws.
•	 Copyright laws.
•	 Criminal damage laws.
•	 Criminal evidence laws.
•	 Criminal justice laws.
•	 Employment and equality laws.
•	 The Human Rights Convention.
•	 Human rights laws.
•	 Evidence.
•	 Freedom of information laws.
•	 Human rights laws.
•	 Interception and data retention laws.
•	 Employment notice and terms of employment laws.
•	 Civil liability laws.
•	 Prohibition of incitement to hatred laws.
•	 Health and safety laws.
•	 ePrivacy rules.
Other issues to consider include
•	 Official guidance and current stated positions of regulators 
and guidance bodies.
•	 International standards for organizations; for example, tech-
nical security standards, and so on.
Third-Party Security Providers
What actions should an organization take if a third party is respon-
sible for IT security or has access to its IT system? This is becoming 
increasingly popular in practice through outsourcing arrangements 
and vendor agreements. Some issues to consider include

302
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
•	 Understand the organization’ s security framework, and docu-
ment stakeholder exposure throughout the organization.
•	 Evaluate what measures to take with the organization’ s IT 
provider.
•	 Take legal advice on drafting appropriate contracts that secure 
what your IT provider is securing.
•	 Ensure that confidentiality clauses are included to protect all 
of the organization’ s intellectual property assets.
•	 Have the organization’ s IT provider supply a complete secu-
rity document outlining the hardware, topology, software, 
and methodologies deployed.
•	 Ensure that the organization’ s IT provider has staff partici-
pate in regular training programs to keep abreast of technical 
and legal issues.
•	 Ensure that the organization’ s IT provider develops a security 
breach response plan in the event that your company experi-
ences a data breach.
•	 Develop security guidelines for laptops and other portable 
devices when transported off-site.
•	 Have the organization’ s IT provider ensure that all employ-
ees follow strict password and virus-protection procedures 
and develop a mechanism where employees are required to 
change passwords often, using foolproof methods, especially 
for terminating employees.
•	 Ensure that the organization’ s IT provider has a records 
retention/disposal schedule for personally identifiable infor-
mation, whether stored in paper, micrographic. or magnetic/
electronic (computer) media.
Disposal of Computer Hardware
Particular care is needed when considering the disposal of IT hard-
ware, equipment and software, as they may still contain personal 
data files. This can continue to be the case even when it appears 
that files have been wiped or deleted. It is always advised to take 
professional legal, IT and/or forensic advice. This also applies to 
mobile devices.

303
SECURITY OF PERSONAL DATA
Conclusion
Security is a legal data protection compliance requirement, as well 
as best business practice. This is one of the more prominent areas 
of compliance where time never stands still. The security risks and 
needs must constantly be appraised and updated. It is also essential to 
ensure that outsourced data processing activities are undertaken in an 
appropriately secure manner. Increasingly, the area of appraisals and 
procedures surrounding security breaches and data loss instances is 
regulated. If such an event arises, the data protection commissioner 
as well as individual data subjects may have to be informed. Liability 
issues should also be a constant concern for organizations as regards 
security and risk, notwithstanding that the penalties have increased 
significantly. Security is also an issue of both inward- and outward-
facing concern. Employees and customers, respectively, expect their 
personal data to be respected. While the new Security Directive 
will have further provisions, it is also possible for further specifics to 
come from the EU Commission, national data protection supervisory 
authorities, and international technical standards organizations.

Data Breaches
Introduction
The new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) defines “ per-
sonal data breach”  as “ a breach of security leading to the accidental or 
unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or 
access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.”  
The importance attached to dealing with data breaches and data breach 
incidents is highlighted in the GDPR. Now, data breaches must be 
notified to the data protection supervisory authority and the individ-
ual data subjects. (Bear in mind that employees can also be individual 
data subjects.) Individual data subjects can suffer loss and damage if 
there has been a data breach, and particularly so if they are unaware 
of it and are not notified when the organization becomes aware so 
that, for example, remedial measures can be undertaken by the indi-
vidual data subject. For example, they may wish to change passwords 
or cancel credit cards, depending on the nature of the reach. Indeed, 
in some instances, organizations may need to recommend remedial or 
safety measures to individual data subjects after a data breach.
Data Breach Incidents in Context
The issue and frequency of data breaches and data breach incidents 
are highlighted in Part  1. In addition, it is clear that national data 
protection supervisory authorities take data breaches very seriously. 
Significant fines are now regularly leveled at organizations, includ-
ing large organizations and public organizations, in relation to data 
breaches. Similarly, even smaller organizations have been fined.
Data protection supervisory authorities can carry out audits and 
inspections of organizations, which can include security and data 
breach preparedness as well as resulting from a recent data breach 
incident. In fact, many data breaches result in media publicity for the 

306
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
organization, in which case the data protection supervisory authority 
is likely to contact the organization.
Background Guidance
Data Breach
A personal data breach may, if not addressed in an appropriate and 
timely manner, result in physical, material, or non-material damage to 
natural persons, such as loss of control over their personal data or limi-
tation of their rights, discrimination, identity theft or fraud, financial 
loss, unauthorized reversal of pseudonymization, damage to reputation, 
loss of confidentiality of personal data protected by professional secrecy, 
or any other significant economic or social disadvantage to the natural 
person concerned. Therefore, as soon as the controller becomes aware 
that a personal data breach has occurred, the controller should notify 
the personal data breach to the data protection supervisory authority 
without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72  hours after 
having become aware of it, unless the controller is able to demonstrate, 
in accordance with the accountability principle, that the personal data 
breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights of natural persons. 
Where such notification cannot be achieved within 72  hours, the rea-
sons for the delay should accompany the notification, and information 
may be provided in phases without undue further delay.*
Notifying Data Breach to Individual Data Subjects
The controller should communicate to the individual data subject a 
personal data breach, without undue delay, where that personal data 
breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights of the natural person, 
to allow them to take the necessary precautions. The communication 
should describe the nature of the personal data breach as well as rec-
ommendations for the natural person concerned to mitigate potential 
adverse effects. Such communications to individual data subjects should 
be made as soon as reasonably feasible and in close cooperation with the 
data protection supervisory authority, respecting guidance provided by 
it or by other relevant authorities, such as law enforcement authorities. 
*	 GDPR Recital 85.

307
DATA BREACHES
For example, the need to mitigate an immediate risk of damage would 
call for prompt communication with individual data subjects. The need 
to implement appropriate measures against continuing or similar per-
sonal data breaches may justify more time for communication.*
Notifications and Measures re Data Breaches
It should be ascertained whether all appropriate technological protec-
tion and organizational measures have been implemented to establish 
immediately whether a personal data breach has taken place and to 
inform promptly the data protection supervisory authority and the 
individual data subject. The fact that the notification was made with-
out undue delay should be established, taking into account in particular 
the nature and gravity of the personal data breach and its consequences 
and adverse effects for the individual data subject. Such notification 
may result in an intervention of the data protection supervisory author-
ity in accordance with its tasks and powers laid down in the GDPR.† In 
setting detailed rules concerning the format and procedures applicable 
to the notification of personal data breaches, due consideration should 
be given to the circumstances of that breach, including whether or not 
personal data had been protected by appropriate technical protection 
measures, effectively limiting the likelihood of identity fraud or other 
forms of misuse. Moreover, such rules and procedures should take into 
account the legitimate interests of law enforcement authorities where 
early disclosure could unnecessarily hamper the investigation of the 
circumstances of a personal data breach.‡

than 72  hours after having become aware of it notify the personal 
data breach to the competent data protection supervisory authority in 
accordance with Article 55, unless the personal data breach is unlikely 
to result in a risk to the rights of natural persons. Where the notifica-
tion to the data protection supervisory authority is not made within 
72  hours, it must be accompanied by reasons for the delay.*
The processor must notify the controller without undue delay after 
becoming aware of a personal data breach.†
This notification must at least
•	 Describe the nature of the personal data breach, including, 
where possible, the categories and approximate number of 
data subjects concerned and the categories and approximate 
number of personal data records concerned.
•	 Communicate the name and contact details of the data pro-
tection officer or other contact point from which more infor-
mation can be obtained.
•	 Describe the likely consequences of the personal data breach.
•	 Describe the measures taken or proposed to be taken by the 
controller to address the personal data breach, including, 
where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse 
effects.‡
Where, and insofar as, it is not possible to provide the information 
at the same time, the information may be provided in phases without 
undue further delay.§
The controller must document any personal data breaches, compris-
ing the facts relating to the personal data breach, its effects, and the 
remedial action taken. That documentation must enable the data pro-
tection supervisory authority to verify compliance with this Article.¶

DATA BREACHES
Communication of a Data Breach to the Data Subject
When the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the 
rights of natural persons, the controller must communicate the per-
sonal data breach to the data subject without undue delay.*
The communication to the data subject referred to in paragraph 1 
of this Article must describe in clear and plain language the nature 
of the personal data breach and contain at least the information and 
measures referred to in Article 33(3)(b), (c), and (d).†
The communication to the data subject referred to must not be 
required if any of the following conditions are met
•	 The controller has implemented appropriate technical and 
organizational protection measures, and those measures were 
applied to the personal data affected by the personal data 
breach, in particular those that render the personal data unin-
telligible to any person who is not authorized to access it, such 
as encryption.
•	 The controller has taken subsequent measures that ensure that 
the high risk to the rights of data subjects referred to is no 
longer likely to materialize.
•	 It would involve disproportionate effort. In such a case, there 
must instead be a public communication or similar measure 
whereby the data subjects are informed in an equally effective 
manner.‡
If the controller has not already communicated the personal data 
breach to the data subject, the data protection supervisory authority, 
having considered the likelihood of the personal data breach resulting 
in a high risk, may require it to do so or may decide that any of the 
conditions referred to in paragraph 3 are met.§

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
Employee Data Breaches
Employee involvement is critical in dealing with— and prepar-
ing for— data breach incidents. Various teams of employees will be 
involved. However, as employee personal data can also be the sub-
ject of a data breach incident, employees may need to be specifically 
considered in this context also. For example, they may need to be 
separately informed that there is a breach relating to their personal 
data and what actions and safeguards are being followed by the orga-
nization to deal with the issue. If the employees need to take spe-
cific actions, they may also need to be appraised of this possibility. 
Potentially, liability issues may also arise. For example, employees in 
the massive Sony data breach incidents may have considered suing 
Sony for breaches in relation to their data.
Notification Timelines
Organizations will need to assess the categories of personal data they 
have that may be involved in a data breach. They also need to assess 
what type of organization or sector they are involved in. These factors 
may dictate how the data protection regime may impose time limits 
for respective notification of breaches.
Notification Processes
Data protection officers and organizations need to develop, and 
update as appropriate, breach notification procedures. There needs 
to be an appropriate response plan for the different types of breach 
incidents, data protection supervisory authority, other regulators if 
appropriate or required, individual data subjects and other organi-
zations, whether partners, processors, outsource security, and so on.
Contracts and agreements should also be reviewed to ensure appro-
priate breach, notification, and security provisions.
Security Standards
The requirement to comply with the new GDPR regime, to 
maintain security, and to prevent and to deal with data breaches 

311
DATA BREACHES
increasingly directs attention to detailed standards and implementa-
tion measures; for example, ISO 15408, ISO 27001, ISO 31000, 
and BS10012:2009. One example is compliance with the ISO 27001 
international standard for confidentiality and security. In particular, 
it refers to
•	 Security policies.
•	 Organizational information security.
•	 HR security issues (including employees, families, and con-
tractors previously and currently).
•	 Asset identification and control.
•	 Encryption.
•	 Physical and environmental security factors.
•	 Operational security.
•	 Communications security.
•	 Acquisition, development, and maintenance of systems.
•	 Supplier relations.
•	 Security incident management.
•	 Security issues and business continuity.
•	 Compliance with internal policies and external issues such a 
data protection regime and other laws.
Also consider ISO 31000, on international risk management stan-
dards, and BS10012:2009, a standard for personal information man-
agement systems.
Organizations, including processors, must implement appropriate 
security measures, considering
•	 Impact assessments.
•	 Anonymizing data.
•	 Deleting after use purpose.
•	 Confidentiality.
•	 Integrity.
•	 Availability.
•	 Access controls and restrictions.
•	 Approved codes of conduct and certification.
•	 Separating, segregating, and securing different data sets.
•	 Encryption.

312
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
Incident Response
Some of the incident response and action points include, not in order 
of priority
•	 Incident detection and reporting.
•	 Incident notification to organization (e.g., notification or 
demand from hacker; posting online; etc.).
•	 Internal notification(s).
•	 Team notifications.
•	 Risk assessment.
•	 Impact assessments.
•	 Disciplinary action.
•	 Hacker relation action.
•	 Data protection supervisory authority external breach 
notification.
•	 Individual data subject breach notification.
•	 Customer breach notification.
Conclusion
Data breach issues should be considered in conjunction with the

Data Protection 
Impact Assessment and 
Prior Consultation
Introduction
Part of the process of dealing with security threats, data breach 
prevention, and security breaches can involve assessment or impact 
assessments in advance of incidents arising. In addition, post-event or 
post-incident reviews and assessments are necessary. These issues are 
referred to in the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
Background Guidance
High Risks
To enhance compliance with the GDPR where processing operations 
are likely to result in a high risk to the rights of natural persons, the 
controller should be responsible for the carrying-out of a data protec-
tion impact assessment to evaluate, in particular, the origin, nature, 
particularity, and severity of that risk. The outcome of the assessment 
should be taken into account when determining the appropriate mea-
sures to be taken to demonstrate that the processing of personal data 
complies with the GDPR. Where a data protection impact assess-
ment indicates that processing operations involve a high risk that the 
controller cannot mitigate by appropriate measures in terms of avail-
able technology and costs of implementation, a consultation of the 
data protection supervisory authority should take place prior to the 
processing.*
*	 GDPR Recital 84.

316
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
Data Protection Impact Assessment
A data protection impact assessment should be carried out by the 
controller prior to the processing to assess the particular likelihood 
and severity of the high risk, taking into account the nature, scope, 
context, and purposes of the processing and the sources of the risk. 
That impact assessment should include, in particular, the measures, 
safeguards, and mechanisms envisaged for mitigating that risk, 
ensuring the protection of personal data and demonstrating compli-
ance with the GDPR.*
This should in particular apply to large-scale processing operations 
that aim to process a considerable amount of personal data at regional, 
national, or supranational level, that could affect a large number of 
individual data subjects, and that are likely to result in a high risk, for 
example, on account of their sensitivity, where in accordance with the 
achieved state of technological knowledge, a new technology is used 
on a large scale, as well as to other processing operations that result in 
a high risk to the rights of individual data subjects, in particular where 
those operations render it more difficult for individual data subjects 
to exercise their rights. A data protection impact assessment should 
also be made where personal data are processed for taking decisions 
regarding specific natural persons following any systematic and exten-
sive evaluation of personal aspects relating to natural persons based on 
profiling those data or following the processing of special categories 
of personal data, biometric data, or data on criminal convictions and 
offenses or related security measures.
A data protection impact assessment is equally required for monit-
oring publicly accessible areas on a large scale, especially when using 
optic-electronic devices or for any other operations where the compe-
tent data protection supervisory authority considers that the process-
ing is likely to result in a high risk to the rights of individual data 
subjects, in particular because they prevent individual data subjects 
from exercising a right or using a service or a contract, or because 
they are carried out systematically on a large scale. The processing of 
personal data should not be considered to be on a large scale if the 
processing concerns personal data obtained from patients or clients by

IMPACT ASSESSMENT
an individual physician, other health-care professional or lawyer. In 
such cases, a data protection impact assessment should not be manda-
tory.* It may be necessary to carry out such an assessment prior to the 
processing activities.†
Where a data protection impact assessment indicates that the pro-
cessing would, in the absence of safeguards, security measures, and 
mechanisms to mitigate the risk, result in a high risk to the rights 
of natural persons, and the controller is of the opinion that the risk 
cannot be mitigated by reasonable means in terms of available tech-
nologies and costs of implementation, the data protection supervisory 
authority should be consulted prior to the start of processing activi-
ties. Such high risk is likely to result from certain types of processing 
and the extent and frequency of processing, which may result also in 
a realization of damage or interference with the rights of the natu-
ral person. The data protection supervisory authority should respond 
to the request for consultation within a specified period. However, 
the absence of a reaction of the data protection supervisory authority 
within that period should be without prejudice to any intervention of 
the data protection supervisory authority in accordance with its tasks 
and powers laid down in the GDPR, including the power to prohibit 
processing operations. As part of that consultation process, the out-
come of a data protection impact assessment carried out with regard 
to the processing at issue may be submitted to the data protection 
supervisory authority, in particular the measures envisaged to miti-
gate the risk to the rights of natural persons.‡
The processor should assist the controller, where necessary and on 
request, in ensuring compliance with the obligations deriving from 
the carrying-out of data protection impact assessments and from prior 
consultation of the data protection supervisory authority.§
*	 GDPR Recital 91. The Recital also refers to particular caveats.
†	 GDPR Recital 93.
‡	 GDPR Recital 94.
§	 GDPR Recital 95. A consultation of the data protection supervisory authority 
should also take place in the course of the preparation of a legislative or regulatory 
measure that provides for the processing of personal data to ensure compliance of 
the intended processing with this Regulation and in particular to mitigate the risk 
involved for the data subject; GDPR Recital 96.

318
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
There is also specific reference to processing carried out by a public 
authority. Where the processing is carried out by a public author-
ity, except for courts or independent judicial authorities when acting 
in their judicial capacity; where, in the private sector, processing is 
carried out by a controller whose core activities consist of process-
ing operations that require regular and systematic monitoring of the 
individual data subjects on a large scale; or where the core activities 
of the controller or the processor consist of processing on a large scale 
of special categories of personal data and data relating to criminal 
convictions and offenses, a person with expert knowledge of data pro-
tection law and practices should assist the controller or processor to 
monitor internal compliance with the GDPR. In the private sector, 
the core activities of a controller relate to its primary activities and 
do not relate to the processing of personal data as an ancillary activ-
ity. The necessary level of expert knowledge should be determined, in 
particular according to the data processing operations carried out and 
the protection required for the personal data processed by the control-
ler or the processor. Such data protection officers, whether or not they 
are employees of the controller, should be in a position to perform 
their duties and tasks in an independent manner.*
Legal Rule
Chapter  IV, Section  3 of the GDPR refers to data protection impact 
assessment (sometimes also referred to as privacy impact assessments ) 
and prior consultation.
As a result of the new GDPR regime, there is now a mandatory 
impact assessment regime. These assessments must be undertaken 
when data processing activities involve specific data protection and 
privacy risks. In particular when new products and services, or other 
changes to existing products and services, arise, the organization 
should ensure that these activities are the subject of a data protection 
impact assessment.
These impact assessments will help organizations to identify and 
understand current and new risks in their processing activities, or 
indeed to their processing activities. Considerations include
*	 GDPR Recital 97.

319
IMPACT ASSESSMENT
•	 Identifying when a project involves the collection of new 
information about individuals.
•	 Identifying whether information about individuals will be 
disclosed to organizations or people who have not previously 
had routine access to the information.
•	 Identifying whether the project involves the use of new tech-
nology that may raise privacy and data protection issues, such 
as overreach or privacy intrusion.
•	 Identifying whether the personal data raise issues or concerns 
or are in some way objectionable.
Article 35 is headed “ Data Protection Impact Assessment.”  Where 
a type of processing in particular using new technologies, and taking 
into account the nature, scope, context, and purposes of the process-
ing, is likely to result in a high risk to the rights of natural persons, 
the controller must, prior to the processing, carry out an assessment 
of the impact of the envisaged processing operations on the protec-
tion of personal data. A single assessment may address a set of similar 
processing operations that present similar high risks.*
The controller must seek the advice of the data protection offi-
cer, where designated, when carrying out a data protection impact 
assessment.†
A data protection impact assessment is required in the case of
•	 A systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects 
relating to natural persons that is based on automated pro-
cessing, including profiling, and on which decisions are based 
that produce legal effects concerning the natural person or 
similarly significantly affect the natural person.
•	 Processing on a large scale of special categories of data‡ or of 
personal data relating to criminal convictions and offenses;§ or.
•	 A systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area on a 
large scale.¶

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
The data protection supervisory authority must establish and make 
public a list of the kinds of processing operations that are subject to 
the requirement for a data protection impact assessment. The data 
protection supervisory authority must communicate those lists to the 
European Data Protection Board (EDPB).*
The data protection supervisory authority may also establish and 
make public a list of the kinds of processing operations for which 
no data protection impact assessment is required. The data protection 
supervisory authority must communicate those lists to the EDPB.†
Prior to the adoption of the lists referred to, the competent data 
protection supervisory authority must apply the consistency mecha-
nism‡ where such lists involve processing activities that are related to 
the offering of goods or services to data subjects or to the monitoring 
of their behavior in several member states, or may substantially affect 
the free movement of personal data within the EU.§
The assessment must contain at least
•	 A systematic description of the envisaged processing opera-
tions and the purposes of the processing, including, where 
applicable, the legitimate interest pursued by the controller.
•	 An assessment of the necessity and proportionality of the 
processing operations in relation to the purposes.
•	 An assessment of the risks to the rights of data subjects 
referred to; and.
•	 The measures envisaged to address the risks, including safe-
guards, security measures, and mechanisms to ensure the 
protection of personal data and to demonstrate compliance 
with the GDPR, taking into account the rights and legitimate 
interests of data subjects and other persons concerned.¶
Compliance with approved codes of conduct referred to in Article 
40 by the relevant controllers or processors must be taken into due 
account in assessing the impact of the processing operations performed

by such controllers or processors, in particular for the purposes of a 
data protection impact assessment.*
Where appropriate, the controller must seek the views of data 
subjects or their representatives on the intended processing, without 
prejudice to the protection of commercial or public interests or the 
security of processing operations.†
Where processing pursuant to Article 6(1)(c) or (e) has a legal basis 
in EU law or in the law of the member state to which the controller is 
subject, that law regulates the specific processing operation or set of 
operations in question, and a data protection impact assessment has 
already been carried out as part of a general impact assessment in the 
context of the adoption of that legal basis, paragraphs 1 to 7 must not 
apply unless member states deem it to be necessary to carry out such 
an assessment prior to processing activities.‡
Where necessary, the controller must carry out a review to assess 
whether processing is performed in accordance with the data protec-
tion impact assessment, at least when there is a change of the risk 
represented by the processing operations.§
Reasons for Assessments
Vodafone refers to the following reasons for assessments
•	 Accountability : To demonstrate that the assessment process 
was performed appropriately and in accord with the program 
of assessments agreed with the board sponsor for privacy.
•	 Provides basis for post-implementation review : To ensure that 
any privacy risks identified are allocated a business owner and 
a timetable for delivery mitigation actions, therefore provid-
ing the data protection officer with a mechanism for ensuring 
that the agreed actions are delivered with agreed timescales.
•	 Provides a basis for audit : Vodafone distinguishes between 
review, which is undertaken by the data protection officer, 
who is responsible for ensuring it is implemented and the 
*	 GDPR Article 35(8).

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
controls required are delivered, and the audit, which is an 
objective and neutral assessment undertaken by the group 
or local audit function or any other suitably qualified audit 
function that is not part of delivering the overall privacy risk 
management system.
•	 Provides corporate memory : Ensures that the information 
gained is available to those completing new assessments espe-
cially if original staff have left.
•	 Enables the experience gained during the project to be shared 
with the future assessment teams and others outside the 
organization.*
Nokia also give reasons for undertaking assessments
•	 “ To measure the implementation of privacy requirements, to 
get an understanding of the current status (risk, controls, root 
causes, etc.).” †
•	 The assessment is part of technical and organizational mea-
sures. It assists in finding out whether new projects follow the 
privacy requirements; project management; communicating 
the fulfillment of requirements; and generating status reports 
for management teams, and is an effective tool for assigning 
responsibility and fixing problems.
•	 The impact assessment serves as “ a repository for information 
requests from authorities and consumers. Consumers might 
ask Nokia where and for how long their data is stored. A data 
protection authority might, for example, ask how consumers 
are informed about privacy practices or who the controller of 
the data is. Privacy assessment might also be used to prepare 
notifications for data protection authorities.” ‡
•	 “ A means to improve general awareness. The assessment pro-
cess …  builds up competencies and privacy awareness, as it

Assessment Reports
Some key elements of an assessment report include
•	 The scope of the assessment undertaken.
•	 A summary of the consultative process undertaken.
•	 The project background paper(s) provided to those consulted
•	 Analysis of the privacy issues and risks arising from the 
assessment.
•	 The business case justifying privacy intrusion, implications, 
mitigation action, together with timelines for implementation.
•	 References to relevant laws, codes, and guidelines, including 
internal Vodafone local group policies.†
Assessment Characteristics
Common characteristics of impact assessments include
•	 Statement of problem : Is government intervention both neces-
sary and desirable?
•	 Definition of alternative remedies : These include different 
approaches, such as the use of economic incentives or volun-
tary approaches.
•	 Determination of the physical effects of each alternative, including 
potential unintended consequences : The net should be cast wide. 
Generally speaking, regulations or investments in many areas 
of public policy can have social, environmental, and other 
implications that must be kept in mind.
•	 Estimation of benefits and costs of each alternative : Benefits 
should be quantified and where possible monetized. Benefits 
should be true opportunity and costs not simply expenditures.

•	 Assessment of other economic impacts, including effects on 
competition, effects on small firms, and international trade 
implications.
•	 Identification of winners and losers: those in the community 
who stand to gain and lose from each alternative and, if pos-
sible, the extent of their gains and losses.
•	 Communication with the interested public, including the following 
activities : Notification of intent to regulate, request for com-
pliance costs and other data, public disclosure of regulatory 
proposals and supporting analysis, and consideration of and 
response to public comments.
•	 A clear choice of the preferred alternative, plus a statement 
defending that choice.
•	 Provision of a plan for ex post analysis of regulatory outcomes : It 
is important to establish a benchmark against which to mea-

dures are in place for the collection of data to permit such 
benchmarking.*
Some assessment characteristics distinguishing it from other data 
protection– related processes include the following
•	 An assessment focuses on a particular initiative or project.
•	 An assessment is performed at depth, through the project life 
cycle, and involves engagement with stakeholders.
•	 An assessment assesses a project against the needs, expec-
tations, and concerns of all stakeholders, including but not 
limited to legal requirements.
•	 An assessment assesses all aspects of privacy and data 
protection.
•	 An assessment adopts a multi-perspective approach, tak-
ing into account the costs and benefits as perceived by all 
stakeholders.

Organizations might consider issues such as the following:
•	 Preparation.
•	 Undertaking of the assessment.
•	 Timing of the assessment.
•	 Cost and resourcing the assessment.
•	 Whom the report is for.
•	 Issues and problems raised.

Prior Consultation and Risk
Article 36 refers to prior consultation obligations. The controller must 
consult the data protection supervisory authority prior to processing 
where a data protection impact assessment under Article 35 indicates 
that the processing would result in a high risk in the absence of mea-
sures taken by the controller to mitigate the risk.*
Where the data protection supervisory authority is of the opinion 
that the intended processing would infringe the GDPR, in particular 
where the controller has insufficiently identified or mitigated the risk, 
the data protection supervisory authority must, within a period of up 
to 8  weeks of receipt of the request for consultation, provide written 
advice to the controller and, where applicable, to the processor, and 
may use any of its powers. That period may be extended by 6  weeks, 
taking into account the complexity of the intended processing. The 
data protection supervisory authority must inform the controller and, 
where applicable, the processor of any such extension within 1  month 
of receipt of the request for consultation together with the reasons for 
the delay. Those periods may be suspended until the data protection 
supervisory authority has obtained information it has requested for 
the purposes of the consultation.†
When consulting the data protection supervisory authority, the 
controller must provide the data protection supervisory authority with
•	 Where applicable, the respective responsibilities of the con-
troller, joint controllers, and processors involved in the 
processing, in particular for processing within a group of 
undertakings.
•	 The purposes and means of the intended processing.

data subjects pursuant to the GDPR.
•	 Where applicable, the contact details of the data protection

•	 Any other information requested by the data protection 
supervisory authority.*
Member states must consult the data protection supervisory author-
ity during the preparation of a proposal for a legislative measure to be 
adopted by a national parliament, or of a regulatory measure based on 
such a legislative measure, which relates to processing.†
Notwithstanding this, member state law may require controllers to 
consult with, and obtain prior authorization from, the data protection 
supervisory authority in relation to processing by a controller for the 
performance of a task carried out by the controller in the public inter-
est, including processing in relation to social protection and public 
health.‡
Conclusion
Carrying out impact assessments and the like not only helps to iden-
tify privacy and data protection problems, in which case these can 
then be addressed, but it helps to raise these at the earliest stage possi-
ble. Therefore, the least expensive and least problematic time to make 
remedial changes is engaged. Carrying out such assessments is not a 
requirement under the new GDPR regime. This is especially so for 
high-risk activities and when sensitive personal data may be involved. 
These assessments ensure that organizations understand the data they 
hold and understand the likely problem issues arising. The organiza-
tion, its processes, and the ultimate customer relationship will all be 
improved. Impact assessments are ultimately one of the mechanisms 
under the new GDPR for assessing, and thus minimizing, risk in the 
personal data environment.

Data Protection 
by Design
Introduction
It has been suggested that “ law should play a more active role in 
establishing best practices for emerging online trends.” * Data protec-
tion by design and by default is a prime example. One of the most 
important and developing practical areas of data protection is the con-
cept of data protection by design as referred to in the General Data 
Protection Regulation (GDPR). Originally developed as a follow-
on from the data protection legal regime, it is now being recognized 
more widely and is also being explicitly referred to and recognized in 
primary legislation itself.
Data protection by design is important for organizations not only 
in terms of being a legal obligation but also commercially in terms of 
being a competitive advantage.†
Background
Previously, data protection by design has been referred to as privacy 
by design  or PbD. The concept of data protection by design is comple-
mentary to data protection law and regulation. The idea is acknowl-
edged to have started with Dr. Ann Cavoukian, the Information & 
Privacy Commissioner for Ontario, Canada. She states that
the increasing complexity and interconnectedness of information tech-
nologies [require] building privacy right into system design  …  the

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
concept of Privacy by Design (PbD)  …  describe[s] the philosophy of 
embedding privacy proactively into technology itself –  making it the 
default.” * 
Principles of  Data Protection by Design
The Information and Privacy Commissioner for Ontario refers to 
seven principles of PbD.† These are set out here:
Proactive Not Reactive; Preventive Not Remedial : The Privacy by 
Design (PbD) approach is characterized by proactive rather 
than reactive measures. It anticipates and prevents privacy-
invasive events before they happen. PbD does not wait for 
privacy risks to materialize, nor does it offer remedies for 
resolving privacy infractions once they have occurred— it 
aims to prevent them from occurring. In short, PbD comes 
before the fact, not after.
Privacy as the Default Setting : We can all be certain of one 
thing— the default rules. PbD seeks to deliver the maximum 
degree of privacy by ensuring that personal data are automati-
cally protected in any given information technology (IT) sys-
tem or business practice. If an individual does nothing, their 
privacy still remains intact. No action is required on the part 
of the individual to protect their privacy— it is built into the 
system, by default.
Privacy Embedded into Design : PbD is embedded into the design 
and architecture of IT systems and business practices. It is 
not bolted on as an add-on, after the fact. The result is that 
privacy becomes an essential component of the core function-
ality being delivered. Privacy is integral to the system without 
diminishing functionality.
Full Functionality: Positive-Sum, Not Zero-Sum : PbD seeks to 
accommodate all legitimate interests and objectives in a pos-
itive-sum “ win-win”  manner, not through a dated, zero-sum 
approach where unnecessary trade-offs are made. PbD avoids

331
DATA PROTECTION BY DESIGN
the pretense of false dichotomies, such as privacy vs. security, 
demonstrating that it is possible to have both.
End-to-End Security: Full Lifecycle Protection : PbD, having been 
embedded into the system prior to the first element of infor-
mation being collected, extends securely throughout the entire 
lifecycle of the data involved— strong security measures are 
essential to privacy, from start to finish. This ensures that all 
data are securely retained, and then securely destroyed at the 
end of the process, in a timely fashion. Thus, PbD ensures 
cradle-to-grave, secure lifecycle management of information, 
end-to-end.
Visibility and Transparency: Keep It Open : PbD seeks to assure all 
stakeholders that whatever the business practice or technol-
ogy involved, it is, in fact, operating according to the stated 
promises and objectives, subject to independent verification. 
Its component parts and operations remain visible and trans-
parent to users and providers alike. Remember, trust but 
verify.
Respect for User Privacy: Keep It User-Centric : Above all, PbD 
requires architects and operators to keep the interests of the 
individual uppermost by offering such measures as strong 
privacy defaults, appropriate notice, and empowering user-
friendly options. Keep it user-centric.*
Legal Rule: Data Protection by Design
The EU Commission proposed an enhanced data protection regime 
including data protection by design.† Article  25 of the data protection 
by design refers to data protection by design and by default. This is an 
increasingly important area in data protection.

solving to eliminate personal data problems arising.
Article 25 of the new GDPR refers to data protection by design 
and by default. Note also the related concept of PbD. In some ways, 
PbD is the impetus or precursor for the current data protection by 
design rules.
Taking into account the state of the art, the cost of implementa-
tion, and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing as 
well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for rights of natural 
persons posed by the processing, the controller must, both at the time 
of the determination of the means for processing and at the time of 
the processing itself, implement appropriate technical and organiza-
tional measures, such as pseudonymization, which are designed to 
implement data protection principles, such as data minimization, in 
an effective manner and to integrate the necessary safeguards into the 
processing so as to meet the requirements of the GDPR and protect 
the rights of data subjects.*
The controller must implement appropriate technical and organi-
zational measures for ensuring that, by default, only personal data 
that are necessary for each specific purpose of the processing are pro-
cessed. That obligation applies to the amount of personal data col-
lected, the extent of their processing, the period of their storage, and 
their accessibility. In particular, such measures must ensure that by 
default, personal data are not made accessible without the individual’ s 
intervention to an indefinite number of natural persons.†
An approved certification mechanism pursuant to Article 42 may 
be used as an element to demonstrate compliance with the require-
ments set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article.‡
Data protection by design is embraced by EU data protection super-
visory authorities. Prior to the new GDPD, the UK data protection 
supervisory authority (Information Commissioner’ s Office [ICO]) 
has issued recommendations in relation to privacy notices, namely, 
*	 GDPR Article 25(1).
†	 GDPR Article 25(2).
‡	 GDPR art 25(3).

333
DATA PROTECTION BY DESIGN
the Privacy Impact Assessment Code of Practice. This now needs to 
be read in light of the GDPR changes. The UK data protection super-
visory authority refers to data protection by design by saying that it 
is “ an approach whereby privacy and data protection compliance is 
designed into systems holding information right from the start, rather 
than being bolted on afterwards or ignored, as has too often been the 
case.” * It provides various documents and guidance.†
Many multinationals and other organizations are embracing data 
protection by design. Microsoft, for example, has endorsed data pro-
tection by design for a number of years now.
Conclusion
Organizations must be proactive and not reactive. Data protection 
considerations need to be considered and built in from the earliest 
stage in processes that potentially impact data protection. They must 
be transparent and visible. Problem issues are addressed and solu-
tions incorporated into the process design and process cycle so that 
pre-problem-solving is achieved for personal data. Data protection by 
design needs to be built in, not merely added or considered once a 
problem arises at the end or after go-live. However, data protection by 
design means incorporating these considerations into the whole life 
cycle and not just at the beginning and/or the end. It is also incor-
porated into engineering processes and not just system consideration 
and data categories. Data protection regime is now a key concept 
and requirement under the new data protection by design. There is 
increasing emphasis on data protection engineering as a part of the 
mechanisms needed to achieve data protection by design.

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
Data protection by design is one of the more important innovations 
in data protection generally. This is reflected in the data protection by 
design. All organizations will need to apprise themselves of the con-
cept and the regulatory compliance issues. The Google requirement 
to implement data protection by design is also timely and reflects the 
importance of enterprise, both large and small, needing to engage the 
benefits, as well as the requirements, of data protection by design.
Data protection impact assessments* are also referred to in the 
GDPR and may also be relevant in the context of data protection by 
design. Data protection impact assessments are also relevant in the 
context of developing cloud services.† Cloud services also raise impor-
tant data protection and security considerations, and these should be 
carefully considered by customers as well as providers.‡ The Article

KEY CONCEPTS 
There are various problems that can arise after the event if data 
protection compliance and security issues have not been consid-
ered in advance of the roll out of new processes, services, and 
activities. However, if data protection, risk minimization, secu-
rity, and so on are introduced at the very initial conception stage 
and included throughout the development process, the data pro-
tection risks, problems, and so on that can arise will be minimized 
in number and scale. This policy of incorporating data protection 
throughout the life cycle is known as data protection by design . 
This is expressly included as part of the GDPR obligations.

Data Protection 
as Default
Introduction
Following on from data protection by design, the General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR) introduces a complimentary concept of data protec-
tion by default. Consider the example of Google outdoor mapping and 
imaging in Streetview in the United Kingdom (and possibly elsewhere). 
In addition to the main imaging, the equipment is also said to have col-
lected individuals’  Wi-Fi data and Wi-Fi passwords. The company later 
claimed that this secondary activity was unintended. Without getting 
into the specific details, this serves as an example of how default policies 
and procedures can help to prevent unintended consequences.
Legal Rule
The controller must implement appropriate technical and organizational 
measures for ensuring that, by default, only personal data that are nec-
essary for each specific purpose of the processing are processed. That 
obligation applies to the amount of personal data collected, the extent 
of their processing, the period of their storage, and their accessibility. In 
particular, such measures must ensure that by default, personal data are 
not made accessible without the individual’ s intervention to an indefinite 
number of natural persons. This is contained in GDPR Article 25(2).
Assessments
Data protection impact assessments* are also referred to in the GDPR 
and may also be relevant in the context of data protection by default.

DATA PROTECTION AS DEFAULT
Certification
An approved certification mechanism pursuant to Article 42 may be 
used as an element to demonstrate compliance with the requirements 
set out. This is contained in GDPR Article 25(3).
Conclusion
Organizations must be proactive and not reactive. Data protection 
considerations need to be considered and built in from the earliest 
stage in processes that potentially impact data protection. They 
must be transparent and visible. Problem issues are addressed and 
solutions incorporated into the process design and process cycle 
so that pre-problem-solving is achieved for personal data. Data 
protection by default needs to be built in, not merely added or con-
sidered once a problem arises at the end or after go-live. However, 
data protection by default means incorporating these consider-
ations into the whole life cycle and not just at the beginning and/
or the end. It is also incorporated into engineering processes and 
not just system consideration and data categories. Data protection 
by default is now a key concept and requirement under the new 
GDPD. There is increasing emphasis on privacy engineering as 
a part of the mechanisms needed to achieve data protection by 
design.
Data protection by default is one of the more important innova-
tions in data protection generally. This is reflected in the GDPR. All 
organizations will need to apprise themselves of the concept and the 
regulatory compliance issues.
KEY CONCEPTS 
Data protection by default can assist organizations in reduc-
ing adverse data protection incidents. As stated previously, 
incorporating data protection by default can assist in avoiding 
problems that might otherwise arise, whether predictable or 
unanticipated.

Cross-Border 
Transfers of Data
Introduction
Organizations are under ever-increasing pressure to reduce costs. 
This can sometimes involve consideration of outsourcing to countries 
outside of the EU. Any transfers, unless specifically excepted, are 
restricted.
In addition, the global nature of commercial activities means that 
organizations as part of normal business processes may seek to transfer 
particular sets of personal data to group entities that may be located 
outside of the EU. There can be similar situations where an organiza-
tion wishes to make trans-border data flows to agents, partners, or 
outsourced processors.
The data protection regime controls and regulates transfers of per-
sonal data* from the United Kingdom to jurisdictions outside of the 
EU. Transfers of personal data outside of the EU are known as cross-
border transfers .† Frequently, organizations would have transferred per-
sonal data to other sections within their international organizations, 
such as banks. This could be personal data in relation to customers as 
well as employees (e.g., where the personnel or payroll section may be 
in a different country).

Taxation Publishers, 1990).

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
This trend of cross-border transfers has increased, however, as 
more and more activity is carried out online, such as eCommerce and 
social media. Personal data are frequently transferred or mirrored on 
computer servers in more than one country as a matter of technical 
routine.
However, organizations need to be aware that any transfer of per-
sonal data of EU citizens needs to be in compliance with the EU 
data protection regime. One of the obligations is that cross-border 
transfers of personal data may not occur.* This default position can be 
derogated from if one of a limited number of criteria is satisfied.
Background Guidance
Cross-Border Flows
Economic and social integration increases cross-border flows. The 
exchange of data has increased.† Rapid technological developments 
and globalization have brought new challenges for the protection 
of personal data. The scale of the collection and sharing of per-
sonal data has increased significantly. Technology allows both pri-
vate companies and public authorities to make use of personal data 
on an unprecedented scale to pursue their activities. Natural persons 
increasingly make personal information available publicly and glob-
ally. Technology has transformed both the economy and social life 
and should, further, facilitate the free flow of personal data within 
the EU and the transfer to third countries and international organi-
zations, while ensuring a high level of protection of personal data.‡ 
Those developments require a strong and more coherent data protec-
tion framework in the EU, backed by strong enforcement, given the 
importance of creating the trust that will allow the digital economy 
to develop across the internal market. Natural persons should have 
control of their own personal data. Legal and practical certainty for 
natural persons, economic operators, and public authorities should be

Cross-Border Transfers of Data
enhanced.* Flows of personal data to and from countries outside the 
EU and international organizations are necessary for the expansion 
of international trade and international cooperation. The increase in 
such flows has raised new challenges and concerns with regard to the 
protection of personal data. However, when personal data are trans-
ferred from the EU to controllers, processors, or other recipients in 
third countries or to international organizations, the level of pro-
tection of natural persons ensured in the EU by the General Data 
Protection Regulation (GDPR) should not be undermined, including 
in cases of onward transfers of personal data from the third country 
or international organization to controllers and processors in the same 
or another third country or international organization. In any event, 
transfers to third countries and international organizations may only 
be carried out in full compliance with the GDPR. A transfer can take 
place only if, subject to the other provisions of the GDPR, the condi-
tions laid down in the provisions of the GDPR relating to the transfer 
of personal data to third countries or international organizations are 
complied with by the controller or processor.†
Transfer Agreements and Mechanisms
The GDPR is without prejudice to international agreements con-
cluded between the EU and third countries regulating the transfer of 
personal data including appropriate safeguards for the individual data 
subjects. Member states may conclude international agreements that 
involve the transfer of personal data to third countries or international 
organizations, as far as such agreements do not affect the GDPR or 
any other provisions of EU law and include an appropriate level of 
protection for the fundamental rights of the individual data subjects.‡ 
The EU Commission may decide with effect for the entire EU that a 
third country, a territory or specified sector within a third country, or 
an international organization offers an adequate level of data protec-
tion, thus providing legal certainty and uniformity throughout the 
EU as regards the third country or international organization that is 
*	 GDPR Recital 7.
†	 GDPR Recital 101.
‡	 GDPR Recital 102.

34 4
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
considered to provide such level of protection. In such cases, transfers 
of personal data to that third country or international organization 
may take place without the need to obtain any further authorization. 
The EU Commission may also decide, having given notice and a full 
statement setting out the reasons to the third country or international 
organization, to revoke such a decision.*
In line with the fundamental values on which the EU is founded, 
in particular the protection of human rights, the EU Commission 
should, in its assessment of the third country or of a territory or speci-
fied sector within a third country, take into account how a particular 
third country respects the rule of law and access to justice as well as 
international human rights norms and standards and its general and 
sectoral law, including legislation concerning public security, defense, 
and national security as well as public order and criminal law. The 
adoption of an adequacy decision with regard to a territory or a speci-
fied sector in a third country should take into account clear and objec-
tive criteria, such as specific processing activities and the scope of 
applicable legal standards and legislation in force in the third country. 
The third country should offer guarantees ensuring an adequate level 
of protection essentially equivalent to that ensured within the EU, in 
particular where personal data are processed in one or several specific 
sectors. In particular, the third country should ensure effective inde-
pendent data protection supervision and should provide for coopera-
tion mechanisms with the member states’  data protection authorities, 
and the individual data subjects should be provided with effective and 
enforceable rights and effective administrative and judicial redress.†
Apart from the international commitments the third country or 
international organization has entered into, the EU Commission 
should take account of obligations arising from the third country’ s or 
international organization’ s participation in multilateral or regional 
systems, in particular in relation to the protection of personal data, as 
well as the implementation of such obligations. In particular, the third 
country’ s accession to the Council of Data Protection Convention 
should be taken into account. The EU Commission should consult the 
*	 GDPR Recital 103.
†	 GDPR Recital 104.

345
Cross-Border Transfers of Data
European Data Protection Board (EDPB) when assessing the level of 
protection in third countries or international organizations.*
The EU Commission should monitor the functioning of decisions 
on the level of protection in a third country, a territory or specified 
sector within a third country, or an international organization and 
monitor the functioning of decisions adopted on the basis of Article 
25(6) or Article 26(4) of the 1995 data protection directive (DPD95). 
In its adequacy decisions, the EU Commission should provide for a 
periodic review mechanism of their functioning. That periodic review 
should be conducted in consultation with the third country or inter-
national organization in question and take into account all relevant 
developments in the third country or international organization. For 
the purposes of monitoring and of carrying out the periodic reviews, 
the EU Commission should take into consideration the views and 
findings of the European Parliament and of the Council as well as of 
other relevant bodies and sources. The EU Commission should evalu-
ate, within a reasonable time, the functioning of the latter decisions 
and report any relevant findings to the Committee within the mean-
ing of Regulation 182/2011 as established under the GDPR, to the 
European Parliament and to the EU Council.†
The EU Commission may recognize that a third country, a terri-
tory or a specified sector within a third country, or an international 
organization no longer ensures an adequate level of data protection. 
Consequently, the transfer of personal data to that third country or 
international organization should be prohibited, unless the require-
ments in the GDPR relating to transfers subject to appropriate safe-
guards, including binding corporate rules, and derogations for specific 
situations are fulfilled. In that case, provision should be made for con-
sultations between the EU Commission and such third countries or 
international organizations. The EU Commission should, in a timely 
manner, inform the third country or international organization of the 
reasons and enter into consultations with it to remedy the situation.‡
In the absence of an adequacy decision, the controller or processor 
should take measures to compensate for the lack of data protection in

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
a third country by way of appropriate safeguards for the individual 
data subject. Such appropriate safeguards may consist of making use 
of binding corporate rules, standard data protection clauses adopted 
by the EU Commission, standard data protection clauses adopted by 
a data protection supervisory authority, or contractual clauses autho-
rized by a data protection supervisory authority. Those safeguards 
should ensure compliance with data protection requirements and the 
rights of the individual data subjects appropriate to processing within 
the EU, including the availability of enforceable individual data sub-
ject rights and of effective legal remedies, including to obtain effective 
administrative or judicial redress and to claim compensation, in the 
EU or in a third country. They should relate in particular to compli-
ance with the general principles relating to personal data processing, 
the principles of data protection by design and by default. Transfers 
may also be carried out between public authorities or bodies and pub-
lic authorities or bodies in third countries or international organiza-
tions with corresponding duties or functions, including on the basis 
of provisions to be inserted into administrative arrangements, such as 
a memorandum of understanding, providing enforceable and effective 
rights for individual data subjects. Authorization by the competent 
data protection supervisory authority should be obtained when the 
safeguards are provided for in administrative arrangements that are 
not legally binding.*
The possibility for the controller or processor to use standard data 
protection clauses adopted by the EU Commission or by a data pro-
tection supervisory authority should not prevent controllers or proces-
sors either from including the standard data-protection clauses in a 
wider contract, such as a contract between the processor and another 
processor, or from adding other clauses or additional safeguards pro-
vided that they do not contradict, directly or indirectly, the standard 
contractual clauses adopted by the EU Commission or by a data pro-
tection supervisory authority or prejudice the fundamental rights or 
freedoms of the individual data subjects. Controllers and processors 
should be encouraged to provide additional safeguards via contractual 
commitments that supplement standard protection clauses.†

†	 GDPR Recital 109.

347
Cross-Border Transfers of Data
A group of undertakings, or a group of enterprises engaged in a 
joint economic activity, should be able to make use of approved bind-
ing corporate rules for its international transfers from the EU to 
organizations within the same group of undertakings, or groups of 
enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity, provided that such 
corporate rules include all the essential principles and enforceable 
rights to ensure appropriate safeguards for transfers or categories of 
transfers of personal data.*
Provisions should be made for the possibility for transfers in cer-
tain circumstances where the individual data subject has given their 
explicit consent, where the transfer is occasional and necessary in rela-
tion to a contract or a legal claim, regardless of whether this is in a 
judicial procedure or in an administrative or any out-of-court proce-
dure, including procedures before regulatory bodies. Provision should 
also be made for the possibility for transfers where important grounds 
of public interest laid down by EU or member state law so require 
or where the transfer is made from a register established by law and 
intended for consultation by the public or persons having a legiti-
mate interest. In the latter case, such a transfer should not involve the 
entirety of the personal data or entire categories of the data contained 
in the register, and when the register is intended for consultation by 
persons having a legitimate interest, the transfer should be made only 
at the request of those persons or, if they are to be the recipients, 
taking into full account the interests and fundamental rights of the 
individual data subject.†
Those derogations should in particular apply to data transfers 
required and necessary for important reasons of public interest, for 
example in cases of international data exchange between competi-
tion authorities or tax or customs administrations, between financial 
supervisory authorities, or between services competent for social secu-
rity matters or for public health, for example in the case of contact 
tracing for contagious diseases or to reduce and/or eliminate doping 
in sport. A transfer of personal data should also be regarded as law-
ful where it is necessary to protect an interest that is essential for the 
individual data subject’ s or another person’ s vital interests, including

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
physical integrity or life, if the individual data subject is incapable of 
giving consent. In the absence of an adequacy decision, EU or mem-
ber state law may, for important reasons of public interest, expressly 
set limits to the transfer of specific categories of data to a third coun-
try or an international organization. Member states should notify 
such provisions to the EU Commission. Any transfer to an interna-
tional humanitarian organization of personal data of an individual 
data subject who is physically or legally incapable of giving consent, 
with a view to accomplishing a task incumbent under the Geneva 
Conventions or to complying with international humanitarian law 
applicable in armed conflicts, could be considered to be necessary for 
an important reason of public interest or because it is in the vital inter-
est of the individual data subject.*
Transfers that can be qualified as not repetitive, and that only con-
cern a limited number of individual data subjects, could also be pos-
sible for the purposes of the compelling legitimate interests pursued 
by the controller when those interests are not overridden by the inter-
ests or rights of the individual data subject and when the controller 
has assessed all the circumstances surrounding the data transfer. The 
controller should give particular consideration to the nature of the 
personal data and the purpose and duration of the proposed process-
ing operation or operations, as well as the situation in the country of 
origin, the third country, and the country of final destination, and 
should provide suitable safeguards to protect the fundamental rights 
of natural persons with regard to the processing of their personal data. 
Such transfers should be possible only in residual cases where none of 
the other grounds for transfer are applicable. For scientific or historical 
research purposes or statistical purposes, the legitimate expectations 
of society for an increase of knowledge should be taken into consid-
eration. The controller should inform the data protection supervisory 
authority and the individual data subject about the transfer.†
In any case, where the EU Commission has taken no decision on 
the adequate level of data protection in a third country, the controller 
or processor should make use of solutions that provide individual data 
subjects with enforceable and effective rights as regards the processing

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
Permitting Transfers via Adequacy Decision
A transfer of personal data to a third country or an international 
organization may take place where the EU Commission has decided 
that the third country, a territory or one or more specified sectors 
within that third country, or the international organization in ques-
tion ensures an adequate level of protection. Such a transfer must not 
require any specific authorization.*
When assessing the adequacy of the level of protection, the EU 
Commission must, in particular, take account of the following 
elements
•	 The rule of law, respect for human rights and fundamental 
freedoms, relevant legislation, both general and sectoral, 
including concerning public security, defense, national secu-
rity and criminal law and the access of public authorities to 
personal data, as well as the implementation of such legis-
lation, data protection rules, professional rules and security 
measures, including rules for the onward transfer of personal 
data to another third country or international organization 
that are complied with in that country or international orga-
nization, case law, as well as effective and enforceable data 
subject rights and effective administrative and judicial redress 
for the data subjects whose personal data are being transferred.
•	 The existence and effective functioning of one or more inde-
pendent data protection supervisory authorities in the third 
country or to which an international organization is subject, 
with responsibility for ensuring and enforcing compliance 
with the data protection rules, including adequate enforce-
ment powers, for assisting and advising the data subjects in 
exercising their rights and for cooperation with the data pro-
tection supervisory authorities of the member states; and
•	 The international commitments the third country or inter-
national organization concerned has entered into, or other 
obligations arising from legally binding conventions or 
*	 GDPR Article 45(1).

Cross-Border Transfers of Data
instruments as well as from its participation in multilateral or 
regional systems, in particular in relation to the protection of 
personal data.*
The EU Commission, after assessing the adequacy of the level of 
protection, may decide, by means of implementing act, that a third 
country, a territory or one or more specified sectors within a third 
country, or an international organization ensures an adequate level of 
protection. The implementing act must provide for a mechanism for 
a periodic review, at least every 4  years, which must take into account 
all relevant developments in the third country or international organi-
zation. The implementing act must specify its territorial and sectoral 
application and, where applicable, identify the data protection super-
visory authority or authorities referred to in point (b) of paragraph 2 
of this Article.†
The EU Commission must, on an ongoing basis, monitor develop-
ments in third countries and international organizations that could 
affect the functioning of decisions adopted pursuant to paragraph 3 
of this Article and decisions previously adopted on the basis of the 
DPD95.‡
The EU Commission must, where available information reveals, 
in particular following the review referred to in paragraph 3 of this 
Article, that a third country, a territory or one or more specified sec-
tors within a third country, or an international organization no longer 
ensures an adequate level of protection within the meaning of para-
graph 2 of this Article, to the extent necessary, repeal, amend, or sus-
pend the decision referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article by means 
of implementing acts without retro-active effect.§
The EU Commission must enter into consultations with the third 
country or international organization with a view to remedying the 
situation giving rise to the decision made.¶

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
A decision pursuant to paragraph 5 of this Article is without 
prejudice to transfers of personal data to the third country, a terri-
tory or one or more specified sectors within that third country, or 
the international organization in question.*
The EU Commission must publish in the Official Journal of the EU  
and on its website a list of the third countries, territories and speci-
fied sectors within a third country, and international organizations 
for which it has decided that an adequate level of protection is or is no 
longer ensured.†
Decisions adopted by the EU Commission on the basis of Article 
25(6) of DPD95 must remain in force until amended, replaced, or 
repealed by an EU Commission Decision.‡
Note that the EU–US Safe Harbor data transfer regime was struck 
down by the EU Court of Justice in the Schrems  case.§ The Safe Harbor 
regime was held to be invalid. Notwithstanding the GDPR, the 
previous Safe Harbor regime will have to be replaced. Negotiations 
between the EU Commission and the US authorities seem to have 
reached a new agreement entitled the EU–US Privacy Shield.
It should be noted also that there have been some concerns that 
the same or similar reasons for the striking down of the Safe Harbor 
regime may cause concerns for some of the other transfer-legitimizing 
mechanisms. It remains to be seen whether further challenges or con-
cerns will arise.
Adequate Protection Exception
If the recipient country has been deemed by the EU to already have 
an adequate level of protection for personal data, then the transfer 
is permitted. It is provided that a transfer can occur where there

has been a positive Community finding in relation to the type of 
transfer proposed. A Community finding means a finding of the EU 
Commission, under the procedure provided for in Article 31(2) of the 
DPD95, that a country or territory outside the European Economic 
Area does, or does not, ensure an adequate level of protection within 
the meaning of Article 25(2) of the Directive.
The EU Commission provides a list of EU Commission decisions 
on the adequacy of the protection of personal data in third coun-
tries.*  The EU Commission has thus far recognized Switzerland, 
Canada, Argentina, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, the US Department 
of Commerce’ s Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, and the transfer of air 
passenger name records to the United States Bureau of Customs and 
Border Protection as providing adequate protection.
Transfers via Appropriate Safeguards
In the absence of a decision pursuant to Article 45(3), a controller or 
processor may transfer personal data to a third country or an inter-
national organization only if the controller or processor has adduced 
appropriate safeguards and on condition that enforceable individual 
data subject rights and effective legal remedies for individual data sub-
jects are available.†
The appropriate safeguards referred to in Article 46(1) may be pro-
vided for, without requiring any specific authorization from a data 
protection supervisory authority, by
•	 A legally binding and enforceable instrument between public 
authorities or bodies.
•	 Binding corporate rules.‡
•	 Standard data protection clauses adopted by the EU 
Commission.§
•	 Standard data protection clauses adopted by a data protection 
supervisory authority and approved by the EU Commission 
*	 At http://ec.europa.eu/justice/policies/privacy/thridcountries/index_en.htm.

‡	 In accordance with Article 47.
§	 In accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 93(2).

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
pursuant to the examination procedure referred to in Article 
93(2).
•	 An approved code of conduct pursuant to Article 40 together 
with binding and enforceable commitments of the controller 
or processor in the third country to apply the appropriate safe-
guards, including as regards data subjects’  rights; or.
•	 An approved certification mechanism pursuant to Article 42 
together with binding and enforceable commitments of the 
controller or processor in the third country to apply the appro-
priate safeguards, including as regards data subjects’  rights.*
Subject to the authorization from the competent data protection 
supervisory authority, the appropriate safeguards† may also be pro-
vided for, in particular, by
•	 Contractual clauses between the controller or processor and 
the controller, the processor or the recipient of the personal 
data in the third country or international organization; or
•	 Provisions to be inserted into administrative arrangements 
between public authorities or bodies that include enforceable 
and effective data subject rights.‡
Authorizations by a member state or data protection supervisory 
authority on the basis of Article 26(2) of DPD95 must remain valid 
until amended, replaced, or repealed, if necessary, by that data protec-
tion supervisory authority. Decisions adopted by the EU Commission 
on the basis of Article 26(4) of DPD95 must remain in force until 
amended, replaced, or repealed, if necessary, by a Commission 
Decision adopted in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article.§
Creating Adequacy through Consent, Contract
One solution involves “ creating adequacy”  through consent. Under 
Article 26 of the DPD95, transfers can be made to a non-EU coun-
try where the unambiguous consent of the individual data subject to

that transfer is obtained. Transfers of data to a third country may be 
made even though there is not adequate protection in place if the con-
troller secures the necessary level of protection through contractual 
obligations. This refers to the model contract clauses from the EU 
Commission. The EU Commission has issued what it considers to 
be adequate clauses that, incorporated into the contract relationship 
of the data exporter and the data importer, should then provide an 
adequate level of consent.
Transfers via Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs)
The EU Commission and the WP29* also developed a policy of rec-
ognizing adequate protection of the policies of multinational organi-
zations transferring personal data that satisfy the determined BCRs, 
pursuant to the DPD95 Article 26(2).† Organizations that have con-
tracts, policies, and procedures that satisfy the binding corporate 
rules and are accepted as doing so after a review process with the EU 
Commission or one of the member states’  data protection authorities 
can transfer personal data outside of the EU within the organization. 
Recently, Intel and its BCRs have been examined and approved by 
one of the data protection supervisory authorities.‡ This now provides 
a passporting recognition in the EU member states.
The competent data protection supervisory authority must approve 
BCRs in accordance with the consistency mechanism set out in 
Article 63, provided that they

Cross-Border Transfers of Data
Transfers or Disclosures Not Authorized by EU Law
Any judgment of a court or tribunal and any decision of an adminis-
trative authority of a third country requiring a controller or proces-
sor to transfer or disclose personal data may only be recognized or 
enforceable in any manner if based on an international agreement, 
such as a mutual legal assistance treaty, in force between the request-
ing third country and the EU or a member state, without prejudice to 
other grounds for transfer.*
Transfers via Derogations for Specific Situations
In the absence of an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45(3) or 
of appropriate safeguards pursuant to Article 46, including BCRs, a 
transfer or a set of transfers of personal data to a third country or an 
international organization must take place only on one of the follow-
ing conditions
•	 The data subject has explicitly consented to the proposed 
transfer after having been informed of the possible risks of 
such transfers for the data subject due to the absence of an 
adequacy decision and appropriate safeguards. [a]
•	 The transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract 
between the data subject and the controller or the implemen-
tation of pre-contractual measures taken at the data subject’ s 
request. [b]
•	 The transfer is necessary for the conclusion or performance 
of a contract concluded in the interest of the data subject 
between the controller and another natural or legal person. [c]
•	 The transfer is necessary for important reasons of public 
interest.
•	 The transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise, or 
defense of legal claims.
•	 The transfer is necessary to protect the vital interests of the 
data subject or of other persons where the data subject is phys-
ically or legally incapable of giving consent.
*	 GDPR Article 48.

360
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
•	 The transfer is made from a register that, according to EU or 
member state law, is intended to provide information to the 
public and that is open to consultation either by the public in 
general or by any person who can demonstrate a legitimate 
interest, but only to the extent that the conditions laid down 
by EU or member state law for consultation are fulfilled in the 
particular case.* [g]
Where a transfer could not be based on a provision in Article 45 or 
46, including the provisions on BCRs, and none of the derogations for 
a specific situation referred to in the first subparagraph of this para-
graph is applicable, a transfer to a third country or an international 
organization may take place only if the transfer is not repetitive, con-
cerns only a limited number of data subjects, and is necessary for the 
purposes of compelling legitimate interests pursued by the controller 
that are not overridden by the interests or rights of the data subject, 
and the controller has assessed all the circumstances surrounding the 
data transfer and has on the basis of that assessment provided suitable 
safeguards with regard to the protection of personal data. The con-
troller must inform the data protection supervisory authority of the 
transfer. The controller must, in addition to providing the information 
referred to in Articles 13 and 14, inform the data subject of the trans-
fer and of the compelling legitimate interests pursued.†
A transfer pursuant to point (g) of the first subparagraph of para-
graph 1 must not involve the entirety of the personal data or entire 
categories of the personal data contained in the register. Where the 
register is intended for consultation by persons having a legitimate 
interest, the transfer must be made only at the request of those per-
sons or if they are to be the recipients.‡
Points (a), (b), and (c) of the first subparagraph of paragraph 1 and 
the second subparagraph thereof must not apply to activities carried 
out by public authorities in the exercise of their public powers.§

361
Cross-Border Transfers of Data
The public interest referred to in point (d) of the first subparagraph 
of paragraph 1 must be recognized in EU law or in the law of the 
member state to which the controller is subject.*
In the absence of an adequacy decision, EU or member state law 
may, for important reasons of public interest, expressly set limits to 
the transfer of specific categories of personal data to a third country or 
an international organization. Member states must notify such provi-
sions to the EU Commission.†
The controller or processor must document the assessment as well 
as the suitable safeguards referred to in the second subparagraph of 
paragraph 1 of this Article in the records referred to in Article 30.‡
Exceptions
If the recipient country’ s protection is not adequate or perhaps 
not ascertainable, but it is intended that cross-border transfers are 
required, the organization should then ascertain whether the transfer 
comes within one of the excepted categories.
Transfers of personal data from the EU to outside the EU cannot 
occur unless exempted, such as
•	 The individual data subject has given consent.
•	 The transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract 
between an individual data subject and a controller.
•	 The transfer is necessary for taking steps at the request of an 
individual data subject with a view to entering into a contract 
with the controller.
•	 The transfer is necessary for the conclusion of a contract 
between the controller and a person other than the individual 
data subject, which is entered into at the request of the indi-
vidual data subject and is in the interests of the individual data 
subject.
•	 The transfer is necessary for the performance of such a 
contract.
*	 GDPR Article 49(4).
†	 GDPR Article 49(5).
‡	 GDPR Article 49(6).

362
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
•	 The transfer is required or authorized under any enactment or 
instrument imposing international obligation.
•	 The transfer is necessary for reasons of substantial public 
interest.
•	 The transfer is necessary for purposes of or in connection with 
legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings.
•	 The transfer is necessary to prevent injury or damage to the 
health of the individual data subject or serious loss of or dam-
age to the property of the individual data subject or otherwise 
to protect vital interests.
•	 Subject to certain conditions, the transfer is only part of 
the personal data on a register established by or under an 
enactment.
•	 The transfer has been authorized by data protection super-
visory authorities where the controller adduces adequate 
safeguards.
•	 The transfer is made to a country that has been determined by 
the EU Commission as having “ adequate levels of protection.” 
•	 The transfer is made to a US entity that has signed up to the 
EU–US Safe Harbor arrangements; or
•	 The EU Commission contract provisions (i.e., the model con-
tract clauses issues by the EU Commission) apply.
Therefore, for example, where a customer books a hotel in New 
York through an agent in London, it is necessary for the ultimate 
performance of the contract for the personal data to be transferred to 
the hotel in New York from the United Kingdom. The transfer of the 
personal data is permitted.
However, when an EU company processes its employee payroll 
personal data to a US parent company, such a transfer is for the con-
venience of the company and is not strictly necessary for the perfor-
mance of a contract.
Issues
Certain issues may arise in relation to the following:
•	 What is a “ transfer” ? Is there a difference between transfer 
and transit?

363
Cross-Border Transfers of Data
•	 “ Data”  and anonymized data: Is there a restriction on cross-
border transfers of anonymized data? For example, can certain 
anonymized data fall outside the definition of personal data?
•	 “ Third country”  currently includes the EU countries and 
the European Economic Area (EEA) countries of Iceland, 
Norway, and Liechtenstein. The EU countries are expanding 
over time. In addition, the list of permitted additional third 
countries is expanding over time; for example, Safe Harbor.
•	 How the EU–US Safe Harbor transfer problem will be 
resolved after the EU Court of Justice struck down the origi-
nal EU–US Safe Harbor data transfer agreement.* Many 
organizations used this as the legitimizing basis for the lawful 
transfer of personal data from the EU to the United States.
Establishing Whether the Ban Applies
Criteria for assessing whether the ban applies include the following 
issues
•	 Identifying whether the organization transfers personal data.
•	 Identifying whether there is a transfer.
•	 Identifying whether there is a transfer to a “ third country.” 
•	 Identifying whether that third country has an adequate level 
of protection.
•	 Identifying, in relation to transfers to the United States, 
whether the Safe Harbor (or now the Privacy Shield) rules 
apply.
•	 Identifying whether any of the white list countries are recipi-
ents; considering what constitutes adequacy.
•	 Identifying the nature of the data; identifying how it is to be 
used.
•	 Considering the laws and practices in place in the third coun-
try; identifying whether there is a transfer by a controller to 
a processor. Under Article 7 [of the DPD95], such a transfer 
requires a contract to be put in place relating to security mea-
sures to date. The controller retains control of the personal

data, so that the risk to the individual data subject is mini-
mal; identify whether there is a transfer within an interna-
tional or multinational company or group of companies where 
an internal privacy code or agreement is in place; identify 
whether there is a transfer within a consortium established 
to process international transactions; for example, banking; 
identify whether there is a transfer between professionals 
such as lawyers or accountants where a client’ s business has 
an international dimension. The EU Commission has identi-
fied core principles that must be present in the foreign laws or 
codes of practice or regulations to achieve the requisite stan-
dard of “ adequacy”  in third-party countries; identify whether 
these are applicable in the particular instance. Personal data 
must be processed for a specific purpose; identify what this 
purpose is.
•	 Personal data must be accurate and kept up to date; ensuring 
that this applies. The individual data subject must be provided 
with adequate information in relation to the transfer; ensuring 
that this principle is complied with. Technical and organiza-
tional security measures should be taken by the controller.
•	 Ensuring that there is a right of access to the data by the indi-
vidual data subject; there should be a prohibition on onward 
transfer of data along the lines of Article 25 of the DPD95; 
and
•	 Ensuring that there is an effective procedure or mode of 
enforcement.
Organizations should be aware that if they wish to transfer per-
sonal data outside of the EU, additional considerations arise, and that 
unless there is a specific exemption, the transfer may not be permitted. 
Once a transfer possibility arises, the organization should undertake 
a compliance exercise to assess whether the transfer can be permitted, 
and if so, how. Additional compliance documentation and contracts 
may be required.
The increasing number of locations and methods by which personal 
data may be collected by organizations, in particular Internet, commu-
nications, and social media, will increasingly be scrutinized in terms 
of transparency, consent, and compliance. Equally, cloud computing

is receiving particular data protection attention. Apps are also being 
considered, as is the developing area of the Internet of Things (IoT) 
and related data protection compliance issues.
Schrems, EU–US Safe Harbor, and EU–US Privacy Shield
One of the transfer mechanisms enabling the transfer of data from 
the EU to the United States was the EU Commission arrange-
ment with the United States entitled the Safe Harbor arrangement. 
US companies would self-certify that they would adhere to the 
Safe Harbor principles and register in the United States as being 
Safe Harbor compliant. However, in one of the ripples from the 
Snowden disclosures, Austrian law student Max Schrems asked 
the Data Protection Commissioner to investigate Facebook as 
being in breach of the EU law in relation to transfers of data from 
Facebook to US authorities. The Commissioner felt constrained by 
the Commission Safe Harbor arrangement. Schrems took a Judicial 
Review case in the Irish High Court, which was ultimately referred 
to the EU Court of Justice.
The EU Court of Justice in the Schrems  case referral* struck down 
the Safe Harbor regime as invalid under the EU data protection 
regime. That is, it was struck down under the DPD95 and the current 
data protection regime, and not the later GDPR and the updated data 
protection regime.
The questions referred to the EU Court of Justice by the High 
Court were
Whether in the course of determining a complaint which has been 
made to an independent office holder who has been vested by statute 
with the functions of administering and enforcing data protection leg-
islation that personal data is being transferred to another third country 
*	 Schrems v Commissioner, Court of Justice, Case C-362/14, October 6, 2015. The 
case technically related to Prism and Facebook Europe and transfers to the United 
States. However, the wider import turned out to be the entire EU-US Safe Harbor 
Agreement and data transfers to the United States. Note WP29 statement on the 
case, Statement  on the implementation of the judgement  of the Court of Justice of 
the European Union of 6 October 2015 in the Maximilian Schrems v Data Protection 
Commissioner case (C-362-14).

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
(in this case, the US) the laws and practices of which, it is claimed, do 
not contain adequate protections for the individual data subject, that 
office holder is absolutely bound by the Community finding to the con-
trary contained in Commission Decision of 26 July 2000 (2000/520/
EC) having regard to Article 7, Article 8 and Article 47 of the EU 
Charter, the provisions of Article 25(6) of DPD95 notwithstanding?
Or, alternatively, may and/or must the office holder conduct their 
own investigation of the matter in the light of factual developments in 
the meantime since that Commission Decision was first published?
The EU Court of Justice (Grand Chamber) held that
Article  25(6) of [DPD95]* …  read in the light of Articles  7, 8 and 47 
of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, must be 
interpreted as meaning that a decision adopted pursuant to that pro-
vision, such as Commission Decision 2000/520/EC of 26  July 2000 
pursuant to [DPD95] on the adequacy of the protection provided by 
the safe harbor privacy principles and related frequently asked ques-
tions issued by the US Department of Commerce, by which the EU 
Commission finds that a third country ensures an adequate level of pro-
tection, does not prevent a [data protection] supervisory authority of 
a member state, within the meaning of Article  28 of that directive as 
amended, from examining the claim of a person concerning the protec-
tion of their rights and freedoms in regard to the processing of personal 
data relating to them which has been transferred from a member state to 
that third country when that person contends that the law and practices 
in force in the third country do not ensure an adequate level of protection .
Decision 2000/520 is invalid  [i.e., the decision on which the US–EU 
Safe Harbor transfer exemption was based]
Notwithstanding the case itself, there were already longstand-
ing negotiations going on between the EU and the United States 
to amend, update, and/or replace the Safe Harbor regime. This has 
recently resulted in the EU–US Privacy Shield arrangement being

Cross-Border Transfers of Data
agreed to facilitate such data transfers.* The full details remain to 
be examined, and the WP29 has sought further details. It will ulti-
mately also need to be assessed whether further legal challenges will 
transpire.
One issue that does arise, however, is the issue of EU citizens being 
able to make challenges in the United States in relation to what is 
happening with their data. One of the concerns addressed before the 
EU Court of Justice was that EU citizens did not have such a mecha-
nism. The new Privacy Shield seeks to address this with a new law in 
the United States expressly permitting EU citizens to take action in 
US courts: the Judicial Redress Act, which has passed the legislative 
approval stage in the United States.
The new arrangement will, according to the EU Commission, 
include the following elements
•	 Strong obligations on companies handling Europeans’  personal 
data and robust enforcement : US companies wishing to import 
personal data from Europe will need to commit to robust 
obligations on how personal data is processed and individual 
rights are guaranteed. The Department of Commerce will 
monitor that companies publish their commitments, which 
makes them enforceable under US law by the US Federal 
Trade Commission (FTC). In addition, any company han-
dling human resources data from Europe has to commit to 
comply with decisions by EU data protection supervisory 
authorities.
•	 Clear safeguards and transparency obligations on US govern-
ment access : For the first time, the United States has given 
the EU written assurances that the access of public authori-
ties for law enforcement and national security will be subject 
to clear limitations, safeguards, and oversight mechanisms. 
These exceptions must be used only to the extent necessary 
and proportionate. The United States has ruled out indis-
criminate mass surveillance on the personal data transferred 
to the United States under the new arrangement. To regularly

monitor the functioning of the arrangement, there will be 
an annual joint review, which will also include the issue of 
national security access. The EU Commission and the US 
Department of Commerce will conduct the review and invite 
national intelligence experts from the US and European data 
protection supervisory authorities to it.
•	 Effective protection of EU citizens’  rights with several redress pos-
sibilities : Any citizen who considers that their data has been 
misused under the new arrangement will have several redress 
possibilities. Companies have deadlines to reply to com-
plaints. European data protection supervisory authorities can 
refer complaints to the Department of Commerce and the 
Federal Trade Commission. In addition, alternative dispute 
resolution will be free of charge. For complaints on possible 
access by national intelligence authorities, a new ombudsper-
son will be created.

judgement:* The full details of the proposed details and for-
mal decision in relation to the new EU–US Privacy Shield

arise.
Conclusion
Data protection compliance practice for organizations means that they 
will have to include a compliance assessment as well as an assessment 
of the risks associated with transfers of personal data outside of the 
EU. This applies to transfers from parent to subsidiary or to a branch 
office in the same way as a transfer to an unrelated company or entity.

Organizations should at least be aware that if they wish to trans-
fer personal data outside of the EU, additional considerations arise, 
and that unless there is a specific exemption process, the transfer may 
not be permitted. Once a transfer possibility arises, the organization 
should undertake a compliance exercise to assess whether the transfer 
can be permitted, and if so, how. Additional compliance documenta-

KEY CONCEPTS 
Organizations in the United States need to be aware that they 
cannot receive EU personal data from third-party organiza-
tions or sister or group organizations. There is a default position 
banning such transfers from the EU to third countries, as such 
recipient countries may not have the same data protection stan-
dards and rules as exist in the EU. The United States is deemed 
not to have such equivalent standards, and as such, there is a 
default transfer ban applicable.
To deal with this transfer ban, organizations must fall within 
a limited number of exemptions.

•	 Default transfer ban on cross-border transfer to countries out-
side of the EU.

Right to Be Informed 
of Third-Country 
Safeguards
Introduction
The right to be informed of third-country safeguards is an important 
new right that individual data subjects will be aware of. Given that 
there is increasing frequency, and sometimes contention, regarding 
cross-border transfers of personal data, individuals will often like to 
be made aware of the existence of such proposed transfers and also 
additional information on the nature of the safeguards that the third 
countries or third-country organizations may have in relation to their 
personal data.
Background Guidance
Background Recital 39 states that any processing of personal data 
should be lawful and fair. It should be transparent to natural persons 
that personal data concerning them are collected, used, consulted, or 
otherwise processed and to what extent the personal data are or will 
be processed. The principle of transparency requires that any informa-
tion and communication relating to the processing of those personal 
data be easily accessible and easy to understand, and that clear and 
plain language be used. That principle concerns, in particular, infor-
mation to the data subjects on the identity of the controller and the 
purposes of the processing and further information to ensure fair and 
transparent processing in respect of the natural persons concerned 
and their right to obtain confirmation and communication of per-
sonal data concerning them that are being processed. Natural persons 
should be made aware of risks, rules, safeguards, and rights in relation 
to the processing of personal data and how to exercise their rights in 

372
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
relation to such processing. In particular, the specific purposes for 
which personal data are processed should be explicit and legitimate 
and determined at the time of the collection of the personal data. The 
personal data should be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is 
necessary for the purposes for which they are processed. This requires, 
in particular, ensuring that the period for which the personal data 
are stored is limited to a strict minimum. Personal data should be 
processed only if the purpose of the processing could not reasonably 
be fulfilled by other means. To ensure that the personal data are not 
kept longer than necessary, time limits should be established by the 
controller for erasure or for a periodic review. Every reasonable step 
should be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate are 
rectified or deleted. Personal data should be processed in a manner 
that ensures appropriate security and confidentiality of the personal 
data, including for preventing unauthorized access to or use of per-
sonal data and the equipment used for the processing.
Background Recital 108 states that in the absence of an adequacy 
decision, the controller or processor should take measures to com-
pensate for the lack of data protection in a third country by way of 
appropriate safeguards for the data subject. Such appropriate safe-
guards may consist of making use of binding corporate rules, standard 
data protection clauses adopted by the Commission, standard data 
protection clauses adopted by a data protection supervisory author-
ity, or contractual clauses authorized by a data protection supervisory 
authority. Those safeguards should ensure compliance with data pro-
tection requirements and the rights of the data subjects appropriate 
to processing within the EU, including the availability of enforceable 
data subject rights and of effective legal remedies, including to obtain 
effective administrative or judicial redress and to claim compensa-
tion, in the EU or in a third country. They should relate in particular 
to compliance with the general principles relating to personal data 
processing, the principles of data protection by design and by default. 
Transfers may also be carried out between public authorities or bod-
ies and public authorities or bodies in third countries or international 
organizations with corresponding duties or functions, including on 
the basis of provisions to be inserted into administrative arrangements, 
such as a memorandum of understanding, providing for enforceable 
and effective rights for data subjects. Authorization by the competent 

373
THIRD-COUNTRY SAFEGUARDS
data protection supervisory authority should be obtained when the 
safeguards are provided for in administrative arrangements that are 
not legally binding.
Background Recital 113 states that transfers that can be quali-
fied as not repetitive and that only concern a limited number of data 
subjects could also be possible for the purposes of the compelling 
legitimate interests pursued by the controller when those interests 
are not overridden by the interests or rights of the data subject and 
when the controller has assessed all the circumstances surrounding 
the data transfer. The controller should give particular consideration 
to the nature of the personal data and the purpose and duration of 
the proposed processing operation or operations, as well as the situ-
ation in the country of origin, the third country, and the country of 
final destination, and should provide suitable safeguards to protect the 
fundamental rights of natural persons with regard to the processing 
of their personal data. Such transfers should be possible only in resid-
ual cases where none of the other grounds for transfer are applicable. 
For scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, 
the legitimate expectations of society for an increase of knowledge 
should be taken into consideration. The controller should inform the 
data protection supervisory authority and the data subject about the 
transfer.
Background Recital 114 states that in any case where the EU 
Commission has taken no decision on the adequate level of data pro-
tection in a third country, the controller or processor should make use 
of solutions that provide data subjects with enforceable and effective 
rights as regards the processing of their data in the EU once those 
data have been transferred so that that they will continue to benefit 
from fundamental rights and safeguards.
Legal Rule
Where personal data are transferred to a third country or to an inter-
national organization, the data subject must have the right to be 
informed of the appropriate safeguards pursuant to Article 46 relat-
ing to the transfer of data (Article 15(2)). This has added relevance 
as part of the potential ripples from the Schrems  EU Court of Justice 
decision.

Schrems  EU Court of Justice decision.
Conclusion
Frequently, organizations may consider the direct issues within orga-
nizations in relation to inward-facing (e.g., employees) and outward-
facing (e.g., customers) data protection issues. There is a danger that a 
narrow focus on these issues can lead to transparency issues as regards 
data subjects, and third parties may fall through the gaps. For exam-
ple, many organizations may have third parties carrying out certain 
data processing activities for them, or in other scenarios, may seek to 
pass on personal data to third parties. When fulfilling transparency 
and information on such activities to third parties, data subjects must 
also be informed of appropriate safeguards being taken.
KEY CONCEPTS 
Organizations need to consider how they inform individuals as 
regards potential third-country destinations and organization 
recipients of their personal data and the associated security pre-
cautions. Consent issues may also arise.
KEY WORDS 
•	 Data transfers.
•	 Cross-border data transfers.
•	 Transfers to third-party organizations.
•	 Safeguards.
•	 Right to be informed of the safeguards.

Transparency
Introduction
One of the routes by which individuals can consent to data collec-
tion, specific uses, and on occasion onward transfers of their personal 
data, and enforce their various rights, is to have transparency from 
the organizational data controller in relation to data collection and 
use. When organizations propose to collect, use, and process personal 
data, they must do so in a transparent manner. In effect, transparency 
is needed as a trigger for individual data subjects to understand that 
there is a proposal to collect and process their personal data, by whom, 
for what purposes, and whether any third parties may also receive 
their personal data. Transparency effectively acts as a trigger for indi-
viduals to be able to enforce their respective data protection rights.
Background Guidance
Background Recital 13 refers to the need to ensure a consistent level 
of protection for natural persons throughout the EU, and to prevent 
divergences hampering the free movement of personal data within the 
internal market, a regulation (not a directive) is necessary to provide 
legal certainty and transparency for economic operators, including 
micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises.
It adds that a regulation is also needed to provide natural persons 
in all member states with the same level of legally enforceable rights 
and obligations and responsibilities for controllers and processors, and 
to ensure consistent monitoring of the processing of personal data and 
equivalent sanctions in all member states as well as effective coop-
eration between the data protection supervisory authorities of dif-
ferent member states. The proper functioning of the internal market 
requires that the free movement of personal data within the EU is not 

376
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
restricted or prohibited for reasons connected with the protection of 
natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data.
To take account of the specific situation of micro, small, and 
medium-sized enterprises, the General Data Protection Regulation 
(GDPR) includes a derogation for organizations with fewer than 250 
employees with regard to record-keeping. In addition, EU institutions 
and bodies, and member states and their data protection supervisory 
authorities, are encouraged to take account of the specific needs of 
micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises in the application of the 
GDPR.*
Background Recital 39 also refers to transparency requirements. 
Any processing of personal data should be lawful and fair. It should be 
transparent to natural persons that personal data concerning them are 
collected, used, consulted, or otherwise processed and to what extent 
the personal data are or will be processed. The principle of transpar-
ency requires that
•	 Any information and communication relating to the pro-
cessing of those personal data be easily accessible and easy to 
understand, and that clear and plain language be used.
•	 The principle concerns, in particular, information to the 
data subjects on the identity of the controller and the pur-
poses of the processing and further information to ensure fair 
and transparent processing in respect of the natural persons 
concerned and their right to obtain confirmation and com-
munication of personal data concerning them that are being 
processed.
•	 Natural persons should be made aware of risks, rules, safe-
guards, and rights in relation to the processing of personal data 
and how to exercise their rights in relation to such processing.
•	 In particular, the specific purposes for which personal data are 
processed should be explicit and legitimate and determined at 
the time of the collection of the personal data.
•	 The personal data should be adequate, relevant, and lim-
ited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are 
processed.
*	 The notion of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises should draw from Article 
2 of the Annex to Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC.

377
TRANSPARENCY
•	 This requires, in particular, ensuring that the period for which 
the personal data are stored is limited to a strict minimum,
•	 Personal data should be processed only if the purpose of 
the processing could not reasonably be fulfilled by other 
means.
•	 To ensure that the personal data are not kept longer than nec-
essary, time limits should be established by the controller for 
erasure or for a periodic review.
•	 Every reasonable step should be taken to ensure that personal 
data that are inaccurate are rectified or deleted. Personal data 
should be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate 
security and confidentiality of the personal data, including 
for preventing unauthorized access to or use of personal data 
and the equipment used for the processing.
Background Recital 58 also refers to transparency. The principle of 
transparency requires that
•	 Any information addressed to the public or to the data subject 
must be concise, easily accessible, and easy to understand.
•	 Clear and plain language and additionally, where appropriate, 
visualization should be used.
•	 Such information could be provided in electronic form; for 
example, when addressed to the public, through a website.
•	 This is of particular relevance in situations where the prolif-
eration of actors and the technological complexity of practice 
make it difficult for the data subject to know and understand 
whether, by whom. and for what purpose personal data relat-
ing to them are being collected, such as in the case of online 
advertising.
•	 Given that children merit specific protection, any information 
and communication, where processing is addressed to a child, 
should be in such clear and plain language that the child can 
easily understand it.
Background Recital 60 refers to transparency as follows. The prin-
ciples of fair and transparent processing require that
•	 The data subject be informed of the existence of the process-
ing operation and its purposes.

378
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
•	 The controller should provide the data subject with any fur-
ther information necessary to ensure fair and transparent pro-
cessing, taking into account the specific circumstances and 
context in which the personal data are processed.
•	 The data subject should be informed of the existence of profil-
ing and the consequences of such profiling.
•	 Where the personal data are collected from the data subject, 
the data subject should also be informed whether they are 
obliged to provide the personal data and of the consequences 
where they do not provide such data.
•	 Information may be provided in combination with stan-
dardized icons to give in an easily visible, intelligible, and 
clearly legible manner a meaningful overview of the intended 
processing.
•	 Where the icons are presented electronically, they should be 
machine-readable.
Background Recital 71 also refers to transparency and that the data 
subject should have the right not to be subject to a decision that may 
include a measure, evaluating personal aspects relating to them, that 
is based solely on automated processing and that produces legal effects 
concerning them or similarly significantly affects them, such as auto-
matic refusal of an online credit application or e-recruiting practices 
without any human intervention. Such processing includes “ profil-
ing”  that consists of any form of automated processing of personal 
data evaluating the personal aspects relating to a natural person, in 
particular to analyze or predict aspects concerning the data subject’ s
•	 Performance at work.
•	 Economic situation.
•	 Health.
•	 Personal preferences or interests.
•	 Reliability or behavior.
•	 Location or movements.
•	 Or where it produces legal effects concerning them or simi-
larly significantly affects them.
However, decision-making based on such processing, includ-
ing profiling, should be allowed where expressly authorized by EU 

379
TRANSPARENCY
or member state law to which the controller is subject, including for 
fraud and tax-evasion monitoring and prevention purposes conducted 
in accordance with the regulations, standards, and recommendations 
of EU institutions or national oversight bodies and to ensure the secu-
rity and reliability of a service provided by the controller, or necessary 
for the entering or performance of a contract between the data sub-
ject and a controller, or when the data subject has given their explicit 
consent.
In any case, such processing should be subject to suitable safe-
guards, which should include specific information to the data subject 
and the right to obtain human intervention, to express their point 
of view, to obtain an explanation of the decision reached after such 
assessment, and to challenge the decision. Such measures should not 
concern a child.
Background Recital 71 also states that to ensure fair and trans-
parent processing in respect of the data subject, taking into account 
the specific circumstances and context in which the personal data are 
processed, the controller should
•	 Use appropriate mathematical or statistical procedures for the 
profiling.
•	 Implement technical and organizational measures appropri-
ate to ensure, in particular, that factors which result in inac-
curacies in personal data are corrected and the risk of errors 
is minimized.
•	 Secure personal data in a manner that takes account of the 
potential risks involved to the interests and rights of the data 
subject and that prevents, inter alia , discriminatory effects on 
natural persons on the basis of
•	 Racial or ethnic origin
•	 Political opinion
•	 Religion or beliefs
•	 Trade union membership
•	 Genetic or health status or sexual orientation
•	 Or that result in measures having such an effect.
Automated decision-making and profiling based on special 
categories of personal data should be allowed only under specific 
conditions.

380
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
Background Recital 78 states that the protection of the rights of 
natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data requires 
that appropriate technical and organizational measures be taken to 
ensure that the requirements of the GDPR are met. To be able to 
demonstrate compliance with the GDPR, the controller should adopt 
internal policies and implement measures that meet in particular the 
principles of data protection by design and data protection by default. 
Such measures could consist, inter alia , of
•	 Minimizing the processing of personal data.
•	 Pseudonymizing personal data as soon as possible.
•	 Transparency with regard to the functions and processing of 
personal data.
•	 Enabling the data subject to monitor the data processing.
•	 Enabling the controller to create and improve security 
features.
When developing, designing, selecting, and using applications, 
services, and products that are based on the processing of personal 
data or process personal data to fulfill their task, producers of the 
products, services, and applications should be encouraged to take into 
account the right to data protection when developing and designing 
such products, services, and applications and, with due regard to the 
state of the art, to make sure that controllers and processors are able to 
fulfill their data protection obligations. The principles of data protec-
tion by design and by default should also be taken into consideration 
in the context of public tenders.
Background Recital 100 states that to enhance transparency and 
compliance with the GDPR, the establishment of certification mech-
anisms and data protection seals and marks should be encouraged, 
allowing data subjects to quickly assess the level of data protection of 
relevant products and services.
Legal Rule 
Article  5 of the earlier original draft proposal for the GDPR provided 
that personal data shall be “ processed lawfully, fairly and in a trans-
parent manner in relation to the data subject.”  Transparency breaches 
“ [require] greater awareness among citizens about the processing

going on: its existence, its content and the flows generated in and out 
by using terminals.” 
Organizations should ensure transparency in relation to security of 
data and risk management.* It is noted that “ the greater the flow of 
information systems the more opaque it becomes in modern informa-
tion systems and with new ICT applications. In that case the right to 
transparency must increase alongside these new processes.” †
Article 5 of the final version of the new GDPR now refers to the 
data protection principles. The first principle now reads
“ processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in rela-
tion to the data subject (‘ lawfulness, fairness and transparency’ ).” 
This is the Transparency Principle.
The GDPR also refers to transparent information, communica-
tion, and modalities for the exercise of the rights of the data subject. 
Chapter  III (rights of the data subject), Section  1 of the GDPR refers 
to transparency and modalities. Article 12 of the GDPR is headed 
“ Transparent information, communication and modalities for exercis-
ing the rights of the data subject.”  Under Article 12(1), the controller 
must take appropriate measures to provide any information referred 
to in Articles 13 and 14 and any communication under Articles 15 
to 22 and 34 relating to processing to the individual data subject in 
a concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible form, using 
clear and plain language, in particular for any information addressed 
specifically to a child. The information must be provided in writing 
or by other means, including, where appropriate, by electronic means. 
When requested by the individual data subject, the information may 
be provided orally, provided that the identity of the individual data 
subject is proven by other means.
The controller must facilitate the exercise of individual data subject 
rights under Articles 15 to 22.‡ In the cases referred to in Article 11(2), 
the controller must not refuse to act on the request of the individual

data subject for exercising their rights under Articles 15 to 22, unless 
the controller demonstrates that it is not in a position to identify the 
individual data subject.
The controller must provide information on action taken on a 
request under Articles 15 to 22 to the individual data subject with-
out undue delay and in any event within 1  month of receipt of the 
request.* That period may be extended by two further months where 
necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the 
requests. The controller must inform the individual data subject of any 
such extension within 1  month of receipt of the request, together with 
the reasons for the delay. Where the individual data subject makes the 
request by means of an electronic form, the information must be pro-
vided by electronic means where possible, unless otherwise requested 
by the individual data subject.
If the controller does not take action on the request of the indi-
vidual data subject, the controller must inform the individual data 
subject without delay and at the latest within 1  month of receipt of the 
request of the reasons for not taking action and on the possibility of 
lodging a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority and 
seeking a judicial remedy.†
Information provided under Articles 13 and 14 and any commu-
nication and any actions taken under Articles 15 to 22 and 34 must 
be provided free of charge.‡ Where requests from an individual data 
subject are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of 
their repetitive character, the controller may either
•	 Charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administra-
tive costs of providing the information or communication or 
taking the action requested; or
•	 Refuse to act on the request.
The controller must bear the burden of demonstrating the mani-
festly unfounded or excessive character of the request.
Without prejudice to Article 11, where the controller has reason-
able doubts concerning the identity of the natural person making the

request referred to in Articles 15 to 21, the controller may request the 
provision of additional information necessary to confirm the identity 
of the individual data subject.*
The information to be provided to individual data subjects pursuant 
to Articles 13 and 14 may be provided in combination with standard-
ized icons to give in an easily visible, intelligible, and clearly legible 
manner a meaningful overview of the intended processing. Where the 
icons are presented electronically, they must be machine-readable.†
Conclusion
Organizations should continue to see what further developments 
arise, such as codes of conduct, security standards, and standardized 
icons for particular data protection matters. Icons may serve to assist 
the transparency and awareness of specific issues to the public and 
to individual data subjects. For example, the EU Commission must 
be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 92 
for the purpose of determining the information to be presented by 
the icons and the procedures for providing standardized icons.‡ Prior 
to the new GDPR, the UK data protection supervisory authority 
(Information commissioner’ s office [ICO]) has issued recommenda-
tions in relation to privacy notices, namely
•	 Getting it right: Collecting information about your customers.
•	 Privacy notices code of practice.
These now need to be read in light of the GDPR changes but may 
be useful to consider. The same applies to particular previous guid-
ance from other data protection supervisory authorities.

Health Data
Introduction
There is an explosion in the use of personal health data and potential 
treatment and lifestyle advances. This type of data counts as addition-
ally confidential and important. It is classed and protected as sensitive 
personal data, which requires additional compliance safeguards.
Health-Related Definitions
Article 4 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) con-
tains a number of definitions relevant to the collection and processing 
of health-related personal data.
Data Concerning Health
“ Data concerning health”  means “ personal data related to the physical 
or mental health of a natural person, including the provision of health 
care services, which reveal information about his or her health status.” 
The background Recitals refer to the increasingly important issue 
of health-related personal data. Personal data concerning health 
should include all data pertaining to the health status of an individual 
data subject that reveal information relating to the past, current, or 
future physical or mental health status of the individual data subject. 
This includes information about the natural person collected in the 
course of the registration for, or the provision of, health-care services 
as referred to in Directive 2011/24 to that natural person; a number, 
symbol, or particular assigned to a natural person to uniquely identify 
the natural person for health purposes; information derived from the 
testing or examination of a body part or bodily substance, including 
from genetic data and biological samples; and any information on, for 
example, a disease, disability, disease risk, medical history, clinical 

386
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
treatment, or the physiological or biomedical state of the individual 
data subject independent of its source; for example, from a physician 
or other health professional, a hospital, a medical device, or an in vitro 
diagnostic test.*
Genetic Data
“ Genetic data”  means “ personal data relating to the inherited or 
acquired genetic characteristics of a natural person which give unique 
information about the physiology or the health of that natural person 
and which result, in particular, from an analysis of a biological sample 
from the natural person in question.” 
Background Recital 34 states that genetic data should be defined as 
personal data relating to the inherited or acquired genetic characteris-
tics of a natural person that result from the analysis of a biological sam-
ple from the natural person in question, in particular chromosomal, 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), or ribonucleic acid (RNA) analysis, or 
from the analysis of another element enabling equivalent information 
to be obtained.†
Biometric Data
“ Biometric data”  means “ personal data resulting from specific techni-
cal processing relating to the physical, physiological or behavioural 
characteristics of a natural person, which allow or confirm the unique 
identification of that natural person, such as facial images or dactylo-
scopic data.” 
Pseudonymization
“ Pseudonymization”  means the “ processing of personal data in such 
a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a spe-
cific data subject without the use of additional information, provided 
that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to 
*	 GDPR Recital 35.
†	 GDPR Recital 34.

387
HEALTH DATA
technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data 
are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person.” 
Profiling
“ Profiling”  means any form of automated processing of personal data 
consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal 
aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyze or pre-
dict aspects concerning that natural person’ s performance at work, 
economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, 
behavior, location, or movements.
Legal Rule: Special Data
Article 9 of the GDPR also refers to health processing as regards 
health data comprising or being encompassed in sensitive data. The 
Article expressly refers to “ [p]rocessing of special categories of per-
sonal data.”  The rule states:
“ Processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political 
opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, 
and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of 
uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data 
concerning a natural person’ s sex life or sexual orientation shall be 
prohibited.” 
There are carveouts, such as express consent.* In the carveouts the 
following clause is contained:
“ processing is necessary for the purposes of preventive or occupational 
medicine, for the assessment of the working capacity of the employee, 
medical diagnosis, the provision of health or social care or treatment 
or the management of health or social care systems and services on the 
basis of EU or member state law or pursuant to contract with a health

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
professional and subject to the conditions and safeguards referred to in 
paragraph 3.” *
Another states:
“ processing is necessary for reasons of public interest in the area of 
public health, such as protecting against serious cross-border threats to 
health or ensuring high standards of quality and safety of health care 
and of medicinal products or medical devices, on the basis of EU or 
member state law which provides for suitable and specific measures to 
safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject, in particular pro-
fessional secrecy.” †
Member states may maintain or introduce further conditions, 
including limitations, with regard to the processing of genetic data, 
biometric data, or data concerning health.‡
Health Research
The issue of health research was just one of the matters that proved 
to be of some controversy during the discussions for the GDPR. The 
final provisions include the following. The sensitive data processing 
prohibition must not apply in the following health research instances
•	 Processing is necessary for the purposes of preventive or occu-
pational medicine, for the assessment of the working capacity 
of the employee, medical diagnosis, the provision of health or 
social care or treatment or the management of health or social 
care systems and services on the basis of EU or member state 
law or pursuant to contract with a health professional and 
subject to the conditions and safeguards referred to in para-
graph 3 (personal data referred to in paragraph 1 may be pro-
cessed for the purposes referred to in point (h) of paragraph 
2 when those data are processed by or under the responsibil-
ity of a professional subject to the obligation of professional

•	 Processing is necessary for reasons of public interest in the 
area of public health, such as protecting against serious cross-
border threats to health or ensuring high standards of quality 
and safety of health care and of medicinal products or medical 
devices, on the basis of EU or member state law that provides 
for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the rights and 
freedoms of the individual data subject, in particular profes-
sional secrecy.
•	 Processing is necessary for …  scientific …  or statistical pur-
poses in accordance with Article 89(1) based on EU or mem-
ber state law, which shall be proportionate to the aim pursued, 
respect the essence of the right to data protection, and provide 
for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamen-
tal rights and the interests of the individual data subject.†
Right to Be Forgotten Exception
The right to erasure (right to be forgotten) does not apply to the extent 
that processing is necessary, inter alia , for reasons of public interest in 
the area of public health in accordance with Article 9(2)(h) and (i) as 
well as Article 9(3).‡ 
There is also a form of exclusion in relation to “ other important 
objectives of general public interest of the EU or of a member state, in 
particular an important economic or financial interest of the EU or of 
a member state, including monetary, budgetary and taxation matters, 
public health and social security.” §

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
Conclusion
Health data and health issues are very important in the context of 
the data protection rules. First, health data are recognized as being 
particularly important and fall within the concept of sensitive per-
sonal data. They are also important because the new GDPR expressly 
includes a number of new concepts and definitions recognizing some 
of the nuances and types of health personal data. Issues of archiving 
and archiving of health or medical data (whether for research or prac-
tice) also need careful consideration by organizations.
KEY CONCEPTS 
The processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin 
and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the pur-
pose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning 
health, or data concerning a natural person’ s sex life or sexual 
orientation shall be prohibited.
Therefore, organizations need to consider how otherwise, if 
at all, they may legitimately propose the processing of health-
related personal data. Given the complexity of the rule, this may 
not always be easy.

ePrivacy
Introduction
There is increasing use of electronically transmitted personal data. 
This is protected and regulated in certain respects separately from the 
general data protection regime under the 1995 data protection direc-
tive (DPD95) (and the General Data Protection Regulation [GDPR]). 
While originally the regulation of telecommunications-related per-
sonal data centered on telecoms companies, it is now recognized as 
encompassing telecoms companies and almost any company engaged 
in activities involving the collection or transmission of particular per-
sonal data over electronic communications networks, including the 
Internet.
Organizations undertaking marketing, email marketing, text mar-
keting, telephone marketing, or fax marketing and using location-
based data, cookies, and identification regarding telephone calls 
need to comply with the rules in relation to ePrivacy and electronic 
communications.
The GDPR indicates that it must not impose additional obligations 
on natural or legal persons in relation to the processing of personal 
data in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic 
communications services in public communication networks in the 
EU in relation to matters for which they are subject to specific obliga-
tions with the same objective as set out in Directive 2002/58.* This 
is because certain issues are referred to or catered for separately than 
in the prior DPD95 and the new GDPR, in the ePrivacy Directive 
(ePD). However, other Directives (apart from ePrivacy) may be 
*	 Article 89. Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 
of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of 
privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic 
communications).

reviewed in terms of amendments required to smoothly comply with 
the GDPR.
Organizations must also note that it is proposed to amend the 
rules in relation to ePrivacy issues, again by way of an EU regula-
tion similar to the GDPR. The contents of the proposal are referred 
to in this chapter, although the timeframe— and any potential 
amendments— are as yet unclear. The draft proposed ePrivacy 
Regulation also arises, as technology and events have changed sig-
nificantly since it was originally enacted.
Background
There has been a separation between the data protection of general 
personal data, in the DPD95, and the regulation of personal data in 
(tele)communications networks. The latter were legislated for in the 
Data Protection Directive of 1997.* This was later replaced with the 
ePD.† The ePD concerns the processing of personal data and the pro-
tection of privacy in the electronic communications sector. It is also 
known as the Directive on privacy and electronic communications, 
hence the ePrivacy Directive. One of the concerns has been how elec-
tronic communications and electronic information are increasingly 
used for profiling for marketing purposes, including by electronic 
means.‡
Costa and Poullet indicate that once the GDPR “ comes into force, 
the document will be the new general legal framework of data protec-
tion, repealing [the DPD95] more than 27  years after its adoption.” § 
The GDPR, as well as Article 8(1) of the EU Charter and Article 
16(1), reasserts the importance of privacy and data protection “ as a 
*	 Directive 97/66/EC.
†	 Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 
2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in 
the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic commu-
nications) (as amended by Directives 2006/24/EC  and  2009/136/EC) (ePD). The 
ePD was also later amended. The ePrivacy Directive was amended by Directives 
2006/24/EC and 2009/136/EC.

fundamental right.” * “ [E]ffective and more coherent protection”  is 
required.†
In terms of policy, as between modernizing via a directive or via 
a regulation, “ in order to ensure a full consistent and high level of 
protection equivalent in all the EU member states, a Regulation 
was judged as the adequate solution to ensure full harmonisation” ‡ 
throughout the EU. The EU Commission may also oversee and moni-
tor the national data protection authorities.§
“ Individuals are rarely aware of how their data are collected and 
processed while they are surfing on the internet at home, using their 
cellphones, walking down a video-surveyed street or with a TFID 
tag embedded in their clothes and so on.” ¶ There is a need for greater 
transparency. As regards data processing, “ transparency translates the 
widening of the knowledge about information systems …  coupled 
with fairness.” **
The GDPR provides that personal data must be “ processed law-
fully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the individual 
data subject (‘ lawfulness, fairness and transparency’ ).” †† Transparency 
“ requires greater awareness among citizens about the processing 
going on: its existence, its content and the flows generated in and out 
by using terminals.” ‡‡ Transparency also relates to security of data and 
risk management.§§
Some commentators have suggested that the GDPR could go fur-
ther. It is suggested that “ the greater the flow of information systems, 
the more opaque it becomes in modern information systems and with 
new ICT applications. In that case the right to transparency must 
increase alongside these new processes.” ¶¶

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
DPD95 and ePD
Article 94 of the GDPR repeals the DPD95. It is repealed with effect 
from May 25, 2018. Under Article 94(2), it provides that references to 
the repealed Directive will be construed as references to the GDPR. 
References to Article 29 Data Protection Working Party (WP29) 
of DPD95 must be construed as references to the European Data 
Protection Board (EDPB) established by the GDPR.
The GDPR also refers to the ePD.* Article 95 refers to the relation-
ship to and amendment of the ePD. It states that the GDPR must not 
impose additional obligations on natural or legal persons in relation 
to processing in connection with the provision of publicly available 
electronic communications services in public communication net-
works in the EU in relation to matters for which they are subject to 
specific obligations with the same objective as set out in the ePrivacy 
Directive.
GDPR Article 96 provides that international agreements involv-
ing the transfer of personal data to third countries or international 
organizations that were concluded by member states prior to May 24, 
2016, and that comply with EU law as applicable prior to that date, 
must remain in force until amended, replaced, or revoked.
Scope of ePD
The ePD† broadly relates to
•	 Security.
•	 Confidentiality.

The ePD harmonizes member states’  rules on the protection of fun-
damental rights, in particular privacy, with respect to the processing 
of personal data in the electronic communications sector. It comple-
ments the DPD95* and applies to the processing of personal data in 
connection with the provision of publicly available electronic com-
munications services in public communications networks in the EU.†
Security
Article 4 of the ePD relates to security. The provider of a publicly 
available electronic communications service must take appropriate 
technical and organizational measures to safeguard the security of its 
services, if necessary in conjunction with the provider of the public 
communications network with respect to network security. Having 
regard to the state of the technology and the cost of their implemen-
tation, these measures must ensure a level of security appropriate to 
the risk presented. In the case of a particular risk of a breach of the

communications service must inform the subscribers concerning such 
risk and, where the risk lies outside the scope of the measures to be 
taken by the service provider, of any possible remedies, including an 
indication of the likely costs involved.*
Confidentiality
Article 5 refers to the confidentiality of the communications. Member 
states must ensure the confidentiality of communications and the 
related traffic data by means of a public communications network 
and publicly available electronic communications services, through 
member state legislation. In particular, they must prohibit listening, 
tapping, storage, or other kinds of interception or surveillance of com-
munications and the related traffic data by persons other than users 
without user consent, unless legally authorized to do so. (There is a 
technical storage exception† and an exception for proving a transac-
tion or business communication.‡ There is also a user right to refuse 
processing of data stored in terminal equipment.§)
*	 ePD Article 4(2).

‡	 The restriction does not affect any legally authorized recording of communications 
and the related traffic data when carried out in the course of lawful business practice

business communication. ePD Article 5(2).
§	 Member states shall ensure that the use of electronic communications networks to 
store information or to gain access to information stored in the terminal equipment 
of a subscriber or user is only allowed on condition that the subscriber or user con-
cerned is provided with clear and comprehensive information in accordance with the 
DPD95, inter alia about the purposes of the processing, and is offered the right to 
refuse such processing by the controller. This shall not prevent any technical storage 
or access for the sole purpose of carrying out or facilitating the transmission of a 
communication over an electronic communications network, or as strictly necessary 
to provide an information society service explicitly requested by the subscriber or 
user. ePD Article 5(3).

Subscriber and user traffic data must be erased or made anonymous 
by communications providers when no longer needed for communica-
tion transmission purposes.* Communications providers may process 
the data to the extent and for the duration necessary for value-added 
services or marketing if the subscriber/user has given consent. Users 
or subscribers must be given the possibility to withdraw their consent 
for the processing of traffic data at any time. The service provider 
must inform the subscriber or user of the types of traffic data that are 
processed and of the duration of such processing and prior to obtain-
ing consent.† There are also restrictions on the types of personnel who 
may process traffic data.‡
Non-Itemized Billing
Subscribers have the right to receive non-itemized bills.§

This is increasingly important as more and more smartphones and 
electronic devices permit the capture of location-based data relating 
to individuals and/or their personal equipment. User or subscriber 
location data may only be processed if made anonymous, or with con-

exceptions relating to the tracing of malicious or nuisance calls and 
emergency calls. There are also rights in relation to stopping auto-

persons and organizations), who have certain rights in relation to 
directories,§ including prior information, consent, and to verify, cor-

Unsolicited Communications, Direct Marketing, and Spam
How should organizations go about data protection compliance direct 
marketing? When is direct marketing permitted? All organizations 
should carefully assess compliance issues when considering any direct 
marketing activities. Getting it wrong can be costly and can have 
enforcement and investigation consequences.
Direct marketing tends to be one of the most contentious areas of 
data protection practice, with the possible exceptions of data breach/
data loss and Internet/social media data protection issues. Most

organizations need to engage in direct marketing at some stage, some 
more heavily than others. Many organizations may even go so far as 
to say that direct marketing is an essential ingredient of continued 
commercial success.
However, direct marketing is sometimes viewed as spam and 
unsolicited commercial communications, which are unwanted and 
also unlawful. The data protection regime (and the eCommerce legal 
regime) refers to permissible direct marketing and sets out various 
obligatory requirements while at the same time setting a default posi-
tion of prohibiting non-exempted or non-permitted electronic direct 
marketing.
The GDPR provides that it must not impose additional obligations 
on natural or legal persons in relation to the processing of personal 
data in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic 
communications services in public communication networks in the 
EU in relation to matters for which they are subject to specific obliga-
tions with the same objective as set out in Directive 2002/58.* There 
may be a review to ensure that the ePD fully complements and does 
not conflict with the GDPR, and if so, amendments may be required.
If the organization anticipates that personal data kept by it will be 
processed for the purposes of direct marketing, it must inform the 
persons to whom the data relate that they may object by means of a 
request in writing to the controller and free of charge.†
Article 13 of the ePD refers to unsolicited communications. The 
use of automated calling systems without human intervention (auto-
matic calling machines), facsimile machines (fax), or electronic mail, 
for the purposes of direct marketing, may only  be allowed in respect of 
subscribers who have given their prior consent . This means that there 
is a default rule prohibiting direct marketing without prior consent.

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
Many marketing-orientated organizations may be surprised, if not 
dismayed, by this.
The Spam Problem
Spam is just one of a number of names taken to describe the problem 
of unsolicited electronic commercial marketing materials. The spam 
name comes originally from a Monty Python comic sketch. However, 
electronic spam is far from comic and costs industry hundreds of mil-
lions of pounds each year in employees’  lost time and resources, in 
lost bandwidth, and in reduced capacity and network speed, as well 
as other problems.
Spam Internationally
The growing recognition of the problems caused by spam has meant 
an increasing number of local and member state laws specifically ded-
icated to preventing spam. In the United States, for example, there are 
a large number of local state laws*  and national federal laws dedicated 
to tackling spam. These include both new specific laws and spam-
specific amendments to pre-existing laws. The US federal spam act, 
known as the CANSPAM Act, has been introduced.†
Unsolicited Communications
Article 13 of the ePD refers to unsolicited communications. Article 
13(1) provides that the use of automated calling systems without 
human intervention (automatic calling machines), facsimile machines 
(fax) or electronic mail for the purposes of direct marketing may only 
be allowed in respect of subscribers who have given their prior consent.
Article 13(2) provides that, notwithstanding Article 13(1), where a 
natural or legal person obtains from its customers their electronic con-
tact details for electronic mail in the context of the sale of a product 
or a service, in accordance with the DPD95, the same natural or legal

person may use these electronic contact details for direct marketing 
of its own similar products or services provided that customers clearly 
and distinctly are given the opportunity to object, free of charge and 
in an easy manner, to such use of electronic contact details when they 
are collected and on the occasion of each message in case the customer 
has not initially refused such use.
Member states must take appropriate measures to ensure that, free 
of charge, unsolicited communications for purposes of direct market-
ing, in cases other than those referred to in Article 13(1) and (2), are 
not allowed either without the consent of the subscribers concerned or 
in respect of subscribers who do not wish to receive these communica-
tions, the choice between these options to be determined by member 
state legislation.*
In any event, the practice of sending electronic mail for purposes 
of direct marketing while disguising or concealing the identity of 
the sender on whose behalf the communication is made, or without 
a valid address to which the recipient may send a request that such 
communications cease, must be prohibited.†
Article 13(5) provides that Article 13(1) and (3) must apply to sub-
scribers who are natural persons. Member states must also ensure, in 
the framework of EU law and applicable member state legislation, 
that the legitimate interests of subscribers other than natural persons 
with regard to unsolicited communications are sufficiently protected.
Marketing Default Position
How should organizations go about data protection– compliant direct 
marketing? When is direct marketing permitted? All organizations 
should carefully assess compliance issues when considering any direct 
marketing activities. Getting it wrong can be costly and can have 
data protection supervisory authority enforcement and investigation 
consequences.

404
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
Article 13 of the ePD provides a number of rules in relation to 
unsolicited communications. Article 13(1) provides that
•	 Automated calling systems without human intervention 
(automatic calling machines).
•	 Facsimile machines (fax) or
•	 Electronic mail.
for the purposes of direct marketing may only  be allowed in respect 
of subscribers who have given their prior consent .
Therefore, there is a default rule prohibiting the forms of direct 
marketing referred to thus far without  prior consent. Many marketing-
orientated organizations may consider this a hindrance to what may 
have been considered legitimate marketing and business activities.
Limited Direct Marketing Permitted
Limited direct marketing is permitted; namely, of subscribers or cus-
tomers who have given their prior consent. This implies consent in 
advance or simultaneously with the direct marketing. However, in 
terms of direct marketing by email, this is further restricted.
Direct Marketing to Existing Customers’  Email
In the context of existing customers, there is a possibility of direct 
marketing using emails. Article 13(2) of the ePD provides that where 
an organization obtains from its customers their electronic contact 
details for electronic mail, in the context of the sale of a product or 
a service, in accordance with the DPD95, the organization may use 
these electronic contact details for direct marketing of its own similar 
products or services, provided that customers clearly and distinctly are 
given the opportunity to object, free of charge and in an easy manner, 
to such use of electronic contact details when they are collected and 
on the occasion of each message in case the customer has not initially 
refused such use.
Therefore, once the email details are obtained at the time of a 
product or service transaction, it will be possible to use that email 
for direct marketing purposes. Conditions or limitations apply, how-
ever. First, the organization is only permitted to market and promote 

405
ePRIVACY
similar products or services. This, therefore, rules out unrelated, non-
identical, and non-similar products and services. Second, at the time 
of each subsequent act of direct marketing, the customer must be 
given the opportunity in an easy and accessible manner to opt out or 
cancel the direct marketing. Effectively, they must be taken off the 
organization’ s direct marketing list.
National Marketing Opt-Out Registers
Article 13(3) of the ePD provides that member states must take appro-
priate measures to ensure that, free of charge, unsolicited communi-
cations for purposes of direct marketing, in cases other than those 
referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, are not allowed either without the 
consent of the subscribers concerned or in respect of subscribers who 
do not wish to receive these communications, the choice between these 
options to be determined by member state legislation. This means that 
each member state must determine and provide a means for individu-
als to opt out of receiving direct marketing in advance.
Deceptive Emails: Marketing Emails Must Not Conceal Identity
Article 13(4) of the ePD provides that the practice of sending elec-
tronic mail for purposes of direct marketing while disguising or con-
cealing the identity of the sender on whose behalf the communication 
is made must be prohibited. This means that organizations cannot 
conceal their identity if permitted to engage in direct marketing. If 
this is not complied with, what might otherwise be permissible direct 
marketing can be deemed to be impermissible. Complaints, investiga-
tions, or enforcement proceedings can thus arise.
Marketing Emails Must Provide Opt-Out
In addition, Article 13(4) of the ePD provides that the practice of 
sending electronic mail for purposes of direct marketing without a 
valid address to which the recipient may send a request that such com-
munications cease must be prohibited. This means that organizations 
must also include an easy contact address or other details at which 
the recipient can contact them if they wish to object to receiving any 

406
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
further direct marketing. If this is not complied with, what might 
otherwise be permissible direct marketing can be deemed to be 
impermissible. Complaints, investigations, or enforcement proceed-
ings can thus also arise.
Marketing Protection for Organizations
Article 13(5) of the ePD provides that Article 13(1) and (3) must 
apply to subscribers who are natural persons. Member states must also 
ensure, in the framework of Community law and applicable member 
state legislation, that the legitimate interests of subscribers other than 
natural persons with regard to unsolicited communications are suf-
ficiently protected. This means that protection from unsolicited direct 
marketing can also be extended to organizations.
ePrivacy Regulation Proposal

with a new ePrivacy Regulation. The current proposal refers to

Conclusion
Few organizations will not be interested in direct marketing and 
advertising. The key is to get it right. The consequences of sending 
unlawful electronic communications can include offenses, prosecu-
tions, official enforcement, and investigations as well as being sued. 
This is one of the areas that are consistently areas of focus for data 
protection supervisory authority investigation.
These issues become more important as (a) increased competi-
tion puts pressure on organizations to engage, or increase, marketing 
and profiling efforts and (b) the software, devices, and technologies 
available to facilitate such efforts are increasing in significance. Over 
time, cost efforts also decrease in terms of adopting these new tools. 
As always, however, organizations are cautioned to ensure data pro-
tection compliance. They might also on occasion pause to question 
general ethical considerations in certain instances. Depending on the 
sector, certain third-party organizational rules may also be obligatory 
to consider and comply with, particularly as regards direct marketing 
issues. Indeed, the new GDPR also provides the impetus for repre-
sentative organizations to increasingly consider industry-wide data 

408
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
protection Codes of Conduct. These are encouraged by data protec-
tion supervisory authorities and the new GDPR.
Originally envisaged as relating to telecoms-type data only, this 
secondary aspect of the data protection regime has expanded in sub-
stance, scope, and detail. While much of it is still specific to telecoms 
companies and entities involved in the transfer of electronic commu-
nications, certain issues are more generally applicable. The ePD as 
amended applies to all organizations that wish to engage in direct 
marketing through a variety of means. Compliance is necessary and 
needs to be planned in advance. If not specifically exempted from the 
default rule, it is difficult to envisage permissible direct marketing.
One example is the increasingly controversial area of profiling, 
advertising, and direct marketing in relation to children.*
Online behavioral advertising (OBA) and the behavioral targeting 
of Internet advertising are increasingly debated.†
Commentators and media often focus on the issue of threats to 
privacy, data protection, and reputation rights caused by Web 2.0 
activities such as social media, search engine services, and so on. The 
query arises as to whether revenue versus privacy is better respected by 
certain online services providers than others.‡
KEY CONCEPTS 
ePrivacy issues are one of the most frequent interfaces of compli-
ance considerations by organizations, particularly the sales and 
marketing units. It is important to get data protection compli-
ance right, whether in terms of collecting personal data, storing 
it, or using it for marketing, and so on.

Introduction
Increasingly, data protection breaches and other non-compliance will 
result in civil remedies and monetary awards and compensation to 
individual data subjects. If a request for information or other notice 
is received from the data protection supervisory authority, it may be 
appropriate to seek immediate legal advice. The data protection super-
visory authority can also issue enforcement notices. In addition, the 
data protection supervisory authority may pursue monetary penalties. 
Organizations should ensure proper policies, awareness of data pro-
tection issues, and ongoing training across all personnel who have 
an impact on and responsibility regarding data protection operations. 
Organizations need to apprise themselves of the new data protection 
regime, not only in terms of the regime obligations being enhanced 
and extended but also in terms of ensuring adequate compliance pro-
cedures to avoid costly investigations, fines, penalties, and damages 
and compensation, as well as other consequences of non-compliance 
and breach.
Data protection is important. Personal data are considered impor-
tant and sensitive to customers. This should be respected by organiza-
tions. Organizations are not permitted to collect or process customers’  
personal data without being data protection compliance. It is in this 
context that there can be severe consequences for an organization for 
non-compliance, whether in collecting personal data initially or in 
the subsequent processing of the personal data. The data protection 
supervisory authority can prosecute for non-compliance. Alternatively, 
enforcement notices can be imposed that specify certain actions that 
must be implemented by the organization. Certain types of organi-
zations can be the recipients of a separate type of notices, namely, 
assessment notices. In any of these events, customers will be par-
ticularly concerned that their personal data have been collected, are 

414
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
being processed in a certain manner, and/or may have been subject to 
a breach event. This can have its own consequences. Overall, it should 
also be noted that the consequences of breach or non-compliance are 
becoming increasingly important as enforcement actions and penal-
ties are increasing in number and financial scale. The new General 
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regime also further changes the 
enforcement rules.
Civil Sanctions
Certain types of data will convey inherent additional risks over oth-
ers, such as loss of financial personal data. It can be argued that this 
requires higher obligations for the organization. Indeed, the new 
GDPR expressly refers to the sensitivity of certain types of personal 
data as well as the enhanced importance of security, risk assessment, 
risk minimization, consultations, and data protection by design and 
by default.
One interesting area to consider is online abuse and damage, such 
as viral publication, defamation, bulletin boards, discussion forums 
and websites (or sections of websites), and social media and related 
websites. Where damage occurs as a result of the, misuse, or loss 
of personal data or results in abuse, threats, defamation, or liability 
could, depending on the circumstances, arise for the individual tort-
feasors as well as the website.
Another interesting area to consider is that of data breaches and 
the changing landscape in terms of responsibility and liability. 
Obviously, there can be a number of sources for data breaches, and 
the scale, complexity, length, effect, and cost can vary greatly. The 
new GDPR is significant (in imposing rights, obligations, security 
compliance, risk assessment and minimization, data protection by 
design and data protection by default, etc.), but it is by no means 
the only development for organizations to be aware of. Separately 
from the GDPR, there is a new Security Directive being finalized. 
The security landscape (in law, practice, and technology) is constantly 
changing internationally. Organizations cannot ignore these devel-
opments. Organizations are being sued, prosecuted, and fined inter-
nationally; executives are being prosecuted and have lost their jobs or 
at least have black marks on their file; services have to be stopped at 

415
COURTS
significant disruption and cost; significant numbers of customers or 
users can be lost forever; the IT fix or replacement costs can run into 
millions; the brand and reputation damage can take years to recover. 
Just recently, the VTech (the children’ s electronic toy manufacturer) 
data breach demonstrates that the fallout can extend also to an orga-
nization reacting in an overly legalistic manner. The company drew 
adverse attention when it changed its terms and conditions after the 
breach to purport that it was not liable to customers and users when 
their data was hacked. The UK data protection supervisory authority 
(Information Commissioner’ s Office [ICO]) was just one avenue of 
the criticism that VTech received. Obviously, and as the ICO also 
confirms, the company is responsible for security and compliance in 
relation to customer and user personal data.
While there are certain limited defenses in the eCommerce 
Directive,*  one should recall that the data protection regime (and 
its duty of care and liability provisions) is separate and stands alone 
from the eCommerce Directive legal regime. Indeed, even in terms 
of the eCommerce defenses, one should also recall that (a) an orga-
nization must first fall within an eCommerce defense, and not lose 
that defense, so as to avail itself of it and (b) there is no automatic 
entitlement to an Internet service provider (ISP) or website to a global 
eCommerce defense. In fact, there is not one eCommerce defense but 
three very specific defenses relating to specific and technical activities. 
Not every ISP activity will fall into one of these defenses. Nor will 
one activity fall into all three defenses. The GDPR refers to the “ the 
liability rules of intermediary service providers in Articles 12– 15 of”  
the eCommerce Directive, as opposed to liability defenses.†
It is also possible to conceive of a website that has no take-down 
procedures, inadequate take-down procedures (assuming there are 
such procedures), or non-expeditious procedures and will face poten-
tial liability under privacy and data protection as well as eCommerce 
liability. For example, an imposter social media profile that contains 
personal data and defamatory material could attract liability for the 
*	 Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 
2000 on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular electronic 
commerce, in the Internal Market (Directive on electronic commerce). At http://

website operator under data protection and under normal liability if 
none of the eCommerce defenses were unavailable or were lost. The 
latter could occur if, for example, the false impersonating profile was 
notified to the website (or it was otherwise aware) but it did not do 
anything.* Damages can be and have been awarded.†
Background Guidance
There are various court remedies, duty of care, and so on in relation 
to individual data subjects for organizations to be aware of, and which 
can also result in court actions. These can arise as a result of data pro-
tection supervisory authorities or from individuals.
Background Recital 22 of the GDPR states that any processing of 
personal data in the context of the activities of an establishment of 
a controller or a processor in the EU should be carried out in accor-
dance with the GDPR, regardless of whether the processing itself 
takes place within the EU.‡ Therefore, the rules apply even if the pro-
cessing is outsourced in-group or out-of-group.
Background Recital 23 of the GDPR states that to ensure that 
natural persons are not deprived of the protection to which they are 
entitled under the GDPR, the processing of personal data of indi-
vidual data subjects who are in the EU by a controller or a processor 
not established in the EU should be subject to the GDPR where the 
processing activities are related to offering goods or services to such 
individual data subjects, irrespective of whether they are connected

to a payment. To determine whether such a controller or processor is 
offering goods or services to individual data subjects who are in the 
EU, it should be ascertained whether it is apparent that the controller 
or processor envisages offering services to individual data subjects in 
one or more member states in the EU.* Factors such as the use of a 
language or a currency generally used in one or more member states 
with the possibility of ordering goods and services in that other lan-
guage, or the mentioning of customers or users who are in the EU, 
may make it apparent that the controller envisages offering goods or 
services to individual data subjects in the EU.
Background Recital 24 of the GDPR states that the processing of 
personal data of individual data subjects who are in the EU by a con-
troller or processor not established in the EU should also be subject to 
the GDPR when it is related to the monitoring of the behavior of such 
individual data subjects insofar as their behavior takes place within 
the EU. To determine whether a processing activity can be considered 
to monitor the behavior of individual data subjects, it should be ascer-
tained whether natural persons are tracked on the Internet, including 
the potential subsequent use of personal data processing techniques 
that consist of profiling a natural person, particularly to take decisions 
concerning them or for analyzing or predicting their personal prefer-
ences, behaviors, and attitudes.
Individuals are also entitled in enforcing their data protection 
rights, and in seeking remedies in relation to damage and loss suffered 
as a result of the misuse of their personal data, to seek court rem-
edies. They are not confined to simply making complaints to the data 
protection supervisory authority. It is important to note that certain 
remedies that an individual may wish to seek are not available from or 
via the data protection supervisory authority.
This recognition of judicial, as well as official, routes to remedies 
is also contained in the recent GDPR Recitals. Every data subject 
should have the right to lodge a complaint with a single data protec-
tion supervisory authority, in particular in the member state of their

Where an individual data subject considers that their rights under the 
GDPR are infringed, they should have the right to mandate a body, 
organization, or association that is of non-profit-making character.† 
For proceedings against a controller or processor, the plaintiff should 
have the choice to bring the action before the courts of the member 
states where the controller or processor has an establishment or where 
the individual data subject resides, unless the controller is a public 
authority of a member state acting in the exercise of its public powers.‡
Any damage that a person may suffer as a result of processing that 
is not in compliance with the GDPR should be compensated by the 
controller or processor, which should be exempted from liability if 
they prove that they are not in any way responsible for the damage. 
The concept of damage should be broadly interpreted in the light 
of the case law of the EU Court of Justice in a manner that fully 
reflects the objectives of the GDPR. Individual data subjects should 
receive full and effective compensation for the damage they have 
suffered.§ Controllers and processors owe a duty of care to individual 
data subjects. ¶
The background Recitals refer to proceedings against controllers, 
processors, and jurisdiction (Recital 145); damages and compensation 
(Recital 146); the prevention, investigation, detection, or prosecution

protection supervisory authority, prior to referral to the judicial authority, member 
states must provide for the right of every person to a judicial remedy for any breach of 
the rights guaranteed them by the member state law applicable to the processing in 
question. Article 23 of the DPD95 refers to liability and provides that member states 
must provide that any person who has suffered damage as a result of an unlawful 
processing operation or of any act incompatible with the national provisions adopted 
pursuant to the Directive is entitled to receive compensation from the controller for 
the damage suffered.

419
COURTS
The controller or processor should compensate any damage that a 
person may suffer as a result of processing that infringes the GDPR. 
The controller or processor should be exempt from liability if it proves 
that it is not in any way responsible for the damage. The concept of 
damage should be broadly interpreted in the light of the case law of 
the EU Court of Justice in a manner that fully reflects the objectives 
of the GDPR. This is without prejudice to any claims for damage 
deriving from the violation of other rules in EU or member state law. 
Processing that infringes the GDPR also includes processing that 
infringes delegated and implementing acts adopted in accordance 
with the GDPR and member state law specifying rules of the GDPR. 
Individual data subjects should receive full and effective compensa-
tion for the damage they have suffered. Where controllers or proces-
sors are involved in the same processing, each controller or processor 
should be held liable for the entire damage. However, where they are 
joined to the same judicial proceedings, in accordance with member 
state law, compensation may be apportioned according to the respon-
sibility of each controller or processor for the damage caused by the 
processing, provided that full and effective compensation of the indi-
vidual data subject who suffered the damage is ensured. Any con-
troller or processor that has paid full compensation may subsequently 
institute recourse proceedings against other controllers or processors 
involved in the same processing.*
New GDPR Remedies, Legal Rules, Damage, and Compensation
The DPD95 refers to these various issues, such as courts,† damages 
and compensation,‡ and sanctions.§ The new GDPR changes and 
expands on these matters. Chapter  VIII of the GDPR refers to rem-
edies, liability, and penalties regarding data protection. Article 77 
refers to the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervi-
sory authority. Without prejudice to any other administrative or judi-
cial remedy, every individual data subject must have the right to lodge

in the member state of their habitual residence, place of work or place 
of the alleged infringement if the individual data subject considers 
that the processing of personal data relating to them infringes the 
GDPR.* In addition, the data protection supervisory authority with 
which the complaint has been lodged must inform the complainant 
on the progress and the outcome of the complaint, including the pos-
sibility of a judicial remedy pursuant to Article 78.†
Right to Effective Judicial Remedy against Controller or Processor
Article 79 refers to the right to an effective judicial remedy against a 
controller or processor. Without prejudice to any available administra-
tive or non-judicial remedy, including the right to lodge a complaint 
with a data protection supervisory authority pursuant to Article 77, 
each individual data subject must have the right to an effective judicial 
remedy where he or she considers that their rights under the GDPR 
have been infringed as a result of the processing of their personal data 
in non-compliance with the GDPR.‡
Proceedings against a controller or a processor must be brought 
before the courts of the member state where the controller or pro-
cessor has an establishment. Alternatively, such proceedings may be 
brought before the courts of the member state where the individual 
data subject has their habitual residence, unless the controller or pro-
cessor is a public authority of a member state acting in the exercise of 
its public powers.§
Right to Compensation and Liability
The GDPR introduces important new provisions. Article 82 of the 
GDPR refers to the right to compensation and liability. Any person 
who has suffered material or non-material damage as a result of an

COURTS
infringement of the GDPR must have the right to receive compensa-
tion from the controller or processor for the damage suffered.*
Any controller  involved in processing must be liable for the dam-
age caused by processing that infringes  the GDPR. A processor  must 
be liable for the damage caused by processing only where it has not 
complied  with obligations of the GDPR specifically directed to pro-
cessors or where it has acted outside or contrary  to lawful instructions of 
the controller .†
A controller or processor must be exempt from liability under 
paragraph 2 if it proves that it is not in any way responsible for the 
event giving rise to the damage.‡ It is noted that the reference to 
“ any”  ensures that there is apparently a high onus on organizations 
to satisfy this criterion. It may point to certain factors indicating non-
liability, but if there is one other factor pointing to liability, or where 
certain actions were not taken or risks known, this could mean that 
the exemption cannot or does not apply.
There is also a form of potential set off or indemnity between vari-
ous parties that may be potentially liable. Where more than one con-
troller or processor, or both a controller and a processor, are involved 
in the same processing, and where they are, under paragraphs 2 and 
3, responsible for any  damage caused by processing, each controller 
or processor must be held liable for the entire damage so as to ensure 
effective compensation  of the data subject.§ It is also noted that this 
refers to “ effective compensation”  as opposed to the potentially nar-
rower phrase “ compensation”  or mere “ compensation.” 
Where a controller or processor has, in accordance with paragraph 
4, paid full compensation for the damage suffered, that controller or 
processor must be entitled to claim back from the other controllers or 
processors involved in the same processing that part of the compensa-
tion corresponding to their part of responsibility for the damage, in 
accordance with the conditions set out in paragraph 2.¶

Right to Lodge Complaint with Data Protection Supervisory Authority
Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, 
every data subject must have the right to lodge a complaint with a 
data protection supervisory authority, in particular in the member 
state of their habitual residence, place of work, or place of the alleged 
infringement if the data subject considers that the processing of per-
sonal data relating to them infringes the GDPR.†
The data protection supervisory authority with which the com-
plaint has been lodged must inform the complainant on the progress 
and the outcome of the complaint, including the possibility of a judi-
cial remedy pursuant to Article 78.‡
Right to an Effective Judicial Remedy against a 
Data Protection Supervisory Authority
Article 78 of the new GDPR refers to the right to an effective judicial 
remedy against a data protection supervisory authority. Article 78(1) 
provides that without prejudice to any other administrative or non-
judicial remedy, each natural or legal person must have the right to an 
effective judicial remedy against a legally binding decision of a data 
protection supervisory authority concerning them.
Without prejudice to any other administrative or non-judicial rem-
edy, each individual data subject must have the right to a an effective 
judicial remedy where the data protection supervisory authority that is 
competent pursuant to Articles 55 and 56 does not handle a complaint 
or does not inform the individual data subject within 3  months on the 
progress or outcome of the complaint lodged pursuant to Article 77.§

tection supervisory authority that was preceded by an opinion or a 
decision of the European Data Protection Board in the consistency 
mechanism, the data protection supervisory authority must forward 
that opinion or decision to the court.†
Representation of Data Subjects
The data subject must have the right to mandate a not-for-profit body, 
organization, or association that has been properly constituted in 
accordance with the law of a member state, has statutory objectives 
that are in the public interest, and is active in the field of the protec-
tion of data subjects’  rights with regard to the protection of their per-
sonal data to lodge the complaint on their behalf, to exercise the rights 
referred to in Articles 77, 78, and 79 on their behalf, and to exercise 
the right to receive compensation referred to in Article 82 on their 
behalf where provided for by member state law.‡
Member states may provide that any such body, organization, or 
association, independently of a data subject’ s mandate, has the right 
to lodge, in that member state, a complaint with the data protection 
supervisory authority that is competent pursuant to Article 77 and to 
exercise the rights referred to in Articles 78 and 79 if it considers that 
the rights of a data subject under the GDPR have been infringed as a

Background Guidance on Representative Data Subject Organizations
Background Recital 142 of the GDPR states that where an individual 
data subject considers that their rights under the GDPR are infringed, 
he or she should have the right to mandate a not-for-profit body, orga-
nization, or association that is constituted in accordance with the law 
of a member state, has statutory objectives that are in the public inter-
est, and is active in the field of the protection of personal data to lodge 
a complaint on their behalf with a data protection supervisory author-
ity, exercise the right to a judicial remedy on behalf of individual data 
subjects, or, if provided for in member state law, exercise the right to 
receive compensation on behalf of individual data subjects. A member 
state may provide for such a body, organization, or association to have 
the right to lodge a complaint in that member state, independently 
of an individual data subject’ s mandate, and the right to an effective 
judicial remedy where it has reasons to consider that the rights of an 
individual data subject have been infringed as a result of the process-
ing of personal data that infringes the GDPR. That body, organiza-
tion, or association may not be allowed to claim compensation on 
a data subject’ s behalf independently of the data subject’ s mandate. 
There are an increasing number of data protection and privacy groups, 
both nationally and supra-nationally. Indeed, the EU Court of Justice

member states where the controller or processor has an establishment 
or where the individual data subject resides, unless the controller is a 
public authority of a member state acting in the exercise of its public 
powers.†
Jurisdiction Issues
The issues of jurisdiction are often complex. However, the GDPR 
provides some background and guidance.
Controller or Processor in EU
Background Recital 22 of the new GDPR states that any processing 
of personal data in the context of the activities of an establishment of 
a controller or a processor in the EU should be carried out in accor-
dance with the GDPR, regardless of whether or not the processing 
itself takes place within the EU. Establishment implies the effective 
and real exercise of activity through stable arrangements. The legal 
form of such arrangements, whether through a branch or a subsidiary 
with a legal personality, is not the determining factor in this respect.
Controller or Processor Not in EU
Background Recital 23 of the new GDPR states that in order to 
ensure that individuals are not deprived of the protection to which 
they are entitled under the GDPR, the processing of personal data of 
individual data subjects who are in the EU by a controller or a proces-
sor not established in the EU should be subject to the GDPR where 
the processing activities are related to the offering of goods or services

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
to such individual data subjects, irrespective of whether they are con-
nected to a payment or not. To determine whether such a controller or 
processor is offering goods or services to individual data subjects who 
are in the EU, it should be ascertained whether it is apparent that the 
controller envisages offering services to individual data subjects in one 
or more member states in the EU. While the mere accessibility of the 
controller’ s, processor’ s, or an intermediary’ s website in the EU, of 
an email address, or of other contact details, or the use of a language 
generally used in the third country where the controller is established, 
is insufficient to ascertain such intention, factors such as the use of a 
language or a currency generally used in one or more member states 
with the possibility of ordering goods and services in that other lan-
guage, or the mentioning of customers or users who are in the EU, 
may make it apparent that the controller envisages offering goods or 
services to such individual data subjects in the EU.
Monitoring
The processing of personal data of individual data subjects who are in 
the EU by a controller or processor not established in the EU should 
also be subject to the GDPR when it is related to the monitoring of 
the behavior of such individual data subjects insofar as their behav-
ior takes place within the EU. To determine whether a processing 
activity can be considered to monitor the behavior of individual data 
subjects, it should be ascertained whether natural persons are tracked 
on the Internet, including the potential subsequent use of personal 
data processing techniques that consist of profiling a natural person, 
particularly to take decisions concerning them or for analyzing or pre-
dicting their personal preferences, behaviors, and attitudes.*
Jurisdiction, Main Establishment, Groups
The main establishment of a controller in the EU should be the place 
of its central administration in the EU, unless the decisions on the 
purposes and means of the processing of personal data are taken in 
another establishment of the controller in the EU, in which case that 
*	 GDPR Recital 24.

427
COURTS
other establishment should be considered to be the main establish-
ment. The main establishment of a controller in the EU should be 
determined according to objective criteria and should imply the effec-
tive and real exercise of management activities determining the main 
decisions as to the purposes and means of processing through stable 
arrangements. That criterion should not depend on whether the pro-
cessing of personal data is carried out at that location. The presence 
and use of technical means and technologies for processing personal 
data or processing activities do not, in themselves, constitute a main 
establishment and are therefore not determining criteria for a main 
establishment.*
The main establishment of the processor should be the place of its 
central administration in the EU or, if it has no central administra-
tion in the EU, the place where the main processing activities take 
place in the EU. In cases involving both the controller and the proces-
sor, the competent lead data protection supervisory authority should 
remain the data protection supervisory authority of the member state 
where the controller has its main establishment, but the data protec-
tion supervisory authority of the processor should be considered to 
be a data protection supervisory authority concerned, and that data 
protection supervisory authority should participate in the cooperation 
procedure provided for by the GDPR. In any case, the data protection 
supervisory authorities of the member state or member states where 
the processor has one or more establishments should not be consid-
ered to be data protection supervisory authorities concerned where the 
draft decision concerns only the controller. Where the processing is 
carried out by a group of undertakings, the main establishment of the 
controlling undertaking should be considered to be the main estab-
lishment of the group of undertakings, except where the purposes and 
means of processing are determined by another undertaking.†
A group of undertakings should cover a controlling undertaking 
and its controlled undertakings, whereby the controlling undertaking 
should be the undertaking that can exert a dominant influence over 
the other undertakings by virtue, for example, of ownership, finan-
cial participation, or the rules that govern it or the power to have

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
personal data protection rules implemented. An undertaking that 
controls the processing of personal data in undertakings affiliated to 
it should be regarded, together with those undertakings, as a group of 
undertakings.*
Investigation and Evidence
The issue of electronic evidence is also critical, whether for the orga-
nization or the individual data subject wishing to use such evidence. 
It is recommended that organizations consider these issues proactively 
in advance rather than hoping to be able to deal with them adequately 
in a reactive manner.
Conclusion
Organizations must not only contemplate the various issues and 
requirements from a compliance perspective, but must also contem-
plate what happens when things may go wrong or a contentious issue 
arises. In some of these instances, there is potential for court actions 
to arise. These potential scenarios must also be prepared for.

Organizations need to carefully consider compliance as well as 
contentious scenarios. There is an increase in the potential for 
data protection issues to end up in courts.

Some Specific 
Issues in GDPR
Introduction
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) sets out various 
generally applicable rules that are applicable across all personal data 
(whether general personal data or sensitive personal data). In addition, 
the GDPR refers to a number of specific issues and how data protec-
tion will apply in those instances.
Specific Data Processing Situations
Chapter  IX of the GDPR refers to provisions regarding specific data 
processing situations. The specified issues are
•	 Processing in the context of employment.*
•	 Processing of the national identification number.†
•	 Processing and public access to official documents.‡
•	 Processing and freedom of expression and information.§
•	 Safeguards and derogations relating to processing for 
archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or histori-
cal research purposes, or statistical purposes.¶
•	 Obligations of secrecy.**
•	 Existing data protection rules of churches and religious 
associations.††

430
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
Some of these issues that are potentially more pertinent to organi-
zations are referred to in the following sections.
Employment Data
Employees, employment issues, and employee rights are all important 
to organizations, both large and small, and across all sectors of activ-
ity. Employment-related issues related to employee personal data are 
continuing to grow. The new GDPR provides that employee protec-
tions can become much more specific.* The GDPR refers to provi-
sions relating to specific data processing situations. Article 88 refers 
to processing in the employment context. Article 88(1) provides that 
member states may, by law or by collective agreements, provide more 
specific rules to ensure the protection of the rights in respect of the 
processing of employees’  personal data in the employment context, 
in particular for the purposes of recruitment: the performance of the 
contract of employment, including the discharge of obligations laid 
down by law or by collective agreements; the management, planning, 
and organization of work; equality and diversity in the workplace; 
health and safety at work; the protection of employer’ s or custom-
ers’  property; and for the purposes of the exercise and enjoyment, 
on an individual or collective basis, of rights and benefits related to 
employment; and for the purpose of the termination of the employ-
ment relationship.
Article 82(2) states that those rules must include suitable and 
specific measures to safeguard the individual data subject’ s human 
dignity, legitimate interests, and fundamental rights, with particular 
regard to the transparency of processing, the transfer of personal data 
within a group of undertakings, or a group of enterprises engaged in 
a joint economic activity and monitoring systems at the workplace.
*	 GDPR Article 88. Prior to the new GDPR, the UK data protection supervisory 
authority (Information Commissioner’ s Office [ICO]) had issued recommen-
dations in relation to personal data employment issues, namely, Employment 
practices code; Employment practices code— a quick guide; Employment prac-
tices code— supplementary guidance; Disclosure of employee information under 
TUPE; Getting it right: a brief guide to data protection for small businesses; and 
Monitoring under Section  75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998. These now need 
to be read in light of the GDPR changes.

431
Some Specific Issues in GDPR
Processing National Identification Numbers
Member states may further determine the specific conditions for the 
processing of a national identification number or any other identifier 
of general application. In that case, the national identification number 
or any other identifier of general application must be used only under 
appropriate safeguards for the rights of the data subject pursuant to 
the GDPR.*
Public Authorities
There is particular reference to public authorities to whom data are 
disclosed, requests, limits, and compliance.†
Processing and Freedom of Expression and Information
Chapter  IX of the GDPR also makes provisions relating to specific 
data processing situations. Article 85 refers to the processing of per-
sonal data and freedom of expression and information.
Member states must by law reconcile the right to the protection 
of personal data pursuant to the GDPR with the right to freedom of 
expression and information, including processing for journalistic pur-
poses and the purposes of academic, artistic, or literary expression.‡
For processing carried out for journalistic purposes or the purpose 
of academic artistic or literary expression, member states must provide 
for exemptions or derogations from GDPR Chapter  II (principles), 
Chapter  III (rights of the data subject), Chapter  IV (controller and 
processor), Chapter  V (transfer of personal data to third countries or 
international organizations), Chapter  VI (independent data protec-
tion supervisory authorities), Chapter  VII (cooperation and consis-
tency), and Chapter  IX (specific data processing situations) if they are

necessary to reconcile the right to the protection of personal data with

Safeguards and Derogations: Public Interest Archiving/
Scientific or Historical Research/Statistical Processing
There are also provisions in relation to safeguards and derogations 
relating to processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, 
scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes.
Background Guidance
The background guidance indicates that the processing of personal 
data for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or his-
torical research purposes, or statistical purposes should be subject to 
appropriate safeguards for the rights of the individual data subject 
pursuant to the GDPR. Those safeguards should ensure that tech-
nical and organizational measures are in place to ensure, in partic-
ular, the principle of data minimization. The further processing of 
personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific 
or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes is to be car-
ried out when the controller has assessed the feasibility of fulfilling 
those purposes by processing data that do not permit or no longer 
permit the identification of individual data subjects, provided that 
appropriate safeguards exist (such as, e.g., pseudonymization of the 
data). Member states should provide for appropriate safeguards for 
the processing of personal data for archiving purposes in the public 
interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical pur-
poses. Member states should be authorized to provide, under specific 
conditions and subject to appropriate safeguards for individual data 
subjects, specifications and derogations with regard to the informa-
tion requirements and rights to rectification, to erasure, to be forgot-
ten, to restriction of processing, to data portability, and to object when 
processing personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest, 
*	 GDPR Article 85(2). Each member state must notify to the EU Commission the 
provisions of its law that it has adopted and, without delay, any subsequent amend-
ment law or amendment affecting them. GDPR Article 85(3).

Some Specific Issues in GDPR
scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes. The 
conditions and safeguards in question may entail specific procedures 
for individual data subjects to exercise those rights if this is appropri-
ate in the light of the purposes sought by the specific processing along 
with technical and organizational measures aimed at minimizing the 
processing of personal data in pursuance of the proportionality and 
necessity principles. The processing of personal data for scientific pur-
poses should also comply with other relevant legislation, such as on 
clinical trials.*
Where personal data are processed for archiving purposes, the 
GDPR should also apply to that processing, bearing in mind that 
the GDPR should not apply to deceased persons. Public authorities 
or public or private bodies that hold records of public interest should 
be services that, pursuant to EU or member state law, have a legal 
obligation to acquire, preserve, appraise, arrange, describe, commu-
nicate, promote, disseminate, and provide access to records of endur-
ing value for general public interest. Member states should also be 
authorized to provide for the further processing of personal data for 
archiving purposes; for example, with a view to providing specific 
information related to the political behavior under former totalitarian 
state regimes, genocide, crimes against humanity, in particular the 
Holocaust, or war crimes.†
Where personal data are processed for scientific research purposes, 
the GDPR should also apply to that processing. For the purposes of 
the GDPR, the processing of personal data for scientific research pur-
poses should be interpreted in a broad manner, including, for example
•	 Technological development and demonstration.
•	 Fundamental research.
•	 Applied research.
•	 Privately funded research.‡
In addition, it should take into account the EU’ s objective under 
Article 179(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European 
Union of achieving a European Research Area. Scientific research

purposes should also include studies conducted in the public 
interest in the area of public health. To meet the specificities of 
processing personal data for scientific research purposes, specific 
conditions should apply in particular as regards the publication or 
otherwise disclosure of personal data in the context of scientific 
research purposes. If the result of scientific research, in particular 
in the health context, gives reason for further measures in the inter-
est of the individual data subject, the general rules of the GDPR 
should apply in view of those measures.*
Where personal data are processed for historical research pur-
poses, the GDPR should also apply to that processing. This should 
also include historical research and research for genealogical pur-
poses, bearing in mind that the GDPR should not apply to deceased 
persons.† For the purpose of consenting to the participation in sci-
entific research activities in clinical trials, the relevant provisions 
of Regulation 536/2014 should apply.‡ Where personal data are 
processed for statistical purposes, the GDPR should apply to that 
processing. EU or member state law should, within the limits of 
the GDPR, determine statistical content, control of access, speci-
fications for the processing of personal data for statistical purposes, 
and appropriate measures to safeguard the rights of the individual 
data subject and for ensuring statistical confidentiality. “ Statistical 
purposes”  means any operation of collection and the processing of 
personal data necessary for statistical surveys or for the production 
of statistical results. Those statistical results may further be used for 
different purposes, including a scientific research purpose. The sta-
tistical purpose implies that the result of processing for statistical 
purposes is not personal data, but aggregate data, and that this result 
or the personal data are not used in support of measures or decisions 
regarding any particular natural person.§

ments for certification mechanisms, information to be presented by

standardized icons, and procedures for providing such icons.* The 
examination procedure should be used for
•	 The adoption of implementing acts on standard contrac-
tual clauses between controllers and processors and between 
processors.
•	 Codes of conduct.
•	 Technical standards and mechanisms for certification.
•	 The adequate level of protection afforded by a third country, a 
territory or a specified sector within that third country, or an 
international organization.
•	 Standard protection clauses.
•	 Formats and procedures for the exchange of information by 
electronic means between controllers, processors, and data 
protection supervisory authorities for binding corporate rules.
•	 Mutual assistance.
•	 Arrangements for the exchange of information by electronic 
means between data protection supervisory authorities, and 
between data protection supervisory authorities and the 
European Data Protection Board.†
The EU Commission should adopt immediately applicable imple-
menting acts where available evidence reveals that a third country, a 
territory or a specified sector within that third country, or an inter-
national organization does not ensure an adequate level of protection, 
and imperative grounds of urgency so require.‡
Legal Rule
Processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or 
historical research purposes, or statistical purposes must be subject to 
appropriate safeguards, in accordance with the GDPR, for the rights 
of the data subject. Those safeguards must ensure that technical and 
organizational measures are in place in particular to ensure respect 
for the principle of data minimization. Those measures may include

pseudonymization, provided that those purposes can be fulfilled in 
that manner. Where those purposes can be fulfilled by further pro-
cessing that does not permit or no longer permits the identification of 
data subjects, those purposes must be fulfilled in that manner.*
Where personal data are processed for scientific or historical 
research purposes or statistical purposes, EU or member state law 
may provide for derogations from the rights referred to in Articles 
15 (access right), 16 (rectification right), 18 (restriction of processing 
right), and 21 (right to object), subject to the conditions and safe-
guards referred to in previous sections, insofar as such rights are likely 
to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the spe-
cific purposes, and such derogations are necessary for the fulfillment 
of those purposes.†
Where personal data are processed for archiving purposes in the 
public interest, EU or member state law may provide for derogations 
from the rights referred to in Articles 15 (access right), 16 (rectifica-
tion right), 18 (restriction of processing right), 19 (notification obliga-
tion regarding rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction

to the conditions and safeguards referred to in paragraph 1 of this 
Article insofar as such rights are likely to render impossible or seri-
ously impair the achievement of the specific purposes, and such dero-
gations are necessary for the fulfillment of those purposes.‡
Where the processing referred to serves at the same time another 
purpose, the derogations must apply only to processing for the pur-
poses referred to in those paragraphs.§
Obligations of Secrecy
Article 84 is headed “ Obligations of Secrecy.”  Member states may 
adopt specific rules to set out the powers of the data protection super-
visory authorities laid down in Article 58(1)(e) and (f) in relation to 
controllers or processors that are subject, under EU or member state

law or rules established by national competent bodies, to an obliga-
tion of professional secrecy or other equivalent obligations of secrecy, 
where this is necessary and proportionate to reconcile the right of 
the protection of personal data with the obligation of secrecy. Those 
rules must apply only with regard to personal data that the controller 
or processor has received as a result of or has obtained in an activity 
covered by that obligation of secrecy.*
Churches and Religious Associations
Where, in a member state, churches and religious associations or com-
munities apply, at the time of entry into force of the GDPR, compre-
hensive rules relating to the protection of natural persons with regard 
to processing, such rules may continue to apply, provided that they are 
brought into line with the GDPR.†
Churches and religious associations that apply comprehensive rules 
in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article must be subject to the 
supervision of an independent data protection supervisory author-
ity, which may be specific, provided that it fulfills the conditions laid 
down in Chapter VI of the GDPR.‡

supervisory authorities. The GDPR eliminated the general need for 
such notification or registration.
While that obligation produces administrative and financial 
burdens, it did not in all cases contribute to improving the pro-
tection of personal data. Such indiscriminate general notification 
obligations should therefore be abolished, and replaced by effec-
tive procedures and mechanisms that focus instead on those types 
of processing operations that are likely to result in a high risk to 
the rights of natural persons by virtue of their nature, scope, con-
text, and purposes. Such types of processing operations may be 
those that, in particular, involve using new technologies, or are of 
a new kind and where no data protection impact assessment has 
been carried out before by the controller, or where they become 
necessary in the light of the time that has elapsed since the initial 
processing.*
Conclusion
The GDPR, following on from the DPD95, sets standards and 
parameters in relation to the collection, use, and processing as regards 
general personal data and sensitive personal data. Chapter  IX of the 
GDPR also sets out rules in relation to a number of specific data pro-
cessing situations.
KEY CONCEPTS 
Organizations must comply with the prior information 
requirements, the principles, the legitimate processing con-
ditions, and security, and also be aware of and comply with 
additional provisions, such as employment personal data pro-
cessing, and other additional rules when the specific situations 
listed apply.

Data Protection 
Supervisory Authorities
Introduction
Organizations need to be familiar with the official data protection 
supervisory authorities in the territories that they deal with. The EU 
member state data protection supervisory authorities enforce, and 
advise on, the data protection rules. In addition, the data protection 
officer of the organization should liaise with and provide their contact 
details to the data protection supervisory authority. Individual data 
subjects can also complain.
Data Protection Supervisory Authorities
What happens if an organization does not comply with the data pro-
tection regime when dealing with the personal data of customers, and 
so on (referred to collectively as “ customers” )? A series of offenses 
are set out in the data protection rules. These are designed to ensure 
compliance with the data protection regime, from registration to fair 
use of personal data. Organizations must fully comply with their obli-
gations. Questions arise in relation to their continued use of personal 
data if they have not been collected fairly. Investigations, prosecu-
tions, and financial penalties can arise.
The GDPR sets out significant amendments to the prosecution and 
fines regime for non-compliance. As indicated previously, there can 
be consequences in terms of due diligence, value, and the ability to 
maintain a customer database.
When things go wrong, there can be legal and publicity conse-
quences for the organization. The impact of a data protection breach 
can mean an immediate cross-team effort to deal with the data pro-
tection breach.

4 42
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
In dealing with an incident, and in planning for compliance with 
customers’  personal data, organizations should be aware of the vari-
ous data protection supervisory authority enforcement powers. These 
emphasize the importance of consequences for non-compliance. 
Enforcement proceedings can be issued by the data protection super-
visory authority. Significant fines and penalties can result. Also, poten-
tially, individual customers may decide to sue for damage, loss, and 
breach of their personal data rights.
Tasks
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provides that each 
data protection supervisory authority has the following tasks
•	 Monitor and enforce the application of the GDPR.
•	 Promote public awareness and understanding of the risks, 
rules, safeguards, and rights in relation to processing. 
Activities addressed specifically to children must receive spe-
cific attention.
•	 Advise, in accordance with member state law, the national 
parliament, the government, and other institutions and 
bodies on legislative and administrative measures relating 
to the protection of natural persons’  rights with regard to 
processing.
•	 Promote the awareness of controllers and processors of their 
obligations under the GDPR.
•	 On request, provide information to any individual data sub-
ject concerning the exercise of their rights under the GDPR 
and, if appropriate, cooperate with the data protection super-
visory authorities in other member states to that end.
•	 Handle complaints lodged by an individual data subject or 
by a body, organization, or association in accordance with 
Article 80, investigate, to the extent appropriate, the subject 
matter of the complaint, and inform the complainant of the 
progress and the outcome of the investigation within a rea-
sonable period, in particular if further investigation or coor-
dination with another data protection supervisory authority is 
necessary. [f]

data.*
Each data protection supervisory authority must facilitate the sub-
mission of complaints referred to in Point (f) by measures such as a 
complaint submission form that can also be completed electronically, 
without excluding other means of communication.†
The performance of the tasks of each data protection supervisory 
authority must be free of charge for the individual data subject and, 
where applicable, for the data protection officer.‡
Investigative Powers
Pursuant to the new GDPR, each data protection supervisory author-
ity has the following investigative powers
•	 To order the controller and the processor and, where applica-
ble, the controller’ s or the processor’ s representative to provide 
any information it requires for the performance of its tasks.
•	 To carry out investigations in the form of data protection 
audits.

safeguards, including effective judicial remedy and due process, set 
out in EU and member state law in accordance with the EU Charter.*
Each member state must provide by law that its data protection 
supervisory authority must have the power to bring infringements 
of the GDPR to the attention of the judicial authorities and where 
appropriate, to commence or engage otherwise in legal proceedings to 
enforce the provisions of the GDPR.†
Each member state may provide by law that its data protection 
supervisory authority must have additional powers to those referred 
to in this section. The exercise of those powers must not impair the 
effective operation of Chapter  VII of the GDPR.‡
Independence
Chapter  VI of the GDPR refers to the independent data protec-
tion supervisory authorities. The reference to and emphasis on their 
independent status are noteworthy. The independence of data protec-
tion supervisory authorities (from political interference or influence) 
has been questioned in a number of instances. The GDPR assists in 
emphasizing the need for independence.
Data protection supervisory authorities§ and the complete inde-
pendence of data protection supervisory authorities are referred to in 
Recitals 121 and 153 and Articles 4, 51, and 52. Chapter  VI, Section  1 
of the GDPR refers to their “ independent status.”  Each member state 
must provide for one or more independent public authorities to be 
responsible for monitoring the application of the GDPR so as to pro-
tect the fundamental rights of natural persons in relation to process-
ing and to facilitate the free flow of personal data within the EU (data 
protection “ supervisory authority” ).¶ Each data protection supervisory 
authority must contribute to the consistent application of the GDPR 
throughout the EU. For that purpose, the data protection supervisory

authorities must cooperate with each other and the EU Commission 
in accordance with Chapter  VII.*
Where more than one data protection supervisory authority is 
established in a member state, that member state must designate 
the data protection supervisory authority that is to represent those 
authorities in the EDPB and must set out the mechanism to ensure 
compliance by the other authorities with the rules relating to the con-
sistency mechanism referred to in Article 63.†
Each data protection supervisory authority must act with complete 
independence in performing its tasks and exercising its powers in 
accordance with the GDPR.‡ The member or members of each data 
protection supervisory authority must, in the performance of their 
tasks and exercise of their powers in accordance with the GDPR, 
remain free from external influence, whether direct or indirect, and 
must neither seek nor take instructions from anybody.§ Member or 
members of each data protection supervisory authority must refrain 
from any action incompatible with their duties and must not, during 
their term of office, engage in any incompatible occupation, whether 
gainful or not.¶
Each member state must ensure that each data protection super-
visory authority is provided with the human, technical, and financial 
resources, premises, and infrastructure necessary for the effective per-
formance of its tasks and the exercise of its powers, including those 
to be carried out in the context of mutual assistance, cooperation, 
and participation in the EDPB.** Each member state must ensure that

be part of the overall state or national budget.*
There have been a number of cases taken in relation to ensuring 
that data protection supervisory authorities are sufficiently indepen-
dent in their roles as required under EU law.†
Cooperation with National Data Protection Supervisory Authorities
Article 31 of the GDPR makes provision in relation to cooperation 
with the data protection supervisory authority. It provides that the 
controller and the processor and, where applicable, their representa-
tives must cooperate, on request, with the data protection supervisory 
authority in the performance of its tasks.
Enforcement Powers of Data Protection Supervisory Authority
The data protection supervisory authorities have a number of powers 
of enforcement available to them. These include the following.
Investigations by National Data Protection Supervisory Authorities
National data protection supervisory authorities will investigate any 
complaints the data protection supervisory authority receives from 
individuals who feel that personal information about them is not 
being treated in accordance with the law, unless the data protection 
supervisory authority is of the opinion that such complaints are “ friv-
olous or vexatious.”  The data protection supervisory authority notifies

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
the complainant in writing of their decision regarding the complaint. 
The data protection supervisory authority’ s decision can be appealed 
to court.
The data protection supervisory authority may also launch inves-
tigations on its own initiative where the data protection supervisory 
authority is of the opinion that there might be a breach of the data 
protection rules, or it considers it appropriate to ensure compliance 
with the data protection laws.
Power to Obtain Information
The data protection supervisory authority may require any person to 
provide it with whatever information the data protection supervi-
sory authority needs to carry out its functions, such as to pursue an 
investigation. The data protection supervisory authority exercises this 
power by providing a written notice, called an information notice , to 
the person.
Power to Enforce Compliance with the Data Protection Laws
The data protection supervisory authority may require a controller 
or processor to take whatever steps the data protection supervisory 
authority considers appropriate to comply with the terms of the data 
protection laws. Such steps could include correcting the data, blocking 
the data from use for certain purposes, supplementing the data with a 
statement that the data protection supervisory authority approves, or 
erasing the data altogether. The data protection supervisory authority 
exercises this power by providing a written notice, called an enforce-
ment notice , to the controller or processor. A person who receives an 
enforcement notice has the right to appeal it to court. It is an offense 
to fail or refuse to comply with an enforcement notice without reason-
able excuse.
Power to Prohibit Overseas Transfer of Personal Data
The data protection supervisory authority may prohibit the transfer 
of personal data from a member state to a place outside the member 
state. The data protection supervisory authority exercises this power 

451
Data Protection Supervisory Authorities
by providing a written notice, called a prohibition notice , to the con-
troller or processor. In considering whether to exercise this power, the 
data protection supervisory authority must have regard to the need to 
facilitate international transfers of information.
A prohibition notice may be absolute or may prohibit the transfer 
of personal data until the person concerned takes certain steps to pro-
tect the interests of the individuals affected. A person who receives 
an enforcement notice has the right to appeal it to the court. It is an 
offense to fail or refuse to comply with a prohibition specified in a 
prohibition notice without reasonable excuse.
Powers of Authorized Officers to Enter and Examine
The data protection supervisory authority may appoint an authorized 
officer to enter and examine the premises of a controller or proces-
sor to enable the data protection supervisory authority to carry out 
its functions, such as to pursue an investigation. The authorized offi-
cer, on production of written authorization from the data protection 
supervisory authority, has the power to
•	 Enter the premises and inspect any data equipment there.
•	 Require the controller, processor, or staff to assist in obtaining 
access to data and to provide any related information.
•	 Inspect and copy any information.
•	 Require the controller, processor, or staff to provide infor-
mation about procedures on complying with the law, sources 
of data, purposes for which personal data are kept, persons 
to whom data are disclosed, and data equipment on the 
premises.
It is an offense to obstruct or impede an authorized officer; to fail 
to comply with any of the requirements set out in the preceding list; 
or knowingly to give false or misleading information to an authorized 
officer.
Prosecution of Offenses
The data protection supervisory authority may bring summary pro-
ceedings for an offense under the data protection rules. The data 

452
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
protection supervisory authority also has the power to prosecute 
offenses in relation to unsolicited marketing.
Formal undertaking agreements can also arise, whereby the orga-
nization agrees to do or not do certain things. The US Federal Trade 
Commission has also issued many consent agreements in relation to 
breach issues.
Notifying Data Breach to Data Protection Supervisory Authority
As soon as the controller becomes aware that a personal data breach 
has occurred, the controller should notify the personal data breach to 
the data protection supervisory authority without undue delay and, 
where feasible, not later than 72  hours after having become aware of 
it, unless the controller is able to demonstrate, in accordance with the 
accountability principle, that the personal data breach is unlikely to 
result in a risk to the rights of natural persons. Where such notifica-
tion cannot be achieved within 72  hours, the reasons for the delay 
should accompany the notification, and information may be provided

breach issues.
European Data Protection Board
The new EDPB has been established. This effectively replaces the 
Article 29 Data Protection Working Party (WP29). References to 
the previous WP29 must be construed as references to the EDPB 
established by the GDPR.
Background Guidance
To promote the consistent application of the GDPR, the EDPB 
should be set up as an independent body of the EU. To fulfill its objec-
tives, the EDPB should have legal personality. The EDPB should be 
represented by its chair. It should replace the Working Party on the 
Protection of Individuals with Regard to the Processing of Personal 
Data established by 1995 data protection directive (DPD95). It should

Data Protection Supervisory Authorities
consist of the head of a data protection supervisory authority of each 
member state and the European Data Protection Supervisor (which 
deals mostly with issues regarding the EU official bodies) or their 
respective representatives. The EU Commission should participate in 
the EDPB’ s activities without voting rights, and the European Data 
Protection Supervisor should have specific voting rights. The EDPB 
should contribute to the consistent application of the GDPR through-
out the EU, including by advising the EU Commission, in particular 
on the level of protection in third countries or international organiza-
tions, and promoting cooperation of the data protection supervisory 
authorities throughout the EU. The EDPB should act independently 
when performing its tasks.*
Legal Rule
Article 68(1) provides that the EDPB is established as a body of the 
EU and must have legal personality. The EDPB must be composed of 
the head of one data protection supervisory authority of each member 
state and of the European Data Protection Supervisor (which deals 
with EU bodies) or their respective representatives.† Article 69 refers 
to the independence of EDPB. Article 70 refers to the EDPB tasks.
Chapter  VII, Section  3 of the GDPR provides for the EDPB. The 
EDPB is established as a body of the EU and must have legal person-
ality.‡ The EDPB must be composed of the head of one data protec-
tion supervisory authority of each member state and of the European 
Data Protection Supervisor (dealing with issues regarding the EU 
bodies) or their respective representatives.§ The EDPB must act inde-
pendently when performing its tasks or exercising its powers.¶
Conclusion
The role, activities, and powers of the data protection supervisory 
authorities will be critical to how data protection operates in practice.

EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
Organizations will inevitably interact with the data protection super-
visory authorities on a regular basis in terms of queries, advice, and 
notifications regarding the data protection officer, but also in terms of 
problem issues that might arise, such as data breaches and complaints.
KEY CONCEPTS 
The data protection supervisory authorities are central to the 
operation of the data protection rules. The data protection 
supervisory authorities are important for organizations to deal 
with not only in terms of normal processes but also in cases of 
problem issues or even contentious matters. The guidance that 
data protection supervisory authorities issue will be of assistance 
to organizations. Similarly, the guidance from the EDPB will 
also assist organizations.

The Data Protection 
Officer
Introduction
Now, organizations need to have a designated data protection offi-
cer to deal with the data protection compliance obligations, handling 
individual data subject access requests, and so on. This can be in addi-
tion to the privacy officer, whom many organizations may have already 
appointed. That is not to say that the responsibility of the board of the 
organization for data protection compliance is in any way lessened. 
Organizations are now required to have a data protection officer. In 
addition, the role and task requirements are now more explicit. The 
data protection officer must also have an appropriate independence in 
their activities and cannot be compromised or dictated to in a manner 
that undermines their role and duties in relation to personal data. It 
is now clear that the profession of the independent and expert data 
protection officer has arrived.
New Data Protection Officers
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) refers to the new 
requirement for data protection officers in organizations. Chapter  IV, 
Section  4 of the new GDPR refers to the new role and requirement of 
data protection officers and the obligation for organizations to appoint 
data protection officers. Article 37 is headed “ Designation of the Data 
Protection Officer.”  Article 37(1) states that the controller and the 
processor must designate a data protection officer in any case where
•	 The processing is carried out by a public authority or body, 
except for courts acting in their judicial capacity.
•	 The core activities of the controller or the processor consist 
of processing operations that, by virtue of their nature, their 

458
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
scope, and/or their purposes, require regular and systematic 
monitoring of individual data subjects on a large scale.
•	 The core activities of the controller or the processor consist of 
processing on a large scale of special categories of data* and 
personal data relating to criminal convictions and offenses.†
The data protection officer must in the performance of their 
tasks have due regard to the risk associated with processing opera-
tions, taking into account the nature, scope, context, and purposes of 
processing.‡
Where the controller or the processor is a public authority or body, 
a single data protection officer may be designated for several such 
authorities or bodies, taking account of their organizational structure 
and size.§
The controller or processor or associations and other bodies repre-
senting categories of controllers or processors may or, where required 
by EU or member state law must designate a data protection officer. 
The data protection officer may act for such associations and other 
bodies representing controllers or processors.¶
The data protection officer must be designated on the basis of pro-
fessional qualities and, in particular, expert knowledge of data protec-
tion law and practices and the ability to fulfill the tasks referred to in 
Article 39.**
The data protection officer may be a staff member of the controller 
or processor or fulfill the tasks on the basis of a service contract.††
The controller or the processor must publish the contact details of 
the data protection officer and communicate them to the data protec-
tion supervisory authority.‡‡

officer in performing the tasks referred to in Article 39 by providing the 
resources necessary to carry out those tasks and access to personal data 
and processing operations, and to maintain their expert knowledge.†
The controller and processor must ensure that the data protec-
tion officer does not receive any instructions regarding the exercise of 
those tasks. They must not be dismissed or penalized by the controller 
or the processor for performing their tasks. The data protection officer 
must directly report to the highest management level of the controller 
or the processor.‡
Data subjects may contact the data protection officer with regard to 
all issues related to processing of their personal data and to the exer-
cise of their rights under the GDPR.§

authority.
It is important that the data protection officer has regard to the 
risks that may arise specific to the organization in relation to personal 
data and processing issues (including security issues). Depending on 
the sector, there may also be code of conduct and or certification issues 
for the data protection officer to be concerned with. Data protection 
seals and certification are meant to help organizations demonstrate 
compliance.

The Data Protection Officer
Data Protection by Design and Data Protection by Default
Article 25 of the GDPR refers to data protection by design. It also 
refers to data protection by default. These are increasingly important 
requirements in data protection. The data protection officer will pro-
mote education and adherence in relation to both of these new con-
cepts within the organization.
Article 25(1) introduces this topic by saying that taking into account 
the state of the art, the cost of implementation, and the nature, scope, 
context, and purposes of processing as well as the risks of varying 
likelihood and severity for rights of natural persons posed by the pro-
cessing, the controller must, both at the time of the determination 
of the means for processing and at the time of the processing itself, 
implement appropriate technical and organizational measures, such 
as pseudonymization, which are designed to implement data protec-
tion principles, such as data minimization, in an effective manner and 
to integrate the necessary safeguards into the processing to meet the 
requirements of the GDPR and protect the rights of individual data 
subjects.
The controller must implement appropriate technical and organi-
zational measures for ensuring that, by default, only personal data 
that are necessary for each specific purpose of the processing are pro-
cessed. That obligation applies to the amount of personal data col-
lected, the extent of their processing, the period of their storage, and 
their accessibility. In particular, such measures must ensure that by 
default, personal data are not made accessible without the individual’ s 
intervention to an indefinite number of natural persons.*
An approved certification mechanism pursuant to Article 42 may 
be used as an element to demonstrate compliance with the require-
ments set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article.† The data protec-
tion officer will be active in monitoring the existence of appropriate 
codes within the industry sector appropriate to the organization. This 
will apply similarly to any other developments in relation to stan-
dards for data protection and data protection awareness in respective 
industries.
*	 GDPR Article 25(2).
†	 GDPR Article 25(3).

464
EU DATA PROTECTION RULES
Conclusion
So, organizations must designate a data protection officer, includ-
ing to
•	 Monitor internal compliance with the GDPR regime and 
rules
•	 Where the processing is undertaken in the public sector; 
or
•	 Where the processing requires regular and systematic 
monitoring of individual data subjects on a large scale; or
•	 Where the processing is on a large scale of special cat-
egories of data pursuant to Article 9 and data relating to 
criminal convictions and offenses
•	 Ensure the governance of the organization’ s data management.
•	 Draft and update compliant data protection policies.
•	 Implement systems, changes, and functions in terms of being 
compliant.
The data protection officer should be qualified and have particular 
expertise in data protection law and practice. They need to be able to 
fulfill their tasks in compliance and conformity with the GDPR. It 
appears that they may be either an employee or a contractor.
The data protection officer’ s details must be made available pub-
licly, and the data protection supervisory authority should be notified.
The organization must involve the data protection officer in a timely 
manner in relation to all issues relating to the protection of personal 
data and individual data subject issues. Proper and adequate resources 
must be supplied to the data protection officer by the organization so 
that they can undertake their tasks. There is an obligation that the 
data protection officer has independence in their role and functions, 
and that they cannot be controlled, micromanaged, or instructed in 
relation to their tasks.
The data protection officer will report to the board of the organiza-
tion or highest management level as appropriate. This also emphasizes 
the increasing importance attached to data protection understanding 
and compliance.
The data protection officer advises the organization and employees 
in relation to their data protection obligations under national law and 

465
The Data Protection Officer
the GDPR. They will also monitor compliance with the data protec-
tion legal regime as well as internal policies. They will also be involved 
in assigning responsibilities, raising awareness, and staff education 
and training.
Data protection officers should be involved in highlighting ongoing 
changes and the new GDPR to the organization. Key issues need to 
be identified to appropriate management. New and ongoing change 
and compliance issues need appropriate resourcing. The data protec-
tion officer should assess what personal data the organization col-
lects and processes, for what purpose, and where they are located and 
secured. Particular attention is needed with outsourcing issues and 
contracts with processors. Contracts, including service-level agree-
ments in relation to information technology (IT) systems, the cloud, 
and so on may be assessed. The various IT hardware, software, and 
systems that employees use need to be considered.
The structure of the organization or groups needs to be considered 
as well as jurisdiction and location issues. The life cycle, storage, and 
disposal of personal data are also an important consideration for the 
new data protection officer.
The processes, policies, and documentation must be maintained by 
the organization, which places particular obligations on the data pro-
tection officer to consider the different documentation sets.
Further details and commentary on data protection officers can 
be found in the book The Data Protection Officer: Profession, Rules and 
Role .* Undoubtedly, the role and importance of the data protection 
officer will continue to grow, as will the tasks and activities of the data 
protection officer.
KEY CONCEPTS 
To assist in data protection compliance, assist regulators, and 
assist individual data subjects, it is increasingly necessary for 
organizations to appoint data protection officers. The GDPR 
enhances this obligation.

Appendix I: The Sources of 
Data Protection Law
What are the various sources of data protection law? Organizations, 
data protection officers, and individuals need to consider a number 
of sources of the law, policy, and practice underpinning the data pro-
tection regime. In addition, there is a growing number of sources of 
interpretation and understanding of data protection law. Reliance on 
the data protection rules alone can, therefore, be insufficient. Data 
protection is, therefore, arguably quite different from many other 
areas of legal practice. In order to fully understand the data protection 
regime, one has to look beyond the text, or first principles, of the data 
protection rules and GDPR. What are the sources of data protection 
law and policy? Some of these are referred to below.
National Data Protection Laws/Acts
Primarily, the data protection regime is governed by the data protec-
tion rules and new GDPR. In addition, it is also necessary to have 
regard to a number of other sources of law, policy, and the interpreta-
tion of the data protection regime. It is also necessary to look out for 
any amendments to these.

468
Appendix I
National Secondary Legislation
In addition to the data protection rules, the legal statutory instruments 
need to be considered.
EU Data Protection Law
The main sources of EU data protection laws include
•	 GDPR.
•	 DPD95.
•	 ePrivacy Directive* and proposed replacement entitled Proposal 
for a Regulation on Privacy and Electronic Communications  
(2017).
•	 Regulation re processing of personal data by the EU institu-
tions and bodies.†
It is also necessary to look out for any amendments to these.
The new GDPR is the most important development in EU data 
protection since 1995. There are significant implications for organiza-
tions and data protection practice.
Data Protection Convention
The Council of Europe Data Protection Convention in relation to 
data protection is also important

Appendix I
Caselaw
Increasingly, data protection cases (and cases that involve direct or 
indirect reference to personal data and information impacting the 
data protection regime) are coming to be litigated and determined 
before the courts.
One of the reasons is that individuals are increasingly aware of 
and concerned about their rights under the data protection regime. 
A further reason is that technological developments have enhanced 
the potential abuse of personal data, from non-transparent collections 
of personal data, spam, unsolicited direct marketing, hacking, data 
loss, phishing, email and Internet scams, online abuse, offline abuse, 
data transfers, access to personal data, and so on, as well as litiga-
tion related access to personal data, and so on. Personal data access 
requests are permissible, even in the case of ongoing litigation.
The caselaw that can be relevant to applying and interpreting the 
data protection regime include
•	 Cases in EU countries.
•	 Documentation from the data protection supervisory 
authorities.
•	 Case complaints adjudicated by the data protection supervi-
sory authorities.
•	 Cases in England and Wales and Scotland.
•	 EU Court of Justice (ECJ/CJEU*) cases.
•	 EU Court of Human Rights (ECHR) cases.
•	 Relevant cases in other EU member states.
•	 Relevant cases in other common law jurisdictions.
Investigations
Investigations by the data protection supervisory authority can occur 
as a result of complaints or via proactive data protection supervisory 
authority investigations. The data protection supervisory authority is

Organizations should consult the data protection supervisory 
authority websites for guidance on specific issues.
Data Protection Supervisory Authority Determinations
In addition, there is a body of decided decisions in relation to com-
plaints filed by individuals with the national data protection super-
visory authorities on various issues. These can assist in considering 
identical and similar situations regarding issues of data protection 
compliance.* Many organizations have altered various data protection 
related practices pursuant to the data protection supervisory authority 
audits, with certain issues ongoing.
Legal Textbooks and Further Reading
There is an increasing number of data protection legal textbooks and 
guides. There are also relevant learned journals and articles published 
in relation to data protection compliance and developing data protec-
tion issues.
European Data Protection Board
In terms of the interpretation and understanding of the data protec-
tion regime, the EDPB† is also required to be consulted. This is an 
influential body in relation to addressing and interpreting the data 
protection regime, as well as problem areas in data protection practice. 
It is also influential as it is comprised of members from the respective 
data protection authorities in the European Union.

The Data Protection Convention* of 1981 pre-dates the DPD95 
and the new GDPR and is incorporated into the national law of many 
EU and other states— even prior to the DPD95. The Council of 
Europe is reviewing and updating the Data Protection Convention.†
Other Data Protection Supervisory Authorities
Issues that may not yet be decided or formally reported on can some-
times have been considered elsewhere. It can, therefore, be useful to 
consider the decisions and logic behind decisions, reports, and opin-
ions of the

states.
•	 Data protection supervisory authorities of EU member states.
•	 Data protection supervisory authorities of other states (for 
example, Canada).

Other Official Sources
Government or official reports can be beneficial and applicable on 
certain data protection topics. Industry codes that may be agreed with 
the data protection supervisory authority can also be relevant to those 
industries, for example, the industry sector codes of practice in rela-
tion to data protection.
Related issues can sometimes arise under freedom of information 
legislation.
Industry bodies also publish recommendations and information 
regarding aspects of data protection.
Tribunals can also be relevant, including the Leveson Inquiry in 
terms of protection for personal data, security, deliberate breaches, 
hacking, and so on, and the data protection supervisory authority 
investigation (Operation Motorman).

Data Retention
The EU Court of Justice also pronounced on the often contentious 
area of official data retention. This is the obligation placed by coun-
tries on Internet service providers (ISPs) to retain certain customer 
data in relation to telephone calls, Internet searches, and so on, so 
that (certain) official agencies can ask to access or obtain copies of 
such data in future. Debate frequently surrounds whether this should 
be permitted at all, and if so, when and under what circumstances, 
how long ISPs must store such data, and so on. The strongest argu-
ment for an official data retention regime may relate to the prevention 
or investigation of terrorism. Serious crime might come next. There 
are certainly legitimate concerns that the privacy and data protection 
costs are such that official data retention, if permitted, should not 
extend to “ common decent crime.”  On one end of the spectrum is the 
EU Court of Justice decision in Digital Rights Ireland  striking down 

485
Appendix I
the EU Data Retention Directive as invalid.* By implication this also 
undermines many national data retention measures.† It remains to 
be seen how challenges to new data retention legislation may tran-
spire, and how courts and policymakers will react. This remains, if 
anything, a contentious issue. The various Snowden revelations and 
their ripple effects lean against the data retention regime, or at least 
an overly broad and overreaching one. In addition to debate in rela-
tion to legitimate data retention, there is a separate but related debate 
(especially in the United States and the United Kingdom) in relation 
to encryption, encryption by default, encryption by service provid-
ers, personal encryption, and encryption back doors for law enforce-
ment authorities.‡ However, every time there is a terror related event, 
and at the time of writing we are in the aftermath of attacks, calls 
and arguments for data retention/extended data retention are at their 
*	 Judgment in Joined Cases C-293/12 and C-594/12, Digital Rights Ireland  and 
Seitlinger and Others , Court of Justice, 8 April 2014. Directive 2006/24/EC of the 
European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 on the retention of data 
generated or processed in connection with the provision of publicly available elec-
tronic communications services or of public communications networks and amend-
ing Directive 2002/58/EC (OJ 2006 L105, p 54). Rauhofer and Mac Sithigh, “The 
Data Retention Directive Never Existed,” SCRIPTed  (2014)(11:1) 118.
†	 Such as the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA) in the UK. The 
UK government proposed a new amending regulation entitled the Data Retention 
and Investigatory Powers Act 2014 (DRIPA). However, two MPs (David Davis 
and Tom Watson), successfully challenged DRIPA in the High Court. The court 
held that sections 1 and 2 of DRIPA breached rights to respect for private life and 
communications and to the protection of personal data under Articles 7 and 8 of 
the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. The decision gave the (UK) government 
until March 2016 to rectify the DRIPA problems. The Queen’ s speech has also 
promised a “ snooper’ s charter”  which would replace DRIPA. See Whitehead, 
“Google and Whatsapp Will be Forced to Hand Messages to MI5,” Telegraph , 27 
May 2015. Since then a draft of the Communications Data Bill has issued. No 
doubt argument, debate and research will ensue. In relation to “Data Protection as 
a Fundamental Right,” see, for example Rodata, Data protection as a fundamental 
right, in Gutwirth, Poullet, de Hert, de Terwangne and Nouwt, Reinventing Data 
Protection?  (Springer, 2009) 77.
‡	 A Harvard study suggests, inter alia , that an encryption back door would in any 
event be ineffective. See Schneier, Siedel and Vijayakumar, A Worldwide Survey 
of Encryption Products, (Harvard, 11 February 2016). Also Barrett, “Bill Aims to 
Stop State Level Encryption Before It Starts,” Wired , 10 February 2016. Also note

strongest.* While the issues of official data retention  are important, 
it is a separate subject to data protection . This book focuses on data 
protection alone.
*	 Prime Minister Cameron (as he then was) made statements to advance data reten-
tion proposals, in particular the Communications Data Bill, labelled by some as 
a “snooper’ s charter.” Critics also increasingly suggest that research is indicating 
that data retention does not demonstrate that data retention works. However, offi-
cial sources in various jurisdictions refer to terror attacks being prevented and that 
retained data is invaluable. The link or proof of positive effect is not necessarily 
specified. This debate also crosses over with issues of unauthorized access or tap-
ping by official agencies of technology companies and their customers’  data, and 
public and industry arguments that official access must be regulated, transparent, 
and proportional.

487
Appendix II: How to Comply with 
the Data Protection Regime
How does an organization comply with the data protection regime? 
What are the different components of compliance? The tables below 
set out assistance how to comply with the data protection regime.
COMPLYING WITH DATA PROTECTION
 All organizations collect and process at least some personal data 
as defined under the Data Protection Acts and the data protec-
tion regime. Therefore, an organization must ensure it only col-
lects and processes personal data if complying with
•	 The obligation to only collect and process personal data if in 
compliance with the data protection laws.
•	 The principles, also known as the “ data quality principles.” 
•	 The legitimate processing conditions.
•	 The requirement that processing of personal data be “ legit-
imate”  under at least one of the legitimate processing 
conditions.

488
Appendix II
•	 The transparency and prior information requirement 
obligations.
•	 Recognizing the two categories of personal data covered by 
the data protection regime, namely, sensitive personal data 
and non-sensitive general personal data.
•	 In the case of sensitive personal data, complying with the 
additional sensitive personal data legitimate processing 
conditions.
•	 Ensuring the fair obtaining of all personal data collected and 
processed.
•	 The security conditions.
•	 The notification and registration conditions (as applicable).
•	 The data breach notification conditions.
•	 The personal data outsourcing and processor conditions.
•	 Implementing formal legal contracts when engaging or deal-
ing with third-party processors (e.g., outsourcing data pro-
cessing tasks or activities).
•	 Complying with the separate criteria in relation to automated 
decision-making processes or automated decisions.
•	 The personal data transfer ban or trans-border data flow 
restrictions. The transfers of personal data outside of EU is 
strictly controlled. Personal data may not be transferred out-
side of the EU unless specifically permitted under the data 
protection regime.
•	 Complying with the legal criteria for direct marketing.
•	 The individual data subject rights, including access, deletion, 
and so on.
•	 Access requests, or requests by individuals for copies of their 
personal data held by the organization, must be complied 
with (unless excepted).
•	 A duty of care exists in relation to the individual data sub-
jects whose personal data the organization is collecting and 
processing.
•	 Queries, audits, and investigation orders from the data pro-
tection supervisory authority.
•	 The time limits for undertaking various tasks and obligations.

489
Appendix II
•	 Implementing internal privacy policies and terms.
•	 Implementing outward-facing privacy policies for customers, 
and so on.
•	 Implementing outward-facing website privacy statements 
(generally a data protection policy covers organization-wide 
activities, whereas a website privacy statement governs only 
the online collection and processing of personal data).
•	 Implementing device, mobile, computer, and Internet usage 
policies.
•	 Implementing data loss, data breach, incident handling and 
incident reporting policies, and associated reaction plans.
•	 Data incidents, losses, and breaches need to be reported to the 
data protection supervisory authority (unless exempted).
•	 Keeping abreast of the increasing trend toward sector/issue 
specific rules, for example spam; direct marketing.
•	 Industry codes of conduct in relation to personal data.
•	 Children and personal data issues.
•	 Data protection impact assessments and privacy consultations.
•	 Data protection by design and by default.
•	 Complying with new legal developments.
DATA PROTECTION PRINCIPLES
 The new GDPR sets out the data protection principles as fol-
lows, namely that personal data must be
•	 Processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner in rela-
tion to the Individual data subject (“ lawfulness, fairness, and 
transparency” ).
•	 Collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and 
not further processed in a way incompatible with those pur-

personal data, including protection against unauthorized or 
unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, 
or damage, using appropriate technical or organizational 
measures (“ integrity and confidentiality” ).
The controller must be responsible for and be able to demon-
strate  compliance with the above (“ accountability” ).
