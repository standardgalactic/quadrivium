About the Author
Suzanne Gilad is the founder of PaidToProofread.com. Over the course of ten
years, Sue proofread or copyedited over 1,200 books for Random House,
Simon & Schuster, John Wiley & Sons, St. Martin’s Press, Oxford University
Press, and Workman Publishing, among others.
Illustrating firsthand that proofreading and copyediting can be profitable and
fun while allowing additional pursuits, Sue is also a successful voice-over
artist based in New York. You can hear her voice happily hawking products
and playing characters on national and regional radio and television.
Thanks to some unexpected proofreading projects on personal finance a few
years ago, a whole world of education in residual income opened for Sue. 
She wrote The Real Estate Millionaire (McGraw-Hill, 2005) with her husband,
Boaz Gilad.
Sue currently leads seminars on multiple streams of income, and her latest
passion is to teach financial freedom. Sue’s next book is the story of the cre-
ation of 15 millionaires in five years. Visit www.SueGilad.com to learn more.
Author’s Acknowledgments
This book is the culmination of thirteen years’ experience, and many people
encouraged me during the entire process. I would like to acknowledge the
generous individuals who helped bring it to fruition.
To my students at PaidToProofread.com, who gave such valuable feedback
on creating proofreading and copyediting careers across the country and the
world. Your success stories are thrilling.
Thank you to Mike Lewis and Joyce Pepple at Wiley, and to Wendalyn Nichols
who gave the manuscript such a detailed technical review. Special kudos to
editor Joan Friedman.

over the past two years. You have changed my life.
Words cannot express my gratitude to Christopher Braund Simpson and Kelly
Suzan Waggoner, without whom this book could not have been completed —
but if there were such words, Chris and Kelly would have written them.
Most of all, I am grateful to Boaz for being an extraordinary force in my life —
best friend, cheerleader, husband. With Boaz, all things are possible. In all
the romance novels I’ve edited, I have never found a hero who comes close
to mine.
Thank you, readers, students, and colleagues, for reading, absorbing, and 
utilizing the principles in this book. May your wallet and intellect grow!

Dedication
For Mom, who taught me to love literature and the magic of words.
And for my greatest muses, Noa and Ella — the next generation of 
wordsmiths.

Introduction
You read, right? Magazines, books, the back of your toothpaste tube.
(Hey, we all get desperate.) How did that stuff get written? Well, people
tend to think of writers, but few think about the unsung heroes who make
those words look good: copyeditors and proofreaders.
Most words go through an entire process before they get printed on your
toothpaste tube. Or in your magazine. Or in the juicy thriller in your back-
pack. In this book, I demystify the smoke and mirrors behind making writing
good writing.
Let me be clear from the start: The grammar check function on your word-
processing software does not create the kind of good writing I’m talking
about. Don’t get me wrong: Technology is good. But all the electronic organiz-
ers, GPS devices, and robot vacuum cleaners in the world can’t do what
people have been doing for thousands of years: communicate clearly and
effectively through writing. That task is left to the writers, who are very much
still in vogue. It can only follow that we copyeditors and proofreaders — who
clean up after writers — are very much in our heyday as well.
I wrote this book for word lovers: people with an interest in becoming copy-
editors or proofreaders, improving their language skills, and increasing their
knowledge of the world of editing. I’m not talking about snobby word freaks
here. (You know who you are, Edmund, from Freshman Composition.) I’m
talking about people who love language, have a pretty solid understanding of
how a sentence and a paragraph are put together, and truly enjoy the hunt
for errors. If I just described you, welcome to your book! You and I are going
to have a good time — promise.
About This Book
This book is meant to be used as a resource. Pick the parts that interest you
most, and get what you need from them. If you want to delve in further at a
later date, more will be waiting for you. You don’t need to read everything in
order; this is no murder mystery where each section leads to the next.
I wrote this book knowing that you may be just starting out in the career
world or you may be looking to change careers. Either way, I show you how
to prepare yourself to be a good copyeditor or proofreader (or both), build
your résumé, hunt for paying work, and excel on the job.

Conventions Used in This Book
Because almost no book can be the only resource you need on a particular
topic, I include references to lots of other helpful books and Web sites. When
you come across a Web address (which appears in monofont), be aware that
the page layout may have required it to break across two lines of text. If that
happened, trust me that I didn’t insert any extra characters (such as
hyphens) to indicate the break. So just type the link into your browser like
the break doesn’t exist. Then cross your fingers and hope that your Internet
connection is better than mine.
What You’re Not to Read
I wrote every word of this book with the hope that you’d read it. But if you’re
strapped for time, here’s a hint: Text that appears in sidebars is not critical to
your understanding of copyediting and proofreading. I include that material
for people who want a little more information or require a deeper explana-
tion. If you’re in a hurry, just ignore that stuff. I’ll never know.
Foolish Assumptions
I’m guessing you’re reading this book for one of two reasons:
 You want to become a copyeditor or proofreader. Perfect. This book
contains lots of information you need to know to become a skilled copy-
editor or proofreader — or both. Each section is designed to give you
the tools and information necessary to get hired in an increasingly com-
petitive field.
I confess that I can’t cover every topic in-depth. Most of my work
experience is with book and magazine publishing, so those fields natu-
rally get a lot of attention in the text. And much of the information
applies no matter what type of publication you want to work with.
However, working on a newspaper staff is very different from working
with a book or magazine publisher. Most people interested in newspaper
work spend at least four years and lots of dough to get a journalism
degree. I simply can’t give newspapers the coverage they deserve, but I
can (and do) suggest resources to supplement this book if newspapers
are your destination.

Copyediting & Proofreading For Dummies 

 You want to brush up your editing skills. Perfect. This book offers lots
of juicy info that can help you improve your editing skills (and your writ-
ing skills as well). This isn’t a grammar guide, but you get solid tips
about how punctuation should be used, and I point out the most com-
monly misspelled and misused words. I discuss various methods of
reading documents so you can train your eyes and your brain to catch
errors and question inconsistencies. I also list lots of other references so
you know where to look if you’re craving more details about grammar or
usage.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into seven parts:
Part I: Welcome to the Word World
Want to explore the world of publishing without having to break the door
down? Here’s where you get to know the major, minor, and little leagues in
the prettily packaged planet of publishing. You also get the lowdown on the
processes of bookmaking — the editing, production, and manufacturing steps
that bump the book from conception to completion. But what if books aren’t
your professional destination? No problem. I also discuss other ways to turn
your passion for words into a full-time or freelance salary, from working on
magazines to creating corporate documents to cleaning up the information
superhighway.
Part II: Conquering Copyediting
In this part, I escort you through the gates of copyediting. I explain what
copyeditors do all day and how they get it done, and I discuss the nuances of
perfecting copy. You also find valuable sample sections to review so you can
see copyediting techniques in action.
Part III: Picking Up a Proofreading Career
This part offers the 4-1-1 on proofreading. I know you’re already a great
reader, but here I ask you to reconsider your approach so you can pick out all
the things a proofreader looks for. You get a crash course in the hieroglyphics
better known as proofreaders’ marks and two chapters’ worth of opportuni-
ties to see proofreading in action.

Introduction

Part IV: Adding to Your Repertoire
Whether you want to copyedit or proofread, you need to be able to quickly
identify punctuation and usage errors. I begin this part by reviewing punctua-
tion use and highlighting some of the most commonly misspelled and mis-
used words. Next, I offer a chapter on the anatomy of a book and magazine so
you speak with authority about front matter, back matter, and all the matters
in between.
I also show you how to balance rules against style and make informed judg-
ment calls, and I explain what a style sheet is and how to use it. One of the
most important chapters in the book appears here as well: one that explains
how to copyedit and proofread electronic documents. (Even if your computer
skills won’t earn you bragging rights, you want to add this knowledge to your
repository so you don’t miss out on valuable job opportunities.)
Part V: Turning Your Skills into Paychecks
Here’s where you get the scoop on how to hunt for full-time or freelance
work. If freelancing is your goal, you can read success stories from the people
who are at the top of this profession, find out how to land your first paying
gig, and discover how to make that first opportunity translate into a steady
stream of work.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
If you’re looking for quick advice on how to make yourself stand out as a
copyeditor or proofreader, this is the part for you. I offer ten tips for succeed-
ing in each field.
Part VII: Appendixes
This part may make your life a bit easier: It contains three handy guides that
you can use as references. First, I present a list of the most commonly mis-
spelled words you’ll see while reading. Next, you find a glossary of terms you
can use while navigating the book or magazine publishing world. Finally, I
offer a list of online resources to use for checking facts, improving your skills,
or chatting with people who share your love for words.

Icons Used in This Book
To keep things around here neat and tidy, I’ve marked some paragraphs of
this book with the following icons:
This icon indicates something that you want to keep in mind for a later time.
The information may be something you’re already aware of, but even so, tuck
it away for future use because it’s something that I think could make the dif-
ference between doing okay at copyediting and proofreading and doing some
serious cranking.
This icon indicates something that I’ve found to be particularly useful in my
career as a copyeditor and proofreader. Think of these little nuggets as tricks
of the trade.
I don’t use this one often — try to accentuate the positive whenever possible,
right? But if I want you to avoid making a mistake that could cause some seri-
ous friction with your boss, client, or author, I highlight the suggestion with
this explosive icon.
Where to Go from Here
Figuring out copyediting and proofreading is all about taking the leap and
giving it the old college try (no matter how poor your skills may be at first).
If you find that you are more interested in one part of this book than another,
and you want to start there, go for it. There’s no reason to read each page in
succession from cover to cover. By all means skip around and find the sec-
tions that are most useful to you. When you hit the ones that are closest to
your heart, I have every confidence that you’ll laugh, you’ll cry, you’ll wax
grammatical.

Copyediting & Proofreading For Dummies 

Part I
Welcome to the
Word World

In this part . . .
I
help you get a general sense of what these folks called
copyeditors and proofreaders do and where they do 
it. That way, as you prepare to join their ranks, you can
develop a pretty clear picture of what your work life may
look like.
You may know a lot more about copyediting and proof-
reading than you think. Don’t agree? Flip to Chapter 1.
I bet you’ll be totally impresed with yourself. Er, make
that impressed. In Chapter 2, I explore the world of book
publishing, in case that’s the type of job you’re aiming to
get. If it isn’t, you may want to jump right to Chapter 3,
where I touch on some of the other job opportunities
available.

Chapter 1
Reading as a Job? Oh, Yes
In This Chapter
 Recognizing your qualifications to proofread and copyedit
 Setting aside some outdated images
 Discovering some truths about copyediting and proofreading
 Considering which career path to pursue
S
o you picked up this book to discover how to become a copyeditor or
proofreader? I’ve got some news: You’re probably already pretty good at
it. You’ve been training for this career path since you first picked up A B C
blocks in nursery school. Let me guess: You’re the person everyone begs to
review their résumés . . . college applications . . . term papers . . . doctoral
theses.
Any time you improve upon someone else’s writing, you take on the tasks of a
copyeditor or proofreader. If you share your skills, helping people by word-
smithing for them and providing them with a better finished product, you’re
already working in this field. The question is, are you getting paid for it? If
not, I offer lots of advice in this book for turning your skills into paychecks.
But let’s not put the cart before the horse. Here’s a little (true) tale for you.
I was bursting with pride when my friend Kevin called me on my lunch break
many years ago. I had just landed my first freelance proofreading job through
a temp agency, and my head was awash with the possibilities that lay ahead
of me: an extra paycheck, potentially interesting material I could read in my
spare time, and a flexible schedule that would allow me to have a social life.
I told Kevin all about the job, adding that I had just proofread a piece for a
major advertising firm.
“That’s scary,” he said.

I tried to reassure Kevin. “It’s not scary at all. You just have to read a little
more slowly than normal and keep in mind . . .”
“Actually,” he interrupted, “I don’t mean scary that way. I mean that, here’s
this big agency that feels it’s so important that whatever-it-is-they-sent-you is
correct, they don’t trust their own people with it. So they decide it’s worth it
to pay an ‘expert’ to proof it for them . . . and then it goes to you, who always
misspells my last name. That’s scary.”
Hm. For a moment, I agreed with him.
But what I didn’t know then was that almost all proofreaders start out as I 
did — with little more than an interest in reading, access to a dictionary, and
a few short lessons on style, grammar, and how to make proofer’s marks. 
See, I didn’t have to be a phenomenal speller; I just had to be able to look up
words I was unfamiliar with. If I was unsure about grammar, I just had to
know which reference guide to check. (And in all fairness, that guy’s last
name was really hard to spell. It had, like, four consonants in a row.)
It soon became clear to me that I was doing just fine. And looking back, I real-
ize that I did so without the kind of guidance I include in this book. So if you
take nothing else away from reading this text (which I sincerely hope isn’t the
case), know that you are indeed qualified to review the writing of others. And
believe me, the more you do it, the better (and faster) you will be.
As for me, knowing that I can impart information to you that will put you way
ahead of where I was when I began my proofreading career makes me so
proud I could pretty much, well, burst.
Debunking Some Myths
Maybe you’re carrying around some archaic images in your skull about what
copyediting and proofreading entail. If you assume that taking this career
path means you’ll be wearing nerdy glasses while forever flipping through
dusty grammar tomes and making nice white sheets of paper bleed with the
markings from your red or blue pencil, think again. The resources you turn to
for advice on grammar, spelling, and usage are just as likely to be Web sites
as reference books. (See the resource listings in Chapter 14 and Appendix C if
you want proof.) And depending on your employer, you may make all your
contributions via keyboard instead of red or blue pencil (as I discuss in detail
in Chapter 17).
So put your nerdy glasses away (unless you really like them, in which case,
who am I to judge?). The world of professional words is full of infectiously
cool creative types — writers, editors, designers, and artists. We’re movers
10
Part I: Welcome to the Word World 

and shakers with creative ideas and (almost always) a true love of reading,
which means we’re pretty fascinating to talk to at parties.
Here are some other myths to strike:
 Copyeditors and proofreaders have to be students of literature and
English, classically trained by Ivy League professors. Even if there
were a million bucks in it for me, I don’t think I could diagram a sen-
tence. And reciting Shakespeare? Let’s just say my exposure to good ol’
William has more to do with Kenneth Branagh than I care to admit.
Really. Or, um, verily.
You don’t need to know every nuance of the English language to be a
copyeditor or proofreader. It helps to be an avid reader, but it doesn’t
matter if you fall asleep at night reading Norton anthologies or copies of
Sports Illustrated.
 If you read for money, you’ll never enjoy reading again. The running
joke among copyeditors is that if anyone ever buys us a book, there
better be some cash tucked into the table of contents or we’re not going
to bother reading it.
For me, it’s definitely a bonus that nowadays most of what I read is on
someone else’s dime. Still, there’s no better thrill than putting my feet
up and settling into a suspense thriller — without having to scour for
errors. Chefs still enjoy tasty meals. Lifeguards still enjoy swimming.
I still enjoy reading.
If reading is pleasurable to you now, it always will be. And I encourage
you to pursue jobs that allow you to read the types of materials you find
most interesting; don’t assume that in order to preserve your love for
romance novels you’d better focus your professional efforts on scientific
journals, for example. Stick with your passions, and chances are that
you’ll be inspired to do great work (which will lead to you getting even
more jobs). See Chapters 2 and 3 for some ideas of how to fine-tune your
career goals.
 All that reading will destroy your eyes and your back. If you choose to
copyedit or proofread, you won’t be reading in the dim confines of a
monastic cave. You’ll be reading the way you normally do — as if you’re
perusing the morning newspaper or your favorite Web site. The differ-
ence is that you’ll be a bit more focused on the content.
In Chapter 17, I offer lots of tips for keeping your eyes, back, and other
parts healthy while doing these jobs. The harder part is keeping your
brain from experiencing overload while you process hundreds of bits of
information on each page!
11
Chapter 1: Reading as a Job? Oh, Yes

Getting a True Picture of the Professions
So copyediting and proofreading don’t require an Ivy League degree, won’t
destroy your love of reading, and shouldn’t cause your body to deteriorate.
In place of these myths, allow me to offer some truths that may help you
develop a better idea of what to expect from either profession:
 You can’t pick copyeditors or proofreaders out of a crowd. They’re
people just like you and me. Some are full-time wordsmiths, and some
are stay-at-home moms and dads fitting jobs in between the kids’ naps.
(If you’re the stay-at-home type, be sure to check out Chapters 19 and 20
for tips on constructing a freelance career.) Some make copyediting or
proofreading their sole profession, and some use their language skills to
supplement an unsteady (or steadily low) income.
If there’s one thing that is true about copyeditors and proofreaders
across the board, it’s that they are all fantastically beautiful and charm-
ing. And funny.
 Opportunities abound. As literacy rates and the global population grow,
so grow the markets for proofreaders and copyeditors. If the job oppor-
tunities available in the United States aren’t quite vast enough, you can
always market yourself to firms in countries with significant English-
speaking populations. A lot of people across the globe speak English as
their first language. (I could tell you how many today, but that popula-
tion explosion would keep proving me wrong.)
Here’s another reason you should have no trouble finding work as a
copyeditor or proofreader: the World Wide Web. Before the Web came
along, there were already lots of words being printed every day that
needed to be copyedited and proofread. But with Web content thrown
into that mix of (constantly changing) written communication, the possi-
bilities for someone with your skills are limitless. Who knows? You could
become the official copyeditor or proofreader of a Web site just by spot-
ting an error and sending a friendly e-mail with your résumé attached
(see Chapter 3 for ideas).
 You get a paid education from either profession. Tell me if this advice
sounds familiar: “Get a good education so you can get a good job!” That
was my dad, the proponent of higher education. Well, we editorial types
have good jobs that give us great educations.
My job as a copyeditor and proofreader is to get educated — oftentimes,
with information I never would have happened upon in a library or
bookstore. Whether you want to work with books, newspapers, Web
sites, magazines, corporate reports, advertising copy, or bubblegum
wrappers, I can pretty much promise that you’ll be introduced to infor-
mation you never knew existed.
12
Part I: Welcome to the Word World 

 Your career can be as mobile as you need it to be. If you’re looking for
full-time employment that comes with an office (or at least a cubby),
mobility may not matter much to you. But if you’re given to roam, you’re
considering the right professions.
Copyediting and proofreading can be done from anywhere in the world.
If you freelance, or if you work for a company that allows telecommuting,
you can work from your bedroom, on an airplane, or at the beach —
no one will care as long as the job gets done well and on time. To make
this happen, you may need to invest in a quality laptop computer; see
Chapter 17 for my thoughts about what to look for in that piece of essen-
tial equipment.
Even if mobility isn’t your key concern right now, the skills you develop
as a copyeditor or proofreader can help you get work wherever you may
wander during your lifetime. These days, few of us stay put for decades
on end, so investing the effort in a career with this kind of portability
makes a whole lot of sense.
 Your hours can be as flexible as you need them to be. Again, you may
prefer (or need) a full-time schedule that comes equipped with health
benefits and the other perks of a salaried position. But if you prefer
(or need) a flexible work schedule, you definitely want to check out
Chapters 19 and 20 where I discuss how to build a freelance career.
How flexible is flexible? Well, it’s 1:22 a.m. right now, and my home office
(which happens to be a few steps from my bed) is open. As a freelancer,
you can copyedit or proofread at 9 a.m. or 3 a.m. — the person giving
you the assignment doesn’t care as long as you meet the deadline.
And another key perk of this flexibility is that you can say yes to as
many or as few jobs as you can handle at any one time. If you’ve got
other obligations that will demand a great deal of time in certain weeks
or months, you have complete freedom to keep your copyediting or
proofreading schedule clear during that time period. As long as you
deliver quality work (on time), your contacts should be happy to hear
from you when your schedule lightens and you’re available to accept
assignments again.
 If writing is your ultimate goal, copyediting and proofreading can carry
you closer to it. Reading published work — or about-to-be-published
work — can help you develop your own writing skills. Obviously, you
could just read these pieces on your own and gain the same benefits.
But why not get paid to do so? Besides, as I explain in Chapters 4 and 8,
the process of copyediting or proofreading requires digesting text in
ways that are atypical of a pleasure read. When you’re hired to help
make a publication as perfect as it can be, you pay some serious atten-
tion to every word on the page.
13
Chapter 1: Reading as a Job? Oh, Yes

And if the on-the-job writing education isn’t enough of a perk, the net-
working opportunities are another selling point. I wouldn’t encourage
you to try to sell yourself as a writer as soon as you finish the first proof-
reading job for a new employer, but over time, as you prove how adept
you are at wielding a pronoun, you may be able to identify writing
opportunities that fit your skills.
 You’ll have lots of fun stuff to talk about at your next class reunion.
When you bump into an old acquaintance and he asks what you’ve been
up to, won’t it be fun to rattle off the latest books, magazines, or Web
sites you’ve worked on? This line of work makes for good conversation.
Don’t be surprised if people ask you how they can get into it too.
So . . . Are You a Copyeditor 
or Proofreader?
Even a trained eye can mistake a copyeditor for a proofreader or a proof-
reader for a copyeditor — they know the same marks, they carry the same
tools, and they even kinda look the same. What’s the difference, then?
Distinguishing between the two
The skills that a proofreader needs are probably the same ones that led you
to pick up this book. You’re the person who can’t keep from crying out at
errant apostrophes, right? And I think I heard your scream in the Italian
restaurant a few weeks back — something along the lines of “How could they
forget the h in spaghetti, for heaven’s sake!” And then there’s that pesky issue
of which witch is which. Nobody gets that right but you. A proofreader exam-
ines text, discovers what’s wrong, and fixes it.
A copyeditor is like a proofreader who has gone to grad school. Well,
metaphorical grad school.
Here’s the simplest difference between the two positions: The copyeditor
gets his mitts on the text first. That’s because he has responsibilities that go
beyond the proofreader’s. He pays close attention to grammar, punctuation,
usage, and spelling, of course, but he also is charged with ensuring the con-
sistency of voice, chronology, and fact. Plus, he checks every fact, every
name, every Web site referenced to make sure the reader is getting accurate
information. And he keeps meticulous notes the whole time (in a document
called the style sheet, which I discuss in detail in Chapter 15) so he can make
sure that the writing on page 203 reflects the same decisions as the writing
on page 14.
14
Part I: Welcome to the Word World 

Yup, good writing requires making a lot of decisions. Writers make them, 
publishers make them, production editors (whom I introduce in Chapter 2)
make them, and copyeditors usually get to make them too. (At the very 
least, copyeditors can query authors and editors — ask questions and 
make suggestions — to highlight potential problems and suggest solutions. 
I spend some quality time discussing the fine art of the query in Chapter 4.)
Proofreaders generally don’t make a lot of decisions; their job is to make sure
that every decision documented on a style sheet (or in a publisher’s house
style documentation — see Chapter 14) is implemented on every page of the
document.
Choosing where to focus your energies
I began as a proofreader, so it’s my humble opinion that the best path is the
one that starts at proofreading. If you’re getting into these fields because you
adore reading, proofreading gives you exactly what you want: the chance to
cozy up with (you hope) good writing and help to make it even better. Plus,
you get to examine exactly what the copyeditor did before you got the text.
If you’re observant (and I know you are), you can pick up a lot of new skills
that way and prepare for a future career in copyediting, if that’s your goal.
But hey, if copyediting is where you want to begin, don’t let me stop you.
Maybe you’d go mad if you couldn’t influence the bigger picture of how a
book or article or annual report is put together. Maybe you’ve already had
enough proofreading experience (paid or unpaid) to know that you’re ready
to dig deeper into how writing is crafted.
Want some really great news? If you want to do both jobs, you can. You may
have a slightly harder time doing so in a full-time position than in a freelance
capacity, but the possibility exists either way. For full-time work, you may
want to focus your search on smaller organizations whose staff members
may be expected to fill multiple functions during the publishing process. If
freelancing is your aim, the only person who decides whether you accept a
proofreading job or a copyediting job is you.
Whichever path you choose to start down, I offer lots of info in Parts II and III
of this book to get you going. And I strongly encourage you to read chapters
in both parts even if you’re confident that you’re going to search for only one
type of job. If copyediting is your thing, you definitely need to know proof-
reading marks and the types of errors you’ll be correcting — information I
detail in Part III. And if proofreading is your destination, you can certainly
benefit from understanding what a copyeditor does. (The more you under-
stand about that job, the better the chance that you’ll avoid overstepping
your bounds by questioning decisions made before you get the text.)
15
Chapter 1: Reading as a Job? Oh, Yes

Preparing to Invest Yourself
This is a reference book. I don’t expect that you’ll read every word (I know,
you’re not proofreading it); I do expect that you’ll turn back to certain chap-
ters and the appendixes as you begin to establish yourself in the publishing
world.
Here’s something else I expect: When you get a copyediting or proofreading
job (or multiple jobs, if you’re freelancing), you’ll discover that your
employer does things just a bit differently than what I describe here. Maybe
even a lot differently. The challenge of writing a book like this is that I can’t
possibly prepare you for every scenario; you have to do the work of adapting
the information I offer to your specific work situation.
If you’re looking for a hard-and-fast truth about copyediting and proofreading
that won’t change from job to job, here it is: To succeed in these professions,
you must be persistent and patient. When you’re searching for work, persis-
tence and patience definitely pay off; you can’t let rejections deter you from
your goal. And when you’re on the job, those attributes are crucial as well.
I’d like to promise that when you start getting paid to copyedit or proofread
you’ll never again have to work on documents as horrid as your college
roommate’s term papers. But I can’t make that promise. Once in a while
(I hope not too often), you’re bound to find yourself staring at a manuscript
or computer screen filled with text that makes absolutely no sense — and not
because it’s tackling a subject like quantum physics. The good news is that,
as a copyeditor or proofreader, your job isn’t to rewrite that gobbledygook.
Your job is to politely point out its deficiencies (see Chapter 4 for wording
suggestions) and nudge it as far toward publishable status as you can.
In this scenario, persistence and patience will see you through. Your best
option is to try to wow the person who hired you by identifying (and, if possi-
ble, correcting) as many errors and sources of confusion as possible. If you
can accomplish that while working on a truly problematic piece, I can say
with confidence that you’ll be rewarded with much more fun assignments as
time goes by.

I
’m betting you wouldn’t drive from Rochester to San Diego without check-
ing your map (assuming, of course, that you are not my father). For such a
trip, you’d probably note your overall direction, choose the highways to take
(or let an online mapping program do it for you), get a sense of what cities
you’ll pass through, and maybe even scope out a few possible places to sight-
see or find lodging for the night. You want to know more than your destina-
tion; you want to know what’s just beyond the next bend as well.
Likewise, if you’re a person who’s loaded up, strapped in, revving the engine,
and destined to work in the publishing industry, you’re probably curious
about what comes next. The road ahead is dotted with publishing prospects.
In this chapter and the next, I help you map them out.
I have a hunch that you may be most interested in copyediting or proofread-
ing books. (If I’m wrong, feel free to go directly to Chapter 3, where I talk
about lots of other opportunities available to you.) In this chapter, I give you
ideas for getting starting on that path. For copyeditors and proofreaders,
book publishing is a great industry to focus on. It can provide not only steady
work but also defined standards to follow as you go about your business.
Most book publishers have style guides chock-full of details you need to
apply to the copy you’re reading — things like whether the house uses serial
commas or how to hyphenate compound modifiers and other stuff to satisfy
your word-nerd heart.
In some ways, the explosion of technology and mega-media ownership has
made the publishing industry easier to navigate than before. But it’s still a
place of bewildering stages of approvals and rejections, agents and editors,
and politics and polishings to get from the writer’s brain to the book’s bind-
ing. If you’ll allow me room to wave my wand, I’ll do my best to break down
the bewilderment.

Becoming a Professional Bookworm
If books are your destination, one of the best first steps you can take is to get
familiar with various publishing houses and their specialties. Your goal is to
find out who publishes what and then zero in on the type of stuff you’re inter-
ested in reading.
Browsing the shelves
Field trip time!
Here’s a field trip you can go on without even putting on your shoes: Go to
the bookshelves of your personal library, and take a look-see at the spines of
what’s there. See a Penguin or an Oxford? How about a Vintage or a Faber &
Faber? You’ll probably pick up on a theme — you’ll see that the same publish-
ers keep popping up. Well, that’s a pretty good indication of the publishers
you want to focus on working with in the future.
Okay, now pull on a backpack (and some shoes) and walk to your local book-
store. Spend some time wandering through the aisles, maybe even traipsing
to those far-reaching sections you never darken with your presence. Like chil-
dren’s books? Pick up your favorite, flip to the copyright page, and take note
of the publisher’s contact info. Enjoy New Age novels? Get a feel for who the
major publishers are, and move in that direction when making your contacts.
As soon as you start identifying publishers of material you enjoy, jot down
their contact information. That way, when you begin job hunting (see
Chapter 18), you already have company names and addresses on hand.
Eyeing imprints
Book publishing is an industry that offers plenty of in-house copyediting and
proofreading jobs — and it’s prolific in offering those of the freelance variety.
Like any other industry, it has gone through a number of consolidations in
recent years, resulting in but a handful of conglomerate houses publishing
the bulk of the novels and nonfiction marvels read each day. I can’t tell you
if that’s great for the publishing industry, but it’s great for you. Here’s why:
You could conceivably work within one publishing house and hit every fiction
genre and nonfiction subject area through its imprints.
What are imprints? Imprints are ways for publishing houses to market specific
groups (or, in the biz, lines) of books to specific segments of the population.
For example, Random House’s Knopf imprint is known for high-end writers
with a literary bent. Vintage, part of the Knopf division, is the paperback
imprint. Another Random House imprint, Doubleday, does more commercial
18
Part I: Welcome to the Word World 

work, and one of its paperback imprints is Bantam. Imprints are like neigh-
borhoods that have their own character; the publishing house is the city that
comprises all the neighborhoods.
Usually, imprints have their own look and feel (the biz lingo is branding). For
instance, the Rough Guide imprint owned by Pearson publishes travel guides
for lower-budget travelers, and the logo appears on everything from books to
maps to phrase books and more. This branding lets a reader know the type of
information, language, and style that can be expected, even before picking up
a particular book.
The great thing about imprints is that many are housed within the same
building of a particular publisher. After you’ve got a foot into one imprint,
you’ve got at least a toe or two in the door of a sister imprint as well.
Getting to know the major publishers
So who are these publishing conglomerates? There are really only six major
publishers these days, each housing the many divisions and imprints that
make up the book industry. Gather ’round for the breakdown:
 Bertelsmann AG: Anchor, Ballantine, Bantam, Broadway Books, Crown,
Dell, Dial, Doubleday, Fodor’s, Golden Books, Knopf, Modern Library,
Pantheon, Random House, Vintage, and others
 Hachette Book Group USA (until recently Time Warner Book Group):
Bulfinch Press; FaithWords; Little, Brown and Company; Springboard
Press; Warner Books; and others
 Holtzbrinck: Faber & Faber; Farrar, Straus & Giroux; Henry Holt; Let’s
Go; Macmillan; Metropolitan; North Point Press; Owl; St. Martin’s Press;
Times Books; and others
 News Corp.: Access Travel, Amistad, Avon, Ecco, Cliff Street,
HarperCollins, HarperCollins Children’s Books, Harper Perennial,
William Morrow, and more
 Pearson: Addison-Wesley; Berkley; DK Publishing; Dutton, Grosset &
Dunlap; Ladybird; Longman; Peachpit; Penguin; Penguin Putnam Young
Readers; Plume; Prentice Hall; Puffin; Rough Guides; Viking; and others
 Viacom: Archway, Free Press, Kaplan, Pocket, Scribner, Simon &
Schuster, Touchstone, and others
These are the mainstream mainstays who publish more than 100 titles per
year. And this is all-important to you because this key piece of information —
how many titles are published each year — helps you determine the heavy
hitters who will need you (and many others like you) to copyedit and proof-
read everything that’s produced. The production editors at these publishers
are your no-brainer starting points.
19

Just because a certain publisher doesn’t appear on this list doesn’t mean you
can’t find work there. For example, I haven’t included John Wiley & Sons in
the list, and that’s the company responsible for the words you’re reading
right now. Consider all the publishers who interest you, and check how many
books they publish a year. If your chances of finding work look good, go for it.
Writer’s Market (F&W Publications, Inc.) is the industry bible containing
names, addresses, phone and fax numbers, and Web sites for every book,
magazine, and trade journal publisher you could possibly want to know more
about. (To find out how many books a publisher produces each year, this is
your go-to resource.) In Chapter 18, I show you how to use Writer’s Market as
a job-hunting tool. For now, know this: If you want to work in book publishing,
you need to have access to this book. Buy it, borrow it, or pay a subscription
fee to access it online at www.writersmarket.com.
Another goldmine of a resource is the Literary Market Place (Information
Today). This tome, produced for domestic as well as overseas publishers,
covers books, magazines, and newspapers. It is a yearly publication about
the size of a phone book. You can find it in the reference section of your local
bookstore or library.
Working with the specialists
No, I’m not talking about specialists who don lab coats and sprinkle finger-
print powder. Specialists are niche-market houses, academic publishers, 
and others. They also represent another career path for copyeditors and
proofreaders.
Working at a university press is an interesting way to gain access to what’s
being discussed at the academic level. New poets and literary trends, recent
research in the arts and sciences, studies in the geographical areas of the uni-
versities themselves — the books produced by university presses are often
fascinating scholarly works written by experts in the field. If you love Wallace
Stevens, you just may be able to edit somebody’s academic thesis on his works!
Some of the bigger university presses include Cambridge University Press,
Columbia University Press, MIT Press, New York University Press, University
of California Press, University of Chicago Press, and Oxford University Press.
Your handy Writer’s Market includes these presses and more. Take a gander at
the number of titles they publish annually so you have a clue as to the size
and viability of each university press.
For each publisher listing in Writer’s Market, there’s a rundown of the subject
areas in which the publisher specializes. Take a look at them, and contact
publishers that match your own areas of interest. All that time you spent in
school may give you an advantage within a specific field (unless you focused
a bit too much on the underwater basket-weaving).

There are enough niches in book publishing for just about anybody to get
published. Religion can include reads for Christians, Jews, Wiccans, and fol-
lows of Zoroaster. Romance encompasses books for the gay and lesbian com-
munities, the religious communities, and the . . . ahem, slightly naughtier
communities. Whatever you’re interested in, you’ll find something to explore
in the recesses of any topic.
Some publishers produce few enough materials each year to actually count
on your digits — maybe on one hand. What’s great about them? Nobody’s
calling every minute of the day for a job. And if they’re located in your home-
town, you can slip in for a day or a week, maybe even take a project home,
getting a good foot in the door and a few lines on your résumé. Hometown
beginnings need not be so humble!
Vanity, thy name is . . .
Everybody has a book she wants to get into the grubbies of publishers, and a
venue exists to meet that demand: subsidy presses. Through the average
publishing process, an author submits a proposal or sample chapters to a lit-
erary agent or acquisitions editor, crossing her fingers that it will be chosen
for publication. If the manuscript is chosen, the publisher pays an advance to
the author and negotiates a contract that includes (one hopes) paying out
royalties on the work.
In contrast, any Tom, Dick, or Mary can publish a work with a subsidy press.
In fact, subsidy presses pretty much rely on authors for business, charging a
writer a fee in return for publishing his books. (By the way, subsidy presses
are also known as vanity presses.)
You will not find subsidy presses in your handy-dandy Writer’s Market. A
better place to look is in the back of publishing magazines, where subsidy
presses often advertise. What are these publishing magazines? There’s
Publishers Weekly, Writer’s Digest, Writers’ Journal, and Poets & Writers, for
starters.
Some of the better-known subsidy presses include the following:
 AuthorHouse: www.authorhouse.com
 BookSurge: www.booksurge.com
 Dorrance Publishing Company, Inc.: www.dorrancepublishing.com
 Infinity Publishing: www.infinitypublishing.com
 iUniverse: www.iuniverse.com
 Ivy House: www.ivyhousebooks.com
21

 Melrose Press: www.melrosepress.co.uk
 Vantage Press: www.vantagepress.com
 Watermark Press: www.watermarkpress.com
 Xlibris: www.xlibris.com
Subsidy presses can be a great place to begin your copyediting or proofread-
ing career, what with the amount of published material that goes through
them. Plus, their quality control is not as stringent as it is at a major press,
so they’re more likely to forgive your fledgling errors. (I know you never make
them, but . . .) However, subsidy-press budgets tend to be pretty tight, so
don’t expect bells-and-whistles treatment. And I’ll whisper this: Some of the
books can be downright dreadful. Just a word of warning.
Making a Book
In recent years, some publishing houses have grown so vast that they now
house specialized honeycombs of busily buzzing bees. In addition to the
dizzying publishing divisions for fiction, nonfiction, music, academic, ad nau-
seam, the hive of a publishing house also contains distinct editorial, publish-
ing, sales, and marketing departments.
If you become a copyeditor or proofreader for one of these publishers, you
will be one bee — albeit a very important one — in a honeycomb of a very
large hive. You don’t need to be familiar with every stage in the book-
publishing process, but it doesn’t hurt to know how that industry functions.
The movers, shakers, and machines that move a typewritten manuscript to a
beautifully bound book (or a fully accessible Web site) are part of something
known as the production process. Production can be further broken down into
the editorial stages, the production stages, and the manufacturing stages, each
with their own actors. In the sections that follow, I walk you through a typical
process at one of the big publishing houses. There are always exceptions, how-
ever, so don’t be surprised if things work differently at some companies.
The editorial stages: Acquiring a book
Think of the editorial stages as everything that takes place before a book can
be considered ready for polishing and publication.
Meeting the people
I’ll start by introducing who’s who on the editorial side of the business:
22
Part I: Welcome to the Word World 

 Editor-in-chief: Oversees the editorial direction and related policies of
the imprint or publishing house, including content, style, budgets, and
the editorial staff.
 Acquisitions editor: Works with the editor-in-chief to acquire content
and make decisions about upcoming title lists. The role varies from pub-
lisher to publisher: This person can have the actual title acquisitions
editor or can be called an editor, senior editor, or executive editor depend-
ing on seniority and on how much staff and list management responsibil-
ity the position carries. Some acquisitions editors are heavily involved
in editing, and others do the acquiring and then assign the actual editing
to a more junior editor.
 Associate editor (or editorial project manager): Works with the acquisi-
tions editor in preparing manuscripts for production. This person works
directly with the author and is the acquisitions editor’s right-hand guy
or gal. An associate editor will begin to acquire books as well.
 Assistant editor: Handles some of the more mundane (but absolutely
crucial) editorial and administrative tasks, such as researching compet-
ing titles, logging and doing reader’s reports on submissions, logging
contracts and royalty statements, and writing copy for sales sheets.
 Developmental editor: Sometimes works with the acquisitions editor
and author to help the author further develop a manuscript. This person
may actually play the role of the author if the author cannot do the rec-
ommended or necessary rewrites.
Not every editorial department has each of these editors on staff, and not all
positions are needed for each book. A developmental editor, for example, is
only called upon for certain situations. Position titles can also vary between
publishing houses.
Why isn’t the copyeditor on this list? The copyeditor is part of the team of
people who polish a manuscript, as I discuss in the upcoming sections on the
production process.
Proposing a project
Usually, everything starts with the author — or, more accurately, the author’s
agent. Sometimes a publishing house contacts an author to write a book, but
that’s not the norm; it happens most often with people who have name recog-
nition. The majority of manuscripts come to a publisher unsolicited, and
these can be divided into ones that are submitted through a literary agent
(which gives them a better chance of being noticed) and ones that come in
directly from an author over the transom (which gives them a slim chance of
being noticed).
23
Chapter 2: Jobs for Bookworms

An agent submits a manuscript on behalf of an author to several publishing
houses. A good agent plays matchmaker, pitching a manuscript to editors
and publishers that he thinks make the best potential mates. If the author has
a strong hook — for example, she’s well known and brings a built-in audience
with her — the agent may be able to submit only a query letter or book pro-
posal containing a book outline or table of contents; an introduction; and a
completed sample chapter, often the opening chapter of the book.
And what about those unagented submissions, and even submissions from
agents that the editor doesn’t know? If they’re kept at all (and often they
aren’t), they go into what’s called a slush pile — a reserve of manuscripts and
proposals that sit until an assistant editor gets around to looking through
them when it’s a light week for submissions. Published winners do get pulled
from the slush pile, but it doesn’t happen very often.
Assessing the proposal
Who are these acquisitions editors? They’re the people at a publishing 
company who help create headline news. Thanks to acquisitions editors,
Anderson Cooper sold his memoir to HarperCollins for $1 million, and Oprah
raised eyebrows with her cool $12 million book deal.
Because publishing a book is an expensive endeavor, the acquisitions editor
holds a book proposal closely to the light, assessing the entire package of
information to determine whether the subject matter is appropriate for the
publishing house or imprint. If the proposal passes muster, the acquisitions
editor works with the author to fine-tune and better complete it for easier
acceptance by the publishing house. Sometimes a developmental editor is
called in to help the author at this stage.
Going through committee review
Next, an internal editorial committee or board usually receives the proposal.
The acquisitions editor meets with the committee and makes the case for
acceptance of the manuscript by the publishing house. If the committee
agrees and decides to take on the manuscript, the acquisitions editor pushes
the proposal along to another internal — and sometimes external — group of
people who further scrutinize the subject matter and outline for any holes in
the research that need to be fixed before a book deal can be penned. For aca-
demic works, it’s not uncommon for additional peer-review panels of experts
in the field of the book’s topic to be brought together for suggestions and
comments. All these hands, and we’ve just scratched the surface!
The acquisitions editor then takes the manhandled proposal back to the
author, who addresses and incorporates the suggestions and changes and
submits a final book proposal.
24
Part I: Welcome to the Word World 

Generating a contract, at last!
Finally, the publisher creates a contract with the author to acquire and pub-
lish the book. The contract includes a summary of the book and a delivery
date of the manuscript from the author to the publishing house. At this point,
the author can officially consider the book acquired and start blocking off his
calendar for all-night writing or revising sessions.
Revising the manuscript
After a book is acquired, an acquisitions editor may assist the writer in
reworking the flow of the book, the table of contents, the characters’ voices,
and so on. Then, the author does her job, creating a manuscript that meets
the publisher’s expectations.
But let’s be clear: The author is never set free to work completely on her
own. The creation of a manuscript is a collaborative process. The editor (usu-
ally the one who acquired the project) edits the manuscript line by line and
discusses queries and suggestions with the author, who works on the text
and sends it back. The two of them may tackle the entire manuscript at once
or work on it piece by piece. Together, they create a manuscript that is ready
for production.
The production stages: Polishing 
a manuscript
After the manuscript is received from the author — either in pieces or com-
plete — things rapidly begin moving through the production process.
Meeting the people
Let’s run through the key players in the production process:
 Production manager or director: Deals with printers and manufacturing
costs, liaising with the acquisitions editor and the managing editor
 Managing editor: Assigns projects to the production editors and over-
sees the schedule for the movement of all elements of all books through
the production process
 Production editor: Guides a manuscript through all stages from word-
processed file to bound books by hiring a copyeditor (and perhaps a
fact-checker), working with the design team, communicating queries to
the acquisitions editor or author, and doing whatever else is necessary
to get a book into print
 Copyeditor: Works magic on the manuscript to ensure consistency, clar-
ity, accuracy, and adherence with house style
25
Chapter 2: Jobs for Bookworms

 Designer: Works with the acquisitions editor to plan the format of the
book, decide how to lay out the text and graphics on each page, and
choose the fonts for the various page elements
Assigning a production editor
The first step of the production stage is the transmittal of the manuscript
from the acquisitions editor to the managing editor, who assesses the individ-
ual strengths and availabilities of his production editors to choose an editor
for the book. Oftentimes, production editors work on a handful of books
simultaneously.
The production editor is responsible for guiding the word-processed manu-
script through each stage of the production process. The manuscript jumps
to and from the production editor’s desk as it moves through the various
stages, always returning after changes have been made. Some production edi-
tors are little more than glorified traffic cops, while others serve as midwives
who support all stages of labor and delivery.
The production editor first puts her arm around the manuscript’s shoulders
to get more familiar with the book’s content and tone. She may just leaf
through the pages, or she may hunker down to read the entire work and
begin to formulate a game plan: Who will copyedit the book? What level of
edit is needed? What timeframe do we need to get this done in?
The production editor is at the center of everything that happens on the pro-
duction side. She works with every member of the book team (designer,
acquisitions editor, compositor, managing editor, and even the author) to get
the manuscript into print.
This person also identifies elements of the manuscript that will need to be
designed and prepares a list of codes for typecoding. This list is given to the
copyeditor and design team; while a copyeditor is coding the manuscript
(see Chapter 16), the design team is deciding what each coded element will
look like.
Getting a copyeditor (and perhaps a fact-checker) involved
The editorial analysis begins when the production editor hands off the manu-
script to a copyeditor — someone like you! Depending on the size of the pub-
lishing house, the copyeditor may be a staff member or a freelancer brought
in to address all content, grammatical, and stylistic issues in the manuscript.
The copyeditor may query the author for more information, suggest changes
to make the content more understandable by the intended audience, and
smooth awkward sentences or transitions. Although the copyeditor keeps his
26
Part I: Welcome to the Word World 

keen eyes cocked for libelous or slanderous language, an additional fact-
checker may be brought in to confirm or correct any factual details in the
work and to ensure that permissions have been collected for any quotes,
photos, or artwork within the book.
As I note in the previous section, the copyeditor also typecodes the manu-
script for typesetting by inserting codes to identify where each designed ele-
ment occurs (see Chapter 16).
Designing the book
While the manuscript is being copyedited, the production editor contacts a
designer (or design team). With the input of the acquisitions editor and keep-
ing in mind the original book proposal, the production editor and designer
make decisions about what the book will look like. The designer plans the
format of the book, decides how to lay out the text and graphics on each
page, chooses the fonts for the various page elements, and finalizes the cover
designs.
Revising the manuscript (again)
After the copyeditor finishes her work with the manuscript, the production
editor sends it back to the acquisitions editor and author for approval and
any necessary rewriting. The manuscript is also checked against the book
proposal to determine that it reflects everything the author said it would be
way back when he first submitted it.
The manufacturing stages: Creating 
a final product
Finally, we’re ready to turn the manuscript into a book!
Meeting the people
As I’ve done for the editorial and production stages, I want to introduce the
key players in the manufacturing stage:
 Compositor or typesetter: Converts electronic manuscript files into
page proofs that conform to the design specs
 Production editor: Remains integral to the process by sending typeset
pages to the author and one or more proofreaders, compiling revisions,
and forwarding them to the typesetter; sending camera- or print-ready
copy to the printer; and reviewing page proofs and a sample copy of the
bound book
27
Chapter 2: Jobs for Bookworms

 Proofreader: Reviews the typeset pages in search of errors made by the
compositor or missed by the copyeditor
 Printer: Turns camera- or print-ready copy into bound books
Typesetting pages
After the revised manuscript gets the big “okay” from the author, it goes into
what is called prepress. Prepress involves sending the manuscript to a type-
setter, also known as a compositor, who is almost always out of house. The
book’s International Standard Book Number (ISBN) is also obtained at this
stage.
The typesetter transforms the manuscript into typeset pages, or galleys, and
often a limited number of these galleys are bound and sent as samples to
book reviewers. This first version of the book is called the first pass. The first
pass is also sent to the production editor, who sends copies of the galleys to
a proofreader — someone like you!
Proofreading and revising galleys
The proofreader reads the galleys against the author-approved manuscript,
looking for errors either made by the typesetter or not caught by the 
copyeditor — anything from minor spelling snafus and improper word breaks
to widows and orphans (words hanging out by themselves at the top or bottom
of a page or column). The proofreader also makes certain that typeface and
fonts are consistent, illustrations and their corresponding descriptions are
correct, and the table of contents is accurate. This whole process is called
slugging, and while the proofreader does his thing, the author does the same.
All proofread copies are returned to the production editor, who collates all
changes and corrections into a master copy of galleys. The master copy is
then sent back to the typesetter, who generates a second version called the
second pass. This second pass is returned to the production editor who —
gasp! — brings in two proofreaders: one to proofread the slug against the
second pass and one to cold-read the second pass.
Any pages with additional final corrections are sent to the typesetter, until a
complete set of error-free, camera- or print-ready pages is created. A camera-
ready copy is the copy the printer uses to photograph and print the final
book. These days, you more commonly hear the term print-ready because the
final pages are actually electronic files that are sent to the printer along with
clean printouts.
Sending the book to the printer
The production editor, yet again, gets his grubbies on the work. He sends the
camera-ready copy to the printer, along with directions as to the design and
28
Part I: Welcome to the Word World 

other aspects of the book. Before completing the entire print run, the printer
sends a set of page proofs — sometimes called bluelines — back to the pro-
duction editor for final approval. These proofs are either loosely bound or in
separate sheets.
When the book is fully printed, but before it’s bound, the printer may send a
set of F&Gs (a term that stands for folded and gathered pages) to the produc-
tion editor to be sure that no major errors have crept their way in.
After this, the book is finally bound, the cover or jacket is attached, and a
sample copy is sent to the production editor for final approval. Ta-dah! The
only thing left to do is complete the entire print run and send it to the pub-
lisher’s warehouse for distribution. Oh, and promote the heck out of the
thing.
Talking the Talk
In this section, I list some book-publishing terms to keep in mind so you can
communicate like a pro. For even more lingo, check out the glossary in
Appendix B:
 Author’s alteration (AA): An author’s change or other alteration to laid-
out text that is not a printer’s error.
 Bad break (BB): An incorrectly hyphenated word at the end of a
typeset line.
 Bluelines: Also referred to as blues, these are proofs of the final book
that can be supplied as loose pages or can be bound. Bluelines repre-
sent the editor’s last chance to catch any errors before the presses start
rolling.
 Bound book: The finished product, ready to be sold.
 Cold read: The process of reading a piece of copy straight through, with
nothing to compare it against.
 Copy: The actual words of a manuscript.
 F&Gs: A set of galleys that may be sent to the production editor after a
book is fully printed and before it is bound, to make sure no major
errors have crept in.
 First pass: The first set of page proofs that are proofread against the
dead copy. These are nearly always in separate sheets, often blown up
for easier markup.
29
Chapter 2: Jobs for Bookworms

 Foul manuscript: The proof pages of a previous pass that are no longer
used because an updated, corrected set of proofs has been produced.
 Four-color process: The process used to produce the full range of CMYK
(that’s cyan, magenta, yellow, and a key color — black) for a full-color
image.
 Galleys: Another term for a set of page proofs, often reserved for the
first set of proofs that is oversized for easier editing.
 Imprint: A set (or line) of books that usually share a common look 
and feel (or brand) and are marketed to the same segments of the 
population.
 Manuscript: A book in loose pages or an electronic file submitted to a
publishing house for evaluation and/or publication.
 Page proofs: A set of pages that are composed according to the design
specifications for review to ensure that the type is correctly set and that
art and other display elements are correctly placed. Also called galleys
or typeset pages.
 Perfect binding: A binding method for paperback books in which the
folded and gathered signatures are cut and then glued to a cover.
 Printer’s error (PE): An error made by the typesetter or printer in 
production.
 Print-ready: Used to describe electronic files that have final approval for
printing.
 Print run: The number of copies of a publication that are to be printed.
 Proof: A sample of typeset and/or laid-out material that is checked
against an original or earlier version.
 Second pass: The second version of page proofs from a manuscript, with
implemented corrections from the first pass.
 Typeset pages: A set of page proofs, usually loose-leaf, that are com-
posed according to the design specs for review to ensure that the type
is correctly set.

ook publishers aren’t the only companies in need of people passionate
about the written word. There is a whole slew of written material out
there, and it all needs copyeditors and proofreaders. Think about the differ-
ent things you get in the mail, like magazines and journals; and what about
those stacks of form letters and freebie samples? They come from some-
where, and that somewhere — more often than not — has a marketing and
communications department. Plus, consider all the Web sites you visit in a
given week. Someone writes the stuff you read online, which means that
someone (we hope) edits and proofreads it.
In this chapter, we’ll consider what your roadmap may look like if you’re 
destined to be a copyeditor or proofreader but books aren’t your first love.
It’s impossible to detail all the opportunities available to you — the world is
full of writing, and it all needs the type of TLC you can provide — but I cover
some of the biggies here.
Majoring in Magazines
Think about the last time you ran out to your mom ’n’ pop grocery store and
found yourself in the magazine aisle — there were more magazine types and
titles than you could digest in one sitting, right?
There are as many different magazines as there are people, tastes, and
trends. The magazine industry refers to genres such as general interest
(Consumer Reports, Reader’s Digest), fashion and beauty (W, Cosmopolitan),
health and fitness (Self, Men’s Health), business (Fortune, Business Week),
news (Time, Newsweek), and celebrity and entertainment (Us Weekly, Star).

But guess what? These are just the consumer magazines — the ones marketed
to people buying magazines at a mom ’n’ pop grocery store. In addition, there
are trade publications — those marketed to people who work within certain
industries. In the sections that follow, I offer some insights into the two
camps of the magazine world.
Meeting the major consumer 
magazine players
As in the book publishing world (see Chapter 2), mergers and acquisitions
have reduced the number of consumer magazine publishers in recent years.
Following are some of the conglomerates you should get to know:
 Advance Publications, Inc.: Most importantly, Advance owns Condé
Nast, publisher of such magazines as Glamour, GQ, The New Yorker,
Vogue, and Wired. It also owns Fairchild Publications (Jane, W, and
Modern Bride), the Golf Digest Companies (Golf Digest and Golf for
Women, naturally), and Parade Publications (publisher of the news-
magazine insert Parade), among others.
 Hearst Magazines: You’ve definitely heard of the magazines under
Hearst’s belt — titles like Good Housekeeping, Redbook, Marie Claire,
and Seventeen, as well as Town & Country, SmartMoney, and Popular
Mechanics.
 PRIMEDIA: Calling itself “the leading targeted media company in the
United States,” PRIMEDIA publishes nearly 100 branded magazines, 
like Motor Trend, Snowboarder, Surfer, Soap Opera Weekly, and — no 
kidding — Truckin’.
 Time Inc.: Yes, Time Warner gets around. Its hands are in books, cable,
movies, online ventures — and lots of magazines: Time, Life, People, In
Style, Real Simple, Field & Stream, Popular Science, and enough others to
read until you’re blind.
A positive side to these conglomerates? If you freelance, you may be able to
do a little copyediting or proofreading shape-shifting by covering editing
tasks for two or three different titles, after you get your pencil in the door.
(See Chapter 18 for suggestions on how to find work in consumer magazines.)
Riding the trade winds: 
Industry publications
Trade publications or journals — also known as business to business (or B2B,
if you want to impress your friends) publications — are geared toward people
working in specific industries. Trade publications exist to provide expert 
32
Part I: Welcome to the Word World 

coverage in news, case studies, trends, new products, and governmental
issues pertaining to an industry.
Work in manufacturing? There’s a manufacturing-trade publication just for
you. Marketing? Choose from direct marketing, promotional marketing, and
more. Just name an industry, and you can bet there’s a trade magazine that
addresses it — hospitality, aluminum siding, snack food, fertilizer . . . trust
me, you can’t conceive of the number of publications out there.
Understanding the editorial structure
Like consumer magazines, trade publications keep their heads above water
through advertising (see the sidebar “Church and state: Editing and advertis-
ing”). But their editors can take much of the credit, too. Some trade publica-
tions are large, but many are quite small, with one or two editors doing just
about everything:
 Overseeing and directing the focus of the publication
 Conducting research for writing
 Editing articles to maintain house style (if one exists)
 Acting as a liaison between the publication and writers
 Dealing with clients’ marketing or advertising departments
Trade journalism is a fast-growing writing field, so finding writers for these
types of magazines is also a pretty big part of the editor’s life.
Meeting some of the trade publication players
While book and consumer magazine publishers tend to be concentrated in
big cities like New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Boston, Philadelphia, and San
Francisco, trade journal publishers are more widely distributed around the
United States — maybe even in your own backyard.
Most trade journal publishers have Web sites advertising the many indus-
tries in which they publish their many titles. Oftentimes, these Web sites
include the all-important staff lists, mailing addresses, and e-mail contacts
you need when searching for work opportunities. Or you can go to www.
publishingcentral.com and get the deets on every trade publisher you
can handle.
Take a look at the smattering of publishers I list here, and note how many dif-
ferent industries they cover:
 Advanstar Communications (www.advanstar.com): Ah, life sciences,
fashion, and power sports. A lovely cocktail, yes, but these industries
are also the focus of Advanstar, which has offices in such cities as
Cleveland, Santa Ana, Ft. Lauderdale, and London.
33
Chapter 3: Other Publishing Opportunities

 Kalmbach Publishing Co. (www.kalmbach.com): From birds to beads,
Kalmbach publishes hobby and special-interest magazines, all from its
offices in Waukesha, Wisconsin. Be sure to take a look at its online job
listings.
 Meredith Corporation (www.meredith.com): These guys publish Better
Homes and Gardens, sure, but there’s also Successful Farming, WOOD,
and Garden Shed to contend with. Plus American Baby (aw, idn’t dat
cute). They have offices in the usual publishing cities, but there’s also
one in Des Moines, Iowa.
 National Business Media (www.nbm.com): Focusing on awards and
custom gifts, promotional apparel, sign making, and automotive maga-
zines, NBM is located in Broomfield, Colorado. The Web site includes
everything you need to contact editors.
 Target Media Partners (www.targetmediapartners.com): You know
those flimsy classified-ad weeklies you pick up from wire bins at the gro-
cery store? Target Media has its paws all over them. Head to the Web
site and check it out.
Another starting point for finding work in this business is to make a short list
of industries that interest you (or you know something about). Call a business
within each industry, and ask someone in its public relations department
which trade publications the company receives.
Making a magazine
To get a magazine from desk to aisle (or mailbox) requires a well-oiled team
of writers, editors, and proofreaders who, as deadlines draw near, may hardly
have the time to high-five each other in the hallway before another draft
makes its way through the rounds. In this world, deadlines are referred to as
closing dates, and they are the drop-dead dates for the final submission of
advertising materials, copy, and editorials for a specific issue.
Every magazine is different, but as I do with books in Chapter 2, I want to
help you get familiar with the people, processes, and parlance you may
encounter in magazine land.
The people
I’ll start by introducing the editors — and there are lots of editors:
 Editor-in-chief: This person oversees the editorial direction and related
policies of the magazine, including content, style, budgets, and the 
editorial staff. This guy or gal is also the one who writes the monthly 
“ed letter,” usually found in the beginning pages of the magazine.
34
Part I: Welcome to the Word World 

 Managing editor: The managing editor works with the editor-in-chief to
manage staff, inspire content and the layout of an issue, and make deci-
sions as to which pieces will run when. Some writing, editing, and
budget work also fall onto this person’s plate.
 Copy supervisor: Also known as the copy chief, this is the person who
oversees the copyeditors and proofreaders. Often, this position reports
directly to the managing editor.
 Associate editor: The associate editor edits and reads feature articles,
sometimes writing content as well. This person also gives the okay 
to the look and feel of the cover and may be the one blessed with 
representing the magazine at events.
 Staff editor: The staff editor helps the associate editor, sometimes
acting as a go-between with writers and the publication.
 Assistant editor: The assistant editor is the member of the senior 
editorial staff who handles routine work and “front-of-the-book” and
“back-of-the-book” departments. This editor may also be required to
write and edit features of the publication.
 Executive editor: The executive editor is mostly concerned with daily
work — think deadlines, deadlines, deadlines — and also ensures copy
and style quality and compliance.
 Contributing editor: This is an editing or writing contributor who is not
part of the in-house staff. Contributing eds write the articles and later
read them in the magazine, sometimes not even resembling their original
versions.
Not every editorial department has each of these editors on staff, and not
every position carries these exact titles. But I hope this list gives you some
idea as to the many eyes, hands, and brains that go over magazine copy
before it’s published.
The process
For simplicity, I’m going to explain the process one measly article goes
through before it’s considered ready to launch. To get a true feel for the crazi-
ness of magazine publishing, you need to multiply this process by however
many articles and pieces are within a particular issue. Oh yeah, and remem-
ber this happens every week, month, or quarter.
A person with a title like senior writer first receives a draft of a story from the
main writer or contributing editor. The senior writer reads it and suggests
changes, working with the associate editor to lift the level of the story. At the
same time, the editors at the top of the chain read the story with a slightly
different eye, making sure the content is in line with the vision of the maga-
zine and suggesting their own changes where needed.
35
Chapter 3: Other Publishing Opportunities

The article is then forwarded to the copy supervisor, who reads and forwards
it to the copyeditor, if the editorial staff has one. These fresh eyes read it for
sense and logic, checking that the context is correct, the spelling and gram-
mar accurate, and the house style adhered to. Other facts, like names, titles,
and Web addresses, are researched by a fact-checker for accuracy. After
these steps are complete, the article is sent to the executive editor for
another sweep.
With issues resolved and answered, the article flies back to the copy supervi-
sor, who gets a proofreader involved to correct any niggling errors and prob-
lems with readability. The article then zooms back to the executive editor’s
team to read it, make fixes, and push it back up to the managing editor and
the editor-in-chief for a final okay.
The magazine manufacturing process can involve prepress services, such as
advertising and ad layout; printing; fulfillment; and distribution. As with most
things, the Internet and PDFs have greatly changed magazine manufacturing,
although magazines oftentimes outsource pieces of the manufacturing
process. Typically, an approved article is sent to the printer, who shoots the
file onto photo paper (in the biz, referred to as Kodaks) and returns it, where
it’s reviewed one final time by editing staff before final printing.
The parlance
In this industry, the word book is slang for the magazine. To help you avoid
confusion if you enter this world, I offer a list of terms you may smack into
36
Part I: Welcome to the Word World 
Church and state: Editing and advertising
In the magazine world, money doesn’t only talk,
it squawks — loudly. Along with subscriptions,
advertising money keeps magazines afloat. Run
an article unflattering to an advertiser, and you
run the risk of losing lots of money.
To give you a sense of how this situation affects
a magazine, a metaphor is used in the industry:
church and state. The church represents the
creative editorial staff, and the state represents
commercial advertising. Just as we strive in
government to separate the sides, so, too, does
the magazine industry try to prevent advertising
from influencing editorial decisions.
Like in real life, the lines between church and
state often get blurred, especially in trade pub-
lications and local consumer magazines. In
these types of publications, advertisers are
often guaranteed editorial column inches as
part of their purchase. How does this compli-
cate things? Well, not only are writers not going
to write anything offensive about advertisers,
they’re going to write unnaturally glowing fea-
tures about them. How’s that for an editorial/
advertising overlap?

while ferrying proofs back and forth. To be fair, some of this jargon does
overlap with book production (see Chapter 2), so be aware.
 Alley: The two margins in the middle of a page spread.
 Back of the book: The back pages of a magazine that contain indexes,
endnotes, and other such boilerplate information.
 Backbone: The bound edge of a magazine.
 Blow-in cards: Those annoying subscribe-now or smell-me cards blown
between the pages of a magazine. (If they’re stuck within the binding,
they’re called — ta-dah! — bind-in cards.)
 Bluelines: Also referred to as blues, a mock-up of the final magazine that
is folded and bound — and printed in a shade of blue. Any changes
made after the bluelines are pricey.
 Callout: A few sentences pulled from an article, blown up, and placed
prominently on the page to break up copy. It’s intended to attract atten-
tion and entice further reading.
 Center spread: Just like it sounds, an article or ad that covers the two
center pages of a magazine.
 Column inch: A measurement of space for copy that is one column wide
and one inch deep.
 Content: Anything within a magazine that is not advertising.
 Coverlines: Short lines of copy (sometimes referred to as cutlines)
placed on the cover of a publication to tempt newsstand browsers to
purchase it.
 CQ: Scribbled next to a word, it’s magazine talk for This word is spelled
correctly, capiche?
 Editorial inventory: A slush pile of sorts containing unpublished arti-
cles for future use.
 Filler: A short article or editorial used to fill blank space.
 Fixed elements: Elements within a magazine whose positions remain con-
stant from issue to issue, including the magazine title and editorial page.
 Front of the book: Beginning pages of a magazine, usually including edi-
torials, the masthead, and departments.
 Four-color process: A process used to produce the full range of CMYK
(cyan, magenta, yellow, and a key color — black) for a full-color image
appearance.
 Gatefold: A fold-out advertisement or article printed on a larger piece of
paper and folded to the size of the magazine.
37
Chapter 3: Other Publishing Opportunities

 Graf: A paragraph.
 Head: A headline.
 Lead time: The time it takes from planning to the newsstand 
(or mailroom).
 Masthead: A section detailing the publication’s ownership and staff
members, as well as contact information.
 Perfect binding: A method of folding and cutting magazine pages to
create a flat spine on which copy can be printed. It’s convenient for
inserts but doesn’t allow the magazine to lie open flat and is more
expensive than side stitching.
 Side stitching: Also called saddle stitching, the stitching where pages are
bound together by stapling the bound ends of the sheets.
 TK: Editorial shorthand for information to come.
 Well: The main section of a magazine where feature articles are 
published.
Trying on the Corporate Style
Maybe you thought that, by now, the paperless office would be a reality. Well,
think again. Information is an important product for companies, and anybody
who works in an office can attest to the flood of letters, memos, marketing
materials, reports, surveys, brochures, and invitations filling the hallways
and hands of the staff. Then there is the growing field of custom publishing —
the production of customer-oriented magazines and newsletters by corpora-
tions, nonprofit organizations, and trade associations. Unfortunately, down-
sizing has resulted in smaller and smaller marketing and communications
departments. Make that fortunately — for you, anyway.
Considering your possible role
If you’ve ever read Dilbert, you are aware that the corporate world has a rep-
utation for endless approval processes, board approvals, and review, review,
review. As a corporate copyeditor, you could be responsible for as much as
content editing (maintaining accuracy of the information presented, making
the material easily understandable and effective, and questioning the logic of
a document’s layout) or as little as quickly correcting blatant grammatical
errors before a document or publication blows out the door.
38
Part I: Welcome to the Word World 

If you want to work for the suits, keep a few things in mind:
 The author reigns. Unlike in the publishing world, final say of how a
document looks and feels sits firmly with the person who wrote or cre-
ated it. Whether good or bad, there’s a mentality here of “leave it with
the professionals.” And sometimes that is good, if money is the bottom
line. Imagine having to be the person to tell that big corporate donor
that his sappy writing style isn’t up to company par. Yikes!
 The deadline reigns, too. It’s terrible to admit, but if you have to choose
between creating quality and meeting a deadline, the deadline will win
almost every time. That’s sometimes true in the publishing world as
well, but here’s a key difference: In the publishing world, deadlines are
months in the making; in the corporate world, deadlines may be days, or
even hours, in the making.
If an invitation is due to hit the post office by 5 p.m. on Friday, it’s going
to be done by 5 p.m. on Friday — and neither you nor your mighty red
pencil will stop it. Soothe yourself with my assurance that corporations
take accuracy as seriously as the next guy; no one wants to see mistakes
in print. But the priorities of money, message, and professional ego win
every time.
 You may be alone. Depending on how large the company is, there may
be only one person to review and finalize a piece of information. Being
the only proofreader or copyeditor on staff has its advantages, but dis-
advantages tag along, too. You may be able to help hone the company’s
message, develop (or improve) a house style, and generally be a cham-
pion for clarity and consistency. But being the keeper of style can leave
you open to challenges from the non-editorial types as well.
If you’re editing solo, you may need to determine how to most effectively
communicate editorial issues with non-editorial staff members. That may
mean setting aside the proofreading symbols I show you in Chapter 9.
Consider your in-house audience, and decide how house style can best
be conveyed to people who aren’t as in love with words as you are.
Does it ever make sense to use proofreaders’ marks in the corporate set-
ting? I’d say yes. You may find that teaching other staffers the tools of
your trade generates enthusiasm for your cause and for the English lan-
guage. But the call is yours, and it depends greatly on your specific work
environment.
To be successful in this setting, you have to be an all-rounder. You’ll
work on projects that vary greatly — annual reports, press releases,
internal memos, customer magazines, the corporate Intranet, and any
other piece of marketing communication that the suits can dream up.
You need to be disciplined, setting up a system for prioritizing dead-
lines, communicating the system effectively to the people who dump
things on your desk to deal with, and enforcing it with grace.
39
Chapter 3: Other Publishing Opportunities

 You may get more benefits than expected. If you land a full-time corpo-
rate job, you may be blessed with myriad benefits you never imagined.
Sure, there’s the paycheck, health insurance, retirement package, and
stability. But there’s also something to that steady drone of nine-to-five.
Depending on the amount of in-house production of print and Web com-
munications a corporation does, the number of deadlines to juggle in a
corporate environment can be fewer than those in the publishing world
proper, but the system of daily deadlines can still help you develop
working habits that benefit you in any environment. The fixed flow of
related work can help you get into a rhythm, cut your teeth, and develop
your own style. Plus, being part of a corporate network means you have
the potential to make connections for other work; if you invite some-
body out to lunch, it may be a valuable steppingstone to something else.
Cracking the company exterior
Looking for copyediting or proofreading gigs in the corporate world isn’t
much different from looking for any other type of work (see Chapter 18).
You’ve got to pick up the paper, call your friends, and vroom out onto the
information superhighway.
I’d also encourage you to make a list of companies you’d love to work for. It
may be a short list if you’re focusing only on companies in your local area, or
it may be considerably longer if you’re willing to relocate. If you need inspira-
tion, check out Fortune magazine’s listing of the “100 Best Companies to Work
For” (go to www.fortune.com and click on Best Companies to Work For).
When you have a list in hand, go to each company’s Web site and take a look
around. You may find an employment page, but even if you don’t, take down
the contact information to make some calls and inquire about positions.
Larger companies usually have human resources departments that can give
you the type of information you need, including a contact name for submit-
ting a résumé. Also check out job boards that focus on opportunities in cor-
porate communications (the code term you’ll be searching for), such as the
one at www.pubmgmt.com.
Searching for Even More Opportunities
I’ve touched on books (in Chapter 2), magazines, and corporate bodies. Is
there anyplace else you can hang your editorial hat? You betcha.
40
Part I: Welcome to the Word World 

Becoming a news junkie
Newspapers are furiously busy with fast-paced reporters, deadly daily dead-
lines, and gruff-voiced editors barking from every doorway. At least that’s
how they are depicted in the movies, and there’s a modicum of truth to that
portrayal.
The role of the copyeditor takes on a whole new meaning in the high-stressed
headquarters of the dailies. Newspaper and wire-service copyeditors tend to
have more responsibilities than copyeditors in the book or magazine worlds.
To get a job in this field, you’re usually expected to be well-versed in journal-
ism, and a degree in that subject may be prerequisite. A newspaper copy-
editor may have a hand in deciding which story goes where on the page and
is the person who writes all those clever headlines you read each day.
If your preference is to proofread for a newspaper, keep this in mind: By the
time you get your grips on a newspaper article, it has already been set in its
final layout stage, and changes are not happily received. As with corporate
copyediting and proofreading, the deadline is the devil wreaking wrath on the
joint — regardless of what errors will keep the article at just good enough.
Bottom line: Although the goal of polished copy is the same for copyeditors
and proofreaders of newspapers and those working in other fields, the job
descriptions are very different. For information about copyediting news-
papers, be sure to check out the American Copy Editors Society Web site:
www.copydesk.org.
Taking your skills online
Anybody who has moseyed about the Internet can attest that it’s a potential
goldmine for copyeditors and proofreaders. You’ve probably seen hundreds
of errors between visiting Web sites, ordering goods, and filling out surveys
online. Some of these are memorable typos, like the online catalog that
boasts “Our goat is total customer satisfaction.” Baaaah . . .
When you encounter an error, send an e-mail to the Webmaster of the site.
(This person’s contact information is usually at the bottom of the homepage
or nestled within an “About Us” page.) Your e-mail should contain the error
and a note about yourself, and be sure to attach your résumé. See Chapter 18
for suggestions on how to phrase this type of e-mail.
41
Chapter 3: Other Publishing Opportunities

Do you ever peruse e-zines like Inc. or Slate? These Web-based publications
tend to update and post articles every few days or so. So? These publications
need editors and proofreaders just like the tree-based kind. And e-zines are
more opportunity-friendly than print magazines, which require in-house eye-
ballers due to quick deadlines and layout issues. E-zines are cool for other
reasons as well: They have a reputation for being more cutting-edge than the
traditional ’zines, and they’re Internet-based, which means you can edit them
from just about anywhere.
When taking on a copyediting or proofreading job with an e-zine, you’ll some-
times be handed access to the back-end, administrative tools of the Web sites
themselves. Many Web sites are constructed and maintained using modules,
or tools that allow Web site administrators to update specific content within
a site. Need to update the news page? Use the news module. Have a new cal-
endar event to add? Use the calendar module.
Using a module, you can simply log in to the e-zine’s administrative site and
make edits and corrections to the copy itself. Most times, you use a module
that works much like Microsoft Word. Webby types refer to it as WYSIWYG
(that’s “wizzy-wig,” or “what you see is what you get”). You don’t need a
crash course on HTML to do this stuff. Other e-zines request that you cut and
paste corrections into a Microsoft Word document and e-mail everything to
the editor. With e-zines, all these tools and all this flexibility make it even
easier for you to work while sipping coffee in your flip-flops.
Working with printers and typesetters
Though not an abundant source of work, the commercial printing industry is
a different marketplace to explore. Here, business demand is determined by
the needs — printing, advertising, and the like — of the general business
community. Who do you think prints all those glossy magazines? Commercial
printers, of course. Telephone books, advertising collateral, direct mail? They
print those, too.
Good printing and typesetting firms have proofreaders, sometimes part-time,
to review typeset copy before it is returned to the customer. The goal is to
keep more of the profits by minimizing any printer’s errors (or PEs) returned
by the customer’s in-house proofreader.
Check your Yellow Pages (also printed by commercial printing firms) under
“Printing” or “Typesetting” for local commercial printing opportunities.

Copyediting

In this part . . .
I
f you’ve set your sights on becoming a copyeditor, this
part is for you. (If you’ve set your sights on becoming 
a proofreader, I still think you should cozy up with these
chapters; knowing what a copyeditor does places your
own job in context and gives you a professional edge.)
First, I help you peek inside the daily life of a copyeditor
and different kinds of copyediting styles. Next, I delve into
the details of what makes a superior copyeditor and cover
some niche markets. Finally, I encourage you to pump some
mental iron by watching the editing process in action.

Chapter 4
So, What Does a Copyeditor Do?
In This Chapter
 Living the copyeditor life
 Duplicating some proofreading efforts
 Getting your mitts on the content
 Respecting the author’s voice
H
ave you ever read a story in which, suddenly, your blonde-headed pro-
tagonist became a redhead? Or her beloved poodle turned into a collie?
How about that document you read that referenced Smith University in
Massachusetts? (It’s Smith College.) Or maybe you stopped and scratched
your head when a character described the majestic view of the Atlantic
Ocean from his San Diego apartment.
Flub-ups like these are not only confusing; they could shatter a reader’s confi-
dence in a novel, a brand, or a product. One minute, you are relying on a
work for information or mind-numbing enjoyment, and the next, you are
aware of the language itself, stumbling over words like a strawberry blonde
over a crouching border poodle.
Here’s where a copyeditor could have changed things. Think of the copy-
editor as the behind-the-scenes magician whose role is to make the letters
and words, the punctuation and paragraphs . . . disappear! And right before
your trusting, unsuspecting eyes! Poof!
The copyediting process, although methodical, is straightforward enough:
It’s a thorough, careful reading (or multiple readings) with an eye on the lan-
guage and a brain on the intent. The copyeditor’s mind questions both the
commas (What’s that doing here? or Shouldn’t there be a pair here?) and the
content (Harry? I thought his name was Henry?) of a story, brochure, annual
report, magazine article, poster, e-mail, or anything else that contains words.
Like a magician, the copyeditor is armed with the skills and tools to tweak
and manipulate the tangible, black-lettered reality of words until they dis-
solve into an intangible understanding. If a copyeditor does her job correctly,
the mechanics are invisible to the reader, so that nothing interferes with the
reader’s experience of the story or with the message.

So, what does a copyeditor do, exactly? Who does a copyeditor work with?
And where in the stage of writing does the copyeditor come in? I tackle all
these subjects in this chapter.
A Day in the Life of a Copyeditor
Where does the term “copy” come from? As an English word, it’s related to
“copious”; both are from the same Latin root that means plenty or abundance.
But you can think of it as the “10-4! Y’copy?” bandied about by the Reno 911!
crowd. Copy is the message that comes across.
What’s the difference between copyediting and proofreading? To phrase it
the way it would be on the SATs, proofreading is to high school what copy-
editing is to college. In high school, you are fed — sometimes forcefully —
information that you are then expected to spit back out in some form; but in
college, you are granted the right to build upon that information, offering
your opinions and suggestions for improvement.
Clearly, there is overlap in the types of work expected of copyeditors and
proofreaders. I discuss this subject later in the chapter. But copyeditors step
deeper into the intricacies of voice and language, plot and argument, and
they maintain grammatical and tonal consistency. I discuss this subject later
in the chapter, as well! Before we tackle those topics, I want to clarify where
the copyeditor fits into the publishing process.
The big picture: Perfecting a product
Depending on the setting — a newsroom, a magazine, a publishing house, a
nonprofit organization, a corporation — copyeditors may work with house
editors, writers, designers, and a whole slew of other creative types. You
create, maintain, and fine-tune style sheets; meet tight deadlines; and often
work late hours, occasionally waiting at a desk for the next round of docu-
ments. Sometimes the name of the game is Hurry Up and Wait; other times,
your desk is a picture of disarray, overrun with brochures, reference guides,
dictionaries, usage manuals . . . and all the hair you’ve pulled out in frustration.
The copyeditor is part of a team that wants the same thing: a near-perfect
assembly of language that best conveys an idea. Each part of this team relies
on you: The author or managing editor hopes you smooth out kinks in the
words and meaning of the information presented; the publisher or company
or organization expects the edited piece to nicely fit into its general family of
produced information; and the reader or intended audience wants to glide
through the information without tripping over grammar, punctuation, syntax,
and spelling.

Part II: Conquering Copyediting 

After other folks have discussed the piece to be created, and after it’s been
written, you’re called upon to wave a wand (or a cursor, or even a fine-tipped
marker) over it and work some magic. Depending yet again on the circum-
stances, you may deal directly with the author, with whom you can discuss
expectations, deadlines, and how heavy your hand should be; or you may
work with an in-house intermediary — a managing editor or a project 
manager — who provides all the essentials to get the job done.
The little picture: Reaching for resources
Is it 10 percent or 10%, or even ten percent? Data is or Data are? And did that
country call for a cease fire or a cease-fire? Technically, each of these exam-
ples may be correct, depending on the house style of the organization you’re
working for. House style is the set of editorial conventions followed by the
publishing house or other organization that hires you.

Chapter 4: So, What Does a Copyeditor Do?
A keyboard and a quiet space
Back in the day of the typewriter, a copyeditor’s
toolbox brimmed with pencils, erasers, sharp-
eners, and sticky notes. Sometimes those are
still the tools of a particular job, but more and
more often, electronic editing is the norm. I dis-
cuss this topic in depth in Chapter 17, but here
are just some of the key advantages of editing
on-screen:
 Efficiency: You can nudge most software
programs into doing some of the work for
you by customizing toolbars, assigning key-
board shortcuts, and creating macros for
your oft-performed tasks.
 Accuracy: You can catch many typos
through spell-check without batting an
already beleaguered eye.
 Clarity: For clearer edits and queries, you
can track all changes made to the original
document, insert color-coded comments,
and save separate versions to delineate
between drafts and final edits.
 Design consistency: Templates within a
program help speed and simplify design, as
well as maintain the branding of a company
or organization.
For smaller jobs, you may want to print the doc-
ument and conduct a line-by-line reading. But
you’ll likely be expected to insert your correc-
tions into the electronic file and send the com-
pleted job back to the editor or author via e-mail,
instead of packing hard copy pages into an
envelope and shipping them.
As for where you should work, find a quiet place
to sit and read — aloud, if necessary. But
understand that a private space of your own is
a luxury that may not be available in the corpo-
rate world of work cubbies. If your workspace
is flanked by compulsive sneezers, chatty-
Kathys, and the ubiquitous speakerphone voice-
mail listeners, invest in a pair of noise-canceling
headphones.

House style is separate from the style followed by a specific industry. For
instance, a medical journal may follow AMA style, but it will also have its own
house style that specifies anything not covered by the AMA manual or any
place in which its practice departs from AMA style.
I give the whole subject of house style a thorough treatment in Chapter 14, but
know this: This key issue here is consistency. Consistency helps to make the
mechanics of language invisible, and house style makes consistency possible.
If an official house style does not exist, you have the option of perusing previ-
ous publications to see if you can get a handle on a particular issue, whether
it’s the treatment of industry-specific language or hyphenation and number
conventions. As the copyeditor, you can also create a set of acceptable con-
ventions yourself, best compiled by keeping a list of things you pick up while
going about your business. I discuss how to compile a thorough style sheet in
Chapter 15.
Here’s a quick rundown of the sources and resources you want to have on
hand while you’re editing (see Chapter 14 for lots more detail):
 A house style manual or style sheet. Before starting a job, ask whether
an established house style exists.
 A general manual of style. As I explain in Chapter 14, there are many
style manuals out there — The Chicago Manual of Style, The New York
Times Manual of Style and Usage, The Associated Press Stylebook and
Libel Manual . . . Before getting started, ask which manual the organiza-
tion or publisher follows.
 A house dictionary. In the editing world, the granddaddy of all dictio-
naries is Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary, now in its 11th edition.
You’ll get to know it better as Web 11.
There are several “Webster’s” out there: Random House Webster’s (RHW)
and Webster’s New World (WNW) are the biggest, and American Heritage
(AH) is another well-known choice. Be sure you use whichever one your
employer or client prefers.
 A thesaurus. A favorite of copyeditors is The Synonym Finder by J. I.
Rodale (Warner Books). The Internet is also a popular place to head for
suggested replacements for words, although Web-based thesauri have
their limitations.
 A usage guide. You want to get familiar with Garner’s Modern American
Usage by Bryan A. Garner (Oxford University Press).
 A handbook of English usage. College handbooks, such as The Little,
Brown Handbook by H. Ramsey Fowler and Jane E. Aaron and The
Penguin Handbook by Lester Faigley (both published by Pearson
Longman) are big sellers that offer overviews of writing style, grammar
basics, industry styles (such as APA, CMA, and MLA — see Chapter 14),
and more.
48
Part II: Conquering Copyediting 

 Subject-specific reference materials. The cardinal copyediting rule is
this: Look Up Everything. Is the copy peppered with foreign words? Are
you expected to verify city streets and highways? Is the job for a fashion
magazine? Or the sports page? Go ’head — fill your shelves with medical
and foreign-language dictionaries; quotation books and trademark
checklists; atlases and street maps; even the Bible, Koran, and Talmud, if
you think you’ll need them. Or at least become familiar with where you
can locate these types of references when you need them.
 Industry-specific publications. Previously published materials are great
for checking the consistency of usage and language — even accepted
jargon — within a particular industry.
 Trusty online resources. As you delve deeper into the world of editing,
you will come to trust certain Web sites and user groups to help you
make the best decisions in particular circumstances. (Plus, you can
commiserate with others who do what you do for a living!)
Everything is game for looking up. Everything. Place names, foreign words,
company titles, religious holidays, archaic spellings, industry jargon, com-
pound adjectives, book titles, song lyrics — the list continues ad nauseam.
If you don’t find an individual entry in your style guide, consult a dictionary
or other appropriate resource, and confirm, confirm, confirm. I discuss this
aspect of copyediting in detail in Chapter 5.
The itty-bitty picture: Sweating 
the small stuff
Okay, there’s a manuscript in your inbox and a style manual on your desk —
now what? Your job is to thoroughly read a document, which usually means
going over it again . . . and again . . . and again.
Line by line, word by word, you conduct a careful, concentrated, whole-brain
reading of the work. From the header to the endnotes, you answer these
questions: Does this (word, phrase, sentence, paragraph, section, chapter,
book) work? Will the intended audience understand this? If not, what can I do
to help make it clearer? And yes, you also cover spelling, usage, and every
scrap of punctuation (including apostrophes that face the wrong way).
Ideally, a copyedit is done in two rounds. On the first read, you want to deal
with structural and language-use issues. Your goal with the second read is to
spot and correct mechanical errors that you may not have caught on the first
read. Depending on the time available to you and the difficulty of the piece,
you may need more than two rounds to do the job right.
49
Chapter 4: So, What Does a Copyeditor Do?

While there is no one way to skin a copyedit, a good place to start is by cur-
sorily scrolling or flipping through the pages for the things your eyes more
easily pick up. Give your document a quick scan. Then go back for more.
The proofreader who reads your manuscript will study usage, spelling, punc-
tuation, layout, and all the other details of the piece just as excruciatingly. In
fact, many of your efforts will be duplicated when you pass a project off to a
proofreader (assuming that’s part of whatever editorial process you’re in).
And why not? In the publishing world, errors are like moldy strawberries —
they make you not even want to open the fridge.
In the next section, I spell out some issues that both the copyeditor and proof-
reader keep their eyes peeled for. Then I return to the subject of how to skin a
manuscript, offering lots of ideas on how you may end up doing your job.
The Marriage of Proofreading and
Copyediting: Identifying the Overlap
Both proofreaders and copyeditors need to follow house style, and they need
to be able to spot inconsistencies, spelling errors, typos, and grammar
wrongdoings.
Here are some things both of you look for:
 Mechanical errors: These tend to be errors of convention or house
style, such as
• Hyphens and dashes
• Capitalization
• The treatment of numbers
• Quoted information
• Abbreviations, acronyms, and initialisms
• Italicization, underscores, and boldfaced type
• Charts, tables, and graphs
Remember: If there is no established house style or hierarchy of style for
you to consult, let consistency reign.
 A consistency of parts: Here are the types of questions you’re going to
ask: Do page numbers correlate with those in the table of contents?
Does data in a chart match the facts in the copy? Does information in
the endnotes match the footnotes in the document?
50
Part II: Conquering Copyediting 

Parts to check for consistency include
• Footnotes and endnotes
• Photographs and illustrations and their respective captions
• Tables of content and page numbers
• Charts, graphs, and maps and their respective keys
• Placement of page numbers, headers, and footers
 Grammar and usage errors. This is where you use what we in the indus-
try call your editorial judgment. Your role is not to impose your own pref-
erences of syntax and diction upon a piece; rather, you are to make sure
the writing is clear, the thoughts well presented, and the tone appropri-
ate for the intended audience.
Here’s a sampling of items you’re looking for:
• Sentence fragments and run-ons: Make sure each sentence is
grammatically complete and can acceptably stand on its own.
Keep in mind that exceptions exist. Some house styles allow for
fragments because they help create a conversational tone. (You
find fragments in books For Dummies, for example.) And if you’re
working on a literary piece, even run-ons may be allowable
depending on the author’s style and intent.
• Subject and verb agreement: The subject(s) and verb(s) of a sen-
tence must agree in number and tense.
• Inconsistent parallelism: Be sure that sentences containing a
series or other matching elements are grammatically equal.
• Confusing pronoun references, incorrect pronoun cases, and
uncouth pronoun use: A pronoun becomes confusing when a
reader is forced to guess what it or they refers to. Your job is to
ensure the reader never has to guess.
• Essential and nonessential clauses: Essential clauses and
nonessential clauses both convey additional information about a
word or phrase in a sentence. The principal difference is that a
nonessential clause can be eliminated without changing the overall
meaning of a sentence, while removing an essential clause alters
the meaning of a sentence.
• Apostrophes run amok — or missing completely: It’s shocking,
the examples of this transgression you can find just on the way to
work in the morning: Bagel’s and Cream Cheese, Its Going to Be a
Hot One!, Baker and Son’s, and on and on.
The only time you ever use it’s (with the apostrophe) is for the con-
traction of it is. Period. Everywhere else, you use its.
• Errant or missing capital letters: Capitalization varies by house
style, so be sure to check the reigning guide before you get started.
51
Chapter 4: So, What Does a Copyeditor Do?

• And, of course, spelling and punctuation: Some copyeditors keep
a list of commonly misused or misspelled words to keep these
recurring mistakes in the forefront of their discerning brains. Other
copyeditors keep the list to impress their friends at parties. I share
just such a list in Appendix A.
A Copyeditor Apart: Editing Content
Okay, now we’re ready for the juicy stuff: what sets the copyeditor apart from
the proofreader. The distinction is content editing: A copyeditor does it; a
proofreader doesn’t.
Content editing requires close collaboration with the author or managing
editor of a project. Here are just some of the questions you ask yourself as
you read:
 Is the author’s diction and tone suitable for the intended audience?
 Is the presentation (such as the argument or plot) organized rationally
or appropriately?
 Is the layout logical?
 Are quotes or other borrowed material properly attributed?
If the answer to any of these questions is no, you carefully rework and
smooth these spots as discreetly as possible, without disrupting the author’s
purpose or voice. Think of yourself as a gardener; you prune and cut this leaf
and that one with the goal of leaving the garden looking and feeling as
organic and true to the original as possible.
What, exactly, does this pruning entail? Here are some of the things you do:
 Clarify ambiguous statements or assertions
 Correct structural, organizational, or conceptual problems
 Point out inconsistencies and discrepancies
 Streamline or revise figures of speech, redundancies, hyperbole, and
euphemisms
 Fix (or suggest how to fix) anything else that may muck up communica-
tion with the audience
You may also be asked to smooth awkward transitions, keep an eye out for
biased language or stereotyping, and point out libelous or otherwise salacious
statements that could expose the author or publisher to lawsuits. (For the stick-
ier, hairier issues, you are expected only to point out potential problems and
52
Part II: Conquering Copyediting 

possibly suggest changes to resolve them. You do this through a process you
will come to love: the query. I discuss querying later in the chapter.)
All the while, you maintain the appropriate tone and the author’s own lan-
guage. This is key, and I discuss it in detail in the upcoming section
“Maintaining authorial voice: The most important section in this book.”
Depending on the type of manuscript or document you edit, you may be
given a note (also called a style sheet) from the author with information on
slang, jargon, figures of speech, or acronyms unique to the particular genre
or audience. If you’re working on a fiction book, you may get a list of charac-
ters and their characteristics, as well as details of the world in which the
characters interact. If you don’t get such resources and believe they’d be
helpful, ask whether this information exists.
Pruning the text
Does all this work sound overwhelming? If a project arrives to you in rough
shape, it may feel that way. But if you stick with this profession, you’ll also
get to work on good pieces of writing that make you want to weep with relief
and joy. And, of course, the rough projects help you get better and better at
your job.
Here, I offer some ideas for trimming and shaping even the most unwieldy
language. Following are some offenses that you’ll encounter frequently:
 Clichés and other figures of speech: Your goal is not to eliminate every
cliché or convoluted metaphor you encounter. Rather, you should try to
rework areas in which these issues of speech cloud the message, create
confusion, or are not suited to what the author is attempting to say.
Take this example: It goes without saying that, in this day and age and at
this point in time, Joe should seriously consider what makes him tick or
he’s going to go nowhere fast. Ooh, gripping.
Aren’t you pretty much saying the same thing with Joe needs to figure out
what makes him tick? One idiom is enough. If the language sounds trite,
hackneyed, or just plain tired, blow fresh air into it.
 Euphemisms, business-ese, and jargon: Writers sometimes use one type
of word or phrase to represent another type of word or phrase to make
the former sound more agreeable, more important, or (ahem) more com-
plicated than it really is.
The world of politics all but owns the catalog of euphemisms; consider
collateral damage for unintended civilian casualties, or, worse, friendly
fire. But none of us is immune. We say that someone has passed on when
he’s died, a woman is expecting when she’s pregnant, and we’re eating
sweetbread when munching on the organs of an animal. Ew.
53
Chapter 4: So, What Does a Copyeditor Do?

Business-ese and jargon work the same way. For example, in most cases,
utilize and effectuate can be replaced with good ol’ use and cause. BTW,
those undecipherable chat-room abbreviations? They’re undecipherable
because they’re understood only by a specific audience. Say CUL8R to
such jargon, unless you have confirmed that the audience will pick it up
as a wink-wink, nudge-nudge.
 Redundancies: Many writers pick up phrases that sound just fine when
spoken but are unnecessarily verbose. You may want to stalk and tag
such things as past history (what history isn’t in the past?), plan in
advance (one doesn’t plan in hindsight), major breakthrough (aren’t all
breakthroughs major?), and he thought to himself (that’s usually who
hears the thinking).
Redundancies have a fan base, it seems. Amy Einsohn’s The Copyeditor’s
Handbook (University of California Press) has a good list of redundancies,
and funwithwords.com lists a fair few (www.fun-with-words.com/
redundant_acronyms.html). Richard Kallan’s Armed Gunmen, True
Facts, and Other Ridiculous Nonsense: A Compiled Compendium of Repetitive
Redundancies (Pantheon) is a fun resource as well.
 Inconsistency: This is a biggie, and this is where a thorough style sheet
(see Chapter 15) makes your life bearable. When working with book
manuscripts, great copyeditors also keep running lists of facts to refer-
ence as the book progresses.
For example, a fiction editor keeps notes on characters (page 12: Zoey
Jacobs, brown hair), places (page 32: Tulsa, Oklahoma; childhood home),
and other information (page 102: Mother broke leg in Christmas-light acci-
dent). If Zoey becomes Zoe on page 51, you want to query the change.
Inconsistencies occur just as easily in corporate documents, especially
when older names or conventions creep into new communications.
Maybe the Mid-Atlantic Division recently became the Eastern Coastal
Region. Your job is to make sure it stays that way.
 Passive voice: Surely you’ve had the grammar-check function on your
word processing program suggest that you rephrase a sentence in the
active voice. But what is that robot trying to tell you? In the active voice,
something or someone does the acting; in the passive voice, there is
action being done to that same something or someone.
Here’s some passive voice for ya: It was discovered that Laura did not do
her homework. The author isn’t saying who discovered it; she’s just
pointing out that Laura is a slacker. The active voice rewrite may be The
principal discovered that Laura did not do her homework. Here, we reveal
who did the discovering.
Does every sentence require active voice? Well, that’s where your editor-
ial judgment comes in. Despite what you may have been taught, the pas-
sive voice can be perfectly fine. Sometimes it doesn’t matter who
discovered what, and sometimes we just don’t know. In mystery novels,
54
Part II: Conquering Copyediting 

it may be exciting to let the audience wonder who outed the slacker —
it’s more important that Laura got caught.
Bottom line: Read everything in context (including in the context of the
house style for a particular project), and use your well-stocked head.
As a copyeditor, you hold the keys to more than errors in spelling and gram-
mar. You are the pin-striped (or pajama-wearing, if you work from home) 
gatekeeper charged with protecting copy against awkward, convoluted, or
otherwise bad writing. You check for language and usage consistency and
compliance with house or industry style. You make sure the information pre-
sented is free of anything factually incorrect or, worse, libelous. In a nutshell,
you make the copy as clean as possible before it’s handed to the proofreader
(assuming that’s who sees it next).
You’ve been a great crowd: Knowing 
your audience
I admit it: I would be somewhat embarrassed to show up at a nightclub in my
sensible shoes and frumpy work pants. Likewise, if I wore my way-too-drapey
“girls’ night out” halter top to a business meeting, I may be accused of, um,
questionable negotiating tactics.
Audience matters, and language that’s completely appropriate for one audi-
ence may raise the eyebrows of another. For example, a guide to Web-content
management ought to provide a definition of HTML the first time it is used.
(By the way, that’s hypertext markup language.) That same definition in a
newsletter for computer hackers would be construed as unnecessary, if not
insulting.
As copyeditor, you’ve got to make judgment calls, and the audience should
always be a key factor in your decisions. Here are some other examples to get
you thinking:
 Depending on the audience, you may or may not need to spell out abbre-
viations like PC, CPA, or mph.
 Common open compounds are not hyphenated unless ambiguity could
result. Your judgment call comes with determining whether something is
ambiguous to a certain audience. For example, using hyphens in real-estate
salesperson and small-business owner may be overkill for folks in the know.
 When editing books that are part of a recurring series, you can assume
the readers know something about the characters and storyline from
past installments. For example, they probably don’t want to be reminded
every time that the main character’s cloak of invisibility was bestowed
upon him by the slain king.
55
Chapter 4: So, What Does a Copyeditor Do?

The last people you want to offend are repeat customers; they’re the
ones who have the stamina to stand up all night waiting at the bookstore
for the latest edition to go on sale.
 Despite what you were taught in grade school, contractions and informal
language deserve their day on stage, although they’re more likely to be
used in books like this one than in a Forbes-100 annual report. Darn
tootin’!
On the flip side, readers of academic journals or textbooks are less apt
to be frustrated by the brambles of highfalutin scholarly language. For a
scholarly audience, the tone of the writing can be, well, less entertaining
without much repercussion. The readers will do the work to get to the
heart of the message or the results of the study. So if you’re editing a
less-than-inspiring article or chapter, use a lighter hand with the words
and pay more attention to consistency in the details.
When you’re in doubt about whether something is appropriate for your audi-
ence, the query is your friend. Stay tuned: A complete discussion of queries
is coming up at the end of the chapter.
Maintaining authorial voice: The most
important section in this book
Okay, so a good copyeditor makes style and usage corrections and considers
how information will be interpreted and understood by the audience. A great
copyeditor has another trick up her sleeve — one that blurs any traces of her
hand in the work.
Channeling the author
Say it’s necessary for you to rewrite or add one or two sentences for clarity.
You want to be sure that your language flawlessly maintains the integrity of
tone and consistency of the author’s voice found within the rest of the docu-
ment. It’s that gardener thing again: Weed and prune, but keep it close to the
original.
If you’re not sure about the exact language an author would be comfortable
with, you have every right to leave a note along the lines of “Consider chang-
ing this sentence to . . .” Most authors appreciate help in strengthening their
language, especially when the help is presented politely.
Here’s where I should talk about what a copyeditor doesn’t do. A copyeditor
doesn’t arbitrarily change things because that’s how he would do it if the
document were his. A copyeditor doesn’t rewrite or add whole chunks of
text, nor does he reorganize the logic or fix faulty development in plot; these
are things the author should handle. The copyeditor’s job is to ask questions
and make suggestions using queries.
56
Part II: Conquering Copyediting 

So, how do you best maintain the author’s voice? If the author’s sentences
are clear, factual, and adequately woven together, let them stand as is.
Asking what’s expected of you
Before you start a job, talk to the author or managing editor. You may want to
get an idea of the types of projects this person has worked on before. More
importantly, you want to find out what he or she expects of you. Specifically,
you need to ask how light or heavy an edit is required on the document.
Going heavy when an author expects you to go light could turn a great working
relationship into something . . . well, not. Gauging the difference is part intu-
itive and part knowing who you are working with. The following guidelines
may help.
Here’s what you do during a light (or baseline) edit:
 Correct inconsistencies in the mechanics of the body text — spelling,
capitalization, punctuation, abbreviations, use of hyphenation and
dashes, font and font sizes, and everything else your eyes take in.
 Correct inconsistencies in the other parts of the document — footnotes
and endnotes; tables of content and page numbers; placement of page
numbers, headers, and footers; and charts, graphs, and maps.
 Correct grammar and usage errors, but do not change anything that is
not an outright error.
 Flag awkward or confusing language, but do not revise it.
 Bypass benign areas of wordiness and jargon, but query unusual words
that may not be accessible to the audience.
 Flag information that seems incorrect or is not factual.
 Flag information that may require permission for use, as well as state-
ments or language that may expose the author or publisher to lawsuits.
During a heavy edit — the kind that may require a backhoe — you do the 
following:
 Correct all errors and inconsistencies in grammar, syntax, and usage.
 Rewrite areas of wordiness or confusing or awkward construction.
 Flag and query inappropriate or overused figures of speech, jargon, or
sentiment.
 Check and revise information that seems incorrect or is not factual.
 Query and suggest changes or fix discrepancies and conflicts in content
(or, if fiction, in plot, setting, and character details).
57
Chapter 4: So, What Does a Copyeditor Do?

 Flag and suggest changes in language that promotes bias or stereotyping
or is otherwise insensitive to a particular section of the readership. For
fiction, query the intent of bias-heavy language if it is difficult to discern
a reason for the language in the context of the piece.
 Suggest changes to the layout or order of information for clarity or a
more logical progression of an argument.
Perfecting the fine art of the query
Being a copyeditor is not synonymous with being a mind reader, and nobody
expects you to know everything. When you encounter a reference you don’t
understand, or when you come across a factual inconsistency, or when pic-
tures or tables referenced in a work are nowhere to be found, what are you to
do? Let out a great sigh — this is where the query comes in to save the day.
If you speak with the writer or managing editor before going about your task,
here’s some information to get that can serve you well: what kind of writing
or editing this person has done in the past, and how comments or queries
should be addressed. Some writers and editors are happy to see notes writ-
ten directly in their files, on their proofs, or on their manuscripts. Others may
not be so thrilled.
Querying on hard copy or in electronic files
Normally, a copyedited manuscript is returned to the assigning editor, who
resolves what queries she can and accepts whatever changes she thinks are
uncontroversial before sending a cleaner document to the author. Here’s
what you need to know: the assigning editor’s preference for how you present
your queries.
If you work on hard copy, knowing the editor’s preference is crucial:
 Some editors don’t mind if you write notes on the document itself
because it will not be the same document that goes to the author. Plus,
sometimes self-adhesive stickies can get lost, and that may be a source
of frustration.
 Other editors prefer stickies because they can remove anything they’ve
resolved and don’t have to distract the author with those queries. These
are the harried editors who hope they don’t have to create a cleaner
document to send to the author.
 Still other editors prefer that you create a separate notes document with
the queries numbered sequentially. You write a number or letter on the
manuscript page that requires a query, and the separate document con-
tains the actual queries. This method is particularly helpful if the docu-
ment you’re working on requires lots of queries.
58
Part II: Conquering Copyediting 

If you write queries on the pages themselves, circle them or draw boxes
around them. Doing so alerts everyone who follows you in the production
process that those marks are queries, not corrections. If the assigning editor
asks you to write queries on sticky notes, you still mark corrections and
changes directly on the hard copy. Attach the sticky note near the queried
item, and write the page number on the lower right-hand corner of the note
(just in case it falls off somewhere down the line).
If you copyedit electronic documents, you probably won’t have to ask about an
assigning editor’s preferred working method because it’s easy for the editor to
just resolve or remove whatever you question or change in the document.
Minding your manners
Queries should be as clearly written and straightforward as possible, and the
tone of your notes should never be sarcastic or demeaning. Write Will the
audience understand this reference? instead of What does this mean? Doing so
could mean the difference between a thoughtful rewrite by the author and
the ripping of your note for the trash.
And if there’s a word more beautiful than any other for queries, it’s this: con-
sider — as in Consider recasting sentence as . . . , or Consider replacing utilize
with use, or Consider moving paragraph to end of document. This word exudes
respect and concern without offending, and it may be your only way of nudg-
ing a change in language for the better.
It’s important to tread lightly, as even a seemingly obvious error may be a bit
of technical jargon or insider speak. But if you’re not sure, or if it’s not clear,
query away — you’ll be doing the writer and the readers a favor. And remem-
ber, after the publication is in print, it’s too late to do anything more than
shake your head.
Here’s some helpful language for addressing inconsistencies and errors in
queries:

“this” = refers to [possible reference] or [possible 
reference]?
Why are you using two 
If “mainframe” and “server” are equivalent here, 
words for the same thing?
consider using one term for both references.
Huh?
Will the audience understand what this word means?
If not, consider changing.
Sometimes the easiest thing to do is to revise the sentence yourself and then
say “OK as edited?” followed by an explanation for why the change was
made. For instance, I once edited a document in which the author wrote
“he was depraved from a father.” I suspected the author meant “deprived of,”
so I made the change and wrote: OK as edited? “Deprave” means “to malign or
corrupt.” That way the author saw the problem but didn’t feel obligated to
accept my change.

What Makes a Good 
Copyeditor Great
In This Chapter
 Ensuring accuracy
 Keeping an eye out for legal and ethical issues
 Editing notes, bibliographies, and more
You’ve mastered spelling and punctuation. Grammar and diction have
warmed up to you; in fact, you’re best buds. And editorial judgment just
called your cell phone. You’re all good.
But, wait. What if you don’t want to settle for good? What more can you master
before swimming deeper into the wordy waters? There are the mechanics of
copyediting, then there’s the mind-set — the psyche, if you will — of a copy-
editor. If you do the job well, you’re part detective, part lawyer, and just slightly
obsessive (in the best way, of course).
Let’s get psyched!
Checking (and Checking and 
Checking) Facts
Fact-checking is simply the verification of factual accuracy. A copyeditor is
not always asked to perform this task, but all copyeditors should know how
to fact-check.
Getting the details right doesn’t matter to everyone. But for some people,
everything they read is like a game of “gotcha.” Copyeditors should be among
those people. Let me illustrate:
At www.dummies.com, you can find out all about the For Dummies series,
part of the John Wiley & Sons family of educational and reference books.

While Ms. Reader will absorb that information no problem, accepting that it is
correct, Mr. CE may find his brain stopping and starting: Is www.dummies.com
the official For Dummies Web site? Is the series published by John Wiley &
Sons? Is John Wiley & Sons the official name of the company, or does the
company prefer different names for marketing, corporate, and legal pur-
poses? (If Mr. CE has said these things aloud, Ms. Reader at this point may
glare in his general direction and take her book to a quieter place.)
To prevent a proliferation of the look-at-me-my-life-was-tough-wait-no-it-wasn’t-
I’m-so-sorry-Oprah type of fictions, larger magazine and publishing houses
have on-staff fact-checkers who wade through the mucky details of fact
before the piece of writing lands in your hands. That said, your job of making
the copy as clean and error-free as possible may include making certain all
information is accurately presented. Ensuring accuracy never hurts in this
resource-heavy society. It’s not enough to knit your eyebrows at an article’s
assertion that the sun is 100 billion miles away from Earth; you must yank at
and unravel that knit to either confirm or correct it. (By the way, the estimate
of the sun’s distance from Earth is actually between 91 and 93 million miles.)
Weights and lyrics, company names and animal classifications, car models
and supermodels — it’s all game to be researched and checked for accuracy.
You may be thinking, With everything else on my plate, I have to do this, too?
Why, why, why?! Get up off your knees, and let me explain. Checking factual
declarations is about more than helping to cover the heinies of others.
Copyeditors can be the unsung averters of costly problems (can you imagine
having to reprint a textbook because of the astronomical assertion in the pre-
vious paragraph?), awkward slights (you don’t want to thank Sally Butts for
her generous donation to your cause, only to find out later that her name is
Betts), and even lawsuits.
There are different levels of fact-checking depending on the kind of text:
 Fiction: Here, you’re dealing with internal consistency (does a charac-
ter’s hair color change between one chapter and the next?) and with ref-
erences to real-world things (is that constellation really visible in the
northern hemisphere in winter?).
 Nonfiction: You’re not expected to redo an author’s research or to verify
statistics, but if you spot things that seem illogical, do query them. No
matter how tight your deadline, you must make sure you’ve at least
checked anything capitalized (names of people, places, and products);
any dates, times, or references to real events; and any assertion that
could potentially be libelous.
Eyeballing brand names
Though the Internet is not always a copyeditor’s ally, it’s a great research tool
to confirm correct spellings of brand names, the producers of said brands,
62
Part II: Conquering Copyediting 

and the conglomerates that inevitably rock the brands’ cradle. First, use your
favorite search engine to pick out your particular proper noun. Most times,
your friendly search engine will suggest a corrected brand name, should it
suspect that Macrosoft, for example, is faulty.
If you are unable to find an official maker’s Web site, or if you are unable to
attain clear consensus through the search engine, you may need to flag the
name. So do the initial check yourself, but if your answers turn up conflicted,
ask the author to verify.
With business names, pay close attention to unusual typographical features.
Is it MicroSoft or Microsoft, 7-Eleven or 7-11, NBC or N.B.C.? Check each 
name for capitals, midcaps, internal wordspacing, numerical characters, non-
alphabetical characters (Yahoo!), and internal periods. Every business name
you check should appear on the style sheet you create (see Chapter 15).
If you’re editing fiction, keep in mind that it’s fine to use brand names of prod-
ucts to add a sense of reality. For other types of writing, writers should con-
sider using generic terms: cotton swabs instead of Q-Tips, bandages instead of
Band-Aids, and cheese puffs instead of Cheetos.
If you’re not sure whether a product name is truly a brand name (and there-
fore in need of capitalization), here are two options:
 Check your handy-dandy dictionary, such as Merriam-Webster’s
Collegiate Dictionary, 11th edition. Look up Band-Aid, for example, and
you find out that there is, indeed, a trademarked Band-Aid for a small
adhesive strip with a gauze pad. (However, there’s also band-aid, used as
an adjective.)
 Mosey on over to the International Trademark Association’s Web site at
www.inta.org. It has a searchable database that Pop Rocks this world.
Look for the “Trademark Glossary” in its “Publishing” pull-down menu.
And please, to keep a reader’s eyes from crossing, do not muck up nice words
with those © or ® signs unless you absolutely have to. They’re startling to the
eye, silly to the feel, and completely unnecessary in magazine articles and run-
ning book copy. Trademark lawyers may try to insist that these symbols be
included in running text, but they’re not legally required except when the writer
mentions a product (such as a competitor’s product) in an advertisement.
Verifying people and place names
As if misspelling or misrepresenting a brand name isn’t bad enough, you also
have to worry about the names of people and places. Is that actor’s name
Nicholas Cage, or Nicolas Cage? (No h for this Cage.) What about Quatar? Is it
Qatar? (The latter.)
63
Chapter 5: What Makes a Good Copyeditor Great

Here are a few resources you want to have handy to check people and place
names:
 The Internet Movie Database (to friends, IMDb) bills itself as “the
biggest, best, most award-winning movie site on the planet.” And it’s the
closest thing to a definitive resource on name spellings for actors, direc-
tors, producers, and other stars (even the B-movie variety). Check it out
at www.imdb.com, but be aware that you may occasionally run across
an error. If you work frequently on copy that deals with films and celebri-
ties, keep a printed guide on hand as well, like Leonard Maltin’s Movie
Guide (Signet), which is updated annually.
 What IMDb is to pop culture, the Cambridge Biographical Encyclopedia
(Cambridge University Press) is to historical figures. Unfortunately, it’s
not (yet) available online. In this tome, you get a brief synopsis of world
leaders and cultural personalities, living and dead. A “How to Use” sec-
tion explains the format and cross-references and includes a pronuncia-
tion guide — great for dinner-party talk about Marcel Proust
(pronounced Proost) and Johann Wolfgang Goethe (that’s Gur-tah). Don’t
have the CBE? No problem — there’s a “Biographical Names” section in
the endpages of the Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary.
 For geographical names, may I suggest the latest edition of Merriam-
Webster’s Geographical Dictionary? If you’d rather use the Internet, 
run the spelling through a search engine and find a generally accepted 
consensus.
 For a whole collection of authoritative sources, you may want to try
www.bartleby.com, your one-stop shop for unlimited and free access
to Columbia Encyclopedia (Columbia University Press), The American
Heritage Book of English Usage (Houghton Mifflin), Bartlett’s Familiar
Quotations (Little, Brown), Gray’s Anatomy of the Human Body (Lea &
Febiger), and Strunk’s The Elements of Style (W. P. Humphrey), among
others.
As good as many online resources are, a copyeditor ought to have printed
resources as well. Errors can creep in with scanning and transcription, so
Web versions of printed books are always second-best. Any quotation from
an online source should be checked against the print version if there is one.
With that caveat in mind, here’s a go-to guide of fact-filled Web sites to keep
on hand while editing:
 Movie stars, directors, and other film-related ephemera: The Internet
Movie Database at www.imdb.com
 Domain names: Go Daddy at www.godaddy.com
 Famous, and not so famous, quotations: Bartlett’s Familiar Quotations at

Spying Potential Offenses: Three Ways 
to Save an Author’s Backside
Imagine that you’re reading a document written by a pro: someone who knows
how to use the English language (including how to spell) and how to present
an argument, sales pitch, or plot line with clarity and style. Here’s my warning:
Don’t ever assume that a near-perfect presentation means you can coast
through a job. Sometimes evils lurk beneath the surface of such a document.
A great copyeditor must be on high alert for the following three-alarm issues.
Recognizing the need for permissions
The responsibility of obtaining permissions to reprint copyrighted material —
be it song lyrics, a snippet of poetry, or even a dictionary entry — falls on 
the author of the work. And who do you think is responsible for alerting the
author to copyright wrongdoing? That’s right, it’s you — the copyeditor. You
are not responsible for knowing whether a quotation, passage, or artwork
requires permission. You are simply responsible for flagging it and asking the
question.
Amid the jumble of legal language contained in section 107 of the copyright
law (officially called the U.S. Code), you find something called “fair use.”
Teachers, students, and most nonprofit organizations may use some
excerpted materials without infringing on copyright laws. The rest of us, 
however, must get permission to use somebody else’s work.
65
Chapter 5: What Makes a Good Copyeditor Great

Here’s the nitty-gritty: Up to 250 words total of a text (continuous or from dif-
ferent parts of the work) can be used, if the text is a standard prose work.
When it comes to poems, lyrics, and the like that themselves may be much
shorter than 250 words, then using even a line or two can cause trouble.
But a legal issue wouldn’t be a legal issue without confusing addendums, and
you need to know about one called public domain. This term is used for
works that are either ineligible for copyright protection or whose term of
copyright protection has expired and may not be renewed. What makes a
work ineligible or why the copyright runs out is too boring to mention here.
The important thing to remember is this: For works in the public domain, no
permission is necessary for use; they can be quoted to the author’s content,
whether in books, on Web sites, or on the biggest billboards you’ve got.
Where can you confirm whether a work is considered public domain? Check
these Web sites, or enter “public domain works” into your favorite search
engine:
 Project Gutenberg (www.gutenberg.com): This site doesn’t claim to
include every free-use work known to humankind, but it contains elec-
tronic versions of more than 19,000 public domain books and other doc-
uments, and its nifty author and title searches greatly simplify your
work.
 Bartleby.com (www.bartleby.com): Worthy of another mention, this
site is a great source for public domain works, with separate search
menus for reference, verse, fiction, and nonfiction.
Sniffing out plagiarism
In the world of words, there is no greater intellectual offense than plagiarizing
somebody else’s work or ideas — and it’s not always committed by some
malicious malcontent. You know that plagiarism includes copying large sec-
tions of text from another source without including a citation, but what about
actions that are more difficult to sort out and put your finger on?
We’re all bombarded with so much information every day that it’s easy to
understand why an author may not know exactly where she has picked up
certain facts or ideas. An author may not even know that an offense has been
committed.
To avoid having a big red P affixed to your — or your author’s — chest, be
mindful of the following when reading a work:
66
Part II: Conquering Copyediting 

 Exact words from books, magazines, television shows, Web sites, songs,
or other media must be cradled in quotation marks and credited with
the source and the author, if available. Ideas from the same must be
restated by the author in words that greatly differ from the original, and
they, too, must be credited with the original source and author.
 Visual material, such as pictures, illustrations, and charts, must be cred-
ited with the source and an author or originator. The author must track
down the copyright owner; otherwise, you can’t use the image.
 Information received through an interview or conversation with another
person — however informal and whether by telephone, by e-mail, or 
in person — must include a citation and may include the date of the
interview.
Keep in mind that facts that are common knowledge do not need to be sup-
ported with citations. For example, if an author writes that World War I took
place between the years 1914 and 1918, you do not need to pull down a dusty
tome from the shelf to get another author’s name for a citation.
If, while you are copyediting, a storyline rings fantastically familiar or you
suspect that an article covers a topic you’ve already read, either flag it for
the author or do some research to locate the other source. If you do the
research and confirm overlap with another source, flag that the plagiarized
portion be corrected. Experienced copyeditors will call or e-mail the editor
as soon as plagiarism is suspected, because it can take time to correct the
problem and may have an impact on the production schedule.
You can check for plagiarism by using many of the same methods and
resources I present in the “Checking (and Checking and Checking) Facts” sec-
tion earlier in the chapter. The Internet can be your best friend in this task.
Here’s the bottom line: When in doubt, flag or query anything that looks like
it is not properly attributed. The assigning editor will normally go through
the queries, passing along only those that he cannot resolve without the
author’s input, so it’s better to query than to ignore.
Walking the line with political correctness
What do Tron, Rubik’s Cubes, parachute pants, and political correctness have
in common? They all got their start in the ’80s. And while Tron is now a cult
classic, Rubik’s Cubes are tradeshow freebies, and my husband (thank heav-
ens) no longer wears those awful swishing things, political correctness is
here to stay.
67
Chapter 5: What Makes a Good Copyeditor Great

The copyeditor’s job is to point out when an author strays too far over the
fine line between being wisely cautious and being a little silly.
Writing shouldn’t offend people, nor should it coddle them. It should be sen-
sitive to language or sentiment that unnecessarily excludes or alienates
whole groups of people — especially your readers. Moreover, copyeditors are
expected to flag or change language that promotes bias or stereotyping of
others (based on gender, religion, race, sexual orientation, age, or a mental or
physical disability). That said, you must find a precarious balance between
eliminating language you personally find unacceptable or offensive and allow-
ing the author to fully express himself. Your goal should be to keep an ear 
to the ground for those transgressions the author may not be aware he is
committing.
When people rail against political correctness, they’re usually stating that it
has run amok. The label “PC” is, more often than not, applied disparagingly.
However, you do need to watch out for things that could genuinely offend
readers. Following are some things you may ask your author about:
 Gender:
• Is it necessary to refer to an object or country as he or she when it
would suffice?
• Is there a reason to use such terms as male nurse or female doctor?
• Is the generic use of he appropriate? (For example, Every director
must report to his office by 9:00 a.m.)
• Can chairman and fireman be changed to the more gender-neutral
chair and firefighter?
 Race:
• Is it necessary to point out racial differences? (For example, The
board comprises six men and three African-American women.)
• Is there reason to use such archaic terms as oriental (instead of
Asian)?
 Disabilities:
• Is it appropriate in context to mention a disability? (Despite his
prosthesis, he was a profitable stockbroker.)
• Should you consider changing such negative references as confined
to a wheelchair? Perhaps wheelchair-supported would be equally
clear.
Don’t let the whole PC thing get out of hand. A term like differently abled,
while well intentioned, reads strangely euphemistic and maybe should be
struck for a more acceptable term, like developmentally delayed.
68
Part II: Conquering Copyediting 

For some PC mirth, check out Henry Beard and Christopher Cerf’s book The
Official Politically Correct Dictionary and Handbook (Villard), offering an enter-
taining lexicon of politically correct terms.
A note of caution: While it is necessary in journalism and most corporate
communications to maintain an impartial tone, fiction is a whole different
game demanding much different rules. Don’t immediately fire on descriptions
of people as “yokels” or change dialogue that contains controversial language
and subject matter. Bias-heavy language may be part of the characterization
of a person, or part of the story, and shouldn’t be touched by the hands of
anyone other than the author. If you can’t discern the intent of the offending
language in context, querying the author is always an option.
Becoming a Sourcing Expert: Footnotes,
Endnotes, and Bibliographies
You know how it is when you’re talking to a coworker about his weekend and
he starts telling you about how nice the weather was, and then he goes on to
say that he was quarreling with his significant other and they’ve decided
they’re really not all that happy with their relationship and maybe they need
a break from each other and now there is this barista he keeps running into
at the coffee shop around the corner who gives him a grande latte but only
charges for a tall . . . and you’re thinking, “Whoa, T.M.I.”
You’ve been there. You know what I mean. Sometimes you just don’t need all
that data.
Footnotes and endnotes are tools to use in instances where an author wants
you to know that he’s got more info if you want it, but he realizes that you
probably don’t. This note system lets authors get on with their narratives
and not bore everyone with what particular issue of the Farmer’s Almanac
they got their prediction from and on which page it was found. The system is
also vital for providing citational support for assertions, and for giving the
source of quotes.
Especially if you’re interested in copyediting academic texts, whether books
or journal articles, knowing how to handle footnotes, endnotes, and bibli-
ographies can make you a hot commodity.
69
Chapter 5: What Makes a Good Copyeditor Great

Marking the notes: When the foots 
justify the ends
Let’s recap what your high-school English teacher was getting at when you
were struggling with that report on the hole in the ozone layer: Anything in
the main body of your text that needs further explanation should be refer-
enced using the note system. Notes can be in the form of footnotes or end-
notes. Both work the same way:
 A reference mark is placed in the running text.
 An explanation is listed with that same reference mark at the foot of the
page (for footnotes) or at the end of the manuscript (for — hazard a
guess? — endnotes).
“Marco?”: The reference mark
The term reference mark refers to the number or symbol placed in running
text (or a table) that alerts the reader that there is more information to be
found elsewhere about some piece of information he just read. You create a
reference mark by placing a small symbol, letter, or number immediately after
the sentence or clause containing the information to be referenced. The mark
should be formatted as supertext (smaller and set slightly higher than the rest
of the line of text):
“We didn’t need to look far to witness the socioeconomic toll such a dic-
tatorship had on its people,” Bob said upon his return. “It was written on
the wearied faces of each and every Minsk citizen.”3
If a document contains many notes, they should be numbered, starting over
at the beginning of each chapter. If the footnotes are few, their numbering can
run consecutively throughout the work. If there are very few notes, use sym-
bols such as these:
 Asterisk (*)
 Dagger (†)
 Double dagger (‡)
Also use symbols if the author is using superscript numbers for other things,
such as mathematical equations.
While you won’t see this situation often, when both footnotes and endnotes
are used, suggest that the endnotes be referenced with numbers and the foot-
notes with asterisks, daggers, and so on.
70
Part II: Conquering Copyediting 

If the manuscript has way too many footnotes or endnotes, suggest that the
author consolidate them. For instance, sometimes one reference mark is
enough to cover multiple notes within one long paragraph.
Now, where to place those marks . . .
Always place reference marks after the material they explain. Put them at the
end of a sentence or clause, after the punctuation. One exception: They
should be placed before a dash, never after.
Not great:
Atlanta’s efforts to curb downtown traffic during the 1996 Summer
Olympics dramatically improved the health of children with asthma2 and
people of all ages with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Better:
Atlanta’s efforts to curb downtown traffic during the 1996 Summer
Olympics dramatically improved the health of children with asthma and
people of all ages with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.2
In some instances, reference marks are placed before a closing parenthesis, if
they refer to the information inside the parentheses.
After two years of shared residency, they applied for her green card
(although he previously stated he had misgivings about the strength of
the marriage3).
“Polo!”: The reference note
Footnotes and endnotes can be used to reference just about anything that the
author doesn’t want included in the main text. There are four typical uses:
 Alerting readers that material was borrowed
 Identifying the source of statements or quotations
 Presenting background or supplementary material that is way too much
information for most people
 Referencing other parts of the work
Why use footnotes instead of endnotes, or vice versa? Well, most people use
footnotes because they are easier to read: You don’t have to keep flipping to
the back of the book. But many publishers prefer endnotes, purely for the
aesthetics. With endnotes, the main pages remain clean and “untechnified.”
The publishers’ great fear is that when you pick up the book in a bookstore
and see tons of footnotes at the bottom, you’ll think, “Whoa. This is gonna be
a drag to read.”
71
Chapter 5: What Makes a Good Copyeditor Great

Here’s a brief rundown of how to use each type of note:
 Footnotes: Generally, footnotes are placed at the bottom of the page on
which a statement to be cited or otherwise noted appears, typically in a
font smaller than that of the running text. They should always begin on
the page on which their reference marks appear.
Don’t let your note get lost in transition. If a footnote carries over to the
next page, the break should fall midsentence so the reader knows the
note continues beyond that page.
 Endnotes: Endnotes are grouped in their own section and placed after
the main text and appendixes and before the bibliography. Endnotes are
oftentimes in a smaller text than the running copy. A simple heading of
Notes is sufficient to differentiate this section from the others.
If an endnote is added to or deleted from the slew of notes, the entire lot
of them has to be renumbered from that point on.
Now, just to complicate matters, there are two terms that publishing types
sometimes bandy about to describe types of footnotes and endnotes:
 Content notes: These are additional things an author or editor wants
you to know about that statement or fact or whatever else the reference
mark is attached to.
 Source notes: These indicate where the statement or fact came from,
with no peanut-gallery commentary.
Content notes and source notes are not treated differently within the same
text; these are just good terms to know so you can communicate effectively
with authors and editors.
Want more confusion? Well, there are also parenthetical notes, which — as the
name implies — are tucked within parentheses and inserted within the copy
itself.
Nailing down note styles
There are as many different manuals of style that dictate how to reference
things as there are industries and audiences. Most of us caught wind of
this in high school, where we probably followed the Modern Language
Association’s style for our carefully referenced research papers (um, yeah).
In your copyediting adventures, you may encounter any number of manuals
of style. You need to be sure to have the latest edition of a given style guide
at all times, and to be sure when accepting a job that the publisher is using
the same edition. A lot of stuff changes between editions, believe it or not.
Here are some of the most frequently used manuals of style:
72
Part II: Conquering Copyediting 

 American Medical Association (AMA) style: The American Medical
Association Manual of Style contains definitive guidelines for medical
writing.
 American Psychological Association (APA) style: The Publication
Manual of the American Psychological Association is used by many acade-
mic disciplines, including the social sciences and humanities.
 Chicago style: The Chicago Manual of Style seems to be the most widely
used within the book publishing world. Have a copy within arm’s reach
while editing. And, for the record, its official title is appended with the
following: The Essential Guide for Writers, Editors, and Publishers.
 Council of Science Editors (CSE) style: Scientific Style and Format: The
CSE Manual for Authors, Editors, and Publishers covers all areas of science
and related fields, including the responsibilities of authors, editors, and
peer reviewers in scientific publications.
 Modern Language Association (MLA) style: The MLA Handbook for
Writers of Research Papers claims to be the official guide for nonfiction
writing. Academics who don’t use APA style often use MLA.
In Chapter 14, I discuss these and other style guides in detail.
How a footnote or endnote is reflected in a work depends on the guiding style
for the document or manuscript. Next, I show you a few different ways to ref-
erence a book, sorted by APA, MLA, and Chicago style.
American Psychological Association (APA) style
APA uses parenthetical citations for sources, so footnotes and endnotes are
used for explanatory notes and copyright permissions only.
Parenthetical source citation:
A recent book chronicles Abraham Lincoln’s bouts with depression
(Shenk, 2005).
Content footnote or endnote:
2 See Shenk (2005), especially chapters four and seven, for examples of
Lincoln’s bouts with depression.
Modern Language Association (MLA) style
MLA recommends using footnotes and endnotes for source citations only.
Source footnote or endnote:
2 Joshua Wolf Shenk, Lincoln’s Melancholy: How Depression Challenged a
President and Fueled His Greatness (New York: Houghton Mifflin, 2005),
135.
73
Chapter 5: What Makes a Good Copyeditor Great

Chicago style
Chicago style encourages the use of footnotes and endnotes for content, and
it doesn’t establish word or sentence limits.
Content footnote or endnote:
2 While this theory that Lincoln suffered from depression has been bandied
about in academic circles, a recent book is an easier read to get an idea of
the extensive research available to support this idea. See Joshua Wolf
Shenk’s Lincoln’s Melancholy: How Depression Challenged a President and
Fueled His Greatness (New York: Houghton Mifflin, 2005), especially chap-
ters four and seven.
Footnote or endnote source citation:
2 Joshua Wolf Shenk, Lincoln’s Melancholy: How Depression Challenged a
President and Fueled His Greatness (New York: Houghton Mifflin, 2005),
135.
Dizzy? Don’t worry — your managing editor (or whoever else is elbowing you
for editing) will likely provide you with examples of that particular publishing
house’s style on footnotes and endnotes.
Copyediting this stuff: The bitter dessert
Save the footnotes and endnotes for after you’ve read everything else. Get a
sense of what the story or information within the running copy is trying to
tell you, then go back and read all the notes from start to finish. And keep
your feelers out for the following:
 Are the notes in proper order?
 Are the reference marks placed properly within the text?
 Does the note that the reference mark corresponds to seem appropriate
and correct?
 Do the notes have any obvious errors (misspellings, incorrect italics,
and so forth)?
 Is the format for each consistent and identical?
When reviewing footnotes and endnotes, the three most important things to
check for are
 Consistency
 Typographical errors
 Consistency
74
Part II: Conquering Copyediting 

Do the first and third items seem similar? I stress consistency because such
little details can mean the difference between a book that rings of profession-
alism and a book that clangs of shoddiness. While many readers don’t notice
inconsistencies in reference notes, some do. Sloppy notating can bring the
accuracy of the entire piece into question. And authors want people to know
how accurate they are, right? Otherwise, why have all those little notes?
Bibliographies: Reeling in the resources
Reference notes can also refer a reader to a bibliography: the list of works an
author has used in putting together her own work. The bibliography is alpha-
betized and usually placed just before the index.
While bibliographies can be formatted in many ways, a typical entry looks
like this:
2 Simpson, C., State of the Nation’s Air Quality, Lung Health Association,
2004: 49–51.
From this entry, you can tell that the author of the source material is C.
Simpson, the article is called “State of the Nation’s Air Quality,” the publica-
tion is Lung Health Association, the date of the publication is 2004, and the
information is on pages 49–51. You can trust that if the author went to such
pains to write out all that information, it ought to be accurate; you don’t have
to go to the library and look it up. But you do need to understand how it’s
laid out so you can compare it with other entries. Let’s assume the next entry
is as follows:
3 M. Josefson, On Mexican Wifehood, Staten Island Chronicle; 2006: 18, 16.
After comparing the two, you may query the author about these things:
 Should the article name be in roman and the publication name be in italics?
 Should the “M.” be placed after “Josefson,” as in the first example?
 Should this entry be alphabetized by “Josefson”?
 One entry has a comma before the year; the other, a semicolon. Which
should prevail?
 Should the pages be reordered to “16, 18”?
As with footnotes and endnotes, bibliographic entries can differ by style.
Here’s an example of American Psychological Association (APA) style:
Shenk, Joshua Wolf (2005). Lincoln’s Melancholy: How Depression
Challenged a President and Fueled His Greatness. New York: Houghton
Mifflin.

Chapter 5: What Makes a Good Copyeditor Great

And an example of Modern Language Association (MLA) style:
Shenk, Joshua Wolf. Lincoln’s Melancholy: How Depression Challenged a
President and Fueled His Greatness. New York: Houghton Mifflin, 2005.
Chicago style suggests different bibliographic entries depending on whether
the readership for the manuscript or paper is within the realm of the sciences
or the arts, history, and literature. Here’s a sciences bibliographic entry:
Shenk, Joshua Wolf. 2005. Lincoln’s Melancholy: How Depression
Challenged a President and Fueled His Greatness. New York: Houghton
Mifflin.
And an arts, history, and literature bibliographic entry:
Shenk, Joshua Wolf. Lincoln’s Melancholy: How Depression Challenged a
President and Fueled His Greatness. New York: Houghton Mifflin, 2005.
Again, chin up — you should receive examples of acceptable bibliographical
entries before you begin a project.

R
eady to take your copyediting skills beyond the margins? One way to
make yourself more valuable to potential employers is to identify a pub-
lishing niche and focus your training, freelancing, and/or job-hunting efforts
on it. In this chapter, I offer details on three niches I happen to know a good
deal about: editing fiction, converting British text for a U.S. audience, and
editing cookbooks.
Maybe none of these three specialties interests you. Maybe you’re more
inclined to pursue work in the fields of education, medicine, science, finance,
sports . . . name your pleasure. If that’s the case, my advice is to search the
Web and Writer’s Market (see Chapter 2) to get a sense of the publishers who
focus on that specialty; read as many books or articles that relate to that field
as possible; and, while you’re reading, pay close attention to the conventions
used in the writing.
The next logical step is to identify the style guide(s) most often used by edi-
tors working in your field of interest. In Chapter 14, I list a variety of style
manuals, including the American Medical Association Manual of Style, the
Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, and The Gregg
Reference Manual (a favorite of business writers). If you want to edit online
content or technical materials, you may want to become familiar with Read
Me First! A Style Guide for the Computer Industry, Second Edition by Sun
Technical Publications (Prentice Hall), or the Apple Publications Style 
Guide, which is available online at http://developer.apple.com/
documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/APStyleGuide/
AppleStyleGuide2006.pdf.

With lots of reading and style research under your belt, you’ll have more con-
fidence — and more to offer — when you start knocking on the doors of the
publishers in your field of interest.
Editing Fiction
How would you like to get paid to read a bestseller or peruse the publications
of your favorite genre? Fiction editing is one way to use your skills for fun and
profit. But there’s much more to copyediting a novel than plopping a manu-
script on your beach towel and letting your love of literature go wild.
Letting the author’s voice reign
The author’s voice and poetic license reign in the pages of fiction. Some of
the topics I cover in Chapters 4 and 5 may need to be folded up, stuck in a
book, and put on a shelf, because they won’t necessarily apply here.
When you edit fiction, you perform some of the same tasks as when you edit
corporate and other nonfiction materials. For example, you may be charged
with formatting the manuscript (see Chapter 16), and you usually correct
spelling, grammar, and punctuation issues. (I say usually because, depending
on the context, the author may actually want misspellings or incorrect gram-
mar left alone.) But that’s where the similarities end. Copyediting fiction
doesn’t require adhering to a publisher’s house style manual. Instead, it
requires doing everything possible to maintain the integrity and cohesion of
a story and to preserve the voices of the author and the characters. The
author’s voice is your house style when you copyedit fiction.
In Chapter 4, I stress that maintaining the author’s voice is the most impor-
tant part of your job. In fiction, voice is even more crucial than in nonfiction.
Creating a specific voice is how a fiction writer communicates and engages
the audience. It adds an entire layer of meaning — sometimes acting as a
character itself — over the surface of the general storyline and details of a
novel. Think of the drastic difference between the style and tone of a Stephen
King novel and that of a Jackie Collins novel, and you’ll see what I mean.
Fiction editors and writers rely on copyeditors to use common sense and a
light touch. You need to keep an ear to the ground for the author’s voice and
style, and you need to keep your paws off the editor’s territory. That means
no comments on character development, no “improvements” to the plot or
suggestions on how you’d change the story, and no scratching at the dia-
logue to make it more “correct.”
78
Part II: Conquering Copyediting 

But you are allowed to finesse language that sounds awkward or may confuse
a reader. Say you come across two ancillary characters with the same name;
you may want to suggest a change to one of the names to ensure a reader
understands that they are two distinct characters. Or maybe the writer uses
a word six or seven times in the matter of three lines; you may want to flag it
and suggest other words to break up the monotony.
Let me say it again: The author’s voice is your house style when you copyedit
fiction. Listen to that voice to figure out the pace and the preferences of
grammar, diction, and expression that hold the consistency of the novel in
place. Is the cop eating a donut or a doughnut? When that alien said “Nanu
nanu,” were the words in italics or not? Is the author consistently using a
dash to introduce interior monologues and the thoughts of characters?
Careful readings and a sensitive ear will reveal these kinds of things and
much more. You may even want to read a fiction manuscript out loud.
With fiction, one reading is never sufficient for a thorough copyedit. Your first
reading gives you a sense of the pacing of the storyline; the complexities of
the plot, subplot, and characters; and the consistency and construction of
language and voice. You can also catch typos and other obvious errors
during the first read. During a second reading, your goal is to catch discrep-
ancies that can ruin a story. If the author writes that Bianca has been ga-ga
over Guy for the past five years, never paying attention to other men, how
can she later reminisce about dating Gordon?
With each character, fact, and event presented, the author builds a world that
is credible in its consistency. Who cares that the centaur has three heads and
is pink? We can believe that, except if that same centaur inexplicably turns
blue, in which case you need to query. (If said centaur has chameleon tenden-
cies, it’s probably best to let the reader in on that ability before she suspects
a mistake.) As I explain in Chapter 4, the query is your best bud when you
need to respectfully point out things that just don’t jibe within the world the
author has created.
Ensuring continuity and chronology
Readers of fiction are much different than readers of newspapers or text-
books. Rather than reading for information or to learn a new task, fiction
readers want to be entertained. For that to happen, they need to be able to
get past the words, forget where they are, and become oblivious to the pas-
sage of time. For a reader to have this experience, a novel must have internal
coherence.
79
Chapter 6: A Handful of Copyediting Specialties

Nothing is more frustrating to a reader than errors in continuity and chronol-
ogy. What are these things?
 Continuity: This word refers to the overall logic and consistency of a
story’s internal world. It applies to characters and relationships, plots
and subplots, places and the things within them, and events and time-
lines. Your job is to ensure that the reader can depend on the descrip-
tions of these elements to remain the same throughout a work.
 Chronology: If a story begins on a beautiful summer day, it doesn’t make
sense if later that evening it starts snowing. If we’re told in one chapter
that Dusty’s parents died when she was very young, she can’t later intro-
duce her new boyfriend to her mother.
How can you possibly remember everything when you’re editing a lengthy
manuscript? During your first read, you start to keep track of all the people,
places, and things you encounter in the world of the novel. With each subse-
quent read, you add to the list. The result is your style sheet for that work.
Here’s what such a style sheet should include:
 Design elements: Are there reference notes? If so, are they located at the
bottom of each page or at the end of the chapter? Is there artwork, and
is it always in the same place on the page or in a chapter?
 Words, language, and usage: Are certain words always capitalized? Did
the author hyphenate red-headed mistress? Does the story contain
invented or non-English words, padre? Do the characters speak in slang?
Does the text use the serial comma and spell out numbers?
 Proper names: List all the characters. If they have pets, list those too.
List any place names mentioned, whether cities or bars or grocery
stores. Note the types of cars (or rocket ships or whatever) they drive.
Whenever you see a proper name, include it.
 Character traits of major players: What makes each character unique?
What do these people (or animals or aliens or whatever) look like?
Where did they grow up? Who did they date? Are they married? Do they
have accents? How about tattoos?
 Miscellaneous information: Who is on the cheerleading team? Do
Cameron and Cory live on the same street? Are they in the same town?
Where was the pivotal ball game, again? If the author has cleverly
weaved historical events and names into the mix, make sure Watergate
isn’t happening in the ’90s.
 Your changes: Did you add a hyphen to real-estate salesperson? Correct
the spelling of quicky mart? If so, write down the change, and note the
page number(s) where it appears. That way, if you need to go back and
undo a change for any reason, you save a lot of detective work.
80
Part II: Conquering Copyediting 

Depending on the length and breadth of a novel, your style sheet could be
extremely long and detailed, with entries the likes of Pg. 6: Amanda (Schilling,
p. 23; born El Centro, California, p. 103; married Danny, p. 104) — caramel-
colored hair, rainbow tattoo on right shoulder.
I recommend that for each entry, you include the page number of its first
occurrence in the story, as well as any information that should be kept in
mind about that entry and any places in the story that the information
changes or is updated. If you need to query a certain reference, include that
in the style sheet, too.
Sometimes you may need to make sketches of the streets, places, and even
relationships you come across. If the story establishes in Chapter One that
Chris lives in Indianapolis and Joan lives in Houston, you can’t have Chris
walking to Joan’s house in Chapter Five. And when the book opens with Aryn
marrying Leah’s brother, Teddy, you want to make sure that everybody is in
their proper familial places for the remainder of the story — unless some-
body dies or gets divorced, which you’d keep track of, too.
You use the style sheet to determine the logic and laws that guide the story,
cross-referencing resources to keep the internal world in check. If something
seems physically impossible or defies the internal logic of the novel’s world,
query it to bring the inconsistency or error to the author’s attention.
After you finally finish combing, recombing, and letting the piece set under a
hair dryer, you type up your list (if you didn’t create it electronically), alpha-
betize the entries, and submit your final product with the finished job. While
the author and editor ooh and aah at your thoroughness, you can flip your
hair back, polish your knuckles on your lapel, and toss off, “It was nuthin’.”
Handling dialogue
Speaking of nuthin’, dialogue within a work of fiction is worth talking about.
Do you speak in flawlessly constructed and grammatically perfect sentences?
I don’t. Unless you’re editing a science fiction tale, characters within a story
are expected to speak the way the rest of us do: with slang, in dialects, and
sometimes using otherwise cringe-worthy words like ain’t and uh-huh and
Wuzzup!
So, let’s go over the rules of grammar and diction in fiction: There are no
rules. The words and ways in which characters speak are part of the charac-
ters themselves, and to change them would be not to understand the story or
the author’s intent. When reading dialogue in fiction, you need to believe that
most things are there for a reason, and with the poetically licensed blessing
of the author.
81
Chapter 6: A Handful of Copyediting Specialties

That said, you could find along the way that the dialogue of a character
seems out of place with previous voice, vocabulary, or setting. Your Southern
belle may become ruffled and exclaim “Blimey! That was none too brill!” 
leading you to wonder whether the stress-inducing event in question has
inadvertently turned her cockney. And did that Civil War soldier really tell 
his buddy that he set his wristwatch by the setting sun? If he did, what to 
do? Query the offense; bring it to the author’s attention and explain why you
find it inconsistent.
Tapping into genres: Mystery, 
romance, and fantasy
One dark and stormy night, he peered into her heaving cleavage, kissed her 
eyeballs, and invited her to slay the 18-headed dragon. Each genre of fiction
has its own form, style, and subject matter. While it’s not absolutely neces-
sary that you enjoy what you’re reading, wouldn’t it be more fun if you did?
If you have a favorite sort of story, you may be one step ahead in the game of
copyediting for publishers of a particular kind.
A fiction editor should know the conventions of various genres to help a
writer meet the expectations of the publisher and, most importantly, the
audience. For example, what are some typical settings for a mystery novel?
How detailed does a fantasy reader expect a plot to be? What kinds of conflict
do romance characters come up against? How multifaceted should each sexy
siren be?
Read and analyze as many recently published books and stories as you can
that are in the genre you hope to work in. Most publishers have pages of
requirements for genre copyediting. When you get an editing job, be sure to
ask for those requirements. And even before you get an editing job, feel free
to contact a publisher to ask for them; they’re a great way to improve your
understanding of how a certain type of book is created.
Here are just a few fields of fiction and some tidbits about what kinds of mys-
teries you need to master for each:
 Elementary, my dear Watson. Mystery fiction is extremely popular
these days. It’s that nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat stuff that tears us out
of our own lives and leads us along by bread crumbs into a puzzle or
suspicious whodunit event. As the copyeditor, you keep close tabs on
the teaser information peppered along the paragraphs to substantiate
the evidence and keep coherence in check.
82
Part II: Conquering Copyediting 

 Edit your heart out. Whether you find them silly or sensuous, the satiny
soap-opera sagas of romance novels are rife with drama and happy end-
ings, making them among the more fun reads. However complex the 
plot and subplots, romance novels tend to focus on a romantic relation-
ship between two (or more) people and nearly always wrap up with an
emotionally satisfying ending. Of course, some romance authors push
the envelope with cattiness and adultery, so know what you’re getting
into — and ask to see the publisher’s guidelines for clarity.
 The plane! The plane! Fasten your seatbelt, and get ready to venture
forth into fantasy. On the outside, this fiction may seem built of fluid,
amorphous bricks of changing colors and physical properties. But the
custom-built worlds of science fiction and its kin are held to their own
laws and practices, which makes for one fascinating read. Fantasy edi-
tors must know and thoroughly understand the layers of the unique uni-
verse to enforce the particular laws that effectively suspend the
disbelief of the readers. This means steering steady words, slang, and
syntax; the facts of the futuristic themes; the voice and tone of the
drama; and the historical coherence of the place and plot.
To be an effective genre copyeditor, you must care and have respect for the
craft. Really. If you don’t truly love the work, the novelty of telling your
friends that you are a sci-fi editor will wear off more quickly than that author
can churn out the latest Attack of the Killer Mutant Fish title. If you don’t dig
the details or aren’t at least curious about it, edit something else.
Translating British Materials 
for a U.S. Audience
Someone (perhaps George Bernard Shaw — we don’t know for sure) once
described Great Britain and the United States as “two nations divided by a
common language.” The truth is, people in the United States are not always
aware of the many differences between British and American writing, even 
if they realize that favourite isn’t quite right or it’s not appropriate to refer 
to a policeman as a bobby.
Thanks in part to one Noah Webster — father of the first American 
dictionary — we Yanks may dream of living in a Monty Python world of 
boots and bonnets, but we no longer commit such talk to paper.
83
Chapter 6: A Handful of Copyediting Specialties

Considering the market
Isn’t it brill that there’s literature from across the pond that requires our
translation? Think Bridget Jones’s Diary — some Yank had to modify the lan-
guage to make sure we got it when Bridget got into her beau’s britches.
How often might you encounter this type of translation? U.S. publishers keep
an eye out for British novels that burn up the best-seller charts over yonder,
and they often want to handle the hotter titles for a U.S. audience. (Harry
Potter, anyone?) If you work for a publisher with international tendencies, you
could very well be asked to do this kind of job.
Oddly enough, I was a proofreader for the For Dummies series published in
England. I was responsible for proofreading British books to maintain the
authentic English voice, spelling, punctuation, and style — which can be
much terser than American style and favor things such as commas and
colons much more. To do that job, I had to know what British lexical and
punctuation differences needed to stay in the book and why.
Sharing a few of my favourite guidelines
Following are a handful of guidelines to help you recognize some Briticisms
and convert them to Americanisms:
 Singular and plural noun agreement: Is team a singular or plural noun?
Would you say The group are coming to a meeting? While (I hope) this
example doesn’t sound right to you, it’s perfectly acceptable to the
British ear. Pay specific attention to singular and plural noun agreement.
Use your American ear and translate collective nouns to the way you
know they should be for your audience.
 Regular and irregular verbs: He who smelt it . . . er, smelled it? This is a
tricky one. While the British allow for both regular and irregular verbs
(burnt, dreamt, smelt), Americans generally lean toward burned, dreamed,
and smelled. This goes for amid (as opposed to amidst), while (as
opposed to whilst), and among (amongst) as well.
 Hyphenation: Hugh Grant may be a heartthrob in Houston, but in
London he’s a heart-throb. The heart palpitations he creates in the
United States may be reduced by beta blockers, but in the United
Kingdom, they require beta-blockers. Many British compound nouns are
written with hyphens while their American counterparts are spelled as
open or solid compounds.
 Punctuation, period: It is not unusual to see Dr, Ms, Mr, and Jr in British
publications. Make sure to add the period for an American audience.
84
Part II: Conquering Copyediting 

 Dates: In U.K. publications, dates (whether spelled out or abbreviated)
appear in a day/month/year format. For instance, 4 July 1776 and
4/7/1776 each refer to the day we claimed our independence from
Britain (albeit not from British bands and the like). Verify and change
such dates to the U.S.-friendly month/day/year format.
 Times: Although it’s 4.40 p.m. in England, it’s 4:40 p.m. (with a colon) on
our turf.
 Measurements: Metric facts and figures must be converted to U.S. stan-
dard for an American audience. That includes kilometers, kilograms, and
Celsius.
Then there’s analyse and minimise, some strange ou combinations, and other
tricky spellings to look out for. Take a look at the following word list to taste a
sampling of British English:
 Living on the edg: Although acknowledgement and judgement are pre-
ferred in England, spell them acknowledgment and judgment for a U.S.
audience.
 The beachwear of linguists: Brits love the oe/ae digraphs in manoeuvre,
encyclopaedia, anaesthetic, and foetal. Us? We prefer the more demure
maneuver, encyclopedia, anesthetic, and fetal.
 Mind your o’s and u’s: Drop that u from behaviour, colour, honour, neigh-
bour, humour, favourite, and their ilk. Instead, use the Americanized
behavior, color, honor, neighbor, humor, and favorite.
 Be wize and memorise: Don’t go suffix soft with organise, apologise,
standardise, specialise, and analyse; try a z on for size and go organize,
apologize, standardize, specialize, and analyze.
 Taking the el: While you’ll be travelling (two ls) in London, you’ll be 
traveling (one l) in New York. Same goes for jeweler and reveler (not 
jeweller or reveller).
 M and M’s: Hey, I love BBC programmes as much as the next Yank, but in
my neck of the words it’s programs.
 Licence to confuse: Although a lawyer in the United Kingdom must have
a licence before he can be on the defence team, he’d better get a license
to sit on the U.S. defense team. Same spiel for offence and others.
 Tre wrong: In most cases, metre, centre, and theatre are British variants
and should be changed to meter, center, and theater. But be careful:
Proper nouns — Kodak Theatre, for instance — should be kept intact.
 Keep your logue in cheque: American preferences over catalogue, 
dialogue, banque, and cheque are catalog, dialog, bank, and check.
 Other errant English-isms: Tyre and pyjama can be changed to tire and
pajama. Skeptical of sceptic? You should be — it’s skeptic. Craving a
draught after ploughing your garden? No? How about a draft after
plowing? Sounds delicious.
85
Chapter 6: A Handful of Copyediting Specialties

This list is by no means exhaustive. And neither is the following list of British
words that need replacing for a U.S. publication:
 The British flat is an American apartment.
 British babies are pushed in a pram (for perambulator), but Yankee
youngsters sit pretty in strollers.
 Trolley and chemist may or may not need to be altered. Check context,
and rule out the Briticisms if the author means shopping cart and 
pharmacist.
 Trash dustbin and rubbish bin for the good ol’ trash can.
 Where’s the city centre? You can find it downtown.
 What could it mean to pull your knickers over your bum in the loo? Easy:
Pull your underwear over your bottom in the bathroom or toilet.
 From A to zed? Chiefly a British thing, zed is the letter z.
When you suspect a Briticism but cannot decipher it on your own, search the
Internet for a usage example and translate the word appropriately. Type the
word or phrase into your Google search field and then type location:UK (no
space after the colon, lowercase l). Your search will return hits from U.K. Web
sites only. Or have a copy of a good British English dictionary on hand, like
the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (Oxford University Press). For punctua-
tion differences, pick up a copy of New Hart’s Rules (the British style bible),
which is available here through Oxford University Press.
How do you know that knock-on effect is a domino effect or a Heath Robinson
machine is a Rube Goldberg machine? For extra credit, brush up on your
idioms with one of the British dictionaries for advanced learners of English,
such as the Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary (Oxford University Press),
the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (Pearson Longman), or the
Macmillan English Dictionary (Macmillan), all of which are written with a bias
toward British English but show patterns in American English too. (Don’t get
the American English–only versions of these books.)
Heading into the Kitchen
If cooking is your cup of tea, you can have your cake and edit it, too. The
recipe testers who work in labs aren’t the only people who have to be techni-
cally proficient for a cookbook to work. Recipes can easily get lost in the
translation from the cook to the book. Consider the woman who detected
something fishy in her Key lime pie, only to find that she used the called-for
tartar sauce instead of the truly needed cream of tartar. Ouch.
86
Part II: Conquering Copyediting 

Cookbooks are similar to handyman how-to books: They present a list of nec-
essary materials and step-by-step instructions on how to bring them together
into something tangible. However, many cookbooks also have narratives
woven throughout that you edit much as you would a novel.
Getting familiar with the specialty
In a loving household, dinner means more than reaching for the phone and a
take-out menu. As the world around us becomes more demanding, the art of
cooking is becoming increasingly important as a binder, holding families
together like a honey apricot glaze over diced fruit. And well-written cookbooks
not only instruct, educate, and entertain — they also become companions, as
important to our kitchens as our very hearths.
Do you notice a hint of sappiness in this intro? Cookbooks are all about the
feelings behind the food. Cookbook copyeditors pay as much attention to the
voice of the writing as they do the technical aspects of the recipes.
If you want cookbook editing to be your thing, how do you begin? At the
bookstore (or the library). Go to the cooking section, and try not be over-
whelmed. Start pulling titles from the shelves, and notice these things:
 Audience: Recipes for bachelors and slouches are far less complicated
than those for the Julia Child set.
 Consistency: How are the abbreviations for tablespoon and quarter cup
handled? Is it a Kalamata or kalamata olive? A rib eye or rib-eye steak?
Do we combine the first 4 ingredients, or four? Does the serving contain
3g or three grams of protein?
Review the list of ingredients against the steps of a recipe. Does the
recipe suddenly call for chocolate when no chocolate is included in the
ingredient list? Are the ingredients listed in the order in which they’re
called for?
 Logic and completeness: Think of the recipes as trials, and picture each
part of the experiment as you read along. You don’t need to know every-
thing about cooking to catch an error like “add two cups of salt” to a
batch of brownies. Do the steps include an oven temperature? An
approximate cooking time and numbers of servings per recipe? Are the
directions clear and consistent?
A typical cookbook contains at least 100 recipes. With that many to check,
you quickly figure out how the recipes are supposed to look and feel. And if
you need help figuring it out, a great style guide to have on hand is Recipes
into Type by Joan Whitman (Collins).

Chapter 6: A Handful of Copyediting Specialties

Formatting recipes
If you’re going to teach an old dog a new trick, you need to first record each
tool he needs for that trick. Then you need to logically explain the stages of
assembling those tools into the trick itself. The same process applies with a
recipe. Kinda.
Grab your go-to cookbook, and you’ll notice that each recipe follows the
same general format. Typically, recipes start with a brief description of the
dish, followed by a list of necessary ingredients in the order in which they are
mentioned in the recipe directions, then detailed directions — step by every
careful step — on how to create the dish. The more elaborate the dish, the
longer and more detailed the ingredient list and directions.
More elaborate cookbooks may include wine pairings, cross-references with
other recipes for full meals and dinner plans, acceptable ingredient substitu-
tions, and nutrition values for each serving. Each piece needs to be checked
for consistency and accuracy.
88
Part II: Conquering Copyediting 
Measuring up
Cookbook copyeditors need to be aware of
cooking terms and measurements. You don’t
have to be an expert on these, but some famil-
iarity may alert you when something is amiss.
Here are some equivalencies to keep in mind:
 A cup of liquid equals 8 U.S. fl. oz.
 A pint equals 2 cups.
 A quart equals 2 pints.
Formally, a dash of liquids equals about six
drops (where 76 drops make 1 teaspoon). In
most recipes, however, a dash just means a
small amount.
A handful is a term used when the amount
selected isn’t going to ruin the recipe, like adding
nuts to the top of brownies. If you must, think of
it as 1⁄2 cup — more if you want more, less if you
want less. Query the author when the use of
“handful” refers to something you wouldn’t want
to pick up, like olive oil.
A pinch is a small amount of a dry ingredient,
about 1⁄8 teaspoon or less.
A shot is a unit of alcohol, roughly 11⁄2 fl. oz.
A level spoonful has the excess scraped off with
an edge (other than your thumb, ideally). A
rounded spoonful has about as much above the
top of the spoon as below it. A heaping spoon-
ful is as much as the spoon can hold.
The three basic spoon sizes are as follows:
 Tablespoon (Tbs), 15 ml (equal to three 
teaspoons)

If the cookbook you’re asked to edit is part of a series, the publisher may
have strict guidelines for you to follow to keep the series consistent. If the
cookbook is intended to be part of a future series, it may be your responsibil-
ity as the copyeditor to create the guidelines. Lucky you!
If the publisher hasn’t furnished guidelines, keep track of the order in which
the first recipes are laid out. Are the ingredients listed first, or are they incor-
porated within the recipe directions? If the author includes comments or tips,
are they interspersed within the recipe, are they noted in a sidebar, or are
they at the end of the recipe? All these subtle variations are important to the
integrity of the book and should be consistently applied to every recipe
within it.
There’s one other thing I feel I must note: While you are welcome to actually
cook the dishes you come across in this niche, if you find that they are terri-
ble, don’t take it upon yourself to make improvements. Even if you know that
tweaking that Heirloom Tomato Sauce with balsamic vinegar — just like
Grandma’s — will save thousands of people from grimacing over pasta, keep
it to yourself.

T
his is the voyeuristic section of the book. In this chapter, I do the same sorts
of things I do when I’m copyediting alone in my office . . . while you watch.
Copyediting is different from some other disciplines — take math, for exam-
ple. In math, there’s usually just one right answer. You either get it right or
you get it wrong. And when you get it right, what’s the big deal? Most every-
body else got the same answer.
While some of copyediting deals with right and wrong answers (how many
different ways can you spell exhibitionism?), much of it has to do with using
judgment. You’re editing for structure and clarity, and there’s always more
than one way to get it right.
This is what I love about copyediting: When I’m faced with something that
doesn’t quite work, I get to suggest fixes. Fun.
You don’t believe that it can be fun? I’ll prove it. First, read the examples that
follow. Then look through my edited versions to see what changes I’ve made
and queries I’ve posed. (I’ve also included a few notes for your eyes only in
the examples.) To indicate my edits, I use marks that are similar to those a
proofreader uses (see Chapter 9).
We’ll start with you reading a short fiction piece . . . while I’m in my, um,
naughty copyeditor’s outfit.

Example One: Dabbling in Fiction
Rest assured, there’s no need for your faithful Carmine red here. I want you to
read the following example once, twice, and maybe a third time before
moving ahead to the edited version. Some things will be easier to spot than
others; some you may not see or understand at all until the end. That’s how
we figure this stuff out, right?
In this example, we need to edit for consistency, style, and grammar, keeping
in mind the following:
 We need to use a serial comma.
 We need to spell out numbers one through ninety-nine.

An excerpt from White Russian Rail by Christapher Dunbar
The train stopped at the border just after 1:00 a.m. I missed the midnight
dead-line to be out of Belarus and was now in the county without a valid
visa. I braced myself for a difficult customs interogation. However, there was
another, less-daunting purpose of the stop at the Polish border that I looked
forward to witnessing. This was the adjusting of the train’s wheelbase to
accommodate the differing widths of track used in Belarus and Poland.
Russia and its former states uses a realway gauge of five feet. It was
adopted in the 1840s when an American engineer sells the idea to the
Russia tsar. There was no standard at that time, but the rest of Europe
used, and still uses, a more narrow gauge. Some historians have hinted
92
Part II: Conquering Copyediting 

that this was an important factor in Germany’s inability to take over
Russia-they couldn’t easily get their troops beyond Poland by rail.
The Belarussian customs forms were unreadable to me. There was no
English section. Nor did I have a pen. A heavyset woman who resembled
a prison guard came to my cabin and helped me. She wrote “nyet,”
“nyet,” “nyet,” in three boxes and spoke at length in Russian about the
other boxes. I didn’t understand a thing she said, but I did the best I
could with both forms. Soon, five officials (resembing riot police)
boarded the train and came to my door. One said something that seemed
to indicate that he was already impatient with me, so I gave him my pass-
port. He exchanged glances with the others, and they took turns inspect-
ing it, no longer interested in the stack of other passports in their hands.
Mean-while the train kept moving slowly in one direction and then the
other. When it stopped between direction changes, eerie noises came
from below. It was the sound you would expect a large chain to make if it
was snapped under load. Then there was an intermittent clanging of what
had to be an enormous tool chest, dropped from a great heighth. At other
times, it sounded as though the other cars were getting sheared in half by
the jaws of a fearsome metal-munching creature. It was dark and the win-
dows were cloudy. I caught glimpses of workers toiling beneath yellows
lights. I couldn’t make out the surroundings but I noticed that the loud
noises echoed as if our train were housed in some structure with concert-
hall acoustics.
93
Chapter 7: The Copyediting Process in Action

I heard talking outside my cabin’s door—it was Russian punctuated by
the words “Washington D.C.,” “American” and “Dollars.” Finally, a calm,
savy-looking riot-police chief came in and sat down next to me. “Where.
Are you. From,” he asked, in a way that made me feel that I had already
lied to him.
“The United States,” I said with out any hint of deception.
“Why are you traveling in Belarussia?”
“I am a tourist.”
“Tourist, yes,” he contemplated. “May I see . . .” he took my declaration
papers off the table. “Do you have any other money. Russian rubles,
Belarussian rubles.” His questions lacked the inflection of inquiry. Rather
they fell flat, like statements.
“I do have less than one million Belarussian rubles.” This wasn’t much
money, but more than I wanted to forfeit.
“Where is your first declaration papers.” “I don’t have any.”
“You were given such papers when you came to Belarussia.”
“I came to Belarus by trian from St. Petersburg. There was no one to greet
me when I passed through the border.” This was true.
“I see,” he said slowly.  “Do you know it is illegal to take Belarussian
ruble’s out of the country. You cannot do this, you see.”

The final shakedown, I thought. I countered with, “I thought I might buy
something to eat on the food car.”
Our conversation continued like this. He would point out something
questionale, I gave some lame excuse that he didn’t seem to care about,
and then he would let the initial objection drop. When I described the
contents of my luggage to him. He became overly concerned that the only
gift that was given to me during my visit to Belarous was hand tooled
wooden box. He felt Belarussian clothing would make a nice present for a
“nice man” such as myself. I agreed wholeheartedly. After a lengthy dis-
cussion about nothing much in particular, he decided the rubles I was
taking out of the country would not be a problem after all. Then he shook
my hand and left. He did not return my passport. This was the adjusting
of the train’s wheelbase to accommodate the differing widths of track
used in Belarus and Poland.
I heard more breaking of large metal pieces and the pounding and
whirring of some kind of motor. I closed my eyes and tried to sleep. Ten
minutes later, the chief came back in. “Excuse me.” he stated, “How did
you enjoy the country of Belarussia.”
“I . . .” I didn’t know what to make of this second visit, but told him, “I
thought it was wonderful.” We continued our chat where we left off and
he spoke passionately about the language of Belarus, which was becom-
ing outlawed by the Belarussian president, Lukashenko, and how it would
always be spoken—even if Russia and Belarus joined again. He pointed
95
Chapter 7: The Copyediting Process in Action

out differences in the pronounciations of words and told me there were
areas in Russia where everyone still spoke Belarussian. I told him more
about my visit. He thanked me and we shook hands. Then and he left
again. Still no passport.
I watched the workers through the window. I could now see that the train
was in a large barracks-style structure. It was wide enough for three sets
of tracks, running parallel. 1 by 1, the train cars were separated and ele-
vated. The jacks were ten-to-twelve-feet tall and mounted in concrete.
They were operated by a vertical screw, roughly eight feet high.  It resem-
bled the hose used by coin-operated vaccum cleaners that you see at car
washes. At the bottom of the screw was a motor with a housing the size
of a quarter beer keg. I watched as my car rolled into position. Four jacks,
one at each corner, began to lift the car. Beneath the car was a section of
both the five-foot-wide track and the narrower-with track, running
between it. The workspace was a huge pit, like you would see at an auto-
motive lube shop. While the screws turned, railway police paced the
yard, perhaps looking for double agents. Heavy men with beefy arms
slaved over the manual part of the process and struggled with the jacks.
Along the side of the track ran a cable pulley system. It was in constant
operation but did not have a purpose I could discern. At the ends of my
car, I saw the connecting cars sitting slightly below me, at ground level. I
could not see how long the barracks structure was.
96
Part II: Conquering Copyediting 

The cars were eventually rejoined with all the noise and enthusiasm of
their separation. The train lurched forward, then backward, then
stopped. Outside, a tone sounded and a tired voice came back on the PA
system. It was a woman speaking in either Russian or Polish, but it was
too muffled to know for sure
We sat there for almost an hour longer. Then the riot-police chief came
back in. “I think you have nothing to declare,” he told me. His eyes were
red.
“Yes, that is true,” I feigned a smile.
“I think you are a happy man,” he said sincerely. He reeked of booze.
“Well, my visit has made me happy,” I said, trying not to appear alarmed.
“I think the Belarussian people are the best people.” He was swaying and
had had to prop himself against the doorway to keep his balance. “And I
hope to see you again. Not in minsk but outside in the country. Like Brest.
It is really wonderful country.”
And I was like, “I hope so too.”
We shook hands for a third and final time. He left, and the official to
whom I initially gave my Passport appeared. Before giving it back to me,
she made me stand so she could check beneath the bench—perhaps for
stowaways. There were none.

Wrap-up
Be advised that my edits to the above piece reflect what I feel is required to
make this story clear and readable. My personal style, generally, is not to 
edit heavily. Other copyeditors may have wanted more clarity in what was
happening in the train yard. Others may have taken issue with the deliber-
ately mispunctuated quotations. It’s really up to the individual reading it to
decide what direction a piece should take. And bear in mind that if the author 
doesn’t want to accept the suggested changes, it’s the author’s right to do 
so (although the author should be prepared to explain why).
Example Two: Touching 
on Technical Writing
Read the following technical writing example a few times before venturing on
to the edited version. And don’t be discouraged if you don’t catch everything
on the first try.
For this example, our goal is to edit for consistency, style, and grammar,

1.75-inch non-skid appliqués are attached to the bottom of the plastic base;
the sand and appliqués prevent the tape dispenser from moving when tape

both sides) and is designed to fit within the one-inch core of a roll of .75-
inch one-sided stickie tape, while the tape spindle is pushed into the core
of the tape roll until the spindle is snug within the core and the spindle
arms are seen on both sides of the tape roll, such that with the sticky side
of the tape roll facing down, the arms of the tape spindle are placed into
the l-shaped notches in the tape-dispenser base. If placed within the
notches correctly, the spindle will whip around allowing the tape to be

Chapter 7: The Copyediting Process in Action

Wrap-up
As in the first example, many of the corrections I made here were no-brainers:
a comma that should have been a period or a misspelled word. But other 
corrections required a decision to be made; something wasn’t working, and
there were a few ways to fix it. Copyeditors are faced with these decisions
every day. And they become easier to make over time.
So now that you know how I work, I have one request to make: Get that image
of me with the sharpened pencil to my lip out of your head. You’ll be disap-
pointed to know that my naughty copyeditor’s outfit is more like sweat pants,
a ratty T-shirt, and a pair of hideous footies with rubber soles my mom gave
me a few birthdays ago.

sionally printed items can be laden with so many errors — especially when
you consider that the people printing them should know that their sloppiness
brings into question how much care they’re putting into other details of their
business, like meat refrigeration.
The good news: By spotting the occasional misspelling, you already know
you don’t have to be a word nerd to be able to correct the mistakes littering
the printed world around us. You just have to pay attention. And there are
rewards to noticing mistakes. Catching an embarrassing typo in a theater pro-
gram gives you something to chuckle about during intermission. Spotting that
same error when you’re the publicist’s proofreader can mean job security.
Proofreading is not gene-splicing. Attentive people can perform it adeptly after
some stimulating lessons and several practice tests. Proofreaders are normal
people like you and me. Cast aside the image of the serious, bifocaled loner
surrounded by heavy tomes, blue pencils, and fine wines. (Well, you can keep
the wines if you want.) You don’t have to fit any certain mold to be a proof-
reader. You just need to enjoy reading (and you’ve made it this far, so you can’t
hate it, right?), tuck a few guidelines under your belt, and be able to focus on
what you’re doing. This chapter gets you headed in the right direction.

Separating the Proofreader 
from the Copyeditor
As I show in Part II of this book, copyeditors analyze, process, and transform
copy into intelligible, easy-to-understand prose. They look at the big picture.
They ask questions like “What’s the author trying to say?” and “How will the
reader best understand him?” Proofreaders, on the other hand, pore over
every last letter and shred of punctuation to hammer the copy into error-free
perfection.
To look at it another way, if publishing were like getting dressed in the morn-
ing, the copyeditor would review the chosen outfit, bearing in mind the
weather and what the day’s agenda entails. She may decide on different
shoes or a wider belt. She may pick out a different jacket. She may even sug-
gest an entire wardrobe change. She examines the overall appearance and
makes suggestions to create the nicest-looking ensemble that ever stood in
front of the bedroom mirror. The proofreader then waltzes in and points out
the deodorant marks on the shirt.
What Does a Proofreader Look For?
Proofreaders don’t see things the way other people do. We scrutinize. When
something is awry, our warning buzzer goes off, and we swoop down for a
better look. We are charged with catching the errors that everyone, including
the copyeditor, has missed.
What separates good proofreaders from bad is practice. The more you do it,
the better (and faster) you become at catching errors.
Recognizing common errors
Proofreaders check for many of the same things copyeditors do; see the dis-
cussion of mechanical errors in Chapter 4. But proofreaders put an extra
emphasis on catching the kinds of errors others are likely to miss:
 Alignment: Proofreaders scan margins, bulleted lists, and everything
else that is supposed to align with something else.
 Alphabetized lists and sequences: Proofreaders have a field day cor-
recting lists that are improperly alphabetized. For them, alphabetizing
lists is like shooting fish in a barrel.
112
Part III: Picking Up a Proofreading Career 

 Captions: Proofreaders know that captions on photos and illustrations
are often not reviewed carefully by others. Copyeditors may intend to go
back and read captions after completing the editing of the main copy,
but they often forget to.
 Columns: Proofreaders always make certain that columns are formatted
correctly.
 Dates: Dates are notorious for being incorrect. When a day of the week is
mentioned with a date, proofreaders always check the calendar to make
sure that the day of the week and the date correspond.
 Headlines: Proofreaders double-check headlines. When a headline has
an error, you don’t want to be the person who missed it.
 Numbers: It’s easy for writers to mistype a number. Proofreaders review
them carefully — especially if they are connected to dollar signs.
 Spelling of names: Proofreaders check the spelling of personal and 
organizational names against other sources (such as Web sites) when
possible.
If copyeditors are the gatekeepers charged with protecting copy against bad
writing, proofreaders stamp the admission tickets.
Proofreaders try to keep the above elements consistent with the style of the
particular publisher for whom they are working. As I explain in detail in
Chapter 15, the house style, or style sheet, is a printed document that shows
how particular parts of language should be written (such as using one space
after a period, not two). When an element isn’t addressed by the style sheet,
the publisher has a particular style guide to follow, such as The New York
Times Manual of Style and Usage. The style guide explains things like when to
use “each other” and when to use “one another.” Lastly, the publisher has a
preferred dictionary to give the final word on spelling.
When a proofreader is in doubt about anything, he should look it up, making
sure to obey the hierarchy of resources:
1. House style sheet
2. Style guide
3. Dictionary
Pointing out not-so-great writing
Like copyeditors, proofreaders should recognize when a sentence lacks that
je ne sais quoi (French for “was this translated from an extraterrestrial lan-
guage?”) and be able to politely suggest improvements.
113
Chapter 8: So, What Does a Proofreader Do?

Here’s just one example of the kind of improvement a proofreader may make:
Original: There were some awards I won at camp, such as “largest fish
caught” and “best kisser.”
Revised: At camp, I won such awards as “largest fish caught” and “best
kisser.”
These sentences say the same thing, but the second one is more active, a
little tighter, and more confident. A proofreader notices when a sentence can
be worded more effectively and may suggest how to fix it.
However, keep in mind that this level of work isn’t always expected of — or
encouraged from — proofreaders. In some work situations, proofreaders are
asked to stick to correcting errors. If you get the message from your
employer or client that suggestions for rewording are beyond the scope of
your position, take that message to heart.
Reviewing stuff the copyeditor never sees
Not only is the proofreader’s job different in scope than the copyeditor’s, but
it also occurs at a different stage of the production process. Where, exactly,
the proofreader comes into play depends on whether you’re working with
books or magazines.
In book production, the proofreader appears on the scene later than the
copyeditor does, after a copyedited book manuscript has been set into 
galleys (typeset pages). For an overview of the book production process,
see Chapter 2.
The privileged book proofreaders get to read through an almost-finished
product in a recognizable format. They get all the extra goodies that a copy-
editor usually doesn’t see: aligned margins, running heads and feet, the front
matter already laid out . . . (If you don’t know what running heads, feet, and
front matter are, take a quick read through Chapter 13 where I discuss the
anatomy of books and magazines.)
Because book proofreaders see laid-out proofs, they can catch things like
problems with alignment or inconsistent running heads and feet. They review
tables of contents complete with page numbers, indexes, graphs, and other
in-text elements created by the compositor based on the copyeditor’s coding
(see Chapter 16) . . . all elements that are finalized when a publication is type-
set. The proofreader bears primary responsibility for catching errors intro-
duced after copy is transformed into galleys, so don’t ever doubt the value of
the proofreader’s role.
114
Part III: Picking Up a Proofreading Career 

In magazine production, the proofreader may get to see laid-out pages and
play a similar role as a book proofreader, checking heads and subheads, call-
outs and captions. But that’s not always the case; some magazine proofread-
ers do their work before the layout is done. For an overview of the magazine
production process, be sure to check out Chapter 3.
Testing Various Ways to Read
When you’re trying to find your keys in the morning, and they’re not material-
izing, there are different ways to search for them. You can scan all the places
you left them in the past. You can check all your purses (or messenger bags).
You can rifle through your laundry, checking the pockets of everything
you’ve worn in the past week. You can even ask your pacing husband if he
has seen them. And as a last resort, you can frantically overturn every manu-
script, open book, and loose scrap of paper covering your desk, office floor,
and window sill and shout to no one in particular, “This doesn’t make sense, I
just had them last night!” (Okay, maybe that last one’s just me.)
There are also different ways to proofread a document. You should try all the
techniques I mention here as you home in on the method that works for you:
 Scan it first: To familiarize yourself with a new document, start by skim-
ming the first page in its entirety, taking into account such things as
whether the paragraph spacing is consistent, whether the copy is justi-
fied or aligned left, and whether the quotes and apostrophes are straight
or curly. After you do so, you can then go back for a more detailed read.
 Slow it down: Start out by reading your document slowly — much more
slowly than you read for pleasure. Consider the spelling of each word.
When you get to punctuation, ask yourself if that (comma, semicolon,
hyphen, whatever) belongs there. Make sure there is subject–verb agree-
ment. Look at the small words (a, of, the). Notice capitalization. Stop at
every number and question whether it should be spelled out or in
numeral form. Think hard about each sentence you are reading. When
you get to something that is confusing, write a query to the author or
editor. Then try some other reading methods.
 Pump it up: Read the document aloud. Your ear may catch mistakes that
your eyes miss. Speak each word, pause at each comma, and emphasize
each number. If people are around, move one arm dramatically and pre-
tend to be rehearsing a scene for a play.
 Stretch it out: Read the document at arm’s length. (This method works
best with hard copy; your arms may get tired holding your PC this way.)
Pay attention to the overall look of each page. Notice the spaces
between chapters and paragraphs. Notice the margins and white space
115
Chapter 8: So, What Does a Proofreader Do?

around photographs. Look for errant typefaces or font sizes. See if any
captions, labels, or legends are missing. This perspective lets you visual-
ize the shapes of the components of the document.
 Turn it upside down: Flip the page; that’s a great way to catch bad
breaks, weird fonts, and the like.
 Inch your way: Place a ruler beneath the text you are reading. (Again,
hard copy is best here; we don’t want you to scratch your computer
monitor.) Move it down, line by line, as you read. Doing so ensures that
you don’t skip ahead before you have considered each line.
 Don’t look back: As an alternative to “inch your way,” place a ruler
above each line of copy to prevent yourself from rereading any lines.
Move the ruler down the page in a steady sweep and force your eyes to
stay a step ahead.
 Pace yourself: Hold your finger under the word you are looking at. As
you read, sweep your finger across the page in a slow and rhythmic
pace. Force your eyes to keep pace with your finger.
 Race yourself: When you feel ready to speed things up, place a finger at
the top left corner of the page, and move it down the left margin in a
steady sweep. Try to keep your eyes scanning fast enough to keep up.
 Reverse yourself: A great way to sleuth for spelling errors is to read a
document backwards. This method forces you to analyze each word
individually and not in the context of the words around it. This tech-
nique is excellent for résumés. (It may be a bit unrealistic for a novel.)
The last thing you want to do when proofreading is sacrifice accuracy for
speed. Focus on each page, each paragraph, each word as long as you need
to, until you are comfortable it is correct. With time, your proofreading speed
will naturally increase.
The best thing you can do to improve your proofreading skills is to keep read-
ing. Whether your medium of choice is Web sites, newspapers, or books of
varying genres, cranking up the amount of material you read will train your
eyes to quickly spot the difference between right and rite. Newspapers and
magazines, in particular, provide excellent proofreading practice. They get
you used to reading copy in bite-size chunks, and they familiarize you with
current expressions and common terminology.
Honing Your Skills
In this section, I offer suggestions for how to pump up your proofing skills in
anticipation of your first jobs. For lots of job-hunting tips, including ideas for
getting proofreading practice to tout on your résumé, be sure to check out
Chapter 18.

Part III: Picking Up a Proofreading Career 

Taking training courses
Of course, I’d like to believe that the wisdom contained in this book is all you
need to fulfill your dream of becoming the world’s best and most profitable
proofreader. But even I admit that sometimes other training resources can be
invaluable.
Training courses are a great investment of your time (and sometimes your
money) for two reasons: One, they help you improve your proofreading skills;
two, they provide you with tests similar to those that potential employers
use to determine whether to hire you.
One-day or several-day training courses are often available for free through
temp agencies. This is particularly true in larger cities because law firms and
big corporations always need freelance proofreaders. You can also take pri-
vate proofreading courses that connect you with temp agencies after you’re
done. If you live in a bigger city, this is a great opportunity. While you may
not be reading the most thrilling material, this sort of intense training quickly
gives you skills and experience that you can easily translate into freelance
employment. You can find local proofreading courses through Internet search
engines using keywords like “proofreading course” or “[name of your city],”
“class,” and “proofreader.”
Proofreading for fun (and experience)
If you can’t get proofreading work because you’ve got no experience, and you
can’t get experience because you’ve got no proofreading work, you’ve got a
conundrum. Here’s a secret to get the ball rolling: Your first jobs will be on
the house. That’s right, gratis. You bite the bullet, proofread some jobs for
free, and keep track of every title you work on. These projects will become
the “experience” section of your résumé.
And where do the jobs come from? You guessed it: your peeps. And your
peeps’ peeps. The art of networking through friends and family is a time-
honored tradition, and there isn’t any crowd who will be more forgiving when
you blow a deadline. Start by making contact with everyone whose name
appears in your cell phone, your e-mail address book, and your Palm Pilot.
Don’t leave anyone out; if an old friend isn’t interested, he may know some-
one who is.
Your message can simply be something like this:
117
Chapter 8: So, What Does a Proofreader Do?

Friends, I am beginning my proofreading career. Right now, to gain different
kinds of experience, I’m looking for any sort of project that needs a second
eye.
A start-up business owner may want you to proofread a new brochure. A
restaurant manager may ask you to review a menu. A student may tap you to
review a thesis or dissertation. You may even come across a friend of a friend
in the publishing industry who is willing to let you shadow her for a day.
Whatever happens, understand that people you know are writing things
every day, and much of what they write could use your help.
Most people you know, whether they care about their writing or not, want
their résumés to be flawless. Knowing this fact makes it easy to pick up side
jobs. When someone tells you he is looking for a new job, reply (as noncha-
lantly as you can muster), “Hmm, I proofread résumés on the side. If you’re
interested, I could take a look at yours.” Then act bored.

Mastering the 
Proofreading Symbols
In This Chapter
 Discovering the core symbols
 Correcting punctuation
 Finagling format
 Focusing on layout
Just as carpentry has its tools to assemble sturdy buildings, so, too, does
the blissful world of editing have tools for assembling solid communica-
tions. Proofreading marks are shorthand symbols and notes to get your point
across as clearly and consistently as possible. Though the symbols may vary
slightly among companies or style books, the ones I present in this chapter
are standard enough to be recognizable to people in the know (and even
some who aren’t).
But just as you wouldn’t pick up a hammer and immediately begin pounding
away (or would you?), you need to study how to use a proofreader’s tools. In
this chapter, I divide the proofreading symbols into four categories:
 Core symbols that change the actual words
 Symbols that change or insert punctuation into the text
 Symbols that change the look or format of the text
 Symbols that affect or change the page layout
Here, I introduce you to each symbol’s purpose and how it’s drawn. In
Chapters 10 and 11, I offer lots of examples of the symbols in use.

Covering Some Basics
Let me be clear: The information in this chapter applies specifically to proof-
reading jobs done on paper (or hard copy). If you’re asked to proofread a doc-
ument electronically, you won’t be using these symbols; you’ll be making (or
at least suggesting) changes to the typewritten words. For the scoop on
working with electronic documents, please see Chapter 17.
Before I jump into the proofreading symbols themselves, here are a few notes
to tuck away in that memory bank for future reference:
 If your penmanship isn’t anything to write home about (cough, cough),
you want to be especially careful in drawing your marks and printing
your notes. Directions are worthless if they’re not understood.
Be aware of your handwriting: If you tend to use a mixture of capital and
lowercase letters, you have to train yourself to be very precise in the
use of only what you want to see set by the compositor. A compositor
will set an uppercase letter in the middle of a lowercase word if that’s
what you write.
 In especially messy documents, you may find yourself needing to insert
and delete letters, and possibly make other changes, all within the small
space of one word. Rather than muck up an already muddy manuscript,
use the simplest mark you can muster to clean it up. For example, rather
than attempt to fix every mistake in conshienshus, cross out the whole
enchilada and rewrite conscientious above it.
 You use the symbols shown in this chapter to draw attention to text that
needs correcting. But your actual corrections — the letters or words 
to be inserted, for example, or your notes to boldface or underline the
text — are written in the margin.
For lines that contain more than one error, you write the corrections in
the order in which they occur, separating each with a slash (/). If the
same error occurs twice in one line, with no other errors in between,
you can use a double slash (//) after your margin note to alert the com-
positor to repeat the correction (or a triple slash if the error appears
three times in a row). I also use a final slash after that last margin note
on each line, just to assure the compositor that there is only one
instance of that error — that I haven’t simply forgotten to include the
slash. Don’t worry: I show you examples of what I mean later in this
chapter, as well as in Chapters 10 and 11.
Keep in mind that some proofreaders use different methods of alerting
the compositor to multiple corrections of the same type of error. Instead
of using multiple slashes after the margin note, a proofreader may write
“x2” or “x3” next to the margin note, for example. And some proofread-
ers may not add a slash after the final margin note on each line. There is
120
Part III: Picking Up a Proofreading Career 

no single correct way to communicate with a compositor; in this book, I
show you what I do, but you may need to adjust your notation style to
follow the protocol of your employer or client.
The Core Symbols
The core symbols are those that any proofreader (or copyeditor) worth her
salt knows and uses on an every-reading basis. Toss that salt over your
shoulder, and let’s get started.
Insert
In general, the caret symbol (^) is used as a big “Insert something here!” sign
to add missing letters, words, whole sentences, or punctuation.
To insert a missing letter, you plant a caret just under the space in a word
where the letter is missing, and then you write the inserted letter(s) in the
margin. (If it won’t make things too messy, I often write the inserted letter
above the word as well.) What about when an entire word is missing? In that
case, simply plant your caret between two words.
On occasion, an entire sentence or paragraph may be missing, in which case
you won’t have enough room in the margin to insert the missing text. Write
Insert text from back of page in the margin, and circle it; then write the missing
text on the back of the page where there’s plenty of room. If the text needs to
be cut and pasted from a different place in the material, write in the margin
Insert text from page X, and circle it. If you need even more space for the
material to be inserted, use separate sheets of paper, numbered consecu-
tively and inserted after the page in question. If a lot of new material is to be
inserted between pages 101 and 102, for example, number the pages of new
material 101a, 101b, and so on.
If you are making a comment in the margin, you must circle it so the composi-
tor does not set what you write.
Yup, I see it. This sentence is defintely mising letters. There seems be a
word missing, too. Good thing we can fil them in usng carets.
121
Chapter 9: Mastering the Proofreading Symbols

Delete
Show your artsy side with the easiest of all marks. A squiggly scribble or
hash mark through a letter, a word, a sentence, or punctuation in copy indi-
cates that the information needs to be scrapped.
To delete letters, words, sentences, or punctuation, draw a horizontal line
through the text to be removed. After you’ve struck through the offending
text, continue drawing the line up and around in a curlicue. Then draw the
curlicue again in the margin next to that line. Make sure to precisely mark the
letter(s) or word(s) to be deleted so additional copy is not inadvertently
removed.
If an entire block of text (such as a paragraph or a page) needs to be deleted,
simply circle the entire block of text and draw a curlicue on the top right side
of the circle. Then repeat your trusty curlicue sign in the margin.
Close up
To close up or delete a space within a word or sentence, nestle the space
between the two parts of this symbol.
Draw the close-up symbol above and below the two parts of the word or sen-
tence to be connected, closing them up like a clam. Then draw the close-up
symbol again in the margin.
Some common errors dealing with closing up involve words that are used
slightly differently depending on whether they are spelled as one word or two:
every day and everyday; any one and anyone; some time and sometime; fare
well and farewell; on line and online; melt down and meltdown. Spell-checking
programs won’t pick up these errors, so it’s up to you to catch them.
Regard less of your skill level, you will be able to find the er rors a long
this line by sheer in stinct.
Are there too many many words here? How about here? This is example
is tricky, especially if one doesnít’ read it carefully.
122
Part III: Picking Up a Proofreading Career 

Delete and close up
Ah, a marriage of convenience . . . close up is most often used after you have
indicated a deletion.
To delete and close up text, use the delete symbol to delete the undesired
text, and draw the close-up clam shape to connect the two undeleted parts.
In the margin, draw the curlicue and surround it with the close-up marks.
Space
Within the proofreading realm, the pound sign (#) is used to indicate that a
space must be added to the text.
To add a space, draw a vertical line between the letters to be spaced. Then in
the margin, draw the pound sign, which looks like a miniature tic-tac-toe
board. (I often draw the pound sign at the top of the vertical line in the text
as well.)
When two letters or two words are just a bit too crowded, you can insert a
hairline space, which is a fraction of the full space. Simply draw a vertical line
between the letters or words to be separated, write hair # in the margin, and
circle it.
Transpose
Lord of the Files? A large chunk of the errors you find will involve the inadver-
tent switching of letters or words. Use this symbol to smooth out transposi-
tion errors in one fell swoosh.
Everyone of the students took the courseon writing. This helped them
farewell on the test.
I am crosssing my fingers that you’ll find thee three errors within thiis
sentence.
123
Chapter 9: Mastering the Proofreading Symbols

To transpose letters, entire words, or sentences, draw what looks like an S on
its side around the text to be flipped, then write tr in the margin and circle it.
Transposition errors are so common that you’ll quickly get familiar with the
more infamous pairs: form and from, bear and bare, best and bets, causal and
casual, discrete and discreet, tries and tires, and so on. Keep your eyes peeled
for them.
Spell out
Is it 10 or ten? TV or television? Well, that all depends on the house style or
style guide (see Chapter 14). But if the text says TV and the style guide says
television, you need to indicate that the text must be spelled out. As a general
rule, abbreviations are shunned in running copy, acting a bit like pebbles in a
somewhat smooth road. In most cases, you want to spell them out.
To indicate that text should be spelled out, circle the text to be spelled out.
Write sp in the margin and circle it.
In running copy and dialogue, words and numbers are spelled out unless it’s
cumbersome to do so (such as with years, phone numbers, and addresses)
or unless something is conventionally represented numerically (such as a
hotel room or highway number). Many house styles spell out the following:
whole numbers from one to nine; round numbers, like one thousand or a mil-
lion; and numbers that begin sentences. Consult your house style, and —
most importantly — be consistent.
Cases: Upper, lower, and small (oh my!)
Incorrect letter casing happens, but there’s a symbol to fix every situation.

He will being to learn the basics, form the start of the course to the ned.
124
Part III: Picking Up a Proofreading Career 

Creating capital letters
To indicate capital letters, place three lines underneath the text to be capital-
ized. Then write cap in the margin and circle it.
See Chapter 12 for some guidelines on when capitalization is required.
Changing caps to lower case
To indicate lowercase letters, draw a diagonal line through the letter to be
lowercased, from the top right to the bottom left. If more than one consecu-
tive letter needs to be lowercased, draw your diagonal line through the first
letter and extend the line across the top of the remaining letters. Then in the
margin, write lc and circle it.
Marking small caps
To indicate small caps, draw two lines under the text to be small-capped, and
write and circle sc in the margin.
Small caps are often used for AM and PM; for slogans, such as VIRGINIA IS FOR
LOVERS; for logos, emblems, and signs, such as CLOSED FOR RENOVATION; and for
newspaper headlines — KENNEDY WINS!
Equal space
Every relationship needs space, but unequal space between letters and
words throws the coherent relationship of a sentence and paragraph out of
whack.
Though she didn’t put it on until well after 3 a.m., Sue’s ironic tee made
everybody laugh. It read I’m With Stupid.

in town.
Last I heard, jason lived in New york city, but he’s always wanted to move
to budapest.
125
Chapter 9: Mastering the Proofreading Symbols

To indicate that space should be equalized, place a caret under the problem-
atic space. Also, place carets under the spaces between the words on either
side of the problematic space, and write eq in the margin. This type of correc-
tion is much easier shown than said.
Stet (let it stand)
Everybody makes mistakes, even (gulp!) proofreaders. Here’s your chance to
override any editorial or other changes you have indicated, using this mark
to reinstate original text and say “Ignore any changes made.”
To stet a change, draw dots in a horizontal line underneath the text to be
reinstated, and write stet in the margin and circle it.
After the first edit of a manuscript, the manuscript is returned to the author
or editor. If the author or editor wishes to override any of your changes, he
or she will request that you stet the original, meaning that you must return
the text to what it was or check to make sure the original text is reinserted.
Punctuation Symbols
What are punctuation symbols? The symbols you use to insert punctuation
into running copy. Easiest explanation all day. For some handy reminders
about when and how to use punctuation marks, check out Chapter 12.
Comma
Pause and take a breather, why don’t you. Commas are the most frequently
used punctuation marks, and they’re our cue to take a breath or pause in
thought. Though comma use is often preferential, the current wisdom is to
use commas sparingly. Check your house style for a comma entry before you
get going.
The singer k.d. lang prefers to see her name without capitalization.
Melinda wandered through the halls  of the museum, looking for history.
She couldn’t find   him anywhere.
126
Part III: Picking Up a Proofreading Career 

To place a comma, put a caret where the comma is needed, then draw a
comma beneath the caret. Repeat this action in the margin.
There’s some controversy over that little thing called a serial comma: a
comma used before the last entry in a series. (It actually appears before the
word and or or.) While some style guides call for the serial comma (The
Chicago Manual of Style, for example), others prefer not to use the serial
comma, unless — confusingly enough — doing so avoids confusion. (The New
York Times Manual of Style and Usage owns this explanation.) Lucky for you,
your house style should include an entry on serial commas — be sure to
check it.
Period
You can’t escape this punctuation mark — period. Periods are everywhere
within a document: at the end of every sentence; within many abbreviations,
such as Jr., Sr., P.M., B.C., Inc., Mrs., D.D.S., and Ph.D.; and in lists, including
footnotes and endnotes. And, in triplicate, they comprise an ellipsis.
To place a period, put a period in the text where it is needed and circle it —
like a bullseye. Repeat this symbol in the margin.
Most acronyms and initialisms — USA, SAT, and LSD, for example — do not
require periods. Always check your house style or style guide for preferred
usage.
If a sentence ends with an abbreviation, no additional period is needed.
Semicolons and colons
Don’t let semicolons and colons frighten you — they’re pretty easy to figure
out. See Chapter 12 if you need more details about when to use them.
Every sentence takes a period, Mrs Smith.
After a two-hour drive we finally reached the beach where we
enjoyed the best tacos I’ve ever tasted.

Placing semicolons
A semicolon is used to mark a more distinct break in thought than conveyed
by a comma. It is often used with compound lists or series, as in the sentence
Jennifer Lopez has been spotted in San Juan, Puerto Rico; New York, New York;
Los Angeles, California; and Rome, Italy. The semicolon is also used to con-
nect closely related independent sentences: I am planning to visit China; my
plans, however, are preliminary.
To place a semicolon, draw a semicolon and surround it with carets above
and below. Repeat this action in the margin. (Note that some proofreaders
circle the semicolon in the margin rather than using carets.)
The mere mention of comma splices makes some of us shudder. They occur
when a comma is used to join two complete sentences, as in the sentence I
can do anything I want, I’m a freethinking human being. This is an error. (Well,
not the freethinking human being part.) Here, a semicolon should be used: I
can do anything I want; I’m a freethinking human being.
Marking colons
A colon is used after a sentence to introduce material or a clause that illus-
trates or adds details to the sentence, such as an explanation, example, or
list. It is used when expressing time (12:00 noon), biblical references (Genesis
1: 2–4), and some ratios (2:4). It is also used to introduce subtitles, as in
Finding Memo: My Life of Corporate Communications.
To place a colon, draw a colon and surround it with carets above and
beneath. Repeat this action in the margin. (Note that some proofreaders
circle the colon in the margin rather than using carets.)
One of the most common errors you will see is the use of a semicolon rather
than a colon to introduce a list. Be on the lookout.
Depending on house style or your preferred style guide, the first word after a
colon may be capitalized when what follows the colon is a complete sentence.
The following are benefits of colon cleansing purifying vital inner organs,
eliminating toxic waste, and alleviating skin problems.
As a child, I hated to go to bed early, I thought all the fun stuff happened
after I fell asleep.

Ellipses
Where were we again . . . oh, that’s right: ellipses. Ellipses are used to indicate
an omission of words or letters or a trailing off of thought.
To indicate ellipses, draw three dots — like three periods — in the text, and
circle them, placing vertical lines between them to indicate spaces in the
ellipses. Repeat these marks in the margin. You may also use a caret to indi-
cate where to place the ellipsis.
Publishing and word-processing software often convert ellipses to a con-
densed format (...). More often than adding ellipses, you will need to replace
these condensed ellipses with properly spaced ones. To correct ellipses,
draw vertical lines between the dots of the ellipses; in the margin, write eq #
to indicate that space in the ellipses should be equalized.
Occasionally, four dots will appear when ellipses are used at the end of a sen-
tence or when completing a thought; see Chapter 12 for an explanation. And
when in doubt, check the reigning style guide for preferred usage.
Dashes: Long, longer, and longest
Hyphens, en dashes, em dashes . . . do people really care how long a dash is?
Well, yes, some people do. And the people who issue your paychecks are
probably among that group. Let’s talk about which length of dash you use in
which situation, so everyone can find you dashing.
Handling hyphens
The shortest of the dashes, the hyphen is used in — duh — hyphenated
words (think self-confident, ex-wife) and compound modifiers (red-faced,
chocolate-covered).
To indicate a hyphen, draw what looks like an equal sign (=) in the text, and
repeat this symbol in the margin. And, class, it’s good practice to put a caret
underneath to draw attention to the hyphen.
She opened the door and was at a loss for words. “You’ve ,” she began,
“you’ve got to be kidding! It’s so um amazing!”
129
Chapter 9: Mastering the Proofreading Symbols

Inserting the en dash
The en dash got its name because the dash is roughly the same width as the
letter n in that typeface. An en dash is most commonly used to show ranges,
such as ranges of pages, dates, and periods of time. It is also used in place of the
hyphen in compound modifiers in which one of the elements is an open com-
pound (think New York in New York–Paris flight and Cold War in post–Cold War).
To indicate an en dash, draw the number 1 over a letter n in the text, almost
like a fraction. Repeat this symbol in the margin. A caret can be necessary at
times for clarity. Use your judgment.
Feeling overwhelmed by dashes and hyphens? Train your brain to remember
the en dash by associating it with the letter n for number: numbers of pages,
numbers in dates, and numbers in time ranges.
Indicating the em dash
The em dash is roughly the same width as the letter m in that typeface. An
em dash is used to separate subordinate clauses in sentences in which
commas are also used or in which there is an abrupt change in continuity.
To indicate an em dash, draw the number 1 over a letter m in the text, kind of
like a fraction. If necessary point a caret from below for clarity. Repeat this
symbol in the margin. If house style forbids spaces around an em dash, sur-
round the margin note with the close-up symbol.
The guy on the subway this morning the one in the Viking helmet and
bright red roller skates couldn’t figure out why we pointed and stared at
him.

London Paris train, trying to hock his pre Civil War musket.
There was a break in through the basement level window of my great
aunt’s house. The barking of her next door neighbor’s jet black dogs
prompted the screaming of their 14 month old baby.
130
Part III: Picking Up a Proofreading Career 

Some publishing and word-processing software automatically correct double
hyphens (--) with an em dash. These programs are not infallible, however, so
keep a lookout for double hyphens where em dashes belong.
Apostrophe
What possesses people to abuse the apostrophe so (Fresh Donut’s, anyone?),
I’ll never understand. Here’s how apostrophes should be used: in contracted
words or in abbreviated years to replace missing letters or numbers, and to
indicate the possessive of nouns and some pronouns.
To place an apostrophe, draw a downward-pointing caret directly next to the
text where you want the apostrophe to appear. Then insert the apostrophe in
the caret, and repeat the symbol in the margin.
Be mindful of the direction your apostrophes are pointing: Apostrophes
always make a backward c.
Though generally shunned in the world of academia, some style guides call
for an apostrophe to form plurals of letters, figures, and symbols: for exam-
ple, Mind your p’s and q’s, and My brother earned three Ph.D.’s.
Quotation marks
“Frankly,” I want to scream at those grammar naysayers, “you should give a
damn about how to use quotation marks!” You use them in these ways: to
enclose direct quotations or bites from media; to indicate such titles as those
of poems, short stories, songs, and book chapters; and to offset technical
jargon or language that may not immediately be familiar to your audience.
To indicate quotation marks, draw a downward-pointing caret directly next to
the text where you want the quotation marks to appear. Then insert the quo-
tation marks in the caret, pointing in the appropriate direction, and repeat in
the margin.
By the time I am in my 60s, I hope I will not care so much about other
peoples opinions, but whether that will happen is anybodys guess.
131
Chapter 9: Mastering the Proofreading Symbols

Quotations within dialogue use single quotation marks, and if the nestled
quote ends the sentence, most styles call for a space between the single and
double quotation marks. For example, “And another thing,” she continued, “you
know how much she loves to say, ‘Word nerds think they know everything!’ ”
Most word-processing programs automatically correct straight quotes (")
with the proper open (“) and closed (”) quotation marks. These programs are
not infallible, however, so check that the smart-quotes feature worked and
put the quotation marks in the right directions.
Question marks and exclamation points
Why am I putting these two punctuation marks in the same entry? Why!?
Because the proofreading symbols for each are remarkably similar.
To place a question mark or exclamation point, draw the question mark or
exclamation point over a caret in the text where it is needed. Repeat the
symbol in the margin.
Parentheses
Parentheses are used to enclose incidental material within a sentence (exam-
ples, explanations, and other supplementary facts). Whereas dashes are used
to maximize such information, parentheses minimize the importance. And —
no-brainer — the information in the parentheses is often called a parenthetical
reference.
To indicate a parenthesis, draw a parenthesis bisected by two horizontal
lines in the text where it is needed, making sure the parenthesis faces the
appropriate direction. Repeat this symbol in the margin.
Am I risking clarity by not ending my question with a question mark,
thought the writer. You bet your bippy you are.
For the love of it all, exclaimed the editor while reading the lyrics to
Muskrats on Holiday, why do I have to be the one to read such drivel?
132
Part III: Picking Up a Proofreading Career 

Parentheses do not change the punctuation of a sentence. If a parenthetical
reference is at the end of a sentence, the period, question mark, or exclama-
tion point still appears after the final parenthesis. On the other hand, if the
material within the parentheses is an independent, complete sentence, it gets
its own punctuation. For example, He likes to lick chocolate pudding from his
fingers. (I have to admit, so do I.)
Parentheses can also be used with numbers or letters in a list, as in We will
need the following before you can board the bus: (a) a permission slip, (b) your
lunch bag, and (c) bribe money.
Brackets
I outline the many uses of brackets in Chapter 12, including using them to
enclose the expression [sic], which means that an error in quoted material
was present in the original.
To indicate a bracket, draw a bracket bisected by one horizontal line in the
text where it is needed, making sure the bracket faces the appropriate direc-
tion. Repeat this symbol in the margin.
Formatting Symbols
This family of symbols corrects formatting mistakes and inconsistencies in
running copy and in such elements as tables, charts, graphs, and reference
pages.
Boldfaced type
Boldface is used to emphasize particular words or phrases within a text.
Chapter numbers, chapter titles, headings for lists, and page numbers for ref-
erences to tables or images are often boldfaced.
After the meeting, Syd gave me a copy of his play, “The Mispelled sic
Modifier,” in which he writes, “I am loco crazy, in Spanish for cocoa.”
Merriam-Websterís Collegiate Dictionary Web 11, for short is a regular fix-
ture on my work desk.
133
Chapter 9: Mastering the Proofreading Symbols

To indicate boldfaced type, draw a wavy horizontal line under the text to be
set in boldface, then write bf in the margin and circle it.
Italic type
Italics are used to indicate the titles of plays, books, magazines, and newspa-
pers; foreign words or phrases; and words as words or letters as letters, as in
“This program is brought to you by the letter m.” Within creative writing,
first-person thoughts can be italicized: My goodness, Chris is a great writer,
thought Kelly.
To indicate italicized type, underline the text to be italicized, then write ital in
the margin and circle it.
Underlines or underscores
Back when I learned to type on a — gasp! — typewriter, underscoring, or
underlining, text was one of the only ways to make words stand out. These
days, the underscore has been downgraded to occasional usage for Web site
addresses and e-mail addresses.
To indicate underscored text, underline the text to be underscored, then
write underscore or us in the margin and circle it.
Did you read The Unbearable Lightness of Being? I read the review in The
New Yorker, and I ran right out and bought it. I recommend it, especially
the chapter on the Czech word litost. Amazing!

Part III: Picking Up a Proofreading Career 

Roman type
Roman type means no boldface, no italics, and no underscores — just good ol’
regular type. The roman-type symbol is usually applied to correct mistakenly 
formatted copy — kinda like an “Undo this!” sign.
To indicate roman type, circle the mistakenly underlined, boldfaced, or
italicized text or punctuation, then write rom in the margin and circle it.
Wrong font
These days, when a book is designed, the text is usually “flowed in” from a 
word-processed document to an electronic publishing program. Sometimes the
fonts don’t convert properly, leading to obvious — and not so obvious — font
inconsistencies.
To correct a wrong or inconsistent font, circle the text that is set in the wrong
font, then write wf in the margin and circle it.
Layout Symbols
Use these symbols to indicate a change in the look or layout of the text.
Sometimes an inconsistent font is very, very obvious. Other times, not so
much.
She doesn’t know a lot about typesetting, so it makes sense that she got a
few things wrong in the layout.

Chapter 9: Mastering the Proofreading Symbols

Move left, right, up, or down
Move it, move it! I’m trying to explain these actions over here! Though it’s a
bit difficult to explain in words, trust me when I say that, as you progress
through a document, you’ll instinctively know when these actions are
needed. An example? Well, say you are reading a series of paragraphs and
only one is indented. You would use the move-left symbol at the start of the
paragraph to indicate that the text needs to be shifted left.
To move text, use a bracket ( [ ) to pull the text in the direction you want it to be
moved, as if the bracket were a magnet. Try to align the bracket in the position
you ultimately want the text to be. In the margin, write move left/right/up/down
(whichever is the appropriate direction for this text) and circle it.
Center
There are times when text should take center stage: chapter numbers and
titles, titles of articles or excerpts, headers and subheaders, and the like.
To center text, surround the text to be centered with outfacing brackets ( ][ ).
In the margin, write cntr or ctr and circle it.
Run in text
You may not run into this situation often, but sometimes it is necessary to
delete the start of a new paragraph and run the copy continuously with the
previous paragraph.
Does this look centered to you?

Inconsistent spacing after bullets.

136
Part III: Picking Up a Proofreading Career 

To indicate that copy should be run continuously, or to delete the start of a
new paragraph, run a backward-S-shape line from the end of the top line to
the beginning of the next line. Write run in in the margin and circle it.
Begin paragraph
When proofreading, you generally do not need to indicate new paragraphs.
(That’s a copyeditor’s territory.) However, you may need to do so in dialogue,
if creating a new paragraph for a change in speaker has been overlooked.
To begin a paragraph, draw two vertical lines with a loop like the letter c at
the top, making what looks like a backward P — as in paragraph. Place the
symbol in the text where you want the paragraph to begin, and repeat the
symbol in the margin.
Break or rebreak
You, words in the margins! Break it up, and get back in line with the others!
Wait, you need to be told what to do? Okay, here goes . . .
To break or rebreak a line, draw what looks like one step of a staircase before
the word to be moved to the next line. Write break in the margin and circle it.
Waggoner asked, “Where would I start a new paragraph?” “Over here,”
Simpson replied, “and make it snappy.”
Because this is the start of an idea,
and this is a continuation of that idea, there is no reason this 
sentence shouldn’t be a continuous line.
137
Chapter 9: Mastering the Proofreading Symbols

Bad break
While not backbreaking work, identifying bad breaks is not something that
comes easily to the everyday reader. What’s a bad break? In published
matter, text is usually justified, causing hyphens to occur in words that fall at
the ends of lines. Sometimes, this creates what is called a double break, a
compound word — a word already hyphenated — broken off in an unsightly
matter. (And we can’t be having that, now, can we?)
For example, self-inflicted misery breaking as self-in-flicted misery may leave a
reader to wonder whether this is even the same word.
To correct a bad break, delete the hyphen in the word to be fixed, and close
up the space. Write bb — or, for particularly messy documents, spell out
break — in the margin and circle it.
When in doubt about a word break, check the word entry in your house 
dictionary for acceptable breaks. These breaks are often indicated by dots
in the initial entry word. For instance, tiramisu is listed as tir·a·mi·su. It’s a
piece of cake!
I am not usually hot-tem-
pered, but when I see bad
breaks, I get all fired up!

eady to put your snappy proofreader skills to use? In this chapter, I pre-
sent a number of short examples of text in need of a proofreader’s TLC.
I’ve arranged the examples to mirror the categories of symbols I outline in
Chapter 9. At the end of each category of examples, I show you how I would
mark the corrections, and I explain some of the trickier aspects of each.
Ready . . . set . . . wait! Don’t blow through all these examples in one sitting.

before heading on to Chapter 11. The error-laden passages I present there
will take even more concentration.
The Core Symbols in Action
The errors in these examples are among the most common ones writers
make. I’m sure you know how easy it is to leave a letter out of a word while
typing, or to add an extra one where it doesn’t belong. (Who among us hasn’t
sent an e-mail that we later realized needed another proofread?) The same is
true for capitalizing a word that shouldn’t be, adding an extra space between
words . . . the mistakes are easy. And spotting them shouldn’t be too tough
either.

Even if you’re spaced out, conjoined words like these tend to be jarring
enough to the eyeball that you’ll see them pretty easily.
Transpose
Keep in mind that transposition errors are super common, due to fumbling
fingers or a touch of dyslexia that we all seem to have at times.
Spell out
Don’t forget to consult your house style to nose out number nuances like
whether to spell out ten or use a numeral. If a publisher, editor, or company
has any house style preferences, they will include the treatment of numbers.

it, as I show here.)

Periods are everywhere, but these days, there seems to be a tendency to
streamline punctuation in copy. You may come across a house style manual
that dictates the removal of periods from Ph.D., D.D.S., and M.B.A. That’s just
some publishers’ way of smoothing things out. And that’s their right.
Semicolons and colons
Did you spot the comma splice here? The comma in the first sentence

Ellipses
Her voice trailing off was your freebie hint: Ellipses are used to indicate an

to house style for any given project.
Dashes: Long, longer, and longest
Commit this to memory: Use hyphens (-) to hyphenate words; use en dashes
(–) to show ranges and to connect compound modifiers in which one of the
elements is an open compound; and use em dashes (—) to separate subordi-
nate clauses and to indicate abrupt changes in continuity. And see Chapter 12
for examples of each.

write this down: The only time you use it’s is for the contraction of it is, like here.
Everywhere else, you use the possessive pronoun its. It’s important stuff.
Quotation marks
Except for maybe the poem title, this one should have been easy. Note that dia-
logue punctuation should be within the quotation marks.
Question marks and exclamation points
Exclamation points within running copy are few and far between. Be sure 
not to use a comma as well as an exclamation point; exclamation points and 
question marks trump commas and periods (which neatly avoids any doubled-
up punctuation).
Parentheses
The covert operation nicknamed “Project Meatbeard” required us to gather
the following: 1 WD-40, 2 chewed gum, and 3 rotten eggs. Fortunately, each
was already under my bed.
“Huh ” she bellowed, “What did you say ”
“Thanks a whole lot ” I screamed, “Now the whole auditorium is listening”
Do you know what the local paper said about my poem The Overeater? It
takes the cake . . . and the burger, and even the french fries.
The other paper wrote only the following: It’s not all that.
Since the 80s, the Smiths have been one of my favorite bands. Its not that
theyre more talented than any other band; its just that Morrisseys voice and
big hair make me happy.

Parentheses are cushions that enclose information within a sentence.
Parentheses are also used to set numbers and letters apart from the text visu-
ally, as here.
Brackets
When you’ve got information that’s already tucked inside parentheses, and
part of it needs to be tucked in a little further to set it off, brackets come in
quite handy. For additional examples of how to use brackets, see Chapter 12.
Fun Times with Formatting
Formatting can be a bit like art class — you get to make lots of lines and
squiggles and flourishes. Inner creative self, emerge!

Why italicize shimmery eyeshadow, again? That’s right: Use italic to indicate
words as words and letters as letters. Check and check.
Underlines or underscores
This was an important mark back in the day, but the underscore is now rele-
gated to the role of formatting Web site addresses. (And in some print media,
such as magazine articles, you’d use it only if the entire URL — including
http:// — were included.)
Roman type
When in ROM: Think of ROM as the great “Undo this!” sign to return boldface,
italics, and underscores to regular Roman type.
Wrong font
This is an easy one that needs little explanation, so I’ll leave you be.
Looking Out for Layout
Good layout relaxes a reader’s mind: New paragraphs make text orderly and
digestible; in lists, consistent organization allows the reader to know the order
of things; and dependable alignment creates a subconscious trust on the
reader’s part. You can help foster that faith.

Here, again, let consistency within the copy dictate the layout. Though in

Good advice.

In dialogue, create a new paragraph when there is a change in the speaker.
And never warn a loser before he’s about to step into a sinkhole.
Break or rebreak
A double break — an additional break in a word that already contains a
hyphen — means the layout should be adjusted. You want the word to break
only at its hyphen, if possible.
Bad break
Did this one confound you? Remember, consult the house dictionary for
acceptable breaks within words. They are often indicated as dots between

My Hidden Agenda: Proofreading 
as Art and Science
If you didn’t catch every mistake in the examples, don’t get too freaked out.
This stuff really does take practice. And the more you do it, the better you’ll
be at spotting these things — both the easy and the devilish.
Let me tell you a little something about proofreading tests, which you’re
bound to encounter when you start looking for work. You know those stan-
dardized tests that have become a bit controversial of late? SATs, GREs, and
their initialistic ilk? They’re controversial because the importance placed on
them has led not so much to better teaching of the material within the test
but to expensive test preparation and coaching services that teach you how
to navigate through the tricky language of the test itself.
What does test preparation have to do with you? Well, there’s an art of finess-
ing the skills of copyediting and proofreading — you need to exhibit your tal-
ents through prettily scribbled symbols, and you must know your stuff. But
there’s a bit of science behind the development of these tests that’s worth
mentioning.
Here’s the reality: The goal of most proofreading tests (and the examples in
this chapter) is to cram in as many mistakes as possible — and to try to
screw you up in the process. Actual proofreading projects are never rife with
as many errors as the tests taken by would-be proofreaders (and the exam-
ples in this chapter). Never. Really. Take these tests (and the examples in this
chapter) with a grain of salt — large rock-size salt. When you’re finally sitting
at your desk, excitedly starting your first proofreading job, you will enjoy it
so much more than you ever could tripping over the often obvious errors in a
test (and — say it with me — the examples in this chapter). Alas, for now,
your job is to trip with skill and a smile.
Get your hands on as many proofreading tests as you can. How do you do
this? Inquire directly to your favorite publishers about freelance proofreading
opportunities. Most likely, they will send you a letter thanking you for your
interest and enclose a proofreading test for you to complete and return. Do it,
but make copies that you can reference for study later. And don’t forget to
ask for feedback on how you did — you’re bound to learn something new.

In This Chapter
 Brushing up your fiction diction
 Sinking your teeth into an ice cream recipe
 Examining a world wonder
A
t my husband’s birthday party last year, a friend of ours presented him
with a large box. Fantastic, I thought, it’s a magic bathroom-cleaning
machine. No such luck. It turned out to be an ice-cream maker. My first
thought was, Huh? He doesn’t make ice cream. My second thought was, Oh
no, he’s not going to be the one making the ice cream.
The machine came with a few recipes that looked easy enough. And so,
because it was a big birthday for him (I won’t tell you which, but it comes
between 34 and 36), I tried my hand at this thing they call cooking. Four
hours and much spilled egg and scalded milk later, I had exactly one quart of
cold, sweet soup. Not one to give up, I did what any resourceful homemaker
would do: I checked out the Food Channel and watched a sauce pan–wielding
chef — with a way snazzier kitchen and fancy chef’s pants, to boot — make
ice cream the right way.
Why am I telling you this? Because even if (as I hope) you’ve read the proof-
reading recipe book — the previous chapters of Part III — sometimes watch-
ing a pro at work is the best way to figure something out. I don’t have any
fancy proofreading pants, but I do have some experience in the field, and I’m
happy to show you how I’d handle certain types of proofreading projects.
In each section of this chapter, I first present a brief writing example for you
to read. I follow it with a fully proofread version (a redline, if you want to toss
the lingo around) that includes some explanations from me as to why the cor-
rections were made, as well as some queries that I’d suggest posing to the
author or assigning editor. Let’s get cooking!

Example One: Playing with Fiction
The original
It was a dark and stromy night. At least thats what the weatherman
said it would be. Shelly speed along to the static of the radio, her eyes
darting from the road to the flourescent clock on the dash board and
back to the road. Now shed be walking into the party late and over-
dressed.
She could of killed Mike for standing her up. She had waited until
8:0 p.m., just like he asked her to, 8:30 even, until the excuse’s to her
Mother ran out. When it was obvious he wasn’t going to show she
decided to driver herself to the party.
“You have another think coming if you think thisll keep me down,”
Shelley said allowed to the empty car. Olive a sudden, something darted
from the shadows just outside the headlights of her Saaab Shelly reacted by
drawing her arms to her face causing the steering wheel to slip and jerking
the car into what would have been oncoming traffic, had there been any
body else on the road. Underfoot, Shelly feels the rumble strips of the 
wrong side of the parkway and the dip of the small road side gutter. The car
rolled for ever before coming to a stop, bumbing the thin trunk of a tree.
158
Part III: Picking Up a Proofreading Career 

The Saab had landed perpendiculer to the road that lay quiet behind her,
and there was trees prohibiting a clear view from the car. She looked the
passenger seat in a quiet search for glass. Seeing nothing, she twisted her
head towards the back seat. Again, nothing. But for the glove compart-
men hanging a gape, there was little to in dicate that she had just run off 
the road.
Relizing that she wasn’t hurt, Shelly was releived.
Thats when she heard it a faint tapping at the passenger door. Tap, tap.
There it was again? Highly-panicked, she now heard the silence that was the
car not starting, not making any niose what so ever. She violently turned the
key again and again and again until it snapped with a metalic ping.
“Please leave me alone”, she cried, “don’t you see I’m in trouble here.”

The commas don’t 
quite work in context.
Em-dashes are great
for offsetting changes
in continuity, such as
the one here.
When preceded by a
personal pronoun—
my, his, our—mother 
does not require 
capitalization. Try this
when you’re confused:
Replace mother with a 
person’s name. If 
there’s no problem,
keep it capitalized; if
it sounds awkward,
that’s your indication
to leave it lowercased.
Understanding of the
first part of the 
sentence is dependent
upon the second part,
hence a dependent
clause. Be sure to 
connect dependent
clauses with a comma.

happening to the
alignment of this 
paragraph shouldn’t
be.
I prefer toward to

cases. Not everyone

Example Two: A Recipe for Disaster
The original
Classic Vanilla Ice Cream
A blend of purity and prefection, classic vanilla ice cream, heavily-
scented with vanilla pods is the perfect conclusion to any meal. In fla-
vored ice creams it serves as the base, upon which essences are added. It
also accompanies other deserts, such as apple pie [pg. TK], and peach
cobbler [pg 3], complimenting them like a white suit on a fat man. But
vanila icecream, in it’s purist form, is best enjoyed alone.
“My advice to you is not to enquire why or whither, but just enjoy your
ice cream while it’s on your plate—that’s my philosophy”
—Thornton Wilder
Our recipe uses whole* vanila pods for an authentic flavour and
color unattainable with vanilla extract alone.

Ingredients;
2 cups whole milk
4-6 vanilla pods, sliced lenthwise
1 cup sugar
Ten eggs, seperate the yolks from the whites
300 ml whipping cream, partly whipped
2 tbsp. Worcestershire sauce
Pour milk into pan, add vanilla pods, and slowly bring to a boil.
Beat egg yokes in a mixing bowl, slowly adding suger. Beat until white.
When the skim milk reaches a boil, slowly pour it over the egg yolks,
whisking briskly.
Stir mixture with a spoon until custard begins to thicken. When it is thick
enough, to coat the back of the spoon; strain it through a sieve into
another mixing bowl.
After the mixture cools, fold in the partly-whipped cream. Add to an ice
cream maker and churn until firm. Place in freezer until ready to enjoy.
Serves 20.
**Store extra vanilla pods in your sugar jar. The sugar will absorb the
vanilla’s rich aroma. Use this sugar for future batches of ice cream.

you think it’s wrong,
at least query whether
the error is intentional.
This asterisk refers to
the pods, not the fact
they’re whole.
If you were copy-

suggest changing this
ingredient to “10 egg
yolks” because the
recipe doesn’t use the
whites. In your proof-
reading capacity, 
however, you may 
want to let this stand 
without comment.
Wow. How did the
metric system sneak
in here? If you’re up 
for it, do the math 
and put down the 
correct measurement. 
If not, query it.
If you know an ingred-

query it. Be tactful:
“Seems incorrect, 
consider omitting.”
You may want to
query this because 
yolks get pale, not 
white.
Whoops. The ingred-

Example Three: Wonder of the Word
The original
Haigia Sophia
The architects ANTHEMIUS OF TRALLES and ISIDORUS of MILETUS began work on
the enormous chursh of Santa Sophia, properly known as Hagia Sophia,
Church of the Holy Wisdom (FIGS. 3-13, 3–14) for Justinian in
Constantinople in 532 a.d. Today, the church stands as a historical pinna-
cle of acheivement in world architecture. Consider its dimensions: 270
feet long by 240’ wide with a 108-foot diameter dome. The top of the
dome reaches a height of 60 meters. Hagia Sophia dwarfed all the build-
ings of its day, including such behemoths we discussed in chapter two as
the Basilica of Constantine, the Baths of Caracalla, and the Pantheon.
While it was completed in 537, Hagia Sophia was a work in progress for
years to come—most notably, towering butresses were added to the exte-
rior, and after the Ottoman conquest of 1453, it became an Islamic

mosque, whereupon four Turkish minarets were added, greatly altering 
the original design put forth by ANTHEMIUS and ISIDORUS, who, no doubt, 
would have been astounded at the fact that their work was not only 
standing, but still significant almost a thousand years later. After having 
been secularized in the last century, the Hagia Sophia stands to-day as a
museum and it is now one of Istanbul’s most visited tourist attractions.
At its center, an enormous dome is held aloft by four arches, configured
to form a square. The dome’s weight is transferred down piers, enabling
an airy, unobstructed interior. The walkways, the vistas, the threshholds
and the delicate ormamented surfaces serve to hide the imense lines of
structure, Much of interior, in fact, has no structural function. Rather,
what visitors encounter inside is merely non-loadbearing decoration
between the great piers.
The light in Hagia Sophia streams through 40 windows at the base of the
dome, lending an etherial illusion of it being lit not from without, but
within.
Blending Greek Theology, Roman scale, Near East tradition and Eastern
Christian mysticism, this monuments to Holy Wisdom proves formidable
even by today’s standards, while not using todays principle building
materials: steel and concrete.

How’d You Do?
Did you overlook some mistakes in this chapter? Don’t sweat it. These exam-
ples give you a sense of the kinds of errors to look out for when you’re on the
job. If you’re considering working in publishing, you’ll be glad to know that
many of the mistakes incorporated into this chapter were lifted directly from
proofreading tests I’ve taken in my lengthy career as a proofreading-test thief.
It’s important to test yourself as often as possible by doing the type of work
I’ve just shown you. I recommend periodically applying for jobs, even when
you don’t want them, and asking to take proofreading tests. Doing so defi-
nitely hones your test-taking skills and may improve your all-around job
skills.
Now, if you’re wondering whether watching the cooking show on ice-cream
manufacturing helped improve my skills and demonstrate how supportive I
am of my husband’s sweet tooth . . . if I ever dust off the ice-cream maker, we

Repertoire

In this part . . .
T
he chapters in this part help you take your skills to
the next level. First, I present a punctuation and usage
primer that introduces you to some of the most common
errors you’ll encounter on the job. Then, I present an
anatomy lesson on books and magazines so you can
understand the parts of a publication.
Doing your job well sometimes requires making judgment
calls, so next I delve into the all-important balancing act
between following the rules and allowing some leeway for
an author’s personal style.
I also show you what a style sheet is, how to create and
use it, and why it should be your new best friend. Plus, I
discuss one of the more technical aspects of copyediting:
formatting a document in preparation for layout.
Next, I tackle a subject that has changed the publishing
world radically in recent years: electronic editing and
proofreading. I consider Chapter 17 required reading for
anyone serious about a copyediting or proofreading
career, and you should too.

 Reviewing punctuation
 Catching common spelling and usage errors
I
n this chapter, I put you through a boot camp of sorts — one intended to
get your brain revved and ready to catch some of the more common
errors you’re likely to encounter when copyediting and proofreading. I focus
on punctuation, spelling, and word usage, and I toss in a few grammar
reminders for fun.
I wrote this chapter assuming that you’re bringing some knowledge of gram-
mar to the table. But if you’re hankering for a grammar review (and even sea-
soned editors and proofreaders need one from time to time), I recommend
that you pick up one of the following:
 Woe is I: The Grammarphobe’s Guide to Better English in Plain English by
Patricia T. O’Conner (Riverhead): You’ll actually enjoy reading this great
primer, which has accessible explanations.
 The Gregg Reference Manual, 9th Edition, by William A. Sabin
(Irwin/McGraw-Hill): This is a business style manual with a wonderful
glossary of grammatical terms in the back.
A Punctuation Primer
This section reminds you how to use the main punctuation marks. Treat
these guidelines as just that: guidelines. Check out your favorite style guide
for more detailed explanations.

Apostrophe
It would shock you, the examples of apostrophe transgression you can find
just on the way to work in the morning: Bagel’s and Cream Cheese, Its Going to
Be a Hot One!, Baker and Son’s, and on and on.
Contrary to popular usage, apostrophes are not used to pluralize normal old
nouns: taco’s, dog’s, bottle’s — all wrong! Apostrophes are used to form pos-
sessives of singular nouns (the editor’s book, the baby’s bottle) and plural
words (the girls’ room, the buses’ routes). The main exceptions to the rule
(and there are always exceptions!) are individual lowercase letters (mind your
p’s and q’s) and abbreviations that have periods or both upper- and lower-
case letters in them (Ph.D.’s, PhD’s).
Brackets
Brackets (sometimes also called square brackets) are used to enclose com-
ments, clarifications, or corrections added by someone other than the origi-
nal writer, as well as to supply missing letters or words within quoted
material. Consider these examples:
“I think the next project [her new screenplay] will be the most challenging
one yet,” she said.
“The clinical trial showed that the combination of medications has a 92 per-
cent success rate in people who don’t have heart problems.” [Emphasis is
mine.]
They come in handy if you need to insert a parenthetical reference within
text already enclosed by parentheses. For example, the year range in the fol-
lowing sentence is a parenthetical reference within a parenthetical statement:
(Albert Einstein [1879–1955] studied the violin during his childhood.)
Brackets also enclose the expression [sic], which means “thus” and is used to
indicate that an error in the quoted material was present in the original:
One posting read, ironically, “I would definately [sic] recommend this edit-
ing course to others.”
Colon
Colons are used to introduce information in a sentence:
Jason could draw three things well: flowers, 3-D letters, and little devil people.
172
Part IV: Adding to Your Repertoire

There were only two ways I could compete with him: practice drawing or
break all his pencils.
When a colon introduces an independent clause, the first letter in that clause
can either be capitalized or not.
For me, artistic expression is liberating: smashed pencil boxes can be con-
sidered art.
For others, artistic expression is a way to show off: They draw fancy figures
all day long to impress others.
It’s all a matter of preference and style. Always check your house style guide.
Most house style guides direct you to capitalize the word after a colon if it’s
the first word of an independent clause. However, the 15th edition of The
Chicago Manual of Style has thrown a wrench in that convention; it says to
capitalize the first word of an independent clause after a colon only if two or
more related independent clauses follow the colon.
Comma
The comma is the most versatile of the punctuation marks. Because it is so
common, we sometimes overlook its value. But in the publishing industry,
the comma is critical. Writers, magazines, and newspapers are all judged on
comma usage at some time or other.
While we all use commas more often than other punctuation marks, I urge
you to use them sparingly. If a sentence makes sense without a comma, it’s
usually better to leave it out.
But keep in mind that authors definitely get a say in how to use commas. For
example, when you work on fiction, an author may want to leave commas out
of a desperate and breathless and dangerous fight scene because some fren-
zied scenes want to stay frenzied while commas would slow those scenes
down. You don’t want to star in your own fight scene with a frustrated author.
And on the flip side, if an author really wants to use an unnecessary comma,
and if that comma doesn’t interfere with the sentence’s meaning, leave it alone.
Commas in compound sentences
When two independent clauses are joined with a conjunction, use a comma:
Sean stood at the blackboard trying to recall the equation, but his nerves
had erased that memory.
Keep in mind that some editors choose to leave the comma out if the inde-
pendent clauses are short and joined by and.
173
Chapter 12: Boning Up on Punctuation and Usage

If one clause cannot stand alone, don’t use the comma:
Sean stood at the blackboard and tried to recall the equation.
Commas in a series
Usually a comma is used to join each element of a series, including the last
two. The final comma before a conjunction in a series is the serial comma:
Think lions, tigers, and bears. Always use the house style guide as your indica-
tion of whether a serial comma belongs in the document or not.
Be sure not to place the serial comma in the middle of compounds. You don’t
want For breakfast today we have pancakes, bacon, and eggs, and sausage and
biscuits. Instead, you want For breakfast today we have pancakes, bacon and
eggs, and sausage and biscuits.
Some house styles recommend omitting the last comma in a series if its omis-
sion will not be confusing. But keep in mind that some sentences will still
require it. For example, if the last two items in the series could be mistaken
for a single compound phrase, a comma is necessary. Otherwise, you may
end up with something inaccurate (and perhaps tabloid-worthy):
In Karen’s acceptance speech, she thanked her parents, Justin Timberlake
and Dr. Ruth.
Commas after introductory phrases
If an introductory phrase is short (three words or less, typically), you don’t
need to set it off with a comma:
At lunch Joe burned the roof of his mouth on an over-microwaved zucchini
slice.
If the introductory phrase is longer, use a comma.
When Joe wolfed down an over-microwaved zucchini slice, he burned the
roof of his mouth.
If the introductory phrase is one word, and if that word is an adverb (or you
want to emphasize it), use a comma.
Suddenly, his palate felt like crisp bacon.
Commas in interjections and side explanations
When a sentence is interrupted by a phrase that isn’t essential to the mean-
ing of the sentence, set off the phrase with commas on each side.
Gregg, a famous suck-up, brought Ms. Goldin a crate of oranges from Florida.

Part IV: Adding to Your Repertoire

Ellipses
An ellipsis indicates missing material or an incomplete thought; it can also
denote hesitation and uncertainty. Two schools of convention govern your
every decision about ellipses: the three-dot method and the three- or four-dot
method. They roll out like this:
 The three-dot method: Easy enough — you always use three dots no
matter what your dotty heart desires. No more, no fewer. Why not use
this method all the time? Because some editors and publishers just
don’t like it.
 The three- or four-dot method: This method is preferred by a majority
of editors. The difference here is that you use a period followed by ellip-
sis points if the previous sentence is a complete sentence. In other
words, in this situation, you have a total of four dots: the period, which
should be saddled up next to the end of the sentence, and the three
ellipsis points.
Regardless of your method, I have two important reminders about ellipses:
 Turn off your computer’s little ellipses auto-format thingamajig. Editors
don’t like it, so you shouldn’t like it.
 Put a space before and after the ellipsis points, as well as between each
point, unless house style indicates otherwise.
Em dash
Em dashes — so called because they are the width of the character m — are
used for emphasis or interruption. They can be used on their own or in pairs
to offset a word or phrase:
Many people seek help from naturopathic medical professionals — those
who emphasize using diet, exercise, meditation, and other tools for improv-
ing health.
A vast amount of serotonin — about 95 percent of the body’s total — is pro-
duced in the digestive system.
The double hyphen (--) is sometimes used in place of the em dash. You may
notice that word-processing programs automatically convert double hyphens
into em dashes for you. However, since the programs aren’t infallible, some
stray double hyphens may remain, so if you’re copyediting on hard copy,
you’ll want to mark each em dash no matter how it appears in the text. The
production editor will then make the global change to convert everything to
proper em dashes. If you’re proofreading, you need to make sure the change
has been made and note any stray double hyphens that need to be corrected.
175
Chapter 12: Boning Up on Punctuation and Usage

(If you’re copyediting electronically, just do a global search-and-replace to
convert all double hyphens to em dashes — or vice versa, if that’s what the
production editor wants.)
Some styles call for em dashes to have spaces on either side. These are
called floating em dashes. If there are no spaces around them, the em dashes
are referred to as squeezed.
Em dashes also precede quotation attributions:
Poetry is a deal of joy and pain and wonder, with a dash of the dictionary.
— Kahlil Gibran
You may encounter a supersized first cousin of the em dash if you work on
texts that include bibliography sections. The 3-em dash (which is the width of
three m’s in the corresponding font) most frequently appears in a bibliogra-
phy when an author’s name is cited more than once. Repeat listings by that
same author feature a 3-em dash rather than the author’s name again.
En dash
En dashes — dashes that are the width of the character n — have multiple
uses. They’re used to connect two items (usually numbers) that designate a
range:
We submitted chapters 10–12 well after midnight.
I left at halftime with the score stuck at 3–1.
The January–February issue is due on newsstands tomorrow.
They take the place of hyphens when one part of an open compound is made
up of two words:
The author is a Nobel Prize–winning physicist.
In the above example, Prize and winning are joined, but Nobel is just floating
out there. The en dash works a little harder than a hyphen to show that the
word Nobel is included in the open compound.
And en dashes may also be used to indicate that tension or opposition exists
in a relationship, or to show a direction of movement:
The article supports the tax–spend hypothesis: Tax revenues determine gov-
ernment spending.
The New York–Washington, D.C. run takes about three hours by train.
176
Part IV: Adding to Your Repertoire

Admittedly, the idea of tension can be difficult to pinpoint. Definitely check
what the house style or the preferred style guide has to say about en dashes.
Exclamation point
Exclamation points should be used sparingly (except in dialogue). Their pur-
pose is emphasis, but they all too often equate to overemphasis. In teaching
this principle, F. Scott Fitzgerald said, “An exclamation mark is like laughing
at your own joke.”
When an exclamation point is used in dialogue and ends a sentence, don’t put
a period after it:
Curtis had had enough and snarled, “Fish out your stinkin’ oranges, and
take ’em back to Disneyworld!”
Hyphen
Don’t let the hyphen’s diminutive size fool you. It’s the lynchpin holding
together your copyediting or proofreading career.
Hyphens link compound modifiers in cases where the meaning would not be
clear without them:
Bobby took a fast-acting pill.
Without the hyphen (Bobby took a fast acting pill), some readers may think
Bobby took a drug (that works immediately) that helped him audition for
Hamlet.
Open compound modifiers with adverbs ending in -ly do not need hyphens.
The reason is that -ly adverbs always alert the reader that they modify the
words immediately following them — without exception. There is no way to
misread a quickly moving van. You know it’s a van and it’s moving quickly.
Notice the difference with a fast moving van; you may think the author is talk-
ing about a moving van that is speeding along. In this case, you hyphenate
fast-moving to convey that it’s just a regular van.
Hyphens are used to separate telephone, Social Security, and other numbers:
212-555-1212
123-45-6789
Hyphens are used with some prefixes to form compounds. Check your pre-
ferred dictionary and house style to determine if a hyphen is necessary in,
say, the word co-worker.
177
Chapter 12: Boning Up on Punctuation and Usage

Hyphens join the words in multiword expressions that are to be read as a
single unit, such as fractions and some compound nouns:
We bought three-quarters of a tank of gas.
It was driven by a nine-year-old.
Hyphen usage can vary between genres. For technical documents, you don’t
hyphenate a compound after the verb: He’s people oriented. For narrative
manuscripts, that same guy is bound to be people-oriented.
Much of hyphenation is open to interpretation, so whatever you do, make
sure to pick one style and stick with it through the book or document for con-
sistency. Keep track of every hyphen situation and refer to your trusty notes.
Parentheses
Parentheses enclose asides or information that offers some sort of explanation:
I drove through the night (on caffeine pills and black coffee) and arrived
before dawn.
Police found a box of “Espresso Mix” (chocolate-covered espresso beans)
beneath the passenger seat.
Parentheses enclose numbers for clarity:
At three dollars ($3) a gallon, we should have flown.
Add two (2) tablespoons of cocoa powder.
When parentheses follow a phrase or clause that requires a comma, always
place the comma after the parentheses, not before:
When Joy got to Jacksonville (my hometown), she headed straight for the
water.
A rare exception to this rule is in numbering elements in a series:
I had to remember to (1) wake up my brother, (2) wake up my mother, and
(3) shake the sand out of my shoes.
Period
A period marks the end of a sentence, of course. It also marks the end of an
abbreviation. When an abbreviation ends a sentence, one period suffices:
178
Part IV: Adding to Your Repertoire

Monitor sizes range from 15 in. to 21 in.
For a very brief moment in time, people were avoiding placing periods after
Web site addresses when the addresses ended a sentence. The fear was that
someone might think the period belonged to the URL. Heavens! Trust me,
people are smarter than that. Use the period. (While I’m on this note, when a
URL breaks at the end of a line and does so at a period in the URL, the period
should be moved to the start of the new line so the reader knows it’s part of
the address.)
Put the period inside parentheses when they house the entire sentence or
phrase. Put the period after the closing parenthesis when the phrase is part
of the sentence. In some cases, like these examples, you can choose either
structure:
Everyone acted like Mr. Riebe’s job was fascinating (but it wasn’t).
Everyone acted like Mr. Riebe’s job was fascinating. (But it wasn’t.)
By the way, the convention of using two spaces between sentences has gone
the way of the manual typewriter. It was useful when printing was less precise
than today’s laser-precision standards, so commas and periods were often
difficult to tell apart. Adding the extra space between sentences made it clear
where one ended and one began. Now that everything you read is 300 dots
per inch and better, we don’t need the extra spaces.
Question mark
Question marks are used to indicate a question in dialogue:
Raymond asked, “What’s so fun about sitting in front of a computer?”
Question marks are also used to end sentences that are direct questions:
Does this sound “fascinating” to you?
And question marks can be used mid-sentence:
Why did I let him come speak to the class? she wondered.
Quotation marks
Quotation marks are used for direct quotations, of course:
“Come back when you guys come out with an affordable 64-bit processor,”
taunted John.
179
Chapter 12: Boning Up on Punctuation and Usage

They are used with words that are newly coined and just entering the language:
The staffers felt “plutoed” when the new president brought his own PR firm
into the project.
They may be used for words or phrases used in a one-off way that is under-
standable given the context:
Lizette sprained her “mousing” hand.
And they do the trick when a writer wants to distance herself from a word:
She called it “neo-abstract,” whatever that is.
Titles of works such as articles, chapters, essays, poems, and short stories
usually get quotation marks:
We were supposed to be preparing a report on Auden’s “Lullaby,” but we
couldn’t stop talking about “Funeral Blues.”
Semicolon
Semicolons are placed between two independent clauses when they aren’t
separated by a conjunction such as and or but:
I preferred the presentation by Dionne’s dad; he’s a clarinetist.
Semicolons are used to separate items in a series when they have commas or
other punctuation within them:
All I remembered was that one kid, whose name I can never remember,
started screaming; another kid threw a melted popsicle at him; and before
anyone could stop laughing, the principal walked in.
Single quotation marks
Single quotation marks are used for a quote within a quote:
Jay explained, “When Buddy opened the van door, he couldn’t think of any-
thing to say, so he just blurted out, ‘Say, what’s going on here?’ ”
One more thing. See where the single quote and the quotation mark are next
to each other at the end of the sentence? I inserted a space between them to
give them a little definition. A little identity. Without it, a reader may not
notice that there are two distinct marks in that little clump. Some style guides
call for this space (usually a hair space), and some don’t.

Slash
Slashes should be used sparingly. They are seen more often in technical writ-
ing than in fiction:
Average highway performance: 36 miles/gallon
By the end, my vision wasn’t exactly 20/20.
Fold in 1/2 cup of chocolate liqueur.
Often, an en dash can replace a slash:
2007–2008 subscription instead of 2007/2008 subscription

 Accessible (and, while we’re at it, collectible): No matter how much
everybody wants these words to be accessable or collectable, they are
what they are. Please respect them for it.
 Accommodate: This word is big enough to accommodate two sets of
double letters.

 Achievement: Yes, the ie is after a c, but the two gangs are held apart by
the h, so the old rule doesn’t fly here. Remember this: eve is smack-dab
in the middle.
 Ad nauseam: It’s Latin, folks. Latin. So no ad nauseum to any degree.
 Alcohol: Not alcahol or alcohole, no matter how much alcohol
you’ve had.
 Apology: Think polo, one p and olo.
 Apparent: Not apparant or even apparrent; just imagine your parents.
 Atheist: You may be the athiest person in the whole bunch, but for the
love of no gods, please spell it theist. And it’s not Christain, either
(though, to be fair, that’s usually a typo).
 Business: Busyness and bussiness are not your business; instead, get
busy with busi.
 Cemetery: This is so commonly misspelled as cemetary that you may
not even know it’s incorrect. It is. Please . . . use three es.
 Committee: You don’t need a committee to tell you that it’s two ms, two
ts, and two es.
 Conceive, deceive, perceive, and receive: Repeat after me: “I before e,
except after c, or when sounded like a, as in neighbor and weigh.”
Thank you.
 Definitely: Definitely not definately or defanitely. Definitely.
 Desperate: Just commit this one to memory. Or, going out on a limb,
think E! E! Rat! (Hey, I tried.)
 Eighth: This one about makes me blind, but ghth is pretty fun to say.
 Embarrass: Two rs and two ss, but only one m; em-barr-ass.
 Exercise: I still have trouble with this one, I’ll admit. Though you’re
bound to see exersice, excercise, and exercize, it’s precisely exercise.
 Fluorescent: From fluorospar, not flour. You owe (uo) it to yourself to get
it right.
 Friend: You’ve a friend ’til the end with the ie in this word.
 Harass: I’ve been harassed with harrass, but this word’s only big enough
for one r.
 Hors d’oeuvre: While it’s a fancy French term for appetizers, don’t
get too fancy with the spelling. Also, pluralizing these appetizers 
hors d’oeuvres is common in American English, despite the French
rolling their eyes and gasping non!

 Immediate: Use two ms, immediately!
 Independent and independence: Nobody wants ants at their
Independence Day picnic. Nobody.
 Liaise and liaison: i, a, i, like a mariachi band.
 License: Only in the United Kingdom is it licence; here, both the noun
and verb are license.
 Maneuver: All those vowels can seem confusing, but let mane or a-e-u-e
serve as reminders.
 Millennium: I’m happy this milestone’s behind us, because I don’t 
think I could take another millenium or milennium, thank you. Two ls,
two ns, O.K.?
 Misspell: This word and, ironically, grammar inevitably end up on the
top ten list of misspelled words. If you commit nothing else to memory,
get these two down pat.
 Necessary: You have no idea how necessary it is that you not spell this
one neccessary or necesary.
 Occasion: Two cs and one s. You’ll have occasion to say it with me: “See-
see-and-ess!”
 Omission: Take all those ommissions and omit the extra m; think of it as
your (o)mission.
 Possess: Four, count them, four ss.
 Practice: Practice this one over and over again, if necessary, and notice
that there is nary an s in the whole slew of letters.
 Presence: Declare your independence from precense and presense; the
ending is –ence.
 Privilege: Privilige and priviledge are your privilege, but they’re still
wrong. Think of ivi and the ending –ege.
 Recommend: I don’t recommend trying two cs; instead, use one c and
two ms, the end.
 Restaurateur: Though this word is a relative of restaurant, it’s not restau-
ranteur. It’s on the n-diet.
 Seize and seizure: What was that I said earlier? I before e? Forget that
with these two words; it doesn’t apply. Seize the inconsistency and use e
before i.
 Separate: Sometimes, to remind myself of this spelling, I spell desperate
and do the opposite. Here’s a tip: One separates things into parts. That
help?

Chapter 12: Boning Up on Punctuation and Usage

 Sufficient: Suffice it to say that this ends in –cient, like ancient.
 Surprise: Not suprise and definitely not surprize; remember the rpr sur-
prise inside.
 Threshold: This is a toughie, but hold it back at just one h.
 Tomorrow: The sun will not come out tommorrow; orro, all right?
 Unfortunately: It’s not so difficult when you break it down: The word is
unfortunate with –ly attached. Fortunately, that’s easy enough.
 Vehicle: I see a lot of vehical, but it doesn’t look right, does it? I should
be seeing a lot of i-c-l-e.

In Appendix A, I list these and even more commonly misspelled words so you

Think you’ve found a misspelled word? Beware: You may have been duped by
a devious variant, an acceptable spelling that’s second to the standard. Heed
this, though: Choosing a nonstandard variant can make your writing sound

Word usages that everybody 
(but you) gets wrong
Some things are inevitable: taxes, death, affect/effect mishaps. Wait, that last
one is preventable. And there’s so much more of this stuff that’s easy after it’s
pointed out to you. Just let me pull on this big foam “We’re Number One!”
finger, and I’ll get pointing.
Accept, except
Accept means to receive or admit; except refers to an exclusion:
Tami was accepted to Columbia University.
Bruce was rejected by all schools except Yokelville College.
Adverse, averse
Adverse means unfavorable, generally referring to a thing or action; averse
means opposed to or reluctant, generally referring to a person:
Haili faced adverse conditions in pitching her book to the number-one pub-
lisher.
Shane was averse to pitching his book to the number-100 publisher.
Affect, effect
Affect as a verb means to influence or to have an effect on someone or some-
thing; effect as a noun is a result of that influence:
The book affected her greatly.
The book had a tremendous effect on her.
Here’s a great way to remember the difference between these troublesome
twos: affect = Action, and effect = rEsults. In most contexts, this is all you need
to remember.
However, because life is never simple, affect can also be used as a noun to
mean an emotional display:
Michael read the same book without affect.
And effect can be used as a verb meaning to bring something about:
Technology has finally effected the transition to electronic books.
185
Chapter 12: Boning Up on Punctuation and Usage

All ready, already
All ready expresses a state of complete readiness; already expresses time
adverbially:
She was all ready to get going on her proofreading career.
She talked to people who were proofreading already to get some tips.
Altogether, all together
All together implies a gathering together of people or things; altogether means
in all or all told:
They hid all together from their angry boss.
Altogether, their boss isn’t as angry today as he was yesterday.
Allude, elude
To allude to something is to make an indirect reference to it; to elude some-
one (a pursuer, a cop) or something (a danger, a threat) is to escape from the
person or situation:
Amy alluded to her beauty more than once in her flirtations.
After suspecting Amy was flirting with him, he did everything he could to
elude her.
A concept or word can also elude someone, as in The right phrase for my char-
acter eluded me.
allusion, illusion
An allusion is an indirect reference to something; an illusion is a misconception:
Pete’s boss screamed, “Your strong-man tactics have no place here,” an allu-
sion to Pete’s earlier stint in the circus.
Pete has no illusions about how tough it will be to get back into shape.
Any way, anyway
Any way means in any manner; anyway means nevertheless:
Debbie was determined to finish the puzzle in any way possible.
Debbie warned him about the complexity of the puzzle, but he went ahead
and delved in anyway.

Assure, ensure, insure
Here’s a one-two-three punch: assure means to put one’s mind at ease; ensure
means to guarantee; and insure means to provide or to obtain insurance for
something:
Lisa assured him that insuring his possessions now would ensure he would
be reimbursed for lost or stolen items later.
A while, awhile
You probably have never thought about this, but while is a noun referring to
a period of time. In most cases, if you see the preposition for before this
word, a while is what you want (as for is preceding the noun while). Awhile is
an adverb that means — quite literally — for a while:
While he waited for a while, and waited awhile, he never waited for awhile.
Between you and me
Between you and me, I see the incorrect between you and I more times than I
care to admit. Me is the correct pronoun in this expression . . . always.
Biannually, biennially, bimonthly, biweekly, fortnightly, 
semiannually, semimonthly, semiweekly
Say them all in order as fast as you can, and then consider if you can say for
certain what any of them mean.
We have the words biannually (meaning twice a year) and biennially (meaning
once every two years). But, unfortunately, we don’t have similar pairs of
words to cover months and weeks, so bimonthly and biweekly do double duty.
In other words, bimonthly can mean twice a month or once every two months,
and biweekly can mean twice a week or once every two weeks. In publishing,
you want to use the bi- words when you mean twice a and use the semi- words
(semimonthly, semiweekly) when you mean every two.
To make things easy, you can also avoid these terms altogether and use twice
a year, twice a month, and so forth.
Blatant, flagrant
Blatant implies noticeable and obtrusive; flagrant is a bit stronger and implies
obvious and over the top:
Jodie is a blatant liar who has a flagrant disregard for the law.
Blatantly obvious is redundantly redundant.
187
Chapter 12: Boning Up on Punctuation and Usage

Boom, boon
A boom is both a loud sound and a period of rapid growth or expansion; a
boon is a timely benefit or turn of fortune:
When times were good, population boomed.
Low mortgage rates were a boon to new homebuyers.
Capital, capitol, Capitol
Capital refers to a seat of government and can also be used in the context
of money. The building that houses a legislative body of government is the
capitol. Capitalized, the Capitol is the building that houses the U.S. Congress:
Needing to raise capital, Heather visited the state capitol to raise awareness
of the issue and, that failing, worked her way up to the Capitol.
Cite, sight, site
Use cite when you mean to quote or mention a source as an authority or
proof; use sight when you mean something seen or the power of seeing; and
use site to refer to a specific location:
Kristin cited Whitman’s comments at the sight of multitudes on the ferry as
we passed the site of the Statue of Liberty.
Complement, compliment
Complement means to go well together; compliment is to praise:
Trisha complimented Tom on his tie that complemented his shirt.
Compose, comprise, consist, constitute
To say that the United States is made up of 50 states, you can say it is 
composed of them, that it consists of them, or that it comprises them:
The U.S. is composed of 50 states.
The U.S. consists of 50 states.
The U.S. comprises 50 states.
What you can’t do is use comprise or consist in the passive — no be consisted
of, no be comprised of.
To shift the focus from the whole to the parts, you can use constitute, which
means to form or make up:
Fifty states constitute the U.S.
188
Part IV: Adding to Your Repertoire

The no-passive rule applies here too: no be constituted of. It is also not correct
to write Fifty states comprise the U.S.
Consul, council, counsel
If you will be proofing legal documents, sit up straight and pay attention: A
consul is an official in the foreign service of a country; a council is a group or
committee, usually one that makes decisions; and a counsel is an attorney or
advisor and, as a verb, can mean to advise:
Before working on the book, Piroska was consul general of Hungary, work-
ing with a council of editors and a legal counsel to counsel the general popu-
lace on how to write clearly.
Continual, continuous
Continual suggests repeated though not nonstop action; in contrast, continu-
ous suggests nonstop and uninterrupted action:
Ben is a continual pest.
It snowed continuously for 14 hours.
Convince, persuade
Convince means to make someone believe something to be true; persuade
means to influence or to win over:
Dugans convinced her that he knew what he was talking about and per-
suaded her to give him money for his advice.
Currently, presently
Currently means now, at the present time; presently can mean now but also
means soon or before long. To avoid confusion, use currently when you defi-
nitely want to mean now:
Dave currently needs help, and Denise insists she will be with him presently.
Disinterested, uninterested
Disinterested means impartial; uninterested means bored or not interested:
The jury should be a disinterested panel.
The jury member was clearly uninterested as she snapped her gum and filed
her nails.

e.g., i.e.
Why English continues to be peppered with the likes of e.g. and i.e., I’ll never
figure out. Until we rid ourselves of exempli gratia and id est, think of their
use this way: e.g. = for example (think: for e.g.sample) and i.e. = in other
words (in other words):
After getting up to snuff with grammar (e.g., spelling, punctuation, syntax),
Shana decided to hop to it with a job (i.e., become a proofreader).
Elicit, illicit
Elicit means to coax or bring forth; illicit means illegal:
News of the illicit affair elicited shrieks of delight from the paparazzi.
Emigrate, immigrate
Emigrate refers to departure from a homeland; immigrate refers to arrival in a
new homeland. The tricky part? They can be followed by from or to, depend-
ing on context. When focusing on life or conditions in the old country, say
Magda emigrated from Poland to the United States or She immigrated to the
United States; when focusing on life or conditions in the new country, say
Magda immigrated to the United States from Poland or She emigrated to the
United States.
Eminent, imminent
Eminent means famous and respected and clearly obvious, and imminent
means about to take place:
He had a reputation as an eminent scholar of Spanish history.
They all agreed on his eminent suitability for the job.
The release of his first book is imminent.
Fewer, less
The basic rule is to use fewer for things that can be counted in discrete units
(think numbers) and to use less for everything else (think quantities):
Because fewer people attended the rally, the organization raised less money
than ever.
But the complete rule is more complicated than that. Most of the time, you
use less for rates, weights, temperatures, speeds, money — anything that can
be said to be below a benchmark. For example, consider temperatures. Even
though you measure temperature in discrete units (degrees), you would say
that it’s less than 90 degrees outside, not fewer than 90 degrees. That’s
because 90 degrees is the benchmark measurement that the temperature falls
below.

Flaunt, flout
Flaunt means to show off ostentatiously; flout means to ignore or disregard con-
temptuously:
Michele flaunted her three-carat ring.
Michele flouted rules against wearing expensive jewelry.
Flounder, founder
Flounder is a verb that means to move clumsily or awkwardly; the verb founder
means to encounter trouble, to collapse, or to sink below the surface:
When Bria realized she had stepped into quicksand, she floundered trying to
regain her footing.
When he failed to make the sharp turn, Derrell started to founder and even-
tually lost the race.
Hanged, hung
Lots of people have hanged themselves with this one. The past tense and
past participle of hang is hung:
Leora hung the pictures on the wall.
Leora has hung the pictures on the wall.
Easy, right? Well, then there’s the pleasant topic of executions by hanging. In
this case, the past tense and past participle is hanged:
Leora hung the pictures on the wall, and they hanged her for it; yes, she was
hanged.
Historic, historical
Historic refers to an important event in history; historical connotes something
dealing with the subject of history:
Martin Luther King gave his historic “I Have a Dream” speech in 1963.
Bob had a dream that he won first place in a historical trivia contest.
Imply, infer
Imply means to suggest indirectly; infer means to conclude or deduce. Think of it
this way: Implying is usually done by the speaker or writer, and inferring is
usually done by the listener or reader:
Donna implied that a divorce was imminent.
Ian inferred from the phone call that a divorce was imminent.

Irregardless, regardless
Regardless of its widespread use, irregardless is not acceptable in standard
English. The correct form is regardless, or you can slip in the similar-sounding
irrespective — they’ll never even notice.
Its, it’s
This one’s so high on my list, I’m sure you’ll hear this lesson again. Its indi-
cates possession, just like fellow pronouns his, hers, and theirs. It’s is a con-
traction of it is. Really, it is:
Kathy couldn’t believe its deep red color and tantalizingly tart taste. “It’s the
best apple I’ve ever tasted!”
Lay, lie
Nobody gets this one right without the little ditty “Lay = place, lie = recline.”
Lay means to put, to place, or to prepare, and each of its past and perfect
forms is laid:
He lays the book on the table.
He laid the book on the table.
He has laid the book on the table.
He had laid the book on the table.
Lie means to recline, and its present perfect and past perfect forms are both
lain, but — here’s where the confusion comes in — its past tense form is lay:
He decided to lie down on the bench.
He lay down on the bench.
He has lain on the bench for three days now.
He had lain on the bench for a week when a cop gave him a citation and
forced him to move.
Lead, led
Lead is a verb meaning to guide; led is its past-tense form. Here’s where it gets
stupid: Lead the metal is pronounced the same way as led, the past-tense
form of the verb:
He led the protestors past the lead-pencil factory, and who was leading the
group? That pencil-necked editor we love!

Part IV: Adding to Your Repertoire

Lets, let’s
Pay close attention: Lets is the present tense singular form of the verb to let,
meaning permit, allow, or make possible. Let’s is the contraction for let us:
Winning this game lets us go to the finals. Let’s go, team!
May be, maybe
May be, two words, is a verb phrase that indicates a possibility; maybe, the
single word, is an adverb that means perhaps:
There’s a chance that I may be moving in with your parents.
Maybe I’ll live in the park instead.
Nauseate, nauseous
Think of sicken and sick; one is a verb and the other is an adjective:
The smell of sulfur nauseated the workers.
The nauseous stench seemed to be coming from the basement.
Generally, the adjective nauseated is linked with a verb like feel or become:
The nauseous stench made me feel nauseated.
Precede, proceed, proceeds
Precede means to come before, proceed means to move forward, and proceeds
refers to a net amount of money:
His test preceded the release of the answer key, but he proceeded with
taking the test anyhow, even though the proceeds from the sale of the
answer key went to a good cause.
Predominant, predominate
Predominant is an adjective that means more dominant, or having superior
qualities; predominate is the verb:
The predominant interior designer in the country designed my house.
In my living room, gold wallpaper predominates.
As a bonus, the adverbs predominantly and predominately are interchange-
able, although predominately is used less frequently.
193
Chapter 12: Boning Up on Punctuation and Usage

Prescribe, proscribe
Prescribe means to recommend a remedy or to advise authoritatively,
and proscribe means to denounce or to prohibit:
The witch doctor prescribed magic herbs for his migraines, but his doctor
proscribed the taking of them.
If you see “proscribe against” in a document you’re editing or proofreading,
delete “against” because it’s redundant.
Principal, principle
A principal is a leader (and he wants to be your pal), or in financial transac-
tions, it’s the initial capital of an investment; a principle is a truth or tenet:
The principal is a good woman who follows the principle of goodwill toward
others.
Raise, rise
The verb raise is a transitive verb, which means it must be followed by a
direct object; rise is intransitive, which means it doesn’t require a direct
object:
James raised the window with one hand.
The window rises very easily.
Stationary, stationery
Stationary is an adjective that means immobile, while stationery is a noun that
you write on. If you can’t move, you are stationary, and if you want to share it
with the world, you write it on stationery.
That, which
A word of warning: This is general information and may be contrary to infor-
mation you find in your house style guide. Generally, that is preferred when
introducing an essential (or restrictive) clause:
The book that Elaine wrote over the summer turned out to be all right.
Which is preferred when introducing a nonessential (or nonrestrictive)
clause:
The book, which Elaine wrote over the summer, turned out to be all right.

Their, there, they’re
They’re easy to explain: Their is a possessive pronoun, like his, her, and its;
there indicates direction, like here (see a similarity in the words?); and they’re
is a contraction of they are:
Over there, my neighbors built a gold-plated garage; now they’re destitute.
Their house has been repossessed.
We’re, were
We’re is the contraction of we are, and were is . . . well, it’s the past second-
person singular, the past plural (for all persons), and the past subjunctive of
to be. But don’t let that scare you: If you can replace it with we are, you want
we’re; for everything else, you want were:
We were going to Hawaii for vacation, but we’re going instead to
Providence.
Who, whom
Here’s the easy way to solve this one, once and for all: If you can replace the
word with the subjective I, we, he, she, it, or they, use who. If you can replace
the word with the objective me, us, him, her, or them, use whom. For example,
“Who or Whom left their shoes in the hallway?” She did, so it’s Who for this
sentence. But “For whom or who does the bell toll?” It tolls for her, so it’s
whom for this sentence.
Want me to boil it down even more? If you can substitute an -m pronoun (him,
them), use the -m pronoun whom. Otherwise, use who.
Don’t like this rule? I’m not so fond of it myself. And neither are the more
relaxed style guides. Don’t sweat this one.
Who’s, whose
Who’s is the contraction of who is; whose is possessive:
Who’s the one responsible for leaving her shoes here?
I want to know now: Whose shoes are these?
If you have survived reading through this entire list, you are better prepared
to proofread than I was . . . last week, when I began researching these 
shyster-y words.

A Grab Bag of Other Common Errors
Following are a handful of language issues that crop up all the time and are
easily remedied:
 Confusing pronoun references and incorrect pronoun case: A pronoun
substitutes for a noun, of course. In She took a picture and sent it to her
mother, the noun is the picture and the pronoun is it. Easy enough.
A pronoun becomes confusing when a reader is forced to guess what it
refers to:
Ella never discussed what happened to the car during her vacation to
California, where she learned to walk on her hands for minutes at a time.
This has become quite the topic of discussion in our circle.
What does This mean? What happened to Ella’s car? Or that Ella can
walk on her hands for minutes at a time? One possible rewrite is Ella’s
refusal to tell us about the car has become quite the topic of discussion in
our circle.
Just a wee bit more on pronouns. I hear a lot of this abuse in conversa-
tion: Her and her sister enjoy eating crushed ice. Here is an SAT plural-
subject trick: If you break down the sentence into She enjoys eating
crushed ice and Her sister enjoys eating crushed ice, you will more clearly
hear the error — the sentence should read She and her sister enjoy eating
crushed ice.
 Errant or missing capital letters: Capitalization varies by house style, so
be sure to check the reigning guide in your publishing house or organiza-
tion before you get started. Here’s when capital letters are usually
required:
• The first letter of every sentence. The first letter of every sentence.
• Proper nouns. Sarah brought a Scrabble game to my sister Sam’s
house.
• Nationalities. While in Europe, I like to eat French food, wear Italian
leather, and date Spanish men.
• Brand names. I rode my Vespa to the Piggly Wiggly and bought a
Kodak Instamatic camera.
• Titles of books, plays, works of art, and so on. That strange film
Eyes Wide Shut was based on the novel Traumnovelle, I hear.
• Some acronyms and initialisms, such as abbreviations of organiza-
tions. Some PTA presidents cited high SAT scores as a benchmark for
superior school systems.
196
Part IV: Adding to Your Repertoire

When mother, aunt, uncle, and so on are used to directly address a
person, they should be capitalized as proper nouns. For example, After
school, my father told me to go to bed, but After school, Father told me to
go to bed.
The words earth, moon, and sun, as well as the names of the seasons —
spring, summer, winter, and fall (or autumn) — are not capitalized. Nor
are the names of decades, such as the fifties or the eighties. Unless begin-
ning a sentence, names like iWon, eBay, and iMac should not be capital-
ized. (Avoid using them at the beginning of sentences, if you can.) Some
last names of European origin may contain particles that are not capital-
ized, unless they are used alone: Sunny von Bulow as opposed to Von
Bulow.
 Essential and nonessential clauses: Essential clauses and nonessential
clauses both convey additional information about a word or phrase in a
sentence. The principal difference is that a nonessential clause can be
eliminated without changing the overall meaning of a sentence, while
removing an essential clause alters the meaning of a sentence.
Consider this example:
The copyeditor, who is an essential part of the editing team, works with the
editor to perfect a manuscript.
Here, the removal of the nonessential phrase — the words offset by
commas — wouldn’t change the essential meaning of the sentence,
which is that the copyeditor works with the editor to perfect a manu-
script.
However, take a look at this sentence:
Copyeditors who always make or beat their deadlines make editors very
happy.
If the essential clause who always make or beat their deadlines was
removed, the meaning of the sentence would be changed. This would
imply that the mere presence of copyeditors makes editors happy,
regardless of anything else — wishful thinking.
 Inconsistent parallelism: Be sure that sentences containing a series or
other matching elements are grammatically equal. Consider this example:
We planned to read a few manuscripts, go to the beach, and dinner.
We planned to dinner? How ’bout:
We planned to read a few manuscripts, go to the beach, and eat dinner.
 Sentence fragments and run-ons: In some cases, house style may allow
for fragments (such as in For Dummies books). But run-ons are usually a
no-no, except perhaps if a fiction author uses them to create a distinct
voice.
Assuming that you need to correct these errors, here’s an example of
what you’re looking for:
197
Chapter 12: Boning Up on Punctuation and Usage

Copyeditors should attempt to correct all errors found within a document.
For example, sentence fragments and run-ons.
The second is a fragment — and a very common error. Here’s an easy
change:
Copyeditors should attempt to correct all errors found within a document,
such as sentence fragments and run-ons.
 Subject and verb agreement: The subject(s) and verb(s) of a sentence
must agree in number and person. Consider this example:
The copyeditor and the editor is working together on the manuscript.
If that doesn’t sound grating, read it again — out loud and at the top of
your lungs. The subjects are joined by and and require a plural verb. The
sentence should read as follows:
The copyeditor and the editor are working together on the manuscript.

o one likes an appendectomy except for the doctor getting paid to per-
form it. And while you’re sitting there in your hospital gown waiting to
go into the operating room, it’s comforting to realize that, with all that could
go wrong, your doctor knows more about the human body than just the
appendix.
The more you know about a subject, the better equipped you are to deal with
its nuances, and the kingdom of copyediting and proofreading is by no means
exempt from nuance. To be well rounded in the publishing industry, you’ve
got to be able to wield terms like table of contents, bibliography, and, well,
appendix.
In your many years of reading — for school and for fun — you have undoubt-
edly encountered all the sections of a book and magazine. But as a consumer,
you may have had little reason to pay attention to the parts I discuss in this
chapter. For instance, I bet you’ve never read an entire copyright notice. Who
would? Most likely, you flip right past that page. And the half-title page of a
book? Who cares — you already know the name of what you’re reading! But
now, in your role as copyeditor or proofreader, you have to view the structure
of a book or magazine through a whole different lens, and the parts other than
the story or subject matter itself take on a whole lot more importance.
In this chapter, I help you get familiar with the language of the book and mag-
azine publishing industries. Armed with this knowledge, you’ll have no prob-
lem communicating efficiently and accurately with a production team. Your
ability to “talk the talk” like a copyediting or proofreading pro — from your
first day on the job — inspires confidence in those around you, which may
lead them to take more risks with you. (Translation: more work and better
assignments for you.)

You don’t need a doctorate in etymology to understand publishing termi-
nology. Even more encouraging, the terms I discuss here are standard to
the industry, so you’ll be understood no matter which publisher(s) you
work with.
So get your scrubs on — it’s time for an anatomy lesson. We’re going to lift
the dressing off some things you’ve scratched the surface of a thousand
times before. We’ll start by peering at a book’s front matter, back matter, and
everything in between. Sexy.
Unwrapping a Book’s Front Matter
I hope you don’t have your sights set on designing a book’s cover. Graphic
artists, both freelance and those working for publishers in-house, generally
work their special magic with the cover text and art — you won’t be much
(if at all) involved with the cover. Though you may be asked to copyedit or
proofread back cover copy, the areas of your jurisdiction as copyeditor or
proofreader usually begin with what is known in the industry as front matter.
Generally, front matter consists of these elements:
 Marketing pieces such as ads and bits of praise (blurbs) for the author
and/or book
 The title and half-title pages
 The copyright page
 The table of contents
Depending on the book’s content, you may also find an introduction or pref-
ace, usually written by the author, and/or a foreword, usually written by a
well-known contemporary of the novelist or a renowned industry guru or
specialist. Acknowledgments pages often come in the front matter too.
Ads and blurbs
Ah, the all-important marketing message. A lot of fiction publishers have now
taken to placing ads on the inside of the front cover or the first page of the
book. Here, the publisher is taking a personal interest in the reader — and his
next book purchase. Where better to capture the attention of the reader with
enticing ads for books by the same author or of the same genre?
200
Part IV: Adding to Your Repertoire

Next come the shiny and sometimes grandiose accolades for book and
author. If you’re proofreading, you give the newspaper reviews and praise
from the author’s contemporaries the once-over — the last thing you want is
typos or other errors mucking up the kudos. After making it to production,
believe me, the author deserves to bask in the spotlight. Just the fact that
he’s written this book means you’ve got work to do . . . so hail to the author!
Title and half-title pages
At first blush, the difference between these parts of the book may be some-
what confusing. But trust me: These two pages are distinct from one another.
The half-title page includes the title, and that’s it. The title page contains a lot
more information than that. The industry standard is for the title page to
include the following:
 The title
 The subtitle, if there is one
 The edition
 The author(s) name(s)
 The author(s) affiliation(s) if you’re working on a textbook
 The publisher name and location
If space allows, you may even find the copyright notice tagged onto this page.
(I cover copyrights in the next section.)
Placement of the pages follows a particular sequence established by the pub-
lisher. Usually, the half-title page appears first. It may be placed on a right-
facing page and be the first page of the book, or it may appear immediately
following the ads and blurbs. If the publisher wants to get really fancy
schmancy, it may try to make the half-title page stand out more by including
an elaborately designed page or a blank page just before the half-title page.
This page is called a frontispiece.
The title page usually comes second in the sequence and is also placed on a
right-facing page. Often the title page appears on the third page in the book
and may be placed just after a card or series page. The card page lists other
works by the same author; the series page lists works from the same series
that are offered by the publisher.
Some books may also include a page just before the beginning of the first
chapter that also features the title of the book. This practice is common if the
author’s story spans several “books” or “parts” which are to be combined
under one title.

Chapter 13: Dissecting Books and Magazines

Necessary legals: The copyright page
From a legal standpoint, the copyright page is arguably the single most
important page in the book. But you don’t need to be a legal eagle to eagle-
eye this page; the publisher provides the legalese for the copyright notice.
If the book is being published by a large publishing company, the copyright
notice is likely to have been written and reviewed by not one or even two
people, but by a whole team of corporate attorneys. But, even though 20 well-
dressed and seasoned attorneys may have collectively written and reviewed
the copyright notice, don’t assume it’s error free.
Whether you’re copyediting or proofreading, you need to review this page.
But what are you looking for exactly? The notice should begin with a copy-
right symbol (©), but the spelled-out word copyright is also acceptable. You
may bump into both the symbol and the word, even though both are not nec-
essary. The copyright symbol is immediately followed by the year the mater-
ial was copyrighted and the name of the person or entity holding the
copyright. Next, the publisher should include a blurb known as the copyright
notice, which includes a few standard lines about who the copyright belongs
to and the protections the copyright offers. Go grab a book — go! go! — and
check the copyright page to get an idea of all this.
Are all these legal terms and rules making you nervous? Well, relax. Relative
to the body of the text, the work here is fairly superficial. Whether you’re the
copyeditor or proofreader, you make no major changes to the legal terminol-
ogy. Most of the legal responsibility falls to the author and the publisher, and
all you need to do is spot if a certain item in the copyright has been omitted.
If you suspect there is an error or an omission in the notice, pose a query to
the assigning editor and move on.
Two other important items need attention whether you’re a copyeditor or
proofreader: the Cataloging in Publication record (known as CIP data), if there
is one; and the International Standard Book Number (ISBN). The last thing
you want is an author’s name misspelled in the data or an ISBN with a miss-
ing digit!
In addition to checking the language of the copyright page, you also want to
check its placement. Believe it or not, even the placement of the copyright is
dictated by law, so make sure it appears prior to the fifth page in the book
and immediately after the title page. Although some publishers place the
copyright notice on the title page, you’ll find that the copyright makes its
appearance on the reverse side of the title page in most cases. The author
may also include his credits and acknowledgments on the copyright page;
this is not dictated by law but is an option left up to the editor’s, author’s, or
publisher’s discretion.

ToCs for you and me
If you truly want to sound like a seasoned editor or proofreader, muster
up your best blasé behavior and refer to the table of contents as the ToC
(“tee-oh-see”).
First things first: Not all books contain a ToC. So if you find yourself franti-
cally searching and failing to find one, furiously flipping through the first five
or six pages of a book with one hand and ready to speed-dial the publisher
with the other, stop it now! Only if what you’re looking at is a nonfiction or
specialty book do you need to sound the alarms.
If the book you are copyediting does include a ToC, the editor should place it
as early as possible in the front matter. The placement takes into considera-
tion the fact that the reader should not have to fish through many pages of
introductions to find the ToC.
An author-provided ToC should list the elements in the front matter; the
chapter titles and subtitles, if appropriate; and the back matter, such as
appendixes and the index. If you’re the copyeditor, you won’t have the

lems. Many a copyeditor has saved the author
and publisher a lot of headaches and millions of
dollars in lawsuits.
But how? Even though publishers are careful
about lawsuits and possible slanderous mater-
ial and many times have book manuscripts
reviewed by a lawyer (called vetting) for any
potentially libelous information, you should
always be on alert for copyright infringement
and statements that could be deemed slander-
ous. Make no mistake: Most authors have no
intention of lifting text from other publications
without giving credit and do not set out to slan-
der anyone. Sometimes they just don’t realize
that they are using a copyrighted work, or
they’re unaware of the implications. Other
times, they just plain forget to provide the editor
with the information necessary to properly
credit a source. In the author’s defense, there’s
a lot that goes into writing a book, and if all goes
well, the necessary information will be placed
in a list of credits or acknowledgments that the
author provides to the editor. If it doesn’t go
well, you can help spot the omission and bail the
author out.
For tips on spotting plagiarism and/or slander-
ous language, see Chapter 5.

page numbers on the ToC, but by the time the book is ready for a proofread,
the numbers should be there. And if not, it is up to the proofreader to
insert them.
A proofreader’s role in checking the ToC is very important. You need to check
page numbers, chapter numbers, and — very important — chapter titles. You
must make sure the chapter titles on the ToC reflect the chapter titles in the
text, including the capitalization. If they don’t, be sure to query as to which is
correct. If you proofread an educational or specialty book, there may be addi-
tional heads in the ToC that need the same attention as the chapter titles.
Give the ToC a lot of TLC. It deserves special, nuzzly consideration as its
accuracy is critical to the work.
Introductions, prefaces, and forewords: 
So many ways to begin
Confused about which terminology to use for the introductory statement?
Ever wonder why some books have an introduction while others have a pref-
ace and also, maybe, a foreword? You’re not alone.
While the term introduction is often used interchangeably with preface, these
elements are not wholly the same — in fact, the objective for each is quite dif-
ferent. Authors and even seasoned copyeditors may be hard pressed to make
the proper distinction, so don’t despair if you were unaware of this fact until
now. (Now you can police the correct usage of each term and spread the
word about correct usage to others!)
Each introductory statement has its own nuanced meaning and use. To make
appropriate use of the headings, keep the following rules in mind:
 The introduction is usually written by the author (or, if a book consists
of contributions by different writers, the editor) and offers background
information on the subject matter of the book.
 A preface is also usually written by the author but describes the objec-
tive or reasons for writing the book.
 A foreword is not usually written by the author. Instead, it may be writ-
ten by a contemporary of the author — generally someone who is well
known and/or writes a lot of books from the same genre.

Part IV: Adding to Your Repertoire

Baring a Book’s Back Story
Not all books include indexes, appendixes, glossaries, notes, or bibliogra-
phies. But if you work on nonfiction manuscripts, especially educational or
specialty texts (like science publications), you can expect to see these ele-
ments quite frequently.
If you’re copyediting, you’re not usually responsible for editing an index
because this element is created late in the production process, after your
participation in the project ends. However, if you’re proofreading, the index is
definitely part of your territory. As proofreader, you go through the index
with a fine-tooth comb. Your house style documentation (see Chapter 14)
should include information about the format of index entries.
Appendixes
You won’t commonly find appendixes in works of fiction. However, if you
copyedit or proofread educational texts or works of a particular specialty,
expect to be knee-deep in them.
The style and format of appendixes differ depending on the content, the type
of book, and the publisher. As always, the assigning editor counts on you —
the intrepid copyeditor or proofreader — to ensure uniformity. The most
important thing you can do during your copyedit or proofread is ensure that
the appendixes appear in the proper order and have a consistent format.
(And keep in mind that if there’s an Appendix A, it had best be followed by
Appendix B.)
Glossaries
Ah, the glossary . . . Brings back memories of elementary school vocabulary
quizzes, doesn’t it? Sigh.
Not all books have them, but if yours does, the glossary will contain defini-
tions of words the author thinks the reader ought to know to fully compre-
hend the story or content in the book. As copyeditor or proofreader, your
main concern is to check for proper alphabetization and consistency of over-
all page format and format of the definitions. As copyeditor, ensure the defini-
tions are straightforward and simple to understand. It wouldn’t make any
sense for the definitions in the glossary to be so complex that they need their
205
Chapter 13: Dissecting Books and Magazines

own glossary, right? And make sure, too, that the part of speech of words and
their definitions match — no “flusterated: someone who is flustered and frus-
trated.” As proofreader, if you find entries that don’t meet these criteria,
query away.
Notes and bibliography pages
As I explain in Chapter 5, a note can take the form of a footnote (located at the
bottom of the page where an item is being discussed) or an endnote (located
at the back of the book). What’s in a note? One of two things: reference infor-
mation that tells the reader where the author got his information, or some
extra content for the reader who can’t sleep until she knows even more about
the topic at hand.
A bibliography is a comprehensive list of sources that the author used while
creating the book.
The style of editing used for a particular book — such as APA, Chicago, or
MLA (see Chapter 5) — determines how notes and the bibliography are han-
dled. Each style has its own rules for indentation, capitalization, order of
information, and punctuation.
If you’re proofreading notes and bibliographies, you have to make sure that
all the necessary information is included and presented in the right order and
right style. Here’s what makes the job challenging:
 Typically the typeface is smaller than the rest of the book.
 There are a lot of numbers (dates of publications, volume numbers, page
references).
 You have to pay careful attention to the multitude of names (authors of
the publications) and titles of sources.
But if proofreading these elements is a challenge, copyediting notes or a bibli-
ography can be downright daunting. The author provides the information for
the notes or bibliography. If the author is diligent, your job shouldn’t be too
tough. But if the author is less than perfectly organized, well . . . let’s just say
you may be spending some quality time on these pieces.
Taken at face value, the bibliography has the appearance of being a fairly
easy edit because each entry is short and amounts to only about two or three
lines of text. However, within each grouping of text lay potential pitfalls. You
need to put your powers of concentration on high, and don’t give up! Like
most things I cover in this book, copyediting the bibliography becomes
easier with practice. Scout’s honor.
206
Part IV: Adding to Your Repertoire

There’s nothing more frustrating than discovering you need to revisit a sec-
tion of text because you began editing using the wrong guidelines, so before
you pick up that red Ticonderoga pencil, prepare a plan of attack. You need
all the ammunition you can get your hands on for this task. Review your
handy-dandy house style sheet and dust off that style manual — you’re going
to need them both!
Examining Everything in Between
After you copyedit or proofread a text for grammar, syntax, meaning, and all
the rest, you need to revisit the middle section of the book to check for uni-
formity of page format.
In the publishing world, page format is known as the typographical style.
Because typographical style can vary by book and from one publisher to the
next, you want to check with your editor for direction before you begin mark-
ing your edits.
This round of editing or proofreading requires a change in focus. You want to
remain just as vigilant and detailed as ever, but you need to take a few steps
back to look at the bigger picture. No, keep going . . . farther, farther — until
you no longer see individual letters and words on the page but are viewing
blocks of text surrounded by white space.
Although each book you edit may have a different typographical format, rest
assured that there are a finite number of format errors. With a little experi-
ence and practice (and this book to jump-start the learning process), spot-
ting these errors becomes second nature in no time. I go over some of the
more common typographical errors in the following sections.
Heads
The term heads can refer to two types of elements:
 Running heads, which are found at the top of the page and made up of
the book title or chapter title and page numbers (folios)
 Chapter headings and subheadings, which are part of the body of the text
Running heads
Even as technology pushes publishing companies to experiment with increas-
ingly diverse and creative typographical formats, tradition holds fast when it
comes to running heads. The most common practice in the industry is to
207
Chapter 13: Dissecting Books and Magazines

place the book title on the left-hand (verso) page in the running head and the
chapter title on the right-hand (recto) page.
Page numbers often appear in running heads as well (although they may
appear in the feet, which I discuss in a moment). Some publishers prefer plac-
ing page numbers on both left- and right-hand pages. Others may include
them only on odd or even pages. See the upcoming “Folio” section for more
details.
Chapter headings and subheadings
White space and headlines are commonly, and judiciously, used to break up
blocks of text into neat parcels. Tricks of the trade that set headings and sub-
headings apart from the body of the text include varying the font face and
size or using small caps, all caps, italic, or boldface type.
Different levels of headings are set in different styles to denote a hierarchy.
(See Chapter 16 for specifics about how to designate these styles using type-
codes.) As a copyeditor, your job may require that you make decisions about
when to use the various levels of headings to help organize the text in the
most logical way. As a proofreader, your job most definitely includes ensuring
that the various levels of headings and subheadings are represented consis-
tently on the page.
Feet
The term feet refers to the footer — any text placed at the bottom of the pub-
lished page. Not all books have feet, but those that do may place page num-
bers and/or footnotes in that area. As with endnotes or a bibliography,
footnotes must be proofread very closely for adherence to the particular
style of the publisher.
If you’re proofreading a book whose feet contain footnotes and page num-
bers, watch for a common error: footnotes overwriting page numbers.
Folio
Speaking of page numbers . . . When you proofread a book, you have to pay
attention to every one of them. In book parlance, the page number is called
the folio. You must check every folio for sequence and uniformity. In addition
to the numbering itself, you need to notice if the folio appears in the same
place on each page, and you need to know whether it should appear only on
even-numbered or odd-numbered pages.
208
Part IV: Adding to Your Repertoire

The text of a book almost always begins on page one, and page one will
always be a right-side (recto) page. This means that throughout the book, all
the recto pages will be odd numbers. All the left-side (verso) pages will be
even numbers.
Arabic numerals are the norm for the folio in the body of a book. But when it
comes to the front matter, there are many different acceptable formats.
Sometimes, the pages that make up the front matter do not have page num-
bers themselves. Usually, numbering the pages of the front matter becomes
necessary when the front matter contains content such as an introduction, a
preface, or a foreword. One way to differentiate the pages of the front matter
from the body of the book is to use lowercase Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, and
so on) in the front matter. However, some editors use Arabic numerals
throughout a book, beginning the numbering with the front matter.
Your responsibility as copyeditor or proofreader is to flag any inconsisten-
cies in numbering format or style. Also, should edits require that pages be
deleted or added, you need to mark the pages appropriately for the editor.
Margins
Obviously, margin sizes vary depending on the publisher and the type of
book. Publishers are always trying to find the perfect balance between
margin size and text for easier reading. (We voracious readers can certainly
attest to the negative effects of having too much text and too little white
space on a page.) The white space allotted for the margins should create a
Zen-like balance between margin and text. Readability is key. Ohmmm . . .
As with style and formatting, the assigning editor should provide guidelines
on the page setup. Margins are almost never exactly equal on all sides. The
header margin may be smaller than the footer (or vice versa). And in most
publications, the gutter margin (the side of the page that is bound in the
book) is wider than the outside margin, which ensures that the type can
easily be seen and read after the pages are bound.
Proofreaders are expected to ensure the uniformity of margin size and the
alignment of text (and, of course, the alignment of the running heads and feet
contained in the top or bottom margins).
Left behind: Widows and orphans
As you delve deeper into typographical style, you will feel more confident
about your ability to spot problem areas. High on your list of important
things to remember is that publishers are very concerned with the aesthetics
209
Chapter 13: Dissecting Books and Magazines

of the printed page. Until you have a lot of experience, spotting inconsisten-
cies can be more instinctual, and if you review the pages for uniformity, you
instinctively know to flag anything that looks out of place — like widows and
orphans. Find it in your heart to help them.
A widow refers to a line of text at the top of a page or column that is — you
guessed it — hanging there all alone without anyone to keep it company. The
line of text is likely to belong to the last sentence on the preceding page or in
the preceding column and, due to margin constraints, does not fit on the pre-
ceding page or in the preceding column. A similar lone line can occur at the
end of a page or column; this is your orphan.
If you run your eyes along each page, searching for format errors, widows
and orphans are easy to spot. Just remember that each page should have a
clean, concise appearance and should include at least a few lines of text, even
if you’re reading the last page in a chapter. Flag down and save any line of
text from the loneliness that comes with standing alone on either the top or
the bottom of a page. Aside from being visually jarring to the reader, a string
of text hanging out alone on a page may also be misconstrued by the reader
as a header.
Exactly how does an editor make space for widows and orphans? There are a
few tricks: Editors can take space from the bottom margin, edit a paragraph
to lose a line, or visually adjust the space above and below a head to pull up
the text.
Piecing Together a Magazine
In the magazine world, book is slang for the magazine itself. The usage is
telling: It hints at the difficulty of producing issue after issue chock-full of
enough content to fill an actual book. Obviously, no two magazines are struc-
tured exactly the same, and scholarly journals are very different animals from
consumer magazines. In the sections that follow, I explain the pieces of a
magazine that you’re most likely to encounter, focusing primarily on con-
sumer mags.
For an overview of how a magazine is produced, be sure to check out
Chapter 2.
The cover
You may not be able to judge a book by its cover, but consumer magazine
publishers hope you judge their products by the covers. They know they may
get only a brief glance from you while you’re waiting in the checkout line, so
the cover has to scream “Buy me!”
210
Part IV: Adding to Your Repertoire

The cover of any magazine conveys its tone and advertises its wares to its
target audience. The elements that in-house designers and marketing and
sales people use to manipulate the cover include the following:
 The logo: A magazine’s logo is designed to fit the mission of the maga-
zine and usually appears on the cover in the same spot for each issue.
 Coverlines: These are the headlines found on a magazine’s cover. In con-
sumer magazines, you see certain words and phrases used over and
over in coverlines, such as sex, lose weight fast, and reduce stress.
Celebrity names and timely events also get prominent play in coverlines.
(Timeliness is important in this industry; current events should still be
current by the time the magazine hits the newsstand.)
If you really want to talk the talk, refer to the coverlines at the top of the
magazine cover as rooflines.
 Cover art: The cover art should have something to do with the cover-
lines or should at least reflect the magazine’s mission. The cover art may
also include a burst: a seal- or star-like image containing text like Plus: 19
Hot New Gadgets!
 UPC/label box: Many consumer magazines create two slightly different
covers for each issue: one for subscribers and one for people who will
pick up the magazine at their local drugstore. The latter will feature a
box on the cover that contains a UPC code for easy scanning at the
checkout counter. The cover for subscribers may instead have a blank
box on the cover in which the delivery address can be printed (or a
label affixed).
 Spine: This term refers to the bound edge of the magazine. The spine is
the part that shows when you line up your National Geographic collec-
tion chronologically on your bookshelf. Generally, the spine contains the
date, issue, name of the magazine, and sometimes some fun summary of
the topic in that issue.
Magazines that are bound using saddle stitching (staples or stitches
through the fold) don’t have a spine. That’s why your chronological col-
lection of People doesn’t look so impressive on your bookshelf.
Some publications print both in the United States and overseas, resulting in
yet another cover tailored to the other readership. As a copyeditor or proof-
reader, you’re responsible for checking the magazine cover. (That’s not often
the case with books, as I explain earlier in the chapter.)
211
Chapter 13: Dissecting Books and Magazines

When copyediting and proofreading, be especially careful with the cover and
spine. You never want to miss an incorrect month, year, or volume number
printed on the spine, for example. And if the coverlines include page num-
bers, make sure, make sure, make sure the page numbers indeed match the
articles. One more thing: Often treated as a sort of hybrid of editorial and
marketing content, the cover can bend the house rules a bit, such as using
numerals instead of spelling out single-digit numbers.
The front matter
Referred to as the front of the book (or FOB), the first third of a magazine con-
tains elements such as these:
 The table of contents
 Letter from the editor
 Letters to the editor
 Boilerplate
 Masthead page
 Ads
Depending on the magazine, you may also find a contributing editors’ page
containing brief biographies and photos of writers who contributed articles
for that particular issue.
ToC
Yup, it’s that ToC (table of contents) again. All magazines contain them, and
they’re located in the first few pages (perhaps after a grandiose gatefold per-
fume ad). Depending on the magazine, the table of contents can include all
matter in the magazine as it appears in the issue, or it can be arranged by
type of matter, such as features, regular columns, or reviews.
The ToC page may also feature headlines for stories available only on the
Web, directing the reader to visit the Web site (and thereby ensuring the mar-
keting department gets its kudos).
At a magazine, copyeditors are more likely to be the ones who check for
internal consistency of page and title references across the magazine after
the layout has been finalized; proofreaders may see only the text of articles
before they’re laid out, or may see page spreads out of sequence as each
department turns in the pages it’s responsible for.
If a magazine’s ToC lists the volume and issue numbers, make sure these are
correct.
212
Part IV: Adding to Your Repertoire

If a magazine features pictures in the ToC, you need to ask whether the page
number listed with the picture should be the one the related article starts on,
or the one on which the picture actually appears. (I prefer to use the page
number that starts the article, but I’m not your editor!)
Letter from the editor
Usually, the top editor — an editor-in-chief or managing editor, for instance —
writes a brief introduction to the issue, often contained within one page and
always in the same spot each issue. This can be an article addressing con-
cerns within the scope of the magazine’s topic or an editorial expressing the
views of the editor within the context of a particular feature. Here, an editor
can express herself in her own language, be creative, and talk about the
things she feels are important, all tied into the magazine’s mission.
Letters to the editor
These are reader response letters sent to the editor or the magazine, wherein
readers praise and punish the magazine for its last few issues.
If you are asked to edit or proofread letters to the editor, take a look at
the “signature” of each letter to make sure the cities and states are listed 
consistently . . . and that the cities actually exist somewhere. Believe me, it
has happened that a city called “Xanadu” slipped into publication. Funny,
readers.
Boilerplate
The boilerplate is a box or section placed somewhere in the opening pages
that contains any combination of the following:
 Publisher details, like the name of the publisher and locations of its vari-
ous offices, as well as whether the publication is published weekly,
monthly, or on some other schedule.
 Issue details, such as the volume number and ISSN (International
Standard Serial Number issued by the Library of Congress to magazines,
newspapers, annual publications, and journals).
 Fine-print legalese, like notes to the postmaster in case of incorrect
addresses, permissions statements and information on where to obtain
reprint permission, advertising opt-out information for subscribers, sub-
scription and advertising rates, and any other tiny things you probably
don’t want to read.
The boilerplate is called this for a reason: After it’s created, the standardized
text within the boilerplate rarely changes — unless, say, the headquarters
move into another building.
213
Chapter 13: Dissecting Books and Magazines

Masthead page
The masthead contains the details of ownership and list of staff — it acknowl-
edges the management, creative staff, editors, and marketing people involved
in the publication. In some magazines, the editorial and business mastheads
are combined; in others, they are separated. The boilerplate can sometimes
be found on the masthead page.
Mastheads do change. Usually, somebody on the business end will make sure
the lists are correct, but always proofread the masthead for correctly spelled
titles, consistent spacing, and the like.
Ads
Let’s be frank: How many magazines can the average person really read? Now,
look at the magazine section of any bookstore: How many of those titles do
you think will be around in, say, a year or two? One reason so many con-
sumer magazines fold is that the business is just not very lucrative. There are
limited streams of revenue. Subscriptions and single-issue purchases aren’t
even the half of it. Literally. The bulk of a magazine’s revenue comes from —
shocker! — advertising.
Logically, then, magazines are chock-a-block with ads. Advertising depart-
ments tend to solicit ads from companies that reflect the mission and target
audience of that magazine, though this isn’t always the case (hey, money
talks). Take a peek at a magazine like Sports Illustrated, and you’ll see shiny
faces of athletes hawking the latest got-to-have sneakers, ripped fitness types
swearing by a vitamin supplement’s benefits, and photos of contraptions
designed to make you sweat. (You may even see ads for “sex enhancers” for
the midlife-crisis crew.) It’s unlikely that you’ll see ads for Betty Crocker cake
mixes or astrophysics software.
Copyeditors and proofreaders rarely deal with advertisements, unless an ad
is being designed in-house, which tends to happen only with very small, often
local publications.
The meat of a magazine
People don’t pick up and purchase a magazine for the front matter. No, we
pay for the juicy articles between the covers.
Referred to as the well or feature well, the middle section of a magazine con-
tains many types of articles, oftentimes separated into departments, or
columns contained in each issue. (For example, a department may be Beauty
Under $20 or New Makeup Revue, and each issue features something new
within the topic.)
214
Part IV: Adding to Your Repertoire

There is no standard for the number or length of articles contained within a
magazine, but there are strategic decisions behind the placement of articles
within a magazine. For example, the article considered most important to
the issue will likely be found toward the middle of the issue, in the middle
of the well.
Shorter, easier-to-swallow articles are referred to as briefs. Briefs are those
one-page snippets tucked between articles, and they give the reader a quick
something to read while on the bus. They tend to be 200 words or less but
still reflect the tone of the publication.
Longer topical articles are referred to as features, and they can span a
number of pages to cover a subject. Features are usually advertised on the
magazine cover in bigger, bolder fonts. Writers can get pretty creative in fea-
tures, taking time with descriptions of people and places. Usually, visually
appealing graphics and photos accompany these articles, and pull quotes
may be used to draw a reader in.
I’m sure you’ve read an article that requires you to turn to the back of the
magazine for the rest of the story. When an article continues on nonconsecu-
tive pages, this is called a jump.
A feature article may contain any number of the following elements:
 Head and deck: You know what a headline is, but did you know the
extra line of information following a headline is called a deck? This sub-
heading is also referred to as the tagline.
 Pull quote: The pull quote, also called a blurb, is a sentence excerpted
from the body of the article and emphasized in larger type to draw the
reader’s attention.
 Caption: This is a phrase or sentence that accompanies a picture or
image associated with an article.
 Sidebar: Often seen in feature articles, the sidebar is a smaller story
related to the article but separated from the copy by a box and often has
its own headline and deck.
 Graphic elements: Charts, graphs, pictures, drawings, or any other
images associated with the article fall into this category.
As a copyeditor or proofreader, you need to look at each of these elements,
making sure that captions correctly match their images, pull quotes match
the article, and everything seems coherent as a piece.
215
Chapter 13: Dissecting Books and Magazines

If any features jump to another page, make sure there are continued lines indi-
cating this fact to the reader. Oh, and make sure that the text carries over to
the jump page or pages intact — even one missing word can throw the reader
for a loop.
The back story
The back of the book (or BoB) refers to the final third part of the magazine,
often heavy on advertising. What else will you find here? You will certainly
find all those jump pages, or pages containing the remainders of feature arti-
cles. You will also see yet more departments and columns, often designed
to accommodate jump pages, and fractionals — ads that take up less than a
full page.
Also, almost every consumer magazine has a back page — a page on a theme
that is consistent issue to issue and is usually located opposite the inside
back cover.

Balancing Between 
Style and Rules
In This Chapter
 Arming your editorial arsenal
 Breaking the unbreakable rules
 Knowing your numbers, special displays, and punctuation
W
hen you first start copyediting or proofreading, you may curse the
whimsical gods of Style and Rules. Just about every rule has an excep-
tion. Or ten. For every style deemed standard, some know-it-all will claim to
know it better and that you need to work based on her style. The possibilities
are truly dizzying and can be tough to remember.
Fortunately, you don’t have to. The reason seasoned copyeditors and proof-
readers don’t spend their work days yelling “Fie!” and shaking their carpal-
tunneled fists at the heavens is this: You don’t need to know every
specialized style and rule and every idiosyncratic exception. You just have to
know where to look to figure them out. For this reason, you need a compre-
hensive arsenal of resources. In this chapter, I show you what you should
have in your arsenal.
After I help you stock your shelves (or hard drive) with the appropriate
resource materials, I then explain why the rules you find in those resources
aren’t hard and fast. A little creature called house style can always trump
another resource, so I introduce you to this fella as well.
Arming Yourself with Resources
Fret not: Despite the language I’m using, copyediting and proofreading don’t
always constitute an all-out battle. If you’re not a war-mongering type, think
of the resources I introduce here not as weapons but as members of a loyal
posse that you can count on to get you through any pinch. I promise you’ll
feel far more editorially confident surrounded by your go-to peeps.

Webster’s and other dictionaries
Let me start by introducing you to your best-est of friends. He’s the most
popular kid in school: class president, quarterback, and prom king, all
wrapped up in one bright-red book cover. His name is Merriam-Webster’s
Collegiate Dictionary, 11th Edition (Merriam-Webster). But his friends —
which you most certainly will be — call him Web 11. This is the dictionary
most commonly used by publishing houses, and if you buy the 11th edition,
you get a year’s free subscription to the online edition (www.m-w.com),
which has the advantage of frequent updates.
Unless you focus on British copyediting and proofreading (see Chapter 6) or
on specialized clients (such as the Outdoor Writers of America, which uses
its own glossary of terms), you will probably use Web 11. However, you
should certainly ask all new clients their preferred dictionary.
Webster’s has become synonymous with dictionary in the United States, and
the name is in the public domain. Be aware that not every Webster’s is a
Merriam-Webster. But some of the others are highly reputable as well. For
example, Webster’s New World Dictionary, 4th edition (Wiley) is the official
dictionary of the Associated Press and is used by many magazine publishers
as well as newspapers. Another dictionary used and preferred by many copy-
editors, particularly for the usage information, is the American Heritage
Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition (Houghton Mifflin).
Fortunately for you, the Webster family doesn’t get jealous, so it’s okay to
have a few other friendly dictionaries around. I recommend that you have
access to the following:
 The Oxford English Dictionary (Oxford University Press) (OED). The
OED is a 20-volume set that sells for nearly $1,000. Instead of coughing
up that kind of dough (and shelf space), you may want to opt for a sub-
scription to its online edition ($295 annually, $29.95 monthly). Or you
can get a print copy of The Compact Oxford English Dictionary — less
tout-worthy as a revered editorial accoutrement, but smaller than a barn
and, at roughly $30, way more affordable than the original.

Chicago and other style and usage guides
You’ve made all the right friends in the dictionary crowd, and now it’s time
to decide who will get invites to your gala style-guide soiree. If you know
what’s good for you, you’ll make The Chicago Manual of Style, 15th Edition
(University of Chicago Press) your guest of honor. This book is your bread
and butter; it’s your most important friend after your dictionary — unless you
don’t want to work in book publishing. If your focus is magazines, academic
journals, corporate publications, or any other type of writing that doesn’t
appear in a book, you’re likely to need another style guide as your date.
Here’s a guide to the guides so you know what you need to accomplish any
given job. First I list the style name and then the publication it’s based on.
 AMA: American Medical Association Manual of Style (Lippincott Williams
& Wilkins).
 AP: The Associated Press Stylebook and Libel Manual (Perseus Books):
This is the style bible for the vast majority of newspapers, making it an
indispensable resource for anyone who wants to proofread or copyedit
for them.
 APA: Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association
(American Psychological Association).
 CSE: Scientific Style and Format: The CSE Manual for Authors, Editors, and
Publishers (Council of Science Editors).
 Chicago or CMS: The Chicago Manual of Style, 15th Edition (University of
Chicago Press).
 Garner’s: Garner’s Modern American Usage by Bryan A. Garner (Oxford
University Press). This is the usage bible nowadays.
 GPO: United States Government Printing Office Style Manual (U.S.
Government Printing Office).
 Gregg: The Gregg Reference Manual, 9th Edition, by William A. Sabin
(Irwin/McGraw-Hill). This manual is a favorite of business writers and
has a great glossary of grammatical terms.
 MLA: MLA Style Manual and Guide to Scholarly Publishing (Modern
Language Association of America).
 NYT: The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage (Three Rivers
Press). It ain’t just for The New York Times. Time magazine uses it, as do
many other periodicals.
 Turabian: Kate Turabian’s A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses,
and Dissertations (University of Chicago Press). It’s mostly just a simpler
version of The Chicago Manual of Style, streamlined for the undergrad
world.
219
Chapter 14: Balancing Between Style and Rules

 WiT: Words into Type by Marjorie Skillin and Robert Gay (Prentice Hall).
This manual touts material similar to CMS, with additional insights on
grammar. Its popularity has remained surprisingly strong despite the
lack of an updated edition since 1974, because its advice is so timeless.
The only really outdated stuff is in the typography section.

The Unbreakable Rule: 
Rules Can Be Broken
Don’t get me wrong: I still don’t want to see you wearing white after Labor
Day, especially not accompanied by black dress socks and sandals. Please.
Some rules are for the world’s greater good.
222
Part IV: Adding to Your Repertoire

In the fashionable publishing world, however, anything goes (birthday suits
included if you work at home). The only rule that’s usually followed is this:
The author sets his own style and rules, so long as the author has the creden-
tials and mastery to make it work.
Don’t unilaterally cram an author’s work into a grammatical rule, especially
while proofreading or copyediting novels (or any genre for smaller publishing
houses). See the section on authorial voice in Chapter 4 for more informa-
tion, including why I’ve dubbed it “The most important section in this book.”
At the very least, your queries should be open to discussion. If authors stay
consistent in their alternative techniques, they can and should have carte
blanche when it comes to style and rules.
The hard part is recognizing when a new author should have carte blanche
because his wayward writing just works somehow. It’s sometimes tempting
for us as astute copyeditors and proofreaders to exert our astuteness onto a
manuscript. Yes, we strive for invisibility, and we try to keep the authorial
tone, but dang if I’m, er, we’re not getting credit for knowing that something is
a copy error.
So keep a loving editorial eye out for the little author. Let Stephen King and
his 100-million-copies-sold misspell every word if he wants. Let Arundhati
Roy, author of the beautifully written The God of Small Things, break every
rule and sentence into fragments willy-nilly. And don’t forget to let emerging
authors have enough leeway to become the next King or Roy. You both will
be glad you did.
Realizing When House 
Style Reigns Supreme
Even Stephen King would be in for a big surprise, however, if he were to write
a For Dummies book. In branded publishing, brand is king, even over King.
The house style guide is created by the publishing house to best build its edi-
torial brand, and that trumps all. No matter how much King may prefer using
etc., his Dummies editor would have to insist on changing it to and so on for
the sake of brand-building consistency throughout the many books in the
series.
This hierarchy of house style over author style is unique to branded publish-
ing. Yes, some of the more behemoth and self-important publishers fancy all
of their varying books branded to them, and therefore fancy themselves as
keepers (and creators) of house style guides that reign over author style, but
that’s only until one of their best-selling authors threatens mutiny over
heavy-handed manuscript changes.
223
Chapter 14: Balancing Between Style and Rules

Can a proofreader or copyeditor advocate and eventually have house style
overridden in these environments, too? Yes, but it’s not a good yes. If you’re
knowledgeable enough and authoritative enough, you may possibly be able
to usurp style power from your powerful and proud employer, but do you
really want to risk the damage that trying may cause? My advice? If preserv-
ing author style is a priority, bite your tongue until you’re back to working in
kindred environs.
With the majority of publishers in the world, house style is under author
style in the hierarchy, but it’s still very important. It’s the guide that your
publishing house created/cherishes/expects you to use on its books, unless
some vital author exception is needed. If an in-house editor doesn’t provide
you with the house style guide, ask for it. Use it. Honor it until death/the end
of the editing job do you part. And even then, don’t part too far from it
because you’ll need it for your next job with that publisher.
Committing a Few Rules to Memory
Most rules are rife with exceptions in this industry, but a few are so standard
and ubiquitous that they’re well worth memorizing. The time you spend now
will be saved tenfold on each new copyediting or proofreading job.
Treating numbers
Numbers are fun! If you didn’t detect any sarcasm in that statement, you may
be one of the specialized few eager and able to copyedit or proofread texts
about math and science.
The rest of us know those manuscripts officially as gobbledygook. I’m well-
schooled and financially literate, but marathon chalkboard formulas and 18-
digit numerals — even repeating ones — give me math vertigo. Or at least
that’s what I feign to get out of reading or copyediting them.
Here’s what you can’t feign: knowing the basic rules about incorporating
numbers into narrative (nontechnical or humanistic) manuscripts and into
technical (scientific) manuscripts. Definitely ask about house style for your
particular project because variant, hybrid treatments are common. But a few
rules are usually common to both genres and are worth committing to
memory for that reason:
 Never begin a sentence with a numeral. This rule is absolute, no 
matter what genre you’re working in. Spell out the number or reword the
sentence.
224
Part IV: Adding to Your Repertoire

 Style all numerals of the same class or type consistently in the text.
 Avoid using two unrelated numerals in a row: In 2007 40,000 people will
become millionaires, and I plan on being one of them. Fix this problem by
rewording the sentence: I plan on being one of the 40,000 people who will
become millionaires in 2007.
 Always use a numeral before an abbreviated unit of measurement, such
as 8 oz. or 7 lbs.
 Write a percentage as a numeral followed by the word percent.
Numbers in narrative documents
Narrative or nontechnical documents typically don’t have many numbers in
them, so the numbers are more frequently spelled out than in technical 
documents. You may find that these conventions hold true for most narrative
projects:
 Spell out numbers from one to one hundred.
 Use numerals for page numbers, chapter numbers, years, and dates.
 Spell out large numbers but only if they can be spelled out in two words:
fifty-nine thousand; three million.
Numbers in technical documents
Technical documents typically have the pleasure of being rife with numbers.
Hence, editors usually prefer numerals to spelled-out numbers because
they’re easier to find, easier to read, and less space-consuming. Here are two
rules that are fairly standard in technical copyediting and proofreading:
 Spell out numbers from one to nine.
 Spell out all units of measurement.
When correcting numerals that you want spelled out, you can circle the
numeral and then circle an “sp” in the margin. However, you risk that a 
compositor (the person preparing the laid-out text for publication) will mis-
spell the word. It’s always safer to spell the word out.
Using special display type consistently
Special display type constitutes anything that deviates from good ol’ fash-
ioned straight text. To keep special text through design attributes consistent,
it’s important to set (or learn) style rules that govern the full gamut of special
display.
225
Chapter 14: Balancing Between Style and Rules

Italics
Some authors really love using italics for emphasis. If an author needs to itali-
cize a word for emphasis, maybe the author just hasn’t found a strong
enough word. However, this use of italic is acceptable. Also acceptable uses:
to denote thoughts, imagined speech, remembered speech, foreign terms,
words used as words, letters used as letters, and sounds used as sounds.
Vrooooooom, vrooooooom — let’s drive on over to the section on SMALL CAPS.
Small caps
If your author is John Irving–esque, you may encounter small caps used to
render a yelling character’s words, reminiscent of the book A Prayer for Owen
Meany. But in general, small caps are usually limited to these instances:
 Signage and inscriptions (T-shirts, bumper stickers, billboards, and 
so on)
 Acronyms such as INTERPOL and UNICEF (but not FBI because you don’t say
“FBI” as a word — not in public anyway).
 Time and time periods (B.C., A.M., P.M., and so on), though definitely refer
to the publisher’s house style guide for the definitive answer on these
instances.
Boldface
Boldface works well in headings. (Doesn’t it? See above.) Occasionally you
find authors using it for emphasis, but that looks amateurish. Do yourselves
both a favor: Nix boldfaced type in that instance.

Creating and Using the 
All-Important Style Sheet
In This Chapter
 Documenting your every decision
 Using style sheets to everyone’s advantage
 Tasting some samples
T
he style sheet is all-important, exhaustive — and great for you. Not great
like a steamed broccoli floret when you’re trying to round out your diet.
Great like a bacon double cheeseburger on Sundays-don’t-count-on-my-diet
days. Great like Santa seeing, tallying, and rewarding your every good editor-
ial deed. If the style sheet could slow-dance, your heart might swoon right
into a marriage proposal.
In this chapter, I walk you through who uses a style sheet, what should be on
it, and how to use it. I also offer samples that you can feel free to use as start-
ing points for your own style sheets. While some of the information here is
specific to copyeditors, I encourage you to read it even if your goal is to
become a proofreader. As proofreader, you’re among the style sheet’s most
valuable audience members, and you may appreciate its performance all the
more by getting a behind-the-scenes tour of how it was created.
What’s the Big Deal about 
the Style Sheet?
If you’re working on any document that’s more than a few pages long, here
are some of the things a great style sheet can give you:

 Consistency: Copyeditors have to make myriad judgment calls because
every document is unique, and whatever choices are made must be
implemented throughout. Documenting each style decision is the best
way for the copyeditor to stay consistent and for the proofreader to
check that consistency.
 Efficiency: When it comes to saving time, the style sheet pays off expo-
nentially for everyone involved. Whether you’re the copyeditor or proof-
reader, you won’t have to look up the same word multiple times — nor
will the author, in-house editor, caption writer, indexer, designer, or
anyone else lucky enough to have the style sheet.
 Clarity: Immediately after copyediting or proofreading a manuscript,
you’re probably clear on how to handle certain conventions — for 
example, all state names absolutely have to be abbreviated instead of
spelled out. But two weeks later, when you’re reviewing the document
again after the author has made revisions, will you remember each 
convention? Like a toothsome trail of copyediting bread crumbs, your
style sheet safely leads you back to even the most cryptic of editorial
decisions.
Copyeditors, Know Your Audience
Yes, your audience will ultimately be droves of adoring readers who feast on
the error-free publication you help to create. And yes, you should know this
audience, as I discuss in Chapter 4.
But when you’re trying to decide what to include on your style sheet, you
must also have a different audience in mind: your fellow players in the stages
of production — all the people who’ll subsequently work with your copy-
edited manuscript, relying on your expertise, cross-checking your expertise,
and sometimes unwittingly undermining your expertise if your style deci-
sions aren’t clearly communicated to them.
All these players are concerned with the general well-being of the product,
but each of them has a few particular concerns. In the following list, I explain
some considerations you can give them on your style sheet to assuage those
concerns before you pass the manuscript along:
 The author: He cares most about the Style Notes (or General Notes) sec-
tion of your style sheet because his greatest concern is that you over-
ride the house style in every instance where author style should be
maintained (see Chapter 14). For example, each time you decide to let
The Author capitalize Words That Wouldn’t Normally Be Capitalized for
the sake of the story, you need to note that decision on your style sheet.
Otherwise, those exceptions will most likely be “fixed” by people work-
ing on the manuscript after you.
228
Part IV: Adding to Your Repertoire

 The proofreader: Depending on your work situation, more than one
proofreader may work on your document. If you’re copyediting a book,
up to four people could proofread the manuscript, with each proof-
reader doing a separate check of either the manuscript’s first pass or
second pass (see Chapter 2). Proofreaders are mostly concerned with
the Word List (or Alpha List) section of your style sheet because they’re
hoping you’ve conscientiously caught and confirmed the spelling and
usage of every word that may possibly be wrong.
 The compositor: This person, also called the typesetter, focuses mostly
on the Design Memo (or Typography or Typesetter Notes) section of
your style sheet. The compositor typesets each pass of the document
based on the design specs (created by the designer) and your typecod-
ing throughout the manuscript (see Chapter 16).
 The production editor: If you’re working on a book, this person roots
for you and for every section of your style sheet because every section
affects the manuscript’s ultimate success. (See Chapter 2 for a discus-
sion of what a production editor does.)
These are all discerning audience members, but don’t start getting stage
fright. They’re all on your team, working toward the common goal of a clean,
reader-worthy document.
The tone of your style sheet should exude expertise and confidence, but also
accessibility. Some copyeditors suggest that you convey your style decisions
as if you were speaking to an auto mechanic — someone who’s very capable
but very inexperienced when it comes to editorial style.
Deciding What to Put on 
Your Style Sheet
In this section, I put together a few simple rules to help you decide what to
list on your style sheet, along with details of just about every section that
you could possibly include. With this info, you’ll have all you need to win
over your audience and get a standing ovation at each project’s curtain call.
Recognizing a judgment call
The style sheet entry possibilities are endless, but the golden rule governing
them isn’t. Remember this little precious nugget: Every time you make a judg-
ment call about any aspect of the document, enter it onto your style sheet.
Noting your decisions helps keep them consistent throughout the document
and helps keep them intact while the document is being tweaked by the rest
of the production players.
229
Chapter 15: Creating and Using the All-Important Style Sheet

Do you need to note a typo on your style sheet? No. There’s no judgment call
involved. You correct the typo on the document page, and you’re a hero.
Same goes for misspelled terms. Exceptions exist but, again, they’re all gov-
erned by that golden rule: If you’ve made a judgment call, include it in the
style sheet.
For example, if you found the word recieved in a manuscript, you’d fix the
spelling error and move on — no need to enter it on your style sheet.
However, if it were part of the phrase a well received manuscript, then the
word also involves hyphenation, which often warrants a style decision on
your part. If house style is to hyphenate compound adjectives, you’ll likely fix
it and add well-received to your style sheet in two places: as an example
under punctuation to be used as a guideline for other compound adjectives
in the manuscript, and also in your Word List section so that all instances get
changed and those changes are maintained throughout the production
process. If your decision is to leave the hyphen out of well received, as the
author has it, you definitely have to alert others to your decision or else
they’ll follow house style and make the correction.
Now here’s where budding copyeditors often falter, and where you’re not
going to: You have to remember to make an entry on your style sheet
whether or not the house style is to hyphenate compound adjectives. Why?
Because you care. And caring copyeditors know that other people working
on the document will question the same thing (Do I hyphenate this compound
or not?).
Similarly, if you think a word is misspelled in the manuscript but end up find-
ing it in the dictionary, add it to your style sheet anyway. Just because the
word turned out to be spelled and used correctly, that doesn’t mean you
won’t question its nuances in the manuscript’s future. It also doesn’t mean
you’ll be the only one who questions its spelling and usage. It’s always better
to be safe than sheepish. Have confidence in your questions — and in your
consideration for those who may have those same questions themselves.
Noting essential issues
Every document is unique, but you can bet your bottom dollar that a few
issues arise again and again whether you’re copyediting books, Web sites, or
technical manuals. Stay on red alert for the following essentials:
 Numbers: You’ll be surprised at how many numbers find their way into
even the most narrative of manuscripts. With house style firmly in hand,
you’ll decide and document on your style sheet how they’re styled in
sums of money (60 cents or $0.60), four-digit numbers (8000 or 8,000),
dates (11 February 1998 or February 11, 1998 or 2/11/98 or . . . ), and
cross-references (pp. 291–298 or 291–8). You’ll also note the range of num-
bers to spell out (usually one through nine or one through ninety-nine).
230
Part IV: Adding to Your Repertoire

 Special display: Boldfaced and underlined text may appear in designed
headings, thanks to your typesetting codes (see Chapter 16). But the
bulk of your special display decisions will involve the use of italic. Will
you italicize all foreign words (even though italic is rarely used for some
Spanish words, such as España)? Will you use italic to express sounds,
remembered speech, and thoughts? Will I, for that matter? It appears so.
And how about using italic to denote letters as letters (such as the letter
s), words as words, emphasis — emphasis, TV shows, and magazines?
Song titles, too, or should those be in quotes? With house style as your
guide, it’s up to you to suggest what’s best for the book and to note it on
your style sheet.
 Reference sources used: If you find yourself delving into any source
other than the house-specified dictionary and style manual to make your
style decisions, it’s always good to note where you confirmed a defini-
tion, style, or historical fact — whether it’s a hardcover tome, online
database, New York Times best-seller, or obscure leaflet. This documen-
tation helps if you have to further research the issue moving forward or
if someone is conscientious enough to want to double-check your work.
 Punctuation: Some copyeditors divvy punctuation decisions into indi-
vidual style-sheet sections (Acronyms, Dashes, and so forth), but there
are a Chicago Manual of Style’s worth of potential issues and a dwindling
supply of trees. I recommend consolidating your punctuation choices
under the heading of Punctuation and bulleting each issue underneath
it. Common punctuation decisions include the following:
• Will you use serial commas (here, there, and everywhere)?
• How will you treat possessives of pronouns ending in s?
• Are you using three-dot ellipses only? Or should your style include
four-dot ellipses?
• Will you place a comma after Hence or Thus?
• Will you allow sentences ending in prepositions to maintain the
narrator’s conversational tone or the author’s conversational
style?
You may also have to address acronyms, quotation marks, and hyphen-
ation (Oh my!), as well as abbreviation and capitalization. Just follow the
yellow brick road and jot down any punctuation ambiguities you see
along the way. (For helpful reminders about how to use punctuation,
click your heels three times and see Chapter 12.)
 Design notes: This section may also be labeled Typography or
Typesetting codes. No matter what it’s called, it always consists of the
same information: the keys to all the design codes you’ve added to the
manuscript (assuming this is part of your job). Each code (or tag)
improves organization by adding emphasis through design. Common
231
Chapter 15: Creating and Using the All-Important Style Sheet

codes include CT (Chapter Title), CN (Chapter Number), FMH (Front
Matter Head), BMH (Back Matter Head), A (First-Level Heading), B
(Second-Level Heading), and NL (Numbered List). See Chapter 16 for a
full discussion of typecodes and their usage.
 Word list: In this section you note not only every word involving a style
decision, but also every word that you weren’t sure was being used 
correctly — even if it ended up being correct. Because you took the time
to look the word up in the house dictionary, do your proofreaders a
favor and let them know you did so in your style sheet. There’s a good
chance they’ll have similar questions, so you’ll save them a trip to the
dictionary.
Your dictionary also comes in handy with word issues involving continu-
ity. For example, if a book manuscript is set in the 1930s, you want to
note and confirm the author’s incorrect reference to a UFO — because
the first recorded use of that term in English didn’t appear until 1953.
Alphabetize this section. Doing so helps prevent the same word from
being included twice with different spellings, and it helps you double-
check words in a flash. Alphabetizing correctly is so important that
copyeditors also refer to the Word List as the Alpha List. (If you’re not
sure how to alphabetize certain entries, such as names that begin with
numerals, follow the alphabetization guidelines in your house style guide.)
Listing additional issues
All publishing projects more than a few pages long benefit from a style sheet,
but not all projects require the same style sheet sections. You have to note
only what you find and only what isn’t addressed by house style. In the previ-
ous section, I list style sheet categories you’re more than likely to require for
every project. Here, I note other possibilities that may or may not be applica-
ble depending on the specifics of your document:
 Locations: Some copyeditors include all nouns (people, places, and
things) in the Word List section, but if you find a lot of locations in your
manuscript — whether they’re real or fictitious — it’s best to give them
their own section.
 Characters: If a book or short story has fewer than five characters, you
could tuck them into your Word List, too, but boy is it handy to refer to a
single list of characters as the author introduces you to each new one.
Don’t forget to add an a.k.a. if a character has a nickname or an alias.
 Foreign terms: Especially if your document is academic or otherwise
specialized, you may want to pull foreign terms out of your Word List
and give each type its own convenient section (Italian Terms, Hebrew
232
Part IV: Adding to Your Repertoire

Terms, and so forth). Foreign terms that have Anglicized their way into
your house dictionary don’t have to be set in italic, and they can remain
in your Word List section.
 Tables: House style may state how to style tables. If not, maintain con-
sistent styles for column heads and table notes throughout your manu-
script by including them on your style sheet and citing an example.
 Lists: Whether lists are embedded in the narrative or extracted in outline
form, you may need to decide how to mark each item. Asterisks or let-
ters? Numbers or bullets? Note that you aren’t making design decisions
here; if house style specifies how to treat the type of list in question, you
don’t need to note anything on your style sheet. But if you’re making a
judgment call about how to treat a certain list, note your decision on the
style sheet. See Chapter 16 for details on dealing with lists.
 Small caps: If there’s any question whether to use small caps in a given
circumstance, note your decision on the style sheet. (Small caps are
often used for AM and PM; for slogans; for logos, emblems, and signs; and
for newspaper headlines.)
 Treatment of Web sites: Do you include the “http://” or start URLs off
with “www”? Should you bypass the period at the end of a Web link that
ends a sentence because readers may mistakenly type it into their
Internet browsers? (I’d advise you to include the period and give the
readers some credit, but if house style doesn’t address this issue, ask
the assigning editor what to do.)
 Footnotes: Provide style samples of footnotes used in the manuscript,
preferably one for each type of source credited (such as book, periodi-
cal, and Web site).
 Bibliography: Same for the bibliography section: Provide one style
sample for each genre referenced.
 Captions: Do you end captions with periods? Do you write them in the
present tense? Do you use labels of left and right even if there are only
two people in the photo? If any of these decisions are left up to you,
include them on the style sheet.
 Special symbols: Unless you’re copyediting math or science books (in
which case this section may be substantial), the only special symbols
you’re likely to come across are diacritical marks (é, ñ, and so forth).
Noting “European diacritics” is usually all it takes to keep these symbols
consistent and easily confirmed.
Wherever possible, show your style choices instead of telling them. Using
specific examples from the manuscript illustrates your style sheet entries.
Instead of noting just “en dash for dualisms,” add the phrase that inspired
your style decision (for example, their love–hate relationship).
233
Chapter 15: Creating and Using the All-Important Style Sheet

Also, to save time later, you may want to note the page number where a word
or style issue first appears, especially if you think there may be a future ques-
tion about it. Even if you’re copyediting electronically and plan to use the
global search feature (see Chapter 17) for changes document-wide, noting
these page numbers on your style sheet may still come in handy.
Proofreading Your Baby
I know, I know. Like you need more work to do. But your copyediting career
could very well be done with if you don’t. Remember, the style sheet is your
most vital and most visible of documents. Your employer or client knows this.
And your employer or client knows that you know this. So any mistake that
you miss on the style sheet is ten times the red flare of missing something in
the document.
Word travels as fast as your style sheet gets forwarded. If you’re working on a
book, it’s seen and scrutinized not just by your assigning editor but by the
author, the compositor, the proofreader, and anyone else these folks think
may get a big ol’ guffaw at reading a typo on your style sheet.
Don’t cower in fear — just be extra thorough about proofing your style sheet
because the stakes are so darn high. Searching for spell-check marks isn’t
enough. You want to catch an “on” that should be an “of” and an “it’s” that
should be an “its.” You want to catch a misspelled book title or author’s
name. You want to be sure your epic-length “Alpha List” is correctly alphabet-
ized right through to its zebra-striped stockings.
Sampling Style Sheets
All style sheets come with leeway regardless of genre. I’ve seen different sec-
tion names, orders, and hierarchies, but these samples are good reference
points. Just keep in mind that each document is unique, and each style sheet
should be, too.
Figure 15-1 shows a sample style sheet for fiction, Figure 15-2 a sample style
sheet for nonfiction, Figure 15-3 a sample style sheet for a specialized manu-
script, and Figure 15-4 a sample style sheet for a Web site.

Overall
1.  Four illustrations appear in the German edition. Their locations are now identified in the manuscript.  
2.  Biblical translations are numbered lists; keep an eye out for imported style problems. 
STYLE:
1.  Greek transliterations: (a) English word first with Greek in italics inside parentheses immediately afterward as often as 
 possible. (b) if Greek should be first, follow immediately with English in roman inside parentheses and quotation marks 
 at first use within a chapter. More than one English word is fine, of course. If we follow this practice, a glossary will 
 not be necessary. 
2.  Use SBL biblical abbreviations, even in running text. 
3.  Series of biblical citations: (a) “par/r.” used to indicate that there are parallels (b) semicolons okay within parentheses 
 (c) use “and” in place of last semicolon in running text. 
4.  “Matthew”/“Mark”/“Luke”: Use quotation marks when names are used to represent the authors of these documents. 
5.  Use serial comma. 
6.  Works by other authors that [Author] discusses have a footnote after the author’s name in the running text and then 
 in-text page numbers in parentheses following each quotation. Volume numbers are provided in the in-text citations. 
7.  Extracts must be at least six manuscript lines long. 
8.  Personification of the text is allowed (e.g., “The text wants to emphasize . . .”).

Putting the Style Sheet into Action
Whether you’re the copyeditor who created the style sheet or the proof-
reader benefiting from its thoroughness, never underestimate the power of
proximity. The closer you are to your style sheet, the quicker you may be to
use it. If you’re copyediting or proofreading electronically, have your style
sheet file open and adjacent to the document, if your screen is big enough to
show the split. If you’re working on hard copy, keep the style sheet within
arm’s reach at all times.
As a proofreader, you want to review the style sheet as soon as you get a pro-
ject. Become familiar with what’s on it so you know what to look for from the
minute you start the job. And if the length of the document is substantial
(you’re working on a book manuscript, for example), review the style sheet
periodically (between chapters, perhaps). Don’t let yourself get to the end of
a proofreading job and then discover you’ve missed something that was
spelled out on the style sheet. Maybe you’ve got house style memorized, but
you still have to make sure the copyeditor hasn’t identified exceptions. For
example, if an author doesn’t want to use the serial comma, you’d hate to
find that out after you’ve marked corrections throughout the document.
While proofreading, you may identify terms or other items that you think
should be added to the style sheet for the benefit of anyone who will see the
document after you. You can certainly make those additions, and you want to
identify them so the copyeditor or assigning editor knows to use the updated
version of the style sheet going forward.

Formatting a Manuscript

 Knowing the basic codes
 Preparing for pesky exceptions
I
f you want to copyedit book manuscripts, part of the job is to identify and
mark the parts of a manuscript (such as titles, headings, lists, block
quotes, and tables) that need to be displayed differently from the body text.
Why do you have to do this job? Because the text needs you! You swoop in
wearing a cape and save the manuscript from looking like one long block of
grayness. You’ve got the moxie and the means it takes to add visual emphasis
to the various elements within books.
Before we delve into how to mark these display elements, I need to clarify
some terminology. Let me start with the familiar word formatting. We use this
word whenever we change the standard typeface by, for example, using bold-
faced or italicized type. But the term also applies to the process of identifying
the display elements in a manuscript.
After you identify an element that requires special display, you use typecoding
or tagging to communicate to the compositor (typesetter) how to treat that
element. (Don’t know who the compositor is? Check out Chapter 2.) These
terms are closely related. The word typecoding is used when you mark a hard-
copy manuscript with the appropriate codes to identify display text, and it’s
sometimes used when the process takes place in an electronic file. But most
people in the publishing biz use the word tagging to mean typing display
codes into an electronic file (and the codes themselves, when placed in an
electronic file, are often called tags).
Don’t know what these mysterious codes are that I’m yammering about?
Don’t worry — I show you examples of codes in this chapter and explain why
and how they’re used.

Typecoding, tagging, codes . . . if the terms seem too technical to be any fun,
please believe me when I say that formatting a manuscript is a creative
process. Artistic, even. You’re going to love the codes when you see how
much work they save you.
Knowing Just Enough about 
Design and Composition
Let’s take a lightning-quick design tour. This section is like the first hour of a
Design and Composition 101 course. You need only the first hour because
even the second hour features way more design and composition info than
most copyeditors really need to know. Lots of scholarly copyeditor-types will
tell you differently, but even the most noxious of naysayers would have to
admit: Although it’s nice for a copyeditor to know a pica from third base, it’s
by no means necessary.
Peruse a book or article and notice how any special elements are set apart
from the regular text. You’ll find they’re set apart through varying design
attributes, such as different font types and sizes; through different-sized mar-
gins or different alignments (all the way to the left of the page, or centered, or
to the right); and through different many-other-things, all of which you don’t
need to know.
Here’s what you do need to know:
 How to notice anything in the manuscript that needs to be set differ-
ently from the standard manuscript text (for emphasis, for organiza-
tion, for display). Some display elements are obvious, but some aren’t.
For example, if a manuscript comes to you with headings all in the same
font, same size, no distinctions, as a copyeditor, you have to use your
judgment to determine which should be a level-one (main) heading,
which should be level two (a subhead), and so on. (Obviously, if you
have doubts, you need to query.) If there’s a list, you may have to study
house style to figure out if it should be a bulleted list, numbered list, or
checkbox list (and again, query if in doubt).
 How to relay that difference to the compositor. That’s what the rest of
this chapter is about.
Trust your designer. She knows that 6 picas = 1 inch = 72 points, and she will
decide to design your book’s chapter titles in, say, 28-point ITC Franklin
Gothic Heavy, small caps, indent 5 picas, leading 38 points b/b above and
below. Your job is much simpler: Just find the chapter title in the manuscript
and code it with a [CT].
242
Part IV: Adding to Your Repertoire

In case the compositor doesn’t know what [CT] stands for — or more likely,
what a less common code stands for — you also note in your style sheet
what each of your codes represents (“[CT] chapter title”).
That’s it. Same goes for all the other special elements of a manuscript or arti-
cle, and all their accompanying codes.
Meeting the Basic Codes
Most manuscripts require only a short list of codes, but you don’t need to
memorize even the most basic ones. The publisher will have its own list for
you to use; just keep it handy for easy reference. As I explain in the next sec-
tion, codes may be enclosed in square brackets or angle brackets when typed
into an electronic document. On hard copy, you normally circle the code let-
ters instead of enclosing them in brackets.
Following is a list of the most common codes:
243

 [CST]: Chapter subtitle
 [CEP]: Chapter epigraph

 [FMH]: Front matter head
 [BMH]: Back matter head

Placing Codes or Tags
While the codes themselves may differ slightly from publisher to publisher,
their placement on a hard-copy page or in an electronic file will likely be the
same no matter who you’re working for:
 On hard copy: When you copyedit on hard copy, a code that is circled
goes just to the left of the element to be coded. For example, you would
write CST at the beginning of a chapter subtitle and circle the code.
With some elements (lists, for example), you have to show where the
element begins and ends using angled L-type marks. Look at the section
“Hard-Copy Typecoding Sample” toward the end of the chapter to see
what I mean.
 In an electronic file: Tags (codes that are typed into electronic files) are
placed at the beginning and end of an element that requires display, and
they are enclosed within either square brackets or angle brackets. The
tag that indicates the end of the element to be displayed must have a 
virgule (forward slash) in front of the letters — that’s how the compositor
identifies it as an end code. So, for example, you would type [CST] or
<CST> in front of a chapter subtitle and [/CST] or </CST> at the end.
Check out the section “Electronic Tagging Sample” at the end of the
chapter to see tags in action.
When you tag an electronic file, you have a great time-saving tool at your dis-
posal: the macro. A macro is a shortcut that lets you hit one key or click on
one icon on your toolbar and execute a series of commands that would other-
wise give your fingers cramps. Macros are lifesavers for inputting tags. If you
haven’t used them before, type “create macros” into the Help menu in Word,
or Google “macro” and the name of your software to find instructions for set-
ting them up.
Taking Special Care with Extracts
Extracts — block quotes — require a little extra attention because they’re
quite common in nonfiction and textbooks, they vary according to their con-
tent, and they’re often tucked inconspicuously into the running text. It’s your
job to recognize and rustle them up into display text whenever you feel
they’d be better off as designed elements.
You should have no trouble noticing when a quote in the text is way too long
to stay there. Anything more than 40 words — about three lines — is too long
to be readily followed by readers. In an electronic document, you block it out
like so:
244
Part IV: Adding to Your Repertoire

As CEO Howard Lackey was always so fond of saying each morning upon
entering my office: [EX] “Ah, Andrew, as you can see by my leaden eyes, I
was again up late last night doing things that even young chic bachelors
like yourself could never dream of. Let me remind you of my 24-hour rou-
tine, again. Sleep for eight seconds, get up to see why my beautiful twin
baby girls are crying, try every possible solution twice until they stop
crying, go back to sleep for eight more seconds.”[/EX]
So it may be designed something like this:
As CEO Howard Lackey was always so fond of saying each morning upon
entering my office:
Ah, Andrew, as you can see by my leaden eyes, I was again up
late last night doing things that even young chic bachelors
like yourself could never dream of. Let me remind you of my
24-hour routine, again. Sleep for eight seconds, get up to see
why my beautiful twin baby girls are crying, try every possi-
ble solution twice until they stop crying, go back to sleep for
eight more seconds.
Don’t forget to use your proofreader marks (see Chapter 9) to delete the quo-
tation marks.
Epigraphs
Like extracts, epigraphs are quotations that need to be set off from the main
body of text. But here’s the difference: An epigraph is set apart no matter
what its length because it serves the purpose of setting a theme for a pro-
ceeding chapter or section. The epigraph is usually attributed to someone,
and both the epigraph and its source should be set apart from other para-
graphs by the author. Most epigraphs are chapter epigraphs, so look for ’em
right after the chapter title.
Here’s how you might tag an epigraph in an electronic file:
[CEP]It’s not wise to violate the rules until you know how to observe
them.[/CEP]
[CES]T.S. Eliot[/CES]
Don’t assume the author knows best in this case. Sometimes authors stray
from standard quotation attributes, folding the source line into the running
text even when the quotation’s function is really that of an epigraph. It’s all
right to extract this into a standard chapter epigraph: As T.S. Eliot once said:
“It’s not wise to violate the rules until you know how to observe them.”

Chapter 16: Formatting a Manuscript

Verse extracts
Also known as a poetry extract, the verse extract looks a lot like a block quote
except with different alignment and line breaks in the final design. If you’re
trying to determine whether a piece of text should be a verse extract (rather
than a regular extract), here’s one clue: Keep an eye out for the slash (/) in
running text because sometimes it denotes a poem’s line break. Here’s an
example of how a verse extract may be coded in an electronic file:
I know she reads poems by Maxwell Delacorte to calm her nerves, so I
slipped her a note with a few of her favorite lines tucked in: [PX]“share
your address with me and i shall send you sound remedies, / prescripts
for serenity, potions for city scribes plagued by / commotion, pinned
down in antipodes, pining for butchery / when all that she really needs
are soothing soliloquies, / background amenities to set her swift mind at
ease.”[/PX]
If you delete the quotation marks and insert the [PX] tags as I show here, the
compositor will be sure to set the lines apart from the text, to the effect of
something like this:
I know she reads poems by Maxwell Delacorte to calm her nerves, so I
slipped her a note with a few of her favorite lines tucked in:
share your address with me and i shall send you sound remedies,
prescripts for serenity, potions for city scribes plagued by
commotion, pinned down in antipodes, pining for butchery
when all that she really needs are soothing soliloquies,
background amenities to set her swift mind at ease.
Letter extracts
If at all possible, gently but persistently nudge editors, authors, and the copy-
editing deities into allowing you to set off run-in text letters as extracted
block quotes. You and I want it set off as displayed text, readers want it as
displayed text, the deities — they definitely want it. But authors and the edi-
tors who blindly love them often push to keep short letters and short letter
excerpts nestled into text.
If you can’t get the letter extracted, remember that, as run-in text, the letter’s
first line begins with open quotation marks (usually the salutation), and each
new paragraph begins with open quotation marks. No closing marks appear
until the very last line (usually the signature).

For example, here is a letter as run-in text:
“Dear Vendela:
“I am enthralled with your frantic schedule, and with your ability to perse-
vere through even the most frenetic of social settings. We’ve got to party
together. Or scheme together. Or collaborate over lunch and change the
world by dinner’s aperitif.
“All right, let’s just go see the new Jude Law movie. He’s dreamy.
“Your friend in waiting,
“Samantha”
And here is its more preferable rendition as soon-to-be displayed text — a
most beautiful block quote, sans quotation marks:
[EX]Dear Vendela:
I am enthralled with your frantic schedule, and with your ability to persevere
through even the most frenetic of social settings. We’ve got to party together.
Or scheme together. Or collaborate over lunch and change the world by
dinner’s aperitif.
All right, let’s just go see the new Jude Law movie. He’s dreamy.
Your friend in waiting,
Samantha[/EX]
Extracts even I haven’t thought of yet
Every single book or article you edit will surprise you, and you will be
astounded by the design elements. You may have an extract that includes a
bulleted list. Or an author who wants to use different fonts for different
extracts (Luci writes a note in Geneva font, Jay writes a note in Helvetica
font). Sometimes you just give up and note to the designer that an element
should look “different” or have “special formatting.”
The list of possibilities is probably endless, and I’m endlessly curious about
them! Please send me examples as you discover them; e-mail tags@SueGilad.

Chapter 16: Formatting a Manuscript

I’ve seen — and successfully extracted to safety — e-mails, notes, and vari-
ous facts and figures desperately wishing they were formatted as tables. I’m
eager to hear about your own gallant rescues of other extracts trapped in the
running text!
Highlighting Text in Boxes, Sidebars, 
and Other Cheaters
A book’s design will often include a variety of ways to emphasize text other
than extracts and lists. For example, the design specifications may include
boxed elements, sidebars, pull quotes, margin notes . . . a laundry list of pos-
sibilities. If you’re working on a book that’s part of a series, the house style
guide may include guidelines for when to use each option. If you don’t have
such guidelines, your challenge is to use your editorial judgment to suggest
design elements that best bridge any divide between what the author wants
to communicate and what the reader takes in.
For example, maybe within the running text you identify a tip that has the
potential to change the reader’s life (and you know that the author is trying
to change lives). The design specs may allow you to code a boxed element to
highlight the tip so the reader can’t miss it. The result may be something like
Figure 16-1.
If the tip is long enough, perhaps it would do better as a sidebar, which often
runs along the side of the running text — see Figure 16-2. (In this book, side-
bars are actually boxed elements; they don’t run beside the body of the text.
Just goes to show that every book design is different.)

Part IV: Adding to Your Repertoire

Keep in mind that the amount of leeway you have to identify and code these
types of elements will vary. (Whoever has the final say regarding a book’s
design — the production editor, the acquisitions editor, or the designer —
that person isn’t you.) Sometimes you’ll have detailed guidelines that you’ll
be expected simply to implement; in that case, if you find a gem you think
should be highlighted but that hasn’t been identified in the specs, your job is
to flag it for the production editor and suggest what you think may work.
Other times (the fun, creative times), you’ll be the one to identify all the dif-
ferent parts of a manuscript that may need special treatment (and in this
case, the designer will finalize the specifications after you’ve worked your
magic). The production editor will tell you at the start what is needed for a
project — and if he doesn’t tell you, ask.
Creating Lists
No matter what type of project you’re working on, chances are you’ll run
across a list. It’s up to you to identify when lists may work best as run-in texts
and when they may need to be elevated to display status. (You then flag each
instance for the production editor to review.)
If your publishing house style doesn’t address this topic specifically, your
best bet is to get your math on. Count three, maybe four, items in a run-in
sentence, and then cut that litany off. If the author hits five, there’s a good
chance you’ll serve the reader better by pulling the information from the text
and highlighting it as a list, especially in nonfiction and academic texts.

Chapter 16: Formatting a Manuscript

These lists must then be coded in order to appear on the page as bulleted,
numbered, or unnumbered lists. Occasionally, you may even see a list requir-
ing check boxes or warranting two or three columns side by side. (Multicolumn
lists are double the editorial pleasure because they can also be bulleted,
numbered, or unnumbered.)
Bullets versus numbers
A house style manual (see Chapter 14) may specify when to use bullets and
when to use numbers in lists. And an author may identify lists and present
them as bulleted or numbered in the original manuscript. If you aren’t given
these sorts of guidelines, your job is to identify text that needs to be set as
lists and then suggest to the production editor and designer what type of list
you think each should be. (The final decision rests with them.) My advice is
stick to bullets no matter what the content of the list is and no matter how
many items it contains, unless it falls under one of these exceptions:
 List entries are sequential. In this case, you’ve got to do things in a par-
ticular order (or else your recipe for Chicken Cacciatore is going to taste
a lot like something you don’t want to be tasting).
 List entries have some hierarchical order of importance. If “The Top 10
Steps You Can Take Toward Financial Freedom” starts with the most
important thing and ends with the least important of the ten, numbers
make sense.
 The author subsequently refers back to one of the items in the list.
What if I were to note that a few of my favorite things are: traveling, surfing,
symphonies, chocolate, chick-flicks, and bumper cars? You bet — bullets, my
friend. You could go with an unnumbered list, but bullets seem to be all the
rage, as are their many spin-offs: the checkmark, the x, the box, the arrow, the
diamond.
Let’s go back to that paragraph and code both lists. As an equal-opportunity
copyeditor, I’ll even make the first one unnumbered and the next one bulleted.
What if I were to note that a few of my favorite things are: [UN]traveling, surf-
ing, symphonies, chocolate, chick-flicks, and bumper cars?[/UN] You bet —

be all the rage, as are their many spin-offs: [BL]the checkmark, the x, the box,

Part IV: Adding to Your Repertoire

If your list does warrant numbers, and the number of your list items hits
double or even triple digits, be sure to align the items properly. Hard-copy
heroes will write and circle the instruction “Clear for 10s.” This means that
when the page is typeset, the space allotted from the number to the first
word in the sentence will be based upon the last numeral rather than the first
if a numbered list goes into double digits. (Most lists don’t go into triple
digits, which is why you don’t see “Clear for 100s.”) If you work on electronic
files, you may be expected to align the numbers yourself by using tabs.
For example, this list is incorrectly aligned, according to most house styles:
1. First item
10. Tenth item
100. One hundredth item
I’d like to be the first to welcome you to the correctly aligned list:
1. First item
10. Tenth item
100. One hundredth item
Remember to carefully proofread your lists, too. It gets tricky because the
capitalization and punctuation of list items depend on a few different factors.
If even just one of the list items is a complete sentence, then all the list items
get the complete-sentence treatment: a capital letter kicking it off and a
period ending it. However, if all the list items are single words or fragments,
then each item may begin with a lowercase letter (except for proper nouns,
of course) and end with no mark, or perhaps a comma or semicolon. An
exception is if the manuscript features many lists, and some of the lists fea-
ture complete sentences. Many publishers treat lists consistently throughout
the manuscript.
Lists complications
I’m always amazed how authors come up with new kinds of lists. You may
encounter a bulleted list within a numbered list within a sidebar. You can’t
prepare for every exception. All you can do is be prepared to suggest new list
treatments in such situations.
251
Chapter 16: Formatting a Manuscript

Lists within lists? For the record, do try to avoid them whenever possible.
And then try one more time. If the house style doesn’t address two-tiered
lists, and if you absolutely can’t avoid them, your best option is to number
the outer list and use letters for the interior list.
Hard-Copy Typecoding Sample
Colored pencil? Check. Printed copy of the manuscript? Check. Let the hard-
copy typecoding begin.
As I explain in the earlier section “Placing Codes or Tags,” codes are penciled
in on the left margin of the manuscript or article, and you don’t need to
include end/closing tags. For extracts, you can just box them in by their left-
hand corners. In the sample that follows, I don’t include tags denoting the
body text (the default), but some publishers may require them.
Ready? Here we go.

Some tags rarely show up except in specialized

 [A’’]: A-head in notes section
 [BL2]: Second-level bulleted list with a

I
t all started with a stick and a patch of dirt. Some clever ancestor of ours dis-
covered how to draw a picture that could be viewed by his knuckle-dragging
pals. Then came cave paintings, rock chiseling, and painted pottery. When
papyrus hit the scene, it pretty much blew everything else out of the water.
Well, what paper did to cuneiform on tablets, the computer is doing to paper.
Welcome to the digital age, where it should come as no surprise that a trade
as solidly rooted in tree pulp as publishing may soon become paperless. And
whether you consider yourself one of the technology illuminati or just fortu-
nate enough to have mastered the reheat button on the microwave, elec-
tronic editing may well turn out to be your medium of preference — and
could make you your publisher’s preferred copyeditor or proofreader.
If you have always associated the written word with the feel of paper in your
hands, it may be difficult at first to get used to the fact that, yes, you can read
and comprehend written words made out of pixels. Not to worry. Like anything
new, it just takes a little practice. Making fire was once considered difficult . . .
and look how you mastered the stove top.
Choosing Your Computer Wisely
You don’t need to throw out any red pencils, erasers, and sticky notes you
may have bought in anticipation of your new career. But if you hope to work
from home, whether as a freelancer or as a staff member with telecommuting
privileges, you must also invest in the most important tool of all: a computer.

(If your goal is to work in-house for a publisher, you can probably skip
straight to the section “Keeping Your Body Happy,” because you should have
a lovely perk called an Information Technology department to select, set up,
and maintain your computer for you.)
Laptop versus desktop
If, like me, you love being able to take your work along with you anywhere,
one of your first orders of business will be to invest in a laptop computer.
Having a laptop allows you to plop down at any java shack or park bench and
exercise the right to be a freelancer or telecommuter. With computer compo-
nents getting smaller and smaller, the weight of a laptop is getting down to
that of a hardcover book. So, if your dream is to get paid to read while sitting
in your Barcalounger, today’s technology can make your dream a reality.
Using a laptop tends to be harder on your body than using a desktop com-
puter. The reason? When you attain the optimum keyboard placement for
your arms and hands, the laptop’s screen will be too low. When you position
the screen to the proper height, the keyboard will be too high for your hands
to be properly positioned. In this chapter, I give lots of advice for making
your workspace ergonomically appealing. With a laptop, you may have to just
do the best you can.
If you’re a masochist or homebody (or perhaps just require a bit of extra dis-
cipline), you may want to work at a desk, which means you probably want a
desktop computer. If that’s your choice, you should definitely invest in acces-
sories that make your workspace friendly to your body. Treat your weary
hands to some support in the form of ergonomic wrist rests, and splurge on a
firm but cushiony back support and foot rest. (Think of all the money you’ll
save on chiropractic visits.) Then spend the time to set up your office space
in a way that’s least stressful on your various parts. I talk much more about
how to make yourself comfortable in the upcoming section “Keeping Your
Body Happy.”
We all scream for wide screen
Slurp that carrot juice, because you’re going to need those orbs in your skull
to be in tip-top condition for all the reading you’ll be getting paid to do.
If you don’t want your eyes to take a beating, keep in mind that not all com-
puter monitors are created equal. Most computer manufacturers offer a fairly
wide selection of monitors, and you want to have a good one. Not to worry if
you don’t know a pixel from Pixy Stix. In general, all you need to know about
pixels is that you want a whole lot of them! The more of them, the better the
picture.
256
Part IV: Adding to Your Repertoire

If you’ll be doing most of your work at a desk and you have loads of space,
you would do well to invest in a larger monitor. It doesn’t have to be sports-
bar big, but I suggest 17 to 21 inches if your desk can hold it. If space is
tight, consider getting a flat-screen monitor; it costs more but takes up lots
less room.
If you really want to flex your tech-savvy muscles, get one of those wide-
screen monitors that can display two pages side by side. That feature really
comes in handy when comparing two versions of a document or when you
want to keep your document on screen while going online to check a Web site.
A friend of mine from the photography industry let me in on a trick he uses. A
lot of monitors have a color adjustment control, and if you turn down the
blues a bit, your eyes won’t get tired as quickly.
Keeping Your Body Happy
Lots of professions are associated with injuries. You don’t have to be a kick-
boxer to get aches and pains from the work you do. The more scientists
study injuries in the workplace, the more we learn about the harmful effects
of repetitive motions. Computer use is a relative newcomer in the field, affect-
ing the wrists, back, shoulders, and precious, precious eyes. For a crash
course in minimizing stress on your body, plant your feet on the floor and
read on.
Sit up straight, dear
You want to maintain neutral posture when sitting at your computer, with
your back against the chair, your thighs and forearms parallel to the floor,
and your wrists at a neutral angle. If you have one of those fancy desk chairs
with all the adjustments, adjust it:
 Push your hips as far back into the chair as possible.
 Adjust the seat height so your feet are flat on the floor and your knees
are equal to or slightly lower than your hips. (If the keyboard or mouse
height is fixed, the proper chair height may leave your feet not touching
the floor. In this case, you need a footrest.)
 Adjust the back of the chair to a 100° to 110° reclined angle.
 If the chair can be adjusted for back height, adjust it to follow the con-
tour of your back.
 If the chair’s seat pan can be adjusted, adjust to allow for a two- to four-
inch gap between the back of your calf and the front edge of the seat.
257
Chapter 17: Editing and Proofreading Electronically

 Adjust the armrests vertically and laterally so they do not impede typing
and mouse use. Forearms and elbows should not continuously rest on
the armrests.
 Use a footrest if your feet cannot be firmly planted on the ground.
Get your hands up
Now that your chair is adjusted, turn your focus to your keyboard:
 Center your keyboard in line with the monitor.
 Position your keyboard directly in front of your body and close to you.
 Adjust the keyboard height so you can type with your shoulders relaxed,
elbows close to your body, forearms parallel to the floor, and wrists
fairly straight. (Your upper and lower arms should form 90-degree
angles.) Your keyboard height should be level with your elbows when
your upper arms are resting against your body.
 Make sure your keyboard is flat or has a slight negative tilt (meaning the
front, or spacebar, edge is higher than the back). Do not work with a 
positive tilt (where the back of the keyboard is higher than the front). You
want to maintain a neutral straight position in your wrists, and a posi-
tively tilted keyboard forces you to work with your hands bent backward.
Consider getting a height-and-tilt-adjustable keyboard tray, which can
provide optimal positioning of the keyboard.
 Pad hard surfaces, and use a wrist rest to help maintain neutral posture.
 When not using your keyboard, avoid maintaining static hand and wrist
positions by moving your hands away.
Give your wrist some help
If you can help it, try using your arm and shoulder muscles a little more when
maneuvering your mouse, instead of solely relying on your dainty wrist. Here
are some suggestions:
 Place your mouse (or other pointing device) at the same elevation and
as close as possible to your keyboard. Your posture for mouse use
should be similar to your typing posture (meaning a neutral position).
 Position your mouse to avoid severely bending your wrist or turning it
inward or outward.
 When you’re not using your mouse, avoid maintaining static hand and
wrist positions by moving your hand away.
258
Part IV: Adding to Your Repertoire

Look alive
These tips can help your eyes and upper body feel better during an editing or
proofreading session:
 Place your monitor directly in front of you, not angled to the left or right.
 Center your monitor so your body and neck aren’t twisted when viewing
the screen.
 Place your monitor at a horizontal distance where you can read the text
clearly, usually 18 to 28 inches away from your eyes (approximately an
arm’s length). If you squint or bend forward to read text on the monitor,
that means the monitor is too far away.
 Adjust the monitor height so your eyes are aligned with the top quarter of
the monitor viewing area. If you wear bifocals or progressive lenses, lower
and tilt back the monitor so you can view it without tilting your head back.
 Use a document holder to position printed materials in your line of
vision, close to and at the same height and angle as the monitor.
Break it up
Probably the worst thing you can do for your body is work for hours on end
without taking a break. Once every hour, take a three- to five-minute break.
Get up off your tush, and shuffle around your area. (Maybe mush a few maca-
roons in your mouth, rifle through your inbox, or call your friends to gloat
about your glorious job.)
Also give your parts these mini-breaks to help you get through your work
unscathed:
 Avert those eyes: Every 15 minutes or so, pull your peepers away from
the computer screen to take in the scenery around you. Rapidly blink
your eyes — kinda like a crazy person — to moisten and clear your eye
surface, and try to focus on objects farther away from you before jump-
ing back into your read.
 Make like a gorilla: When not using your mouse or keyboard, let your
arms hang at your sides. Change positions frequently, and feel welcome
to do your best King Kong “Oooh! Oooh! Oooh!” if you think it will help.
 Set the mood, baby: Lower your blinds or draw those drapes, dim all
the lights, and slide that Barry White from its sleeve, because this is
gonna be one . . . um, glare-minimizing night for you and your baby blues
(or gleaming greens, in my case). Glare is just not good enough for you,
honey — you and soft lighting were made for each other. The exception?
When you need to reference hard-copy materials. You may want a desk
lamp on hand so you can light things up when hard copy comes into play.
259
Chapter 17: Editing and Proofreading Electronically

Consider a pro’s advice
If you want to make sure you’re not doing anything to injure yourself, con-
sider talking to the pros. If you work at your computer two or more hours per
day, repeat the same movements over and over, or hold the same posture for
prolonged periods of time — in other words, if you’re an editor or proofreader
working electronically! — you can benefit from an ergonomic evaluation.
Ergonomic evaluations help you identify problems with your workstation
layout, whether it’s at your desk, in your bed, or on your ironing board.
Whatever setup you’ve got, it could contribute to physical discomfort or the
risk of repetitive stress injury. Search the Web for an expert near you.
Reading the Electronic Page
Yes, it feels different reading text on a screen rather than on a page you physi-
cally hold in your hands. Maybe you can’t read as quickly either. Or your
eyes get tired more quickly than usual.
If you aren’t reading online newspapers and blogs each day, proofreading or
copyediting an electronic page is likely to take some getting used to. But
here’s the good news: that bad habit of reading with your fingers you
acquired in grade school? Well, you’ll finally be forced to break it. You won’t
be able to put your finger on the page and follow the text line for line — at
least not without leaving croissant-grease streaks on your monitor!
Retraining your eye
Not in the habit of reading online? Where have you been living?! Alas, you’ve
nothing to worry your old-school noggin about: You can retrain yourself to
read electronic copy just as easily and quickly as if you were reading it from
copy in your paws. I suggest starting a daily regimen of reading a few news
articles online. Start with reps of two or more articles a day, and gradually
work yourself up to four sets. In no time, you’ll feel a lot more comfortable
and your eyes will have adjusted to the new medium. Feel the burn.
Appeasing your paper partiality
If, like me, you have a strong belief that your reading comprehension is some-
how tied to the feel of paper in hand, listen up: There’s no law against print-
ing the pages. No, you will not be doing your share to save the environment,
but I doubt that Greenpeace will camp out on your front lawn as a result.

Know thy software
If you’re just now making your entrée into the
world of computers and word processing, wel-
come! If you’ve lived in this world before but are
now returning after a hiatus, welcome back!
Whether you need a crash course on the gamut
of computerdom or a light brush-up on the latest
advances in Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat,
you can feel like an expert in no time by flipping
through any number of For Dummies books on
computing and software.
Shameless plug? Actually, it’s a prideful plug.
Each For Dummies book is designed to show
you the ins and outs of a particular subject with
the consideration of a warm and trusted friend.
Don’t know a wingding from a ring-a-ding-ding?
Check out one of the For Dummies books on
Microsoft Office. Need something that steps
back a bit more? Try one of the all-in-one desk
references for PCs or Macs.
Before you rush out and pick up whatever
black-and-yellow-bound book your hands land
on, do some easy research first. Take a minute
to reintroduce yourself to the computer you’ll be
using most often for editing. Write down
whether your computer is a PC or a Mac, and
find out both the name and version of the cur-
rently running operating system. Go deeper, and
record the version of Microsoft Office currently
installed. All this is important in making sure that
you get the right book for your needs.
Clueless as to how to get to the guts of your
computer? If you know whether you use a PC or
Mac, this piece of knowledge leads right into
your operating system. If you use a desktop or
laptop PC, you use some version of Windows.
An older PC should be running Windows 98 or
higher, while a newer PC will have been pre-
loaded with Windows XP or Vista. To find out
what you’re running on, right-click My
Computer, select Properties, and click the
General tab. To see which version of Microsoft
Word you have installed, click Help on the Word
toolbar and select About Microsoft Word in the
resulting drop-down menu.
If you are a Mac user, you are likely using OS 9
or OS X. To get the goods, go to Finder and click
the Apple icon in the left top corner; when
prompted, click About This Computer or About
This Macintosh — whichever one you see —
and a window will open containing what you
want. Not able to find the Apple icon in Finder?
Then you’re using OS X. To discern which ver-
sion of Microsoft Word you’re using, click Word
on the Microsoft Word toolbar and select About
Word in the resulting drop-down menu.
With all you’re capable of, it would be silly to
pigeonhole yourself by purchasing a Microsoft
Word–only guide. I suggest picking up either
Office 2007 All-in-One Desk Reference For
Dummies by Peter Weverka or PCs All-in-One
Desk Reference For Dummies by Mark L.
Chambers (Wiley). Each gives you the goods not
only on Word, but also on Excel, PowerPoint,
Outlook, Access, FrontPage, and more.
If you’re still in your pajamas, don’t get dressed
yet; there’s plenty of stuff you can find online
until you get to your neighborhood bookstore.
The Microsoft Office Assistance site at
http://office.microsoft.com/ is
full of information on all the programs in the
suite. And the best part is it’s searchable! You
can also browse through articles and hints like
“10 tips to save time in Excel” and “Formatting
made simple,” and you can get answers from
other Office users.

Part IV: Adding to Your Repertoire
I must whisper a word of caution here: You won’t make the most efficient use
of your time if you edit on paper first because you still have to copy your
edits to the electronic version. The extra step may add more chance for error
to the process, too. Accuracy and timeliness definitely count, so your best
bet in the long run is to train your eyes to read from the computer.
Hey, I did it — and I haven’t purchased a new toner cartridge all month!
Touring the technology benefits
So, what’s in it for you? Why should you get on board with this paperless
trend in editing?
While you may be resistant at first, after you take the plunge, you’ll see
clearly how this medium can make your life as a proofreader or copyeditor
much easier. I go into more detail later in the chapter, but bottom line is that
your computer software has some great tools that save you a lot of time and
help you catch errors.
Plus, like your family photo albums, publishing has gone digital. That means
the entire production workflow has changed. It is becoming the norm for pub-
lishers to work with electronic copy from the beginning of the production
process to the end (see Chapter 2), and you want to be sure that process
doesn’t pass you by.
Mastering the Electronic Process
It may seem ironic that a publisher of printed materials would go to the trou-
ble of refashioning the traditional, paper-pushed production process into an
electronic one. This change has little to do with a future-forward mindset or a
granola-crunching concern about saving trees. Instead, the motivation is —
shocker — money. Publishing companies have adopted electronic technologies
to streamline and enhance their production processes, thereby saving steps
and printing costs and increasing the all-important bottom line. Singing the
copy electric also leaves more time for the editors to go to lunch, shop, and
debate wide misuse of the apostrophe . . . or (more likely) to work on more
projects.
Most of the skills I advocate elsewhere in this book apply to the electronic-
editing process, but marking up the copy will feel a little different. If you’re
proofreading electronically, for example, all those squiggly proofreading
marks I present in Chapter 9 won’t be needed where you’re going.

Saving your files (and your tuchis)
Before we go anywhere, repeat after me: I will always save a copy of the origi-
nal, unblemished document before I begin pawing at it. Thereafter, I will
always save versions so others may see the stages of editing, if they so
desire. How do you do this? Before you begin editing or proofreading, save
the original document with a new title, selecting Save As and writing over or
modifying the existing name. For example, if the original document is titled
Ch17.doc, save the new document to be edited as Ch17_SueGilad.doc. Wait,
that’s my name — use your name instead.
To save subsequent versions or editing phases, simply save the document as
a new document, adding additional information — a version number or a
date in shorthand — to the end of the document name:
Ch17_YourName.v2.doc, for instance, or Ch17_YourName.Oct1507.doc.
Be sure to check with the publisher about naming conventions that you
should follow. Some companies have very specific file-naming guidelines they
want you to use.
Seeing your document clearly
Before you begin editing or proofreading, make sure you can see the text on
your screen clearly. If the words are too tiny for you to take in, enhance their
appearance by increasing the overall view of your document through the
Zoom function. (Often this is a drop-down menu containing various view 
percents and is located on your general shortcut toolbar.) Using Zoom does
not change the actual font size of the document; instead, it acts like a pretty
precise magnifying glass atop the document itself. If you can’t see a docu-
ment clearly when it appears at 100 percent, for example, try changing the
view to 120 percent or higher.
You can also manipulate your monitor’s brightness and contrast features,
making a huge difference in the appearance of the text.
It’s tres important that you do not fudge around with the actual font size of a
document to get a clearer view of the words. Instead, stick with the Zoom
tool or play around with your monitor’s features to get what you want with-
out compromising the integrity of the document itself.
263
Chapter 17: Editing and Proofreading Electronically

Tracking your changes in Word
Your publisher contact will most likely ask that you use a neat little editing
feature called Track Changes, available in Microsoft Word. The designers of
Microsoft Word assumed that not everybody wishes to keep tabs on each
little change within a document, so you need to turn this feature on before
you begin editing.
There are different ways to access the Track Changes feature depending on
the age of the software and which platform you’re using (Mac or PC). The
simplest way to find out where your Track Changes function is located and
how to enable it is to do a search for it in the Help menu. When the function
is working, you’ll see TRK on the bar at the bottom of your document. Ta-dah!
When it’s enabled, the Track Changes feature records every edit you make to
the text, formatting, and spacing of the document. The feature also keeps
track of the fact that you are the one making the edits. That way, if a docu-
ment is passed through several people before returning to the author or
editor, that person can scroll through and see who made what changes.
Before beginning any project, you want to review the default preferences for
the Track Changes feature. Though you can change the look and color of revi-
sion marks to whatever you’d like, most editors require that you track your
changes in red. Lucky you, this is exactly the color that Microsoft Word
defaults to for edits.
If you find the edit marks distracting while you read, you can opt for a more
normal view of the document while still tracking all your edits. Again, the
Help menu is your best resource for determining how to hide the edit marks
in your particular software.
As with any software feature, the more you wade around in all that Track
Changes has to offer, the more you’ll be able to tailor its features to meet
your needs. Put in some practice with the program: Create a dummy docu-
ment and start making some changes; see how the software handles your
additions and deletions of letters, words, and spacing.
Viewing formatting
Another tool you may want to turn on is Show Formatting. Depending on the
version of your Microsoft Word, you may find a shortcut button for this fea-
ture on your toolbar; it looks like a paragraph symbol (that’s a backward P),
and clicking it once turns the tool on.
264
Part IV: Adding to Your Repertoire

This trusty tool allows you to view paragraph symbols, spacing dots, line
breaks, and the like. How does this help you? These symbols act as a cheat
sheet in spotting common formatting errors, like two (or more) spaces after
a period. (Quick note: The use of two spaces after a period is generally
regarded as a holdover from the days of typewriters. Use one space. Another
quick note: The Replace function can be your best friend when you find that a
document has formatting errors. See the upcoming section “The Find, Replace,
and Search functions.”)
The first pass: Correcting errors
Correcting errors in an electronic document is as easy as doing what you
always do with Microsoft Word. Want to delete a word? Position your cursor
and backspace over it. Need to add a letter? Position your cursor and get
typing. Need to delete a large amount of text? Use your mouse to highlight
the chunk of words you want to banish and delete, delete, delete. Seriously, if
you’ve ever worked with word-processing software, you’ve already got most
of the skills to do this job.
So, ready to begin? You’ll take several passes at the material, but at first, you
want to take stock of the feel of the work. Think about the author’s writing
style and the publisher’s format while you try to get a feel for the whole she-
bang. While you work on getting into the groove, cross-check the text against
the publisher’s instructions and the style sheet, if one was given to you.
During the first pass, make only essential edits, such as correcting grammar,
spelling, and punctuation errors. If you find that you need to undo an edit
you performed, simply go to the Edit dropdown list on your toolbar and click
Undo (or Undo Typing). Voilà!
The second pass: Digging deeper 
and adding comments
On your second editing pass, peck through the surface of spelling and gram-
mar and wade a bit deeper into the mechanics of the language and the unifor-
mity of the document’s format. Keep in mind the author’s voice, the work’s
audience, and the publisher’s house style, just as you would during a hard-
copy edit. Mark corrections when you feel certain that you’ve identified
something inconsistent or inaccurate, and insert comments — the electronic
version of queries — for the author or editor whenever you spy something a
bit more complex that may need attention.
265
Chapter 17: Editing and Proofreading Electronically

How exactly do you insert comments into an electronic document? First, a bit
of visualization: On hard copy, you’d write a query on a sticky note, right?
The same concept applies here: You place a virtual sticky note smack up
against the word or phrase you have questions about.
When you bump up against a query-worthy spot, click the New Comment
icon on your Reviewing toolbar. The highly intuitive robots that run Track
Changes will add a balloon in which to place your comment. Type your query
into the comment balloon, and you’re done! And keep in mind that you’re not
limited to short comments; the balloon can stretch to be as large as you need
if you’ve got lots of questions or concerns. (See the nearby sidebar “Keeping
your comments clean” for ideas about how to comment on changes you’re
making or suggesting.)
As a bonus, your computer keeps track of who added the comment to the
document. How is this a bonus? After a manuscript has been reviewed by a
handful of editors, a proofreader, and maybe the author herself, a quick scroll
through the document reveals who made what comments. Very useful,
indeed. (To make sure your name or initials identify your edits or comments,
use the Help tab to search for the User Information function.)
266
Part IV: Adding to Your Repertoire
Keeping your comments clean
There’s nothing wrong with making changes to
an electronic document; that’s what copyedi-
tors and proofreaders are paid to do. But some-
times it’s best to explain what you’re doing. That
way, when your author reads an edit of yours
and grunts, “Why did she change the type of
alcohol?” he’ll see your note that says, “Since
the protagonist is making a martini, consider
having him pick up a bottle of gin or vodka,
rather than scotch.”
Keep in mind that a comment is not an open cri-
tique of the author’s work. You should use the
Comment function to politely query the use of a
word or make a recommendation that will result
in clearer format or meaning.
Sometimes you’ll read a phrase and not have a
clue what the author meant to impart; even the
best authors can occasionally lapse into incom-
prehension. (If you don’t believe me, read
Faulkner’s The Sound and the Fury.) No matter
how bad the text may be, resist the urge to jok-
ingly suggest medication. Your comments
should always be legitimate and professional.
Whether the comment is meant to advise of
erroneous word usage, query a double mean-
ing, or recommend a change, the best approach
is to say it with a high level of respect and tact.
Keep in mind that the Comment feature isn’t lim-
ited to author queries, so you should always
begin a comment by identifying who you want
to read it. Comments can also be addressed to
the assigning editor or to the typesetter (com-
positor). Begin each comment with Au:, Ed:, or
Comp: to avoid confusion.

Thinking globally: Functions you 
can’t live without
Gather around the fire, because we’ve come to the most oh-so-fabulous fea-
ture of electronic editing: the glorious global. The list of reasons I love global
functions is long and begins with these awesome features: global Find, global
Replace, global Search, and global spell-checker.
You’re going to like this aspect of electronic editing so much that I bet you’ll
shell out money for an I LOVE GLOBAL T-shirt. If there’s any reason you should
prefer to work with pixels over paper, it’s this one.
The Find, Replace, and Search functions
Consider this example: You’re editing a fiction story, and you’re nearing the
middle of the manuscript. The author describes your heroine punching out
on the clock at her hospital job. Now, you’re sure that earlier she was
described as a cab driver, not a hospital employee. Which is it? Global Find to
the rescue!
If you’re working with a large electronic document, you can forget about 
sifting through pages in a panic for confirmation. Simply click the Edit drop-
down menu on your Microsoft Word standard toolbar, and select Find. In the
resulting pop-up box, type the word or phrase you wish to find in the Find
What field. For the above example, you could type cab to see if your memory
was correct. If that word doesn’t produce any results, don’t stop there: Type
in such similar words as taxi or drive to see what comes up. A-ha! She is
described as a cab driver, but now what? Flag the first instance for a query,
then click the Find Next button in your pop-up box to see every instance
where that word is used.
Now, let’s say you’ve noticed a few instances of teh — the mistyped, back-
ward cousin of the — peppered here and there throughout the document.
Under the same Edit drop-down menu in which Find can be found, there’s a
selection called Replace. Clicking Replace pulls up a similar box as Find but
with an additional field: Replace With. Here, you’d type teh in the Find What field
and the in the Replace With field, and then you’d click the Replace button.
Voila! Instant correction. If you don’t want to go through the hassle of replac-
ing the typos one by one, you can click the Replace All button, and in every
single place the bastard cousin appears, its correct relative will replace it.
(If only family members were so easy to replace.)
267
Chapter 17: Editing and Proofreading Electronically

The beauty of global Find or global Replace is that you can search to your
brain’s content. Want to check that the author used semicolons correctly
throughout the work or make sure she was not too overzealous with exclama-
tion points? Use the Find tool, and search for semicolons or exclamation
points. Need to change those errant Morons into Morans? Use Replace to
change each instance with one click. Are you starting to appreciate how awe-
some these functions are?
If that’s not great enough, you can use the global Search function to locate
words or phrases that appear in multiple documents. Let’s say that you need
to change Morons to Morans in 27 individual chapter files. Instead of going
through each file individually to find Morons, you can search an entire folder
for that word. How? Right-click on the folder, and select Search. Type in the
word or phrase you’re looking for, and hit the Search button. You’ll get a list
of the files in which the word or phrase appears.
The glamorous, glorious global not only covers your ifs and ands; it can also
cover the tender skin of your butt. I’ve used it to do this very thing many,
many times. For example, after proofreading one manuscript, yours truly was
advised by her editor that there were a number of instances of double spaces
after periods — a no-no in the publishing world. Fortunately, I was given a
chance to correct this oversight on the second proof, where I relied on global
replace to assist me in the search for double spaces. I simply typed two char-
acter spaces into the Find What field and typed one space into the Replace
With field; clicking Replace All solved everything, and clicking it yet again
confirmed that there were no more double spaces to be replaced. Perfecto!
Sit and check for a spell
You can also go global with spell-checker. Why not let the computer do some
of the work while you save your eyes for more important things? As with
many software tools, there is a limit to this function’s usefulness, and you
certainly can’t sit back and let it do everything. But global spell-checker is
great for catching ridiculous typos. This function — Spelling and Grammar —
lives under Tools on your Microsoft Word general toolbar.
Beyond the everyday spotting of misspelled words, spell-checker is incompa-
rable when it comes to finding subtle differences in the spelling of character
names, places, and other proper nouns not in the dictionary. The Ignore All
option is your pal here. For example, say you run the spell-checker and the
correctly spelled Katharine appears. Click Ignore All, which instructs the
spell-checker to remember that spelling so it will not appear as an error
again, at least not in this particular spell-checker run. That way, if the spell-
checker stops on a word that looks like Katharine, you know it must contain
an error. (Perhaps you’ve got Katherine instead.)
268
Part IV: Adding to Your Repertoire

It goes without saying, but let me say it anyway: Spell-checker is not a substi-
tute for actual proofreading. The lists of homonyms that slip through the net
are endless; then there’s the occasional word that, although spelled correctly,
doesn’t quite fit the context. If you think Thank you for mating with me is bad,
think about how red your face would be if you didn’t catch that missing l in
public.
Formatting documents
If you’re asked to format an electronic document, start with the most obvious
part: the margins. Your editor or publishing house should provide page-layout
parameters, which you can set using the Page Setup function under File.

If you need to insert tags (the electronic version of codes) to identify design
elements in a document, be sure to read Chapter 16 where I cover the subject
in detail. You may be asked to work in a document template instead, which
means that instead of coding you’ll be formatting each text element using a
set of established type styles. (Templates may come into play if you work on
branded titles, for example; see Chapter 2 for an explanation of branding.)
Your other formatting responsibilities may include reviewing indents, line
breaks, and spacing for uniformity.
When engaged, the Track Changes feature records any changes you make to
the format of a document, just as it does for your changes to the text.
Adding page numbers, running 
heads, feet, and footnotes
Microsoft Word makes these functions fairly simple; if you can locate them,
you can easily use them to achieve whatever the publisher requests. If you
have any trouble locating them based on what I’ve written here (because
functions can vary from one version of software to the next), visit your Help
menu and search for the function in question. Here are the basics:
 Page numbers: Click on the Insert drop-down menu on your Microsoft
Word general toolbar and search for Page Numbers. Select their position
and alignment based on the publisher’s specifications. Easy!
 Running heads and/or feet: If the publisher wants you to add running
heads and/or feet to the document (see Chapter 13 if you don’t know
what these terms mean), go to the View drop-down menu and select
Header and Footer. You can insert a chapter name, book title . . . whatever
the publisher requests.
 Footnotes: If the work you’re plugging through contains footnotes (see
Chapter 5 for a full discussion), go to the Insert drop-down menu and
look for the Footnote function (which may be tucked under Reference).
Proofreading and copyediting PDFs
So far in this chapter, I’ve focused on editing and proofreading in Word.
However, there’s a whole other world out there in terms of electronic work-
flow, and it revolves around the PDF.
270
Part IV: Adding to Your Repertoire

PDF stands for Portable Document File and refers to a file that has been con-
verted from any other document type (such as Word) and can be reviewed
using any of the Adobe software programs. PDFs are often used for docu-
ments that contain graphics and complex layouts because they preserve the
look of the document better than Word files can. That means that if you work
on magazines, newsletters, corporate communications, and other graphics-
heavy publications, you are likely to be proofreading PDFs after the text has
been through copyediting and has been set in the layout. And even though
the editing functions in PDFs are pretty limited, copyeditors are increasingly
finding themselves having to deal with PDFs too.
You’re probably aware that the Adobe Reader program is available online and
can be downloaded for free. Unless you work primarily on PDFs, you can get
away with not plunking down the money for Adobe Acrobat Professional or
Adobe InDesign (each of which allows much more complex markup and
manipulation of graphics). A production editor who creates a PDF in one of
these programs can, as an administrator, set the document to allow markup.
Then you can use the basic functions to add or delete text and add comments.
As I write this, Adobe has just released version 8 of its Reader software, but
versions 6 and 7 are still being widely used. The location of the tools has
changed in the new version, so I recommend that you use the Help drop-
down menu to locate the tools I mention here. Also, only versions 7 and
higher of Reader will allow markup.
There is a multitude of ways to mark corrections on a PDF if you have a full
version of Acrobat or InDesign, and you’ll want to ask your hiring editor what
tools he prefers that you use. But if all you have is Reader, these are the three
main ones you will use:
 The Text Edits tool: The icon for this tool is a capital letter T with a red
line through it and an insertion mark (caret) next to it. Use it to add or
delete text. Click on the icon, then click your cursor into the text and
start typing. A note window will appear that shows your edits.
 The Highlighter tool: Just like it sounds, this tool is an electronic high-
lighter that you can use to highlight a word or phrase. The icon has a
stylized letter T with a yellow highlighter drawing a line through it. Click
on it, then click your cursor into the text and drag it across whatever
you want to highlight.
 The Note tool: Use this to put a note anywhere in the document. The
icon is a yellow comment bubble; click on it, then click into the spot in
the document where you want to insert the note. A note window will
appear; just type your note in there. You can drag and drop the note any-
where in the document after you have created it. After you write a note
or query, you can reduce the notepad by clicking on the “X” in the
corner. (And if you see a little yellow balloon on a page of the document
that’s sent to you, double-click on it to expand the notebook so you can
see what’s been written.)
271
Chapter 17: Editing and Proofreading Electronically

Electronic Pros(e) and Cons
The pros of electronic editing abound. Now that laptops are no longer the
stuff of dreams, copyeditors and proofreaders don’t have to be chained to
desks or desktop computers. Hooray for the freedom of mobility! Plus, the
ease and expediency of electronic editing, thanks to tools like Track Changes
and global Find and Replace functions, frees up precious time, making an
editor all the more productive.
Another beauty of this electrobusiness is that you can immediately view the
results of your labors. By changing the view of your document to hide the edits
you’ve tracked, you can see the results of your work. Don’t be ashamed — your
oohs and aahs are absolutely appropriate.
So, are there any cons to consider? Problems with electronic editing com-
monly have less to do with the beefiness of its features and more to do with
the way in which a user wields them. Yes, you read that correctly: Some of
those software “glitches” you may complain about can be traced back to the,
ahem, user. But how do you avoid them if you’re not a software expert? Stay
alert, and keep control. Don’t let the robot do all the thinking for you, and
keep a cool head about the grammar or spelling suggestions the robot tries
to feed you. If Mr. Silicon Face tells you something’s right, but your gut growls
that it’s wrong, it’s probably wrong.
So keep your head in the game, but embrace the technology. It wasn’t long
ago that writers were using manual typewriters to create manuscripts. When
editors made changes, the whole thing had to be retyped. Fun job that must
have been. And when it came time to bind the book, they did it with saber-
toothed cat teeth and a club. Believe me, we’ve got it easy. So embrace the
work that your microprocessor is able to do for you. Soon you won’t be doing
much of anything except asking your toaster to order new batteries for your
slippers and telling your lawnmower what kind of beer you want it to bring
you. So wrap your arms around your computer and kiss it until the cooling
fan kicks on. And keep telling yourself that you’re the pilot, and the computer
is the copilot. Open the pod bay doors, Hal.

 Identifying and contacting potential employers
 Keeping yourself organized
N
ot that the rest of the book isn’t fun, but this chapter deals with the
most fun topic of all: getting a job. And not just any job — a job that ful-
fills as much of your publishing dream as possible while also filling your
wallet.
I can’t pretend to know what your dream is: Maybe it involves wearing a suit
every day and working a steady Monday through Friday schedule, or maybe
it involves wearing pajamas until 3 p.m. and doing the bulk of your work in
the wee hours of the morning. (If the latter scenario sounds most appealing,
be sure to check out the next two chapters, in which I detail how to establish
yourself as a freelancer and build a thriving freelance career.) Maybe the
work on your dream desk is a science fiction manuscript being published by
one of the major houses, or maybe it’s an electronic article on a recent med-
ical breakthrough to be posted on a Web site with a full-time staff of one.
The great thing about copyediting and proofreading is that after you develop
the skills and understand common work practices, you can apply what you
know to any situation in which you’re asked to improve copy. You may need
to invest some time doing not-so-dreamy jobs in order to build a résumé that
gets you noticed by your ideal employer, but don’t fret: As I state in Chapter 1,
patience and persistence are essential qualities in a copyeditor or proof-
reader. They carry you through when you’re poring over a tough assignment,
and they will carry you through when you’re developing your skills and
résumé.
So let’s talk about how to move from dream to reality — and paychecks.

Getting Some Practice
You knew I was going to say this, right? Before you start shopping for paying
work, you should invest some time putting your new-found knowledge about
copyediting or proofreading to the test — possibly for free. If you’ve already
been doing this (if you’re the person all your friends turn to whenever there’s
a résumé, thesis, or letter to the editor that needs finessing), don’t stop now.
The next time someone asks you to “just take a quick look” at whatever piece
of writing needs help, feel free to use the proofreading symbols I present in
Chapter 9 to communicate corrections, and write a query or two just to see
how it feels. You may be giving the writer more than he expected, but that’s
okay: You both get what you need.
If you haven’t yet had opportunities to put your skills into action, start now.
Reading about how to copyedit and proofread is great, but you also have to
do the work to fully understand what’s involved — and to convince potential
employers that you understand it. Following are a few ways you can get some
practice:
 It’s a family affair: Ask your loved ones about any projects they need
your help with. Network with friends and ask if you can proofread their
brochures, correspondence, or menus. Ask college students you know if
they need someone to look over their theses or dissertations. And if you
know somebody in publishing, by all means let her know that you’re
interested in moving along with a copyediting or proofreading career.
 Think global, start local: Get involved in your community. Is there a
hometown newsletter whose writing makes you cringe? Offer to help the
staff out for free. Involved in a community center? See if it needs its Web
site copyedited. What about your local library? The staff may appreciate
your offer to take a look at their brochures and press releases.
Here are some other organizations that you may want to approach with
an offer to edit or proofread their publications:
• Churches
• Historical societies
• Museums
• Neighborhood groups
• Police and fire associations
• Recreation centers
• Sporting leagues
• Theaters
276
Part V: Turning Your Skills into Paychecks 

Make a phone call or stop by in person to see what you can drum up. Let
the staff know that you know how important their publications really are.
Everywhere you patronize, anywhere you eat — these are also places to
get the experience you need, while lending a hand to people you like.
And who knows, maybe you’ll get a free coffee out of it next time you
drop by.
 Dear Publisher, I genuflect at your feet: Even if your goal is copyedit-
ing, get your hands on as many proofreading tests as you can. How do
you do this? Inquire directly to your favorite publishers about freelance
proofreading opportunities. Most likely, they will send you a letter thank-
ing you for your interest and enclose a proofreading test for you to com-
plete and return. If freelancing is actually your goal, complete and return
each test, but also make copies that you can reference for study later.
And don’t forget to ask for feedback on how you did — you’re bound to
learn something new.
 Billions of friendly strangers: Most Internet communications occur
through writing, which has two great benefits: All that writing translates
into lots of copyediting and proofreading opportunities, and you may
feel more comfortable approaching unfamiliar people online (in writing)
to ask about getting some practice.
There is an endless number of writers’ Web sites, Web rings, and online
writing classes supporting (mostly unpublished) authors. Go to your
favorite search engine (that begins with “Go” and ends with “ogle”) and
type in “writer” plus other keywords like “Web site” or “Web ring.” Sift
through your search results for sites that let you post to bulletin boards.
Then post a simple message such as this:
I am a copyeditor/proofreader in the process of expanding my résumé. I
would like to add (fiction/nonfiction/whatever you’re interested in) to my
experience. I will proofread a chapter of anything you are writing at no
charge. Materials should be no shorter than ten pages and not longer than
30. I will return pages to you with corrections in Microsoft Word, tracking
changes. In exchange, I ask that you allow me to add your name and the
title of your work to my résumé. I will not plagiarize your work or share it
with anyone else.
When you get the word out that you’re giving your skills and time away
for free, you will be astounded at the responses you receive. Struggling
writers need people to review their work. And having a stranger look it
over is much less threatening to them (and their poor, battered egos)
than having a friend or professional colleague review it. Much of what
you work on may be awful, but tough it out — the experience will be
priceless.
277
Chapter 18: Hunting for Work

When trolling the Web for writers who need your help, the big fish to
land is the published author. If you get bites from one of those, offer to
copyedit or proofread any forthcoming projects. Then act bored.
In addition to taking these steps to gain experience, you may also want to seek
out free or low-cost courses and other training opportunities offered through
community centers or career-building networks. If you live in a bigger city,
take a look at the courses and seminars section of www.mediabistro.com
(see the sidebar in this chapter titled “Get to the bistro”), or do an Internet
search on free editing or proofreading courses in your city.
Generating Documents That 
Get You Noticed
If you want to make money editing or proofreading words on paper, the first
thing you have to do is put yourself on paper. After proclaiming that you are,
in fact, a copyeditor or proofreader, you have to trust a résumé to do some of
your talking. So let’s figure out how to make it really sing your praises.
Don’t let lack of experience get you off-key. Everyone starts a new career with
little in the experience department, at least as far as paid work goes. The trick is
identifying unpaid or indirect experience you’ve collected through other work
projects and life pursuits. (If you follow my suggestions in the previous section,
you’ll soon have a lot of related experience to include on your résumé.)
Good editing and proofreading skill-builders are nestled into many other
activities. In this section, I show you how to read between your own lines,
repurposing anything noteworthy you’ve done into real-world credentials.
Reconsidering your résumé
The right résumé — one that highlights your skills and shows your enthusi-
asm and eagerness — may convince a publisher to give you a chance even if
you lack substantial experience. Whether you start by scanning a past
résumé or by jotting ideas on a blank page, your key task here is the same:
Think about your previous jobs, volunteer positions, and even personal expe-
riences, and run down the following list of questions:
278
Part V: Turning Your Skills into Paychecks 

 Where was the editing or proofreading in these activities?
 Where did I review, correct, improve, or rework someone else’s words?
 Where was paperwork involved, and what aspects involved specific,
exacting follow-through skills?
Of course, be sure to list any freelance jobs you’ve done, as well as any
related courses you’ve taken. Until you methodically reconsider your work
history and your life history, you can never really know what valuable cre-
dentials lie buried just beneath the title of another job or hobby.
In Figure 18-1, I present a sample resume that demonstrates how to work
related experience, skills, and interests into your overall presentation.
Crafting your cover letter
Even as your résumé starts to take shape, you want to work on your cover
letter. It may seem a bit premature, but you want to be ready when opportu-
nity knocks, and now that you’re working with words, you can’t just rush
through business correspondence. Your cover letter has to be polished,
proofread, and perfect. There’s nothing like a typo-riddled introduction to say
to editors that you either don’t care or aren’t capable.
As a caring and capable copyeditor or proofreader, you want a simple cover
letter template that you can customize for each potential employer or client.
Your cover letter shouldn’t be more than three or four paragraphs long, with
two or three sentences per paragraph and line spaces between each para-
graph. This format makes for a gratefully quick read for busy editors looking
to hire you. If you mail your cover letter instead of e-mailing it, I recommend
using the same impressive stock as your résumé paper.
In Figure 18-2, I offer one example of a cover letter template, which is geared
toward finding freelance work.

Chapter 18: Hunting for Work
Working with temp agencies
If you’re interested in proofreading, consider
contacting a temporary agency near you.
Temporary agencies can often keep a proof-
reader busy enough to be working full-time or
near full-time. And proofreading as a temp gives
you the advantage of working in a variety of
shops. You may be able to gain some incredible
(and incredibly diverse) experience, make con-
tacts that lead to consistent freelance work
and/or a full-time staff position, and work with
other proofreaders who can share their tricks
of the trade.

Part V: Turning Your Skills into Paychecks 

The first paragraph provides a little background on your experience. The
second paragraph gives your potential employer a glimpse at the good life
your dependability would secure for him or her. Here’s what you really want
to convey (without actually saying it): I’m your go-to person in a pinch, and
I’m going make you look great to your boss. If you’re hoping to freelance,
offering quick turnaround times endears you to potential clients, so offer
away — one-week completions, an entire job over the weekend, whatever it
takes to open the opportunity door and march on through as a hero.
Breaking into Books or Magazines
When you’re ready to take your skills to the paid professional level —
whether as a staffer or freelancer — you’ve got two best friends: Writer’s
Market and the Web.
You don’t need to enjoy what you’re reading as a copyeditor or proofreader,
but wouldn’t life be more fun if you did? Target the publishers of books and
magazines you like; then you’ll be able to work on copy you would read even
if you weren’t being paid.

Finding contacts in Writer’s Market
In Chapters 2 and 3, I list the big players in book and magazine publishing,
but how do you figure out whom to contact within these huge conglomera-
tions? Or, if you’d rather focus your efforts on smaller publishing houses or
only those that are located near your hometown, how do you find them and
determine if the titles they publish interest you?
You definitely need a go-to guide on the guts of the publishing industry, and
luckily for you, one is available as close as the shelf of your local library.
Writer’s Market (F&W Publications, Inc.) is your one-stop shopping bazaar for
information on the wicked world of words. It gives you names, phone num-
bers, Web sites . . . everything you need to start spreading the news of your
professional intentions. And it also gives you information to help you whittle
down your list of dream employers, such as how many books or periodicals
each publisher produces each year and what categories of fiction and nonfic-
tion writing the publisher deals with.
Everything you need to know as you prepare to contact publishers is con-
tained within this bulky tome. But don’t think of it as bulky; embrace it as
your best friend, through thick and thin.
Are you saying to yourself, “But I don’t necessarily want to write anything,
so why would I consult a resource for writers?” Of course you don’t want to
write. (Wait, or do you? If so, check out Writing Copy For Dummies by Jonathan
Kranz, Writing a Romance Novel For Dummies by Leslie Wainger, Writing
Children’s Books For Dummies by Lisa Rojany Buccieri, or any other Wiley
books I can shamelessly plug here.) But the writers and publishers who use
this industry bible are the people who will one day scribble their John
Hancocks on your paychecks. This book guarantees that the hard part — the
taking of names and recording of contact information — has been done for you.
If you’re always on the go, you could opt for the online version of Writer’s
Market. Yup, this baby’s gone big time with www.writersmarket.com. For
an annual fee of $29.99, you get access to up-to-the-minute publishing con-
tacts, and you can search the databases by publishing house, by imprint
name — however you want. The Web site also offers advice, newsletters, and
daily updates, keeping you at the heart of all things published.
Literary Market Place (Information Today) is another great resource for
information about book and magazine publishers, and it also includes informa-
tion on newspapers. Talk about bulky: This one is roughly the size of a phone
book. But if you want to supplement your Writer’s Market research, look for
Literary Market Place in the reference section of your local bookstore or library.

Taking your aspirations online
The Web sites you visit to find jobs are the same places to post your résumé
and let the strangers who matter know you’re trolling for work. Web sites like
www.monster.com, http://hotjobs.yahoo.com/, and www.career
builder.com are great, but there are also editing- and proofreading-specific
Web sites you can try, such as the following:
 www.copyeditor.com: The newsletter Copy Editor has a job board just
for in-house and freelance copyeditors and proofreaders.
 www.editorandpublisher.com: The journal Editor & Publisher’s clas-
sified board includes all types of publishing (including newspaper work).
 www.magazine.org: The Magazine Publishers of America host a job
bank for the consumer magazine publishing industry.
 www.mediabistro.com: One of my favorites, mediabistro.com has
both job listings and a résumé database in which you can advertise your
skills. (See the sidebar “Get to the bistro.”)
 www.publishersmarketplace.com: This Web site’s job board adver-
tises the span of publishing jobs, from sales representatives to editorial
assistants, and you can search by job title, city, or state.
 www.writejobs.com: Though you can’t post your résumé at The Write
Jobs, you can search for freelance positions, magazine jobs, publishing-
industry jobs, and technical-editing jobs.
And don’t forget the Web sites of publishing houses themselves. These days,
most every publisher Web site includes a job board — just look for a Careers
or Jobs link on the homepage.
283
Chapter 18: Hunting for Work
Get to the bistro
There’s one Web site I can’t say enough about,
especially if you live near a big city:
www.mediabistro.com. Proudly declaring
a dedication to “anyone who creates or works
with content,” mediabistro.com is the place to
find work within book and magazine publishing,
share tips, meet others like you, improve your
skills, and advertise your work.
The site features a job board, forums, and a
freelance marketplace. Its periodic mingling
parties give you a chance to actually talk to
people who do what you want to do for a living.
While a lot of the content is free, the premium
content is definitely worth paying for. It’s a great
place to get — and remain — involved in the
publishing industry.

Knock, knock: Contacting publishers
What’s the best way to get through the door to publishers without having to
wield a chainsaw? Try picking up the phone and calling the publisher of inter-
est. Depending on the size and type of publisher (book or magazine), and
your professional goal (staff position or freelance work), you need to tailor
your request for information. Here are some suggestions:
 If you’re cold-calling a large book or magazine publisher to ask about
staff positions (meaning you haven’t seen a position advertised that fits
your skills), and you don’t have the contact name of a managing editor
in a division that interests you, you’ll have to ask for the human
resources division. You’ll get a receptionist, and you may not get much
further. But while you’ve got a human being on the phone, ask whether
you can submit a résumé for future consideration, and whether you
should send it to the human resources department (ask for a name) or
to the managing editor of a particular division. Do your homework:
Know in advance which divisions publish the kinds of books or maga-
zines you want to work on so you can mention them specifically; then
you’re more likely to be given the name and title of the person who
should receive your résumé.
 If you’re contacting a large book publisher about freelance opportuni-
ties, ask to speak to an editorial assistant in whatever division interests
you. Then ask the assistant if she can put you in contact with the pro-
duction editor or managing editor for the imprint that is of greatest
interest to you within that division. A production editor or managing
editor is usually responsible for hiring freelance copyeditors and proof-
readers to work on individual manuscripts (see Chapter 2), and every
imprint will have at least one production editor.
If the assistant (or whomever you initially speak with) resists patching
you through to the production editor or managing editor, explain your
purpose for calling. (“My name is Word Smith, and I am a freelance copy-
editor. I’m very interested in working on Knopf books, and I’m wonder-
ing if you can give me the name of the person in the division who is
responsible for hiring freelance copyeditors.”)
You may not actually get the production editor or managing editor on
the phone, but at least try to get the name. With a name, you can create
correspondence that can spell out your skills and intentions.
If you do actually get to speak to a hiring editor, above all be polite. (“My
name is Word Smith, and I am a freelance copyeditor. I’m very interested
in working on Knopf books, and I’m wondering if you’re looking to
expand your pool of available freelancers.”) Depending on the response,
you may need to simply say, “Thanks for your time. May I send you a
284
Part V: Turning Your Skills into Paychecks 

résumé to have on file”? Or you may find yourself describing your expe-
rience to this person so she knows whether you’re worth considering
for a manuscript on her desk right at that moment.
 If you’re contacting publishers of consumer magazines (those that are
marketed to the general public), keep in mind that you probably want to
inquire about a staff position rather than freelance work. Consumer mag-
azines use fewer freelance copyeditors and proofreaders because the
deadlines come fast and furious as the publication date draws near. Your
best bet may be to simply ask the person who answers the phone for the
name and title of the person responsible for hiring. If you’re feeling bold,
ask if that person is available to take your call. (Chances are the answer
will be no.) Otherwise, simply use the information you receive to get
your résumé and cover letter into the right hands.
It may be a long shot, but you can also check the masthead of a particu-
lar magazine of interest, note the name of the credited copyeditor, and
make a cold call to that person. What would you say? Ask whether the
magazine ever hires freelance copyeditors or proofreaders. Even though
you know the answer will probably be no, the question may open the
door to a conversation with someone who knows the ins and outs of
that organization and can tell you how to get noticed when submitting
your written materials for consideration. That person may also tell you
whom to contact about a staff position.
 If you’re contacting trade magazines or other periodicals (such as the
scholarly sort), my best advice is to pore through past issues before get-
ting on the phone. The staffs of these pubs may be fairly small, and you
may have a decent chance of being connected to the person responsible
for hiring in-house staff or freelance copyeditors and proofreaders. If
you get that person on the line, you want to be sure to sound knowl-
edgeable about the subject matter and the publication. And if you get
the brush-off from the person answering the phone, at least aim for get-
ting the name and title of someone who should receive your résumé.
Selling Your Services to Web Sites
Generating work with Web sites may be easier than you think. As I explain in
Chapter 3, a great way to start is by scouring your favorite Web sites for
errors. When you encounter one, send an e-mail to the site’s Webmaster,
whose contact information is usually at the bottom of the homepage or
included in an “About Us” page. Your e-mail should note the error but also
introduce who you are and why you care enough to point out the need for
correction.
285
Chapter 18: Hunting for Work

Here’s an example:
Dear Webmaster Jason:
As I was browsing your Web site this afternoon, I was surprised to stum-
ble upon an error: In the second paragraph, line two, the word the
appears twice in a row. By the way, I’m a proofreader. I find errors profes-
sionally. This one’s for free, but if you’d like help with the rest of your
site, let me know. My résumé is attached.
I look forward to helping you have a perfect Web site.
Best regards,
Polly Proofreader
Of course, the tone of this note may be too lighthearted for a Web site like
www.fortune.com, but you can change your language to reflect that of the
site itself. Your approach to a site like www.luckymag.com should be very
different from your approach to a site like www.entrepreneur.com. The
first should be more lighthearted, while the second should be professional
and reflect some knowledge of the company and its business.
286
Part V: Turning Your Skills into Paychecks 
Breaking into consumer magazines
I’ll be honest: Getting work on a consumer mag-
azine is a bit more difficult than getting work
with a book publisher. There’s a time-honored
tradition of hiring interns (who may not even see
a blue pencil for the better part of a semester).
If you’re willing to start as an intern, how do you
make it happen? Oftentimes, magazines hire
journalism students who start as fact-checkers,
researching and verifying factual statements
within the magazine’s articles, charts, graphs,
and the like. (The job may feel a bit like hazing,
but that’s just how the industry tends to work.)
If you haven’t studied journalism, do your best
to present yourself as an organized, fact-
obsessed person willing to play whatever role
the magazine wants you to play. If you don’t live
in New York or another city home to lots of con-
sumer magazine publishers, you need to be will-
ing to move, and you also need to be willing to
do the internship for free — or close to free —
with the goal of proving your worth.
What if you don’t want to move? Or what if you
need to get more experience before trying to
land a consumer magazine job that actually
pays and involves something other than fact-
checking? You may be able to find work locally
with a regional consumer publication. If you live
in a fairly large city, you may discover that
there’s a tourism and travel magazine about the
city that gets placed in hotel rooms and other
touristy spots. Or if you look through the maga-
zines at your grocery store or local newsstand,
you may notice a regional consumer magazine
whose readership is city residents.
You can search online for magazines that pub-
lish in your region or state, and I encourage you
to visit the membership directory at the City and
Regional Magazine Association Web site at
www.citymag.org, which also boasts a job
board.

Before you take the time to send an e-mail of this sort, first qualify the Web
site’s owner as a potential client. You may not want to query sites that
update their information constantly; if the copy changes every hour, chances
are the site owner won’t invest in editing or proofreading services because
the product just doesn’t exist long enough to warrant the expense. (If the
copy stays put for a few days or weeks, however, you may be in business.)
Also, sites that require security clearance, including news, government, and
banking sites, may not be your best bets. But retailers, restaurants, and other
companies have a lot at stake in their online copy because that copy can
build (or break) their reputations for a long period of time.
If you can become the official editor or proofreader for one Web site, you
should be able to leverage that position to land similar work for other sites.
See Chapter 3 for additional tips for working with online content, and be sure
to check out Chapter 17 for a crash course on copyediting and proofreading
electronic documents. When you edit Web content, chances are you’ll never
touch a piece of paper.
Organizing Your Efforts
Sometimes the search for work can take time, and you may find that you con-
tact a whole lot of people at a whole lot of companies before landing the
job(s) you want.
Here’s what you don’t want to happen: You’re hanging out at home one day,
surfing channels and wondering why no one has called to offer you a job.
Then the phone rings. Some professional-sounding person asks to speak to
you and proceeds to ask you some questions about the nicely crafted résumé
you submitted several weeks ago. Problem is, you don’t recognize this
person’s name, and he didn’t identify the company he’s calling from. Time to
panic? That depends.
As long as you organize your job-search efforts, no panic is required. That’s
because you’re going to keep a journal (written or typed — doesn’t matter to
me!) of every phone call you make, every person you speak to, every contact
name you receive, and every résumé you submit. You’re going to note the
dates associated with each piece of information (“Spoke with editorial 
assistant Jay Brown on 4/19”). And when you hear back from a potential
employer — with good news or bad — you’re going to update that entry to
reflect its status.
With this journal in hand (or on screen), you can quickly sift through entries
as soon as your professional-sounding caller states his name, so you have no
doubt that he’s calling from XYZ company that received your résumé three
weeks ago in response to a posting on the Copy Editor online job board.
287
Chapter 18: Hunting for Work

You can even take this organizing process a step further to include informa-
tion about the publisher so your mind doesn’t go blank during just such a
conversation.
Here are some suggestions for types of info to include in each journal entry:
 Company name, address, phone number, and Web site.
 Contact name, phone number, and e-mail address.
 How you found out about the company.
 What types of publications the company produces.
 Recent mergers or other significant changes to the company structure.
 What you know about whether the company is hiring full-time staff mem-
bers or freelancers.
 Notes on any phone conversations you’ve had: Who answered? What
information did you get?
 The date you sent a résumé and cover letter.
 Any information you may know about the person you sent the résumé to.
For example, if you know that he used to work for a different publisher
and is new at this company, write it down. After you have an initial con-
versation with him, write down anything you find out, including whether
he’s married, has kids, enjoys gardening, recently traveled to Scotland . . .
anything that may be a good starting point for a future conversation.

F
reelance editing or proofreading doesn’t require six diplomas and five
more years of residency. The start-up cost of launching your freelance
career? The price of one computer with Internet access, a good printer, some
nice stationery for your invoices, and business cards. You don’t need much
luck either — just good resources (like this book) and a strong work ethic.
And you don’t even have to be initiated into some geeky grammar club.
The truth is, you start by simply saying “I am a freelance copyeditor (or
proofreader)” and meaning it. Can you then discuss freelancing for ten min-
utes with a straight face? Presto chango: Your transformation is complete.
You’ve acquired all the credentials you need to start baby-stepping toward
your first paycheck.
The journey may be a lot quicker than you think. In this chapter, I offer a bit
of inspiration in case you’re wavering about whether freelancing is right for
you, and then I explain how to lay some groundwork to get your first jobs.
So, jump right into this newborn career path, and watch how fast it grows up!

to Consider Freelancing
You’re not the first person to pursue a career as a freelance copyeditor or
proofreader, so don’t isolate yourself. Support is everywhere. See my recom-
mended list of resources in Appendix C, and sit back and relax while I take
you through a few inspiring success stories and their accompanying insights.

Freedom and flexibility
As an aspiring actor, I have to drop everything whenever an audition comes
a’callin’ — this one could be my big break and there’s no telling when I’ll get
my next opportunity. Needless to say, my actor’s schedule wasn’t so conducive
to finding employment in the 9–5 world. My prospects were bleak, and then:
Enter Proofreading — and its full-time paycheck with the flexibility of setting
my own hours. I have firm deadlines, but I decide how and where I meet
them. I can and frequently do read during downtime on the set — no matter
where that set is located. Proofreading will always be a star in my book.
Amy Marshall
Picture a schedule as pliable as you need it to be. If you’re a night owl who
works best from midnight to 4 a.m., don’t bother justifying it; your proofread-
ing hours have been approved — by you. Do you need Monday through
Friday off to paint your oeuvre, write your novel, earn your Master’s, launch
your start-up company? No problem. Get your freelance copyediting done on
the weekends to tide your income over until the big IPO.
When my daughter was born, I really didn’t want to return to my full-time
job. I wanted to be at home with her. I was always good at writing so I
figured I would try freelance copyediting. I contacted some publishing
companies I knew of, took some editing tests and now am able to work at
home, be with my daughter, and still earn a decent salary around my
schedule.
Marjorie Rilms
Let’s not forget mobility. Proofreading and copyediting can be done from any
place on the planet, and a few places off the planet, too. During your morning
train commute, on sleepy Sunday mornings at home, between beach naps —
wherever and whenever you can read is wherever and whenever you can work.
A no-fee education
I’m a freelance writer who loves to learn, not just about my craft and my
career, but about everything — because each new lesson opens the door to
another article I can write as “an expert.” Which is why my proofreading
career has been such an unexpected boon to my writing career. Every book
I proofread is like having a one-on-one class with the author, who’s more
often than not an established expert in his or her field. Although I request —
and receive — many how-to books about writing, my tutelage actually spans
from the history of the London Tube to the intimate tribulations of modern-day
teens. Proofreading has been even better than a free education. I’m getting
paid to learn!

Part V: Turning Your Skills into Paychecks 

One thing’s for sure: Higher education is not cheap. College tuition is sky
high, and even the cost of books for college can be prohibitive.
What if you could get a brilliant education for free? Without spending a
penny, you could be introduced to completely new subjects, new ideas, new
everythings that could inspire you to think, do, and succeed at new any-
things. With such eclectic knowledge, I’m sure you’d be the most fascinating
person at parties, too.
Now, what if you could actually get paid for that brilliant and eclectic 
knowledge? I earned more than $1,000 for proofreading — and positively 
relishing — The Da Vinci Code. Sure, without this profession, I could’ve 
purchased the book for $24.95 instead. But you don’t need a degree in mathe-
matics to figure out which deal worked out better for me — and which deal
can work out better for you.
I’ve also been paid to read Oh, Yuck!: The Encyclopedia of Everything Nasty;
Sugarbusters!; The Little Strength Training Book; and Sex for the Clueless — all
books I probably wouldn’t have picked up on my own. All books that taught
me something, that gave me a better understanding of the people and world
around me, which in turn helped me to recognize and nurture untapped
aspects of myself. You too could find some unknown topic that truly lights
you up. Sometimes the proofreading paycheck is second fiddle to the epipha-
nies that come from the work.
Plus a hefty paycheck!
I started proofreading to supplement my writing income, but, in little over a
year, I ended up surpassing it altogether. A few modest jobs turned into a
few glowing recommendations, and next thing you know it’s my third year
working for Time magazine as a freelance proofreader — earning $75/hour!
And lately I’ve been earning nearly double that rate, proofreading and
copyediting for corporations and ad agencies. I can’t wait to see what
caliber of income is waiting just around the corner!
Anthony Tedesco
How much money can you earn from freelance copyediting or proofreading?
I know that “sky’s the limit” is a weary cliché, but the earning potential is
really that limitless. My proofreading income quickly soared up to six figures,
and with each new project I get more efficient and savvier about how to
increase profits. A full-time freelance editor or proofreader can definitely 
survive — and thrive — without any other source of income. Part-time 
freelancers can really benefit, too, generating a significant amount of supple-
mental income through even just a few projects a month.
291
Chapter 19: Preparing for a Freelance Career

The number of simultaneous projects (and paychecks) you accept is com-
pletely up to you. Why would one publisher give you more than you could
handle? One publisher wouldn’t. But you don’t work with one publisher.
You’re a fearless freelancer who works with any and every publisher you
choose — and no single publisher has to know. Some freelancers juggle five
projects on their desk at once. (Recommended for hyper-organized and
wholly manic people only.)
The point is, so long as you’re making deadlines and sleeping occasionally,
you can take on as much or as little work as you want. It’s really important to
know yourself and how much you can handle.
292
Part V: Turning Your Skills into Paychecks 
Covering your duff and other key stuff
When you accept a staff job, the important
things, like how much you’ll be paid, are pretty
clear. But when you’re freelancing, sometimes
clarity is hard to come by. Here are a few ways
to protect yourself and nurture business:
 Don’t start a job without a contract. If you
are not presented with a contract before
you start the work, create one yourself that
specifies your project, pay rate, deadline,
and any limits you wish to include for pro-
tection. Which leads us to . . .
 Don’t feel uncomfortable asking for limits.
As a freelancer, you are the only person
looking out for you. You can ask for a clause
in your contract that specifies a maximum
number of revisions, total-hour limits, and
hourly rates, should any of the limits be
expended.
 Create a niche for yourself. Is there some-
thing you enjoy that you’d love to read
about? Specialize as a copyeditor or proof-
reader for a specific field, subject, or hobby.
 Track your time. Even if you’re working for a
flat fee, keep track of your total hours to
determine exactly how much you’re getting
paid. This is useful information for later,
when you can decide whether a particular
project or publisher is worth the effort
expended.
 Make some friends in the field. Get out
there and schmooze at workshops and con-
ferences. (Book Expo America is a good
conference, and it is held each spring, usu-
ally rotating between New York, Chicago,
and Washington, D.C.) Buy industry-related
books and magazines. Join a professional
association such as the Editorial Freelancers
Association (www.the-efa.org) or The
Bookbinders’ Guild of New York (www.
bookbindersguild.org). Take a few
classes, even online. The more people you
know, the more real information you’ll have
to go by. And venting with people who
understand what you’re going through is
never a bad thing.

Considering the Cash: 
How Much to Charge
Let’s talk turkey — here’s where we get into the glorious details on getting
paid. Before you accept your first job, think about what you want to earn. You
may or may not have the opportunity to set your own rate, but you can at
least identify if someone is offering you way too little for your time.
Knowing the industry standards
The proofreading field operates mostly on hourly rates, beginning around $12
per hour for smaller publishers in smaller towns and climbing to roughly $25
per hour for standard publishing houses. However, if you start working con-
sistently for a publisher or let your interests develop into specialized exper-
tise of certain genres, your pay can double these rates.
Copyediting starts off with basic rates of $30 to $35 per hour, rising to $40 per
hour with experience. Heavy copyediting and technical copyediting can
demand $40 to $50 per hour.
If you work for clients that you know are rich in resources, such as corpora-
tions or advertising agencies, you may be able to earn double or even triple
these rates. Within the book field, after you establish yourself as a hot free-
lance commodity, you can demand increased rates for rush projects.
Consulting firms and other independent companies often contact publishers
to get the names of their top proofreaders. You can make a quick fortune
when you work for big businesses — they pay big business rates!
Charging per hour or per page
While most clients pay by the hour, some pay by the page. And some may ask
you to determine which method to use when tallying your final paycheck.
Here are some considerations:
 Per-hour rates: Billing hourly sounds easy enough until you try to
track how long you worked between loads of laundry or while sitting
outside the elementary school waiting to pick up your kids. It’s nearly
impossible to accurately assess your time (was I concentrating fully?
Half-concentrating?) and precisely record it. If you bill this way, keep
careful notes of the time you spend on the job, but know that you’re
likely to be making some guesses.
293
Chapter 19: Preparing for a Freelance Career

 Per-page rates: If you’re asked to name your per-page rate, or if a client
offers this kind of rate, you want to be sure it translates into adequate
compensation for your time. Therefore, you need to calculate how the
per-page rate translates into a per-hour rate.
If you’re working with a publisher or anyone else who’s used to hiring
copyeditors and proofreaders, ask this question: “How many pages per
hour do you expect from your (copyeditors or proofreaders)?” The
answer will depend on the document’s layout, font, lines per page, level
of edit requested, and genre of content (standard or technical in nature),
but you can probably expect to hear up to six pages for copyediting and
ten to twelve pages for proofreading.
Use the answer, plus your desired hourly rate, to calculate how much
you should charge per page. If you’re proofreading and want to earn $20
per hour, for example, you probably want to charge $2 per page.
Here’s a nice benefit of being paid per page: As you gain experience and
can do your job faster, your hourly rate goes up. For example, if you
charge $2 per page and can eventually read 18 pages per hour, you earn
$36 per hour. Improving your skills can really pay off!
However, before you commit to a per-page rate, I strongly recommend
that you ask to see the project. You need to edit at least ten pages and
time yourself so you have a feel for the job and how much time and work
will be involved.
Creating an invoice template
Invoicing is easy. Some projects arrive with an invoice form that you just fill
out. If you don’t get one of those, put together a one-page document that con-
tains the following info:
 Your name and company name (if applicable)
 You contact info: address, phone, and e-mail
 Your Social Security or federal tax ID number
 The name and contact info of the company you’re billing
 An invoice number (if the client requires it)
 The name of the project
 The date you began and completed work
 Your hourly rate and how long the project took, or the per-page rate and
the number of pages involved
294
Part V: Turning Your Skills into Paychecks 

 The grand total
 The words Payable Upon Receipt (which simply indicate that the client
can’t let the invoice sit on a desk for three months before giving it some
attention)
See Figure 19-1 for an example.
Beating a Path to Clients
Generating opportunities is the first step toward freelance editing and proof-
reading success. After you’re a seasoned pro, the work will find you, but ini-
tially you need to find prospects for yourself. The key to success is an
eclectic search: Use both traditional and alternative means, and look for work
from as many different angles as possible.

Chapter 19: Preparing for a Freelance Career

Considering the usual suspects
My first suggestion is to take a look at Chapter 18, if you haven’t already done
so. The advice I offer there about researching potential employers applies
here as well. Here’s the scoop, in a nutshell:
 Books: If you want to work in book publishing, start by considering pub-
lishers whose titles you already read, and make Writer’s Market your new
best friend.
 Magazines: If you’re interested in magazine work, you may find it diffi-
cult to get freelance opportunities with print magazines. Because maga-
zines publish so frequently, they often have in-house copyeditors and
proofreaders. (Exceptions exist, as Anthony Tedesco’s testimonial ear-
lier in this chapter proves.)
If you’re hooked on periodicals, you may want to target each magazine’s
online counterpart. Copyediting and proofreading are crucial to these
online pubs because the copy can be read (and its typos ridiculed) for-
ever. Yet, lucky for you, their budgets are usually more limited than
those of their print counterparts so they may not employ full-time copy-
editors or proofreaders. Freelancers to the rescue!
 Corporate publications: If you’re considering corporate work, you’ve
got some networking to do. Start by letting friends, family members, and
even casual acquaintances who work in big companies know that you’re
in the market for freelance work. Put yourself into networking situations
whenever you can, and always carry business cards with you, just in case.
 Online publications: Mine the Internet for mistakes. Look at Web sites
that you’d be interested in reading anyway, and when you run across
typos, send the Webmaster a polite letter that points out the problems
and offers your services.
Checking the classifieds, more 
closely than you think
Ah, Sunday morning: the perfect (albeit only) time to pick up the Sunday edi-
tion of any city’s major newspaper and start leisurely perusing its classified
ads. You may occasionally find freelance jobs in those listings, in which case,
have a ball! But if you don’t find what you’re looking for in that particular edi-
tion, take a bird’s-eye view.
296
Part V: Turning Your Skills into Paychecks 

Expand your vision to include listings for Editor, Production Editor, and
Publishing. Within these sections, take particular interest in the job listings
for production editor positions. (If you’re looking for proofreading work, also
pay close attention to listings calling for full-time copyeditors.) These people
may become your clients — the in-house folks who make your freelancing
career. Scan the job responsibilities in the listing. See any requirement that
resembles “work with freelancers”?
Write down the publisher’s contact information, and put it under your
metaphorical pillow for about three weeks. That’s usually how long it takes
for the publisher to fill the position — and for the Freelance Fairy to turn that
phone number into a shiny new job lead for you. Pick up the phone, call, and
ask for the name of the new person hired in the advertised position. Then,
reap the following benefits:
 Because your contact hasn’t yet begun soliciting copyeditors or proof-
readers, you may be the only one sending in materials for consideration.
 You’ll establish a relationship with a brand-new employee before anyone
else begins the process.
Taking your search online
Here are two more resources overflowing with job listings, which may offer
you direct employment opportunities (through freelance listings) or indirect
opportunities (through listings for full-time production editors or copyedi-
tors, with whom you can establish relationships as soon as they’re hired):
 Publishers’ Web sites: Go to the sites of book or magazine publishers,
and find a section labeled “Careers” or “Employment,” often located
within the “About Us” heading or at the bottom of the home page.
 Career Web sites: Don’t forget about www.monster.com, www.career
builder.com, http://hotjobs.yahoo.com/, www.mediabistro.com,
and the job board at www.copyeditor.com, all of which I tout in
Chapter 18.

Dealing with a client’s process
Having pizza for dinner is fast and easy, right?
Only if you get it delivered hot. Pick up a pizza-
making kit, with the flour and the sauce and the
doctoring to be done, and dinner gets a bit more
complicated. If you have to start from scratch
by making your own dough . . . well, it may be a
while before you sit down and chew.
Different clients also deliver your work in differ-
ent ways — some neatly assembled, some
messier than a counter full of mixing bowls.
Some clients are like your buddy Carmine at the
pizza joint around the corner. They give you
ample turnaround time for each project, mail
everything with a style guide and individual style
sheet, and throw in tons of comfy, huge rubber
bands to boot. Sometimes you even find an
invoice complete but for the few blanks you
need to fill in. And best of all, they pay you within
two weeks of receipt of the project and invoice!
And can you say FedEx?
Then there’s the next-tier crowd — the pizza
kits of the publishing world. They send you the
project and sometimes include a style sheet or
style guide. You write your own invoice, but they
give you the guidelines. (Don’t forget to include
your name and address and invoice number and
title and author and rate per hour and page
count and amount due, thank you.) Sure, they
pay you . . . within a month or two or so. They’re
reliable, but occasionally a pain in the arse.
Then there are the stinkers — the ones that
force you to make the pizza from scratch.
Sometimes you have to pick up projects or at
least pay for the shipping yourself. You write
your own invoices and have to stay on top of
them, lest they forget to pay you. The pages may
come marked up, smudged, or even torn. And
you need to get working on that style sheet,
because you definitely won’t be getting one.
Obviously, I’m generalizing here, but you’ll
notice some significant differences between
clients. Some contact you by e-mail for a pro-
ject, while others call. You may have to take a
proofreading test for a few, while others send
you a first-time trial project to make sure you’re
up to snuff. In the book industry, bigger publish-
ers have huge longevity with their production
editors — five or ten years or more — which is
great because you can develop a steady trickle
of work. Other publishers have production edi-
tors who last no more than two years. This can
sometimes be great as well, because when
those production editors move, you have an
opportunity to work with yet another pub house!

 Walking through your first project
 Caring for your connections
 Letting the jobs find you
 Being the boss you’ve always wanted
P
ut your party hat on! This chapter celebrates (and walks you through)
your first job and the many splendid ways you can keep your next jobs
rolling in. It’s your official transition from green freelancer to expert free-
lancer making mucho green.
Expertise will grow your opportunities exponentially. Publishers will start
seeking out your services, and with all that freelance income, you may decide
to keep more of it by setting up your own corporation or LLC. Or maybe
you’ll want to capitalize on your freelance connections to catch the perfect
full-time job at the company of your dreams.
No matter which benefits you decide to reap, the good life begins with land-
ing that first freelance gig and delivering it like your editor’s very own Fourth-
of-July fireworks. I start the chapter by showing you how.
Handling Your First Project
Woohoo! Your hard work — on your résumé, your experience, your network-
ing (see Chapter 18) — has paid off, and you’ve received your first project.
Don’t panic. The whole process will be as easy as your first day of school —
that is, after you stopped worrying and enjoyed your first day of school. In
this section, I take you step-by-step until you’re at the top of the entire class.

Celebrating the grand opening
If you receive your first project in a Jiffy bag, you’ll be tempted to treat it like
the gift that it is — by tearing it open in a frenzy of glee. Resist the temptation,
or else you’ll be covered in cardboard fluffies. If your project is delivered in a
box, feel free to tear it open like it’s your eighth birthday. (But you may want
to save the box, as you can probably cover the address labels and use it to
return your work.)
If you happen to be proofreading a book, here’s what you may find inside
your package:
 The latest pass of galleys
 A dead (or foul) manuscript, if you’re doing a comparison read
 A cover letter to you detailing all the trials and tribulations the book has
survived thus far, as well as your deadline (see Figure 20-1)
 A blank invoice
 A style sheet
Dear Suzy:
 
Enclosed are the second-pass pages of BEDTIME TRYSTS for you to proofread. The 
first-pass pages are included. This is a good romance, and I think you’ll enjoy the story. 
Unfortunately, the copyeditor was a little too focused on the mechanical task of correcting 
punctuation to really “read” the manuscript—and the first proofreader missed quite a 
number of corrections. Keep an eye out for formatting problems, and double-check that 
the line and letter spacings are consistent.
 
Please review the proofreader’s guidelines before beginning each job. Also, please 
flag all queries on Post-Its instead of writing them on the proof pages.
 
Please return this by Tuesday, 22 March, and feel free to call before then if you 
encounter any problems with this project.
Thanks a bunch,
Melanie Wells

Part V: Turning Your Skills into Paychecks 

If you’re copyediting, or if you’re working on a project other than a book —
an article, an annual report, a Web site — you may not receive a package at
all. Instead, you’re likely to get an e-mail with a Microsoft Word document or
PDF file attached. (PDFs are accessible through Adobe Reader, which comes
bundled into most computers. You can download a free copy of Adobe
Reader from www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html.)
You’ll miss the joy of unwrapping your present, but you’ll savor the benefits
of working electronically (see Chapter 17).
Beating the deadline
Deadlines are aptly named because, if you miss one, it’ll most likely be the
end of your copyediting or proofreading life — with that publisher anyway.
The deadline is everything. I repeat, in flashing neon giant billboard capital
letters:
THE DEADLINE IS EVERYTHING.
It’s everything to you and to the editor who’s waiting on you, and to the com-
positor who’s waiting on the editor, and to the company or publisher who’s
waiting on the compositor. Missing your deadline has an unfortunate domino
effect, knocking down the punctuality of everyone who follows you. Don’t
miss your deadline.
But don’t miss sleep worrying about it, either. Copyediting and proofreading
deadlines are usually reasonable, especially if you’re working for a company
or publisher that hires freelancers on a regular basis. If you have three weeks
to complete a 400-page book, just divide 400 into 20 days (so your editor will
receive your project on the 21st day). Your daily editing or proofing sched-
ule? Twenty pages a day. If you want to be an MVP, try adding a few extra
pages a day and returning your project early. Editors love team players. As an
MVP, you can be sure your editor will want you back up to bat on the very
next project.
If there’s (gulp) any chance that you can’t make your deadline, be sure to call
up front instead of after the deadline has passed. There’s nothing your editor
can do post-deadline except be late. Give him — and your career — a fighting
chance by sending notification and apologies as early as possible.
When your project is officially en route back to the editor, call him to say so,
and also to slip in a “Hey, need me for any other projects?” It can’t hurt to
ask, and it may land your next job. Now, that’s instant-turnaround business.
301
Chapter 20: Keeping the Freelance Jobs Coming

Doing the work
You’ll develop your own sensible process that works for your lifestyle and for
the type of project at hand, but I want to offer some insights into the methods
I find effective. Check out the chapters in Parts II and III for lots more details
about how to approach the work itself.
Copyediting or proofreading on hard copy
Here’s how I suggest approaching an edit or proofread on hard copy: If it’s a
cold read, just plunk it down in the center of your tidy editing desk. If it’s a
comparison read, place the most recent copy on the right side of your desk
and the marked-up copy on the left side. (If you’re a southpaw, reverse that.
The crux is that you want to be able to write on the newest copy comfortably
with your dominant hand.) You want to have your dictionary and style guide
within reach too.
Before you make any marks, read the instructions that came with the project,
as well as the house style sheet and anything else sent to you. Use your pre-
requisite red colored pencil, and write clearly, neatly, and nicely. (You never
want to risk insulting anyone in your queries.) Then it’s just about catching
all the errors you can.
Your project is probably enveloped in a slew of rubber bands. Save that slew
in the delivery box or bag under your desk. (Editors choose their own rubber
bands, so you score big points if you return a project with all those rubber
bands you received enclosed. Quirky, but true.)
Copyediting or proofreading electronically
If you’re going to work on an electronic document, read through Chapter 17
for my suggestions on preparing your workspace for optimal output and mini-
mal discomfort. You want to have your reference materials nearby, of course,
and spend just as much time getting familiar with the house style and the
project instruction sheet as you would if you were working on hard copy.
(Sure, it’s easier to undo your edits in electronic files than on hard copy, but
why waste your time?)
Wrapping the project
You’re done with the project! Nice work. Now it’s time to send it back to the
person who hired you and take some next steps to make sure you get hired
again.
302
Part V: Turning Your Skills into Paychecks 

Returning a hard copy edit or proofread
If you’ve been editing or proofreading a project on hard copy, write a short
cover letter to the editor (which I explain in the upcoming section “Thanking
your client: The all-important cover letter”), create or complete an invoice,
and put those two pieces on top of the finished manuscript. Wrap rubber
bands around the whole shebang, and that’s what you’re going to ship back.
Most likely, you’ll return it using the same method by which it arrived: FedEx,
UPS, DHL, U.S. mail, or (if you live fairly close to the company) a messenger.
Shipping services should be paid for by the company that hired you; you may
get a prepaid or account-billed shipping label with the project manuscript, or
you may be asked to include the shipping costs in your invoice. (If the pub-
lisher asks you to incur any other costs, such as photocopying the marked-
up manuscript, include them on separate lines in your invoice as well.)
If the shipment goes through FedEx, UPS, DHL, or a messenger, the company
will give you a tracking or reference number that you should hold onto until
you know the package has been delivered. If you ship through the post office,
request a tracking number and receipt. The last thing you want is for a pack-
age to disappear, but it does happen occasionally, and a tracking number is
essential in that situation.
If you work with clients who favor FedEx, UPS, or DHL, you may want to open
online accounts at www.fedex.com, www.ups.com, and www.dhl.com. With
your contact info stored, you’ll never waste time repeating your address, and
you’ll be immediately identified by your phone number when you call for a
pickup. Plus, it’s free. You can register online and have the courier at your
door the same day with only a few clicks. Quite convenient, especially if
you’re still in your kangaroo pajamas at 3 p.m.
Returning an electronic edit or proofread
When you complete an electronic copyedit or proofread, you may need to
e-mail the document(s) back to the assigning editor, or you may need to go
online to the publisher’s FTP (File Transfer Protocol) site, which is essentially
a big online filing cabinet that allows you to transfer documents. Your client
will undoubtedly tell you how you should return the finished product, but if
that doesn’t happen, be sure to ask. If you need to use an FTP site, the assign-
ing editor will provide the URL and any password or other security informa-
tion you need to access it.
Don’t delete your completed files as soon as you e-mail or transfer them. No
one should trust technology quite that much! Hold onto them at least until
you confirm that they’ve made it into the editor’s hands. Even then, you may
want to keep them around; until the document is actually printed, you never
know if you may need to revisit the work you’ve done.
303
Chapter 20: Keeping the Freelance Jobs Coming

After you transfer files onto an FTP site, or at the same time that you e-mail
the files back to the assigning editor (if that’s the preference), write a short
e-mail telling the editor anything she needs to know about the job. Attach a
completed invoice for the job (and keep a copy for your records), and be
sure to thank the editor for the opportunity. (Much more on that topic in the
next section.)
Thanking your client: The all-important cover letter
Miss Manners may not require that you write a thank-you note to the person
who hired you, but doing so will help ensure that you get another project —
soon.
Enclose a cover letter (or e-mail, if you’re working electronically) with every
single project you return. No exceptions. Especially if you’re new to the
industry, the person who hired you is taking a chance by putting so much
responsibility into your hands. Telling this person that you appreciate the
opportunity to work together is appropriate, considerate, and business-savvy.
Try to add something personal in the letter, if you can. If you know that this
person has a vacation coming up, has been caring for a spouse with the flu, or
has been stressed about difficult deadlines, write a few words that show you
were listening. Do whatever you can to conscientiously build the relationship.
And never disparage even the most dreadful of projects — not in your cover
letter, not anywhere in your business world. It’s tempting, especially if you
think this person would agree with you, but don’t do it. There’s always the
chance that the project was written by this person’s best friend. When asked,
just say that you found the writing really “interesting.”
In Figure 20-2, I present a sample cover letter for your consideration.
Obviously, yours needs to be written from scratch to address the specifics of
your work situation. But this example offers a sense of the tone you should
aim for.
Asking for feedback and following up
Whenever you complete your first freelancing project with a new client, you
should close your cover letter with a request for feedback, clarifying that you
want it so you can meet this person’s needs even more effectively on future
projects.
Asking for feedback shows dedication and initiative. You’re more than a flash
in the freelancer’s job pan — you’ll be constantly improving, so this person
constantly has more reasons to hire you.

Part V: Turning Your Skills into Paychecks 

Here’s the schedule: Return your first project, wait two weeks, and then call
the person who hired you — but only on a Wednesday or Thursday between
3 and 4 p.m. When she answers, respond in your most calm, cozy, and bag-
gage-free voice: “Hi, it’s Suzy Q. Proofreader. I wanted to check in with you on
the proofread I returned to you a few weeks ago, The Clandestine Holiday. I’d
love to hear your feedback, since it was our first time working together.”
Then pause. This person may respond a few different ways. Here are your
response notes for each situation:
 She’s too busy: “Sorry, Suzy Q, work has been so hectic that I haven’t
reviewed it yet.” Your response: an empathetic laugh and an offer to
help. “If you’re completely bogged down, I’m more than happy to take on
some more work.” Whether she offers you work on the spot or thanks
you but declines, you’re now on the forefront of this person’s mind as
available and considerate.
 She gives great feedback: She offers not just positive feedback but help-
ful tips, too. You thank her and say that you’ll be sure to keep those
points in mind for any future projects.
Dear Lynn:
Thanks for another favorite. I really enjoy those feel-good romances.
Other than modifying some punctuation to make the second story a little less 
exclamation-point heavy (noted in the manuscript), this cold read was fairly straightfor-
ward. 
My schedule includes a lot more time devoted to freelance work, so I can say a big YES to 
anything you want to send on over. Also, if you know other editors/publishers in need of 
freelancers, I would greatly appreciate any referrals.
Thanks so much for keeping me busy!
Sincerely,
Suzy Q. Proofreader

 She gives negative feedback: “Well, Suzy, since you asked, I was a little
disappointed in your work because I identified about 40 more correc-
tions than you did.” Breathe. It’s all right. You’re learning, and this is part
of the natural process of getting great at this. Your response: “I’m sorry
about that, and I’m doubly glad I called, because I’m very committed to a
career as a copyeditor/proofreader. If I missed errors, I’d like to know
what they are so I can improve my skills and catch them in the future. I’d
really appreciate it if you could get me the pages that I missed correc-
tions on or just send me the corrected manuscript once the compositor
finishes, so I can review it and be truly prepared for upcoming proofs.”
Offer to pay for postage if the work is happening on hard copy.
When you get the corrected pages or document, really study the errors
you missed. Grammar, punctuation, and spelling problems are finite —
you’ll quickly figure out the common ones because they come up over
and over again. (See Chapter 12 for lots of hints.)
Don’t forget to send this person a note or an e-mail after you review the
errors. Take responsibility for your mistakes, and assure her that your future
work will be improved. Let her know that you really appreciate her help with
your improvement. You’d be surprised how a glitch like this can even create
a stronger bond with a client; she’ll respect the commitment, effort, and pro-
fessionalism you showed by transforming a potentially problematic situation
into a positive interaction.
306
Part V: Turning Your Skills into Paychecks 
What if the payment never arrives?
It happens occasionally — though never to the
same person twice because it’s a lesson you
need to learn only once. I hope I can save you
from learning it the hard way with the help of
this unfortunate story:
I used to love working with Carol Publishing —
one of my very first clients. Editors would
send me such interesting books: on the
most magical honeymoon spots, where to
find the best ice cream, how to learn for-
eign languages. All fluff and fun, so I didn’t
really mind that the company took over 60
days to pay outstanding invoices. Truth be
told, I was new and just grateful they had
hired me at all. Year Two working for them
was a different story. I had many of their
editors sending me projects, and my out-
standing balance totaled over $7,000. My
concern finally kicked in but it was too late:
Out of the blue, the company went bank-
rupt. “Substantial creditors” would get paid
first 
— 
if 
funds 
were 
available.
Proofreaders and the rest of the freelancers
were at the bottom of that barrel. That
$7,000 was never paid to me.
The moral to that irksome, real-life account?
Bill promptly. Don’t let bills pile up, and don’t
take one more project from a company unless
you’ve already been paid for the last project, or
unless you know the company is credible and
flush. Some proofreaders keep projects in hock
until they get back pay, but this method of
extortion is ill-advised. You did the work, and
you deserve to get paid.

Caring for Your Connections
With so many capable copyeditors and proofreaders out there, how can you
set yourself ahead of the pack? By building relationships with editors, other
clients, and, in some cases, authors. Nurturing these connections takes know-
how. As someone who knows how, I’m proud to share a few critical secrets
I’ve discovered along my way.
Monday morning check-in
The best way to check in with an editor or other client is through an e-mail
sent Monday morning before 8:45. Please note: that’s e-mail, not phone.
Ever heard of the song “I Don’t Like Mondays”? The Boomtown Rats may
have recorded it, but lots of people empathize with it every Monday when
they show up for work and are immediately mired in a swampful of back-
logged work. If you bother someone with a phone call during this time,
there’s a good chance you’ll be singing “I Don’t Like Mondays” for the rest
of your week.
Show you’re in the know by sending an e-mail instead. Your contact will know
you’re available and show his thanks by keeping you in mind while doling out
projects for the coming week.
Don’t over-think the content of your e-mail. You can try to be clever in the
e-mail’s subject line — Your manuscripts miss me! or Copyediting for sale —
but don’t get too flip. Then just follow with two or three sentences, such as
Good morning, David,
I’m available for any and all proofreading you have coming up this week.
My schedule is flexible, and I can deliver on standard or rush deadlines.
Thanks very much,
Suzy
Or if you’ve built up some rapport, and you know that this person trusts your
professionalism,
Hi Jane,
Got any torrid romances for a dependable copyeditor? Or a thriller or a biog-
raphy or, heck, even a textbook?
Looking forward,
Suzy

A little something special
You can show your appreciation in many ways to someone who has helped
launch and/or nurture your freelance editing career, but the best way is
always with your words. Say thank you. Editors and other clients don’t get to
hear it as often as you’d think.
You can also resurrect the lost art of the thank-you note, which doesn’t have
to be formal. Even a few casual words of gratitude seem substantial when
they’re handwritten on a card and sent the old-fashioned way — with stamps
and steps to a mailbox.
As you develop ongoing relationships with your contacts and the projects are
coming in on a regular basis, you should consider elevating your thank-yous
to include a gift around Thanksgiving — because you’ve got a lot to be thank-
ful for. No need for a spending spree. Thoughtful goes a lot further than
expensive. And don’t forget the note!

Gifts that give back to you
Food is always a fabulous gift, especially deliv-
ered into an office of overworked editors who are
often too busy for real lunch breaks. Feed them
and your career in one fell swoop, with the help of
these satiating recommendations. Remember:
Forsake the fruitcakes, and think fresh.
 The 
Manhattan 
Fruitier 
Company,
www.manhattanfruitier.com, has
an exotic fruit basket with fruits most
people can’t even pronounce. Thankfully, it
comes with a darling little booklet that
details each fruit’s finer points. It’s such the
perfect gift because no one’s allergic to it,
and the whole office can ooh and aah while
thumbing through the booklet trying to
figure out what place/planet the pepino and
carambola fruits are from. The company
ships all across the United States.
 Harry & David, www.harryanddavid.
com, is always a regal way to say thanks.
And its Royal Riviera Pears are the juiciest
things this side of juice.
 Organic 
Bouquet, 
www.organic
bouquet.com, offers gorgeous fresh
organic and green label flowers, gourmet
organic gift baskets, and fresh organic gift-
packed fruits. Prices are reasonable, espe-
cially considering that you’re showcasing
how socially and environmentally responsi-
ble you are.
 Ithaca Fine Chocolates, www.ithacafine
chocolates.com, luxuriously combines
fine art and exquisite chocolate by offering
gifts like Art Bars — delectable, organic, Fair
Trade chocolate bars that feature work by a
regional adult artist or an international child
artist on a collectible card inside the wrap-
per. Just imagine, you can support artists, art
education, and your freelance editing career
in a single sweet gift.

Taking Your Business to the Next Level
With your first job behind you, you may be ready to pump up the volume on
your freelancing career. In this section, I show you how to generate even
more work and, if you choose, become your own corporation.
Creating your own Web site
The days of only techies having Web sites are long gone. Now you can pro-
mote your services, your résumé, your portfolio — with no HTML experience
and no money spent. If you can point and click, you can design the Web site
you want. Peruse the many free hosting providers and blogging services until
you find the right one for your needs. Regardless of which service you use,
consider springing for the $10 annual fee for your own domain name
(suzyQproofreader.com), which can forward seamlessly to your free Web
site. Don’t forget your contact information!
Here are some prominent and proven free hosting providers:
 http://geocities.yahoo.com/
 www.free.prohosting.com
 www.50megs.com
Also, the URL is long, but so is this list of free providers within Yahoo’s direc-
tory. Take a deep breath, and type in dir.yahoo.com/Business_and_
Economy/Business_to_Business/Communications_and_Networking/
Internet_and_World_Wide_Web/Network_Service_Providers/Hosti
ng/Web_Site_Hosting/Free_Hosting/.
Another option is to use the free sites offered to you by blogging services. (A
blog is really just a Web site geared toward journal entries that can be easily
archived, searched, and commented on by interested readers.) Blogs are
super easy to set up and design — again, no HTML needed. And, in my
uncompensated opinion, these free providers are the best (even better than
many of their fee-charging competitors):
 www.wordpress.com
 www.blogger.com
 www.livejournal.com
309
Chapter 20: Keeping the Freelance Jobs Coming

One fee-charging Web site worth considering is www.publishersmarket
place.com. For $20 per month, you get a daily news feed about the publish-
ing industry and access to a fantastic Web site that offers tons of resources.
You can also advertise your services on the site and get help creating your
own Web site.
Stepping up your networking
The long-term benefits of networking are well worth the potentially delayed
gratification. This is your chance to be Johnny Appleseed, sowing your free-
lance credentials worldwide, patiently waiting for your business crop to grow.
Your eventual prize: unlimited harvest year-round.
And you never know: Sometimes networking can show immediate returns.
You meet someone who knows someone in need of a rush job, which you
complete with flying colors, and suddenly you’re the sole freelancer for Big
Rich Corporation.
Here are a few options for getting that fruitful network of yours underway:
 Editorial Freelancers Association: It touts itself as “the largest and
oldest national professional organization dedicated to supporting free-
lance career choices and opportunities.” You can join whether you’re a
full- or part-time freelancer, and whether or not you live in its hometown
of New York City. Dues vary depending on your location. See www.the-
efa.org for more information.
 Copyediting-L: This online community describes itself as “a list for copy
editors and other defenders of the English language who want to discuss
anything related to editing.” It’s got more than a couple thousand sub-
scribers who are part-time, full-time, any-time copyeditors. The sub-
scription is free and comes with the free option to add your service
profile to its directory of freelancers. For more information about this
community, see www.copyediting-l.info.
 Bay Area Editors’ Forum: This is a not-for-profit association of in-house
and freelance editors from all walks and all locales. Membership is open
to anyone with an active interest in editing. Annual dues are $40 and
include member service Web portfolios, promotion, discussion lists, and
additional support for us editorial types. See www.editorsforum.org
for more information.
 The Slot: “A Spot for Copy Editors” is the tagline of this community of
posting readers devoted to the ins and outs of the copyediting field. Bill
Walsh, the national desk copy chief at The Washington Post by night, is
the site’s writer by day. See www.theslot.com for more information.

Part V: Turning Your Skills into Paychecks 

Promoting yourself in other ways
You may want to promote yourself through posting a résumé on the same job
search Web sites you use to identify potential clients. Any client searching
http://hotjobs.yahoo.com/, www.careerbuilder.com, or www.
monster.com for your particular skills will be en route in no time. Added
bonus: Posting is free; all you have to do is register with a username and
password.
Don’t forget your keywords! Enter as many terms as you’re allowed, including
proofreader, copyeditor, editor, and publishing. When a prospective client
searches under these keywords, voilà! — your impeccable résumé will
appear.
And don’t forget to search the smaller but more specialized sites for posting
opportunities. For example, www.copyeditor.com allows freelancers to
post résumés and portfolios for free, and then it promotes job seekers to
publishers seeking freelance services.
Another idea is to join Web rings: hundreds and even thousands of Web sites
bound together based on kindred content. You can use search engines to find
and join ones that even indirectly reach your clients, looking beyond publish-
ers and magazines to communities that connect proofreaders and editors.
Start at www.webring.com; it has a searchable directory featuring such Web
rings as The Write Way Ring, which “wishes to bring together writers, authors
and publishers for the mutual benefits of networking and traffic-sharing. For
beginning writers, published authors, independent publishers, traditional
publishers, and literary professionals (editors, proofreaders, agents, and
ghostwriters) who wish to increase their client lists. Welcome aboard!”
Finally, within just about every blogger’s site, whether it’s written by some-
one in publishing, copyediting, or rock climbing, there are opportunities for
you to get noticed — and networked. Each post or journal entry made has a
tool that lets readers add comments, which in turn get read by all the same
readers. Making blog comments is a great way to introduce yourself and
bond with other people in your field. It’s also a way to embarrass yourself to
those same people, so be sure your comment is contextual and beneficial to
the topic at hand, as opposed to blatantly promotional. One of the most pop-
ular and insightful blogs in the copyediting world is Deanna Hoak’s at
http://deannahoak.com/.

Incorporating or creating an LLC
When your freelancing business really starts booming, you may want to con-
sider becoming a bona fide business. Depending on where you live, the cost
of incorporating through an online service can run between $70 and $600. Is
it worth the money? If the jobs are starting to come in, yes, because creating
a corporation not only saves you money in taxes; it can actually make a lot
more potential jobs come in and stay in. It legitimizes you in so many ways.
More credentials, more professionalism, more business.
Think about it: Instead of being a lone freelance copyeditor or proofreader,
you’re now the president of a company that provides freelance editing or
proofreading services. Plus, who can resist inventing her very own company
name?
There are many online incorporation companies, including www.bizfilings.
com — a friendly site that also provides its services through Yahoo as a
trusted partner. BizFilings has a great Q&A section, too.
A newer entity, the limited liability corporation (LLC), doesn’t require as
much formality as a corporation and has become very popular among small
businesses that want to incorporate. The site www.lectlaw.com defines an
LLC as “a business structure that is a hybrid of a partnership and a corpora-
tion. Its owners are shielded from personal liability and all profits and losses
pass directly to the owners without taxation of the entity itself.” The site also
notes an additional benefit: “You don’t need an attorney to set up an LLC.”
(In other words, it’s pretty easy.)
Whether you opt for becoming an LLC or a full corporation, you’ll reap the
following benefits:
 Averting a tax implication: As owner of a corporation, you’re lifted out
of the “self-employed/work from home” red flag that the IRS so often
scrutinizes. As a corporation, you file corporate returns instead of indi-
vidual tax returns, and you compete for the IRS’s attention alongside
showstoppers such as GE and Microsoft.
 Charging your expenses against the income flowing through your
business: When you incorporate or open an LLC, you qualify to open a
matching bank account in your company’s name. (Remember to have
your payments made out to your corporation or LLC name.) Next step:
Acquire a business credit card to save you the trouble of itemizing your
expenses. American Express is especially open to working with small
businesses.
312
Part V: Turning Your Skills into Paychecks 

Whether you’re incorporated or not, business meals can be tax deductible
when you’re a freelancer. So can business supplies, travel expenses, and any
other expenses that help support your freelance career. If you work from
home, you can calculate what percentage of your home is taken up by your
work space and deduct that percentage of all your utility bills. I strongly rec-
ommend making nice with a CPA or tax attorney at the start of your freelance
journey so you can take full advantage of all the tax savings you can get.
Benevolent Dictatorship: How 
to Be Your Own Boss

Being an effective boss, especially when you’re trying to manage yourself,
takes a mastery of the delicate balance between Good Boss and Bad Boss.
313
Chapter 20: Keeping the Freelance Jobs Coming
Is it time to go full-time?
As you further endear yourself to editors and
other clients, they may start keeping an eye out
for full-time positions for you at their places of
employment. If you get an offer, you may not
have much time to respond, so I recommend
that you periodically check in with yourself to
ask the question, “Would I rather be working
full-time?”
There may be lots of background factors, but on
center stage are Money and Time. If you’re not
yet earning in the upper echelons of freelance
pay rates or you aren’t yet securing a steady
flow of freelance work, you may want to go full-
time. After all, you get stable income, health
benefits, paid vacation and sick days, and prob-
ably a 401(k). But if you’ve got droves of satis-
fied repeat clients and are already getting
what’s jokingly referred to as “the friendship
rate” (a high rate due to your proven reliability
and track record, but also due to the fact that
you’ve been making the editor happy for a long
time), the freelance life may be too sweet to
trade in.
Your schedule, of course, is a key factor. Are
stability and benefits worth working rigid hours,
often more than 50 per week? Will you have
enough time for family commitments, creative
pursuits, and other business ventures?
I encourage you to make your decision meticu-
lously, as opposed to basing it on your mood on
a given day. That’s why considering the ques-
tion before a job offer arises can be so helpful.
And when you find yourself facing a great job
offer and uncertain about what to do, remem-
ber: It’s a happy problem to have!

Good boss: Taking care of yourself
Your Good Boss is the one who sets boundaries and recognizes that you’re
finite, and finite freelancers can’t work more than 24 hours in a day or 15
hours 20 days straight. Good Boss takes care of you by limiting the number of
projects you take on, the number of hours you work in a day, the number of
days you work in a row.
Thanks to Good Boss, you not only work more effectively and efficiently, you
also keep your sanity and your family intact. Workers are happiest when their
families see them often enough to recognize them.
Oh, and one other thing: Good Boss ain’t gonna let ya take on another project
from a company that hasn’t paid you for the last job. (See the sidebar “What
if the payment never arrives?” earlier in this chapter.)
Bad boss: Meeting the deadline, 
no matter what
Tough love is still love. Bad Boss knows what’s best and takes responsibility
for the difficult decision to skip today’s Steelers game — or even your daugh-
ter’s soccer game — if that’s what it’s going to take to finish your project on
time. Bad Boss closes the door to your home office, even when neighbors are
still visiting. Do you have to actually pull an all-nighter to meet your deadline
tomorrow? Do you really have to ask Bad Boss?
The key to a long and prosperous freelance career is listening to both of
those bosses in you. They’re both smart.
And right now they’re both saying you deserve another bon-bon for complet-
ing Chapter 20. Enjoy.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
E
very For Dummies book ends with top-ten gems, and
this book has the two Hope Diamonds: secrets to 
success as a copyeditor and secrets to success as a 
proofreader.

Chapter 21
Ten Keys to Success 
as a Copyeditor
In This Chapter
 Knowing your client or employer
 Giving the manuscript an initial review
 Respecting the author
 Getting the facts straight
A
s a copyeditor, you have power. You can shape up a dismal book and
make it reader-worthy or award-worthy. You can rearrange titles, para-
graphs, and sometimes entire chapters. You can rewrite whatever you want!
You can ignite your lightsaber and . . .
Whoa, young Padawan. Before reveling in the power that your pen (or key-
board) wields, let’s jump back and examine, with a cool head, how a copyedi-
tor creates and maintains that fine balance between running an absolute
copyeditor monarchy and kowtowing to the creative team.
Figure Out Your Employer or Client
Occasionally you’ll have an opportunity to get to know the author of a pro-
ject you’re working on. More likely, though, she’ll remain simply a name on
the title page.
Whom do you have the chance to know? Your editor, or whoever else is man-
aging the project. You have an obligation to know this person, whether you’re
a permanent member of his staff or a freelancer accepting your first assign-
ment from him. Pay attention to his instructions, his preferences, his pet
peeves, even his editorial weaknesses so you can jump in and do a slam-bang
copyedit that makes him look good. If he looks good to his higher-ups, you
will look very good to him.

If you’re a staff copyeditor, you should have lots of opportunities to get to
know the people managing your projects. Pay close attention at staff meet-
ings, ask coworkers for insights, and read every e-mail or memo that comes
your way so you’re aware of changes to policies, procedures, or house style.
As a freelancer, you may not have much personal contact with your clients.
You may get an occasional phone call, but even that’s not a guarantee; some
clients communicate solely through e-mail. How do you figure out what a
client wants when your access to this person is so limited? When you receive
a project, you usually receive a cover letter or e-mail that details concerns
specific to the project. This document contains clues that will help you figure
out your client’s needs.
Read the cover letter or e-mail word for word. Sometimes you won’t even
understand a given direction until you’re immersed in the manuscript, so keep
the cover letter or e-mail in full view as you proceed through the copyedit.
The cover letter may note modifications that cropped up recently in the edi-
torial process. (For example, “Please note that the protagonist’s sister is
named Melvina, not Melinda” or “Remove ‘www.’ from URLs that work with-
out it.”) Obviously, you want to keep your eyes peeled for those issues; your
client expects you to locate and correct every instance.
Here’s why this cover letter business is so crucial: I once received a job from
my publisher that had a tight deadline. I began working on it, got a few pages
in, and noticed that sometimes the author used a serial comma and some-
times not. I decided to implement the serial comma and began adding caret
and comma wherever I found one missing. Before long, I had a bloodbath on
my hands. I became obsessed with these commas, and when I got to the end
of the manuscript, I was confident that I hadn’t missed a single one.
While packaging the book for shipment, I happened to glance at the cover
letter. There, in the third paragraph, were these words: Please note that per
author request, serial comma should remain inconsistent. You may notice that it
is attached to some characters’ voices and not others.
I looked at the red ink dripping from the pages and had to sit down to absorb
the valuable lesson.
Meet the Deadline Every Time
Before you start a project, make sure you’re clear about its deadline, and
make sure you can meet it. If you have any doubts, say so up front. As a
staffer, that may mean you need to ask whether another project on your plate
can be given to someone else so you can focus on meeting this deadline. Or it
318
Part VI: The Part of Tens

may even mean that you need to ask for this project to be divided between
you and another copyeditor. Communicate your concerns clearly to the
person managing your time or the project in question, and be willing to work
with whatever solutions are offered.
As a freelancer, the solution is pretty simple: If you have doubts about
whether you can meet a deadline, don’t accept the project. Better to turn
down a project, even for a new client, than fail to deliver it on time.
Your employer or client may say something like “Ideally, I would like this pro-
ject back on my desk Friday, August 7th, but you can take until Monday the
10th if need be.” When should you return the project? On the 7th. Always hit
the ideal date instead of the last-minute one.
And be sure to acknowledge your speediness (in your return cover letter, if
you’re a freelancer): “I wanted to get this project back to you before your
requested deadline so that you could really take your time reviewing it.” A
copyeditor who makes deadlines gets a big thumbs-up (and a freelancer gets
repeat business).
Review the Manuscript 
Before You Start Editing
When Ikea recently delivered an entertainment center to me, I panicked. This
was because when my husband and I put together our Ikea bed a month ear-
lier, our happy-go-lucky puttering and tinkering almost turned into a full-
blown hex-key fight. I can’t remember exactly what went wrong, but let’s just
say that mistakes were made. I was as close as I’ve ever been to sleeping in
the kitchen. So this time, I called my upstairs neighbor, Matthew, for assistance.
The first thing he did amazed me. He found the directions and read them
from start to finish. This meant that he knew in advance how the initial steps
would tie into the later steps. After that, putting everything together was a
breeze. And the most shocking part was that we didn’t have any widgets left
over (except the hex-key).
Going through a manuscript is no different. Page through initially, and you are
likely to find any leftover widgets . . . before you begin to build your style sheet
or make executive decisions about grammatical and syntactical inconsistencies.
Getting your hands on a raw manuscript for the first time can be a heady sen-
sation, but take my advice: Don’t plunge into the reading immediately. Put
down your pencil, or push back from the keyboard, and spend some time get-
ting your bearings. Go through the front matter — everything that precedes
the text — for an introduction to the project. Opening sections, such as a
319
Chapter 21: Ten Keys to Success as a Copyeditor

preface written by the author, a foreword written by someone else, or even a
dedication page, can furnish info as to intent, style, and general condition of
the manuscript. Take care of preliminaries; for example, perhaps you need to
paginate (or repaginate) at the outset. Then skim the text for an overview of
content and a sense of author voice. Do all this before you begin a page-by-
page read, and your projects will turn out even better than Ikea’s floor
models.
Respect the Author (Even 
When You Don’t)
Have you any idea what percentage of submitted book manuscripts get
accepted for publication? It’s a minuscule number, with lots of zeroes after
the decimal point. When a publishing house sees enough merit and/or mar-
ketability in a particular stack of loose sheets to want to convert them into a
bound book, you have to give credit where credit is due — to the person who
wrote it. The same is true if you’re working on a magazine article, a Web site,
a corporation’s annual report . . . someone with more authority than you
trusted this writer to create something workable. You’ve got to respect that
decision.
Okay, so the author is ignorant, self-satisfied, boring, condescending, trite,
and a laundry list of other negatives, in your opinion. The point is, it’s your
opinion. Never assume that your employer or client agrees with your assess-
ment, and keep your opinion to yourself even if he does.
Although your project may be your baby, don’t get too attached. The author’s
voice and opinions trump yours. If the author sends his protagonist to the
“theatre,” that’s his choice. You can suggest sending her to the “theater”
instead, but don’t stress if the author says no.
If you want to get attached to something, turn your focus to making your
author happy and fulfilled. Then you’ll be happy too because your employer
or client will have fewer author issues to resolve. As a staffer, this approach
will help you earn trust and, perhaps, receive better and better assignments.
As a freelancer, this approach will help ensure that the client — and maybe
even the author himself — will have more work for you in the future. Just
remember who’s signing your paycheck.

Look It Up
Running spell-check is one way to start rooting out errors in a document, but
don’t swear by it — not when the English language is a strange amalgam of
homonyms and inconsistencies. Just because a conglomeration of letters
forms a bona fide word doesn’t mean it’s the word you want. For example, I
can type the word miniscule, and my spell-check program won’t notice that
it’s misspelled. That’s because it’s an alternate spelling of minuscule, which is
what Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary, 11th Edition (Web 11) prefers.
If you have an iota of doubt about anything you read, look it up. Don’t be 
intimated by an apparently erudite, meticulous author; everybody can and
does make mistakes — that’s why you have a job. The more careful the author,
the more grateful she’ll be for any corrections or improvements you make.
If you haven’t already read it, turn to Chapter 5 for suggestions on how to
fact-check any document.
Google It
When I wrote my first book report (on Betamax versus VHS), I had to go to
the library. The librarian looked into a daunting cabinet of cards, and then
she handed me a scrap of paper. I had to decipher the Dewey Decimal System
and find the book on a shelf too high for me to reach.
Nowadays, if an author has not provided adequate info on a given item —
enough to clarify the text and satisfy the reader — I can ask for help from
Google (or Yahoo or any other Internet search engine).
Google is a goody of a search engine. If you’re in the mood for some fun, type
into the search box whatever you’re looking for, then hit the “I’m feeling lucky”
button on the bottom right. You can have hours of fun at www.google.com.
Even Google can’t cure every manuscript ill. If you need clarification and
don’t feel confident suggesting changes that provide it, go back to the source:
the author. Write a query that clearly states the problem. Sometimes the
author knows the topic so well that he simply forgets to include a vital fact;
other times he may need to rewrite.
321
Chapter 21: Ten Keys to Success as a Copyeditor

Write It Down, Write It All Down
Remember the advice of your favorite teachers back in school: take good
notes. As you read through a manuscript, take notes on what you come
across. The longer the document you’re working on, the more vital these
notes are so you can ensure consistency throughout.
For instance, if the author starts out using serial commas, make a note of it.
If she abbreviates state names, make a note of it. If you read that a character’s
wedding ring “tapped against her pencil” as she wrote a goodbye note, jot down
that she’s probably left-handed. And keep an eye out for dialects in dialogue.
(I don’t know why, but sometimes authors switch them up mid-manuscript.)
These notes can be huge time-savers, and ultimately, you give many of them
to the editor or other person managing the project in the form of a style
sheet (see Chapter 14). Or, if you have conflicting notes, they form the basis
of queries to the editor or author.
Proofread Your Own Work
You’re telling me I need to do one more read-through? Awww . . . Well, read this.
There’s a big wedding in the family. Within the elegant invitation mailing will
be a card perfectly worded to direct guests to the ceremony and reception.
The mother of the bride creates the card and proofs it before printing. When
she picks it up, the very first heading jumps out at her: To the Congregrational
Church. Granted, it’s a small, ornate font where the letters seem to meld into
each other, but still, how on earth did that extra “r” sneak its way in?
True story. And here’s the kicker: This was no ordinary civilian mom but a
seasoned copyeditor. So what happened? Enmeshed in her topic, she read
not the words but the intent.
Moral 1: Read what they write, not what they mean.
Moral 2: Do one more read-through.
Moral 3: Work on manuscripts you’re not emotionally involved with.
322
Part VI: The Part of Tens

So when Great Aunt Clara is getting her memoirs published and insists that
you copyedit them, resist! Surgeons don’t operate on their own family mem-
bers, and even the most skilled authors need objective copyeditors.
(P.S. Happy ending: The printer redid the direction cards at minimal cost. Had
it been a book, we know whose head would be rolling on the carpet.)
Even though there may be a whole chain of checks and rechecks on the con-
veyor belt to publication, don’t assume the next person in line will catch
what you miss. Act as if you are the final checkpoint before publication, and
you will be a great copyeditor.
Read (and Then Read Some More)
Read everything that crosses your line of vision — from the daily papers to
billboards to television ads to incoming mail. If you’re a file-it person, start a
folder of items that range from the scholarly to the everyday. Were you taken
with a turn of phrase — concise yet charming — in a friend’s thank-you note?
Save it, to inspire you in those instances when a line of text needs gentle doc-
toring. Above all, have a love affair with the English language. It’s the most
incorrigible, incredible, and incisive language out there. A good dictionary —
like Web 11 — is the ultimate page-turner, juicy as any mystery. Prove it to
yourself: Pick a page, any page, and start reading. You’ll be amazed at how
much you learn.
Begin to carry reading materials around with you. Lightweight paperbacks
are perfect for perusing in your doctors’ and dentists’ waiting rooms. If your
back is suffering under the weight of your messenger bag and you have
access to a photocopier, copy a chapter of your latest summer thriller, and
stash it in your pocket.
Do you take public transportation to work? If so, you’re in for some wicked
fun. I don’t know why this is, but the people who put advertisements on
buses and subways don’t seem to pay the slightest attention to spelling or
punctuation. Challenge yourself to find an error in each ad. Believe me, this is
a game where you can rack up some points. Give yourself bonus points for
misused quotation mark’s “or” apostrophes. (For fantastic examples of mis-
used quotation marks, go to www.juvalamu.com/qmarks/.)

Stay on Top of Changes 
in Your Profession
The copyediting world is changing quickly, and we wordsmiths have to zip to
keep up. As I explain in Chapter 17, copyeditors don’t often work on hard
copy anymore; electronic editing is the norm. If you want to work at home,
that means you accept responsibility for maintaining your computer. (If your
operating system is Windows 98, you’ve got some updating to do!) And make
sure your skills keep pace with the technology of the field; that means you
may want to take courses on editing in PDFs or on the desktop publishing
applications Quark or Adobe InDesign, both used by a lot of magazines. If
you’re drawn to Web editing, you may also want to know some HTML. You
may be able to get by without it, but having that knowledge definitely
increases your value.
Changes in the profession aren’t always related to technology, though.
Believe it or not, new editions of style guides often feature significant
changes. Be sure to check out the latest edition of your preferred style guide
and hunt for the amendments.
And finally, make a concerted effort to be a part of the copyediting commu-
nity. It’s pretty easy to do so these days, thanks to the Copyediting-L Listserv
(Google it, then join it) and some great Web sites devoted to copyediting
such as www.copydesk.org, run by the American Copy Editors Society, and
the subscription newsletter Copy Editor available at www.copyeditor.com.
Checking a favorite copyediting Web site periodically can help ensure that
you’re in the know when new work processes and technologies emerge.

Ten Keys to Success 
as a Proofreader
In This Chapter
 Perfecting your proofread
 Poring over the ToC, running elements, and graphics
 Broadening your brain
 Beating deadlines
I
t may be difficult to imagine that the writer of that hot new best-seller
could require the services of a proofreader like you. But rest assured that
authors are not infallible, and the runaway success you see on the shelf at
your local bookstore is flourishing in large part due to the work of behind-
the-scenes proofreaders and editors.
If you want to be on the top of the list to get proofreading jobs that are future
best-sellers (or the cream of whatever crop of writing you fancy), here are ten
tips to up your game.
Know That Once Is Not Enough
Well, okay, sometimes it is. Especially after you’ve been proofing a while.
But if you’re looking to be a Halle Berry or George Clooney — you know, a
superstar — you want to work it a bit. They say a good actor approaches a
role the way you peel an onion: a layer at a time. Likewise, a proofreading
project sometimes needs to be looked at again and again — peeled and
repealed, if you will. Oops! I mean re-peeled. But you knew that.
The first pass or read-through of the material is somewhat superficial; you
just want to correct obvious errors and get a broad sense of the concepts.
Then, when you take your second pass, you gain deeper comprehension and
familiarity with the material. You may need a third pass to reach the core.

By taking a quick superficial pass, you gain familiarity with the subject matter
or storyline, the writing style, and any peculiarities of usage particular to the
author. On the next pass, you’re sure to catch a high percentage of errors.
Familiarity with the document makes the process so much easier because
after you know the author, you can proactively proofread — intuiting where
problem areas will arise.
Proofreading has been around for centuries — since the first monk printed
that weighty tome. I’m sure the first proofreader’s job was tough because no
one had ever edited a book before. He was finding errors for the first time.
But guess what? The errors have all been found. There is no little man sitting in
the corner inventing new ones. If you’ve seen one transposition of from/form,
you’ve seen ’em all.
So, the good news is that although authors do make mistakes, there are a
finite number of them. Also, you can usually notice a pattern of mistakes; it
emerges quickly if you’re paying close attention. After you identify the
author’s unique pattern of usage errors, you’re over the first set of hurdles.
You can bet your paycheck that the same errors will reappear time and again
throughout the text.
Jot down brief notations — for your own purposes — of any usage patterns
you notice as you make your way through the text. Review your list before
each pass to remind yourself of the most common and habitual errors. This
list also comes in handy if you are working on an electronic version of the
manuscript: You can cross-check your proofreading accuracy using the
incredible global Find function (see Chapter 17).
Hold on to this list when you’re done with the project, too. If you’re lucky
enough to proofread for the same author again, it can reduce the time you
spend on that next document.
Give the ToC Some TLC
The table of contents is just a bunch of short lines listing chapter or section
headings and their corresponding page numbers. Compiling a ToC must
be pretty easy, right? What could possibly go wrong? Well, now that you 
mention it . . .
The ToC is very important but frequently overlooked. Especially if you’re
working on an educational text, you want to give this section a thorough
proofread. Even if your document is not overly complex, a well-reviewed
ToC will help you stand out from the proofreader pack.
326
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Certainly, the ToC is easy to proof. It’s a flip job: Look at the ToC. Look at
Chapter 1. Check the title. Check the page number. Look at the ToC. Look
at Chapter 2. Rinse. Repeat.
But ToCs can be more complex depending on the type of project. Other ele-
ments, such as illustrations or maps, may be included in the ToC, and you
need to note whether all levels of subheadings are included or only the top
tier or two.
In magazines, proofing the ToC can get a little hairy. It’s got to be done at the
last minute, and the layout usually distinguishes between departments, fea-
tures, and “other stuff.” You have to be sure that each item in the magazine is
accounted for in the right section.
In titles and headings, pay attention to the little words. The treatment of articles
and prepositions should be consistent — same spelling and same case as per
the publisher’s style guidelines. You’d be surprised how big a deal the prepo-
sitions about and because of can be in the realm of the ToC. Prepositions of
five letters or more are sometimes capitalized and sometimes lowercased
in titles and headings. Just be sure that what you’re seeing is consistent
throughout the project.
Speaking of titles, don’t forget the kingpin and queen bee of them all: the title
of the book, article, or project itself. Suppose you’re proofing a book with the
title Ring Around the Rosie and the subtitle Just Between Us Girls. If “around,”
“between,” or any other prepositions of comparable length or longer are 
capitalized in the book title, they must also be capitalized if they appear
in chapter titles or headings in the text.
Don’t Forget the Headings
This one takes a little practice and a discerning eye for typeface and size to
master. In addition to checking headings and subheadings for the accuracy of
grammar and spelling, you also check them for formatting uniformity.
Your editor should give you specific guidelines on typeface and size to use as
a reference. If you are doing an electronic edit, checking these is a fairly
straightforward process. If your eyes aren’t certain if a heading is correctly
formatted, you can click your cursor on the words of the header and look to
see what the user-friendly toolbar at the top tells you about the font and size.
If you are working from a hard copy manuscript, you can manually compare
the latest header to ones on previous pages (assuming those previous ones
are correct).
327
Chapter 22: Ten Keys to Success as a Proofreader

If you make any changes to chapter headings other than formatting correc-
tions, those changes need to be reflected in the ToC. You always want the
ToC to match exactly how the headings appear in the document itself.
Don’t Forget the Running 
Heads and Feet, Either
The term running heads refers to text that appears in the space at the very
top of the page. Running heads typically include the title of a book, chapter,
article, annual report . . . whatever type of document you’re working on. The
term feet refers to text placed in the space below the last line of body text on
each page.
Each publisher and organization has a particular style, so you have to find
out what information should appear in the running heads or feet of your par-
ticular document. If you’re working on a book, you’ll probably find that the
book title is placed on the left side and either the chapter title or the author’s
name appears on the right side.
Some documents include the page numbers in the header, and some put
them in the feet. Make sure the pages are numbered consecutively, that the
numbers appear in the exact same spot on every page, and that the typeface
and size are uniform. Also, pay close attention to the numbering system for any
introductory pages, glossary pages, and appendix pages. You may find that you
need to bone up on Roman numerals for some of these elements. In the event
that you find errors in the numbering of the pages, update your ToC.
Give the heads and feet a thorough proof. Seasoned proofreaders and editors
will tell you that errors are often missed in these little elements. As painful as
it may be to read the same line again and again, you must do so to ensure
that each head appears correctly.
This part of the proofread is a lot easier on an electronic edit. But be careful
not to become overly reliant on the software’s (or typist’s) accuracy. Even in
this digital age, information can still be omitted, reversed, or inserted in the
wrong place.
Look Out for Graphics
Not to worry, this section is not rated R. I’m talking graphs and images here,
not graphic images.
328
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

The first thing you look for is proper layout of the graphic elements. If graph-
ics appear in the body of the text you’re proofreading, you want to ensure
that the text wraps around the image in an aesthetically pleasing way.
Obviously, images should not overlap with text and vice versa, unless that’s
the deliberate style (as we see in some magazines).
Graphics and images usually need captions. The house style of the publisher or
other organization you’re working for should indicate whether captions are
required and how they are formatted. In the captions of group pictures, people
are usually named left to right, bottom row to top. If house style doesn’t call for
captions, a description of the image needs to appear in the body of the text.
If you don’t understand the relevance of a graphic or picture, flag it. Chances
are that if the graphic is left as is, the reader will be just as baffled as you are.
Sometimes graphics are numbered; for example, within a chapter, the author
may refer to Image 1.1, 1.2, and so on. Make sure that this reference number
also appears with the actual image. Plus, cross-check the order of the refer-
ences to confirm that each number is placed with the correct image.
Here’s a crucial thing to know: Many photographic images are copyrighted.
This means that images should never just be copied from a Web site and
reprinted somewhere else. At the very minimum, there needs to be a credit
somewhere that identifies the photographer or copyright holder. With news
photography, it is typical to credit both the photographer and the news
agency. If the photo is a picture of artwork, often the museum that owns the
art is credited. As proofreader, you don’t need to know the finer details. Just
be on the lookout for graphics and pictures that don’t seem to be credited
anywhere in the book.
If you have any doubts whether the author has sought permission for the
reprint of an image, voice those doubts to the editor. The improper use of
copyrighted material, or even incorrect notation of a credit, can lead to legal
trouble. No point in chancing that.
Keep It Neat
We all know how important first impressions are. If you work on hard copy,
one of the first things the editor sees on the manuscript is your proofreading
marks. You don’t want all those conscientious hours spent proofreading to go
unnoticed over something as easy to manage as neatness, right? If your
markup is sloppy (or worse, unintelligible), it reflects badly on your abilities
as a proofreader and hurts your chances of being hired again. Take the time
to draw those proofreading marks correctly and legibly. Your extra effort will
go far to show the editor what an organized, detailed, and conscientious
proofreader you are.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
I was a grubby kid, so how did I get so neat?
It makes no difference to me how long you go
before cleaning your bathtub. I don’t care how
many pairs of underwear you have hanging
from the TV. Just remember that in editing, neat-
ness counts.
In my personal life, there’s little I hate more than
tackling dishes after a relaxing meal. But when
I proofread and copyedit, I’m a neat girl. And my
editors appreciate it. Here’s how I do it.
I keep my workspace clean. While it’s not like a
shrine or anything, it is an area that contains
only my proofreading. I find that if my table or
desk is clean, my project stays clean. Even if I’m
using the kitchen table, I clear it of sharp knives,
avocado rinds, and stray children before setting
out my work.
I work with sharp implements. (They also come
in handy if someone comes in to bother me
while I’m reading a salacious scene.) I use a
finely sharpened pencil with an eraser that
doesn’t leave tracks. When writing, I make dis-
tinct, non-smearable marks. (Here’s where elec-
tronic projects have the edge: When I’m editing
an electronic document, the lousiest handwrit-
ing in the world means nothing — no one will
see it.)
I don’t write anything in indelible ink. I’ve made
my share of mistakes. Even when I notice the
mistake mere seconds after making it, with per-
manent ink it’s too late to do anything but write
“stet.”
I bask in fantastic lighting. And — since this isn’t
a dress rehearsal but the real deal — so should
you. Lighting is key for me. The better my light-
ing, the less tired I get, and the more likely
errors pop out at me. I use a strong overhead
light for hard-copy editing, as well as a direc-
tional lamp that I can pull very close to the page.
But I have known many a well-placed floor lamp
that can do the trick. Glare-minimizing soft light-
ing works well for electronic editing.
I tend not to bleed on the projects. Nor do I spill
pie filling on them. On the rare occasion that I
eat and read, I make sure it’s white, dry food —
like paint chips.
I don’t let people smoke near my work (or my
kids). Paper absorbs the odor of cigarettes. I
know a production editor who had to take some
pages home and air them out on her deck before
being able to read them. Needless to say, she
was not amused. No one came out ahead —
except Big Tobacco. Certainly not the freelancer,
who was never called again.
Basically, I keep the project in the condition in
which I received it. I don’t re-collate it, staple it,
paper-clip it, or make colorful magic marker
exclamations on it.
Keep your projects neat in whatever way works
for you. But keep them neat.
Never write anything critical of an author unless
you are absolutely, completely positive she will
not see it. Even stickies sent to your editor could
find themselves in the hands of a very angry and
insulted writer. (Believe you me, these folks are
sensitive.) The rare suggestion on content, if
you must make it, should be jotted briefly and
tactfully on a sticky note affixed to the page. (Of
course, if a sentence on page 32 is repeated on
page 107, the editor needs to know this.)

Don’t think that you are off the hook for neatness just because you happen to
be working on an electronic document. While you won’t have to worry about
writing legibly, the same concept holds true. Put some thought and strategy
into your electronic edits. They should be clear and easy to follow. If the
pages start to look more like a Jackson Pollock work than a manuscript, you
may have a problem getting your point across to the editor. Comments need
to be concise, comprehensible, and, most of all, tactful (see Chapter 17).
Mind Your PEs (and AAs)
In addition to finding errors, in the book publishing world you also get to
assign blame to the error-missers! Blame is assigned in the form of PEs
(printer’s errors) or AAs (author’s alterations). You may also come across the
term EAs, which stands for editor’s alteration or editorial adjustment, but AAs
is generally used to indicate any change that the printer can charge the pub-
lisher for (because it wasn’t the printer’s error).
When you proofread against dead copy, the errors that you find that were
missed or introduced by the compositor (or typesetter) are PEs — printer’s
errors. We love PEs because no one on “our side” needs to pay for them.
When you find errors that were missed by the copyeditor, production editor,
or author, you mark those as AAs. These AAs cost the publisher — sometimes
a dollar or more per correction. So there’s a bittersweet feeling accompany-
ing the AA: First, “Yes! My eyes were sharper than all the pros who came
before me!” and then, “Aw. The people who hired me need to pay to fix this.”
As the editorial process becomes more and more electronic, PEs and AAs will
become less of an issue. For example, proofreaders of For Dummies books do
their work on-screen only, so corrections are made before a manuscript is
even sent to a printer.
In the land of magazines, PEs and AAs rarely apply.
Never Reedit
Let’s say a document you’re proofreading has several sentences ending in not
one, not three, but a series of eight exclamation points. You and I both know
that’s not necessary, and you may be tempted to cross out anything above
three. There’s a proofreader out there — a very good one, in fact — who did
just that and was crossed off the publisher’s freelance list for keeps. Moral:
Resist temptation!!!
331
Chapter 22: Ten Keys to Success as a Proofreader

Your corrections and queries are not your soap box, your podium, your plat-
form, or your best friend Jane. Use them cautiously, and don’t vent or other-
wise dramatize whatever dire mistake you feel the author has made.
You can be sure that the author has run his work by more than a few other
readers, and that he currently values it and will vehemently defend it if
attacked. Instead of going into battle over something you’re uncomfortable
seeing in print, opt instead for a polite query to your editor on a sticky note
or in an electronic comment box — either of which can be removed before
the document reaches the author.
Make your queries polite for two reasons: Every once in a while, a sticky note
or electronic comment isn’t removed en route to an author; and you don’t
know your editor’s relationship to the author. Make humble suggestions and
requests instead of incensed demands or gloating error catches.
Read (And Then, Read Some More)
When not working on a proofreading project, keep those special skills you
honed sharp by reading everything within your sight. At home? Read the
newspaper, cookbooks, coupons, and so on. In your car? Read billboards,
bumper stickers, whatever. Create fun games for yourself like seeing how
many grammatical errors or misspellings you can catch each day, or keep a
tally of which local restaurant has the most typos on its menu. Who knows,
maybe you can get a part-time gig as its preferred menu proofreader!
Dig the Deadline
Repeat after me: The deadline is key. I’ve heard stories of second-rate 
proofreaders who get more work than first-rate ones simply because the
second-raters always meet their deadlines.
The deadline is there for a reason: Whatever you’re working on must move to
the next level of production in order to get published on time. So treat your
deadline with the utmost responsibility and respect.
Here’s how I like to work the deadline: I act as if the project is due 24 hours
before its deadline, so that even if I’m running a bit behind, my behind is not
on the line. Save your behind: Make your deadline.

Part VII: Appendixes

Appendix B
Glossary
Acquisitions editor: The person who is responsible for finding and buying a
publishable book manuscript.
All caps: The use of all capital letters, for example in a title.
Alley: The space between columns of type on a page.
Author’s alteration (AA): An author’s change or other alteration to laid-out
text that is not a printer’s error (PE).
Backbone: The bound edge of a magazine or a book.
Back of (the) book (BoB): The back pages of a magazine that contain follow-
up information (like “where to buy it” or story credits), and often some
columns and departments. Also used for books, but back matter is more
common.
Back matter: The back pages of a book that contain supplemental information
such as endnotes, appendixes, indexes — even ads for the author’s next book.
Bad break (BB): An incorrectly hyphenated word at the end of a typeset line.
Blow-in cards: Those “subscribe now” or “smell me” cards literally blown
between the pages of a bound magazine. (If they’re bound into the magazine,
they’re called “bind-in cards.”)
Bluelines: Also referred to as “blues,” these are proofs of the final book or
magazine that are printed, folded, and bound. Bluelines represent the editor’s
last chance to catch any errors before the presses start rolling. (Blues can
actually be more than one color, or not blue at all; they are a cheaper way of
checking layout and type issues than paying for full-color proofs.)
Bound book: The finished product, ready to be sold.
Callout: A few sentences pulled from an article, blown up, and placed promi-
nently on the page to break up copy; intended to “call out” the reader’s atten-
tion and entice further reading.
Camera-ready: A term you will still hear used instead of print-ready to
describe files that have gone through final approval for printing, even when
the process is entirely digital.

Caps: Short for “capital letters.” Used in the terms all caps, initial caps, and
small caps.
Center spread: An article, image, or ad that covers the two center pages of a
magazine or newsletter.
CMYK: The abbreviation for the colors used in four-color process printing:
Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Key color (which is black).
Cold read: The process of reading a piece of copy straight through, with
nothing to compare it against.
Column inch: A measurement of space for copy that is one column wide and
one inch deep.
Column read: Copy that is set one column wide and one inch deep.
Comparison read: The process of comparing two pieces of copy to ensure
that they are identical; also called slugging.
Compositor: A person who converts electronic manuscript files into page
proofs that conform to the design specs; also known as a typesetter.
Content: Anything within a magazine that is not advertising.
Continuity: The overall logic and consistency of a story’s internal world.
Copy: The actual words of a manuscript, article, caption, and so on.
Coverlines: Sometimes referred to as “cutlines,” short lines of copy placed
on the cover of a publication to tempt potential buyers.
CQ: Scribbled next to a word, it’s magazine talk for “This word is spelled cor-
rectly, capiche?”
Dead copy: The edited version of the original manuscript, with the correc-
tions implemented, that is compared against the first typeset proofs.
Deck: The short text under an article title and before the lead paragraph that
is meant to get the reader interested in the story.
Department: A regular feature of a magazine such as letters, beauty, health,
and so on.
Designer: The person responsible for the physical appearance of a book or
other publication, including layout and graphics.
Editorial inventory: A magazine’s reserve of unpublished articles for possi-
ble future use.
340
Part VII: Appendixes

F&Gs: A set of galleys that may be sent to the production editor after a book is
fully printed and before it is bound, to make sure no major errors have crept
in. (The term F&G — “folded and gathered” — is from the days when books
were all printed on large sheets of paper, then folded and cut to size; these
days, many sheet-fed printers cut the paper beforehand.)
Fact-checker: A person who confirms the accuracy of the information pre-
sented in a book or magazine, and brings any inconsistency or error to the
author’s attention.
Filler: A short article or editorial used to fill blank space.
First pass: The first set of page proofs that are proofread against the dead
copy. These are nearly always in separate sheets, often blown up for easier
markup.
Fixed elements: Elements within a magazine whose positions remain con-
stant from issue to issue, including the magazine title and editorial page. This
term is also used for books (for the placement of the copyright page, for
example, or for elements that remain the same across a series of books).
Foul manuscript: A dead copy, or the proof pages of a previous pass that are
no longer used because an updated, corrected set of proofs has been pro-
duced. Often called “foul matter” or “the fouls.”
Four-color process: The process used to produce the full range of CMYK for a
full-color image appearance.
Front of (the) book (FoB): The beginning pages of a magazine, usually includ-
ing editorials, the masthead, and some departments and columns. Also used
for books, but front matter is more common.
Front matter: The beginning pages of a book that include the title page, copy-
right page, acknowledgements, table of contents, and other introductory
material that is not part of the main text.
Galleys: In book publishing, another term for a set of page proofs, often
reserved for the first set of proofs that is oversized for easier editing. In mag-
azine publishing, galleys are produced of the text only, for review before the
final page makeup.
Gatefold: A fold-out advertisement or article printed on a larger piece of
paper and folded to the size of the magazine.
Graf: Short for “paragraph.”
Head: Short for “headline.” Also used for magazine article titles. In books, it
means a break in the manuscript that is treated differently type- and design-
wise to indicate a new section.
341
Appendix B: Glossary

Imprint: A set (or line) of books that usually share a common look and feel
(or brand) and are marketed to the same segments of the population.
Initial caps: The use of a capital letter to begin each significant word, follow-
ing a particular style’s guidelines for headlines, titles, and so on.
Kerning: The amount of space between characters on a line, which can be
adjusted to make a line or word look better.
Leading: The white space between lines on a typeset page.
Lead time: The time it takes from planning a publication to getting it on the
newsstand.
Lede: An insiders’ spelling of “lead” — the introductory paragraph of an arti-
cle that is meant to lead the reader further into the story.
Manuscript: A book in loose pages or an electronic file submitted to a pub-
lishing house for evaluation and/or publication.
Masthead: The section of a periodical that details the publication’s owner-
ship and staff members, as well as contact information.
Orphan: A single word or piece of a word on its own line at the end of a laid-
out paragraph, or the first line of a paragraph on its own at the bottom of a
column or page.
Out of house: A term applied to any work that takes place outside of the pub-
lishing offices.
Page proofs: A set of pages that are composed according to the design specs
for review to ensure that the type is correctly set and that art and other dis-
play elements are correctly placed. Page proofs are produced for each new
pass after corrections are implemented. Also called galleys or typeset pages.
Perfect binding: A binding method for magazines and paperback books in
which the folded and gathered signatures are cut and then glued to a cover.
This binding is convenient for inserts but doesn’t allow the text to lie open
flat and is more expensive than saddle stitching.
Printer’s error (PE): An error made by the typesetter or printer in production.
Print-ready: Used to describe electronic files that have final approval for
printing. In the case of a book, there are often separate files for the jacket, the
cover, and the composed pages. Compare camera-ready.
Print run: The number of copies of a publication that are to be printed.
Production editor: A person at a book publisher who coordinates all the
steps in the publishing process after the editor transmits the manuscript,
from copyediting to bound books.
342
Part VII: Appendixes

Production manager: A person at a book publisher who assigns projects to
the production editor and deals with printers and manufacturing costs. At a
magazine, the production manager is responsible for relationships with out-
side vendors involved in the manufacturing process, such as printers, com-
positors, and ad agencies.
Proof: A sample of typeset and/or laid-out material that is checked against an
original or earlier version. Proofs are made of typeset manuscripts, laid-out
pages, book jackets, blow-in cards — whatever needs to be printed.
Proofreader’s marks: Shorthand symbols used to indicate alterations or cor-
rections in the copy. The symbols are standard throughout the U.S. printing
industry (see Chapter 9).
Query: A question concerning the copy by the copyeditor or proofreader to
the editor, author, or typesetter.
Roman: The standard unformatted typeface for the document, which can be
either serif or sans serif. (This term is also often used to describe serif type.)
Run in: To set type with no paragraph breaks or to insert new copy without
creating a new paragraph.
Running head: A book title or chapter head repeated at the top of every page
in a book.
Saddle stitching: A binding method often used for smaller magazines,
newsletters, and pamphlets, in which gathered sheets are stapled or stitched
through the fold.
Sans serif: A font like Arial that literally has no serifs — those little lines that
cross the strokes that make letters and numbers.
Second pass: The second version of page proofs from a manuscript, with
implemented corrections from the first pass.
Serif: A font like Times New Roman that has little lines (serifs) that cross the
ends of the strokes that make letters and numbers.
Side stitching: A binding method used especially for hardcover books in
which signatures are stacked and then stitched through the side, near the
spine, before the case is attached.
Slugging: Reading the galleys against the original manuscript, looking for
errors either by the typesetter or the copyeditor.
Slush pile: A backlog of manuscripts sent to a book publisher that have
not yet been evaluated by an editor. These are usually “over the transom”
submissions — manuscripts sent by authors who don’t have agents.
343
Appendix B: Glossary

Small caps: The use of capital letters that are shorter than standard upper-
case letters, usually the height of the lowercase letter x in a font.
Specs: Short for “specifications.” The designer’s instructions about what the
final pages will look like — fonts and their point sizes, margins, leading
between the lines, and so on.
Spine: The bound edge of a magazine or book that has printing on it (title,
issue date, logo, and so on).
Style sheet: A guide that defines a book’s style elements, created by the 
copyeditor.
TK: Editorial shorthand for “information to come.”
Transposition: A common typographic error in which letters or words are
not correctly placed.
Typeface: The way letters and numbers are formatted on a page — roman,
bold, italic, strikethrough, shadow, and so on.
Typeset pages: In book publishing, a set of page proofs, usually loose-leaf,
that are composed according to the design specs for review to ensure that the
type is correctly set. Also called “composed pages.”
Typesetter: A person who converts electronic manuscript files into page
proofs that conform to the design specs. In these days of electronic page
layout and composition, this person is often known as a compositor, espe-
cially because typesetting, strictly speaking, deals only with copy, not with
display elements.
Well: The main middle section of a magazine where the feature articles
appear.
Widow: The final word or line of a paragraph that appears alone at the top of
a laid-out page or column.
Word break: The division of a word on a syllable at the end of one line, with
its continuation on the following line.
