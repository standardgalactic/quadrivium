Introduction
W
hat is Adobe InDesign and what can it do for you? InDesign is a power-
ful publishing application that lets you work the way you want to
work. You can use InDesign as a free-form but manual approach to layout, or
as a structured but easily revised approach. The fact that you can choose
which way to work is important for both novice and experienced users
because there isn’t a single, correct way to lay out pages. Sometimes (for
example, if your project is a single-instance publication), creating a layout
from scratch — almost as if you were doing it by hand on paper — is the best
approach. And sometimes using a highly formatted template that you can
modify as needed is the way to go: There’s no need to reinvent the wheel for
documents that have a structured and repeatable format.
InDesign can handle sophisticated tasks, such as magazine and newspaper
page layout, but its simple approach to publishing also makes it a good
choice for smaller projects, such as one-off ads and fliers. InDesign is also a
good choice for corporate publishing tasks, such as proposals and annual
reports. Plug-in software from other vendors adds extra capabilities.
But that’s not all. InDesign was designed from the ground up as an electronic
publishing tool. That means that you can easily send documents to service
bureaus and printing presses for direct output, which saves you lots of time
and money. It also means that you can create documents for electronic distri-
bution, particularly using the Adobe Acrobat Portable Document Format
(PDF). These electronic files can include interactive features, such as buttons
to play sounds or a movie.
After you get the hang of it, InDesign is quite easy to use. At the same time,
it’s a powerful publishing program with a strong following among the ranks of
professional publishers — and the latest InDesign CS3 version is certain to
reinforce that position. Part of its success is due to the fact that its interface
is like that of its sister applications, Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop,
which are also components of the Adobe Creative Suite.
If you are just getting started with InDesign, welcome! I hope you’ll find the
information in these pages to be helpful in getting you started.

How to Use This Book
Although this book has information that any level of publisher needs to know
to use InDesign, this book is primarily for those of you who are fairly new to
the field, or who are just becoming familiar with the program. I try to take
the mystery out of InDesign and give you some guidance on how to create
a bunch of different types of documents. Here are some conventions used
in this book:
 Menu commands are listed like this: Window➪Pages.
 Key combinations: If you’re supposed to press several keys together, I
indicate that by placing plus signs (+) between them. Thus, Shift+Ô+A
means press and hold the Shift and Ô keys, and then press A. After
you’ve pressed the A key, let go of all the keys. I also use the plus sign to
join keys to mouse movements. For example, Alt+drag means to hold the
Alt key when dragging the mouse.
Note that the Macintosh sequence comes first, followed by the Windows
equivalent.
 Pointer: The small graphic icon that moves on the screen as you move
your mouse is a pointer (also called a cursor). The pointer takes on dif-
ferent shapes depending on the tool you select, the current location of
the mouse, and the function you are performing.
 Click: This means to quickly press and release the mouse button once.
On most Mac mice, there is only one button, but on some there are two
or more. All PC mice have at least two buttons. If you have a multi-
button mouse, click the leftmost button when I say to click the mouse.
 Double-click: This tells you to quickly press and release the mouse
button twice. On some multi-button mice, one of the buttons can func-
tion as a double-click. (You click it once, the mouse clicks twice.) If your
mouse has this feature, use it; it saves strain on your hand.
 Right-click: A Windows feature, this means to click the right-hand mouse
button. On a Mac’s one-button mouse, hold the Control key when click-
ing the mouse button to do the equivalent of right-clicking in programs
that support it. On multi-button Mac mice, assign one of the buttons to
the Control+click combination.
 Dragging: Dragging is used for moving and sizing items in an InDesign
document. To drag an item, position the mouse pointer on the item, press
and hold down the mouse button, and then slide the mouse across a flat
surface.

How This Book Is Organized
I’ve divided this book into eight parts, not counting this introduction. Note
that the book covers InDesign on both Macintosh and Windows. Because the
application is almost identical on both platforms, I only point out platform-
specific information when I need to, when I remember to, or both.
I have also included some bonus content on the InDesignCentral Web site
(www.InDesignCentral.com).
Part I: Before You Begin
Designing a document is a combination of science and art. The science is in
setting up the structure of the page: How many places will hold text, and how
many will hold graphics? How wide will the margins be? Where will the page
numbers appear? And so on. The art is in coming up with creative ways of fill-
ing the structure to please your eyes and the eyes of the people who will be
looking at your document.
In this part, I tell you how to navigate your way around InDesign using the
program’s menus, dialog boxes, panels, and panes. I also explain how to cus-
tomize the preferences to your needs.
Part II: Document Essentials
Good publishing technique is about more than just getting the words down
on paper. It’s also about opening, saving, adding, deleting, numbering, and
setting layout guidelines for documents. This part shows you how to do all
that and a lot more, including tips on setting up master pages that you can
use over and over again. You’ll also find out how to create color swatches for
easy reuse in your documents.
Part III: Object Essentials
This part of the book shows you how to work with objects: the lines, text
frames, graphics frames, and other odds and ends that make up a publication.
And you’ll discover how to apply some really neat special effects to them.

Introduction

Part IV: Text Essentials
When you think about it, text is a big deal when it comes to publishing docu-
ments. After all, how many people would want to read a book with nothing
but pictures? In this part, I show you how to create and manipulate text, in
more ways than you can even imagine.
Part V: Graphics Essentials
Very few people would want to read a book with nothing but text, so this part
is where I show you how to handle graphics in InDesign.
Part VI: Getting Down to Business
InDesign — especially with some of the enhancements in its latest version —
is really good at handling the many kinds of documents that tend to be used in
businesses, such as manuals, annual reports, and catalogs. This part shows
you how to create tables, handle footnotes, create indexes, manage page num-
bering across multiple chapters in a book, and use text variables to make
InDesign update text as needed based on the document’s current context.
Part VII: Printing and Output Essentials
Whether you’re printing a publication or simply creating a PDF file for read-
ers to download from a Web site, you still need to understand the basics of
outputting an InDesign document. This part is where I show you how to set
up your output files, manage color, and work with service bureaus.
Part VIII: The Part of Tens
This part of the book is like the chips in the chocolate chip cookies; you
could eat the cookies without them, but you’d be missing a really good part.
It’s a part that shows you some important resources that will help you make
the most of InDesign. It also gives some pointers on switching to InDesign
from QuarkXPress and Adobe PageMaker.

Icons Used in This Book
So that you can pick out parts that you really need to pay attention to (or,
depending on your taste, to avoid), I’ve used some symbols, or icons, in this
book.
When you see this icon, it means I am pointing out a feature that’s new to
InDesign CS3.
If you see this icon, it means that I’m mentioning some really nifty point or
idea that you may want to keep in mind as you use the program.
This icon lets you know something you’ll want to keep in mind. If you forget it
later, that’s fine, but if you remember it, it will make your InDesign life a little
easier.
If you skip all the other icons, pay attention to this one. Why? Because ignor-
ing it could cause something really, really bad or embarrassing to happen,
like when you were sitting in your second-grade classroom waiting for the
teacher to call on you to answer a question, and you noticed that you still
had your pajama shirt on. I don’t want that to happen to you!
This icon tells you that I am about to pontificate on some remote technical
bit of information that might help explain a feature in InDesign. The technical
info will definitely make you sound impressive if you memorize it and recite it
to your friends.

Part I
Before You Begin

In this part . . .
You have your copy of InDesign and you’d like some
basic information on how to get started, right? Well,
you have come to the right place. Read along and, before
you know it, you’ll be sailing smoothly through InDesign.
This part of the book gives you a general idea of what
InDesign can do. I explain the layout approaches you can
take and how to set up InDesign to work the way you
work. Along the way, you’ll find out how to navigate the
plethora of panels, menus, tools, and shortcuts that can
seem overwhelming at first but that soon become second
nature as you gain experience using the program.
Welcome aboard!

S
tarting to use a new software application is not unlike meeting a new
friend for the first time. You take a long look at the person, maybe ask a
few questions, and begin the process of becoming acquainted. Just as it’s
worthwhile to learn the likes and dislikes of a new friend, it’s also worth your
time to wrap your head around InDesign’s unique style and approaches. When
you do so, you’ll find it much easier to start using InDesign to get work done.
This chapter explains where to look in InDesign for the features and capabilities
you need to master. I introduce you to the process that InDesign assumes you
use when laying out documents, explain some of the terms you’ll encounter
throughout the book, describe the unique interface elements in the document
window, survey the most commonly used tools, and explain how InDesign pack-
ages much of its functionality through an interface element called a panel.
The InDesign Approach
Publishing programs have some similarities and some differences in their var-
ious approaches to the publishing task. One way to describe a program’s
approach to publishing is to talk about its metaphor, or the overall way that it
handles publishing tasks.

Some programs use a free-form metaphor, which means that the method used
to craft a document is based on assembling page elements as you would if they
were placed on a traditional pasteboard until you were ready to use them. This
is also called the pasteboard metaphor, which is an imprecise term because
software that uses other metaphors can still include a pasteboard. The now-
defunct PageMaker is the best-known example of the free-form approach.
Other programs approach page layout by using a frame-based metaphor, in
which frames (or boxes) hold both the page elements and the attributes that
control the appearance of those elements. QuarkXPress is the best-known
example of the frame-based approach.
InDesign offers the best of both worlds because it incorporates both the free-
form and the frame-based metaphors.
The frame-based metaphor
When you work with a frame-based metaphor, you build pages by assembling a
variety of frames that will contain your text and graphics. First, you set up the
basic framework of the document — the page size and orientation, margins,
number of columns, and so on. You then fill that framework with text, graphics,
and lines.
These frames and lines need not be straight or square. With InDesign, you
can create frames that are shaped by Bézier curves. (In the 1970s, French
engineer Pierre Bézier created the mathematics that make these adjustable
curves work.)
Why would you want to use frames? Publishers find several reasons why
frames come in handy:
 To create a template for documents, such as newsletters and maga-
zines, that use the same basic layout elements across many articles.
You create the frames and then add the text and graphics appropriate
for each specific article, modifying, adding, and deleting frames as nec-
essary for each article.
 To get a sense of how you want your elements to be placed and sized
before you start working with the actual elements. This is similar to
sketching a rough layout on paper with a pen or pencil before doing a
formal layout with InDesign.
 To set up specific size and placement of elements up front. You often
work with a template or with guidelines that limit the size and placement
of elements. In many cases, you can copy an existing frame because its
size is the same as what you use in several locations of your layout. For
10
Part I: Before You Begin 

structured or partly structured documents, such as newsletters and mag-
azines, it is usually easier to set up documents up front so that elements
are sized and placed correctly; the less favorable alternative is resizing
elements one at a time later on.
Whether you start by creating frames to hold graphics or text or you simply
place the text and graphics directly on your page, you’re using frames. When
you directly place elements on the page, InDesign creates a frame automati-
cally for each element. The frame that InDesign creates is based on the
amount of text or the size of the graphic, rather than on your specific frame
specifications. Of course, in either case, you can modify the frames and the
elements within them.
The free-form metaphor
Working under a free-form metaphor, you draw a page’s content as if you’re
working on paper. If you’ve been in the publishing business for a while, you
might once have used wax to stick strips of type, camera-ready line drawings,
and halftone pictures to a pasteboard. You would then assemble and
reassemble all those pieces until you got the combination that looked right to
you. The free-form metaphor encourages a try-as-you-go, experimental layout
approach, which is particularly well suited to one-of-a-kind documents such
as ads, brochures, annual reports, and some marketing materials.
If you use a frame-based approach to page layout, you can experiment with
using the frames as placeholders for actual text and graphics. Visual thinkers
like to work with actual objects, which is why the free-form metaphor works
much better for them. With InDesign, you pick the metaphor that works for
your style, your current situation, and your mood. After all, both approaches
can lead to the same great design.
Understanding Global and Local Control
The power of desktop publishing in general, and InDesign in particular, is that
it lets you automate time-consuming layout and typesetting tasks while at the
same time letting you customize each step of the process according to your
needs.
This duality of structure and flexibility — implemented via the dual use of the
frame-based and free-form layout metaphors — carries over to all operations,
from typography to color. You can use global controls to establish general
settings for layout elements, and then use local controls to modify those ele-
ments to meet specific publishing requirements. The key to using global and
local tools effectively is to know when each is appropriate.
11
Chapter 1: Understanding InDesign Ingredients

Global tools include
 General preferences and application preferences (see Chapter 2)
 Master pages and libraries (see Chapter 6)
 Character and paragraph styles (see Chapter 14)
 Table and cell styles (see Chapter 20)
 Object styles (see Chapter 10)
 Sections and page numbers (see Chapter 4)
 Color definitions (see Chapter 7)
 Hyphenation and justification (see Chapter 15)
Styles and master pages are the two main global settings that you can expect
to override locally throughout a document. You shouldn’t be surprised to
make such changes often because, although the layout and typographic func-
tions that styles and master pages automate are the fundamental compo-
nents of any document’s look, they don’t always work for all the specific
content within a publication. (If they did, who’d need human designers?!)
Local tools include
 Frame tools (see Part III, as well as Chapter 17)
 Character and paragraph tools (see Chapters 15 and 16)
 Graphics tools (see Part V)
12
Part I: Before You Begin 
Keep your bearings straight
A powerful but confusing capability in InDesign
is something called a control point. InDesign
lets you work with objects from nine different
reference points — any of the four corners, the
middle of any of the four sides, or the center —
such as when positioning the object precisely
or rotating the object. You choose the active ref-
erence point, or control point, in the Control
panel or Transform panel, using the grid of nine
points arranged in a square.
By default, InDesign uses the central reference
point as the control point, which is great for
rotating an object, but can lead to confusion
when you enter in the X and Y coordinates to
place it precisely. That’s because most people
use the upper-left corner of an object when
specifying its coordinates, not the center of the
object. Be sure to change the control point to
the upper-left reference point whenever enter-
ing X and Y coordinates in the Control or
Transform panels.
How do you change the control point? That’s
easy: Just click the desired reference point in
that preview grid. The control point will be
black, whereas the other reference points will
be white.

Choosing the right tools for the job
Depending on what you’re trying to do with InDesign at any given moment,
you may or may not immediately know which tool to use. If, for example, you
maintain fairly precise layout standards throughout a document, using
master pages is the way to keep your work in order. Using styles is the best
solution if you want to apply standard character and paragraph formatting
throughout a document. When you work with one-of-a-kind documents, on
the other hand, it doesn’t make much sense to spend time designing master
pages and styles — it’s easier just to format elements as you create them.
For example, you can create drop caps (large initial letters set into a para-
graph of type, like the drop cap that starts each chapter in this book) as a
character option in the Character panel, or you can create a paragraph style
(formatting that you can apply to whole paragraphs, ensuring that the same
formatting is applied each time) that contains the drop-cap settings, and then
apply that style to the paragraph containing the drop cap. Which method you
choose depends on the complexity of your document and how often you
need to perform the action. The more often you find yourself taking a set of
steps, the more often you should use a global tool (like character and para-
graph styles) to accomplish the task.
Fortunately, you don’t need to choose between global and local tools while
you’re in the middle of designing a document. You can always create styles
from existing formatting later. You can also add elements to a master page if
you start to notice that you need them to appear on every page.
13
Chapter 1: Understanding InDesign Ingredients
What to do when you make a mistake
InDesign is a very forgiving program. If you
make a mistake, change your mind, or work
yourself into a complete mess, you don’t have to
remain in your predicament or save your work.
InDesign offers several escape routes. You can
 Undo your last action by choosing
Edit➪Undo or pressing Ô+Z or Ctrl+Z.
(Some actions, particularly actions such as
scrolling that do not affect any items or the
underlying document structure, cannot be
undone.) You can undo multiple actions in
the reverse order in which they were done
by repeatedly choosing Edit➪Undo or
pressing Ô+Z or Ctrl+Z; each time you
undo, the previous action is undone.
 Redo an action you’ve undone by choosing
Edit➪Redo or pressing Shift+Ô+Z or
Ctrl+Shift+Z. Alternatively, choosing Undo
and Redo is a handy way of seeing a
before/after view of a particular change. As
with undo, you can redo multiple undone
actions in the reverse of the order in which
they were undone.

Specifying measurement values
Another situation in which you can choose between local or global controls
is specifying measurement values. Regardless of the default measurement unit
you set (that is, the measurement unit that appears in all dialog boxes and
panels), you can use any unit when entering measurements in an InDesign
dialog box. For example, if the default measurement is picas, but you’re new
to publishing and are more comfortable with working in inches, go ahead and
enter measurements in inches.
InDesign accepts any of the following codes for measurement units. Note that
the x in the items listed below indicates where you specify the value, such as
2i for 2 inches. It doesn’t matter whether you put a space between the value
and the code. Typing 2inch and typing 2 inch are the same as far as InDesign
is concerned:
 xi or x inch or x" (for inches)
 xp (for picas)
 xpt or 0px (for points)
 xc (for ciceros)
 xag (for agates)
 xcm (for centimeters)
 xmm (for millimeters)
The ability to specify measurements in agates is new to InDesign CS3. Agates
are typically used in newspaper publishing.
You can enter fractional picas in two ways: in decimal format (as in 8.5p) and
in picas and points (as in 8p6). Either of these settings results in a measure-
ment of 81⁄2 picas (there are 12 points in a pica).
Basic InDesign Vocabulary
Not too long ago, only a few publishing professionals knew — or cared about —
what the words pica, kerning, crop, and color model meant. Today, these words
are becoming commonplace because almost everyone who wants to produce a
nice-looking report, a simple newsletter, or a magazine encounters these terms
in the menus and manuals of their layout programs. Occasionally, the terms are
used incorrectly or are replaced with general terms to make nonprofessional
users feel less threatened, but that substitution ends up confusing professional
printers, people who work in service bureaus, and Internet service providers.
Throughout this book, I define other publishing terms as they come up.

Chapter 1: Understanding InDesign Ingredients
Altered keystrokes: Revised shortcuts
InDesign CS3 has changed a few shortcuts that
users of previous versions of InDesign should
know, so they can adapt accordingly:
 Type➪Paragraph Styles: The new shortcut is
Ô+F11 on the Mac, but the old shortcut of F11
still works (though the Mac OS X’s Exposé
program also uses this shortcut and thus may
appear instead). In Windows, the shortcut
remains F11, but Ctrl+F11 also works.
 Type➪Character Styles: The new shortcut
is Shift+Ô+F11 on the Mac, but the old
shortcut of Shift+F11 still works. In
Windows, the shortcut remains Shift+F11,
but Ctrl+Shift+F11 also works.
 Type➪Paragraph: The new Windows short-
cut is now Ctrl+Alt+T, no longer Ctrl+M, to
match the Mac’s Option+Ô+T. Adobe let
Ctrl+Alt+T work as an alternative in InDesign
CS2; now the menu has changed to make
Ctrl+Alt+T the official shortcut. But the old
Ctrl+M continues to work if you want to still
use it.
 View➪Show/Hide Frame Edges: The new
shortcut for the Mac only is Control+Ô+H.
The Windows shortcut remains Ctrl+H.
 View➪Display Performance➪Fast Display:
The new shortcut is Option+Shift+Ô+Z or
Ctrl+Alt+Z, replacing Shift+Ô+0 or Ctrl+
Shift+0.
 View➪Display Performance➪High Quality
Display: The new shortcut, for the Mac only,
is Control+Option+Ô+H. The Windows short-
cut remains Ctrl+Alt+H.
 Window➪Effects: The new shortcut to the
renamed Transparency panel is Shift+Ô+F10
on the Mac, but the old shortcut of Shift+F10
still works. In Windows, the shortcut remains
Shift+F10, but Ctrl+Shift+F10 also works.
 Window➪Pages: The new shortcut is
Ô+F12 on the Mac, but the old shortcut of
F12 still works. In Windows, the shortcut
remains F12, but Ctrl+F12 also works.
 Window➪Stroke: The new shortcut is
Ô+F10 on the Mac, but the old shortcut of
F10 still works. In Windows, the shortcut
remains F10, but Ctrl+F10 also works.
For consistency, this book uses the new short-
cut for both Mac and Windows for the new
shortcuts involving the F10, F11, and F12 keys,
such as Ô+F10 and Ctrl+F10 for opening the
Stroke panel. They changed to accommodate
Mac OS X’s Exposé program, which uses the
F10, F11, and F12 keys in its shortcuts, causing it
to launch when InDesign users entered short-
cuts using them. The new InDesign shortcuts
don’t step on Exposé’s toes.
New shortcuts include the following:
 Type➪Glyphs: Option+Shift+F11 or Alt+
Shift+F11.
 Type➪Insert Special Character➪Quotation
Marks➪Straight Double Quotation Marks:
Command+Shift+' or Alt+Shift+'.
 Type➪Insert Special Character➪Quotation
Marks➪Straight Single Quotation Mark
(Apostrophe): Command+' or Alt+'.
 Notes➪Notes Mode: Ô+F8 or Ctrl+F8.
 Window➪Automation➪Scripts:
Option+Ô+F11 or Ctrl+Alt+F11.

Like all great human endeavors, InDesign comes with its own terminology,
much of it adopted from other Adobe products. Some general terms to know
include the following:
 Frame: The container for an object. A frame can hold text, a graphic, or
a color fill.
 Link: The connection to a file that you import, or place (defined below),
into an InDesign document. The link contains the file’s location and its
last modification date and time. A link can reference any graphics or text
file that you have imported into a layout. InDesign can notify you when a
source text or graphics file has changed so you can choose whether to
update the version in your layout.
 Package: The collection of all files needed to deliver a layout for printing.
 PDF: The Adobe Portable Document Format, which has become the stan-
dard for sharing electronic documents. No matter what kind of computer
it is viewed on (Windows, Macintosh, Palm, or Unix), a PDF document
displays the original document’s typography, graphics representation,
and layout. With InDesign, you can place PDF files as if they were graph-
ics, and you can also export its InDesign pages to PDF format.
 Place: To import a graphics or text file.
 Plug-in: A piece of software that loads into, and becomes part of,
InDesign to add capabilities to the program.
 Stroke: The outline of an object (whether a graphic, line, or individual
text characters) or frame.
 Thread: The connections between text frames that let a story flow from
one frame to another.
Discovering the Document Window
In InDesign, you spend lots of time working in document windows — the
“containers” for your documents. Each document, regardless of its size, is
contained within its own document window.
The best way to get familiar with the InDesign document window is by open-
ing a blank document. Simply choosing File➪New➪Document, or pressing
Ô+N or Ctrl+N, and clicking OK opens a new document window. Don’t worry
about the settings for now — just explore.
Figure 1-1 shows all the standard elements of a new document window. I won’t
bore you by covering interface elements that are standard to all programs.
Instead, the rest of this section focuses on InDesign-specific elements.

Rulers
Document windows display a horizontal ruler across the top and a vertical
ruler down the left side. As shown in Figure 1-1, the horizontal ruler measures
from the top-left corner of the page across the entire spread, and the vertical
ruler measures from the top to the bottom of the current page. These rulers
are handy for judging the size and placement of objects on a page. Even expe-
rienced designers often use the rulers while they experiment with a design.
Both rulers display increments in picas unless you change the measurement
system for each ruler in the Units & Increments pane of the Preferences dialog
box. Choose InDesign➪Preferences➪Units & Increments or press Ô+K on the
Mac, or choose Edit➪Preferences➪Units & Increments or press Ctrl+K in
Windows, to open the Preferences dialog box. Your choices include inches,
picas, points, decimal inches, ciceros, agates, millimeters, and centimeters. If
you change the ruler measurement system when no documents are open, the
rulers in all new documents will use the measurement system you selected. If a
document is open when you make the change, the rulers are changed only in
that document.
You can also create your own measurement system by choosing Custom.
Most people should ignore this option, but sometimes it can make sense,
such as setting the ruler to match the line spacing, so you can measure
number of lines in your ruler.
If your computer has a small monitor and the rulers start to get in your way,
you can hide them by choosing View➪Hide Rulers or by pressing Ô+R or
Ctrl+R.
Zero point
The point where the rulers intersect in the upper-left corner of the page is
called the zero point. This is the starting place for all horizontal and vertical
measurements. If you need to place items in relation to another spot on the
page (for example, from the center of a spread rather than from the left-hand
page), you can move the zero point by clicking and dragging it to a new loca-
tion. Notice that the X: and Y: values in the Control panel update as you drag
the zero point so you can place it precisely. If you change the zero point, it
changes for all pages or spreads in the document. You can reset the zero
point to the upper-left corner of the left-most page by double-clicking the
intersection of the rulers in the upper-left corner.
If you move the zero point, all the objects on the page display new X: and Y:
values even though they haven’t actually moved. Objects above or to the left
of the zero point will show negative X: and Y: values, and the X: and Y: values
of other objects will not relate to their actual position on the page or spread.
18
Part I: Before You Begin 

You can lock the ruler origin (the zero point), making it more difficult to acci-
dentally change it. Control+click or right-click the ruler origin and choose
Lock Zero Point from the menu that appears. (The Unlock Zero Point com-
mand is right there as well, so you can just as easily unlock it.) Locking the
zero point is a good idea because it will remind anyone working on your doc-
ument that you prefer that they not fiddle with the zero point.
Pasteboard
The white area that surrounds the page is called the pasteboard. It is a work-
space for temporarily storing objects. Above and below each page or spread
is about an inch of pasteboard, and on the left and right a pasteboard space
as wide as a page. For example, a spread of two 8-inch-wide pages will have 8
inches of pasteboard to the left and 8 inches of pasteboard to the right.
Pages and guides
Pages, which you can see onscreen surrounded by black outlines, reflect the
page size you set up in the New Document dialog box (File➪New➪Document,
or Ô+N or Ctrl+N). If it looks like two or more pages are touching, you’re look-
ing at a spread.
InDesign uses nonprinting guides, lines that show you the position of margins
and that help you position objects on the page. Margins are the spaces at the
outside of the page, whereas columns are vertical spaces where text is sup-
posed to go by default. Magenta lines across the top and bottom of each page
show the document’s top and bottom margins. Violet lines show left and right
columns (for single-page documents) or inside and outside columns (for
spreads).
You can change the location of margin and column guides by choosing
Layout➪Margins and Columns. You can create additional guides — such as
to help you visually align objects — by holding down your mouse button on
the horizontal or vertical ruler and then dragging a guide into the position
you want.
Zoom field and pop-up menu
At the lower-left corner of the document window dwells the Zoom field,
which shows the current zoom percentage. You can type in a new value any
time. Immediately to its right is the Zoom pop-up menu, which also lets you
change the document’s view. The view can be between 5 percent and 4,000
percent in 0.01-percent increments.
19
Chapter 1: Understanding InDesign Ingredients

To change the view without taking your hands off the keyboard, press
Option+Ô+5 or Ctrl+Alt+5, enter a new zoom value, and press Return or
Enter. Or press Ô+= or Ctrl+= to zoom in, or Ô+– or Ctrl+– to zoom out.
Page controls
If you feel like flipping through pages of the document you are creating,
InDesign makes it easy with page-turning buttons and the Page field and pop-
up menu. Controls for entering prefixes for the page numbers of sections, and
for indicating absolute page numbers in a document that contains multiple
sections, are also handy. (An absolute page number indicates a page’s posi-
tion in the document, such as +1 for the first page, +2 for the second page,
and so on.)
Next to the Zoom pop-up menu is a combined page-number field and pop-up
menu encased by two sets of arrows. These arrows are page-turning buttons
that take you to, from left to right, the first page, the previous page, the next
page, and the last page. Just click an arrow to get where you want to go.
You can also jump directly to a specific page or master page. To jump to a spe-
cific page, highlight the current number in the page number field (by selecting
it with your cursor, or by pressing Ô+J or Ctrl+J), enter a new page number,
and press Return or Enter. (To jump to a master page, select the Page Number
field and enter the first few characters of the master page’s name.)
Opening Multiple Document Windows
If you like to work on more than one project at once, you’ve come to the right
program. InDesign lets you open several documents at once. It also lets you
open multiple windows simultaneously for individual documents. A large
monitor (or having multiple monitors connected) makes this multi-window
feature even more useful. By opening multiple windows, you can
 Display two (or more) different pages or spreads at once. You still have
to work on the documents one at a time, but no navigation is required —
you have only to click within the appropriate window.
 Display multiple magnifications of the same page. For example, you
can work on a detail at high magnification in one window and display the
entire page — and see the results of your detail work — at actual size in
another window.
 Display a master page in one window and a document page based on
that master page in another window. When you change the master
page, the change is reflected in the window in which the associated doc-
ument page is displayed.
20
Part I: Before You Begin 

To open a new window for the active document, choose Window➪Arrange➪
New Window. The new window is displayed in front of the original window.
To show both windows at once, choose Window➪Arrange➪Tile. When you
choose the Tile command, all open windows are resized and displayed side
by side. (If you choose Window➪Arrange➪Cascade, all open windows are dis-
played stacked and staggered on top of each other. The front-most document
window is visible; the title bars of the other windows are visible above the
front-most document.)
When multiple windows are open, you activate a window by clicking on a
window’s title bar or anywhere within the window. Also, the names of all
open documents are displayed at the bottom of the Window menu. Choosing
a document name from the Window menu brings that document to the front.
If multiple windows are open for a particular document, each window is dis-
played (they’re displayed in the order in which you created them) in the
Window menu.
To close all windows for the currently displayed document, press Shift+Ô+W
or Ctrl+Shift+W. To close all windows for all open documents, press
Option+Shift+Ô+W or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+W.
Tooling around the Tools Panel
You can move the InDesign Tools panel — the control center for 32 of
InDesign’s 33 tools, as well as for 13 additional functions — by clicking and
dragging it into position. The Tools panel usually appears to the left of a doc-
ument (see Figure 1-2).
The one tool not directly accessible from the Tools panel is the Marker tool.
But you can switch to it from the Eyedropper tool by holding Option or Alt.
(Chapter 7 explains its use.)
To discover each tool’s “official” name, hover the mouse pointer over a tool
for a few seconds, and a Tool Tip will appear, telling you the name of that
tool. If the Tool Tips do not display, make sure that the Tool Tips pop-up
menu is set to Normal or Fast in the Interface pane of the Preferences dialog
box (choose InDesign➪Preferences➪Interface or press Ô+K on the Mac, or
choose Edit➪Preferences➪Interface or press Ctrl+K in Windows).
The Interface pane is new to InDesign CS3. In previous versions, the Tool Tips
control was in the General pane of the Preferences dialog box.
InDesign gives you one — and only one — tool for each specific job. The
Tools panel includes tools for creating and manipulating the objects that
make up your designs. The tools in the Tools panel are similar to those in
other Adobe products (such as Photoshop, Illustrator, and Dreamweaver). I
cover what each tool does in the following sections.
21
Chapter 1: Understanding InDesign Ingredients

The small arrow in its lower-right corner of some tools is a pop-out menu
indicator. A tool that displays this arrow is hiding one or more similar tools.
To access these “hidden” tools, click and hold a tool that has the pop-out
menu indicator, as shown in Figure 1-3. When the pop-out displays, click one
of the new tools. (Figure 1-2 shows all the pop-out tools.)
You don’t need to worry about all the tools, so I highlight just those that
you’ll need to know to start using InDesign. You’ll likely come across the
others as you work on specific tasks, so I cover those in the chapters that
introduce those functions.
Using the Selection tools
To work with objects, you have to select them. InDesign provides three tools
to do that, letting you select different aspects of objects.
Selection tool
This is perhaps the most-used tool in InDesign. With the Selection tool, you
can select objects on the page and move or resize them. You might want to
think of this tool as the Mover tool because it’s the only tool that lets you
drag objects around on-screen.

Part I: Before You Begin 

After you’ve selected the Selection tool, here’s how it works:
 To select any object on a document page, click it. If you can’t seem to
select it, the object might be placed by a master page (a preformatted
page used to format pages automatically), or the object might be behind
another object.
 To select an object placed by a master page, press Shift+Ô or Ctrl+Shift
while you click.
 To select an object that is completely behind another object, Ô+click it
or Ctrl+click it.
Direct Selection tool
The Direct Selection tool is what you use to work on the contents of a frame,
not the frame itself. For example, you can use the Direct Selection tool to
select individual handles on objects to reshape them, or to move graphics
within their frames.
Here’s how the Direct Selection tool works:
 To select an object to reshape it, click the object to display anchor
points on the edges (the anchor points are hollow handles that you can
select individually, as shown in Figure 1-4). You can drag the anchor
points to reshape the object.

right corner

out tools.
23
Chapter 1: Understanding InDesign Ingredients

 To select objects placed by a master page, Shift+Ô+click or Ctrl+Shift+
click, as with the Selection tool. The Direct Selection tool lets you easily
select objects behind other objects and select items within groups.
 To move a graphic within its frame, click inside the frame and drag the
graphic.
 To move a frame but leave the graphic in place, click an edge of the
frame and drag it.
Position tool
Meant to mimic PageMaker’s Crop tool to help former PageMaker users
adjust to InDesign, the Position tool, which you access from the pop-out
menu in the Direct Selection tool, combines some aspects of the Selection
tool with some aspects of the Direct Selection tool:
 As with the Selection tool, you can resize an object’s frame by dragging
its handles.
 As with the Direct Selection tool, you can click a graphic and reposition
it within the frame by dragging — and that has the effect of cropping the
graphic.
Using the Type tool
A very frequently used tool, the Type tool lets you enter, edit, and format
text. The Type tool also lets you create rectangular text frames.
Here’s how the Type tool works:
 To create a rectangular text frame, click and drag; hold the Shift key to
create a perfect square.

Part I: Before You Begin 

 To begin typing or editing text, click in a text frame or in any empty
frame and type away.
I explain stories and threaded text frames in Chapter 12.
Using the object-creation tools
InDesign has a bunch of tools for creating shapes. Part V covers them in more
depth, but you should know about a few of them now because they create
objects that can contain either text or graphics. Plus, you can also use them
to draw your own shapes that you then color or otherwise embellish in your
layout.
Pen tool
With the Pen tool, you can create simple illustrations. You use the Pen tool,
which is modeled after the pen tools in Illustrator and Photoshop, to create
paths (both open, such as lines, and closed, such as shapes) consisting of
straight and curved segments. Give it a try — it’s fun!
Here’s how the Pen tool works:
 To create straight lines, click to establish an anchor point, and then move
the mouse to the next location, click again, and so on. To move an anchor
point after clicking, press the spacebar and drag the anchor point.
 To create curved lines, click and drag, and then release the mouse
button to end the segment.
 To close a path and create a frame, click the first anchor point created
(the hollow one).
 To leave a path open and create a line, Ô+click or Ctrl+click away from
the path or select another tool.
Type tool
The Type tool lets you draw rectangular text frames, as well as type text
inside them.
Line tool
The Line tool lets you draw freestanding lines (paths) on your page. After
selecting this tool, simply click and drag the mouse to draw the line. Holding
the Shift key while you click and drag constrains the line angle to 45-degree
increments, which is useful for creating straight horizontal and vertical lines.
25
Chapter 1: Understanding InDesign Ingredients

Frame and shape tools
InDesign has three frame tools — Rectangle Frame, Ellipse Frame, and
Polygon Frame — and three shape tools — Rectangle, Ellipse, and Polygon.
The frame and shape tools are redundant because both frames and shapes
can hold text or graphics or be empty.
Because the frame and shape tools really do the same thing, you might use
the frame tool when creating frames that will have their content added later.
Why? Because they display with a big X through them, making them easier to
spot when looking for frames to fill. The shape tools create frames without
that X, so it’s easier to overlook them.
To create a rectangle or ellipse, choose the appropriate tool, click somewhere
in the document window, and drag the mouse to another location. The rec-
tangle or ellipse fills the area. But creating a polygon works differently:
1. Double-click the Polygon or Polygon Frame tool to display the
Polygon Settings dialog box, shown in Figure 1-5.
2. Enter a value between 3 and 100 in the Number of Sides field to spec-
ify the number of sides on your polygon.
3. To create a star shape, use the Star Inset field to specify the size of the
spikes.
The percent value specifies the distance between the polygon’s bound-
ing box and the insides of the spikes (for example, entering 50% creates
spikes that are halfway between the bounding box and the center of the
polygon).
4. Click OK to close the Polygon Settings dialog box.
The settings are saved with the active document for the next time you
use the Polygon or Polygon Frame tool.
5. Click and drag to create the polygon, using the rulers or the
Transform panel or Control panel to judge the size and placement.
To create a symmetrical polygon in which all the sides are the same size,
press the Shift key while you click and drag the Polygon or Polygon
Frame tool.
Using the navigation tools
Several tools help you navigate your document, which means moving around
your pages, moving your pages around the screen, and changing the degree
of magnification to see just part of a page or to see several pages at once.
26
Part I: Before You Begin 

Hand tool
The Hand tool lets you move a page around to view different portions of it or
another page entirely. After selecting the Hand tool, click and drag in any
direction. You can access the Hand tool temporarily without actually switch-
ing tools by pressing Option+spacebar or Alt+Spacebar.
Zoom tool
With the Zoom tool, you increase and decrease the document view scale. You
can highlight a specific area on a page to change its view or you can click on-
screen to change the view scale within InDesign’s preset increments, which is
the same as pressing Ô+= or Ctrl+= to zoom in.
View buttons
The very bottom of the Tools panel has two view buttons: Normal View Mode
and Preview Mode. The first shows the document’s pasteboard, margins, and
guidelines; the second hides those so you can get a better idea of how the
document will look when it’s printed or saved as a PDF.
A pop-up menu in the Preview Mode button has two preview options: Bleed
mode and Slug mode. Bleed mode shows any objects that bleed (extend)
beyond the page boundaries, whereas Slug mode shows the space reserved
for information such as crop marks and color separation names used in final
output. You can read more about these in Chapter 3. You set these options
when you create new documents or by choosing File➪Document Setup.

Chapter 1: Understanding InDesign Ingredients

Working with Panels, Docks,
and Workspaces
InDesign has so many controls and features that its designers have long ago
stopped relying on menu commands to access them all. Instead, most of
InDesign’s features are presented as sort of miniature dialog boxes, called
panels, that are “windows” of readily accessible options to consider when
working in InDesign.
Working with panels
Panels provide an interactive method of working with features, one that lets
you access the controls quickly. In many cases, panels offer the only method
for performing many tasks. Figure 1-1 shows the panels that appear on-screen
by default. Note that you can access all panels — except Quick Apply and
Tabs — via the Window menu, whether or not the panel is displayed on-
screen at the moment.
Panels typically have two — but sometimes three — controls:
 All panels but the Tools, Attributes, Script Label, and Command Bar
panels have a flyout menu (formerly called the palette menu), which
provides a pop-up menu of controls relevant to that panel. Figure 1-6
shows an example of a flyout menu.
 Any active panel — meaning it is displayed in front of any others in its
panel group, so you can actually modify its settings — has a close con-
trol to remove the panel from the panel group. This is not a way to
switch to another panel in that panel group — to do that, just click the
tab of the panel you want to work with. (If you remove a panel by mis-
take, go to the Window menu to open it again.)
28
Part I: Before You Begin 
Using contextual menus
InDesign’s contextual menu interface element
is very useful. By Ctrl+clicking or right-clicking
the document, an object, elements listed in a
panel (such as a list of files or styles), the rulers,
and so on, you can display a menu of options for
modifying whatever it is you clicked. InDesign
provides a lot of options this way, and it is often
easier to use the contextual menus to access
InDesign functions than to hunt through the
many regular menu options and panels.

 Some panels have an expand/collapse control. Click the control to show
more or fewer options (if all options are displayed, clicking the control
will shorten the panel and hide some of the advanced options; if only
the basic options are displayed, clicking the control lengthens the panel
and show all the options.) Figure 1-7 shows examples of collapsed and
expanded panels.
InDesign CS3 has seriously revamped the floating palettes that give you quick
access to so many InDesign features. In previous versions of InDesign, these
floating palettes contained one or more tabbed panes, and you could group
and separate most of them as you preferred. What used to be called a pane is
now called a panel. Panels now also have a consistent appearance: The tab is
always on top, not either on the top or at left depending on whether it was
free-floating or docked to the side of your monitor. Like the panes of yore,
panels can be combined and separated into groups.
Figure 1-7:

29
Chapter 1: Understanding InDesign Ingredients

Adobe has also changed how panels are arranged on screen. By default,
InDesign CS3 comes with two docks, one that holds only the Tools panel, and
one that holds all the other panels, which I call the main dock. (Well, almost.
The Control panel also displays separately, though it’s not in a dock, just by
itself at the top of the screen unless you move it.) Note that the main dock
cannot be moved from the right side of the screen.
To better suit your working style, you can drag panels by their tabs to move
them from one panel group to another, drag them out of a dock so they are
free-floating, or drag them into a dock so they are no longer free-floating. The
new dock feature lets you keep panel groups in one contained area, which
helps keep the interface from getting too cluttered. But you’re not forced to
work this way: You can still drag panels outside the main dock so they are
free-floating on screen.
Not all panels display in the main dock; less-used panels such as Data Merge
will show up in a free-floating panel group when you open it via the Window
menu. Of course, you can always add such panels to the main dock if you use
them a lot.
All but four panels have a tab, which contains its name, to help you select the
desired panel without having to go to the Window menu. To quickly select a
panel, just click its tab. The four special panels (without tabs) are the Tools,
Control, Command Toolbar, and Quick Apply panels. Unlike the rest of
InDesign’s panels, they can’t be grouped with other panels, so there’s no
need for a tab to select them. (And for some reason, the Tools panel resides
in a dock of its own, whereas the other three do not.)
When a panel is active, its controls have the following characteristics:
 To display and select an option, click a pop-up menu or an iconic
button; the changes take effect immediately.
 To place a new value in a field, highlight the value that’s already in the
field and enter the new value. Note that fields accept values in all sup-
ported measurement systems, as described earlier in this chapter. To
implement the new value, press Shift+Return or Shift+Enter. To get out of
a field you’ve modified, leaving the object unchanged, press Esc.
 To increase or decrease the value in the field, use the clickable up and
down arrows where available.
 To use math to perform changes, enter calculations in the field. You can
add, subtract, multiply, and divide values in fields by using the following
operators: +, –, * (multiply), and / (divide). For example, to reduce the
width of a frame by half, type /2 after the current value in the Width
field. Or, to increase the length of a line by 6 points, you can type +6 next
to the current value in the Length field. You can also use percentages in
fields, such 50%, which adjusts the current value by that percentage.
30
Part I: Before You Begin 

You can tell that the developers of InDesign have a passion for panels.
Because there are so many of them, you might want to consider hooking up a
second monitor for displaying them. As with the tools, if you make sure Tool
Tips are enabled in the Interface panel of the Preferences dialog box (choose
InDesign➪Preferences➪Interface or press Ô+K on the Mac, or choose
Edit➪Preferences➪Interface or Ctrl+K in Windows), you’ll get some ideas as
to what the panel iconic buttons and fields do.
InDesign CS3 adds the Assignments panel, which provides access to the
optional InCopy CS3 program’s features; these expert features are beyond
the scope of this book. InDesign CS3 also adds the Cell Styles and Table
Styles panels, which provide additional control over table formatting, as
covered in Chapter 20. The new Notes panel lets you insert nonprinting
reminders in your text, as explained in Chapter 13.
If panels are getting in your way, you can make them all disappear by press-
ing Tab — as long as the Type tool is not active and the text cursor is active
within a text frame, of course. Press Tab to get your panels back.
Working with docks
Docks have controls to collapse and expand them — a new approach in
InDesign CS3. Click the double-arrow iconic button at a dock’s upper corner
to collapse or expand the dock; you can also click the dark depression at the
top of the main dock to collapse it. The main dock also can be resized by
dragging the resize handle. Figure 1-8 shows the dock controls and what they
look like when expanded and collapsed.
Working with workspaces
Although you can rearrange InDesign’s panels to suit your needs, doing this
again and again as you switch from one task to another can be a real chore.
For example, you may open several of the table- and text-oriented panels
when working on text, but then close them and open the graphics- and
positioning-oriented panels when refining layout placement. That’s why
InDesign lets you create workspaces, which are essentially memorized panel
collections. Display the panels you want, where you want them, and create
a new workspace by choosing Window➪Workspace➪Save Workspace. Give
the workspace a name that makes sense, such as Text Panels. That work-
space is now available via Window➪Workspace➪workspace name, automati-
cally displaying just those saved panels in their saved locations.
31
Chapter 1: Understanding InDesign Ingredients

Surveying the Menus
Although InDesign relies heavily on its panels to present its rich capabilities,
it also uses traditional menus. In some cases, you can use menus instead of
panels; in others, you must use a menu command; in still others, you must
use a panel (such as for the data merge and object alignment features).

Part I: Before You Begin 

There are 10 menus in InDesign for Windows and 11 in InDesign for
Macintosh:
 InDesign (Macintosh only): This menu contains the Preferences menu,
where you set much of InDesign’s behavioral defaults. You can also con-
figure plug-ins here. Other functions are standard for all Mac programs,
including hiding and quitting the program. Note that none of these menu
items’ functions are available in panels.
 File: This menu is where you open, create, close, save, export, and set
up documents and books; where you import text and graphics; where
you print documents and prepare them for commercial printing; and
where you set basic user information. Note that none of these menu
items’ functions are available in panels.
 Edit: This menu lets you cut, copy, and paste elements; edit, spell-check,
and do search-and-replace operations across entire stories and set up
story for the InCopy add-on program; adjust and manage color settings;
set up and change keyboard shortcuts and menu preferences; apply var-
ious styles to selected objects and text; and undo and redo recent
actions. In Windows, you also set preferences and quit the program from
this menu. Note that these menu items’ functions, except for Quick
Apply, are not available in panels.
 Layout: With this menu, you add, delete, rearrange, and navigate pages;
change margins and guides; automatically resize a page and its objects;
set up page numbering and sections; and create and format tables of
contents. Note that these menu options’ functions — except for the
Pages, page-navigation, and Numbering & Section Options menus — are
not available in panels.
 Type: With this menu, you adjust typographic attributes such as size
and font, insert special characters, work with footnotes, add placeholder
text; and control the on-screen display of special characters such as
spaces. Note that the Find Font, Change Case, Type on a Path, Document
Footnote Options, Text Variables, Insert Character, Fill with Placeholder
text, and Show Hidden Characters menu items’ functions are not avail-
able though panels.
 Notes: This new menu lets you insert and manage notes in your layout
that do not print. This feature used to be available only if you bought the
InCopy add-on software.
 Object: You use this menu to change the shape, size, location, and other
attributes of objects such as frames and lines; to apply special effects to
objects; to insert multimedia effects such as buttons; and control dis-
play redraw speed. Note that the Text Frame Options, Anchored Object,
Corner Options, Clipping Path, and Convert Shape menu items’ func-
tions are not available through panels.
 Table: Use this menu to create, change, and format tables and cells.
Note that this menu’s functions are available through panels.
33
Chapter 1: Understanding InDesign Ingredients

 View: This menu lets you control the display of your document, from
zoom level to whether guides, rulers, and frame edges appear. Note that
none of these menu items’ functions, except for Screen Mode and the
zoom controls, are available in panels.
 Window: This menu is where you manage the display of document win-
dows and panels, as well as where you set up and work with work-
spaces. The window display and workspace functions are not available
via panels.
 Help: Use this menu to access InDesign’s help system and manage prod-
uct activation and registration. In Windows, this menu also lets you
manage plug-ins. Note that none of these menu items’ functions are
available in panels.
Among the new menu options in InDesign are InCopy and Menus in the Edit
menu; Text Variables and Bulleted & Numbered Lists in the Type menu;
Show/Hide Assigned Frames and Show/Hide Notes in the View menu; and
Assignment and Notes in the Window menu. Also, the Effects option replaces
the Drop Shadow and Feather options in the InDesign CS2 Object menu, and
the Compound Paths menu item in InDesign CS3’s Object menu used to be
submenu items in the InDesign CS2 Paths menu.

t’s safe to say that the nice people who created InDesign did their best:
They put their heads together and made educated guesses about how
most people would like to work and, in doing so, established defaults for vari-
ous settings in the program. When you’re just starting out, it’s not a bad idea
to simply stick with the default settings and see how they work for you. But
after you become more familiar with InDesign and start putting it through its
paces, you can change default preferences, views, and measurements, making
them better suited to your way of working.
Preferences are program settings that dictate how InDesign will act in certain
instances. InDesign provides extensive preference settings for everything
from how objects appear on-screen to how text is managed for spelling and
hyphenation.
Setting InDesign to work your way is easy, and this chapter explains how. And
I promise not to numb you by covering every single option. Instead, I focus
on just those preferences you are likely to change. As for the rest, feel free to
explore their effects once you’ve gotten more comfortable using InDesign.
(And in other chapters, I sometimes recommend specific preferences
changes for the specific actions explained there.)

InDesign stores some preferences in the documents that govern how the doc-
ument works as you work on it, or as it is transferred to other users. Other
preference settings reside on your computer. Knowing how InDesign manages
preferences is important if you share preferences with others or want to make
sure that all your documents are updated with a new preference setting.
Setting Document Preferences
Preferences are settings that affect an entire document — such as what mea-
surement system you use on rulers, what color the guides are, and whether
substituted fonts are highlighted. To access these settings, open the
Preferences dialog box by choosing InDesign➪Preferences➪desired pane
name or pressing Ô+K on the Mac, or by choosing Edit➪Preferences➪desired
pane name or pressing Ctrl+K in Windows.
When you open the Preferences dialog box using the keyboard shortcut (Ô+K
or Ctrl+K), InDesign automatically opens the General pane, as shown in
Figure 2-1. To access one of the other 16 preferences panes, just click its
name from the list at the left of the dialog box.
The Interface pane is new, taking settings formerly found in the General pane
as well as adding collapse options for docks (sometimes called icon panels in
the InDesign documentation and user interface). Likewise, the Clipboard
Handling pane is new, taking settings formerly in the File Handling and Type
panes. The Notes pane is completely new, providing controls over the non-
printing notes feature that used to be available only if you bought the InCopy
add-on program.
InDesign has two methods for changing preferences: You can change prefer-
ences when no documents are open to create new settings for all future docu-
ments, or you can change preferences for the active document, which affects
only that document. Either way, after you’ve changed the desired preferences
settings, just click OK to save those settings.
You cannot reverse changes to preferences by using the Undo command
(Edit➪Undo or Ô+Z or Ctrl+Z). If you change your mind about a preference
setting, reopen the Preferences dialog box and change the setting again.
Type preferences
The Type pane of the Preferences dialog box, shown in Figure 2-2, includes
settings that affect character formats, controls whether you use typogra-
pher’s quotes, and manages how text appears on-screen. You’re likely to
adjust these settings, so here’s a quick review of the main ones:
36
Part I: Before You Begin 

 If Use Typographer’s Quotes is checked, InDesign inserts the correct
typographer’s quotes (often called curly quotes) for the current language
in use whenever you use quotation marks. For example, for U.S. English,
InDesign inserts typographic single quotes (‘ ’) or double quotes (“ ”)
rather than straight quotes. For French, Catalan, Polish, and other lan-
guages, InDesign inserts guillemets (« »).
 Check Triple Click to Select a Line if you want to be able to select an
entire line of text by triple-clicking it.
 When the Apply Leading to Entire Paragraph box is checked, changes to
leading (the space between lines) apply to the entire paragraph, as
opposed to the current line. In most cases, you want the leading to be
applied to all paragraphs, so it’s a good idea to check this box.
 Adjust Spacing Automatically When Cutting and Pasting Words, which is
checked by default, will add or delete spaces around words when you
cut and paste.
 When Font Preview Size is checked, menus let you preview how your
font choice looks before you actually select it. The pop-up menu at right
of the check box lets you select the size of the preview.
 The options in the Drag and Drop Text Editing section of the Type pane
control whether you can drag and drop text selections within a docu-
ment. By default, Enable in Story Editor is checked and Enable in Layout
View is unchecked, which means that you can drag and drop text in the
Story Editor but not when working on a layout. You’ll probably want to
check them both.

Part I: Before You Begin 

In the Character Settings section of the Advanced Type pane, you control pre-
cisely how superscript, subscript, and small-caps characters are placed and
sized:
 The Size fields let you specify the percentages to which superscript and
subscript characters are reduced (or even enlarged). The default is 58.3
percent, but you can enter a value between 1 and 200 percent. I prefer 60
or 65 percent, depending on the type size and font.
 The Position fields let you specify how much to shift superscript charac-
ters up and subscript characters down. The default is 33.3 percent, but
you can enter a value between –500 and 500 percent. I prefer 30 percent
for subscripts and 35 percent for superscripts. Note that negative values
move text in the opposite directions: down for superscripts and up for
subscripts. The percentage is relative to the top of a lowercase letter
(the x height) for superscripts and to the baseline for subscripts.
 The Small Cap field lets you specify the scale of Small Caps characters in
relation to the actual capital letters in the font. The default is 70 percent,
but you can enter a value between 1 and 200 percent.
The Clipboard Preferences pane includes one text-oriented preference that
used to be in the Type pane: Use the When Pasting Text and Tables from
Other Applications setting to choose how formatting is handled when you
paste textual objects from other applications. The default is Text Only, which
means that you want copied text to assume the formatting of the destination
location’s text in InDesign. The All Information option retains the original for-
matting when you copy the text into InDesign.
39
Chapter 2: Making It Work Your Way
Typographic terminology 101
Publishing tools like InDesign use specialized
terms, some of which appear in the Preferences
dialog box:
 Baseline: This term refers to the invisible
line that text sits on in each line. Except for
a few characters like g and p that poke
below it, all characters rest on this baseline.
 Kerning: This refers to an adjustment of the
space between two letters. You kern letters
to accommodate their specific shapes. For
example, you probably would use tighter
kerning in the letter pair to than in oo
because to looks better if the o fits partly
under the cross of the t.
 Leading: This term, also called line spacing,
refers to the space from one baseline to
another.
 Tracking: Tracking determines the overall
space between letters within a word.

Composition preferences
Preferences in the Composition pane, shown in Figure 2-4, do two things:
highlight potential problems on-screen while you’re working, and establish
the behavior of text wrap in certain situations.
Highlighting potential problems
The Highlight check boxes control whether InDesign calls attention to possi-
ble typesetting problems by drawing a highlighter pen effect behind the text.
All are unchecked by default unless indicated otherwise below:
 Keep Violations highlights the last line in a text frame when it cannot
follow the rules specified in the Keep Options dialog box in the Paragraph
panel’s flyout menu (Type➪Paragraph, or Option+Ô+T or Ctrl+Alt+T), as
explained in Chapter 15. For example, if the Keep Options settings require
at least three lines of text in the text frame, but only two lines fit and thus
bump all the text in a frame to the next text frame in the chain, the Keep
Options rules are violated, and the last line of text is highlighted.
 When H&J Violations is checked, InDesign uses three shades of yellow
(the darker the shade, the worse the problem) to mark lines that might
be too loose or too tight due to the combination of spacing and hyphen-
ation settings. (H&J refers to hyphenation and justification.) Chapter 15
covers this, too.
Figure 2-4:
The
Composition
pane of the
Preferences
dialog box.
40
Part I: Before You Begin 

 Custom Tracking/Kerning, if checked, highlights custom tracking and
kerning (essentially, anywhere you overrode the defaults) in a bluish
green. Chapter 16 covers kerning and tracking in more detail.
 Substituted Fonts, which is checked by default, uses pink highlights to
indicate characters in fonts that are not available and thus for which
InDesign has substituted a different font. For output purposes, it’s
important that you have the correct fonts, so you typically want to
leave this checked.
 Substituted Glyphs highlights, in pink, any glyphs (special characters)
that were substituted. This usually occurs when you have multiple ver-
sions of the same font, with different special characters in each version.
For example, a file that uses the euro (€) currency symbol might have
been created in the newest version of a font, but a copy editor working
on the same file may have an older version of the font that is missing the
euro symbol.
Setting text-wrap rules
The three options in the Text Wrap area affect how text flows (wraps) around
images and other frames:
 Selecting the Justify Text Next to an Object check box overrides any
local justification settings to make text wrapping around an object
justified. That means the text will smoothly follow the object’s shape,
rather than keep any ragged margins that can make the wrap look
strange. This option comes into play when you wrap ragged (left-
aligned or right-aligned) text around objects.
 Skip by Leading, if checked, uses the text’s leading to determine how
much space follows an object around which text wraps. This effect is
used only if you choose the Jump Object text-wrap option in the Text
Wrap panel (Window➪Text Wrap, or Option+Ô+W or Ctrl+Alt+W).
 Text Wrap Only Affects Text Beneath, if checked, causes only text below
(behind) an object to wrap around that object.
Chapter 17 covers text wrap in detail.
Measurement preferences
The Units & Increments pane, shown in Figure 2-5, is where you choose the
measurement systems for positioning items.
41
Chapter 2: Making It Work Your Way

Ruler Units area
The Ruler Units area affects three things: the origin point (by page, by
spread, or by the spine), the measurement system displayed on the horizon-
tal and vertical rulers in the document window, and the default values in
fields used for positioning objects.
The Origin pop-up menu determines the zero point (typically, the upper-left
corner of the page) for object positions. If you choose Page, the positions of
objects are relative to each page’s upper-left corner. If you choose Spread, the
positions of objects are relative to the current spread’s upper-left corner. If
you choose Spine, objects’ positions are relative to the binding spine of each
spread — the very top and center of where the two pages meet.
With the Vertical and Horizontal pop-up menus, you specify one measure-
ment system for the horizontal ruler and measurements, and the same or dif-
ferent measurement system for the vertical ruler and measurements. For
example, you might use points for horizontal measurements and inches for
vertical measurements.
To specify the measurement systems you want to use, choose an option from
the Horizontal pop-up menu and from the Vertical pop-up menu. You have the
following options:
 Points: A typesetting measurement equal to 1⁄72 of an inch (or 1⁄12 of a
pica). To enter values in points, type a p before the value or pt after the
value (for example, p6 or 6 pt).
Figure 2-5:
The Units &
Increments
pane of the
Preferences
dialog box.
42
Part I: Before You Begin 

 Picas: A typesetting measurement equal to 1⁄6 of an inch. To enter values
in picas, type a p after the value (for example, 6p).
You can combine measurements using both picas and points. Keeping in
mind that 1 pica is equal to 12 points, you can enter 11⁄2 picas as either
1.5p or 1p6.
 Inches: An English measurement system that is divided into 16ths. To
enter values in inches, type i, in, inch, or " after the value. For example,
3i, 3in, 3 inch, and 3" are all read by InDesign as “3 inches.”
 Inches decimal: Inches divided into 10ths on the ruler rather than 16ths.
To enter values in inches decimal, include a decimal point as appropri-
ate and type i, in, inch, or " after the value.
 Agates: Typically used in newspapers, an agate is 1⁄14 of an inch, usually
the depth of a line in the small type of classified ads, stock tables, and
sports statistics boxes. To enter values in agates, type ag after the value.
For example, 10ag.
 Millimeters: A metric measurement that is 1⁄10 of a centimeter. To enter
values in millimeters, type mm after the value. For example, 14mm.
 Centimeters: A metric measurement that is about 1⁄3 of an inch. To enter
values in centimeters, type cm after the value. For example, 2.3cm.
 Ciceros: A European typesetting measurement that is slightly larger than
a pica. To enter values in ciceros, type c after the value. For example, 2c.
 Custom: This option lets you set a customer number of points as your
measurement unit, placing a labeled tick mark at every point increment
you specify. You get to customize the number of tick marks between the
labeled marks by entering a value in the Points field. For example, if you
enter 12 in the field, you get a tick mark at each pica because there are
12 points in a pica. A good way to use this is if you need to have the
rulers show tick marks at whole-line increments; in that case, if your
leading is 8 points, you’d set the Custom field to 8.
Keyboard Increments area
This area lets you customize the way the keyboard arrow keys work. You can
use the arrow keys to move selected objects right, left, up, or down. You can
also use the arrow keys and other keyboard shortcuts to change some text
formatting. The options are
 Cursor Key field: When you select an object with the Selection tool or
the Direct Selection tool, you can move it up, down, left, or right by
using the arrow keys on the keyboard. By default, the item moves 1
point with each key press. You can change the increment to a value
between 0.001 and 8p4 (1.3888 inches). If you use a document grid, you
might change the increment to match the grid lines.
43
Chapter 2: Making It Work Your Way

 Size/Leading field: The value in this field specifies by how many points
the leading or font size is increased or decreased when done with key-
board commands. You can enter a value between 0.001 and 100 (the
default is 2).
 Baseline Shift field: To shift the baseline of highlighted text up or down,
you can click in the Baseline Shift field on the Character panel, and then
click the up or down arrow on the keyboard. The default for the Baseline
Shift increment value is 2 points, which you can change to any value
between 0.001 and 100.
 Kerning field: To kern text with keyboard commands, you position the
cursor between two letters and then Option+press or Alt+press the right
arrow button to increase kerning or the left arrow to decrease kerning.
By default, each click changes kerning by 1⁄50 of an em — shown on
screen as 20/1000 em. You can change this value to anything between 1
and 100, in increments of 1⁄1000 of an em. (An em is a space the width of a
capital M, a commonly used space in professional typography.)
Document defaults
InDesign also lets you change the default page size, margins, and columns in
new documents; the default attributes of guides; and the way layouts are
adjusted. You don’t modify these settings in the Preferences dialog box;
instead, to modify document defaults, first make sure that no documents are
open and then choose the following:
 File➪Document Setup (Option+Ô+P or Ctrl+Alt+P). The Document
Setup dialog box lets you change the default settings in the New
Document dialog box for the Number of Pages, Page Size, Facing Pages,
and Master Text Frame, as well as for bleeds and slugs if you click the
More Options button.
 Layout➪Margins and Columns. The Margins and Columns dialog box
lets you change the default settings in the New Document dialog box for
the Margins and Columns areas.
 Layout➪Ruler Guides. This opens the Ruler Guides dialog box where
you adjust the View Threshold and Color for all new guides.
 Layout➪Layout Adjustment. The Layout Adjustment dialog box lets you
resize entire layouts and modify how they are resized.
If you are unhappy with the preferences and defaults you have established,
you can revert InDesign to all its default settings. To revert all preferences
and defaults, press Control+Option+Shift+Ô or Ctrl+Alt+Shift when launching
InDesign.
44
Part I: Before You Begin 

Modifying Defaults for Text and Objects
When you create a new document, start typing, or create a new object, your
work conforms to default settings. You can change these settings. For exam-
ple, by default, a new document is always letter-sized, but if you design only
posters, you can change the default.
You may need to work with InDesign for a while to figure out which settings
you prefer. When you identify a problem — for example, you realize that you
always end up changing the inset for text frames — jot down a note about it
or close all documents right then. When no documents are open, change the
setting for all future documents.
45
Chapter 2: Making It Work Your Way
Working with stored preferences
Some preferences in InDesign are stored in files
that you can share with other users, so the pref-
erences can be consistently used in a work-
group. These include keyboard shortcut sets,
color swatch libraries, document setups, work-
spaces, and scripts.
Some of these stored preferences — such as
document setups and printing setups — are
called presets, and the files that store them
reside in the Presets folder within the InDesign
application folder. When you save a preset,
InDesign automatically updates the presets file.
You can then copy that preset file to another
user’s Presets folder.
To create presets, look for menu items with the
word preset in them — examples are Adobe PDF
Presets, Document Presets, and Print Presets in
the File menu; and Transparency Flattener
Presets in the Edit menu. Also look for the Save
Preset option in some dialog boxes. To use a
preset, look for a pop-up menu with the word
preset in them in dialog boxes; for example, you
would use the Document Preset pop-up menu in
the New Document dialog box to create a new
document using a specific preset’s settings.
InDesign has other types of stored preferences
whose settings are also stored in separate files,
also stored in the Presets folder. But you won’t
see options labeled Presets in the InDesign user
interface to work with them. These stored pref-
erences include Keyboard Shortcuts, Menus,
and Color Profiles options in the Edit menu and
the Workspace option in the Window menu. You
can share these settings by copying them to
other users’ Presets folders.
Another kind of preference is typically stored as
part of a document: master pages, text variable,
color swatches, and the various types of text,
stroke, and object styles available through a
series of panels. These preferences can be
imported from other documents using the Load
command in the various panels’ flyout menus
and in some dialog boxes. Most presets — such
as document presets, print presets, trap pre-
sets, and Adobe PDF presets — can also be
loaded and saved this same way. In addition,
color swatches can be saved to files to be
shared with other Adobe applications using a
Save Swatches command in the Swatches
panel’s flyout menu.

Text defaults
When you start typing in a new text frame, the text is formatted with default
formats and attributes. You can also choose to show invisible characters
such as spaces and tabs by default; otherwise, you need to manually activate
character visibility in each text-heavy document. To modify text defaults:
 Choose default options for character formats such as Font Family, Font
Size, and Leading from the Character panel. Choose Type➪Character
(Ô+T or Ctrl+T).
 Choose defaults for paragraph formats, such as alignment, indents,
spacing, and so on, from the Paragraph panel. Choose Type➪Paragraph
(Option+Ô+T or Ctrl+Alt+T).
 Choose defaults for the [Basic Paragraph] style, which is what all
unstyled imported text, as well as text entered in a new text frame in
InDesign, will use. Choose Type➪Paragraph Styles (Ô+F11 or Ctrl+F11).
 Activate Optical Margin Alignment. Choose Type➪Story. This adjusts
the left position of characters along the left margin to make the left
edges look more pleasing, by letting the top of a T, for example, hang
slightly to the left of the margin, even if that means the characters aren’t
strictly aligned. (Because Optical Margin Alignment works best for dis-
play type rather than body type, it’s unlikely that you’ll activate optical
margin alignment as your default setting.)
 Show Hidden Characters is a good thing to activate if you always end up
turning on Show Hidden Characters when you are editing a document.
Choose Type➪Show Hidden Characters (Ô+Option+I or Ctrl+Alt+I).
Hidden characters are spaces, tabs, and so forth that print “blank” but
that you may want to see on-screen to make sure you have the right char-
acter in use. InDesign has a unique on-screen symbol for every kind of
space, tab, indent-to-here, and other such “blank” characters.
Object defaults
When you create new objects, they’re based on default settings. For example,
you can specify how text wraps around objects. To modify object defaults,
use the following commands:
 Specify the default Columns, Inset Spacing, First Baseline, and Ignore
Text Wrap settings for new text frames using the Text Frame Options
dialog box. Choose Object➪Text Frame Options (Ô+B or Ctrl+B).
 Choose defaults for the [Normal Graphics Frame] and [Normal Text
Frame] styles, which are what all new frames created in InDesign will
use. Choose Window➪Object Styles (Ô+F7 or Ctrl+F7).
46
Part I: Before You Begin 

 Specify how text will wrap around all new objects. Choose Window➪
Text Wrap (Ô+Option+W or Ctrl+Alt+W).
 Choose a style for the corners of all new frames except those created
with the Type tool. Choose Object➪Corner Options (Ô+Option+R or
Ctrl+Alt+R).
 Specify the default attributes of clipping paths imported into graphics
frames. Choose Object➪Clipping Path.
 Specify other default properties of objects. For example, if all objects
you create are stroked (framed), specify a weight in the Stroke panel.
Choose Window➪Stroke (Ô+F10 or Ctrl+F10), Window➪Swatches (F5),
Window➪Gradient (F6), or Window➪Attributes.
 Specify the default number of sides and the inset for the first new
polygon in a new document. Double-click the Polygon or Polygon
Frame tool to open the Polygon Settings dialog box (there is no menu
command or keyboard shortcut).
Modifying Defaults for Views
You can also control which layout tools display by default. Selections in the
View menu let you do this. If you prefer not to view the edges of frames, you
can hide them by default. Or if you always want to start with a document-
wide grid (see Chapter 11), you can show that by default. Other defaults you
can modify in the View menu include
 Show the links between text frames. Choose View➪Show Text Threads
(Option+Ô+Y or Ctrl+Alt+Y).
 Hide the edges of frames. Choose View➪Hide Frame Edges
(Control+Ô+H or Ctrl+H).
The Mac shortcut for showing and hiding text frames has changed to
Control+Ô+H in InDesign CS3, from just Ô+H in previous versions. The
Windows shortcut (Ctrl+H) is unchanged.
 Hide the horizontal and vertical ruler. Choose View➪Hide Rulers (Ô+R
or Ctrl+R).
 Hide margin, column, and layout guides. View➪Grids & Guides➪Hide
Guides (Ô+; [semicolon] or Ctrl+; [semicolon]).
 Show the baseline grid established in the Grids pane of the Preferences
dialog box. Choose View➪Grids & Guides➪Show Baseline Grid (Option+
Ô+' [apostrophe] or Ctrl+Alt+' [apostrophe]).
 Show the document-wide grid established in the Grids pane of the
Preferences dialog box. Choose View➪Grids & Guides➪Show Document
Grid (Ô+' [apostrophe] or Ctrl+' [apostrophe]).
47
Chapter 2: Making It Work Your Way

InDesign has another place to set view settings: in the Pages panel’s flyout
menu, choose View➪Show/Hide Master Items. When you choose Show
Master Items, any objects on the currently displayed document page’s master
page are displayed. When you choose Hide Master Items, master objects on
the currently displayed page are hidden. This command is page-specific, so
you can show or hide master objects on a page-by-page basis.
Adding Default Colors and Styles
If you are a creature of habit, you may find yourself creating the same colors,
paragraph styles, character styles, and object styles over and over again.
Save yourself some steps by creating these features when no documents are
open; when you do so, the features will be available to all future documents.
To set up these often-used items, use the New command in the flyout menus
for the following panels: Swatches (F5), Character Styles (Shift+Ô+F11 or
Ctrl+Shift+F11), Paragraph Styles (Ô+F11 or Ctrl+F11), and Object Styles
(Ô+F7 or Ctrl+F7). You can also use the flyout menus’ Load commands to
import colors and styles from existing documents instead of creating them
from scratch.
Chapter 7 covers color swatches, Chapter 10 covers object styles, and
Chapter 14 covers character and paragraph styles in more detail.

Document
Essentials

In this part . . .
T
he reader sees your text and images, but as a 
layout artist, you know there’s a lot more going on
behind the scenes. Your documents contain all sorts of
elements — the publishing equivalent of the girders and
beams and so forth of a building — that are essential to
delivering the final text and graphics. This part covers
those document essentials, showing you how to work with
the document files, pages, layers, templates, libraries, and
sections — the basic organizing elements and containers.
You’ll also discover how to create colors that you can use
over and over again.

Opening and Saving Your Work
In This Chapter
 Creating a new document
 Opening documents
 Saving and exporting documents
 Exporting document content
 Recovering information after a crash
You’re eager to create a new document and get started with InDesign. So
you launch InDesign, create or open a new document, and begin work-
ing. Right? Wrong, sort of. You can just plunge in, but you’re best served if
you have an idea before you start of what you want to accomplish. That way,
you won’t be staring at a blank screen with no brilliant ideas in mind.
After you have an idea of what you want to do, you need to create the docu-
ment that will hold those brilliant ideas. InDesign lets you apply those ideas
from the very start of creating the document, and also lets you make changes
later on, as you refine your ideas.
This chapter shows you the basics of working with document files, from cre-
ating and opening them to saving them.
Setting Up a New Publication
After you launch InDesign, you have two options: You can choose File➪Open
(or press Ô+O or Ctrl+O) to open a previously created document or template,
or you can choose File➪New➪Document (or press Ô+N or Ctrl+N) to create a
new document.

Creating a new document is where all the fun is because you get to create
something yourself, from scratch. Here’s how to create a new document:
1. Choose File➪New➪Document or press Ô+N or Ctrl+N.
The New Document dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3-1. It is here
that you will have to make many up-front decisions about how you want
your new document set up — including page size, number of pages,
number of columns, and margin width. Although you’re free to change
your mind later, you’ll save yourself time and potential headaches by
sticking with the basic page parameters you establish in the New
Document dialog box.
2. If you know exactly how many pages your publication will have, enter
the number in the Number of Pages field.
If you don’t know for sure, you can always add or delete pages later. Just
guesstimate: It’s easy to add or delete pages later.
3. Decide whether to lay out your documents in a spread or as separate
pages.
• If you’re creating a multi-page publication that will have a spine,
such as a book, catalog, or magazine, select Facing Pages.
• If you’re creating a one-page document, such as a business card, an
ad, or a poster, don’t select Facing Pages.
• Some publications, such as flip charts, presentations, and three-
ring bound documents, have multiple pages but use only one side
of the page. For such documents, don’t check Facing Pages, either.

4. If you want to flow text from page to page in a multi-page document,
such as a book or a catalog, check Master Text Frame.
If you check this box, InDesign automatically adds a text frame to the
document’s master page and to all document pages based on this
master page. Doing this saves you the work of creating a text frame on
each page and manually threading text through each frame. (See
Chapter 6 for more information about using master text frames.)
5. In the Page Size area, you can choose one of the predefined sizes from
the pop-up menu.
6. Specify margin values in the Margins area.
If Facing Pages is checked, Inside and Outside fields are available in the
Margins area. Designers often specify larger inside margins for multi-
page publications to accommodate the fold at the spine. If Facing Pages
is not checked, Left and Right fields replace the Inside and Outside
fields. You can also specify margin values by clicking the up/down
arrows associated with the fields.
7. To specify how many columns your pages have, enter a value in the
Columns field.
You can also specify the number of columns by clicking the up/down
arrows associated with the Column field.
8. Specify a gutter distance (the gutter is the space between columns) in
the Gutter field.
You can also specify a gutter width value by clicking the up/down
arrows associated with the Gutter field.
9. Click the More Options button to access the Bleed and Slug area of the
New Document dialog box (refer to Figure 3-1 to see the Bleed and
Slug area).
Clicking the More Options button provides options to set bleed and slug
areas. (Note that the button then changes to Fewer Options.) A bleed
area is a margin on the outside of the page for objects you want to extend
past the edge of the page — you want them to extend at least 1⁄8 inch so if
there is any shifting of the paper during printing, there’s no white space
where the image should be (touching the edge of the page). The slug area
is an area reserved for printing crop marks, color plate names, and other
such printing information — some output devices will cut these off
during printing unless a slug area is defined. For both bleed and slug
areas, you can set the top, bottom, left, and right margins independently.
10. Click OK to close the New Document dialog box.
Your new, blank document appears in a new document window. Figure 3-2
shows the window of a newly created document that uses the settings
shown in Figure 3-1.

Chapter 3: Opening and Saving Your Work

You can bypass the New Document dialog box by pressing Shift+Ô+N or
Ctrl+Shift+N. When you use this method, the most recent settings in the New
Document dialog box are used for the new document.
Opening documents
Opening documents with InDesign is pretty much the same as opening docu-
ments with any program. Simply choose File➪Open (or press Ô+O or Ctrl+O),
select the document you want to work on, and then click the Open button.
But InDesign offers a few options for opening documents that you don’t find
in every program. For example, you can
 Open more than one document at a time.
 Open a copy of a document instead of the original. This keeps the orig-
inal file from being overwritten accidentally — very helpful if you’re
making several variations of one document.
 Open a template under its own name. This makes editing templates
easier than it is with other programs, specifically QuarkXPress.
 Open documents created with Versions 6.0, 6.5, and 7.0 of PageMaker
and Versions 3.3, 4.0, and 4.1 of both QuarkXPress and QuarkXPress
Passport.

Opening InDesign files
To open an InDesign file (any version from 1.0 to CS3), follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Open, or press Ô+O or Ctrl+O.
The Open a File dialog box, shown in Figures 3-3 and 3-4, appears. The
Open a File dialog box will differ based on whether you are using
Adobe’s Version Cue file-management system or the standard Mac or
Windows interface. The sidebar “Banishing Version Cue” later in this
chapter explains how to turn Version Cue off.
55
Chapter 3: Opening and Saving Your Work
Banishing Version Cue
Adobe’s Version Cue feature is meant to help
people collaborate in a workgroup, so you can
share a master file with multiple people, each
working on it in turn. Version Cue even lets you
save different versions of a file, so you can
experiment and then decide which one to keep.
But Version Cue is complicated and difficult to
use for beginners. If you find it unwieldy, you can
accomplish its basic functions simply by saving
common files to a network server and saving
new versions with slightly different names, so
you can later choose the version you want.
InDesign turns Version Cue on for you automati-
cally within InDesign. But that won’t really affect
you unless Version Cue is also turned on for your
computer — when it’s turned on in both places,
you’ll see Version Cue options in your Open a File,
Export, and Save dialog boxes; you’ll also see the
Check In menu option become available in the
File menu. To get rid of Version Cue, just choose
InDesign➪Preferences➪File Handling or press
Ô+K on the Mac, or choose Edit➪Preferences➪
File Handling or press Ctrl+K in Windows, and
then uncheck the Enable Version Cue option.
Click OK. Voilà! Version Cue is disabled within all
your Adobe Creative Suite 3 software.
If other people in your workgroup are using
Version Cue, you might also go to the Macintosh
System Preferences dialog box (Ú➪System
Preferences) or the Windows Control Panel
(Start➪Control Panel➪Classic View in the
Windows XP and Windows Vista interface, or
Start➪Settings➪Control Panels in the Classic
Start menu interface) and double-click the
Adobe Version Cue CS3 iconic button. Clicking
that button opens a pane that has an option to
turn off the Version Cue server. (Click Stop to
disable the server immediately, and uncheck
the Turn On Server When the Computer Starts
option to keep it off when you next start up your
computer.) This prevents your computer from
being a server to other Version Cue users on the
network, so they cannot work on your files.
In some cases, you might want to leave Version
Cue on (maybe because you use it occasionally
in a workgroup setting) but not use its unique
dialog boxes for opening, saving, exporting, and
importing until you’re ready to use the Version
Cue tools. That’s also easy: First, make sure
Version Cue is turned on within InDesign and for
your computer. Then click the Use OS Dialog
button in the Open a File, Save As, Export As,
Load, and other dialog boxes that work with file-
names. Clicking OS Dialog brings you to the stan-
dard Mac or Windows dialog boxes, which will
continue to display until you later click Use
Adobe Dialog button in any of those dialog boxes.
Clicking the Use Adobe Dialog button in any of
those dialog boxes brings back the Version Cue
interface for all of those dialog boxes. Note that
these dialog box changes affect only InDesign
CS3, not your other Adobe software.

This book’s screen shots assume that you are not using Version Cue, so
this is the only time I’ll show you the Version Cue interface.
When I do show Windows screens, I’ll show them in Windows XP only,
unless the Windows Vista screen is radically different. In practically
every case, though, InDesign in Windows Vista looks just like it does in
Windows XP, except for colors and slight adjustments where elements
are placed in some dialog boxes such as Open a File and Save.

2. Locate and open the folder that contains the document(s) you want
to open.
Select a single filename or hold down the Ô or Ctrl key and select multi-
ple filenames.
In Windows, the Files of Type pop-up menu offers several options:
PageMaker 6.0–7.0 files, QuarkXPress 3.3–4.1 files, InDesign files,
InDesign Interchange, Adobe PDF Creation Settings Files, and All
Formats. Choose any of these options to display a specific file format in
the file list. (The Adobe PDF Creation Settings Files option is for experts,
so don’t worry about it for now.)

Chapter 3: Opening and Saving Your Work

On a Mac, the Open a File dialog box will display any supported file
formats that have a filename extension, and the dialog box includes a
Preview pane that displays a thumbnail version of the selected file or,
more commonly, its icon. Use All Documents in the Enable pop-up menu
to display files without the expected filename extensions (typically,
those transferred or copied from a computer running Mac OS 9).
In Windows, the Open a File dialog box will display any supported file
formats that have a supported filename extension. Use All Files in the
Files of Type pop-up menu to display files with no filename extensions
(typically, these are files created on an older version of the Mac OS).
3. Select Open Normal at the bottom of the dialog box to open the original
version of the document or a copy of a template; click Open Original to
open the original version of the document or of a template; click Open
Copy if you just want to open a copy of it. (Chapter 6 covers templates.)
In Windows, the options are labeled simply Normal, Original, and Copy,
and appear under the Open As label.
When you open a copy of a document, it’s assigned a default name
(Untitled-1, Untitled-2, and so on).
4. Click OK to close the dialog box.
Each document you opened is displayed in a separate document window.
The page and view magnification used when the document was last saved
is also used when you open the document. (Chapter 1 covers document
views.)
An alternative approach is to choose File➪Browse to open the Adobe Bridge
program, which provides an alternative way to find files on your computer.
Bridge is an expert feature that most InDesign users — even advanced
ones — never use. Its biggest attraction is that it lets you see previews
of almost all files you’d be working with in your layouts. But if you’re a
Photoshop user, you may be a big fan and therefore be comfortable using
it for InDesign files as well.
Opening foreign formats
One of InDesign’s hallmarks is its ability to open documents from other pro-
grams and convert them into InDesign documents. You can open documents
created in PageMaker 6.0, 6.5, and 7.0 as well as QuarkXPress and QuarkXPress
Passport 3.3, 4.0, and 4.1. (Chapters 28 and 29 cover conversion issues in
greater detail.)
58
Part II: Document Essentials 

But beware: InDesign’s ability to open a foreign-format file doesn’t mean you
get a perfect translation. The other programs’ formats and capabilities are so
different from InDesign’s that you should expect to spend time cleaning up
the converted files by hand. In some cases, you might find that the amount of
cleanup work is greater than if you simply re-create the document from
scratch in InDesign — don’t panic when this is the case. And be happy when
your documents convert effortlessly. The good news is that InDesign will
alert you to any import issues of PageMaker and QuarkXPress files with a
dialog box that appears after the import is complete, as Figure 3-5 shows.
Saving documents
When you open a new document, it’s assigned a default name — Untitled-1,
Untitled-2, and so on — and the first page is displayed in the document
window. At this point, you’re like a painter in front of a blank canvas. You can
work on your layout without giving it a name, but it’s best to give it a name
by saving it as soon as possible so you don’t lose any changes to a power
outage or other system problem.
The second group of commands in InDesign’s File menu — Close, Save, Save
As, Save a Copy, Check In, and Revert — provide options for saving the active
(frontmost) document. Here’s a rundown of what each command does:
 Close (Ô+W, or Ctrl+W or Ctrl+F4) closes the active document. If the
document has never been saved or if it has been changed since it was
last saved, a dialog box lets you save, close without saving, or cancel
and return to the document.
Figure 3-5:
InDesign
shows a
Warnings
dialog box if

formats.
59
Chapter 3: Opening and Saving Your Work

To close multiple windows at once, use the shortcuts Option+Shift+Ô+F4
or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+W.
 Save (Ô+S or Ctrl+S) saves changes you’ve made to the active document
since you last saved. (If you choose Save for a document that hasn’t yet
been saved, the Save As dialog box is displayed.)
 Save As (Option+Ô+S or Ctrl+Alt+S) lets you save a copy of the active
document using a different name (or with the same name in a different
folder). When you choose Save As — and when you choose Save for an
unsaved document — the Save As dialog box, shown in Figure 3-6,
appears. This dialog box lets you create or choose a folder for the docu-
ment, as well as name the document.
 Check In saves the current document as a version within a Version Cue
project. This latest save will be considered a version of the previously
saved file. (This expert option is available only if Version Cue is enabled.
It had been called Save a Version in previous versions of InDesign.)
 Save a Copy lets you create a copy of the active document in a different
(or in the same) folder using a different (or the same) name. When you
use the Save a Copy command, the original document remains open and
retains its original name. It differs from Save As only in that it keeps the
original document open.
 Revert undoes all changes you’ve made to a document since you last
saved it.
Exporting document content
InDesign’s Save commands (Save, Save As, and Save a Copy) let you save doc-
uments and templates in InDesign’s native file format. But the Export com-
mand (File➪Export) lets you save the stories — and in some cases stories
and whole layouts — from InDesign documents in several formats: InDesign
Interchange, Rich Text Format (RTF), Text Only, InDesign Tagged Text,
Encapsulated PostScript (EPS), Portable Document Format (PDF), JPEG, and
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).
Note that when exporting a file, you need to choose a format from the Format
menu (Mac) or Save as Type menu (Windows).

Chapter 3: Opening and Saving Your Work

Here are your format options in more detail:
 InDesign Interchange format: You can make your InDesign CS3 files
readable by InDesign CS2 users by saving your files in the InDesign
Interchange format. (Only InDesign CS2 and CS3 can open InDesign
CS3’s Interchange files. Similarly, InDesign CS3 can open only
InDesign CS2 Interchange and CS3 Interchange files, as well as any
version of regular InDesign document files.)
 Word-processing formats: If you place the text cursor into a story, you
can export its text (select a range of text if you want to export only that
selection) into one of two formats: RTF, for import into word processors
with only basic formatting retained; and Text Only, for import into word
processors that don’t support RTF (with Text Only, note that no format-
ting is retained).
You can save only one text file at a time. If you need to export several
stories from the same document, you must do so one at a time.
 InDesign workflow formats: If text is selected via the Type tool, you can
save the story in the InDesign Tagged Text format (for editing in a word
processor and later reimporting into InDesign CS3 with all InDesign for-
matting retained) or in the InDesign CS Interchange format (for import
into InDesign CS2).
 Production formats: If text or a frame is selected via the Type tool or
the Direct Selection tool, you can save the document — not just the
story — in EPS or PDF formats for use by prepress tools and service
bureaus or for import into other applications as pictures.
 Online formats: If text or a frame is selected via the Type tool or the
Direct Selection tool, you can save the document — not just the story —
in XML format for use in online database-oriented content-management
systems, as well as a specific page, spread, or text selection into JPEG or
SVG formats for use as online graphics.
Two separate options are available for the entire document (no matter what
tool is active) or for whatever objects are selected. One is File➪Cross-Media
Export➪XHTML/Dreamweaver, which lets you export InDesign layouts to the
structured HTML format for use in Web creation programs such as (but not lim-
ited to) Adobe Dreamweaver. The other is File➪Cross-Media-Export➪XHTML/
Digital Editions, which lets you create a new type of online multimedia docu-
ment, called an e-book. You can also export XML files by choosing File➪
Cross-Media-Export➪XML, as well as by using the regular Export dialog box
(File-.Export). All three are expert features that are beyond the scope of this
book.
62
Part II: Document Essentials 

Recovering from Disaster
Make sure that when you work on InDesign documents, you follow the first
rule of safe computing: Save early and often.
InDesign includes an automatic-recovery feature that protects your docu-
ments in the event of a power failure or a system crash. As you work on a
document, any changes you make after saving it are stored in a separate, tem-
porary file. Under normal circumstances, each time you choose Save, the
information in the temporary file is saved to the document file. The data in
the temporary file is important only if you aren’t able to save a document
before a crash. (A word of warning: Although InDesign’s automatic recovery
feature is a nice safety net, you should still be careful to save your work
often.) If you suffer a system crash, follows these steps to recover your most
recent changes:
1. Relaunch InDesign or, if necessary, restart your computer and then
launch InDesign.
2. If automatic-recovery data is available, InDesign automatically opens
the recovered document and displays the word “Recovered” in the
document’s title bar.
This lets you know that the document contains changes that were not
included in the last saved version.
3. If you want to save the recovered data, choose File➪Save;
“Recovered” is removed as part of the filename, and InDesign asks if
you want to overwrite the old file.
Overwriting the old file is easier than using File➪Save As and entering a
name — unless you do want to save a copy of the file in case you want
to go back to the old version later. If you want to use the last saved ver-
sion of the document (and disregard the recovered data), close the file
(File➪Close, or Ô+W or Ctrl+W) without saving, and then open the file
(File➪Open, or Ô+O or Ctrl+O).
Sometimes, InDesign can’t automatically recover the documents for you.
Instead, it gives you the choice of recovering any files open during a crash or
power outage, saving the recovery data for later, or deleting the recovery
data. You typically want to recover the files immediately.

Discovering How Pages Work
In This Chapter

 Adjusting page layouts and objects
I
t’s a rare InDesign user who creates only one-page documents. Even if you
spend your time working on business cards, ads, and posters, you proba-
bly produce at least a few multi-page documents. And if you create newslet-
ters, newspapers, books, catalogs, or any other such multi-page publications,
you must know how to add pages to your document, move pages around if
you change your mind, and delete pages if necessary. InDesign also lets you
divide multi-page documents into independently numbered sections.
As documents grow in size, getting around can be a real drag — on your time,
that is. The longer you spend getting to the page you want, the less time you
have to work on it. Fortunately, InDesign provides several navigation aids
that make it easy to move around on a page or in a document.
Understanding the Pages Panel
The Pages panel is where you do most of your page actions, so you get to
know it better as you use InDesign more.
If you intend to create a multi-page document, you want to display the Pages
panel (Window➪Pages, or Ô+F12 or Ctrl+F12), shown in Figure 4-1, because it
provides the controls that let you add pages (both document and master),
delete and move pages, apply master pages to document pages, and navigate
through a document.
The shortcut for accessing the Pages panel has changed to Ô+F12 or Ctrl+F12
in InDesign CS3 from just F12 in previous versions. But you can also still use
F12, though that might conflict with Apple’s Exposé software on the Mac.

For more information about using the Pages panel to work on master pages,
see Chapter 6.
Keep in mind that the overwhelming majority of multi-page documents are
facing-pages publications such as books, catalogs, and magazines. Some
exceptions are flip charts and three-hole-punched publications printed on
only one side. In this chapter, the figures show examples of a facing-pages
document. If you create a single-sided multi-page document, the techniques
are the same as for facing-pages documents, but the icons in the Pages panel
show only single-sided page icons (the icons aren’t dog-eared).
Adding pages
A document can contain as many as 9,999 pages — more than anyone would
ever want to have in one file. In general, try to break up long publications into
logical pieces. For example, if you’re creating a book, it’s a good idea to
create separate documents for the front matter, each chapter, the index, and
any other parts (appendixes and so on). Also, if you’re producing a long doc-
ument, you want to take advantage of master pages (covered in Chapter 6),
which save you the work of building each page from scratch.
When you create a multi-page document, you’re free to add however many
pages you want. But be careful: Even though InDesign will let you create a
seven-page newsletter, in real life, facing-page publications always have an
even number of pages — usually a multiple of 4 and often a multiple of 16 —
because of the way printers arrange multiple pages on a single sheet of paper
before folding and cutting them into the final document.
Figure 4-1:

panel and

66
Part II: Document Essentials 

Here’s how to add pages to a document:
1. If it’s not displayed, open the Pages panel by choosing
Window➪Pages or pressing Ô+F12 or Ctrl+F12.
2. From the Pages panel’s flyout menu, choose Insert Pages.
The Insert Pages dialog box, shown in Figure 4-2, appears.
3. In the Pages field, type the number of pages you want to add.
4. Select an option from the Insert pop-up menu: After Page, Before
Page, At Start of Document, or At End of Document.
Be careful: If you’ve already started working on page 1, for example,
make sure you add new pages after page 1. Otherwise, it won’t be page 1
anymore, and you’ll have to move the objects you already created.
5. Type a page number in the field next to Insert or use the arrows to
increase or decrease the value in one-page increments.
6. From the Master pop-up menu, select the master page you want to
apply to the new pages.
7. When you’re finished, click OK to close the dialog box.
InDesign offers a faster way to add and manipulate pages if you don’t happen
to have the Pages panel already open: Choose Layout➪Pages, and then select
the appropriate option, such as Add Pages, from the submenu. The resulting
dialog boxes match those accessed from the Pages panel.
If you want to quickly add just one page after the current page, click Layout➪
Pages➪Add Page or just press Shift+Ô+P or Ctrl+Shift+P.
You can also add new pages or spreads one at a time at the end of a docu-
ment by clicking the Create New Page iconic button at the bottom of the
Pages panel. (Spreads are added if a spread is selected in the Pages panel.)
When you use this method, the master page applied to the last document
page is applied to each new page. Pages are added after the currently
selected page in the panel.
You can also click and drag a master page icon (or both pages in a facing-
pages spread to add a spread) from the top of the Pages panel to add a page
using a master page’s settings (use the [None] page for a plain page) between
Figure 4-2:
The Insert
Pages
dialog box.
67
Chapter 4: Discovering How Pages Work

any pair of document page spreads or to the right of the last document
spread. If a vertical bar appears when you release the mouse button, the
spread is placed between the spreads on either side of the bar. If a vertical
bar does not appear between document page spreads when you release the
mouse button, the new spread is placed at the end of the document.
When you insert an uneven number of new pages into a facing-pages docu-
ment, existing pages are automatically changed from left-hand pages to right-
hand pages, and vice versa. You can prevent this for selected spreads by first
selecting them in the Pages panel and then clicking Keep Spread Together in
the flyout menu. You might do this for a spread, such as a two-page table, that
you don’t want to have broken apart when other pages are added or deleted.
Of course, for proper printing, you might need to move that spread when
you’re done adding or deleting pages so that it follows a complete spread.
Selecting pages
InDesign offers several choices for selecting pages from a document, so you
can move, delete, copy, or otherwise manipulate them:
 Click a page’s icon in the Pages panel to select it.
 To select both pages in a spread, the easiest way is to click a spread’s
page numbers to select both pages.
 To select a range of pages, you can click a page icon or spread number
beneath it and then Shift+click another page icon or spread number.
 To select multiple, noncontiguous pages, hold down the Ô or Ctrl key
and click page icons or spread numbers.
InDesign CS3 now shows a preview image of your pages in the Pages panel.
You can control the display by choosing Panel Options from the panel’s
flyout menu. In the Panel Options dialog box, select the desired icon size and
make sure Show Thumbnails is checked. You can also set separate view set-
tings for master pages.
Copying pages
You can copy pages from one document to another by clicking and dragging
the page icon(s) from the source document’s Pages panel to the target docu-
ment’s Pages panel. Any master page(s) associated with the copied docu-
ment pages(s) are copied as well.
68
Part II: Document Essentials 

You can also duplicate the current spread within the current document by
clicking Duplicate Spread from the Pages panel’s flyout menu or by choosing
Layout➪Pages➪Duplicate Spread.
Deleting pages
The fastest way to delete selected pages is either click and drag them to the
pane’s Delete Selected Pages button (the trashcan icon) or simply click the
Delete Selected Pages button.
Moving pages within documents
To move a page within a document, drag its icon between two spreads or
between the pages of a spread inside the Pages panel. A vertical bar indicates
where the selected page will be placed. Release the mouse button when the
vertical bar is where you want to move the page. To move a spread, drag the
page numbers beneath the icons (rather than the page icons themselves).
InDesign now automatically scrolls the Pages panel’s pages as you move
pages up or down. Before, you had to enlarge the panel so the location you
wanted to drag the pages to was visible. That was a real pain that thankfully
has gone away.
Alternatively, you can select the pages you want to move in the Pages panel
and then choose Move Pages from the Pages panel’s flyout menu. (If you
don’t want to work through the Pages panel, you can also choose
Layout➪Pages➪Move Pages.) In that dialog box, you can specify where to
move the pages: after a specific page, before a specific page, at the beginning
of the document, or at the end of the document.
Although you can move pages around in a document, do so only with great
care — if at all. Generally, if you want to move the objects on one page to
another page, it’s safer to cut (Edit➪Cut or Ô+X or Ctrl+X) or copy
(Edit➪Copy, or Ô+C or Ctrl+C) the objects than to move the page, which
might cause subsequent pages to shuffle.
What’s the big deal about shuffling? Shuffling will move pages around to make
space for the moved page, and that can move what had been left-hand pages
to the right-hand side of the spread and vice versa. If you have different align-
ments on left and right pages — such as having page numbers on the outside
of pages — this shuffling can wreak havoc with that alignment.
If you absolutely must move a single page, it’s safer to move its spread. (Of
course, if you’re working on a single-sided facing-page document, shuffling is
not an issue.)
69
Chapter 4: Discovering How Pages Work

Moving pages among documents
You can also copy or move pages to other documents. Select the page in the
Pages panel, and then drag its icon to the document you want to copy or
move it to.
New to InDesign CS3 is the Insert Pages dialog box that appears, giving you a
choice of where to insert the page in the new document as well as whether to
copy or move the page into the new document. (In previous versions,
InDesign just copied the page in front of the current one.) To move a page
rather than copy it, be sure to check the Delete Pages After Inserting option.
Alternatively you can copy or move pages among documents by choosing
Layout➪Pages➪Move Pages, or by choosing Move Pages from Pages panel’s
flyout menu, either of which opens the Move Pages dialog box. Here, you also
can select the destination (at which page number to insert the new pages)
and — new in InDesign CS3 — which document you want to move the page
into via the Move to pop-up menu. (The document must be open to display in
that pop-up menu.) To move a page rather than copy it, be sure to check the
Delete Pages After Moving option.
Figure 4-3 shows both the Insert Pages and Move Pages dialog boxes.
Starting documents on a left page
By default, InDesign starts all documents on the right page, which makes
sense because the first sheet in a document is always a right-hand page. But

Part II: Document Essentials 

sometimes you want documents to start on a left-hand page, particularly if
they are a chapter or section in a larger document. For example, magazine
articles often start on a left page, giving the introduction a full spread. To
start a document on a left page:
1. Select the first page in the Pages panel and then choose Numbering &
Section Options from the panel’s flyout menu or choose
Layout➪Numbering & Section Options.
2. Select the Start Section option.
3. Select the Start Page Numbering At option and enter an even number
in the field.
4. Click OK.
The Pages panel will update, showing the start page on the left of the
spine.
You may not want to assign a starting page number (for example, if the
starting page number is unknown because the number of pages that pre-
cede this document is unknown and you let the book feature determine
the page numbers later). In this case, repeat Step 1, but deselect Start
Section. Doing so leaves the page as a left-hand page but let the book
feature figure out the page number.
See Chapter 23 for more information on the book feature and long-document
creation. Sections are covered later in this chapter.
Working with Page Numbers
By default, pages are numbered automatically starting at 1, but you can change
the page numbering from Arabic numerals to Roman numerals or letters, as
well as change the start page to something other than 1. To do so, select the
first page in the document in the Pages panel and choose Layout➪Numbering
& Sections or choose Numbering & Section Options from the Pages panel’s
flyout menu. You get the dialog box shown in Figure 4-4. (If the current page is
not the first page in the document and if a section had not been applied to this
page previously, the dialog box is called New Section. Its options are identical.)
To change the initial page number, select the Start Page Numbering At option
and type a new starting page number in its field. To change the page number-
ing style from the default of Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3, 4 . . .), use the Style pop-
up menu and choose from I, II, III, IV . . . ; i, ii, iii, iv . . . ; A, B, C, D . . . ; and a,
b, c, d . . . .
To have a facing-pages document start on a left-hand page, the starting page
number must be even.

Chapter 4: Discovering How Pages Work

Dividing a document into sections
Some long documents are divided into parts that are numbered separately. For
example, the page numbers of book introductions often use Roman numerals,
while standard Arabic numerals are used for the body of the book. If the book
has appendixes, a separate numbering scheme could be applied to these
pages. In InDesign, such independently numbered parts are referred to as
sections.
A multi-page document can contain as many sections as you want (a section
has to contain at least one page). If each section of a document uses a differ-
ent page layout, you probably want to create a different master page for each
section. Here’s how to create a section:
1. If it’s not displayed, open the Pages panel by choosing Window➪
Pages or pressing Ô+F12 or Ctrl+F12.
2. Click the icon of the page where you want to start a section.
3. Choose Numbering & Section Options from the panel’s flyout menu.
If you’ve selected the document’s first page, the Numbering & Section
Options dialog box appears (refer to Figure 4-4). Otherwise, the identical
New Section dialog box appears. By default, the Start Section option is
selected. Leave it selected.
You can also create a section starting at the current page in your docu-
ment by choosing Layout➪Numbering & Section Options.
Figure 4-4:
The
Numbering

Part II: Document Essentials 

4. In the Section Prefix field, type up to eight characters that identify the
section in the page-number box at the lower-left corner of the docu-
ment window.
For example, if you type Sec2, the first page of the section will be dis-
played as Sec2:1 in the page-number box. This prefix won’t appear as
part of the actual page numbers when you print — it’s really just a way
for you to keep track of sections while you work.
5. From the Style menu, choose the Roman numeral, Arabic numeral, or
alphabetic style you want to use for page numbers.
6. For Page Numbering, select the Automatic Page Numbering option if
you want the first page of the section to be one number higher than
the last page of the previous section.
The new section will use the specified style; the previous section may
use this style or another style.
7. Select the Start Page Numbering At option and type a number in
the accompanying field to specify a different starting number for the
section.
For example, if a book begins with a section of front matter, you could
begin the body section of a book on page 1 by choosing Start At and
typing 1 in the field. If you select Continue from Previous Section, the
first page of the body section begins one number higher than the
numeral on the last page of the front matter.
8. In the Section Marker field, type a text string that you can later auto-
matically apply to pages in the section.
You might want to enter something straightforward like Section 2 or, if
the section is a chapter, the name of the chapter.
You can insert the section marker name so it prints in folios, chapter
headings, and story text by choosing Type➪Insert Special
Character➪Markers➪Section Marker. This is a great way to get a chapter
name (if you use it as the section marker) in your folio or to have cross-
references in text to a section whose name might later change. (A folio is
the collection of a page number, magazine or chapter name, section
name, or issue date, and so forth that usually appears at the top or
bottom of pages.)
9. Click OK to close the dialog box.
When you create a section, it’s indicated in the Pages panel by a small, black
triangle over the icon of the first page in the section, as shown in Figure 4-5.
(If you move the mouse pointer over the black triangle, the name of the sec-
tion appears.) The page-numbering scheme you specify is reflected in the
page numbers below the page icons. When you begin a section, it continues
until the end of the document or until you begin a new section.
73
Chapter 4: Discovering How Pages Work

By default, the Pages panel displays section numbers beneath the icons of
document pages. If you want to display absolute page numbers — the first
page is page 1 and all other pages are numbered sequentially — you can do
so by choosing InDesign➪Preferences➪General or pressing Ô+K on the Mac,
or by choosing Edit➪Preferences➪General or press Ctrl+K in Windows. Then
choose Absolute Numbering from the General pane’s View pop-up menu.
Removing a section start
If you decide that you want to remove a section start, navigate to the page
that begins the section, choose Numbering & Section Options from the Pages
panel’s flyout menu, or choose Layout➪Numbering & Section Options, and
deselect the Section Start option. That’s it! The pages in the former section
remain, but their numbering now picks up from the previous pages.
Navigating Documents and Pages
Moving from page to page in a long document and scrolling around a large or
magnified page are among the most common tasks you perform in InDesign.
The more time you spend navigating to the page or page area you want to
work on, the less time you have to do the work you need to do. Like most
trips, the less time you spend between destinations, the better.
For navigating through the pages of a document, the Pages panel (Window➪
Pages, or Ô+F12 or Ctrl+F12) offers the fastest ride. For navigating within a
page, you may want to switch to the Navigator panel (Window➪Object &
Layout➪Navigator).

Part II: Document Essentials 

Navigating with the Pages panel
When the Pages panel appears, you can use it to quickly move from page to
page in a multi-page document and to switch between displaying master
pages and document pages. To display a particular document page, double-
click its icon. The selected page is centered in the document window. To dis-
play a master spread, double-click its icon in the lower half of the panel.
(Note that you can reverse the order of master pages and regular pages in the
Pages panel by choosing the Panel Options option in the flyout menu.)
The Fit Page in Window command (View➪Fit Page in Window, or Ô+0 or
Ctrl+0) and Fit Spread in Window command (View➪Fit Page in Window or
Option+Ô+0 or Ctrl+Alt+0) let you enlarge or reduce the display magnifica-
tion to fit the selected page or spread in the document window. Related view
options are View➪Fit Spread in Window (Option+Ô+0 or Ctrl+Alt+0) and
View➪Entire Pasteboard (Option+Shift+Ô+0 or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+0). (Note that
the shortcuts use the numeral 0, not the letter O.)
Navigating with the menus and shortcuts
InDesign also offers several menu commands and keyboard shortcuts to
quickly navigate your layout, as Table 4-1 details.

Chapter 4: Discovering How Pages Work

Using the Navigator panel
Although it’s possible to use the Navigator panel (Window➪Object & Layout➪
Navigator) to move from page to page in a long document, the Pages panel is
better for this task. The Navigator panel is more useful for scrolling within a
page, particularly for doing detail work on a page that’s displayed at a high
magnification. If you’re an Illustrator, PageMaker, or Photoshop user, you may
already be familiar with the Navigator panel, which works the same in all three
applications.
Figure 4-6 shows the Navigator panel and its flyout menu.
You can also use the scroll bars at the right and bottom of the document
window to move to different areas of a page or to a different page in a
document.
Adjusting Page Layouts and Objects
If you’ve ever created and worked with a document all the way to the finish-
ing touches and then discovered that the page size was wrong from the
beginning, you know the meaning of frustration. Manually adjusting the size
and placement of all the objects in a document is an ugly chore: one you want
to avoid at all costs. However, should the unthinkable happen — you have to
modify the size, orientation, or margins of a document that is partially or
completely finished — InDesign can automatically resize and reposition
objects when you change its basic layout.
For example, maybe you created a magazine for an American audience that
subsequently needs to be converted for publication in Europe. Most newslet-
ters in the United States use letter-sized pages (81⁄2 × 11 inches), while in
Europe the standard page size for such publications is A4 (210 × 297 mm),
which is slightly narrower and slightly taller than U.S. letter size. Of course,
you have to change color to colour, apartment to flat, and so on, but you also
have to both squeeze (horizontally) and stretch (vertically) every item on
every page to accommodate the A4 page’s dimensions.
Figure 4-6:
The
Navigator
panel and
its flyout
menu.

Part II: Document Essentials 

The Layout Adjustment command (Layout➪Layout Adjustment) gives you
the option of turning this chore over to InDesign, which automatically adjusts
object shape and position according to the new page size, column guides,
and margins.
The Layout Adjustment dialog box lets you turn layout adjustment on or off
and specify the rules used to adjust objects when you change page size or
orientation, margins, or columns. To adjust a layout, follow these steps:
1. Choose Layout➪Layout Adjustment to display the Layout Adjustment
dialog box, shown in Figure 4-7.
2. Select the Enable Layout Adjustment option to turn on the feature;
deselect it to turn it off.
3. In the Snap Zone field, type the distance within which an object edge
will automatically snap to a guideline when layout adjustment is per-
formed.
4. Select the Allow Graphics and Groups to Resize option if you want
InDesign to resize objects when layout adjustment is performed.
If you don’t select this option, InDesign will move objects but not resize
them (the preferred option, so you don’t get awkward sizes).
5. Select the Allow Ruler Guides to Move option if you want InDesign to
adjust the position of ruler guides proportionally according to a new
page size.
Generally, ruler guides are placed relative to the margins and page
edges, so you probably want to select this option.
6. Select the Ignore Ruler Guide Alignments option if you want InDesign
to ignore ruler guides when adjusting the position of objects during
layout adjustment.
If you think that objects might snap to ruler guides that you don’t want
them to snap to during layout adjustment, select this option. If selected,
InDesign will still snap object edges to other margin and column guides.
Figure 4-7:
The Layout
Adjustment
dialog box.
77
Chapter 4: Discovering How Pages Work

7. Select the Ignore Object and Layer Locks option to let InDesign move
locked objects (either objects locked directly via Object➪Lock
Position or Ô+L or Ctrl+L, or objects that reside on a locked layer).
Otherwise, locked objects will not be adjusted.
8. When you’re done, click OK to close the dialog box.
The Layout Adjustment feature works best when there’s not much work for it
to do. Otherwise, it usually creates more work than it saves. For example, the
switch from a U.S. letter-sized page to an A4-sized page is a relatively minor
change and the layout adjustments will probably be barely noticeable. But if
you decide to change a tabloid-sized poster into a business card in midstream,
well, you’re probably better off starting over.
Here are a few things to keep in mind if you decide to use InDesign’s Layout
Adjustment feature:
 If you change page size, the margin widths (the distance between the left
and right margins and the page edges) remain the same.
 If you change page size, column guides and ruler guides are repositioned
proportionally to the new size.
 If you change the number of columns, column guides are added or
removed accordingly.
 If an object edge is aligned with a guideline before layout adjustment, it
remains aligned with the guideline after adjustment. If two or more edges
of an object are aligned with guidelines, the object is resized so that the
edges remain aligned with the guidelines after layout adjustment.
 If you change the page size, objects are moved so that they’re in the
same relative position on the new page.
 If you used margin, column, and ruler guides to place objects on pages,
layout adjustment will be more effective than if you placed objects or
ruler guides randomly on pages.
 Check for text reflow when you modify a document’s page size, margins,
or column guides. Decreasing a document’s page size can cause text to
overflow a text frame whose dimensions have been reduced.
 Check everything in your document after the adjustment is complete.
Take the time to look over every page of your document. You never know
what InDesign has actually done until you see it with your own eyes.
If you decide to enable layout adjustment for a particular publication, you
might want to begin by using the Save As command (File➪Save As or Shift+Ô+S
or Ctrl+Shift+S) to create a copy. That way, if you ever need to revert back to
the original version, you can simply open the original document.

Layers and Layers
In This Chapter
 Discovering what layers can do for you
 Setting up layers
 Working with individual objects on layers
 Manipulating entire layers
I
f you’ve ever seen a series of clear plastic overlays in presentations, under-
standing layers is easy. In one of those old overhead presentations, the
teacher could choose to start with one overlay containing a graphic, add
another overlay with descriptive text, and then add a third overlay containing
a chart. Each overlay contained distinct content, but you could see through
each one to the others to get the entire message. InDesign’s layers are some-
what like this, letting you isolate content on slices of a document. You can
then show and hide layers, lock objects on layers, rearrange layers, and more.
And unlike those old overhead slides, you can selectively turn layers on or
off, so you can use layers for other purposes as well, such as having multiple
languages in one document, with each language’s text frames on their own
layers. Or you could have production notes on their own layer, so you can
see them when desired but otherwise keep them out of the way.
What Layers Can Do for You
You could do your work in InDesign without ever once taking a look at the
Layers panel. But take a look at the possibilities and see whether they fit into
your workflow. In the long run, using layers can save you time and help you
prevent mistakes that can result when you need to track changes across mul-
tiple documents. It’s the kind of feature that, once discovered, can help you
work much easier.
Say you’ve created an ad with the same copy in it but a different headline and
image for each city where the ad runs. You can place the boilerplate informa-
tion on one layer and the information that changes on other layers. If any of
the boilerplate information changes, you need to change it only once. To
print different versions of the ad, you control which layers print.

You might use layers in the following situations (and in many others):
 A project with a high-resolution background image: For example, a
background such as a texture might take a long time to redraw. You can
hide that layer while designing other elements, and then show it occa-
sionally to see how it works with the rest of the design.
 A document that you produce in several versions: For example, a
produce ad may have different prices for different cities, or a clothing
catalog may feature different coats depending on the climate in each
area. You can place the content that changes on separate layers, and
then print the layers you need.
 A project that includes objects you don’t want to print: If you want to
suppress printout of objects for any reason, the only way you can do
this is to place them on a layer and hide the layer. You might have a
layer that’s used for nothing but adding editorial and design comments,
which can be deleted when the document is final. (Even though InDesign
CS3 now adds support for nonprinting notes, they can only be inserted
into text, so having a design-comments layer is still useful to be able to
make annotations for frames, images, and other nontextual elements.)
 A publication that is translated into several languages: Depending on
the layout, you can place all the common objects on one layer, and then
create a different layer for each language’s text. Changes to the common
objects need to happen only once — unlike creating copies of the origi-
nal document and flowing the translated text into the copies, which you
would need to do for each language’s version.
 To ensure folios and the like are never overprinted. This book’s tech
editor and overall production guru, Jonathan Woolson, places folios (the
document’s page numbers, running headings, and so forth) on their own
layer, uppermost in the layer stack. This ensures that they are never
accidentally obscured by other objects.
 To help text print properly over transparent elements. Woolson also
finds layers useful to isolate text above other objects with transparency
effects. This avoids the rasterizing of text during output to plate or film —
something that can make the text quality look poor.
Layer Basics
Each document contains a default layer, Layer 1, which contains all your objects
until you create and select a new layer. Objects on the default layer — and any
other layer for that matter — follow the standard stacking order of InDesign.
(What’s the stacking order? Well, the first object you create is the backmost, the
last one you create is the frontmost, and all the other objects fall somewhere in
between. This is how InDesign knows what to do with overlapping objects.)
Like the clear plastic overlays, the order of the layers also affects the stacking
order of the objects. Objects on the bottom layer are behind other objects, and
80
Part II: Document Essentials 

objects on the top layer are in front of other objects. For example, for a busi-
ness card, the Default layer would contain the business card’s standard graph-
ics and the main text. An additional layer would contain a different set of
contact information — in separate text frames — for a different person. Each
new person would have his or her information on his or own new layer. Each
layer has its own color, and frames will display in that color if frame edges are
visible (choose View➪Show Frame Edges or press Control+Ô+H or Ctrl+H).
Note that the new Mac shortcut for View➪Show Frame Edges is Control+Ô+H;
the Windows shortcut (Ctrl+H) is unchanged.
Although people often compare layers to plastic overlays, one big difference
exists: Layers aren’t specific to individual pages. Each layer encompasses the
entire document, which doesn’t make much difference when you’re working
on a one-page ad but makes a significant difference when it comes to a 16-
page newsletter. When you create layers and place objects on them, you must
consider all the pages in the document.
The Layers panel (choose Window➪Layers or press F7) is your gateway to
creating and manipulating layers (see Figure 5-1).

Chapter 5: Layers and Layers

Working with Layers
Each document contains a default layer, Layer 1, that contains all the objects
you place on master pages and document pages. You can create as many
layers as you need. After you create a new layer, it’s activated automatically
so you can begin working on it.
Creating a layer
The Layers panel (choose Window➪Layers or press F7) provides several
methods for creating new layers. It doesn’t matter which document page is
displayed when you create a layer because the layer encompasses all the
pages in the document. To create a layer, do one of the following:
 To create a new layer on top of all existing layers, click the New Layer
button on the Layers panel to open the New Layer dialog box. The layer
receives the default name of Layer x.
 To create a layer above the selected layer, Ô+click or Ctrl+click the
New Layer button. The layer receives the default name of Layer x.
 To create a new layer on top of all existing layers but customize its
name and identifying color, Option+click or Alt+click the New Layer
iconic button, or choose New Layer from the Layers panel’s flyout menu.
Use the New Layer dialog box to specify options for the layer. (The New
Layer dialog box — set with a custom name and color — is shown in
Figure 5-2.)
Customizing layers
You can customize the name, identifying color, guides, and lock status of
objects on a new or existing layer. If you choose to customize the layer when
you create it (by Option+clicking or Alt+clicking the New Layer iconic button
or by choosing New Layer from the Layers panel’s flyout menu), the New
Figure 5-2:
The New
Layer dialog
box.
82
Part II: Document Essentials 

Layer dialog box appears. If you choose to customize an existing layer,
double-click it to display the Layer Options dialog box. (You can also choose
Layer Options for Layer Name from the flyout menu on the Layers panel.)
Whether you’re using the New Layer dialog box shown in Figure 5-2 or the
nearly identical Layer Options dialog box, the options all work the same:
 Name field: Type a descriptive name for the layer. For example, if you’re
using layers for multilingual publishing, you might have a United States
English layer, a French layer, and a German layer. If you’re using layers to
hide background objects while you’re working, you might have a
Background Objects layer.
 Color pop-up menu: Choose a color from the menu. A layer’s color helps
you identify which layer an object is on. The color appears to the left of
the layer name in the Layers panel and appears on each object on that
layer. The color is applied to frame edges, selection handles, bounding
boxes, text ports, and text wraps. By default, InDesign applies a different
color to each new layer, but you can customize it to something meaning-
ful for your document and workflow.
 Show Layer check box: Selected by default, this control lets you specify
whether objects on a layer display onscreen. Hidden layers also do not
print. The Show Layer option has the same effect as clicking the eye icon
on the Layers panel.
 Lock Layer check box: Deselected by default, this option lets you con-
trol whether objects on a layer can be edited. You might lock a layer that
contains boilerplate text or a complex drawing that you don’t want
altered. Locking and unlocking layers is easy, so you might lock one
layer while focusing on another, and then unlock it. Select Lock Layer if
you don’t want to be able to select items and modify them. For example,
in a document containing multiple versions of text on different layers,
you might lock the layer containing background images and other
objects that stay the same. The Lock Layer option has the same effect as
clicking the lock icon on the Layers panel. There are additional locking
options in the Layers panel’s flyout menu to, for example, unlock all
layers and lock all layers but the active one.
The lock icon had been the pencil icon in previous versions of InDesign.
When you lock an object to a page (by choosing Object➪Lock Position,
or Ô+L or Ctrl+L), the object’s position stays locked regardless of its
layer’s lock status.
 Print Layer check box: Selected by default, this option lets you control
whether the layer prints or exports to PDF. You might use this option for
a layer containing design comments, for example. (In previous versions
of InDesign, deselecting Show Layer also prevented the layer from print-
ing. That remains true, but now you can control whether unhidden
layers print or not as well.) You can also override whether nonprinting
layers print in the Print dialog box, as explained in Chapter 25.
83
Chapter 5: Layers and Layers

 Suppress Text Wrap When Layer Is Hidden check box: Deselected by
default, this option prevents text wrapping around the layer’s objects
when the layer is hidden. Be sure to select this option when you use
multiple layers for variations of the same content, such as multilingual
text or different contacts for business cards. Otherwise, your layer’s text
can’t display because it’s wrapping around a hidden layer with an object
of the same size in the same place.
 Show Guides check box: This check box lets you control the display of
guides that were created while the selected layer was active. When
selected, as it is by default, you can create guides while any layer is
active and view those guides on any layer. When deselected, you can’t
create guides. Any guides you create while that layer is active are not
displayed, but you can still see guides that you created while other
layers were active. Note that when guides are hidden entirely (choose
View➪Grids & Guides➪Hide Guides, or press Ô+; [semicolon] or Ctrl+;
[semicolon]), this command has no apparent effect.
 Lock Guides check box: This works similarly to Show Guides in that it
affects only the guides that you created while the layer is active. When
deselected, as it is by default, you can move guides on any layer for
which Lock Guides is deselected. When selected, you cannot move
guides created while that layer was active. You can, however, move
guides on other layers for which Lock Guides is deselected. Note that
when all guides are locked (choose View➪Grids & Guides➪Lock Guides,
or Option+Ô+; [semicolon] or press Ctrl+Alt+; [semicolon]), this com-
mand has no apparent effect.
You can select multiple layers and customize them all at once. However,
because each layer must have a different name, the Name field isn’t available
in the Layer Options dialog box when multiple layers are selected.
Working with Objects on Layers
Whether you’re designing a magazine template from the ground up or modify-
ing an existing ad, you can isolate specific types of objects on layers. You can
create objects on a layer, move objects to a layer, or copy objects to a layer.
The active layer
The active layer is the one on which you’re creating objects — whether
you’re using tools, importing text or graphics, clicking and dragging objects
in from a library, or pasting objects from other layers or other documents. A
84
Part II: Document Essentials 

pen icon to the right of a layer’s name means it’s the active layer. Although
more than one layer can be selected at a time, only one can be active. To
switch the active layer to another layer, click to the right of the layer name
that you want to be active; the pen icon moves, making that the new active
layer. Keep in mind that to activate a layer, it must be visible.
Selecting objects on layers
Regardless of the active layer, you can select, move, and modify objects on
any visible, unlocked layer. You can even select objects on different layers
and manipulate them.
The Layers panel (choose Window➪Layers or press F7) helps you work with
selected objects in the following ways:
 To determine which layer an object belongs to, match the color on its
bounding box to the color that appears to the left of a layer name.
 To determine which layers contain active objects, look to the right of the
layer names. A small square — the object icon — to the right of a layer
name indicates that you have selected an object on that layer.
 To select all the objects on a layer, Option+click or Alt+click the layer’s
name in the Layers panel. The layer must be active, unlocked, and visible.
To select master-page objects as well as document-page objects on a layer,
you need to Option+Shift+click or Alt+Shift+click the layer name.
Placing objects on layers
To place objects on a layer, the layer must be active as indicated by the pen
icon. Anything you copy, import, or create in InDesign goes on the active
layer.
When you create objects on master pages, they are placed on the default
layer and are therefore behind other objects on document pages. To create
objects on master pages that are in front of other objects, place the objects
on a different layer while the master page is displayed.
You can cut and paste objects from one page to another, but have the objects
remain on their original layer — without concern about the active layer. To
do this, be sure the Paste Remembers Layers check box is selected in the
Layers panel’s flyout menu before choosing Edit➪Paste or pressing Ô+V or
Ctrl+V.
85
Chapter 5: Layers and Layers

Moving objects to different layers
When an object is on a layer, it isn’t stuck there. You can copy and paste
objects to selected layers, or you can move them by using the Layers panel.
When you move an object to a layer, it’s placed in front of all other objects on
a layer. To select multiple objects, remember to Shift+click them, and then
move them in one of the following ways:
 Paste objects on a different layer. First cut or copy objects to the
Clipboard. Activate the layer on which you want to put the objects, and
then use the Paste command (by choosing Edit➪Paste or by pressing
Ô+V or Ctrl+V). This method works well for moving objects that are
currently on a variety of layers.
 Move objects to a different layer. Click and drag the object icon for the
selected objects (to the right of a layer’s name) to another layer. When
you use this method, it doesn’t matter which layer is active. However,
you can’t move objects from several different layers to the same layer
using this method. (If you select multiple objects that reside on different
layers, dragging the box moves only objects that reside on the first layer
on which you selected an object.)
 Move objects to a hidden or locked layer. Press Ô or Ctrl while you
click and drag the selected objects’ object icon.
 Copy rather than move objects to a different layer. Press Option or Alt
while you click and drag the selected objects’ object icon.
 Copy objects to a hidden or locked layer. Press Option+Ô or Ctrl+Alt
while you drag the selected objects’ object icon.
Manipulating Entire Layers
In addition to working on objects and their layer positions, you can also
select and manipulate entire layers. These changes affect all the objects on
the layer — for example, if you hide a layer, all its objects are hidden; if you
move a layer up, all its objects appear in front of objects on lower layers.
Functions that affect an entire layer include hiding, locking, rearranging,
merging, and deleting. You work on entire layers in the Layers panel.
Selecting layers
The active layer containing the pen icon is always selected. You can extend
the selection to include other layers the same way you multiple-select
objects: Shift+click for a continuous selection and Ô+click or Ctrl+click for a
noncontiguous selection.
86
Part II: Document Essentials 

Rearranging layers
Each layer has its own front-to-back stacking order, with the first object you
create on the layer being its backmost object. You can modify the stacking
order of objects on a single layer by using the Arrange commands on the
Object menu. Objects are further stacked according to the order in which the
layers are listed in the Layers panel. The layer at the top of the list contains
the frontmost objects, and the layer at the bottom of the list contains the
backmost objects.
If you find that all the objects on one layer need to be in front of all the
objects on another layer, you can move that layer up or down in the list. In
fact, you can move all currently selected layers up or down, even if the selec-
tion is noncontiguous. To move layers, click the selection and drag it up or
down. When you move layers, remember that layers are document-wide, so
you’re actually changing the stacking order of objects on all the pages.
Combining layers
When you’re just discovering the power of layers, you might create a docu-
ment that is unnecessarily complex (for example, you might have put each
object on a different layer and realized that the document has become too
difficult to work with). The good news is that you can also merge all the
layers in a document to flatten it to a single layer. To flatten all layers:
1. Select the target layer (the layer where you want all the objects to
end up) by clicking it.
2. Select the source layers (the layers that contain the objects you want
to move) in addition to the target layer.
Shift+click or Ô+click or Ctrl+click to add the source layers to the
selection.
3. Make sure the target layer contains the pen icon and that the target
and source layers are all selected.
4. Choose Merge Layers from the Layers panel’s flyout menu.
All objects on the source layers are moved to the target layer, and the
source layers are deleted.
When you merge layers, the stacking order of objects doesn’t change, so the
design looks the same, but with one notable exception: If you created objects
on a layer while a master page was displayed, those objects go to the back of
the stacking order with the regular master-page objects.
87
Chapter 5: Layers and Layers

Deleting layers
If you carefully isolate portions of a document on different layers and then
find that you don’t need that portion of the document, you can delete the
layer. For example, if you have a United States English and an International
English layer and you decide that you can’t afford to print the different ver-
sions, you can delete the unneeded layer. You might also delete layers that
you don’t end up using to simplify a document.
When you delete layers, all the objects on the layer throughout the document
are deleted.
Using the Layers panel, you can delete selected layers in the following ways:
 Click and drag the selection to the Delete Selected Layers iconic button.
 Click the Delete Selected Layers iconic button. The currently selected
layers are deleted.
 Choose Delete Layer from the Layers panel’s flyout menu.
If any of the layers contain objects, a warning reminds you that they will be
deleted. And, of course, the ubiquitous Undo command (choose Edit➪Undo
or press Ô+Z or Ctrl+Z) lets you recover from accidental deletions.
To remove all layers that don’t contain objects, choose Delete Unused Layers
from the Layers panel’s flyout menu.

 Working with XML snippets
U
nless you enjoy continually reinventing the wheel, you’ll want to take
full advantage of the features that InDesign offers to help you work
more productively. After you make some important decisions about elements
in your document that will repeat, page after page, in the same spot (such as
page numbers, graphics, headers and footers, and so on), you want to set up
mechanisms that make the process simple.
Fewer activities in life are less rewarding than doing the same job over and
over, and publishing is no exception. Fortunately, InDesign includes some
valuable features that let you automate repetitive tasks. In this chapter, I focus
on three of them: templates, master pages, and libraries. (Note that there are
other ways to reuse InDesign elements, such as exporting to PDF or XHTML
files, or exporting stories and graphics. These are covered in Chapter 3.)
Building and Using Templates
A template is a pre-built InDesign document that you use as the starting point
for creating multiple versions of the same design or publication. For example,
if you create a monthly newsletter that uses the same basic layout for each
issue, but with different graphics and text, you begin by creating a template
that contains all the elements that are the same in every issue — placeholder
frames for the graphics and text, guidelines, and so on.

Creating templates
Creating a template is very similar to creating a document. You create charac-
ter, paragraph, and object styles, master pages, repeating elements (for exam-
ple, page numbers), and so on. The only thing you don’t add to a template is
actual content.
Most often, you create a template after building the first iteration of a docu-
ment. After you have that document set up the way you like, you simply strip
out the content (that first issue’s stories and graphics in our newsletter
example) and save it as a template.
Here are the steps for creating a template:
1. Choose File➪Save As or press Shift+Ô+S or Ctrl+Shift+S to display the
Save As dialog box.
2. Choose a folder and specify a name for the file.
3. Choose InDesign CS3 Template in the Format pop-up menu (Mac) or
Save as Type pop-up menu (Windows).
4. Click Save to close the Save As dialog box and save the template.
If you’re designing a template that will be used by others, you might want to
add a layer of instructions. When it’s time to print a document based on the
template, simply hide the annotation layer. (See Chapter 5 for more informa-
tion about working with layers.)
If you didn’t know better, you might think that a template is exactly the same
as a regular InDesign document. It is, with one major exception: A template is
a bit more difficult to override. When you open a template, it receives a
default name (Untitled-1, Untitled-2, and so on). The first time you choose
File➪Save or press Ô+S or Ctrl+S, the Save As dialog box appears.
Modifying templates
As you use a template over time, you might discover that you forgot to
include something — perhaps a paragraph style, a repeating element on a
particular master page, or an entire master page. To modify a template, you
have two options:
 Open it as a normal file, make your changes, and then choose File➪Save
As (or press Shift+Ô+S or Ctrl+Shift+S) to save it again as a template. To
open a file as a normal file, be sure that Open Normal (Mac) or Normal
(Windows) is selected at the bottom of the Open a File dialog box — this
is the default option.
90
Part II: Document Essentials 

 Open it as an original file (see Chapter 3), make your changes, and then
choose File➪Save (Ô+S or Ctrl+S) to save it again as a template. To open
a file as an original file, be sure that Open Original (Mac) or Original
(Windows) is selected at the bottom of the Open a File dialog box — it’s
easy to forget to select this option, so most people end up using the pre-
vious technique to resave the template.
Creating documents from templates
It’s very easy to create a document from a template: Just open a template file
and save it with a new name, making sure that InDesign CS3 Document is
selected in the Format pop-up menu (Mac) or Save as Type pop-up menu
(Windows) — this the default setting. Work on your document and continue
to save changes normally.
A more complicated way to create a document from a template is to choose
File➪New Document from Template. This opens the Adobe Bridge program,
which can contain InDesign templates that you open and then save as docu-
ments. Bridge is meant as a central place for all Creative Suite documents and
many related files such as color libraries to help workgroups have one place
for all their Creative Suite needs. I think it’s more complicated than it is
useful, at least for InDesign users (many Photoshop users love it).
Building and Using Master Pages
A master page is a preconstructed page layout that you can use to create new
pages — it is the starting point for document pages. Typically, master pages
contain text and graphic elements, such as page numbers, headers, footers,
and so on, which appear on all pages of a publication. Master pages also
include guidelines that indicate page edges, column boundaries, and margins,
as well as other manually created guidelines to aid page designers in placing
objects. By placing items on master pages, you save yourself the repetitive
work of placing the same items one by one on each and every document page.
It may surprise you to know that every InDesign document you create already
contains a master page, called A-Master. Whether you use the default master
page or create and use additional master pages depends on what kind of docu-
ment you want to create. If it’s a single-page document, such as a flier or an ad,
you don’t need master pages at all, so you can just ignore them. However, if
you want to create a document with multiple pages — a brochure or booklet,
for example — master pages save time and help ensure consistent design.
91
Chapter 6: The Joys of Reuse

Creating a new master page
When you’re ready to create a new master page, here’s what you do:
1. If the Pages panel is not displayed, choose Windows➪Pages or press
Ô+F12 or Ctrl+F12.
The Pages panel is covered in more detail in Chapter 4.
2. From the Pages panel’s flyout menu, choose New Master.
You can also hold Option+Ô or Ctrl+Alt and click the Create New Page
iconic button at the bottom of the panel. The New Master dialog box,
shown in Figure 6-1, appears.
3. In the Prefix field, specify a one-character prefix to attach to the front
of the master page name and display on associated document page
icons in the Pages panel.
The default will be a capital letter, such as the D in Figure 6-1.
4. In the Name field, give your new master page a name.
It’s a good idea to use a descriptive name, such as Title Page.
5. To base the new master page (the child) on another master page (the
parent), choose the parent master page from the Based on Master pop-
up menu.
6. In the Number of Pages field, enter the number of pages you want to
include in the master spread. For a document with a single-page design,
enter 1; if the document will have facing pages, enter 2.
7. Click OK to save the page and close the dialog box.
Your new master page appears in the document window. The name of the
master page appears in the Page Number field in the bottom-left corner of the
document window. To make changes to a master page’s attributes, simply click
its icon at the top of the Pages panel, choose Master Options from the panel’s
flyout menu, and then change settings in the Master Options dialog box.
Note that you can move master pages to be at the bottom of the Pages panel —
rather than at the top — by choosing Panel Options from the flyout menu and
enabling the Pages on Top option.
Figure 6-1:
The New
Master
dialog box.
92
Part II: Document Essentials 

When you’re building a master page, you should think more about the overall
structure of the page than about details. Keep the following in mind:
 To build a document with facing pages, create facing-page master
spreads. The facing pages are somewhat like mirror images of each
other. Typically, the left-hand master page is for even-numbered docu-
ment pages, and the right-hand master page is for odd-numbered docu-
ment pages.
 To have page numbers automatically appear on document pages, add a
page number character on each page of your master spreads by drawing a
text frame with the Type tool where you want the page number to appear
and then choosing Type➪Insert Special Character➪Markers➪Current
Page Number or pressing Option+Ô+N or Ctrl+Alt+N. The prefix of the
master page (A, B, C, and so on) appears on the master page, but the
actual page number is what appears on document pages. Don’t forget to
format the page number on the master page so that page numbers will
look the way you want them to in the document.
 Specify master page margins and columns by first making sure that the
page is displayed in the document window and then choosing
Layout➪Margins and Columns. The Margins and Columns dialog box,
shown in Figure 6-2, is displayed. The controls in this dialog box let you
specify the position of the margins, the number of columns, and the
gutter width (space between columns).
You can place additional guidelines on a master page — as many custom
guidelines as you want. (Guidelines are covered in Chapter 11.)
Basing one master page on another
Some publications benefit from having more than one master page. If you’re
building a document with several pages that are somewhat similar in design,
it’s a good idea to start with one master page and then use it as a basis for
additional master pages.
For example, if the brochure you’re working on uses both two-column and
three-column page layouts, you can create the two-column master spread
first and include all repeating page elements. You can then create the three-
column master page spread, basing it on the two-column master, and simply
Figure 6-2:
The
Margins
and
Columns
dialog box.
93
Chapter 6: The Joys of Reuse

specify different column formats. The “child” master page will be identical to
the parent except for the number of columns. If you later change an element
on the original master page, the change will apply automatically to the child
master page.
When you create a new master page, the New Master dialog box provides the
option to base it on an existing master page. To help you keep things straight,
when you base a master page on another master page, InDesign displays the
prefix of the parent page on the icon of the child page.
If you base a master spread on another master spread, you can still modify
the master objects (that is, the objects inherited from the parent master) on
the child master page. As with regular document pages, you have to
Shift+Ô+click or Ctrl+Shift+click the object inherited from a parent master to
release it before you can edit it on a child master.
Basing a master spread on a document spread
You might be talented enough to create an effective spread, one that is so
handsome that you want to create a master page from it to use on future docu-
ments. Simply highlight the spread by clicking the page numbers below the
relevant page icons in the Pages panel and choose Save as Master from the
Pages panel’s flyout menu. The new master is assigned a default name and
prefix. To change any of its attributes, click its name in the Pages panel and
then choose Master Options from the flyout menu.
Duplicating a master spread
Create a copy of a master spread by selecting its icon and then choosing
Duplicate Master Spread from the Pages panel’s flyout menu or simply by drag-
ging its icon onto the Create New Page button at the bottom of the panel. Note
that if you duplicate a master spread, the duplicate loses any parent/child
relationships.
Importing a master page
Sometimes, another document has a master page that you’d like to use in
your current layout. InDesign CS3 lets you import those master pages: Just
choose Load Master Pages from the Pages panel’s flyout menu, select the
source document in the dialog box that appears, and click Open. InDesign
will import all master pages from that document into your current one. Sorry,
there’s no way to select specific master pages.
The ability to import master pages is new to InDesign CS3. Before, you had
two not-so-great options that required both the source and target documents
be open. One option is to create a new master page in your document, and
then copy the elements from another document using old-fashioned copy-and-
paste. The other option is to drag the name of the master page that you want
94
Part II: Document Essentials 

to copy from the source document’s Pages panel to the target document’s
document window. (You can still use these two approaches if you insist.)
If any of the imported master pages have the same name as your current 
document’s master pages (such as the default name A-Master), a dialog box
will appear giving you the choice of replacing the current master pages with
the imported ones that use the same name or of renaming the imported
master pages, so you keep what you have and add the imported ones.
InDesign does the renaming for you.
Note that InDesign will also alert you if the imported master pages use differ-
ent dimensions than the current document’s pages. It won’t adjust the
imported pages, so some items may appear off the page if the imported
master page has larger dimensions than the current document.
Deleting a master page
To delete a master page, select its name and then choose Delete Master Page
from the Pages panel’s flyout menu. You can also drag the master icon to the
Delete Pages iconic button at the bottom of the Pages panel.
So what happens when you delete a master page on which document pages
are based? Don’t worry — your document pages are unchanged, though they
no longer have a master page (in the Pages panel, the page icons won’t dis-
play the letter of a master page in their upper outside corners).
You can remove a master page from a specific document page without remov-
ing the master page from your document (and thus other pages), by applying
the [None] master page to the document page using the process described
next.
Applying a master page to document pages
After you build a master page, you can apply it to new or existing document
pages. (See Chapter 4 for information about adding and removing document
pages.) For documents with facing pages, you can apply both pages of a
master spread to both pages of the document spread or you can apply one
page of a master spread to one page of the document spread. For example,
you can apply a master page with a two-column format to the left-hand page
of a document spread and apply a master page with a three-column format to
the right-hand page.
To apply a master page to a document page, select the name or icon of the
page in the top part of the Pages panel and then drag it onto the icon of 
the document page you want to format. When the target document page is
95
Chapter 6: The Joys of Reuse

highlighted (framed in a black rectangle, as shown in the left side of Fig-
ure 6-3), release the mouse button. If both document pages are highlighted,
and if you are applying a master page to the document, both sides of the
master spread are applied to the document spread.
You can also apply a master page to the currently displayed pages by choos-
ing Layout➪Pages➪Apply Master to Pages.
Changing master items on document pages
As you work on a document page that’s based on a master, you may find that
you need to change, move, or delete a master object. Any change you make
to a master object on a local page is referred to as a local override.
Whenever you remove a master object from a document page, you sever the
object’s relationship to the master-page object for that document page only.
If you subsequently move or modify the object on the master page, it won’t
affect the deleted object on the document page — it remains deleted on that
particular document page.
The Show/Hide Master Items command in the Pages panel’s flyout menu lets
you show or hide master objects on document pages.
To change a master object on a document page, you must first select it, and
doing so can be a bit tricky. To select a master object on a document page,
hold down Shift+Ô or Ctrl+Shift when you click the object with one of the
selection tools. (You can also Shift+Ô+drag or Ctrl+Shift+drag to select multi-
ple objects within the selection marquee.) After you select a master object on
a document page, you can modify it just as you would objects that are not
part of a master page.
Figure 6-3:
Applying a
single
master page
to a

page.
96
Part II: Document Essentials 

If you modify one or more master objects on a document page and then
decide you want to revert back to using the original master objects, you can
remove the local overrides. To do so, display the document page that con-
tains the master objects you’ve modified, select the objects, and then choose
Remove Selected Local Overrides from the Pages panel’s flyout menu. If no
objects are selected, the command name changes to Remove All Local
Overrides. If the selected spread doesn’t have any modified master objects,
the command is not available.
Sometimes, you don’t want people to have the ability to override a master page
object. InDesign CS3 gives you a way to block such overrides: With the master
page open and any objects selected that you don’t want to be overridden, 
deselect Allow Master Item Overrides on Selection in the Pages panel’s flyout
menu. With this option deselected, someone won’t be able to override the
selected master page objects on any document pages using them — unless of
course they reselect the Allow Master Item Overrides on Selections option.
Building and Using Libraries
An InDesign library is a file — similar in some ways to a document file — where
you can store individual objects (graphics, text, and so forth), groups and
nested objects, ruler guides, and grids (see Chapter 11). Once an item is in a
library, every time you need a copy, you simply drag one out of the library.
Creating a library
Creating a library is easy:
1. Choose File➪New➪Library.
The New Library dialog box appears, with essentially the same options
as the Save As dialog box covered in Chapter 3.
2. Choose a location in which to save the library.
3. Give the library a name.
4. Click OK.
You can create as many libraries as you want and store them wherever is
most convenient, including on a networked server so that other InDesign
users can share them. You can also open libraries created on a Mac from a
Windows computer, and vice versa.
97
Chapter 6: The Joys of Reuse

Right after you create a new library, you see an empty library panel group.
Each library that you create or open will appear as its own panel within that
panel group, with its name displayed in its tab, as shown in Figure 6-4. To add
items to the library, you simply drag them to the desired panel.
Here is an explanation of some of the controls and commands shown in
Figure 6-4:
 The numbers in the lower-left corner of the panel indicate the number
of items currently displayed in the pane and the number of items in the
library.
 The Library Item Information iconic button displays the Item
Information dialog box, as does the Library Item flyout menu option.
Here you can give each library item a name, a type (for example, image
or text), and a description. Later, you can search for library items based
on these attributes.
 The Show Library Subset iconic button displays a dialog box that lets
you locate and display items that meet certain search criteria, as does
the Show Subset flyout menu option.
 The Delete Library Item iconic button lets you delete highlighted items
in the library, as does the Delete Item(s) flyout menu option.

Putting items into a library
You can place individual items, such as text and graphics frames, into a
library. You can also place multiple selected objects, groups, nested frames,
ruler guides, guidelines, and all items on a document page.
To add items to a library:
 Select one or more items and then drag them into an open library panel.
(Open an existing library by choosing File➪Open or by pressing Ô+O
or Ctrl+O.)
 Select one or more items and then choose Add Item from the flyout
menu of an open Library panel.
 Choose Add All Items on Page from the flyout menu of an open Library
panel to add all items on the current page or spread as one library item.
Choose Add All Items on Page as Separate Objects to add each object on
the page in one step as separate library items.
 Select one or more items and then click the New Library Item iconic
button at the bottom of an open Library panel.
If you hold down the Option or Alt key when adding an item to a library, the
Item Information dialog box is displayed. This dialog box lets you add search-
able attributes to the library item.
99
Chapter 6: The Joys of Reuse
Why you’ll love snippets
InDesign has a neat option called XML snippets
that lets you take pieces of your document and
create a file that other InDesign users can bring
into their documents, preserving all formatting
and effects applied to them.
They’re sort of like libraries, with a key exception:
Each snippet is a separate file, so they’re not as
easy or as convenient as libraries when you have
lots of document pieces that you want to share
or make available for reuse. So snippets are best
for sharing specific elements on an as-needed
basis, whereas libraries are better for having,
well, a library of standard, shared elements.
The process of creating snippets is easy: Select
the objects and drag them outside your docu-
ment window onto the Mac or Windows desk-
top or onto a folder. InDesign automatically
creates the XML snippet file containing those
objects and their formatting. You can then send
that snippet to other users on storage drives, via
e-mail, or over the network — like any other file.
To use the snippet in another document, just
drag the snippet into your document window.
That’s it!

If you import a graphic into a document and then place a copy of the graphic
into a library, the path to the original graphics file is saved, as are any transfor-
mations you’ve applied to the graphic or its frame (scale, rotation, shear, and
so on). If you save text in a library, all formatting, including styles, is retained.
Tagging library items
A library can hold as many items as you want. As a library grows, locating a
particular item can become increasingly difficult. To make InDesign library
items easier to find, tag them with several searchable attributes.
To tag a library element, select it and then choose Item Information from the
library panel’s flyout menu. You can also display the Item Information dialog
box by double-clicking a library item or by clicking once on a library item and
then clicking the Library Item Information iconic button at the bottom of the
Library panel. (It’s the i in a circle.) Specify a Name, Object Type, and/or
Description. In the Description field, use a few words that describe the
object; this will make it easier to find later. Click OK to close the dialog box
and return to the document.
Searching for library items
You can search for library items based on the information specified in the
Item Information dialog box. For example, if you place several different icons
into a library that includes many other items, and if you use the term icon in
the Name or Description field, a search of these fields that includes “icon”
will find and display those items stored in your library.
Follow these steps to search a library:
1. Choose Show Subset from a library panel’s flyout menu or click the
Show Library Subset iconic button at the bottom of the panel.
2. Decide whether to search the entire library or only the items cur-
rently displayed in the page and select the appropriate radio button.
3. In the Parameters area, choose the Item Information category you
want to search from the first pop-up menu.
Your choices are Item Name, Creation Date, Object Type, and
Description.
4. From the next pop-up menu, choose Contains if you intend to search
for text contained in the chosen category; choose Doesn’t Contain if
you want to exclude items that contain the text you specify.
100
Part II: Document Essentials 

5. In the Parameter’s area text-entry field, type the word or phrase you
want to search for (if you selected Contains in Step 4) or exclude (if
you selected Doesn’t Contain).
6. Add more search criteria by clicking the More Choices button; reduce
the number of search criteria by clicking Fewer Choices.
You can create up to five levels of search criteria. If you select two or more
levels of search criteria, you will be able to choose whether to display
items that match all search criteria (by selecting Match All) or to display
items that match any of the search criteria (by selecting Match Any One).
7. Click OK to conduct the search and close the dialog box.
The library items that match the search criteria are displayed in the panel
(unless no items matched the search criteria). To display all items after con-
ducting a search, choose Show All from the Library panel’s flyout menu.
Deleting items from a library
To delete a library item, drag its icon to the trashcan icon at the bottom of
the panel or select the item and then choose Delete Item(s) from the library
panel’s flyout menu. You can select a range of items by clicking the first one
and then Shift+clicking the last one. You can select multiple, noncontiguous
items by holding down the Ô or Ctrl key and clicking each icon.
Copying library items
onto document pages
After an item is in a library, you can place copies of that library item into any
document or into another library. To place a copy of a library item onto the
currently displayed document page, drag the item’s icon from the library
panel onto the page. As you drag, the outline of the library item is displayed.
Release the mouse button when the outline of the item is positioned where
you want it to end up. You can also place a library item onto a document by
clicking its icon and then choosing Place Item(s) from the flyout menu.
Copy an item from one library to another by dragging its icon from the
source library panel onto the target library panel. To move (rather than
copy) an item from one library to another, hold down the Option or Alt key

Managing library panels
You can close an individual panel by clicking its close box or choosing Close
Library from its flyout menu. You can close all libraries at once by clicking
the panel group’s close box.
You can move panels into their own panel groups by dragging their tab out-
side their current panel groups. Likewise, you can combine library panels by
dragging them by their tabs into another panel group (including those that
contain non-library panels).

W
e see the world in glorious color. Yet not all publications take advan-
tage of that fact, typically for budget reasons. But when you do have
color available, take advantage of it: It brings a visual dimension that taps
into our primal brains, creating a level of raw visual interest unmatched by
anything else.
To take advantage of human beings’ color “hot buttons,” InDesign offers the
ability to create and apply colors in many creative ways. But even if you can’t
use color in every document, some of the techniques described here —
especially for tints and gradients — can help a staid black-and-white docu-
ment get new panache through shades of gray.
Working with Colors
InDesign comes with only a few predefined colors: black, registration (black on
each negative for the printing press), paper (white), none (transparent), cyan,
magenta, yellow, red, green, and blue. You likely want to add a few of your own.
Creating color swatches
Before you can apply any colors — whether to bitmap images or to layout
elements such as strokes, text, frames, and shapes — you must first define
the colors, which you do in the Swatches panel (Window➪Swatches or F5).
You can also import colors from other Adobe programs and from some color
images.

No matter how you define colors, you have a couple of decisions to make
first:
 Do you want to create your own color by mixing basic colors like red,
green, and blue (called RGB and typically used for documents like Web
pages and PDF files displayed onscreen), or cyan, yellow, magenta, and
black (called CMYK, or process colors, and typically used for printing
presses and by inkjet printers)?
 Do you want to use a color from an ink maker like Pantone or Toyo?
These colors — called spot colors — are typically used as an extra ink on
your professionally printed document but can also be converted to the
standard four-process colors and so are handy when you know the color
you want when you see it.
All of the color-creation tools in InDesign support both process and spot
colors, and all have access to the predefined colors like Pantone and Toyo as
well as to the free-form color pickers for mixing CMYK or RGB colors. If you
plan to print the color on its own plate, you need to use a predefined color so
you know the printer can reproduce it. If you plan to color-separate a color
into the four CMYK plates, it doesn’t matter whether you use a predefined
color or make one of your own. One advantage to using a predefined color is
that it’s easy to tell other designers what the color is; another is that you will
get very close matches if you start with a predefined color and then end up
having it color-separated in some documents and kept as a spot color in
others.
All colors in the Swatches panel receive a unique name and are tracked by
InDesign. That means each color is available to be used on any object in your
document, with no risk of having slightly different variants. Plus, you can
modify a swatch and ensure that all objects using that swatch are updated.
You can also delete a swatch and tell InDesign which color to use in its place.
Furthermore, when you print, you have control over how each color is han-
dled (whether it is printed to its own plate, whether it is printed at all, and
whether there should be any adjustments to its ink density or screening
angle). Figure 7-1 shows the Swatches panel.
If no document is open when you create, edit, or delete colors, the new color
palette becomes the default for all future documents.
To create your own color, go to the Swatches panel and select New Color
Swatch from the flyout menu. The New Color Swatch dialog box shown in
Figure 7-2 appears. Now follow these steps:
104
Part II: Document Essentials 

1. In the Swatch Name field, give your color a name that describes it,
such as Lemon Yellow or Blood Red.
You can also select the Name with Color Value option, which uses the
color values to make up the color name, as done for the colors under
[Registration] in Figure 7-1. This option is the default setting for CMYK,
RGB, and LAB colors; it is not available for swatch-based colors such as
Pantone.
2. In the Color Type pop-up menu, choose from Process or Spot.
The difference between process colors and spot colors is discussed
later in this chapter; leave the color type at Process if you’re not sure.

Chapter 7: Working with Color

3. In the Color Mode pop-up menu, choose the mixing system or swatch
library (both are considered to be color models) you will use:
• CMYK: Cyan, magenta, yellow, and black are the colors used in
professional printing presses and many color printers.
• RGB: Red, green, and blue are the colors used on a computer
monitor, for CD-based or Web-based documents, and for some
color printers.
• Lab: Luminosity, A axis, B axis, is a way of defining colors created
by the international standards group Commission Internationale de
l’Éclairage (the CIE, which translates to International Commission
on Illumination in English).
• A swatch-based model: Sets of premixed colors from various ven-
dors, including ANPA, DIC, Focoltone, HKS, Pantone, Toyo Ink, and
Trumatch for print documents, as well as a Web-specific set and
sets specific to Windows and the Mac OS for onscreen documents.
• Other Library: InDesign also has the Other Library option from
which you can select any color, tint, or gradient swatch library file
in the old Adobe Illustrator 8 format. (You can’t use Illustrator’s
patterned swatches, but don’t worry if the swatch file contains
them: InDesign will simply ignore them.)
4. For the CMYK, RGB, and Lab models, use the sliders to create your
new color. (A preview appears in the box on the left.) For the swatch-
based models, scroll through the lists of colors and select one.
5. If you want to create multiple colors, click Add after each color defini-
tion and then click Done when you’re finished. To create just one
color, click OK instead of Add. You can also click Cancel to abort the
current color definition.
The most popular swatch libraries used by North American professional pub-
lishers are those from Pantone, whose Pantone Matching System (PMS) is the
de facto standard for most publishers in specifying spot-color inks. The
Pantone swatch libraries come in several variations, of which InDesign
includes 13. Most of the time, you’ll use one of the following four:
 Pantone Process Coated: Use this library when you color-separate
Pantone colors and your printer uses the standard Pantone-brand
process-color inks. (These colors reproduce reliably when color-
separated, while the other Pantone swatch libraries’ colors often do not.)
 Pantone Solid Coated: Use this library when your printer will use actual
Pantone inks (as spot colors) when printing to coated paper stock.
 Pantone Solid Matte: Use this library when your printer will use actual
Pantone inks (as spot colors) when printing to matte-finished paper stock.
 Pantone Solid Uncoated: Use this library when your printer will use actual
Pantone inks (as spot colors) when printing to uncoated paper stock.
106
Part II: Document Essentials 

Color swatches based on the CMYK colors — such as Focoltone, Pantone
Process, and Trumatch — will accurately color-separate and thus print accu-
rately on a printing press because a printing press uses the CMYK colors.
Other swatches’ colors often do not color-separate accurately because they
are supposed to represent special inks that may have added elements like
metals and clays designed to give metallic or pastel appearances that simply
can’t be replicated by combining cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. Similarly,
some colors (like several hues of orange and green) can’t be accurately cre-
ated using the CMYK colors.
Creating mixed colors
InDesign offers another type of color: mixed-ink color. Essentially, a mixed-ink
color combines a spot color with the default process colors (cyan, magenta,
yellow, and black) to create new color swatches. For example, you can com-
bine 38 percent black with 100 percent Pantone 130C to get a darker version
of Pantone 130C (called a duotone, though InDesign doesn’t limit you to
mixing spot colors with just black, as traditional duotones do).
107
Chapter 7: Working with Color
The bad way to create colors
Many people try to use the Color panel
(Window➪Color or F6) to define colors, which
can be a mistake. At first, you might not realize
that you can create colors from the Color panel.
It shows a gradation of the last color used and
lets you change the tint for that color on the cur-
rent object. But if you go to its flyout menu and
choose a color model (RGB, CMYK, or Lab), you
get a set of mixing controls.
So what’s the problem? Colors created through
the Color panel won’t appear in your Swatches
panel, so they can’t be used for other objects.
They are called unnamed colors because they
don’t appear in the Swatches panel, but may be
used by objects in a document, which can cause
problems for when you print. (Adobe added them
to InDesign to be consistent with how Illustrator
defines colors — a foolish consistency.)
Fortunately, there is a way to prevent unnamed
colors: If you go to the Color panel and modify a
color without thinking about it, choose Add
Unnamed Colors from the Swatches panel’s flyout
menu to add the modified color to the Swatches
panel. Of course, if you forget to do this, you have
an unnamed color, so it’s best to think Swatches
panel when you think about adding or editing
colors instead of the more obvious Color panel.
Even better, close the Color panel so you’re not
tempted to use it in the first place.
Similarly, don’t use this InDesign feature: the
ability to create colors by double-clicking the
Stroke and Fill buttons on the Tools panel, using
a Photoshop-style color picker. As with colors
created in the Color panel, you can rectify this
sin by adding any colors created this way to the
Swatches panel by using the Swatches panel’s
Add Unnamed Colors menu item. Otherwise,
you run the same risk as creating colors through
the Color panel.

To create a mixed-ink swatch, follow these steps:
1. Select the spot color you want to begin with and then choose New
Mixed Ink Swatch from the Swatches panel’s flyout menu.
The New Mixed Ink Swatch dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 7-3.
2. Select the percentages of the spot color and any or all of the default
process colors you want to mix and give the new color a name.
3. Click Add to add another mixed-ink swatch based on the current spot
color.
If you’re creating just one color, click OK instead of Add. You can click
Cancel to abort the current mixed-ink color definition.
4. Click OK when you’re finished.
There’s a related option in the Swatches panel’s flyout menu called New
Mixed Ink Group. This lets you create a set of colors from the same mix. You
get to set the initial percentage of each color you want in the mix and the
final value, as well as how many increments of each color you want. InDesign
then takes all this information and creates a bunch of color swatches that
combine each of the colors at each level so you get a whole range of colors.
The idea is to get a set of related colors created for you, such as a set of blue-
green hues that range from light aqua to dark marine. Experiment with this
expert feature to see what it can do for you.

Part II: Document Essentials 

Defining Tints
A tint is simply a shade of a color. InDesign lets you create such tints as sepa-
rate color swatches — like any other color — so they’re easy to use for multi-
ple items. The process is easy:
1. In the Swatches panel, select a color from which you want to create
a tint.
2. Using the Swatches panel’s flyout menu, select New Tint Swatch.
The New Tint Swatch dialog box, shown in Figure 7-4, appears.
3. Click and drag the slider to adjust the tint, or type a value in a field on
the right.
4. Click Add to create another tint from the same base color, and then
click OK when you’re finished. (If you’re adding a single tint, there’s
no need to click Add; just click OK when done.)
Click Cancel if you change your mind about the current tint. Any new
tint will have the same name as the original color and the percentage of
shading, such as Sky Blue 66%.
You can create a tint from a tint, which can be confusing. Fortunately,
InDesign goes back to the original color when letting you create the new
tint. Thus, if you select Sky Blue 66% and move the slider to 33%, you get
a 33 percent tint of the original Sky Blue, not a 33 percent tint of the Sky
Blue 66% (which would be equivalent to a 22 percent tint of the original
Sky Blue).
You modify and delete tint swatches like any other color swatch, using the
Swatches panel’s flyout menu.

them.
109
Chapter 7: Working with Color

You can also apply tints to objects without creating a separate swatch for
each tint. After applying the color (described later in this chapter), select the
object and change the value in the Tint field of the Swatches panel, or use its
pop-up menu’s predefined tint values. Easy as pie!
Working with Gradients
A long-popular design technique is the gradient (also called a blend or gradu-
ated fill ), which blends two or more colors in a sequence, going smoothly
from, say, green to blue to yellow to orange. InDesign has a powerful gradient-
creation feature that lets you define and apply gradients to pretty much any
object in InDesign, including text, lines, frames, shapes, and their outlines
(strokes).
Creating gradient swatches
In the Swatches panel, where you define colors and tints, you can also
define gradients. Just select the New Gradient Swatch option in the flyout
menu. You get the dialog box shown in Figure 7-5. The first two options are
straightforward:
 Type a name for the gradient in the Swatch Name field. Picking a name is
a bit more difficult than for a color, but use something like “Blue to Red”
or “Bright Multihue” or “Logo Gradient” that has a meaning specific to
the colors used or to its role in your document.
 In the Type pop-up menu, choose Linear or Radial. A linear blend goes in
one direction, while a radial blend radiates out in a circle from a central
point.
Figure 7-5:

Gradient

dialog box.

Part II: Document Essentials 

Now it gets a little tricky. Follow these steps:
1. Select a stop point — one of the squares at the bottom of the dialog
box on either end of the gradient ramp that shows the gradient as you
define it.
The stop points essentially define the start color (the stop point on the
left) and the end color (the stop point on the right). With a stop point
selected, you can now define its color.
2. Choose what color model you want to use — select from CMYK, RGB,
LAB, and Swatches in the Stop Color pop-up menu.
The area directly beneath the pop-up menu changes accordingly, dis-
playing sliders for CMYK, RGB, or LAB, or a list of all colors from the
Swatches panel for Swatches, depending on which model you choose.
3. Create or select the color you want for that stop point.
You can select the [Paper] swatch — essentially, transparency or no
color — as a stop point in a gradient. You can also click and drag
swatches from the Swatches panel to the gradient ramp.
4. Repeat Steps 1 to 3 for the other stop point.
Note that the color models for the two stop points don’t have to be the
same — you can blend from a Pantone spot color to a CMYK color, for
example. (If a gradient mixes spot colors and process colors, InDesign
converts the spot colors to process colors.)
You now have a simple gradient. But you don’t have to stop there. Here are
your other options:
 You can change the rate at which the colors transition by sliding the dia-
mond icons at the top of the gradient ramp.
 You can create additional stop points by clicking right below the gradi-
ent ramp. By having several stop points, you can have multiple color
transitions in a gradient. (Think of them like tab stops in text — you can
define as many as you need.) You delete unwanted stop points by click-
ing and dragging them to the bottom of the dialog box.
Notice that there’s a diamond icon between each pair of stop points — that
means each pair can have its own transition rate.
When you create a new gradient, InDesign uses the settings from the last one
you created. If you want to create a gradient similar to an existing one, click
that existing gradient before selecting New Gradient Swatch from the flyout
menu. InDesign copies the selected gradient’s settings to the new one, which
you can then edit. One reason to use this is to create, say, a radial version of
an existing linear gradient.
111
Chapter 7: Working with Color

The Swatches panel shows the actual gradient next to its name. The pattern
also appears in the Fill button or Stroke button in the Tools panel if that gra-
dient is currently selected as a fill or stroke, as well as in the Gradient button
in that panel, whether or not it’s currently applied as a fill or stroke.
Understanding the Gradient panel
Just as it does with unnamed colors, InDesign lets you create unnamed
gradients — gradients that have no swatches. Unlike unnamed colors, you
can use these to your heart’s content because all colors in a gradient are
converted to process colors and/or use defined spot-color swatches — so
there are no unnamed colors in their output. The process is pretty much
the same as creating a gradient swatch, except that you select an object and
then open the Gradient panel (Window➪Gradient). In that panel, you select
a stop point and then choose a color to apply to it by clicking a color in the
Swatches panel or in the Color panel. You create and adjust stop points here
just as you do when defining a gradient swatch.
The difference? Gradients in the Swatches panel can be reused, whereas gra-
dients applied through the Gradient panel cannot be. But you can add them
to the Swatches panel by right-clicking or Control+clicking the gradient in the
Tools panel’s Fill or Stroke button, and then choosing Add to Swatches in the
contextual menu that appears.
The Gradient panel can also manipulate gradient swatches: After you apply a
linear gradient — whether via a gradient swatch or as an unnamed gradient —
you can change the angle of the gradient, rotating the gradient within the
object. Just type the desired degree of rotation in the Angle field to rotate the
gradient’s direction by the value. Negative values rotate counterclockwise,
whereas positive values rotate clockwise.
Note that you can’t rotate a radial gradient because it’s circular and, thus,
any rotation has no effect. That’s why InDesign grays out the Angle field for
radial gradients.
But you can still adjust the location of a radial gradient — as well as that of a
linear gradient — by using the Gradient tool in the Tools panel. After applying
a gradient to an object, select the Gradient tool and draw a line in the object,
as shown in Figure 7-6:
 For a linear gradient, the start point of your line corresponds to where
you want the first stop point of the gradient to be; the end point of the
line corresponds to the last stop point. This lets you stretch or com-
press the gradient, as well as offset the gradient within the object. Also,
the angle at which you draw the line becomes the angle for the gradient.
 For a radial gradient, the line becomes the start and end point for the
gradient, in effect offsetting it.
112
Part II: Document Essentials 

The new Gradient Feather tool — accessed through the Gradient tool’s pop-
out menu or via the shortcut Shift+G — acts just like the Gradient tool except
that it starts with transparency as the initial “color,” as shown in Figure 7-6.
See Chapter 9 for more on gradient feather and other lighting effects.
Managing Swatches
When you create colors, tints, and gradients, it’s easy to go overboard and
make too many. You’ll also find that different documents have different
colors, each created by different people, and you’ll likely want to move colors
from one document to another. InDesign provides basic tools for managing
colors in and across documents.
Editing swatches
It’s easy to modify a swatch to change its settings: Just double-click it in the
Swatches panel. (You can also choose Swatch options from the Swatches
panel’s flyout menu.) The Swatch options dialog box will appear, a clone of
the New Color Swatch, New Tint Swatch, or New Gradient Swatch dialog box
(based on what kind of swatch you double-clicked).
Figure 7-6:

113
Chapter 7: Working with Color

There is a slight difference between the New Swatch dialog boxes and the
Swatch Option dialog boxes: The Swatch Option dialog boxes include the
Preview option, which lets you see your changes in a selected object (if it’s
visible on-screen, of course) as you make changes in the Swatch Options
dialog box.
Copying swatches
To duplicate a swatch, so you can create a new one based on it, use the
Duplicate Swatch option in the Swatches panel. The word copy will be added
to the name of the new swatch. You edit it — including its name — as you
would any swatch.
When selecting swatches for deletion or duplication, you can Ô+click or
Ctrl+click multiple swatches to work on all of them at once. Note that
Shift+clicking selects all swatches between the first swatch clicked and the
swatch that you Shift+click, whereas Ô+click or Ctrl+click lets you select spe-
cific swatches in any order and in any location in the panel.
Deleting swatches
InDesign makes deleting swatches easy: Just select the color, tint, or gradient
in the Swatches panel. Then choose Delete Swatch from the flyout menu, or
click the trash can iconic button at the bottom of the Swatches panel.
Well, that’s not quite it. You then get the Delete Swatch dialog box, which lets
you either assign a new color to anything using the deleted swatch (the
Defined Swatch option) or leave the color on any object that is using it but
delete the swatch from the Swatches panel (the Unnamed Swatch option).
(As explained earlier in this chapter, unnamed colors should be avoided, so if
your document uses a color, keep its swatch.)
If you delete a tint and replace it with another color, any object using that tint
will get the full-strength version of the new color, not a tint of it. Likewise, if
you delete a color swatch that you’ve based one or more tints on, those tints
will also be deleted if you replace the deleted swatch with an unnamed
swatch. However, if you delete a color swatch and replace it with a defined
swatch, any tints of that deleted swatch will retain their tint percentages of
the replacement-defined swatch.
InDesign offers a nice option to quickly find all unused colors in the Swatches
panel — the palette menu’s Select All Unused option. With this option, you
can delete all the unused colors in one fell swoop. Note that you don’t get the
option to assign each deleted color separately to another color in the Delete
Swatch dialog box — they all are replaced with the color you select or are
114
Part II: Document Essentials 

made into unnamed colors. Because no object uses these colors, choosing
Unnamed Swatch in essence is the same as replacing them with a color using
the Defined Swatch option.
115
Chapter 7: Working with Color
Sampling colors
You may wonder how you can use colors in your
imported graphics for which InDesign can’t find
any swatch information, such as in TIFF files or
photos embedded in a PDF file. As you might
expect, InDesign provides a way to capture
these colors: the Eyedropper tool. Here’s how it
works:
1. In the Tools panel or Swatches panel,
choose the Fill iconic button or Stroke
iconic button. It doesn’t really matter which
unless you will immediately create a shape
or enter text after capturing the desired
color; in that case, choose whichever
aspect you’ll want the new object or text to
have the color applied to.
2. Select the Eyedropper tool and then click
on the graphic where the desired color is
used. The Fill or Stroke iconic button will
now have that color. (If the Eyedropper tool
is not visible in the Tools panel, look for the
Measure tool, then click and hold down its
icon to get the pop-up menu that lets you
select the Eyedropper tool.)
3. The Eyedropper tool changes to the Marker
tool. Any object you select with the Marker
tool will have the color applied to its fill 
or stroke, depending on whether the Fill 
or Stroke iconic button is active. Note you
can switch between the Eyedropper and
Marker tools to select different colors and
apply them by holding the Option or Alt 
key to get the Eyedropper tool back, then
releasing it to switch to the Marker tool.
4. To add the new, unnamed color to the
Swatches panel, Control+click or right-
click the Fill iconic button or Stroke iconic
button (whichever has the captured color)
and choose Add to Swatches from the con-
textual menu that appears. Now you can
edit and apply the captured color like any
other color swatch.
The figure below shows a composite image that
highlights the Eyedropper tool at center left and
the Marker tool at right.

If you delete a swatch and replace it with an unnamed swatch, you can recap-
ture that deleted swatch later by choosing the Add Unnamed Colors menu
item in the Swatches panel’s flyout menu.
Importing swatches
A quick way to import specific colors from another InDesign document or
template is to click and drag the colors from that other file’s Swatches panel
into your current document or template.
You can import colors from other Creative Suite programs from which you
have saved Adobe Swatch Exchange color library files, choosing Load
Swatches from the Swatches panel’s flyout menu. You can also import
swatches directly from other InDesign documents. From the resulting dialog
box, navigate to the file that contains the colors you want to import, select
that file, and click Open.
When you import color swatches from other documents or Adobe Swatch
Exchange files, InDesign brings in all the colors. You cannot choose specific
colors to import.
Also, when you import a graphic file in PDF or EPS format, any named colors
(swatches) in that file are automatically added to the Swatches panel.
Exporting swatches
You can do more than import swatches. InDesign also lets you save swatches
into color library files for use by other Creative Suite 2 or 3 users. Just select
the colors you want to save and then choose Save Swatches from the
Swatches panel’s flyout menu. You are asked to give the color library file a
name before you save it.
InDesign does not include mixed-ink colors when you save swatches for use
by other Creative Suite programs. Any selected such swatches are simply
ignored.
Applying Swatches
Applying colors, tints, and gradients to objects in InDesign is easy. Select the
object, click the Formatting Affects Text button or Formatting Affects
Container iconic button in the Swatches or Gradient panel as appropriate. If
you’re using the Swatches panel, click the appropriate swatch; if you’re using
the Gradient panel, adjust the gradient as desired.
116
Part II: Document Essentials 

When it comes to coloring graphics in InDesign, you can apply color and tints
to grayscale and black-and-white bitmapped images, such as those in the
TIFF and Photoshop formats. But you cannot color vector-based graphics
(such as those in the Illustrator and EPS formats) or color bitmapped images.
Another way to apply colors, tints, and gradients is by selecting the object
and using the Formatting Affects Text, Formatting Affects Content, Fill, or
Stroke iconic buttons in the Tools panel to define what part of the object you
want to color. You can use the Swatches or Gradients panels to select a
swatch, or pick the last-used color and gradient from the Apply Color and
Apply Gradient iconic buttons on the Tools panel, shown in Figure 7-7.
For tints, you can use a tint swatch, or you can simply apply a color from the
Swatches panel and enter a tint value in the panel’s Tint field.
When applying color to text, you can apply it to all the text in the frame by
using the Formatting Affects Text iconic button (which is what the Formatting
Affects Contents iconic button is renamed when you select text), or to spe-
cific text by highlighting that text with the Type tool.
You can also apply color as part of your character and paragraph styles in
the Character Color pane when creating or editing styles. See Chapter 14 for
more on styles, and Chapters 15 through 17 for more on text formatting.
You can also apply colors and tints to gaps in strokes by using the Stroke
panel’s flyout menu (select Show Options and select a gap color). Open the
Stroke panel by choosing Window➪Stroke or by pressing Ô+F10 or Ctrl+F10.

Object Essentials

In this part . . .
T
he rubber really hits the road when you’ve got your
basic layout structure in place. Now you can focus 
on the meat of your documents: the objects that contain
your text and graphics. It’s amazing all objects you can
create — from simple rectangles to complex curves. And
it’s equally amazing all the things you can do to objects,
such as rotate them, align them, and apply special effects
like drop shadows and directional feathers (you’ll just
have to read on to see what these are!). And you can even
save a lot of these settings so you can apply them consis-
tently to other objects later — a real timesaver that also
ensures quality results. You’ll find out about all that and
more in this part.
Note that you can apply most of these effects to objects
whether or not they already contain their graphics and
text — so if you’re a really structured kind of person,
you’ll probably create your basic object containers first
and apply your effects to them and then bring in the 
text and graphics. But if you’re more free-form in your
approach, you’ll likely bring in all your text and graphics
and then start arranging the objects that contain them to
produce your final layout. Either way, you’ll apply the
techniques you discover here.

 Creating frames and shapes
 Creating lines and paths
 Applying strokes
T
he fundamental components of any layout are its objects. An object is a
container that can (but doesn’t have to) hold text or graphics, as well as
display attributes such as color, strokes, and gradients. This chapter explains
how to create these building blocks: frames, shapes, lines, and paths, as well
as the strokes you apply to them.
Creating Frames and Shapes
When an object contains an imported graphic or text, or if an object is cre-
ated as a placeholder for a graphic or text, it’s referred to as a frame in
InDesign. Otherwise, it is called a shape.
The difference between frames and shapes is artificial, and because a shape
can easily become a frame simply by placing text or graphics into it, it’s easi-
est to think of shapes and frames as the same thing. I tend to use the word
“frame” to mean either frames or shapes.
Designing pages in InDesign is largely a matter of creating and modifying
frames and shapes, as well as modifying the text and graphics that the frames
contain.
As Figure 8-1 shows, the Tools panel contains several tools for creating both
shapes and frames:
 The Rectangle, Ellipse, and Polygon shape tools (the Ellipse and Polygon
tools are available through the pop-up menu that appears if you click
and hold on the Rectangle tool).

 The Rectangle Frame, Ellipse Frame, and Polygon Frame tools (the
Ellipse Frame and Polygon Frame tools are available through the pop-up
menu that appears if you click and hold on the Rectangle Frame tool).
 The Type tool (which can create rectangular text frames in addition to
letting you work with text).
Here’s how to create a frame (or shape):
1. Select the desired tool from the Tools panel.
For the Polygon and Polygon Frame tools, you can set the shape and
number of sides by double-clicking the tool and then using the dialog box
that appears. Figure 8-2 shows that dialog box and example starburst.
2. Move the mouse pointer anywhere within the currently displayed
page or on the pasteboard.
3. Click and drag in any direction.
As you drag, a crosshair pointer appears in the corner opposite your
starting point; a colored rectangle indicates the boundary of the frame.
(The color will be blue for objects on the default layer; objects on other
layers will have that layer’s color. See Chapter 5 for more on layers.) You
can look at the width and height values displayed in the Control panel or
the Transform panel as you drag to help you get the size you want.
Holding down the Shift key as you drag limits the tool to creating a
frame or shape within a square bounding box.

4. When the frame is the size and shape you want, release the mouse
button.
Pretty easy, huh? At this point, you can begin typing in the frame, paste text
or a graphic into it, or import a text or a graphics file, as Chapters 11 and 17
explain.
If you create a text frame with the Type tool, be sure not to click in an exist-
ing text frame when your intention is to create a new one. If you click within
an existing frame when the Type tool is selected, the flashing cursor appears,
and InDesign thinks you want to type text.
When any of the frame-creation tools is selected, you can create as many new
frames as you want. Simply keep clicking, dragging, and releasing. After you
create a graphics frame, you can modify it (without changing tools) by adding
a border or a colored background or by applying any of the effects — such as
rotation, shear, and scale — in the Control panel. You can also move or resize
a graphics frame, but you have to switch to the Selection tool or the Direct
Selection tool to do so. Chapter 9 explains how to resize, move, delete, and
otherwise manipulate frames and other objects.
Reshaping Frames and Shapes
Sometimes, a frame or shape needs to be more than resized or moved. It
needs to be reshaped. InDesign makes it easy to change an object’s shape:
 The simplest way is to select an object with the Direct Selection tool,
and then drag any of the handles or frame edges. Notice how the frame’s
shape actually changes, as show in Figure 8-3.
Figure 8-2:

Settings
dialog box

will have.
123
Chapter 8: Creating Essential Elements

 To change a shape more radically, choose the desired shape from
Object➪Convert Shape’s submenu. Your choices are Rectangle, Rounded
Rectangle, Beveled Rectangle, Inverse Rounded Rectangle, Ellipse,
Triangle, Polygon, Line, and Orthogonal Line. (Note that if you choose
Polygon, InDesign will use whatever the last polygon settings were,
which you can see by double-clicking the Polygon or Polygon Frame
tool. Also, if you try to convert a text frame into a line, InDesign will
abort the action, telling you it can’t do the conversion.)
 You can manually edit a shape by adding or removing anchor points —
the points in a shape’s edges that you can adjust, as described in the
next section.
InDesign CS3 introduces a quick new way to switch between the Selection
tool and the Direct Selection tool: Just double-click an object.
Creating Lines and Paths
When you’re drawing the old-fashioned way, with pen and paper, you typi-
cally use one tool to draw straight lines, curved lines, and free-form objects.
InDesign is less flexible, using different tools for different kinds of lines.
InDesign lets you create straight lines with the Line tool and zigzag lines,
curved lines, and free-form shapes with the Pen and Type on a Path tools.
(Those non-straight lines and free-form shapes are called paths in InDesign.)
Drawing a straight line
Although they’re not as flashy or versatile as shapes and paths, lines can
serve many useful purposes in well-designed pages. For example, you can use
plain ol’ vertical rules to separate columns of text in a multicolumn page or
the rows and columns of data in a table. Dashed lines are useful for indicating
folds and cut lines on brochures and coupons. And lines with arrowheads are
handy if you have to create a map or a technical illustration.
Figure 8-3:

124
Part III: Object Essentials 

Follow these steps to draw a simple, straight line:
1. Select the Line tool (or press \).
(Figure 8-1 shows the Line tool.)
2. Move the pointer anywhere within the currently displayed page or on
the pasteboard.
3. Click and drag the mouse in any direction.
As you drag, a thin, blue line appears from the point where you first
clicked to the current position of the cross-hair pointer. Holding down
the Shift key as you drag constrains the line to a horizontal, vertical, or
45-degree diagonal line.
4. When the line is the length and angle you want, release the mouse
button.
Don’t worry too much about being precise when you create a line. You
can always go back later and fine-tune it.
When you release the mouse button after creating a line, the line is active. As
illustrated in Figure 8-4, if the Selection tool was previously selected, the line
appears within a rectangular bounding box, which contains eight resizing han-
dles. If the Direct Selection tool was previously selected, moveable anchor
points appear at the ends of the line. In either case, you have to choose the
right tool if you want to change the shape or size of the bounding box or the
line:
 The Selection tool lets you change the shape of the line’s bounding box
(which also changes the angle and length of the line) by dragging any of
the resizing handles.
 The Direct Selection tool lets you change the length and angle of the line
itself by moving anchor points on the frame.

Chapter 8: Creating Essential Elements

As long as the Line tool is selected, you can create as many new lines as you
want. Simply keep clicking, dragging, and releasing.
When you create a line, it takes on the characteristics specified in the Stroke
panel (Window➪Stroke, or Ô+F10 or Ctrl+10), covered later in this chapter.
When you first open a document, the default line width is 1 point. If you want
to change the appearance of your lines, double-click the Line tool and adjust
the Weight setting in the Stroke panel that appears. If you make this adjustment
when no document is open, all new documents will use the new line settings.
Understanding paths
Paths are a lot more complex than lines, so it’s important that you under-
stand some of the theory behind paths because that knowledge will help you
create and manipulate them more easily.
Every object you create with InDesign’s object-creation tools is a path.
Regardless of the tool you use to create a path, you can change its appear-
ance by modifying any of four properties that all paths share:
 Closure: A path is either open or closed. Straight lines created with the
Line tool and curved and zigzag lines created with the Pen tool are
examples of open paths. Basic shapes created with the Ellipse,
Rectangle, and Polygon tools and free-form shapes created with the Pen
and Pencil tools are examples of closed shapes. A closed free-form
shape is an uninterrupted path with no end points.
 Stroke: If you want to make a path visible, you can apply a stroke to it by
selecting it with a selection tool, entering a Weight value in the Stroke
panel (covered later in this chapter) (Window➪Stroke or Ô+F10 or
Ctrl+F10), and selecting a color from the Swatches panel (see Chapter 7).
(An unselected, unstroked path is not visible.)
 Fill: A color, color tint, or gradient applied to the background of a path is
called a fill. You apply fills by using the Swatches panel.
 Contents: You can place a text file or a graphics file in any path except a
straight line. When a path is used to hold text or a graphic, the path func-
tions as a frame. Although InDesign can place text or graphics in an open
path, placing text and pictures in closed paths is far more common than
placing them in open paths. In addition to putting text inside paths, you
can also have text on the path itself, following its shape, as Chapter 17
explains.
126
Part III: Object Essentials 

No matter how simple or complicated, all paths are made up of the same
components. Figure 8-5 shows the parts that make up a path:
 A path contains one or more straight or curved segments.
 An anchor point is located at each end of every segment. The anchor
points at the ends of a closed path are called end points. When you
create a path of any kind, anchor points are automatically placed at the
end of each segment. After you create a path, you can move, add, delete,
and change the direction of corner points.
 InDesign has two kinds of anchor points: smooth points and corner
points. A smooth point connects two adjoining curved segments in a
continuous, flowing curve. At a corner point, adjoining segments —
straight or curved — meet at an angle. The corners of a rectangular path
are the most common corner points.
 A direction line runs through each anchor point and has a handle at both
ends. You can control the curve that passes through an anchor point by
dragging a direction line’s handles, as I explain a little later on.
Drawing your own paths
Even if you’re an artistic master with a piece of charcoal or a Number 2 pencil,
you need to practice with the Pen tool for a while before your drawing skills
kick in. The good news is that after you get comfortable using the Pen tool, you
can draw any shape you can imagine. (Of course, if you can’t draw very well in
the first place, using the Pen tool won’t magically transform you into a master
illustrator!) If this is new terrain for you, start simply and proceed slowly.

127
Chapter 8: Creating Essential Elements

When creating paths, use as few anchor points as possible. As you become
more comfortable creating free-form paths, you should find yourself using
fewer anchor points to create paths.
For an easy way to draw free-form shapes, use the Pencil tool. This tool
simply traces the movement of your mouse (or pen tablet) as you move it,
much like a pencil works on paper. Although not as exact as the Pen tool, the
Pencil tool creates Bézier curves that you can later edit. Note that the Pencil
tool is not meant for creating straight lines — unless you are capable of draw-
ing perfectly straight lines by hand, that is.
Straight and zigzag lines
Follow these steps to draw lines with straight segments, such as a zigzag:
1. Select the Pen tool.
2. Move the Pen pointer to where you want to start your line segment.
3. Click and release the mouse button. (Make sure you don’t drag before
you release the mouse button.)
An anchor point appears; it looks like a small, filled-in square.
4. Move the Pen pointer to where you want to place the next anchor
point.
5. Click and release the mouse button.
InDesign draws a straight line between the two anchor points. The first
anchor point changes to a hollow square, and the second anchor point
is filled in, which indicates that it is the active anchor point.
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 for each additional anchor point.
To reposition an anchor point after you click the mouse button but
before you release it, hold down the spacebar and drag. Otherwise, you
need to select it with the Direct Selection tool after you finish drawing
the line and then click and drag it to its new location.
7. To complete the path, Ô+click or Ctrl+click elsewhere on the page or
simply choose another tool.
If you Ô+click or Ctrl+click, the Pen tool remains active, so you can con-
tinue creating new paths.
Curved lines
Knowing how to draw zigzag lines is fine, but chances are, you want to draw
curved shapes as well. The basic process is similar to drawing straight seg-
ments, but drawing curved paths (technically called Bézier paths) is more
complicated and will take you some time to get the hang of.
128
Part III: Object Essentials 

If you want to draw a continuously curvy path that contains no corner points
and no straight segments, you should create only smooth points as you draw.
Here’s how:
1. Select the Pen tool.
2. Move the Pen pointer to where you want to start the curve segment.
3. Click and hold down the mouse button.
The arrowhead pointer appears.
4. Drag the mouse in the direction of the next point you intend to create
and then release the mouse button.
As you drag, the anchor point, its direction line, and the direction line’s
two handles are displayed, as shown in Figure 8-6.
If you hold down the Shift key as you drag, the angle of the direction line
is limited to increments of 45 degrees.

129
Chapter 8: Creating Essential Elements
How smooth and corner points work
Bézier paths have two kinds of points to join
segments: corner and smooth.
The two segments that form a smooth point’s
direction line work together as a single, straight
line. When you move a handle, the line acts like
a teeter-totter; the opposite handle moves in the
opposite direction. If you shorten one of the seg-
ments, the length of the other segment doesn’t
change. The angle and length of direction lines
determine the shape of the segments with which
they’re associated.
A corner point that connects two curved seg-
ments has two direction lines; a corner point that
connects two straight segments has no direction
lines; and a corner point that connects a straight
and curved segment has one direction line. If you
drag a corner point’s direction line, the other
direction line, if there is one, is not affected.

5. Move the Pen pointer to where you want to place the next anchor
point — and end the first segment — and then drag the mouse.
If you drag in roughly the same direction as the direction line of the pre-
vious point, you create an S-shaped curve; if you drag in the opposite
direction, you create a C-shaped curve.
6. When the curve between the two anchor points looks how you want it
to look, release the mouse button.
Alternatively, when you want to connect curved segments to corner
points (shown in Figure 8-7), move the Pen pointer to where you want to
place the next anchor point — and end the first segment — and then
press and hold Option or Alt as you click and drag the mouse. As you
drag, the anchor point’s handle moves, and the direction line changes
from a straight line to two independent segments. The angle of the direc-
tion line segment that you create when you drag the handle determines
the slope of the next segment.
7. Repeat Steps 5 and 6 for each additional desired curved segment.
8. To complete the path, Ô+click or Ctrl+click elsewhere on the page or
simply choose another tool.
If you Ô+click or Ctrl+click, the Pen tool remains active, so you can
create new paths.
You can also complete the path by clicking on the first point you cre-
ated. This creates a closed path.

Part III: Object Essentials 

Closed paths
A closed path is simply a path that ends where it began. When it comes to cre-
ating closed paths with the Pen tool, the process is exactly the same as for
creating open paths, as explained earlier in this section, with one difference
at the end:
 To create a straight segment between the end point and the last anchor
point you created, click and release the mouse button.
 To create a curved segment, click and drag the mouse in the direction of
the last anchor point you created, and then release the mouse button.
Just like an open path, a closed path can contain straight and/or curved seg-
ments and smooth and/or corner anchor points. All the techniques explained
earlier in this chapter for drawing lines with curved and straight segments
and smooth and corner points apply when you draw closed paths.
You can also, of course, edit and adjust your curves in InDesign. But this
requires some more expertise with drawing tools such as those in Adobe
Illustrator and is beyond the scope of this book. Check out Illustrator CS3 For
Dummies by Ted Alspach or Adobe InDesign CS3 Bible by Galen Gruman (both
by Wiley Publishing) for more details.
Applying Strokes
All objects have a stroke with a width of 0 built in, so you never really have to
add strokes. But to use them, you need to modify them so they have some
thickness onto which you can apply attributes such as colors and gradients.
131
Chapter 8: Creating Essential Elements
Adding fills
The option to add a stroke to any shape
becomes even more powerful when combined
with the option to fill any shape with a color or
tint. For example, adding a fill to a text frame is
an effective way to draw attention to a sidebar.
Adding a fill to a shape is much like adding a
stroke, and the options available for specifying
color and tint are identical. The only difference is
that you click the Fill button in the Tools panel or
Swatches panel rather than the Stroke button.

Setting stroke appearance
The Stroke panel is where you give the stroke its width, as well as apply the
type of stroke and other attributes:
The shortcut for the Stroke panel has changed in InDesign CS3: It is now
Ô+F10 or Ctrl+F10, no longer just F10. (F10 still works, though it may conflict
with the Mac’s Exposé software.)
1. Select either of the selection tools and click the object whose stroke
you want to modify.
2. If the Stroke panel is not displayed, show it by choosing
Window➪Stroke or by pressing Ô+F10 or Ctrl+F10.
Figure 8-8 shows the panel.
3. To change the width of the stroke, enter a new value in the Weight
field.
You can also change the Weight value by choosing a new value from the
field’s pop-up menu or by clicking the up and down arrows. (Each click
increases or decreases the stroke by 1 point.)
4. Set the Miter Limit.
The default of 4 is fine for almost all frames. You rarely need to use this
feature, so don’t worry about it.
5. Click any of the three Cap iconic buttons to specify how dashes will
look if you create a dashed stroke (covered in Step 9).
Experiment with them in your objects to see which looks best for your
situation.
Figure 8-8:

panel (top)

132
Part III: Object Essentials 

6. Click any of the three Join iconic buttons to specify how corners are
handled.
Again, experiment with these to see what works best for you.
7. Choose an Align Stroke option.
The default is the first button, Align Stroke to Center, which has the stroke
straddle the frame. You can also choose Align Stroke to Inside, which
places the entire thickness inside the frame boundary, or Align Stroke to
Outside, which places the entire thickness outside the frame boundary.
8. You can also choose end points for your strokes (this only affects
lines, not rectangles, ellipses, and other closed-loop shapes) by using
the Start and End pop-up menus.
Figure 8-9 shows the options.
9. To create a dashed line instead of a solid line, choose an option from
the Type pop-up menu.
(These are also available from the Control panel.) Choose from 18 types
of predefined dashes and stripes. The Gap Color and Gap Tint fields at
the bottom of the Stroke panel become active as well, to let you choose
a specific color and tint for the gaps in dashes and stripes.
Now that you have a visible stroke, you want to color it. Here’s how:
1. Select either of the selection tools and click the frame to which you
want to add a stroke.
2. Click the Stroke button in the Swatches panel or Tools panel.
Figure 8-9:
The Start
options in
the Stroke
panel. (The
End options
are
identical.)
133
Chapter 8: Creating Essential Elements

3. You now can click a color, tint, or gradient from the Swatches panel,
or click one of the three boxes at the bottom of the Tools panel, which
let you use (from left to right) the last-selected color, last-selected gra-
dient, or None. (This removes the stroke’s color, tint, or gradient.)
For information about adding colors to the Swatches panel and applying
colors to objects, see Chapter 7.
Creating stroke styles
InDesign lets you create custom strokes, known as stroke styles, in any of
three types: dashed, dotted, and striped. To create custom dashes or stripes,
choose the Stroke Styles option in the Stroke panel’s flyout menu. In the
resulting Stroke Styles dialog box, you can create new strokes, edit or delete
existing ones, and import strokes from a stroke styles file, which you create
by saving a document’s strokes as a separate file for import into other docu-
ments. Stroke style files have the filename extension .inst.
Note that you cannot edit or delete the seven default stripe patterns shown
in the Stroke Styles dialog box, nor can you edit or delete the default dash
patterns — they’re not even available in the dialog box. When you edit or
create a stroke pattern, you get the New Stroke Style dialog box, shown in
Figure 8-10. In the Name field, enter a name for your stroke. In the Type pop-
up menu, you can choose to create (or convert a stripe you are editing to) a
dashed, dotted, or striped stroke.
Figure 8-10:
The dashes
version of
the New
Stroke Style
dialog box.
134
Part III: Object Essentials 

For dashes, you can resize the dash component by dragging the down-pointing
triangle at the end of the dash in the ruler section. You can add dash segments
by simply clicking the ruler and dragging a segment to the desired width. Or
you can use the Start and Length fields to manually specify them. The Pattern
Length field is where you indicate the length of the segment that will be
repeated to create a dashed line.
In the Corners pop-up menu, you tell InDesign whether to adjust how the
dashes and gaps are handled at corners; the default is Adjust Dashes and
Gaps, a setting you should keep — it will make sure your corners have dash
segments that extend along both sides of the corner, which looks neater.
(Your other options are Adjust Dashes, Adjust Gaps, and None.) You can also
choose a cap style and the stroke weight. The preview section of the pane
lets you see your dash as you create or edit it.
For dots, you get a similar dialog box as for dashes. The Start and Length
fields disappear, replaced with the Center field that determines where any
added dots are placed on the ruler. (The initial dot, shown as a half-circle,
starts at 0 and cannot be moved or deleted.) The Caps field is also gone.
To delete a dash or dot segment, just drag it to the left, off the ruler.
For stripes, you also get a similar dialog box. The principle is the same as for
dashes: You create segments (in this case vertical, not horizontal) for the
stripes by dragging on the ruler. However, the stripes version of the dialog
box expresses its values in percentages because the actual thickness of each
stripe is determined by the stroke weight — the thicker the stroke, the
thicker each stripe is in the overall stroke.
In all three versions of the New Stroke Style dialog box, you click Add to add
the stroke to your document, and then you can create a new stroke. When
you’re done creating strokes, click OK. (When editing a stroke, the Add
button won’t be available.)
Be sure to use the Preview Weight slider shown in Figure 8-10. This is avail-
able in all three versions of the New Stroke Style dialog box. It lets you
increase or decrease the preview size so you can better see thin or small ele-
ments in your stroke.

rames, shapes, lines, and paths are the building blocks of your layout.
But as anyone who ever played with Legos or Tinkertoys knows, it’s how
you manipulate the building blocks that results in a unique creation, whether
it be a Lego house, a Tinkertoys crane, or an InDesign layout.
InDesign provides a lot of control over layout objects so that you can create
really interesting, dynamic publications suited to any purpose. In this chap-
ter, I explain the controls that apply to all objects.
This chapter focuses on various effects and actions that apply to any frame
or path. Chapter 17 covers various actions specific to text frames and paths,
while Chapter 19 covers actions specific to graphics frames. Chapter 8
explains how to add frames, shapes, lines, and paths in the first place.
Chapter 11 explains how to align objects and precisely position them.
Selecting Objects
Before you can manipulate an object, you have to select it so that InDesign
knows what you want to work on. To select an object (rather than its con-
tents), use the Selection tool. Selected items will display their item boundary
(a rectangle that encompasses the object) as well as eight small resizing han-
dles (one at each of the four corners and one midway between each side of
the item boundary). Figure 9-1 shows an example.

To select an individual object, just click it with the Selection tool. To select
multiple objects, you have several options:
 Click the first object and Shift+click each additional object.
 Click and drag the mouse to create a selection rectangle (called a mar-
quee) that encompasses at least part of each desired object. When you
release the mouse, all objects that this marquee touches are selected.
 Choose Edit➪Select All or press Ô+A or Ctrl+A to select all objects on
the current spread.
If an object is on a master page and you’re working on a document page, you
must Shift+Ô+click or Ctrl+Shift+click the object to select it. How do you
know whether an object is on a master page? Easy: If you try to select it by
clicking and it doesn’t become selected, it must be on a master page.
Choose View➪Show Frame Edges or press Control+Ô+H or Ctrl+H to see
object edges if they aren’t already visible.
The shortcut for View➪Show Frame Edges has changed in InDesign CS3 for
Mac: It is now Control+Ô+H (the Windows shortcut, Ctrl+H, is unchanged).
These options are pretty easy, but it can get tricky when you want to select
objects that overlap or are obscured by other objects (see Chapter 11 for
more details on object stacking). So how do you select them?
One way is to use the Select Previous Object or Select Next Object iconic but-
tons in the Control panel. (If you Shift+click either button, InDesign jumps past
four objects and selects the fifth one. If you Ô+click or Control+click either
button, InDesign selects to the bottommost or topmost object, respectively.)

138
Part III: Object Essentials 

If you use the Select Previous Object or Select Next Object iconic buttons and
reach the top or bottom of the object stack, InDesign CS3 now cycles back.
For example, if you reach the topmost object and click Select Previous
Object, InDesign CS3 now moves to the bottommost object. In previous ver-
sions, you had to go all the way back to the bottom by using the Select Next
Object button — there was no way to just loop around.
Another way to select buried objects is by using the Select submenu option
in the Object menu.
The first four options in the Select submenu let you select another object rel-
ative to the currently selected object:
 First Object Above (Option+Shift+Ô+] or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+]) selects the
topmost object.
 Next Object Above (Option+Ô+] or Ctrl+Alt+]) selects the object imme-
diately on top of the current object.
 Next Object Below (Option+Ô+[ or Ctrl+Alt+[) selects the object immedi-
ately under the current object.
 Last Object Below (Option+Shift+Ô+[ or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+[) selects the
bottommost object.
If no objects are selected, InDesign bases its selection on the order in which
the objects were created, the topmost object being the one that was most
recently created.
You can also access these four selection options by Control+clicking or right-
clicking an object and choosing the Select menu from the contextual menu
that appears.
The Select submenu has four other options:
 If you select an object’s content (text or graphic), choose Object➪
Select➪Container to choose the frame or path. Using this option is the
same as selecting the object with the Selection tool.
 If an object has content (text or graphic) and you select it, choose
Object➪Select➪Content to choose the content within the object. This is
basically the same as selecting the frame with the Direct Selection tool
(which I explain later in this chapter).
 If you select an object in a group of objects by using the Direct Selection
tool, choose Object➪Select➪Previous Object in Group to navigate to the
previous object in the group.
 Similarly, if you select an object in a group of objects by using the Direct
Selection tool, choose Object➪Select➪Next Object in Group to navigate
to the next object in the group.
139
Chapter 9: Manipulating Objects

Object creation order determines what is “previous” or “next” in a group.
The Control panel also provides iconic buttons to select the next or previous
object, as well as to select the content or container (frame). These last two
buttons appear only if you have selected a group. The buttons for selecting
the next or previous object appear only if you are using the Direct Selection
tool, while the buttons for selecting the content or container appear whether
you are using the Selection or Direct Selection tool. (Yes, this is very confus-
ing!) Figure 9-2 shows the buttons.
To deselect objects, just click another object, an empty part of your page, or
the pasteboard. To deselect individual objects after you have selected multi-
ple objects, Shift+click those you want to deselect.
The Direct Selection tool lets you select any of the individual anchor points
(and direction handles of free-form shapes and curved lines) on an object. If
you use the Direct Selection tool to click an object that has a bounding box, the
shape within is selected, and the bounding box is deselected. You use this tool
to work on the contents independently of its container frame. You can also
move a graphic within its frame by clicking within the object (see Chapter 19).
Resizing and Scaling Objects
Two closely related features are resizing and scaling. What’s the difference?
Resizing affects just the container — the frame or path — whereas scaling
affects both the container and its contents.

Part III: Object Essentials 

Resizing objects
You resize objects in pretty much the same way you move them: by using the
mouse for inexact sizes or the Control panel for precise sizes.
To resize an object with the mouse, click and drag one of the frame’s (or
path’s) handles with the Selection tool. (Hold the Shift key as you drag to main-
tain the proportions of the frame.) Drag a corner handle to resize both the
width and height or a side handle to resize just the height or width. This will
leave the contents’ size unchanged but change the size of the frame or path.
You can also enter new values in the W: and H: fields (for width and height) of
the Control panel. This action also does not change the contents’ size.
Remember those reference points for positioning an object from Chapter 1?
They come into play for resizing objects as well. Basically, the object will
grow or shrink starting from the selected reference point, called the control
point. So if the upper-left reference point is selected and you enter greater W:
and H: values, the object will add the extra width to the right and the extra
height below. But if you choose the center reference point, it will grow on
both sides as well as on the top and bottom, spreading the extra size evenly.
Another way to resize a frame — this doesn’t apply to paths — is to choose
Object➪Fit Frame to Content or press Option+Ô+C or Ctrl+Alt+C. For a
graphic, this makes the frame the same size as the graphic itself. For text, this
increases or decreases the depth of the text frame to match the depth of the
text; it does not widen or narrow the frame.
Double-clicking one of a frame’s four handles — the squares at the midpoints
of each side — will resize the frame to the content in that axis. For example,
double-clicking the left or right handles will fit the frame to the contents’
width, while double-clicking the top or bottom handle will fit the frame to the
contents’ height. Likewise, double-clicking a corner handle will resize the
frame in both directions.
Scaling objects
InDesign offers several ways to scale an object, resizing both its contents and
its frame (or path):
 Enter percentage values in the Scale X Percentage and Scale Y Percentage
fields of the Control panel. If the icon to the right of these fields shows a
solid chain, adjusting one field automatically adjusts the other by the
same percentage, creating proportional resizing. If the icon shows a
broken chain, the two dimensions will be resized independently, distort-
ing the contents. Click the iconic button to toggle between the unbroken
chain and broken chain icons.
141
Chapter 9: Manipulating Objects

 You can also scale an object using the mouse. Select the object with the
Selection tool, make sure the desired control point is active to control
where the scaling operation starts, and then select the Scale tool. Now
drag the mouse away from the object to enlarge it or into the object to
reduce it. Objects scaled this way are scaled unproportionally; to scale
the object proportionally, hold the Shift key when moving the mouse.
(You can also use the Free Transform tool in the same way.)
 For graphics frames, use the content-fitting options in the Object menu
and Control panel, described in Chapter 19.
Moving Objects
The easiest way to move an object is by using the mouse. With the Selection
tool, click an object and drag it to a new location. When you release the
mouse, the object will be deposited in the new location.
If you want to more precisely move an object, you can enter specific X: and Y:
coordinates in the Control panel, as explained in Chapter 11.
Be sure to select the correct reference point to be used as the control point
when entering coordinates. The little squares at the top-left of the Control
panel and Transform panel represent the object’s reference points (corners,
side midpoints, and center). Click a reference point to make it the control
point (it will turn black, the others will turn white); all coordinates are now
based on this point.
Deleting Objects
Alas, not all the objects you create will survive all the way to the final version
of your publication. Some will wind up on the cutting room floor. You can
always move an object to the pasteboard if you’re not sure whether you want
to get rid of it altogether (objects on the pasteboard don’t print). But when
it’s time to ax an object, oblivion is just a keystroke or two away.
If you delete a text or graphics frame or path, the contents are removed as
well as the frame.
Here’s how to delete objects: Using any selection tool, select the object or
objects you want to delete and then press the Delete key or Backspace key.
You can also delete a selected item by choosing Edit➪Clear.
142
Part III: Object Essentials 

Choosing Edit➪Cut or pressing Ô+X or Ctrl+X also removes a selected object.
However, in this case a copy of the object is saved to the Clipboard and can
be pasted elsewhere (by choosing Edit➪Paste or by pressing Ô+V or Ctrl+V)
until you cut or copy something else or you shut down your computer.
Preventing Objects from Printing
InDesign lets you prevent a specific object from printing. To do so, select the
object with the Selection or Direct Selection tool, open the Attributes panel
(Window➪Attributes), and then select the Nonprinting check box. (The other
settings in this panel duplicate stroke settings covered in Chapter 8.)
You use this feature for comments and other elements that should not print
but that the designer needs to have visible on-screen. Another approach to
nonprinting objects is to place them all on a layer and make the entire layer
nonprinting, as explained in Chapter 5.
Transforming Objects
InDesign offers several tools and methods for transforming objects. I discuss
resizing, scaling, and moving earlier in this chapter, but there are several
other useful transformation tools, including rotating, shearing (skewing), flip-
ping, and reshaping.
Rotating is just spinning an object around. Shearing is a little more compli-
cated: Shearing skews an object (slanting it in one direction) while also rotating
the other axis at the same time. Regardless of whether you use the mouse or
numeric controls to apply rotation and/or shearing to graphics, you first need
to follow these steps:
1. Select the Selection tool.
2. Click the object you want to modify.
3. If you want, change the object’s control point (by default it’s the
upper-left corner of a frame or shape).
You can change the control point by clicking one of the little black
boxes — the reference points — in the upper-left corner of the Control
panel.
4. Choose the appropriate tool — Rotate, Shear, or Free Transform — or
use the flip options in the Control panel.
Figure 9-3 shows the Tools panel and Control panel iconic buttons for
these controls.
143
Chapter 9: Manipulating Objects

If you hold down the Option or Alt key while using a transformation tool, the
modification will be performed on a copy of the selected object, rather than
on the object itself.
Rotating objects
After you have selected the Rotate tool, click and drag a selected object to
rotate it — the object will rotate following your mouse movement. (Holding
down the Shift key while dragging limits rotation increments to multiples of
45 degrees.)
For more precise rotation, use the Control panel. You can change the angle of a
selected object by entering a value in the Rotation field. If you choose to enter
a value in the Rotation field, positive values rotate the selected item counter-
clockwise around the control point; negative values rotate it clockwise.
Or you can choose one of the predefined angles from the Rotation Angle field’s
pop-up menu, or choose any of the three rotation options — Rotate 180°,
Rotate 90° CW, and Rotate 90° CCW — in the Control panel’s flyout menu.

144
Part III: Object Essentials 

If you choose one of these flyout menu options, the current angle of the
selected object is added to the applied angle. For example, if you choose
Rotate 90° CCW (counterclockwise), an object that’s currently rotated 12
degrees will end up with a rotation angle of 102 degrees.
No matter what method you choose to rotate an object, the center of rotation
will be whatever control point is selected in the Control panel.
To “unrotate” an object, enter a Rotation Angle value of 0.
Shearing objects
After you have selected the Shear tool, click and drag a selected object to shear
it. (Holding down the Shift key constrains the selected object’s rotation value to
increments of 45 degrees.) If you drag the mouse in a straight line parallel with
one set of edges (such as the top and bottom), you skew the graphic (just slant
it in one direction). But if you move the mouse in any other direction, you slant
the object’s edges closest to the direction that you move the mouse the fur-
thest and rotate the rest of the graphic. Give it a few tries to see what happens.
As with other functions, you can also use the Control panel for more precise
control. Just enter a Shear X Angle value in the Control panel or choose a pre-
defined value from the field’s pop-up menu. Positive shear values slant an
object to the right (that is, the top edge of the object is moved to the right),
whereas negative values slant an object to the left (the bottom edge is moved
to the right). You can enter shear values between 1 and 89 (although values
above 70 cause considerable distortion).
Note that when you use the Shear tool, you change the selected object’s
angle of rotation and skew angle simultaneously. If you use the mouse, you
145
Chapter 9: Manipulating Objects
Using the Free Transform tool
Advanced users will like the Free Transform
tool. When you select this tool, InDesign lets
you scale, rotate, and resize — but not shear —
selected objects — as follows:
 If you click within the frame, you can move
the object by dragging it.
 If you select a frame handle (whether
corner or midpoint), you can resize the
object by dragging.
 Finally, if you move the mouse very close to
a frame handle, you will see a curved arrow,
which indicates that you can rotate the
object around that object’s center point.
Having a tool that does more than one thing can
be confusing, but once you get the hang of it, it
sure beats constantly changing tools!

can in effect get different skew and rotation angles based on how you move
the mouse, but if you use the Control panel, both the skew and rotation will
have the same angles applied.
To “unshear” an object, enter a Shear X Angle value of 0.
Flipping objects
The Object menu has two flipping commands: Object➪Transform➪Flip
Horizontal and Object➪Transform➪Flip Vertical. They are also available in
the Control panel as iconic buttons.
These controls let you make a mirror image of a selected object and its con-
tents. If you choose Flip Horizontal, the graphic is flipped along a vertical axis
(that is, the right edge and left edge exchange places); if you choose Flip
Vertical, the object is flipped upside down. (You’re not making a flipped copy
of the select object, but actually flipping the selected object.)
As with other tools, the invisible line over which an object is flipped is based
on what reference point is currently active as the control point for that object.
In InDesign CS3, the Control panel now displays iconic buttons for Flip
Vertical and Flip Horizontal, as well as a preview of the current object’s flip
status (look for the large P in the panel when an object is selected; it’s to the
right of the two flip buttons). The P changes appearance so it is flipped the
same way as the selected object.
Repeating transformations
Whatever transformations you use, you can apply them repeatedly. InDesign
remembers the effects that you apply to frames via the Control panel,
Transform panel, and transform tools. Choose Object➪Transform Again➪
Transform Again (Option+Ô+3 or Ctrl+Alt+3) to repeat the last transforma-
tion on the selected object (it can be a different object than you last applied a
transformation to).
Or choose Object➪Transform Again➪Transform Sequence Again (Option+
Ô+4 or Ctrl+Alt+4) to apply all recent transformations to a selected object.
That sequence of transactions stays in memory until you perform a new
transformation, which then starts a new sequence, so you can apply the
same transformation to multiple objects.
Two other transform-again options are available through the Object➪
Transform Again menu option’s submenu: Transform Again Individually and
Transform Sequence Again Individually. You use these on groups; they work
like the regular Transform Again and Transform Sequence Again options but
146
Part III: Object Essentials 

apply any effects to each object individually within the group. For example,
choosing Transform Again to a group might rotate the entire group as if it
were one unit, but choosing Transform Again Individually would rotate each
object in the group separately, not the group as a unit. Try it and see exactly
what it does!
Replacing Object Attributes
A really painstaking task in any layout is going through it to fix formatting to
frames, lines, or other objects once the design standards have changed.
InDesign has a very handy way to apply object formatting consistently to
objects — the object styles feature described in Chapter 10 — but even if you
use these styles, you will still have local formatting applied to at least some
objects.
That’s where the Object pane of the Find/Replace dialog box comes in, letting
you replace attributes throughout your document, no matter what they are
applied to. Figure 9-4 shows that pane.
Here’s how it works:
1. Open the Find/Change dialog box by choosing Edit➪Find/Change, and
then go to the Object pane.
Include Locked Stories
Include Locked Layers
Include Hidden Layers
Include Master Pages
Include Footnotes
Figure 9-4:
The Object
pane of the

147
Chapter 9: Manipulating Objects

2. Select the desired object attributes by clicking the Object Find Format
Settings iconic button to the left of the Find Object Format list. In the
dialog box that displays (refer to Figure 9-5), select the attributes to
search (choose one category at a time from the list at left and then set
the desired parameters in the pane that appears), and click OK when
you’re done.
This dialog box is nearly identical to the New Object Style dialog box
covered in Chapter 10. They’ll appear in that Find Object format list.
(Highlight an attribute in the list and click the Clear Object Find Format
Settings iconic button — the trashcan icon — if you want to remove an
attribute from your search.)
3. If you’re replacing attributes, click the Object Format Settings iconic
button to the right of the Change Object Format list.
These controls work like the Find Object Format controls.
4. Limit or expand the search range by choosing an option from the
Search pop-up menu: Selection, Document, and All Documents. Also
choose the type of frames to search in the Type pop-up menu: All
Frames, Text Frames, Graphic Frames, and Unassigned Frames.
Finally, to determine the scope of your search, select or deselect any
of the six buttons at the bottom of the pane.
From left to right, the five buttons are Include Locked Layers, Include
Locked Stories, Include Hidden Layers, Include Master Pages, and
Include Footnotes. Note that the first two buttons apply only to finds;
you cannot change the formatting of locked objects. (If an icon’s back-
ground darkens, it is selected.)

5. Click Find, Change, Change All, or Change/Find as desired to perform
your search and/or replace operation.
6. Click Done when done.
Making Fancy Corners
Anytime you’re working on an object that has any sharp corners, you have
the option to add a little pizzazz to those corners via InDesign’s Corner
Options feature (Object➪Corner Options). Five built-in corner options,
shown in Figure 9-6, are available. Note that if the shape contains only
smooth points, any corner option you apply won’t be noticeable.
To add a corner option:
1. Select either of the selection tools and click the object to which you
want to add a corner effect.
2. Choose Object➪Corner Options to display the Corner Options
dialog box.
Select the Preview check box to view changes as you make them.
3. Choose an option from the Effect pop-up menu.

Chapter 9: Manipulating Objects

4. Enter a distance in the Size field.
The Size value determines the length that the effect extends from the
corner.
5. Click OK to close the dialog box and apply your changes.
If you can’t see a corner effect after applying one, make sure that a color is
applied to the stroke or try making the object’s stroke thicker. Increasing the
Size value in the Corner Options dialog box can also make a corner effect
more visible.
The Corner Options menu option and dialog box had been called Corner
Effects in previous versions of InDesign.
Using Transparency and Lighting Effects
InDesign was a pioneer in the use of transparency effects on objects. These
effects let you overlay objects without having them completely be obscured,
allowing for very interesting visual effects such as fades and shadows.
InDesign CS3 takes the next step by adding much richer controls over trans-
parency and lighting, so you can now create effects such as embossing and
beveled edges and control the intensity and direction of shadows and light.
As part of these enhancements, you’ll find a significantly revised interface for
transparency and related controls, not the least of which is the renaming of
the Transparency panel to the Effects panel.
Basic transparency
One of InDesign’s most sophisticated tools is its set of transparency options,
which let you make objects partially transparent. You apply transparency
with the Effects panel (Window➪Effects or Shift+F10), by choosing
Object➪Effects➪Transparency, or by clicking the Effects iconic button in the
Control panel and choosing Transparency from its pop-up menu.
The first option displays the Effects panel, which takes the least screen space
and is best used for simple operations. The other options open the more
complex and larger Effects dialog box. (Be sure that the Transparency pane is
visible in the Effects dialog box; if not, click the Transparency option in the
option list at left.)
Figure 9-7 shows the panel as well as a text title that uses transparency as it
overprints a background photo. Notice how the semi-transparent text fades
away toward the top and is brighter toward the bottom. Figure 9-8 shows the
dialog box.
150
Part III: Object Essentials 

In the Opacity field of the Effects panel or Effects dialog box’s Transparency
pane, enter a value or choose one from the pop-up menu. A value of 0 is com-
pletely invisible, whereas a value of 100 is completely solid.
You cannot apply transparency to text selections or to entire layers, but
InDesign CS3 now lets you apply different transparency settings to an object’s
contents, fill, and stroke, as well as to the object itself. You do so by choosing
the desired component in the list in the Effects panel or using the Settings
For pop-up menu in the Effects dialog box. (If you see only Object listed in
the Effects panel, click the right-facing triangle to its left to display the rest.)
If you want more than basic transparency, you’ll find a lot of other options.
Most are for experts, but a few are worth describing. One is the set of 16
transparency types — called blending modes. (Photoshop and Illustrator
users will recognize these expert options.) You access these in the pop-up
menu in the Effects panel or via the Mode pop-up menu on the Effects dialog
box’s Transparency pane. The differences among them can be subtle or

Chapter 9: Manipulating Objects

extreme, depending on a variety of issues. You should experiment with them
to see what effect works best in each case.
The Difference, Exclusion, Hue, Saturation, Color, and Luminosity modes do
not blend spot colors — only process colors.
You have two other options in the Effects panel and in the Transparency pane
of the Effects dialog box:
 Isolate Blending restricts the blending modes to the objects in a group,
instead of also applying them to objects beneath the group. This can
prevent unintended changes to those underlying objects.
 Knockout Group obscures any objects below the selected group. But
those objects are still affected by any blend mode settings applied to the
group, unless Isolate Blending is also checked.
Using drop shadows and inner shadows
The Effects panel and dialog box, as well as the Object➪Effects menu com-
mand, now give you access to a bunch of other lighting features, including
drop shadows. In the panel, choose Effects➪Drop Shadow from the flyout
menu, or choose Drop Shadow from the fx iconic button’s pop-up menu. In
the Effects dialog box, select Drop Shadow from the option list at left. Or just
press Option+Ô+M or Ctrl+Alt+M. No matter how you get there, you’ll see the
following options in the Drop Shadow pane, shown in Figure 9-9:
 Choose what component of the object to apply the drop shadow to by
using the Settings For pop-up menu. (You can apply multiple drop shad-
ows, one to each component of an object.)
 Select the Drop Shadow check box option to turn on the drop shadow
function for the selected component.
Figure 9-9:
The Drop
Shadow
pane of the
Effects
dialog box.
152
Part III: Object Essentials 

 Select a lighting type (technically, a blend mode) by choosing one of the
16 options in the Mode pop-up menu. (These are the same blending
modes used in transparencies.)
 Specify the opacity by entering a value in the Opacity field — 0% is invis-
ible, whereas 100% is completely solid.
 Specify the shadow’s position relative to the object by using the X Offset
and Y Offset fields. A positive X Offset moves the shadow to the right; a
positive Y Offset moves the shadow down. Negative values go in the
other direction.
 Specify the shadow’s size by entering a value in the Distance field (for-
merly named Blur in previous versions of InDesign) — this blurs a copy
of the text used in the drop shadow to make it look like it was created by
shining light on solid letters.
 Choose a lighting angle in the Angle field or use the mouse to move the
direction within the circle to determine the direction of the shadow. You
can also select the Use Global Light option, which then uses whatever
settings you define in the Global Light dialog box — a handy way to have
consistent settings for all objects. (Choose Object➪Effects➪Global
Light, or choose Global Light from the Effects panel’s flyout menu, to
open the Global Light dialog box.)
 Choose a color source — Swatches, RGB, CMYK, or Lab — from the
Color pop-up menu in the Effect Color dialog box, which you get by
clicking the color swatch to the right of the Mode pop-up menu, and
then select a color from the sliders or swatches below that menu. You
get sliders for RGB, CMYK, and Lab colors, or a set of previously defined
color swatches if you selected Swatches in the Color pop-up menu.
 Adjust the other settings, if desired, to control other, expert drop
shadow characteristics: Size, Spread, Noise, Object Knocks Out Shadow,
and Shadow Honors Other Effects.
 To see the effects of your various setting adjustments in the actual
layout, check the Preview option. (Because the Effects dialog box is so
big, you’ll likely need a big monitor to have room for both the dialog box
and the object you’re applying the effects to.)
There’s a new shadow option in InDesign CS3: inner shadows. It works pretty
much like drop shadows, with a nearly identical pane in the Effects dialog box.
The visual difference is that an inner shadow is contained within the object, as
if the frames were a wall blocking the shadow, whereas a drop shadow occurs
outside the frame, as if the frame were casting a shadow outside.
Using feathering and other lighting effects
A similar option to drop shadows is feathering, which essentially softens the
edges of objects. There are three types of feathering available:
153
Chapter 9: Manipulating Objects

 Basic feathering: These are the options that previous versions of
InDesign offered.
 Directional feathering: This adds the ability to control the direction of
the feathering as well as separate feather widths for each side, creating a
smeared-border effect.
 Gradient feathering: This adds a gradient effect to the feathered area.
The other new effects are outer glow, inner glow, bevel and emboss, and
satin. Figure 9-10 shows examples of each.
You apply them the same ways as you do drop shadows, selecting the object
component in the Settings For pop-up menu and modifying the various con-
trols such as opacity, light angle and distance, blending mode, and effect size,
as appropriate for the specific effect. Once you get a hang for transparency
and drop shadows, it’s easy to use the other effects.

Organizing Objects
In This Chapter
 Grouping and ungrouping objects
 Locking and unlocking objects
 Changing the stacking order of objects
 Creating object styles
 Managing links to graphics and text files
You use objects throughout your layout: lines, text frames, graphics
frames, shapes, and so forth. A big part of working with them involves
organizing them — deciding when to group them together, when to lock them
in location, how to arrange objects with others, and so on. That’s where this
chapter comes in.
Then I discuss a powerful new feature called object styles that lets you save
object attributes. Object styles let you organize your settings so you can
apply them to other objects for consistent, easy formatting.
Finally, I show you how to manage objects’ relations with their source files, so
you can make sure you’re using the correct version of your graphics and text.
Combining Objects into a Group
Groups have many uses. For example, you might create a group to
 Combine several objects that make up an illustration so that you can
move, modify, copy, or scale all objects in a single operation.
 Keep a graphics frame and its accompanying caption (text) frame
together so that, if you change your mind about their placement, you
can reposition both objects at once.
 Combine several vertical lines that are used to separate the columns of a
table so that you can quickly change the stroke, color, length, and posi-
tion of all lines.

InDesign lets you combine several objects into a group. A group of objects
behaves like a single object, which means that you can cut, copy, move, or
modify all the objects in a group in a single operation.
To create a group, select all the objects (which can include other groups)
that you want to include in your group and then choose Object➪Group or
press Ô+G or Ctrl+G.
Keep in mind the following when creating groups:
 If you create a group from objects on different layers, all objects are
moved to the top layer and stacked in succession beneath the topmost
object.
 You cannot create a group if some of the selected objects are locked and
some are not locked. All selected objects must be locked or unlocked
before you can group them. (Locking and unlocking objects are covered
in the following section.)
If you want to manipulate a group, choose the Selection tool and then click
any object in the group. The group’s bounding box appears. Any transforma-
tion you perform is applied to all objects in the group.
If you want to manipulate a specific object in a group, use the Direct Selection
tool to select that object. If you want to change something that requires the
Selection tool be active, switch to it by selecting the Selection tool or simply
by double-clicking the object. (See Chapter 9 for more details on selecting
objects.)
If you remove an object from a group that had transparency applied (via cut
and paste or copy and paste), that pasted object will not retain the group’s
transparency settings.
After creating a group, you may eventually decide that you want to return the
objects to their original, ungrouped state. To do so, simply click any object in
the group with the Selection tool and then choose Object➪Ungroup or press
Shift+Ô+G or Ctrl+Shift+G. If you ungroup a group that contains a group, the
contained group is not affected. To ungroup this group, you must select it
and choose Ungroup again.
Locking Objects
If you’re certain that you want a particular object to remain exactly where it
is, you can select Object➪Lock Position or press Ô+L or Ctrl+L to prevent the
object from being moved. Generally, you want to lock repeating elements
such as headers, footers, folios, and page numbers so that they’re not acci-
dentally moved. (Such repeating elements are usually placed on a master
page; you can lock objects on master pages, too.)
156
Part III: Object Essentials 

A locked object can’t be moved whether you click and drag it with the mouse
or change the values in the X: and Y: fields in the Control panel or Transform
panel. Not only can you not move a locked object, but you can’t delete it,
either. However, you can change other attributes of a locked object, including
its stroke and fill.
To unlock a selected object, choose Object➪Unlock Position or press
Option+Ô+L or Ctrl+Alt+L.
You can also lock entire layers, as described in Chapter 5.
Working with Object Styles
I suspect that object styles are underappreciated and underused, rarely used
in real-world documents. That’s a pity, because the use of styles for object
formatting — not just text formatting — makes your work easier by automati-
cally and reliably applying time-consuming settings to multiple objects and
ensuring that your object formatting is both consistent and easily managed.
Creating object styles
You create object styles by using the Object Styles panel (Window➪Object
Styles or Ô+F7 or Ctrl+F7), shown in Figure 10-1. You can also click the New
Object Style iconic button at the bottom of the panel.

Chapter 10: Organizing Objects

The simplest way to create an object style is to select an already-formatted
object with any selection tool, then choose New Object Style from the Object
Style panel’s flyout menu. InDesign records all the settings automatically from
the selected object, so they’re in place for the new object style.
Whether you start with an existing object or create a new object style com-
pletely from scratch, you use the New Object Style menu option that opens
the New Object Style dialog box shown in Figure 10-2.
At the left side of the dialog box is a list of types of attributes that are or can
be set. The checked items are in use for this style — you can uncheck an item
so InDesign doesn’t apply its settings to objects using the style. For example,
if Fill is unchecked, the object style won’t apply any Fill settings to objects
using that style (and won’t change any fill settings that have been applied to
that object locally).
To switch from one type of attribute to another, simply click the item name for
the type of attribute that you want to adjust, such as Stroke or Transparency.
Be sure to select the Preview option to see the results of object styles on the
currently selected object. Of course, you need to make sure that the object is
visible on-screen to see those effects.
When you open the New Object Style dialog box, you see the General pane,
which lets you create a new style based on an existing object style (by using
the Based On pop-up menu), and which lets you assign a keyboard shortcut
for fast application of this style (by using the Shortcuts field).
Figure 10-2:
The New
Object Style
dialog box
and its
General
pane.
158
Part III: Object Essentials 

You can use the Based On feature to create families of object styles. For
example, you can create a style called Photo-Standard for the bulk of your
placed photographs, and then create variations such as Photo-Sidebar and
Photo-Author. The Photo-Standard style might specify a hairline black stroke
around the photo, while Photo-Sidebar might change that to a white stroke.
But if you later decide you want the stroke to be 1 point and change it in
Photo-Standard, Photo-Sidebar automatically gets the 1-point stroke while
retaining the white color.
The General pane also lets you see the current style settings. Click any of the
arrows in the Style Settings section to get more details on how they are set
for this object style.
The other panes in the New Object Styles dialog box provide the same capa-
bilities that you find elsewhere in InDesign, brought into one convenient
place so you can use them in styles. Because there are so many panes, the
New Object Style dialog box now breaks them into two sections. The panes in
the first section — Basic Attributes — are
 The Fill pane lets you set colors for fills using whatever colors are defined
in the Swatches panel. You can also set the tint and, if you select a gradi-
ent fill, the angle for that gradient. Finally, you can choose to have the fill
overprint the contents of the frame by selecting the Overprint Fill option.
 The Stroke pane is identical to the Fill pane except that options specific
to fills are grayed out, and options available to strokes are made avail-
able. The color, tint, and gradient angle options are the same as for the
Fill pane. You can also choose the type of stroke (solid line, dashed line,
or dotted line) by using the Type pop-up menu, and adjust the thickness
by filling in the Weight field. You can also choose to overprint the stroke
over underlying content, plus determine — if your stroke is a dotted or
dashed line — the color, tint, and overprint for the gap.
 The Stroke & Corner Options pane lets you set stroke position and how
corners and line ends are handled. It also lets you apply fancy corners to
frames. The Stroke Options section is where you align the strokes to the
frame edges, determine how lines join at corners, and decide what line
endings are applied. The Corner Options section is where you select
from five fancy corners, such as Bevel and Rounded, by using the Effect
pop-up menu, and where you specify the radius, or reach, of the corner
by using the Size field. (See Chapter 8 for the low-down on strokes and
Chapter 9 for the skinny on corner options.)
 The Paragraph Styles pane controls what paragraph style, if any, is
applied to text in the frame. Chances are you won’t use this setting
except for frames that contain only consistent, very simple text, such as
pull-quotes or bios. (See Chapter 13 for details.)
 The Text Frame General Options pane controls how text is handled
within a frame. This essentially replicates the controls in the General
pane of the Text Box Options dialog box (Object➪Text Frame Options or
159
Chapter 10: Organizing Objects

Ô+B or Ctrl+B), including number of columns, column width, gutter set-
tings, inset spacing (how far from the frame edge text is placed), vertical
justification (how text is aligned vertically in the frame), and whether
text wrap settings are ignored when this frame overlaps other frames.
(See Chapter 12 for details.)
 The Text Frame Baseline Options pane controls how text is handled
within a frame. This essentially replicates the controls in the Baseline
Options pane of the Text Box Options dialog box (Object➪Text Frame
Options or Ô+B or Ctrl+B), including how the text baseline is calculated
for the frame and whether the text frame gets its own baseline grid. (See
Chapter 11 for details.)
 The Story Options pane enables optical margin alignment — its controls
are the same as in the Story panel (Type➪Story), detailed in Chapter 17.
Optical margin alignment adjusts the placement of text along the left
side of a frame so the text alignment is more visually pleasing.
 The Text Wrap & Other pane lets you set text wrap, mirroring the fea-
tures of the Text Wrap panel (Window➪Text Wrap or Option+Ô+W or
Ctrl+Alt+W, explained in Chapter 17), as well as make an object nonprint-
ing (normally handled through the Attributes panel by choosing
Window➪Attributes).
 The Anchored Object Options pane lets you set the attributes for inline
and anchored frames, mirroring the controls in the Anchored Object
Options dialog box (Object➪Anchored Object➪Options), which I explain
in Chapter 11.
The second set of panes all relate to the features found in the Effects dialog
box and panel, as covered in Chapter 9: Transparency, Drop Shadow, Inner
Shadow, Outer Glow, Inner Glow, Bevel and Emboss, Satin, Basic Feather,
Directional Feather, and Gradient Feather.
Managing object styles
The Object Styles panel’s flyout menu (refer to Figure 10-1) has several
options for managing object styles:
 Duplicate Style: Click an object style’s name and then choose this menu
option to create an exact copy. If you want to create an object style
that’s similar to one you already created, you might want to choose New
Object Style rather than Duplicate Style, and then use the Based On
option to create a child of the original. If you choose Duplicate Style, the
copy is identical to, but not based on, the original; if you modify the orig-
inal, the copy is not affected.
 Delete Style: Choose this to delete selected object styles. To select mul-
tiple styles, press and hold Ô or Ctrl as you click their names. To select
a range of styles, click the first one, and then press and hold Shift and
160
Part III: Object Essentials 

click the last one. You can also delete styles by selecting them in the
pane and then clicking the Delete Selected Styles iconic button (the
trashcan icon) at the bottom of the panel.
 Redefine Style: To modify an existing object style, first make changes to
an object that already has an object style defined for it, and then select
Redefine Style. The newly applied formats are applied to the object style.
 Style Options: This option lets you modify an existing object style.
When a style is highlighted in the Object Styles panel, choosing Style
Options displays the Object Style Options dialog box, which is identical
to the New Object Style dialog box covered earlier.
 Load Object Styles: Choose this option if you want to import object
styles from another InDesign document. After selecting the document
from which to import the styles, you will get a dialog box listing the
styles in the chosen document, so you can decide which ones to import.
Note the Incoming Style Definitions window at the bottom of the dialog
box; it lists the style definitions to help you decide which to import, as
well as which to overwrite or rename.
 Select All Unused: Select this option to highlight the names of all object
styles that have not been applied to any objects in the current docu-
ment. This is a handy way of identifying unused styles in preparation for
deleting them (by choosing the Delete Style menu option).
 Sort by Name: This option alphabetizes your object styles for easier
access. (InDesign adds styles to the Object Styles panel in the order in
which they were created.)
 Small Panel Rows: Select this option to reduce the text size in the
Object Styles panel. Although harder to read, a panel with this option
selected lets you access more styles without having to scroll. To return
the panel to its normal text size, deselect this option.
InDesign comes with three predefined object styles — [Normal Text Frame],
[Normal Graphics Frame], and [Normal Grid] — that you can modify as
desired.
Applying object styles
After you create an object style, applying it is easy. Just click an object and
then click the object style name in the Object Styles panel or press its key-
board shortcut. (Windows users must make sure Num Lock is on when using
shortcuts for styles.)
You can set which object styles are automatically used for new text and
graphics frames: In the Object Styles panel’s flyout menu, choose Default Text
Frame Style and select the desired style from the submenu to set a default
text frame; choose Default Graphic Frame Style and select the desired style
161
Chapter 10: Organizing Objects

from the submenu to set a default graphics frame. To no longer have object
styles automatically applied to new objects, choose [None] in the Default
Text Frame and/or Default Graphic Frame submenus.
How existing formatting is handled
When you apply an object style to selected objects, all local formats are
retained. All other formats are replaced by those of the applied style — that
is, unless you do one of the following:
 If you press and hold Option or Alt when clicking a name in the Object
Styles panel, any local formatting that has been applied to the objects is
removed. You can achieve the same effect by choosing Clear Attributes
Not Defined by Style from the Object Styles panel’s flyout menu or by
clicking the Clear Attributes Not Defined by Style iconic button at the
bottom of the Object Styles panel.
 If you want to override any local changes with the settings in the object
style, choose Clear Overrides in the flyout menu or click the Clear
Overrides iconic button at the bottom of the Object Styles panel. The
difference is that Clear Attributes Not Defined by Style removes all
attributes for which the object style contains no settings, whereas Clear
Overrides imposes the object style’s settings over conflicting attributes
that you set manually.
 To have InDesign CS3 automatically override local changes when apply-
ing a style, be sure the new Clear Overrides When Applying Style flyout
menu option is checked. Choosing the item toggles between selecting
(checking) and deselecting (unchecking) this option.
If a plus sign (+) appears to the right of an object style’s name, it means that
the object has local formats that differ from those of the applied object style.
This can occur if you apply an object style to object text to which you’ve
done some manual formatting, or if you modify formatting for an object after
applying an object style to it. (For example, you may have changed the fill
color; that is a local change to the object style and causes the + to appear.)
Removing an object style from an object
To remove a style from an object, choose Break Link to Style from the Object
Styles panel’s flyout menu. The object’s current formatting won’t be affected,
but it will no longer be updated when the object style is changed.
Managing object styles
InDesign also lets you manage your styles, such as creating groups of styles
to make it easier to find relevant ones, and bring in styles from other docu-
ments. Because these features work the same for paragraph, character, table,
and cell styles as well, I’ve covered these features in one place: Chapter 14.
162
Part III: Object Essentials 

Managing Links
The Links panel (Window➪Links, or Shift+Ô+D or Ctrl+Shift+D) is a handy
place to manage the links to your graphics and text, particularly when you
need to update them. (Figure 10-3 shows the Links panel.)
InDesign always creates links for graphics files. But it will create links to
source text files (including spreadsheets) only if the Create Links When
Placing Text and Spreadsheet Files option is checked in the Type pane of the
Preferences dialog box (InDesign➪Preferences➪Type or Ô+K on the Mac, or
Edit➪Preferences-Type or Ctrl+K in Windows). This option is not checked by
default because many designers don’t want to have text files be easily
updated in their layouts. That’s because all the formatting they have done to
the file in InDesign is removed when the link to the source file is updated,
causing the text to be replaced.
The first five commands in the Links panel’s flyout menu let you reestablish
links to missing and modified files, display an imported graphic or text file in
the document window, open the program used to create a graphic or text file,
and work on copies and versions of the source graphics and text:

Update Link
Relink

Figure 10-3:

panel and
its flyout

163
Chapter 10: Organizing Objects

 Relink: This command, and the Relink iconic button (the leftmost at the
bottom of the panel), lets you reestablish a missing link or replace the
original file you imported with a different file. When you choose Relink or
click the button, the Relink dialog box is displayed and shows the original
pathname and filename. You can enter a new pathname and filename in
the Location field, but it’s easier to click Browse, which opens a standard
Open a File dialog box. Use the controls to locate and select the original
file or a different file, and then click OK. (You can also drag and drop a file
icon from the Mac OS Finder or Windows Explorer directly into the Relink
dialog box.) If you want to restore broken links to multiple files simultane-
ously, highlight their filenames in the scroll list, and then choose Relink or
click the Update Link button.
InDesign CS3 now lets you relink all instances of a file in your layout, so
you only have to do the operation once. Here’s the trick: In the Relink
dialog box, be sure to check the new Relink All Instances option.
 Go to Link: Choose this option, or click the Go to Link iconic button
(second from left) in the panel to display the highlighted file in the docu-
ment window. InDesign will, if necessary, navigate to the correct page
and center the frame in the document window. You can also display a
particular graphic or text file by double-clicking its name in the scroll list
while holding down the Option or Alt key.
 Edit Original: If you want to modify an imported graphic or text file,
choose Edit Original from the flyout menu or click the Edit Original
button (far right) at the bottom of the panel. InDesign will try to locate
and open the program used to create the file. This may or may not be
possible, depending on the original program, the file format, and the pro-
grams available on your computer.
 Update Link: Choose this option or click the Update Link iconic button
(third from the left) at the bottom of the panel to update the link to a mod-
ified graphic or text file. Highlight multiple filenames, and then choose
Update Link or click the Update Link button to update all links at once.
When you update missing and modified graphics, any transformations —
rotation, shear, scale, and so on — that you’ve applied to the graphics or
their frames are maintained, unless you’ve deselected the new Relink
Preserves Dimensions option in the File Handling pane of the Preferences
dialog box (InDesign➪Preferences➪File Handling or Ô+K on the Mac, or
Edit➪Preferences➪File Handling or Ctrl+K in Windows).
 Copy Link To: Choose this option to copy the source graphic or text file
to a new location and update the link so that it refers to this new copy.
164
Part III: Object Essentials 

Other useful flyout menu options include
 Reveal in Finder (Macintosh) and Reveal in Explorer (Windows): This
menu option opens a window displaying the contents of the folder that
contains the source file, so you can perhaps move, copy, or rename it.
(The Reveal in Bridge option is a similar feature for the expert Adobe
Bridge companion program not covered in this book.)
 Embed File (for graphics only): This option lets you embed the complete
file of any imported graphics file. (InDesign normally imports only a low-
resolution screen preview when you place a graphic that is 48K or larger.)
If you want to ensure that the graphics file will forever remain with a docu-
ment, you can choose to embed it — however, by embedding graphics,
you’ll be producing larger document files, which means it will take you
longer to open and save them. If you do use this option, an alert is dis-
played and informs you about the increased document size that will
result. Click Yes to embed the file. Note that this menu option changes to
Unembed File, so you can re-enable the original link at any time.
 Unlink (for text files only): This option removes the link to the source
text file, so it can’t be updated. Note that this option cannot be undone
from the Links panel; you have choose Edit➪Undo, or press Ô+Z or
Ctrl+Z.
 Link Information: This option displays the Link Information dialog box,
which actually doesn’t let you do much. (The Previous and Next buttons
let you display information about the previous and next files in the list,
but that’s about it.) But it does display 11 sometimes-useful bits of infor-
mation about the highlighted file, including its name, status, creation
date, file type, and location.
 Sort by Name: This option lists all files in alphabetical order.
 Sort by Page: This option lists imported files on page 1 first, followed by
imported files on page 2, and so on.
 Sort by Type: This option lists all files grouped by type of file (such as
Word, JPEG, and TIFF).
 Sort by Status: This option lists files with missing links first, followed by
files that have been modified, and finally files whose status is okay.
 Small Panel Rows: This option lets you reduce the size of text in the
panel and decrease the space between entries so that you can see more
entries at once. Of course, the reduced rows are also harder to read. To
go back to the normal display size, simply select this option again.
The other options in the flyout menu — Save Link Version, Versions, Purchase
This Image, Check Out, Cancel Check Out, Check In, and Link File Info — are
expert features not covered in this book.

hen you draw objects like frames or lines, they appear where you
draw them. That’s what you expect, right? But sometimes you want
them to appear where you meant to draw them, not where you actually did.
Working with the mouse is inexact, but you can overcome that.
This chapter shows you how to use a variety of InDesign features to precisely
control the placement of objects, including the ability to enter actual coordi-
nates for objects, to use grids and guidelines features to ensure that your
objects and text line up where you want them to, and to use the Align panel
and related commands to make sure objects line up relative to each other, so
your layouts are all neat and tidy.
The other part of keeping your layouts neat and tidy is managing the arrange-
ments of objects. In addition to the grouping and locking functions covered in
Chapter 10, InDesign also lets you control the stacking order of objects that
overlap and tie objects to spots in text so they stay close to the text that ref-
erences them.
Precise Positioning with Coordinates
The most precise way to position objects is by entering the object’s desired
coordinates in the X: and Y: fields of the Control panel or the Transform
panel. (You can also precisely change the object’s size by entering values in
the W: and H: fields.) The Control panel is visible by default at the top of the
document window. If it’s not visible, open the Control panel by choosing
Window➪Control or by pressing Option+Ô+6 or Ctrl+Alt+6.

The Control panel is more powerful than the Transform panel, which is a
holdover from older versions of InDesign, but if you want to use the Transform
panel, choose Window➪Object & Layout➪Transform. Figure 11-1 shows both
the Control panel and Transform panel, their flyout menus, and a selected
frame.
Everyone should use the Control panel’s coordinates to make sure that
objects are consistently placed from page to page. Many designers place
objects by eye, using the mouse, but that typically means there are small
position and size variations from page to page that shouldn’t be there. Many
readers won’t notice if the differences are slight, but even small differences
make small adjustments to text flow that can add up over pages. And it’s all
so unnecessary.
You usually want to enter coordinates based on the upper-left corner, so be
sure that the upper-left reference point is made into the control point (just
click it if it is not). How do you know which reference point is the current
control point? The control point is black, while the other reference points are
white. (Chapter 1 provides the deeper details.)
Lining Up Objects with
Guidelines and Grids
If you’ve ever seen a carpenter use a chalked string to snap a temporary line
as an aid for aligning objects, you understand the concept behind ruler guide-
lines and grids. They’re not structurally necessary and they don’t appear in
the final product, yet they still make your work easier.
Figure 11-1:

168
Part III: Object Essentials 

InDesign provides several types of grids and guidelines:
 Ruler guides are moveable guidelines that are helpful for placing objects
precisely and for aligning multiple items.
 Margin and column guides are part of your page setup when you create
or modify a document (see Chapter 3), providing the default margin
around the sides of the page and the space between the default text
frame’s columns.
 A baseline grid is a series of horizontal lines that help in aligning lines of
text and objects across a multicolumn page. When a document is open
and it has a baseline grid showing, the page looks like a sheet of lined
paper.
 A document grid is a set of horizontal and vertical lines that help you
place and align objects.
 A frame-based grid is similar to a baseline grid except that it is just for a
specific text frame.
You won’t need all the grids and guidelines at once. You’ll most likely use a
combination of guides and grids, but using all four at once is more compli-
cated than necessary.
Using ruler guides
InDesign lets you create individual ruler guides manually. You can also set ruler
guides automatically with the Create Guides command (Layout➪Create Guides).
Manually creating ruler guides
To create ruler guides on an as-needed basis, follow these steps:
1. Go to the page or spread onto which you want to place ruler guides.
2. If the rulers are not displayed at the top and left of the document
window, choose View➪Show Rulers or press Ô+R or Ctrl+R.
3. Drag the pointer (and a guideline along with it) from the horizontal
ruler or vertical ruler onto a page or the pasteboard.
4. When the guideline is positioned where you want it, release the
mouse button.
If you release the mouse when the pointer is over a page, the ruler guide
extends from one edge of the page to the other (but not across a
spread). If you release the mouse button when the pointer is over the
pasteboard, the ruler guide extends across both pages of a spread and
the pasteboard. If you want a guide to extend across a spread and the
pasteboard, you can also hold down the Ô or Ctrl key as you drag and
release the mouse when the pointer is over a page.
169
Chapter 11: Aligning and Arranging Objects

Place both a horizontal and vertical guide at the same time by pressing Ô or
Ctrl and dragging the ruler intersection point (where the two rulers meet) onto
a page. You can also place a guide that extends across the page or spread and
pasteboard by double-clicking the vertical or horizontal ruler.
Ruler guides are cyan in color (unless you change the color by choosing
Layout➪Ruler Guides) and are associated with the layer onto which they’re
placed. You can show and hide ruler guides by showing and hiding the layers
that contain them. You can even create layers that contain nothing but ruler
guides and then show and hide them as you wish. (See Chapter 5 for more
information about layers.)
To create ruler guides for several document pages, create a master page, add
the ruler guides to the master page, and then apply the master to the appro-
priate document pages.
Automatically creating ruler guides
Here’s how to create a set of ruler guides automatically:
1. If the documents contain multiple layers, display the Layers panel
(Window➪Layers or F7) and click the name of the layer to which you
want to add guides.
2. Choose Layout➪Create Guides to display the Create Guides dialog
box, shown in Figure 11-2. (To see the guides on the page while you
create them, check Preview.)
Figure 11-2:
The Create
Guides
dialog box
and the
guides it
created.
170
Part III: Object Essentials 

3. In the Rows and Columns areas, specify the number of guides you
want to add in the Number fields and, optionally, specify a Gutter
width between horizontal (Rows) and vertical (Columns) guides. Enter
0 (zero) in the Gutter fields if you don’t want gutters between guides.
4. In the Options area, click Margins to fit the guides in the margin
boundaries; click Page to fit the guides within the page boundary.
5. Remove any previously placed ruler guides by checking Remove
Existing Ruler Guides.
6. When you finish specifying the attributes of the ruler guides, click OK
to close the dialog box.
Working with ruler guides
You can show and hide, lock and unlock, select and move, copy and paste,
and delete ruler guides. Here are a few pointers for working with ruler guides:
 Display or hide ruler guides by choosing View➪Grids & Guides➪Show/
Hide Guides or by pressing Ô+; (semicolon) or Ctrl+; (semicolon).
 Lock or unlock all ruler guides by choosing View➪Grids & Guides➪Lock
Guides or by pressing Option+Ô+; (semicolon) or Ctrl+Alt+; (semicolon).
Ruler guides are locked when Lock Guides is checked.
 Select a ruler guide by clicking it with a selection tool. To select multi-
ple guides, hold down the Shift key and click them. The color of a guide
changes from cyan to the color of its layer when it is selected. To select
all ruler guides on a page or spread, press Option+Ô+G or Ctrl+Alt+G.
 Move a guide by clicking and dragging it as you would any object. To
move multiple guides, select them and then drag them. To move guides
to another page, select them, choose Edit➪Cut or press Ô+X or Ctrl+X
(or choose Edit➪Copy or press Ô+C or Ctrl+C), display the target page,
and then choose Edit➪Paste or press Ô+V or Ctrl+V. If the target page
has the same dimensions as the source page, the guides are placed in
their original positions.
 Delete ruler guides by selecting them and then pressing Delete or
Backspace.
 Change the color of the ruler guides and the view percentage above
which they’re displayed by choosing Layout➪Ruler Guides. The Ruler
Guides dialog box, shown in Figure 11-3, appears. Modify the View
Threshold value, choose a different color from the Color pop-up menu,
and then click OK. If you change the settings in the Ruler Guides dialog
box when no documents are open, the new settings become defaults and
are applied to all subsequently created documents.
 Display ruler guides behind — instead of in front of — objects by
choosing InDesign➪Preferences➪Guides & Pasteboard or pressing Ô+K
on the Mac, or by choosing Edit➪Preferences➪Guides & Pasteboard or
171
Chapter 11: Aligning and Arranging Objects

by pressing Ctrl+K in Windows. Then select the Guides in Back option in
the Guide Options section of the dialog box.
 Make object edges snap (align) to ruler guides when you drag them
into the snap zone by selecting the Snap to Guides option (View➪Grids
& Guides➪Snap to Guides, or press Shift+Ô+; [semicolon] or Ctrl+Shift+;
[semicolon]). To specify the snap zone (the distance — in pixels — at
which an object will snap to a guide), choose InDesign➪Preferences➪
Guides & Pasteboard or press Ô+K on the Mac, or choose Edit➪
Preferences➪Guides & Pasteboard or press Ctrl+K in Windows, and
enter a value in the Snap to Zone field in the Guide Options section of
the dialog box.
Working with column guides
You can also adjust column guides if your document has them, though you
don’t get the same flexibility in adjusting column guides as you do ruler
guides. Column guides are created when you create a new document and set
it up as having multiple columns (see Chapter 3).
By default, column guides are locked. To unlock them (or relock them)
choose View➪Grids & Guides➪Lock Column Guides. (If the menu option has
a check mark to its left, the column guides are locked.)
To move a column guide, click and drag it. Note that the color of a selected
column guide does not change as the color of a selected ruler guide does.
Also note that you cannot select multiple column guides or move them to
other pages. The only way to add or delete column guides is to change the
number of guides in the Margins and Columns dialog box (choose
Layout➪Margins and Columns); adjusting the number of columns undoes any
custom moves applied to column guides.
Using document grids
A document grid is like the grid paper you used in school, a visual crutch to
help ensure that the objects you draw and reposition are placed at desired
increments. Using a grid can help ensure that objects align and are sized
consistently.
Figure 11-3:
The Ruler
Guides
dialog box.

Part III: Object Essentials 

If you plan to use a grid, set it up before you start working in the document.
Because documents tend to have different grid settings based on individual
contents, you probably want to set Grids preferences with a specific document
open so that the grid will apply only to that document. The Grids pane of the
Preferences dialog box (InDesign➪Preferences➪Grids or Ô+K on the Mac, or
Edit➪Preferences➪Grids or Ctrl+K in Windows) is shown in Figure 11-4.
You have the following options:
 Color: The default color of the document grid is Light Gray. You can
choose a different color from the Color pop-up menu or choose Other to
create your own.
 Gridline Every: The major gridlines, which are slightly darker, are posi-
tioned according to this value. The default value is 6p0; in general, you
want to specify a value within the measurement system you’re using. For
example, if you work in inches, you might enter 1 inch in the Gridline
Every field. You set the horizontal and vertical settings separately.
 Subdivisions: The major gridlines established in the Gridline Every field
are subdivided according to the value you enter here. For example, if
you enter 1 inch in the Gridline Every field and 4 in the Subdivisions
field, you get a gridline at each quarter-inch. The default number of sub-
divisions is 8. You set the horizontal and vertical settings separately.
By default, the document grid appears on every spread behind all objects. You
can have grids display in front by deselecting the Grids in Back check box.
Figure 11-4:
The Grids
pane of the
Preferences
dialog box.

Chapter 11: Aligning and Arranging Objects

To make object edges snap (align) to the grid when you drag them into the
snap zone, select the Snap to Document Grid option (View➪Grids & Guides➪
Snap to Document Grid, or press Shift+Ô+' [apostrophe] or Ctrl+Shift+' [apos-
trophe]). To specify the snap zone (the distance — in pixels — at which an
object will snap to a gridline), InDesign will use whatever settings you specified
for guidelines, as explained earlier in this chapter.
To display the document grid, choose View➪Grids & Guides➪Show
Document Grid or press Ô+' (apostrophe) or Ctrl+' (apostrophe).
Using baseline grids
You may not already know this, but each and every new document you
create includes a baseline grid. A baseline grid can be helpful for aligning
text baselines across columns and for ensuring that object edges align
with text baselines.
But chances are that the default settings for the baseline grid won’t match
the baselines (leading) for the majority of your text. The default baseline grid
begins 1⁄2 inch from the top of a document page; the default gridlines are light
blue, are spaced 1 pica apart, and appear at view percentages above 75 per-
cent. If you change any of these settings when no documents are open, the
changes are applied to all subsequently created documents; if a document is
open, changes apply only to that document.
So here’s how to modify the baseline grid:
1. Choose InDesign➪Preferences➪Grids or press Ô+K on the Mac, or
choose Edit➪Preferences➪Grids or press Ctrl+K in Windows.
The Grids pane, shown in Figure 11-4, appears. (If you used the short-
cuts, then select the Grids pane from the list at left.)
2. Pick a color for the baseline from the Color pop-up menu in the
Baseline Grid area.
3. In the Start field, enter the distance between the top of the page and
the first gridline.
If you enter 0, the Increment Every value determines the distance
between the top of the page and the first gridline.
4. In the Increment Every field, enter the distance between gridlines.
If you’re not sure what value to use, enter the leading value for the publi-
cation’s body text.
174
Part III: Object Essentials 

5. Choose a View Threshold percentage from the pop-up menu or enter a
value in the field.
You probably don’t want to display the baseline grid at reduced view
percentages because gridlines become tightly spaced.
6. Click OK to close the dialog box and return to the document.
The Show/Hide Baseline Grid command (View➪Grids & Guides➪Show/Hide
Baseline Grid, or Option+Ô+' [apostrophe] or Ctrl+Alt+' [apostrophe]) lets
you display and hide a document’s baseline grid.
When you set a baseline grid, it applies to the entire document. Gridlines are
displayed behind all objects, layers, and ruler guides. To get text to line up to
the baseline grid, you need to ensure that the Align to Grid pop-up menu is
set to either First Line Only or All Lines in your paragraph style or that the
Align to Baseline Grid check box is selected in the Paragraph panel or Control
panel. Chapter 13 covers such paragraph formatting in detail.
A document-wide baseline grid is all fine and dandy, but often it’s not enough.
The document-wide baseline grid is basically useful for your body text and
often your headline text, assuming that the baseline grid’s increments match
the leading for that text. But what if you have other elements, like sidebars,
that have different leading?
The answer is to use text frame–specific baseline grids. You set the grid as part
of text frame options by choosing Object➪Text Frame Options or by pressing
Ô+B or Ctrl+B and then going to the Baseline Options pane. Its options are
almost identical to those in the Grids pane of the Preferences dialog box. A
baseline grid established for a text frame affects only the text in that frame.
Aligning Objects to Each Other
InDesign lets you align and distribute objects, saving you the hassle of manu-
ally moving and placing each element, or figuring out the correct locations in
the Control panel or Transform panel to do so. The Align panel is where
InDesign offers these timesaving abilities.
The Align panel (Window➪Object & Layout➪Align or Shift+F7), shown in
Figure 11-5, has several iconic buttons that let you manipulate the relative
position of multiple objects in two ways. (The buttons show the alignments
they provide.) You can
 Line up objects along a horizontal or vertical axis. For example, if
you’ve randomly placed several small graphic frames onto a page, you
can use the alignment buttons in the Align panel to align them neatly —
either horizontally or vertically.
175
Chapter 11: Aligning and Arranging Objects

 Distribute space evenly among objects along a horizontal or vertical
axis. Here’s a typical problem that’s easily solved by using this feature:
You’ve carefully placed five small pictures on a page so that the top edges
are aligned across the page and there is equal space between each pic-
ture. Then you find out one of the pictures needs to be cut. After deleting
the unneeded picture, you could use the Align panel to redistribute the
space among the remaining pictures so that they’re again equally spaced.
The Align buttons don’t work with objects that have been locked with the
Lock Position command (Object➪Lock Position, or Ô+L or Ctrl+L). If you
need to align a locked object, you must first unlock it (Object➪Unlock
Position, or Option+Ô+L or Ctrl+Alt+L). If the objects are on a locked layer,
you need to unlock the layer.
When you click an iconic button in the Align panel, selected objects are repo-
sitioned in the most logical manner. For example, if you click the Horizontal
Align Left button, the selected objects are moved horizontally (to the left, in
this case) so that the left edge of each object is aligned with the left edge of
the leftmost object. Along the same lines, if you click the Vertical Distribute
Center button, the selected objects are moved vertically so that there’s an
equal amount of space between the vertical center of each object.
Spacing can appear uneven if you click the Horizontal or Vertical Distribute
buttons when objects of various sizes are selected. For objects of different
sizes, you’ll usually want to use the Distribute Spacing buttons (which make
the space between objects even) rather than space objects based on their
centers or sides (which is how the Distribute Object buttons work).
If the two Distribute Spacing icons do not appear at the bottom of the panel
and you want to distribute objects, choose Show Options from the flyout
menu.

Part III: Object Essentials 

Stacking Objects
As I mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, arranging your objects is as
key to having neat and tidy layouts as using grids and so forth to align objects.
Each time you begin work on a new page, you start with a clean slate (unless
the page is based on a master page, in which case the master objects act as the
page’s background; see Chapter 6 for more on master pages). Every time you
add an object to a page — either by using any of InDesign’s object-creation
tools or with the Place command (File➪Place or Ô+D or Ctrl+D) — the new
object occupies a unique place in the page’s object hierarchy, or stacking order.
The first object you place on a page is automatically positioned at the bottom
of the stacking order; the next object is positioned one level higher than the
first object (that is, in front of the backmost object); the next object is stacked
one level higher; and so on for every object you add to the page. (It’s not
uncommon for a page to have several dozen or even several hundred stacks.)
Although each object occupies its own stack level, if the objects on a page
don’t overlap, the stacking order is not an issue. But some of the most inter-
esting graphic effects you can achieve with InDesign involve arranging sev-
eral overlapping objects, so it’s important to be aware of the
three-dimensional nature of a page’s stacking order.
You may change your mind about what you want to achieve in your layout
after you’ve already placed objects in it. To change an object’s position in a
page’s stacking order, use the Arrange command (Object➪Arrange), which
offers four choices:
 Bring to Front (Shift+Ô+] or Ctrl+Shift+])
 Bring Forward (Ô+] or Ctrl+])
 Send Backward (Ô+[ or Ctrl+[)
 Send to Back (Shift+Ô+[ or Ctrl+Shift+[)
To select an object that’s hidden behind one or more other objects, press and
hold Ô or Ctrl and then click anywhere within the area of the hidden object.
The first click selects the topmost object; each successive click selects the
next lowest object in the stacking order. When the bottom object is selected,
the next click selects the top object. If you don’t know where a hidden object
is, you can simply click the object or objects in front of it, then send the
object(s) to the back. (See Chapter 9 for more on selecting stacked objects.)
177
Chapter 11: Aligning and Arranging Objects

Creating Inline and Anchored Frames
In most cases, you want the frames you place on your pages to remain pre-
cisely where you put them. But sometimes, you want to place frames relative
to related text in such a way that the frames move when the text is edited.
The simplest way is to use inline graphics. For example, if you’re creating a
product catalog that’s essentially a continuous list of product descriptions
and you want to include a graphic with each description, you can paste
graphics within the text to create inline graphics frames.
A close cousin to the inline frame is the anchored frame, in which a frame fol-
lows a point in the text, but that frame is not actually in the text. For example,
you might have a “For More Information” sidebar that you want to appear to
the left of the text that first mentions a term. By using an anchored frame,
you can have that sidebar move with the text so it always appears to its left,
perhaps in an adjacent column or in the page margins.
Figure 11-6 shows examples of both an inline frame and an anchored frame.
Note that the process of creating inline and anchored frames — especially
anchored frames — can appear overwhelming. It does require thinking
through the frame’s placement and visualizing that placement so you pick the
right options in the various dialog boxes. But relax: You can experiment until
you get the hang of it. That’s why InDesign lets you undo your work.

178
Part III: Object Essentials 

Working with inline frames
An inline frame is treated like a single character. If you insert or delete text
that precedes an inline frame, the frame moves forward or backward along
with the rest of the text that follows the inserted or deleted text. Although
inline frames usually contain graphics, they can just as easily contain text or
nothing at all.
Inline frames may interfere with line spacing in paragraphs that have auto-
matic leading. If the inline frame is larger than the point size in use, the
automatic leading value for that line is calculated from the inline frame. This
leads to inconsistent line spacing in the paragraph. To work around this, you
can apply a fixed amount of leading to all characters in the paragraph, adjust
the size of inline frames, place inline frames at the beginning of a paragraph,
or place inline frames in their own paragraphs.
There are three ways to create inline frames: pasting the frame into text, plac-
ing the frame into text, and using the new Anchored Object menu option. The
first two are the simplest, but the third gives you more control over the inline
frame when you create it. The third way also lets you create anchored
frames, which are covered later in this chapter.
Using the Paste command
If you want to create an inline frame from an object you already created, all
you have to do is copy or cut the object and then paste it into text as you
would a piece of highlighted text. Here’s how:
1. Use the Selection tool to select the object you want to paste within text.
Any type of object can be used: a line, an empty shape, a text or picture
frame, even a group of objects.
2. Choose Edit➪Copy or press Ô+C or Ctrl+C.
If you don’t need the original item, you can use the Cut command (Edit➪
Cut or Ô+X or Ctrl+X) instead of the Copy command.
3. Select the Type tool and then click within the text where you want to
place the copied object.
Make sure the cursor is flashing where you intend to place the inline
frame.
4. Choose Edit➪Paste or press Ô+V or Ctrl+V.
Inline frames often work best when placed at the beginning of a paragraph. If
you place an inline frame within text to which automatic leading has been
applied, the resulting line spacing can be inconsistent. To fix this problem,
you can resize the inline frame.
179
Chapter 11: Aligning and Arranging Objects

Using the Place command
You can also use the Place command to create an inline graphics frame from
an external picture file. (You can’t use this technique for inline text frames.)
Here’s how:
1. Select the Type tool and then click within a text frame to establish the
insertion point.
2. Choose File➪Place or press Ô+D or Ctrl+D.
3. Locate and select the graphics file you want to place within the text;
choose Open.
To delete an inline frame, you can select it and then choose Edit➪Clear or
Edit➪Cut, or you can position the text cursor next to it and press Delete or
Backspace.
Adjusting inline frames
After you create an inline frame, you can adjust its position vertically or hori-
zontally. Again, there are several methods.
Two quick-and-dirty methods to move an inline frame vertically are as follows:
 Use the Type tool to highlight the inline frame as you would highlight an
individual text character. In the Character panel or Control panel, type a
positive value in the Baseline Shift field to move the inline frame up;
type a negative value to move the frame down.
 Use the Selection tool or Direct Selection tool to select the inline frame;
drag the frame up or down.
A quick way to move an inline frame horizontally is to follow these steps:
1. With the Type tool selected, click between the inline frame and the
character that precedes it.
2. Use the kerning controls in the Character panel or Control panel to
enlarge or reduce the space between the inline frame and the preced-
ing character.
You can more precisely control the position of inline frames by using the
Anchored Object Options dialog box, covered in the next section.
Of course, you can also adjust its other attributes as needed, such as strokes,
fills, dimensions, rotation, and skew, by using the Tools panel, Control panel,
and other panels.
180
Part III: Object Essentials 

Working with anchored frames
Anchored frames give you a whole new way of organizing objects. Essentially,
they follow the relevant text within the parameters you specify, such as staying
to the left of the text or staying at the top of the page that contains the text.
Note that an inline frame is a type of anchored frame, one where the frame
stays within the text it is linked to. For simplicity, I’m using the term anchored
frame to mean only those frames that are outside the text frame but remain
linked to a specific point in the text.
In addition to preserving anchored framed in imported Microsoft Word files,
InDesign lets you create anchors in your layout. To create anchored frames,
do the following:
1. Select the Type tool and then click within a text frame to establish the
insertion point.
2. Choose Object➪Anchored Object➪Insert.
The Insert Anchored Object dialog box appears.
3. In the Object Options section of the dialog box, specify the anchored
frame’s settings.
You can choose the type of content (text, graphics, or unassigned) with
the Content pop-up menu, apply an object style by using the Object
Style pop-up menu, apply a paragraph style via the Paragraph Style pop-
up menu (if Content is set to Text), and set the anchored frame’s dimen-
sions in the Height and Width fields. Note that the paragraph style you
choose, if any, applies to the anchored frame, not to the paragraph in
which the anchored frame is linked.
4. In the Position pop-up menu, choose what kind of frame you are creat-
ing: Inline or Above Line (both are inline frames) or Custom (an
anchored frame).
The dialog box will show different options based on that choice, as
Figure 11-7 shows.
Anchored frames that you add by choosing Object➪Anchored Object➪
Insert do not have text automatically wrapped around them. Use the Text
Wrap panel (Window➪Text Wrap or Option+Ô+W or Ctrl+Alt+W) to open
this panel and set text wrap. But anchored frames created by pasting a
graphic into text do automatically have text wrap around them.
Selecting the Prevent Manual Positioning option ensures that the posi-
tions of individual anchored frames can’t be adjusted by using InDesign’s
other text and frame controls (such as Baseline Shift). This forces users
to use this dialog box to change the anchored frame’s position, reducing
the chances of accidental change.
181
Chapter 11: Aligning and Arranging Objects

5. Decide whether to select the Relative to Spine option.
If this option is not selected, the anchored frame is placed on the same
side of the text frame on all pages, whether those pages are left-facing or
right-facing. If the Relative to Spine option is selected, InDesign places
the text frame on the outside of both pages or inside of both pages,
depending on how the anchored position is set.
6. In the Anchored Object section of the dialog box, click one of the posi-
tioning squares to set up the text frame’s relative position.
Note that you need to think about both the horizontal and vertical posi-
tion you desire. For example, if you want the anchored frame to appear
to the right of the text reference, click one of the right-hand squares.
(Remember that selecting the Relative to Spine option overrides this,
making the right-hand pages’ positions mirror that of the left-hand
pages, rather than be identical to them.) If you choose the topmost
right-hand square, the anchored frame is placed to the right of the text
reference and vertically appears at or below that text reference. But if
you choose the bottommost right-hand square, you’re telling InDesign
you want the anchored frame to appear vertically above the text refer-
ence. Experiment with your layout to see what works best in each case.

dialog box

182
Part III: Object Essentials 

7. In the Anchored Position section of the dialog box, click one of the
positioning squares to set up the text reference’s relative position.
Although there are nine squares shown, the only three that matter are
those in the middle row. Typically, you place the text reference on the
opposite side of the anchored frame — if you want the anchored frame
to be to the left, you would indicate that the text reference is to the
right. (If you set the text reference on the same side as the anchored
frame, InDesign places the anchored frame over the text.) The reason
there are three squares (left, middle, and right) is to accommodate lay-
outs in which you want some anchored frames to appear to the left of
the text and some to the right; in that case, choose the middle position
here and select the right- or left-hand position in the Anchored Object
section as appropriate to that object.
8. There are three options in the Anchored Position section that give
InDesign more precise instructions on how to place the anchored
frames:
• The X Relative To pop-up menu tells InDesign from where the hor-
izontal location is calculated, using the following options: Anchor
Marker, Column Edge, Text Frame, Page Margin, and Page Edge.
The right option depends both on where you want the anchored
frames placed and whether you have multicolumn text boxes (in
which case Text Frame and Column Edge result in different place-
ment, while in a single-column text frame they do not). You can
also specify a specific amount of space to place between the
chosen X Relative To point and the anchored frame by typing a
value in the X Offset field.
• The Y Relative To pop-up menu tells InDesign from where the ver-
tical location is calculated, using the following options: Line
(Baseline), Line (Cap-height), Line (Top of Leading), Column Edge,
Text Frame, Page Margin, and Page Edge. As you expect, you can
also indicate a specific amount of space to place between the
chosen Y Relative To point and the anchored frame by typing a
value in the Y Offset field.
• The Keep Within Top/Bottom Column boundaries check box
does exactly what it says.
9. Click OK to insert the anchored frame.
You can create inline frames using the same basic process as above, choosing
Inline or Above Line in Step 4. You’ll get most of the same controls as for
anchored objects, such as the frame size and type, but of course there are no
controls for the relative position because an inline frame goes at the text-
insertion point. But it’s easier to use the techniques described in the previ-
ous section for creating inline frames: copying or placing a frame into text.
183
Chapter 11: Aligning and Arranging Objects

Converting existing frames to anchored frames
After you get the hang of when and how to use anchored frames, you’ll likely
want to convert some frames in existing documents into anchored frames.
There’s no direct way to do that in InDesign, but there is a somewhat cir-
cuitous path you can take:
1. Use the Selection or Direct Selection tool to cut the existing frame that
you want to make into an anchored frame by choosing Edit➪Cut or by
pressing Ô+X or Ctrl+X.
You can also copy an existing frame by choosing Edit➪Copy or by press-
ing Ô+C or Ctrl+C.
2. Switch to the Type tool and click in a text frame at the desired loca-
tion to insert the text reference to the anchored frame.
3. Paste the cut or copied frame into that insertion point by choosing
Edit➪Paste or by pressing Ô+V or Ctrl+V.
You now have an inline frame.
184
Part III: Object Essentials 
Anchoring caveats
There are several caveats to consider when
creating anchored frames:
 Because an anchored frame follows its text
as it flows throughout a document, you
need to ensure that your layout retains
clear paths for those anchored objects to
follow. Otherwise, anchored frames could
overlap other frames as they move.
 Anchored frames should generally be small
items and/or used sparingly. The more items
you have anchored to text, the greater the
chance that they will interfere with each
other’s placement. Likewise, large items
can be moved only so far within a page, so
the benefit of keeping them close to their
related text disappears.
 Items such as pull-quotes are obvious can-
didates for use as anchored frames. But in
many layouts, you want the pull-quotes to
stay in specific locations on the page for
good visual appearance. The InDesign
anchored-frame function can accommo-
date that need for specific positioning on a
page, but you need to be careful as you add
or delete text so that you do not end up with
some pages that have no pull-quotes at all
because there is so much text between the
pull-quotes’ anchor points. Conversely, you
need to make sure you don’t have too many
pull-quotes anchored close to each other,
which could result in overlapping.
Typically, you use anchored frames for small
graphics or icons that you want to keep next to
a specific paragraph (such as the Tip and
Warning icons used in this book). Another good
use would be for cross-reference (“For More
Information”) text frames.

4. Select the frame with the Selection tool, and then choose Object➪
Anchored Object➪Options to display the Anchored Object Options
dialog box.
This dialog box looks like the Insert Anchored Options dialog box,
shown in Figure 11-7, except that it doesn’t include the top Object
Options section.
5. Choose Custom from the Position pop-up menu.
This converts the frame from an inline frame to an anchored frame.
6. Adjust the position for the newly minted anchored frame as described
in the previous section.
7. Click OK when you’re done.
Adjusting anchored frames
After you create an anchored frame, you can adjust its position.
A quick-and-dirty method is simply to click and drag anchored frames or use
the Control panel to adjust their position. If the text the frame is anchored to
moves, however, InDesign overrides those changes. (You can’t manually
move an anchored frame if the Prevent Manual Positioning option is selected
in the Insert Anchored Object dialog box or Anchored Object Options dialog
box. This option is deselected by default.)
For the most control of an anchored frame’s position, choose Object➪
Anchored Object➪Options. The resulting Anchored Object Options dialog box
is identical to the Insert Anchored Object dialog box (covered previously in
this section and shown in Figure 11-7) but without the Object Options section.
And, of course, you can adjust the frame’s other attributes as needed, such
as strokes, fills, dimensions, rotation, and skew.
Releasing and deleting anchored frames
If you no longer want an anchored frame to be anchored to a text location, you
can release the anchor. To do so, select the anchored frame with the Selection
or Direct Selection tool and then choose Object➪Anchored Object➪Release.
It’s also easy to delete an anchored frame: Select the frame with the Selection
or Direct Selection tool and then choose Edit➪Clear or press Delete or
Backspace. If you want to remove the object but keep it on the Clipboard for
pasting elsewhere, choose Edit➪Cut or press Ô+X or Ctrl+X.

etting words on the page is an important part of
what you do with InDesign. After you have the
words in place, you want to tweak the letters and lines,
and the space between them, to make your pages sparkle.
This part shows you how to arrange words on the page,
including words made up of exotic characters. You find
out how to set text in columns and how to add bullets and
numbers to that text. You also find out how to stretch,
squeeze, rotate, and add special effects to text. Additionally,
you see how to become skilled at using character and
paragraph styles to make your life easier and to speed up
your publishing workflow.

ext is more than words — it’s also a layout element that flows through
your pages in the locations that you need. Much of the work you do in
InDesign will be controlling that flow and working with the text as blocks that
need to have the right arrangement to fit your layout’s goals.
This chapter helps you manage that flow and arrangement, showing you how
to deftly maneuver the text through your layout, just as you would move
your way through the dance floor.
After you have the steps nailed down, you can do the dance: bringing in text
from your source files.
Working with Text Frames
When you’re creating a simple layout, such as a single-page flier or a maga-
zine advertisement, you will probably create text frames — the containers
for text — as you need them. But if you’re working on a book or a magazine,
you’ll want your text frames placed on master pages so your text will be con-
sistently framed automatically when it appears on document pages. And
you’ll still have individual text frames you create for specific elements like
sidebars.
Chapter 8 shows you how to create frames (including text frames), whereas
Chapter 6 shows you how to create master pages. This chapter brings those
two concepts together to show you how to work with text frames, both those
in master pages and those you create in your document pages.

Creating master text frames
Master pages — predesigned pages that you can apply to other pages to
automate layout and ensure consistency — can contain several types of text
frames:
 Text frames containing standing text, such as page numbers or page
headers.
 Text frames containing placeholder text for elements such as figure cap-
tions or headlines.
 One master text frame (an automatically placed text frame for flowing
text throughout pages), which you create in the New Document dialog
box (File➪New➪Document, or Ô+N or Ctrl+N).
Think of a master text frame as an empty text frame on the default master
page that lets you automatically flow text through a document. When you
create a new document, you can create a master text frame at the same time.
Here’s how it works:
1. Choose File➪New➪Document or press Ô+N or Ctrl+N.
2. Check the Master Text Frame check box at the top of the New
Document dialog box.
3. Specify the size and placement of the master text frame by entering
values in the Margins area for Top, Bottom, Inside, and Outside (or
Left and Right if Facing Pages is unchecked) fields.
InDesign places guides according to these values and places a text frame
within the guides. The text frame fits within the boundaries of these
values and those of the guides on the master page.
4. To specify the number of columns in the master text frame, enter a
value in the Number field in the Columns area.
You can also specify the amount of space between the columns by enter-
ing a value in the Gutter field.
5. Establish any other needed settings as described in Chapter 3.
Check the Facing Pages check box if your pages will have different inside
and outside margins (for example, a book might have different inside
and outside margins for left-hand and right-hand pages).
6. Click OK to create a new document containing a master text frame.
After you create a document with a master text frame, you’ll see guides on
the first document page that indicate the placement of the frame.
190
Part IV: Text Essentials 

Creating individual text frames
Although the master text frame is helpful for containing body text that flows
through a document, there’s a good chance you’ll need additional text frames
on both master pages and document pages. Generally, these are smaller text
frames that hold text such as headlines, sidebars, or captions.
To add text frames to a master page for repeating elements such as headers
and footers, first display the master page. Choose Window➪Pages or press
Ô+F12 or Ctrl+F12 to display the Pages panel. Then double-click the A-Master
icon in the upper portion of the panel, as shown in Figure 12-1. That displays
the A-Master master page. (If you have multiple master pages in your docu-
ment, you can follow these instructions to add text frames to any of them.
Just choose the desired master page.)
To add text frames to a document page, first go to the page. You can use any
of the techniques described in Chapter 4 to move among pages.
Now draw the desired frame using any of the frame or shape tools, or the
Type tool, as described in Chapter 8. Modify them with the Control panel (or
Transform panel) or by using the mouse, also as described in that chapter.
Text frames you add to a master page will show up on any document pages
based on that master page.

Chapter 12: Putting Words on the Page

If you’re working on a document page and want to type inside a text frame
placed on the page by a master page, select the Type tool and then
Shift+Ô+click or Ctrl+Shift+click the frame.
Making changes to text frames
You’re not confined to the settings you originally established when you set
up a master text frame or an individual text frame — you may change the
size, shape, and/or number of columns in the text frame later. Use the
Selection tool to click the desired text frame and then modify it with the fol-
lowing options (the first six are covered in detail in Chapter 8):
 Change the placement of a selected master text frame by using the X:
and Y: fields in the Control panel.
 Change the size of the master text frame by using the W: and H: fields.
 Change the angle by using the Rotation field.
 Change the skew by using the Shear X field.
 Enter values in the Scale fields to increase or decrease, by percentage
amounts, the width and height of the text frame.
 Use the General pane of the Text Frame Options dialog box
(Object➪Text Frame Options, or Ô+B or Ctrl+B, shown in Figure 12-2) to
make further modifications:
• Change the number of columns and the space between them.
• Specify how far text is inset from each side of the frame.
• Align text vertically within the frame.
• Control the placement of the first baseline.
 Use the Baseline Options pane of the Text Frame Options dialog box to
set a baseline grid, if desired, for the text to align to. Chapter 11
describes this feature in more detail.
If you don’t want the text inside this text frame to wrap around any
items in front of it, check Ignore Text Wrap at the bottom of the
dialog box.
If you open the Text Frame Options dialog box with no document
open, any changes you make will become the default for all new
documents.
 Specify character styles, paragraph styles, object styles, Story panel set-
tings, text-wrap settings, and other text attributes to apply in the text
frame to the document text you flow into that frame. (You can always
override those attributes by applying other styles or formatting to the
text later.) The rest of Part IV covers these other settings.
192
Part IV: Text Essentials 

Additionally, if you select the frame with the Direct Selection tool, you can
change its shape by dragging anchor points on the frame to other positions,
as described in Chapter 9.
Importing Text
You can import text from a word processor file (Word 97/98 or later, RTF,
ASCII (text-only), or InDesign Tagged Text files) into an InDesign text frame
using the Place dialog box (File➪Place, or Ô+D or Ctrl+D). You can also
import Microsoft Excel spreadsheets (version 97/98 or later). Many of the
text’s original styles will remain intact, although you will want to review the
imported text carefully to see if any adjustments need to be made.
Follow these steps to place imported text:
1. Choose File➪Place, or press Ô+D or Ctrl+D to open the Place
dialog box.
2. Locate the text file you want to import.
3. To specify how to handle current formatting in the file, check the
Show Import Options check box.
This opens the appropriate Import Options dialog box for the text file’s
format. (Note that there are no import options for ASCII text.) Then click
OK to return to the Place dialog box.
4. Click the Open button to import the text.
Figure 12-2:

properties
of a text

Chapter 12: Putting Words on the Page

5. If you selected an empty frame with the Type tool, InDesign will flow
the text into that frame. If you selected a text frame with the Type
tool, InDesign will flow the text at the text-insertion point in that
frame, inserting the new text within the existing text.
If you hadn’t already selected a frame before starting to import the text,
specify where to place it by clicking and dragging the loaded-text icon to
create a rectangular text frame, clicking in an existing frame, or clicking
in any empty frame.
You can now select multiple files — text and/or graphics — by Shift+clicking a
range or Ô+clicking or Ctrl+clicking multiple files one by one. InDesign will let
you place each file in a separate frame. Just click once for each file imported,
or Shift+Ô+click or Ctrl+Shift+click to have InDesign place all files on the page
in separate frames. The loaded-text icon will show the number of files to be
placed, as well as a mini preview of each file, as Figure 12-3 shows. When plac-
ing files, you can use the keyboard left- and right-arrow keys to move through
the thumbnail previews before clicking to place the one whose thumbnail pre-
view is currently displayed, so you can place the files in any order you want.
You can’t click on a master text frame — a text frame that is placed on the
page by the master page in use — and simply start typing. To select a master
text frame and add text to it, Shift+Ô+click or Ctrl+Shift+click it. (For more on
master pages, see Chapter 6.)
Import options for Microsoft Word
and RTF files
InDesign offers a comprehensive set of import options for Word and RTF files.
With these options, you can control how these files will import into InDesign.

Part IV: Text Essentials 

To save time on future imports, you can save your import preferences as a
preset file for repeat use.
Figure 12-4 shows the Microsoft Word Import Options dialog box. The import
options for RTF files are identical.
The Preset pop-up menu, at the top of the page, lets you select from saved sets
of import options. You can save the current settings by clicking the Save Preset
button. And you can set a preset as the default import behavior by clicking the
Set as Default button; these settings will be used for all Word file imports
unless you choose a new default or make changes in this dialog box. This lets
you avoid using the Import Options dialog box for your routine imports.
The Include section of the Import Options dialog box is where you decide
whether to strip out specific types of text (Table of Contents Text, Index Text,
Footnotes, and Endnotes) from the Word file. If you check items, their corre-
sponding text will be imported. You probably won’t want to import table-of-
contents or index text because you can create much nicer-looking tables of
contents and indexes in InDesign.
The third section, Options, has just one option: Use Typographer’s Quotes. If
this box is checked, InDesign converts keyboard quotes from your source file
(' and ") to “curly” typographic quotes (‘, ‘, “, and “).
Figure 12-4:

Options
dialog box

Chapter 12: Putting Words on the Page

The fourth section, Formatting, is fairly complex, so take it one step at a
time. Start with deciding whether to remove or retain the formatting in your
imported text.
To remove text formatting during import so that you can do the formatting in
InDesign, select the Remove Styles and Formatting from Text and Tables
option. You have two additional controls for this option:
 Preserve Local Overrides, which retains local formatting such as italics
and boldface while ignoring the paragraph style attributes. You’d usually
want this option checked so that meaning-related formatting is retained.
 You also can choose how tables are “unformatted” during import via the
Convert Tables To pop-up menu. Unformatted Tables retains the table’s
cell structure but ignores text and cell formatting, while Unformatted
Tabbed Text converts the table to tabbed text (with a tab separating
what used to be cells and a paragraph return separating what used to be
rows) and strips out any formatting. If you intend to keep tables as
tables but format them in InDesign, choose Unformatted Tables.
To retain text formatting during import, so that the InDesign document at
least starts out using the settings used in Word, choose the Preserve Styles
and Formatting from Text and Tables option. This option includes several
controls and bits of information:
 The Manual Page Breaks pop-up menu lets you retain any page breaks
entered in Word, convert them to column breaks, or strip them out.
 Checking the Import Inline Graphics check box will enable the import of
any graphics in the Word text.
 Checking the Import Unused Styles check box means that all Word style
sheets will transfer into InDesign, rather than just the ones you actually
applied to text in the file. Unless you want all those extra Word styles,
keep this box unchecked.
 Checking the Track Changes check box preserves the revisions tracking
information from Word so you can see it in the companion Adobe InCopy
editing program. But InDesign itself does not display or let you use that
tracking information. This book does not cover the expert InCopy add-
on software.
 Checking Convert Bullets & Numbers to Text removes any automatic
bullet and numbering lists in Word, converting the bullets and numbers
into the actual characters. If you select this option, and insert an item in
an imported numbered list, the list won’t renumber automatically, as it
would if you leave this unchecked. (In previous versions of InDesign, bul-
lets and numbers were converted, eliminating the automatic aspect.)
196
Part IV: Text Essentials 

 If InDesign detects that the Word file has a style with the same name as
your InDesign document, it will note how many to the right of the Style
Name Conflicts label. You have choices in how to handle these conflicts:
• Use InDesign Style Definition preserves the current InDesign style
sheets and applies them to any text in Word that uses a style sheet
of the same name. Redefine InDesign Style causes the Word style
sheet’s formatting to permanently replace that of InDesign’s style
sheet. Auto Rename renames the Word file’s style sheet and adds it
to the Paragraph Styles or Character Styles panel. This preserves
your existing InDesign style sheets while also preserving those
imported from the Word file.
• Customize Style Import lets you decide which specific InDesign
styles override same-name Word styles, which Word styles over-
ride same-name InDesign styles, and which Word styles are
renamed during import to prevent any overriding.
Import options for Microsoft Excel files
When importing Excel spreadsheets, you have several options, as Figure 12-5
shows.
In the Options section, you can control the following settings:
 The Sheet pop-up menu lets you choose which sheet in an Excel work-
book to import. The default is the first sheet, which is usually named
Sheet1 unless you renamed it in Excel. (If you want to import several
sheets, you’ll need to import the same spreadsheet several times, choos-
ing a different sheet each time.)
 The View pop-up menu lets you import custom views that are defined in
Excel for that spreadsheet. If the spreadsheet has no custom views, this
pop-up menu is grayed out. You can also ignore any custom views by
choosing [Ignore View] from the pop-up menu.
 In the Cell Range pop-up menu, you specify a range of cells using stan-
dard Excel notation Sx:Ey, where S is the first row, x the first column, E
the last row, and y the last column, such as A1:G35. You can enter a
range directly in the pop-up menu, which also acts as a text-entry field,
or choose a previously entered range from the pop-up menu.
 Checking the Import Hidden Cells Not Saved in View check box will
import hidden cells. Be careful when doing so, because these cells are
usually hidden for a reason (typically, they show interim calculations
and the like).
197
Chapter 12: Putting Words on the Page

In the Formatting section, you can control the following settings:
 In the Table pop-up menu, you choose from Formatted Table, which
imports the spreadsheet as a table and retains text and cell formatting;
Unformatted Table, which imports the spreadsheet as a table but does
not preserve formatting; and Unformatted Tabbed Text, which imports
the spreadsheet as tabbed text (tabs separate cells and paragraph
returns separate rows) with no formatting retained.
 In the Table Style pop-up menu, you choose an InDesign table style to
apply to the imported table, or leave it alone (by choosing [No Table
Style]).
 In the Cell Alignment pop-up menu, you tell InDesign how to align the
text in cells. You can retain the spreadsheet’s current alignment settings
by choosing Current Spreadsheet, or override them by choosing Left,
Right, or Center.
 Checking the Include Inline Graphics check box imports any graphics
placed in the Excel cells.
 The Number of Decimal Places to Include field is where you enter how
many decimal places to retain for numbers.
 Check the Use Typographer’s Quotes check box to convert keyboard
quotes (' and ") to the “curly” typographic quotes (‘, ‘, “, and “). It’s a
good idea to keep this box checked.
Pasting text into an InDesign document
As you probably already know, you can hold text on the Mac or Windows
Clipboard by cutting it or copying it from its original location. After you’ve
captured some text on the Clipboard, you can paste it into an InDesign docu-
ment at the location of the cursor. You can also replace highlighted text with
Figure 12-5:
The Import
Options
dialog box
for an Excel
file.
198
Part IV: Text Essentials 

the text that’s on the Clipboard. If no text frame is active when you do the
pasting, InDesign creates a new text frame to contain the pasted text.
InDesign uses standard menu commands and keyboard commands for cut-
ting/copying text to the Clipboard, and for pasting text. On the Mac, press
Ô+X to cut, Ô+C to copy, and Ô+V to paste. In Windows, press Ctrl+X to cut,
Ctrl+C to copy, and Ctrl+V to paste.
Text that is cut or copied from InDesign normally retains its formatting,
whereas text pasted from other programs loses its formatting. But you can
specify whether pasted text from other programs always retains its format-
ting. Go to the Clipboard Handling pane in the Preferences dialog box
(choose InDesign➪Preferences➪Clipboard Handling or press Ô+K on the
Mac, or choose Edit➪Preferences➪Clipboard Handling or press Ctrl+K in
Windows) and select the All Information option in the When Pasting Text and
Tables from Other Applications section. If you select this option, you can still
tell InDesign to not preserve the formatting on a case-by-case basis by choos-
ing Edit➪Paste without Formatting (Shift+Ô+V or Ctrl+Shift+V).
Dragging and dropping text
You can drag highlighted text from other programs — or even text files from
the desktop or a folder — into an InDesign document. Text that you drag and
drop is inserted at the location of the cursor, replaces highlighted text, or is
placed in a new rectangular text frame.
199
Chapter 12: Putting Words on the Page
Keep characters to a minimum
When you’re working with text in a professional
publishing application, such as InDesign, you
need to keep in mind some differences between
the professional method and traditional way of
typing:
 Remember that you don’t need to type two
spaces after a period or colon; books,
newspapers, magazines, and other profes-
sional documents all use just one space
after such punctuation.
 Don’t enter extra paragraph returns for
space between paragraphs and don’t enter
tabs to indent paragraphs — instead, set up
this formatting using InDesign’s paragraph
attributes (Type➪Paragraph, or Option+Ô+T
or Ctrl+Alt+T).
 To align text in columns, don’t enter extra
tabs; place the same number of tabs
between each column, and then align 
the tabs (Type➪Tabs, or Shift+Ô+T or
Ctrl+Shift+T).
To see where your InDesign document has
tabs, paragraph breaks, spaces, and other
such invisible characters, use the command
Option+Ô+I or Ctrl+Alt+I, or choose Type➪
Show Hidden Characters.

When you drag and drop a text selection, its original formatting is usually
retained — unless you hold the Shift key when dragging. If you hold the Shift
key, the text takes on the attributes of the text you drag it into.
When you drag and drop a text file, the process is more like a text import:
The text retains its formatting and styles. Unlike the Place command
(File➪Place, or Ô+D or Ctrl+D) that imports text, drag and drop does not give
you the option to specify how some of the formatting and styles in the
imported text file are handled.
Threading Text Frames
The text that flows through a series of frames is what InDesign considers a
story, and the connections among those frames are called threads. When you
edit text in a threaded story, the text reflows throughout the text frames. You
can also spell-check and do a find/change operation for an entire story, even
though you have just one of the story’s text frames active on-screen.
When you have threaded text frames, you’ll see visual indicators on your text
frame, assuming you choose View➪Show Text Threads (Option+Ô+Y or
Ctrl+Alt+Y) and have selected the frame with one of the selection tools. At
the lower right of the text frame is a small square, called the out port, that
indicates the outflow status:
 If the square is empty, that means there is no text flowing to another
frame, and not enough text to flow to another frame.
 If the square is red and has a plus sign in it, that means there is more
text than fits in the selected frame but that it is not flowing to another
frame. This is called overset text.
 If the square has a triangle icon, that means the text is flowing to
another frame. That doesn’t mean that text is flowing, just that if there is
more text than the current frame can hold, it will flow.
Similarly, there’s an in port at the upper left of a text frame that indicates
whether text is flowing from another frame into the current frame:
 If the square is empty, that means there is no text flowing from another
frame, making this frame the first (and perhaps only) frame in a story.
 If the square has a triangle icon, that means the text is flowing from
another frame. That doesn’t mean that text is flowing, just that if there is
more text than the other frame can hold, it will flow into this frame.
200
Part IV: Text Essentials 

So how do you thread the frames in the first place? You have three options in
InDesign: manual, semi-autoflow, and autoflow. Each of these options has its
own icon. The method you choose depends on the amount of text you’re
dealing with and the size and number of your text frames:
 To link two text frames across several pages (for example, for an article
that starts on page 2 and continues on page 24), you might use the
manual method, in which you click the first text frame’s out port and
then click on the second text frame.
 To link a succession of text frames, you might want to use the semi-
autoflow method, which allows you to click a series of text frames to
flow text from one frame to the next.
 To import text that is intended for long documents (such as a book
chapter or brochure), you might want to use the autoflow method to
add text frames and pages that accommodate the text you’re importing.
For a quick glance at your text threads while you’re threading text across
pages, simply change the document view briefly to 20 percent or so.
Text flows in the order in which you select frames. If you move a frame, its
order in the text flow remains unchanged. If you’re not careful, you could, for
example, accidentally have text flow from a frame at the top of the page to a
frame at the bottom of a page and then to one in the middle of a page.
Threading frames manually
To thread text frames manually, you simply use a selection tool to link out
ports to in ports. You can pre-thread existing text frames by linking empty
text frames and add text later, or you can create threads from a text frame
that contains text.
Always switch to a selection tool when you’re threading frames. Oddly, you
cannot thread frames while the Type tool is selected. Oh well.
To thread text frames, follow these steps:
1. Create a series of text frames that will hold the text you import.
These text frames do not need to be on the same page.
2. Click either the Selection tool or the Direct Selection tool.
3. Click the out port of the first text frame in the thread.
The pointer becomes the loaded-text icon.
201
Chapter 12: Putting Words on the Page

4. Click the in port of the second text frame in the thread.
You can also click any empty frame or click and drag to draw a new text
frame. How text flow behaves depends on the text frame’s status:
• If the first frame held no text, any text placed or typed in later will
flow into the second frame if it doesn’t all fit in the first text frame.
• If the first frame held text but was not already linked to another
text frame, any overset text will flow into the existing text frame.
• If the first text frame was already linked to another text frame, the
text will now be redirected to the text frame you just selected.
5. Use the Pages panel to add or switch pages while you continue click-
ing out ports and in ports until your chain of threaded text frames is
complete.
You can also switch pages using the page controls at the bottom of the
document window, by choosing Layout➪Go to Page, or pressing Ô+J or
Ctrl+J.
6. When you’re finished threading text frames, select another object on
the page or select another tool.
A story imported into any text frame in this chain will start in the upper-
right corner of the first frame and flow through the frames in the same
order as the threads.
Threading frames with the 
semi-autoflow method
InDesign includes a semi-autoflow method of threading text frames, which
incorporates a few automatic shortcuts but varies only slightly from the
manual method. Follow the same steps for threading text frames manually,
except hold down the Option or Alt key each time you click in the next text
frame. Doing so lets you bypass the in ports and out ports and simply click
from text frame to text frame to establish links.
If you want to begin a semi-autoflow process when you place a word-processing
file for the first time, you can Option+click or Alt+click in the first text frame
that will hold the placed text.
As you’re threading frames, Option+click or Alt+click each text frame, or
you’ll revert to manual threading.
202
Part IV: Text Essentials 

Threading frames and automatically
adding pages
You can flow a lengthy story quickly through a document using the autoflow
method for threading frames. You can either autoflow text into the master
text frame or into automatically created text frames that fit within the column
guides. InDesign flows the text into any existing pages, and then adds new
pages based on the current master page. You can initiate autoflow before or
after placing a word processing file.
Placing text while autoflowing
If you haven’t imported text yet, you can place a file and have it automatically
flow through the document. This method works well for flowing text into
pages that are all formatted the same way (as in a book). Here’s how it works:
1. Before you begin, check your master page.
Make sure that the master page you’re using includes a master text
frame or appropriate column guides.
2. With no text frames selected, choose File➪Place or press Ô+D or Ctrl+D.
3. Locate and select the word-processing file you want to import, and
then click Open.
4. When you see the loaded-text icon, Shift+click in the first column that
will contain the text. Be sure to Shift+click near the upper-left corner
of the master text frame, so InDesign uses that frame rather than
create a new one.
InDesign adds all the necessary text frames and pages, and flows in the
entire story.
Autoflowing after placing text
Even if you’ve already placed a text file into a single text frame or a threaded
chain of text frames, you can still autoflow text from the last text frame. To do
this, click the out port, and then Shift+click any page to indicate where to
start the autoflow.
You might use this method if you’re placing the introduction to an article in
an elaborately designed opener page. Then you can flow the rest of the arti-
cle into standard pages.
Breaking and rerouting threads
After text frames are threaded, you have three options for changing the
threads: You can break threads to stop text from flowing, insert a text frame
203
Chapter 12: Putting Words on the Page

into an existing chain of threaded text frames, and remove text frames from a
thread. Here are the techniques in a nutshell:
 Break the link between two text frames by double-clicking either an out
port or an in port. The thread between the two text frames is removed,
and all text that had flowed from that point is sucked out of the subse-
quent text frames and stored as overset text.
 Insert a text frame after a specific text frame in a chain by clicking its out
port. Then, click and drag the loaded-text icon to create a new text
frame. That new frame is automatically threaded to both the previous
and the next text frames.
 Reroute text threads — for example, to drop the middle text frame from
a chain of three — by clicking the text frame with the Selection tool and
then pressing Delete or Backspace. This deletes the text frame and
reroutes the threads. You can also Shift+click to multiple-select text
frames to remove. Note that you cannot reroute text threads without
removing the text frames.
Working with Columns
Where you place columns on the page — and the amount of space you allow
between columns — has a big impact on readability. Used with a little know-
how, column width works with type size and leading to make text easier to
read. Columns help you keep from getting lost from one line to the next, and
from getting a headache as you’re trying to read the words on the page.
Generally, as columns get wider, the type size and leading increase. For
example, you might see 9-point text and 15-point leading in 21⁄2-inch columns,
whereas 15-point text and 13-point leading might work better in 31⁄2-inch
columns.
InDesign lets you place columns on the page automatically, create any
number of columns within a text frame, and change columns at any time.
Specifying columns in master frames
You can specify the number of columns at the same time you create a master
text frame — a text frame placed automatically within the margin guides.
In the Columns area in the New Document dialog box, use the Number field to
specify how many columns, and the Gutter field to specify how much space
to place between the columns. (The gutter is the space between columns.)
Whether or not you check Master Text Frame (which makes the frame appear
on all pages), guides for these columns will still be placed on the page and
can be used for placing text frames and other objects.
204
Part IV: Text Essentials 

Changing columns in text frames
You can change the number of columns in a text frame (whether an individual
text frame or a master text frame), even after you’ve flown text into the
frame — and doing so isn’t difficult. First, select the text frame with a selec-
tion tool or the Type tool (or Shift+click to select multiple text frames and
change all their columns at once). Then choose Object➪Text Frame Options,
or press Ô+B or Ctrl+B, and set the desired Number and Gutter values in the
General pane of the Text Frame Options dialog box, shown in Figure 12-2.
You can also use the Control panel to quickly change the number of columns,
but note that this control will not display on a monitor set below 1152-x-870-
pixel resolution unless you customize the Control panel interface (to disable
other controls to make room for this one) using the Customize command in
its flyout menu.
Some designers like to draw each column as a separate frame. I strongly rec-
ommend against this practice; it’s too easy to create columns of slightly dif-
ferent widths and slightly different positions, so text doesn’t align properly.
Instead, specify columns in your text frames so you won’t have to worry
about sloppy layouts.
Note that the options in the Columns area of the Text Frame Options dialog
box work differently depending on whether Fixed Column Width is checked
or unchecked:
 If Fixed Column Width is unchecked, InDesign subtracts from the text
frame the space specified for the gutters, and then divides the remaining
width by the number of columns to figure out how wide the columns can
be. For example, if you specify a 10-inch-wide text frame with three
columns and a gutter of 1⁄2 inch, you end up with three 3-inch columns
and two 1⁄2-inch gutters. The math is (10–[2 × 0.5]) ÷ 3.
 If Fixed Column Width is checked, InDesign resizes the text frame to fit
the number of columns you selected at the indicated size, as well as the
gutters between them. For example, suppose you’re using a 10-inch-wide
text frame with a column width of 5 inches and a gutter of 1⁄2 inch, and
you choose three columns: You end up with a 15-inch-wide text frame
containing three 5-inch columns and two 1⁄2-inch gutters. The math is 
(5 × 3) + (2 × 2).
Check Preview to see the effects of your changes before finalizing them.
Wrapping Text around Objects
In the days before personal computers and page-layout software, wrapping
text around a graphic or other object was a time-consuming and expensive

task. Text wraps were rare, found only in the most expensively produced pub-
lications. Not any more. Not only do all page-layout programs let you create
text runarounds, most programs — including InDesign — provide several
options for controlling how text relates to graphics and other objects that
obstruct its flow.
When a frame is positioned in front of a text frame, InDesign provides the fol-
lowing options. You can
 Ignore the frame and flow the text behind it.
 Wrap the text around the frame’s rectangular bounding box.
 Wrap the text around the frame itself.
 Jump the text around the frame (that is, jump the text from the top of
the frame to the bottom).
 Jump the text to the next column or page when the text reaches the top
of frame.
 Specify the amount of distance between the text and the edge of the
obstructing shape.
 Flow text within the obstructing shape rather than outside it.
InDesign lets you wrap text around frames on hidden layers — as well as
remove text wrap for objects on hidden layers. This is handy when you want
to hide images or other distracting items but preserve the layout. See
Chapter 5 for details on using layers.
If you want to wrap text around only a portion of a graphic — perhaps you
need to isolate a face in a crowd — the best solution is to open the graphics
file in its original program, create a clipping path around that portion, and
then resave the file and import it and its clipping path into an InDesign docu-
ment (clipping paths are explained in Chapter 19).
The Text Wrap panel
The controls in the Text Wrap panel (see Figure 12-6) let you specify how a
selected object will affect the flow of text behind it. Remember, the flow of
text around an obstructing object is determined by the text wrap settings
applied to the obstructing object.
You can override the text-wrap settings of objects that are in front of a text
frame by telling the text frame to ignore them. To do so, click a text frame,
and then choose Object➪Text Frame Options or press Ô+B or Ctrl+B. In the
Text Frame Options dialog box’s General pane, select Ignore Text Wrap, and
then click OK. Text in the frame will now flow behind any obstructing items
regardless of the text-wrap settings applied to them.
206
Part IV: Text Essentials 

The Text Wrap panel has three options that may not display when you open
it: Wrap Options, Contour Options, and Include Inside Edges. You can more
easily hide/show these functions by double-clicking the double-arrow
symbol to the left of the Text Wrap label in the panel’s tab or by choosing
Hide Options/Show Options from the flyout menu.
Here’s how to apply text-wrap settings to a frame or other object:
1. If the Text Wrap panel is not displayed, choose Window➪Text Wrap or
press Option+Ô+W or Ctrl+Alt+W.
2. Click any of the selection tools.
3. Click the object to which you want to apply text-wrap settings.
The object can be anywhere, but you’ll probably want to position it on
top of a text frame that contains text so you can see the results of the
settings you apply.
4. Click one of the five text-wrap iconic buttons at the top of the Text
Wrap panel.
The iconic buttons show you what each wrap does conceptually.
5. If you want, adjust the space between the surrounding text and the
obstructing shape by typing values in the Top Offset, Bottom Offset,
Left Offset, and Right Offset fields.
These fields are not available if you click the No Text Wrap button. If the
object is a rectangle, all four fields are available if you click the Wrap
around Bounding Box button or Wrap around Object Shape. Only the
Top Offset field is available if you click the Wrap around Object Shape
button for a free-form shape or the Jump to Next Column button. The
Top Offset and Bottom Offset fields are available if you click the Jump
Object button.
If the Make All Settings the Same iconic button displays a chain, then
changing any of the offset values will cause the other offset values to
match. If the icon shows a broken chain, each offset value is indepen-
dent of the others. Click the button to switch between these two modes.
6. Select Invert if you want to flow the text in the obstructing shape.
7. If you choose the Wrap around Object Shape button and there is a
graphic in the frame, you can also select from the Contour Options’s
Type pop-up menu.
There are six options:
• Bounding Box is the same as clicking the Wrap around Bounding
Box button.
• Detect Edges tries to determine the graphic’s outside boundary by
ignoring white space — you would use this for bitmapped images
that have a transparent or white background.
207
Chapter 12: Putting Words on the Page

• Alpha Channel uses the image’s alpha channel, if any, to create a
wrapping boundary (see Chapter 19).
• Photoshop Path uses the image’s clipping path, if any, to create a
wrapping boundary (see Chapter 19).
• Graphic Frame uses the frame’s boundary rather than the bound-
ing box.
• Same as Clipping uses the clipping path for the graphic created in
InDesign (see Chapter 19).
8. You can control how text wraps around an object that splits a column
by choosing an option from the Wrap To pop-up menu.
The options are Right Side, Left Side, Both Left and Right Sides, Side
Towards Spine, Side Away from Spine, and Largest Area. You’ll rarely
choose Both Left and Right Sides, because unless the object is small,
readers’ eyes will stop at the interposed object and not see the rest of the
text on the other side of it. Use either of the spine options to have the
text stay on the outside or inside of a page, relative to the object, based
on whether the page is right-facing or left-facing. You’ll often choose
Largest Area because that gives the text the most space next to the inter-
posed object, which tends to be what looks good in many situations.
9. By selecting the Include Inside Edges option, InDesign lets text appear
inside any interior “holes” in the graphic. You’ll rarely use this tech-
nique because in most cases it’s hard for the reader to follow text that
wraps around an image, flows inside it, and then continues to flow out-
side it. But if the interior is large enough and not too distant from the
text that flows on the outside, this effect might be readable.
If you specify text-wrap settings when no objects are selected, the settings
are automatically applied to all new objects.

Wrap panel

Part IV: Text Essentials 

To apply text-wrap settings to a master item on a document page, press and
hold Shift+Ô or Ctrl+Shift to select the item, and then use the controls in the
Text Wrap panel as just described. If you don’t want the text wrap applied to
existing document items, just to new ones, choose Apply to Master Page Only
in the flyout menu.
Setting text-wrap preferences
There are several global text-wrap options you should be aware of, all of
which are accessed via the Composition pane of the Preferences dialog box
(choose InDesign➪Preferences➪Composition or press Ô+K on the Mac, or
choose Edit➪Preferences➪Composition or press Ctrl+K in Windows). Here
are the options:
 Justify Text Next to an Object. This option is useful when you have left-
aligned text that wraps around an object at the right. (It also works if
you have right-aligned text that wraps around an object at the left.) This
can lead to an awkward wrap, however, because InDesign won’t try to
make the text align precisely to the wrap’s contour (because the text
isn’t justified). Use this option to justify the text just around the wrap,
and then continue using the text’s specified non-justified alignment.
 Skip by Leading. This option makes text wrap below or above an object
based on the text’s leading, so there’s at least a full line space between
the text and the object, even if the object’s text-wrap settings would
allow less space.
 Text Wrap Only Affects Text Beneath. This option, if selected, prevents
text frames placed on top of an object from wrapping, while those
behind the graphic frame will still be allowed to wrap. This option
allows some text to overlap the graphic and other text to wrap around it.
Note this is a global setting, affecting all objects. To override wrap set-
tings of individual text frames, choose Object➪Text Frame Options, or
press Ô+B or Ctrl+B, and enable the Ignore Text Wrap option in the
General pane.

hether you import text or type it into text frames directly in InDesign,
you’ll appreciate the tools that let you edit that text, search and
replace, spell-check, and hyphenate your text. You’ll find out all about these
capabilities in this chapter.
To do anything with text, you need to use the Type tool. When the Type tool
is selected, you can click in any empty frame. (If it’s not already a text frame,
it will become one automatically when you click it with the Type tool.) Or you
can click and drag to create a new text frame. You can even click in an exist-
ing block of text. From this point, start typing to enter text.
Chapter 8 gets into more of the nitty-gritty of creating frames. And you can
discover all about importing text in Chapter 12.
Editing Text
InDesign offers basic editing capabilities, not unlike those found in a word
processor: cutting and pasting, deleting and inserting text, searching and
replacing of text and text attributes, and spell checking. (Cutting, pasting,
inserting, and deleting text works just like it does for any standard Mac or
Windows program, so I won’t repeat those details for you here.)

Controlling text view
In many layout views, the text is too small to work with. Generally, you zoom
in around the block of text using the Zoom tool. Select the tool, and then click
to zoom in. To zoom out, hold the Option or Alt key when clicking.
Another way to zoom in is to use the keyboard shortcut Ô+= or Ctrl+=. Each
time you use it, the magnification increases. (Zoom out via Ô+– [hyphen] or
Ctrl+– [hyphen].)
In addition to seeing the text larger, zooming in also helps you see the spaces,
tabs, and paragraph returns that exist in the text. Choose Type➪Show
Hidden Characters or press Option+Ô+I or Ctrl+Alt+I to have the nonprinting
indicators for those characters display.
Navigating through text
To work at a different text location in your InDesign document, click in a dif-
ferent text frame or another location in the current text frame. You can also
use the four arrow (cursor) keys on the keyboard to move one character to
the right, one character to the left, one line up, or one line down. Hold Ô or
Ctrl when pressing the arrow keys to jump one word to the right or left, or
one paragraph up or down. The Home and End keys let you jump to the
beginning or end of a line; hold Ô or Ctrl when pressing those keys to jump
to the beginning or end of a story. (A story is text within a text frame or that
is linked across several text frames.)
Highlighting text
To highlight (or select) text, you can click and drag. Or you can use some
keyboard options. For example, Shift+Ô+right arrow or Ctrl+Shift+right arrow
highlights the next word to the right. Likewise, Shift+Ô+End or Ctrl+Shift+End
highlights all the text to the end of the story.
To highlight a word, double-click (this will not select its punctuation) and
triple-click to select the entire paragraph. If you’re highlighting a word and also
want to include the punctuation that follows the word, double-click, and then
press Shift+Ô+right arrow or Ctrl+Shift+right arrow to extend the selection.
To select an entire story, choose Edit➪Select All, or press Ô+A or Ctrl+A.
212
Part IV: Text Essentials 

To deselect text, choose Edit➪Deselect All or press Shift+Ô+A or Ctrl+Shift+A.
An even easier way to deselect text is simply to select another tool or click
another area of the page.
Undoing text edits
It’s nice to know that InDesign makes it easy for you to change your mind
about text edits. Choose Edit➪Undo and Edit➪Redo any time you change
your mind about edits. The Undo and Redo keyboard commands are defi-
nitely worth remembering: Ô+Z and Shift+Ô+Z or Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Shift+Z.
Using the Story Editor
The Story Editor is a window that lets you see your text without the distrac-
tions of your layout. In it, you see your text without line breaks or other
nonessential formatting — you just see attributes like boldface and italics, as
well as the names of the paragraph styles applied in a separate pane to the
left (see Figure 13-1). After clicking in a text frame, you open the Story Editor
by choosing Edit➪Edit in Story Editor or by pressing Ô+Y or Ctrl+Y.
Figure 13-1:
The Story
Editor.
213
Chapter 13: The Ins and Outs of Text Editing

In the Story Editor, you use the same tools for selection, deletion, copying,
pasting, and search and replace as you would in your layout. The Story
Editor is not a separate word processor; it’s simply a way to look at your text
in a less distracting environment for those times when your mental focus is
on the meaning and words, not the text appearance.
The Story Editor also shows you the column depth for text, using a ruler along
the left side of the text, just to the right of the list of currently applied para-
graph styles. Overset text (text that goes beyond the text frame, or beyond
the final text frame in a threaded story) is indicated by a depth measurement
of OV and is furthermore noted with a red line to the right of the text.
Searching and Replacing Text
InDesign has a handy Find/Change feature (Edit➪Find/Change, or Ô+F or
Ctrl+F) that is similar to the search-and-replace features with which you may
already be familiar if you’ve used any word processor or page-layout applica-
tion. With the Find/Change dialog box, you can find and change text or you
can extend the search to include attributes. Before starting a Find/Change
operation, first determine the scope of your search:
 To search within a text selection, highlight the selection.
 To search from one point in a story to its end, click the cursor at that
beginning location.
 To search an entire story, select any frame or click at any point in a
frame containing the story.
 To search an entire document, simply have that document open.
 To search multiple documents, open all of them (and close any that you
don’t want to search).
Then choose the appropriate search scope — InDesign’s term for range —
using the Search pop-up menu and the scope iconic buttons below it.
Figure 13-2 shows the Find/Change dialog box.
InDesign CS3 adds a lot of new features to the Find/Change dialog box, includ-
ing a new interface, the ability to search for special characters (glyphs), the
ability to search for object attributes (see Chapter 9), and the ability to save
search/replace queries so you can use them repeatedly. (It also lets you use
the Unix grep syntax for conducting criteria-based searches; this feature is
for experts familiar with grep searching and so is not covered in this book.)
214
Part IV: Text Essentials 

Replacing text
To search for text, follow these steps:
1. Determine the scope of your search, open the appropriate documents,
and insert the text cursor at the appropriate location.
2. Choose Edit➪Find/Change or press Ô+F or Ctrl+F.
Go to the Text pane if it’s not already displayed.
3. Use the Search pop-up menu, as shown in Figure 13-2, to specify the
scope of your search by choosing All Documents, Document, Story, 
To End of Story, or Selection.
Unavailable options won’t display, such as Selection in Figure 13-2.
4. Type or paste the text you want to find in the Find What field.
To use special characters, use the Special Characters for Search pop-up
list (the icon to the right of the Find What field) to select from a menu of
special characters (see Figure 13-3).
5. Type or paste the replacement text into the Change To field.
To use special characters, use the Special Characters for Replace pop-up
list (to the right of the Find What field).

6. Specify any additional parameters for your search by selecting or 
deselecting the seven iconic buttons at the bottom of the pane: Include
Locked Layers, Include Locked Stories, Include Hidden Layers, Include
Master Pages, Include Footnotes, Case Sensitive, and Whole Word.
If an icon’s background darkens, it is selected.
7. To search for or replace with specific formatting, use the Format
buttons.
These buttons are available only if you had clicked the More Options
button. (Look for details later in this section.)
8. Click the Find button to start the search.
After the search has begun, click the Find Next button (it changes from
the Find button after you start the search) to skip instances of the Find
What text, and click the Change, Change All, or Change/Find buttons as
appropriate. (Clicking the Change button simply changes the found text,
clicking the Change All button changes every instance of that found text in
your selection or story, and clicking the Change/Find button changes the
current found text and moves on to the next occurrence of it — it basi-
cally does in one click the actions of clicking Change and then Find Next.)
If you use the Change All feature, InDesign reports how many changes
were made. If the number looks extraordinarily high and you suspect the
Find/Change operation wasn’t quite what you wanted, remember that
you can use InDesign’s undo function (Edit➪Undo, or Ô+Z or Ctrl+Z) to
cancel the search and replace, and then try a different replace strategy.
9. Click the Done button when you’re finished doing the finding and
replacing.

Replacing formatting
To find and change formatting or text with specific formatting, use the
expanded Find/Change dialog box. For example, you might find all the words
in 14-point Futura Extra Bold and change them to 12-point Bodoni.
To replace text formatting, follow these steps:
1. To add formats to a Find/Change operation for text, click the More
Options button in the Find/Change dialog box (if it was not clicked
earlier).
The dialog box expands to include the Find Format Settings and Change
Format Settings areas.
2. Use the Format buttons to display the Find Format Settings and
Change Format Settings dialog boxes, which let you specify the for-
mats you want to find.
Your options are Style Options (paragraph and character styles), Basic
Character Formats, Advanced Character Formats, Indents and Spacing,
Keep Options, Bullets and Numbering, Character Color, OpenType
Features, Underline Options, Strikethrough Options, and Drop Caps and
Other. You can change multiple attributes at once by making selections
from as many panes as needed.
Open one of these dialog boxes, select the desired formatting to search
or replace, and then click OK when done. Now open the other dialog box
to select its formatting, and then click OK when done.
3. Click Find Next and then Change to change the next occurrence, or
click Change All to change all occurrences. Click Done when you are
finished with the search and replace.
217
Chapter 13: The Ins and Outs of Text Editing
The solution to missing fonts
Sometimes, when you open a document,
InDesign tells you that it can’t find the fonts used
in the documents on your computer. You get the
option of finding the missing fonts, which opens
the Find Fonts dialog box. This dialog box shows
the names of all missing fonts; if you select one,
you can change all occurrences of that font to
one that you do have by selecting a new font
family and font style from the menus at the
bottom of the dialog box and then clicking
Change All. New to InDesign CS3 is the Redefine
Style When Changing All check box, which, if
selected, ensures that any font replaced is also
replaced in any paragraph and character styles
that used the original font.
Of course, another — often preferable — 
solution is to get the fonts installed on your com-
puter. After all, the design shouldn’t change just
because you don’t happen to have the needed
fonts on your computer.

To search and replace formatting only — regardless of the text to which it is
applied — leave the Find What and Change To fields blank.
Changing special characters
InDesign CS3 also lets you replace special characters (glyphs) through a sep-
arate Glyph pane in the Find/Change dialog box. This makes it easier to actu-
ally enter the desired characters. The process is mostly straightforward (just
ignore the parts of the pane not described below):
1. In the Find Glyph section, choose the font of the desired character in
the Font Family pop-up menu, and its style in the Font Style pop-up
menu.
2. To choose the character itself, click the unnamed pop-up menu to the
right of the Glyph field.
You’ll get a dialog box that mimics the Glyphs panel (see Chapter 16);
choose the character from the panel by double-clicking it.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 using the controls in the Change Glyph section to
select the replacement glyph.
4. Set the scope of your search using the Search pop-up menu and the
Include Locked Layers, Include Locked Stories, Include Hidden
Layers, Include Master Pages, and Include Footnotes buttons, as
described earlier in this chapter.
5. Execute the search and/or replace using the Find, Change, Change All,
and Change/Find buttons as described earlier in this chapter.
6. Click Done when done.
If you want to quickly wipe out the selected glyphs, click the Clear Glyphs
button.
Working with saved queries
If you plan to do the same search and/or replace operation repeatedly, you
can now save queries in InDesign CS3. After entering the find and search
information, click the Save Query iconic button, enter a name in the Save
Query dialog box that appears, and click OK. That query will now appear in
the Query pop-up menu in the Find/Change dialog box.
To run a saved query, just choose it from the Query pop-up menu. To delete a
saved query, choose it from the Query pop-up menu and then click Delete
Query iconic button.
That’s all there is to it!
218
Part IV: Text Essentials 

Checking Spelling
The spell-check feature not only helps you eradicate spelling errors, but it
also catches repeated words, as well as words with odd capitalization such
as internal capitalization (called intercaps). InDesign also flags words not
found in the spelling dictionary. You can customize the spelling dictionary,
and you can purchase additional spelling dictionaries.
Checking spelling as you type
You can have InDesign check your spelling as you type by simply choosing
Edit➪Spelling➪Dynamic Spelling. If that menu option is checked, your
spelling will be checked as you type, as will the spelling of any text already in
the document. Suspected errors are highlighted with red squiggle underlin-
ing, so that you can correct them as needed. If you want InDesign to suggest
proper spelling, you’ll need to use the Check Spelling dialog box, covered in
the next section.
Correcting mistakes on the fly
If you use a word processor, chances are it is one that corrects mistakes as
you type. Microsoft Word, for example, has a feature called AutoCorrect that
lets you specify corrections to be made as you type, whether those be
common typos you make or the expansion of abbreviations to their full
words (such as having Word replace tq with thank you).
InDesign offers much of the same functionality, which it calls Autocorrect.
Unlike Word, you cannot use this feature to replace symbols, such as having
InDesign convert (R) to the (r) symbol as you type. Note that — like Word —
Autocorrect works only for text entered in InDesign after Autocorrect is
turned on; it will not correct imported or previously typed text. 
You enable Autocorrect in the Autocorrect pane of the Preferences dialog box
(choose InDesign➪Preferences➪Autocorrect or press Ô+K on the Mac, or
choose Edit➪Preferences➪Autocorrect or press Ctrl+K in Windows). If you
want InDesign to automatically fix capitalization errors, check the
Autocorrect Capitalization Errors check box. Typically, this finds typos
involving capitalizing the second letter of a word in addition to the first. For
example, InDesign would replace FOrmat with Format.
To add your own custom corrections, click the Add button. This opens the
Add to Autocorrect List dialog box, where you can enter the typo text or
code that you want InDesign to be alert for in the Misspelled Word field, as
well as the corrected or expanded text you want InDesign to substitute in the
Correction field.
219
Chapter 13: The Ins and Outs of Text Editing

Using the Check Spelling dialog box
The Check Spelling dialog box not only lets you choose what part of the docu-
ment to spell check, but it also provides suggestions on correct spelling. Plus,
you can use the dialog box to add correctly spelled words to InDesign’s
spelling dictionary. Even if you use the new dynamic spell-checking feature,
you’ll still want to do a final spell-checking pass with the Check Spelling
dialog box.
Specifying the text to check is a two-step process: First set up the spell check’s
scope in the document, and then specify the scope in the Search menu.
To set up the scope for the spell check, highlight text, click in a story to
check from the cursor forward, select a frame containing a story, or open
multiple documents.
Next, open the Check Spelling dialog box (Edit➪Spelling➪Check Spelling, or
Ô+I or Ctrl+I) and choose an option from the Search pop-up menu: Document,
All Documents, Story, To End of Story, and Selection. Figure 13-4 shows the
dialog box. You may not see all the options in the Search pop-up menu; the list
of options depends on how you set up the scope. For example, if you didn’t
highlight text, the Selection option will not be available. However, you can
change the scope setup in the document while the Check Spelling dialog box is
open — for example, you can open additional documents to check.
When you first open the Check Spelling dialog box, if text is selected or the
text cursor is active, it immediately begins checking the spelling, going to the
first suspect word.
Otherwise, the dialog box displays “Ready to Check Spelling” at the top. To
begin checking the text, click Start.
Figure 13-4:
In the Check
Spelling
dialog box,
use the
Search pop-
up menu to
specify
which text
to spell-
check.
220
Part IV: Text Essentials 

You can adjust the scope of the spell-check by using the Search pop-up menu
and choosing All Documents, Document, Story, and To End of Story. You can
also make the spell-check case-sensitive by checking the Case Sensitive
check box.
When the spell checker encounters a word without a match in the dictionary
or a possible capitalization problem, the dialog box displays “Not in
Dictionary” at the top and shows the word. When the spell checker encoun-
ters a duplicate word, such as of of, the dialog box displays “Duplicate Word”
and shows which word is duplicated. Use the buttons along the right side of
the dialog box to handle flagged words as follows:
 Click the Skip button (this appears only after the spell-check has started)
to leave the current instance of a Not in Dictionary word or Duplicate
Word unchanged. To leave all instances of the same problem unchanged,
click the Ignore All button.
 To change the spelling of a Not in Dictionary word, click a word in
the Suggested Corrections list or edit the spelling or capitalization
in the Change To field. To make the change, click the Change button.
 To correct an instance of a Duplicate Word, edit the text in the Change
To field, and then click the Change button.
 To change all occurrences of a Not in Dictionary word or a Duplicate Word
to the information in the Change To field, click the Change All button.
 To add a word flagged as incorrect — but that you know is correct — to
InDesign’s spelling dictionary, click the Add button. (If you have multiple
dictionaries, first choose the dictionary to add it to using the Add To
pop-up menu.)
 To add a word flagged as incorrect to a specific dictionary, click the
Dictionary button. A Dictionary dialog box appears, which lets you
choose the dictionary to which you want to add the word, as well as
what language to associate it with.
 After you’ve finished checking spelling, click the Done button to close
the Check Spelling dialog box.
Changing the spelling and
hyphenation dictionaries
The spelling dictionary that comes with InDesign is pretty extensive, but it’s
very likely that you will need to add words to it. For example, your company
might use words that are company-specific terms. Or you might use some
product or individuals’ names that would not typically be found in the diction-
ary. Additionally, you might have some words that you prefer not to hyphenate,
others that you want to hyphenate in a specific manner. To address these
221
Chapter 13: The Ins and Outs of Text Editing

issues, you can customize InDesign’s spelling and hyphenation dictionaries.
InDesign handles both spelling and hyphenation in one dictionary for each lan-
guage, so you use the same controls to modify both spelling and hyphenation.
Changes made to a dictionary file are saved only in the dictionary file, not
with an open document. So if you add words to the English: USA dictionary,
the modified dictionary is used for spell checking and hyphenating all text in
documents that use the English: USA dictionary.
If you’re in a workgroup, be sure to share the edited dictionary file so that
everyone is using the same spelling and hyphenation settings. (The file is
located in the Dictionaries folder inside the Plug-ins folder inside your
InDesign folder.) You can copy it for other users, who must then restart
InDesign or press Option+Ô+/ or Ctrl+Alt+/ to reflow the text according to the
new dictionary’s hyphenation.
Customizing the spelling dictionary
When you add a word to the spelling dictionary, this word will no longer be
flagged when you check spelling, and you can be sure that when it’s used, it
is spelled as it is in the dictionary.
When you add words to the dictionary, you can specify their capitalization.
For example, InDesign’s dictionary prefers E-mail. You can add e-mail if you
prefer a lowercase e or email if you prefer to skip the hyphen. To add words
to the dictionary, follow these steps:
1. Choose Edit➪Spelling➪Dictionary.
The Dictionary dialog box, shown in Figure 13-5, appears.
2. Choose whether the addition to the dictionary affects just this docu-
ment or all documents.
The Target pop-up menu lists the current document name as well as the
name of the user dictionary.
3. Choose the dictionary that you want to edit from the Language pop-up
menu.
4. Type or paste a word in the Word field.
The word can have capital letters if appropriate, and it can include spe-
cial characters such as accents and hyphens.
5. To have the added word accepted as being spelled correctly only with
the capitalization specified in the Word field, check the Case Sensitive
check box.
6. To edit the hyphenation of the word, click the Hyphenate button.
I cover hyphenation in the next section.
7. Click the Add button.

8. To import a word list or export one for other users to import into
their copies of InDesign, click the Import or Export button.
You will then navigate to a folder and choose a filename in a dialog box.
Note that when you click the Export button, InDesign will export all
selected words from the list. If no words are selected, it will export all
the words in the list.
9. When you’re finished adding words, click the Done button.
To delete a word that you added to the dictionary, select it in the list and click
the Remove button. To change the spelling of a word you added, delete it and
then re-add it with the correct spelling. You can see all deleted words — just
those deleted since you opened the dialog box — by selecting Removed Words
from the Dictionary List pop-up menu, so you can add back any deleted by
error.
Customizing hyphenation points
People can be particular about how to hyphenate words. Fortunately,
InDesign lets you modify the hyphenation dictionary by specifying new, hier-
archical hyphenation points.
Follow these steps to specify hyphenation points:
1. Choose Edit➪Spelling➪Dictionary.
2. In the Language pop-up menu, pick the dictionary that you want to edit.
3. Type or paste the word in the Word field; you can also double-click a
word in the list.

4. To see InDesign’s suggestions for hyphenating the word, click the
Hyphenate button.
If you want to change the hyphenation, continue on to Step 5.
5. Type a tilde (~, obtained by pressing Shift+`, the open single keyboard
quote at the upper left of the keyboard) at your first preference for a
hyphenation point in the word.
If you don’t want the word to hyphenate at all, type a tilde in front of it.
6. To indicate an order of preference, use two tildes for your second
choice, three tildes for your third choice, and so on. InDesign will first
try to hyphenate your top preferences (single tildes), and then it will try
your second choices if the first ones don’t work out, and so on.
7. Click the Add button.
8. Continue to add words until you’re finished, and then click the Done
button.
To revert a word to the default hyphenation, select it in the list and click the
Remove button. To change the hyphenation, double-click a word in the list to
enter it in the Word field, change the tildes, and then click the Add button.
When you’re adding variations of words, you can double-click a word in the
list to place it in the Word field as a starting place.

 Applying styles
I
t’s the dirty secret of desktop publishing: Most users avoid using styles,
even though they know they should. Instead, they apply formatting locally
to text, hoping it’s the same as a few pages back. It’s a lot like not eating your
vegetables — even though we know that they’re good for us (and they even
taste good), it’s easier to get something already made, never mind what’s in it.
So, I’m going to tell you about styles before I get to the other ways to format
text. Styles really are good for you: They will save you lots of work, help you
avoid embarrassingly inconsistent formatting, and give you more time to
indulge in the guilty pleasure of local formatting.
A style is a simple but powerful concept: It’s a collection of formatting attrib-
utes that you can apply to text all at once, saving you time. Even better, if you
change the style, all text that uses it is automatically updated, saving you
time and ensuring consistency. That’s got to be appealing!
I cover the particulars of paragraph and character formatting in Chapters 15
and 16, respectively. The formats themselves are the same whether you apply
them directly (locally) or through a style (globally). I cover table styles and
cell styles in Chapter 20 and object styles in Chapter 10, although the basic
creation and management methods are the same for all styles.
Text in your layout may already have styles applied, using styles defined in
Microsoft Word, as explained in Chapter 12.

If you have a smallish monitor, set at 1024 by 768 pixels — the norm for a 17-
inch display — the Character Styles and Paragraph Styles panels are shoved
to the bottom of the panel dock, and, when they’re selected, the only thing
you’ll see is their panel tab and flyout menu icon. You have a few choices:
Shorten other panel groups in the dock to make room for them, remove other
panel groups to make room for them, or drag them out of the dock and make
them floating.
Creating Styles
InDesign gives you two kinds of styles for text: paragraph and character.
Paragraph styles apply formatting to entire paragraphs, while character
styles apply formatting to text selections. Unless you’re doing a one-page ad,
the formatting of which won’t be repeated, you should have paragraph styles
for all different types of paragraphs in your layout. You would also have char-
acter styles for places where you consistently want to override your para-
graph styles, such as for the lead-in of a bulleted paragraph that might have
the first few words in a different font or color.
Whether you’re creating styles for paragraphs or characters, the basic
process is the same.
The easiest way is to format your text using the Paragraph and Character
panels, as described in Chapters 15 and 16, and then make sure you’ve
selected the text you want to use as the model for your new style. Next,
create the appropriate type of new style:
 For paragraph styles, open the Paragraph Styles panel by choosing
Type➪Paragraph Styles or pressing Ô+F11 or Ctrl+F11. Then choose
New Paragraph Style from the flyout menu to open the New Paragraph
Style dialog box shown in Figure 14-1.
 For character styles, open the Character Styles panel by choosing
Type➪Character Styles or pressing Shift+Ô+F11 or Ctrl+Shift+F11. Then
choose New Character Style from the flyout menu to open the New
Character Style dialog box shown in Figure 14-2.
The shortcut for accessing the Paragraph Styles panel has changed to
Ô+F11 or Ctrl+F11 in InDesign CS3 from just F11 in previous versions.
Similarly, the shortcut for the Character Styles has changed to
Shift+Ô+F11 or Ctrl+Shift+F11 from the previous Shift+F11. But the old
shortcuts continue to work, though they may interfere with Mac OS X’s
Exposé software.
226
Part IV: Text Essentials 

In both cases, the style will pick up the selected text’s formatting. Adjust the
style further if desired, give the style a name using the Style Name field in the
General pane, and then click OK.

227
Chapter 14: The Styles of Text

Of course, you can specify all the formatting directly in the new-style dialog
boxes rather than having InDesign pick it up from existing text. Create the
new styles as just described, and then go through each of the panes (select-
ing each from the list at the left of the dialog box) and choose your settings.
In the General pane of the New Paragraph Style and New Character Style dialog
boxes, there are several controls that make styles work more intelligently:
 The Based On pop-up menu displays the names of other styles. You use
this feature to create families of styles. Thus, if you change a style that
other styles are based on, all those styles are updated with the new
settings.
 In the Shortcut field, hold down any combination of Ô, Option, and Shift,
or Ctrl, Alt, and Shift, and press any number on the keypad. (Letters and
non-keypad numbers cannot be used for keyboard shortcuts. And
Windows users need to make sure that Num Lock is on.)
 If you want to apply a new style to text that is selected, be sure to check
the Apply Style to Selection check box before clicking OK to save the
new style.
InDesign comes with a predefined default paragraph style called [Basic
Paragraph] that text in a new frame automatically has applied to it. You can
edit [Basic Paragraph] like any other style. Similarly, there’s a predefined
character style called [Basic Character].
There are several things to keep in mind when creating paragraph styles.
(Character styles are pretty straightforward, so I’m not presenting a similar
list for them.)
 To have InDesign automatically apply a different style to the next para-
graph when you type in text, choose a style name from the Next Style
pop-up menu while defining a style. For example, when you define a
style named Headline, you might choose Byline as the next style, so after
you type in a headline, the next paragraph will be formatted for a byline.
Obviously, you need to have the Byline style available.
 If you want your paragraph style to use a character style, you must
define that character style first. (Drop caps and nested styles use char-
acter styles.)
A special function available to paragraph styles is something called a nested
style. Basically, a nested style is a way of applying a series of character styles
within a paragraph style based on a set of parameters you specify. For exam-
ple, in a numbered list, you might want one character style applied to the
numeral, and another to the first sentence, and then have the paragraph
228
Part IV: Text Essentials 

style’s text formatting applied to the rest of the paragraph. With nested
styles, you build all that into the paragraph style and let InDesign do the
heavy lifting. Here’s how it works:
1. Define any character styles that you’ll apply to text through a nested
style.
Even if all you’re doing is making text italic, you need to define a charac-
ter style to do so. The Nested Styles feature cannot apply any attributes
other than those available in a character style.
2. Open the Paragraph panel (Type➪Paragraph Styles, or Ô+F11 or
Ctrl+F11), choose Style Options from the flyout menu to open the
Paragraph Style Options dialog box, and go to the Drop Caps and
Nested Styles pane.
3. Click New Nested Style.
An entry appears in the Nested Styles section of the dialog box. This is
what will be applied to text.
4. Click the style name in the Nested Styles section of the pane to choose
from an existing character style.
When you click the style name, a list of other styles appears, including
[None], which uses the paragraph style’s default formatting.
You also have the [Repeat] option, which, if selected, lets you repeat a
sequence of previous styles (you choose the number in the third column).
5. Click in the second column to determine the scope end point.
Your choices are Through or Up To. For example, if you choose Through
for a nested style that is set for four words, all four words will get the
nested style. If you choose Up To, the first three words will get the style
and the fourth will not.
6. In the third column, specify how many items you want InDesign to
count in determining the scope’s end point.
For example, if you want to have the first seven characters have the
style applied, choose 7. If you want to have the style applied up to the
first tab, choose 1.
7. Click the item in the fourth column to specify the scope of text to
which you’re applying the nested styles.
Figure 14-3 shows the options. They break into three groups: a number of
items (characters, words, and so on), a specific character (tab, em space,
and so on), and a specific marker character (inline graphic marker, auto
page number, and section marker). Whatever you choose needs to be con-
sistent in all your text because InDesign will follow these rules slavishly.
229
Chapter 14: The Styles of Text

8. Create multiple nested styles in one paragraph with different rules
for each.
Obviously, you may not need to do this, but the option exists. InDesign
applies the styles in the order in which they appear in the dialog box,
and each starts where the other ends. Use the up and down arrow but-
tons to change the order of nested styles.
9. Select the Preview option to preview the formatting if you selected
sample text before opening the dialog box.
10. Click OK when you’re done.
Managing Styles
InDesign provides lots of ways to manage your styles. In this section, I cover
the common ones. Note that the options described here also apply to object
styles, table styles, and cell styles — so, for example, the Load Paragraph
Styles menu option will have a counterpart in the Object Styles, Table Styles,
and Cell Styles panels’ flyout menus.
Updating styles
If you’ve already created a style and want to change it, just go to the appro-
priate styles panel and choose Style Options from its flyout menu. If you’ve
selected text that has the formatting you want the style to use in place of its
current formatting, just choose Redefine Style from the flyout menu.
Remember that all text using the style will be automatically be updated
when the style changes.
Figure 14-3:

a nested
style to, for
example, set
the first

230
Part IV: Text Essentials 

Sharing styles with others
The Load Paragraph Styles or Load Character Styles menu option (based on
which styles panel is open) and the Load All Text Styles menu option let you
import styles from another InDesign document. (Load All Text Styles imports
paragraph and character styles at the same time.) You will get a dialog box
listing the styles in the chosen document, so you can decide which ones to
import.
If you import styles whose names match those in the current document,
InDesign gives you a chance to let the imported style overwrite the current
style or to leave the current style as is and give the imported style a new
name. If there is an entry in the Conflict with Existing Style, you can click that
entry for a pop-up menu that provides two choices: Auto-Rename and Use
Incoming Style Definition. Figure 14-4 shows this Load Styles dialog box.
Note that at the bottom of the dialog box is the Incoming Style Definitions
window, which lists the style definitions to help you decide which to import,
as well as which to overwrite or rename.
231
Chapter 14: The Styles of Text
What’s that Quick Apply panel?
Another way to apply paragraph and character
styles (and object styles, scripts, menu com-
mands, and other elements) is by using the
Quick Apply feature. Quick Apply is a consoli-
dated list of styles that you access by choosing
Edit➪Quick Apply, by clicking the Quick Apply
iconic button (the lightning-bolt icon) in many
panels, or by pressing Ô+Return or Ctrl+Enter.
If you have selected text or have the text-
insertion point active, the Quick Apply panel
presents all stored formatting attributes avail-
able. You can scroll down to the one you want,
or you can type the first few letters of the style
name in the text field at the top to jump to styles
beginning with those letters and then navigate
to the one you want. Then press Return or Enter,
which brings you back to where you were 
working with your text. Pressing Ô+Return or
Ctrl+Enter again closes the Quick Apply panel.
For users who are working on layouts from their
keyboards — perhaps a layout artist who’s
working on a notebook while commuting —
Quick Apply can be handy because you can
switch to it, apply the style, and return to your
text without touching the mouse.
InDesign CS3 adds a lot more attributes to the
Quick Apply panel, so it can quickly get over-
whelming. (InDesign CS2 just had styles in this
panel.) To remove attributes you likely will never
use in this panel — such as scripts and menu
customizations — choose the unnamed pop-up
menu at the top of the panel, and deselect
unwanted attributes (the check marks indicate
attributes that will display). (You can also
choose what attributes display in the Quick
Apply panel by choosing Customize from its
flyout menu.)

Using style groups
To help you find the desired style in documents that have dozens of them,
InDesign lets you create style groups, which create a folder in the styles
panel’s style list that you can open and close as desired. To create a group,
choose New Style Group from the panel’s flyout menu or click the Create New
Style Group iconic button (folder icon) on the bottom of the panel. Enter a
name in the dialog box that appears and click OK.
When working with style groups (which have a folder icon to the left of their
names in the panel list), you have several options to add styles:
 You can drag any desired styles into the group.
 You can copy a selected style to the group by choosing Copy to Group
and then selecting the target group in the dialog box that appears.
 If multiple styles are selected, you can create a group and move them into
it in one fell swoop by choosing New Group from Styles in the flyout menu.
(Note that this option is grayed out if any of the predefined styles —
[None] and either [Basic Paragraph] or [Basic Character] — are selected.)
To quickly open all groups, choose Open All Groups in the panel’s flyout
menu. To quickly close them all, choose Close All Groups.
Other management options
The styles panels’ flyout menus have several other options to manage your
styles:
 Duplicate Style copies the currently selected style, so you can work on
the copy.
 Delete Style — no surprise! — deletes selected styles.
Figure 14-4:
The Load
Styles
dialog box.
232
Part IV: Text Essentials 

 Select All Unused selects all styles not used in the document, so you can
delete them all at once with the Delete Style menu option — part of
keeping your document neat and tidy.
 Sort by Name alphabetizes the list of style names. (You can change the
order of style names by dragging them within the list.)
Applying Styles
There are some subtle differences between applying paragraph styles and
character styles, so I’ll cover those particulars a little later in this section.
But two techniques work the same for both types of style:
 If your text selection uses more than one paragraph style or more than
one character style, the styles panel will display the text (Mixed) at the
upper left to let you know that.
 InDesign has a neat new capability that lets you apply multiple styles at
once to selected text. First, define the various styles, and be sure that
each style has a different style selected in the Next Style pop-up menu
in the Paragraph Style Options or New Paragraph Style dialog boxes.
For example, if you have Headline, Byline, and Body Copy styles, make
sure that Headline has Byline selected in Next Style and that Byline has
Body Copy selected in Next Style. Then highlight all the text that uses
this sequence of styles. Now Control+click or right-click Headline and
select Apply “Headline” Then Next Style from the contextual menu.
InDesign applies Headline to the first paragraph, Byline to the second
paragraph, and Body Copy to the rest.
Paragraph particulars
To apply a paragraph style, just click within a paragraph or highlight text in a
range of paragraphs and then click the style name in the Paragraph Styles
panel or press its keyboard shortcut. (Windows users must make sure Num
Lock is on when using shortcuts for styles.)
When you apply a style to selected paragraphs, all local formats and applied
character styles are retained. All other formats are replaced by those of the
applied style. If you want to override those attributes, choose Clear Overrides
from the Paragraph Styles panel’s flyout menu or hold the Option or Alt key
when clicking the style name in the panel.
If you want to remove a style from a paragraph, so it’s not changed if the style
is later changed, choose Break Link to Style from the flyout menu. The upper
left of the panel will display the text (No Style).
233
Chapter 14: The Styles of Text

Character characteristics
To apply a character style, just highlight text and then click the style name in
the Character Styles panel or press its keyboard shortcut. (Windows users
must make sure Num Lock is on when using shortcuts for styles.)
If you want to remove a style from a text selection so that it’s not changed
if the character style is later changed, choose Break Link to Style from the
flyout menu or simply apply the [None] style. Note that if you later apply a
paragraph style to text with [None] character style, the text will take on the
paragraph style’s formatting rather than retaining its local formatting.

Fine-Tuning Paragraph Details
In This Chapter
 Understanding paragraph fundamentals
 Changing basic and advanced paragraph formats
 Applying bullets and numbering
 Working with hyphenation and justification
 Adding ruling lines to paragraphs
P
aragraphs are more than lines of text; they are chunks of information
that themselves help convey meaning by organizing that information
into related bits. Various types of paragraph formatting let you both make
those chunks clearly distinguishable from each other and highlight certain
chunks, such as lists or long quotes, from others.
This chapter explains what you need to know about formatting paragraphs,
from setting indents and alignment — the two most commonly used para-
graph attributes.
Applying Paragraph Formats
InDesign provides three ways to apply paragraph formats:
 Use the controls in the Paragraph panel, shown in Figure 15-1, or their
keyboard shortcuts. This method is great for working on individual
paragraphs, although it’s not the best method when working with lots
of paragraphs you want to have the same formatting. There are three
ways to open the Paragraph panel: Choose Type➪Paragraph, choose
Window➪Type & Tables➪Paragraph, or press Option+Ô+T or Ctrl+Alt+T.
 Use the controls in the Control panel (be sure that the Type tool is
active and that the ¶ iconic button is selected in the panel to display
paragraph-oriented functions). These controls mirror those in the

Paragraph panel, and using them instead of the Paragraph panel can
reduce screen clutter. If the Control panel is not visible (it almost always
is), display it by choosing Window➪Control or pressing Option+Ô+6 or
Ctrl+Alt+6.
 Create and apply paragraph styles, as covered in Chapter 14. Paragraph
styles let you apply consistent formatting — and easily change it to all
affected paragraphs — throughout your document.
Whichever method you use — and you’ll use them all — the types of format-
ting available to you are the same.
The Paragraph panel and Control panel provide access to most of InDesign’s
paragraph-formatting options. Also, several of the options have keyboard
shortcuts, as shown in the menus. But to set tabs, you must open the Tabs
panel, as covered in Chapter 20.
Figure 15-1 shows the Paragraph panel. If you choose Hide Options from the
flyout menu, the Space Before, Space After, Drop Cap Number of Lines, Drop
Cap Number of Characters, Hyphenate, and Align/Do Not Align to Baseline
Grid controls are not displayed. You can use the double-arrow iconic button
to the left of the panel name to toggle among showing the panel title, the
basic options, and all options.

Part IV: Text Essentials 

If you have a smallish monitor, set at 1024 by 768 pixels — the norm for a 17-
inch display — the Paragraph and Paragraph Styles panels are shoved to the
bottom of the panel dock, and, when they’re selected, the only thing you’ll
see is their panel tab and flyout menu icon. You have a few choices: Shorten
other panel groups in the dock to make room for them, remove other panel
groups to make room for them, or drag them out of the dock and make them
floating.
Specifying Alignment and Indents
Alignment and indents give paragraphs their fundamental appearance.
Indentation helps readers visually separate paragraphs — the indent acts as
the separator, like the blank lines used to separate paragraphs in typewritten
documents — while alignment provides visual texture.
Controlling alignment
The alignment buttons at the top of the Paragraph panel control how a
selected paragraph begins and ends relative to the left and right margins. To
apply a paragraph alignment to selected paragraphs, click one of the buttons.
You can also use the keyboard shortcuts described in the following list.
Here’s a description of each alignment option (the icons themselves illustrate
what they do):
 Align Left (Shift+Ô+L or Ctrl+Shift+L): This alignment places the left
edge of every line at the left margin (the margin can be the frame edge,
frame inset, left indent, or column edge) and fits as many words (or syl-
lables, if the hyphenation is turned on) on the line as possible. In left-
aligned paragraphs, the right margin is said to be ragged because the
leftover space at the right end of each line differs from line to line and
produces a ragged edge.
 Align Center (Shift+Ô+C or Ctrl+Shift+C): This alignment makes both
the left and right edges of the paragraphs equally ragged.
 Align Right (Shift+Ô+R or Ctrl+Shift+R): This is a mirror opposite of
Align Left. The right edge is straight; the left edge is ragged.
 Justify, Last Line Aligned Left (Shift+Ô+J or Ctrl+Shift+J): In justified
text, the left and right ends of each line are flush with the margins.
(There’s more about justification later in this chapter.) Justified text is
nearly always hyphenated — if you don’t hyphenate justified text, spac-
ing between letters and words is very inconsistent. Aligning the last line
flush left is the traditional way of ending a paragraph.
237
Chapter 15: Fine-Tuning Paragraph Details

 Justify, Last Line Aligned Center: This produces justified text with the
last line centered.
 Justify, Last Line Aligned Right: This produces justified text with the
last line aligned to the right.
 Justify All Lines (Shift+Ô+F or Ctrl+Shift+F): This produces justified text
with the last line forcibly justified. This option can produce last lines
that are very widely spaced. The fewer the number of characters on the
last line, the greater the spacing.
The previous three alignment options are rarely used, and for good
reason. People expect justified text to have the last line aligned left; the
space at the end of the line marks the end of the paragraph. By changing
the position of that last line, you can confuse your reader.
 Align Toward Spine: Essentially, this option automatically creates right-
aligned text on left-hand pages and left-aligned text on right-hand pages.
InDesign chooses a left or right alignment based on the location of the
spine in a facing-pages document.
 Align Away from Spine: This option is the same as Align Toward Spine
except that the alignment is reversed: Text aligns to the left on left-hand
pages and to the right on right-hand pages.
When creating paragraph styles, all the above controls are available in the
Indents and Spacing pane of the New Paragraph Styles dialog box.
Adjusting indent controls
The indent controls in the Paragraph panel let you both move the edges of
paragraphs away from the left and/or right margins and indent the first line.
Your options are as follows:
 Left Indent: Moves the left edge of selected paragraphs away from the
left margin by the amount you specify in the field. You can also click the
up and down arrows. Each click increases the value by 1 point; holding
down the Shift while clicking increases the increment to 1 pica.
 Right Indent: Moves the right edge of selected paragraphs away from
the right margin by the amount you specify in the field. You can also use
the up and down arrows.
 First-Line Left Indent: Moves the left edge of the first line of selected
paragraphs away from the left margin by the amount you specify in the
field. You can also click the up and down arrows to adjust the indenta-
tion. The value in the First-Line Left Indent field is added to any Left
Indent value. Using a tab or spaces to indent the first line of a paragraph,
which is what was done in the age of typewriters, is usually not a good
idea. You’re better off specifying a First-Line Left Indent.
238
Part IV: Text Essentials 

 Last-Line Right Indent: Moves the right edge of the last line of selected
paragraphs away from the right margin by the amount you specify in the
field. You can also click the up and down arrows.
When creating paragraph styles, all the above controls are available in the
Indents and Spacing pane of the New Paragraph Styles dialog box.
Inserting space between paragraphs
To format a lengthy chunk of text with multiple paragraphs, you can indicate
a new paragraph by indenting the paragraph’s first line (by specifying a First-
Line Left Indent value, as covered earlier). Or you can insert some extra
space between the new paragraph and the preceding one. Although no rule
states that you can’t use both of these spacing methods, it’s a good idea to
use one or the other — not both:
 To insert space before selected paragraphs, enter a value in the Space
Before field in the Paragraph panel or Control panel. You can also use
the up and down arrow buttons; each click increases the value by 
1 point and holding down Shift key increases the increment to 1 pica.
 The Space After field works the same as the Space Before field but
inserts space below selected paragraphs. If you use Space Before to
space paragraphs, you won’t need to use Space After, and vice versa;
combining both can be confusing.
What you don’t want to do is insert extra paragraph returns between para-
graphs. Doing so makes it harder to ensure that columns begin with text (as
opposed to blank lines).
Controlling space between lines
Leading (pronounced “ledding”) is the space between lines of text within a
paragraph. Even though leading is traditionally an attribute of the paragraph,
InDesign treats it as a character format, which you specify by using the
Leading control in the Character panel or Control panel.
To change this character-oriented approach to affect entire paragraphs,
select the Apply Leading to Entire Paragraphs option in the Type pane of the
Preferences dialog box (choose InDesign➪Preferences➪Type or press Ô+K
on the Mac, or choose Edit➪Preferences➪Type or press Ctrl+K in Windows).
Another way to control space between lines of text is to use baseline grids, as
described in Chapter 11. Essentially, a baseline grid overrides the leading
specified for paragraphs — you choose whether it overrides the spacing of
every line in the paragraph or just the first line. To align to baseline grids,
239
Chapter 15: Fine-Tuning Paragraph Details

you must click the Align to Baseline iconic button in the Paragraph panel (the
rightmost iconic button on the bottom of the panel) for the selected para-
graphs. To prevent such locking to the baseline, click the Do Not Align to
Baseline iconic button to its immediate left. These same buttons also exist on
the right side of the Control panel.
Controlling where paragraphs break
InDesign’s Keep Options feature lets you prevent widows and orphans; it also
lets you keep paragraphs together when they would otherwise be broken at
the bottom of a column. A widow is the last line of a paragraph that falls at
the top of a column. (The poor thing has been cut off from the rest of the
family, the last survivor.) An orphan is the first line of a paragraph that falls
at the bottom of a column. (It, too, has become separated from its family, the
only survivor.)
When you choose Keep Options from the Paragraph panel’s flyout menu, the
Keep Options dialog box, shown in Figure 15-2, is displayed.
The Keep Options dialog box holds several options for how paragraphs are
managed as text breaks across columns and pages:
 Keep with Next Lines: This option applies to two consecutive para-
graphs and controls the number of lines of the second paragraph that
must stay with the first paragraph if a column or page break occurs
within the second paragraph.
 Keep Lines Together: If you click this check box, it will prevent para-
graphs from breaking. When this box is checked, the two radio buttons
below it become available. The radio buttons present an either/or choice.
One must be selected; At Start/End of Paragraph is selected by default.

Part IV: Text Essentials 

 All Lines in Paragraph: This option prevents a paragraph from being
broken at the end of a column or page. When a column or page break
occurs within a paragraph to which this setting has been applied, the
entire paragraph moves to the next column or page.
 At Start/End of Paragraph: Select this check box to control widows and
orphans. When this button is selected, the two fields below it become
available:
• Start x Lines: This field controls orphans. The value you enter is
the minimum number of lines at the beginning of a paragraph that
must be placed at the bottom of a column when a paragraph is
split by a column ending.
• End x Lines: This field controls widows. The value you enter is the
minimum number of lines at the end of a paragraph that must be
placed at the top of a column when a paragraph is split by a
column ending.
 Start Paragraph: From this pop-up menu, choose Anywhere to let the
paragraph begin where it would fall naturally in the sequence of text
(no forced break). Choose In Next Column to force a paragraph to begin
in the next column; choose In Next Frame to make it begin in the next
frame in the story chain; choose On Next Page to force a paragraph to
begin on the next page (such as for chapter headings). Your other
choices are similar: On Next Odd Page and On Next Even Page.
When creating paragraph styles, all the above controls are available in the
Keep Options pane of the New Paragraph Styles dialog box.
Adding Drop Caps
Drop caps are enlarged capital letters that are often used to embellish para-
graphs (usually the first paragraph of a chapter or story) and to draw atten-
tion to paragraphs. In the Paragraph panel or Control panel, InDesign lets you
specify the number of letters you want to include in a drop cap and the
number of lines you want to drop them down into.
To add one or more drop caps to selected paragraphs, enter a number in the
Drop Cap Number of Characters field in the Paragraph panel or Control
panel. The number you enter determines how many characters in a selected
paragraph will be made into drop caps. To specify the number of lines a drop
cap will extend into a paragraph (and therefore the height of the drop cap),
enter a number in the Drop Cap Number of Lines field.
241
Chapter 15: Fine-Tuning Paragraph Details

After you create a drop cap, you can modify it by highlighting it and changing
any of its character formats — font, size, color, and so on — by using the
Character panel or Control panel, as well as other panes such as Stroke and
Swatches. Even better: Apply a character style to it that has all the desired
attributes stored in one place. Figure 15-3 shows two examples of drop caps.
When creating paragraph styles, the above controls are available in the Drop
Caps and Nested Styles pane of the New Paragraph Styles dialog box. (See
Chapter 14 for details on nested styles.)
Controlling Hyphenation
and Justification
Hyphenation is the placement of hyphens between syllables in words that
won’t fit at the end of a line of text. A hyphen is a signal to the reader that the
word continues on the next line. InDesign gives you the option to turn para-
graph hyphenation on or off. If you choose to hyphenate, you can customize
the settings that determine when and where hyphens are inserted.
Justification is the addition or removal of space between words and/or letters
that produces the flush-left/flush-right appearance of justified paragraphs.
InDesign’s justification controls let you specify how space is added or

Part IV: Text Essentials 

removed when paragraphs are justified. If you justify paragraphs, you almost
certainly want to hyphenate them, too. If you opt for left-aligned paragraphs,
whether to hyphenate is a personal choice.
InDesign offers both manual and automatic hyphenation.
Manual hyphenation
To break a particular word in a specific place, you can place a discretionary
hyphen in the word. If the word won’t entirely fit at the end of a line in a
hyphenated paragraph, InDesign will use the discretionary hyphen to split
the word if the part of the word before the hyphen fits on the line. To insert a
discretionary hyphen, use the shortcut Shift+Ô+– (hyphen) or Ctrl+Shift+–
(hyphen) in the text where you want the hyphen to appear.
If a word has a discretionary hyphen, and hyphenation is necessary, InDesign
breaks the word only at that point. But you can place multiple discretionary
hyphens within a single word. If a word needs to be hyphenated, InDesign will
use the hyphenation point that produces the best results.
You can prevent a particular word from being hyphenated either by placing a
discretionary hyphen in front of the first letter or by highlighting the word
and choosing No Break from the flyout menu of the Control panel or
Character panel. (You need to select the A iconic button in the Control panel
to get this option in its flyout menu.) But be careful: If you select more than a
line’s width of text and apply No Break, InDesign will not know what to do,
and so it won’t display the rest of the story.
To prevent hyphenation for an entire paragraph, click anywhere inside of it
and uncheck Hyphenate from the Paragraph panel or Control panel (be sure
the ¶ button is selected in the Control panel).
Automatic hyphenation
To have InDesign automatically hyphenate selected paragraphs, all you have
to do is check the Hyphenate check box in the Paragraph panel or Control
panel. (A reminder that, in the Paragraph panel, the Hyphenate check box is
displayed only if you choose Show Options from the flyout menu.)
You can control how InDesign actually performs the hyphenation via the
Hyphenation option in the flyout menu. When you choose Hyphenation, the
Hyphenation Settings dialog box, shown in Figure 15-4, appears.
243
Chapter 15: Fine-Tuning Paragraph Details

The options in the Hyphenation Settings dialog box include
 Hyphenate: This is a duplicate of the Hyphenate check box in the
Paragraph panel and Control panel. If you didn’t check it before opening
the Hyphenation Settings dialog box, you can check it here.
 Words with at Least x Letters: This is where you specify the number of
letters in the shortest word you want to hyphenate.
 After First x Letters: In this field, enter the minimum number of charac-
ters that can precede a hyphen.
 Before Last x Letters: The number entered in this field determines the
minimum number of characters that can follow a hyphen.
 Hyphen Limit: x Hyphens: In this field, you specify the number of con-
secutive lines that can be hyphenated. Several consecutive hyphens pro-
duce an awkward, ladder-like look, so consider entering a small number,
such as 2 or 3, in this field.
 Hyphenation Zone: The entry in this field applies only to nonjustified
text and only when the Adobe Single-Line Composer option is selected
(in the Paragraph panel’s flyout menu). A hyphenation point must fall
within the distance specified in this field in relation to the right margin
in order to be used. Acceptable hyphenation points that do not fall
within the specified hyphenation zone are ignored. You can also use the
Better Spacing/Fewer Hyphens slider below the field to pick a value
rather than entering a value in the Hyphenation Zone field.
 Hyphenate Capitalized Words: If you check this box, InDesign will
hyphenate, when necessary, capitalized words. If you don’t check this
box, a capitalized word that would otherwise be hyphenated will get
bumped to the next line, which may cause excessive spacing in the
previous line.
Figure 15-4:
The
Hyphena-
tion Settings
dialog box.
244
Part IV: Text Essentials 

 Hyphenate Last Word: Check this box to allow InDesign to break the last
word in a paragraph. Otherwise, InDesign moves the entire word to the
last line and spaces the preceding text as necessary.
 Hyphenate Across Column: Check this box to let text hyphenate at the
end of a column.
When creating paragraph styles, all the above controls are available in the
Hyphenation pane of the New Paragraph Styles dialog box — except for the
composer setting, covered in the next sections.
Controlling justification
To control how justification is achieved, you can
 Condense or expand the width of spaces between words.
 Add or remove space between letters.
 Condense or expand the width of characters.
The options in the Justification dialog box, shown in Figure 15-5, let you spec-
ify the degree to which InDesign will adjust normal word spaces, character
spacing, and character width to achieve justification. Access this dialog box
via the flyout menu in the Control panel or in the Paragraph panel, or by
pressing Option+Shift+Ô+J or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+J. When specifying values in the
Justification dialog box, Minimum values must be smaller than Desired
values, which in turn must be smaller than Maximum values.
The Justification dialog box lets you specify the following options:
 Word Spacing: Enter the percentage of a character that you want to use
whenever possible in the Desired field. (The default value is 100%, which
uses a font’s built-in width.) Enter the minimum acceptable percentage
in the Minimum field; enter the maximum acceptable percentage in the
Maximum field. The smallest value you can enter is 0%; the largest is
1000%.
Figure 15-5:
The
Justification
dialog box.
245
Chapter 15: Fine-Tuning Paragraph Details

 Letter Spacing: The default value of 0% in this field uses a font’s built-in
letter spacing. In the Desired field, enter a positive value to add space
(in increments of 1% of an en space) between all letter pairs; enter a neg-
ative value to remove space. Enter the minimum acceptable percentage
in the Minimum field; enter the maximum acceptable percentage in the
Maximum field.
 Glyph Scaling: The default value of 100% uses a character’s normal
width. In the Desired field, enter a positive value to expand all character
widths; enter a negative value to condense character widths. Enter the
minimum acceptable percentage in the Minimum field and the maximum
acceptable percentage in the Maximum field. If you do apply glyph scal-
ing, it’s best to keep it to a range of 97 to 103 percent at most.
If you use the Adobe Paragraph Composer option (explained in the following
section) for justified paragraphs, specifying a narrow range between minimum
and maximum Word Spacing, Letter Spacing, and Glyph Scaling will generally
produce good-looking results. However, if you choose the Adobe Single-Line
Composer option, a broader range between Minimum and Maximum gives the
composer more leeway in spacing words and letters and hyphenating words
and can produce better-looking results. The best way to find out what values
work best is to experiment with several settings. Print out hard copies and let
your eyes decide which values produce the best results.
When creating paragraph styles, all the above controls are available in the
Justification pane of the New Paragraph Styles dialog box.
Composing text
The Paragraph panel’s flyout menu offers two options for implementing the
hyphenation and justification settings you establish: the Adobe Single-Line
Composer and the Adobe Paragraph Composer. (These options are also avail-
able in the Justification dialog box, covered in the previous section.)
Adobe Single-Line Composer
In single-line composition, hyphenation, and justification settings are applied
to each line in a paragraph, one line at a time. The effect of modifying the
spacing of one line on the lines above and below it is not considered in single-
line composition, so it can cause poor spacing.
Adobe Paragraph Composer
InDesign’s Adobe Paragraph Composer is selected by default. It takes a
broader approach to composition than the Adobe Single-Line Composer by
looking at the entire paragraph at once. If a poorly spaced line can be fixed
by adjusting the spacing of a previous line, the Adobe Paragraph Composer
will reflow the previous line.
246
Part IV: Text Essentials 

The Adobe Paragraph Composer is more sophisticated than the Single-Line
Composer, offering better overall spacing because it will sacrifice optimal
spacing a bit on one line to prevent really bad spacing on another, something
the single-line method does not do.
Ruling Your Paragraphs
If you want to place a horizontal line within text so that the line moves with
the text when editing causes the text to reflow — an often effective highlight-
ing device — you need to create a paragraph rule. A paragraph rule looks
much like a line created with the line tool but behaves like a text character.
Here’s how to create paragraph rules:
1. Select the paragraphs to which you want to apply a rule above and/or
a rule below and then choose Paragraph Rules from the Paragraph
panel’s or Control panel’s flyout menu; alternatively, you can use the
shortcut Option+Ô+J or Ctrl+Alt+J.
You can also specify rules as part of a paragraph style. The Paragraph
Rules dialog box, shown in Figure 15-6, is displayed.
2. Choose Rule Above or Rule Below and then click Rule On.
To add rules both above and below, click Rule On for both options and
specify their settings separately. To see the rule while you create it,
select the Preview option.
3. Choose a predefined thickness from the Weight pop-up menu or enter
a value in the Weight field.
4. Choose a rule type from the Type pop-up menu.
You can choose from 17 types, including dashed, striped, dotted, and
wavy lines.
Figure 15-6:
The
Paragraph
Rules
dialog box.
247
Chapter 15: Fine-Tuning Paragraph Details

5. Choose a color for the rule from the Color pop-up menu. This menu lists
the colors displayed in the Swatches panel (Window➪Swatches or F5).
6. From the Width pop-up menu, choose Column to have the rule extend
from the left edge of the column to the right edge of the column;
choose Text to have the rule extend from the left edge of the frame or
column to the right.
7. To indent the rule from the left and/or right edges, enter values in the
Left Indent and/or Right Indent fields.
8. Control the vertical position of the rule by entering a value in the
Offset field.
For a rule above, the offset value is measured upward from the baseline
of the first line in a paragraph to the bottom of the rule; for a rule below,
the offset is measured downward from the baseline of the last line in a
paragraph to the top of the rule.
9. Check the Overprint Stroke box if you want to print a rule on top of
any underlying colors.
This ensures that any misregistration during printing will not result in
white areas around the rule where the paper shows through. There’s a
similar Overprint Gap check box for lines that have a Gap Color.
10. To ensure that a rule over a paragraph at the top of a frame displays
within the frame, check the Keep in Frame option.
11. Click OK to close the dialog box, implement your changes, and return
to the document.
To remove a paragraph rule, click in the paragraph to which the rule is
applied, choose Paragraph Rules from the Paragraph panel’s flyout menu,
uncheck the Rule On box, and then click OK.
When creating paragraph styles, all the above controls are available in the
Paragraph Rules pane of the New Paragraph Styles dialog box.

hen you create documents, you have lots of opportunities to make
decisions about how the text appears. With its comprehensive set of
character-formatting tools, InDesign lets you change the look of type so it can
precisely match the communication needs of your publications. You can con-
trol not just the font and size of type, but also many other variations.
Decisions about type matter. A document relies on good typography to allow
others to easily read and understand it. The appearance of type supports the
message you’re conveying, and doing a good job of character formatting is
worth your time.
Specifying Character Formats
InDesign lets you modify the appearance of highlighted characters or
selected paragraphs with the following options:
 Character panel: Highlight the text and open the Character panel
(Type➪Character, or Ô+T or Ctrl+T), which is shown in Figure 16-1. 
(You can also choose Window➪Type & Tools➪Character.) Be sure Show
Options is visible in the flyout menu in order to see all the possible
options. You can also use the double-arrow iconic button to the left of
the panel name to toggle among showing the panel title, the basic
options, and all options.

The Character panel provides access to most of InDesign’s character 
formatting options. Three of the options — Font Family, Font Style, and
Font Size — are also available via the Type menu, and several options
have keyboard shortcuts.
 Paragraph panel: Select a paragraph and open the Paragraph panel
(Type➪Paragraph, or Option+Ô+T or Ctrl+Alt+T). Chapter 15 covers
these settings in detail.
 Control panel: The Control panel offers all the formatting options of the
Character panel plus others. If the Control panel doesn’t show all the
character formatting options, select the text and then click the A iconic
button on the panel. If the Control panel is not visible (it almost always
is), display it by choosing Window➪Control or pressing Option+Ô+6 or
Ctrl+Alt+6.
To change the default character formats — the settings that InDesign will use
when you type text into an empty frame — make changes in the Character
panel or Control panel when no text is selected or when the text-insertion
cursor isn’t flashing. That’ll save you the hassle of having to reformat new
text.

Part IV: Text Essentials 

You can choose to apply character formats to highlighted text in two ways:
 Create and apply character styles. Character styles offer an important
advantage: A character style’s settings are stored, so you can apply the
exact same settings easily to other text. When you change a character
style’s settings, any text based on that style is automatically changed to
reflect the new settings. (Chapter 14 covers styles in detail.)
 Use the local controls in the Character panel, the Control panel, the
Type menu, or their keyboard shortcuts, which I cover in the upcoming
sections.
Even when you do use character styles, you’ll probably also do some
local formatting from time to time. For example, you would probably use
the Character panel to format the type on the opening spread of a fea-
ture magazine article, and then use character styles to quickly format
the remainder of the article.
If you have a smallish monitor, set at 1024 by 768 pixels — the norm for a 
17-inch display — the Character and Character Styles panels are shoved to
the bottom of the panel dock, and, when they’re selected, the only thing
you’ll see is their panel tab and flyout menu icon. You have a few choices:
Shorten other panel groups in the dock to make room for them, remove other
panel groups to make room for them, or drag them out of the dock and make
them floating.
Modifying Font, Type Style, and Size
Many people use typographic terms — font, face, typeface, font family, and
type style — inconsistently. Which terms you use doesn’t matter as long as
you make yourself understood, but I recommend becoming familiar with the
font-related terms in InDesign’s menus and panels:
 Font or typeface: A collection of characters — including letters, 
numbers, and special characters — that share the same overall 
appearance, including stroke width, weight, angle, and style.
For example, Helvetica Regular and Adobe Garamond Semibold Italic are
well-known fonts.
 Font family: A collection of several fonts that share the same general
appearance but differ in stroke width, weight, and/or stroke angle.
For example, Helvetica and Adobe Garamond are font families.
251
Chapter 16: Finessing Character Details

 Font style: Each of the fonts that make up a font family. When you
choose a font family from the Character panel’s Font Family menu,
InDesign displays the family’s font style variations — what most of the
design world calls type styles — in the accompanying Font Style pop-up
menu.
For example, Regular and Semibold Italic are examples of font styles.
Changing font family and font style
When you change from one font to another in InDesign, you can choose a
new font family and font style independently in the Character panel. For
example, changing from Arial Bold to Times Bold or from Arial Regular to
Berthold Baskerville Regular is a simple change of font family (Arial to
Berthold Baskerville). However, if you switch from, say, Bookman Light to
Century Schoolbook Bold Italic, you’re changing both family and style
(Bookman to Century, then Light to Bold Italic).
InDesign can display previews of fonts when you select fonts via the Control
panel, various text-oriented panels, and the Type menu. You turn on this
capability in the Type pane of the Preferences dialog box (choose InDesign➪
Preferences➪Type or press Ô+K on the Mac, or choose Edit➪Preferences➪
Type or press Ctrl+K in Windows). But doing so makes your menus huge,
often so much that they are unwieldy to use. Although it can help you get
familiar with your fonts, its unwieldy nature may not be worth that benefit.
Only you can decide, but if you do use it, I recommend keeping the preview
size small to limit its size.
Whether you use the Control panel or Character panel, you can choose
between two methods for changing the font family:
 Choose the Font Family menu, and then select a name from the list of
available font families.
 Place the cursor in front of or highlight the font name displayed in the
Font Family field, type the first few letters of the font family you want to
apply, and then press Return or Enter. For example, entering Cas selects
Caslon (if it’s available on your computer).
If you choose only a font family when font styles are available in an accompa-
nying submenu, no changes are applied to the selected text. So be sure to
select a font style from the submenu.
When creating character styles, the above controls are available in the Basic
Character Formats pane of the New Character Styles and New Paragraph
Styles dialog boxes.
252
Part IV: Text Essentials 

Changing type size
You can be very precise with type sizes (what InDesign calls font size).
InDesign supports sizes from 0.1 point to 1,296 points (108 inches) in incre-
ments as fine as 0.001 point. Of course, you want to use good judgment when
choosing type sizes. For example, headlines should be larger than subheads,
which in turn are larger than body text, which is larger than photo credits,
and so on.
Change the type size of highlighted text with the following methods:
 Choose Type➪Size, and then choose one of the predefined sizes listed in
the Size submenu. If you choose Other from the submenu, the Font Size
field is highlighted in the Character panel. Enter a custom size, and then
press Return or Enter.
 Use the Character panel or Control panel:
• Choose one of the predefined sizes from the Font Size menu.
• Highlight the currently applied type size displayed in the accompa-
nying editable field, enter a new size, and then press Return or
Enter.
• Make sure the Font Size field is selected, and then use the up and
down arrow keys to increase or decrease the size in 1-point incre-
ments. Pressing Shift multiplies the increment to 10.
 Control+click or right-click a text selection, and then choose a size from
the Size submenu. If you choose Other from the submenu, the Font Size
field is highlighted in the Character panel. Enter a custom size, and then
press Return or Enter.
If text is highlighted and the Font Size field is empty, more than one type size is
used in the selected text.
When creating character styles, the Font Size control is available in the Basic
Character Formats pane of the New Character Styles dialog box.
Using Other Character Formats
In the Control panel, you can adjust other character formats, including all
caps, small caps, superscript, subscript, underline, strikethrough, kerning,
tracking, horizontal and vertical scale, baseline shift, skew, font style, and lan-
guage. Through the flyout menu, you can also set ligatures, modify underline
253
Chapter 16: Finessing Character Details

and strikethrough settings, control whether text may break (be hyphenated),
select its case (such as all caps and small caps), and select OpenType fea-
tures. (OpenType fonts can have a dozen kinds of special formatting. These
are expert features, so I don’t get into the details here, but feel free to explore
the options for any OpenType fonts you have.)
In the Character panel, you can adjust kerning, tracking, horizontal and verti-
cal scale, baseline shift, skew, and language. Through its flyout menu (refer to
Figure 16-1), you can also set all caps, small caps, superscript, subscript,
underline, strikethrough, ligatures, and underline and strikethrough settings,
as well as control whether text may break (be hyphenated) and select
OpenType features. (InDesign also lets you create custom underlines and
strikethroughs, as described in Chapter 17.)
When creating character styles, the kerning, tracking, subscript, superscript,
case, ligature, underlining, break, and strikethrough controls are available in
the Basic Character Formats pane of the New Character Styles and New
Paragraph Styles dialog boxes. The scale, baseline shift, skew, and language
controls are in the Advanced Character Formats pane. OpenType controls 
are in the OpenType Features pane. Custom underline and strikethrough
options, covered in Chapter 17, are available in the Underline Options and
Strikethrough Options panes, respectively.
You must choose Show Options from the Character panel’s flyout menu to
display the Vertical Scale, Horizontal Scale, Baseline Shift, Skew, and
Language options in the panel.
The Control panel has the same functions as the Character panel, except the
all caps, small caps, superscript, subscript, underline, and strikethrough
options are in the panel itself rather than in its flyout menu.
Figure 16-2 shows the various effects in action. In its top row, InDesign has 
a different font style applied, incredible has been scaled horizontally, and 
control is in all caps, while over has had each letter’s baseline shifted by a 
different amount. In the middle row, the word text has been skewed, the word
with is in small caps, a gradient and underline are applied to typographic, a
custom underline has been applied to capabilities, and the word formatting
has been vertically scaled. In the bottom row, compare the baseline shifts in
the top row to the true superscript and subscript following the words most
and people. The word never has a custom strikethrough applied, while even
uses a standard one. The word heard has a colored stroke applied and a fill of
white.
254
Part IV: Text Essentials 

Horizontal and Vertical Scale options
InDesign’s Horizontal Scale option lets you condense and expand type by
squeezing or stretching characters. Similarly, the Vertical Scale option lets
you shrink or stretch type vertically.
Typographers tend to agree that excessive scaling should be avoided. If you
need to make text bigger or smaller, your best bet is to adjust font size; if you
need to squeeze or stretch a range of text a bit, use InDesign’s kerning and
tracking controls (covered later in this chapter) because the letter forms
aren’t modified — only the space between letters changes when you kern or
track text.
Unscaled text has a horizontal and vertical scale value of 100 percent. You
can apply scaling values between 1 percent and 1,000 percent. If you apply
equal horizontal and vertical scale values, you’re making the original text
proportionally larger or smaller. In this case, changing font size is a simpler
solution.
To change the scale of highlighted text, enter new values in the Horizontal
and/or Vertical Scale fields in the Character panel or Control panel. If a value
is highlighted in the Horizontal Scale or Vertical Scale field, you can also use
the up and down arrow keys to increase and decrease the scaling in 1-percent
increments; press Shift to increase or decrease in 10-percent increments.
Baseline shift
The baseline is an invisible horizontal line on which a line of characters rests.
The bottom of each letter sits on the baseline (except descenders, such as in
y, p, q, j, and g). When you perform a baseline shift, you move highlighted 
text above or below its baseline. This feature is useful for carefully placing
such characters as trademark and copyright symbols and for creating
custom fractions.

255
Chapter 16: Finessing Character Details

To baseline-shift highlighted text, enter new values in the Baseline Shift field
in the Character panel or Control panel. You can also use the up and down
arrow keys to increase the baseline shift in 1-point increments, or press Shift
with the arrow keys to increase or decrease it in 10-point increments.
Skew (false italic)
For fonts that don’t have an italic type style, InDesign provides the option to
skew, or slant, text to create an artificial italic variation of any font. Like hori-
zontal and vertical text scaling, skewing is a clunky way of creating italic-
looking text. Use this feature to create special typographic effects, as shown
in Figure 16-3, or in situations where a true italic style is not available. Skewing
works better for sans-serif typefaces than for serif typefaces because the
characters are simpler and have fewer embellishments that can get oddly 
distorted when skewed.
To skew highlighted text, you have three options:
 Enter an angle value between –85 and 85 in the Skew field in the
Character panel or Control panel. Positive values slant text to the left;
negative values slant text to the right.
 Press the accompanying up/down arrow keys when the cursor is in the
Skew field to skew text in 1-degree increments. Pressing the Shift key
with an arrow key changes the increment 4 degrees.
 You can also skew all the text in a text frame using the Shear tool or by
changing the value in the Shear X Angle field in the Control panel after
selecting the frame. Slanting text by shearing a text frame does not affect
the skew angle of the text. You can specify a skew angle for highlighted
text independently from the frame’s shear angle.

Part IV: Text Essentials 

Capitalization options
When you choose All Caps, the uppercase version of all highlighted charac-
ters is used: Lowercase letters are converted to uppercase, and uppercase
letters remain unchanged.
Similarly, the Small Caps option affects just lowercase letters. When you
choose Small Caps, InDesign automatically uses the Small Caps font style if
one is available for the font family (few font families include this style). If a
Small Caps type style is not available, InDesign generates small caps from
uppercase letters using the scale percentage specified in the Advanced 
Type pane of the Preferences dialog box (choose InDesign➪Preferences➪
Advanced Type or press Ô+K on the Mac, or choose Edit➪Preferences➪
Advanced Type or press Ctrl+K in Windows). The default scale value used 
to generate small caps text is 70% (of uppercase letters).
Another handy way to change the case of text is to highlight the text and then
choose Type➪Change Case, and then select from the appropriate submenu
option: Uppercase, Lowercase, Title Case, and Sentence Case. Title Case 
capitalizes the first letter in each word, whereas Sentence Case capitalizes
the first letter in the beginning of each sentence.
Superscript and Subscript
When you apply the Superscript and Subscript character formats to high-
lighted text, InDesign applies a baseline shift to the characters, lifting them
above (for superscript) or lowering them below (for subscript) their baseline,
and reduces their size.
The amount of baseline shift and scaling that’s used for the Superscript 
and Subscript formats is determined by the Position and Size fields in the
Advanced Type pane of the Preferences dialog box (choose InDesign➪
Preferences➪Advanced Type or press Ô+K on the Mac, or choose Edit➪
Preferences➪Advanced Type or press Ctrl+K in Windows). The default
Position value for both formats is 33.3%, which means that characters are
moved up or down by one-third of the applied leading value. The default
Superscript and Subscript Size value is 58.3%, which means that super-
scripted and subscripted characters are reduced to 58.3% of the applied font
size. The Advanced Type pane lets you specify separate default settings for
Superscript and Subscript.
257
Chapter 16: Finessing Character Details

To apply the Superscript or Subscript format to highlighted text, choose the
appropriate option from the Character panel’s flyout menu. Figure 16-2 shows
examples of characters to which the default Superscript and Subscript 
settings have been applied.
Underline and Strikethrough
Underline and Strikethrough formats are typographically considered to be
unacceptable for indicating emphasis in text, which is better accomplished
by using bold and/or italic font styles.
Underlines can be useful in kickers and other text above a headline, as well
as in documents formatted to look as if they are typewritten. Strikethrough
can be used in cases where you want to indicate incorrect answers, elimi-
nated choices, or deleted text.
If you use underlines and strikethrough, InDesign lets you specify exactly
how they look through the Underline Options and Strikethrough Options
dialog boxes available in the flyout menus of the Character panel and Control
panel.
InDesign lets you create your own underlines and strikethroughs, in addition
to using the standard ones, as Chapter 17 explains.
Ligatures
A ligature is a special character that combines two letters. Most fonts include
just two ligatures — ﬁ and ﬂ. When you choose the Ligature option, InDesign
automatically displays and prints a font’s built-in ligatures — instead of the
two component letters — if the font includes ligatures.
One nice thing about the Ligature option is that, even though a ligature looks
like a single character on-screen, it’s still fully editable. That is, you can click
between the two-letter shapes and insert text if necessary. Also, a ligature
created with the Ligature option doesn’t cause InDesign’s spell checker to
flag the word that contains it.
To use ligatures within highlighted text, choose Ligatures from the Character
panel’s or Control panel’s flyout menu (Ligatures is set to On by default).
Figure 16-4 shows an example of text with a ligature.
258
Part IV: Text Essentials 

You can also insert ligatures manually:
 On the Mac, press Option+Shift+5 to insert the ﬁligature and
Option+Shift+6 to insert the ﬂ ligature. You can also use the Mac OS X’s
Character Palette utility or InDesign’s Glyphs panel (Type➪Glyphs, 
or Option+Shift+F11 or Alt+Shift+F11) to choose them visually.
 In Windows, you have to use a program such as the Character Map utility
that comes with Windows. Choose Start➪All Programs➪Accessories➪
System Tools➪Character Map; if you have the Classic Start menu inter-
face enabled, choose Start➪Programs➪Accessories➪System Tools➪
Character Map.
However, if you do enter ligatures yourself, InDesign’s spell checker flags any
words that contain them. For this reason, you’ll typically want InDesign to
handle the task of inserting ligatures automatically.
Turning off hyphenation and other breaks
You can prevent individual words from being hyphenated or a string of words
from being broken at the end of a line. For example, you may decide that you
don’t want to hyphenate certain product names, such as InDesign. The No
Break option was created for situations such as these.
To prevent a word or a text string from being broken, highlight it, and then
choose No Break from the Character panel’s flyout menu or the Control
panel’s flyout menu. You can also prevent a word from being hyphenated by
placing a discretionary hyphen (Shift+Ô+– [hyphen] or Ctrl+Shift+– [hyphen])
in front of the first letter. (See Chapter 15 for more on hyphenation controls.)

Chapter 16: Finessing Character Details

Controlling Space between 
Characters and Lines
The legibility of a block of text depends as much on the space around it —
called white space — as it does on the readability of the font. InDesign offers
two ways to adjust the space between characters:
 Kerning is the adjustment of space between a pair of characters. Most
fonts include built-in kerning tables that control the space between char-
acter pairs, such as LA, Yo, and WA, that otherwise could appear to have
a space between them even when there isn’t one. For large font sizes —
for example, a magazine headline — you may want to manually adjust the
space between certain character pairs to achieve consistent spacing.
 Tracking is the process of adding or removing space among all letters in
a range of text.
You can apply kerning and/or tracking to highlighted text in 1⁄1,000-em incre-
ments, called units. An em is as wide as the height of the current font size
(that is, an em for 12-point text is 12 points wide), which means that kerning
and tracking increments are relative to the applied font size.
Leading (rhymes with sledding) controls the vertical space between lines of
type. It’s traditionally an attribute of paragraphs, but InDesign lets you apply
leading on a character-by-character basis. To override the character-oriented
approach, ensuring that leading changes affect entire paragraphs, check the
Apply Leading to Entire Paragraphs option in the Type pane of the Preferences
dialog box (choose InDesign➪Preferences➪Type or press Ô+K on the Mac, or
choose Edit➪Preferences➪Type or press Ctrl+K in Windows).
Kerning
The Kerning controls in the Character panel and Control panel provide three
options for kerning letter pairs:
 Metrics: Controls the space between character pairs in the highlighted
text using a font’s built-in kerning pairs.
 Optical: Evaluates each letter pair in highlighted text and adds or
removes space between the letters based on the shapes of the 
characters.
 Manual: Adds or removes space between a specific letter pair in 
user-specified amounts.
260
Part IV: Text Essentials 

When the flashing text cursor is between a pair of characters, the Kerning
field displays the pair’s kerning value. If Metrics or Optical kerning is applied,
the kerning value is displayed in parentheses.
To apply Metrics or Optical kerning to highlighted text, choose the appropri-
ate option from the Kerning pop-up menu. To apply manual kerning, click
between a pair of letters, and then enter a value in the Kerning field or
choose one of the predefined values. Negative values tighten; positive 
values loosen.
When letter shapes start to collide, you’ve tightened too far.
Tracking
Tracking is uniform kerning applied to a range of text. You might use tracking
to tighten character spacing for a font that you think is too spacey or loosen
spacing for a font that’s too tight. Or you could track a paragraph tighter or
looser to eliminate a short last line or a widow (the last line of a paragraph
that falls at the top of a page or column).
To apply tracking to highlighted text, enter a value in the Character panel’s 
or Control panel’s Tracking field or choose one of the predefined values.
Negative values tighten; positive values loosen (in 0.001-em increments).
You might wonder how tracking is different than kerning. They’re essentially
the same thing, with this difference: Tracking applies to a selection of three
or more characters, whereas kerning is meant to adjust the spacing between
just two characters. You use tracking to change the overall tightness of char-
acter spacing; you use kerning to improve the spacing between letters that
just don’t quite look right compared to the rest of the text.
Leading
Leading refers to the vertical space between lines of type as measured from
baseline to baseline. Leading in InDesign is a character-level format, which
means that you can apply different leading values within a single paragraph.
InDesign looks at each line of text in a paragraph and uses the largest applied
leading value within a line to determine the leading for that line.
261
Chapter 16: Finessing Character Details

By default, InDesign applies Auto Leading to text, which is equal to 120 per-
cent of the type size. As long as you don’t change fonts or type sizes in a
paragraph, Auto Leading works pretty well. But if you do change fonts or
sizes, Auto Leading can result in inconsistent spacing between lines. For this
reason, specifying an actual leading value is safer.
In most cases, using a leading value that is slightly larger than the type size is
a good idea. When the leading value equals the type size, text is said to be set
solid. That’s about as tight as you ever want to set leading, unless you’re
trying to achieve a special typographic effect or working with very large text
sizes in ad-copy headlines. As is the case with kerning and tracking, when
tight leading causes letters to collide — ascenders and descenders are the
first to overlap — you’ve gone too far.
You can change InDesign’s preset Auto Leading value of 120%. To do so,
choose Type➪Paragraph, or press Option+Ô+T or Ctrl+Alt+T, to display the
Paragraph panel. Choose Justification in the flyout menu, enter a new value
in the Auto Leading field, and then click OK. (Why a character format setting
is accessed via the Paragraph panel and what Auto Leading has to do with
Justification are both mysteries.)
To modify the leading value applied to selected text, choose one of the 
predefined options from the Leading pop-up menu in the Character panel or
Control panel, or enter a leading value in the field. You can enter values from
0 to 5,000 points in 0.001-point increments. You can also use the up and down
arrow keys to change leading in 1-point increments.

ith the myriad of text-formatting techniques available in InDesign, you
can create some snazzy and sophisticated effects. You can stretch,
skew, rotate, and color text. You can use a wide range of characters for bul-
lets. You can add shadows and feathering effects to give words a dramatic
flair. As with all good things, moderation in your use of text effects will keep
your documents looking professional. This chapter shows you some InDesign
features that can produce typographic special effects and gives some sugges-
tions on when to use them. (Chapters 15 and 16 cover more prosaic format-
ting controls.)
You can also apply all sorts of transformations to text frames, which affects
the text inside of them. Chapter 9 covers these capabilities.
Using Bulleted and Numbered Lists
Automatic bullets and numbering are available as a paragraph format in
InDesign. You access these options (after selecting the paragraphs you want
to make into automatic lists, of course) by choosing Bullets and Numbering
Options from the Paragraph panel’s or Control panel’s flyout menus. Doing so
displays the Bullets and Numbering dialog box shown in Figure 17-1.

To set bullets or numbered lists in the Bullets and Numbering dialog box, first
select either Bullets or Numbers from the List Type pop-up menu, and then
follow these steps (select the Preview check box to see the results of your
choices before you finalize them):
1. For bullets, choose a bullet character from the Bullet Character area.
The area will show bullet characters available for the current font; you
can change the selection by changing the selected font or by clicking the
Add button.
For numbered lists, choose a numbering style from the Format pop-up
menu, format the numbers’ appearance by choosing spaces and number
placeholders from the pop-up menu to the right, and choose whether
the numbers continue or start anew at this paragraph through the Mode
pop-up menu (your choices are Continue from Previous Number and
Start At).
In the Number field (which replaces the previous version’s Separator
pop-up menu), you can insert all sorts of special spaces and characters,
giving you broad control on how numbers display. You can also choose
number placeholders, which tell InDesign what numbers to insert in the
list. For simple lists, choose Current Level from the Insert Number
Placeholder pop-up submenu. The other levels are used when you have
sublists, an expert feature. You can also choose Chapter Number to
insert the chapter’s number as the list item’s number.
The Mode pop-up menu replaces the previous version’s Start At field.
2. Adjust the font settings for the bullets or numbers by using the
Character Style pop-up menu to choose a character style.
The default setting ([None]) uses the paragraph’s current formatting.
Figure 17-1:

and

264
Part IV: Text Essentials 

The Character Style pop-up menu replaces the previous version’s Font
Family, Font Style, Size, and Color options.
3. In the Bullet or Number Position section of the dialog box, set the
indentation for the list. Using the Alignment pop-up menu, choose Left,
Center, or Right to determine where the bullet or numeral is positioned
within its tab. You can set the hanging indent amount and the bullet’s or
number’s overhang by using the Left Indent, First Line Indent, and Tab
Position fields.
This Bullet or Number Position section’s settings have changed to pro-
vide greater control over the list’s indentation and bullet or number
position.
4. When you finish formatting the bulleted or numbered list, click OK.
InDesign CS3 gives you even more control over bulleted and numbered lists
through the new options you get by choosing Type➪Bulleted & Numbered
Lists:
 The Apply/Remove Bullets and Apply/Remove Numbers submenu
options quickly let you turn on or off the bullets or numbering for
selected paragraphs. You can also use the iconic buttons for these 
controls on the Control panel.
 The Restart/Continue Numbering is a handy way to control which para-
graphs are numbered, such as when you have an unnumbered para-
graph within a list. (These options are also available in the flyout menu
of the Paragraph panel and Control panel.)
 The Convert Bullets to Text and Convert Numbering to Text options
remove the automatic bullets or numerals in a paragraph but leave an
actual bullet character or numeral at the beginning of the paragraph for
you to do as you please.
A more expert option is the Define Lists option (available in two places: by
choosing Type➪Bulleted & Numbered Lists➪Define Lists, or by choosing
Define Lists from the Paragraph panel’s flyout menu). Here, you create list
styles with just two options: Continue Numbers Across Stories and Continue
Numbers from Previous Document in a Book. These list styles are accessed
when you create or edit paragraph styles using the style dialog boxes’ Bullets
and Numbering pane, or when you apply bullets and numbering through the
Paragraph panel’s or Control panel’s flyout menu. (Either way, choose the
appropriate style in the List pop-up menu.)
When you choose the first option, InDesign continues numbering text based
on the last number used in the previous story rather than restart the num-
bering at each story (the normal behavior). When you choose the second
option, InDesign continues numbering text based on the last number used in
the previous chapter of a book (see Chapter 23) rather than start over again
with this document (the normal behavior).
265
Chapter 17: Tricks with Text

It’s possible that the bulleted or numbered list you’re working with was first
created in a word processor and then placed in InDesign. Perhaps the writer
simply used an asterisk followed by a space to indicate a bullet, or used the
word processor’s automatic bullet or numbering feature. You can deal with
imported bulleted and numbered lists as described in Chapter 12.
For the bullets in a list, you’re not limited to using the small round bullet (•)
included in most typefaces. You can use any character in the body text font,
or you can switch to a symbol or pi font and choose a more decorative char-
acter. Zapf Dingbats and Wingdings are the most common symbol fonts, offer-
ing an array of boxes, arrows, crosses, stars, and check marks.
Labeling Paragraphs
Along with using drop caps, which I cover in Chapter 15, changing the format-
ting of the first few words in a paragraph as a label can serve as a visual indi-
cator that the reader has arrived at the beginning of a story, chapter, or new
topic. To experiment with label formatting, use the attributes available via
the Character panel or Control panel and their flyout menus, such as font
changes, horizontal scale, or small caps. After you decide on the formatting
for labels, you can apply it by using character styles after paragraph styles
are applied — and after the text is final. You might also be able to use the
nested styles feature if the label text follows a specific pattern, such as a 
specific number of words or characters or an entire sentence.
A real easy way to consistently apply the desired label formatting to text is to
use a nested style, as explained in Chapter 14.
The following descriptions show frequently used label formatting:
 Boldface: Bold type is often used for titles and subheads in magazines,
newspapers, and reports. To apply boldface in InDesign, select the bold
version of the typeface from the Font Style pop-up menu in the
Character panel.
 Italics: Italic text is a good choice for emphasizing specific words and 
for applying to tertiary heads. To apply italics in InDesign, select the
oblique version of the typeface from the Font Style pop-up menu on the
Character panel.
 Underlines: Underlined text isn’t used as frequently as it once was,
simply because page-layout programs such as InDesign offer more
sophisticated options for labeling text. Still, you might have occasion to
use underlines, such as to emphasize a label. Use the Underline com-
mand in the menu on the Character panel or via the iconic button in the
266
Part IV: Text Essentials 

Control panel’s character (A) pane. Note that you have no control over
the style, thickness, or placement of the underline if you use this option;
for custom underlines, use the controls described later in this chapter.
 SMALL CAPS: Small caps offer a subtle, classic look that blends well with
the rest of the document. You have two choices for applying small 
caps from the Character pane: Choose a small-caps variation of a 
typeface from the Font Style pop-up menu or choose the Small Caps
command from the Character panel’s flyout menu, or via the iconic
button in the Control panel’s character (A) pane.
 Typeface change: Rather than relying on different variations of a font, you
can use a different font altogether, such as Futura Medium, for a label.
To contrast with serif body text, you might choose a sans-serif typeface
that complements the look of your publication. To apply a different type-
face, use the Font Family pop-up menu in the Character panel or Control
panel.
 S c a l e d  t e x t :
Scaling text horizontally — up 10 or 20 
percent — is a subtle effect that makes the section of text visually dis-
tinct. Scaling text vertically, however, can be too subtle unless combined
with boldface or another style. Use the Horizontal Scale and Vertical
Scale fields in the Character panel or Control panel to scale text.
 Size change: Bumping the size of a label up a point or two is another
subtle design choice. To change the size of type, use the Font Size field
in the Character panel or Control panel.
Adding Special Type Treatments
Skilled graphic designers make decisions based on what best serves the 
content. In doing so, they often rely on special typographic techniques. For
example, the use of reverse type helps to break up pages and to organize
text, while careful formatting of fractions and hanging punctuation adds a
professional touch.
Reversing type out of its background
Reversed type is white type on a black background rather than black type on
a white background. Of course, reversed type doesn’t have to be white on
black; it can be any lighter color on a darker color. You often find reversed
type in table headings, kickers (explanatory blurbs following headlines), and
decorative layout elements.
267
Chapter 17: Tricks with Text

To lighten the text, highlight it with the Type tool, click the Fill button on the
Tools panel, and choose a light color from the Swatches panel (Window➪
Swatches or F5). For the dark background, you have three options: filling the
text frame with a darker color, making the text frame transparent and placing
it on top of darker objects, or placing a thick, dark ruling line behind the text.
For the first two options, select the text frame and then click the Fill iconic
button on the Tools panel.
 To fill the text frame with a darker color, click a color from the Swatches
panel.
 To make the text frame transparent, click the Apply None iconic button
on the Tools panel. Then place the text frame in front of a darker object
or graphic.
To create reversed type that is not in its own text frame, use a ruling line of
the appropriate width (at least a couple points larger than the text size). If
you use a Ruling Line Above, move the line down behind the text; if you use a
Ruling Line Below, move it up. Figure 17-2 shows reversed type used as a
heading, as well as the Paragraph Rules dialog box and the settings used to
create the effect. (To access this dialog box, choose Paragraph Rules from
the flyout menu of the Control panel’s ¶ pane or of the Paragraph panel, or
press Option+Ô+J or Ctrl+Alt+J.)
I explain how to create and adjust ruling lines in greater detail in Chapter 15.

Part IV: Text Essentials 

Creating sidebars and pull-quotes
A sidebar is supplemental text that is often formatted differently from the rest
of the document and placed within a shaded or outlined box. Sidebars help
break up text-heavy pages and call attention to information that is often inter-
esting but not essential to the main story.
Particularly in text-heavy publications, pulling in-depth information or
related text into sidebars can help provide visual relief. To create a sidebar,
you usually place the text in its own frame, then stroke the frame and option-
ally fill it with a tint. To inset the text from the edges of the frame, use the
Text Frame Options dialog box (Object➪Text Frame Options or Ô+B or
Ctrl+B).
A pull-quote is a catchy one- or two-line excerpt from a publication that is
enlarged and reformatted to achieve both editorial and design objectives.
Pull-quotes draw readers into articles with excerpts that do everything from
summarize the content to provide shock value. From the design perspective,
pull-quotes break up static columns and offer opportunities for typographic
treatment that emphasizes the content, such as colors and typefaces that
support the mood of an article.
To create a pull-quote, copy and paste the relevant text into its own text
frame and then reformat the text and frame as you wish. Use the Text Wrap
panel (Window➪Text Wrap or Option+Ô+W or Ctrl+Alt+W) to control how
text in columns wraps around the pull-quote.
To create sidebars, pull-quotes, or other such elements that stay close to the
text that refers to them, use the anchored-object feature described in
Chapter 11.
Formatting fractions
Creating fractions that are formatted correctly can be handy. Compare the
top line in Figure 17-3, which is not formatted appropriately for a fraction, to
the bottom line, which is correctly formatted. Although InDesign doesn’t pro-
vide an automatic fraction maker, you can use OpenType typefaces, expert
typefaces, or character formats to achieve professional-looking fractions.
269
Chapter 17: Tricks with Text

Applying a fraction typeface
Some expert typefaces include a variation, appropriately called Fractions,
that includes a number of common fractions, such as 1⁄2, 1⁄3, 1⁄4, and 3⁄4. Adobe
has Expert Collection variants for many of its popular Type 1 PostScript
fonts; these collections include true small caps, true fractions, and other
typographic characters. You can also use a symbol font, though the numerals
may not exactly match the appearance of numerals in the rest of your text
because symbol fonts typically use plain fonts like Helvetica as their basis.
To use a true fraction from an Expert Collection font, choose Type➪Glyph 
(or press Option+Shift+F11 or Alt+Shift+F11), select the font and face from the
pop-up menus at the bottom of the dialog box shown in Figure 17-3, and then
select the fraction you want to use.
If you have OpenType fonts, the process can be automated: Be sure that the
Fraction option is enabled for the selected text, either as part of its character
or paragraph style, or by highlighting the text and adjusting the OpenType
options directly:
 For styles, go to the OpenType Features pane when creating or modify-
ing a paragraph or character style, and check Fractions.
 For local formatting, highlight the text containing the fraction and then
choose OpenType➪Fraction from the flyout menu of the Character panel
or Control panel — be sure that Fraction is checked in the menu.
These OpenType options have no effect on non-OpenType fonts.

270
Part IV: Text Essentials 

Formatting fractions manually
If you’re dealing with a wide range of fractions in something like a cookbook,
you probably won’t find all the fractions you need in your Expert Collection
or OpenType font. And regular Type 1 Postscript and TrueType fonts cer-
tainly won’t have the desired fractions. Because it would be difficult to
format fractions such as 3⁄16 exactly the same as, say, an expert font’s 1⁄4, you
might opt for formatting all the fractions manually.
The built-in fractions in expert and OpenType fonts are approximately the
same size as a single character in that font, and this is your eventual goal in
formatting a fraction manually. Usually, you achieve this by decreasing the
size of the two numerals, raising the numerator (the first, or top, number in
the fraction) using the baseline shift feature, and kerning on either side of the
slash as necessary. (Chapter 16 covers these controls.) Figure 17-4 shows
examples of an unformatted fraction, an expert font’s fraction, an OpenType-
generated fraction, and a manually created fraction.
Macintosh PostScript and TrueType fonts (as well as expert fonts and
OpenType fonts for both Windows and Macintosh) provide another option
for refining fractions: a special kind of slash called a virgule, which is smaller
and at more of an angle than a regular slash. Press Option+Shift+1 to enter a
virgule, then kern around it as you would a slash. (You can see how a virgule
differs from a slash in Figure 17-4: The first and fourth fractions use slashes,
while the second and third use virgules.)
Unless you rarely use fractions, by all means save your formatting as charac-
ter styles. You can apply the formats with a keystroke or use Find/Change
(Edit➪Find/Change or Ô+F or Ctrl+F) to locate numbers and selectively apply
the appropriate character style.

Chapter 17: Tricks with Text

Optical margin alignment
When display type, such as a pull-quote or headline type in ads, is left-aligned
or justified, the edges can look uneven due to the gaps above, below, or next
to quotation marks, other punctuation, and some capital letters. Notice the
text frame on the left in Figure 17-5, which does not have hanging punctua-
tion. To correct the unevenness, you can use a technique called hanging 
punctuation, or optical margin alignment, which extends the punctuation
slightly beyond the edges of the rest of the text.
The “edge” of text is defined by the edges of the text frame or any Inset
Spacing specified in the Text Frame Options dialog box (Object➪Text Frame
Options or Ô+B or Ctrl+B).
The optical margin alignment feature automates hanging punctuation, extend-
ing punctuation and the edges of some glyphs (such as the capital T) slightly
outside the edges of the text. Unfortunately, you can’t control how much the
characters “hang” outside the text boundaries — InDesign decides that for
you. And optical margin alignment applies to all the text frames in a story,
rather than to highlighted text. Therefore, you need to isolate any text for
which you want hanging punctuation into its own story.
To specify optical margin alignment, select any text frame in a story and
choose Type➪Story. In the Story panel, check the Optical Margin Alignment
option, as shown in Figure 17-5
Figure 17-5:

Part IV: Text Essentials 

Custom underline and 
strikethrough options
You can use InDesign to create text with custom underlines and strikethroughs.
Although you should use these effects sparingly, they can be effective for
signs and other design-oriented text presentations, such as the examples
shown in Figure 17-6.
You can find both the Underline Options and Strikethrough Options menu
items in the flyout menu of the Character panel’s and of the Control panel’s 
A pane, and you can use these menu options to get just the look you’re inter-
ested in. The process for setting both Underline Options and Strikethrough
Options is similar:
1. Highlight the text to which you want the custom underline or
strikethrough.
2. Specify the thickness, type, color, and other settings for the line that
makes up the underline or the strikethrough line.
If you choose an underline or strikethrough line type that has gaps —
such as dashed, dotted, or striped lines — you can also choose a gap
color. Figure 17-7 shows the Underline Options dialog box; the
Strikethrough Options dialog box is almost identical.
3. Apply the underline style via the Control panel, Character panel, or
keyboard shortcut (Shift+Ô+U or Ctrl+Shift+U). Apply the strikethrough
style via the Control panel, Character panel, or keyboard shortcut
(Shift+Ô+/ or Ctrl+Shift+/).
Note that a custom underline or strikethrough created and applied this way
is in effect only for the first text to which an underline or strikethrough is
applied. InDesign reverts to the standard settings the next time you apply 
an underline or strikethrough. If you want to use a custom underline or
strikethrough setting repeatedly, you should define the setting as part of a
character style.
Figure 17-6:

Converting Text into Shapes
If you want to use the shape of a letter or the combined shapes of several let-
ters as a frame for text or a graphic, you could test your skill with the Pen
tool and create the letter shape(s) yourself. But getting hand-drawn charac-
ters to look just the way you want them to can take lots of time. A quicker
solution is to use the Create Outlines command to convert text characters
into editable outlines. The Create Outlines command is particularly useful if
you want to hand-tweak the shapes of characters, particularly at display font
sizes, or place text or a graphic within character shapes.
If all you need to do is apply a stroke or fill to characters within text, you
don’t have to convert the characters into outlines. Instead, simply highlight
the characters and use the Stroke panel (Window➪Stroke, or Ô+F10 or
Ctrl+F10) and Swatches panel (Window➪Swatches or F5) to change their
appearance. This way you can still edit the text. (See Chapter 8 for more
details.)
When you use the Create Outlines command, you have the choice of creating
an inline compound path that replaces the original text or an independent
compound path that’s placed directly on top of the original letters in its own
frame. If you want the text outlines to flow with the surrounding text, create
an inline compound path. If you want to use the outlines elsewhere, create an
independent compound path.

Part IV: Text Essentials 

To convert text into outlines:
1. Use the Type tool to highlight the characters you want to convert into
outlines.
Generally, this feature works best with large font sizes.
2. Choose Type➪Create Outlines or press Shift+Ô+O or Ctrl+Shift+O
(that’s the letter O, not a zero).
If you hold down the Option or Alt key when you choose Create
Outlines, or if you press Shift+Option+Ô+O or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+O, a com-
pound path is created and placed in front of the text. In this case, you
can use either of the selection tools to move the resulting compound
path. If you don’t hold down Option or Alt when you choose Create
Outlines, an inline compound path is created. This object replaces the
original text and flows with the surrounding text.
After you create text outlines, you can modify the paths the same as you can
modify hand-drawn paths. You can also use the transformation tools, the
Control panel (Window➪Control, or Option+Ô+6 or Ctrl+Alt+6), and the
Transform panel (Window➪Transform) to change the appearance of text out-
lines. You cannot, however, edit text after converting it to outlines.
Additionally, you can use the Place command (File➪Place, or Ô+D or Ctrl+D)
or the Paste Into command (Edit➪Paste Into, or Option+Ô+V or Ctrl+Alt+V)
to import text or a graphic into the frames created by converting text to
graphics.
Making Text Follow a Path
InDesign lets you have text follow any open or closed path, such as a line or
frame. Simply select the path or shape with the Type on a Path tool, which is
available from the Type tool’s pop-up menu. Now start typing (or paste or
place) your text.
Once you have entered the text and formatted it with font, size, color, and so
forth, you can apply special effects to it using the Type on a Path Options
dialog box, accessed by choosing Type➪Type on a Path➪Options and then
selecting from its options.
You can also double-click the Type on a Path tool to open the Type on a Path
Options dialog box.

Figure 17-8 shows the dialog box and several examples of its formatting. In
the dialog box:
 Use the Effect pop-up menu to choose a visual effect.
 Use the Align pop-up menu to choose what part of the text is aligned
(baseline, center, ascender, or descender).
 Use the To Path pop-up menu to choose whether to align to the center,
bottom, or top of the path.
 Flip the text by selecting the Flip option.
 Change the text’s spacing by entering a value in the Spacing field (posi-
tive numbers space out the text, while negative ones contract it).

T
hey say a picture is worth a thousand words. Well, a
lot of them are. Graphics make layouts come alive,
providing a visceral connection that text by itself just
cannot. So it should be no surprise that InDesign has tons
of features to work with and even create graphics. This
part shows you how to work with imported graphics files,
cropping them and making them fit your layout’s canvas.
You might wonder why this part is so short, given how
many graphical effects InDesign offers. If you skipped 
Part III, that confusion is understandable: InDesign lets
you apply most of its special effects and controls to any
object, not just those containing graphics, so Part III
covers that common razzle-dazzle in one place.

Chapter 18
Importing Graphics
In This Chapter
 Preparing graphics for use in InDesign
 Importing and placing graphics
 Working with layered images
W
hat is a layout without graphics? Boring, that’s what. And that’s why
InDesign lets you import a wide variety of graphics types, so you have
a lot of choices and flexibility in the images you use.
And through the Mac and Windows Clipboards (copy and paste), you can
import file formats — to a limited degree — that are not directly supported
by InDesign.
The terms graphic and picture are interchangeable, referring to any type of
graphic — though InDesign consistently uses the word graphic in its user
interface and documentation. An image is a bitmapped graphic, such as that
produced by an image editor, digital camera, or scanner, while an illustration
or drawing is a vector file produced by an illustration program.
Preparing Graphics Files
InDesign offers support for many major formats of graphics files. Some for-
mats are more appropriate than others for certain kinds of tasks. The basic
rules for creating your graphics files are as follows:
 Save line art (drawings) in a format such as EPS, PDF, Adobe Illustrator,
Windows Metafile (WMF), Enhanced Metafile (EMF), or PICT. (These
object-oriented formats are called vector formats. Vector files are 
composed of instructions on how to draw various shapes.) InDesign
works best with EPS, PDF, and Illustrator files.

 Save bitmaps (photos and scans) in a format such as TIFF, Adobe
Photoshop, PNG, JPEG, PCX, Windows Bitmap (BMP), GIF, Scitex
Continuous Tone (SCT), or PICT. (These pixel-oriented formats are called
raster formats. Raster files are composed of a series of dots, or pixels,
that make up the image.) InDesign works best with TIFF and Photoshop
files.
InDesign CS3 can also import InDesign files as if they were graphics — in a
multi-page document, you choose the page you want to import, as you can
with PDF files. Note that InDesign files imported as graphics cannot be edited
in your InDesign layout (you must update the original file instead).
Make EPS and TIFF formats your standards because these have become the
standard graphics formats in publishing. If you and your service bureau are
working almost exclusively with Adobe software, you can add the PDF,
Illustrator, and Photoshop formats to this mix. (The Illustrator and PDF for-
mats are variants of EPS.) If you use transparency in your graphics, it’s best
to save them in Photoshop, Illustrator, or PDF formats, because other formats
(particularly EPS and TIFF) remove much of the transparency layering data
that will help an imagesetter optimally reproduce those transparent files.
The graphics file formats that InDesign imports include (the text in monofont
is the PC filename extension for the format):
 BMP: The native Windows bitmap format (.bmp, .dib).
 EPS: The Encapsulated PostScript file format favored by professional
publishers (.eps).
 GIF: The Graphics Interchange Format common in Web documents
(.gif).
 JPEG: The Joint Photographers Expert Group compressed bitmap
format often used on the Web (.jpg).
 Illustrator: The native format in Adobe Illustrator 5.5 through CS3. This
file format is similar to EPS (.ai).
 PCX: The PC Paintbrush format that was very popular in DOS programs
and early version of Windows; it has now been largely supplanted by
other formats (.pcx, .rle).
 PDF: The Portable Document Format that is a variant of EPS and is used
for Web-, network-, and CD-based documents. InDesign CS3 supports
PDF versions 1.3 through 1.7 (the formats used in Acrobat 4 through 8)
(.pdf).
 Photoshop: The native format in Adobe Photoshop 5.0 through CS3
(.psd). (Note that InDesign cannot import the Photoshop Raw format.)
280
Part V: Graphics Essentials 

 PICT: Short for Picture, the Mac’s native graphics format until Mac OS X
(it can be bitmap or vector) that is little used in professional documents
and has become rare even for inexpensive clip art (.pct).
 PNG: The Portable Network Graphics format introduced more than a
decade ago as a more capable alternative to GIF (.png).
 QuickTime movie: For use in interactive documents, InDesign supports
this Apple-created, cross-platform format (.mov).
 Scitex CT: The continuous-tone bitmap format used on Scitex prepress
systems (.ct).
 TIFF: The Tagged Image File Format that is the bitmap standard for 
professional image editors and publishers (.tif, .tiff).
 Windows Metafile: The format native to Windows but little used in 
professional documents. Since Office 2000, Microsoft applications create
a new version called Enhanced Metafile, also supported by InDesign
(.wmf, .emf).
Spot colors (called spot inks in Photoshop) are imported into InDesign when
you place Photoshop, Illustrator, and PDF images into InDesign, as well as for
InDesign documents imported as graphics. They appear in the Swatches
panel, which is covered in Chapter 7.
Importing and Placing Graphics
It’s important to understand that when you import a graphic into a docu-
ment, InDesign establishes a link between the graphics file and the document
file and then sends the original graphics file to the printer when the docu-
ment is output. (For more details on managing linked files, see Chapter 10.)
InDesign links to graphics because a graphics file, particularly a high-resolution
scanned graphic, can be very large. If the entire graphics file is included in an
InDesign document when you import it, InDesign documents would quickly
become prohibitively large. Instead, InDesign saves a low-resolution preview
of an imported graphics file with the document, and it’s this file that you see
displayed on-screen. InDesign remembers the location of the original file and
uses this information when printing.
The Place command (File➪Place, or Ô+D or Ctrl+D) is the method you typi-
cally use to bring graphics into your InDesign layout. Here’s how to use the
Place command to import a graphic:
281
Chapter 18: Importing Graphics

1. Choose File➪Place or press Ô+D or Ctrl+D.
If you want to import a graphic into an existing frame, select the target
frame using either of the selection tools (either before you choose
File➪Place or afterwards). If you want InDesign to create a new frame
when you import the graphic, make sure no object is selected when you
choose Place. Either way, the Place dialog box appears.
You can import a graphic into any kind of frame or shape (including a
curved line created with the Pen tool) except a straight line. Be careful:
If the Type tool is selected when you use the Place command to import a
graphic into a selected text frame, you’ll create an inline graphic at the
text cursor’s location.
2. Use the controls in the Place dialog box to locate and select the 
graphics files you want to import.
You can now select multiple files — graphics and/or text — by
Shift+clicking a range or Ô+clicking or Ctrl+clicking multiple files one by
one. InDesign will let you place each file in a separate frame. Just click
once for each file imported, or Shift+Ô+click or Ctrl+Shift+click to have
InDesign place all files on the page in separate frames. The loaded-
graphic icon will show the number of files to be placed, as well as a mini
preview of each file, as Figure 18-1 shows. You can also navigate through
these previews using the keyboard’s left and right arrow keys, so you
can control more easily which file is placed when.
3. Specify the desired import options, if any are applicable. If you want
to display import options that let you control how the selected graphics
file is imported, either select Show Import Options, and then click 
Open; or hold down the Shift key and double-click on the filename or
Shift+click Open. If you choose to Show Import Options, the EPS Import
Options, Place PDF, Place InDesign Document, or Image Import Options
dialog box, depending on what kind of graphic you are importing, is 
displayed. Click OK after selecting the desired options. (These options
are covered later in this chapter.)
4. You can place a graphic in an existing frame or in a new frame, 
as follows:
• If an empty frame is selected, the graphic is automatically placed
in the frame. The upper-left corner of the graphic is placed in the
upper-left corner of the frame, and the frame acts as the cropping
shape for the graphic.
• If a frame already holding a graphic is selected, InDesign will replace
the existing graphic with the new one if you’ve selected the Replace
282
Part V: Graphics Essentials 

Selected Item check box in the Place dialog box. Otherwise, InDesign
will assume you want to put the new graphic in a new frame.
• To place the graphic into a new frame, click the loaded-graphic
icon on an empty portion of a page or on the pasteboard. The
point where you click establishes the upper-left corner of the
resulting graphics frame, which is the same size as the imported
graphic and which acts as the graphic’s cropping shape.
• To place the graphic in an existing, unselected frame, click in the
frame with the loaded-graphic icon. The upper-left corner of the
graphic is placed in the upper-left corner of the frame, and the
frame acts as a cropping shape.
After you place a graphic, it’s displayed in the frame that contains it, and the
frame is selected. If the Selection tool is selected, the eight handles of its
bounding box are displayed; if the Direct Selection tool is selected, handles
are displayed only in the corners. At this point, you can modify either the
frame or the graphic within, or you can move on to another task.
When importing JPEG files, InDesign automatically scales the image to fit in
the page. This feature helps deal with digital-camera graphics that tend to be
very large in dimension, so when imported end up taking much more than
the width of a page. Although you’ll likely still need to scale the image to fit
your layout, you can at least see the whole image before doing so.

Chapter 18: Importing Graphics

Specifying Import Options
If you’ve ever used a graphics application — for example, an image-editing
program like Adobe Photoshop or an illustration program like Adobe
Illustrator or CorelDraw — you’re probably aware that when you save a graph-
ics file, you have several options that control such things as file format, image
size, color depth, preview quality, and so on. When you save a graphics file,
the settings you specify are determined by the way in which the image will be
used. For example, you could use Photoshop to save a high-resolution TIFF
version of a scanned graphic for use in a slick, four-color annual report or a
low-resolution GIF version of the same graphic for use on the company’s Web
page. Or you could use Illustrator or CorelDraw to create a corporate logo that
you’ll use in various sizes in many of your printed publications.
If you choose to specify custom import settings when you import a graphics
file, the choices you make will depend on the nature of the publication. For
example, if it’s bound for the Web, there’s no need to work with or save
graphics using resolutions that exceed a computer monitor’s 72-dpi resolu-
tion. Along the same lines, if the publication will be printed, the image import
settings you specify for a newspaper that will be printed on newsprint on a
SWOP (Specifications for Web Offset Publications) press will be different than
those you specify for a four-color magazine printed on coated paper using a
sheet-fed press.
If you select Show Import Options when you place a graphic, the options 
displayed in the resulting dialog boxes depend on the file format of the
selected graphic. When you set options for a particular file, the options you
specify remain in effect for that file format until you change them. If you don’t
select the Show Import Options check box when you place a graphic, the
most recent settings for the file format of the selected graphic are used.
Import options for bitmap graphics
InDesign gives you two sets of import options for the following types of
bitmap images: TIFF, GIF, JPEG, Scitex CT, BMP, and PCX. You get three
options for PNG files, and a different set of three for Photoshop files. No
import options are available for PICT or QuickTime movie files. Figure 18-2
shows three of the four possible panes for bitmap images: The Image and
Color panes are for most bitmap formats; PNG files have a third pane, PNG
Settings, and Photoshop files also have a third pane, Layers, covered later in
this chapter.
284
Part V: Graphics Essentials 

If you import a Photoshop, TIFF, or EPS file that contains an embedded clip-
ping path, the Image pane lets you apply any embedded clipping path and/or
alpha channel to the image in order to mask, or cut out, part of the image.
(Otherwise, these options are grayed out.) Check the Apply Photoshop
Clipping Path option to import the clipping path along with the image; select
an alpha channel from the Alpha Channel pop-up menu to import the alpha
channel along with the image. (Chapter 19 covers clipping paths in more
detail.)
Color pane
In the Color pane, you can turn on color management for the image and 
control how the image is displayed. Check the Enable Color Management
option to enable color management. This is an expert feature, so ask your
production manager or service bureau whether you should make any adjust-
ments here.
Figure 18-2:
The Image,
Color, and

285
Chapter 18: Importing Graphics

PNG Settings pane
Use the PNG Settings pane — available only if you place a PNG file — to use
the transparency information in a PNG file, assuming it has a transparent
background. You have two choices for controlling transparency handling:
White Background and File-Defined Background. The former forces the trans-
parent portion to display as white in InDesign; the latter uses whatever back-
ground color is specified in the PNG file itself.
This pane also lets you adjust the gamma value during import — an expert
color-management feature you should leave alone unless told otherwise by a
production manager or service bureau.
Import options for vector file formats
If you’re importing vector files, selecting the Import Options check box will
result in one of two dialog boxes appearing, depending on what the vector
file type is. If you import older-version Illustrator or EPS files, you’ll get the
EPS Import Options dialog box; if you import PDF and newer-version
Illustrator files, you’ll get the Place PDF dialog box, which has two panes.
(Both dialog boxes are shown in Figure 18-3.) No import options are available
for Windows Metafile or Enhanced Metafile graphics.
Figure 18-3:
The EPS
Import
Options and

boxes.
286
Part V: Graphics Essentials 

Illustrator CS through CS3 use PDF as their native file format, even though 
the filename extension is .ai, so InDesign detects these files as PDF files and
provides the PDF options during import. In earlier versions of Illustrator, the
native format was actually a variant of EPS.
EPS Import Options dialog box
Use this dialog box to import any clipping paths embedded in images that are
in the EPS file. Check the Apply Photoshop Clipping Path option to enable
this option.
Also, use this pane to control how the EPS file appears on-screen in InDesign.
If you select the Use TIFF or PICT Preview option, InDesign will use the low-
resolution proxy image embedded in the EPS file for display on-screen and
print the graphic using the embedded high-resolution PostScript instructions.
If you select the Rasterize the PostScript option, InDesign will convert the
PostScript file into a bitmap image during import. There’s rarely a reason to
rasterize an imported EPS file — it just takes up some of your valuable time.
Place PDF dialog box
When you use the Place command to import a PDF file and you select the
Show Import Options check box, the Place PDF file dialog box, shown in
Figure 18-3, is displayed. It provides several controls for specifying how the
file is imported. The General pane provides the following options:
 In the Pages section, select Previewed Page, All, or Range to determine
which page(s) you want to import. You can change the previewed page
by using the arrow buttons under the preview image at left or entering a
specific page number in the field below the preview image. If you want to
import a range, use commas to separate pages and a hyphen to indicate
range; for example, 3, 5-9, 13 will import pages 3, 5 through 9, and 13.
When you place the PDF in InDesign, you’ll get a separate loaded-graphic
icon for each page, so as you place each page, a new loaded-graphic icon
will appear for the next page, until there are no more to place. You can
tell you’re placing multiple pages because the loaded-graphics icon will
have a plus sign in it.
 In the Options section, select one of the cropping options from the Crop
To pop-up menu. If you choose Content, the page’s bounding box or a
rectangle that encloses all items, including page marks, is used to build
the graphics frame. Choosing Art places the area defined by the file’s
creator, if any, as placeable artwork. For example, the person who cre-
ated the file might have designated a particular graphic as placeable art-
work. Choosing Crop places the area displayed and printed by Adobe
287
Chapter 18: Importing Graphics

Acrobat. Choosing Trim places the graphic in an area equal to the final,
trimmed piece. Choosing Bleed places the page area plus any specified
bleed area. Choosing Media places an area defined by the paper size
specified for the PDF document, including page marks.
 Also in the Options section, select the Transparent Background check
box if you want the white areas of the PDF page to be transparent.
Uncheck this option if you want to preserve the page’s opaque white
background.
Import options for placed InDesign files
When you import InDesign files to use as a graphic, you can use exactly the
same options as for PDF files. The Place InDesign Document dialog box is
identical to the Place PDF dialog box covered in the previous section, except
of course, for the dialog box’s name.
Working with image layers
InDesign lets you work with individual layers in some imported graphics.
What that means is that you have more control over what displays because
you can turn on or off individual layers. Of course, to use this capability, the
source graphic must be constructed with multiple layers.
Use the Layers pane in the Image Import Options dialog box, the Place PDF,
or Place InDesign Document dialog box to select which layer(s) you want 
visible in InDesign. (The Layers pane is available only if you place an
Illustrator, PDF, or Photoshop graphic or InDesign file.) You will see a list of
image layers. Any that have the eye icon will display in InDesign, and you can
select or deselect layers by clicking the box to the right of the layer name to
make the eye icon appear or disappear. (You cannot change their order —
you’d need to go back to Photoshop or Illustrator and change the layer order
there.) Figure 18-4 shows the Layers pane.
Note that you can adjust which layers are visible later on by selecting the
graphic and then choosing Object➪Object Layers Options.
Although you can save an image file in the TIFF format and preserve any
layers, InDesign CS3 does not give you the ability to manage which layers you
import from a TIFF file into InDesign.
288
Part V: Graphics Essentials 

There’s also an option, in the When Updating Link pop-up menu, to control
how changes to the file are handled in terms of layer management: If you
choose Use Photoshop’s Layer Visibility or Use Illustrator’s Layer Visibility,
InDesign will make all layers that are visible in Photoshop, InDesign or
Illustrator visible when you update the link to the graphic from InDesign. If
you choose Keep Layer Visibility Overrides in the When Updating Link pop-
up menu, InDesign will import only the layers chosen in this dialog box if you
later update the graphic in Photoshop, InDesign, or Illustrator.
Using Other Ways to Import Graphics
If you want to specify custom import options for an imported graphics file,
you must use the Place command. However, if you don’t need this level of
control, InDesign offers three other options for importing graphics:
 You can use your computer’s Copy (File➪Copy, or Ô+C or Ctrl+C) and
Paste (File➪Paste, or Ô+V or Ctrl+V) commands to move a graphics file
between two InDesign documents or from a document created with
another program into an InDesign document. If you copy an object in an
InDesign document and then paste it into a different InDesign document,
the copy retains all the attributes of the original, as well as the link to
the original graphics file. Otherwise, a link between the original graphics
file and the InDesign document is not established; the graphic becomes
part of the InDesign document, as though you created it using InDesign
tools.
Figure 18-4:
The Layers
pane of the

Options,

and Place

boxes.
289
Chapter 18: Importing Graphics

 You can drag and drop graphics file icons from your computer’s desktop
into InDesign documents. A link between the original graphics file and
the document is established, just as it would be if you had used the
Place command.
 For Illustrator files, you can drag objects directly from Illustrator into
InDesign. Each object becomes a separate, editable InDesign object, as
though you had created it in InDesign. (And no links are established to
the source file.)
If you use these methods to add a graphic to an InDesign document, some of
the attributes of the original graphic may not survive the trip. The operating
system, the file format, and the capabilities of the originating application all
play roles in determining which attributes are preserved. If you want to be
safe, use the Place command.

Chapter 19
Fitting Graphics and Setting Paths
In This Chapter
 Cropping and positioning graphics
 Fitting graphics into frames and vice versa
 Working with graphics in irregular shapes
 Using clipping paths
A
fter you import a graphic into an InDesign document, you can modify
either the graphic or the frame that contains it. The most common
actions you’ll take are cropping, repositioning, and resizing. Cropping is a
fancy term for deciding what part of the picture to show by altering the
dimensions of the frame holding the graphic. Repositioning is essentially the
same as cropping, except that you move the graphic within its frame. And if
you want to get really fancy, you might work with clipping paths to create
“masks” around picture portions or even cut the graphic into pieces.
Transformations such as resizing, flipping, rotating, and skewing that you’re
likely to apply to graphics use the same tools for graphics as for any InDesign
objects. So I cover all these transformations in one place, in Chapter 9.
In almost every case, you select graphics with the Direct Selection tool to
work with the graphic itself, rather than to the frame. If you use the Selection
tool, the work you do will apply to the frame, as Chapter 12 explains.
Cropping and Repositioning
Remember, when you import a graphic using the Place command (File➪Place,
or Ô+D or Ctrl+D) or by dragging a graphics file into a document window, the
graphic is contained in a graphics frame — either the frame that was selected
when you placed the graphic or the frame that was automatically created if a
frame wasn’t selected. The upper-left corner of an imported graphic is auto-
matically placed in the upper-left corner of its frame.

The easiest way to crop a graphic is to resize the frame that contains it using
the Selection or Position tool. To discover how to resize the frame, go to
Chapter 9. Note that resizing the frame does not resize the graphic.
You can also click on a graphic with the Direct Selection tool, and then drag
the graphic within its frame to reveal and conceal different parts of the
graphic. For example, you could crop the top and left edges of a graphic by
dragging the graphic above and to the left of its original position (in the
upper-left corner of the frame).
You can also crop using the X+ and Y+ options in the Control panel and
Transform panel; this is more precise than using the mouse. The advantage of
moving the image within the frame is that you don’t have to move the frame
from its desired position in the layout.
If you want to mask out (hide) portions of an imported graphic, you have the
option of using an irregular shape as the frame, a graphic’s built-in clipping
path (if it has one), or a clipping path you generated in InDesign, as covered
later in this chapter.
Figuring out the Fitting Commands
If you’ve placed a graphic in a frame that’s either larger or smaller than the
graphic, you can use the Fitting options (available by choosing Object➪
Fitting or by using the appropriate iconic buttons in the Control panel) to
scale the graphic to fit the frame proportionately or disproportionately or to
scale the frame to fit the graphic. Another option lets you center the graphic
in the frame. These are very handy, and a lot easier than trying to resize a
graphic or frame to fit using the mouse or the Control panel.
Keep in mind that the fitting commands for graphics are available only if
you’ve used the Selection or Position tool to select a graphic’s frame. Here’s a
description of each of the six options:
 Fit Content to Frame: To scale a graphic to fill the selected frame,
choose Object➪Fitting➪Fit Content to Frame or press Option+Ô+E 
or Ctrl+Alt+E. If the frame is larger than the graphic, the graphic is
enlarged; if the frame is smaller, the graphic is reduced. If the graphic
and the frame have different proportions, the graphic’s proportions are
changed so that the image completely fills the frame — this can distort
the graphic’s appearance.
292
Part V: Graphics Essentials 

 Fit Frame to Content: To resize a frame so that it wraps snugly around a
graphic, choose Fit Frame to Content or press Option+Ô+C or Ctrl+Alt+C.
The frame will be enlarged or reduced depending on the size of the
graphic, and the frame’s proportions will be changed to match the 
proportions of the graphic.
 Center Content: To center a graphic in its frame, choose Center Content
or press Shift+Ô+E or Ctrl+Shift+E. Neither the frame nor the graphic is
scaled when you center a graphic.
 Fit Content Proportionally: To scale a graphic to fit in the selected
frame while maintaining the graphic’s current proportions, choose
Object➪Fitting➪Fit Content Proportionally or press Option+Shift+Ô+E
or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+E. If the frame is larger than the graphic, the graphic is
enlarged; if the frame is smaller, the graphic is reduced. If the graphic
and the frame have different proportions, a portion of the frame back-
ground will show above and below or to the left and right of the graphic.
If you want, you can drag frame edges to make the frame shorter or nar-
rower and eliminate any portions of the background that are visible.
 Fill Frame Proportionally: To resize a frame to fit the selected 
graphic, choose Object➪Fitting➪Fill Frame Proportionally or press
Option+Shift+Ô+C or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+C. This guarantees that there will be
no space between the graphic and the frame. (The Fit Frame to Content
option can result in such space at the bottom and/or right sides of a
graphic.)
 Frame Fitting Options: To control the default fitting for newly placed
graphics, use the new Frame Fitting Options dialog box, shown in Fig-
ure 19-1. Here you can set the amount of crop, choose the control point
for the imported graphic (see Chapter 1), and automatically apply your
choice of the Fit Content to Frame, Fit Content Proportionally, and Fill
Frame Proportionally options.
For frames with strokes, the Fitting options align the outer edge of a graphic
with the center of the stroke. A stroke obscures a strip along the graphic’s
edge that’s half the width of the stroke. The wider the stroke, the more of the
graphic that gets covered up.
You can also use the frame-fitting iconic buttons in the Control panel, shown
in Figure 19-2. But note that these may not display in your Control panel; by
default, InDesign shows them only if your monitor is set to a resolution
whose width is 1,280 or more pixels. You can make room for them at smaller
resolutions by customizing the Control panel display: choose Customize from
the panel’s flyout menu and then deselect some of the Object controls to
make room.

Chapter 19: Fitting Graphics and Setting Paths

Working with Graphics 
in Irregular Shapes
Although most graphics you use will be placed in rectangular frames,
InDesign does give you other choices:
 You can select any type of frame — oval or polygonal, not just
rectangular — to place or copy your graphic into.
 You can draw your own shape using the Pencil or Pen tool and then
place or copy your graphic into it. When you create the free-form shape,
make sure that the default color for the Pen tool is set to None so that
the shape you create is transparent. Otherwise, the colored area in the
shape will obscure the graphic behind it.
The Pen tool lets you create one shape at a time. The Compound Paths
command lets you combine multiple shapes to create more complex
objects. For example, you can place a small circle on top of a larger
circle, and then use the Compound Paths command to create a doughnut-
shaped object. (This is an expert feature not covered in this book.)

Part V: Graphics Essentials 

If you copy the graphic into a frame or shape, you must use the Paste
Into command (Edit➪Paste Into, or Option+Ô+V or Ctrl+Alt+V) to place
the copied graphic inside the selected shape, rather than on top of it.
 You can use a clipping path that was defined in the graphic itself when it
was created or a clipping path that was created in InDesign.
So what is a clipping path, anyway? A clipping path is used to mask certain
parts of a graphic and reveal other parts; it’s basically an invisible outline
placed in the graphic that InDesign can then work with. For example, if you
want to create a silhouette around a single person in a crowd, open the file in
an image-editing program such as Photoshop, and then create and save a
clipping path that isolates the shape of the person. (You can also erase every-
thing except the person you want to silhouette; this can be time-consuming,
and if you want to reveal other parts of the graphic later, you’re out of luck.)
TIFF, Photoshop EPS, and Photoshop-native (.PSD) files can have embedded
clipping paths.
Regardless of the method you use to clip an imported graphic, you can
modify a clipping path by moving, adding, deleting, and changing the 
direction of anchor points and by moving direction lines.
You can convert a clipping path — whether imported or created in InDesign —
to a frame by choosing Convert Clipping Path to Frame for a selected object
using the contextual menu (right-click or Control+click the object).
See the Photoshop For Dummies series (Wiley Publishing) for more on creat-
ing clipping paths in Photoshop.
Using a graphic’s own clipping path
In an ideal world, any graphics that you want to have fit in an irregular shape
will come with their own clipping paths. In that wonderful situation, you
would first be sure to import the clipping path when you place the graphic
and then use InDesign’s Text Wrap panel to access that clipping path.
The steps are easy:
1. Be sure to select the Show Import Options check box in the Place
dialog box (File➪Place, or Ô+D or Ctrl+D) when you import the
graphic and select the Apply Photoshop Clipping Path option in the
Image Import Options dialog box.
2. Open the Text Wrap panel (Window➪Text Wrap, or Option+Ô+W or
Ctrl+Alt+W).
295
Chapter 19: Fitting Graphics and Setting Paths

3. Select the graphic.
4. Click the Wrap Around Object Shape iconic button (the third one from
the left) at the top of the Text Wrap panel.
5. If you want, adjust the space between the surrounding text and the
obstructing shape by typing values in the Top Offset field.
6. Now select the clipping source from the Type pop-up menu in the
Contour Options section of the Text Wrap panel. Choose from two rel-
evant options:
• Alpha Channel uses the image’s alpha channel, if any, to create a
wrapping boundary. (An alpha channel is another type of clipping
path and is also created in the source program such as
Photoshop.)
• Photoshop Path uses the image’s clipping path, if any, to create a
wrapping boundary. Use the Path pop-up menu to select which
path to use, if your image has more than one embedded clipping
path.
See Chapter 12 for the basics of text wraps.
Creating a clipping path in InDesign
If you import a graphic that doesn’t have a clipping path, you have two sets
of options for creating a clipping path.
The easiest is to use the Text Wrap panel as described in the previous section
but to instead choose one of the following options from the Type pop-up
menu:
 Detect Edges tries to determine the graphic’s outside boundary by
ignoring white space — you would use this for bitmapped images that
have a transparent or white background.
 Same as Clipping uses the clipping path for the graphic created in
InDesign — you would use this when the desired clipping path can’t 
be created through the Detect Edges option. (I cover this method of 
clipping-path creation shortly.)
You can further modify the clipping path by selecting the graphic with the
Direct Selection tool. The text-wrap boundary appears as a blue line — you
can make the boundary easier to select by setting offsets in the Text Wrap
pane, which moves the boundary away from the frame edge.
296
Part V: Graphics Essentials 

A slightly more difficult way to create a clipping path — but one that 
gives you more control — is to use the Clipping Path command (Object➪
Clipping Path➪Options, or Option+Shift+Ô+K or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+K) to generate
one automatically:
1. Select the graphic to which you want to add a clipping path.
It’s best to use the Direct Selection tool, so that you can see the clipping
path within the frame as you work.
2. Choose Object➪Clipping Path➪Options, or press Option+Shift+Ô+K 
or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+K.
The Clipping Path dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 19-3.
3. To have InDesign detect the likely boundary of the image, as opposed
to a white or other light background, choose Detect Edges from the
Type pop-up menu.
You can use the other options to select Alpha Channel or Photoshop
Path as the clipping path for graphics that have one or more of these.
(InDesign can only use one alpha channel or Photoshop path as the clip-
ping path, so use the Path pop-up menu to choose the one you want.)
4. Type a value in the Threshold field or click and drag the field’s slider
to specify the value below which pixels will be placed outside the 
clipping path shape (that is, pixels that will become transparent).
Pixels darker than the Threshold value remain visible and thus are
inside the clipping path shape. The lowest possible Threshold value (0)
makes only white pixels transparent. As the value gets higher, less of the
graphic remains visible. The lightest areas are removed first, then mid-
tones, and so on. (Select the Preview option to see the results of your
changes without closing the dialog box.)
5. Type a value in the Tolerance field.
This value determines how closely InDesign looks at variations in adja-
cent pixels when building a clipping path. Higher values produce a 
simpler, smoother path than lower values. Lower values create a more
complicated, more exact path with more anchor points.
6. If you want to enlarge or reduce the size of the clipping path pro-
duced by the Threshold and Tolerance values, type a value in the
Inset Frame field.
Negative values enlarge the path; positive values shrink it. (The Inset
Frame value is also applied to the path’s bounding box.)
7. Select the Invert option to switch the transparent and visible areas of
the clipping path produced by the Threshold and Tolerance values.
297
Chapter 19: Fitting Graphics and Setting Paths

8. If you want to include light areas in the perimeter shape InDesign 
generates based on the Threshold and Tolerance values, select the
Include Inside Edges option.
For example, if you have a graphic of a doughnut and you want to make
the hole transparent (as well as the area around the outside of the
doughnut), click Include Inside Edges. If you don’t click Include Inside
Edges, InDesign builds a single shape (in the case of a doughnut, just the
outside circle). The portion of the graphic in the shape remains visible;
the rest of the graphic becomes transparent.
9. Select the Restrict to Frame option if you want InDesign to generate a
clipping path from just the portion of the graphic visible in the
graphic frame, as opposed to the entire graphic (such as if you
cropped the graphic).
10. Select the Use High Resolution Image option if you want InDesign to
use the high-resolution information in the original file instead of using
the low-resolution proxy image.
Even though using the high-resolution image takes longer, the resulting
clipping path is more precise than it would be if you didn’t check Use
High Resolution Image.
11. When you’ve finished specifying clipping path settings, click OK to
close the dialog box and apply the settings to the selected graphic.
If you use the Clipping Path command to generate a clipping path for a
graphic that has a built-in clipping path, the one that InDesign generates
replaces the built-in path.
Figure 19-3:
The Clipping
Path dialog
box.
298
Part V: Graphics Essentials 

Figure 19-4 shows a graphic before and after a clipping path was applied to it
using the Clipping Path command. At left is a graphic of coastal France with a
graphic of a glider superimposed. At right is the same set of graphics, but
with a clipping path applied to the glider so the outside area is masked out,
making it transparent.
The Clipping Path command works very well for images that have a white or
light background but no clipping path. It’s less useful for graphics with back-
grounds that contain a broad range of intermingling values.
You can remove a clipping path by choosing None as the Type in the Clipping
Path dialog box. You can also select a different path — Detect Edges, Alpha
Channel, Photoshop Path, or User-Modified Path — than was selected previ-
ously if you decide to change the current clipping path.
InDesign lets you convert a clipping path into a frame, so you get the exact
shape as your clipping path to use as a container or silhouette in your layout.
Select the clipping path with the Direct Selection tool and choose Object➪
Clipping Path➪Convert Clipping Path to Frame. It’s as easy as that!

icrosoft Word, move over. It used to be that a word
processor did all the business-y stuff like footnotes,
tables, tables of contents, indexing, and mail-merge. Not
anymore. Over the years, like a slow-moving movie mon-
ster nonetheless catching up with the terrorized teens,
more and more of these business functions have found
their way into InDesign. This version has even more such
features, such as text variables.
This part shows you how to suit up your documents. But

Working with Tabs and Tables
In This Chapter
 Setting tabs
 Creating tables
 Adjusting tables
 Formatting tables
 Using table and cell styles
 Converting text to tables, and vice versa
P
erhaps the most common business-oriented formatting done in InDesign
involves tabular material, whether financial tables or simple comparative
feature lists. InDesign provides two methods for creating tabular material: old-
fashioned tabs and more sophisticated tables. Although you can create tables
with tabs, you have less control over the formatting and thus can create just
basic tables when you use tabs. On the other hand, for simple tables, using
tabs is often the faster method. So don’t feel you should never use tabs — but
do be sure that when you mix methods that you don’t let visual consistency
suffer as a result.
Tabs and tables in InDesign work somewhat like the same functions in
Microsoft Word, so if you’re familiar with Word’s tabs and tables, it’ll be a
quick adjustment to InDesign’s, at least for the basic capabilities.
Setting Tabs
To set tabs in InDesign, you use the Tabs panel, which floats above your text
so that you can keep it open until you’re finished experimenting with tabs. To
open the Tabs panel, choose Type➪Tabs or press Shift+Ô+T or Ctrl+Shift+T.
Figure 20-1 shows the Tabs panel along with a simple table created using one
tab stop.
In InDesign CS3, you can no longer access the Tabs panel by choosing
Window➪Type & Tables➪Tabs.

You can also set up tabs in the Tabs pane of the New Paragraph Styles and
Paragraph Style Options dialog boxes, so tabs are consistently applied to all
paragraphs. Chapter 14 covers styles in more detail.
Four buttons — Left, Center, Right, and Align On — on the Tabs panel let you
control how the text aligns with the tab you’re creating. The Align On option
is usually used for decimal tabs, which means that a period in the text aligns
on the tab stop. But you can align on any character, not just periods —
simply specify the align-on character in the Align On field. (If you enter 
nothing in the Align On field, InDesign assumes you want to align to periods.)
If the Align On field is not visible in the Tabs panel, just widen the panel by
dragging one of its sides so the field displays.
The X: field of the Tabs panel lets you specify a position for a new tab stop.
You can type a value in this field in 0.01-point increments, and then press
Shift+Enter or Shift+Return to create a tab. InDesign positions tabs relative 
to the left edge of the text frame or column.
Rather than typing values in the X: field, you can position tabs by clicking 
at the desired location on the ruler at the bottom of the Tabs panel. You can
also drag tab stops within the ruler to change their position. And you can
reposition left and right indents and indent hangs using the arrow sliders 
on the tab ruler. (These have the same effects as changing indents using the
Paragraph panel or Paragraph Styles panel, as explained in Chapter 15.)
To have the Tabs panel “snap” to your text frame, so you can see exactly
where the tab stops will be, click the Position Panel Above Text Frame iconic
button (the magnet icon).
If you need a tab flush with the right margin — for example, to position a
dingbat at the end of the story — press Shift+Tab. There’s no need to use the
Tabs panel.

panel, its
flyout menu,

Part VI: Getting Down to Business 

InDesign lets you specify up to eight characters, including special characters
that will repeat to fill any white space. These repeating characters are called
leaders. When you set a leader for a tab stop, the leaders actually fill any
space prior to that tab stop (between the previous text and the tab location).
To spread out the leader characters, type spaces between the characters you
enter. Don’t enter spaces before and after a single character though, as that
will result in two spaces between the characters when the pattern repeats
(unless that’s the look you’re going for).
In addition to setting tabs in the Tabs panel, InDesign provides four addi-
tional options through its flyout menu: Clear All and Repeat Tab.
 The Clear All command deletes any tabs you’ve created, and any text
positioned with tabs reverts to the position of the default tab stops.
(You can delete an individual tab stop by dragging its icon off the ruler.)
 The Delete Tab command deletes the currently selected tab (just click it
in the tab ruler).
You can also delete tabs by dragging them off the tab ruler using the
mouse.
 The Repeat Tab command lets you create a string of tabs across the ruler
that are all the same distance apart. When you select a tab on the ruler
and choose this command, InDesign measures the distance between the
selected tab and the previous tab (or, if it’s the first tab on the ruler, the
distance between the selected tab and the left indent/text inset). The pro-
gram then uses this distance to place new tabs, with the same alignment,
all the way across the ruler. InDesign repeats tabs only to the right of the
selected tab, but it inserts tabs between other tab stops.
 The Reset Indents command removes any changes to the left indent,
right indent, or indent hang settings defined in the paragraph style 
currently applied to the text.
Setting Up Tables
You can create tables using tabs. But the more complex the table, the more
work that requires. So make your life easier and use InDesign’s table editor,
which lets you specify almost any attribute imaginable in a table through the
Table panel and the Table menu.
InDesign lets you import tables from Microsoft Word, RTF, and Microsoft
Excel files, including some of their cell formatting. Likewise, you can convert
their tables to tabbed text by using the options in the Import Options dialog
box that is accessible when you place a file through the Place dialog box
(File➪Place, or Ô+D or Ctrl+D), as covered in Chapter 12.
305
Chapter 20: Working with Tabs and Tables

To create a table in InDesign, you first create or select a text frame with the
Type tool and then choose Table➪Insert Table or press Option+Shift+Ô+T or
Ctrl+Alt+Shift+T. If you select an existing text frame, the table will be inserted
at the cursor’s location in the existing text.
That produces the Insert Table dialog box, where you type the number of
body rows and columns and the number of header and footer rows. (Header
and footer rows repeat on each page for tables that go across multiple
pages.) Click OK to have InDesign create the basic table, which will be set as
wide as the text frame. The depth will be based on the number of rows, with
each row defaulting to the height that will hold 12-point text.
You can also apply a table style to the new table by selecting one from the Table
Style pop-up menu. I cover how to create these styles later in this chapter.
With the basic table in place, you now format it using the Table panel and the
Table menu. In both, you can increase or decrease the number of rows and
columns, set the row and column height, set the text’s vertical alignment
within selected cells (top, middle, bottom, and justified), choose one of four
text-rotation angles, and set the text margin within a cell separately for the
top, bottom, left, and right. Note that all the Table panel’s options affect only
the currently selected cells, except for the Number of Rows and Number of
Columns fields. Figure 20-2 shows the Table panel and its flyout menu. Figure
20-3 shows an example table created using these tools.
If you have a smallish monitor, set at 1024 by 768 pixels — the norm for a 
17-inch display — the Table, Table Styles, and Cell Styles panels are shoved
to the bottom of the panel dock, and, when they’re selected, the only thing
you’ll see is their panel tab and flyout menu icon. You have a few choices:
Shorten other panel groups in the dock to make room for them, remove other
panel groups to make room for them, or drag them out of the dock and make
them floating.
You set cell text’s horizontal alignment using the paragraph formatting con-
trols covered in Chapter 15. You can apply character formatting to cell text as
described in Chapter 16. You can also apply tabs within cells using the Tabs
panel covered earlier in this chapter.
To add items to a table, you can type text in any cell, paste text or graphics
into a cell, or place text or graphics into a cell by choosing File➪Place or
pressing Ô+D or Ctrl+D.
InDesign CS3 lets you paste tabbed text into tables. The tabs are retained,
and all the text is pasted into the same cell.
306
Part VI: Getting Down to Business 

Adjusting tables
InDesign lets you add and delete rows and columns, as well as split and join
cells using the Insert, Delete, Merge, and Split commands in the Table menu
and in the Table panel’s flyout menu. You can also select rows, columns, and
entire tables using the Table menu. There are also several shortcuts, shown
in Table 20-1, to speed things along if you are a keyboard-oriented person.
These commands work intuitively, so I won’t bore you with detailed explana-
tions here. For example, to delete a row, select it or a cell within it using the

Formatting tables
For more sophisticated table attributes, use the Table Options dialog box and
its five panes (choose Table➪Table Options and then the desired pane from
the submenu. To go straight to the Table Setup pane, you can also just press
Option+Shift+Ô+B or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+B.) You’ll see the Table Setup pane,
shown in Figure 20-4. If you want to go straight to one of the four other panes,
you can do so by choosing the desired pane in the submenu after choosing
Table➪Table Options.
When formatting tables, take advantage of the Preview option in most dialog
boxes to see the effects of your changes before committing to them.
If you select more than one cell — meaning the entire cell, not just some of 
its contents — the Control panel’s options change to display many of the 
controls available in the Table panel, as well as some cell-oriented controls
such as setting cell boundary line weights and line types.
Here are some of the basics to keep in mind:
 The Table Setup pane lets you change the number of rows and columns,
as well as footer rows and columns. You also can specify the table
308
Part VI: Getting Down to Business 

border, color, line type, and even tint. Use the Table Spacing options to
have space automatically added before and after a table that is in the
same text frame as other text.
 The Row Strokes pane, shown in Figure 20-5, lets you decide how 
often rows have an alternating pattern of strokes applied to them. For
example, you may want every third row to have a thicker stroke than 
the first and second rows, because each set of three rows is related to
each other and the third row marks the end of that set. You choose how
many rows you want the special stroke to skip before being applied in
the Alternating Pattern pop-up menu, and then use the rest of the con-
trols to choose the stroke weight, color, type, and so on.
 The Column Strokes pane works just like the Row Strokes pane, except 
it lets you alternate the strokes across columns rather than rows.
 The Fills pane works like the Row Strokes pane and Column Strokes
pane, except that it applies a fill to the cells in the specified series 
of rows or columns. The reason that there is just one pane for fills but
two for strokes is that you can’t have both row fills and column fills
automatically applied to the same table — that would usually make 
for a hard-to-read checkerboard. Of course, you could use horizontal 
fills to accentuate rows and use strokes on columns to help keep them
visually separate.
 The Headers and Footers pane lets you change the number of header
and footer rows — just like the Table Setup pane — but it also lets you
control how often the header and/or footer rows repeat: Every Text
Column, Once Per Frame, or Once Per Page.
Figure 20-4:
The Table
Setup pane
of the Table
Options
dialog box.
309
Chapter 20: Working with Tabs and Tables

InDesign also provides formatting controls over cells, using the Cell Options
dialog box. (Choose Table➪Cell Options and then one of the four desired
panes: Text, Strokes and Fills, Rows and Columns, and Diagonal Lines. You
can go straight to the Text pane by pressing Option+Ô+B or Ctrl+Alt+B.) After
you selected the cells you want to format, use the various panes as desired:
 The Text pane works very much like the General pane of the Text Frame
Options dialog box (covered in Chapter 15). Here, you set how far text is
inset from the cell boundaries, how text is vertically aligned within the
cell, and where the text baseline begins within the cell. Unique to cells,
you can also specify whether the cell grows to fit the text automatically
(by unchecking Clip Contents to Cell) and the degree of text rotation (0,
90, 180, and 270 degrees).
 The Strokes and Fills pane, shown in Figure 20-6, lets you set the stroke
and fill for selected cells. You can select which cell boundaries to apply
a stroke to, by selecting the sides from the preview image at the top of
the pane and then choosing the desired options. You can also set the
desired fill color and tint.
 The Rows and Columns pane lets you set the row height, including its
maximum for rows that are allowed to expand automatically as specified
in the Text pane, as well as the column width. You also can specify
which rows must be kept together and if certain rows should start at a
new page, frame, or column.
You can also adjust column and row heights by dragging on the row and
column boundaries with the mouse.
Figure 20-5:

Options

Part VI: Getting Down to Business 

 The Diagonal Lines pane lets you place three types of diagonal lines within
cells — upper left to lower right, lower right to upper left, or both — and
then specify the stroke weight, type, color, and tint. You can also choose
whether the diagonal lines overprint the cell contents or vice versa. To
remove a diagonal line, just click the No Diagonal Lines iconic button.
Using table and cell styles
To make it easy to apply and update table formatting across a document,
InDesign CS3 adds table and cell styles. They work like paragraph, character,
and object styles, taking the table formatting features covered earlier in this
section and bringing them together into the New Table Style and New Cell
Style dialog boxes.
To work with table styles, open the Table Styles panel by choosing Window➪
Type & Tables➪Table Styles. To work with cell styles, open the Cell Styles
panel by choosing Window➪Type & Tables➪Cell Styles. Choose New Table
Style or New Cell Style from the appropriate panel’s flyout menu, and then
use the various panes to specify the desired formatting. The panes, and their
options, are the same as described in the previous section, “Formatting
tables.” Figure 20-7 shows the New Table Style dialog box’s General pane.
Whether creating a new table style or a new cell style, the easiest method is
to format an existing table or cell the way you want it, select it, then create a
new table or cell style — InDesign will pick up the existing formatting for the
new style. Otherwise, you’ll have to specify everything in the New Table Style
or New Cell Style dialog box, where it’s harder to see the effects of your set-
tings. (Even if you enable the Preview option, the dialog boxes are fairly large
and tend to obscure most of your document.)

Chapter 20: Working with Tabs and Tables

There are a few notes about creating table and cell styles — in the General
pane of the New Table Style and New Cell Style dialog boxes — that you
should know before getting too far into them:
 You give each style its own name. Choose names that will make sense a
week or a month later, so you know what they are meant to be used for!
 You can base a new table style on an existing one, so changes to the
parent style are automatically reflected in the children styles based on it.
 You can assign a keyboard shortcut to styles you use frequently.
When creating table styles, you can also have the table style automatically
apply the cell styles of your choosing to the following table elements: header
rows, footer rows, body rows, the leftmost column, and the rightmost column.
When creating cell styles, you can choose a paragraph style to be automati-
cally applied to text in cells using the style.
To apply styles to selected tables or cells, just choose the desired style from
the Table Style or Cell Style panel. To override existing formatting, use the
options indicated for paragraph and character styles described in Chapter 13.
Modifying and managing 
table and cell styles
Modifying styles is easy: Double-click the style name in the Table Styles or
Cell Styles panel. This opens the Table Style Options or Cell Style Options
dialog box, which is identical to the New Table Styles or New Cell Styles

InDesign also lets you manage your styles, such as creating groups of styles
to make it easier to find relevant ones, and bringing in styles from other docu-
ments. Because these features work the same for paragraph and character
styles as well, I’ve covered these features in Chapter 14.
Converting Tabs to Tables (and Back)
Often, you’ll have a table done using tabs — whether imported from a word
processor or originally created in InDesign with tabs — that you want to con-
vert to a real InDesign table. That’s easy. Select the tabbed text you want to
convert using the Type tool and choose Table➪Convert Text to Table.
In the Convert Text to Table dialog box, you can choose a Column Separator
(Tab, Comma, Paragraph, or a text string you type in the field) or a Row
Separator (same options). Although most textual data uses tabs to separate
columns and paragraphs to separate rows, you may encounter other data
that uses something else. For example, spreadsheets and databases often
save data so that commas, rather than tabs, separate columns. That’s why
InDesign lets you choose the separator characters before conversion.
During the conversion, InDesign formats the table using the standard set-
tings, using the current text formatting and the default cell insets and stroke
types. You can then adjust the table using the tools covered earlier in this
chapter. Note that the conversion treats all rows as body rows.
You can also convert a table to text by selecting multiple cells or an entire
table, as described earlier, and choosing Table➪Convert Table to Text.
InDesign presents the same options as it does in the Convert Text to Table
dialog box, so you can determine how the converted data appears.

In This Chapter
 Adding footnotes
 Generating tables of contents
 Creating indexes
M
any business documents — books, reports, white papers, and so on —
use features traditionally associated with academic book publishing:
footnotes to cite sources, indexes to provide a map to specific content’s loca-
tion in the document, and tables of contents (TOCs) to provide an overview
of the document’s structure and contents.
When you’re working on any type of document — a report, a magazine, 
a textbook — you can easily spend more time manually creating tables of 
contents, keeping footnotes updates, and laboriously managing indexes 
than you spend designing the publication. InDesign helps reduce this labor
while also ensuring that your footnotes, indexes, and tables of content stay
automatically updated as your document is revised.
You can extend the power of these tools to book-length projects composed of
multiple InDesign documents (covered in Chapter 23), creating consistent
indexing and tables of contents in one fell swoop.
Adding Footnotes
Many documents, including academic and technical documents, use foot-
notes. InDesign lets you add footnotes to your document with very little fuss.

You can import footnotes from Microsoft Word files (see Chapter 12), or you
can add footnotes directly in InDesign. With the text-insertion cursor in your
text where you want the footnote marker to appear, choose Type➪Insert
Footnote to add a footnote to the bottom of the column that contains the
footnote marker, as Figure 21-1 shows. You need to manually enter the text
that will go with each numbered footnote, but InDesign updates the footnote
numbering as you add and delete footnotes.
You cannot insert footnotes into tables. But you can simulate footnotes by
adding a superscripted footnote character in the table text and typing your
footnote text below the table — note this “footnote” is not linked to the text,
will not renumber automatically as a real footnote would, and cannot be for-
matted with InDesign’s footnote formatting controls.
You can control much of the appearance of footnotes by choosing Type➪
Document Footnote Options to open the Footnote Options dialog box, shown
in Figure 21-2.
The Numbering and Formatting pane controls the formatting of the footnote
text and footnote character in the current InDesign document. The Layout pane
controls the placement of the footnote relative to the rest of the document.
Figure 21-1:
Inserting a
footnote.
316
Part VI: Getting Down to Business 

Among the features you should note in the Numbering and Formatting 
pane are
 Choose the numbering style — such as 1, 2, 3, 4 ... or I, ii, iii, iv ... — 
via the Style pop-up menu.
 Control whether the footnote numbers start anew (such as at the 
beginning of a section) or continue from the previous number via 
the Start At field.
 Control whether numbering automatically resets every page, spread, 
or section via the Restart Numbering Every pop-up menu.
 Add a prefix and/or suffix to your footnote numbers via the Prefix and
Suffix fields. Note the unnamed pop-up menus that let you add special
characters such as a thin space or bracket.
 Use the Position and Character Style options in the Footnote Reference
Number in Text subsection to determine how the footnote characters
appear in text.
 Similarly, use the Paragraph Style and Separator options in the 
Footnote Formatting subsection to determine how the footnote text
appears. (Note any Separator options will display after any Suffix
options chosen.)

Chapter 21: Working with Footnotes, Indexes, and TOCs

Among the features to note in the Layout pane are
 Set the preferred spacing for the footnote text in the Spacing Options
section.
 Convert Word’s endnotes (which will appear at the end of a story) to
InDesign footnotes (which appear in the column or page that the foot-
note reference occurs in) by checking the Place End of Story Footnotes
at Bottom of Text option.
 Control whether footnotes can break across columns via the Allow Split
Footnotes option. Enabling this option can improve the layout when you
have long footnotes that otherwise eat up a column of text.
 Control the ruling line above footnotes using the Rule Above options.
They work like the paragraph rules covered in Chapter 15.
To change these settings for future documents, open the dialog box while no
document is open and set your new defaults.
Creating Indexes
When trying to locate information in a book, nothing is as wonderful as a
good index. Once upon a time, book indexing was a labor-intensive process
involving piles of index cards. InDesign makes indexing much easier, while
still allowing you to make key decisions about how the index is formatted.
But be warned: Indexing is complicated business and is, by and large, an
expert feature. So I cover just the basics here.
Choosing an indexing style
Before you begin indexing your document, ask yourself the following questions:
 Do you want to initial-cap all levels of all entries, or do you just want
sentence case?
 Should index headings appear in boldface?
 What type of punctuation will you use in your index?
 Will you capitalize secondary entries in the index?
 Should the index be nested or run-in style? (A nested index is an
indented list, with each entry on its own line. A run-in index puts all
related entries in one paragraph, separated by semicolons.)
318
Part VI: Getting Down to Business 

After you make these decisions, it’s a good idea to make a small dummy index.
From the dummy, create a master page for index pages, paragraph styles for
index headings (the letters A, B, C, and so on), paragraph styles for each level
of the index (including indents as appropriate), and character styles for any
special formatting you want on page numbers or cross-reference text.
InDesign doesn’t do any of this for you.
Inside the Index panel
When you want to index a chapter or document, open the Index panel 
by choosing Window➪Type & Tables➪Index or by pressing Shift+F8. Use 
this panel to add words to the index in up to four indent levels, edit or 
delete index entries, or create cross-references. The Index panel is shown 
in Figure 21-3.
Two radio buttons appear at the top of the Index panel: Reference and Topic.
You use Reference mode to add and edit entries from selected text. (Although
it is a well-intentioned feature meant to help standardize index entries, the
Topic mode’s use is not intuitive, and most indexers simply ignore it and add
entries manually from selected text or type phrases into the Index pane in
Reference mode. You should ignore it, too.)

Chapter 21: Working with Footnotes, Indexes, and TOCs

Select the Book check box if you are creating an index for multiple chapters
in a book (see Chapter 23). You must have a book open for this option to be
available. If you have a book open and do not select the Book check box, the
index is saved with the current document and not opened when you open
other chapters of the book.
Adding index items via the Index panel
To add entries to the index, be sure the Type tool is active, then choose New
Page Reference from the Index panel’s flyout menu, or press Ô+U or Ctrl+U,
to get the dialog box shown in Figure 21-4.
If the Type tool is not active when you open the dialog box, the flyout menu
option will be called New Cross-Reference instead, letting you add a cross-
reference entry to the index. The resulting New Cross-Reference dialog box 
is identical to the New Page Reference dialog box, except the various options
default to ones appropriate for a cross-reference.
Here’s how the controls work:
 If you selected text first in your document, the text is entered automati-
cally into Topic Level 1. Otherwise, type in the text that you want to add
to the index. In Figure 21-4, you can see that I typed Platform. The text
will be added to the Topic list and to the list of index entries.
 You can enter text that controls how the entry is sorted in the Sort By
column. For example, if the selected text you’re indexing is The A-Team,
but you want it sorted as if it were A-Team, The (so it appears with the A
entries in the index), enter A-Team, The in the Sorted By column.
Figure 21-4:
The New
Page
Reference
dialog box.
320
Part VI: Getting Down to Business 

 If you want a more complex index, you might want to use some or all of
the four possible entry levels. You may want an index entry to appear
under a higher-level topic. For example, you may want Border Collies to
appear in the index under Herding Dogs, in which case you would enter
Herding Dogs the Topic Level 1 field and Border Collies in the Topic
Level 2 field. In Figure 21-4, I entered wireless in the Topic Level 2 field.
 Use the Type pop-up menu to determine the page entries for the index
entry. For instance, if you select To End of Section, the page numbers for
the selected text in the index will cover the range from the index entry
to the end of the section it is in.
 To add just the selected text as an index entry, click Add. (If no text 
is selected, the text will be added to the Topic list, but no index entry
will appear for it.) To add all occurrences of the text in the book, click
Add All.
 To change previously defined index entries, select an entry and then
choose Page Reference Options in the Index panel’s flyout menu.
 At the bottom of the New Page Reference dialog box is a list of letters 
as well as the entry Symbols (where entries that begin with numbers
and other non-letter characters will be grouped in the index). You can
scroll through this list of headings to see what is already in the index
under each letter. Although you might think clicking a letter would force
the current index entry to appear in that letter’s section of the index, it
does not.
To quickly add a word or text selection to an index, highlight the text and
press Ô+U or Ctrl+U to add the text to the New Page Reference dialog box. 
To index a word without opening that dialog box, just press Option+Shift+Ô+[
or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+[. This adds the text to the index using the index’s default
settings. (You can always edit them later.) And to enter an index entry as a
proper name (last name, first name), use the shortcut Option+Shift+Ô+] or
Ctrl+Alt+Shift+].
Polishing and generating the index
The Index panel’s flyout menu has several options useful for generating and
fine-tuning an index:
 Duplicate Topic lets you duplicate a topic entry so you can use the 
settings from one entry without having to re-enter those settings in 
a new entry.
 Delete Topic removes a topic (and any associated entries) from the index.
321
Chapter 21: Working with Footnotes, Indexes, and TOCs

 Import Topics lets you import topic lists from other InDesign documents.
 Go to Selected Marker causes InDesign to jump to the text that contains
the selected index entry in the Index panel.
 Topic Options lets you edit the Level and Sort By settings for topic
entries; these affect all index entries that use them.
 Capitalize lets you standardize the capitalization of topic entries — you
can choose Selected Topic, Selected Topic and All Subtopics, All Level 1
Topics, and All Topics.
 Update Preview updates the index entries in the Index panel to reflect
page-number changes, new occurrences of index text occurrences, and
deleted occurrences of indexed text.
 Generate Index creates the index via the dialog box shown in Figure 21-5.
In this dialog box, you specify the following: a title for the index, the para-
graph style for that title, whether a selected index is replaced with the
new one, whether an entire book is indexed, whether text on hidden
layers is indexed, whether the index is nested or run-in, whether empty
index headings and sections are included, what paragraph styles are
applied to each level of index entry, what character styles are applied to
different portions of index entries, and which characters will be used as
separators within index entries. (Click the More Options button to see
the nested/run-in and later options.) After you generate an index, you 
get the standard InDesign loaded-text icon (the paragraph icon); click 
an existing text frame into which you want to flow the index, or click 
anywhere else in a document to have InDesign create the text frame 
for you and flow the index text into it.

Part VI: Getting Down to Business 

Creating Tables of Contents
A table of contents (TOC) is useful in a long document because it helps read-
ers locate information quickly. A TOC is simply a list of paragraphs that are
formatted with the same styles. This means that if you want to use the table
of contents feature, you have to use paragraph styles. Not only do styles
guarantee consistent formatting, but they also tell InDesign what text you
want to include in your TOC.
After you’ve created a book (or even a single document), InDesign can build a
table of contents by scanning pages for the paragraph styles you specify. For
example, if you create a book, you might use paragraph styles named Chapter
Title, Section, and Subsection. Using the table of contents feature, InDesign
can generate a table of contents that includes all three levels.
TOC styles manage the text that you want in a table of contents, the order in
which it appears, how page numbers are added, and how the various TOC
elements are formatted. To create a TOC style, choose Layout➪Table of
Contents Styles, which opens the dialog box shown in Figure 21-6.
In the Table of Contents Styles dialog box, click New to create a new TOC
style. You can also edit an existing TOC style via the Edit button, delete one
via the Delete button, and import one from another InDesign document via
the Load button.
Here’s how to create a TOC style after clicking the New button:
1. Enter a name for the TOC style in the TOC Style field (shown in 
Figure 21-7).
The default is TOC Style 1.
Figure 21-6:
The Table of
Contents
Styles
dialog box.
323
Chapter 21: Working with Footnotes, Indexes, and TOCs

2. In the Title field, enter a heading for the TOC.
This text appears in your table of contents.
If you don’t want a title, leave the Title field blank, but note that you still
get an empty paragraph at the top of your TOC for this title. You can
always delete that paragraph.
3. Use the Style pop-up menu to choose the paragraph style that this title
will have.
4. In the Styles in Table of Contents section, click a paragraph style that
you want to appear in your TOC from the Other Styles list at right.
For example, you might click Chapter Title.
5. Click Add to add it to the Include Paragraph Styles list at left. 
(Select a style from the Include Paragraph Styles section and 
click Remove to remove any paragraph styles you don’t want to 
be used in the TOC.)
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 until you have added all the paragraph styles
that you want to include in the TOC.
7. Use the Entry Style pop-up menu to select a TOC level and then
choose the paragraph formatting for that style.
If the Entry Style, Page Number, and other options don’t display, click
the More Options button to see them.

Contents

324
Part VI: Getting Down to Business 

• Use the Page Number pop-up menu to determine how page num-
bers are handled: After Entry, Before Entry, and No Page Number. 
If you want the page numbers to have a character style applied,
choose that style from the Style pop-up menu to the right of the
Page Number pop-up menu.
• Use the Between Entry and Number field and pop-up menu to
choose what appears between the TOC text and the page number.
You can enter any characters you want; use the pop-up menu to
select special characters such as bullets and tabs. In most cases,
you should select a tab; the paragraph style selected earlier for 
the TOC entry includes leader information, such as having a string
of periods between the text and the number. You can also apply a
character style to the characters between the text and the page
numbers via the Style pop-up menu at right.
• To sort entries at this level alphabetically, such as for a list of 
products in a brochure, select the Sort Entries in Alphabetical
Order check box.
• To change the level of the current TOC entry, use the Level pop-up
menu. If you change the level of entries, InDesign will correctly sort
them when it creates the TOC, even if the levels seem out of order
in the Include Paragraph Styles list.
• In the Options section of the dialog box, choose the appropriate
options. Check Create PDF Bookmarks if you’re exporting the docu-
ment to PDF format and want the PDF TOC file to have bookmarks
(a clickable set of TOC links). Check Run-in if you want all entries
at the same level to be in one paragraph. (This is not common for
TOCs but is used in indexes and lists of figures.) Check Replace
Existing Table of Contents if you want InDesign to automatically
replace an existing TOC if the TOC style is changed. Check Include
Text on Hidden Layers if you want text on hidden layers to be
included in the TOC. Check Include Book Documents if you have 
a book open and want InDesign to generate a TOC based on all
chapters in that book. (InDesign will show the current open book’s
name.) Finally, control whether numbers are included in the table
of contents for numbered paragraphs using the new Numbered
Paragraphs pop-up menu.
8. Continue this process for each paragraph style whose text should be
in the TOC.
Note that the order in which you add these styles determines the initial
levels: The first paragraph style added is level 1; the second is level 2,
and so on. But you can change the order by changing the Level setting,
as described earlier.
325
Chapter 21: Working with Footnotes, Indexes, and TOCs

To make changes to a TOC style, go to the Edit Table of Contents Style dialog
box. Choose Layout➪Table of Contents Styles, select the TOC style to edit,
and click Edit.
With a TOC style in place and your document properly formatted with the
paragraph styles that the TOC style will look for when generating a TOC,
you’re ready to have InDesign create the actual TOC for you.
To generate a TOC, choose Layout➪Table of Contents. You get a dialog box
that is identical to the Table of Contents dialog box shown in Figure 21-7. In
this dialog box, you can make changes to the TOC style settings. (If you want
to save those TOC style changes, be sure to click the Save Style button.)
Then click OK to have InDesign generate the TOC. You might also get a dialog
box asking whether you want to include items in overset text (text that didn’t
fit in your document after you placed it) in your TOC. It may take a minute or
two for the program to generate the TOC. (See Chapter 13 for more details on
overset text.)
Be sure you allow enough space (a single text frame, a series of linked text
frames, or one or more empty pages) for the TOC before generating a final
TOC because if you end up adding or deleting pages based on the TOC
length, the TOC will display the old page numbers. To update page number-
ing after flowing a TOC, simply rebuild the TOC by selecting the text frame
holding the TOC and then choosing Layout➪Update Table of Contents.
If you select a text frame, InDesign will place the TOC text in it when you gen-
erate the TOC. If you don’t select a text frame, you see the familiar loaded-
text icon (the paragraph pointer) that you see when you place a text file.
Click a text frame to insert the TOC text in that frame or click in an empty
part of your document to create a text frame in which the TOC text will flow.
The feature that creates TOC is actually a list generator, and you can use it to
create other kinds of lists. Basically, anything that is tagged with a paragraph
style can be used to create a list. For example, if your figure captions all use
their own paragraph style (called Caption Title in this example), you can gen-
erate a list of figures by creating a TOC style that includes just the Caption
Title paragraph style. An InDesign document can have more than one TOC, so
you can include multiple lists in your document.

Chapter 22
Working with Automated Text
In This Chapter
 Setting up automatic page numbers
 Working with section markers
 Setting up text variables
 Setting up hyperlinks for Web pages and PDF files
A
key area of improvement over the years in InDesign is the increased use
of automated text. From the very beginning, InDesign offered automatic
page numbers so your folios and cross-references would reflect the current
pages as your layout changed. Later versions enhanced this with section
markers, which let you create variable names in folios for your section titles.
Still later came the ability to use data files and merge their contents into a
layout to customize your output, similar to how word processors let you cus-
tomize labels with their mail-merge feature. The newest version of InDesign
adds to this mix a new option: variable text, which gives you more flexibility
in where and how you can have InDesign update text automatically through-
out a document based on your specifications.
Altogether, these features have helped InDesign stake significant ground in
reducing the labor and time of manual processes, such as search and replace,
for text that changes predictably throughout the document.
Another type of text variable is the hyperlink — the Web address used in Web
pages and PDF files so users can just click text to be transported to another
page. While the text itself does not change, the underlying hyperlink informa-
tion can change, and InDesign lets you specify and update these hyperlinks
as needed.
Automatic Page Numbers
You’ll often want page references in text — the current page number in a folio,
for example, or the target page number for a “continued on” reference. You
could type in a page number manually on each page of a multipage document,

but that can get old fast. As I mentioned in Chapters 4 and 6, if you’re working
on a multipage document, you should be using master pages. And if you’re
using master pages, you should handle page numbers on document pages by
placing page-number characters on their master pages.
If you want to add the current page number to a page, you can choose Type➪
Insert Special Character➪Markers➪Current Page Number or press Option+
Shift+Ô+N or Ctrl+Shift+Alt+N whenever the Type tool is active and the text-
insertion cursor is flashing. If you move the page or the text frame, the page-
number character is automatically updated to reflect the new page number.
To create “continued on” and “continued from” lines, choose Type➪Insert
Special Character➪Markers➪Next Page Number to have the next page’s
number inserted in your text, or choose Type➪Insert Special Character➪
Markers➪Previous Page Number to have the previous page’s number
inserted. (There are no shortcuts for these complex menu sequences.) That
next or previous page will be the next or previous page in the story, not the
next page in the document.
One flaw in InDesign’s continued-line approach is that the text frames must
be linked for InDesign to know what the next and previous pages are. Thus,
you’re likely to place your continued lines in the middle of your text. But if
the text reflows, so do the continued lines. Here’s a way to avoid that: Create
separate text frames for your continued-on and continued-from text frames.
Now link just those two frames, not the story text. This way, the story text
can reflow as needed without affecting your continued lines.
Using Section Markers
InDesign offers another marker called the section marker that lets you 
insert specific text into your document and update it by just changing 
the marker text.
The section marker is defined as part of a section start (see Chapter 4), and
it’s meant to be used in folios to put in the section name or chapter name.
But you can use it anywhere you want — and for anything you want, not 
just for section or chapter labels.
To define a section marker (there can be only one per section, of course),
open the Pages panel (Window➪Pages, or Ô+F10 or Ctrl+F10) and choose
Numbering & Section Options from the panel’s flyout menu. In the resulting
dialog box, type a text string in the Section Marker field. Then click OK.
To use the marker, have the text insertion point active in whatever text frame
you want to insert it, and then choose Type➪Insert Special Character➪
Markers➪Section Marker. That’s it!
328
Part VI: Getting Down to Business 

Using Text Variables
The section marker was clearly the inspiration for the new text-variable 
feature. Why stop at section markers? With InDesign CS3’s new text variables,
you can define an unlimited number of text variables that InDesign will hap-
pily update across your documents whenever you change them or your
layout does.
Creating text variables
To create a text variable, choose Type➪Text Variables➪Define. You’ll get the
Text Variables dialog box shown in Figure 22-1. It lists existing text variables —
including the seven ones predefined in InDesign: Chapter Number, Creation
Date, File Name, Last Page Number, Modification Date, Output Date, and
Running Header. Any of them that you create will be added to this list.
The source of the number used in the Chapter Number text variable is some-
thing you define as part of a book. For each document in a book, you can
specify its chapter number using the Document Numbering Options dialog
box accessed from the book panel’s flyout menu. Chapter 23 explains books
and how to set the chapter number.
To create a new text variable, click New. You’ll get the New Text Variable
dialog box shown in Figure 22-2. Give the variable a name in the Name field,
and choose the type of variable you want from the Type pop-up menu. Your
choices are the seven predefined types plus Custom Text, which lets you put
in any text of your choosing. (This means you can create more than one vari-
able for, say, File Name or Modification Date. You might do this because you
want them formatted differently in different usage scenarios.)
The options for formatting the chosen type of variable varies based on the
type of variable it is. Three options are available for more than one type of
text variable:
 Text Before and Text After: These two fields — available for all Type
pop-up menu options except Custom Text — let you add any text you
want before or after the variable. For example, you might enter the word
Chapter in the Text Before field for a Chapter Number variable. Note that
both fields have an unnamed pop-up menu to their right from which you
can select a variety of common symbols and spaces.
 Style: This pop-up menu lets you select the style to apply in the Chapter
Number, Running Header (Character Style), and Running Header
(Paragraph Style) text variables.
329
Chapter 22: Working with Automated Text

 Date Format: This field and its associated pop-up menu lets you choose
the desired date and time formats for the Creation Date, Modification
Date, and Output Date text variables. Examples include MM/dd/yy to 
get a date like 05/08/62 and MMMM d, yyyy top get a date like August 15,
1962. Don’t worry about memorizing codes — just pick the desired
options from the pop-up menu instead.
Several other variables have unique options:
 Custom Text: This has the fewest options. Just enter the desired text,
including choosing special characters such as spaces and dashes from
the unnamed pop-up menu to the right of the Text field. That’s the only
field to adjust for this text variable.
 Last Page Number: In addition to the Text Before, Text After, and Style
formatting controls, this type includes one unique control: the Scope
pop-up menu. Here, you choose between Section and Document to tell
InDesign what you mean by last page number: the section’s last page or
the document’s.
 File Name: In addition to Text Before and Text After formatting controls,
this type has two unique check boxes — Include Entire Folder Path and
Include File Extension — to tell InDesign exactly how much of the filename
to include. If both are unchecked, InDesign will include just the core file-
name, such as Jun 07 TOC. Checking the Include Entire Folder Path will
add the file location before the core filename, such as MacintoshHD:
Projects:Jun 07 TOC or C:\Projects\Jun 07 TOC. Checking the
Include File Extension will append the filename extension, such as June
07 TOC.indd.
 Running Header: The formatting options for these two types are the
most complex, as shown in Figure 22-2. The two Running Header menu
options have two options not available to other Type pop-up menu
options:
• Use: This determines which text to use: First on Page uses the first
text on the page that has the specific style applied, while Last on
Page uses the last text on the page that has the specific style
applied.
• Options: Here, you can control whether the punctuation of the
source text is retained or not in the running header (check Delete
End Punctuation to remove it) and whether the running header
overrides the text of the source text’s capitalization (check Change
Case and then choose the appropriate capitalization option: Upper
Case, Lower Case, Title Case, or Sentence Case).
Title case means that the first letter of each word is capitalized, while
Sentence Case means that only the first letter of the first word in each sen-
tence is capitalized.

Chapter 22: Working with Automated Text

You can also import text variables from other documents by clicking Load in
the Text Variables dialog box, and then choosing the document to import the
variables from. After choosing a document, you’ll get the Load Text Variables
dialog box, where you can select which variables are imported and handle
name conflicts.
To get rid of a text variable, select it from the list in the Text Variables dialog
box and click Delete.
To convert a text variable in your document to the actual text, highlight it
and either choose Type➪Text Variables➪Convert Variable to Text or, if you
happen to be in the Text Variables dialog box, click Convert to Text.
Inserting text variables
Inserting text variables in your document uses the same essential process 
as inserting a special character such as a section market, except you use the
Text Variables menu option: Choose Type➪Text Variables➪Insert Variable,
and then choose the desired variable from the submenu. If you happen to 
be in the Text Variables dialog box, click Insert.
Using Hyperlinks
Both Web pages and PDF files can include hyperlinks, the clickable hot spots
that direct a browser to open a new file or page. It’s a whole new way to
deliver related contents through an active cross-reference. And InDesign lets
you add hyperlinks to your documents, so if they are exported to the PDF or
Web formats, those links are clickable.
InDesign uses its Hyperlinks panel (Window➪Interactive➪Hyperlinks) to add,
edit, and delete hyperlinks. In a sense, a hyperlink is a character attribute —
it’s applied to selected text. Figure 22-3 shows the Hyperlinks panel and its
flyout menu.
Creating hyperlinks
Although the process is straightforward, InDesign’s terminology can make it 
a bit confusing on how to start. You first create a hyperlink destination — 
the place a hyperlinks goes to, or its target — by choosing New Hyperlink
Destination from the Hyperlinks panel’s flyout menu. Figure 22-4 shows the
dialog box. You give the destination a name in the Name field and then
choose from one of the three options in the Type menu:
332
Part VI: Getting Down to Business 

 Page. This option lets you specify a specific page in a selected docu-
ment. If you select this option, InDesign provides a Page field in which
you specify the page number to open in the selected document, as well
as the Zoom Setting pop-up menu, which lets you select how the page is
displayed. (Options are Fixed, meaning at the default size in Adobe
Reader; Fit View; Fit in Window; Fit Width; Fit Height; Fit Visible; and
Inherit Zoom, which uses the current zoom setting in Adobe Reader.)
 Text Anchor. This option lets you specify a specific piece of text in the
selected document. This would be the selected text.
 URL. This is a Web page address (the official name is Uniform Resource
Locator), as shown in the New Hyperlink Destination dialog box in
Figure 22-4. If you select this option, InDesign displays the URL field in
which you type the Web address.
With the destinations defined, you can now create the hyperlinks to them
(the hyperlink sources).
To create a hyperlink to another PDF file, you can’t use the New Hyperlink
Destination method. You must use the New Hyperlink method described next.
To create a hyperlink source:
1. Select the text or frame you want to be a hyperlink’s source, and then
choose New Hyperlink from the Hyperlinks panel’s flyout menu.
That opens the New Hyperlink dialog box, as shown in Figure 22-5.
2. Type a name for the hyperlink source.
This lets you apply the same link to more than one location in your 
document — sort of a character style for hyperlinks. If the name already
exists, an error message appears when you click OK — there’s no way to
know ahead of time if the name has already been used in the document.

Part VI: Getting Down to Business 
Links to other documents
The process for linking to other documents
depends on whether those documents are on
the Web or on a CD or internal server.
If you want to create a hyperlink to another doc-
ument, such as on a CD or server, you must do so
in the New Hyperlink Destination dialog box,
using the Page option. You cannot first create a
destination hyperlink. Also, unintuitively, you
must browse for the actual InDesign file to which
you want to link. But the link will be to the PDF
version of that file, which means you must be
sure to create the PDF of that other document
and use the same filename, except for the file-
name extension. For example, if you link to
filename.indd, the link will actually be to
filename.pdf. This approach requires that
you have all the target files in InDesign format —
you cannot link to a specific PDF file created in
another program or by someone whose source
files you don’t have access to.
By contrast, Web links can link to any object
available on a Web server, including PDFs, so you
would simply use a hyperlink to a Web address,
such as http://www.zangogroup.com/
filename.pdf, in the New Hyperlink dialog
box. Note that such Web links cannot be made to
a specific page inside a PDF file, as InDesign
allows when making links from one document to
another as described in the previous paragraph.

3. If the hyperlink is to another InDesign document, you can select that
document by choosing Browse from the Document pop-up menu.
4. Use the Type pop-up menu to determine what you’re hyperlinking to.
You have the same three options as in the New Hyperlink Destination
dialog box’s Type menu — Page, Text Anchor, and URL — as well as All
Types, which, if chosen, displays previously defined hyperlinks in the
document.
5. Use the Name pop-up menu to select a previously defined hyperlink
destination (target) or an anchor.
You can also create a hyperlink to an Unnamed destination by leaving
the Name pop-up menu set to [None]. But I advise against the [None]
method because that hyperlink destination won’t appear in the menu 
for future hyperlink sources, making it hard to modify later.
6. In the Appearance section, you can control how the hyperlink appears
on-screen:
• Use the Type pop-up menu to choose Invisible Rectangle or Visible
Rectangle. The Invisible Rectangle option gives no visual indication
that the text contains a hyperlink, except that the mouse pointer
becomes a hand icon when the reader maneuvers through the 
document. (You would typically pick this option when you’ve used
blue underline as a character attribute for the hyperlink text to
mirror the standard Web way of indicating a hyperlink.) The Visible
Rectangle option puts a box around the text using the four settings
below (they are grayed out if Invisible Rectangle is selected).
• The Highlight pop-up menu lets you choose how the source text 
or frame is highlighted: None, Invert (reserve the foreground and
background colors), Outline (places a line around the source), and
Inset (places a line around the source, but inside any frame stroke;
for text, it’s the same as Outline).
• The Color pop-up menu displays Web-safe colors, as well as any
colors you defined in the document.
• The Width pop-up menu lets you choose the thickness of the line
used in the Outline and Inset options from the Highlight pop-up
menu. The choices are Thin, Medium, and Thick.
• You can choose the type of line in the Style pop-up menu: Solid or
Dashed.
If your text includes a valid hyperlink, such as www.InDesignCentral.com,
you can select it and create a URL hyperlink automatically by choosing New
Hyperlink from URL in the Hyperlinks panel’s flyout menu.
335
Chapter 22: Working with Automated Text

After your hyperlink sources are defined, you can easily apply them by
selecting text and clicking an existing hyperlink source from the Hyperlinks
panel. You can also jump to the source or destination by selecting the desired
hyperlink in the Hyperlinks panel and choosing either Go to Source or Go to
Destination from the flyout menu, or click the Go to Hyperlink Source or Go
to Hyperlink Destination iconic buttons at the bottom of the panel. These
make a handy way to verify the links are correct.
Modifying and deleting hyperlinks
It’s also easy to modify hyperlinks: Choose Hyperlink Options from the
Hyperlinks panel’s flyout menu to open the Hyperlink Options dialog box,
which has the same options as the New Hyperlink dialog box, shown in 
Figure 22-5, to modify the source. Similarly, to modify hyperlink destinations,
choose Hyperlink Destination Options from the palette menu to open the
Hyperlink Destination Options dialog box, and then select the target from 
the Name pop-up menu. The Hyperlink Destination Options dialog box’s
options are the same as the New Hyperlink Destination dialog box shown in
Figure 22-5.
You can change the source text or frame by selecting it, and then clicking the
hyperlink name in the Hyperlinks panel, and finally choosing Reset Hyperlink
from the panel’s flyout menu. To change the target for a hyperlink to an
InDesign document, choose Update Hyperlink from the flyout menu (press
and hold Option or Alt to select a file that is not open).
To delete a hyperlink target, choose it in the Hyperlink Destination Options
dialog box, and then click Delete. (Click Delete All to delete all targets defined
in the document.)

Part VI: Getting Down to Business 

To delete a hypertext source, select it in the Hyperlinks panel and then
choose Delete Hyperlink from the flyout menu or click the Delete Selected
Hyperlinks iconic button at the bottom of the panel.
When you export your InDesign files to PDF files (choose File➪Export, or
press Ô+E or Ctrl+E, and choose Adobe PDF from the Format pop-up menu),
be sure to select the Hyperlinks option in the Include section of the General
pane in the Export PDF dialog box. If you export to the XHTML format to
create a Web page from your InDesign document (File➪Cross-Media Export➪
XHTML/Dreamweaver), the hyperlinks are included automatically. (And note
that you don’t need to use Adobe’s Dreamweaver Web editing software to
work on these exported Web pages; any HTML editor or HTML-capable text
editor will do.)

N
ot only is InDesign useful for short documents like ads and newsletters,
but it also can comfortably handle longer, multi-chapter documents
such as books and manuals. The most common and easiest way to build
longer documents, especially those created by more than one author or 
contributor, is to create multiple InDesign documents and then assemble
them into a larger book.
InDesign’s book feature lets you
 See who is working on each chapter and when.
 Update styles and swatches across documents for consistency.
 Update page numbers across multiple documents.
 Create a unified table of contents and a unified index for multiple 
documents, using the techniques covered in Chapter 21.
 Easily print or create a PDF file from all the chapters of a book.
Book Basics
In InDesign, a book is a specific type of file that you create to track chapters
or multiple documents that make up the book. Using InDesign’s book panels,
you can add, open and edit, rearrange, and print chapters of the book. The

book palette is nice for workgroups because multiple users can open the
same book and access different chapters; it also works well if you are a single
user working on a multi-chapter book.
Creating a new book
To create a new book, choose File➪New➪Book. The New Book dialog box lets
you specify a location for the book and give it a name. Click Save to create
and open the book.
Opening and closing a book
Open an existing book by using the File➪Open command (Ô+O or Ctrl+O).
Each book will appear in its own panel. (If several books are open, the panels
will be contained in a free-floating panel group.) When viewing folder and
disk contents via the Mac’s Finder or Windows’s Explorer, you can also
double-click a book’s icon or filename to open it.
To close a book’s panel, and any book documents that are in it, simply click
its close box.
Adding chapters to books
A new book panel is empty — you need to add chapter documents to fill it up.
To do this, click the Add Document iconic button — the + icon on the bottom-
right of the book’s panel (see Figure 23-1) — or use the Add Document option
in the book panel’s flyout menu. Use the Add Chapter dialog box to locate and
select the first chapter you want to add. Click the Add button to make this the
first chapter in the book. Repeat this process to add to the book all the chap-
ters you have ready (you can also add more later).
Chapters are listed in the book panel in the order in which you add them. 
You may want to rearrange them to match the actual order of the book 
project — especially if you are numbering the book automatically from 
start to finish, since InDesign will number them based on their order in 
the book panel. To rearrange the relative position of chapters, just click 
and drag chapter names up or down within the panel to put them in the
desired order.
340
Part VI: Getting Down to Business 

Working on Chapters
To work on a chapter in a book, first open the book and then double-click the
chapter name in the book’s panel. The chapter opens in InDesign just like any
other InDesign document. For a chapter to be opened, it must be marked as
Available, as explained in the next section. When you finish editing a chapter,
save and close it as usual.
Replace an existing chapter with another document by selecting the chapter
in the book panel and choosing Replace Document from the flyout menu.
Navigate to a new document, select it, and click the Open button. InDesign
will replace the selected chapter with the new document.
Delete chapters from a book by choosing Remove Document from the flyout
menu or by clicking the Remove Document iconic button (the – icon) at the
bottom of the panel.
InDesign offers three other menu options in the flyout menu that come in
handy for managing a book: You can save books by choosing Save Book, save
to a new name by choosing Save Book As, and close the book by choosing
Close Book (any changes to the book are not saved, although a warning box
gives you the chance to save any unsaved changes).

Chapter 23: Publishing Books

Finding out about chapter status
When you use the book panel in a workgroup, it provides helpful status
reports about each chapter. (Figure 23-1 shows the icons used to indicate a
chapter’s status.) The statuses are
 Available: The chapter can be opened, edited, or printed. Only one user
at a time can open a chapter.
 Open: You have the chapter open and can edit it or print it. Nobody else
can open the chapter at this time.
 In Use: Another user has the chapter open. In this case, you cannot edit
or open the chapter.
 Modified: The chapter has been changed since the last time you opened
the book panel. Simply click the chapter name to update it.
 Missing: The chapter’s file has been moved since it was added to the
book. Double-click the chapter name to open the Find File dialog box
and locate it.
The Document Information menu option in the book panel’s flyout menu pro-
vides useful information. When you select a chapter and choose this option,
you can see the file’s modification date, location, and page range, and you
can replace the chapter with a different document.
Taking advantage of style sources
The first chapter you add to the book is, by default, the style source. You can
tell which chapter is the style source by the icon to the left of the chapter
name. In most cases, you want the styles, swatches, and so on to remain the
same from chapter to chapter. The style source in an InDesign book defines
the styles and swatches that are common to all the chapters in the book.
If you decide to make a different chapter the style source, all you need to do
is (in the book panel) click in the column to the left of that chapter’s file-
name. This moves the icon indicating the style source to that chapter. But
note that indicating a style source is not the end of the story; to ensure for-
matting consistency, you will need to synchronize all the book’s chapters to
that source, as explained in the next section.
Synchronizing formatting
When you use the Synchronize feature, InDesign makes sure that the para-
graph styles, character styles, table styles, cell styles, object styles, trap pre-
sets, TOC styles, master pages, and color swatches in each chapter in the
342
Part VI: Getting Down to Business 

book match those in the style source. This enforces consistency, but also
means you have to make sure you choose the correct chapter as the stan-
dard, because its settings will override the other chapters’ settings.
The book panel includes a Synchronize iconic button, as well as a
Synchronize Selected Documents or Synchronize Book menu item in the
flyout menu. Before you synchronize, make sure that you’re happy with the
styles, master pages, and other settings you’ve established in the style
source and then follow these steps to synchronize:
1. Be sure that all chapters are available for editing.
2. Choose the style source by clicking the box to the left of the source
chapter so that the style-source icon appears.
3. Choose Synchronize Options from the book panel’s flyout menu,
which opens a dialog box.
Make sure that every type of item you want to synchronize — Object
Styles, TOC Style, Character Styles, Paragraph Styles, Table Styles, Cell
Styles, Master Pages, Numbered Lists, Text Variables, Trap Presets, and
Swatches — is checked.
(InDesign CS3 adds the ability to synchronize master pages across book
chapters, as well as the new table styles, cell styles, numbered lists, and
text variables.)
4. Select the chapters you want to synchronize and either click the
Synchronize button or choose Synchronize Selected Documents 
from the flyout menu.
If no chapters are selected, InDesign assumes you want to synchronize
all chapters; the menu option Synchronize Book will appear in the flyout
menu rather than Synchronize Selected Documents in that case.
5. Compare the styles (character, paragraph, object, table, cell, and
TOC), swatches (color, tint, and gradient), text variables, numbered
lists, master pages, and trap presets, in the style source to those in
each chapter.
If anything is different, the information in each chapter will be updated
to match the style source. If someone changed the typeface in a style
sheet in a chapter, it will revert to the typeface specified in the style
source. If anything is missing from a chapter — for example, if you just
added a swatch to the style source but not to other chapters — that
information is added to each chapter. If a chapter uses its own style or
swatch not defined in the source style, that unique style or swatch is not
changed or removed — these local additions are retained.
343
Chapter 23: Publishing Books

By using the synchronize feature, you give each chapter the same basic set of
styles and swatches as the style source, although you can still add more of
these specifications to individual chapters. Keep in mind that synchronizing
doesn’t repair the formatting fiascos that can happen when multiple users
work on the same book. Be sure everyone who needs to know the standards
for the design has access, ahead of time, to that information.
Printing Chapters and Books
Using the book panel, you can print any chapters with the status of Available
or Open. Here’s how:
1. To print the entire book, make sure no chapters are selected.
To print a contiguous range of chapters, Shift+click the first and last
chapters that you want to print. To print noncontiguous chapters,
Ô+click or Ctrl+click the chapters to select them.
2. Click the Print Book iconic button or choose Print Book or Print
Selected Documents in the book panel’s flyout menu (the option will
depend on whether chapters are selected in the book panel).
The standard InDesign Print dialog box opens. Note that the option to
choose all pages or a range of pages is grayed out — you must print all
chapters in the selected chapters.
3. Make any adjustments in the Print dialog box.
4. Click Print to print the chapters.
You can also output a book to PDF by using the Export Book to PDF or Export
Selected Documents to PDF menu items in the flyout menu. These menu
items work like their equivalent Print versions.
Working with Sections in Chapters
Section-based page numbering is fairly common in book-length documents
because it lets you, for example, restart page numbering in each new section,
such as 4.1, 4.2, and so on. Creating a section start is also the only way to
start a document on a left-facing page. InDesign gives you two choices for
numbering book pages: You can let the book panel number pages consecu-
tively from one chapter to the next, or you can add sections of page numbers,
which carry through the book until you start a new section.
344
Part VI: Getting Down to Business 

Numbering pages consecutively
If your book chapters don’t have sections, use consecutive page numbering,
in which the first page number of a chapter follows the last page number of
the previous chapter (for example, one chapter ends on page 224, and the
next chapter starts on page 225).
Consecutive page numbering is applied by default in InDesign. If for some
reason a document resets its numbering, go to that document, open the
Section dialog box (choose Numbering & Section Options in the Pages 
panel’s flyout menu), and select Automatic Page Numbering.
Consecutive page numbering works as follows:
 Whenever you add a chapter that contains no sections, or that has sec-
tion numbering set to Automatic Page Numbering, InDesign numbers
pages consecutively throughout the book.
 As you add and delete pages from chapters, InDesign updates all the
page numbers in the chapters that follow.
 You can force InDesign to renumber all the pages by choosing
Repaginate from the book panel’s flyout menu — this is handy if you
changed section options in some chapters and want the book to see
those changes.
Numbering pages with sections
When chapters you add to books already contain sections of page numbers
(implemented through the Section dialog box, which you access via the
Numbering & Section Options menu option in the Pages panel’s flyout menu),
section page numbering overrides the book’s consecutive page numbering.
The section page numbering carries through chapters of the book until
InDesign encounters a new section start. So if one chapter ends on page iv, the
next chapter starts on page v unless you start a new section for that chapter.
For more in-depth information about section numbering, see Chapter 4.
Setting chapter numbers
You can also see and modify any chapter’s page numbering settings by 
selecting the chapter in the book panel, then choosing Document Numbering
Options from the flyout menu. Figure 23-2 shows the dialog box. The top half
of the dialog box is the same as the Pages panel’s Section dialog box, whereas
the bottom half — the Document Chapter Numbering area — lets you control
the chapter numbering style and the chapter number itself.
345
Chapter 23: Publishing Books

The Document Chapter Numbering controls in the Document Numbering
Options dialog box are new to InDesign CS3. You can force a chapter to have
a specific number by selecting the Chapter Number option, have the chapter
use the same chapter number as the previous document (such as when you
break a chapter into two documents), and have InDesign automatically
number the current document by incrementing from the previous document’s
chapter number.
The chapter number defined here — whether manually overridden or auto-
matically adjusted — is what is used by the Chapter Number text variable,
explained in Chapter 22.

In this part . . .
F
inally, your layout is done. It’s beautiful, it’s well-
written, and you’re eager to share it with your read-
ers. This part shows you how to take the final step to
print, create a PDF version of your layout, or even export
to the Web’s HTML format so you can distribute it to the
world at large. InDesign gives you a lot of control over
output, so you can optimize the results based on what
you are printing it to, such as ensuring color fidelity and
the best possible image resolution. Then you can start the
whole creation, refinement, and output process over again
with your next layout!

Chapter 24
Setting Up for Output
In This Chapter
 Checking your files before you print
 Setting up booklets
You’ve finished your document and you want to share it with the whole
world, or at least your audience. So you reach for your mouse and
choose File➪Print or quickly press Ô+P or Ctrl+P so you can print.
Stop. Cancel. If this is your first print job with InDesign, you need to make
sure that you’ve properly set up your printer to get the results you need. The
process for doing so varies based on your operating system, and you can find
instructions at the author’s Web site at www.InDesignCentral.com.
You also should do a visual proof of your layout before you print. It’s amazing
what you don’t notice when you’re focused on specific elements as you lay
out a page. Change your view setting so the entire page or spread fits in the
window (choose View➪Fit Page in Window or View➪Fit Spread in Window, as
desired) and then review your pages.
That visual check is a critical step before printing, but you should also 
use InDesign’s tool to examine your document and, if you are printing in
booklet form, you should use InDesign’s tool to arrange pages in proper 
printing order.
Checking Your Document before Printing
InDesign has a preprinting checkup capability called preflighting. The pre-
flighting capability examines your document for any issues of concern and
gives you a report on what might need to be fixed.

You may wonder why you need a preflighting capability to check for things
such as missing fonts and images: After all, InDesign lists any missing fonts
and graphics when you open a document. The answer is that sometimes
fonts and graphics files are moved after you open a file, in which case you
won’t get the alerts from InDesign. This is more likely to happen if you work
with files and fonts on a network drive, rather than with local fonts and
graphics. Preflighting also checks for other problematic issues, such as the
use of RGB files and TrueType fonts.
If you’re working with the InDesign book feature (see Chapter 23), you 
can preflight the book’s chapters from an open book’s panel by using the
Preflight Book option in its flyout menu. (If one or more documents in 
the book are selected in the panel, the menu option changes to Preflight
Selected Documents.) The options are the same as for preflighting individual
documents.
Using InDesign’s preflighting capability is easy: Choose File➪Preflight or
press Shift+Option+Ô+F or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+F. In a few seconds, a dialog box
appears that shows the status of your document. Here’s what the six panes 
in the Preflight dialog box do:
 The Summary pane (shown in Figure 24-1) shows you a summary of
alerts. If your document has layers, you can select or deselect the Show
Data for Hidden Document Layers option. If selected, layers that won’t
print are analyzed for font, image, and other issues. Select this option
only if the person receiving your document plans on printing hidden
350
Part VII: Printing and Output Essentials 
Giving InDesign a preflighting target
Before you run the Preflight tool, you may want
to set up your printer output so the tool accu-
rately checks your document’s setup in antici-
pation of, for example, whether you plan to
output color separations or spot colors. To do
this, choose File➪Print Presets➪Define to open
the Print Preset dialog box, and then click New.
The New Print Preset dialog box appears, giving
you the same options as the Print dialog box
(covered in Chapter 25). Click OK when you are
finished with your preset, then click OK again to
close the Print Presets dialog box and return to
your layout. (You can also save settings in the
Print dialog box by clicking Save Preset before
printing.)
But don’t confuse InDesign’s print setup with
the operating system’s printer setup. InDesign’s
Print dialog box contains a button called Printer
(on the Mac) or Setup (in Windows) that lets you
change print settings for all applications — it’s
essentially a shortcut to the operating-system
controls described earlier in this section. You
should change these operating-system settings
only for output controls that InDesign’s Print
dialog box does not provide.

layers. For example, in a French-and-English document, you may have
hidden the French layer for proofing but still want it checked because
the service bureau is instructed to print the document twice — once
with the English layer on and the French layer off, and once with the
English layer off and the French layer on.
 The Fonts pane (shown in Figure 24-2) shows the type of each font
(Type 1 PostScript, OpenType, or TrueType) so you can spot any
TrueType fonts before they go to your service bureau. (TrueType fonts
usually don’t print easily on imagesetters, so use a program like FontLab
FontStudio or TransType to translate them to PostScript instead.) It will
also show if any fonts are missing from your system. You can search for
missing fonts, as well as replaced unwanted TrueType fonts, by clicking
Find Font.
 The Links and Images pane shows whether any graphics files are miss-
ing or if the original image has been modified since you placed it in your
layout. You can click Update to correct any such bad links one at a time,
or Repair All to have InDesign prompt you in turn for each missing or
modified file. The pane also shows whether a color profile is embedded
in your graphics in case files that should have them don’t or in case a
file that should not have an embedded profile does. (See Chapter 25 for
all the goods on color profiles.) It also alerts you if you use RGB images.
Although such images will print and color-separate, InDesign provides
the warning because it’s usually better to convert RGB images to CMYK
in an image editor or illustration program so you can control the final
appearance, rather than rely on InDesign or the output device to do the
translation.
 The Colors and Inks pane shows the color of the inks that will be used
in the output. (If you are printing color separations, these correspond to
the color plates that will eventually be used to print the document on a
printing press.) You can’t modify anything here — it’s simply for infor-
mational purposes — but it’s a handy way to ensure that you aren’t acci-
dentally using a spot color that will print to a separate color plate when
you meant to print it as a process color using the standard CMYK plates.
 The Print Settings pane shows how the document is configured to print
in the Print dialog box. This is why it’s key to configure the output set-
tings, as described earlier, before preflighting your document.
 The External Plug-ins pane shows any plug-in programs that are
required in order to output the file. Amazingly, some third-party plug-ins
make changes to the InDesign document that require the same plug-in to
be installed at each computer that opens the file. This dialog box alerts
you if you have such a dependency.

You can limit the status list in most panes to display only problems by select-
ing the Show Problems Only option.
By clicking Report, you can generate a text file containing the information
from the Preflight dialog box’s panes, which you can give to your service
bureau to check its settings and files against.
You can also click Package to gather all related fonts and files into one folder
for delivery to a service bureau or other outside printing agency. Click Cancel
to exit the Preflight dialog box and go back to your document.

Setting Up Booklets
One of the trickiest types of documents to print is a folded booklet: You can’t
simply print the pages in sequence and have them end up on the right loca-
tion on the final sheets of paper — when you fold them, you’ll find the page
order is rearranged due to the folding, especially in two-sided documents.
The tried-and-true approach is to use a booklet template that essentially 
provides a map of where pages should be so that when they are printed and
folded, they end up in the right place — and then arrange your pages in that
order via the Pages panel. Figure 24-3 shows the natural order (1-8) that you
typically think a booklet has, as well as the actual page order (8,1; 2,7; 6,3;
and 4,5) in which it must be printed to appear as a sequence of 1 through 8.
There is an easier way: The Print Booklet dialog box (File➪Print Booklet). Here,
you arrange your pages in the Pages panel in sequential order (1-8, in this case)
and let the InDesign software figure out how to rearrange them for printing.
Much easier! Figure 24-4 shows the Print Booklet dialog box’s Setup pane.
The Print Booklet dialog box (and File menu option) replaces the InBooklet SE
dialog box (and File menu option) from previous versions of InDesign. The
capabilities are practically identical, although the user interface has changed.
(The only real functional difference is that InBooklet SE let you specify pre-
cisely what crop marks and related options to show, whereas Print Booklet
relies on InDesign’s Print dialog box to do so.) InBooklet SE was a trial version
of the more capable InBooklet plug-in, but the company that made this plug-in
was bought by Adobe’s archrival Quark, which promptly ended plug-in support
for InDesign. Adobe thus created its own Print Booklet feature to plug the gap.

Chapter 24: Setting Up for Output

Here are the key controls:
 Booklet Type: This pop-up menu is the key control. Here, you choose
the type of booklet, which tells InDesign how to arrange the pages when
printing so they are in the right sequence after folding. Your options are
• 2-up Saddle Stitch: a folded sheet that contains two pages on each
side, with the staples in the centerfold, between the pages. This is
used in newsletters, smaller magazines, and many office documents.
• 2-up Perfect Bound: a folded sheet that contains two pages on
each side, where the pages are stacked and folded, then cut and
held together with a glued backing or spine-based binding. This is
typically used in books, larger magazines, and catalogs (because
the square binding holds more pages than saddle-stitching does).
• 2-up Consecutive: a sheet that contains two pages on one side,
with each page then cut and bound. This is essentially normal
printing except that it uses a two-page sheet to print two pages 
at a time rather than a separate sheet for each page.
• 3-up Consecutive: like 2-up Consecutive, except there are three
pages on a sheet.
• 4-up Consecutive: like 2-up Consecutive, except there are four
pages on a sheet.
 Space Between Pages (not available for 2-up Saddle Stitch) and Bleed
Between Pages (available for 2-up Perfect Bound only): These options
let you adjust the relative spacing among pages and objects, typically to
provide additional white space around the folds.
Figure 24-4:
The Setup
pane of the
Print
Booklet
dialog box.
354
Part VII: Printing and Output Essentials 

 Creep (not available for the Consecutive options): This option shifts
pages’ contents away from the spine in increasing amounts as pages fall
from the center of the booklet to the outside of the booklet. Because out-
side pages have to fold over many inside pages, their content can end up
obscured in the inside margins because their gutter is eaten up by fold-
ing over those other pages. The Creep option corrects this problem.
 Signature Size (available only for 2-up Perfect Bound): This option spec-
ifies how many pages are printed on each side of a sheet: 4, 8, 16, or 32.
 Automatically Adjust to Fit Marks and Bleeds: This option ensures that
crop marks, bleeds, and other content that appears outside the page
boundary are properly handled for the chosen booklet type. If not
checked, you can manually adjust these settings using the Top, Bottom,
Left, and Right fields.
When using these features, consult with your professional printer or service
bureau for the appropriate settings. If you are printing the documents your-
self, do a test run, then fold, cut, and/or staple the sample document to make
sure it works as expected before printing out lots of copies. The Preview
pane, shown in Figure 24-5, shows the results of your choices, but doing a 
dry run is always the safest option.
When you’re happy with your settings, choose Print to get the standard Print
dialog box (covered in Chapter 25). You can also choose Print Settings to set
up printer-specific controls (also covered in Chapter 25).

P
rinting is more complex than just choosing File➪Print. At least, it can be,
depending on what you’re printing and on what printing device you’re
using. For example, printing a full-color brochure involves more settings and
steps than printing a proof copy to your laser printer or inkjet printer. So as
you go through this chapter, keep in mind that many steps aren’t relevant
every time you print — but understanding the basics of printing ensures that
you follow the right steps for each type of project. When you know the steps
for printing one document, the process for printing every other document is
very easy.
Calibrating Color
If you’re producing color documents for printing on a printing press, you may
want to use InDesign’s built-in color calibration tools. In a sense, you have to,
because InDesign’s color calibration is always on. But color calibration is
something you don’t do in a vacuum — you have to do it in your graphics
programs as well, so that every piece of software that handles your graphics
is working from the same color assumptions.

If you use Adobe Creative Suite 3, you can use a consistent color manage-
ment system (CMS) in all of the print-oriented CS3 programs, ensuring consis-
tent color. For scanned images, digital camera photos, and the like, you can
also tell InDesign the source device so InDesign knows the color assumptions
that the device makes and can use that information to adjust the colors
during printing accordingly.
Ensuring consistent color
You can set the CMS settings in InDesign by choosing Edit➪Color Settings
(there is no keyboard shortcut unless you assign one yourself, as explained
in Chapter 3) to get the dialog box shown in Figure 25-1.
Many of Adobe’s Creative Suite 3 applications have the same dialog box,
although sometimes you access it in different ways:
 Bridge CS3: Choose Edit➪Creative Suite Color Settings, or press
Shift+Ô+K or Ctrl+Shift+K. This sets the defaults for all CS3 applications,
although you can modify individual applications as noted below. Note
that if individual applications’ color settings differ from the CS3-wide 
settings, you will see a note to that effect at the top of the affected appli-
cations’ Color Settings dialog boxes.
 Acrobat Professional 8: Choose Acrobat➪Preferences or press Ô+K on
the Mac, or choose Edit➪Preferences or press Ctrl+K in Windows. Then
go to the Color Management pane. Note that this pane’s appearance dif-
fers from the appearance of the Color Settings dialog boxes in the other
Creative Suite 3 applications.
 GoLive 9: Choose Edit➪Color Settings. (No keyboard shortcut is available.)
 Illustrator CS3: Choose Edit➪Color Settings, or press Shift+Ô+K or
Ctrl+Shift+K.
 Photoshop CS3: Choose Edit➪Color Settings, or press Shift+Ô+K or
Ctrl+Shift+K.
Note that there are no CMS controls for the following CS3 applications: Adobe
Device Manager, Dreamweaver, and Flash Professional.
When you place a bitmapped image into InDesign, the CMS applies the
default settings defined in the Color Settings dialog box (choose Edit➪
Color Settings). If the document has no embedded color profile, a dialog 
box appears with a list of color profiles, as well as options to apply the
default you’ve set up in InDesign or to apply no profile. (If you choose 
not to apply a profile, the color won’t be adjusted during printing.)
358
Part VII: Printing and Output Essentials 

Whether or not there are embedded profiles for the document, you can
change the color settings for specific images as follows:
 As you import each file, select Show Import Options in the Place dialog
box (choose File➪Place or press Ô+D or Ctrl+D) when you place a graphic
into InDesign. In the resulting Image Import Options dialog box, go to the
Color pane and select the appropriate profile from the Profile menu.
 Any time after you place an image, select it and choose Object➪Image
Color Settings to apply a different profile. (You can also choose Graphics➪
Image Color Settings from the contextual menu that appears when you
Control+click or right-click a graphic in InDesign.)
Saving color management preferences
You can save and use color management settings in other documents. The
process is simple: Click Save in the Color Settings dialog box to save the cur-
rent dialog box’s settings to a file. If you want to use the saved color-settings
information in another document, open that document and click Load in the
Color Settings dialog box, and then browse for and select the color settings
file. That’s it! This is a handy way to ensure consistency in a workgroup.

Chapter 25: Printing and Other Output Techniques

Changing document color settings
If you put together a document with specific color settings, but then decide
you want to apply a new profile across your pictures or replace a specific
profile globally in your document, you can
 Choose Edit➪Assign Profiles to replace the color management settings
globally.
 Choose Edit➪Convert to Profile to change the document’s color work-
space. It also lets you change the CMS engine, rendering intent, and
black-point compensation settings.
Be sure to consult with a production manager or service bureau manager if
you change these expert settings.
Note that there’s real overlap in these two dialog boxes. Using the Assign
Profiles dialog box to replace the document profile does the same job as the
Convert to Profile dialog box when it comes to replacing the profiles. The
only difference is that the Assign Profiles dialog box can also remove profiles
from the document.
Calibrating output
When you’re ready to output your document to a printer or other device, 
set the profile and rendering intent for that destination device in the Color
Management pane of the Print dialog box (choose File➪Print or press Ô+P 
or Ctrl+P), which has an Options section with the Color Handling and Printer
Profile pop-up menus. Here you select the appropriate option for your output
device. (If you don’t know, ask an expert.)
Choosing Print Options
When your document is ready to print, go to the Print dialog box (choose
File➪Print or press Ô+P or Ctrl+P). The Print dialog box has eight panes as
well as several options common to all the panes. (I cover just the essential
ones here.) Change any options and click Print, and InDesign sends your 
document to the printer. Figure 25-2 shows the dialog box.
If you’re working with the InDesign book feature (see Chapter 23), you can
print the book’s chapters from an open book’s panel by using the Print Book
option in its flyout menu. (If one or more documents in the book are selected
in the panel, the menu option changes to Print Selected Documents.) The
setup options are the same as for printing individual documents.
360
Part VII: Printing and Output Essentials 

Common options
The common options available in the dialog box, no matter what pane is
selected, are as follows:
 Print Preset pop-up menu: This pop-up menu lets you choose a previ-
ously defined set of printer settings, which makes it easy to switch
between, say, a proofing printer and a final output device.
 Printer pop-up menu: This pop-up menu lets you select the printer to use.
 PPD pop-up menu: This pop-up menu lets you select PostScript Printer
Descriptions, which are files that contain configuration and feature infor-
mation specific to a brand and model of printer. You usually install these
into your operating system by using software that comes from your
printer manufacturer. If InDesign finds no compatible PPDs, it uses
generic options. If InDesign finds just one compatible PPD, it uses that
automatically; otherwise, it lets you select a PPD.
 Save Preset button: Clicking this button saves any settings that you
change in the Print dialog box and lets you choose a name for those
saved settings for reuse. If you change the dialog box’s settings but don’t
save these changes as a print preset, InDesign changes the name of the
current settings in the Print Preset pop-up menu to [Custom] to remind
you the settings are changed and unsaved.
Figure 25-2:
The default
view for the
Print dialog
box.
361
Chapter 25: Printing and Other Output Techniques

You can also create print presets by choosing File➪Print Presets➪Define,
or edit an existing preset by choosing File➪Print Presets➪Preset Name.
When you click New or Edit in the resulting dialog box, a dialog box iden-
tical to the Print dialog box appears, except that the Print button
becomes the OK button.
 Setup button (Windows); Page Setup and Printer buttons (Mac): These
buttons give you access to printer-specific controls. You use these
dialog boxes to specify options such as printing to file, paper sources,
and printer resolution. Note that if you add a printer, you may need to
quit InDesign and restart it for it to see the new printer.
 Cancel button: Clicking this button closes the Print dialog box without
printing. Use this if you’ve clicked Save Preset but don’t want to print, 
as well when you have any reason not to print.
 Print button: Clicking this button prints the document based on the 
current settings.
 Page preview subpane: This subpane at lower left shows the current
settings graphically. The page is indicated by the blue rectangle, and the
direction of the large P indicates the printing orientation; in Figure 25-2,
shown previously, the P is unrotated. The figure’s subpane shows that
the paper itself is the same size as the page (the page is shown in white,
and if the paper were larger than the page, you’d see a light gray area
around the page indicating the excess paper). This preview changes as
you adjust settings in the dialog box.
The General pane
The General pane contains the basic settings for your print job. Most are self-
explanatory, but note the following:
 When specifying a range of pages in the Pages Range option, you can
type nonconsecutive ranges, such as 1–4, 7, 10–13, 15, 18, 20. If you
want to print from a specific page to the end of the document, just type
the hyphen after the initial page number, such as 4–. InDesign figures out
what the last page is. Similarly, to start from the first page and end on a
specified page, just start with the hyphen, as in –11. InDesign lets you
type absolute page numbers in the Range field. For example, typing
+6–+12 would print the document’s 6th through 12th pages, no matter
what their page numbers are.
 Selecting the Spreads option prints facing pages on the same sheet of
paper, such as putting two letter-size pages on one 11-x-17-inch sheet.
This is handy when showing clients proposed designs, but make sure
you have a printer that can handle a large paper size or that you scale
the output down to fit (through the Setup pane, which I cover in the 
following section).
362
Part VII: Printing and Output Essentials 

 The Options section lets you print various layout components that you
typically don’t want in final output but might be useful when sharing
comps and other in-progress printouts with others, such as baseline
grids and nonprinting objects such as formatting notes.
 A new control in the Options section is the Print Layers pop-up menu,
which gives you additional control over how layers are marked as non-
printing print. It used to be that if you marked a layer as nonprinting,
you would have to leave the Print dialog box to open the Layers panel 
to make it printable. Now, you can skip that step and override layers’
nonprinting status using this pop-up menu. The default option, Visible 
& Printable Layers, honors your layers’ printing status. Visible Layers
prints all visible layers, including those marked as nonprinting. All
Layers prints both visible and hidden layers, including those marked 
as nonprinting. (See Chapter 5 for more on layers.)
The Setup pane
The Setup pane is where you tell InDesign how to work with the paper (or
other media, such as film negatives) to which you’re printing. The options 
are straightforward, so I just highlight a few notes and tips:
 Custom paper size: Choosing some printer models will in turn let you
choose a Custom option in the Paper Size pop-up menu, in which case
you type the dimensions in the Width and Height fields, as well as 
position the output through the Offset and Gap fields. These latter two
options are usually used when printing to a roll, such as in an imageset-
ter using photo paper (called RC paper, a resin-coated paper that keeps
details extremely sharp), so you can make sure there is space between
the left edge of the roll and the page boundary (the offset), as well as
between pages (the gap). Most printers can’t print right to the edge,
thus the Offset setting. You also want a gap between pages for crop and
registration marks, as well as to have room to physically cut the pages.
 Transverse option: Don’t use the Transverse option, which rotates the
output 90 degrees, unless your service bureau or production depart-
ment tells you to. Otherwise, you might have your pages cut off on the
final negatives.
 Tile options: Use the Tile options to print oversized documents.
InDesign breaks the document into separate pages — called tiles — 
that you later can assemble together. To enable tiling, select the Tile
check box, and then choose the appropriate option from the adjoining
pop-up menu:
363
Chapter 25: Printing and Other Output Techniques

• Manual: This lets you specify the tiles yourself. To specify a tile,
you change the origin point on the document ruler, and the new
origin point becomes the upper-left corner of the current tile. 
(To change the origin point, just drag the upper-left corner of 
the rulers to a new position in your document.) To print multiple
tiles this way, you need to adjust the origin point and print, adjust
the origin point to the next location and print, and so on, until
you’re done.
• Auto: This lets InDesign figure out where to divide the pages into
tiles. You can change the default amount of overlap between tiles
of 1.5 inches by using the Overlap field. The overlap lets you easily
align tiles by having enough overlap for you to see where each
should be placed relative to the others.
• Auto Justified: This is similar to Auto except that it makes each
tile the same size, adjusting the overlap if needed to do that. (The
Auto option, by contrast, simply starts at the origin point and then
does as much of the page as will fit in the tile, which means the last
tile may be a different width than the others.) You can see the dif-
ference between the two by watching how the page preview
window at left changes as you select each option.
The Marks and Bleed pane
The Bleed and Slug area of the Marks and Bleed pane controls how materials
print past the page boundary. A bleed is used when you want a picture, color,
or text to go right to the edge of the paper. Because there is slight variation
on positioning when you print because the paper moves mechanically
through rollers and might move slightly during transit, publishers have any
to-the-edge materials actually print beyond the edge, so there are never any
gaps. It’s essentially a safety margin. A normal bleed margin would be 0p9 (1⁄8
inch), although you can make it larger if you want.
A slug is an area beyond the bleed area in which you want printer’s marks to
appear. The reader never sees this, but the workers at the commercial printer
do, and it helps them make sure they have the right pages, colors, and so on.
Like the bleed, the slug area is trimmed off when the pages are bound into a
magazine, newspaper, or whatever. (The word slug is an old newspaper term
for this identifying information, based on the lead slug once used for this 
purpose on old printing presses.) The purpose of the slug is to ensure there
is enough room for all the printer’s marks to appear between the bleed area
and the edges of the page. Otherwise, InDesign will do the best it can.
364
Part VII: Printing and Output Essentials 

It’s best to define your bleed and slug areas in your document itself when you
create the document in the New Document dialog box (choose File➪New➪
Document or press Ô+N or Ctrl+N), as covered in Chapter 3. You can also 
use the Document Setup dialog box (choose File➪Document Setup or press
Option+Ô+P or Ctrl+Alt+P). The two dialog boxes have the same options; if
they don’t show the Bleed and Slug section, click More Options to see it.
But if you didn’t define your bleeds previously, you can do so in the Print
dialog box’s Marks and Bleed pane. You can also override those New
Document or Document Setup document settings here. To use the document
settings, select the Use Document Bleed Settings option. Otherwise, type in 
a bleed area by using the Top, Bottom, Left, and Right fields. If you want the
four fields to be the same, click the broken-chain iconic button to the right of
the Top field; it becomes a solid chain, indicating that all four fields will have
the same value if any is modified. Any bleed area is indicated in red in the
preview pane at the bottom left.
If you want to set the slug area, select the Include Slug Area option. InDesign
then reserves any slug area defined in the New Document or Document Setup
dialog box. You can’t set up the slug area in the Print dialog box.
The Output pane
The next pane is the Output pane, which controls the processing of colors
and inks on imagesetters, platesetters, and commercial printing equipment.
For proof printing, such as to a laser printer or an inkjet printer, the only
option that you need to worry about is on the Color pop-up menu, which 
controls whether the colors print as color or as grayscale.
The options in the Output pane are for experts and should be specified in
coordination with your service bureau and commercial printer — these
options can really mess up your printing if set incorrectly.
One area that you should set is in the Ink Manager dialog box. Accessed by
clicking Ink Manager, the Ink Manager dialog box, shown in Figure 25-3, gives
you finer controls over how color negatives output. If any colors should have
been converted to process color but weren’t, you have three choices:
 Click the spot color iconic button. You can override the spot color in
the Ink Manager dialog box by clicking this button (a circle icon) to the
left of the color’s name. That converts it to a process color. (Clicking the
process color button, a four-color box icon, converts a color back to a
spot color.) This is the way to go for a quick fix.
365
Chapter 25: Printing and Other Output Techniques

 Make the spot color a process color instead. Do this by closing the Ink
Manager and Print dialog boxes, and editing the color that was incor-
rectly set as a spot color in the Swatches panel (choose Window➪
Swatches or press F5) as I cover in Chapter 7. This ensures that the
color is permanently changed to a process color for future print jobs.
 Convert all spot colors to CMYK process equivalents. Do this by selecting
the All Spots to Process option. This is the easiest method to make sure
you don’t accidentally print spot-color plates for a CMYK-only document.
The other Ink Manager options are for experts and should be changed only in
consultation with your service bureau, production department, and/or com-
mercial printer.
The Graphics pane
By using the Graphics pane, you control how graphics are printed and how
fonts are downloaded. The options here are meant for professional printing,
such as to imagesetters, in situations where you’re working with a service
bureau or in-house printing department. This is also an expert area, so
change these settings only after consulting with an experienced pro.
Figure 25-3:
The Ink
Manager
dialog box.
366
Part VII: Printing and Output Essentials 

The Color Management pane
The Color Management pane is where you manage color output (apply color
calibration). Most options should be changed only in consultation with your
service bureau or production department.
One option you should be able to change on your own is Printer Profile. Use
this pop-up menu to select the device to which the document will ultimately
be printed. This is by default the same as the profile selected in the Edit
Color Settings dialog box, which I cover earlier in this chapter, in the section
“Calibrating Color.”
The Advanced pane
The options in the Advanced pane let you control graphics file substitutions
in an Open Prepress Interface (OPI) workflow and also set transparency flat-
tening, which controls how transparent and semitransparent objects are han-
dled during output. Again, these are expert options you should change only
in consultation with your service bureau or production department.
The Summary pane
The final Print dialog box pane is the Summary pane. It simply lists your set-
tings all in one place for easy review. The only option — Save Summary —
saves the settings to a file so you can include it with your files when deliver-
ing them to a service bureau or for distribution to other staff members so
they know the preferred settings.
Creating a Document Package
Have you ever given a page-layout document to a service bureau only to be
called several hours later because some of the files necessary to output your
document are missing? If so, you’ll love the Package feature in InDesign.
This command, which you access by choosing File➪Package or pressing
Option+Shift+Ô+P or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+P, copies into a folder all the font, 
color-output, and graphics files necessary to output your document. It also
generates a report that contains all the information about your document
that a service bureau is ever likely to need, including the document’s fonts,
dimensions, and trapping information. You can also create an instructions file
that has your contact information and any particulars you want to say about
the document.
367
Chapter 25: Printing and Other Output Techniques

When you run the Package command, InDesign preflights your document
automatically and gives you the option of viewing any problems it encounters.
If you elect to view that information, the Preflight dialog box appears. You can
continue to package your document from that dialog box by clicking Package
after you assure yourself that none of the problems will affect the document’s
output. If it finds no problems during the automatic preflighting, InDesign will
not display the Preflight dialog box.
Before you can actually package the document, InDesign asks you to save 
the current document, and then fill in the Printing Instructions form. You can
change the default filename from Instructions.txt to something more suitable,
such as the name of your print job. Often, you’ll leave the printing instruc-
tions blank — use the form only if you have special instructions.
If you don’t want to create an instructions form, don’t click Cancel — that
cancels the entire package operation. Just click Continue, leaving the form
blank. Similarly, you must click Save at the request to save the document;
clicking Cancel stops the package operation as well.
The next step is to create the package folder. You do this in the dialog box
that follows the Printing Instructions form, which on the Mac is called Create
Package Folder and in Windows is called Package Publication. Figure 25-4
shows the Mac version, which except for the name at the top is the same as
the Windows version.
Figure 25-4:
The Create
Package
Folder
dialog box

dialog box in

368
Part VII: Printing and Output Essentials 

In the dialog box, you can select what is copied: the fonts, color-output 
profiles, and linked graphics (graphics pasted into an InDesign document
rather than imported are automatically included). You can also tell InDesign
to update the graphics links for those that were modified or moved; if this
Update Graphic Links in Package option isn’t selected, any missing or modi-
fied graphics files won’t be copied with the document.
You can tell InDesign to include fonts and links from hidden layers (which you
would do only if you want the service bureau to print those hidden layers or if
you were giving the document’s files to a colleague to do further work).
You also can specify whether the document should use only the hyphenation
exceptions defined within it. This often makes sense because it ensures that
the printer’s hyphenation dictionary — which may differ from yours — doesn’t
cause text to flow differently.
Finally, you can choose to view the report after the package is created — 
on the Mac, InDesign launches TextEdit and displays the report file, and on
Windows it launches Notepad and displays the report file.
Click Save (on the Mac) or Package (in Windows) when everything is ready to
go. Your document is placed in the folder you specify, as is the instructions
file (the report). Inside that folder, InDesign will also create a folder called
Fonts that includes the fonts, a folder called Links that has the graphics files,
and a folder called Output Profiles that has the color output profiles.
I strongly recommend using the Package feature. It ensures that your service
bureau has all the necessary files and information to output your document
correctly.
Exporting PDF Files
Sometimes you want to create a PDF file for distribution on the Web, on a CD,
on a corporate intranet, or even by e-mail. PDF creation is a really easy task
in InDesign. First choose File➪Export or press Ô+E or Ctrl+E. The Export
dialog box appears, which, like any standard Save dialog box, lets you name
the file and determine what drive and folder the file is to be saved in. The key
control in the Export dialog box is the Formats pop-up menu, where you
choose the format (in this case, Adobe PDF). Then click Save.
If you’re working with the InDesign book feature (see Chapter 23), you can
export the book’s chapters to PDF files from an open book’s panel by using
the Export Book to PDF option in its flyout menu. (If one or more documents
in the book are selected in the panel, the menu option changes to Export
Selected Documents to PDF.) The setup options are the same as for exporting
individual documents.

Chapter 25: Printing and Other Output Techniques

After you select Adobe PDF in the Export dialog box’s Formats pop-up menu
and give the file a name and location in the File Name and Save in areas, click
Save to get the Export Adobe PDF dialog box shown in Figure 25-5. The dialog
box has six panes; the General pane is displayed when you open the dialog
box. There are several options that are accessible from all six panes.
If you know how to use Acrobat Professional, you know how to set up your
PDF export. If not, it’s best to consult with a local expert because PDF export
options are as complex and job-specific as the print options I cover earlier.
Common options
There are some basic options available in all the panes that you should feel
comfortable setting on your own:
 Adobe PDF Preset pop-up menu: This pop-up menu lets you select from
both predefined sets of PDF-export settings (similar to the printer pre-
sets covered earlier in this chapter), as well as any presets you or some-
one else may have created.
 Compatibility pop-up menu: This pop-up menu lets you choose which
PDF file version to save the file as. Your options are Acrobat 4 (PDF 1.3),
Acrobat 5 (PDF 1.4), Acrobat 6 (PDF 1.5), Acrobat 7 (PDF 1.6), and
Acrobat 8 (PDF 1.7). Choosing Acrobat 4 (PDF 1.3) is the best option for
documents that you want to distribute on CD or over the Web because 
it ensures the broadest number of people will be able to view the file.
But it also limits the ability to use some features, particularly those that
protect the document from unauthorized usage such as copying its con-
tents. Choose a later version only if you’re certain that your intended
recipients use that version of Acrobat or Acrobat Reader. For example, if
your company has standardized on Acrobat 6 and the document will be
used only internally, picking the Acrobat 6 (PDF 1.5) option makes sense.
Likewise, if you’re sending the PDF file to a service bureau, use the ver-
sion of Acrobat that the service bureau uses because later versions of
Acrobat support more features, especially for commercial printing. (PDF
formats 1.5 and later, for example, support native transparency.)
 Save Preset button: Click this to save any settings made in the Export
Adobe PDF dialog box as a new preset. (You can also define new PDF
presets by choosing File➪PDF Export Presets➪Define.)
 Export button: Click this to create the PDF file based on the settings that
you selected in the various panes.

Part VII: Printing and Output Essentials 

The General pane
Use the General pane, shown in Figure 25-5, to determine what is exported.
The Pages option gives you the same flexibility as the Print dialog box’s
Pages option, which I cover in the earlier section “Choosing Print Options.”
Similarly, the Spread option works like the same-name option in the Print
dialog box.

Chapter 25: Printing and Other Output Techniques
Using Distiller job options
InDesign also lets you import settings from
Acrobat Distiller job-options files, which are
similar to InDesign’s PDF presets but are cre-
ated in the Adobe Acrobat Professional soft-
ware. You can load such job-option files by
clicking Load in the Adobe PDF Presets dialog
box (choose File➪PDF Export Presets➪Define).
You can use the Adobe PDF Presets dialog box
to create and edit the job-option files for sharing
with Acrobat Distiller (part of Acrobat
Professional) and other Creative Suite users;
just click Save when you’re done. When creat-
ing or editing these PDF presets, you get the
same options that I describe elsewhere in this
section for the Export Adobe PDF dialog box.

In the Options section, you can select the following options:
 Embed Page Thumbnails: Select this option if you’re creating a PDF file
to be viewed on-screen. Thumbnails help people to more easily navigate
your document in the Adobe Reader program. However, if you’re send-
ing the PDF files to a service bureau or commercial printer for printing,
you don’t need to generate the thumbnails.
 Optimize for Fast Web View: Always select this option — this minimizes
file size without compromising the output.
 Create Tagged PDF: Select this option to embed XML tag information
into the PDF file. This is useful for XML-based workflows and Adobe
eBooks. If you don’t know what XML or eBooks are, you don’t need to
select this option.
 View PDF after Exporting: Select this option if you want to see the
results of the PDF export as soon as the export is complete. Typically,
however, you shouldn’t select this option because you likely will have
other things you want to do before launching Adobe Reader (or the full
Acrobat program, if you own it) to proof your files.
 Create Acrobat Layers: If you selected Acrobat 6 (PDF 1.5) or later in
the Compatibility pop-up menu, you can select this option, which out-
puts any InDesign layers to separate layers in Acrobat. (Acrobat 6 was
the first version of Acrobat to support layers.) If you choose a different
Compatibility option, Create Acrobat Layers is grayed out.
 Export Layers: This new pop-up menu gives you additional control over
how layers marked as nonprinting are exported to the PDF file. It used 
to be that if you marked a layer as nonprinting, you would have to leave
the Export Adobe PDF dialog box to open the Layers panel to make it
exportable. Now, you can skip that step and override layers’ nonprinting
status using this pop-up menu. The default option, Visible & Printable
Layers, honors your layers’ printing status. Visible Layers exports all
visible layers, including those marked as nonprinting. All Layers exports
both visible and hidden layers, including those marked as nonprinting.
(See Chapter 5 for more on layers.)
In the Include section, you set what elements of the document are included in
the PDF file. You can select the following options:
 Bookmarks: This takes InDesign table-of-contents (TOC) information
and preserves it as bookmarks in the exported PDF file.
 Hyperlinks: This preserves any hyperlinks added in InDesign. Otherwise,
the hyperlinks are converted to standard text in the PDF file. (Chapter 22
explains how to create hyperlinks in InDesign.)
372
Part VII: Printing and Output Essentials 

 Visible Guides and Grids: This includes the on-screen guides and grids
in the output version — an option you’d use only when creating PDF files
meant to be used as designer examples, not for readers or for prepress.
 Non-Printing Objects: This includes any objects marked as Nonprinting
through the Attributes pane (choose Window➪Attributes).
 Interactive Elements: This preserves interactive objects such as but-
tons rather than convert them to static graphics.
 Multimedia: This pop-up menu lets you control how embedded sound
and video are handled. This option is available only if you choose Acrobat
6 (PDF 1.5) or later in the Compatibility pop-up menu. The options are 
Use Object Settings, Link All, or Embed All. In InDesign, you can embed 
a sound or movie file, or link to one. This option lets you override the 
individual settings and make all such objects embedded or linked.
The Compression pane
All the options in this pane compress your document’s graphics. For docu-
ments you’re intending to print professionally, make sure that for the Color,
Grayscale, and Monochrome image types, the No Sampling Change option is
selected, and that Compression is set to None. You don’t want to do anything
that affects the resolution or quality of your bitmap images if you’re out-
putting to a high-resolution device.
But it’s fine to select the Crop Image Data to Frames option because this dis-
cards portions of pictures not visible on-screen, reducing file size and reduc-
ing processing time during output. (Imagesetters and other devices usually
have to process the entire image, even if only part of it is actually printed.)
You can also select the Compress Text and Line Art option. It compresses
vector graphics (both imported and those created in InDesign) as well as
text, but does so without affecting output quality.
For the rest, stick with the defaults based on the preset you chose, or check
with your production department.
Marks and Bleed pane
The Marks and Bleed pane in the Export Adobe PDF dialog box works just
like the Marks and Bleed pane in the Print dialog box, which I cover earlier 
in this chapter.
373
Chapter 25: Printing and Other Output Techniques

The Output pane
The Output pane has two sections — Color and PDF/X — where you control
color calibration. Adjust these only if you’re creating a PDF file meant to be
used by a service bureau to print the final document on paper or to create
plates for commercial printing. Ask the people at your service bureau what
settings they prefer for this pane’s options.
The Advanced pane
The Advanced pane in the Export Adobe PDF dialog box has the same
options as the Advanced pane in the Print dialog box, which I cover earlier in
this chapter. Like the Output pane, these options are relevant only if you’re
generating a PDF file that your service bureau or commercial printer will use
to create the final printed output from.
Security pane
The Security pane, shown in Figure 25-6, has no relevance to documents
intended to be output at a service bureau or commercial printer, so make
sure the Require a Password to Open the Document and the Use a Password
to Restrict Printing, Editing, and Other Tasks options are not selected in 
that case.
Figure 25-6:
The Security
pane of the
Export
Adobe PDF
dialog box.
374
Part VII: Printing and Output Essentials 

These settings are useful if you’re publishing the document electronically
because they control who can access the document and what they can do
with the document once it’s open. Here’s how these settings work:
 Encryption Level: This section’s options depend on the option set in 
the Compatibility pop-up menu; Acrobat 5 (PDF 1.4) and higher use 
High (128-Bit RC4) encryption, while earlier versions use 40-bit RC4.
 Document Open Password: In this section of the Security pane, you can
require a password to open the exported PDF file by selecting this option
and typing a password in the associated text field. If you don’t type a
password here, you’re forced to type one in a dialog box that appears
later. To access protected content, recipients must use the Security pane
in Acrobat (choose File➪Document Properties or press Ô+D or Ctrl+D).
 Permissions: Here, you determine what restrictions to place on the PDF
file. Note that the options will vary based on what version of the PDF
format you selected in the General pane.
• Use a Password to Restrict Printing, Editing, and Other Tasks:
You can restrict recipients’ actions by selecting this option and
then specifying permissible actions by using the Printing Allowed
and Changes Allowed pop-up menus, as well as selecting from
among the options that follow (the number of options displayed
varies based on the preset chosen). You can also require a pass-
word to allow editing of the file in another application. Your man-
agement options include the following:
• Printing Allowed: You can select None, Low-Resolution (150 dpi),
or High Resolution. You would disable printing to ensure that the
material can be read only on-screen.
• Changes Allowed: You can select None; Inserting, Deleting and
Rotating Pages; Filling in Form Fields and Signing; Commenting,
Filling in Form Fields, and Signing; or Any Except Extracting Pages.
(Signing means using digital signatures to verify sender and recipi-
ent identities.)
• Enable Copying of Text, Images, and Other Content: If it’s okay
for recipients to use the PDF file’s objects, select this option.
• Enable Text Access of Screen Reader Devices for the Visually
Impaired: If you want the file to be accessible to visually impaired
recipients who use text-reader applications, select this option. This
option is available only if you are exporting to Acrobat 5 (PDF 1.4)
or later.
• Enable Plaintext Metadata: For documents with metadata —
authoring information associated with XML documents and Web
pages — you can make that metadata visible to Web-based search
engines and similar applications by selecting this option. This
option is available only if you are exporting to Acrobat 6 (PDF 1.5)
or later.
375
Chapter 25: Printing and Other Output Techniques

The Summary pane
The final Export Adobe PDF dialog box pane is the Summary pane, which
simply lists your settings all in one place for easy review. The only option —
Save Summary — saves the settings to a file so you can include it with your
files when delivering them to a service bureau, or for distribution to other
staff members so they know the preferred settings.
Exporting to the Web
InDesign CS3 now lets you export your layouts to the XHTML format that Web
editors such as Adobe’s Dreamweaver and GoLive can open for further work.
(Note that you’ll usually want to do further work in a Web editor both to take
advantage of Web-specific formatting options and to rework the layout to
376
Part VII: Printing and Output Essentials 
Settings for on-screen usage
If your output is destined for use on a monitor —
such as from CD, on the Web, or in a corporate
intranet — use these settings when exporting to
PDF files:
 In the General pane, select the Optimize for
Fast Web View option. Also, check Spreads
if your facing pages are designed as one
visual unit.
 In the Compression pane, change the two
Image Quality pop-up menus to Low. Also,
choose any of the Downsampling or
Subsampling menu options in all three
image types’ sections. The pixels-per-inch
(ppi) value should be either 72 (if you intend
people just to view the images on-screen)
or 300 or 600 (if you expect people to print
the documents to a local inkjet or laser
printer). Pick the ppi value that best
matches most users’ printers’ capabilities.
For the Compression pop-up menus, choose
Automatic (JPEG) for the color and
grayscale bitmaps, and CCITT Group 4 (the
standard method for fax compression) for
black-and-white bitmaps. Set Quality to
Maximum for color and grayscale bitmaps.
Finally, select the Compress Text and Line
Art option.
 In the Marks and Bleeds pane, make sure
no printer’s marks are selected.
 In the Security pane, select the security
features (Document Open Password and
Permissions) and the options for which you
want to add security. Uncheck the Enable
Copying of Text and Graphics option to pre-
vent readers from copying and pasting your
content, and select None from the Printing
Allowed pop-up menu to prevent printing.
The Changes Allowed pop-up menu options
control whether readers can add extra
pages, add comments to the file, fill in
forms, delete pages, or rotate pages.
Typically, you’d choose either Filling in Form
Fields and Signing (so readers could com-
plete forms) or Commenting, Filling in Forms,
and Signing (so readers can complete
forms and add their own comments) — both
options keep the user from accessing the
underlying content of your PDF files.

better fit the horizontal “page” size of a Web browser.) With InDesign CS3’s
newfound ability to export to the XHTML format, not just create an XML 
version specific to Adobe’s GoLive Web editor, as in previous versions, 
you can more easily create Web pages based on print documents.
XHTML is a version of the well-known Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
format that adds more consistent structure to make it easier to present pages
consistently across Web editors and browsers. You probably didn’t even
know that your Web editor was creating XHTML-formatted Web pages when
you saved your pages, but any Web editor worth its salt has been doing that
for a few years now.
To export a layout to XHTML format, simply choose File➪Cross-Media
Export➪XHTML/Dreamweaver. (And despite the name, your files are not 
limited to use by Adobe’s Dreamweaver software.) If you want to export just
specific items on a page, select them with one of the selection tools before
choosing this menu option.
You’ll get the Save As dialog box, where you choose the disk and folder to
store the exported Web page, as well as the page’s filename. After you click
Save, you’ll get the XHTML Export Options dialog box, shown in Figure 25-7,
in which you specify how InDesign converts the layout to the Web format.
Unless you’re Web-savvy, ask your Web master what settings to use:
 In the General pane, you choose whether to export the currently
selected objects or the entire document, as well as how to handle bul-
leted and numbered lists. The default mappings — Map to Unordered
Lists for bullets and Map to Ordered Lists for numbers — work for most
sites. But you can also have InDesign convert either or both such lists
into plain text rather than using the Web’s list functions.
 In the Images pane, you choose how your images are converted to the
Web’s GIF and JPEG formats, selecting options such as image quality and
color palette.
 In the Advanced pane, you set how text formatting is converted to the
Web’s version of styles, called cascading style sheets, or CSS. It’s prefer-
able to choose External CSS as the export option, since that choice has
the Web pages use a single style file that all Web pages can refer to,
ensuring consistency (much like InDesign’s styles offer). Note that
InDesign does not create a CSS file for you; you or your Web designer
must create it in a Web editing program. Also in this pane, you can spec-
ify an external JavaScript file to link to — again, something your Web
designer or programmer will have created separately.
Click Export when done with your settings.
377
Chapter 25: Printing and Other Output Techniques

The export process is simple, so it’s easy to forget that converting print 
layouts to the Web’s format is rarely a “point and shoot” activity. Expect 
your Web designer to do major work on those exported pages in his or her
Web editing program, to optimize them for the Web environment. That’s no
reflection on you or InDesign, just the reality of working in different media.

dmit it — you came here before looking at the rest of the book. I can’t
blame you — we all love to know what’s new. Well, InDesign CS3 has a
lot of new stuff. Much of it falls into the category of nice little touches that
make something that much easier to use. But there are also a bunch of “hey,
let’s see what the users can do with this” kind of new thing just to keep every-
one’s brain sharp. You’ll have your favorite new features, of course, but
because I’m writing the book, I get to tell you mine!
Interface Changes
If there’s one thing I hate, it’s a program that changes its user interface on
every version, just for the sake of change. That just makes me relearn what I
was already good at, without making me more productive. I wasn’t exactly
thrilled when I heard Adobe was changing the Creative Suite interface again.
Collapsing panels
But one interface change has wormed its way into my heart: the collapsing
panels. (Set them by enabling the Auto-Collapse Icon Panels in the Interface
pane of the Preferences dialog box; choose InDesign➪Preferences➪Interface
or press Ô+K on the Mac, or choose Edit➪Preferences➪Interface or press
Ctrl+K in Windows.)

The various panels at the side of the monitor remain easy to access with a
click of their names, and when you select a different panel, the last one you
worked on just slides back to the side of the monitor. As Figure 26-1 shows,
that saves clutter and does some work for me. Neat!
Page previews
InDesign CS3 now shows a preview image of your pages in the Pages panel.
That makes it easy to figure out what page you want to go to, thanks to the
visual reminder of what’s on each page. Plus this new feature works inside a
panel you’re using a lot anyhow, so it’s not taking up more screen space, like
the Navigator panel does (the previous way to get this visual aid).
You can control whether these page previews display by choosing Panel
Options from the panel’s flyout menu. In the Panel Options dialog box, select
the desired icon size and make sure Show Thumbnails is checked. You can
also set separate view settings for master pages.
Faster tool switching
InDesign CS3 introduces a quick new way to switch between the Selection
tool and the Direct Selection tool: Just double-click an object.

Part VIII: The Part of Tens 

Working with Layout Elements
Object manipulation is at the heart of what a layout program does, so it’s no
surprise there are some very cool additions in this area of InDesign.
Master-page import
This may seem like a “Doh! Why didn’t they think of that already?!” feature —
and it is. But it’s still wonderful to have: The ability to import master pages.
Before, you had to create a new master page in your document, and then
copy the elements from another document using old-fashioned copy-and-
paste. That’s a lot of work!
A nice touch is that if any of the imported master pages have the same name 
as your current document’s master pages (such as the default name A-Master), 
a dialog box appears, giving you the choice of replacing the current master
pages with the imported ones that use the same name or of renaming the
imported master pages, so you keep what you have and add the imported
ones. InDesign does the renaming for you. Likewise, InDesign will also alert 
you if the imported master pages use different dimensions than the current
document’s pages.
Object-level search
A really painstaking task in any layout is going through it to fix formatting 
to frames, lines, or other objects once the design standards have changed.
Previous versions of InDesign delivered one way to ease that burden — the
object styles feature described in Chapter 10 — but even if you use these
styles, you will still have local formatting applied to at least some objects
that can be a real pain to change throughout a layout.
That’s where the Object pane of the Find/Replace dialog box comes in. It lets
you replace attributes throughout your document, no matter what they are
applied to, using the familiar approach of search and replace. (Figure 26-2
shows that pane.) This is another of those “Well, that seems obvious” fea-
tures that for some reason never was obvious in the 20-plus-year history 
of desktop publishing software.
383
Chapter 26: Top Ten New Features in InDesign CS3

Reusable saved search queries
Bonus points for the new ability to save your searches — of objects, text, or
special characters — so you can reuse them over and over!
Lighting effects
No, you’re not using Photoshop. It really is InDesign CS3 that lets you apply
rich controls over transparency and lighting, so you can now create effects
such as embossing and beveled edges and control the intensity and direction
of shadows and light. As part of these enhancements, you’ll find a signifi-
cantly revised interface for transparency and related controls, not the least 
of which is the renaming of the Transparency pane to the Effects panel.
And not only are there a bunch of new lighting effects — inner shadow, outer
glow, inner glow, bevel and emboss, satin, directional feather, and gradient
feather — that you can apply individually or in combination, but InDesign
now also lets you apply these lighting effects to your choice of an object’s
frame, fill, or contents. You could get carried away and create altered-state
kinds of layouts, but I know you can control yourself. Figure 26-3 shows 
some examples.
Multiple file placement
You can now select multiple files — text and/or graphics — by Shift+clicking
a range or Ô+clicking or Ctrl+clicking multiple files one by one in the Place
dialog box. Just click once for each file imported, or Shift+Ô+click or

384
Part VIII: The Part of Tens 

Ctrl+Shift+click to have InDesign place all files on the page in separate
frames. The loaded-text icon or loaded-graphics icon will show the number 
of files to be placed — as well as a mini preview of each file so you know what
you’re placing at each step!
Plus, you can move through these icons using the left- and right-arrow keys,
so you can place these files in any order you want, not just in the order you
selected them originally.
Text Controls
The other heart of publishing is text: the typographic and other manipula-
tions of words on the page that make them more than mere words on a 
page. InDesign has long been super-powerful on the typographic front, so 
it’s cool that new capabilities in the text arena appear in other aspects of 
text handling — just to keep us from thinking that typography is all there 
is when it comes to text!
Text variables
With InDesign CS3’s new text variables, you can define an unlimited number
of text variables that InDesign will happily update across your documents
whenever you change them or your layout does. This capability may seem
prosaic, boring even. But it’s just the opposite.

Chapter 26: Top Ten New Features in InDesign CS3

Don’t be surprised to find yourself having InDesign automatically update
your page folios with chapter and section information, ensuring that the 
publication dates for the hundreds of reports you have to manage are always
correct, and even that the issue date is correct across all your magazine’s
pages. That’s the power of variable text!
Style groups
To help you find the desired style in documents that have dozens of them,
InDesign now lets you create style groups, which create a folder in the vari-
ous styles panels’ style list that you can open and close as desired. I realize
that this appeals to the “I love to organize” set — not the majority of free-
thinking designers whose style lists are littered with duplicate styles with
inconsistent names that meant something last week but not today. I’m not
that organized — I’ve never used a day planner, for example, and my filing
system is really a Post-its-and-piles system — but I hate searching for things I
use a lot. So style groups seem really cool to me, a way to put the styles I use
a lot in one place where I might actually find them! Give them a whirl.

QuarkXPress Refugees
In This Chapter
 Transferring QuarkXPress files to InDesign
 Understanding what works differently
You’ve jumped on the InDesign bandwagon after seeing everything it can
do. Your problem is that a lot of QuarkXPress is still stuck in your brain.
This chapter helps you make the mental switch so that you can become a
native InDesigner.
Also, consider picking up a copy of QuarkXPress to InDesign: Face to Face, by
Galen Gruman (Wiley Publishing, Inc.), which shows you side by side how to
do in InDesign what you know how to do in QuarkXPress.
Opening Those Old QuarkXPress Files
InDesign opens QuarkXPress and QuarkXPress Passport files — but only in
versions 3.3, 4.0, and 4.1. If InDesign sees any problems when opening these
files, it gives you an alert so you know what to fix in the converted file. After
the file opens, it is untitled, so you need to give it a new name.
Paying Attention to Selection Tool
Differences
If you’re a QuarkXPress veteran, the toughest thing about switching to
InDesign is the set of tools. InDesign’s Selection tool only lets you move and
resize objects, and the Direct Selection tool lets you reshape objects and
work with graphics. In InDesign, you use the Type tool to work with text, but
you can’t move or resize text frames while you’re using it.

Using Keyboard Shortcuts for Tools
Because InDesign requires a lot more switching among tools than
QuarkXPress, your mouse hand can tire very quickly. To avoid that, embrace
InDesign’s single-letter shortcuts for selecting tools.
Table 28-1 shows the shortcut translations for common activities.

Thinking Panels, Not Dialog Boxes
Keep in mind that many InDesign menu commands simply display a panel
(which may already be open) rather than showing a dialog box. Get used to
deciphering icons or using Tool Tips on the panels because InDesign doesn’t
have as many dialog boxes containing named fields as you’re used to in
QuarkXPress. Also, InDesign implements contextual menus on a broader
scale than QuarkXPress, so you can Control+click or right-click objects,
rulers, and more to make changes quickly.
Using Familiar Measurements
InDesign uses all of the QuarkXPress measurement abbreviations, as well as
its own. For example, InDesign accepts QuarkXPress’s use of " to indicate
inches, as well as InDesign’s own standard of in and inch.
Knowing Differences in Documents
By and large, documents in InDesign and QuarkXPress are the same. You
have master pages, layers, and pages. You can also set bleeds for objects 
that go beyond the page boundary. The biggest difference is that InDesign’s
master text frame lets you automatically flow text from page to page, whereas
the QuarkXPress equivalent (an automatic text box) places an empty text box
on each page for you to use as you see fit.
Working with Objects, Not Items
In QuarkXPress, you’re used to distinct items such as text boxes, picture
boxes, lines, and maybe text paths. In InDesign, you have more flexible
objects such as paths and frames that can contain graphics or text.

Chapter 28: Top Ten Must-Knows for QuarkXPress Refugees

Approaching Text from 
a New Perspective
In many cases, InDesign works with text very differently than QuarkXPress,
even though the fundamental capabilities are the same in both programs.
Veteran QuarkXPress users will be frustrated initially with InDesign’s more-
laborious approach to text flow and formatting, but will eventually appreciate
some of InDesign’s more powerful capabilities such as stroke formatting and
nested styles.
Starting with the Direct Selection Tool 
for Graphics
Importing and manipulating graphics in InDesign is very similar to
QuarkXPress. As long as you remember to use the Direct Selection tool to
select a graphic rather than its frame, you and the InDesign graphics features
will get along fine.
Paying Close Attention When Printing
InDesign and QuarkXPress offer many of the same output capabilities, such
as print styles (called print presets in InDesign), PDF export, color calibration,
and color separation support. But there are some notable differences beyond
the different organization of their Print dialog boxes. For example, InDesign
doesn’t have any options to change image contrast or line-screen element for
grayscale and black-and-white images, as QuarkXPress does. You need to
apply such effects in an image editor.

Chapter 29
Top Ten Must-Knows for
PageMaker Orphans
In This Chapter
 Transferring PageMaker files to InDesign
 Comparing how the two programs work
You’ve finally thrown in the towel. After all, it’s been eight years since the
last release of PageMaker, and both Windows and Mac OS X have made
PageMaker a real anachronism on your computer. So you’re making the
switch. Yet you have a lot of PageMaker still in your brain. This chapter helps
you shift your mental gears so that you can become an InDesign user.
Fortunately, Adobe has retained a lot of PageMaker’s approach in InDesign,
so you can mainly focus on what’s new rather than what’s different. The basic
methods for working with frames, lines, and pages are the same in both pro-
grams. What you get with InDesign is more control, with improved tools for
drawing, formatting text, and manipulating objects.
Open Those Old PageMaker Files
InDesign opens PageMaker files saved in versions 6.0, 6.5, and 7.0. If InDesign
sees any problems, it gives you an alert so you know what to fix in the con-
verted file. After the file opens, it is untitled. You need to give the file a new
name so that you don’t accidentally overwrite that original PageMaker file.

You Now Have Three Selection Tools
The basic selection, object-creation, and navigation tools in InDesign are 
similar to those in PageMaker, but InDesign has three selection tools:
 Use the Selection tool to move or resize objects.
 Use the Direct Selection tool to reshape objects, change the end points
of lines, and work with objects in groups. The Direct Selection tool also
works like PageMaker’s Crop tool, letting you move graphics within a
frame.
 Use the Position tool to do what you were used to doing with
PageMaker’s Crop tool. It duplicates some of the Selection tool’s func-
tionality and some of the Direct Selection tool’s functionality, so you
might want to throw away this PageMaker crutch and just use the two
native InDesign tools.
Switching Your Shortcuts
InDesign uses many different keyboard shortcuts than PageMaker did, so be
aware of the differences. Table 29-1 highlights the main differences.

Setting Aside Time to Set Preferences
You have so many preferences options in InDesign that you may wonder
whether you’ll ever leave the Preferences dialog box after you start setting
them! Fortunately, you can set preferences at any time, so go ahead and start
working with InDesign as it comes out of the box and then update prefer-
ences as specific needs arise.
Working with Objects, Not Elements
As with other aspects of InDesign, when you work with objects, you gain
more than you lose. The types of objects (called elements in PageMaker) are
similar — text frames, graphics frames, and lines — but InDesign offers more
variations of them and more controls over their formatting.
Don’t Worry Much about Text Differences
InDesign gives you more control over text formatting, such as the ability to
stroke and fill characters in InDesign. Note that there are no type-style but-
tons — InDesign requires you to choose the appropriate version of a typeface
rather than apply bold and italic to the general typeface. Other type styles
are listed in the Character panel’s flyout menu.
Don’t Worry Much about Graphics, Either
InDesign and PageMaker are very much alike when it comes to importing and
manipulating graphics. InDesign lets you click and drag graphics files into a
layout in addition to using the Place command (choose File➪Place or press
Ô+D or Ctrl+D), as well as create clipping paths and automatically scale
graphics or frames for you.

Chapter 29: Top Ten Must-Knows for PageMaker Orphans

A Different Way to Change Pages
The one feature you’ll miss about PageMaker is those neat little page icons in
the lower-left corner of the document window. In shorter documents espe-
cially, the icons provided a quick, easy method for jumping to pages. Get
used to using the Page Number text field and arrows at the bottom of the
document window or the buttons at the bottom of the Pages panel instead.
And to make the transition a little easier, note that you can use the Page
Number pop-up menu (at the bottom left of the document window, next to
the Page Number field) to get a pop-up list of pages, which is very similar to
the PageMaker page icons row.
Creating Colors Is Different
Most of your work with colors happens through the Swatches panel 
(choose Window➪Swatches or press F5) — not through the Colors panel, 
as PageMaker users might think. To share colors among documents, click 
and drag a colored object into another document window.
Using the Command Bar
In addition to adding the Position tool, which acts like PageMaker’s Crop tool,
InDesign offers the Command Bar panel (called the PageMaker toolbar in pre-
vious versions) that provides 30 iconic buttons (see Figure 29-1) to allow
quick access to various operations. You open and close this toolbar by
choosing Window➪Object & Layout➪Command Bar.

Bar panel.
