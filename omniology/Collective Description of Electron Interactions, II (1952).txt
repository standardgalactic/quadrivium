The behavior of the electrons in a dense electron gas is analyzed
in terms of their density
Quctuations.
These density
Quctuations
may be split into two components.
One component
is associated
with
the
organized
oscillation
of the system
as a whole,
the
so-called "plasma"'
oscillation.
The other is associated
with the
random
thermal
motion of the individual
electrons and shows no
collective behavior. It represents
a collection of individual
elec-
trons surrounded
by comoving
clouds of charge which screen the
electron
Gelds within a distance of the order of magnitude
of the
Debye length. This split up of the density Quctuations
corresponds
to an effective separation
of the Coulomb
interaction
into long-
range and short-range
parts; the separation
occurs at roughly
the
Debye length.
The relation
between
the individual
and collective aspects of
the electron
gas is discussed
in detail,
and a general
physical
picture of the behavior of the system is given. It is shown that for
phenomena
involving
distances
greater
than
the Debye length,
the system
behaves
collectively;
for distances
shorter
than
this
length, it may be treated
as a collection
of approximately
free
individual
particles, whose interactions
may be described in terms
of two-body
collisions.
This approach
is used to study
the interaction
of a specihed
electron with the remainder
of the electron gas. It is shown that
the collective part of the response
of this remainder
to the Geld
of the speciGed particle screens this Geld within a distance of the
order of the Debye length; this furnishes a detailed description
of
the screening
process. Moreover,
if the speciGed particle
moves
with greater
than
the mean
thermal
speed, it excites collective
oscillations
in the form of a wake trailing
the particle. The fre-
quency of these collective oscillations
and the energy emitted
by
the particle are calculated.
A correspondence
theoretical
method
is used to treat this phenomenon
for the electrons in a metal. The
results are in good agreement
with the experiments
of Ruthemann
and Lying on the energy
loss of kilovolt electrons in this metallic
Glms.
The generalization
of these
methods
to an arbitrary
inter-
particle
force is carried
out, and a criterion
is obtained
for the
validity
of a collective description
of the particle interactions. It
is shown
that strong forces and high particle
density
favor col-
lective behavior,
while high random
the'rmal
velocities oppose it.
L INTRODUCTION
N this paper we wish to develop a detailed
physical
- - picture of the behavior
of the electrons
in a dense
electron
gas. We do this with
the aid of a collective
description
of the particle motion. In a previous paper,
hereafter
referred to as I, we used a collective descrip-
tion in treating
the organized
behavior
of the electrons
resulting
from
the
transverse
electromagnetic
inter-
actions. This was done by means of a canonical
trans-
formation
to a set of collective coordinates
which were
appropriate
for a description
of the organized
behavior.
In the present
paper,
we are concerned
with
the or-
ganization
produced by the Coulomb interactions,
which
are far more important
quantitatively
than the trans-
verse
electromagnetic
interactions.
We
stress
the
physical
picture of thc clcctI'on bchRV1OI' helc

for the proper
development
and under-
standing
of the necessary
mathematical
formulation.
In a subsequent
paper we shall extend our results to the
quantum
theory
by developing
the
canonical
transâ„¢
formation
for the Coulomb
case in a manner
similar to
that given in I.
In a dense electron gas, the particles interact strongly
because of the long range of the Coulomb force; in fact,
each particle interacts simultaneously

particles.
As a result
the equations
of motion
become
extremely
diKcult
to solve. The
usual
perturbation

on the assumption
of a small

bI'cRks down. As
was the case in I, a collective description
provides a far
better starting
point for a solution
than a description
in terms of the individual
particles. For the collective
description
makes possible a simple method
of treating
the
simultaneous
interaction
ot many
electrons
(as
opposed
to the
individual
particles
approach
which
gives a simple method
ot treating
two-body
collisions).
Certain examples of collective behavior in an electron
gas are well known from the study of gaseous discharges.
These are the organized
oscillations
of the system as a
whole,
the "plasma"
oscillations. 2 3 These oscillations
have
been
studied
theoretically
with
the
simplifying
assumption
that the gas is composed
of a distribution
of beams of charge,
each beam having
a well-de6ned
velocity
at
each,
point
in
space. &~ This
approach,
although
it gives many
useful
and instructive
results
concerning
the oscillations,
represents
an excessive ab-
straction which is not capable of describing
many other
important
aspects of the organized
behavior
in the gas.

In this paper we start with a gas of interacting
point
electrons.
Instead
of
following
the
motion
of
the
individual
particles,
we describe the gas in terms of the
Fourier components
of the electron density at each point
in space. These Fourier components
are propor'&i~ nal to
the density
fluctuations
in the electron
gas. We find
that the density Quctuations
can bc split into two parts.
One part represents
an organized
oscillation
with the
characteristic
"plasma"
frequency,
and
is
clearly
associated
with the collective behavior
of the system.
The other part is associated
with the random
thermal
motion
of the individual
particles,
and
shows
no col-
lective behavior. For wavelengths
greater than a certain
critical length
Xn (the Debye length),
the fluctuations
are primarily
collective. When this is the case a descrip-
tion of the behavior
of the electrons
solely in terms of
their
collective
motion
is a good approximation.
For
wavelengths
smaller than ) g), however,
the fluctuations
are
primarily
associated
with
individual
particle
motion, and in this case the system is best described by
following
the -individual
paxticles.
We use the above split-up
of the density fluctuations
to study
the collective response
of the electron gas to
the held of an individual
charged particle moving
with
a speci6ed velocity,
vo. When
vo is less than the mean
thermal
speed of the gas, we find that the collective
response
is just such as to screen out the 6eld of the
specified particle within a distance of order of )~. When
vo is greater
than
the mean
thermal
speed, a similar
screening
occurs, but in addition
a new phenomenon
appears: vis. , the excitation of collective oscillations
in
the form of a wake trailing the particle. The phenomenon
resembles
the
Cerenkov
radiation
produced
by fast
electrons
in
dielectric
materials.
Experiments
by
Ruthemann
and Lang,
on the bombardment
of thin
metallic
films
by fast
electrons
tend
to verify
our
theoretical predictions
concerning
this type of excitation
of collective oscillations. ' ~
On the basis of the above results
we are led to the
following
physical
picture
of the screening
process. As
any electron
moves
through
the assembly,
the other
electrons
are
pushed.
away
from it by the Coulomb
repulsion.
Each particle is thus surrounded
by a cloud
of extent X~, in which there is a deficiency of electrons,
which
is responsible
for
screening
the
field
of the
particle
in question.
As a result of this screening,
the
cross section
for interparticle
collision
is so greatly
reduced that the mean-free
path of an electron is con-
siderably
greater
than the interparticle
spacing. Thus
for many purposes
the electron plus its associated cloud
may be xegarded
as an CGective free particle.
Tllc splitup
of the density
Quctuatlon
1nto collcctivc
and individual
particles
components
may be viewed in
the
following
way.
The
collective
part
includes
the
CGects of the long range
of the Coulomb
foxcc which
leads to the simultaneous
interact;on of many particles.
6 G. Ruthemann,
Ann phys. 2, &&3 (&948)
' W. Lang, Optic. 3, 233 (1948).
The
individual
particles
component
represents
the
density Quctuations
arising from the randomly
moving
individual
particles plus their comoving electron clouds,
and thus includes the CGects of the residual
short-range
screened Coulomb
force, which leads only to two-body
collisions.
Our main
conclusion
is that
neither
the collective
description
nor the individual
particles
description
of
the electron gas is by itself entirely
adequate.
For not
only
in
each
description
needed
in its appropriate
region, but also the interaction
between
collective and
individual
aspects dete'rmines
many important
proper-
ties of the system. Xt is just this synthesis
of individual
and collective aspects that makes the electron gas such
an exceptionally
interesting
medium.
There are a wide variety
of systems
to which
the
methods
developed
1n this pRpcl may bc applied. Some
of these are: (a) Ion gases of high density
(plasmas),
which occur in gaseous discharges,
interstellar
nebulae,
atmosphere
of sun and stars, ionosphere
of earth, etc.
(b) The electrons
and ions in a metal. The ions in a
metal
are also susceptible
to a collective
description,
and,
in interaction
with
electrons,
they
give rise to
sound
waves,
whose properties
can be calculated
with
the collective method. In this way, one can obtain an
improved
treatment
of the so-called "lattice-electron"
interaction,
which is important
in the theory of electrical
conductivity,
and probably
in superconductivity.
Xn Appendix II, we discuss the generalization
of these
methods
to
an
arbitrary
interparticle
force.
Pre-
liminary
considerations
indicate
that
the
collective
description
may be applicable
to the particles
in an
atomic nucleus. 9
II. COLLECTIVE OSCILLATION
We begin by a study of the way in which the &ntcr=
actions in an assembly
of electrons
bring about organ-
ized behavior
and coBective osciBation. We shall con-
sider
an
aggregate
of approximately
free
electrons
embedded
in a medium
of Axed positive charges whose
average
density
is equal to that of the electrons.
Fox
most purposes,
this distribution
of charge
can be re-
garded as unifoxmly
smeared out throughout
the entire
system. Hence, it merely serves to neutralize
the mean
electron
charge.
The
previous
simplifications
are
adequate
for the
treatment
of electron
behavior
in
gaseous discharges,
as well as in those metals in which
the CGects of the lattice periodicity
are not very im-
portant,
The approximations
used here
will also pro-
vide a good starting point for the investigation
of other
metals.
Each electron in the assexnbly
is acted on by the sum
of the forces arising from all of the other electrons plus
This problem
is now under
investigation
by one of us (D.B.)
and T. Staver. Preliminary
results
are given
in Phys. Rev. 84,

We shall
find it more
convenient
to work
with
the
Fourier components,

"The exclusion
of the term with k=0 takes into account the
uniform
background
of positive
charge,
and hence
the over-all
charge
neutrality
of the system.
This may
readily
be seen by
Fourier-analyzing
the
electron
charge

and
noting
that

corresponding
to 4=0 describes
the
mean
density
of electrons
which
is canceled
by the equal
density
of

distributed
positive charge. The Fourier-expansion
for
the potential at a given point there fore does not contain the term
with k=0.
where
the
prime
denotes
a sum
in
which k=0 is
excluded. " (In the previous
sum,
the term
with j =i
should
also
be excluded.
However,
since
1/k'
is a
spherically
symmetric
function
of k, this term averages
out to zero and therefore
does not have to be explicitly
excluded. )
Equation
(2) is in general extremely
dificult
to solve
by following
the motions
of the individual
particles,
especially
when
the assembly
is so dense that
many-
body collisions become important.
Moreover,
the range
of the Coulomb
potential
is so great that many-body
collisions are important
even in an electron gas of low
density.
Under
these
conditions,
the
electrons
move
together
in organized
fashion,
and one finds the well-
known
phenomenon
of "plasma"
oscillations
of the
system as a whole. ' In these cases the usual method
of
approximation
in solving
(2) which
involves
the as-
sumption
that
the
interaction
forces
produce
small
perturbations
on uniform
straight
line particle motion,
fails. Our approach to the equations
of motion is aimed
at making use of the simplicity of the collective behavior
as a starting point for a tractable
solution. We shall see
that this method leads to a far better description
of the
motion than one based solely on following the individual
particles.
We shall be primarily
concerned
with two questions:
the description
of the motion
of the particle
assembly
in terms of its collective behavior,
and the limits on the
applicability
of such a collective description,
As a first
step, we study the fluctuations
in the particle
density,
because, as we shall see, their behavior
provides a good
measure
of the applicability
of a collective description.
We assume,
for all practical
purposes,
that
we are
dealing with point particles, so that the particle density
in our box of unit volume
is given by,
p(x) =g; 8(xâ€”x;).
We note that
po represents
the mean electron density,
n, and the pj, with k@0 describe fluctuations
about that
mean
density. It is readily
verified that the equations
of motion (2), may be re-expressed
as
i =
(4â€”
s e'i/m)g'r, (k/k') pr,e'" *'
(6)
The p~ thus determine
the force acting on each particle.
We now
obtain
the equations
describing
the
time
behavior
of the pq. On di8erentiating
(4), we have

The first term on the right-hand
side of (9) is one that
would be present
even in the absence of particle inter-
action,
and
arises
simply
from
the
r'andom
thermal
motion
of the individual
particles.
The second
term
represents
the eGects of particle
interactions.
For suf-
ficiently
small k it is clear that the first term
can be
neglected
in comparison
with the second. Under
these
conditions,
(9) becomes

(8).
It is in the treatment
of the second term on the right-
hand
side of the previous
equation
that we encounter
one of the central approximations
used in the develop-
ment of a collective description.
For we split the sum
over k' into two parts. The first part,
,with k'=k, is
independent
of the coordinate, x;, so that the sum over
i yields
m, the total number
of particles. "The second
part,
(those terms
with k'Nk)
contains
phase factors
expi(k' â€”k) x;, which
depend
on the positions
of the
particles.
These
terms
tend
to average
out to zero,
since there
are a very
large
number
of particles
dis-
tributed
very
nearly
in random
positions.
As a first
approximation,
we neglect such terms. This procedure
we call the random
phase approximation.
The validity
of this approximation
will be demonstrated
in detail in
Sec. VI. Using
the random
phase
approximation,
we
then obtain

ELECTRON
INTERACTIONS
Thus, as a result of the Coulomb interaction,

quency,

to a sound wave.
Let us now consider
the physical
significance
of the
terms which determine
the time variation
of the py. In
the absence
of interaction,
each particle
moves
in a
straight
line with a constant
velocity,
vo,. In this case
x;=xo;+vo,t, and
pq takes the form
e (xo +vo ~)
k
In order that p~' be large at a particular
time, say I,=O,
it is necessary
that the xo; be so distributed
that the
various
terms e'"' 0' arising from each particle
tend to
be'in
phase.
However,
each of these
terms
oscillates
with an angular
frequency
k vo;, which
is, in general,
diferent
from that of any other. Consequently,
even if
they
initially
have
definite
phase
relations,
the con-
tribution
of diferent
particles
to pI, will soon tend to
get out of phase and cancel each other. This means that
in a gas of free particles a particular
Quctuation
cannot
persist for an appreciable
length of time. The tendency
of the random
motion of each particle to contribute
a
term to the density
variation
having
an angular
fre-
quency,
&o=k v;, is reflected
in the first term
on the
right-hand
side of (9), which by itself would result in a
similar
type of time variation
of the
p&. Ke conclude
then that a collection of free particles shows no organized
behavior,
but that instead
its characteristic
property
is that a disturbance
tends to die out as a result of the
random
diffusion
of the particles.
On the other hand,
the effect of the Coulomb force of interaction,
appearing
in the second term on the right-hand
side of (9), is to
cause each particle to make a contribution
to d'pI, /dP
which
oscillates
with
the same
angular
frequency
as
that of every other particle. Thus, if the random thermal
motions
were
not present
the Coulomb
forces would
produce
perfectly
organized
behavior
of
the
p~.
Actually,
of course, both the Coulomb
forces and the
random
thermal
motions
are present
simultaneously,
so that the net behavior
of the electron gas will show
some collective aspects and some of the aspects of an
aggregate
of randomly
moving
individual
particles. To
the extent that the effects of the Coulomb
forces pre-
dominate
in determining
d'p/dk',
the gas will display
primarily
its collective aspect because the pI, determine
the force on each particle and therefore
the behavior of
the entire system. On the other hand, when the random
individual
particle motions predominate
in determining
d'pg/dP,
the
collective
description
will
be
inappro-
priate, and a description
of the system
in terms of the
motions
of the individual
particles
becomes
a better
starting point. A rough criterion for the applicability
of
R collective
description
is
therefore
that
for
most
particles the collective term in (9) be much greater than
the term arising
from the random
thermal
individual
particle motions,

this
case
XD clearly
cannot
constitute
the
minimum
distance at'which
organization
becomes important,
since it is less
than
the interparticle
spacing.
However,
this indicates
that the
organization
is very important
for the electrons
in a metal, since
it does extend
down to regions of the order of the interparticle
spacing.
The appropriate

constant,
and )~ is the well-
known Debye length "defined by

â€”(~T/4nne') =-(1/3) L((v ')Aâ€ž)/(ui 'j.
(15)
This means that in a collection of electrons,
organized
behavior
is most important
in phenomena
connected
with
distances
greater
than
X~, while
for phenomena
connected
with
shorter
distances
the individual
par-
tides point
of view provides
the best starting
point.
This result has already
been obtained
by other inves-
tigators
using diferent
methods. "It is because of the
long range of the Coulomb
force {asexpressed
in terms
of the 1/k' in its Fourier component)
that the collective
approximation
is sure to apply
if one goes to large
enough
wavelengths
(X& Xn). A long-range
force favors
the
collective
approximation
at
long
wavelengths,
because a large number of particles can be made to con-
tribute
cumulatively
to a collective
oscillation
in the
charge density.
It is of interest
to evaluate
XD for a few examples.

As in Kq. (8), the terms with k'Ak in the sum on the

in the random

Retaining
only the terms
with k'=k,
we then
obtain

In order
that

for sufFiciently

be expanded
in a series of

we obtain

for the validity

our criterion
for the applicability
of the collective description,

This

con6rms
our
general
physical
picture
in
which
the collective description
is to be used only for
distances )X~. Furthermore,
over almost all values of

the approximate
dis-
persion relation
(24) is valid.

uI, is a suitable constant,
which will be chosen by
methods to be developed
presently.
The first part, u&qlâ€ž
is clearly a collectively
describable
part of pI,. We shall
see that a choice of aI, is possible such that
gI, describes
fluctuations
associated
only with
the random
thermal
motions
of the individual
particles.
Moreover,
the

will be shown to be the Fourier coeKcients of a density
distribution
in which each electron is surrounded
by a
comoving
cloud
containing
a deficiency
of electrons,
which
screens the field of the given electron
within
a
distance of the order of ~~.
We begin
with
a consideration'
of (25) for
k
kD,
where
kg&=(1/Xn). Using
our definition

' The
mean
kinetic
energy
will
depend
both
on
the
tem-
perature,
which
determines
the random
thermal
motion,
and on
the
amplitude
of organized
oscillation.
Normally,
the
thermal
energy
is much greater
than
the organized
oscillation
energy,
so
that
for all practical
purposes,
the frequency
does not depend
appreciably
on the amplitude
of organized
oscillation. The slight
dependence
on amplitude
resembles
a similar
phenomenon
ob-
tained in connection
with sound waves, which likewise increase in
frequency
as their
amplitude
increases.
In any case, the entire
effect is in the domain of the nonlinear
aspects of the problem,
and
therefore
can be neglected
in a linear approximation.
Within
the
linear approximation,
the (v')pâ€žappearing
in the dispersion
relation
should be the value existing in the absence of organized
oscillation.
IIL SEPARATION
BETWEEN COLLECTIVE AND
INDIVIDUAL
COMPONENTS
OF DENSITY
FLUCTUATIONS
We have seen that the density
fluctuations,
pIâ€žcan,
for su%.ciently small k, be described
almost entirely
in
terms
of the collective
coordinate,
q~. On the
other
hand,
since
there
are
no collective
coordinates
for
k~X& ', the density
fluctuations
here must
be asso-
ciated primarily
with
the random
thermal
motions
of
the individual
particles. For intermediate
values of k,
both types of Quctuations
may be expected to be sig-
nihcant.
In this section, we shall treat the problem
of
separating
individual
and collective aspects of a general
Quctuation
by splitting
p& into two parts as follows,

(32)
With these definitions,
we see that the charge density
has split into two independent
parts. One of these,
qk,
oscillates
harmonically
with
frequency
co, and can be
given an arbitrary
amplitude
of oscillation
dependent
on the boundary
conditions.
The other part,
qk, has no
collective
behavior,
and
is
therefore
best
regarded
simply
as the sum of independent
contributions
from
individual
particles.
This part
is present
even in the
absence of organized
oscillation.
When k&k~, there are no collective
coordinates,
so
that

p)â€ž(or )))), in this region
does
not satisfy an equation
of motion like (27) since we still
have the second term on the right-hand
side of (9), ()is.,
ap'pk, in the expression for jk. However,
for values of k
appreciably
greater than
k& this term is negligible,
and
hence, except for a region of k
ka, which we shall see
is of no great importance
iii most problems,
we may
regard
))& as satisfying
(27) for all values of k.
We now wish to investigate
in detail the meaning
of
the density
fluctuations.
To do this,
we consider
the
contribution
to
the
spatial
distribution
of electron
density
arising from that part of yk associated with the
With an arbitrary
choice of a),, ii)â€ž like d'p), /dP in Eq. (9),
may be expected to have two kinds of terms. The first
kind are those we obtain in the absence of interparticle
forces, (in which case i),=0), and are
ij), "=Q;

(â€”

These arise from
the random
thermal
motion
of the
particles,
and can in no way possess an organized
com-
ponent.
The second
kind
arise because
of the inter-
particle forces, and, like the second term on the right-
hand
side of (9), represent
the organized
behavior
of
the system. To insure
that
pk has no collective
com-
ponent,
we must choose ak in such a way that terms of
this second kind vanish and ij), is given by (27).
Using Eqs. (9) and (19), we obtain

we have
continued

This may be rearranged
as

The cloud

in
shape,
being
shortened
in
the
direction
of particle
motion by the ratio (nâ€ž) '. It should
be noted that for
those
particles
with vâ€ž')(v')a, the present
treatment
fails. This case will be discussed
in Sec. IV. Here we
restrict
ourselves
to those particles
moving
with
less
than the mean thermal
speed, [(v')a,]&.
The computation
of the potential
arising
from the
charge
density â€”epâ€ž is complicated
by the elliptical
shape of the electron cloud. To get a rough estimate
of
this potential,
we consider the special case of a particle
at rest. For this case the cloud
is spherical
and
the
potential
is found to be
exp Iâ€”
I xâ€”x, I (cop'/(v')a )Â«}
Ixâ€”x, I
This is a screened
Coulomb
potential
with a screening
radius of the order of X~.
More generally
we can. see that screening
still takes
place in a distance
of the order of XD when
vâ€ž takes a
nonzero
value.
We recall
that
the electrons
are em-
bedded
in a uniform
distribution
of positive
charge. If
the negative charge distribution
were perfectly uniform,
the electric field would vanish. However,
the field does
not vanish
since we have a collection of negative
point
charges
which produce
local fluctuations
whose Fourier
components
are the pI,. Let us fix our attention
on the
individual
particles
component
pâ€ž(x) of the
density
associated with the rth particle as given by (40).Without
the comoving
cloud described
by the second
term
on
the right-hand
side of (40), the density
is a 8-function,
which
gives
rise
to
a
simple
Coulomb
potential
â€”e/Ix â€”xâ€žI. The comoving
cloud represents
a region
from which
electrons
have been displaced
by the re-
pulsive Coulomb potential of the rth electron. As a result
this region contains
a net positive
charge. In fact the
total net positive charge may be obtained by integrating
our expression
for the electron
deficiency [as obtained
from (40)7 over all space, and the result is readily
seen
to be unity. Since most of this charge is clearly within
a region
XD surrounding
the electron, we may deduce
from Gauss'
theorem
that the electric field associated
with
this
electron
becomes
negligible
at
distances
greater
than )y from the electron. This constitutes
a
ga= (i0i /2&) ($a, ~â€”$a, â€”~).

of the electron gas. Although
this

be shown in Sec. IV that similar conclusions
apply to the
remaining

IV. EXCITATION
OF COLLECTIVE OSCILLATIONS
AND
SCREENING
In this section,
we study
the collective
response
of
the electron gas to an individual
particle moving through
the system with velocity
vp. We first show that if vp is
less than
approximately
the mean
thermal
speed, the
particles of the electron gas respond
in such a way that
when a steady state is finally
established,
the Geld of
the particle
is screened
out within
a distance
of the
order of X&. In this way,
we obtain
a more detailed
understanding
of how the screening,
discussed
in Sec.
III, is brought
about. We then show that if vp is more
than approximately
the mean thermal
speed, the field
of the particle continues to be screened, but a new phe-
nomenon
appears,
vis. , the excitation
of a wake con-
sisting of collective oscillations
that carry energy away
from the particle. This wake
resembles
the Cerenkov
radiation
obtained
when
fast electrons
go through
a
dielectric. We find that the energy loss to the collective
oscillations
is of the same order of magnitude
as the
loss caused by short-range
Coulomb
collisions with the
individual
particles.
We begin by Fourier-analyzing
the charge density of
the specified particle,
moving
with a constant velocity,
Vp

(41)
Our problem
is to calculate the response of the qI, to the
field produced
by p,. We recall that

Equation
(46) describes a forced harmonic
oscillation.
A particular
solution
which
describes
the steady-state
response of the Fourier component
of the collective part
of the charge density
to the field of the specified par-
ticle is given by"

(47)
We exclude for the time being
the case in which
the
denominator
of (47) vanishes.
To obtain
the Fourier
component
of the total charge density
associated
with
the specified
particle,
we must
add
the density
(45)
coming from the charge itself. We get
t~ =(1â€”[~~'/I 'â€”(k vo)'I3) ""'
(4g)
The charge density
as a function
of position
is
[or'â€”

(49)
However,
Kq. (49) is formally
equivalent
to it, (x) (see
Eq. (35)). Thus we can conclude
that when a particle
moves through
the electron gas with less than the mean
thermal
speed,
the collective
response
to its electric
field is just such as to screen out that
field within
a
distance
of the order of magnitude
of )~. This is the
origin of the screening
cloud discussed
in the previous
section.
"In obtaining
this solution
we have taken
vp as constant. This
will be a good approximation
as long as the change
in velocity
during
the period of an oscillation
is small compared
to vp, which
is the case in most electron gases. See Section V.

We must
now solve (46) with the correct boundary
conditions
for the resonant
case. The proper
cho'ice of
boundary
conditions
can be seen from
the
following
considerations.
The
group
velocity
of the
collective
oscillations,
which
measures
the speed
with
which
a
disturbance
is propagated,
is given by
v,= (die/dk)=[k(v')Aâ€ž/ie'j
The maximum
value of eâ€žobtained by setting k= k~, is
[43(v')â€žâ€žj&.A particle
moving
with a speed high enough
to excite oscillation
therefore
runs
ahead
of the dis-
turbance
that it creates. Hence, as is well known,
the
disturbance
will take the form of a wake trailing behind
the particle. The correct boundary
condition for excita-
tion is, therefore, that no disturbance
exist ahead of the
particle.
This
situation
can
be
contrasted
to that
existing
when
v02(4(v')A, . In the latter
case the dis-
turbance
can propagate
ahead of the particle,
so that
the
field
around
the
particle
ultimately
reaches
a
steady state. (Actually a steady state is reached as long
as the condition
(50) cannot be satisfied, but the use of
the expansion
(24) for
&o' is not permissible
near the
Debye
length.
This
is the
origin
of the discrepancy
between
our estimated
maximum
speed of transmission
of
a
disturbance
[4(v')iâ€žl~
and
minimum
speed,
(voâ€”
â€”[(4/3)(v )i,j'), at which
excitation
of collective
oscillation
can occur.)
To solve the boundary
condition
problem,
we Grst
consider
q(x) obtained
from
the
q& given
in (46) by
q(x)= Q qie'" *
k&k~

(52a)
We now consider
a particle
moving
with a velocity
vo such that
the denominator
of (47) can vanish
for
some k&kD, i.e., such that
(k vo)'= ie'=(op'+k'(ii')Aâ€ž
(50)
For those
values
of k such
that
(50) is satisfied,
a
steady-state
solution
for
q& is impossible,
since as can
be seen from (46), the correct solution corresponds
to a
resonant
excitation
of the appropriate
ql,. I et us now
find the value of k and vo such that (50) can be satisfied.
Taking k, in the direction
of vo, we obtain
P 2(e 2
(v2) )â€”~ 2+(P 2+t't 2)(v2)
It is immediately
evident
that
real solutions
of (51)
cannot exist when
v02 is less than (e')iâ€žso that particles
moving
with less than the mean thermal
speed will not
excite collective oscillations.
The minimum
value of eo
for which collective oscillations
can be excited may be
found by setting k =kâ€ž=0, and k, equal to its maximum
value kD. The criterion for excitation becomes

k,'â€”a}(&op'+(k '+k ')(v')A, )/(vQ' â€”(v')A, )j&.
(53)
In the summation
over k, it will be seen to be mathe-
matically
convenient
to
extend
our
limits
from
&(knÂ» â€”k,'â€”kâ€ž')~ to & Qo.
This
will
certainly
be
justified
for
vQ sufliciently
larger
than
(v')Aâ€ž& and
will
provide
an order of magnitude
estimate
for all values
of vp. For with
vp sufFiciently
large, almost all values of
k,' will lie within
the limits &(kn' â€”k,'â€”kâ€ž')&, and the
denominator
of (52b) will be large for the values of k,
outside
these
limits.
Hence,
in this case a negligible
error is introduced
by extending
the range of integration
to + QQ. (For
vQ comparable
with
(v')Aâ€ž&, the error may
become appreciable,
and a more detailed
calculation
is
required. ) Thus we obtain,

The boundary

may
be introduced,

by integrating
over
the complex

and choosing a suitable
path of
integration.
It has been
shown
that
q(x) should

respond

To
insure that there is no disturbance

we require
that q(x) vanish

The precise form of q(x) is of no great interest
to us
here, as we shall be mainly
interested
in computing
the
energy
given up by the incident
particle to the wake.
This is determined
by the reaction of the electric held
of the wake on the emitting
particle
located at x=vph
or x=0, y=0, s=vpt. ' %e need

for s) vpt and is finite for

at
2'=vpt, and hence,
according
to a well-known
property
of Fourier
series,
the correct value at z=vpt
is the
sum
taken
by ap-
proaching
this point
from both
sides. Thus
we take
(~Â»)8,(vQt) as approached
from the left. A little algebra
shows that
8,(vQt) =â€”
" "dkgkâ€ž
u&g'+(k '+k ')v '
(56)
The force on the particle caused by the wake is thus
F,=â€”e8,(vQt).
(57)
On performing
the integration,
using polar coordinates,
and taking
(k '+kâ€ž') â€”
(-',)kD'= 2QQg '/(v')Aâ€ž,
we get:
Fg= (e'Mp'/2vQ')
In(1+2vQ'/(v')Ay).
(58)
The limits of integration
of (56) were loosely de6ned,
but since the integral
has a logarithmic
dependence
on
the actual
limits
the result
is insensitive
to the exact
limits
taken.
Thus
the rate
of energy
loss per unit
distance dE/dÂ» which is equal to F, is
(dE/dÂ») '"= (Qrne'/EQ) ln(1+ 2vQQ/(v')â€žâ€ž),
(59a)
where Ep is the energy of the incident particle.
Thus far we have only considered
the energy
given
up by the specihed particle to the collective oscillations.
It can also transfer energy to the individual
particles in
short-range
collisions.
The local electric
held
around
each particle in the electron gas, as we have seen, cor-
responds
to a screened
Coulomb
potential
of range

arising
from the
p& contribution
to the charge density.
"We here are calculating
the eBects of the q{x) on the particle
at a distance for which the concept of a q(x) is clearly not applic-
able, since we are certainly
less than a Debye length removed from
the particle.
Nevertheless
the reacting
force may
be obtained
correctly in this way. For the energy is carried away by the radia-
tion at long distances,
where
the q(x) can correctly
be applied.
Because energy is conserved,
this energy can come only from the
incident particle. Therefore, by formally
extrapolating
the theory
into distances
below
those for which its physical
application
is
correct, we are able to obtain
the correct energy loss.

When
the specified
particle
enters
the
range
of this
force it can transfer
energy
by means
of a collision.
This transfer is essentially
independent
of the excitation
of collective
oscillations,
and
can best be calculated
with
aid of the usual
collision
theory
applied
to the
individual
particles.
One
finds
that
the
energy
loss
resulting
from
these
short-range
collisions
is
ap-
proximately
(dE/ds)
&'&= (27rne4/E0) in(XDE0/e').
(59b)
It is clear that the two modes of energy loss, described
by (59a) and (59b), will generally
be of the same order
of magnitude.
Experiments
by Ruthemann
and Lang'
on energy
loss of electrons of energies of the order of 1 to 10 kev
in thin
films of metal
tend to confirm
our theoretical
prediction
of Cerenkov-like
radiation.
Although
the
quantum
theory should be used in a rigorous treatment
of a metal (and will be used in a subsequent
paper), the
right results for this problem
can be obtained
by using
a correspondence
principle
argument.
We first
note
that electrons
must emit energy
in the form of quanta
with E=Lr. The probability
of emission of a quantum
may be estimated
from the requirement
that the mean
energy
radiated
be equal to the classically
calculated
value.
We
then
obtain
for
the
number
of quanta
emitted per unit path length,
(dX/dh) = (1/kryo) (dE/dx).
The mean free path for emission
of a quantum
is the
reciprocal of this expression,
and is thus given by
srne4 ln(1+ 2p00/(p')A, )
We might
expect that the fundamental
quantum
of
energy
loss should
be quite
close to korI. To see this,
we note first, using Eq. (53), that for large
p0, k, must
be close to 00p/p0, which is small. From Eq. (56) we see
that
the major
contribution
to the decelerating
field
comes when (k,'+kâ€ž') & (&pi%0'). Thus we conclude that
40'=00p'+k'(p')Aâ€žmust
be close to 00~'[1+((p')A/v00)7
=co&'. The experiments
quoted previously
indicate that
the electrons
actually
do lose energy
in integral
mul-
tiples of a fairly sharply
defined basic unit. For Al this
unit is 14.7 ev, and for Be 19.0 ev. Our calculated
k~~
for these metals, under the assumption
that the valence
electrons are all free, is 15.9 ev for Al and 18.8 ev for Be.
These results
are in remarkably
good agreement
with
experiment,
since the e6'ective number
of free electrons
probably
differs somewhat
from the number
of valence
electrons.
Lang has given data on the thickness of his films, from
which
one can conclude
that
the mean
free path
for
emission
of a quantum
is somewhat
less than
185A.
This compares
favorably
with our theoretical
value of
150A for this case. A more detailed
study
of these
problems
will be given in a subsequent
paper.
In
conclusion,
we
now
show,
without
giving
a
detailed
calculation,
that
the collective
response
q(x)
screens the field of a specified particle of any velocity.
To do this, we show that
th,e total responding
charge
â€”eq(x) integrated
over a small sphere surrounding
the
incident particle is nearly equal to, and of opposite sign,
to that of the incident particle.
From (52a), we obtain
for such
an integral

sphere of radius R surrounding

and hence,

(62)
The expression
inside the bracket is a sharply peaked
function
of k which approaches
a Dirac 8 function
in k
space at large R, and is negligible
for kR&1. For suf-
ficiently
large R, the sum over k yields just the value
of 40+'/[&0' â€”(k.p0)'] at k=0, which is unity. Thus for
a sufIiciently
large R, which we denote by Râ€ž the total
charge associated
with the collective response
is equal
in
magnitude
and
opposite
in
sign
to the
incident
charge. Thus the incident
charge is screened out within
a distance R,.The order of magnitude
ofRâ€žthe effective
screening
radius,
may be seen from the following
argu-
ment. In order that the charge be screened,
the half-
width k=(1/R, ) must be sufficiently
narrow
so that the
ratio
Mi '/[00' â€”(14 v0)'] shall be close to unity. If there
is no singularity
in the denominator,
this ratio will be
close to unity for k up to
k~, so that R,â€”
XD. If there
is a singularity,
then the ratio will be unity
only up to
the
neighborhood
of k=k, or
kD, whichever
is the
smaller.
Thus R.= An or 1/k. , whichever
is the larger.
Since high velocity incident particles may have a small
kâ€ž in these cases the screening
will not be as good as
for a low velocity particle.
We conclude
that
the field of each particle
in the
electron
gas is screened
as the result of the collective
response
of all the other particles. For most particles,
the
field
is e6'ectively
screened
within
a distance
of
approximately
AD. For those few particles
with
much
higher
than mean
thermal
speed, the screening
radius
may be somewhat
greater than
XD. These particles also
excite collective
oscillation,
and in fact this excitation

AND
D. BOB M
is one of the
means
of bringing
such
particles
into
therIDRI equilibrium
with the rest of the assembly. The
excitation
of collective
oscillations
is a consequence
of
the long-range
part of the Coulomb
interactions;
one
' may regard it as a description
of the CGect of the simul-
taneous many-body
collisions brought by the long range
of
the
force.
The
remaining
screened
short-range
Coulomb interactions
can, as we have seen, be described
in terms of the usual
two-body
collision
theory. Thus
we see that the use of an individual
particle
model for
an electron
gas is just~fied
in the treatment
of phe-
nomena
involving
distances less than the Debye length.
V. THE ROLE OF INDIVIDUAL
PARTICLES IN
ORGANIZED
BEHAVIOR
In this section we wish to develop a physical picture
of the motion
of the individual
particles
as they take
part in the collective motion. We first consider the state
of the electron gas in the absence of co11ective oscilla-
tion, i.e., when the
ql, and jI, a,re zero for all k. In this
state, we have
'/I 'â€”(k
')'Ij ""'=
(
)
p'L(k
vo )s&zo/I&a â€”(k vo;)oI]e '"'*"=0, (63b)
where xo; and vo; are the position and velocity of the ith
particle
in the absence
of organized
oscillation.
The
state of no collective oscillation described by (63a) and
(63b) differs from a state in which
the particles
move
in a completely
random
way,
as would
exist in the
absence of interaction.
In the absence of interaction
the particles
move in
straight
lines
with
constant
velocities.
This
n1otlon
produces
random
Quctuations
in the particle
density
which
make the most likely
absolute
value
of q& dif-
ferent from zero. To see this, consider (l q~

Since the
particles
are distributed
at random,
only
those terms with i=j contribute
to the average, and for
small k one then obtains approximately.
(l~ I'&"=~
Thus we see that the particles
in the state of lowest
collective
energy
cannot
move
in straight
lines
and
possess
a randon1
distribution
of positions.
Instead
there must be Quctuations
in particle velocities resulting
from the Coulomb
interaction

this state,
the

to
qp, the
individual
particles part, which for small k is much less
than
p~. Thus these correlations
produce
the screening
of the field of each individual
particle by the electron

Since for small k, qg is very nearly
equal to pgâ€žwc

but does not correspond
to

It will
be shown
in
Appendix
I, however,
that the state of thermal

librium
is not far from
the state of lowest

It is dificult to solve in detail for the motion of the
particle
in the state
of zero
oscillation.
One of the
advantages
of the collective description
is that. detailed
solutions
for this motion
are not required.
Since each
particle
moves
in the screened
Coulomb
field of the
other
particles,
its
motion
will
usually
not
diGer
markedly
from straight
line motion. An estimate of the
validity
of the uniform
straight
line motion assumption
may be obtained
by comparing
the mean-free
path for
collision
(because of the screened
Coulomb force) with
the
interparticle
distance. It should
be emphasized
here that the assumption
that the particles
in an elec-
tron gas are approximately
independent
(free) is valid
only because the organized
behavior acts to screen out
the long-range
part of the Coulomb
interparticle
force.
I.et us now consider the way in which the motion of
the individual
particles changes as a result of collective
oscillation.
We solve
for the
motion
of the particle
under the assumption
that its motion in the absence of
oscillation
can be approximated
as uniform,
rectilinear
motion. This approximation
will be suitable
when
the
fractional
Quctuations
of the particle velocity resulting
from
the short-range
screened
Coulomb
interparticle
forces are
sma11 during
the period
of an oscillation.
These Quctuations
will be small provided
the mean-free
path for short-range
collisions
is considerably
greater
than
the distance
covered by the particle
during
this
period,
which
is approximately
X~. This criterion
is
satisfied
in all electron
gases of interest.
Under
these
circumstances
the short-range
collisions
give rise only
to a small damping
of the organized
oscillation,
with a
damping
time r= o.o(l/Xz), where
ro is the period of an
oscillation
and
/ is the mean free path. " When l is of
the order
of magnitude
of XD, the
wh, olc concept
of
organized
oscillations
becomes doubtful.
In the straight-line
approximation

in the
absence of oscillation,

x;=xo,+hxi,
vi=voi+8vi.

We obtain the equations
of motion
for bx; and 6v; by
substituting
(67) into
the
equations
of motion
(6),
using
p~ â€”â€”q~+qi. However,
the use of the straight-line
approximation
for the motion
of the particles
in the
absence
of oscillation
is equivalent
to neglecting
the
force arising
from the individual
particles
part of the
charge density,
qJ,. Thus we may write
tion (75) is identical
with
the dispersion
relation
(23)
derived earlier. Thus our dispersion
relation guarantees
the self-consistency
of our assumption
of the collective
oscillation arising from the cumulative
small response of
the individual
particles to the collective 6eld.
The
consistency
of the
separation
of the

requires
that glâ€ž in the

for a specific ease. The

In order that the part of the charge density arising from

that the

the average

the value of8 would tend
to undergo

These

would produce a corresponding

provided.
we can show
that the effects of these Quctuations
can be neglected.
Before we attempt to estimate the size of R, it will be
convenient
to rewrite
it
in a
form
which
groups
together
certain
pairs of terms
having
dehnite
phase
relations.
To do this,
we interchange
i and J in (77)
and replace k' by k' â€”k. Since the substitutions
do not
change the value of the sum, we can re-express R as the

[p(x;)]'= (4v.e)s p [psps /k'(k')'] exp[i(k+k') x,)
We shall average

than
the
[k'(v')s, /a&p'] correction
which
a,rises when
we consider
the e8ect of thermal
motions. In the case described,
the
Quctuations
produce
a fractional
correction
of about
10â€”' in the [k'(v')A, /a&i s] term
The
correction
(1/20)(a/XD)&
would
only
become
appreciable
for X&Â«a. Such cases occur in practice only
for degenerate
electron gases. In these cases, however,
Fermi statistics
reduce
the eBects of the fluctuations
relative to the Boltzmann
estimate,
so that the random
phase approximation
will still be justified. This problem
will be considered
in our paper extending
these results
to the quantum
theory.
It can be shown by arguments
similar to the foregoing
that the remaining
terms in R are of the same order of
magnitude
as R' or smaller.
A similar justification
can
be applied
for the use of the random
phase approxima-
tion elsewhere
in this paper.
VII. CONCLUSION
In conclusion
we give a brief summary
of our results
in terms
of a physical
picture
of the behavior
of the
electron gas. As we have seen, the density
Ructuations
can be split into two approximately
independent
com-
ponents, associated, respectively,
with the collective and
individual
particle
aspects
of the assembly.
The col-
lective component,
which is present only for wavelengths
& X~, represents
organized
oscillation brought about by
the long-range
part of the Coulomb
interaction.
When

ELECTRON
I NTERACTIONS
35i
such an oscillation
is excited, each individual
particle
suGers a small perturbation
of its velocity and position
arising
from
the combined
potential
of all the other
particles. The contribution
to the density
Quctuations
resulting
from these perturbations
is in phase with the
potential
producing
it, so that in an oscillation
we find
a small organized
wave-like perturbation
superposed
on
the much larger random
thermal
motion of the particle.
The cumulative
potential
of all the particles may, how-
ever, be considerable
because the long range of the force
permits
a very large number
of particles
to contribute
to the potential
at a given point.
The individual
particles
component
of the density
Quctuation
is associated
with
the
random
thermal
motion of the particles and shows no collective behavior.
It represents
the
individual
particles
surrounded
by
comoving
clouds
which
screen
their
fields
within
a
distance
)L. Thus it describes
an assembly
of effec-
tively free particles interacting
only through
the short-
range part of the Coulomb
force. The screening
of the
field of a given particle is actually brought about by the
Coulomb
repulsion
which, leads to a deficiency
of elec-
trons
in the immediate
neighborhood
of the particle.
This same process also leads to a large reduction
in the
random
Quctuations
of the density
in the electron
gas
for wavelength
larger than X~.
When
we fix our attention
on a specific individual
electron in the assembly,
we may study its interaction
with the other electrons by applying
our split-up
of the
density
Quctuations
to the remainder
of the gas. The
response of the collective part of the density Quctuation
to the field of the specified particle
leads to two sig-
ni6cant
eBects: the
screening
of this particle's
6eld
within a distance
X~, and the excitation of collective
oscillations
when
the speed
of the particle
is greater
than
mean
thermal
speed. The particle
also interacts
with the individual
particles
component
of the density
Quctuations.
However,
the 6eld that is the result of this
component
may be viewed as the sum of the screened
fieIds of individual
particles.
Thus
the interaction
of
our speci6ed particle with the individual
particles com-
ponent
of the density
Quctuation
can be described
in
terms of short-range
collisions between pairs of particles.
We
have
used
the
random
phase
approximation
throughout
this paper. The use of this approximation
is
equivalent
to the neglect of the damping
and wavering-
in-frequency
of the collective oscillation
resulting
from
the individual
particles
character
of the electron
gas.
When the random
phase approximation
is justified,
the
collective component
and the individual
particles
com-
ponent
of the
density
Quctuations
will
not
be
sig-
ni6cantly
coupled,
and
thus
can
be
treated
inde-
pendently.

IN THE ELECTRON GAS
In this appendix,
we shall calculate

plitude
of Quctuation
of the Fourier components,

the density
in an electron gas. The method
used here
provides
an
alternative
approach
to
the
screening
problem,
and yields certain results that we apply in the
verification
of the random
phase approximation.
We begin with

for the probability
that the electron

in a "microscopic" state in which

Thus we can write

We now substitute
(AS) into (A4) and expand the argu-
rnent of the exponential
in a series of powers of blV/N,
retaining
only
second-order
terms. In doing
this,
we
note that since the electrons are embedded
in a uniform
distribution

the

where e is the average electron density.
We obtain the volume
element
in the space of rI, and
cpI, by regarding
the N; as continuous
variables,
and by
assuming
that
we have
chosen dN;=1
in Eq. (A6).
(A6) may therefore be multiplied
by the volume element
in N, space (dN&, dN2
dN&
), which is also unity.
The volume
element
in the space of rj, and
q~ is then
given by the Jacobian of the transformation
from the cV;
space. This is
J~[d(rl P/2) d(r122/2)
~ d(rq;2/2) ]
X[dq ~i" .dq ~,""]. (A11)
The probability 5'J is a product of separate functions,
one for each k. This indicates that in the approximations
used, the statistical
Quctuations
associated with each k
are independent.
We now calculate
the mean value of
l p~{ '= (rq)'. In
obtaining
this, we note that r ~'=r~', so that we must
replace r&' in (A10) by 2r&', but sum only over half the

For k'&)ko' we see that (rj,')A, reduces to n, the value
which wouM exist in a random distribution.
For k'Â«kg)'
we obtain
(r~')Aâ€ž=nk'Xn'.
Thus,
we see that for long
distances,
the Coulomb
forces cause the Quctuations
to
be greatly reduced.
We can now write down the mean Coulomb potential
energy
associated
with each k, noting
from Eq. (A9),
that the contributions
of diferent
k are independent.
This mean potential
is
p"~)A â€”(2s.g2p~2/ka)
= ~(KT/1+k2$~2)
(A13)
For k((ko the mean potential
energy is just xT/2. If we
recall
that
for long
wavelengths,
the
pq act almost
entirely
collectively
and
undergo
simple
harmonic
motion,
then the previous
result
can easily be under-
stood in terms of the equipartition
theorem which states
that the mean potential
energy of a harmonic
oscillator
is xT/2. For k)&kn,
(Vq)Aâ€žbecomes
2s.ne'/k'.
This is
just what
is obtained
by assuming
that the particles
move with a random distribution
in space. These results
show in another application
that for short distances, the
individual
particles point of view gives the right results
while for long distances, the organization
resulting
from
the Coulomb
forces must be taken into account.
In thermodynamic
equilibrium,
the energy is actually
distributed
partly in the collective oscillation and partly
in the random
thermal
motion
of the individual
par-
ticles. Each, of the collective
modes
will have a mean
energy of ~T, This energy is usually
very small in com-
parison
to the collective energy that would be present
if,one of the modes
were excited
systematically.
For
even
though
each particle
makes
only a small
con-
tribution
to the collective modes,
the cumulative
con-
tributions
of all the particles to a given mode may result
in energies very much greater
than aT. It also follows
that the collective coordinate
g~, is not quite equal to
zero in the state of thermodynamic
equilibrium.
But
since xT is very much less than what would be present
if a given
q& were
systematically
excited,
the state,
hz=0,
is not far from
the state
of thermodynamic
equilibrium.
Finally,
let us note that
the approximation
of re-
garding
N; as continuous
can be justified
rigorously
only for values of k appreciably
smaller than 1/a, where
a is the interparticle
spacing. Nevertheless,
it turns out
that for large values of k, this procedure
still gives what
we know to be the right value of (rq')Aâ€ž, vis , n. This.

that

(A16)
We now assume that the random
phase approximation
may be applied to this case. The use of this approxima-
tion cannot
be justified
in general,
but must be con-
sidered
separately
for each law of force. When
it is
valid Eq. (A16) may be reduced to

(A17)
The physical
significance
of the terms on the right-hand
side of (A17) is the same as for the corresponding
terms
in Eq. (9): the 6rst term represents
the contributions
from the random
thermal
motions
of individual
par-
ticles; the second term represents
the eGects of particles
interaction
and can lead to organized
behavior.
Vnder
conditions
such that the individual
particles
term can be neglected
in (A17), we have
. APPENDIX II. COLLECTIVE DESCRIPTION
OF
PARTICLE INTERACTIONS
The approach
used in Secs. II and III to study the
organization
brought
about
by
the
Coulomb
inter-
actions can be extended to a general
repulsive
particles
interaction.
In this
appendix
we indicate
briefly
the
appropriate
generalization
of the results
obtained
in
the above sections. We assume
the interparticle
poten-
'tial is V(~ x,â€”x,
~ ) and express it as a Fourier series in a
box of unit volume
with periodic boundary
conditions
as:
(A22)
where
co satisfies the following
dispersion
relation
1=P,(k'Vi/m)/[(a â€”(k v;)$',
(A23)
We may obtain an approximate
solution
for (A23) in
the limit of small (k v;/~e) which is essentially
the same
limit as that in which
the criterion
(A21) is satisfied.
The expansion
of (A23) in powers of (k v;/&o) yields
oP= (mk'Vi, /m)+ (m(v')A, /I Vi,),
(A24)
which for sufficiently
small (9"/I Vi,) reduces to the dis-
persion relation
obtained
earlier (Eq. (A19)).
It is also possible to split up the density
fluctuation
into its collective component
q~, and an individual
par-
ticles component
p&. It can easily be verified that with
the choice (A22) for qi, one obtains:
with
p~=qi+gi,
(A25)
~o'â€”(k v;)'â€”(7e'Vi,e/m)
(A26)
~e'â€”(k v;)'
The criterion
that
the
p& display
predominantly
col-
lective behavior,
and hence that a collective description
be appropriate,
is
(iik'Vq/m)Â»((k
v,)')A,.
(A20)
For
an
isotropic
velocity
distribution,
Eq.
(A20)
becomes
~VÂ»&(2/3) v,
(A21)
where
v denotes the mean particle kinetic energy. Thus
we see that a strong
interaction
and a high
particle
density
favor
organized
behavior,
while
high
random
thermal
velocities oppose it.
Just as was done for the Coulomb
interactions,
we
can find a collective coordinate
qI, which oscillates har-
monically
when random thermal motions are considered,
and thus obtain a more exact dispersion
relation
than
Eq.
(A19). The
appropriate
normalized,
collective
coordinate
is
d'pi, /dP+ (nk'V i/m) pg
0,
â€”
â€”
and the pI, carry out oscillations
of frequency,
co= (lk'Vi, /m) &.
(A18)
(A19)
It may be seen that when
the criterion
for collective
behavior
(A21) is satisfied,
the corresponding
density
Quctuation
is essentially
collective,
and
may
be de-
scribed by ql,.
