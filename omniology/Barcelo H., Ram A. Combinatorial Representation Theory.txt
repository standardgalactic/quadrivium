Introduction
In January 1997, during the special year in combinatorics at MSRI, at a
dessert party at H´el`ene’s house, Gil Kalai, in his usual fashion, began asking
very pointed questions about exactly what all the combinatorial representation
theorists were investigating. After several unsuccessful attempts at giving an-
swers that Gil would ﬁnd satisfactory, it was decided that some talks should be
given in order to explain to other combinatorialists what the specialty is about
and what its main questions are.
In the end, Arun gave two talks at MSRI in which he tried to clear up the
situation. After the talks several people suggested that it would be helpful if
someone would write a survey article containing what had been covered in the
two talks and including further interesting details. After some arm twisting it
was agreed that Arun and H´el`ene would write such a paper on combinatorial
representation theory. What follows is our attempt to deﬁne the ﬁeld of com-
binatorial representation theory, describe the main results and main questions
and give an update of its current status.
Of course this is wholly impossible. Everybody in the ﬁeld has their own
point of view and their own preferences of questions and answers. Furthermore,

COMBINATORIAL REPRESENTATION THEORY

there is much too much material in the ﬁeld to possibly collect it all in a single
article (even conceptually). We therefore feel that we must stress the obvious:
in this article we give a personal viewpoint on the ﬁeld while remaining aware
that there is much important and beautiful work that we have not been able to
mention.
On the other hand, we have tried very hard to give a focused approach and
to make something that will be useful to both specialists and non specialists,
for understanding what we do, for learning the concepts of the ﬁeld, and for
tracking down history and references. We have chosen to write in an informal
style in the hope that this way we can better convey the conceptual aspects of
the ﬁeld. Readers should keep this in mind and refer to the notes and references
and the appendices when there are questions about the precision in deﬁnitions
and statements of results. We have included a table of contents at the beginning
of the paper which should help with navigation. The survey articles [Hanlon
1984; Howe 1995; Stanley 1983] are excellent complements to this one. Having
made these points, and put in a lot of work, we leave it to you the reader, with
the earnest hope that you ﬁnd it useful.
We would like to thank the many people in residence at the special year
1996–97 in combinatorics at MSRI, for their interest, their suggestions, and for
continually encouraging us to explain and write about the things that we enjoy
doing. We both are extremely indebted to our graduate advisors, A. Garsia and
H. Wenzl, who (already many years ago) introduced us to and taught us this
wonderful ﬁeld.
PART I
1. What is Combinatorial Representation Theory?
What do we mean by “combinatorial representation theory”? First and fore-
most, combinatorial representation theory is representation theory. The adjec-
tive “combinatorial” will refer to the way in which we answer representation
theoretic questions; we will discuss this more fully later. For the moment we
begin with:
What is Representation Theory?
If representation theory is a black box, or a machine, then the input is an
algebra A. The output of the machine is information about the modules for A.
An algebra is a vector space A over C with a multiplication.
An important example: deﬁne the group algebra of a group G to be
A = CG = C-span {g ∈G},

26
H´EL`ENE BARCELO AND ARUN RAM
so that the elements of G form a basis of A. The multiplication in the group
algebra is inherited from the multiplication in the group.
We want to study the algebra A via its actions on vector spaces.
An A-module is a ﬁnite-dimensional vector space M over C with an A action.
See Appendix A1 for a complete deﬁnition. We shall use the words module and
representation interchangeably. Representation theorists are always trying to
break up modules into pieces.
An A-module M is indecomposable if M ̸∼= M1 ⊕M2 where M1 and M2 are
nonzero A-modules.
An A-module M is irreducible or simple if it has no submodules.
In reference to modules the words “irreducible” and “simple” are used completely
interchangeably.
The algebra A is semisimple if
indecomposable = irreducible
for A-modules.
The nonsemisimple case, where indecomposable is not the same as irreducible,
is called modular representation theory. We will not consider this case much in
these notes. However, before we banish it completely we describe the ﬂavor of
modular representation theory.
A composition series for M is a sequence
M = M0 ⊇M1 ⊇· · · ⊇Mk = 0
of submodules of M such that each Mi/Mi+1 is simple.
The Jordan–H¨older theorem says that two diﬀerent composition series of M will
always produce the same multiset {Mi/Mi+1} of simple modules. Modular rep-
resentation theorists are always trying to determine this multiset of composition
factors of M.
Remarks
(1) We shall not make life diﬃcult in this article but one should note that it is
common to work over general ﬁelds rather than just using the ﬁeld C.
(2) If one is bold one can relax things in the deﬁnition of module and let M be
inﬁnite-dimensional.
(3) Of course the deﬁnition of irreducible modules is not correct since 0 and M
are always submodules of M. So we are ignoring these two submodules in this
deﬁnition. But conceptually the deﬁnition is the right one, we want a simple
module to be something that has no submodules.

COMBINATORIAL REPRESENTATION THEORY

(4) The deﬁnition of semisimple above is not technically correct; see Appendix
A1 for the proper deﬁnition. However, the power of semisimplicity is exactly
that it makes all indecomposable modules irreducible. So “indecomposable =
irreducible” is really the right way to think of semisimplicity.
(5) A good reference for the basics of representation theory is [Curtis and Reiner
1962]. The book [Bourbaki 1958] contains a completely general and compre-
hensive treatment of the theory of semisimple algebras. Appendix A1 to this
article also contains a brief (and technically correct) introduction with more
speciﬁc references.
Main Questions in Representation Theory
I. What are the irreducible A-modules?
What do we mean by this question? We would like to be able to give some kind
of answer to the following more speciﬁc questions.
(a) How do we index/count them?
(b) What are their dimensions?
The dimension of a module is just its dimension as a vector space.
(c) What are their characters?
The character of a module M is the function χM : A →C, where χM(a) is
the trace of the linear transformation determined by the action of a on M.
More precisely,
χM(a) =
X
bi∈B
abi

bi,
where the sum is over a basis B of the module M and abi

bi denotes the
coeﬃcient of bi in abi when we expand in terms of the basis B.
C. How do we construct the irreducible modules?
S. Special/Interesting representations M
(a) How does M decompose into irreducibles?
If we are in the semisimple case then M will always be a direct sum of irre-
ducible modules. If we group the irreducibles of the same type together we
can write
M ∼=
M
λ
(V λ)⊕cλ,
where the modules V λ are the irreducible A-modules and cλ is the number of
times an irreducible of type V λ appears as a summand in M. It is common
to abuse notation and write
M =
X
λ
cλV λ.

28
H´EL`ENE BARCELO AND ARUN RAM
(b) What is the character of M?
Special modules often have particularly nice formulas describing their charac-
ters. It is important to note that having a nice character formula for M does
not necessarily mean that it is easy to see how M decomposes into irreducibles.
Thus this question really is diﬀerent from the previous one.
(c) How do we ﬁnd interesting representations?
Sometimes special representations turn up by themselves and other times
one has to work hard to construct the right representation with the right
properties. Often very interesting representations come from other ﬁelds.
(d) Are they useful?
A representation may be particularly interesting just because of its struc-
ture while other times it is a special representation that helps to prove some
particularly elusive theorem. Sometimes these representations lead to a com-
pletely new understanding of previously known facts.
A famous example
(which unfortunately we won’t have space to discuss; see [Humphreys 1972])
is the Verma module, which was discovered in the mid 1960s and completely
changed representation theory.
M. The modular case
In the modular case we have the following important question in addition to
those above.
(a) What are the indecomposable representations?
(b) What are the structures of their composition series?
For each indecomposable module M there is a multiset of irreducibles {Mi/Mi+1}
determined by a composition series of M.
One would like to determine this
multiset.
Even better (especially for combinatorialists), the submodules of M form a lattice
under inclusion of submodules and one would like to understand this lattice. This
lattice is always a modular lattice and we may imagine that each edge of the
Hasse diagram is labeled by the simple module N1/N2 where N1 and N2 are the
modules on the ends of the edge. With this point of view the various composition
series of M are the maximal chains in this lattice of modules. The Jordan–H¨older
theorem says that every maximal chain in the lattice of submodules of M has
the same multiset of labels on its edges. What modular representation theorists
try to do is determine the set of labels on a maximal chain.
Remark. The abuse of notation that allows us to write M = P
λ cλV λ has
been given a formal setting called the Grothendieck ring. In other words, the
formal object that allows us to write such identities has been deﬁned carefully.
See [Serre 1971] for precise deﬁnitions of the Grothendieck ring.

COMBINATORIAL REPRESENTATION THEORY
29
Answers Should Be of the Form. . .
Now we come to the adjective “Combinatorial.” It refers to the way in which
we give the answers to the main questions of representation theory.
I. What are the irreducible A-modules?
(a) How do we index/count them?
We want to answer with a bijection
nice combinatorial objects λ
1−1
←→
irreducible representations V λ.
(b) What are their dimensions?
We should answer with a formula of the form
dim(V λ) = # of nice combinatorial objects.
(c) What are their characters?
We want a character formula of the type
χ(a) =
X
T
wta(T),
where the sum runs over all T in a set of nice combinatorial objects and wta
is a weight on these objects which depends on the element a ∈A where we
are evaluating the character.
C. How do we construct the irreducible modules?
We want to give constructions that have a very explicit and very combi-
natorial ﬂavor. What we mean by this will be clearer from the examples; see
C(i), C(ii) in Section 2 (page 31).
S. Special/Interesting representations M
(a) How does M decompose into irreducibles?
If M is an interesting representation we want to determine the positive
integers cλ in the decomposition
M ∼=
M
λ
(V λ)⊕cλ
in the form
cλ = # of nice combinatorial objects.
In the formula for the decomposition of M the sum is over all λ which are
objects indexing the irreducible representations of A.

30
H´EL`ENE BARCELO AND ARUN RAM
(b) What is the character of M?
As in case I(c), we want a character formula of the type
χM(a) =
X
T
wta(T),
where the sum runs over all T in some set of nice combinatorial objects and
wta is a weight on these objects which depends on the element a ∈A where
we are evaluating the character.
(c) How do we ﬁnd interesting representations?
It is particularly pleasing when interesting representations arise in other
parts of combinatorics! One such example is a representation on the ho-
mology of the partition lattice, which also, miraculously, appears as a repre-
sentation on the free Lie algebra. We won’t have space to discuss this here,
see the original references [Hanlon 1981; Joyal 1986; Klyachko 1974; Stanley
1982], the article [Garsia 1990] for some further basics, and [Barcelo 1990] for
a study of how it can be that this representation appears in two completely
diﬀerent places. Another fascinating example can be found in Sundaram’s
work [1994].
In this paper she study the homology representations of the
symmetric group on Cohen–Macaulay subposets of the partition lattice. The
coeﬃcients discussed in (S2) of Section 2 (page 32) also appear in her work.
(d) Are they useful?
Are they useful for solving combinatorial problems? How about for mak-
ing new ones? Sometimes a representation is exactly what is most helpful
for solving a combinatorial problem. One example of this is in the recent solu-
tion of the last few plane partition conjectures. See [Stanley 1971; Macdonald
1995, Chap. I, § 5, Ex. 13–18] for the statement of the problem and [Kuper-
berg 1994c; 1994b; 1996a; Stembridge 1994a; 1994b; 1995] for the solutions.
These solutions were motivated by the method of Proctor [1984].
The main point of all this is that a combinatorialist thinks in a special way (nice
objects, bijections, weighted objects, etc.) and this method of thinking should
be an integral part of the form of the solution to the problem.
2. Answers for Sn, the Symmetric Group
Most people in the ﬁeld of combinatorial representation theory agree that the
ﬁeld begins with the fundamental results for the symmetric group Sn. We give
the answers to the main questions for the case of Sn. The precise deﬁnitions
of all the objects used below can be found in Appendix A2. As always, by a
representation of the symmetric group we mean a representation of its group
algebra A = CSn.
I. What are the irreducible Sn-modules?

COMBINATORIAL REPRESENTATION THEORY
31
(a) How do we index/count them?
There is a bijection
partitions λ of n
1−1
←→
irreducible representations Sλ.
(b) What are their dimensions?
The dimension of the irreducible representation Sλ is
dim(Sλ) = # of standard tableaux of shape λ =
n!
Q
x∈λ hx
,
where hx is the hook length at the box x in λ (see Appendix A2).
(c) What are their characters?
Let χλ(µ) be the character of the irreducible representation Sλ evaluated at
a permutation of cycle type µ = (µ1, µ2, . . ., µl). Then the character χλ(µ)
is given by
χλ(µ) =
X
T
wtµ(T),
where the sum is over all standard tableaux T of shape λ and
wtµ(T) =
n
Y
i=1
f(i, T),
with
f(i, T) =



−1
if i ̸∈B(µ) and i + 1 is SW of i,
0
if i, i+1 ̸∈B(µ), i+1 is NE of i, and i+2 is SW of i+1,
1,
otherwise,
and B(µ) = {µ1 + µ2 + · · · + µk | 1 ≤k ≤l}. In the formula for f(i, T),
SW means strictly south and weakly west and NE means strictly north and
weakly east.
C. How do we construct the irreducible modules?
There are several interesting constructions of the irreducible Sλ.
(i) Via Young symmetrizers. Let T be a tableau. Set
R(T) = permutations that ﬁx the rows of T, as sets;
C(T) = permutations that ﬁx the columns of T, as sets;
P (T) =
X
w∈R(T)
w,
and
N(T) =
X
w∈C(T)
ε(w)w,
where ε(w) is the sign of the permutation w. Then
Sλ ∼= CSnP (T)N(T),
where the action of the symmetric group is by left multiplication.

32
H´EL`ENE BARCELO AND ARUN RAM
(ii) Young’s seminormal construction. Let
Sλ = C-span-{vT | T is a standard tableau of shape λ},
so that the vectors vT are a basis of Sλ. The action of Sn on Sλ is given by
sivT = (si)TT vT + (1 + (si)TT )vsiT ,
where si is the transposition (i, i+1) and
(si)TT =
1
c(T(i + 1)) −c(T(i)),
with the following notation:
T(i) denotes the box containing i in T;
c(b) is the content of the box b, that is, j −i if b has position (i, j) in λ;
siT is the same as T except that the entries i and i+1 are switched;
vsiT = 0 if siT is not a standard tableau.
There are other important constructions of the irreducible representations Sλ.
We do not have room to discuss these constructions here, see Remarks (10)–(12)
on page 34 and Appendix A3. The main ones are:
(iii) Young’s orthonormal construction,
(iv) the Kazhdan–Lusztig construction, and
(v) the Springer construction.
S. Particularly interesting representations
(S1) Let k + l = n. The module SλySn
Sk×Sl is the same as Sλ except that we
only look at the action of the subgroup Sk × Sl. Then
SλySn
Sk×Sl =
M
µ⊢k,ν⊢l
(Sµ ⊗Sν)⊕cλ
µν =
X
µ,ν
cλ
µν(Sµ ⊗Sν),
where µ ⊢k means that µ is a partition of k, as usual, and the positive integers
cλ
µν are the Littlewood–Richardson coeﬃcients: cλ
µν is the number of
column strict ﬁllings of λ/µ of content ν such that the word of the ﬁlling is a
lattice permutation. See Appendix A2.
(S2) Let µ = (µ1, . . ., µl) be a partition of n. Let Sµ = Sµ1 × · · · × Sµl. The
module 1
xSn
Sµ is the vector space
1
xSn
Sµ = C(Sn/Sµ) = C-span{wSµ | w ∈Sn}
where the action of Sn on the cosets is by left multiplication. Then
1
xSn
Sµ =
X
λ
KλµSλ,

COMBINATORIAL REPRESENTATION THEORY
33
where
Kλµ = # of column strict tableaux of shape λ and weight µ.
This representation also occurs in the following context:
1
xSn
Sµ ∼= H∗(Bu),
where u is a unipotent element of GL(n, C) with Jordan decomposition µ and
Bu is the variety of Borel sugroups in GL(n, C) containing u. This represen-
tation is related to the Springer construction mentioned as item C(v) on the
preceding page. See Appendix A3 for further details.
(S3) If µ, ν ⊢n, the tensor product Sn-module Sµ⊗Sν is deﬁned by w(m⊗n) =
wm ⊗wn, for all w ∈Sn, m ∈Sµ and n ∈Sν. There are positive integers
γµνλ such that
Sµ ⊗Sν =
X
λ⊢n
γµνλSλ.
Except for a few special cases the γµνλ are still unknown. See [Remmel 1992]
for a combinatorial description of the cases for which the coeﬃcients γµνλ are
known.
Remarks
(1) The bijection in (Ia), page 31, between irreducible representations and par-
titions, is due to Frobenius [1900]. Frobenius is the founder of representation
theory and the symmetric group was one of the ﬁrst examples that he worked
out.
(2) The formula in (Ib), page 31, for the dimension of Sλ as the number of
standard tableaux is immediate from the work of Frobenius, but it really came
into the fore with the work of Young [1901; 1902; 1928; 1930a; 1930b; 1931;
1934a; 1934b]. The “hook formula” for dim(Sλ) is due to Frame, Robinson,
and Thrall [Frame et al. 1954].
(3) The formula for the characters of the symmetric group given in (Ic), page 31,
is due to Fomin and Greene [1998]. For them, this formula arose by application
of their theory of noncommutative symmetric functions.
Roichman [1997]
discovered this formula independently in the more general case of the Iwahori–
Hecke algebra. The formula for the Iwahori–Hecke algebra is exactly the same
as the one for the Sn case except that the 1 appearing in case 3 of the deﬁnition
of f(i, T) should be changed to a q.
(4) There is a diﬀerent and more classical formula for the characters than the
one given in (Ic), called the Murnaghan–Nakayama rule [Murnaghan 1937;
Nakayama 1941]. We describe it in Theorem A2.2 (page 57). Once the formula
in (Ic) is given it is not hard to show combinatorially that it is equivalent to
the Murnaghan–Nakayama rule, but if one does not know the formula it is
nontrivial to guess it from the Murnaghan–Nakayama rule.

34
H´EL`ENE BARCELO AND ARUN RAM
(5) We do not know if anyone has compared the algorithmic complexity of the
formula given in (Ic) with that of the Murnaghan–Nakayama rule. One would
expect that they have the same complexity: the formula above is a sum
over more objects than the sum in the Murnaghan–Nakayama rule but these
objects are easier to create and many of them have zero weight.
(6) One of the beautiful things about the formula for the character of Sλ given
in (Ic) is that it is a sum over the same set that we have used to describe the
dimension of Sλ.
(7) The construction of Sλ by Young symmetrizers is due to Young [1901; 1902].
It is used so often and has so many applications that it is considered classical.
A review and generalization of this construction to skew shapes appears in
[Garsia and Wachs 1989].
(8) The seminormal form construction of Sλ is also due to Young [1931; 1934b],
although it was discovered some thirty years after the Young symmetrizer
construction.
(9) Young’s orthonormal construction diﬀers from the seminormal construction
only by multiplication of the basis vectors by certain constants. A compre-
hensive treatment of all three constructions of Young is given in [Rutherford
1948].
(10) The Kazhdan–Lusztig construction uses the Iwahori–Hecke algebra in a
crucial way. It is combinatorial but relies crucially on certain polynomials
which seem to be impossible to compute in practice except for very small n;
see [Brenti 1994] for further information. This construction has important
connections to geometry and other parts of representation theory. The paper
[Garsia and McLarnan 1988] and the book [Humphreys 1990] give elementary
treatments of the Kazhdan–Lusztig construction.
(11) Springer’s construction is a geometric construction. In this construction the
irreducible module Sλ is realized as the top cohomology group of a certain
variety; see [Springer 1978; Chriss and Ginzburg 1997], and Appendix A3.
(12) There are many ways of constructing new representations from old ones.
Among the common techniques are restriction, induction, and tensoring. The
special representations (S1), (S2), and (S3) given on pages 32–33 are partic-
ularly nice examples of these constructions. One should note that tensoring
of representations works for group algebras (and Hopf algebras) but not for
general algebras.
3. Answers for GL(n, C), the General Linear Group
The results for the general linear group are just as beautiful and just as
fundamental as those for the symmetric group.
The results are surprisingly
similar and yet diﬀerent in many crucial ways. We shall see that the results
for GL(n, C) have been generalized to a very wide class of groups whereas the
results for Sn have only been generalized successfully to groups that look very

35
similar to symmetric groups. The representation theory of GL(n, C) was put on
a very ﬁrm footing from the fundamental work of Schur [1901; 1927].
I. What are the irreducible GL(n, C)-modules?
(a) How do we index/count them?
There is a bijection
partitions λ with at most n rows
1−1
←→
irreducible polynomial representations V λ.
See Appendix A4 for a deﬁnition and discussion of what it means to be a
polynomial representation.
(b) What are their dimensions?
The dimension of the irreducible representation V λ is
dim(V λ) = # of column strict tableaux of shape λ
ﬁlled with entries from {1, 2, . . ., n}
=
Y
x∈λ
n + c(x)
hx
,
where c(x) is the content of the box x and hx is the hook length at the box x.
(c) What are their characters?
Let χλ(g) be the character of the irreducible representation V λ evaluated at
an element g ∈GL(n, C). The character χλ(g) is given by
χλ(g) =
X
T
xT
=
P
w∈Sn ε(w)wxλ+δ
P
w∈Sn ε(w)wxδ
= det(xλj+n−j
i
)
det(xn−j
i
)
,
where the sum is over all column strict tableaux T of shape λ ﬁlled with
entries from {1, 2, . . ., n} and
xT = xµ1
1 xµ2
2 · · ·xµn
n ,
where µi is the number of i’s in T and x1, x2, . . ., xn are the eigenvalues of
the matrix g. (Let us not worry at the moment about the quotient of sums on
the second line of the display above. It is routine to rewrite it as the second
expression on that line, which is one of the standard expressions for the Schur
function; see [Macdonald 1995, Chap. I, § 3].)
C. How do we construct the irreducible modules?
There are several interesting constructions of the irreducible V λ.

36

(C1) Via Young symmetrizers. Recall that the irreducible Sλ of the sym-
metric group Sk was constructed via Young symmetrizers in the form
Sλ ∼= CSnP (T)N(T).
We can construct the irreducible GL(n, C)-module in a similar form. If λ is
a partition of k then
V λ ∼= V ⊗kP (T)N(T).
This important construction is detailed in Appendix A5.
(C2) Gelfand–Tsetlin bases. This construction of the irreducible GL(n, C)

(C3) The Borel–Weil–Bott construction. Let λ be a partition of n. Then
λ deﬁnes a character (one-dimensional representation) of the group Tn of
diagonal matrices in G = GL(n, C). This character can be extended to the
group B = Bn of upper triangular matrices in G = GL(n, C) by letting it act
trivially on Un the group of upper unitriangular matrices in G = GL(n, C).
Then the ﬁber product
Lλ = G ×B λ
is a line bundle on G/B. Finally,
V λ ∼= H0(G/B, Lλ),

where H0(G/B, Lλ) is the space of global sections of the line bundle Lλ.
More details on the construction of the character λ and the line bundle Lλ
are given in Appendix A6.

where the cλ

write this expansion in the form
V λyGL(n)
GL(k)×GL(l) =

V µ(F) ⊗V ν(F).
We could do this precisely if we wanted. We won’t do it now, but the point
is that it may be nice to write this expansion as a sum over combinatorial
objects. This will be the form in which this will be generalized later.
(S2) Let V µ and V ν be irreducible polynomial representations of GL(n). Then

where GL(n) acts on V µ ⊗V ν by g(m ⊗n) = gm ⊗gn, for g ∈GL(n, C),
m ∈V µ and n ∈V ν. Amazingly, the coeﬃcients cλ
µν are the Littlewood–
Richardson coeﬃcients again, the same that appeared in the (S1) case
immediately above and in the (S1) case for the symmetric group (page 32).
Remarks
(1) There is a strong similarity between the results for the symmetric group and
the results for GL(n, C). One might wonder whether there is any connection
between these two pictures.
There are two distinct ways of making concrete connections between the
representation theories of GL(n, C) and the symmetric group. In fact these
two are so diﬀerent that diﬀerent symmetric groups are involved.
(a) If λ is a partition of n then the “zero weight space”, or (1, 1, . . ., 1) weight
space, of the irreducible GL(n, C)-module V λ is isomorphic to the irre-
ducible module Sλ for the group Sn, where the action of Sn is determined

COMBINATORIAL REPRESENTATION THEORY
39
by the fact that Sn is the subgroup of permutation matrices in GL(n, C).
This relationship is reﬂected in the combinatorics: the standard tableaux
of shape λ are exactly the column strict tableaux of shape λ which are of
weight ν = (1, 1, . . ., 1).
(b) Schur–Weyl duality (see Appendix A5) says that the action of the sym-
metric group Sk on V ⊗k by permutation of the tensor factors generates the
full centralizer of the GL(n, C)-action on V ⊗k where V is the standard n-
dimensional representation of GL(n, C). By double centralizer theory, this
duality induces a correspondence between the irreducible representations of
GL(n, C) which appear in V ⊗k and the irreducible representations of Sk
which appear in V ⊗k. These representations are indexed by partitions λ
of k.
(2) Note that the word character has two diﬀerent and commonly used mean-
ings and the use of the word character in (C3) (page 37) is diﬀerent from
that in Section 1. In (C3) above the word character means one-dimensional
representation. This terminology is used particularly (but not exclusively) in
reference to representations of abelian groups, like the group Tn in (C3). In
general one has to infer from the context which meaning is intended.
(3) The indexing and the formula for the characters of the irreducible represen-
tations is due to Schur [1901].
(4) The formula for the dimensions of the irreducibles as the number of column
strict tableaux follows from the work of Kostka [1882] and Schur [1901]. The
“hook-content” formula appears in [Macdonald 1995, Chap. I, § 3, Ex. 4],
where the book [Littlewood 1940] is quoted.
(5) The construction of the irreducibles by Young symmetrizers appeared in
1939 in the inﬂuential book [Weyl 1946]. It was generalized to the symplectic
and orthogonal groups by H. Weyl in the same book.
Further important
information about this construction in the symplectic and orthogonal cases is
found in [Berele 1986a] and [King and Welsh 1993]. It is not known how to
generalize this construction to arbitrary complex semisimple Lie groups.
(6) The Gelfand–Tsetlin basis construction originates in [Gel’fand and Tsetlin
1950a].
A similar construction was given for the orthogonal group at the
same time [Gel’fand and Tsetlin 1950b] and was generalized to the symplectic
group by Zhelobenko [1987; 1970].
This construction does not generalize
well to other complex semisimple groups since it depends crucially on a tower
G ⊇G1 ⊇· · · ⊇Gk ⊇{1} of “nice” Lie groups such that all the combinatorics
is controllable.
(7) The Borel–Weil–Bott construction is not a combinatorial construction of the
irreducible module V λ. It is very important because it is a construction that
generalizes well to all other compact connected real Lie groups.
(8) The facts about the special representations which we have given above are
found in [Littlewood 1940].

4. Answers for Finite-Dimensional Complex Semisimple Lie
Algebras g
Although the foundations for generalizing the GL(n, C) results to all com-
plex semisimple Lie groups and Lie algebras were laid in the fundamental work
of Weyl [1925; 1926], it was only recently that a complete generalization of the
tableaux results for GL(n, C) was obtained [Littelmann 1995]. The results which
we state below are generalizations of those given for GL(n, C) in the last sec-
tion; partitions get replaced by points in a lattice called P +, and column strict
tableaux get replaced by paths. See Appendix A7 for some basics on complex
semisimple Lie algebras.
I. What are the irreducible g-modules?
(a) How do we index/count them?
There is a bijection
λ ∈P +
1−1
←→
irreducible representations V λ,
where P + is the cone of dominant integral weights for g (see Appendix A8).
(b) What are their dimensions?
The dimension of the irreducible representation V λ is
dim(V λ) = # of paths in Pπλ =
Y
α>0
⟨λ+ρ, α⟩
⟨ρ, α⟩
,
where
ρ = 1
2
P
α>0 α is the half sum of the positive roots,
πλ is the straight line path from 0 to λ, and
Pπλ = {fi1 · · · fikπλ|1 ≤i1, . . ., ik ≤n}, where f1, . . ., fn are the path
operators introduced in [Littelmann 1995].
We shall not deﬁne the operators fi; we will just say that they act on paths
and are partial permutations in the sense that if fi acts on a path π then the
result is either 0 or another path. See Appendix A8 (page 65) for a few more
details.
(c) What are their characters?
The character of the irreducible module V λ is
char(V λ) =
X
η∈Pπλ
eη(1) =
P
w∈W ε(w)ew(λ+ρ)
P
w∈W ε(w)ewρ
,
where η(1) is the endpoint of the path η. These expressions live in the group
algebra of the weight lattice P , C[P ] = span{eµ | µ ∈P }, where eµ is a
formal variable indexed by µ and the multiplication is given by eµeν = eµ+ν,
for µ, ν ∈P . See Appendix A7 for more details.

S. Special/Interesting representations
(S1) Let l ⊆g be a Levi subalgebra of g (this is a Lie algebra corresponding
to a subgraph of the Dynkin diagram associated with g).
The subalgebra
l corresponds to a subset J of the set {α1, . . ., αn} of simple roots.
The
restriction rule from g to l is
V λyg
l =
X
η
V η(1),
where
the sum is over all paths η ∈Pπλ such that η ∈Cl, and
η ∈Cl means that ⟨η(t), αi⟩≥0, for all t ∈[0, 1] and all αi ∈J.
(S2) The tensor product of two irreducible modules is given by
V µ ⊗V ν =
X
η
V µ+η(1),
where the sum is over all paths η ∈Pπν such that πµ ∗η ∈C,
πµ and πν are straight line paths from 0 to µ and 0 to ν, respectively,
Pπν is as in (Ib) on page 40,
πµ ∗η is the path obtained by attaching η to the end of πµ, and
(πµ ∗η) ∈C means that ⟨(πµ ∗η)(t), αi⟩≥0, for all t ∈[0, 1] and all simple
roots αi.
Remarks
(1) The indexing of irreducible representations given in (Ia), page 40, is due to
Cartan and Killing, the founders of the theory, from around the turn of the
century. Introductory treatments of this result can be found in [Fulton and
Harris 1991; Humphreys 1972].
(2) The ﬁrst equality in (Ib), page 40, is due to Littelmann [1994], but his later
article [1995] has some improvements and can be read independently, so we
recommend the later article. This formula for the dimension of the irreducible
representation, the number of paths in a certain set, is exactly analogous to the
formula in the GL(n, C) case, the number of tableaux which satisfy a certain
condition.
The second equality is the Weyl dimension formula, originally
proved in [Weyl 1925; 1926]. It can be proved easily from the Weyl character
formula given in (Ic) on page 40; see [Humphreys 1972; Stembridge 1994a,
Lemma 2.5].
This product formula is an analogue of the “hook-content”
formula given in the GL(n, C) case.
(3) A priori, it might be possible that the set Pπλ is an inﬁnite set, at least
the way that we have deﬁned it. In fact, this set is always ﬁnite and there
is a description of the paths that are contained in it. The paths in this set
are called Lakshmibai–Seshadri paths; see [Littelmann 1995].
The explicit

42
H´EL`ENE BARCELO AND ARUN RAM
description of these paths is a generalization of the types of indexings that
were used in the “standard monomial theory” of Lakshmibai and Seshadri
[1991].
(4) The ﬁrst equality in (Ic) is due to Littelmann [1995].
This formula, a
weighted sum over paths, is an analogue of the formula for the irreducible
character of GL(n, C) as a weighted sum of column strict tableaux.
The
second equality in (Ic) is the celebrated Weyl character formula, originally
proved in [Weyl 1925; 1926]. Modern treatments can be found in [Br¨ocker
and tom Dieck 1985; Humphreys 1972; Varadarajan 1984].
(5) The general restriction formula (S1) on the preceding page is due to Littel-
mann [1995]. This is an analogue of the rule given in (S1) of the GL(n, C)
results, page 38. In this case the formula is as a sum over paths which satisfy
certain conditions whereas in the GL(n, C) case the formula is a sum over
column strict ﬁllings which satisfy a certain condition.
(6) The general tensor product formula in (S2) on the preceding page is due to
Littelmann [1995]. This formula is an analogue of the formula given in (S2)
of the GL(n, C) results, page 38.
(7) The results of Littelmann given above are some of the most exciting results
of combinatorial representation theory in recent years. They were very much
inspired by some very explicit conjectures of Lakshmibai that arose out of the
“standard monomial theory” developed by Lakshmibai and Seshadri [1991].
Although Littelmann’s theory is actually much more general than we have
stated above, the special set of paths Pπλ used in (Ib) and (Ic) is a modiﬁed
description of the same set which appeared in Lakshmibai’s conjecture. An-
other important inﬂuence on Littelmann in his work was Kashiwara’s work
[1990] on crystal bases.
PART II
5. Generalizing the Sn Results
Having the above results for the symmetric group in hand we would like to
try to generalize as many of the Sn results as we can to other similar groups and
algebras. Work along this line began almost immediately after the discovery of
the Sn results and it continues today. In the current state of results this has
been largely
1. successful for the complex reﬂection groups G(r, p, n) and their “Hecke al-
gebras”,
2. successful for tensor power centralizer algebras and their q-analogues, and
3. unsuccessful for general Weyl groups and ﬁnite Coxeter groups.
Some partial results giving answers to the main questions for the complex reﬂec-
tion groups G(r, p, n), their “Hecke algebras”, and some tensor power centralizer

COMBINATORIAL REPRESENTATION THEORY
43
algebras can be found in Appendices B1–B8. Here we limit ourselves to a brief
description of these objects and some notes and references.
5.1. The Reﬂection Groups G(r, p, n)
A ﬁnite Coxeter group is a ﬁnite group generated by reﬂections in Rn. In
other words, take a bunch of linear transformations of Rn which are reﬂections
(in the sense of reﬂections and rotations in the orthogonal group) and see what
group they generate.
If the group is ﬁnite then it is a ﬁnite Coxeter group.
Actually, this deﬁnition of ﬁnite Coxeter group is not the usual one (which is
given in Appendix B1), but since we have the following theorem we are not too
far astray.
Theorem 5.1. A group is a ﬁnite group generated by reﬂections if and only if
it is a ﬁnite Coxeter group.
The ﬁnite Coxeter groups have been classiﬁed completely and there is one group
of each of the following “types”
An, Bn, Dn, E6, E7, E8, F4, H3, H4, or I2(m).
The ﬁnite crystallographic reﬂection groups are called Weyl groups because of
their connection with Lie theory. These are the ﬁnite Coxeter groups of types
An, Bn, Dn, E6, E7, E8, F4, and G2 = I2(6).
A complex reﬂection group is a group generated by complex reﬂections, that
is, invertible linear transformations of Cn which have ﬁnite order and which
have exactly one eigenvalue that is not 1. Every ﬁnite Coxeter group is also a
ﬁnite complex reﬂection group. The ﬁnite complex reﬂection groups have been
classiﬁed by Shephard and Todd [1954] and each such group is one of the groups
(a) G(r, p, n), where r, p, n are positive integers such that p divides r, or
(b) one of 34 “exceptional” ﬁnite complex reﬂection groups.
The groups G(r, p, n) are very similar to the symmetric group Sn in many ways
and this is probably why generalizing the Sn theory has been so successful for
these groups. The symmetric groups and the ﬁnite Coxeter groups of types Bn,
and Dn are all special cases of the groups G(r, p, n).
I. What are the irreducible modules?
The indexing, dimension formulas and character formulas for the representations
of the groups G(r, p, n) are originally due to
– Young [1901] for ﬁnite Coxeter groups of types Bn and Dn;
– Specht [1932] for the group G(r, 1, n).
We do not know who ﬁrst did the general G(r, p, n) case but it is easy to generalize
Young and Specht’s results to this case. See [Ariki 1995; Halverson and Ram
1998] for recent accounts.

44
H´EL`ENE BARCELO AND ARUN RAM
Essentially what one does to determine the indexing, dimensions and the char-
acters of the irreducible modules is to use Cliﬀord theory to reduce the G(r, 1, n)
case to the case of the symmetric group Sn. Then one can use Cliﬀord theory
again to reduce the G(r, p, n) case to the G(r, 1, n) case. The original reference
for Cliﬀord theory is [Cliﬀord 1937]; the book by Curtis and Reiner [1981; 1987]
has a modern treatment. The articles [Stembridge 1989b; Halverson and Ram
1998] explain how the reduction from G(r, p, n) to G(r, 1, n) is done. The di-
mension and character theory for the case G(r, 1, n) has an excellent modern
treatment in [Macdonald 1995, Chap. I, App. B].
C. How do we construct the irreducible modules?
The construction of the irreducible representations by Young symmetrizers was
extended to the ﬁnite Coxeter groups of types Bn and Dn by Young himself
[1930b]. The authors don’t know when the general case was ﬁrst treated in the
literature, but it is not diﬃcult to extend Young’s results to the general case
G(r, p, n).
The G(r, p, n) case does appear periodically in the literature, see
[Allen 1997], for example.
Young’s seminormal construction was generalized to the “Hecke algebras” of
G(r, p, n) in [Ariki and Koike 1994; Ariki 1995]. One can easily set q = 1 in
the constructions of Ariki and Koike and obtain the appropriate analogues for
the groups G(r, p, n). We do not know if the analogue of Young’s seminormal
construction for the groups G(r, p, n) appeared in the literature previous to the
work of Ariki and Koike on the “Hecke algebra” case.
S. Special/Interesting representations
We do not know if the analogues of the Sn results, (S1)–(S3) of Section 2
(page 32), have explicitly appeared in the literature. It is easy to use symmetric
functions and the character formulas of Specht (see [Macdonald 1995, Chap. I,
App. B]) to derive formulas for the G(r, 1, n) case in terms of the symmetric
group results. Then one proceeds as described above to compute the necessary
formulas for G(r, p, n) in terms of the G(r, 1, n) results. See [Stembridge 1989b]
for how this is done.
5.2. The “Hecke algebras” of reﬂection groups
In group theory, a Hecke algebra is a speciﬁc kind of double coset algebra asso-
ciated with a ﬁnite group G and a subgroup B of G; see Appendix B3 for the
deﬁnition. In connection with ﬁnite Coxeter groups and the groups G(r, p, n)
certain algebras can be deﬁned that are analogous in some sense to Hecke alge-
bras.
The Iwahori–Hecke algebra of a ﬁnite Coxeter group W is a certain algebra
that is a q-analogue, or q-deformation, of the group algebra W. (See Appendix
B3 for a proper deﬁnition.) It has a basis Tw, for w ∈W (so it is the same
dimension as the group algebra of W), but multiplication depends on a particular

COMBINATORIAL REPRESENTATION THEORY
45
number q ∈C, which can be chosen arbitrarily. These algebras are true Hecke
algebras only when W is a ﬁnite Weyl group.
The “Hecke algebras” of the groups G(r, p, n) are q-analogues of the group
algebras of the groups G(r, p, n); see Appendix B4 for a discusson of how they
are deﬁned. They were deﬁned only recently, as follows:
– Ariki and Koike [1994] for the case G(r, 1, n);
– Brou´e and Malle [1993] and Ariki [1995] for the general case.
It is important to note that these algebras are not true Hecke algebras. In group
theory a Hecke algebra is very speciﬁc kind of double coset algebra and the
“Hecke algebras” of the groups G(r, p, n) do not ﬁt this mold.
Appendix B4 gives some partial answers to the main questions for these alge-
bras; here we give references to the literature for these answers.
I. What are the irreducibles?
Results of [Ariki and Koike 1994; Ariki 1995] say that the “Hecke algebras”
of G(r, p, n) are q-deformations of the group algebras of the groups G(r, p, n).
Thus, it follows from the Tits deformation theorem [Carter 1985, Chap. 10,
11.2; Curtis and Reiner 1987, § 68.17] that the indexings and dimension formulas
for the irreducible representations of these algebras must be the same as the
indexings and dimension formulas for the groups G(r, p, n). Finding analogues
of the character formulas requires a bit more work and a Murnaghan–Nakayama
type rule for the “Hecke algebras” of G(r, p, n) was given by Halverson and Ram
[1998]. As far as we know, the formula for the irreducible characters of Sn as a
weighted sum of standard tableaux which we gave in the symmetric group section
has not yet been generalized to the case of G(r, p, n) and its “Hecke algebras”.
C. How do we construct the irreducible modules?
Analogues of Young’s seminormal representations have been given by
– Hoefsmit [1974] and Wenzl [1988a], independently, for Iwahori–Hecke algebras
of type An−1;
– Hoefsmit [1974], for Iwahori–Hecke algebras of types Bn and Dn;
– Ariki and Koike [1994] for the “Hecke algebras” of G(r, 1, n);
– Ariki [1995] for the general “Hecke algebras” of G(r, p, n).
There seems to be more than one appropriate choice for the analogue of Young
symmetrizers for Hecke algebras. The deﬁnitions in the literature are due to
– Gyoja [1986], for the Iwahori–Hecke algebras of type An−1;
– Dipper and James [1986] and Murphy [1992; 1995] for the Iwahori–Hecke
algebras of type An−1;
– King and Wybourne [1992] and Duchamp et al. [1995] for the Iwahori–Hecke
algebras of type An−1;

46
H´EL`ENE BARCELO AND ARUN RAM
– Dipper, James, and Murphy [1992; 1995] for the Iwahori–Hecke algebras of
type Bn;
– Pallikaros [1994], for the Iwahori–Hecke algebras of type Dn;
– Mathas [1997] and Murphy [≥1999], for the “Hecke algebras” of G(r, p, n).
The paper [Graham and Lehrer 1996] also contains important ideas in this di-
rection.
S. Special/Interesting representations
It follows from the Tits deformation theorem (or rather, an extension of it) that
the results for the “Hecke algebras” of G(r, p, n) must be the same as for the
case of the groups G(r, p, n).
5.3. Tensor Power Centralizer Algebras
A tensor power centralizer algebra is an algebra that is isomorphic to
EndG(V ⊗k) for some group (or Hopf algebra) G and some representation V
of G. In this deﬁnition
EndG(V ⊗k) = {T ∈End(V ⊗k) | Tgv = gTv, for all g ∈G and all v ∈V ⊗k}.
Some examples of tensor power centralizer algebras have been particularly im-
portant:
(a) The group algebras, CSk, of the symmetric groups Sk.
(b) Iwahori–Hecke algebras, Hk(q), of type Ak−1 were introduced by Iwa-
hori [1964] in connection with GL(n, Fq). Jimbo [1986] realized that they arise
as tensor power centralizer algebras for quantum groups.
(c) Temperley–Lieb algebras, TLk(x), were introduced independently by
several people. Some of the discoverers were Rumer, Teller, and Weyl [Rumer
et al. 1932], Penrose [1969; 1971], Temperley and Lieb [1971], Kaufmann
[1987] and Jones [1983]. The work of V. Jones was crucial in making them so
important in combinatorial representation theory today.
(d) Brauer algebras, Bk(x), were deﬁned in [Brauer 1937]. Brauer also proved
that they are tensor power centralizers.
(e) Birman–Murakami–Wenzl algebras, BMWk(r, q), are due to Birman
and Wenzl [1989] and Murakami [1987]. It was realized early on [Reshetikhin
1987; Wenzl 1990] that they arise as tensor power centralizers but there was
no proof in the literature for some time. See the references in [Chari and
Pressley 1994, § 10.2].
(f) Spider algebras were written down combinatorially and studied by G. Ku-
perberg [1994a; 1996b].
(g) Rook monoid algebras are the “group algebras” of some very natural
monoids, and L. Solomon (unpublished work) realized these as tensor power
centralizers. Their combinatorics has also been studied in [Garsia and Remmel
1986].

(h) Solomon–Iwahori algebras were introduced in [Solomon 1990]. The fact
that they are tensor power centralizer algebras is an unpublished result of
Solomon [1995].
(i) Rational Brauer algebras were introduced in a nice combinatorial form
in [Benkart et al. 1994] and in other forms in [Koike 1989; Procesi 1976] and
other older invariant theory works [Weyl 1946]. All of these works were related
to tensor power centralizers and/or fundamental theorems of invariant theory.
(j) The q-rational Brauer algebras were introduced by Kosuda and Murakami
[1992; 1993] and subsequently studied in [Leduc 1994; Halverson 1996; 1995].
(k) partition algebras were introduced by V. Jones [1994] and have been stud-
ied subsequently by P. Martin [1996].
The following paragraphs give references on the results associated with objects
(b)–(e); see also Appendices B5 to B8 for the results themselves and missing
deﬁnitions. We will not discuss objects (f)–(k) further; see the references given
in the individual entries above.
I. What are the irreducibles?
Indexing of the representations of tensor power centralizer algebras follows
from double centralizer theory [Weyl 1946] and a good understanding of the
indexings and tensor product rules for the group or algebra that it is centraliz-
ing: GL(n, C), O(n, C), Uqsl(n), etc. The references for resulting indexings and
dimension formulas for the irreducible representations are as follows:
Temperley–Lieb algebras. These results are classical and can be found in [Good-
man et al. 1989].
Brauer algebras. These results were known to Brauer [1937] and Weyl [1946].
An important combinatorial point of view was given by Berele [1986b; 1986a]
and further developed by Sundaram [1990c; 1990b; 1990a].
Iwahori–Hecke algebras of type An−1. These results follow from the Tits defor-
mation theorem and the corresponding results for the symmetric group.
Birman–Murakami–Wenzl algebras. These results follow from the Tits deforma-
tion theorem and the corresponding results for the Brauer algebra.
The indexings and dimension formulas for the Temperley–Lieb and Brauer al-
gebras also follow easily by using the techniques of the Jones basic construction
[Wenzl 1988b; Halverson and Ram 1995].
The references for the irreducible characters of the various tensor power central-
izer algebras are as follows:
Temperley–Lieb algebras.
Character formulas can be derived easily by using
Jones Basic Construction techniques [Halverson and Ram 1995].
Iwahori–Hecke algebras of type An−1. The analogue of the formula for the irre-
ducible characters of Sn as a weighted sum of standard tableaux was found by

48
H´EL`ENE BARCELO AND ARUN RAM
Roichman [1997]. Murnaghan–Nakayama type formulas were found by several
authors [King and Wybourne 1992; Van der Jeugt 1991; Vershik and Kerov 1988;
Ueno and Shibukawa 1992; Ram 1991].
Brauer algebras and Birman–Murakami–Wenzl algebras. Murnaghan–Nakayama
type formulas were derived in [Ram 1995] and [Halverson and Ram 1995], re-
spectively.
Brauer algebra and Birman–Murakami–Wenzl algebra analogues of the formula
for the irreducible characters of the symmetric groups as a weighted sum of
standard tableaux have not appeared in the literature.
C. How do we construct the irreducibles?
Temperley–Lieb algebras. An application of the Jones Basic Construction [Wenzl
1988b; Halverson and Ram 1995] gives a construction of the irreducible repre-
sentations of the Temperley–Lieb algebras. This construction is classical and
has been rediscovered by many people. In this case the construction is an ana-
logue of the Young symmetrizer construction. The analogue of the seminormal
construction appears in [Goodman et al. 1989].
Iwahori–Hecke algebras of type An−1.
The analogue of Young’s seminormal
construction for this case is due, independently, to Hoefsmit [1974] and Wenzl
[1988a]. Various analogues of Young symmetrizers have been given by Gyoja
[1986], Dipper and James [1986], Murphy [1992; 1995], King and Wybourne
[1992] and Duchamp et al. [1995].
Brauer algebras. Analogues of Young’s seminormal representations have been
given, independently, by Nazarov [1996] and Leduc and Ram [1997]. An analogue
of the Young symmetrizer construction can be obtained by applying the Jones
Basic Construction to the classical Young symmetrizer construction and this
is the one that has been used by many authors [Benkart et al. 1990; Hanlon
and Wales 1989; Kerov 1992; Graham and Lehrer 1996]. The actual element
of the algebra that is the analogue of the Young symmetrizer involves a central
idempotent for which there is no known explicit formula and this is the reason
that most authors work with a quotient formulation of the appropriate module.
Birman–Murakami–Wenzl algebras. Analogues of Young’s seminormal represen-
tations have been given by Murakami [1990] and Leduc and Ram [1997], using
diﬀerent methods: Murakami uses the physical theory of Boltzmann weights,
whereas Leduc and Ram use the theory of ribbon Hopf algebras and quantum
groups.
Exactly in the same way as for the Brauer algebra, an analogue of
the Young symmetrizer construction can be obtained by applying the Jones Ba-
sic Construction to the Young symmetrizer constructions for the Iwahori–Hecke
algebra of type An−1. As in the Brauer algebra case one should work with a
quotient formulation of the module to avoid using a central idempotent for which
there is no known explicit formula.

5.4. Reﬂection Groups of Exceptional Type
Generalizing the Sn theory to ﬁnite Coxeter groups of exceptional type, ﬁnite
complex reﬂection groups of exceptional type and the corresponding Iwahori–
Hecke algebras, has been largely unsuccessful.
This is not to say that there
haven’t been some very nice partial results, only that at the moment nobody has
any understanding of how to make a good combinatorial theory to encompass
all the classical and exceptional types at once.
Two amazing partial results
along these lines are the Springer construction and the Kazhdan–Lusztig
construction.
The Springer construction is a construction of the irreducible representations
of the crystallographic reﬂection groups on cohomology of unipotent varieties
[Springer 1978]. It is a geometric construction and not a combinatorial construc-
tion. See Appendix A3 for more information in the symmetric group case. It is
possible that this construction may be combinatorialized in the future, but to
date no one has done this.
The Kazhdan–Lusztig construction [1979] is a construction of certain represen-
tations called cell representations and it works for all ﬁnite Coxeter groups. The
cell representations are almost irreducible but unfortunately not irreducible in
general, and nobody understands how to break them up into irreducibles, except
in a case by case fashion. The other problem with these representations is that
they depend crucially on certain polynomials, the Kazhdan–Lusztig polynomials,
which seem to be exceedingly diﬃcult to compute or understand well except in
very small cases; see [Brenti 1994] for more information. See [Carter 1985] for
a summary and tables of the known facts about representation of ﬁnite Coxeter
groups of exceptional type.
Remarks
(1) As mentioned in Section 5.1.2, a Hecke algebra is a speciﬁc double coset
algebra that depends on a group G and a subgroup B. Iwahori [1964] stud-
ied these algebras in the case that G is a ﬁnite Chevalley group and B is a
Borel subgroup of G, and deﬁned what are now called Iwahori–Hecke alge-
bras. These are q-analogues of the group algebras of ﬁnite Weyl groups. The
work of Iwahori yields a presentation for these algebras which can easily be
extended to deﬁne Iwahori–Hecke algebras for all Coxeter groups but, except
for the original Weyl group case, these have never been realized as true Hecke
algebras, i.e., double coset algebras corresponding to an appropriate G and B.
The “Hecke algebras” corresponding to the groups G(r, p, n) are q-analogues
of the group algebras of G(r, p, n).
Although these algebras are not true
Hecke algebras either, Brou´e and Malle [1993] have shown that many of these
algebras arise in connection with nondeﬁning characteristic representations of
ﬁnite Chevalley groups and Deligne–Lusztig varieties.

50
H´EL`ENE BARCELO AND ARUN RAM
(2) There is much current research on generalizing symmetric group results to
aﬃne Coxeter groups and aﬃne Hecke algebras. The case of aﬃne Coxeter
groups was done by Kato [1983] using ideas from Cliﬀord theory. The case of
aﬃne Hecke algebras has been intensely studied [Lusztig 1987a; 1987b; 1987b;
1989a; 1988; 1989b; 1995b; 1995a, Kazhdan and Lusztig 1987; Ginsburg 1987;
Chriss and Ginzburg 1997] Most of this work is very geometric and relies on
methods involving intersection cohomology and K-theory. Hopefully some of
this work will be made combinatorial in the near future.
(3) Wouldn’t it be great if we had a nice combinatorial representation theory
for ﬁnite simple groups!
6. Generalizations of GL(n, C) Results
There have been successful generalizations of the GL(n, C) results (Ia)–(Ic)
and (S1)–(S2) of Section 3 (pages 35–38) to the following classes of groups and
algebras.
(1) Connected complex semisimple Lie groups.
Examples:
SL(n, C),
SO(n, C), Sp(2n, C), PGL(n, C), PSO(2n, C), PSp(2n, C).
(2) Compact connected real Lie groups. Examples: SU(n, C), SO(n, R),
Sp(n), where Sp(n) = Sp(2n, C) ∩U(2n, C).
(3) Finite-dimensional complex semisimple Lie algebras.
Examples:
sl(n, C), so(n, C), sp(2n, C). See Appendix A7 for the complete list of the
ﬁnite-dimensional complex semisimple Lie algebras.
(4) Quantum groups corresponding to complex semisimple Lie alge-
bras.
The method of generalizing the GL(n, C) results to these objects is to reduce
them all to case (3) and then solve case (3). The results for case (3) are given in
Section 4. The reduction of cases (1) and (2) to case (3) are outlined in [Serre
1987], and given in more detail in [Varadarajan 1984] and [Br¨ocker and tom
Dieck 1985]. The reduction of (4) to (3) is given in [Chari and Pressley 1994]
and in [Jantzen 1996].
Partial Results for Further Generalizations
Some partial results along the lines of the results (Ia)–(Ic) and (S1)–(S2)
of Section 3 have been obtained for the following groups and algebras.
(1) Kac–Moody Lie algebras and groups
(2) Yangians
(3) Simple Lie superalgebras

COMBINATORIAL REPRESENTATION THEORY
51
Other groups and algebras, for which the combinatorial representation theory is
not understood very well, are
(4) Finite Chevalley groups
(5) p-adic Chevalley groups
(6) Real reductive Lie groups
(7) The Virasoro algebra
There are many many possible ways that we could extend this list but prob-
ably these four cases are the most fundamental cases where the combinatorial
representation theory has not been formulated. There has been intense work
on all of these cases, but hardly any by combinatorialists. Thus many beautiful
results are known, but very few of them have been stated or interpreted through
a combinatorialist’s eyes. They are gold veins yet to be mined!
Remarks
(1) An introductory reference to Kac–Moody Lie algebras is [Kac 1990]. This
book contains a good description of the basic representation theory of these
algebras. We don’t know of a good introductory reference for the Kac–Moody
groups case. We would suggest beginning with [Kostant and Kumar 1986] and
following the references given there.
(2) The basic introductory reference for Yangians and their basic representation
theory is [Chari and Pressley 1994, Chapter 12]. See also the references given
there.
(3) The best introductory reference for Lie superalgebras is [Scheunert 1979].
For an update on the combinatorial representation theory of these cases see
[Sergeev 1984; Berele and Regev 1987; Benkart et al. 1998; Serganova 1996].
(4) Finding a general combinatorial representation theory for ﬁnite Chevalley
groups has been elusive for many years. After the fundamental work of J.
A. Green [1955], which established a combinatorial representation theory for
GL(n, Fq), there has been a concerted eﬀort to extend these results to other
ﬁnite Chevalley groups. G. Lusztig [1978; 1977; 1984; 1974] has made im-
portant contributions to this ﬁeld; in particular, the results of Deligne and
Lusztig [1976] are fundamental. However, this is a geometric approach rather
than a combinatorial one and there is much work to be done for combinatori-
alists, even in interpreting the known results from a combinatorial viewpoint.
A good introductory treatment of this theory is the book by Digne and Michel
[1991]. The original work of Green is treated in [Macdonald 1995, Chap. IV].
(5) The representation theory of p-adic Lie groups has been studied intensely by
representation theorists but essentially not at all by combinatorialists. It is
clear that there is a beautiful (although possibly very diﬃcult) combinatorial
representation theory lurking here. The best introductory reference to this
work is the paper of R. Howe [1994] on p-adic GL(n). Recent results of G.

52
H´EL`ENE BARCELO AND ARUN RAM
Lusztig [1995a] are a very important step in providing a general combinatorial
representation theory for p-adic groups.
(6) The best places to read about the representation theory of real reductive
groups are the books [Knapp and Vogan 1995; Vogan 1987; 1981; Wallach
1988; 1992].
(7) The Virasoro algebra is a Lie algebra that seems to turn up in every back
alley of representation theory.
One can only surmise that it must have a
beautiful combinatorial representation theory that is waiting to be clariﬁed.
A good place to read about the Virasoro algebra is in [Fe˘ıgin and Fuchs 1990].
APPENDICES
A1. Basic Representation Theory
An algebra A is a vector space over C with a multiplication that is associative,
distributive, has an identity and satisﬁes the equation
(ca1)a2 = a1(ca2) = c(a1a2),
for all a1, a2 ∈A and c ∈C.
An A-module is a vector space M over C with an A-action A × M →M,
(a, m) 7→am, that satisﬁes
1m = m,
a1(a2m) = (a1a2)m,
(a1 + a2)m = a1m + a2m,
a(c1m1 + c2m2) = c1(am1) + c2(am2).
for all a, a1, a2 ∈A, m, m1, m2 ∈M and c1, c2 ∈C. We shall use the words
module and representation interchangeably.
A module M is indecomposable if there do not exist non zero A-modules M1
and M2 such that
M ∼= M1 ⊕M2.
A module M is irreducible or simple if the only submodules of M are the zero
module 0 and M itself. A module M is semisimple if it is the direct sum of
simple submodules.
An algebra is simple if the only ideals of A are the zero ideal 0 and A itself.
The radical rad(A) of an algebra A is the intersection of all the maximal left
ideals of A. An algebra A is semisimple if all its modules are semisimple. An
algebra A is Artinian if every decreasing sequence of left ideals of A stabilizes,
that is for every chain
A1 ⊇A2 ⊇A3 ⊇· · ·
of left ideals of A there is an integer m such that Ai = Am for all i ≥m.
The following statements follow directly from the deﬁnitions.

COMBINATORIAL REPRESENTATION THEORY
53
Let A be an algebra.
(a) Every irreducible A-module is indecomposable.
(b) The algebra A is semisimple if and only if every indecomposable A-module
is irreducible.
The proofs of the following statements are more involved and can be found in
[Bourbaki 1958, Chap. VIII, § 6 no4 and § 5 no3].
Theorem A1.1. (a) If A is an Artinian algebra, the radical of A is the largest
nilpotent ideal of A.
(b) An algebra A is semisimple if and only if A is Artinian and rad(A) = 0.
(c) Every semisimple algebra is a direct sum of simple algebras.
The case when A is not necessarily semisimple is often called modular represen-
tation theory. Let M be an A-module. A composition series of M is a chain
M = Mk ⊇Mk−1 ⊇· · · ⊇M1 ⊇M0 = 0,
such that, for each 1 ≤i ≤k, the modules Mi/Mi−1 are irreducible.
The
irreducible modules Mi/Mi−1 are the factors of the composition series.
The
following theorem is proved in [Curtis and Reiner 1962, (13.7)].
Theorem A1.2 (Jordan–H¨older). If there exists a composition series for M
then any two composition series must have the same multiset of factors (up to
module isomorphism).
An important combinatorial point of view is as follows: The analogue of the
subgroup lattice of a group can be studied for any A-module M. More precisely,
the submodule lattice L(M) of M is the lattice deﬁned by the submodules of
M with the order relations given by inclusions of submodules. The composition
series are maximal chains in this lattice.
References. All these results can be found in [Bourbaki 1958, Chap. VIII;
Curtis and Reiner 1962].
A2. Partitions and Tableaux
Partitions. A partition is a sequence λ = (λ1, . . ., λn) of integers such that
λ1 ≥· · · ≥λn ≥0.
We write λ ⊢N if N = λ1 + · · · + λn. It is conventional to identify a partition
with its Ferrers diagram, which has λi boxes in the i-th row. For example, the
partition λ = (55422211) has the Ferrers diagram shown at the top of the next
page.

54
H´EL`ENE BARCELO AND ARUN RAM
λ = (55422211)
We number the rows and columns of the Ferrers diagram as is conventionally
done for matrices.
If x is the box in λ in position (i, j), the content of x is
c(x) = j −i and the hook length of x is hx = λi −j + λ′
j −i + 1, where λ′
j is the
length of the j-th column of λ.

If µ and λ are partitions such that the Ferrers diagram of µ is contained in
that of λ, we write µ ⊆λ and we denote the diﬀerence of the Ferrers diagrams
by λ/µ. We refer to λ/µ as a shape or, more speciﬁcally, a skew shape.
λ/µ = (55422211)/(32211)

Tableaux. Suppose that λ has k boxes. A standard tableau of shape λ is a ﬁlling
of the Ferrers diagram of λ with 1, 2, . . ., k such that the rows and columns are
increasing from left to right and from top to bottom respectively.

Let λ/µ be a shape. A column strict tableau of shape λ/µ ﬁlled with 1, 2, . . .n
is a ﬁlling of the Ferrers diagram of λ/µ with elements of the set {1, 2, . . ., n}
such that the rows are weakly increasing from left to right and the columns are
strictly increasing from top to bottom. The weight of a column strict tableau T
is the sequence of positive integers ν = (ν1, . . ., νn), where νi is the number of
i’s in T.

obtained by reading the entries of T from right to left in successive rows, starting
with the top row. A word w = w1 · · ·wp is a lattice permutation if for each
1 ≤r ≤p and each 1 ≤i ≤n −1 the number of occurrences of the symbol i in
w1 · · ·wr is not less than the number of occurrences of i + 1 in w1 · · ·wr.

A border strip is a skew shape λ/µ that
(a) is connected (two boxes are connected if they share an edge), and
(b) does not contain a 2 × 2 block of boxes.
The weight of a border strip λ/µ is given by
wt(λ/µ) = (−1)r(λ/µ)−1,
where r(λ/µ) is the number of rows in λ/µ.
λ/µ = (86333)/(5222)
wt(λ/µ) = (−1)5−1
Let λ and µ = (µ1, . . ., µl) be partitions of n. A µ-border strip tableau of shape
λ is a sequence of partitions
T = (∅= λ(0) ⊆λ(1) ⊆· · · ⊆λ(l−1) ⊆λ(l) = λ)
such that, for each 1 ≤i ≤l,
(a) λ(i)/λ(i−1) is a border strip, and
(b) |λ(i)/λ(i−1)| = µi.

A Borel subgroup of GL(n, C) is a subgroup that is conjugate to Bn.
A Cartan subgroup of GL(n, C) is a subgroup that is conjugate to Tn.
A matrix u ∈GL(n, C) is unipotent if it is conjugate to an upper unitriangular

The ﬂag variety. There are one-to-one correspondences among the following
sets:
(1) B = {Borel subgroups of GL(n, C)},
(2) G/B, where G = GL(n, C) and B = Bn,
(3) {ﬂags 0 ⊆V1 ⊆V2 ⊆· · · ⊆Vn = Cn such that dim(Vi) = i}.
Each of these sets naturally has the structure of a complex algebraic variety, that
is called the ﬂag variety.
The unipotent varieties. Given a unipotent element u ∈GL(n, C) with Jor-
dan blocks given by the partition µ = (µ1, . . ., µl) of n, deﬁne an algebraic
variety
Bµ = Bu = {Borel subgroups of GL(n, C) that contain u}.
By conjugation, the structure of the subvariety Bu of the ﬂag variety depends
only on the partition µ. Thus Bµ is well deﬁned, as an algebraic variety.

Springer theory. It is a deep theorem of Springer [1978] (which holds in the
generality of semisimple algebraic groups and their corresponding Weyl groups)
that there is an action of the symmetric group Sn on the cohomology H∗(Bu) of
the variety Bu. This action can be interpreted nicely as follows. The imbedding
Bu ⊆B
induces a surjective map
H∗(B) −→H∗(Bu).
It is a famous theorem of Borel that there is a ring isomorphism
H∗(B) ∼= C[x1, . . ., xn]/I+,
(A3–1)
where I+ is the ideal generated by symmetric functions without constant term.
It follows that H∗(Bu) is also a quotient of C[x1, . . ., xn]. From the work of
Kraft [1981], DeConcini and Procesi [1981] and Tanisaki [1982], one has that the
ideal Tu which it is necessary to quotient by in order to obtain an isomorphism
H∗(Bu) ∼= C[x1, . . ., xn]/Tu,
can be described explicitly.
The symmetric group Sn acts on the polynomial ring C[x1, . . ., xn] by per-
muting the variables. It turns out that the ideal Tu remains invariant under
this action, thus yielding a well deﬁned action of Sn on C[x1, . . ., xn]/Tu. This
action coincides with the Springer action on H∗(Bu). Hotta and Springer [1977]
have established that, if u is a unipotent element of shape µ then, for every
permutation w ∈Sn,
X
i
qiε(w) trace(w−1, H2i(Bu)) =
X
λ⊢n
˜Kλµ(q)χλ(w),
where
ε(w) is the sign of the permutation w,
trace(w−1, H2i(Bu)) is the trace of the action of w−1 on H2i(Bu),
χλ(w) is the irreducible character of the symmetric group evaluated at w, and
˜Kλµ(q) is a variant of the Kostka–Foulkes polynomial; see [Macdonald 1995,
Chap. III, § 7, Ex. 8, and § 6].
It follows from this discussion and some basic facts about the polynomials ˜Kλµ(q)
that the top degree cohomology group in H∗(Bµ) is a realization of the irre-
ducible representation of Sn indexed by µ,
Sµ ∼= Htop(Bµ).
This construction of the irreducible modules of Sn is the Springer construction.

A4. Polynomial and Rational Representations of GL(n, C)
If V is a GL(n, C)-module of dimension d then, by choosing a basis of V , we
can deﬁne a map
ρV : GL(n, C)
−→
GL(d, C)
g
7−→
ρ(g),
where ρ(g) is the transformation of V that is induced by the action of g on V .
Let
gij denote the (i, j) entry of the matrix g, and
ρ(g)kl denote the (k, l) entry of the matrix ρ(g).
The map ρ depends on the choice of the basis of V , but the following deﬁnitions
do not.
The module V is a polynomial representation if there are polynomials pkl(xij),
for 1 ≤k, l ≤d, such that
ρ(g)kl = pkl(gij),
for all 1 ≤k, l ≤d.
In other words ρ(g)jk is the same as the polynomial pkl evaluated at the entries
gij of the matrix g.
The module V is a rational representation if there are rational functions (quo-
tients of two polynomials) pkl(xij)/qkl(xij), for 1 ≤k, l ≤d, such that
ρ(g)kl = pkl(gij)/qkl(gij),
for all 1 ≤k, l ≤n.
Clearly, every polynomial representation is a rational one.
The theory of rational representations of GL(n, C) can be reduced to the theory
of polynomial representations of GL(n, C). This is accomplished as follows. The
determinant det : GL(n, C) →C deﬁnes a 1-dimensional (polynomial) represen-
tation of GL(n, C). Any integral power
detk :
GL(n, C)
−→
C
g
7−→
det(g)k
of the determinant also determines a 1-dimensional representation of GL(n, C).
All irreducible rational representations GL(n, C) can be constructed in
the form
detk ⊗V λ,

for some k ∈Z and some irreducible polynomial representation V λ of GL(n, C).
There exist representations of GL(n, C) that are not rational representations, for

There is no known classiﬁcation of representations of GL(n, C) that are not
rational.

the rational representations of GL(n, C).
A5. Schur–Weyl Duality and Young Symmetrizers
Let V be the usual n-dimensional representation of GL(n, C) on column vec-
tors of length n, that is
V = span{b1, . . ., bn}
where
bi = (0, . . ., 0, 1, 0, . . ., 0)t,
and the 1 in bi appears in the i-th entry. Then
V ⊗k = span{bi1 ⊗· · · ⊗bik | 1 ≤i1, . . ., ik ≤n}
is the span of the words of length k in the letters bi (except that the letters
are separated by tensor symbols). The general linear group GL(n, C) and the
symmetric group Sk act on V ⊗k by
g(v1 ⊗· · · ⊗vk) = gv1 ⊗· · · ⊗gvk,
and
(v1 ⊗· · · ⊗vk)σ = vσ(1) ⊗· · · ⊗vσ(k),
where g ∈GL(n, C), σ ∈Sk, and v1, . . ., vk ∈V . We have chosen to make the
Sk-action a right action here; one could equally well choose the action of Sk to
be a left action, but then the formula would be
σ(v1 ⊗· · · ⊗vk) = vσ−1(1) ⊗· · · ⊗vσ−1(k).
The following theorem is the amazing relationship between the group Sk and
the group GL(n, C) discovered by Schur [1901] and exploited with such success
by Weyl [1946].
Theorem A5.1 (Schur–Weyl duality).
(a) The action of Sk on V ⊗k generates EndGl(n,C)(V ⊗k).
(b) The action of GL(n, C) on V ⊗k generates EndSk(V ⊗k).
This theorem has an corollary that provides an intimate correspondence between
the representation theory of Sk and some of the representations of GL(n, C) (the
ones indexed by partitions of k).

V λ ⊗Sλ,
where V λ is the irreducible GL(n, C)-module and Sλ is the irreducible Sk-module
indexed by λ.
If λ is a partition of k, the irreducible GL(n, C)-representation V λ is given by
V λ ∼= V ⊗kP (T)N(T),
where T is a tableau of shape λ and P (T) and N(T) are as deﬁned in Section 2,
Question C (page 31).
A6. The Borel–Weil–Bott Construction
Let G = GL(n, C) and let B = Bn be the subgroup of upper triangular
matrices in GL(n, C).
A line bundle on G/B is a pair (L, p) where L is an
algebraic variety and p is a map (morphism of algebraic varieties)
p : L −→G/B,
such that the ﬁbers of p are lines and such that L is a locally trivial family
of lines. In this deﬁnition, ﬁbers means the sets p−1(x) for x ∈G/B and lines
means one-dimensional vector spaces. For the deﬁnition of locally trivial family of
lines see [Shafarevich 1994, Chap. VI, § 1.2]. By abuse of language, a line bundle
(L, p) is simply denoted by L. Conceptually, a line bundle on G/B means that
we are putting a one-dimensional vector space over each point in G/B.
A global section of the line bundle L is a map (morphism of algebraic varieties)
s : G/B →L
such that p ◦s is the identity map on G/B. In other words a global section is
any possible “right inverse map” to the line bundle.
Each partition λ = (λ1, . . ., λn) determines a character (one-dimensional rep-
resentation) of the group Tn of diagonal matrices in GL(n, C) via
λ

Extend this character to be a character of B = Bn by letting λ ignore the strictly
upper triangular part of the matrix, that is λ(u) = 1, for all u ∈Un. Let Lλ be
the ﬁber product G ×B λ, that is, the set of equivalence classes of pairs (g, c),
with g ∈G and c ∈C∗, under the equivalence relation
(gb, c) ∼(g, λ(b−1)c),
for all b ∈B.

Then Lλ = G ×B λ with the map

The Borel–Weil–Bott theorem says that the irreducible representation V λ of
GLn(C) is
V λ ∼= H0(G/B, Lλ),
where H0(G/B, Lλ) is the space of global sections of the line bundle Lλ.

A7. Complex Semisimple Lie Algebras
A ﬁnite-dimensional complex semisimple Lie algebra is a ﬁnite-dimensional
Lie algebra g over C such that rad(g) = 0. The following theorem classiﬁes all
ﬁnite-dimensional complex semisimple Lie algebras.
Theorem A7.1. (a) Every ﬁnite-dimensional complex semisimple Lie algebra
g is a direct sum of complex simple Lie algebras.
(b) There is one complex simple Lie algebra corresponding to each of the follow-
ing types
An−1, Bn, Cn, Dn, E6, E7, E8, F4, G2.
The complex simple Lie algebras of types An, Bn, Cn and Dn are the ones of
classical type and they are:
Type An−1:
sl(n, C) = {A ∈Mn(C) | Tr(A) = 0},
Type Bn:
so(2n + 1, C) = {A ∈M2n+1(C) | A + At = 0},
Type Cn:
sp(2n, C) = {A ∈M2n(C) | AJ + JAt = 0},
Type Dn:
so(2n) = {A ∈M2n(C) | A + At = 0},
where J is the matrix of a skew-symmetric form on a 2n-dimensional space.
Let g be a complex semisimple Lie algebra.
A Cartan subalgebra of g is a
maximal abelian subalgebra h of g. Fix a Cartan subalgebra h of g. If V is a
ﬁnite-dimensional g-module and µ : h →C is any linear function, deﬁne
Vµ = {v ∈V | hv = µ(h)v
for all h ∈h}.
The space Vµ is the µ-weight space of V . It is a nontrivial theorem [Serre 1987]
that
V =

Let C[P ] be the group algebra of P . It can be given explicitly as
C[P ] = C-span{eµ | µ ∈P },
with multiplication eµeν = eµ+ν, for µ, ν ∈P ,
where the eµ are formal variables indexed by the elements of P . The character
of a g-module is

Killing, from the late 1800’s. The beautiful text of Serre [1987] gives a review of
the deﬁnitions and theory of complex semisimple Lie algebras. See [Humphreys
1972] for further details.
A8. Roots, Weights and Paths
To each of the “types”, An, Bn, etc., there is an associated hyperplane ar-
rangement A in Rn (Figure 1). The space Rn has the usual Euclidean inner
product ⟨· , · ⟩. For each hyperplane in the arrangement A we choose two vectors
orthogonal to the hyperplane and pointing in opposite directions. This set of
chosen vectors is called the root system R associated to A (Figure 2, left). There
is a convention for choosing the lengths of these vectors but we shall not worry
about that here.
Choose a chamber (connected component) C of Rn\ S
H∈A H (Figure 2, right).
For each root α ∈R we say that α is positive if it points toward the same side
of the hyperplane as C is and negative if points toward the opposite side. It is
standard notation to write
 α > 0,
if α is a positive root,
α < 0,
if α is a negative root.

The positive roots associated to hyperplanes that form the walls of C are the
simple roots {α1, . . ., αn}. The fundamental weights are the vectors {ω1, . . ., ωn}
in Rn such that
⟨ωi, α∨

B1. Coxeter Groups, Groups Generated by Reﬂections, and
Weyl Groups
A Coxeter group is a group W presented by generators S = {s1, . . ., sn} and
relations
s2
i = 1,
for 1 ≤i ≤n,
(sisj)mij = 1,
for 1 ≤i ̸= j ≤n,
where each mij is either ∞or a positive integer greater than 1.
A reﬂection is a linear transformation of Rn that is a reﬂection in some hyper-
plane.
A ﬁnite group generated by reﬂections is a ﬁnite subgroup of GL(n, R) generated
by reﬂections.
Theorem B1.1. The ﬁnite Coxeter groups are exactly the ﬁnite groups gener-
ated by reﬂections.
A ﬁnite Coxeter group is irreducible if it cannot be written as a direct product
of ﬁnite Coxeter groups.
Theorem B1.2 (Classification of finite Coxeter groups).
(a) Every ﬁnite Coxeter group can be written as a direct product of irreducible
ﬁnite Coxeter groups.
(b) There is one irreducible ﬁnite Coxeter group corresponding to each of the
following “types”
An−1, Bn, Dn, E6, E7, E8, F4, H3, H4, I2(m).

66
H´EL`ENE BARCELO AND ARUN RAM
The irreducible ﬁnite Coxeter groups of classical type are those of types An−1, Bn,
and Dn and the others are the irreducible ﬁnite Coxeter groups of exceptional
type.
(a) The group of type An−1 is the symmetric group Sn.
(b) The group of type Bn is the hyperoctahedral group (Z/2Z) ≀Sn, the wreath
product of the group of order 2 and the symmetric group Sn. It has order
2nn!.
(c) The group of type Dn is a subgroup of index 2 in the Coxeter group of type
Bn.
(d) The group of type I2(m) is a dihedral group of order 2m.
A ﬁnite group W generated by reﬂections in Rn is crystallographic if there is
a lattice in Rn stable under the action of W. The crystallographic ﬁnite Cox-
eter groups are also called Weyl groups. The irreducible Weyl groups are the
irreducible ﬁnite Coxeter groups of types
An−1, Bn, Dn, E6, E7, E8, F4, G2 = I2(6).
References. The most comprehensive reference for ﬁnite groups generated by
reﬂections is [Bourbaki 1968]. See also the [Humphreys 1990].
B2. Complex Reﬂection Groups
A complex reﬂection is an invertible linear transformation of Cn of ﬁnite order
which has exactly one eigenvalue that is not 1. A complex reﬂection group is a
group generated by complex reﬂections in Cn.
The ﬁnite complex reﬂection
groups have been classiﬁed by Shepard and Todd [1954]. Each ﬁnite complex
reﬂection group is either
(a) G(r, p, n) for some positive integers r, p, n such that p divides r, or
(b) one of 34 other “exceptional” ﬁnite complex reﬂection groups.
Let r, p, d and n be positive integers such that pd = r. The complex reﬂection
group G(r, p, n) is the set of n × n matrices such that
(a) The entries are either 0 or r-th roots of unity,
(b) There is exactly one nonzero entry in each row and each column,
(c) The d-th power of the product for the nonzero entries is 1.
The group G(r, p, n) is a normal subgroup of G(r, 1, n) of index p and
|G(r, p, n)| = drn−1n!.
In addition:
(a) G(1, 1, n) ∼= Sn the symmetric group or Weyl group of type An−1,
(b) G(2, 1, n) is the hyperoctahedral group or Weyl group of type Bn,

COMBINATORIAL REPRESENTATION THEORY
67
(c) G(r, 1, n) ∼= (Z/rZ) ≀Sn, the wreath product of the cyclic group of order r
with Sn,
(d) G(2, 2, n) is the Weyl group of type Dn.
Partial Results for G(r, 1, n)
Here are the answers to the main questions (Ia)–(Ic) (page 27) for the groups
G(r, 1, n) ∼= (Z/rZ) ≀Sn. For the general G(r, p, n) case see [Halverson and Ram
1998].
I. What are the irreducible G(r, 1, n)-modules?
(a) How do we index/count them?
There is a bijection
r-tuples λ = (λ(1), . . ., λ(r)) of partitions such that Pr

where hx is the hook length at the box x.
A standard tableau of shape
λ = (λ(1), . . ., λ(r)) is any ﬁlling of the boxes of the λ(i) with the numbers
1, 2, . . ., n such that the rows and the columns of each λ(i) are increasing.
(c) What are their characters?
A Murnaghan–Nakayama type rule for the characters of the groups G(r, 1, n)
was originally given by Specht [1932]. See also [Osima 1954; Halverson and
Ram 1998].

1989b; Malle 1995] contain other recent work on the combinatorics of these
groups.

the pair (G, B) is the subalgebra

Tw =

|B|
X
g∈BwB
g,
as w runs over a set of representatives of the double cosets B\G/B, form a basis
of H(G, B).
Let G be a ﬁnite Chevalley group over the ﬁeld Fq with q elements and ﬁx a
Borel subgroup B of G. The pair (G, B) determines a pair (W, S) where W is
the Weyl group of G and S is a set of simple reﬂections in W (with respect to B).
The Iwahori–Hecke algebra corresponding to G is the Hecke algebra H(G, B).
In this case the basis elements Tw are indexed by the elements w of the Weyl
group W corresponding to the pair (G, B) and the multiplication is given by
TsTw =
(
Tsw,
if l(sw) > l(w),
(q −1)Tw + qTsw,
if l(sw) < l(w),
if s is a simple reﬂection in W. In this formula l(w) is the length of w, i.e., the
minimum number of factors needed to write w as a product of simple reﬂections.
A particular example of the Iwahori–Hecke algebra occurs when G = GL(n, Fq)
and B is the subgroup of upper triangular matrices.
Then the Weyl group
W, is the symmetric group Sn, and the simple reﬂections in the set S are the
transpositions si = (i, i+1), for 1 ≤i ≤n −1. In this case the algebra H(G, B)
is the Iwahori–Hecke algebra of type An−1 and (as we will see in Theorems B5.1
and B5.2) can be presented by generators T1, . . ., Tn−1 and relations
TiTj = TjTi,
for |i −j| > 1,
TiTi+1Ti = Ti+1TiTi+1,
for 1 ≤i ≤n −2,
T 2
i = (q −1)Ti + q,
for 2 ≤i ≤n.
See Appendix B5 for more facts about the Iwahori–Hecke algebras of type A.
In particular, these Iwahori–Hecke algebras also appear as tensor power central-
izer algebras; see Theorem B5.3. This is rather miraculous: the Iwahori–Hecke
algebras of type A are the only Iwahori–Hecke algebras which arise naturally as
tensor power centralizers.
In view of the multiplication rules for the Iwahori–Hecke algebras of Weyl groups
it is easy to deﬁne a “Hecke algebra” for all Coxeter groups (W, S), just by
deﬁning it to be the algebra with basis Tw, for w ∈W, and multiplication
TsTw =
(
Tsw,
if l(sw) > l(w),
(q −1)Tw + qTsw,
if l(sw) < l(w),
if s ∈S. These algebras are not true Hecke algebras except when W is a Weyl
group.

B4. “Hecke algebras” of the Groups G(r, p, n)
Let q and u0, u1, . . ., ur−1 be indeterminates. Let Hr,1,n be the algebra over
the ﬁeld C(u0, u1, . . ., ur−1, q) given by generators T1, T2, . . ., Tn and relations
(1)
TiTj = TjTi,
for |i −j| > 1,

(T1 −u0)(T1 −u1) · · · (T1 −ur−1) = 0,
(5)
(Ti −q)(Ti + q−1) = 0,
for 2 ≤i ≤n.
Upon setting q = 1 and ui−1 = ξi−1, where ξ is a primitive r-th root of unity,
one obtains the group algebra CG(r, 1, n). In the special case where r = 1 and
u0 = 1, we have T1 = 1, and H1,1,n is isomorphic to an Iwahori–Hecke algebra
of type An−1. The case H2,1,n when r = 2, u0 = p, and u1 = p−1, is isomorphic
to an Iwahori–Hecke algebra of type Bn.
Now suppose that p and d are positive integers such that pd = r.
Let
x1/p
0
, . . ., x1/p
d−1 be indeterminates, let ε = e2πi/p be a primitive p-th root of unity
and specialize the variables u0, . . ., ur−1 according to the relation

k
,
where the subscripts on the ui are taken mod r. The “Hecke algebra” Hr,p,n
corresponding to the group G(r, p, n) is the subalgebra of Hr,1,n generated by the
elements
a0 = T p

a1 = T −1
1
T2T1,
and
ai = Ti,
for 2 ≤i ≤n.
Upon specializing x1/p
k
= ξkp, where ξ is a primitive r-th root of unity, Hr,p,n
becomes the group algebra CG(r, p, n). Thus Hr,p,n is a “q-analogue” of the
group algebra of the group G(r, p, n).
References. The algebras Hr,1,n were ﬁrst constructed by Ariki and Koike
[1994]. They were classiﬁed as cyclotomic Hecke algebras of type Bn by Brou´e
and Malle [1993] and the representation theory of Hr,p,n was studied by Ariki
[1995]. See [Halverson and Ram 1998] for information about the characters of

Given a permutation w ∈Sk we will make a k-braid Tw by tracing the edges
in order from left to right across the top row. Any time an edge that we are

The Iwahori–Hecke algebra of type A is a q-analogue of the group algebra of the
symmetric group. If we allow ourselves to be imprecise (about the limit) we can
write
lim
q→1 Hk(q) = CSk.
Let q be a power of a prime and let G = GL(n, Fq) where Fq is the ﬁnite
ﬁeld with q elements. Let B be the subgroup of upper triangular matrices in G
and let 1G
B be the trivial representation of B induced to G, i.e., the G-module
given by
1G
B = C-span{gB | g ∈G},
where G acts on the cosets by left multiplication. Using the description of Hn(q)
as a double coset algebra (Appendix B3), one gets an action of Hn(q) on 1G
B, by
right multiplication. This action commutes with the G action.
Theorem B5.2. (a) The action of Hn(q) on 1G
B generates EndG(1G
B).
(b) The action of G on 1G
B generates EndHn(q)(1G
B).
This theorem gives a “duality” between GL(n, Fq) and Hn(q) that is similar to a
Schur–Weyl duality, but diﬀers in a crucial way: the representation 1G
B is not a
tensor power representation, and thus this is not yet realizing Hn(q) as a tensor
power centralizer.
The following result gives a true analogue of the Schur–Weyl duality for the
Iwahori–Hecke algebra of type A: it realizes Hk(q) as a tensor power centralizer.
Assume that q ∈C is not 0 and is not a root of unity. Let Uqsln be the Drinfel’d–
Jimbo quantum group of type An−1 and let V be the n-dimensional irreducible
representation of Uqsln with highest weight ω1. There is an action of Hk(q2) on
V ⊗k which commutes with the Uqsln action; see [Chari and Pressley 1994].
Theorem B5.3. (a) The action of Hk(q2) on V ⊗k generates EndUqsln(V ⊗k).
(b) The action of Uqsln on V ⊗k generates EndHk(q2)(V ⊗k).
Theorem B5.4. The Iwahori–Hecke algebra of type Ak−1, Hk(q), is semisimple
if and only if q ̸= 0 and q is not a j-th root of unity for any 2 ≤j ≤n.
Partial Results for Hk(q)
The following results give answers to the main questions (Ia)–(Ic) for the
Iwahori–Hecke algebras of type A hold when q is such that Hk(q) is semisimple.

The dimension of the irreducible representation Hλ is given by
dim(Hλ) = # of standard tableaux of shape λ =
n!
Q
x∈λ hx
,
where hx is the hook length at the box x in λ.
(c) What are their characters?
For each partition µ = (µ1, µ2, . . ., µl) of k, let χλ(µ) be the character of the
irreducible representation Hλ evaluated at the element Tγµ where γµ is the
permutation
γµ =
|
{z
}
µ1
| {z }
µ2
· · ·
|{z}

.
Then the character χλ(µ) is given by
χλ(µ) =
X
T
wtµ(T),
where the sum is over all standard tableaux T of shape λ and
wtµ(T) =
n
Y
i=1
f(i, T),
where
f(i, T) =



−1,
if i ̸∈B(µ) and i + 1 is SW of i,
0,
if i, i + 1 ̸∈B(µ), i + 1 is NE of i, and i + 2 is SW of i + 1,
q,
otherwise,
and B(µ) = {µ1 + µ2 + · · · + µk|1 ≤k ≤l}. In the formula for f(i, T), SW
means strictly south and weakly west and NE means strictly north and weakly
east.

B6. The Brauer Algebras Bk(x)
Fix x ∈C. A Brauer diagram on k dots is a graph on two rows of k-vertices,
one above the other, and k edges such that each vertex is incident to precisely one
edge. The product of two k-diagrams d1 and d2 is obtained by placing d1 above
d2 and identifying the vertices in the bottom row of d1 with the corresponding

COMBINATORIAL REPRESENTATION THEORY
73
vertices in the top row of d2. The resulting graph contains k paths and some
number c of closed loops. If d is the k-diagram with the edges that are the paths
in this graph but with the closed loops removed, then the product d1d2 is given
by d1d2 = xcd. For example, if
d1 =
and
d2 =
,
then
d1d2 =
= x2
.
The Brauer algebra Bk(x) is the span of the k-diagrams with multiplication
given by the linear extension of the diagram multiplication. The dimension of
the Brauer algebra is
dim(Bk(x)) = (2k)!! = (2k −1)(2k −3) · · · 3 · 1,
since the number of k-diagrams is (2k)!!.
The diagrams in Bk(x) that have all their edges connecting top vertices to
bottom vertices form a symmetric group Sk. The elements
si =

for 1 ≤i ≤k −1, generate the Brauer algebra Bk(x).
Theorem B6.1. The Brauer algebra Bk(x) has a presentation as an algebra by
generators s1, s2, . . ., sk−1, e1, e2, . . ., ek−1 and relations

i = 1,

sisi+1si = si+1sisi+1,
eiei+1ei = ei,
ei+1eiei+1 = ei+1,
for 1 ≤i ≤k −2,
siei+1ei = si+1ei,
ei+1eisi+1 = ei+1si,
for 1 ≤i ≤k −2.
There are two diﬀerent Brauer algebra analogues of the Schur Weyl duality
theorem, Theorem A5.1. In the ﬁrst one the orthogonal group O(n, C) plays the
same role that GL(n, C) played in the Sk-case, and in the second, the symplectic
group Sp(2n, C) takes the GL(n, C) role.
Let O(n, C) = {A ∈Mn(C) | AAt = I} be the orthogonal group and let V be
the usual n-dimensional representation of the group O(n, C). There is an action
of the Brauer algebra Bk(n) on V ⊗k which commutes with the action of O(n, C)
on V ⊗k.
Theorem B6.2. (a) The action of Bk(n) on V ⊗k generates EndO(n)(V ⊗k).
(b) The action of O(n, C) on V ⊗k generates EndBk(n)(V ⊗k).

Let Sp(2n, C) be the symplectic group and let V be the usual 2n-dimensional
representation of the group Sp(2n, C). There is an action of the Brauer algebra
Bk(−2n) on V ⊗k which commutes with the action of Sp(2n, C) on V ⊗k.
Theorem B6.3. (a)The action of Bk(−2n) on V ⊗k generates EndSp(2n,C)(V ⊗k).
(a) The action of Sp(2n, C) on V ⊗k generates EndBk(−2n)(V ⊗k).
Theorem B6.4. The Brauer algebra Bk(x) is semisimple if
x ̸∈{−2k + 3, −2k + 2, . . ., k −2}.
Partial Results for Bk(x)
The following results giving answers to the main questions (Ia)–(Ic) for the
Brauer algebras hold when x is such that Bk(x) is semisimple.

(2h −1)!! (k −2h)!
Q
x∈λ hx
,
where hx is the hook length at the box x in λ. An up-down tableau of shape λ
and length k is a sequence (∅=λ(0), λ(1), . . . λ(k)=λ) of partitions, such that
each partition in the sequence diﬀers from the previous one by either adding
or removing a box.
(c) What are their characters?
A Murnaghan–Nakayama type rule for the characters of the Brauer algebras
was given in [Ram 1995].
References. The Brauer algebra was deﬁned originally by R. Brauer [1937]; it
is also treated in [Weyl 1946]. The Schur–Weyl duality type theorems are also
proved in Brauer’s original paper [1937]. See also [Ram 1995] for a detailed
description of these Brauer algebra actions. The theorem giving values of x for
which the Brauer algebra is semisimple is due to Wenzl [1988b].

B7. The Birman–Murakami–Wenzl Algebras BMWk(r, q)
A k-tangle is viewed as two rows of k vertices, one above the other, and
k strands that connect vertices in such a way that each vertex is incident to
precisely one strand. Strands cross over and under one another other in three-
space as they pass from one vertex to the next.
For example, here are two
7-tangles:
t1 =
,
t2 =
.
We multiply k-tangles t1 and t2 using the concatenation product given by iden-
tifying the vertices in the top row of t2 with the corresponding vertices in the
bottom row of t1 to obtain the product tangle t1t2. Then we allow the following
“moves”:
Reidemeister move II:
←→
←→
Reidemeister move III:
←→
Given a Brauer diagram d we will make a tangle Td tracing the edges in
order from left to right across the top row and then from left to right across the
bottom row. Any time an edge that we are tracing crosses and edge that has
been already traced we raise the pen brieﬂy so that the edge being traced goes
under the edge that is already there. Applying this process to all of the Brauer
diagrams on k dots produces a set of (2k)!! tangles.
d =
Td =
Fix numbers r, q ∈C. The Birman–Murakami–Wenzl algebra BMWk(r, q) is
the span of the (2k)!! tangles produced by tracing the Brauer diagrams with
multiplication determined by the tangle multiplication, the Reidemeister moves
and the following tangle identities.

76
H´EL`ENE BARCELO AND ARUN RAM
The Reidemeister moves and the tangle identities can be applied in any appro-
priate local portion of the tangle.
Theorem B7.1. Fix numbers r, q ∈C. The Birman–Murakami–Wenzl alge-
bra BMWk(r, q) is the algebra generated over C by 1, g1, g2, . . ., gk−1, which are
assumed to be invertible, subject to the relations
gigi+1gi = gi+1gigi+1,
gigj = gjgi
if |i −j| ≥2,
(gi −r−1)(gi + q−1)(gi −q) = 0,
Eig±1
i−1Ei = r±1Ei
and
Eig±1
i+1Ei = r±1Ei,
where Ei is deﬁned by the equation
(q −q−1)(1 −Ei) = gi −g−1
i
.
The BMW-algebra is a q-analogue of the Brauer algebra in the same sense that
the Iwahori–Hecke algebra of type A is a q-analogue of the group algebra of the
symmetric group. If we allow ourselves to be imprecise (about the limit) we can
write
lim
q→1 BMWk(qn+1, q) = Bk(n).
It would be interesting to sharpen the following theorem to make it an if and
only if statement.
Theorem B7.2 [Wenzl 1990]. The Birman–Murakami–Wenzl algebra is semi-
simple if q is not a root of unity and r ̸= qn+1 for any n ∈Z.
Partial Results for BMWk(r, q)
The following results hold when r and q are such that BMWk(r, q) is semi-
simple.

in the case (Ib) of the Brauer algebra (page 74).
(c) What are their characters?
A Murnaghan–Nakayama rule for the irreducible characters of the BMW-
algebras was given in [Halverson and Ram 1995].

by Birman and Wenzl [1989] and by Murakami [1987]. See [Chari and Pressley

The articles [Halverson and Ram 1995; Leduc and Ram 1997; Murakami 1990;
Reshetikhin 1987; Wenzl 1990] contain further important information about the
BMW-algebras.
Kaufmann [1990] ﬁrst formalized the tangle description of the BMW-algebra.
B8. The Temperley–Lieb Algebras TLk(x)
A TLk-diagram is a Brauer diagram on k dots that can be drawn with no
crossings of edges.
The Temperley–Lieb algebra TLk(x) is the subalgebra of the Brauer algebra
Bk(x) that is the span of the TLk-diagrams.
Theorem B8.1.
The Temperley–Lieb algebra TLk(x) is the algebra over C

for 1 ≤i ≤n −2.
The Schur–Weyl duality theorem for Sn has the following analogue for the
Temperley–Lieb algebras. Let Uqsl2 be the Drinfeld–Jimbo quantum group cor-

ment of the basic results on the Temperley–Lieb algebra. The Schur–Weyl dual-
ity theorem is treated in [Chari and Pressley 1994]; see also the references there.

B9. Complex Semisimple Lie Groups
We shall not deﬁne Lie groups and Lie algebras. We recall simply that a com-
plex Lie group is a diﬀerential C-manifold, that a real Lie group is a diﬀerential
R-manifold and that every Lie group has an associated Lie algebra; see [Carter
et al. 1995].
If G is a complex Lie group, the word representation usually refers to a holo-
morphic representation, i.e., the homomorphism
ρ : G →GL(V )
determined by the module V should be a morphism of (complex) analytic man-
ifolds. Strictly speaking there are representations which are not holomorphic
but there is a good theory only for holomorphic representations, so one usually
abuses language and assumes that representation means holomorphic representa-
tion. The terms holomorphic representation and complex analytic representation
are used interchangeably. Similarly, if G is a real Lie group then representation
usually means real analytic representation. See [Varadarajan 1984, p. 102] for
further details. Every holomorphic representation of GL(n, C) is also a rational
representation; see [Fulton and Harris 1991].
A complex semisimple Lie group is a connected complex Lie group G such that
its Lie algebra g is a complex semisimple Lie algebra.
