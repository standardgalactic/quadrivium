PREFACE ") 
These notes constitute the preliminary version of a book on lattices 
over orders. This might explain why we have included elementary defi- 
nitions and theorems, thus deviating from the original character of 
the LECTURE NOTES. The notes consist of two volumes, and to make the 
first one, which mainly develops the theory of maximal orders, self- 
contained we have included a list of references and an index. 
Because of the preliminary character of the notes we welcome every 
suggestion which might improve the later book. 
This work is an attempt to close the gap between the producing 
research scientist and the consuming reader. Our own experience has 
convinced us that our field abounds with "mathematical folklore". The 
theory of orders is quite essentially based on this kind of common 
knowledge, especially from related fields, such as algebraic number 
and class field theory, homological algebra and the theory of algebras. 
As a matter of fact, the rapid modern development since 1950 employs 
this type of results as well as many early papers both as tools and 
as guiding light. Moreover, it seems that this development has 
reached a certain culminating point with some of the most recent re- 
sults, and we feel it is ready for presentation in a reasonably com- 
plete form. Thus we are undertaking the task of clarifying the theory 
of orders eo ipso, of systematizing the wealth of existing and non- 
existing literature, and last but not least, to bring into unified 
form and to modernize, where we feel it is necessary, this vast field 
of knowledge. 
Apart from this subjective motivation, the book shall serve two - 
in our opinion equally important - purposes@ On the one hand it shall

allow a good student or the eager reader, who is not a specialist, to 
learn the subject or to develop a love for our field. To come down to 
specificsl The reader should at least have graduate level; this be- 
cause we expect him to have a genuine interest in this topic and to 
be capable of developing mathematical maturity. Therefore, we have 
tried to make this book as self-contalned as possible; however, to 
keep it down to a reasonable size, we assume that the reader is 
familiar with elementary set theory and with the theory of fields. 
On the other hand we would like the book to serve as a reference for 
the specialist. In this respect, the need for it is borne out by the 
fact that, apart from the classical treatment of maximal orders in 
Deuring ~1~ (1935), and a rather specialized chapter in Curtis-Reiner 
[11 (1962), there are neither lecture notes nor books available on the 
subject. Finally, the wealth of open problems, with which the theory 
of modules over orders still abounds, should inspire and encourage 
the research mathematician° 
As can be seen from the table of contents, we have tried to use 
modern tools, whenever possible, and to put some stress on progenera- 
tors and separabilityl 
in particular, for maximal orders we treat 
systematically the approach introduced by Auslander-Goldman ClS (1960). 
Moreover, we have also enclosed the beautiful papers of Hasse ~2 
(1931) and Chevalley ~1~ (1936), which occasionally seem to have been 
neglected. 
S1~ma s~mmarum we have attempted to give a self-contained treatment 
of the theory of lattices over orders, that leads up to and includes 
the most recent developments° 
For the presentation of the - in our 
opinion - most important and fruitful results we have introduced as 
much preliminary material as necessary for their proofs. We have also 
included exercises at the end of every section~ some concern results 
in their own right and are sometimes referred to in the text.

Introduction 
The theory of orders and the study of modules over orders have three 
main sourcess 
(i) Ideal theory and arithmetic can be developed in maximal orders 
as in Dedekind domains (Cfo Ch. IV). From this point of view, the 
study of maximal orders can be considered as non-commutative number 
theory° 
(ii) Orders and ideals in orders have been introduced by H. Brandt 
~1],t2] in his studies of quadratic forms (this Justifies the name 
"orders" for the algebraic systems under consideration). 
(ili} Orders and modules over orders generalize the theory of inte- 
gral representations of finite groups° 
These notes have been written under the third aspect, and we shall 
have a closer look at this last development. The theory of group re- 
presentations has its origin in the study of permutation groups and 
m~trix algebras. In the years 1896-1899, Go Frobenius tl],~2~ intro- 
duced the concept of a group representation and of the character of a 
representation. During the years 1900-1911, the theory of represen- 
tations over the field of complex numbers ~ was brought to a climax 
by W. Burnside, G. Frobenius and I. Schur (Burnside [13,[2],~3]! 
Frobenius [ 3~-[7~| Frobenius-Schur t i] ,[2~ s Schur [ 1]-[~). In 1911 
W. Burnside published the second edition of his book on group theory 
[~, with a systematic treatment of the representations of finite 
groups. There he obtained group theoretic results, using represen- 
tation theory, some of which - even today - cannot be proved by purely 
group theolmtic means. As a matter of fact, modern group theory seems 
to be impossible without representation theory (cf. e.g. Feit-Thomp- 
son [ 1], Feit [11). For a llst of results in group theory obtained 
with the help of representation theory we refer to Boerner ~ 2],ppo 
60-66. 

VIII 
For a commutative rlng we denote by GL(n,S) the general linear group 
of invertlble (n.n)-matrices over S. A representation o_~fdegree n o_!f 
the finite group G wlth coefficients l_~n S Is a realization of G as a 
group of (nxn)-matrices over S! i.e., one passes from an abstract 
group G to a concrete group of matrices. To be more precise: A repre- 
sentatlon 
o_f degree n o__f G i_n_n S Is a multipllcatlve homomorphism 
(G is written multlplicatively) 
, G ---~ GL (n,S). 
Two representations of G, ~ and ~', both of degree n, are sald to be 
S-gqulvalent, notation ~ ' ,  
If there exists U= &GL(n,S) such that 
~(g)~ = ~'(g), 
for every g & G. 
A representation ~ of G is called reducible, if 
( j 
t 
where ~1 and ~2 are representations of G, ~I,~2 # 0o 
Is said to decompose if 
, 
for representations ~1,~2 # O. 
The main problems that arise immediately arel 
(1) The classification - up to equivalence - of all irreducible 
representations. 
(ii) The classification - up to equivalence - of all Indecomposable 
representationso 
(iii) The structure problem, How Is an arbitrary representation 
built from the Indecomposable ones and from the irreducible ones? 
None of these questions has been answered satisfactorily, except In 
the very special case where S = K is a field, the characteristic of 
which does not divide the order of G. The results in this direction 

IX 
have essentially been obtained by Burnside, Frobenius, Maschke and 
Schurl 
Theorem 11 
Every representation of G in a field K, the characte- 
ristic of which does not divide the order of G, decomposes uniquely 
- 
up to equivalence - into irreducible representations. The number 
of non-equivalent irreducible representations is finite. 
It was Noether's genius that gave new inspiration to the theory of 
representations of finite groups, when in her lectures at G~ttingen 
1927/28 (Cfo Noether t 13), she brought the theory of representations 
of finite groups into connection with the theory of finite dimensio- 
nal algebras over fields, a step that stimulated not only the theory 
of representations of finite groups, but also the theory of semi- 
simple algebras. Her idea was as follows (not quite in this genera- 
lity), 
If S is a commutative ring, we may form the group algebra SG of the 
finite group G, where SG = ~gt~--G SggS s a St with componentwise 
g 
addition and multiplication induced by the multiplication in G. The 
following basic theorem provides the link between the concrete theory 
of matrix representations and the more abstract theory of the so- 
called representation modules. 
Theorem 2, There is a one-to-one correspondence between the non-equi- 
valent representations of G in S of degree n and the non-isomorphic 
left SG-modules which, as S-modules, are free on n elements, the so- 
called representation modules. Indecomposable representations corres- 
pond to left SG-modules which cannot be decomposed into a direct sum 
of proper submodules, each of which is S-free. Irreducible represen- 
tations correspond to left SG-modules with an S-basis of n elements, 
which do not have SG-submodules with an S-basis of m n-1 elements. 

X 
To be more explicit, let T' G-~GL(n,S) be a representation of G of 
degree n in S. A free S-module V with a fixed basis (Vi~l~i~ n is made 
into an SG-representation module V?~defining for g a G 
n 
( 
(g) 
l~l_~n, 
g'vi = ~(g)vi = ~J=l 
~ 
)jivj ' 
and then extending thls action S-11nearly. 
Conversely, given a left SG-module, which is S-free on n elements, we 
fix an S-basls (v~ lei_~n. For g ~G we have 
n 
g'vi = ~-J=l sji(g)vj' l~i-~n' sji £ S, 
and the module properties of V imply that 
, gl 
. (slj(g)) 
is a representation ?i G 
~ GL(n,S). Equivalence of representations 
corresponds to SG-isomorphy of representation modules. 
In 1908 Wedderburn proved his structure theorem for seml-simple alge- 
bras of finite dimension over a field Ki i.e., for finite dimensional 
K-algebras, for which every indeoomposable module is simple. If the 
characteristic of K does not divide the order of the group G, then 
KG is a seml-simple finite dimensional K-algebra, and all the above 
problems have completely satisfactory answers, as already stated in 
Theorem 1. 
However, the natural question arisesl What happens if the characteris- 
tic of K divides the order of G? In this sltuatlon one talks 
about 
the so-called medula~ representations! the theory of modular repre- 
sentations has been developed mainly by R. Brauer ~1]-[5], and for 
the study of modular representations we refer the reader to Curtis- 
Heiner E1],Ch.XII. In the modular case, KG is a so-called Frobenius- 
algebra, and it is no longer semi-slmple! there exist indecomposable 
reducible KG-representation modules. Still, the question (i) on the 
irreducible modules is partially answered, since the simple left 
KG-medules are precisely the simple left~G/rad KG)-modules, where 

XI 
tad KG is the Jacobson radical and KG/rad KG is semi-simple. By 
Wedderburn's theorem, the number of irreducible KG-modules Is finite! 
but an explicit description of all irreducible representation modules 
seems to be unknown except in some special cases (cf. Berman [4~). 
The problem (ii) on the indecomposable KG-representation modules has 
partially been solved by D. G. Higmanl 
Theorem ~ (Higman [i], Kasch-Kneser-Kupisch [13, Berman [4~)s Let 
G be a finite group and K a field of characteristic p> 0. If the 
p-Sylow-subgroups of G are cyclic, then there are at most ~G~ non- 
equivalent indeoomposable representations of G in K. If G has a non- 
cyclic p-Sylow-subgroup, then G has indecomposable representations 
of arbitran~ large degree. 
But here too, an explicit description of the indecomposable modules 
seems to be unknown in general (cf. Berman [ 4~). Since the Krull- 
Schmidt theorem is valid for left KG-modules, every KG-module has 
a unique decomposition into indecomposables~ and by the Jordan-H~ider 
theorem, the composition factors of every KG-representation module 
are unique - up to isomorphism. 
Digressing now from group representations we find it worthwhile 
to mention some recent results on the number of non-isomorphic mo- 
dules over finite dimensional - not necessarily semi-simple - 
algebras. 
Theorem 4 (Curtis-Jans [13)I Let K be an algebraically closed field 
and A a finite dimensional K-algebra. If the socle of every inde- 
composable A-module M (i.e., the sum of the simple A-submodules of 
M) contains each simple A-module with multiplicity at most one. 
then the number of non-isomorphic indecomposable left A-modules is 
finite. 
We would llke to mention here a result of Roiter which proves a 
conjecture of Brauer. 

XII 
Theorem ~ (Rolter [ 7])s Let K be a field and A a finite dimensional 
K-algebra. If A has infinitely many non-isomorphlc Indecomposable 
left modules, then it has indecomposable representations of arbl- 
trar~hlgh degree. 
In 1940 F. E. Diederichsen [ 1] considered for the first tlme syste- 
matically the so-called integral representations of a finite group G! 
ice., multiplicative homomorphisms 
, G ---- GL(n,Z), 
where Z is the ring of rational integers. Already in this first 
approach, he encountered some difficulties. 
We have a natural injection 
L, GL(n,Z) 
~ GL(n,Q), 
where ~ Is the field of rational numbers, and thus we may associate 
with every integral representation 
, G 
= GL(n,~) 
the ~-representation L~ o As was already known to Diederichsen, 
Q-equivalence does not imply Z-equivalence, and a Z-representation 
can be indecomposable, though reducible. Moreover, the Jordan-Prdlder 
theorem is no longer applicable to Z-representatlons! i.e., the 
"irreducible parts"of a Z-representation need not be unique. Nor need 
the'indecomposable parts"of a Z-representation be unique8 examples 
have been constructed that have non-isomorphic indecomposable direct 
decompositions! i.e., there Is no~Erull-Schmidt theorem" for integral 
representations. 
However, there are also some encouraging results, 
Theorem 6, (I) Given a representation 
~' , G 
~ Gn(n,~), 
then there exists an integral representation 
, G 
-GL(n,Z) 

ZIII 
such that ?' ~_ ~?. 
(ii) An integral representation ? is irreducible if and only if L? 
is irreducible. 
Using this and the Jordan-Zassenhaus theorem (cf. Zassenhaus tlS), 
which states that the number of non-equivalent Z-representations, 
that are Q-equivalent, is finite, one finds that the number of non- 
equivalent irreducible integral representations is finite| again 
there is little information on a concrete realization of the irre- 
ducible integral representations. As to the question on indecompo- 
sable representations l Diederichsen had already shown in 19~0 that 
the number of non-equivalent integral representations of G is finite 
@k 
if G is cyclic of order p, ~There p is~ratlonal prime number° However, 
the general problem on the finiteness of the number of non-equivalent 
indecomposable Z-representations has been solved by Ao Jones in 
1962, E 11, combining the results of Heller-Reiner t 11-~4B and his 
O~o 
Theorem 71 The number of non-equivalent indecomposable integral re- 
presentations of the finite group G is finite if and only if, for 
every rational prime number p dividing |GI, the p-Sylow-subgroups 
are cyclic of order ~ p2o 
In the proof of this theorem essentially all indecomposable repre- 
sentations are constructed, if the number is finite. Recently, 
Lo Ao Nazarova C31 has tried to llst all classes of inequivalent 
indecomposable representations, even if this number i~ infinite. 
The structure problem is affected very much by the fact that the 
Krull-Schmidt theorem is not applicable. 
A further extension of the concept of a representation was imminents 
let K be an algebraic number field and R the ring of integers in K! 
then R is a Dedekind domain with quotient field K, and one has 

XIV 
"integral representations" 
, G 
~ GL(n,R). 
In an obvious way equivalence, reducibility and decomposability can 
be defined. However, since R is in general not a principal ideal 
domain, both points of Theorem 4 break down for these generalized 
integral representations, since there are not enough of them. In 
fact, as it turns out, what is missing -- In terms of modules -- 
are exactly those R-projective RG-modules of finite type, that are 
not R-free. However, since Theorem 4 had rendered itself so useful 
in the theory of Z-representations, a broader definition of a repre- 
senta~n of G over R was required. Naturally, this definition had to 
coincide with the old one in case R was a principal ideal domain. In 
particular, many problems in the theory of Z-representatlons are 
solved by "localization". So, the new modules should at least loca- 
lize suitably, and from this point of view, the proper generalization 
of the concept of an integral representation over R such that (~) 
remains vmlld, is the following~ 
Deflnitlona A representation module of RG is a left RG-module, which 
is at the same time an R-lattice! i.e., an R-projective RG-module of 
finite type. 
With this definition, (4) remains valid with the appropriate changes, 
and we call such a representation module an RG-lattic@. 
One further generalization now leads to the theory of orders~ RG is 
a subring of the seml-simple K-algebra KG, and in many proofs in the 
theory of RG-lattlces. it is necessary to consider subrlngs A of KG, 
which have properties similar to those of RG relative to KG. Thence 
we arrive at the category of R-orders which contains the category 
of group rings over R, Just as the category of seml-simple K-alge- 
bras contains the category of group algebras over Ks 

XV 
Definition~ Let A be a semi-simple K-algebra and A a subring of A 
with the same identity as A. Then A is called an Rrorder in A, if 
(i) KA = A 
(ii) A is a finitely generated R-module. 
It is easily seen, that in case A = KG, A= RG is an R-order in A. 
Instead of studying RG-lattices, we shall study A-lattices. The 
theory of ~-lattices has been developed extensively in the years 
1950 ff. However, one class of R-orders, the maximal R-orders have 
already been explored in the years 1930-1940 (cf. Brandt E 2~, 
Chevalley LI~, Deuring tl~, Eichler [11-~4~, Hasse t11-~3~, 
Zassenhaus t 1~) and recently) many of these results have been unified 
and brought up to date by Auslander-Goldman [11. 
These notes are dedicated to the study of lattices over ordersr but 
instead of taking R to be the ring of algebraic integers in an al- 
gebraic number field, we choose R to be any Dedekind domain with 
quotient field K. In this case, one has to require A to be a sepa- 
rable K-algebra so as to ensure the existence of maximal orders. We 
give next a brief and informal sketch of the contents of this book, 
stressing what we consider to be some of its highlights. 
The structure of maximal orders in separable algebras -- these play 
a dominant rSle in our approach to lattices over orders -- is clari- 
fied in Ch. IV. Here, the structure problem can be settled locally 
because of the local vmlidity of the Krull-Schmidt theorem~ however, 
globally~ no satisfactory answer can be expected, since maximal 
orders are in general not Dedekind domains but only Dedekind rings. 
While for Dedekind domains the cancellation law for direct slmmands 
holds, this need not be true even for maximal orders. Jacobinski's 
cancellation theorem (cf. below) gives a complete answer to the 
cancellation problem in general. Decomposability and irreducibility 

XVI 
coincide for maximal orders, since for such orders every lattice is 
a projective module, and an answer to the question on the number of 
irreducibles depends on the theory of genera! i.e., on problems be- 
tween global and local equivalence. To be more specific, let M and N 
be lattices! then M and N are said to lie in the same genus if M and 
N are locally isomorphic! i.e., if M 
~ N 
for all prime ideals 
P 
P 
p in R. The theory of genera (Ch. VII, VIII) is a purely arithmetic 
one. Because of this, we have given two approaches to maximal orders 
in separable algebrasl a more structural one, combining generators, 
progenerators and Morlta equivalences (Cho III) with homological 
algebra (Ch. II), and, in Ch. IV, the approach of H~sse [1], using 
arithmetic in topologically complete algebras. 
Thus, Chapters I-III, though of interest in themselves, contain only 
introductory material! in Ch. I we give a brief introduction to mo- 
dules over rings, in particular over Dedekind domains. This section 
is tailored especially to fit our purposes, and we have included it 
since -- except for 12 volumes of Bourbaki -- there is no textbook 
available where this material can be found in unified form. Ch. II 
is a short introduction to the homological tools used extensively 
for maximal orders and in dealing with decomposability over commu- 
tative orders. The main purpose there is to prove the equivalence 
between Ext'(-,-) as defined by projective resolutions and Ext,(-,-) 
as defined in terms of short exact sequences. In Chapter III, the 
Morita theorems are derived and, later, applied to clarify the struc- 
ture of separable algebras. 
We turn now to the problems for an arbitrary R-order A in the semi- 
simple K-~tgebra A, where R is the ring of integers in the algebraic 
number field K. 
In Chapter V the Higman ideal and related ideals are treated - all 

these ideals play an important r~le in the theory of genera. The 
Jordan-Zassenhaus theorem guarantees that there are only finitely 
many non-isomorphic irreducible A-lattices. In case A is split by K, 
the number of genera of irreducible A-lattices is equal to the pro- 
duct of the number of maximal R-orders containing 
A and the number 
of simple components of AI each genus contains h isomorphism classes, 
where h is the ideal class number of K, (Ch. Vl~. 
A necessary and sufficient condition for ~ to have only finitely 
many non-isomorphic indecomposable lattices is not yet known except 
for some special types of algebras° In this realm, the two most re- 
markable results to date are the followings Drozd-Roiter ~IB, Dade~ 
Jacobinski ~2~ 
Gudivok [ 1], Heller-Reiner [ ~]^and Jones C1] have settled the pro- 
blem for group algebras by showing that the number of indecomposable 
RG-lattices is finite if and only if the group G has a very special 
metacyclic structure, namely~ If for a rational prime p dividing the 
ej 
TW 
order of G, pR =If j Pj 
is the prime decomposition of the ideal pR, 
e(p) = maxj(ej) and Gp denotes a p-Sylow group of G, then either Gp 
is cyclic of order p2 and e(p) = 1, or Gp is cyclic of order p and 
either e(p) ~ 2 or p ~ 3 and e(p) = 3. In this case the indecompo- 
sable RG-lattices have been constructed explicitly, though laborious- 
ly. Recently Nazarova (cfo E 3]) has tried to classify the indecom- 
posable RG-lattices even in case their number is infinite° 
For a commutative algebra A the solution has been given independent- 
ly by Drozd-Roiter [iB and Jacobinski [ 2Bi In this case, there is 
exactly one maximal R-order ~ in A containing ~, and the conditions 
of Drozd-Roiter aret A has finitely many non-isomorphic indecompo- 
sable lattices if and only if A has at most index two in ~ (as abe- 
lian groups) and ~/A/rad(~/A) is a cyclic A-module, where rad(~/A) is 
the intersection of the maximal A-submodules of ~/Ao The approach of 

Z~III 
Drozd-Roiter seems to lend itself to generalization and some prelimi- 
nary results have already been obtained (cf. Roggenkamp [8],~9]). 
In view of this theorem, the following results seem quite surprising, 
(i) For any R-order A in A, there are only finitely many non-lsomor- 
phic indecomposable projective lattices (Jacoblnski [4S, Jones ~1]), 
(Ch.V ~ ). 
(ii) The number of non-lsomorphic lattices in the genus of a lattice 
M ms bounded, by the Jordan-Zassenhaus theorem, but, what is more, 
this bound is independent of M| i.e., it ms an invariant of A, 
(Jacobinskl [3], Rolter [ 2]), (Ch. VII). 
The structure problem is very hard to handle because of the lack of 
A 
= 
of A, 
a Krull-Schmidt type theorem. For the p-adic completion Ap 
p a prime ideal in R, the Krull-Schmldt theorem is valid for latti- 
ces (Relner [ 6],[3]! Borevich-Faddev [11~ Swan [2~), and the pro- 
blem is trivial -- this stresses also the importance of the theory 
of genera. For the localization, the Krull-Schmidt theorem is, in 
general, not valid for lattices, but cancellation is still admissible! 
i.e., M @ N ~ M' @ N 
~ M ~ M'. In the global case, this cancella- 
tion law fails. However, Jacobinski [4] has given a condition on A 
under which cancellation can be applied to some modules, 
If no simple component of A is a totally definite quaternlon algebra, 
then for A-lattlces M, M', N, such that N is a direct s,,mmand of 
M (n), the direct sum of n copies of M, %&e 
M @ N ~ M' @ N 
~ M ~ M', 
In totally definite quaternion algebras, however, cancellation is 
not even possible for lattices over maximal orders (of. Swan ~ 4]), 
(Ch. VII). 
The arithmetical background for Jacoblnski's cancellation law is 
based on some deep results of Eichler [3]. Once these are established, 

XIX 
the results follow elegantly from an exact sequence of Grothendieck 
groups in algebraic K-theory. 
As already mentioned in the preface, the path to these deep results 
must lead through much of the development of the theory of integral 
representations, from the late twenties to the present. As to the 
present, we shall develop as much of K-theory as is needed and de- 
vote a chapter to Grothendieck groups. Here, much will be based on 
the works of Bass, Heller, Reiner and Swan. 
Though we have attempted to prove, as much as possible, there are 
still some deep results from algebraic number theory which we quote 
without proof. 
As stated at the beginning, this introduction has been written under 
the aspect of orders as generalization of group rings. 
We shall 
treat integral representations of finite groups only as examples; and 
thus, much of this beautiful theory will not be presented here. 

CHAPTER I 
PRELIMINARIES ON RINGS AND MODULES 
§i. 
Modules and homomor~hisms 
In this section the basic definitions and properties of 
modules and homomorphlsms are given. 
Homomorphlsms are 
written opposite to the scalars. 
Products and coproducts 
are defined. 
I.I 
Definitions: 
A rln~ 
R 
is a set 
R 
with two internal laws of 
composition, 
"+" 
and 
".", 
such that 
(R,+) 
is an abelian group,and 
(R,.) 
is an associative structure, which is two-slded distributive 
with respect to 
"+". 
In the future we shall always assume, that all 
rlngs under consideration possess a unit element, l; i.e., a neutral 
element with respect to 
".". 
A left 
R-module 
M 
is a set with an 
internal law 
"+" 
such that 
(M,+) 
is an abelian group, and with an 
external law 
R x M--> 
M ~ (r,m) ~---> rm, 
which satisfies the fol- 
lowing conditions 
1.2 
r(m+m') = rm+rm', r ~ R, m,m' ~ M, 
(r+r')m = rm+r'm, r,r' ¢ R, m ¢ M, 
(rr')m 
= r(rlm), r,r' ~ R, m ¢ M, 
im 
= m, 
m ~ M. 
(The last condition is sometimes expressed by saying, that 
M 
is a 
unitar~ 
R-module.) 
If the condition (1.2) is replaced by 
(rr')m = 
r'(rm), 
one says that 
M 
is a right 
R-module, and we generally 
write the operators, 
r ¢ R, 
on the right. 
By 
R~ 
we denote the 
class of left R-modules, and by 
M R 
the class of right 
R-modules. 
Let 
N 
be a subgroup of 
(M,+), 
where 
M ¢ R~" 
If 
N 
is also a 
left 
R-module, then 
N 
is called a submodule of the left 
R-module 

2 
1 2 
M. 
If 
N 
is a submodule of the left 
R-module 
M, 
we can make the 
factor group 
(M/N,+) 
into a left 
R-module, be defining 
r(m+N) = 
rm+N, r c R, m ~ M. 
The factor group 
(M/N,+) 
with this structure 
is called the factor module of 
M 
with respect to 
N, 
and it is 
denoted by 
M/N. 
The opposite rin~ 
R °p 
of 
R 
is the set 
R 
with 
an additive structure 
,,+op,,, x +op y = x + y 
and a multiplicatlve 
structure 
,,.op,, 
op 
, x • 
y = yx. 
These definitions make 
R °p 
into a 
ring. 
1.3 
Remark: 
M 
is a left 
R-module if and only if 
M 
is a right 
R°P-module. 
Let 
R 
and 
R' 
be rings. 
A (unitary) rin~-homomorphism from 
R 
to 
R' 
is a map 
~:R--> 
R', 
which is multiplicative and additive (and 
satisfies 
~(1) = 1). 
Then the external law of composition 
R × R' --> R', (r,r') ~--> ~(r)r', r ¢ R, r' ¢ R' 
(resp. 
R' X R--> 
R', (r',r) ~--> r'~(r), ~ ¢ R, r' ¢ R') 
makes 
R' 
into a 
left (resp. right) 
R-module; every 
M ¢ R,M 
becomes a left 
R- 
module, if we define 
rm = ~(r)m, r ¢ R, m E M. 
If 
~ 
is the iden- 
tity homomorphism on 
R, 
then 
R 
becomes a left (resp. right) 
R- 
module, denoted by 
R R 
(resp. 
RR) , 
the regular 
R-module. 
The 
submodules of 
R E 
(resp. 
RR) 
are called the left (resp. right) 
ideals of 
R. 
If 
M,N ~ R M 
then an 
R-homomorphism from 
M 
to 
N 
is an additive map 
~:M--> 
N, 
such that 
(rm)~ = r(m~), r ¢ R, 
m c M. 
We define the image of 
~, Im~ = In ¢ N:n = m~ 
for some 
m ¢ M] ¢ R M, the kernel of 
~, Ker~ = [m ¢ M:m~ = O] ~ R M 
and the 
cokernel of 
~, 
Coker~ = N/Im~ c RM. 
One says that 
~ 
is an 
R__z- 
epimorphism, if 
Im~ = N 
and an 
R-monomorphism if 
Ker $ = (0). 
An 
R-epimorphism which is at the same time an 
R-monomorphism is 
called an 
R-isomorphism. 

I 3 
3 
1.4 
Remark: 
We always write module-homomorphisms opposite of the 
operators. 
If R 
is commutative we write the homomorphisms on the 
left, unless otherwise stated. 
If M,N e R~' 
we write 
HomR(M~N ) for the set of 
R-homomorphlsms 
from M 
to N. 
Then HomR(M,N ) 
is an abellan group, if we define 
+ @:M--> N, (m)(~+@) = (m)~ + (m)@; ~,@ ¢ HomR(M,N ). 
If M = N, 
then HomR(M,M ) is also a ring, 
EndR(M) , under 
~:M--> 
M 
(m)(~@) = ((m)@)W; $,@ g EndR(M ). 
Moreover, 
M 
is a right 
EndR(M )- 
module. 
In addition, the structure of M 
as left 
R-module and the 
structure of M 
as right 
EndR(M)-module are linked by the formula 
1.5 
(rm)9 = r(m~), r c R, m ¢ M, ~ e EndR(M ). 
In this connection one says that 
M 
is an 
(R, EndR(M)~bimodule. 
If 
R,S 
are two rings, we denote by 
R~S 
the class of 
(R,S)-bimodules. 
If M, M', M" e R~' 
we have a law of composition 
1.6 
HomR(M,M' ) x HomR(M',M" ) --> HomR(M,M"~($,W ) ~--> a 
where 
m~ = (m~)@, m ~ M; 
is called the composite of $ 
and 
~. 
This law is two-sided 
distributive and~whenever the composite of three homomorphlsms is 
defined, it is associative. 
1.7 
Proposition: 
Let 
M e R~; 
then HomR(RR, M ) ¢ R~ and one has 
an isomorphism 
®M:HOmR(RR, M) --> M, 
~M: 
~ 
~--> (1)~ 
of left 
R-modules. 
Moreover, 
$~ is a natural homom0rphSsm; i.e., 
if 
~ e HomR(M,M'), M' e RE' 
then the following diagram 

4 
1 4 
M 
~ 
> M' 
, 
r,[_ 
HomR(RR, M) 2-*-> HomR(RR, M, ) 
can be completed in one and only one way to a commutative diagram; 
.) 
i.e., 
OM~ = ~*#M'" 
Thus, we obtain an isomorphism of T~ -modules 
~:HOmR(M,M. ) ~---> HomR(HOmB(RR, M), HomR(RR, M')) 
~--> 
o., 
where 
(r)~. = ((r)~)~, 
for 
r e R, $ c HomR(RR, M ). 
The proof is straight forward and is left as an exercise. 
1.8 
Definitions: 
Let 
M ¢ R~' 
and 
[Ni)iE I 
a family of submodules 
of M. 
Then 
N = igI Ni 
is an 
R-module in the obvious way, called 
the intersection of the family 
[Ni]ic I. 
If now 
S 
is a subset of 
M, 
then the intersection of all the submodules of M 
containing 
S 
is called the submodule of M, 
~enerated by 
S, 
and one says that 
S 
is a set of generators for N. 
If M c R~ 
has a finite set of 
generators, one says that 
M 
is a finitely ~enerated 
R-module, or 
an R-module of finite type. 
By 
RM f 
(resp. 
M~, 
resp. 
RM~) 
we 
denote the class of left 
R-modules (resp. right 
R-modules, resp. 
(R,S)-blmodules) of finite type. 
It is easily checked, that the sub- 
module 
N 
of a left 
R-module 
M, 
generated by the family 
[mi]i¢i, 
is the set of finite linear combination of the elements 
m i with 
(left) coefficients in R. 
Let 
[Mi]i¢ I 
be a family of submodules 
of M ~ R~" 
The sum of the Mi, Z iciMi , 
is the submodmle of M 
generated by the union of the Mi, i ¢ I. 
Let 
[Mi]l<i< n 
be a 
finite family of left 
R-modules; the (external) direct sum of the

m i e M i] 
with componentwlse addition and 
r(ml ' ...,mn ) def. 
(rml,...,rmn) 
,_ 
r e R, (ml,...,mn) ¢ X. 
If 
{Mi]l_<i_< 
n 
is a finite 
n 
family of submodules of the left 
R-module 
M, 
then ~> 
M i 
is 
i=l 
n 
said to be the (internal) direct sum of the Mi' ~i=l Mi 
(we use 
the same notation for external and internal direct sums, since, in 
n 
general, no confusion can arise), if the map ~ ni=l Mi -->, )' 
n

(ml, ...,mn) ~--> f

is an 
R-isomorphism. 
Let

[Ml]l<i< n 
be two families of left 
R-modules, and let 
@i ¢ H°mR(Mi'Ni)' 1 _< i < n, 
morphism

and 
be given. 
Then we define an

Mi __> ~ n 
Ni 
i=l ~i : ~ i=l 
i=l

~i=l @i:(ml "''''mn) W--> (ml~ 1,...,mnSn).

Ker(@ni=l ~i ) = @ ni=l Ker ~i 
and

1.9 
Lemma: 
Let 
M ¢ R M, 
and 
{Mi]l<i_<n 
a family of submodules of 
M. 
Then the following conditions are equivalent:

Definition: 
M E R~ f 
is said to be a free left 
R-module with 
a basis of n 
elements, if there exists an R-isomorphism 
@:M--> R R @ R R • ... @ R R = 
(RR) (n), 
where the sum consists of n 
copies of

The elements 
e i = (0,...,O,1,0,...,O)@-l,1 ~ i ~ n, 
where 
1 
is at the 
i-th position, are called basis elements of M. 
Then every element in M 
can be expressed uniquely as a linear 
combination of the

with coefficients in R 
(cf. (1.9)).

§2. 
Exact. ,sequences 
It is shown that 
HomR(-,N ) 
is left exact and contra- 
variant, 
HomR(M,- ) 
is left exact and covariant, both 
are additive. 
Some properties of projective modules and 
dual modules are deTived. 
2.1 
Definition: 
Let 
R 
be a ring, 
M,,M,M" e R M. 
and 
~¢HOmR(M,,M) , ~cHOmR(M,M" ) . Then the sequence 
M, ~ > M ~ > M" 
is said to be exact, if 
Im ~ = Ker 9. 
The sequence 
0--> M, -.~ > M 
is exact if and only if 
9 
is an R-monomorphism. 
The sequence 
M -~ > M" 
> 0 
is exact if and only if 
# 
is an 
R-epimorphism. 
2.2 
Remark: 
If 
0 ~> Mf ~ > M -~--> M" --> 0 
is an exact sequence of left R-modules and R-homomorphisms, then 
it follows from the first homomorphism theorem (one proves as for 
abelian groups: 
if 
a: M --> N 
is an R-homomorphism between left 
R-modules, then 
M/Ker G ~ Im a 
as left R-modules), that 
M/Ira ~ ~ M". 
Conversely, if 
N 
is a submodule of the left R- 
module 
M, then the sequence 
0 --> N 
~ > M 
A > M/N --> O 
is exact, where 
K: N--> 
M, 
K: n ~--> n, n 6N 
and 
A: M--> 
M/N, 
A : m ~---> m+N, 
mcM, 
are the canonical homomorphisms. 
The exact sequence 
E: 0 --> M' _9__> M 
~ > M" --> 0 

10 
I i0 
of left R-modules Is said to be 9plit exact (or simply, it splits), 
If there exists 
G ¢ HomR(M",M ) such that 
a@ = IM,,. 
In this 
case 
g 
is necessarily an R-monomorphism and 
M = Im @ + Im ~. 
If 
x ¢Im @ f-~Im a, 
then 
x@ = 0 
and, since 
a 
is a monomorphlsm, 
x = O; 
hence 
M = Im @ • Im ~ by (1.8). 
Moreover, 
@ 
and 
a 
are 
both monomorphisms; hence 
M ~ M' • M". 
We leave it as an exercise 
to show that the exact sequence 
E 
splits if and only if there 
exists 
• • HomR(M,M, ) 
such that 
@x = IM,- 
2.3 
Proposition: 
Let 
0 --> Mt 
~ > M 
~ > M" m> 
0 
be an exact sequence of left R-modules and R-homomorphlsms. 
If 
M,,M" 
are of finite type, so is 
M. 
(The converse of thls state- 
ment is not necessarily true; however, if 
M c R=M f, 
then 
M" • R=_Mf). 
Proof: 
Let 
S, 
and 
S" respectively be 
finite system~of gen- 
erators for 
M, 
and 
M" 
respectively. 
If 
T 
is a finite subset 
of 
M 
such that 
T~ = S"(T@ = ItS: t e T)), 
then 
S = S,~ L-)T 
is a finite system of generators for 
M. 
In fact, the submodule 
M o 
of 
M, generated by 
S 
contains 
M,~; 
and since 
S@ = S", 
Mo@ = M". 
Hence 
M o = M. 
#

N n

Hence the above sequence is 
exact by (2.2), 
since

where 
M",N" e R__M and 
¢ HomR(M, M),@v ¢ HomR(M",M), @ ¢ HomR(N,N,), @v e HomR(N.,N"). 
The verification of these identities is left as an exercise. 
We remark shortly, what happens to right modules: 
Let 
M, MV ,N,N v g =M 
R 
then, 
hom: HomR(Mf ,M) × HomR(N,N' ) --> HOmz(HomR(M,N),HOmR(M' ,N' ) )

where for a

The operation -* "reverses arrows"; i.e.,

we write the homomorphlsms on the left

(1.4)). 
is commutative, 
Proof: 
Let the sequence (i) be exact. 
To prove, that (ll) is 
exact, it suffices to show, that (il) is exact at 
HomR(M,N ). 
In 
fact, the exactness of (ii) at 
HomR(M",N ) follows by applying 
the result to 
M, ~ > M" --> 0--> O. 
We have ~*~* = hom(T, iN) hom(~,iN) = hom(T~,iN) 
= hom(0,1N) = 0. 
Thus 
Im ~*C Ker ~*. 
Now, let 
~ c HomR(M,N), 
such that 
~*(o) = O, 
then 
~ 
= 0 
and so 
(Ker ~)o = O. 
Hence we can 
complete the following diagram commutatlvely (cf. Exercise (2.5)), 
since 
Ker @ C Ker a and)since 
~ 
is an epimorphlsm: 
D: 
M 
o 
>N 
/ 
/ 
or 
/ 
M" 
Thus;from the commutativlty of 
D, we obtain 
~o 
-- o; i.e., 
~*(o,) = G and 
Ker ~*C Im $*.

Conversgl[, let the sequence (ii) be exact for every 
N • R=M. To show that @ 
is epic, let 
N = M"/Im $ and let 
a: M" --> M"/Im ~ 
the canonical homomorphlsm. 
Then @*(o) = ~o = O. 
Since @* 
is monlc, 
o = O. 
To show exactness at M, we observe 
that ~*~* = O; 
hence, in particular, for 
N = M , p = 1M , we 
have 
~*~*(p) = ~@l M 
= ~ 
= O; i.e., 
Im ~ C Ker 9- 
Conversely, 
let 
o: M-->M/Im 
~ be the canonical homomorphism, and put 
N = M/Im ~ 
in (ii). 
Since ~*(a) = O, there exists 
o' • HomR(M",M/Im ~) 
such that @*(a') = o; 
i.e., 
M

Hence 
Ker @C Ker ~ = Im ~, and the

2.7 
Theorem: 
Let 
NI,N,N" • R M. 
Then the sequence 
0 --> NI ~ > N-9--> N" 
is exact if and only if for every M c R__M the sequence 
0 --> HomR(M,N' ) 
> HomR(M,N ) 
> HomR(M,~' ) is an exact 
sequence of Z-modules. 
Here ~. = hom(iM,~) 
and ~. = hom(iM,@). 
The proof is similar to the one of (2.6) and is left as an 
exercise. 
#

(i) 
The operation -. "preserves arrows"; i.e.,

Proposition: 
For 
P ¢ R Mr= the following conditions are 
equivalent: 
(i) 
For every exact sequence

of left N-modules and homomorphlsms, the sequence 
0 --> HomR(P,M')~

is split (cf. (2.2)). 
(iv) 
There exists a free left R-module 
F 
with a finite basis, 
and a submodule 
X 
of F 
such that 
F ~ X ~ P. 
Proof : 
(1) => 
(il): 
Given the diagram with exact row 
P 
M 
~ >M" 
--> 0 , 
One can complete the bottom sequence to the exact sequence 
0--> Ker @ ___L> M 
@ > M" --> O, 
where 
~: Ker @ --> M is the injection. 
Now (1) implies that 
there exists a ¢ HomR(P,M ) such that 
@.(a) = p; i.e., a~ = p. 
Consequently, 
o completes 
D 
commutatlvely. 
~li) ==> (lli). 
The diagram 
P 
E: 0 ~> M 
~ > M 9 > P --> 0 
can be completed commutatlvely 
by (li). 
Hence 
E 
splits (cf. 
(2.2)). 
.(Ill) ==> (iv). 
Since 
P 
is of finite type, there exists a free 
left R-mdoule 
F 
with a finite basis such that 
P 
is the epl- 
morphlc image of F; i.e., we have an exact sequence 

16 
I 16 
0--> Ker ~ --> F ~ > P --> O, 
which splits by (Ill). 
Hence P is isomorphic to a direct summand 
of F 
(of. (2.2)). 
(iv) --=> (1). We show first that a free left R-module F with 
a finite basis satisfies (1). Because of (2.7) we only have to 
show, that ~, is an eplmorphism. 
We have the following com- 
mutatlve diagram 
HomR(F,M) 
> HomR(F,M") 
,L 
M(n) 
/~(n) 
,(n) 
-- 
> 
--> 0, 
where X (n) stands for the direct sum of n copies of X. Here 
n 
is the number of basis elements of F; F ~ R R(n). 
n 
e 
@ = @(n): M(n) __> M..(n) 
1 
(of. (1.8)), 
T(M): HomR(F,M ) --> M (n) 
is composed of the maps 
¢1 
Hom~(F,M) - 
> 
n 
HomR(RR,M) ¢2 > M(n) 
(cf. (1.7),(1.11), 
1 
(1.12)). 
Then W(M) 
is an isomorphism. 
Similarly one defines the iso- 
morphism T(M"). 
The equations 
¢(M")~.(F)a = ~(M")~ = ((1)~i(F)~)l~i~n, 
(T(M)o)@ (n) 
[((1)Li(F)O)l~i~n]~ (n) = ((1)~i(F)~)l~i~ n 
show, that the above diagram is commutative. 
Since ~(n) 
is an 
epimorphism, so is @.(F); 
here 
~i(F): R i = R --> F 
is the 
i-th injection. 
Now, for P ¢ R=~ we show: 
(iv) ==> (ll). 

1-17 
By (iv) there exists a free left R-module 
F ¢ R=M f, 
F ~= P • X. Given the diagram with an exact row 
such that 
17 
P 
M _9__> M" 
>O. 
We can complete - by the above reasoning - the diagram 
F 
iI ~f 7r 
o, I 
p 
/ 
,L p 
M 
~/ > M" 
> 0 
commutatively; here 
~: F --> P 
is the projection (cf. (i.i0)). 
Now we define 
o: P --> M by 
~ = L~', where 
L: P --> F 
is 
the injection (cf. (1.10)). 
Then 
Lo'~ = L~p = 1pp = p 
(cf. 
(i.i0)); i.e., (ii) is satisfied 3 and (i) follows at once. 
2.10 
Definition: 
A left R-module 
P 
of finite type, which satis- 
fies the equivalent conditions of (2.9) is called a pro~ectiv 9 left 
R-module of finite type. 
By 
R~ f we denote the class of pro- 
~ective left R-modules of finite type. 
(Similarly, 
~.) 
2.11 
Definition: 
The dual of the left R-module 
M 
is defined as 
= Hom 
(M,RR). 
Then 
M* 
is a right R-module under the following action 
m(~r) = (m~)r, 
mcM, ~ ¢ M*, reR. 
Moreover, we have a homomorphism of left R-modules 
6(M): M--> M** 

18 
I 18 
6(M): m~---> mS(M), 
where 
(m6(M))~ = m~, meM, ~ e M*. 
This 
6(M) together with 
6(~) = hom(hom(~,iR),l R) 
for 
e HOmR(M,M') 
is a natural homomorphism (cf. (1.7)). 
We leave 
the verification of the naturallty of 
6 as an exercise. 
2.12 
Lemma: 
Let 
P ¢ R~ f. 
Then 
P* ~ ~, 
and 6(P): P--> p** 
is a natural isomorphism. 
Proof: 
Let 
F be a free left R-module of finite type with a basis 
{el}l~i~ n 
(cf. (1.12)). 
We define elements {e~]l~i_<n ¢ F* by 
i, 
if 
i = J 
(ej)e~ = 
0, 
if 
i ~ J 
Since every 
~ e F* 
is uniquely 
determined by its values 
{(ei)~}l~i~n, 
@ 
has a unique expression 
as 
~ = 
i=lJ 
je r , for some elements 
rj ~ R, 
i _< J N n. 
Hence 
F* 
is a free right R-module with a basis of n 
elements. 
If 
now 
P 
is a projective left R-module of finite type, then there 
exists a free left R-module 
F 
of finite type such that 
F ~ P • X 
(cf. (2.9)). 
But 
F* ~ P* @ X* 
as 
~-modules 
(cf. 
(1.11)); however, since 
F*, P* and 
X* 
are right R-modules, the 
above isomorphism is also an isomorphism of right R-moduleS. 
Moreover, 
F* 
is a free right 
R-module of finite type. 
Thus 
P* 
is a projective right R-module of finite type (cf. (3.9)). 
From the above considerations it is clear, that F** 
is a free 
left R-module on a basis 
(e~*}l~i~n , where 
el** ,t ea , = <i,0, if 
if 
ii ~= JJ 
On the other hand, 
(el)6(F) = e~* 
1 ~ i ~ n. 
Hence 
6(F) 
is an isomorphism. 
Since 
6(M) 
is a 
natural homomorphlsm, we have the following commutative diagram 

I 19 
19 
6(P) 
where 
~: P --> F 
and 
resp. (cf. (1.10)). 
Then 
p 
~ 
>F 
~ 
>p 
p** 
L ** 
~** 
> F** 
=> P** 
r: F --> P 
are the injection and projection 
L** = hom(hom(L,iR),l R) 
T** = hom(hom(r,iR),lR) 
(cf. (2.5)). 
hom(hom(~,iR),IR) hom(hom(~,iR),iR) ) = ~K*" 
= 
hom(hom(L~,iR) ) = hom(hom(ip, iR)) 
= 
ii~ .. 
(It should be observed, that 
HomR(M, RR ) is a right R-module; and 
thus, according to our convention(l.~), homomorphisms are written 
on the right; similarly for 
M**). 
This implies that 
L** 
is a 
monomorphism and v** 
is epic. 
Diagram chasing shows that 
6(P) 
is an isomorphism.

Tensor products

Projective modules are flat. 
The natural map

3.1 
Definition: 
Let 
M ~ MR, N ~a~ , 
and let G be an abelian 
group. 
A map

there exist an abelian group

and an R-balanced map 
: M × N

such that for every R-balanced map 
~ :M x N

there exists a unique Z-homomorphism 
~ : G'

which makes the

commute.

Let 
C be the free 
abeliangroup generated by the symbols 
[(m,n) : m ~ M,n c N], 
and let

C generated by all elements of the follow- 
ing form: 
(m+ml,n) - (m,n) - (m',n), (m,n+n') - (m,n) - (m,n'), 
(mr,n) - (m,rn), 
m,m'~M, n,n'~N, r~R. 
Then the tensor product 
of the right R-modu$1e

M ®R N, 
is the 
Z=-module

For

Theorem: 
The abelian group 
M ®R N 
together with the map 
: M × N

is a solution of the 
universal mapping problem (3.2). 
Moreover, it is, up to

~-isomorphism, the only solution. 
Proof: 
An application of (Ex. 2,3) shOws that

(3.2).

Remark: 
The tensor product of two non-zero modules can be

By

3.11 
Theorem (associativity of the tensor product): Let 
R, S 
be two rings, 
M 
a right R-module, N an (R,S)-blmodule (cf. (i.4)) 
and 
L 
a left S-module. 
Then 
M ®R N e M S 
and N @S L e R~--' and 
there exists a unique Z-homomorphism 
: M%(N%L) 
> (M®RN)%L; 
: m ® 
(n @ 4) L 
> (m ® n) @ 4; 
moreover, 
~ 
is a natural isomorphism. 
Pro.of: One checks easily that the definition 
(m @ n)s = m ® ns, m @ n ~ M ®R N, s e S 
makes 
M ®R N 
into a right S-module. 
Similarly, 
N ®S L becomes a 
left R-module, so that the above expressions make sense. 
The unique- 
ness of the above map, if it exists, is clear, since 
M@R(N®sL) 
is 
generated by the elements 
m @ (n ® 4), m e M, n e N, ~ e L. 
For 
each 4 ¢ L, 
the map 
p~ : N --~N®s L; n ! 
> n ® ~ 
is an R-homo- 
morphism, and the map 
o 4 = 1 M @ pL 
is a Z-homomorphlsm (cf. 3.4). 
The map 
~' • (MeRN) × L 
> M ®R (N®sL); (x,¢) t 
> G4(x) 
is 
R-balanced and thus induces the required Z-homomorphism 
%. Similarly 
a Z-homomorphism 
$ : M @R (NesL) 
"> (M®RN) @S L; (men) ®4 ! > 
m ® (n ® 4), 
is obtained. 
Obviously 
~ 
and

are inverses of 
each other and are both natural.

the sequence 
¢®I N 
M' ®R N ~®~ > M @R N

Proof: 
Since 
(~® 1N)(~® ~) = O, 
we have 
Im(~®~)

Ker(¢®lN). 
Conversely, the R-balanced map ~×N -->(M®RN)/Im(~@IN),

where 
m 
is such that

factors through ~'@R N 
(cf. (3.2)); i.e., we get a Z-homomorphism 
M II

®R N 
>(M ®R N)/~m(~ ® 1N). 
Since Im(~ ® 1N) c Ker(% ® ~), 
we can complete the following

¢®i N

e 
I 
(M ®R N)/~(~ ® h~)'

Lemma: 
Let 
a be a right ideal of 
R and M 
a left 
R-module; let 
=aM be the Z_-submodule of 
M 
generated by the elements 
of the form am, a e ~, m ~ M. 
Then there is a natural Z_-isomorphism 
: ~/=a ®R M

Moreover, if

(R,R)- 
bimodule contained in 
R) 
then $ 
is an isomorphism of left

If, in addition,

Artinian and noetherlan modules 
The theorem of Jordan-H~lder for modules of finite 
length is stated, and the Krull-Schmldt theorem is proved 
for rings 
R, 
for which 
EndR(M) 
is completely primary 
if 
M 
is indecomposable. 
Nakayama's lemma is proved, 
and some properties of the Jacobson radical are derived. 
4.1 
Dgfinltign: 
A left R-module 
M 
is called artinian (resp. 
noetherian) if it satisfies one of the following equivalent con- 
Every non-empty set of submodules of 
M, 
partially ordered 
by inclusion, contains a minimal (resp. maximal) element. 
(li) 
Every descending (resp. ascending) chain of submodules of 
M becomes stationary; i.e., if 
~ ~ ~ D ... m Mi m ... 
iS a descending chain of submodules of 
M, 
then there 
exists a positive integer 
n, 
such that 
~ 
= M 6 
for all 
k,~ >_n. 
4.2 
Lemma: 
Let 
M ¢ ~. 
Then 
M 
is noetherian if and only if 
every submodule of 
M 
is of finite type. 
Proof: 
If M 
is a noetherian left R-module and 
N 
a submodule 
of 
M, 
let 
S be the set of submodules generated by finite subsets 
of 
N. 
By (4.1, (i)) 
S 
contains a maximal element 
N O • For every 
element 
n e N, 
one has 
N O + Rn = No; 
hence 
N = N O , 
and 
N 
is 
finitely generated. 
Conversely. let 
[M i] 
be an ascending chain of 
submodules of 
M. 
Then 
M o = 
~J 
M i 
is a submodule of 
M; 
i=l, 2. • • 
hence of finite type by hypothesis; say, 
M o 
is generated by 
, l<i<n. 
m 1,...,m n. 
Then there exists 
n o , 
such that 
ml ~ ~o 
-- 
-- 
ditions: 
(1) 

SO 
1 30 
Hence the chain 
[~) 
becomes stationary; i.e., 
M 
is noetherian. 
4.3 
Lemm_..__,aa: Let 
M c R M, 
N 
a submodule of M. 
M 
is artinlan 
(resp. noetherian) if and only if N 
and M/N 
are artinian (resp. 
noetherian). 
Proof: 
(1) 
If M 
is artinian (resp. noetherian) so is 
N. 
Let 
~ : M ~> 
M/N be the canonical homomorphism. 
If 
[Mi ) is a 
descending (resp. ascending) chain of submodules of M/N, 
then the 
M i -- [m e M : m~ ¢ Mi ) form a descending (resp. ascending) chain of 
submodules of 
M, 
which becomes stationary by hypothesis; i.e., 
M k = M& 
for k,& >_no . But then also ~ 
= M& 
for k,4 >no . 
Hence 
M/N 
is artinian (resp. noetherian). 
(ii) Conversely, let {Mi~ , Mi6M , be a descending (ascending) chain. 
Set ~i=MiN/N; then {M i} and 
M.mN 
are descending(ascending) chains 
l 
Of submodules of M/N 
and 
N 
resp., which become stationary by hypo- 
thesis. 
Hence there exists 
n O 
such that 
% 
= %0' 
and 
/~ N = Mno~ N 
for every 
k > n O . But then 
~ 
= ~o 
(cf. Ex. 
4,2 ) for every 
k > no, 
and M 
is artinian (resp. noetherian). # 
4.4 
C0rollary: 
A finite direct sum of left R-modules is artin- 
18/I (resp. noetherian) if and only if each summand is artinian (resp. 
noetherian). 
Proof: 
This follows immediately from (4.3). 
# 
4.5 
D.efinltions : A left R-module 
M 
is called a simple R-mo___- 
dule if M 
contains no non-trivlal submodule. 
Let 
M be a left R- 
module. 
A finite descending chain 
0 
is called a composition series for 
M 
of length 
n, 
if the factor 
modules 
~/Mi+ l, 1 & i <_ n, 
are simple R-modules. 
Two composition 
series are said to be egulvalent if they have the same length 
n, and 
if the factors can be paired off in such a way that corresponding 

I 31 
31 
factors are isomorphic. 
M 
is said to nave finite ler~th (length n) 
if M has a composition series (of length n). 
4.6 
Theorem (Jordan-H~der): 
If a left R-module M 
has finite 
length, then any two composition series of M 
are equivalent. 
This is proved as for finite groups. 
# 
4.? Theorem: 
A left R-module 
M 
has finite length if and only 
if M 
is artlnian and noetherian. 
Proof: 
If M 
has finite length, then any two composition series 
of M 
have the same length, say n. 
Hence, every strictly decreasing 
(resp. increasing) chain of submodules has less than n + 1 
terms; 
i.e., 
M 
is artinian (resp. noetherlan). 
Conversely: 
Since M 
is noetherian (cf. (4.3)), among its sub- 
modules, which are different from M, 
there exists a maximal sub- 
module 
N. 
Obviously M/N is simple. 
Applying this procedure recur- 
rently, (cf. (~.3~, we obtain a decreasing sequence 
[~) 
of sub- 
modules of M 
such that 
~/Mi+ 1 
is a s~mple R-module. 
Since M 
is artinian, this sequence becomes stationary; i.e., 
M 
is of finite 
length. 
4.8 Definition: 
A ring 
S 
is called complete~v primary, if 
the non-unlts in 
S 
form a 2-slded ideal (a unit of S is an invert- 
ible element in 
(R,-)). 
In this case the ideal of the non-unlts is 
the unique maximal right and left ideal of 
S. 
A commutative com- 
pletely primary ring is called a local rin~. 
A left R-module is 
decomposable if it is the direct sum of two non-trlvial submodules. 
4.9 
L~. a: 
If M 
is an Indecomposable left R-module of finite 
length, then 
EndR(M) 
is a completely primary ring. 
Proof: 
We show first that a ring ~ 
in which every sum of non- 
units is a non-unit is completely primary. 
All we need shOw is that 
in such a ring t 
is a unit whenever st 
is one for some 
s e S. 

32 
I 
32 
Thus let 
r(st) = i. 
We show that t(rs) = i: 
e = trs = t(rst)rs is 
an idempotent - i.e., e2=e-, and 
l=e+(1-e). 
By hypothesis 
e 
or 
(l-e) 
is a unit. 
If 
(l-e) 
is a unit then 
1 - e = l, since 
1 - e 
is also an idempotent and 
e = 0 
contradicting 
the fact that 
rset = (rst)(rst) = 1. 
Thus 
e 
has to be a unit, i.e., e = rst = 1. 
Now we come to the actual proof of (4.9). 
Let 
$,# c EndR(M ) 
be such that 
~ + ~ = 1M; 
with the above result it suffices to show 
that either 
~ 
of 
# 
is a unit. 
We put 
I n =Im 
sn, 
where 
sn = $$...$, n-zimes. 
Then we have the descending chain 
I ° 
m In+ 
o .. 
M = 
o I 1 o...m I n 
1 
"' 
which becomes stationary by hypothesis, 
say 
I n = Inl 
for 
n > n 1. 
On the other hand, 
[~ 
= Ker ~n} 
form an ascending chain 
K 1 c ~ 
c...c K n c ~+i 
c ... 
which becomes stationary by hypothesis, 
say 
K n -- Kn2 
for 
n > n?. 
If we put 
a = max(nl,n2) , 
then 
~al I 
: I a 
> i2a = i a 
is epic 
a 
~a[ia 
and has zero kernel, i.e., 
is an isomorphism. 
(~x 
denotes 
a 
)-i 
the restriction 
of ~ to X. ) The existence of (~ ~I

injection,

is split. 
But 
M 
was assumed to be indecomposable, 
i.e., 
I a -- 0 
or 
I a = M. 
If 
I a = O, 
then 
~a = 0 
and 
$ = (1-~) 
has the in- 
verse 
i + ~ + ~2 + ... + ~a-l. 
If 
I a = M 
then 
~a :M

is 
an isomorphism and thus 
$ 
is an isomorphism.

Definition: 
A ring 
R is called left artinian (reso. lef____~t 
noetherian), if 
R R (cf. (1.3)) 
is artinian (resp. noetherian). 
4.12 
Lemma: 
Let 
R be a left artlnian (resp. noetherian) ring 
and 
_a a two-sided ideal in 
R. 
Then 
R/a is left artinian (resp. 
noetherian). 
Proo.__~f: This is an immediate consequence of (4.3). 
# 
4.13 
L emma: 
A finite direct sum of rings is left artinian 
(resp. noetherian) if and only if each summand is left artinian (resp. 
noetherian). 
Proof: 
This follows from (4.4), (cf. Ex. 4,7). 
4.14 
Theorem: 
Every left module of finite type over a left 
artinlan (resp. noetherian) ring is artinlan (resp. noetherlan). 
Let 
R be left artinian (resp. noetherian) and M ¢ ~_f. 
Proo_~f: 
Then there exists a free left R-module 
F with a finite basis, such 

I 35 
ss 
that we have an eplmorphlsm 
$ : F 
> M. 
Since 
F ~ (RR) n (cf. (1.12)), 
F is artinian (resp. noetherian) by 
(4.4), and from (4.3) it follows that 
M 
is artinian (resp. 
noetherian). 
The statements in the rest of this section can be proved for 
arbitrary rings, using Zorn's le~ma; however, for our purposes it 
suffices to prove them for left noetherian rings. 
Definition: 
Let 
R be a left noetherian ring and 
Me ~f 
4.15 
The radical of M, 
rad M, 
is defined as 
rad M = 6~ [~ :M--> S, S simple] Ker 
where the intersection is taken over all homomorphisms 
~ 
from M 
into simple left R-modules 
S. 
Since 
R is noetherian, tad M 
is 
the intersection of all maximal left R-submodules of M. 
R is called 
semisimDle if rad R = 0. 
4.16 
Remark: 
For M c ~f, rad M 
is a characteristic sub- 
module; i.e., if ~ e EndR(M), then 
~[rad M : rad M 
> rad M. 
Indeed, if ~ : M 
> S, 
where 
S is a simple left R-module, then 
Irad M : rad M 
> Ker a. 
In particular, rad R is a two-sided 
ideal, since EndR(R ) ~ R via right multiplication. 
Moreover, 
(rad R)'M c ra~ M~ since (rad R) • S = 0 
for every simple left R- 
module 
S; 
in fact, given 
s ¢ S 
there is an R-homomorphism 
~ 
.~R 
> S, ~s : r l 
> rs; 
hence 
~s : rad R 
> 0, 
and since 
s was arbitrary, (rad R) • S = 0. 
4.17 
Lemma: 
If 
J c rad R is a two-sided ideal, then 
tad (R/J) --- (rad R)/J; 
in particular, 
R/rad R is semislmple. 
Proof: 
This follows from the fact that 
J 
is contained in 
every maximal left ideal of 
R.

Lemm____._aa 
(Nakayama's Lemma): 
The following conditions on a 
left ideal 
I 
in 
R 
are equivalent: 
(i) 
I c rad R .

then 
IM = M 
implies 
M =

If 
M 
O. 
(iii) 
If 
M ¢ ~f 
and if 
N c M, 
then 
M = N + IM 
implies N=M 
(iv) 
i + I 
consists of left invertlble 
elements. 
Proof: 
(i) 
>(ii). 
Since 
I c rad R, 
we have 
IM c (rad R) • M c rad M; thus rad M = M, 
a contradiction unless 
M = O, 
since 
rad M 
is the intersection of the maximal submodules 
of 
M. 
(li) 
~, (lli). 
From 
M = N + IM 
we conclude 
M/N =|N+IM~N = 
I(M/N), 
and the result follows from (ii). 
(iil)------9(iv). 
Let 
u = 1 + x ¢ 1 + I, 
then 
R = I + R • u, 
and wlth (iii) we obtain 
R • u = R; i.e., there exists 
v ¢ R 
such 
that 
vu -- l; 
but 
1 = vu = v + vx 
implies 
v = 1 - vx c 1 + I; 
thus 
v 
has a left inverse, 
and 
u 
is left invertlble. 
(iv) 
~, (i). 
If 
I 
were not contained in every 
maximal left ideal m of R, then 
I + m = R 
for some m, and m would 
contain a left invertible element

x ~ I, a contradiction.

ring A together with a unitary ring homomorphism ~ s R

A as (Im ~)-algebra (1 a Im ~), and from now on we assume that

Definitions Let R be a commutative ring and A an R-algebra. An 
element a a A is said to be integral over R, If a satisfies one of 
the equivalent conditions of (5.2). One says that A is integral over 
if every element a a A is integral over R. A is called finite over 
or a finite R-algebra 
if A is an R-module of finite type. 
5.4 
Remarkl If the R-algebra A is finite over R, then A is integral 
over R by (5.2,iii). The converse of this statement is false! e.g., 
the ring of all algebraic integers is not a finite ~-algebra.

We have R[a] ,R[b]CR[a,b] = R[a][ b] = Rtb][a] C A. 
Since M = R[a] Rib] = {finite~- xiyi ' xi a R[a] ,yi a R~b]} contains

Dedekind domains 
Every lattice over a Dedekind domain is projective! principal 
ideal domains are Dedekind domains, and semi-local Dedekind do- 
mains are principal ideal domains. The Chinese remainder theorem 
is proved. 
7.1 
Definitio~sl An integral domain R is called a Dedekind domain, 
if 
(i) R is integrally closed in its quotient field K, i.e., R 
coincides with the integral closure of R in K (cf. (5.6)). 
(ii) R is noetherian (cf. (4.11)). 
(iii) Every prime ideal in R is maximal. 
An R-module M is said to be R-torsion-free, if rm = 0, r~ 
R, m E M, 
implies r = 0 or m = 0. M is called an R-torsion module, if 
f 
Vm 
~ M, 3 0 # r a R such that rm = 0. (If M £ R~ ' this is the same 
as saying annR(M) # 0 (cf. (4.15)).) An R-lattlce is a finitely ge- 
nerated torsion-free R-module. By R ~° we denote the class of R-lat- 
tices. The rank of.an R-lattice M, rank(M), is defined to Se 
dimK(K ~R M) (<,-), the K-dimension of the K-vector space K l R M. 
Since K ~R M is naturally isomorphic to 
~m/k I m ¢ M, k ¢ K, k ~ O} = KM (cf. (6o4))j 
we identify KM and K ~R M, and consider M C KM = K ~R M, since 
M ---~KMI m ~ ~ m/l is a monomorphism, M being a lattice. From (6.5) 
it follows that K is a flat R-module. For an R-lattice M, rank(M) = 0 
if and only if M = 0. A fractional R-ideal in K is an R-lattice con- 
tained in K, and a fractional ideal is called an integral ideal if 
it is contained in R. For a fractional R-Ideal a we define 
-1 = ~ x ~ K , x~ ~.R~. Then -1 
is a fractional ideal (of. Ex. 7,1), 
since a is of finite type. The fractional ideals are exactly the 
M g R M°= with rank(M) = 1.

u n 
~i 
a 
= = 
i=l ~i 
, where ~i,l~i~n, are different prime ideals and 
the ~i,lmi-~n, are non-zero integers~ 
(ii) Avery R-lattice is a projective R-module. 
Proofa This wlll follow from (IV, Ex. 4,1) and (IV, Ex. 4,2), where 
the above theorem is proved using techniques developed for maximal 
orders. However, there are direct proofs available (cfo e.g. 
Bourbaki [2B, Ch. 7)o 
# 
7.3 
Theoremt Let R be a Dedekind domain. Every R-lattice is isomor- 
phic to a direct sum of a finite number of fractional ideals. 
Proofl We need the concept of "pure" submodulesl 
7.4 
Definitions Let M be an R-lattice and N a submodule of M (one 
should observe, that N is also an R-lattlce (cf. (4.3) and (4.14)). 
N is called an R-pure submodule of M, if M/N is an R-lattice, Since 
every R-lattlce is projective, this is equivalent to the splitting 
of the sequence 0 
~ N 
~ M 
- M/N 
~ 0. 
For the proof of (7.3)we use induction on rank(M): For rank(M) = 1 
the statement is trivial (cf.(6.1)). Now, let rank(M) = n > 1. 
If 
0 # m a M, then N = M ~ Km (observes M c KM) 
is a pure submodule of M. Thus M = N • (Km + M)/Km (cf. (2o9)), and 
rank(M) = rank(N) + rank((Km + M)/Km). Since N is isomorphic to a 
fractional ideal, the result follows now from the induction hypo- 
thesis. 
# 
7.5 
I~mmas Every principal ideal domain R is a Dedekind domain. 
Proofl Let R be a principal ideal domain. Then R is noetherian, since 
every ideal is principal, and it is easily seen, that every prime 
ideal in R Is maximal. 
It remains to show that R is integrally closed. Let R' be the inte- 
gral closure of R in the quotient field K of R. If x a R', then 

I47 
47 
x = r/r', r' # O, (cf. (6.3)) and x satisfies a monic polynomial 
X n ÷ rn_lXn-l÷...÷ r o, r i ~ Ro 
Since the cancellation law holds in R, we may assume, that r and r' 
do not have a common factor. Then, if r' is not a unlt in R, there 
exists a maximal ideal Rm such that r' £ Rm but r ~ Rm (cf. (4.1)). 
Moreover 
n 
rn lr,rn-l+. 
r 
+ 
..+r'nr 
= O. 
- 
O 
This implies r n ~ Rm. Since Rm is a prime ideal, r arm, a contra- 
diction. Thus there does not exist a maximal ideal containing r'| 
Joe., r' is a unit in Ro Hence x c R, and R is integrally closed 
in K. 
# 
7.6 
Corollarys Every lattice M over a principal ideal domain is free 
on rank(M) basis elements. 
Proofs This follows immediately from (7.3), since every fractional 
ideal over a principal ideal domain is a free module with a basis 
consisting of one element (cf. Ex. 7,5).

many prime ideals. Then R is a principal ideal domain. 
Proof, We remark that a commutative ring with only finitely many

notation should be understood as (R_Pl)__p2 ~- R=P2 H R (Rp=l ~R R), 
(of. (6.4)), and (Rs)s, ~ RS, ~R (Rs IR R). This makes sense, since 
R S is an R-module (of. (6.3) and (1.3)). Moreover, R 
is a subrlng

of K in a natural way (of. (5.2)). The verification of (8.4) is left

For M ~ R~ 
and a two-sided ideal I we make M 
into a topological space under the I-adic topology. A base of neigh- 
borhoods of 0 & M is given by the sets InM, n a No The neighborhoods 
of m ~ M are obtained by translations. M is hausdorff under this 
topology if and only if ~ 
InM = O! we then say that M is I-haus-

I n = O. If M is I-hausdorff,

d i M ~ M 
~ R, d(m,m) = 0 and 
d(m,m') = 2 -n if and only if m-m' a InM~In+lM 
makes M into a metric R-module. The completion 
(via Cauchy sequences) of M with respect to d is called the topolo- 
gical I-adic completion. It is easily seen (cf. Exo 9,2), that for 
an I-hausdorff module, the I-adic completion is naturally isomorphic 
to the topological I-adic completion.

HOMOLOGICAL ALGEBRA 
§i. 
CateRories and functors 
Elementary definitions and examples for categories and 
functors are given; additive functors preserve finite products; 
examples of functors that preserve additional structure. 
Kernels, 
cokernels, etc. and abellan categories are considered In the 
exercises. 
Fiber products and fiber coproducts are introduced. 
Definition: 
Let 
~ be a class of "objects" 
together with a function and a f~mily of set functions 
I.i 
A, B, C, • • • 
defined as follows : 
(i) 
objects (C) x objects (C) 
(A,B) I 
> morph~(A,B). 
The elements 
(il) 
> sets 
e morphc(A,B) 
are called the 
C-morphlsms .from A 
to B; @ : A 
> B. 
We shall 
write morphisms on the right. 
For each triple 
A,B,C g ob(C) (ob(C) = objects (C)) 
a function : 
morPhc(A,B) x morPhc(B,C) 
> morph_c (A, C) 
> ~. 
$~ is called the composite of 
~ 
and $. 
C 
is called a category, if the following two axioms hold: 
Associatlvity: 
If 
~ :A 
> B, ~ :B 
> C, X : C 
> D 
are morphisms, then 
(~)× = ~(~X). 

66 
II 2 
Identity: 
For every 
A ¢ ob(C), there exists 
i A c morph 
(A,A) 
such that for each 
~ ¢ morphc(A,B ) and 
~ ~ morph__c(C,A) 
= lAW 
and 
~ = $l A. 
1.2 
Examples:I.Let 
R be a ring 
(i) 
R=_M = category of left R-modules where 
Ob(R=M) = [M:M = left R-module}, morph~(M',M) 
= HomR(M',M)- 
(ii) 
~ 
= category of finitely generated left R-modules. 
(iii) 
R=P f = category of finitely generated projective left 
R-module s • 
(iv) 
If 
S is also a ring, then 
~-S = category of 
(R, S)-blmodules : Ob(R~ S) = {M : M = (R, S)-bimodule~, 
morphR~_S(M',M) = HOmR, s(M',M) -- [~ ~ HOmz(M',M) : r(m'~)s = 
(rm's)~; 
m' ~ M', r ¢ R, s c S?. 
(For bimodules we write the homomorphlsms generally as exponents.) 
II. 
A = category of abelian groups where 
the morphisms are group-homomorphisms, 
(A = zM). 
1.3 
Definition: 
Let 
C 
and 
D 
be categories. 
A 
covariant functor (contravariant functor) F:C 
> D 
is a pair 
consisting of an object function and a family of morphism functions 
F :ob(C) 
> ob(D), F :A} 
> F(A), 
F : morphc(A,B) 
> morp~(F(A),F(B)), 
__F : ~ . 
> F(~), 
[(_F : morphc(A,B) 
> morp~(F(B),F(A))] 
satisfying the following two requirements: 
(i) 
F(1 A) = I__F(A), 
(ii) 
= 
= 
Condition (ii) can be expressed as follows : Given a comutative 
diagram in C 

II 3 
67 
A 
~ 
>B 
C 
, 
then the diagram 
F(~) 
F(A) 
~ 
- 
> F(B) 
=F(c) 
F(B) 
=F(A) < ~< 
= 
F(C) 
is commutative. 
1.4 
Remark: 
In all cases that we consider, morph(A,B) 
as 
well as morph(~(A),~(B)) 
is an abelian group. 
Then we can also 
require from a functor 
(lii) 
~(~+$') = ~($) + ~(~'), 
and call 
~ 
an additive 
functor. 
More precisely, since all our categories are categories of 
modules, we are only interested in additive categories with finite 
direct ~ums (finite biproducts); i.e., categories 
C 
in which 
morphc(A,B ) is an abellan group, such that 
~. ) the composition of morphisms is distributive, when 
defined; i.e., 
$($i+$2 ) -- $$i + ~$~' ($i+~2)~ = ~i $ + ~$" 
~.) 
there exists a unique zero object 
0 
such that 
morphc(0,A ) and morphc(B, 0) 
have exactly one element each, 
denoted by O, 
for every 
A, B e ob(C).

~.) 
TO each pair of objects 
AI, ~ 
e ob(~) 
there exists an 
object A 1 $ ~ 
e ob(~) 
called the direct sum (coproduct) of A 1 
and ~, 
with a pair of maps 
~l :A1 
> A1 @ ~ 
and 
~2 :~ 
> AI $ ~' 
such that, given 
~ ¢ morph~(Ai, B), 
~ morph~(~,B), 
one can complete the following diagram cOmmut- 
atively in one and only one way: 
A1 
~ 
A2 
This means that in C there exist finite direct sums (cf. Ex. I, 
i, 2). 
For additive categories one obviously requires that a functor 
be additive. 
From now ~ 
all categories and functors under 
consideration are additive. 
1.5 
Examples: 
I. 
Let 
R be a ring, and let M e ~ 
be fixed. 
(For 
categories of modules we write M e ~ 
instead of M ¢ ob(~).) 
Then

h~R(M,-) : N J > Hom~(~,N), 
hOmR(M,-) : HomR(N',N )

hOmR(M,-) : ~ I > hom(1M,~), 
is an additive covarlant functor. 
(ll)

(iv) 
Similarly, for M ~ ~, -@R M : __M 
R

is an 
additive covariant ftmctor. 
1.6 
Lena: 
An additive functor preserves (finite) direct 
sums. 
Proof: 
Let 
F : C

be a contravariant functor. 
For 
AI, ~ 
E oh(C), 
we know 
F(A I) @ F(~) 
together with 
~~i ~ m°~(~(A1) ~ ~(~)'~(Ai))' i -- 1,2 is a product 
(cf. Ex. 1,5). 
Thus, we can complete the following diagram 
c o-,nutatively 
-F(AI

__F(A1) &~ 
3n I T

II 6 
Similarly one shows that 
aT = l~(A1 ) ~ ~(~); 
thus 
~(A l) S ~(~) 
with 
'~l and 
'~2' and ~(AI@ ~) 
with ~(~i ) and 
F(w 2) 
are both coproducts in D; 
whence, by the universal 
property of coproducts, they are naturally isomorphic. 
Similarly 
for a covariant 
~.

1.8 Definitions: (i) 
Let

(ii) 
A functor ~ : RM

~(~) = o ==j,,~ = o, ~ ~ Hom~(M,M,), ~,M' ~ ~. 
Tbls automatically implies 
M = 0 if ~(M) = 0~ for M ~ R=M- 
1.9 Theorem: 
Let 
R be a ring. 
(1) 
For M ¢ R=M, both homR(M,- ) and hOmR(-,M) 
are 
left exact. 
For M ¢ =MR, N ¢ ~, M eR-

exact. 
(ill) 
(iv) 
M ¢ ~ 
is projective ~,~ p-- hOmR(M,-) 
is exact. 
M ¢ =M R is flat ~ 
M ®R- is exact. 
Proof: 
(i) follows from (I, 2.6) and(I, 2.7), (li) follows 
from (I, 3.12) 
and (I, 3.13), (ill) is the translation of 
(I, 2.9), and (iv) is the definition of flat (cf. I, (3.16)). 
1.10 Definition: 
Let ~ and ~ be categories and 
~i'~2 : ~ 
> ~ functors (either both covariant or both 
contravarlant). 
A fAmlly 
= {~A}A ¢ ob(~)' ~A ¢ m°rpI~__(~I(A)'~2(A)) 
is called a natural transformation of the functors 
~l and ~2: 
: ~l

if for every u ~ morph~(A,B), A,B ¢ ob(~), 
the 
following diagram is commutative: 
~A 
~l(A)

~2(A) 
~l(~)

(This is the diagram for a covariant

each ~A is an isomorphism, i.e.,

3 v A ~ morp~=(~2(A),~l(A)) 
such that 
VA~ A = l~2(A ) and 
kAV A = l~l(A ) (cf. Ex. 1,1)), then ~ is called a natural 
equivalence; notation for natural equivalence: 
~l ~ ~2" 
In that 
case, one can identify 
~l(A) 
and ~2(A), A ¢ ob(~) 
and 
morp%J~l(A), ~ (B)) and morp~J~2(A),~2(B)). 
i.ii Remark: 
(I.i0) Justifies, that in Ch. I we have 
identified some modules; e.g., 
A ®R(B ®S C) with 
(A e R B) ®S C 
and 
~ 
with 
~_ ®R M. 
From now on, we shall in general 
identify naturally equivalent functors. 
1.12 Lemma: 
Let ~ : S~ 
> ~ be a covariant [contra- 
variant] functor (~ = category of abelian group~. 
If M ¢ S--~' 
where 
S and 
R are rings, then ~(M) E ~R 
[~(M) ~]. 
Proof: 
We give only a proof for contravariant 
~, 
the proof 
for covariant 
~ being similar. 
For every 
r ~ R, we define 
~r : M 
> M, ~r : m ! '> mr; 
then ~r ¢ m°rphsM(M'M)' 
and 
thus ~(~r ) : ~(M) 
> ~(M) 
is a morphlsm in ~. We now put, 
for x e ~(M), rx = x ~(~r ). This gives 
~(M) 
the structure of a 
left R-module. 
We only have to check the associativlty: 
(rlr2)x = xF(~rlr2)= = x__F(~rl~r2) = xF(~r2)F(~rl)= 
= 
= rl(rzx).

The dual concept, which is obtained from 
that of the fiber product by reversing the arrows, is called the 
flber .coproduct (pushout). It should be observed that the fiber 
product and the fiber coproduct are unique up to isomorphism if 
they exist. 
1.15 Theorem: 
Let

For every diagram ~

1.16 Lemma: 
Let 
R be a ring, and 
consider 
~. 
(i) 
In the fiber product, if ~

A submodule 
M

Proof: 
This follows readily from (1.15). 
Remark: 
For (1.15) and (1.16) it suffices that the morphisms 
in C 
are set maps, and C 
is an additive category in which 
kernels and cokernels exist.

In any category whose morphlsms are set maps, (e.g., any 
category of algebraic structures with structure preserving maps), 
every injection is monic, every surJection is epic, and every map

Note that the last 
property is to be taken with a grain of salt in the case of struc-

Not every monomorphism is a kernel and not every

Use the examples of (2.(iii))

§2. 
HomoloKy. 
Homology is defined and the exact triangle theorem and 
the exact prism theorem are proved for complexes and graded 
complexes of modules. 
In the exercises, a categorical 
approach to homology in additive categories with kernels, 
cokernels and O's is outlined. 
In this section 
R is a fixed ring. 
2.1 
Definition: 
A complex 
(M, 5) 
consists of M c R~ and 
5 ¢ EndR(M) 
such that 
5 2 = O; 
5 is called a differentiation. 
We define the cycles of 
(M, 5): 
Z d~f Ker 5, boundaries of 
(M, 5) : B d~f Im 5. 
Since 
5 2 = O, B~ Z, 
and 
H(M, 5) d~f z/B ~ RE is called the homology ~roup of the complex 
(M, 5). 
Given two complexes 
(M, 5), (M',5'); a chain map 
: 
(M, 5) 
> (M',5') 
is a map 
following diagram is commutative : 
M 
> M' 
D: 
5 4 
i 5' 
M 
> M' 
~' c HomR(M,M') 
such that the 
Since, in general, there is no ambiguity, we shall identify 
and ~'. 
The complexes and chain maps form a category. 
2.2 
Lemma: 
A chain map 
$ : (M, 5) 
> (M',5') 
induces a 
A 
homomorphism 
$ : H(M, 5) 
> H(M',5'), ~ : z + B| 
> z$ + B', 
of left R-modules. 
The proof is straightforward. 
2.3 
Lemma: 
Let 
(M, 5), (M',5') 
and let 
~ : (M, 5) 
> (M',5') 
and 
and 
(M", 5") 
be complexes 
: (M,,8,) 
> (M",6") 
be chain maps. 
Then 

82 
II 18 
l~ : 1H(M, 5) 
" 
The proof follows by applying the definition of A 
. 
# 
This shows that 
(M, 6) 
> H(M, 0) 
together with the 
operation "t," is a covariant functor from the category of 
complexes and chain maps into 
~, 
the category of left 
R-module s. 
2.4 
Definition: 
Let 
(M, 0) 
and 
(M'~0') 
be complexes and 
let 
~,¥ : (M, 5) --> 
(M',0') 
be chain maps. 
Then 
~ 
is said to 
be hcmotopic to ¥ 
(notation~ ~ ~ T), 
if there exists 
p e HomR(M,M') 
such that 
~ 
- ¥ 
= pS' + 5p. 
is an equivalence relation. 
2.5 
Lemma: 
Let 
~,Y : (M, 5) 
> (M',5') 
"Being homotopic" 
be two homotopic 
chain maps of complexes. 
Then 
• = V. 
The proof follows from an easy computation. 
2.6 
Definition: 
A sequence 
0 ~> 
(m,O') 
~ > (M, 5) 
~ > (M",5") 
> 0 
of complexes and chain rasps is said to be exact, if 
0

~' > M V' > M" 
> O 
0 
> M' 
~ ~ M 
7 
> M" ~> 
0 
is a commutative diagram with exact rows. 
2.7 Theorem (Exact triangle theorem): 
Given an exact 
sequence 
E : o 
> (~',~,) ~> (M,8) ~----> (H",~") 
> o 

II 19 
8S 
of complexes and chain maps. 
Then there exists an exact triangle (cf. I, (2.1)) 
.(M,.5,) 
+, > H(M.~) 
H(M", 5") 
(this means the triangle is exact at every corner); 
A E 
is called 
the connec~in K homomorphism. 
Proof: 
Definiti.on of ~. 
We have the commutative diagram 
with exact rows 
0 
> M' ...9__> M 
T > M" 
> 0 
0 
> M' _R__> M 
¥ > M r'

. 
By (Ex. 2,1), 
: Ker 5" 
where the construction of m' 
there exists an R-homomorphism 
> Coker 5', i.e., 
: Z"

is indicated by the dis~rsm

Moreover, 

84 
II 20 
m, Sl~ 
_- mt~6 
-- 
m66 
-- O. 
Since 
~ 
is monlc, 
mr51 = O; i.e., 
m t E Z I. 
Then 
~ 
induces a map 
: z" 
-> ~(~,,~,), 
: z" I 
> m w + B t. 
Moreover, if 
z" ~ Z" 
is in 
B", 
then 
z"~ = O, 
and 
induces an R-homomorphlsm 
~ 
: H(M",5")

the 
conn~tin~ homomorphlsm. 
The 
proof o_~f the exactness o_~f the triangle i_.n_n (2.7) is left 
as an exercise.

be a commutative diagram, with chain maps 
p, ~, • 
and sCsequences 
of complexes and chain maps. 
Then the following prism has 
commatative sides and exact triangles :

In other words, the functor H 
induces a functor from exact 
sequences of complexes to exact triangles.

Definitions: 
Let 
X i ¢ R=M, 0 < i < ~, 
5 i ~ HomR(Xi, Xi_l), 0 < i < ~, 
such that 
515i. I = O, 
0 < i < ~. 
The sequence

• 
> Xi_l --> ...

>0 
is called a graded complex of R-modules and the 
5 i, 0 < i < ~, 
are called differentiations. 
With each graded complex X, 
we may associate a complex 
(X, 5), (cf. (~.l))#in the following way: 
Let X --6) 
X i be 
i=O 
the coproduct of the family 
(Xi: 0 < i < ~},(cf. Ex. I, 1,2). 
Then X ¢ ~= is called a graded left R-module# and 
5 : X 
> X, 
v~ ~ 
u~ ~ 
5 : ~ 
xi ~ 
> L 
xi5 i 
is a differentiation on X 
i=O 
i=O 
(of. (~.l)). 
It should be observed that in 2 
x i E X 
only 
i=O 
finitely many entries are different from zero. 
Since 
8 maps 

86 
II 22 
X i 
into 
Xi.l., 
5 
is said to be homogeneous of dggree -i on the 
graded module 
X. 
The homology group of 
(X, 5), 
H(X, 5) = Ker 5/Ira 5 = ~i=0 
Ker 5i/Im 5i+i, 
is also a graded 
module, and we define the n-th homology group o.f. the graded 
complex 
X by 
~(X, 5) = Ker 5#Im 5n+ 1 = ~(Xn, Sn) , 0 < n < ~, 
in particular, 
Ho(X, 5) = Coker 81. 
Similarly, for the graded 
51 
5 
complex 
0 
> X0. 
> Xl ~> 
... 
> ~ 
n > Xn+l 
> ... 
the n-th cohomoloKy group is defined as 
Hn(x, 5) = Ker 5n+l/Im 5 n, H 0 = Ker 51; 
however, we shall not make this distinction here. 
Let 
(X, 5), (X',5") 
be two graded complexes of R-modules. 
A 
chain map of these graded complexes, 
$ : (X, 5) 
> (X',5') 
is a 
f~m~ly 
~i E HomR(Xi, Xi'), 0 < i < ®, 
such that for every 
0 < i < ®, 
the following diagram is commutative: 
5 i 
X i 
> Xi. I 
x I 
> 
1 
i.e., 
$5' = 5~ in 
symbolic notation. 
Again, the graded 
complexes and chain maps form a category. 
From (2.2) it follows that a chain map 
~ : (X, 5) --> (X',6') 
of graded complexes induces an R-homomorphism of graded left 
R-modules : 

II 23

Remark: 
Since this chapter deals with homologlcal algebra only 
as far as it is used later for applications to orders, where only 
finitely generated modules are considered, we define projective reso- 
lutions only for finitely generated modules. 
In this section#

Lemma: 
For M c ~ 
there exist projective resolutions. 
Proof: 
Pick 
Po¢ ~f; e.g., a free module of finite type, such 
that M is the homomorphic image of Po; 
say M = Po5o . Then we 
obtain the exact sequence 
t o

Since 
P O ~ d 
and since 
Po is noetherlan, Ker 6 0 ~ _/, 
(cf. I, 
(4.2)); and we can find P1 ¢Rf 
and 
61 such that 
PISI = Ker ~o" 
Now we proceed this way and define inductively a chain of short exact 
sequences

# 
Remark: 
We point out that there is no uniqueness in the choice 
of a projective resolution, and that in general a projective resolu- 
tion has infinite length. 
It has flnlte length2 if for some i, 
Ker 5 i e R=~. Clearly, we can consider a projective resolution

as a graded complex 
(P, 5) 
(cf. (2.9)). 
From the exactness of P it 
follows that H(P, 5) = O. A graded complex 
(X, 5) with H(X, 5) = 0 
is called an ~cyclic ~radgd complex. 
H(X, 5) = 0 if and only if X 
is exact. 
3.3 Definition: 
Let S l, S 2 be rings and

If

is a graded complex (of. (2.9)), because 
__F is an additive functor 
(cf. (1.3) and (1.4, lii)). Thus we may form the homology groups 
H(~,_FO) 
of ~(x). 
As will be shown in (3.5), the correspondence 
Sl~--> s2~ 
M, 
> H(~(x),~(5)) , 
which turns out to be independent of the choice of the projective 
resolution)gives rise to the so-called derived functor of __F. 
3.4 Examples: 
(i) Let for some fixed N ¢ ~_ 
homR(-,N) : _~ - > A , M~HomR(M,N) 
(cf. (1.5,1)). 
If 
P : "'" 
"'> P2 82> P1 51> Po 80> M 
> 0 
is a projective resolution for M 
(cf. (3.1), (3.2)), we apply 
hOmR(-,N) 
to it and obtain the complex 
hom(P,N) :0

horn( 5 2 , 1 N) 
HomR(PI, N ) .... 
> HomR(P2, N) 
> .... 
is left exact (of. (1.9)), 
~er(hom(81,1N)) = 
thus Hi(hom(P,N), hom(O, lN)) = O, 
i-0 , 1 , and 
we are only interested in the homology groups of 
hom(P,N)' :0 
> HomR(Po, N) 61 
02 
> HomR(P1,N) ~--~--> HomR(P2,N) 
> ... , 
where 
5 i = hom(0i, lN). 
The homology groups of hom(P,N)' 
are denoted by 
Since hom( -, N)

98 
.ll- 
i = O, i, 2,...; 50 = O, 
II 3~ 
= E t C ,N)p 
= Ker oi+l/ 
 
and the map 
is called the i-th right derived functor of hom(-,N), i = O, i, 2,.., 
induced by the resolution P; however, this will turn out to be 
independent of P. 
(ii) For some fixed N e ~ 
let "@R N :=~

(cf. (l.5,ili)). 
If

P : "'"

is a projective resolution for M ~ __M

obtain the complex 
P ®R N : ... 
> P2@R N 
> PIeR N 
> PO®R N 
> M~RN 
> 0. 
Since 
-®R N is right exact, (cf. (I.i0)), 
Im(51®~)=Ker(Oo~iN), 
and one considers only the homology groups of the complex 
O~ ®I

The homology groups of

i = O, i, 2,...; 5~ ® i : Po ~R N

The map TorR(-,N)p : =~ 
> A,= M ' '> TorR(M, N) p, i = 0, i,2,.., is 
called the i-th lef$ derived Dmctor of

3.5 Theorem: 
The i-th right derived functor of hom(-,N) 
is 

H 35 
99 
an additive contravariant functor 
~ 
derived functor of -@R N is a covariant functor ~ 
(3.~)). 
The proof is done in several steps: 
First# we show how to define 
i 
' Exti(M, N) p 
extR(~, N)p . 
torR($,N)p: TorR(M',N)p 
> A, 
and the i-th left

(cf. 
> Exti(M', N)p 
> Tor~(M, N) p, 
and 
for ~ : M' 
> M, M', M of finite type. 
3.6 Lemm~:: Let M', M ¢ ~ 
and ~ e HomR(M',M). 
If P' 
and P are projective resolutions for M' 
and M respectively, 
then there exists a chain map T : P' 
> P such that T-1 = ~" 
Without too much abuse of the notation, we write 
~ : P' 
> P. 
Proof: 
Since P~ ¢ R=~, we can complete the following diagram 
c ommut atlvely : 
P~

~o/

the following diagram can be completed commutatively:

// I+1 
/ 
Im 5~+ 1 
>Im 5i+ I

where we have identified the restriction of ¥i to Im 5~+ I with ¥i" 
Evidently, 
~i+l also completes the diagram D commutatively (or, 
more precisely, composed with the injection Im 5i+ I 
> Pi). 
# 
Definition of exti(~,N). 
The chain map ~ : P' 
> P induces a chain map 
hom($,l N) : hom(P,N)' 
> hom(P',N)'~ (cf. (3.4), because of the 
functoriality of homR(-,N ). This in turn induces a family of maps: 
extiR(~,N) : Exti(M,N)p 
> Exti(M',N)p, ~ (cf. (2.2)). 
S1mllarly 
tor~(O,N) 
: ToriR(Mv,N)pv 
> TorR(M,N)p 
is defined. 
Remark: 
For a particular projective resolution 
P of M, 
Exti(M,N)p and Tor~(M,N)p are well defined. 
However, the chain map 
: P' 
> P 
(cf. (3.6)) is not uniquely determined by this 
construction. 
3.T Lemma: 
If P. and P are projective resolutions of the 
R-modules of finite type M' 
and M resp., and if $i,~2 : P' --> P 
are two chain maps induced by ~ ~ HOmR(M',M) , (cf. (3.6)), 
then 
= 
= 
Proof: 
We shall show that ~i and ~2 are homotopic (cf. (2.4)). 

II 37 
iOl 
For then hom(gl,~) 
and hom(92,~) 
are homotople (cf. (2.9))and 
from (2.5) it will follow that exti(gl, N) = ext~(92,N ) and 
torR(gl, N) = torR(92,N). 
Thus we have to show that there exists a map 
P : P' 
> P' Pl : Pi-1 
> Pi' 
such that the following diagram

implies 
91,i. 1 - 92,i_ 1 = 51_15i. 1 + PiSi • We define Pi recurs- 
Ively: 
Po : M' 
> Po as Po = O. Now, if Pi :P i-1

constructed, we define Pi+l by: 
i+l// / / /~ 
il 
Pi+l ~/ 
51+1 > Pi 
(91,±-92, i) - 51pi 
5 
~> Pi.-i 
This is possible since 
pl(91.1 - 92, i - ~pl) C zm 51+ 1 
. 
Now: 
9ii - 92i - 5iPi = Pi+l 5i+i" 
Thus 
91 ~ 92 • 
# 
Tor~(M',N)p 
are independent-up to isomorphism-of the chosen project- 
ire resolution, and thus, we shall omit the index 
P. 
Proof: 
Given two projective resolutions 
P1 and P2 of M. 
Then the map 1 M : M 
> M induces two chain maps 

102 
II 38 
~i : P1 
> P2 and 
~2 :P2 
> P1 (cf. (3.6)) 
such that ~i~2 Z iP2 and ~2~i ~ ipl. Thus, by (3.7), 
ext~(~2~l,N) = ext~(1P1,N) 
and ext~(~l~2,N) = ext~(1P2,N). 
But 
ext~(~2~l,N) 
= 
ext~(~l,N) 
ext~(~2,N), 
and 
ext~(~l~2,N) 
= 
ext (~2,N) ext (~I,N). Hence Ext (M,N)PI 
Similarly for Tor~(-,N).

3.9 Lemma: 
ext~(@,N) 
and tor~(~,N) 
satisfy the conditions 
(1.3, i, ii, iii,); i.e., the properties of additive functors. 
We leave the verification as an exercise 
(cf. Ex. 3,1).

To compute 
Ext~(-,N), 
we have to replace the middle row by zeros 
(cf. (3.~7). 
If we apply the exact triangle theorem (of. (2.107) to this exact 
sequence of graded complexes, we obtain the desired result, if we can 
show that Ext~(-,N) ~ HomR(-,N ) 
(el. (i.ii). 
Similarly the theorem is proved for 
Tor~(-,N), 
once it is 
shown that 
Tor~(-,N) ~ - ®R N. 
This is done in the next lemma. 
3.11 Lemm____~a: We have a natural equivalence between the functors: 
Ext~(-,N) ~ HomR(-,N ) ) Tor~(-,N) ~ - eR N. 
Proof: 
Per definition (cf. (3.4)7, we have, using the left 
exactness of 
HomR(-,N), 
Ext~(M, N7 = Ker(hom(Bl, iN) ) = Im(hom(5o, lN) 7 ~ HomR(M,N); and 
mlmilarly 
Tor~(M,N) Z M ®R N- 
It remains to show that these are natural transformations; but 
this is an ~mmediate consequence of (3.6) and (3.5): 
A map

§4. 
Homologic al dimension. 
The "change of rings theorem" for homological 
dimensions is proved, and the connections between the 
homological dimensions of the modules in a short exact 
sequence are derived. 
In this section again let 
R be a noetherian ring. 
4.1 Definition: 
Let M e ~; 
M 
has homological dimension 
n 
(notation 
hdR(M) = n) 
if 
(i) 
there exists a projective resolution of M of length n; 
i.e., 
an exact sequence

with Pi e R=

and

length <_ n - i.

We have 
the projective resolution

the sequence

Thus M EI~Pf 
by (I,(2.9)).# 
~.3 Theorem: 
Let M ¢ ~f. 
Then 
hdR(M) < n < 
b Ext~(M,X) = 0, 
~ X c ~. 
Proof: 
" 
~ ": This direction is as obvious as 
(ii) 
~ (ill) of I~.2) and is left as an exercise (Ex. ~,i). 
Conversely, from the first part it follows in particular that 
P ~ ~ 
implies 
Ext~(P,X) = O, 
~ X ¢ ~, 
~ n ~ 1. Now, any 
projective resolution 
P of M gives rise to the following diagram

where the sequences

By (3.10) these sequences induce, for each X c ~, 
sequence 
0 = Extk(Pi, X) 
> Extk(Ker 51, X ) 
> Extk+l(Ker 51_l,X ) 
> 
Extk+l(Pi, X ) = 0 
> 0 are 
an exact 
from which it follows that Extk(Ker 51,X ) ~ Extk+l(Ker 5i_i, X), 
k,i > 0. 
From this, in turn, we conclude by induction that 
k 
EXtkR+h(Ker 5i_h,X ) 
~h < i + l; 
ExtR(Ker 5 i,x) ~ 
, 
_ 

II 47 
111 
hence, 
ExtlR(Ker 6n_2,X) ~ Ext~(M,X). 
Thus, if Ext~(M,X) = O, 
then 
ker 5n. 2 ¢ ~f, 
by (4.2), and we have obtained a projective resolu- 
tion of length (n-l) for M, i.e., 
hdR(M) < n. 
# 
4.4 Lemma: Let 0 
> M' 
> M 
> M" 
> 0 be an exact 
sequence of left R-modules, of finite type. 
If hdR(M ) < ~, 
then 
hdR(M) <_ max(hdR(M' ), hdR(M")). 
Proof: 
If hdR(M' ) = ~ or hdR(M" ) = ~, 
the above formula is 
obviously true. 
Thus we may assume hdR(M' ) = n' < ~, hdR(M")=n"< ®, 
hdR(M) = n < ~ 
and set n o = max(n',n"). 
But then 
n o 
n 
Ext R (M",X) = ExtR°(M',X ) -- 0 by (4.3), which, according to (3.10), 
n o 
implies 
Ext R (M,X) = O. 
This in turn, using (4.3) once more, shows 
that hdR(M ) i max(n',n"). 
# 
4.5 Lemma: 
Let M', M" ¢~, 
P ¢ R=P f and assume that 
0 
> M' 
> P 
> M" 
> 0 iS an exact sequence and M" ~ ~f. 
Then hdR(S") = 1 + hdR(M'). 
Proof: 
From (3.10), we obtain for every N c ~: 
n+l 
,, 
Ext~(M',N) -Ext R (M ,N), n >_ i. 
If M" ~ R~_P 
f, hdR~'M"', >_ i, 
and 
thus the above formula follows. 
4.6 Lemma: 
Let 
R, S be noetherian rings and ~ a homomorphism 
of rings 
R 
> S, with ~(1) = l, 
and such that S is an R-module 
of finite type. 
If M e S Mf, 
then hdR(M) <_ hdR(R S) + hds(M). 
;Proof: Since 
R S ¢ ~f, 
it follows that M e ~f. 
The theorem 
is obviously true if hdR(RS) 
or hds(M) 
is infinite. 
Thus we may 
assnme that hdR(~) < ® 
and hds(M) < ~, 
and we shall prove the 
theorem by induction on hds(M). 
If hds(M) = O, 
then by (4.2), M ~ sPf; 
i.e., 
M • X Z (sS) (n) 
for some positive integer n 
(cf. I, (2.9)). 
Thus, if hdR(RS) = s, 
then for every N e 

112 
II ~8 
Ext~+I(M,N) ~ Ext~+I(x,N) ._ Ext~+l((~)(n).N) = ~ EXtRS+I(RS, N) = 0 
by (1.6) and (3.5); i.e., Ext~+l(M,N) = 0. 
From (4.3) we get 
hdR(M) < s = hdR(RS) + hds(M ). 
Assume nOW that 
hds(M) = m, m > O. 
Then there exists an exact sequence of left S-modules of finite type, 
E : 0 
> M' 
> P 
> M 
> 0, 
where 
P ¢ S Pf. 
Thus, by (4.5), 
hds(M) = i + hds(M') ; i.e., 
hds(M' ) = m - i. 
By the induction hypo- 
thesis, 
hdR(M') < hdR(RS) + m - i. 
From the case 
m = O, we obtain 
hdR(P) <_. s. 
Thus 
hdR(M'), hdR(P) < s + m; 
and since 
E 
is also an 
exact sequence of R-modules, we get from (4.4): 
hdR(M) <_ s + m = hdR(RS) + hds(M ).

De§grip~ion of 
Ext~(M,N) in terms of exact sequences. 
prove that 
Ext~(M,N) 
is naturally equivalent 
We 
to the group of equivalence classes of extensions of N 
by 
M under the Baer sum. 
In this section 
R i_~s a noethorian ring and all modules ar.e lef___!t 
modules of finite type. 
5.1 Definition: 
Let 
M', M" ¢ ~f. 
An extension of M' 
by 
M" 
is a short exact sequence 
E : 0 
> M' 
~ > X 
# > M" 
> O, 
where 
X ¢ ~ 
(then automatically 
X c ~f 
(cf. I, (2.3)), and $,¢ 
are R-homomorphisms. 
On the set ER(M",M') 
of all extensions of M' 
by M r' we introduce the relation p : If 
E : 0 
> M' 
~ > X 
~ > M" 
> 0 ¢ ~R(M",M') 
and 
E': 0 
> M' ~'> X' $'> M" 
> O ¢ ~R(M",M') ) then 
EpE' 
if and 
only if 3 a ¢ HomR(X,X'), 
such that the following diagram is 
commutative : 
X 
i 
0 --> M'" 
I~ 
~,~/j 
" 
X' 
M"--> 0 
We leave it as an exercise to show that 
~ 
is necessarily an iso- 
morphism and that 
p 
is an equivalence relation. 
It should be noted 
that 
E : 0 
> M' 
> X 
> M" , > 0 
and 
E' : 0 
,> M' 
> X' 
> M" 
> 0 with 
X- X' 
does not neces- 
sarily imply 
E@ E' 
(el. Ex. 5,1). 
By 
ER(M",M') 
we denote the set 

114 
II 50 
theoretic quotient ~R(M",M')/P. 
By 
[E] we denote the image of 
E e ~R(M",M') 
in ER(M",M' ). 
If E:0 --> M' .9_> M ~-> M" --> 0 and 
E' :0 
> N' ~'> N ~' 
N" 
> 
> 0 are two exact sequences of left 
R-modules and R-homomorphisms, then a morphism E 
~ E' is a triple 
(u,~,7) 
of R-homomorphlsms, such that the following diagram is 
commutative: 
E : O --> M' 
~ > M 
# > M" 
> 0 
E': 0 
> N' ~'> 
~'> N" 
> 0 
In this way we obtain a category 
~ 
where the objects are short 
m 
exact sequences and the morphisms, written on the right,are triples 
(u,~,7). 
For E, E' e ~R(M",M'), E~E' 
if and only if 
(IM.,a,IM..)E = E' 
for some a ¢ HomR(M,N). 
5.2 Definition: If we now define an equivalence relation p u 
among the morphisms 
(u,~,7) in ~R by 
(u,~,7) p' (u',~',7') 
if 
there exists 
a ¢ HomR(~,M) 
and ~. e HomR(N, N1) 
such that 
(1M,,~,lM,,)(u,6,7)(~,,a',~,,) = (u',6',7') 
and if we denote by 
[u, 6,7] 
the equivalence class of 
(u,~,7), 
then 
[a,B, 7] are the 
morphisms in the category __E 
R, whose objects are the equivalence 
classes of short exact sequences. 
5-3 Theorem: 
Let 
[El e ob(E R) be given, say 
E : 0 
> M' 
~ > X ~ > M" 
> 0 
for every u e HomR(M',N,), 
there exists a unique 
[E'] e ob(~R), 
denoted by 
[E]u, and a unique morphism [u,6,1M.,] ¢ morP~R([E],[E']) 
such that 
[Z][~,~,Z~,S = [E']. 
Proof: According to (i.i$) and (1.15) we can complete the 
diagram

is the fiber coproduct of 
(M';~,m). 
Since 
M' 
~>X 
°I 
I' 
N' 
0 > M" 
is a commutative diagram, there exists a unique homomorphism 
¢' : Q 
~ 
M", 
completing the second square commutatively and such 
that 
@'¢' = O. 
From (1.16) we conclude that 
~' 
is monic. 
It 
remains to show that 
¢' = coker ~' (cf. Ex. §l). 
Since 
~'¢' = O, 
we can complete the following dis~ramuniquely 
N' 
~' 
>Q coker ~' 
,k" 
N r* 
> Coker ~'

and since 
~ 
coker ~' = ~' coker ~' = O, 
we can complete the 
diagram 
M' 
m

coker~> M" = Coker 
If oke;/~ ' / 
31~ 
Coker ~ w 
By the universality of 
coker ~', 
we get 
¢' -- coker $', i.e., 

li6 
II 52 
M" ~ Q/Im ~'. 
Now, if also E(a,~',IM, ,) = E", 
then it follows from 
the universal property of the fiber coproduct (of. (I.13)), that 
E"0 E'. 
Thus, we obtain a unique map 
CE] 
> [E][a,~,IM,,] = [E]a. 
5.4 Theorem: 
Let 
[E] e ob(ER) , 
E : 0 
>M'

") 
s%y 
> M" 
> O, 
for every 
7 ¢ HomR(N",M") 
there exists a unique 
[E'] e ob(~R), 
denoted by 
y[E], 
and a unique 
[1M,,6, y ] c morph=ER([E'],[E ]) 
such 
that 
[E'][IM,,a, ~] = [E]. 
The proof is dual to that of (5.3), using the properties of the 
fiber product. 
5.5 Theorem (Universal property of 
[E]~ 
and 
y[E']): 
[~,B,7] e morp~=R([E],[E,] ) is determined by 
e 
and 
~; 
namely: 
[Z][a,~,~] is the unique 
[E'] 
such that 
7[E'] = [E]m. 
Proof: 
This follows immediately from the universal properties 
of the fiber product and the fiber coproduct. 
5.6 Corollax?/: (i) 
T(Y'[E]) = (yy')[E], 
(ii) ([E]~)a, = 
[E](a~'), 
(lii) (~[E])a = ~([~]a), 
(iv) 
(~[E])[~,~,Z] = 
T ¢[z][~,~,~]) = [~]~ 
Proof: 
These identities are an immediate consequence of (5.2)- 
(5.5)$ e.g., 
[E'] = ( [E])[~,~,¥] 
is uniquely determined by the 
identity 
y[E'] = y[E]a, 
but 
[E]a 
also satisfies this condition. # 
Next we shall define an additive structure on 
ER(M",M') - the 
so-called "Baer sum"-, which makes 
ER(M",M') 
into an 
(End R (M" ), End R (M') ) -bimodule. 
• )The sequence E' constructed in this proof is denoted by 
E~. 
• ")By ~E we denote the sequence E'~[E] constructed with the help 
of the fiber product.

5.7 Theorem: ER(M",M ) is an abelian group under the Baer sum, 
defined below. 
In addition to this, the following formulae are satls- 
fled; for U, Ul, U 2 e HomR(M,,N, ) and 7,71,72 ¢ HomR(M",M"): 
L 
~(CE] + CE']) = ~CE] + ~[E'] 
If. 
([~3 + C~'])a = [~]a + [~']a 
IV. 
[~](~ + a') = [~]~ + [E]~'. 
Proof: 
To define the Baer sum, let El, ~ c ~R(M",M.) 
be given: 
#i 
M" 
> M' 
~! > X 
> 
> O 
> M' ~--> X' #2 > M" --> O.

E 1 • ~

> 0 
is an exact sequence and it is readily verified that 
[E l] = [E I] 
and 
[~] = [~] 
implies 
[E l@E 2] = [EI@~]. 
Therefore we may 
define 
[E 1 ] ~ [~] = [E10~]. 
In (Ex. 1,7) we defined the diagonal 
and the codlagonal maps: 
A : M" 
> M" @ M"; m" ! 
> (m",m"); 
V: M' ~ M' 
> M'; (mi,~) 
% 
> m i + ~. 
Then 
A[EI® ~] V 
~ E~(M",M,). 
NOW we define the Baer sum 
[E l ] + [~]--A[E le~]v 
. 
(5-5) ensures the consistency of this definition. 
We observe that for 
7,~ E HOmR(X,Y ) we have 
(o+,) --Ax(~,)V 
(cf. ~. i,?). 
Y 
Moreover it is easy to verify, using (5.5), that 

118 
II 54 
[EZ¢E2](%ea

a~d 
~

(cf..~.

T...~o prove [: 
7([E]+ [E']) = 7A[E~E'] V = A(TeT)[EeE']V 
= &(7[E]eT[E'])V 
= 7[E] + 7[E']. 
II is proved similarly. 
To prove III: 
We have up to some abuse of notation 
[EeE] = [E(A~,~)], more precisely, 
[EeE] = [E(AM,,Ax,~,,)] 
as is 
easily seen; i.e., with (5.5), 
[&(E~E)] = [E(A,~,IM,,)] = [E]&. 
Similarly, 
V[E] = [E~E]V. 
Thus: 
(7+7')[E] = A(7~7') V [E] 
= ~(~e ~,)[Ee E]V = ~(~[E]ey'[E])V 
= ~[E] + ~'[E]. 
Similarly, for IV. 
It remains to show that this makes 
group.

= A((A~IM,,)[(EI@E2) ®~](V 
~IM,))V 
= ([E 1 ] + [El]) + [~] 
(of. ~. z,?). 
[E O] 
of the split exact sequence is the zero 
ER(M",M') ; in fact, for every 
E ¢ ~R(M",M'), 
[E O] = [E]OM, (cf. (1.15)) and hence 
[E] = [E](I+O M) = [E] + [E o] 
Similarly one shows that for 
-IM, : m' ~ 
> -m', 
we have 
For the proof of

some more abuse of notation - shows 
and since AT = A and ~

we obtain

Proof: 
This is an immediate consequence of the previous 
theorems. 
5.9 Theorem: 
There is a natural equivalence 
~t~(-,M,) ~ ER(-,M,). 
Once this result is established, we have a one-to-one correspon- 
dence between the homomorphisms 
u : ER(M",M') - ~ ER(N",M'), 
[E] . > ~ 
and extl(m,M ') : ExtlR(M",M ') 
> Extl(N",M '), 
for 
u ¢ HomR(N",M' ). We shall use the abbreviations 
u ExtI(M",M ' ) for 
Im(extl(u,M ')), and ExtlR(M",M ')u for Im(extlR(M",=)). 
Proof: 
We ~ construct a map ~ : ExtlR(M",M ') 
> ER(M",M'). 
Since M" ¢ ~, 
there exists an exact sequence 
E 1 : 0 
> y ~> p A > M" 
'> 0 
with 
P c R=P f. 
From (3.10) we obtain the exact sequence

120

since 
Ext~(P,M') = 0 
by (4.2). 
Thus, we obtain an isomorphism

Now, to define

u + Im K* ¢ HomR(Y ,M')/Im ~* be given. 
Then 
[EI]U ¢ ER(M",M'),

if 
U ¢Im K*, then [El]U = O, i.e., [EI]U 
contains a 
split exact sequence. 
But for 
u ¢Im K*, u = ~, 
for some 
B ¢ HomR(P,M'), 
and 
[Ella = [E1](~6) = ([EI]K)B. 
But from

we conclude that 
[EI]~ = [E o] 
and consequently 
[EI]m-- [Eo]; i.e., 
~ 
is well defined. 
(li) 
i is addltive: 
Given 
a + Im ~* 
and 
u' +Im K* in 
HomR(Y,M')/Im ~*, 
then 
[E1](u+m') = [E1]u + [E1]u'; i.e., 
is additive. 
(ill) 
To show that 
~ 
is an isomorphism, we construct a map 
: ER(M",M') 
"> ExtlR(M",M'). 
Given 
E ¢ ~R(M",M'), 
E : O

Then 
a 
is well-defined; indeed, (y~)~ = y~A = O; 
i.e., 
y~ 
e Im $. 
Now we set 
: ER(M",M' )

(i)

[E]a = [Eo], 
then 
Ela splits, 
and so 
a 
factors through 
~ 
(cf. D') and 
a e Im ~*. 
(li) 7) = 1

and 
~

We have 
EXtR(M", M' ) 
~([E]) = @(~-l(a+Imx') ) = [E1]G = [E], by the universal 
property of 
Ela 
(cf. (5.5)). 
Conversely, 
~(a) 
= ~([El]a) = ~-l(~+Im~,) 
where 
~(a) = (a+Im K*). 
This shows that 
ER(M",M') -_ Extl(M",M'). 
Next we show that this is a natural equivalence; i.e., given 
a : N'!

we show that the following diagram is commutative: 
ExtlR(M ", M' ) 
%M"

Let

From (3.6) we obtain the commutative diagram

Chapter III 
MORITA THEOREMS AND SEPARABLE ALGEBRAS 
In this chapter, all rings are assumed to be left and right 
noetherian. 
§l. 
Projective modules and ~enerators 
If S is a commutative ring, B is a left noetherian 
S-algebra and 
C is an S-flat S-algebra, then 
C @S Ext~(M,N) n~t 
Ext~@sB( C @S M,C @S N) 
M,N ¢ B=~. 
We derive the basic properties of the 
for all 
maps 
~M,N :M @S N - > HOms(M,N) 
and TM:M @Ends(M)M 
> S, 
and we prove five properties of modules equivalent to"belng 
a generator'.' A faithful exact functor preserves projective 
modules and generators. 
1.1 Notation: 
Let S 
and T be rings; then S__M = category of 
left S-modules, M S = category of right S-modules, S__M 
f = category of 
pf 
finitely generated left S-modules, S= -- category of finitely gener- 
ated projective left S-modules, S_MT = category of (S,T)-blmodules. 
1.2 
Theorem (Auslander-Goldman Ill): 
Let 
S be a commutative 
ring, B 
and 
C S-algebras. 
Moreover, assume that B 
is left noe- 
therian and that 
C is S-flat; i.e., that 
C @S" is an exact 
functor on S M. 
If M ~ B=~, 
then 
C ®S Ext~(M,N) nat 
Ext~ ®S B(C @S M, C @S N), n = 0,1,2,... 
for every 
N ¢ B=Mf. 

III 2 
125 
Proof: 
B @S C 
is an S-algebra, and by (Ex. 1,3) Ext~(M,N) e S~" 
Define 
: c ®s H°mB(M'N) 
> H~C ®S B(c ®S M, C ®S N) 
by 
e : c @ ~ J 
> (c @ ~)~, 
where 
(c' @m)(c®~) e = c'c @ m~; 
c,c' e C, m e M, ~ e HomB(M,N), 
and extend 
z-llnearly. 
is a natural homomorphism, as is easily seen. 
Claim: 
a 
is an isomorphism. 
If 
M 
is B-free; i.e., M ~ B B(t), 
then we have the commutative 
diagram 
C @S H°mB(BB(t)'N) 
u > Homc ®S B(c ®S B B(t)'C @S N) 
N(t) 
C ®S 
"i C @S N(t) > 
C @S N(t) 
" 
Then 
u 
where the vertical maps are natural isomorphisms and the bottom map 
is the identity. 
Thus 
~ 
is a natural isomorphism for finitely 
generated free left B-modules 
M. 
Now, if 
M e ~=~, 
choose 
F = B B(t) e --B=M 
~ 
such that 
F a-S--> M 
> 0 
is a B-exact sequence. 
Moreover, 
B 
is left noetherlan and hence 
~er ~ ¢ ~M f, 
and we can 
find 
F ' 
( s ) 
f 
= B B 
e B=M 
such that 
F' ' > F 
> M 
• ~ 0 
is an 
exact sequence of left B-modules. 
This sequence gives rise to the commutative diagram with exact 
rows (C is S-flat), 
o 
> c ®s H°mB(M'N) 
0 
> H°mc ®S B(c ®S M, C ®S N) 
-- > C ~S H°mB(F ,N) 
> 
°l 
> H°mc ®S B (C®SF'C®SN) ~> 
---} 
C ~S H°mB(F' ,N) 
> H°mc ~S B (C ~sF', C ~sN). 

126 
III 3 
Since 
a 
and u' 
are isomorphisms, so is a". 
This proves the 
claim. Now let 
Y :"" 
> Pn 
> Pn-1 
> "'"--> P1 
> M 
be a projective resolution of M such that Pi¢ B =Mr 
noetherian). 
Since 
Pi ~ ~f' 
C @S Pie C @S B=Pf; and since 
resolution of C ®S M e C@sB=~: 
> 0 
(B is left 
it follows from Ex. i,i that 
C is S-flat, we obtain a projective 
C@ S Y : ... --> C® S Pn--> C@ S Pn_l --> ... --> C@ S PI--> C @S M--> O. 
Y, C @S Y 
and 
Xl:

give rise to the commutative diagram

Con- 
: 0 
> H°mc @S B(C @S M, C @S N) 
where 
a* is an isomorpb/sm of chaincomplexes (cf. II, (2.1)). 
sequently 
X 1 and 
X 2 have isomorphic homology groups (cf. II, 
(2.10)) ; i.e., 
nat 
~(a) : Hn(C ~s H°~B(Y'N)) 
> Hn(H°mc ~S B(c ®S Y" C ®S ~))" 
The latter homology group is 
Ext~ @S B(C @S M, C @S N) (cf. II, 
(3.4)). 
Since 
C is S-flat, 
Hn(C @S H°mB(Y'N) natc®sHn(H°mB(Y'N)) 
(cf. II, (2.12)). Hence 
Ext~ ~s B(c ®s ~' c ®S N) nat 
= 
C @S Ext~(M,N), n = 0,1,2,... 
# 
1.3 Remarks: 
Let S be a ring; setjfor M e S Mf, O(M)=Ends(M). 
Then M e sM~(M); 
moreover, we put HOms(M,S) = S M , the dual of 
M ~ s ~= and Ho~(~)(~,n(M)) 
= M*n(~). 
* 
For ~ ¢S__M , we define m(~s) : (m~)s, m ¢ M, s ¢ S, 
m(mp) = 
(mm)~, m ¢ M, m ¢ O(M), 
and for $ e M*O(M), (m~)m = 
m(~m), 

III 4 
127 
m e M, '~ e ~(M), (~s)m = #(sm), m e M, s e S; 
then 
sM*, M*n(M) e n(M)Ms. 
In (Ex. I, 3, 5) it has been shown that 
S M* @S M 
is a ring. 
The above definitions show that 
S M* @S M 
is 
also an 
(~Q(M),~(M))-blmodule. 
We shall generally write bimodule 
homomorphisms 
as exponents. 
1.4 
Defl.nitions: 
For M, N ¢ s__M 
f, 
we define 
(i) 
UM, N : S M* @S N .. > HOms(M,N), m(~@n) ~M'N = (m~)n, 
¢ S M*, n • N; 
XM 
(ii) 
Z_~M : M @~(M) S M* 
> S, (m@$) 
= m~, m • M, ~ • S M*, 
or, 
more generally, 
TM, N : M @~(M) H°ms(M'N) 
> N, m @ ~ .~ > m~. 
UM, N 
is a natural homomorphism of 
(~(M),~(N))-bimodules (of. I, 
Ex. 3,5). 
Similarly one shows that 
~M is a natural homomorphism of 
(S,S)-blmodules. 
Thus 
Im UM, N ~ n(M)M~(N) 
Sa%d Im XM • s=Ms" Since 
T M 
is also a ring homomorphism, 
Im XM is a two-sided ideal in 
S. 
In particular, if M = N, 
we write 
~M' 
and 
Im ~M is a two-sided 
~(M) -ideal. 
1.5 
[emma.: Let 
M • s=M f. 
Then 
M 
is projective if and only 
if U M 
is epic. 
Moreover, 
UM, N 
is an isomorphism for every 
N e S__M 
f, 
if U M 
is epic. 
Proof: 
(1) 
If M • s=P f, 
then M 
is the epimorphic image of a 
free left S-module F---- S S(n), F ~--q--> M --> 0. 
Let 
[ei]l<__i<_n be a 
basis of 
F9 
then the set 
[m i :m i = ela}l<_.i<__ 
n 
is a system of gener- 
ators for 
M. 
Since 
M ~ sP f, 
there exists 
@ ¢ HOms(M,F), suchthat 
n 
@c = 1 M. 
If we write 
m@ = 
7~i=isi(m)ei, 
then it is easily checked 
that the 
~i : M 
> S, m ! 
> si(m), i <_ i <_ n, 
belong to 
S M*. 
n 
Moreover, for every 
m • M, 
we have 
m = Zi=l(Va~ i )mi; 
i.e., 
n 
UM 
1 M = (Zi= 1 ~i®mi ) , 
and 
UM is epic, since it is an ~(M)-homo- 
morphism. 

128 
III 5 
(il) Conversely, if 
U M 
is epic, then there exists 
n 
. 
n 
~M 
2i--1 @i @ ml ¢ M 
@S M 
such that 
1M -- (Zl=l ~i @ ml) 
. Obviously, 
the elements 
[ml)l<i< n 
form a system of generators for M. 
Let 
F 
be a free left S-module wlth a basis 
[ei)l<i<_ n 
and define the epi- 
morphism 
a : F ~> 
M 
by 
e i ~ 
> m i, 1 ~ i ~ n. 
Now, 
p :M -->F, 
n 
m I 
> 21= 1 (m)~le i 
is an S-homomorphism such that 
pa = 1M; 
i.e., 
M ¢ S Pf. 
n 
To prove the second part of (1.5), let 
ZI=I ~i @mi c S M* @S M 
n 
~M 
be such that 
(Zi--1 ~I @ ml) 
-- 1 M. 
That 
UM, N 
is an isomorphism 
for every 
N e S__M ~ is established by the map 
n 
~M,N : H°ms(M'N) 
> S M* @S N) ~ ~ 
> El= 1 ~i @ mi¢" 
For, 
VM, N~M, N = iHoms (M, N) 
and 
UM, NVM, N = IsM* ®S N' 
as is easily 
seen. 
In addition, 
VM, N 
is an 
(G(M),n(N))-homomorphlsm.

Lemma: 
If 
T M 
Is epic, then 
T M 
Is an isomorphism; In 
fact, 
TM, N 
is an isomorphism for all 
N ¢ S Mr.= 
Proof: 
If 
TM is epic, then there are elements 
m i ¢ M, 
n 
~i ¢ S M*' i < i < n, 
such that 
i = Zi= 1 mi$ i. 
We now put 
n 
a M : S

that ~M ~M = 1 S and ~M 6-M = IM

I.Z 
Lemma: 
If M ¢ s__P 
f, then 
(Im rM)M = M. 
Proof: 
By (1.5), if 
M 
is projective, then 
3 m i c M, ~i ¢S M*' 
n 
i = l,...,n ) such that 
m = Zl=l(m~i)m i, 
~m e M. 
But 
m~i ~ Im ~M' 
i - l,...,n. 
Hence 
M -- (Ira VM)M. 

III 6

1.8 
Remark: 
It is 
in general 
not true that 
Im x M = S 
if 
¢ S ~f. 
For example, let 
S = Ke @ Ke', e 2 = e, (e') 2 = e', 
M 
ee' = e'e = 0 where 
K 
is a field. 
Then 
S 
is a ring, and 
Ke ¢ S ~f. 
But 
(Ke @ G(Ke)(Ke)*) TKe = Ke.

Definition: 
M ¢ s__M 
f 
is called a ~enerator, if 
Im T M = S, 
M ¢ S=

A progenerator is 
sometimes also called faithfully pro~ectlve (Strooker [1]) or a pro- 
Jective completely faithful module (Endo [1]). 
1.10 Theorem (Strooker [1], Cohn [1]): 
For M 
ing statements are equivalent: 
(ii) 
3 X ¢ S ~f, 
such that 
X @ S S ~ M (n) 
for some positive 
integer n. 
(iii) 
HOms(M,-)

M (n) 
(iv) 
Every 
X e S ~-= is the homomorphic image of 
positive integer n. 
(v) 
(Ira TM)M = M, 
and for every maximal right ideal 
I in S, 
IM# M. 
Proof: 
(1) 
~ (ll): 
Since 
Im TM = S, 3 m i e M, ~i e S M*, 
n 
i = l,...,n, 
such that 
Zi=l mini = i. 
Then we have an epimorphism 
--i=nx 
@ : M(n) 
> S S' (Xi)l<n---~i=l i ~i' and we obtain (ii) 
(ii)====~ (iii): 
It suffices to show that 
hom(1M,%) + O, 
whenever 
# e HOms(X,X. ) is not zero. 
According to (ii) we have 
the exact sequence 
M (n)

which induces the exact commutative diagram

Conversely, let I be a right ideal in S such 
that IM = M. 
Then 0 = M/IM ~ S/I @S M 
(cf. I, (3.18)). 
Thus 
0 = (S/I @S M)(n) ~ S/I @S M(n) ~ S/I @S S @ S/I @S X, 
for some

Thus S/I @S S ~ S/I = 0; 
i.e.,

1.11 Lemma: 
Let S be a commutative ring,

which is faithfully flat as an S-module; i.e., 
B @S- is a faithful

Then M ¢ C ~f is projective

Proof:

f 
is 
a progenerator, there exists a categorical equivalence 
between 
s__M 
f 
and 
Ends(M)M f. 
Various natural isomorph- 
isms are derived. 
As general references we list: 
Auslander-Goldman 
[1], Bass [2], Cohn Ill, Morita [1]. 
2.1 
Theorem (Morita [i]): 
Let 
S be a ring and 
E ¢ S Pf 
a 
progenerator, and write 
G = ~Q(E) = Ends(E). 
Then there exists a 
categorical equivalence between 
s_M f 
and 
G=_Mf: 
hE : s# 
> 
x , > HOms(E,X), 
h E : HOms(X,X') 
> Hom2(HOms(E,X),HOms(E,X')), 
t 
> hom(1E, ~). 
This categorical equivalence is called a Morita equivalence between 
s_M f 
and 
~M f. 
Moreover, it is an order isomorphism; in particular, 
the S-submodules of 
E 
correspond to the left ideals in 
~, 
and the 
(S,~q)-submodules of 
E 
correspond to the two-slded ideals of 
~. 
For greater lucidity, we shall postpone the proof for a moment.

Lemma:

Let 
E ¢ S Pf. 
Then

E

(cf. (1.9)).

S-modules. 
Proof: (1) m) We have the following chain of natural isomorph- 
isms of bimodules: 
S E* 2=~S H°ms(E ®2(S E* @S E),S) JS H°ms(E @2 S E*' H°mS(E'S)) 
2~--S Homo(E, HOms(sE*,sE*)) n~S Horn(E, S E* ®S (sE*)s *) 
~S Hom~(E, S E* @S E) ~% Hom~(E,~) = E~ 
(1.5). 
p) 
By assumption, 
E • X =~S S(n) for some X and n. But 
then S E* @ S x* --'S Homs(S(n), S) ~s(HOms(S,S))(n) -~-S (s)(n) and 
S E* is right S-projective. 
The same holds for E~ by aJ. 
~) 
If E ® X ~ S S(n) for some X E S Pf and some natural 
number n, then 
E (n) ~ HOms(sS(n),E) ]G HOms(E,E) @ HOms(X,E); 
i.e., 
E is a generator in i 
(cf. (1.10)). Similarly it follows 
from ~) that S E* and E~ are generators in ~_f. 
(ii) G) Since E is a left S-generator, there are X ¢ s__M 
f 
and n e N such that E(n)s~ X @S S. Therefore (S E*) (n)~ sX,® 
=S 
S S* 
-- S X* @ S and S E* is indeed a generator. 
p) 
By assumption E(n) S-'- X • S S. Thus 
G(n) ~ HOms(E(n),E) _-- HOms(sS, E) @ HOms(X,E ) =~ E • HOms(X,E); 
i.e., 
E ¢ Pf. Similarly, 
E* ¢ ~Pf is established. 
#

Remark: I. If E e S Pf, we have the following natural 
is omorphisms : 
(1) 
s E* 
=  ds(E), 
(ii) 
~ = Ends(E ) ring= sE* @S E

(lii) 
E ®@~ E~ ring= End~ (E) 
(cf. (2.27, (1.10)), 
(iv) 
E s:n ~(s E ) 
II. If E e S=M f is a generator, we have the following natural 
isomorphisms : 

134 
III ii 
(i) 
S r~ng E @~ S E* 
D 
(ii) 
E ®f E~ r~ng= End2(E). 
III. Combining these isomorphism, we obtain for a progenerator 
M f 
the following natural isomorphisms:

where 
~(E) = HOms(M,M ) and 
fl(N) = HOms(N,N) 
(cf. (1.5)). 
Now we turn to the proof of (2.1): Let 
E ¢ S Pf be a generator. 
From (i.i0) and (2.2) it follows that the following functors are 
faithful: 
hE: S ~f - 
HOms(N,N') 
and 
tE: ~_~ ' 
Homf (M, M' ) 
We shall show that

It should be observed that,in order to show 
hEtE(N) 
only used the fact that

whereas for

This shows that the functor 
h E = HOrns(E,- ) is a categorical iso- 
morphism. 
Now, let 
M' c S M; 
i.e., let 
M' 
be an S-submodule of M. 
Then the exact sequence 
0

induces 
the exactness of the sequence of left ~-modules 
0

and 
hE(M ' ) is a left n-submodule 
of 
hE(M). 
In particular, if 
M = E, 
then 
hE(M ') 
is a left ~-ideal 
and if, in addition, 
M ¢ S=~'" it is clear that 
hE(M) 
is a 
two-sided ideal in

Remark: 
It should be observed that

(2.1) is also a Morita equivalence (cf. (2.2)). 
2.5 
Remark: 
(2.1) also holds for

§3 Norm and trace 
This section is a survey of trace, norm, discriminant 
and dual bases of finite dimensional algebras over a field. 
K 
denotes a field and A 
a finite dimensional K-algebra; 
i.e., 
A 
is a ring, which is at the same time a finite 
dimensional K-vectorspace. 
3.1 Definitions: 
Let 
a ¢ A. 
Then 
~a : A 
> A, x |' >ax, 
is a linear transformation of A 
as a K-module. 
Let 
(aij)l<i,j~n 
be the matrix of 
~a relative to some fixed K-basls 
[Wi)l<_i< n 
of 
A 
and let 
X be an indeterminate over K. 
Then we define 
PCA/K(a,X) = det(XE n - (aij)), 
where ~n 
is the 
(n x n) 
identity 
matrix, to be the characteristic polynomial of 
a e A 
with respect 
to____K. TrA/K(a) = tr(alj) = ~i=l aii 
is called the trace of 
a ¢ A 
over K, 
and 
NA/K(a) = det(aij) 
is the norm of 
a c A 
over K. 
The matrix 
(TrA/K(WiWj))l~i,j~n = -~A/K (Wl'''''Wn) 
is called 
the dlscriminant matrlx of the basis 
{~i }l<__i<__n Q~ A 
over K~ and 
DA/K(Wl,...,w n) = det(~A/K(W 1 .... ,Wn)) 
is called the discriminant of 
the basis 
[~i ] ]<_i<_n of A 
over K. 
Since 
A 
is finite over K, 
A 
is integral over K 
(cf. I, 
(5.4)) and thus 
a e A 
satisfies a monic polynomial with coeffici- 
ents in K; 
because 
K[X] 
is a Euclidean domain there is a unique 
monlc 
polynomial minA/K(a,X ) of minimal degree in K[X], 
which 
has 
a ~ A 
as a root, the minimum DOlynomial of 
a ~ A 
over 
K. 
3.Z 
Lemma: 
For 
a e A, PCA/K(a,X), TrA/K(a) 
and NA/K(a) are 
independent of the chosen basis. 
If 
{Will<i< n 
and {wl]l~i<n are 
two bases of A 
over K, 
and if B 
is the matrix of the linear 
transformation w i t 
> wl, 1 < i < n, 
relative to the basis 

138 
III 15

B t 
Then 
~A/K(WI" 
'Wn)Bt = ----'DA/K(WI' 
' n 
e.. 
~ 
e o a  
Wt)f 
is the transposed matrix of 
B. 
Thus the vanishing of the 
discrlminant of any basis is a property of the algebra 
A 
over 
K 
alone. 
n 
Proof: 
Let 
w~ = T j= 1 ~iJ wj. 
If =A and 
A'are= the matrices of 
f 
~a 
for 
a c A, 
relative to the bases 
{Wi}l<i< n 
and 
[Wi]l~i~ n 
resp., then =A' = B: A B__ 
-I. 
Thus 
PCA/K(a,X)[wi } = det(XE 
n= - A)= 
= det(B(XEn - A)B -1) : det(XEn-A' ) = PCA/K(a, X) {w~}" 
If 
PCA/K(a'X) ~- xn + ~-i xn-i +'''+ ko' 
then it is easily seen 
that 
3.2' 
TrA/K(a) = -k_l 
and 
NA/K(a) = (-l)nko • 
Thus the norm and trace are independent of the particular underlying 
basis. 
The formula for the discrimlnant is verified by a straight- 
forward computation. 
3.3 
Lemma (Cayley-Hamilton): Let 
a ~ A; 
then 
PCA/K(a,a ) = 0. 
Proof: 
Since we have an isomorphism 
A ~-Y--> A L = HomA(AA, AA), 
a -->~a' 
it suffices to show that 
PCA/K(a , (aij)l<i,j<n) = 0 
where 
(aij)l<i,j< n 
is the matrix of the linear transformation 
~a 
relative to some fixed basis. 
Let 
~ = (alj)l<i,j< n. 
The following 
formula is easily checked by "multiplying out": 
~_-~n - Ai = (~-l_~+ ~-2A+...+A__i-1)(XE=n_A)) 
for every natural number 
i. 
We write this as 
n 
xl~ 
. ~l = ~l(x)(x~ ~ _ £). 
~ow 
Pc(~,x) -- aet(Nn- ~) = ~i=l ki xi~ 
k n = +i. 
Let =A(X) be the matrix of the cofactors of 
XE n - = 
A 
(cf. proof of I,(5.2)). 
Then 
A(X)(X~= -~_) = Pc(A,X)= 
= 
- _~. 
Thus

Pc(A,A) = Ei--i 
Zi=l kl Xi~n - Zl--i kl B-I(X) (Xi~ - ~"

But 
(Zi=lk i 
= 
= Pc(A,X) • E n = A(X)(XE= n - A). 
Hence 
Pc(A,A) = A(X)(X~__n - A) - ~i=lki B---i(X)(XEn - A~, 
Pc(A,A)_ 
_ 
= (A(X) _ Zi=ln kiBi(X))(~=n.~ - A)_. 
Since the left hand side is independent of 
X, 
the right hand side 
has to be zero.

Corollar?/: 
For 
a ~ A, minA/K(a,X) 
divides 
PCA/K(a,X). 
Proof: 
This is an immediate consequence of (3.3). 
3.5 
Lemma: 
If 
(A :K) = n, 
then, for 
a ¢ A, 
PCA/K(a,X) 
divides 
(minA/K( a, X) )n. 
Proof: 
Let A 
be the matrix of ~a 
relative to some fixed 
basis; then it suffices to show that 
Pc(A,X) 
divides 
min(A,X) n. 
Let 
min(A,X) = f(X) = Zt=l k i ~. 
We define recurslvely the matrlces 
~-i 
= 
kt " ~En 
-4-2 = kt-l

B O 
= 
k I • E n + AB.1. 
t-i

Then 
0 -- f(A) -- ~i=l(AB__i_l - Ai+lBi ) + ~t~t_ 1 + ko~. 
Thus 
koE n 
-=AB__o. If we now put 
~(X) 
t-1 ~ ,  
= 
= Zi= O 
then 
(X~. -__A)B(X) 
= f(X) • E n, 
as one checks easily. 
Taking determinants of this 
matrix equation, we obtain 
Pc(A_,X) • det(B=_(X)) = (f(X)) n. 
# 
3.6 
Definition: 
Let 
A 
be a K-algebra• 
An (associative) 
bilinear form 
f 
is a map 
f :A×A 
> K 
such that 
f(a+b,c) = f(a,c) + f(b,c), f(a,b+c) = f(a,b) + f(a,c), 
f(ka, b) = f(a, kb) = kf(a,b), f(ab, c) = f(a, bc). 
f 
is said to be 
non-degenerate if 
f(x,A) = 0 
implies 
x = 0. 
An example of such a 
bilinear form is 
TrA/K : A × A 
> K, TrA/K : (a,b) 
> TrA/K(ab). 
Tr 
is non-degenerate if and only if the dlscrlminant of some K-basis 

140 
llI 17 
of A is different from zero. 
3.7 
Lemma: 
Let A be a K-algebra, and f :A×A 
> K a non- 
degenerate bilinear form. 
If 
[wi}~i<n 
is a K-basis of A, 
then 
there exists a so-called dual basis with respect to f, {W~]l<~_<n,~_~ 
f(wl,w 
= 5ij 
n 
n 
(ii) 
if wia = El= I kij ws, 
then 
a w~ = El= I kji w~- 
Moreover, the discr~mlnant of 
{wi} relative to f 
det(f(wi, wj) ) ~ O. 
Conversely, if 
f is a billnear form such that, 
for some K-basis 
[Wi]l<_i< 
n 
of A~ the discriminant relative to f 
is different from zero, then the same is true for any K-basis of A. 
Proof: 
Since 
f is non-degenerate, 
det(f(wl,wj)) ~ 0 
(cf. Ex. 3,6), 
and hence 
(f(wi, wj))l<_i,j< n 
is invertible. 
Let 
n 
o 
(kij)l<_i,j<_ n = [(f(wi,wj))l<_i,j<n ]-l and set w~ -- Zj= 1 kji wj. 
Then 
{w~]l<i~ n 
is a K-basis for A 
and f(wi,w~)= 5ij. 
(ii) follows 
from an easy computation. 
The remainder is proved as in (3.2). 
3.8 
Remark: 
The dual bases of a K-basis 
{Wi)l~i< n with 
respect to different non-degenerate bilinear forms may very well be 
dlfferent.

Be-ideal. 
Proof: 
Let 
E i x i e y~P ¢ Ker ~; i.e., 
E i xiY i = 0; 
then 
Ei xi ~ Yi°P = Ei[(xi@loP)(l@yOp_yi@loP)].i

4.3 
Definition: 
Let 
M c Be=M; a derivation of 
M 
(crossed 
homomorphism ) is an S-homomorphism 
~ : B 
> M, 
with 
(xy) ~ = (x®l°P)y ~ + (l~y°P)x $ 
or 
(xy)m = x(y ~) + (x$)y. 
(Deri- 
vations are written as exponents.) 
A derivation 
~ 
of 
M 
is called an inner derivation# if, for 
some 
m ¢ M, x ~ = (x®l°P)m - (l@x°P)m 
(or 
x ~ = xm - reX), 
xcB. 
The S-module of all derivations of 
M 
is denoted by 
Der(B,M), 
the 
S-module of all inner derivations by 
InDer(B,M).

Lemma: 
~o : B 
> Ker e, x I 
> x ® i °p - I ® x °p 
is a 
derivation. 
Proof: 
Obviously, 
~o 
is an S-homomorphism. 
Moreover, (xy) ~° 
= xy ® 1 °p - 1 ® (xy) °p -- xy ® 1 °p - i~ y°Px°P = (x@l°P)y ~° 
+ (i @ yop)Z°.

4.5 
Theorem: 
Let M e 
=M. Then we have a natural isomorphism 
B e 
~M : H°%e(Ker a,M) 
~ > Der(B,M); a J 
> ~o a. 
Proof: 
~o ~ : B 
> M 
is a derivation, since ~o 
is one, and 
if ~o ~ = ~o~; ~,~ e HO%e(Ker ~,M) 
then 
(x@l°P-l@x°P)a 
= (x@l°P-l@x°P)6, 
Vx ¢ B; 
hence 
a = B by 
(4.2). 
It remains to show that any given 
$ e Der(B,M) 
can be fac- 
tored through 
~o" 
Given 
~, 
we define 
a :Ker e 
> M, 
op 
= O. 
This is 
Ei xi ® Yi 
~---> -Zi(xl @ l°p) (Yl 
~)' 
for Z i xlY i 
obviously an S-homomorphism. 
But it is also Be-linear, as is easily 
verified. 
Moreover, 
x $ - x ~°e = x $ - (x@l °p-l~x°p)m=x 
~-x ~=0; 
hence 
$ = $o a. 
(Observe that a derivation takes value 0 on 1.) 
That ~ 
is natural follows simply from the fact that 
~M coin- 
cides with 
hom 
(@o, lM), 
with codomain restricted to the image. 
S 
For a e HO%e(M , M') 
we have 
hOms ($°'iM)h°%e (IB,~) =hom S ($°'a) 
= hO%e(iKer ~ - ,a)hom S (@o, lM,); 
hence the following diagram, where 
denotes the appropriate restriction of hO%e(~,~), 
commutes: 
Hom 
(Ker e M) 
B e 
\ 
Dar(B,M) 
hom(iKe r a, a ) 
> HinBe(Ker ~M"g'M') 
> Der(B,M' ) 

III 22 
145 
4.6 
Lemma: 
a ¢ HomBe(Ker s,M) 
can be extended to 
~' ¢ HO%e(Be,M) 
if and only if 
$o a 
is an inner derivation; i.e., 
In Der(B,M) 
is isomorphic to the image of the natural restriction 
map 
M ~ HomBe(Be, M ) 
> HomBe(Ker a,M). 
Proof: 
Clearly 
a : Ker ~ 
> M 
can be extended to a Be-map 
~' : B e .... > M 
if and only if for some fixed 
m ¢ M, 
op 
op 
op 
(~i xi ®yi )~ = ~i(xi @yi )m, 
~ ~i xi @ Yi 
¢ Ker a. 
But this is 
equivalent to the condition that, for some 
m c M, $o a : B 
> M; 
x I 
> (x~l °p-l@x°p)G 
= (x@l°P)m - (l~x°P)m; 
i.e., that $o a 
be an inner derivation.

Definition: (i) 
B 
is called separable# if B ~Be~f; i.e., 
if the exact Be-sequence 
E : 0

e > B 
> 0 
splits. 
(Observe that 
B e Be=M f, 
via 
(x@y°P)b = xby 
.) 
(ii) 
For M ¢ BeM f, 
we define the n-th cohomology ~roup of M 
as 
Hn(B,M) = EXt~e(B,M), n = 1,2,... 
(of. II,(3.4,i)), 
(cf. Hochschild [I]). 
Example: 
Let 
S be a commutative ring and G 
a finite group. 
Let 
SG = ~geG Sg. 
We make 
SG 
into an S-algebra by defining 
g' EgeG Sgg = Zg~GSg(g'g), Sg ¢ S, g' e G; 
and extending 
S- 
linearly. 
SG is called the group algebra of 
G 
over 
S. 
4.8 
Theorem (Higman [i]): 
If 
S 
ring and 
G 
a finite group such that 
SG 
is a separable S-algebra. 
Proof: 
To show that the sequence 
is a commutative noetherian 
IGI" 1 
is a unit in 
S, 
then 
E 
in (4.7) splits, we define 
0 : SG 
~ SG e by 
I 
. > (IGI.I)-I(Eg~G g-l®gOp), 
and extend 
SG--linearly. 
It is now easily verified that 
0 
is an SGe-map 
and that 
ps 
= ISG. 
4.9 
Remark: 
The exact sequence 
E 
of (4.7,1) yields, for

4.10 
Lemma: 
B 
is separable if and only if 
~o 
of (4.4) is an 
inner derivation. 
Proof: 
Because of (4.9) it suffices to show that every deri- 
vation is inner if 
~o 
is inner. 
But if 
~o 
is inner then so is 
~o a 
for every 
a ¢ HO%e(Ker ¢,M), 
and hence, by (4.6) 
~* is epic 
and 
InDer(B,M) = Der(B,M). 
# 
Next we shall show that the cohomology groups 
Hn(B,-) 
are 
related to 
Ext,(-,-).

Theorem:

M,N ¢ B M f, 
such that 
Ext~(N,M) =

O. 
Make 
HOms(N,~) - with the 
morphisms written on the left - into a Be-mo -

for 
x,y c B, p ¢ HOms(N~). 
HU(B, HOms(N,M) ) nat= Extn(N,M),= n = 1,2, .... 
Then 
Proof: 
The proof for arbitrary 
n 
may be found in Cartan- 
Eilenberg [1], Ch. IX, (4.4). 
We shall give a proof for 
n = l, 
which is the most interesting case for our purpose. 
Extl(N,M) 
con- 
sists of congruence classes of short exact B-sequences 
E : 0 
> M 
> M 
> X 
> N 
> O, 
which split over 
S, since 
Extsl(N,M) = O 
(of. 11(5.9)). 
We define a map 
[ : Der(B, HOms(N,M) ) 
> ~(N,M), $ I 
> E$, 
(el. II,(5.1), 

III 24 
147 
111,(4.3)), where 
E~ ¢ B=M is defined as follows: 
we put 
X$=MeN 
as S-module, and define the action of b e B by 
b(m,n) = (bm+(b$)(n),bn). 
Since 
~ ~ Der(B, HOms(N,M)), X~ ¢ B=M, 
(of. Ex. ~,i), and the canonical S-maps 
M 
t > M • N 
and 
M ¢ N 
> N 
are in fact B-homomorphisms. 
Thus 
E$ : 0 
> M 
> X$ 
> N 
> 0 ~ ~(N,M) 
(cf. Ex. 4,2). 
If 
c InDer(B, HOms(N,M)) , 
then b $ = -bp + pb, 
for some p c HOms(N,M) 
(cf. (4.3)), and we define 
@ : N 
> X~, n J 
> (p(n),n). 
Then 
b(n@) = b(p(n),n) = (b~(n)+bp(n),bn) = (p(bn),bn) 
and 
(bn)@ = (p(bn),bn); i.e., 
@ ¢ HomB(N,X ~) 
such that 
~n = 1 N. 
Thus 
E~ 
is a split exact sequence. 
If, conversely, 
E~ is a split exact sequence, then there 
exists 
X E HomB(N,X~) 
such that X~ = 1 N. 
Hence, for every n e N, 
X : n .~ > (p(n),n), 
where 
p(n) 
is easily seen to be an S-homo- 
morphism from N 
to M. 
But X 
is B-linear; i.e., 
(p(bn),bn) = (bp(n) +b~(n),bn). 
Hence b~(n) = p(bn) - bp(n), 
n ¢ N; 
i.e., 
~ is an inner derivation. 
We leave it as an exercise to show that ~ 
is a Z-homomorphism. 
From the above proved properties it follows that _~ induces a 
Z-monomo rp hi sm 
: Der(B, Homs(N,M))/InDer(B, Homs(N,M)) --> ~(N,M) 
(cf. II,(5.1) and proof of II,(5.7)). 
To show that 
~ 
is an epi- 
morphism, let 
E : 0 
> M 
q > X 
~ > N 
> 0 ~ ~(N,M). There is 
an S-module map 
@ : X ~ > M • N. 
We use this to make 
M • N 
into 
a left B-module by defining b(m,n) = 9(b(9-1(m,n))). 
Then the map 
9 : X 
> M • N becomes a B-isomorphism. 
Since 
E 
is congruent to 
the split sequence in Es(N,M ) 
(of. II,(5.1)), 
the following diagram 
is commutative : 

148 
11125 
X 
0 
~> M ~
I
~
N
 
> 0 
M~N 
where 
~ and ~ 
are the S-injection and S-projection respectively. 
Under our definition of M ® N ¢ ~ 
it is easily checked that 
~ and 
are also B-homomorphisms. 
Hence the sequence 
E is equivalent to 
the exact sequence 
E': 0 
' > M 
~ > M e S N 
~ > N 
> 0 c %(N,M). 
And, to finish the proof, it suffices to show that 
E' = [(~) 
for 
some 
~ e Der(B, Homs(N,M)). 
Since 
MS 
is a B-submodule of M ~S N, 
we must have 
b(m,O) = (bm, O) 
in M • S N, 
hence 
b(m,n) = (bm+~(b,n),bn). 
From the B-module properties of M • S N, 
it follows now easily that for every b ¢ B, ~(b,-) : N 
> M is an 
S-homomorphlsm, and that b i 
> ~(b,-) 
is a derivation. 
This 
proves that ~ is a Z-isomorphism. 
We leave the verification of the 
naturality of 
~ 
as an exercise. 
Thus by (II, (5-9)), 
ExtI(N,M) -_- Der(B, Homs(N,M ))/InDer(B,HOmS(N,M)), 
and by (4.9) 
ExtI(N,M) --- RI(B, HOms(N,M)). 
#

If B 
is separable, then 
ExtI(N,M) = 0

2eRarable algebras 
Wedderburn's theorem is stated, and it is shown, 
that separable algebras are semi-simple and remain 
separable under extensions of the ground field. 
In this section, 
K 
is a field and 
A 
a finite dimensional 
K-algebra. 
5.1 
Definitions: 
(i) 
A 
is said to be a semi-simple K-algebra, 
if 
rad A = O. 
(ii) 
A 
is said to be a separable K-alsebra, if the sequence 
E : 0--> Ker £ --> Ae ~--->A--> 0 
is a split exact 
Ae-sequence. 
5.2 
Theorem: 
If 
A 
is semi-simple, then every 
M c A~ f can be 
expressed uniquely up to isomorphism as a direct sum of simple left 
A-modules (cf. I, (4.5)). 
We shall show even more than that: 
5.3 
Theorem: 
Let 
S 
be a ring which is left artinian and left 
noetherian and such that 
rad S = 0. 
Then there exists only a finite 
number of non-isomorphic simple left S-modules; a complete set of 
them is given by the non-isomorphic minimal left ideals of 
S. 
Moreover, every 
M c S Mr= is projective and can be expressed uniquely 
up to isomorphism as a direct sum of simple left S-modules. 
For the proof we shall show first 
Lemma: 
If 
N c S~ f 
is a direct sum of simple left 
5.4 
S-modules, and if X c N, 
then 
X 
is a direct summand of 
N. 
n 
Proof: 
Let 
X c N, 
where 
N = ~i=l Mi 
is a direct sum of the 
simple left S-modules 
[Mi]l~i~n, 
and let 
il,...,i ~ be a maximal 
subset of 
1,...,n 
such that the sum X + ~=l Mij is direct. 
If 
for some 
k # il,...,i , 
(X @(~=l Mij)) N M k = 0, 
then the set 
il,...,i~, would not be maximal (cf. I, (1.9)). 
Thus, for every 

11128 
151 
k ~ il,...,i , 
(X~(~__ I Mij)) N ~ 
-- M k. 
M k being simple, hence 
X ~ ~=I Mij = N. 
# 
We now turn to the proof of (5.3): We shall show at first, that 
S S 
is a direct sum of a finite number of simple left S-modules; i.e., 
minimal left ideals. 
Since 
S S 
is artinian there exists a finite 
family 
[l ill<i< n 
of maximal left ideals of S 
such that 
0 = rad S -- 0 [I c S S : I maximal) 
n 
= 
0i__l I i (cf. Ex.5,12). 
Let ~i : S S m> sS/Ii , 1 < i < n, 
be the canonical homomorphism. 
Then the map 
: S S --> ~i=l S/Ii' 
s ~--> (s~i)l<_i_<n 
is a monomorphism (cf. I, (2.4)). 
From (5.4) and the validity of the 
Krull-Schmidt-theorem (cf. I, (4.10)), we conclude, that 
S S 
is iso- 
morphic to a direct sum of a finite number of simple left S-modules 
of the form S/I, 
where 
I 
is a maximal left ideal. 
Let 
r 
S S = ~i=l Ji be the decomposition of S S 
into minimal left ideals 
Ji ] l<i 
Mf 
[ 
_ ~r, 
and let M e S= 
be simple. 
Then, for 
0 # m c M, 
we 
r 
have 
M -- Sm = ~i=l Ji m, 
and hence there exists exactly one 
i, 
1 _< i <r, 
such that 
M = Ji 
TM. 
Since 
M 
and 
Ji are simple left 
S-modules, 
M -" Ji; i.e., every simple left S-module is isomorphic 
to a minimal left ideal of S, 
which is a direct summand of S S, 
whence every simple left S-module is projective. 
Moreover, since the 
Jordan-H'~ider theorem (I, (4.6), I, (4.7)) is valid for s=M f, 
every 
M f 
M ¢ S= 
is projective, and it has a unique expression as a direct 
sum of simple left S-modules, as follows from the Krull-Schmidt 
theorem (I, (4.10)). 
5.5 
Corollar~ (Wedderburnts structure theorem): 
Let A 
be a 
semi-simple K-algebra. 
Then 

152 
III 29 
(i) There is only a finite number of non-isomorphic simple left 
A-modules, 
M1,...,M n. 
(ii) Ar~ng~=l(Di)ni, 
where 
D i = EndA(Mi) 
is a skewfield, 
1 ~ i ~ n, 
and the 
{(Di)ni]l<i<n 
are the only minimal two-slded 
ideals in A. 
Moreover, the D~ are uniquely determined by A, 
up 
~ ~n 
(ni~ 
to ring isomorphism, and•A 
= ~i=l Mi 
(iii) 
(Di)ni 
is a simple K-al6ebra, 
1 ~ i ~ n; 
i.e., 
a 
semi-simple K-algebra with only one simple left module. 
Conversely, 
every simple K-algebra is isomorphic to a full matrix ring over a 
finite dimensional skewfield over K. 
Proof: 
(i) 
follows readily from (5.3). 
(n i ) 
(ii) We write 
A A = ~i=l Mi 
where 
[Mi]l<_i~n are the non-isomorphic minimal left ideals in A 
(cf. (5.3))." Then M = @~=I Mi is a pro generator for A~ f 
(cf. 
(I.i0)). 
Moreover, since HomA(Mi,Mj) = 0, 
if i # J, M i and Mj 
nat 
n 
Di, 
where 
being simple, 
EndA(M)r~ng ~i=l EndA(Mi) = ~i=l 
D i = EndA(Mi) 
is a skewfield of finite dimension over K 
(cf. I, 
Ex. 4,3), 
since A 
is a finite dimensional K-algebra. 
By (2.1), 
we have a Morita equivalence between A~ f and D=M f, where 
n 
D i as ring (cf. I, Ex. ~,7); in particular, 
D = ~i=l 
N 
Ar~ng EndD(M) 
(of. (2.3)). 
But each Mi, 1 ~ i ~ n, 
is in a natural way a right D-module: 
nat 
md i = m(dl,...,dn) m ¢ M i. Hence 
EndD(M) ~ ~,J=l H°mD(Mi'Mj) = 
~i=l EndDi(Mi) 
(cf. Ex. 5,1). 
Since 
D i is a skewfleld, 
(m i ) 
= D i 
(cf. Ex. 5,2) 
and EndDi(Mi)r~ng (Di)mi 
(cf. Ex. 5,3). 
Mi ~i Di 

III 30 
153 
nat. 
Thus Ar~nJ~=l(Di)mi. 
Counting the dimensions over K, 
we find, 
if s i = (D i : K), then 
(M i : K) = s i • m i . 0n the other hand, if 
A = ~i=lAi , where A i ~ (Di)ml, 1 ~ i ~ n, 
then

Hence 
A A = ~=iMi 
, implies 
M i 
if i = J 
A i = M~ ni) 
as left modules; i.e., 
sim ~ = simini; 
hence m i = n i. 
A i 
Obviously, the 
[Ai]l<i~n are two-sided ideals in A; and if 
I is 
another two-sided ideal in A, 
then 
I 
is isomorphic to a direct 
sum of some of the [AiSl<i<n, 
since the only two-sided ideals in 
n 
(Di)ni 
[(Di)niSl<i< n 
~i=l 
are direct sums of some of the 
m 
(cf. Ex. 5.4). 
If A ~ 
~=l (D~)k i where 
[D~Sl<i< t 
are finite 
ring 
-- 
- -  
dimensional skewfields, 
then A A= ~=i Ni 
(cf. Ex. 5.4), 
where 
the N i are simple left A-modules. 
Thus, t = n , 
k i = n i 
(if 
necessary after renumbering the 
[Ni)l<i~n ) and 
N i ~ M i. 
Since 
EndA(N i) ~ D~ 
(cf. Ex. 5.4), the uniqueness of the decomposition is 
established. (cf. I,(4.10), the Krull-Schmidt theorem). 
(iii) 
is now an ~mmediate consequence of the proof of (ii). # 
5.6 
Definitions: 
Let 
S be a ring. 
An element 
0 # e e S 
is called an idempotent, 
if 
e 2 = e; 
e is called a central idempo- 
tent, if e 
lies in the center of S, 
e 
is said to be primitive, 
if e = e I + e2, ele 2 = e2e I = 0, where 
e~ = el, 
i = 1,2, implies 
e I = 0 or e 2 = O. 
Two idempotents 
e I 
and 
e 2 
are called equiva- 
lent if Se I ~ Se 2 as left S-modules. 
A set 
[ei]l<i< n

idempotents, if each 
e i

1 = ~=lel 
and 
eie j = O 
if i # J. 
Similar definitions hold in a selfexplanatory 

154 
III 31 
way for central idempotents. 
5.7 
Lemma: 
Let 
A 
be a semi-simple K-algebra. 
An Idempotent 
e 
in A 
is primitive if and only if Ae 
is a simple left A-module; 
conversely, every simple left A-module is isomorphic to Ae 
for some 
primitive idempotent 
e. 
There exists a unique decomposition 
n 
= __ 
~=lei 
into orthogonal primitive central idempotents in A. 
Moreover, 
Ae i ~ (Di)ni 
is a simple K-algebra, 
1 ~ i ~ n, 
and if 
e i = 
eij, i < i < n, 
is a decomposition of 
e i 
into orthogonal 
primitive idempotents, then 
eij 
is equivalent to 
ekh 
if and 
only if 
i = k . 
Proof: 
From (5.5, ii)it follows, that 
A = ~i=l Ai' 
where 
A i ~ (Di)nl 
is a decomposition of A 
into minimal two-sided ideals 
in A. 
Let 
~i : A--> Ai, 1 ~ i ~ n, 
be the corresponding ring 
projections (cf. I, Ex. ~,7) and put 
e i = ~i(1), 1 ~ i ~ n. 
Then 
the 
[ei]l<i~n 
form a complete set of orthogonal primitive central 
a complete 
idempotents (cf. I, (i.i0)). 
If also 
(e~]l<i<3~ 
were 
set of orthogonal primitive central idempotents, then 
~n

1 = 
= ~ 
e~, 
and 
e 1 
=lel 
= 
= 
. 
--J=l ~ 
=i elei 
=I elej 
Since 
ele ~ 
lles in the center of A 
it is a central idempotent; 
and since 
e I 
is a primitive central idempotent, there exists 
exactly one 
J, 
say 
J = l, 
such that 
ele I = e I 
and 
ele ~ = 0, 
2 ~ J ~m. 
A similar argument shows that 
e I = elel; 
i.e., e I = e I. 
Continuing in this way, we conclude 
n = m 
and 
(ei)l~i~ n = (e~]l<j< 
m . _  
It follows from (5.3), that every simple left A-module 
M 
is 
isomorphic to a direct summand 
M' 
of A A. 
If ~ : AA--> M' 
is 
the projection, then 
(1)N = e 
is an idempotent, since 
((1)N)~ = e 
and 
((1)N)w = (e)N = e(1)N = e 2. 
Moreover, 
M' ~AAe 
and 
e 
is 
primitive since 
M w is simple. 
On the other hand, if 
e 
is a 

III 52 
155 
primitive idempotent and AAe 
were not simple, then 
AAe = M I • ~ 
, M i # O, i = 1,2, 
and thus, 
e 
could not be primi- 
tive. 
The rest of the statements follow now easily from the proof 
of (5.5), and the details are left as an exercise (cf. Ex. 5,4). 
#

Remark: 
Whereas the decomposition into orthogonal primitive 
central idempotents is unique, this is not necessarily true for the 
decomposition into orthogonal primitive idempotents.

Theorem: 
Let 
A 
be a separable K-algebra. 
Then 
A 
is 
semi-simple, and for every extension field 
L 
of 
K, 
A L = L @K A 
is a separable L-algebra. 
Proof: 
From the definition (4.7) we conclude that 
EXt~e(A,X) = O, V X cAe ~ 
(cf. II, (4.2)). 
Hence, by (4.9) 
Ext~(M,N) = O, 
V M,N CA~ f, and thus 
M e A Pf= (cf. II, Ex. 4,2). 
This holds in particular for A/rad A, O-~rad A--)A--~A/rad A--~O 
then implies that 
A A = tad A • X. 
From Nakayama's lemma (I,(4.18)) 
it follows that 
X = A; 
i.e., rad A = 0 
and A 
is semi-simple. 
If 
now 
L 
is an extension field of 
K, 
we obtain the split exact 
sequence (cf. II, (1.7)) 
E L : 0--> L e K Ker c --> L @K Ae --> AL--> 0 
induced from the sequence 
E 
in (5.1). 
But 
L ~A e ~ AL @L(AL)°P = (AL)e; 
i.e., 
A L ¢ 
=~ 
(AL) e 
, and thus 
A L 
is 
separable.

§6. 
Splitting Fields 
Separable algebras over a field have finite 
dimensional splitting fields. 
Central simple 
algebras are separable. 
The center of a 
separable algebra is the image of the Gasch~tz- 
Casimir operator. 
In this section, 
K 
is a field and A 
is a finite dimensional 
K-algebra. 
6.1 Definition: 
If A 
is 
semi-simple, an extension field 
L 
of K 
is called a splittin~ field for A, 
if A L ~e~=l(L)ni 
(el. (5.5)). 
6.2 
Lemma: 
There are no finite dimensional skewfields over an 
algebraically closed field. 
Proof: 
We recall, that an algebraically closed field is one, 
over which every polynomial decomposes completely into linear factors 
(cf. Ex. 6,1). 
Now, let 
L be an algebraically closed field and D 
a finite dimensional skewfield over L. 
Then d ¢ D 
is the root of 
a monic polynomial 
f(X) ¢ L[X] 
(cf. I, (5.4)). 
Since 
L 
is 
algebraically closed, 
f(X) = ~=l(X - ~i) , a i ¢ L. 
But 
0 = f(d) = W~=l(d - ai) 
implies 
d = a i 
for some 
i ~ i ~ n, 
since 
D 
is skewfield; 
i.e., 
D c L. 
# 
6.3 
Theorem: 
Let A 
be a separable K-algebra. 
Then there 
exist splitting fields for A. 
The proof follows from (5.5) and (6.2). 
In factj every algebrai- 
cally closed extension of K is a splitting field for A.

Theorem: 
Let 
D 
be a finite dimensional central skewfield 
over 
K. 
Let 
L 
be a (commutative) subfield of 
D, 
with (L:K) = s 1. 
Then 
L e k D ~ 
(DI)sl 
rings 
, where 
D 1 
is a central skewfield over 
L. 
Moreover, if 
L 
is a maximal subfield of 
D, 
then 
L 
is a splitting 
field for 
D 
and 
(D : K) = (L : K) 2. 
Proof: 
We view 
D ¢ L=~, 
where the action of 
L 
on 
D 
is left 
multiplication; we write 
L D 
for this L-module, and define a map 
: L @K D--> EndL(D), ~ @ d| 
> (%®d) ~, 
where 
d'(4@d) ~ = %d'd 
for 
d' ¢ L D. 
It is easily checked that 
~ 
is a 
ring homomorphism, and 
i ¢ Imp. 
Clearly~ Ker ~ - O; 
i.e., 
: L ekD-C" > 7m~. 
We denote 
Im~ by 
S. 
Then 
D ~ =~ , and we 
write 
D S 
for this module. 
Since 
L D ¢ L ~f 
is a progenerator 
for 
J 
(cf. (i.i0)), and since 
S c EndL(LD), 
Ends(Ds) D EndEndL(LD)CLO) 
= L 
(cf. (Z.4)). 
Moreover, 
1 c L 
implies 
SmEndD(D D) =~ 
where 
D r denotes right multiplication b M the elements in D. 
Now, 
D D 
is a progenerator in ~ 
and thus, 
Ends(Ds) c EndD(DD ) = D. 
Altogether, we have the following chain of inclusions: 
L c Ends(Ds) c D. 
Moreover, since 
L c S, 
we have 
a~ = Z= 
for 
~ Ends(Ds), $ ¢ L. 
Hence, for every 
m ~ Ends(Ds) , L(a) c D 
is 
a commutative subfield of D; 
and since 
Ends(Ds) e i~, 
Ends(Ds) = Z 
L(a). 
Since 
Ends(Ds) 
is a finite dimensional 
finite 
L-algebra, it is a skewfleld 
D 1 
of finite dimension over 
L, 
for 

160 
III 37 
D S 
is a simple S-module, 
S D D. 
If L 
is a maximal subfield of D, 
then 
L(a) c L 
for every 
~ Ends(Ds). 
Thus 
Ends(Ds) = L 
in this case. 
Now, back to the general case: 
The map 
~D : DS @S H°ms(Ds 'S) --> Ends(Ds) = DI 
(cf. (I.4)) 
is not zero, 
since 
D c S 
and, since 
D S 
is a simple S-module, it is an isomor- 
phism and thus 
DS ¢ =~S (cf. (1.5)). 
Moreover, 
S c EndL(D), 
a 
simple 
L-algebra and hence 
D S 
is a faithful S-module. 
Since the 
Krull-Schmldt theorem is valid in __~, D S 
is a progenerator in __~ , 
and thus 
we have 
(cf. Ex. 6,8) 
EndDI(D ) = S, 
Ends(D ) = D I. 
Since 
EndD1 
; i.e., 
D 
is a free left Dl-mOdule , S = 
(D) = (D1)nl 
L @K D ~ (Dl)nl. 
In case 
L 
is a maximal subfield of D, 
we obtain 
L @K D = (L)nl; 
i.e., 
L 
is a splitting field for D. 
Now we count the dimensions: 
(D:K) = (D:D1)(DI:L)(L:K) = 
(DL:L) = ~ 
. (Dl:L). 
Since 
n I = (D:D1) 
we have 
(L:K) = n 1. 
In 
case 
L 
is a maximal subfield, this shows that 
(D:K) = m 2 = (L:K) 2. 
In this proof we have frequently identified structures which are 
naturally isomorphic, so as to avoid unnecessary complication. 
# 
6.6 
Lemma: 
Let 
D 
be a central skewfleld over 
K 
and 
SI,S 2 
two maximal subfields of D, 
which are isomorphic as 
K-algebras, 
: S I ~ > S 2. 
Then there exists 
d e D 
such that 
~(Sl) = dSld-i , 
s i c S I. 
Proof: 
Let 
S 
be a subfield of D 
which is isomorphic to 
S I 
and S 2 
as K-algebras. 
Since 
S 
is also a maximal subfield of D 
S @K D = 
(S)n, 
where 
n = (S:K) 
(cf. (6.7)). 
Now, 
ring 
SI, S 2 c S @K D 
and hence we obtain two monomorphisms as K-algebras 
~I : SI--> (S)n' 
~2 : $2 --> (S)n " Since 
S 
is isomorphic to 
S I 
and 
S 2 
as K-algebras, we obtain two monomorphisms, of K-algebras 

IIl 38 
~i : s--> s i ~----> (S)n , 
*2 : S --> S 2 @2 > (S)n" 
Let L be the 
n-dimensional S-vectorspace, with a fixed basis 
[Wi]l<_i_< 
n. We 
consider the K-submodules of L, 
~ 
and ~, 
generated over K by 
the action of 
,l(S), 
and 
,2(s) 
resp., 
s ~ S, 
on [will<i_< n. 
Then ~ 
and ~ 
are left S-modules of dimension n over K. 
Thus, 
they are isomorphic as S-modules (cf. (5.5)). 
Hence, this isomor- 
phism can be extended to an automorphism of L, 
and thus, 
there 
exists a matrix B ¢ (S) n such that 
*l(S)B -- B*2(s), 
V s e S. 
Since M l 
and ~ 
are isomorphic, 
B 
is invertible; 
i.e., 
B-I*I(S)B = 02(S). 
Consequently,

B-l~l(t )B = ~2(~(t )) , t e S I. 
Under the isomorphism S e K D ~ > (S)n, 
B corresponds to an

s i ® d i ¢ S ~K D. 
=i 
Here we can assume, that 
[Si]l<_i_< 
n, 
are linearly independent 
over K since S is a free K-module. 
Now, the equation (6.6') 
reads 
(yn, si ® di)(l ®@(t))= 
(I ® t)(~n' I s i ®di), 
n I 
n' 
thus, 
~i=l si @ di ~(t) = ~=i si ® sl di ' ~t e S I. 
Hence d i ~(t) = s I d i , ~t ¢ S I , i < i _< n'. 
If d I # 0 - this 
is the case for at least one d i - then ~(t) = dll t dl,~t ¢ S I. 
# 
6.7 Theorem (Wedderburn): 
Every finite skewfield is a field. 
Proof: 
Let D be a skewfield with a finite number of elements. 
Then D is a central simple algebra over a Galois-field K. And 
all maximal subfields of D are isomorphic, since over a finite 
field there exists only one extension of a fixed degree. 
Since any 
element of D is contained in some maximal subfield of D, D is a 
161 

162 
Ill 39 
union of maximal subfields. 
On the other hand, if 
E i 
and 
Ej 
are 
maximal subfields then, for some 
d i ¢ D, 
E i = di-lE j d i (cf.(6.9)). 
Thus the multiplicative group 
D r 
of 
D~O] 
is the union of conju- 
gates of a proper subgroup 
E~. 
However, this is impossible for a 
finite group.

Proof: 
By (5.5), 
A = ei=l 
finite extension field of a splitting field for an algebra is also a 
splitting field for this 
algebra, it obviously suffices to assume 
A 
to be simple. 
Thus, let 
A = (D)n , K 1 = center (D) 
and let 
L 
be a maximal subfield of 
D. 
Then 
L ~K (O)n ~ L ~K D ~K (K)n

(cf. proof of (6.4)). 
Since 
A 
is 
separable, 
(DL)n 
is semi-simple 
(cf. (9.9)). 
In particular, 
L ~K E1 
is semi-simple (cf. Ex. 5,6). 
The same argument shows, tha~ 
for every extension field 
L' 
of 
L, 
L' e K K 1 
is semi-slmple and 
now, the same technique as in (Ex. 5,7) shows, that 
K 1 
is a 
separable extension of 
K. 
Since a finite separable extension of 
K 

III 40 
163 
is a simple extension, 
E I = K(a), for some 
a c K I. 
Then 
L @KKI ~ L(a) ~ L[X]/(f(X)), 
where 
f(X) = minKl/K(a,X). 
Let 
L' 
be a finite extension field of 
L 
such that 
f(X) 
decomposes 
completely into linear factors in L', say 
f(X) = W~=I(& i - X). 
Since

K, 
~i # ~J 
for

Then 
L, % L %K I =

Since the ideals 
[(4 i - X)}l~i<t 
are maximal and different, a 
simple application of the Chinese remainder theorem (I, (7.7)), shows 
that the sequence 
0--> D~= I (~i - X) --> L'[X] --> ~=i L[XS/(~i " X) --> 0

Moreover,

We are now going to introduce the reduced characteristic 
polynomial, the reduced norm and the reduced trace of a separable 
K-algebra 
A. 
These are less complicated and more important then the 
characteristic polynomial, the norm and the trace; especially if 
char K # 0. 
6.11 
Definitions: 
Let 
A 
be a finite dimensional central 
simple K-algebra and 
L 
a finite dimensional splitting field for A 
(cf. (6.9)). 
If A = (D)n 
for some central skewfield 
D 
over 
K, 
we have 
A L = L @KA .~a > (L)r, 
where 
r = n • s with 
: K] = s 2. 
For 
a c A, 
(l®a)o ¢ (L)r 
is represented by an 
[D 
(r x r) - matrix with entries in L. 
We define the reduced charac- 
teristic polynomial of a c A 
relative to 
K 
as 
PCrdA/K (a) = det(X • ~r- (i @a)a) c L[X], 
the reduced norm 
of a 
as 
NrdA/K (a) = det((l@a)a) ¢ L 

164 
III 41 
and the reduced trace of 
a 
as 
TrdA/K(a ) = tr((l@a)a) • L. 
We then have 
PCrdA/K(a ) = X n - TrdA/K(a ) +...+ (-l~ NrdA/K(a). 
6.12 
Lemma: 
For 
a ¢ A, PCrdA/K(a) 
is independent of the iso- 
morphism 
a : A L 
> (L)r 
as well as of the choice of the splitting 
field 
L. 
Proof: 
Let 
a I : L @K A ,,~ > (L)r 
and 
a 2 : L @K A ~ > (L) r 
be two algebra isomorphisms. 
Then one shows, as in the proof of (6.6)j 
that the images of 
a I 
and 
~2 
are conjugate by a matrix in 
(L)r; 
i.e., there exists a matrix 
~ e (Lr) 
such that 
(l ea)~ l = ~l[(l ~a)a~]B_. 
But this shows that 
PCrdA/K(a ) is independent of the chosen iso- 
morphism. 
If now 
L 1 
and 
L 2 
are two finite dimensional splitting 
fields for 
A, 
then we choose a common extension field 
L 
of 
L 1 
and 
L2, 
and, using the previous result, we conclude that 
PCrdA/K(a ) is independent of the chosen splitting field. 
# 
Before showing that 
PCrdA/K(a ) e KKX] 
we have to derive some 
facts on central simple algebras which are of interest in themselves. 
6.13 
Lemma: 
Let 
A 
be a central simple K-algebra. 
Then there 
exists a separable extension field of 
K which splits 
A.

Because of (6.4) it suffices to assume that 
A = D 
is a 
central skewfield over 
K. 
We shall show that 
D 
contains a maximal 
separable subfield. 
This will prove the assertion (cf. (6.555. 
We 

III 42 
165 
claim that in D\K 
there exist separable elements. 
Assume to the 
contrary that every d e D 
satisfies an equation of minimal degree 
s 
of the form d p 
= k e K, 
where 
p > 0 
is the characteristic of 
K. 
This implies in particular, that the degree of 
K(d) 
is a multiple 
of p, 
and that consequently, 
p2 
divides the degree of D over K. 
Let now L be a finite dimensional splitting field of D 
and con- 
sider an algebra homomorphisma : D 
> L ®K D ~ > (L)r . Then, 
s 
for d e DkK, da also satisfies the equation 
(da) p 
= k~ • K, 
of 
minimal degree. 
But, since the minimum polynomial of 
da divides 
the characteristic polynomial of 
da 
(cf. (3.4)) we have 
k(da) = O, 
for every d e D \K. And, since every element in 
(L)r has the form 
Zi~i(dia ) this implies tr(~) = 0 
for every 
B • (~)r k L, 
a contra- 
diction. 
Now we turn to the proof of (6.13). 
Let 
d I • D be separable 
of degree m I > 1 and 
(D :K) = r 2. 
Then K(dl) ®K D = (Dl~/ml, 
where 
D 1 
is a central skewfield over 
K(dl). 
Now we continue the 
same construction with D 1 
and 
K 1 = K(dl). 
After finitely many 
steps we get a separable extension K(dl,...,dt) 
of degree 
r over 
K which splits 
D. 
6.14 Theorem: 
Let 
A be a central simple K-algebra and a ¢ A. 
Then 
PCrdA/K(a) e K[X]; 
in particular, 
NrdA/K(a) • K 
and 
Trd~jK(a ) • K. 
Proof: 
According to (6.13) we can find a separable splitting 
field L 
of A. 
Extending it, if necessary, we may assume that 
L 
is a normal separable (i.e., Galois) extension of K. 
By G we 
denote the Galois group of L 
over 
K. 
To prove the theorem it suf- 
fices to show that 
PCrdA/K(a ) is invariant under all p • G. 
We 
set 
(P)r : (L)r 
> (L)r' (4iJ) t 
> (~i~) 
and fix an isomorphism 
: L @K A ~ > (L)r. 
According to (6.12), 
Pc((l®a)a) = 

166 
III 43 
Pc((l®a)~(p)r) = Pc((l®a)a)f~ 
for all 
p ~ G 
and thus 
PCrdA/K(a) 
is indeed invariant under the Galois group. 
#

Lemma: 
Let 
A 
be a central simple K-algebra. 
If 
[A :K] = n 2, 
then 
(i) 
[PCrdA/K(a ) ]n = PCA/K(a) 
(li) 
[NrdA/K(a)]n 
= N K(a) 
(iii) 
n • TrdA/K(a) = TrA/K(a), 
~a c A. 
Proof: 
It suffices to prove (i). 
Let 
L 
be a splitting field 
for A, 
then M =O n 
i=l L~il 
is a simple left AL-module, 
if ~il 
is the matrix with 1 at the (i,1)-position and zeros elsewhere. 
A 
= (bpa) ¢ A L 
representing 
a ¢ A 
acts on M 
by 
matrix 
2 ii = 
bki  kl; 
and it follows that 
PC(Ol@a ) = PCrdA/K(a), 
where 
O1 @ a 
denotes 
the matrix of the linear transformation of M 
induced by left multi- 
plication with 
(1 ®a). 
Now, as left AL-module, 
A L ~ M (n) 
and the 
result follows. 
# 
6.16 
Remark: 
(i) 
If A 
is a simple separable K-algebra with 
center 
L we define the reduced trace of 
A 
with respect to 
K by 
TrdA/K(a) = TrL/K(TrdA/L(a)), 
a A, 
and it follows Immediately that here too 
r.TrdA/K = TrA/K(a), 
where 
[A : L] = r 2. 
For an arbitrary separable K-algebra the reduced trace 
is defined as the sum of the reduced traces of the simple components. 
(ii) 
The trace function and the reduced trace function are symmetri~ 
i.e., 
TrA/K(ab) = TrA/K(ba), 
(cf. Ex. 6,10). 
6.17 
Theorem: 
A finite dimensional semi-simple K-algebra is 
separable if and only if there exists a finite dimensional splitting 
field for A. 
Proof: 
Because of (6.10) we let 
L 
be a splitting field for A, 

III 44 
167 
say 
A L 
~i 
(L) 
. We first show that 
A L 
is separable. 
For this 
=i 
r i 
it suffices to show that 
A' = (L)r 
is separable; i.e., we have to 
show that the sequence 
0 
> Ker e 
> A,e 
• > A' 
> 0 
splits over 
A 'e. 
For this it suffices to show that 
hO%,e(iA,,g) = ~. : HOmA, e(A',A'e) 
> EndA,e(A') 
is an epimorphism; but 
~. 
is L-linear and 
EndA, e(A' ) = center(A') 
= L ) since 
~ c EndA,e(A' ) is uniquely determined by 
(i)~. 
Thus 
it suffices to show that 
E. + O. 
We choose a special basis 
{~ij]l~ij<__r 
of A', 
where 
~iJ 
Is the matrix with 
1 
at the 
(i,J)-positlon and zeros elsewhere. 
It is easily checked that 
[~i~] 
with 
E=ij* = ~Ji 
is a dual basis of 
[Eij)= with respect to the 
reduced trace 
(cf. (6.11) and (3.7)). 
Now, we define,for every 
b e A', 
the map 
~b :A' 
> A 'e, a ~--->Z r 
* 
i,j=l a Eijb ® Eij. 
Then 
Ob c HomAe(A,Ae), 
(cf. Ex. 6,2) and e,(~b ) = ~b ~ : A' 
r 
* 
a I 
> Zi,J=l a ~iJ b ~Ji" 
If we choose 
b = E___ll, then 
> A', 
-- 
E* 
(1) Ell  ,J=l 
Ell 
E ~ 
= 
Thus 
A' 
is separable. 
Hence we know that 
A L 
is separable. 
But 
L@K- is a faithful functor on 
K~= f, 
and thus, 0 = Ext I L(AL,x L) = 
A e 
L @K Ext~e(A'X) 
implies 
EXt~e(A,X) = 0 
for every 
X ~ Ae~f, 
i.e., 
A 
is separable. 
6.18 
Corollary: 
Let 
A 
be a separable finite dimensional 
K-algebra. 
Then the discriminant of every K-basis of 
A 
relative to 

168 
III 45 
the reduced trace function does not vanish and thus there exist dual 
bases relative to the reduced trace. 
Proof: 
This is an immediate Consequence of (3.7) and the proof 
of the previous theorem. 
6.19 
Theorem: 
Let 
A 
be a central simple K-algebra. 
Then A 
is separable and it stays central simple under any extension of the 
ground field. 
Proof: 
With (6.9) and (6.17) we conclude that 
A 
is separable, 
and it remains to show that for any extension field 
L 
of 
K, 
center (A L) = L. 
But this follows from (1.2) since 
center (A L) = End 
e(A L) - L ®K EndAe(A) --- L @K K -- L. 
(A L) 
6.20 
Theorem: 
Let 
A 
be a separable K-algebra and 
f : A x A --> K 
a non-degenerate bilinear form. 
Let 
[Wi]l<i< n and 
B 
[W~]l<_.i<_n be a pair of dual bases with respect to 
f. 
If e:A e 
> A 
is the augmentation map, then 
Im s, = homAe(1A, S) = [~=lW~awi:aeA] 
= center(A). 
We observe that, since 
A 
is separable, there exists a non-de- 
generate bilinear form and a pair of dual bases relative to it, 
(cf. (3.7), (6.18) and Ex. 3,5), and thus the statement of thetheorem 
is meaningful. 
Proof: 
The map 
T : A 
> center(A), a i 
>~i=l w~ a w i 
is 
called the Gasch~tz-Casimir operator. 
(i) We shall first show that 
Im ~ 
is independent of the chosen 
basis. 
Let w~ = ~i=l ~Ji wi' aJi ¢ K 
be another basis and put 
~j = (akl)ij. 
Then the dual basis to

If ~'

then

III 46 
169 
i.e., 
Im 7 =Im 7' 
as follows from symmetry, and, in fact, 
7 = 7' • 
(ii) 
Next, we shall show that 
Im %, 
is independent of the chosen 
non-degenerate bilinear form. 
From (It, (1.12)) it follows that 
HomK(AA,K ) e =M 
f. 
For the non-degenerate bilinear form 
f : A ~ A 
> K, 
we define ~f : A A 
> HomK(AA,K), 
a I 
> Ca' 
where 
x~a = f(x,a). 
Since 
f 
is non-degenerate, 
k'er o~f = O; 
moreover, if 
@ e HomK(AA,K), 
then 
$ = ~a with 
a = ~i=l~(Wi)W~- 
Thus, ~f 
is a K-isomorphlsm. 
Moreover, the relation f(xy,z) = 
f(x,yz) 
implies that 
~f 
is an A-isomorphism. 
If now 
fl 
and 
f2 
are non-degenerate bilinear forms, then 
~ fl %~1 
e HomA(AA,AA ) is 
an automorphism of AA; i.e., right multiplication by some unit 
° 
evor 
 
o 
Y

x 
-- x 
= f2(x,ya o) 
If 
[Wi l i  
and 
are 
dual bases with respect to 
fl" 
then 
[Wl]l~i~ n 
and 
{w~ ao]IDin 
are dual bases with respect to 
f2" 
Since 
ao I A = A, ~i=l wE a w i = 
~i=l w~ a O (aol a) w i 
shows that 
Im ~ 
is independent of the chosen 
bilinear form. 
(iii) 
Because of (i) we may choose the basis according to the simple 
components of A, 
and consequently, we may assume that A 
is simple. 
As a special non-degenerate bilinear form, we choose the reduced 
trace function (cf. (6,13)). 
Let 
[Wi]l<i~ n 
and 
[W~l~i~ n 
be a 
pair of dual bases relative to the reduced trace. 
Then, for every 
b c A, the map 
Cb : A 
> A e, a ~---> n 
A e_ 
~i=l a w~ b ® w i 
is an 
homomorphism (cf. Ex. 6,2) and 
y(b) = (1)¢ba , where 
E : A e ,, > A 
is the augmentation map. 
Hence 
~(b) = ~,(¢b ) e En%e(A ) = C = 
center(A). 
Since 
C 
is a field (A was assumed to be simple) and 
is a C-homomorphism, it suffices to show that ~(b) ~ 0 for some 
b ¢ A. 
Let 
L 
be a finite dimensional splitting field for A. 
Now

projective covers 
Essential epimorphisms are used to restate 
Nakayama's lemma. 
The projective modules over left 
semi-perfect rings are described. 
Left noetherian 
and left artinian rings are semi-perfect. 
Although the classical approach to the method of lifting idem- 
potents (cf. e.g. Curtis - Reiner [1], §77) is perhaps shorter, we 
shall present here the more general concept of projective covers 
(cf. Bass [7], Shu 
a [1]). 
7.1 
Definitions: 
Let

An epimorphism

commutatively (cf. I, (2.9)). 
Since

Lattices and orders 
The basic definitions for orders and lattices 
over orders are given~ and some elementary 
properties are derived. 
The connections between 
the global, the local and the complete case 
are developed. 
Let 
R 
be a Dedekind domain (of. I, (7.1)) with 
quotient field 
K 
and 
A 
a finite dimensional K-algebra. 
i.I 
Definitions: 
(i) 
An R-order 
A 
in 
A 
is a subring of 
A 
with the same identity as 
A 
such that 
f, 
~) 
KA- 
A; 
le., 
A 
contains a K-basls of 
A. 
(ii) 
A left A-lattice is a left A-module, which is at the same 
time an R-lattice in some finite dimensional K-vectorspace 
V 
(of. I, (7.1)); i.e., a torsionfree R-module of finite type. 
1.2 
Remark: 
From now on we assume that 
A 
is a finite dimensio- 
nal 
separable K-algebra (cf. III, (5.1)), and for an R-order 
A 
in 
A 
we use the following notation: 
n ° - the category of left A-lattlces. 
(If no confusion 
can arise, we omit the word "left".) 
- set of all prime ideals in 
R. 
1.3 
Len~na: 
Let 
M 
be an R-lattice in 
A; 
i.e., 
EM- 
A. 
Then 
A~(M)- 
{a c A:aMC M} 
and 
At(M)- 
{a ¢ A:MaC M] 

IV 2 
179 
are R-orders in 
A, 
called the left and right ring of multipliers 
of M 
resp. (or shortly: 
left and right order of M 
resp.). 
Proof: 
To show that 
A~(M) 
is an order, we observe that 
A2(M) 
is obviously a ring. 
Since 
KM- A, 
M 
contains a K-basls for 
A 
say 
[Wi)l~i<n" 
Let M 
be generated over 
R 
by 
(mi}l~i<t' 
and choose 
0 ~ r ¢ R 
such that 
(rwl)m j c M, 
1 ~ i ~ n, 
1 ~ J ~ t. 
This is indeed possible:

mj - 
, 1 ~ J < t, kj~ ~ K 
zn 
s 
s 
wiw ~ = 
s.lki~Ws, I ~ i, ~ ~ n, ki~ e K. 
Since 
K 
is the quotient field of 
R 
(cf. I, (6.6)), there 
exists 
0 ~ r' g R 
such that 
r'kj~ g R, 1 ~ J ~ t, I ~ ~ ~ n, 
s 
r12 
and 
r'ki~ ¢ R, 1 ~ i, ~, s ~ n. 
Then 
r - 
has the desired 
property, and we have 
rwiMC M, 1 ~ i ~ n; i.e., 
rw i e A~(M), 
1 ~ i ~ n, 
and 
A~(M) 
contains a K-basis for 
A. 
Since 
KM- A, M(~R-I ~ 0, 
and we choose 
0 ~ r o ~ M~R.I. 
Then 
A~(M)-r oC M, 
and 
A~(M)r o g ~f, 
R 
being noetherian. 
Since 
A2(M)ro ~R A~(M), 
A~(M) ¢ ~f, 
and 
A2(M) 
is an R-order in 
A. 
The proof for 
Ar(M ) is done similarly. 
# 
In the proof of the next theorem we use essentially the fact, 
that 
A 
is a separable K-algebra. 
(1".4) in turn is used to 
guarantee the existence of maximal orders (cf. (4.6)). 
1.4 Theorem: 
Let 
S 
be a subring of 
A with the same identity 
as 
A. 
Then 
S 
is an R-order in 
A 
if and only if 
(ii) 
KS - A, 
(Ill) 
every 
s ¢ S 
is integral over 
R. 

180 
IV 3 
Proof: 
If S 
Is an R-order in 
A, 
then (I) and (il) are satisfied 
by definition (cf. (l.1)), and (lli) Is satisfied since 
S ¢ R~ f 
(cf. I, (5.4)). 
Conversely: 
We have to show that 
S 
is finitely 
generated over 
R 
(cf. (i.I, ~)). 
Let 
{Wl)l~i~ n 
be a K-basls of 
A 
contained 
n 
in 
S. 
For 
s c S, 
we have 
s = L 
kiwi' ki c K, 1 ~ I ~ n, 
i-1 
In 
and 
swj - 
k.w~wj, 
I ~ J ~ n. 
We shall show that 
TrdA/K(SWj) c R 
(cf. III, ~,ii)). 
1.4' 
Claim: 
If 
a ¢ A 
Is integral over 
R, 
then 
Trd A/K(a),Nrd A/K(a ) ~ R. 
Proof: 
It suffices to show that l~rdA/K(a,X ) c R[X] 
(cf. III, 
(6 .ii )). 
Since 
a 
is integral over 
R, 
It satisfies a monic 
polynomial 
f(X) ¢ R[X] 
(cf. I, (5.2)). 
We shall first show 
that 
g(X) - mlnA/K(a;X ) c R[X] 
(of. III, (3-1)). 
We in~ 
to 
apply GauB I 
lemma (of. I, Ex. 7.6). 
However, since 
Gaul' 
lemma Is only formulated for prlnclpal ideal domains we use the 
technique of localization: 
g(X) ~ R[X] <*--> g(X) ~ RR[X], 
V 2 c S 
(cf. I, (8.6)), and since 
Rp 
Is a principal ideal 
m= 
domain (cf. I, (8.3)), we may apply Gnu6' lemma. 
We write 
f(X) = g(X)h(X), 
where 
h(X'j ~ K[X]. 
Putting 
g(X) - ago(X), 
b(X) = ~/Fho(X), 
where 
go(X), ho(X ) ~ R IX] 
are primitive 
polynomials (cf. I, Ex. 7.6) and 
~,8,~ E R_p, we obtain 
?T(X) = a~go(X)ho(X). 
By Gnu6' lemma (I, Ex. 7.6), go(X)ho(X) 
is 
a primitive polynomial, and since 
f(X) 
Is monic, 
F = ~; 
hence 
f(X) = go(X)ho(X), 
and go(X) 
has leading coefficient i. 
Since 
g(X) 
was monlc to start wlthj go(X) = g(X) ~ R [X]. 
Thus, 

IV 4 
181 
g(X) ¢ R2[X] , V~ ~ ~ 
and therefore 
g(X) g R[X]; i.e., 
minA/K(a,X) ¢ R[X]. From (III, (3.5) and (6o15)) follows that 
Perdita,X) n divides 
minA/K(a,x)n. 
Now a similar argument as above 
shows that P~dA/K(a,X ) e R[X]. 
# 
Returning to the proof of (1.4), we find 
I. 4" 
zn 
k i ~dA/K(WiWj) i ~dA/K(SWj) ¢ R, 
1 ~ J < n. 
i= 1 
But since 
A 
is separable, the discriminant of the basis 
[Wi]l~i~ n 
is different from zero (cf. III, (6.18)); i.e., 
det(ShIA/K(WiWj) ) ~ O, 
and we may solve the system (1.4") with 
respect to the 
[ki]l<i~n; i.e., 
k i ~ R.det(~dA/K(WiWj))-l. 
Con- 
~n 
)_lw~. 
sequently 
s ~ 
R.det(~/K(WiWj) 
Since this holds for 
all 
s ¢ S, 
and since 
R 
is noetherian, we conclude 
S e R~f; 
i.e., 
S 
in an R-order in 
A. 
# 
1.5 
Lemma: 
Let 
L be a finite dimensional separable extension 
field of K, 
and let 
R' 
be the integral closure of 
R 
in 
L. 
Then 
R' 
is a Dedekind domain. 
Moreover, if 
P ~ 2' 
then 
R~ = R 2 @R R' 
is a semi-local Dedekind domain; i.e., it has only 
finitely many prime ideals. 
In particular 
R' 
is a principal 
' 
p 
ideal domain. 
Proof: 
By (III, Ex. 6.3), 
L 
is a separable K-algebra, and by 
(1.4), 
R' 
is a finitely generated R-module. 
Thus~ R' 
is 
noetherian since 
R 
is noetherian (cf. I, (4.1)). 
Obviously 
R' 
is integrally closed in 
L, 
and 
L 
is the quotient field of 
R'. 
Thuslit remains to show that every prime ideal in 
R' 
is maximal. 
Let 
p' 
be a prime ideal in 
R', 
and put 
p i R(~p'; 
then 
p 
is a prime ideal in 
R, 
whence it is maximal,R being a Dedekind 

182 
IV 5 
domain. 
Since 
R/2 
is a field, 
R'/p' 
is a finite dimensional 
R/p-algebra which is an integral domain; i.e., a field by (Ex.l.l). 
Thus, 
p' 
is a maximal ideal. 
Now if 2 
is a prime ideal in R, 
then S - R \ {~} 
is a multiplicative system in R', 
and 
R~ 
is a Dedeklnd domain. 
The only maximal ideals in R~ are the 
! 
ones containing 
~R~; 
i.e., 
R S has only a flnlte number of prime 
ideals (of. I, (7.2)) and thus it is a principal Ideal domain 
(cf. I, (7.8)).

The method of liftin~ idempotents for orders over a complete 
Dedekind.domain 
It is proved, that over a complete Dedekind domain ~, every 
~-order is semi-perfect. 
Let R be a Dedekind domain with quotient field K, 2 a fixed prime 
ideal in R and ~, with quotient field K and radical ~R, the ~-adic 
completion of R under the ~-adic topology (of. I, § 9). Let ~ be a 
finite dimensional K-algebra and ~ an R-order in A. 
2.1 
Theorem, ~ is semi-perfect. 
We shall prove the more general, 
2.2 
Theorem, Let 0 # ~ be a two-slded h-ideal in ~, contained in 
rad~. Then ~/~ is noetherian and artinian, and the idempotents in 
~/I can be lifted to idempotents in ~. 
Proof, ~/I is noetherian as homomorphic image of a noetherian ring 
(of. I,(4.3)). To show 
that it is also ~rtinian, we observe, that 
~
R
 
• i # 0 is a proper ideal in R. Since R is a local princi- 
pal ideal domain with radical ~R (cf. I,(9.13)),4.R~I =WnR for 
~.~n~ 
~l~n~ 
some n ~ N. But ~I~ ~ Is an artinian ring, and since 
is a 
^n ~ 
finite R/~ R-algebra, it is also artinian (of. Ex. ~,3). Conse- 
quently, A/I, as a homomorphic image of ~/~n~, is artinian 
(of. I,(4.3)). For this we did not need that I C rad ~, only KI = A. 
Since wR is hausdorff (Ofo i,(9.6)) and, since ~ is (wR)-hausdorff, 
= ~imA/(~) n (of. I,(9.8)). Above we have seen that I ~n~I 
conversely, since I C rad A, we have (I + ~)/~ k arad(~/~) 
(of. I, Ex. 4,5)I but A/%A is artinian and noetherian. Thus 
rad(~/~) 
is nilpotent, (cf. I, Ex. 4,6), and hence there exists 
man with I mc ~ ~ . We now apply (I,(9.11)), to conclude, that 
= l~im~/I n, Finally we show that the idempotents from ~/I can be 
lifted. We recall that we have a chain of natural epimorphisms

It Is shown, that projective lattices and progenerators are pre- 
served under localization, completion and reduction modulo a 
prime ideal ~ in R. For projective lattices the equivalence of 
local isomorphism, isomorphism over the completion and Isomor- 
phlsm modulo ~ is proved. Morlta equivalences preserve irredu- 
cible, indecomposable and projective lattices. 
Let R be a De@ekind domain wlth quotlent field K and A a finite di- 
mensional separable K-algebra. We use the notation of (1o6).

Theoreml Let A be an R-order in A and E ~ ~= 
a progenerator 
(of. III,(1.9)). If we put A= Endh(E), then the Morlta equivalence 
between N~ f and ~f 
(of. III, (2.1)) 
(i) 
preserves lattices, 
(ii) preserves inclusions, 
(ill) preserves irreducible and Indecomposable lattices, 
(iv) preserves projective lattices and progenerators. 
(v) KE a A~ f is a progenerator. 
(vi) For a fixed ~ c ~ we donote by ..... reduction modulo ~. Then 
_M O 
a A= 
is a progenerator, and for M ~ ~o 
we have a natural 
isomorphism HomA(E,M) ~ Hom~(E,M), 
and ~ 
~ End_ (E) as rings. 
Proof, From (1.15) we know that ~ is an R-order in EndA(KM). Thus, 
to show (i) it suffices to prove that HomA(M1,M 2) is R-torsion-free 
M ° (of. Ex. 1,3). But if ~ ¢ HomA(M1,M 2) is such that 
if M1,M 2 a ~= 
r~= 0 for some 0 ~ r & R, then rim ~ = 0! i.e., Im~ = 0, since 
M 2 is an R-lattice. Hence HomA(M1,M 2) is an R-lattlce. (li) follows 
from (III,(2.1)) and (iv) from (III,(1.10) and the proof of III,(1.11), 
since hE~ E* H A - is a faithful exact functor. (v) is clear because 
KE is a faithful projective A-module (of. III, Ex. 6,8). But then 
(iii) follows from (III,(2.1) and IV,(1.13)). (3.1) and (3.4) imply 
that E is a progenerator. Finally to prove the remaining part of 
(vi) we establish the more general result;

Theorem. Let S be a noetherian ring and I a two-sided ideal in 
S such that S/I is artinian. If E ~ sM 
f_ is a progenerator then 
M f 
E/IE a S/I ~f is a progenerator, and for M z S= we have a natural 
isomorphism 
HOmS/I(E/IE,M/IM) m 
HOms(E,M)/Homs(E,IM). 
Moreover, if I = rad S, then HOms(E,IE) ~ rad T, where T = Ends(E). 
nat 
Proofl Since M/IM ~ 
S/I H R M and since S/I I R- is an additive 
S~ f is a progenerator. For M a S~ f we have the exact 
functor, E/IE 
sequence 
0 
- IM 
• M 
L M/IM 
- O. 
But E is projective, and we obtain the exact sequence 
0 
- Homs(E,IM) 
- Homs(E,M) 
----Homs(E,M/IM) 
- O! 
i.e., HOms(E,M/IM) ~ Homs(E,M)/Homs(E,IM ). However, for every 
~ Homs(E,M/IM)" Ker ~ ~ IE = Ker ~ , where ~ is the canonical epi- 
morphism E ----E/IE. Hence there exists (cf. I, Ex. 2,3) a unique 
£ HOms(E/IE,M/IM) such that ~ = ~. 
Consequently 
HOms(E,M/IM) = Homs(E/IE,M/IM 
) = HOmS/I(E/IE,M/IM) , 
and for every M we have a natural isomorphism 
HOmS/I(E/IE,M/IM) ~ HOms(E,M)/Homs(E,IM). 
In particular, for M = E, this is a ring isomorphism. 
If now I = tad S, then we have a Morlta equivalence between 
S/I and Ends/I(E/IE,E/IE) = T 1 . 
Since S/I is artinian and noetherian every finitely generated left 
module is projective. Thus, the same must hold for TI! i.e., T I is 
semi-simple. The ring isomorphism 
Ends/I(E/IE) ~Ends(E)/Homs(E,IE) 
shows HOms(E,IE)~ rad T. Conversely, the canonical epimorphism 
s E 
, E/IE is an essential epimorphism (cf. III,(7.2)). But 
Morita equivalenosspreserve essential epimorphisms (cf. Ex. 3,4)|hence 

196 
IV 19 
hom(1E, ?) , Ends(E ) 
~ HOms(E , E/IE) 
is an essential eplmorphism. Whence 
HOms(E,IE) = rad T 
(cf. III, Ex. 7,1). 
We now return to the proof of (3.7,vi). With (3.8) we get for I = ~ A 
Hom~(E,M ) = HomA(E,M )/HomA(E , ~M ) @ 
But it is easily seen - using e.g. localizations - that 
Hom_(E,~M) = ~Hom (E,M). Thus Hom (E,M) ~ Hom (E,M).

Lemma: Let A be a hereditary R-order in A, and let A = @i~1 Ae i 
be the decomposition of A into simple K-algebras, where the 
{ el} leimn are the central idempotents in A (cf. III,(5.5)). Then 
A = ei~ 1Aei, where Ae i is a hereditary R-order in Ae i, l&imn. More- 
over, A contains a complete set of primitive orthogonal idempotents 
of A. 
Proofl Since A is hereditary, every indecomposable A-lattice is also 
irreducible. For, in the proof of (1.13) it has been shown, that 
every reducible A-lattice M contains an R-pure submodule (cf.I,(7.4)) 
of smaller R-rank. Since A is hereditary, M decomposeso In particu- 
lar, ^A is a direct sum (not necessarily unique) of irreducible 
left A-lattices! i.e., 
^~ = @i~l Ae~. Obviously the {e~} l~i_~m 
form a complete set of orthogonal primitive idempotents (cf. (1.13)) 
of Ao Adding up the A-equivalent primitive idempotents to yield 
the central idempotents 
{ei} lmimn of A (cf, III,(5.7), (5.8)), 
obtain A = @i~1 ~ei! where &e i is an R-order in Aei, lmimn. Since 
we

# 
4.4 
Remark, Let A be an R-order in A and let 
[ei~ lSimn be the 
central primitive idempotents of A (cfo III,(5.7)). Then Ae i is an 
R-order in Ae i, imimn, and A C @i~1Aei" 
4.5 
Remarks To treat maximal orders, it suffices to assume 
that A 
is a central simple K-algebra. Let P be a maximal R-order in the se- 
parable K-algebra A, and let 
[ei] lmimn be the central primitive

idempotents of A. Because of the maximality of P, we must have 
F = @ n F e i (cf. (4.4)), where Pe i is a maximal R-order in Aei,lei-~n. 
i=1 
If R i is the integral closure of R in the center K i of Ae i, 1mien, 
then R i is a Dedekind domain with quotient field K i (cf. (1o5) and

Abe an R-order in A, and let 
A = ^o C AIC... CAIc o.. 
be an ascending chain of R-orders in A, containing Ao Then ~ =~ A i 
is a subring of A with the same identity as A, containing a K-basis 
for A. Moreover, since every element in ~ is integral over R, ~ is

an R-order in A (cf. (1.4)). Since A £ = 
A = A k for some k! i.e., 
A k is maximal. This shows at the same time that any ascending chain

NoteJ A A-ideal shall, in the sequel, always mean a two-sided ~-lat-

always assume P ~ 0 and P ~A.

L~mmal Let P be a prime ideal in~. Then R • 1 ~ P = p 
is a 
prime ideal in R, and A/P is a simple R/p-algebra! in particular, 
P is a maximal two-sided ideal in A. 
Proofs We put ~ = R • 1 ~PI 
then a is an ideal in Ro If a,b £ R and 
J 
ab ~ ~, then P ~ (ab)~= (a ~)(b~). 
Since P is prime, a~ C P or 
bA C P! i.e., a £ a= or b ~ ~,_ and a= = ~ is a prime ideal in R. More- 
over, A/P is a finite dimensional R/~-algebra. 
Let ~, ~ ~ ~ h/P be the canonical homomorphlsm. If A/P were not 
simple, then it is easily seen that it would contain two non-zero 
two-slded ideals ~1 and ~2 such that 11 12 = 0 (cf. Ex. 4,6). If 
we put I i = ~-1(~i), i ~ 1,2, then 11 12 C P! i.e., ~1 °r ~2 must 
be zero, a contradiction.

Theorem, Let 1 ~ be a maximal R-order in A. If 0 # I # I ~ is a 
T-ideal, then 
i-1i _- ri-1 _- 1 ~. 
In other words, the r-ideals and their inverses generate a group 
with r as identity. If A is an R-order in A, and if 0 # I # A is a 
A-ideal, I is called an invertible A-ideal, if there exists a A-lat- 
tice I' in A with I'I = If' =A. In that case I' is uniquely de- 
termined and I' = 1-1o 
Proofl 1-1 is a two-sided T-lattice, and thus 0 ~ J = II-lt" i ~ is a

i-1 is a r-lattice (Cfo (4.12)), Ar(I-1) = P (cf. (1.3))! i.e.,

Theorems Let I ~ be a maximal R-order in A. Then every l~-ideal I, 
0 ~ I # I ~ is a unique product of prime ideals° 
Proofs (i) If P1 and P2 are prime ideals in 1 ~, then PIP2 = P2P1 • 
In fact, this is obviously true if P1 = P2" If P1 # P2' then 
P1(P11P2P1 ) = P2P1 C P2 and since P1 ~ 
P2 (of. (4.10)),

P2 
(observe P11P2P1 C r) because P2 is prime (cf. (4.9)~i.e.,

(ii) 
We assume that not every proper r-ideal 
can 
be written as 
a product of prime ideals, and we choose a largest proper r-ideal I 
which is not a product of prime ideals. 
Since 
1 ~ is noetherian, 
we may choose a maximal ideal 
P

ideal- j such that 
P ~I.

where the inequalities follow from 
(4.15) 
and 
(4.14). Hence 
IP -I is a product of prime ideals. 
It follows that 
I = Ip-Ip is 
a product of prime ideals, a contradiction.

The uniqueness of this factorization follows easily by induc-

over K. Then a e A is integral over R if and only if N~/~(a) ~ R.

Proof, One shows as in (1.4') that N~/~(a) e R whenever a is inte- 
gral over R (cf. III,(6.15))o Thus we may assume that a a ~ with 
N~/~(a) a ~ and it remains to show that min~/~(a,X) a RtX3 
(cf. III,(3.1)). Since KtX1/(min~/~(a,X)) is isomorphic to a subring 
of the skewfleld A, which does not contain zero divisors, min~/~(a,X) 
is irreducible. However, since min~/~(a,X) divides Pc~/~(a,X), 
(cf. III,(3.4)), and Pc~,~(a,X) divides min~/~(a,X) n, (cf.III,(3.5)), 
this implies that, for some m i n, 
min~/~(a,x)m = Pc~/~(a,X) 
(cf. Exo 6,2). 
Now, Pc~/~(a,X) has leading ceofficlent i and constant term in 8, 
since N~/~(a,X) a R (cfo III,(3.2')). Since R is integrally closed 
in K the same is true of mln~/~(a,X). Thus it suffices to show that,

Proof, We may view K as a separable Q-algebra and R as the maximal 
Z-order in K, (cf. (6.3)). For any prime ideal p in R, p (~ Z = pZ 
is a prime ideal in Z, and R/p is a finite dimensional Z/pZ-algebra. 
Since Z/pZ is a finite field, so is R/p.

implies that ~o- ~ rad~ if and only if Wo-I E radl". Therefore, 
~o = ~o + rad~ is a primitive (qf-l)-th root of i in ~/radl, 
and consequently, ~/rad ~ = ~/rad ~ = R( ~ ). Now since R( ~o ) Is 
o 
of degree f over R, there are polynomials go(X), ho(X) ~ R~X] such 
that 
x af-1 - 1 =_ go(X)ho(X) mod~X], 
where ~-o(X) is irreducible of degree f over R and ~o ( ~o ) = 0, here 
~o(X) stands for the image of go(X) under the canonical homomorphlsm 
R[X] 
• R[X]. Moreover, we may assume go(X) to be monic, and since 
the roots of xqf-i are all distinct ~o(X)R[X] + ~o(X)R[X] = R~X], 
so that, by Hensel's lemma for some g(X), h(X) £ R~X], 
X qf-I -i = g(X)h(X), where g(X) is moult of degree f over R and 
irreducible, since g(X) = ~o(X) (cf. Gauss's Zemma (I, Ex. 7.6)). 
Now, ~ 
ls a Dedeklnd domain, complete with respect to the rad ~ - 
adlc topology and for some gl(X)a ~IX] we have 
and 
g(X) ~. (X- ~o)g1(X) mod(rad~ IX]), 
(x-%)~xtxa

And Hensel's lemma yields the existence of ~ ~ ~ , such that 
g(~ ) = 0 and a) -u) o a rad~. Moreover, since 3 o = ~+ rad~ is a 
primitive (qf-1)-th root of 1, so ms ~. Now set ~ = K(~ ), and let 
o be the maximal R-order in L. Then ~ z ~, (cf. 46.3)), ~ ~ rad 
and [~/rad 4, R] = f, since ~(X) is irreducible over R. Thus

~, (cf. (6.6)), hence rad A 
~ ~, and ~ 
^

Now suppose that S a A is a primitive

p~ n. By Hensel~ lemma R contains a primitive (q-1)-th root of I, 
say ~. Since (n,q) = 1, there exists a smallest positive integer s

such that qS ~ 1 mod n. ~o =6~ is then a primitive (qS-1)-th root of

K(9o ) = K($). ~ /rad~ is a subfield of ~/rad r (of. above) and

(cf. Herstein's lemma (I,(9.1)) and Nakayama's lemma (I,(4.18))! 
hence s=t-X. Thus we conclude, as in the first part of the proof, 
that ~(~o) = K( ~ ) contains a primitive (qS-1)-th root of 1 that is 
a root of an irreducible polynomial of degree s, K( ~ ) being a field, 
and c~ ° is a power of this root! thus [K(~)

K( ~ ) Is tmramlfied over Kjand n divides qf-i since it divides qS-i 
and qS-I clearly divides qf-l. 
To show that ~(~) is contained in some field of inertia of A over K 
we set ~' = {aE ~: a~ = ~a} and view ~' over ~(~). If ~' is the

Finally, if rad 5 = ~, 
then it follows from (6,8) that A = L( ~ ), 
whenever ~ Is a field of inertia of A. Since the residue class fields 
~/rad r and ~/rad ~, where ~ is the maximal R-order in L, are iso- 
morphic, A has residue class degree i over ~ and thus must be to- 
tally ramified of ramification order e over ~.

Theorem (Hasse [2~). Under the conditions of Theorem (6.9) 
the two Galois groups GaI(£/K) ~-Gal((r/rad r)/R) are isomorphic. 
They are cyclic of order f generated by the so-called Frobenlus 
automorphisms, m t (~ J--)~q, ~ s ~ ~')~q9 resp. 
Proof, We recall, If K I is a finite extension field of K, ~ 
is 
called separable over K if mlnKl/K(a,X) Is a separable polynomial 
for every a L K 1, In that case K I is a simple extension of K! Joe., 
there exists ~ a KI, such that K 1 = K(~). K 1 is said to be a nor- 
mal extension of K, if every irreducible polynomial in K[X], that 
has a root in K1, decomposes Into linear factors in K I. K I is 
called a Galois extension of K if it is finite, separable and nor- 
mal over K. For K(c~) to be a Galois extension of K it suffices that 
mlnKl/K(~ ,X) be a separable polynomial over K, that factors com- 
pletely in KIO The Galois group GaI(KI/K) of K I over K consists of 
all automorphisms of K 1 that leave K elementwlse fixed° If K 1 is a 
Galcls extension of K, K I = K(~ ) and minK1/K(e(,X) = f(X), then, 
in KI[X], 
f(X) =~inl(~i-X), 
~i = ~' ~i # ~J for i # J, 
and GaI(KI/K) consists of {~i~ l&i_~n, where ~i is induced by 
~---c~, 
1mien. In particular IGal(K1/K) I = [K 1 , K] = degree of f(X). 
Obviously, every extension K 1 of K that is obtained by adjoining a 
primitive s-th root ~ of 1 to K, is a Galols extension, provided s 
does not divide the characteristic of K, for, mlnK1/K(~ ,X) has no 

IV 50 
227 
repeated linear factors in any extension field of K, and factors 
completely in K 1, since ~ is primitive. 
Now we come to the proof of 16,101s If L = K(~ ) is a Galois exten- 
sion of degree f of the field K by a primitive (qf-1)-th root of 1, 
then minL/K(~ ,X) is of degree f and divides xqf-1, and so all its 
roots are of the form w r. But, if ~: ~ w r induces an automorphism 
of L, then ~ rf = ~, and hence rfm i mod(qf-1). Now, this congruence 
has at most f solutions, while the f integers qi, Omi~f)are solutions. 
Hence the roots of minL/K(~ ,X) are exactly the elements ~qi, with 
i = 0,1,...,f-1, and ~ - ~  q induces an automorphism ~ of L of or- 
der f belonging to the Galois group of L over K. Since this group 
is of order f it is generated by ~I i.e., 
GaI(L/K) = ~ 
. 
Now the desired result follows for both Galois groups from (6.9). 
Moreover, the Frobenius automorphism of ~ = D/tad ~ = ~/rad ~ is 
given by ~ , l, 
~ I q, 1 & L, since, as is easily verified, this 
is an automorphism of ~ that leaves R elementwise fixed and that it 
is of order f. (Observe that the charactestic p of L divides q and 
that q is prime to the order qf-1 of the multlplicative group of L, 
while ~t = 1 implies ~qt = ~, whence the order of ~ is a multiple 
of f and therefore = f.) 
# 
6.11 
Theorem (Hasse ~2~), Let L = K(~), where ~ is a primitive 
(qf-1)-th root of I. Then an element k ¢ K is the norm of an element 
^ 
~tf 
1 a L! i.e., k = N~/~(1), for some I & L, if and only if k = u 
, 
for some unit u & R and t ¢ Z. 
Proof, By (Ex. 6,1) any element k & K can be written uniquely as 
k = u ~t, with t & Z and u a unit in R. We adhere to the notation 
of (6.9). 

228 
IV 51 
(i) If k = N~/~(1), with I ~ L, we can write I = u' ~t with a unit 
u' i ~and t L Z, since L is unramified over K (cf. (6.9')| i.e., 
rad ~ = ~. 
But then, the norm being multipllcative (cf.III,Ex. 3,1), 
Ns/~(u' ~t)--uN~/~(~t) = u ~ tf, 
^ 
where u = N$/~(u') is a unit in R. 
(ii) Conversely, let k = u% tf for some t a Z. Since N~/~(~t) = ~tf, 
it suffices to show that every unit u ~ R is the norm of an element 
A 
1 a L. In fact, this has to be shown only for units u ¢ R, for which 
u • 1 modl ^R. 
For, from the proof of (6.10) it follows that 
Pc~/~(~,X) = min~/~(~,X) = ~f-1 
I=0 (~qi - X), 
since both polynomials have the same degree (cf. III, (3o4) and 
(3.5)). Thus 
~ f-i qi 
q f-s, 
Nt,l~( ~ ) = ~Tf'li=o ~ qi = ~,, i=O 
= ~ q-I 
af-I 
But ~1 = ~ q-1 
is a primitive (q-1)-th root of 1, and thus 
g~/~(~ ) generates the multiplicative group R 
~ 
= R \ (07 of R. 
Consequently, 
given 
a unit 
u ~ ~l, we can determine 
s I~ N such 
that 
~./

A 
A 
and u I ~ 
R, since 
~1 is 
a unit 
in R. Thus it 
suffices 
~o show that 
u I is a norm. 
Now, let U ~ 
1 mod(~r R) be given. We shall construct a sequence 
{ill 
iI A such that 
N~/~(1) = U, for I = llm li~i¢ 
~ = llm ~/ei~. 
For 
this 
purpose 
we observe 
that 
NL/~(I+ wSl) ~ (1+ ~STrL/~((1)) rood(~s+l~),

for all s a N, I ¢ L. Indeed, from (Ex. 6.2) it follows that

where ~'i £ GaI(~/K). Thus N~./~(1)='[]-Ifl ~'l(1),Tr~./~(1)=rifl ~'i(i)

N~U/~(I+ ~Sl)= ]-[ f (I+ %s 
(I))" (l+~STrL/~(1))mod(~S+iR) 
i=l 
~i 
Moreover, every ~ ~ R is the trace of some ~ a L = ~/rad ~I. 
^ Since T~ 
is separable over R, the discriminant of any basis of ~ over R is 
non-zero and thus there exists [o ~ ~ such that Tr~/~([ o) -- k # O, 
(Cfo III,(3.1), (6.18) and Ex. 6,3). But then 
TrE/~(~/k " Yo ) = ~' for all ~ • Ro 
Finally, to construct our sequence {li] i ~ ~ 
we set 11 = 1. Assume 
that ll,o..,1 i have already been constructed so that 
lj~ ~, l~J&i, lj+ 1 - lj a ~J~, 1-~J6i-l, N~/~(lj)--" u mod(~JR), 
l~-Jelo 
We can choose ~i a ~ such that 
Tr~/~( ~i ) -~ (u/Ni/~(li) - 1)@ -i mod(~ R). 
A 
This can be done since N~/~(1 i) is a unit in R and u-N$/~(1 i) a ~iR, 
A 
and thus ~ = (u/Ni/~(1 i) - 1)~-i ¢ R, and there exists [ £ L such 
A 
that TrE/~([) = ~ , and if 1 is a preimage of Y in ~i, then 
Trl/~(1) =_ ~ mod(~ ~)o (Observe that Pc~/~(1,X) = Pc~/~(1,X), 
since Gal(L/K) m Gal(L/R) via reduction modulo ~. ) Now we set 
li+l = li(l+ ~i ~ i), and it follows from our induction hypotheses

that li+ I z ~, Ii+1 _ li = li ~iv

230 
Iv 53 
Moreover, the norm function is continu- 
uA 
ous with respect to the ~ -adic topology, since all r & Gal(L/K) are 
continuous 
(cfo Ex. 6,3). Thus we have found an 1 z ~ such that 
Ni/~(1) = u, and it follows that every element in K of the form 
u~t.f 
^

Remark, Let ~ be a separable skewfield over K. Then ~ is a 
central skewfield over its center C and C is an extension field of K. 
If e' and f' are the ramification order and the residue class degree 
respo of C over K, then [C , K]= 
e'. f' (cf. (6.6)). If e and f are 
if,cation order and the residue class degree respo of ~ over K, 
then it follows from the preceding theorems that e = e'm and f = f'm,

III, Ex. 3,4)° We shall show below that actually ~ can be chosen 
so that ~ = ~m° It follows that a complete description of the sepa- 
rable skewfields over K is obtained by investigating the two extreme 
cases, 
(i) the commutative case, ~ 
^

(ii) the central case, 8 
A 
= 
K@ 
^ 
(i) If A is commutative of residue class degree f and ramification 
order e over K, then it is obtained from K by two field extensions. 
The first one is achieved by adjoining a primitive (qf-1)-th root of 
1, say ~ , and leads to K(~ ). This field contains qf-1 roots of 1, 
and, since in a field a polynomial of degree n has at most n roots, 
K(w ) contains all roots of 1 of order prime to p that belong to 

IV 54 
231 
(cf. (6o9)), and is therefore characterized as the smallest subfield 
A 
of A with this property. Thus L = K(~ ) may properly be called th__~e 
field of inertia of A. Observe that ~ is also the largest unramified 
A 
subfield of A. Now let ~ and ~ stand for the maximal R-orders in 
and L resp, Then rad ~ = ~ a, ~ is totally ramified over L with maxi- 
A 
A 
mal b-order ~, and ~ is obtained from L by adjoining a root of a 
polynomial (Cfo (6.9) and the proof of (6.2)), 
g(X) = X e + ce_lXe-1 +.o.+ c o with 
Ce_l,...,c o ~ ~, 
CO ~ ~2~o 
Conversely, every polynomial of this form (a so-called Eisenstein 
polynomial) is irreducible over L (cf. Ex@ 6,5), and thus leads 
A 
to a totally ramified extension of Lo Moreover, if the characteristic 
p of R does not divide e, then A : L(~), with ~e : ~ o For, if 
rad ~ =~, 
~e~ = ~, 
then ~e =,u 
for some unit u a ~. If p ~ e,

then ~,

A 
tad r, thus the polynomial X e - ~o' with Uo = Uo + rad ~, has a 
a 
root in ~/rad r, and it follows from Hensel's lemma that there is a 
unit u & ~ such that u e = Uo, and ~ = ~u -1 has all the desired pro- 
perties. We observe, that in this case ~ has a maximal totally rami- 
fied subfield, namely K(~), and A : K(~) H K K(~), where ~ is a 
primitive (qf-1)-th root of 1 and ~e = ~. ~ is completely characte- 
rized by the two integers e and fo In case e Ip, the situation is 
more complicated. 
(ii) Let now A be a central skewfield of dimension m 2 over K, with 
maximal R-order r. ~ then contains a primitive (qm-1)-th root of 1 
A 
(cf. (6.9)), say~, and ~/rad r = R(~), 
where ~ = ~+ rad ~. K(~) 
A 
is then an unramified subfield of A, and since its dimension over 
is m, it is a maximal subfield of A. Every maximal unramified sub- 
field of A is called a field of inertia of A. In contrast to the 

232 
IV 55 
commutative case, there are infinitely many such subfields here. In 
fact, the fields of inertia constitute exactly one conJugacy class 
A 
of maximal subfields of A. For, clearly, whenever L = K( ~ ) Is a 
field of inertia, so is aLa -I = K(a ~ a -I) for any 0 # a a A; and con- 
versely any two fields of inertia, being extensions of K by some 
primitive (qm-1)-th roots of i,~ and ~' resp. are isomorphic and thus 
A 
conjugate (cf. III,(6o$)), i.e., w' = a~a -I for some 0 # a ~ Ao 
A 
Moreover, as we shall see below, A contains a totally ramified sub- 
~m 
^ 
field K(~ ) of degree m over K with 
= ~. Moreover, conjugation by 
qr 
induces the Frobenlus automorphlsm ~r ' ~' 
~ w 
, for some r, 
(r,m) = I, on one of the fields of inertia K(~ 7, and on the conju- 
gate fields a~(W)a -I 
the Frobenius automorphlsm is induced by con- 
Jugation with 
a ~ a -I. 
r is an invarlant of ~ and Hasse 
has constructed to every palr {m,r~ with (re,r) = 1, r < m, a central 
skewfield over K of dimension m 2 wlth the invariant r. Thus, for a 
fixed field K, and a distinguished prime element ~ a ~ there is 
established a one-one correspondence between the set of all central 
skewflelds of finite dimension over K and the set of pairs of rela- 
tively prime positive integers, {m,r},r < m, r/m is called the Hasse 
inv~riant of ~ over K. 
We proceed now to prove these facts.

Jugatlon by an element of A, (cf. III,(6o8)), i°eo, ~q = a~a -1 
for some 0 # a ~ A, and, if necessary by multiplying with an element 
A 
of R, we may assume that a a ~. Now, by (5°2), the left ideal r a is 
^

^S 
a power of P, that is~a 
P , for some positive integer s. We show 
that s and m are relatively prime, if we put n I = m/(s,m) ~ m, where

1 = sr - mJ, and we set ~ = ar/~ J. ~ has all the desired properties. 
For, r a r = ~sr = ~l+mJ = ~ J  
thus ~ E ~ and ~=

an element ~ a A which is a root of the irreducible polynomial 
X m -T ~ R[X], and which acts by conjugation as a Frobenius auto- 
A 
morphism Yr on L. Clearly K(~) is a totally ramified field of di- 
mension m over K and thus a maximal subfield of A. Moreover, if ~" 
A 
is any element in A such that ~m =~, 
then K(E) ~ K(~), 
by 
~ 
~ ~ , and it follows that ~ = bah -1 for some b % ~, so that also 
~ 
= rad ~ (observe that tab = r b== 
~Eb since rad ~= r= 
is 
a two-sided ideal) and b~b -1 
b-l~ -1 
b -1 
: 
~b~ 
= (b~ 
)qr induces 
the Frobenius automorphism ~r on the field of inertia K(b~b-1). 
It 
A 
still remains to show that r is an invariant of A. Assume that 
m = ~ and 
-1 
qS 
~I 
~'1~I~1 
= ~1 
for some primitive (qm-l)-th root ~1 
of 1. Then ~1 = bwb-i for some b L ~, and if we set ~= b-lElb, 
we have ~a~-i 
~qS as well as ~a}-1 
qr 
=

. From this we obtain 
~.-i= ~ - 1  
~qr-S 
~ 
~-1 
^

=

is a unit u • l" 
A 
r-s 
and thus, reducing modulo rad i 
~, we find that ~ = ~-i 
=~q 
! 
hence, since r,s < m we have indeed r = s. 
Now, since [~/P , R] = m, ~/~ is the finite field of order qm and 
its multipllcative group is generated by a primitive (qm-1)-th root 
of 1. Thus the polynomial X qm¢- 1 has an irreducible monlc factor 

Iv 58 
2~5 
of degree m in R[XS, which has a primitive (qm-1)-th root of 1 as a 
AA 
root in ~ = ~/P. But then all its roots are primitive, since they 
are conjugate under the Galois group. Moreover, by Hensel's lemma 
xqm~lChas then an irreducible factor of degree m over R all of whose 
roots are primitive (qm-1)-th roots of 1 belonging to ~ (cf. (6.9)). 
Conversely, observe that every irreducible monic polynomial 
f (X) a RtXl remains irreducible under reduction modulo rad 
m 
(cf. (6.1)). We summarize these results as follows° 
6.15 
Theorem (Hasse [ 2])s Let A be a central skewfield of dimension 
m 2 over K° Let q = [R/rad R i 1B and fix ~ such that rad R =~R. 
Then 
A 
there exists a positive integer r < m, uniquely determined by A, and 
an irreducible factor f IX] ~ RIXI of xqm-l-i so that there are ~, 
m 
~ A satisfying the conditions 
= K(~,~),f 
(w) = 0,~ m = ~ , ~w~ -1 =~qr. 
m 
Note that (r,m) = 1 is an immediate consequence of these conditions. 
Having thus shown that ~ is completely characterized by the integers 
m and r, with (r,m) = 1 we proceed to show that to every such pair 
(m,r) there exists a skewfield as in (6.15). 
6.16 
Theorem (Hasse ~Z]), To every prime element ~ a R and every 
pair of positive integers r and m, O<r<m with (r,m) = 1 there exists 
a unique central skewfield of dimension m 2 over K with the invarl- 
ant r. 
Proofl Once the existence is established, the uniqueness follows 
immediately. For, if ~,~ 
and ~', ~' are as in (6.15), 
then clearly ~, ~ ~', ~ 
= ~' induces an isomorphism 
~(~,~ 
) ~- K(~', ~') of skewfiel~over K. Thus, we assume that m 
and r, satisfying our conditions, are given and we proceed to con- 
struct a skewfield with the desired properties. We recall that 
[] 
A A  
= R/w R is a Galois field of order q. Any Galois field of order q 
can b~ considered as a Galois extension of R, thus the polynomial

IV 59 
X qm-I - 1~ ~[~has 
an irreducible factor of degree m whose roots are 
primitive (qm-1)-th rooSs of 1. and it follows by Hensel's lemma 
that X qm-1 - 1E RI~has an irreducible factor with the same proper- 
ties. We may therefore choose an irreducible polynomial f (X) t R~X~, 
m 
so that f (X) is of degree m and that its roots are primitive 
m 
(qm-l)-th roots of I. Let ~ 
be such a root• We recall that K can be 
embedded in an algebraically closed field K*, and so we may choose 
A 
a 2*, and put W = K( w ). W is then an unramifled Galois extension 
A 
r 
of degree m of K, and the correspondence ~--~ 
q 
induces the

Frobenius automorph~m 
~

s 
since (r,m) = 1. We write x (s) for ~r(X), with x & W! thus, in par- 
ticular w (s) 
rs 
= ~q 
. Now we construct ~ as a subalgebra of the alge- 
bra (W) of m~m-matrices over W. We put

It remains to show that A = K(~, _~) is a skewfield! i.e., that 
A 
every non-zero a a A is invertible. For this it clearly suffices to 
prove that every non-zero element of ~( ~)\ ^ ^ = 
wo(~) 
has a left in- 
verse in ~, where ~ is the maximal R-order in L = K(__~). For, given 
A 
^ 
^ 
A 
0 # x • A, then - since O(~) is clearly an R-order in A -, there 
exists r a K such that rx_E ~(~)\~(~)| 
and if y a A is a left 
inverse of r__x then rz_ is a left inverse of ~. Moreover if every 
non-zero element in a ring has a left inverse then every non-zero 
element has a unique left inverse, and this is a two-sided inverse. 
(Let yx = 1, then xyx - x = (xy-1)x = O~ if xy # 1, let z(xy-1) = I 
then z(xy-1)x = x = O, a contradiction.) Thus, let 
a =~j=om-i wj ~ J £ ~(_~_ )~ ~(=K ) with __wj ~ ~, for J = 0,1,...,m-1, and 
a 
A 
let h be the smallest number J for which wj ~ ~ o. Then, since L is 
A 
unramified over K! i.e., rad ~ = * ^ 
= 
mo, w 
w h is a unit in ~ and we 
may - using ~m = $ _ write a as follows s

Theorem (Hasse t3]), Let ~ be a central skewfield of dimen- 
sion m 2 over K and ~. a finite extension field of K. If m divides the 
degree of ~ over K then ~ is a splitting field o~ 
A. 
Proof, By assum~ion we have [A , K] -- m 2 
and if we let P stand for 
the maximal R-order in A, there exist r ¢ N, and ~ , ~ ~ A such that

tad P=

~m __ ~ , ~ - 1

We prove the theorem first for a field ~- whose ramification order e

is a multiple of m. Then, if I~ denotes the maximal R-°rder in E, we 
A 
have e' a N and a~', a ~ E, such that

Clearly, ~1

Now let P' be a maximal R-order in (D)s containing I~ ~ 
r. Then ~'

and reducing modulo rad ~' we obtain ~i = ~r

But ~i is a 
primitive (qt-1)-th root of 1 and, r being prime to m = s . t, we have 
(r,t) = 1 and we conclude that t = i, Hence the desired result, 
~ A = (E)m' is established for the case m ]e. 
The theorem follows now simply from the transitivity of the tensor 
product. Namely, let E have ramification order ee' and residue class 
degree ff' with ef = m. Then E = K(~ , &), where ~

lattices in A. Moreover, ~f(A ) is not only a right A-module, which 
is obvious, but it is a (possibly fractional) two-sided A-ideal. 
It follows from (IV,(4o14)), that if ~

~f (P) is indeed the inverse of ~f(~ ) as defined in (IV,(4.12))

The Higman ideal of an order 
The Higman ideal of A in A, consisting of the projective Ike-endo - 
morphisms of Jk, is investigated 
and explicitely calculated in 
terms of the Gasch~tz-Casimir operator. In particular, this re- 
applied to group ring~ Moreover Extl(M,N) is shown to be 
sult is 
an R-torsion module with trivial p-components for all p z S that 
do not divide the Higman ideal, 
We shall return now to the study of lattices over orders, 
Notationl R = a Dedekind domain with quotient field K, 
A = a finite dimensional separable K-algebra, 
A = an R-order in A, 
S = the set of prime ideals in R, 
A = the center of A, 
Ae = A ~R Aop 
the enveloping algebra of ik (cf. III,(4.1)). 
3.1 
Definition, The Higman ideal H(A) of Ik in R is the R-annihila- 
tor of Ext I (A,-)! i.e., 
Ae 
H(A) = [r ~ R : r Ext~ 
e(A'V)I 
= 0, for every V aAeMf~. 
Thus, the Higman ideal consists of all elements r of R that induce 
projective__ homomorphisms ~r £ EndAe(Ik) 
(cfo Exo 2,1). We recall 
that Ext~e(A,V) is an R-module of finite type and that a homomor- 
phism a~ is projective whenever ~ is projective (cfo (2.3)). Thus, 
H(A ) is indeed an ideal in R. In order to arrive at an explicit 
description of H(A ), and in view of ~2~we shall investigate the 
ideal of EndAe(A ) consisting of all projective homomorphisms. Since 
i %  
EndAe(/k) =A| this leads to the following definition. 
3.2 Definitionl The Hi.an ideal of A i_.n_n A is defined as

Proof, This is an immediate consequence of III,(4o5),(4.6) and (4.9), 
together with Ex. 2,1. To be more explicit, we recall that every

which belongs to the center of ~k e, and thus we have, according to 
Ex. 2,1. ~E = ~EE~ = EE~. 
By III,(~.6) and (~.9) then [~E] = 0 
if and only if ~o~ 
is an inner derivation. Now, if ~o ~ 
is inner, 
then so is ~o~ 
for all homomorphisms ~ with domain Ker Z, and thus 
g Hjk(A)o Conversely, if ~ e HA(A) , then [&E&] = 0 and ~o ~ 
must be an inner derivation. We observe, as a consequence of this 
proof, that ~ E Ha(A)

the different and the Gasch~tz-Casimir operator, commute with loca-

Extensions of lattice s 
In § 3 we gave an explicit description of the Hlgman ideal, which 
measures the deviation of an R-order from separability. However, 
from a module theoretic point of view, projective lattices play 
an outstanding rSle and thus we shall define an ideal ~( A ) which 
gives a measure for how far removed A is from being hereditary 
(cf. IV,(4.1)). But unfortunately no explicit description of ~(A ) 
seems to be available in general. 
We keep the notation of the previous sections. 
4.1 
Definitions For an R-order with center ~ , we define the J-Ideal 
of A by 
J

~ ExtA(M,N) = 0, for all 
M,N ,A~ ° } 
= { ~ ~ A ! multiplication by E is a 
o 
projective A-endomorphism for all M ~AM ~. 
With some abuse of notation we shall consider Jk C Endjk(M) (observe 
that this embedding need not be monic (cf. Ex. 2,1)) and thus, 
because of (2.4), we have 
JA(A) 
=AfI(Ma~M ° Im ~M ). 
A= 
Moreover we set J(A) = Jjk(A)• 
R.

Remark, (i) #k is hereditary if and only if 1 a J ~( Jk)! since 
J 
(A) is an ideal in #k , this means that JA (jk) = A .

is proper, as will be shown in Ex. 3,3. 
(iii) We observe that to every M a A~ f there exists a morphism 
~M £ H°mA (~'EndA(M)) that maps ~ g ~ onto multiplication by ~. 
Clearly ~M is in general not monic. J(~) 
is the intersection of the 
preimages of the sets of projective homomorphisms in ImVM, M e AM°.

Lemma (Jacobinski t 1])I Let ~ be a hereditary R-order in A con- 
tainingA. The central conductor of ~ in A is defined as 
( ~ s ~ )~ =

~ ~ ~ A~ , and we have (A , ~)~ C ~ ~(A). 
Proofs It clearly suffices to show that every element 
~ £ ( ~ s ~)d 
is projective as a A-endomorphlsm for every A-lattice. We use 
(2.3) to show this. Let

Theorem (Reiner [9]), Let G be a finite group of order n, such 
that char K ~n, set A = KG, & = RG and let M tAM °. Then Te EndA(M) 
is projective if and 0nly if there exists ~ g EndR(M ) such that 
=~G, where m TG = geG~ g-l((gm)~ ). 
Proof, If we are willing to violate our convention to write R-endo- 
morphisms as exponents, we may express this theorem in the following 
form, Im ~M = ~ ~'- g~g-1 , ~ g EndR(M)~,where the endomorphisms 
g L G 
are written on the left.

Clearly ~M is epic since M is R-projective. But~AJ is also an epi- 
morphism. To show this# it suffices to note that~ ° is epic. Thus, 
let ? a HomA(M, A) and m a M. Then for some ~rg(m)]g aG , 

262 
V 20 
m? 
= g~GS- rg(m)g -1, since {g-1}g aG is an R-basis for A. Moreover, 
since ? is a ~-homomorphism, we have rg(m) = rl(gm), and 
~, m, 
• rl(m) is a map in HomR(M,R) , so that ? = ~G, and~l~ ° is 
epic. It follows now from the commutativlty of the above diagram that 
A 
Im ~M = ImP.

To prove the converse inclusion we choose R for M in (4°5) with 
the trivial G-module structure~ i.e., R a ~M o, by gr = r, g a G. 
Then Im ~R ~ R = nR, since EndR(R) = R, because every R-endomorphism 
of R as trivial G-module is determined by its action on 1 a R, and 
multiplication by any element of R is such an endomorphism. Since

Theorem (Jacobinski t11: Roggenkamp[lOB), 
Let •= RG be the 
group ring of a finite group G of order n, such that char K X n, 
Then 
-J-a (A) = (A,I~)& and CA ,r) 1 = {nx E A , TrA/K(XI~) c R~ 
for every hereditary R-order I ~ in A that contains ~. 

264 
V 22 
Proof, For any R-lattlce M in A = KG we define the dual M* with re- 
~oect to the trace function from A to K as follows, 
M* = M*TrA/K = ~x £ A s TrA/K(XM)C R~. 
The correspondence M; 
~M* is strictly inclusion reversing! i.e., 
M1 ~C M 2 implies M*2 ~ M[, 
That inclusions are reversed is an obvious consequence of the defi- 
nition. To establish the preservation of strict inclusions it suffi- 
ces to prove this locally, since localization and dualization commuted 
i.e., R 
H R M* = (M)* for every prime ideal p a S, and we have 
P 
P 
= 
= 
M* = 
/~ 
M*, (cf. I,(8.6)), because M* is also an R-lattice 
p~S 
P 
(cf. Ex. 4,1). Let us therefore assume that R is a principal ideal 
domain, and let ~i~l_~i_~ n be an R-basls for M 1. Then ~c~i~l~_i_~_n is 
also a K-basis for A and, since A = KG is separable, there exists a 
dual basis {w*} ~j. relative to the trace function TrA/K 
i 1-z=n 
(cf. III, (3.6)). (We note that the trace function 
TrKG. 
K/ , KG x KG 
~ K is non-degenerate, since ~I/n g-l~ 
is 
g~G 
a dual basis of KG with respect to the trace function. ) Thus, ob- 
serving that TrA/K is symmetric, we obtain, (cf. Ex. 1,1), 
1 
But, if M 1~ M 2 and M 1 ~ M2, then there exists m = 
i=1 ki ~ i & M2 
with, at least for some i, k i ~ R. But then TrA/K(M ~) ~ R and 
M* ~ M*. From the definition and the symmetry of the trace it 
1 
2 
follows at once that M C M**, thus also M* C M*** as well as 
M*** D M* since inclusions are reversed. But then, because of the 
strictness of the inclusion reversal, we obtain 
M = M**. 
(Observe the rSle that the symmetry of our bilinear form is playing 
in these arguments. ) Moreover, for any R-order ~I in A, 

V 23 
265 
M ~ ~o if and only if M* ~ ~g. 
If suffices to prove one implication since the other one follows 
from the fact that M = M**. But clearly, if M ~ __~° and TrA/K(XM) C R 
M ° 
Returning now to the proof 
th~n TrA/K((X~)M) C R and thus M* £ 
of (4.12) we observe that 
A* = 
@ 
(1/n)R g-1 = (1/n)A 
g~G 
since ~(i/n)g-l~g • G is a dual basis to ~g}g ~G relative to the trace 
function, (cf. III,(3.8)), and since A is R-free@ If now ~ is any 
R-order in A containing A, then h*r is the smallest right T-lattice 
containing A*. Hence ( A*~)* is the largest left IX-lattice contained 
in A, i.e., 
But also, 
(~*r)* = (~,r) I. 
( A-r)* = ((l/n) h r)* = n(~)* 
is a right r-module, so that the left conductor ( A It) 1 is a two- 
sided T-idealo This proves the second equality and the first equali- 
ty of (4.12) follows from (4.8) in case r is hereditary. 
# 
We remark that this proof can be carried over to the case of any 
R-order in A provided that the dual of A with respect to some non- 
degenerate bilinear form is of the form ~A with ~ in the center
