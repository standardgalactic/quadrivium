DVD 11 – Advanced Stage Hypnosis Routines & 
How to Invent New Routines
Create Your Own Routines
Spencer:
He’s handing on by a thread. I’ll bet. He’s losing it. That’s probably a pretty 
good term there. 
Well, we’re going to lose it a little bit more, but not too much. We’re going to 
slow it down a little bit because I want to talk about some other things. 
Before I do, how did you guys like doing that? Yeah! So are you guys 
starting to get the groove of it, man? Are you starting to feel like you’re a 
real professional competent, confident and extreme powerful stage 
hypnotist?
You guys are. I’m telling you right now. I’m looking at you, and I can see 
this confidence just oozing out of you. This is good. I know you’re also 
drained and exhausted, so I recognize both aspects going on, but that’s 
good because when you get to this point, you’ve got to go further. You’ve 
got to go a little bit further. 
I can tell you that from my career that sometimes I get exhausted being on 
the road and sometimes you’re just wiped out and you’ve just got one more 
show to do and I’m just going, oh no, I can’t do it. I’ll be laying in the room 
going I really just don’t even want to get up. I just want to stay in bed. I just 
want to watch some stupid thing on TV or I’ll turn on my light and sound 
machine instead and just zone out. I use that every single day.
I know that I’ve got to do one more show. I’ve just got to do it. I’ve got to be 
ready for it. I anchor myself, like I talked about before. I go there, get on 
stage and do that last thing and give it everything I’ve got, and then I drop 
for a week or two. 
So when you’re done with this, you can go home and drop for a week or 
two, after you book your first show. Then you can drop because you’ve got 
a show coming up, a big show. 
Let me ask you how many of you plan on doing your first big comedy 
hypnosis show within the next 30 days? Raise your hands. I like that, a
whole bunch of you.
So let’s do this. Let’s go down this list here. You guys have done all these 
really incredibly cool techniques. Now I have a few more techniques here–
two more skits. Instead of breaking down into groups and getting 
yourselves all bottled again, let’s just talk about it, and I’m going to open it 
up. I’m going to throw out a routine, and you guys just tell me what you

would do with, and I’ll tell you what I might do with it. How does that sound? 
That will give your mind a little bit of a break. 
I’m starting to see people out there dropping. How many of you people here 
are married? Raise your hand if you’re married. How many of you are in a 
relationship? Let me ask you this, let’s narrow it down. How many of you 
are married or in a relationship and planning on taking this as a serious full-
time career? Quite a few of you, okay. Awesome!
You’re going to need a very supportive partner. You’ve got that? That’s right 
on. So you’re going to need a very supportive partner, because it’s a very 
unique profession and oftentimes, it will take you to places that you don’t 
take a spouse or a buddy with. Sometimes you just have to go on your own. 
I’m letting you know this ahead of time to work on your relationships and 
keep them solid because you need to put as much energy into your 
relationship as you do into your job. You don’t want to lose that because of 
your passion for what you’re going to be doing because it is something that 
can easily overtake you and it can become your mistress or your mister. 
I know I had to give you the down side to it. There’s always a downside, but 
a supportive partner, man. Bring your partner into your work. Let them know 
what it is that you’re doing. Share your life with them. Share your work. 
Invite them to go with you everywhere that you do. Make them a part of it. 
Maybe they can be that part that takes the phone calls for you. 
They could be your manager. They could do all your bookings. They can 
take care of the paperwork. Include them in what you’re doing. Make them 
feel important in it. That’s all I’m going to say. So you guys work that out, 
and you’re going to be good with it. 
With that said, I’ve got a lot of things to say though. I’ll say more about that 
tomorrow when we get to the business aspect of it. Right now, get ready for 
a microphone, and when you do get a microphone, you’re going to stand up 
and you’re going to speak into the microphone. You guys are good at this. 
Let’s just say the individual I’m touching right now, this is your luckiest day 
in the world. This is your luckiest day in the world. What would you do with 
that routine? I’m looking for some feedback. Here’s a guy right who knows 
right now, this is your luckiest day in the world. What are you going to do?
I would say this is your luckiest day in the world. You have won a lotto 
ticket, but you can’t find it. It’s somewhere in your pockets or on your body, 
but you can’t find it. You’re checking everywhere for it, but you can’t find it. 
No matter how hard you try, you won’t take off your clothes, but you can’t 
find that ticket and it’s getting frustrating.

You are one mean guy. I like it. I like that. That’s very awesome. Yeah, 
you’re the luckiest person, you won the lottery ticket, it’s somewhere on 
your body and you can’t find it. You’re looking everywhere. Clothes stay on, 
but you’re looking everywhere and you can’t find it. Very good. 
Does anybody else have an idea on that, the luckiest day in the world, right 
here?
Okay, it’s the luckiest day in the world for you. You’ve just won the Nobel 
Peace Prize and everyone here is waiting for your speech. 
Cool. So this is the luckiest day in the world for you. You’ve just won the 
Nobel Peace Prize. I’m going to count to three, and on three you’re eyes 
will open. I’m going to give you the microphone and you can give us your 
acceptance speech, because you are the luckiest guy in the world on the 
luckiest day. Here’s the microphone. 1-2-3, and the guy grabs it. Very cool. 
Anybody else? Just when you thought it was all over, we’re going to pick 
your brains some more. We’re going to bring out the juices.
All right, you’re the luckiest person in the world. You just won $1 million. I 
want you to express to the audience how excited you are and give shout 
outs to your family and friends and go as wild as you want. Let him do a 
little speech to the family. 
All right. I like that, and you can even do that as a group. This is your 
luckiest day in the world. On the count of three, open your arms. We’re 
going to find out just what happened to you guys. Boom, boom, boom. Then 
you can rip them down.
Go ahead, my dear.
This is the luckiest day in your life. You’ve won $10 million and you can’t tell 
anyone, but every time someone says to you, how come you look so happy, 
if you tell them that you won $10 million, you won’t get the check. 
I like that. Very cool. I can kind of relate to that. I can’t tell you exactly where 
that came from, but you know I got one. 
It’s recording your every move.
It’s recording my every move? It means nothing because we don’t know 
exactly where it came from, and that’s all I have to promise. 
This is the luckiest day of the world for you. You just won the lottery, and 
you’re going to be doing your lucky dance that helped you win that lottery. 
So get going.

Oh, so in a moment, I’m going to count to three, the music begins and 
you’re going to give us your lucky dance. 
That’s right. And anyone who joins in gets to share the lottery with you.
Good. There you go. Now you got everybody involved with it. I like it. 
The only problem is their share of the lottery comes out of your pocket. 
Oh no, wow. There you go. You bring them up and then tear them down.
Yes, sir?
Today is the luckiest day of your life. You just won $10 million, but do you 
see those people sitting next to you. One of them is going to steal it 
tomorrow and you’ve got figure out which one it is.
Very cool. And how can you build on that? 
What you do is you walk behind them, and you’ll notice that they either,
have wallets or pocketbooks. Look at their butts. As you look at their butts, 
you’ll notice one of them just has that, look at the butt and you’ll know by 
looking at it which one it is, and when you find it… I don’t know what you 
can do that’s PG13. When you find that butt, identify that person and ask 
them why they’re going to steal your money. Confront them with it and 
make a deal with them that maybe they won’t steal it and maybe you can do 
something together nice with it. 
Cool. I like it. Good. Does anybody else want to do this? There’s someone 
right there, so you don’t have to walk so far. 
Today’s the luckiest day in your life. The girl that you’ve been pursuing (or 
man) forever, Brad Pitt or Angelina Jolie, it doesn’t matter who it is, has 
called you and asked you on a date. The problem is you haven’t had a 
shower in three days because you’ve been camping. You’ve only got three 
minutes to primp yourself before they pick you up in the limo. 
On the count of three, open your eyes. Get your primped proper for this 
meeting. Then you can have a little bag of makeup over here to the side. So 
you can build on that. Over here, I’m going to give you this little bag of 
makeup. You have to have more of your props. 
I’ve got this great big bag full of props for every occasion, so I’m always 
thinking what can I do? What’s in my bag? So I’ll take out some makeup. I 
have this little makeup kit. It’s got mascara, it’s got lipstick and I even have 
panties and bra and all that kind of stuff. Really make yourself look hot. 
Very cool. Get themselves all clowned up. That’s pretty goofy. It’s a lot of 
fun. Yes, dear?

Today is your luckiest day in your life because you find the source that from 
now on all your questions will be answered. 
You’ve found the source? Now with that, do you know what I think I would 
do? You found the source. The individual I’m touching right now, in a 
moment I’m going to count to three, your eyes open, you are the source. 
You are the source with all the answers because the luckiest person here in 
the world has questions for you. Count of three your eyes open, 1-2-3. And 
so why are you so lucky? Oh because I found the source. The source? 
Where is the source? Oh, I’m the source. 
So you’ve got another thing going on there. See how you can just fall into 
these things? You’ve got to be quick on your toes. 
Do you have a microphone? Please stand up.
This is the luckiest day because you just saved 10% on car insurance. I 
would recommend canceling your other insurance after the big accident. 
Yeah, why not just make him a little lizard. 
And you’re now the Geico lizard. 
There you go. 
It’s the luckiest day in your life because you just won the Academy Awards 
that you’ve been trying to get for 20 years 1-2-3, acceptance speech.
That’s fine. They get up there and then you have music in the background 
for the acceptance speech. So you have to have all this stuff set up. It’s 
already in your mind, it’s in the frame. On the count of three, open your 
eyes and give the acceptance speech. 1-2-3, eyes open up. Oh wow, this is 
so cool. You won, man. Come on up here. Here’s a microphone. Tell us 
what it’s like when the music begins automatically. Then the music starts 
and he gives his little speech. 
So you have all these things set up in your mind so when you’re doing 
these routines, you already have this going in your mind what’s going to 
happen. You’re five steps ahead all the time. It’s like playing chess. You’re 
ahead of everybody at all times. It’s on that mental programming. Listen to 
it. You’ll get it. 
One more and then we’re going to move on to the next one. 
You’re the luckiest person in the world because I have here in my pocket a 
check for $1 million for the first person to show me their belly button. Then I 
put them all out and tell them they haven’t got a belly button.

Okay, so I’ve got a check in my pocket for $1 million for the first person that 
does what now?
To show me their belly button, but I’ve put them all out and tell them they 
haven’t got one. When they look for it, they can’t find.
Oh, they can look for it, but they can’t find it. Okay, that’s kind of funny. I like 
that because it’s like, show me your belly button and you can have this 
money. Then they go and they can’t find their belly button. Where’s my belly 
button? That’s cool. 
And then you can do, is it an innie or is it an outie? It’s a little kid thing right.
Have you got an innie or an outie? How many people here have an inny? 
Raise your hand. How many have an outie? I’m just kind of curious. I’m 
telling you, this is how my mind works. I’m just kind of curious about who’s 
got an innie and who’s got an outie.
All right, let’s go on to the next one. All right, here’s a good one. How about 
the individual I’m touching right now, you are the world’s sexiest spy. 
Actually, this will follow up, you get the guy up and you tell him he’s the 
world’s sexiest spy. Then you have two different ladies, and you tell them 
that they are his co-spies, and they’re both in love with him, but he has to 
choose which one he’s going to take on the next mission. So they’re 
arguing over him, but they can’t hit each other. He’s in the middle and he’s 
got to decide, and the world is about to explode.
The plot thickens. I like that, yeah. You have these women in a cat fight. 
Now you want to frame that very carefully. When you’re giving this 
information on that kind of skit, it’s a lot of fun. 
In a moment, I’ll count to three, the person I’m touching you are the world’s 
sexiest spy. You’ve got these two beautiful women assistants, they’re 
fighting over you and they’re going to fight over you. Boy, I’ll tell you what,
they’re going to fight like I’ve never seen anybody fight. However, listen 
very carefully, you two ladies, you assistants, you will not touch each other. 
You will say whatever you want to each other. You will get just as nasty as 
you want, but you will not hit anybody at all, but you verbally say whatever 
you want. 
No spitting. No whizzing on somebody. I was doing this nightclub show and 
I gave this suggestion, and this guy was out there. I said, you can say 
whatever you want. I said something like, ladies and gentlemen, you get 
very angry. You want to start a fight with me. I love doing it. I said, but you 
can’t get on my stage and you can’t throw anything at me.

So this guy is back there, and he gets on a chair and he starts taking the 
chair and getting it closer and getting it closer. Then he gets up there and 
just throws it at me, and I’m going, oh this is not good. So always be a little 
bit careful because you don’t want the audience people to get hurt either. 
Yes, go ahead, sir?
You’re the world’s sexiest spy, and it’s your mission to romance one of the 
other contestants on the stage. What you don’t realize is that you have the 
world’s worst body odor. 
Oh, good. I like that. Okay, so go on and build on that. But you have the 
worst body odor. How would you complete that? But you have the worst 
body odor. You’ve got to put your people up here. 
What I would be looking for is what the person who is supposed to be 
seduced is going to be doing. 
Okay, and…
And you, the person who’s being seduced, realize that this is a spy and you 
have to put up with him, but you’re trying to escape while he’s making his 
advances.
Okay. Anybody else?
Hello? You’re the world’s sexiest spy and you’re in the President’s office. 
He’s about to tell him the secret code word, but you have the worst case of 
stuttering and you just can’t get that word out to tell the President, and the 
President is just sitting there waiting for you with the code word.
I like that. I had this guy in Dubai and made him really hate my guts bad. 
He’s out in the audience and he’s just yelling at me every time I said this 
trigger word. He’s out there cussing at me. I mean he’s using words that 
you don’t use in Dubai. You can’t use naughty words there, and you can’t 
drink alcohol in public. There are some very strict things going on there. 
So I had this big list of do’s and don’ts from the management at the theater 
that I couldn’t do. But you know me. It’s hard to keep me down. So I had 
figure out a way around it. So, it’s like, I’m not going to give a suggestion, 
but I’ll let him say whatever he wants to. So he starts using language that’s 
really bad and I’m judging the audience because I wanted to hear how the 
audience would react. 
If I hear them going oh no, then I’m going to calm it down very quickly, but 
they’re out there going whoa, yeah. Get him, get him. I knew the 
management was going to be after me later that evening too. So he’s out 
there bantering at me and I said look at you, you keep talking, but your

tongue is falling out. As you’re talking me, your tongue is falling out of your 
mouth.
So he’s sitting there cussing at me, mumbling. You know what I’m saying, 
right? I said, don’t tell me. Turn around and tell the audience. So he’s 
mumbling. You can turn these things around in so many different varieties, 
and I think I have that on YouTube somewhere if you want to go look it up, 
under sleep now. 
What I would do is use the world’s sexiest spy, but what I would do is 
reverse the roles. I would make it a female spy and she has the worst case 
of halitosis. The individual she’s trying to seduce, this guy, he has the 
secret information. She’s trying to seduce him, but he keeps running. He 
keeps moving over or running around the chairs. They’re staying on stage 
and they’re not doing anything violent. She’s just trying to woo him. I’d 
make sure she looked really good.
You’d do that hypnotically, right?
I just think it would be funny to watch a beautiful woman chase a guy 
around with stink breath.
That’s cool. Well, how about you take it a step further. The person I’m 
touching right now, you’re the world’s most beautiful female spy, but it’s 
really a guy. I’m not saying a transvestite, but you know the way the mind 
works. So it’s kind of fun to add that dimension. The person I’m touching 
right now, you’re the world’s sexiest spy. You are a female, and you are so 
hot. It’s incredible. You’ve got halitosis, but this person over here wants you 
bad and wants your information. 
It’s another guy, and this guy’s trying to get close. So there’s another 
dimension, or something you might add to give it a little bit more comedy, 
this woo factor. It’s like all the sudden, there’s two guys going after each 
other. That’s insane. 
Okay, cool. One more on the sexiest guy, okay.
You’re the world’s sexiest spy, but you’ve got a bad case of crabs, so you 
can’t stop itching yourself. 
Okay. I know what kind of shows you’re going to be doing. Let’s go onto the 
next routine. Sounds like high school? You haven’t worked in the bars I’ve 
been in. 
All right, let’s go onto another one. This time let’s do it this way. The person 
I’m touching right now, you are a country rock star. You’re a country rock 
star. Who’s going to do something out there? Let’s have some new blood

out there. Raise your hands new blood. Come on, man. Stretch your brains. 
You’ve got to stretch your brain, a country-rock star. 
All right, there’s new blood right over there. Look at Matt. He hasn’t said a 
word. You know who Matt is, don’t you? He’s that good-looking guy in the 
suit. 
Thank you. Thank you very much. 
We haven’t got to Elvis yet.
I’d have them sing me a song about his ex-wife and his horse. 
Okay.
I’d just let him take his imagination and go from there. 
Very good. I like that. That’s good. Yeah, so you’re a country rock star. I’m 
going to count to three, open your eyes, you’re a country rock star, and
you’re going to sing a song about your ex-wife and your horse. That’s good.
Now remember, when you’re doing these, most people have a very creative 
imagination that are really in trance. So on something like that, I might save 
for working in a nightclub where you’re going to have bunch of yahoos in 
there. I’m not saying that in a negative way, but we typecast people. 
Go ahead, Brian, and then I’ll get to you.
Yeah, you’re a country rock star, and you don’t have any voice. Only fifth 
word you say will be out loud. 
Okay, you’re a country rock star and every fifth word that you say will be out 
loud. Very cool. Okay. I like that, yeah. It’s amazing what people will do. I 
think you had your hand up next.
You’re a country rock star, but you only perform with your horse on stage. 
Part of your act is that you do quite a lot of moving around and dancing, and 
it happens that your horse has diarrhea on this particular night. 
Okay. Yuk. Okay, let’s go onto the next one. Your horse has diarrhea. You 
know what? Personally, I would stay away from crabs and diarrhea in my 
show. This is about you becoming yourself and doing your shows, so have 
fun with it.  
Yes? Stand up.

You’re a country rock star and you’ve just found out that Taylor Swift stole 
your song and the lyrics that you wrote, and she’s claiming that she wrote 
them. You’re having an interview with People Magazine about American’s 
sweetheart and what you have to say about that. 
Very cool. There’s a good one, kids. We’ve got time for one more. 
You’re a country rock star, and let’s say you’re a guy, you’d be Garth 
Brooks or somebody like that, but when you start to sing, you’re going to 
sing as a female. Or if you’re a female, then you would be singing as a 
man, so opposite singing. 
Okay, very cool. Let’s just do one more with some new blood. New blood 
and we have just run out of time. Thank you all so much. Time is up and we 
are going to be taking a break right now for lunch. Enjoy your lunch, and we 
will see you back here at 7:30 p.m. One hour from now.

All right, folks. Here’s what I’m thinking of doing. Let’s have a look at the 
time. We’re at 8:00, so we’re going to have a nice easy evening. What I 
want to do is take you through some more demonstration. Before the break
Spencer talked to you about different skits you can do different routines and 
so on. 
So what I thought we’d do now is again bring them back to life a little bit so 
you can actually watch them in action and see a true master at work. 
Maybe you can think in the back of your mind, this is what I’ll be doing so 
once I become a successful stage hypnotist. So you actually see the feel of 
the performance, as well as just the idea of the routine. Do you see the 
difference?
So unless anyone has any other question, I’m just going to hand you over 
to Spence, and let him carry on with what he’s really good at. Any 
questions? In that case, give Spence a big round of applause.
Applause
All right. Well, what do you want to do? Learn? Burn? Burn the learning into 
your brain. Okay, where did we end up last time? With a bunch of people up 
here sleeping, right? Do you want to see some more routines? I’ll just move 
through them real quick.
Yes.
Okay, I need some volunteers, someone who hasn’t been up here before, 
new blood. If you have not been up here before, come on up here. How are 
you doing?
Good.
I haven’t met you yet, have I.
Nope.
How are you doing?
Good. 
I’ll put you right over there. Here we go. All right. How many of you are 
really exhausted at this point, awfully tired? You look awfully tired. If I can 
show you a way to have fun in just about 30 minutes, you’d like that, right?

And because we’re going to do this, I’m going to throw a little wrench into it. 
Please come on up here. I’m going to have a little fun with this. Okay, come 
on up here, big guy. Over here, you are going to be my assistant hypnotist 
tonight. 
Applause
How do you like that? That’s the good thing about being the hypnotist. You 
can do whatever you want. You can pull anybody from out of the crowd and 
say, you’re going to be my assistant. I’ve been watching you and I think 
you’re pretty cool.
Thank you, sir. 
You’re welcome. You didn’t have to say that, but thank you. All right, so 
here’s what we’re going to do. We’ve got some skits in here. Let’s pull up 
some new skits. Do we have different music on these other skits? I don’t 
want to go through the same ones. Or should I just do it off the top of my 
mind.
Yeah, top of your mind.
All right. We don’t care about the music, but we want music because we’re 
used to music. 
We’re going to do this together. I’m going to do one and then you do one. 
All right? What I want you to do is first let’s get these guys hypnotized. So 
let’s do this. You stand over on this side. Everybody sit back in your chairs. 
Now remember what we did earlier. 
Somewhat.
Somewhat? Okay, I want you to get serious, and let’s go through it. I want 
these guys all hypnotized, and I need it done just like that. Time is wasting.
How are you doing, sir?
Good.
That’s good. Sleep!

Are you trying to take her ring? I saw that. I got that. Come on over here. 
Who’s out there clicking? A bunch of clickers. When I was doing my show 
the other day, I was doing that all the time. Every time I’d click, you’d hear 
like 500 people all clicking at the same time. 
Get your head off of there. Okay. 
In just a moment, I’m going to count to 3, and we’re going to have a 
good time. 
Remember how we do this? Get over here. Pick one. Oh, you like that one,
don’t you? All right. I’m going to let you pick the routines.

In just a moment, I’m going to count to 3. Everybody sit up in your 
chairs and open your eyes, feeling fantastic in every way. The 
individual I’m touching right now, sleep very deeply. You’re going to 
sit up in your chair, and you are the world’s sexiest spy. You are the 
world’s sexiest spy. 
Do you have the number on that? Give him the number. Number six. 
The individual I’m touching right now, sit up and you will be the 
world’s sexist spy. Now listen very carefully. The people that are 
sitting around you, they’re like bad guys from around the world. It’s 
your job to find out who they are, but they don’t know who you are. 
You’re just a sexy spy, and you’re going to go around and you’re 
going to talk to them and get into every one of these people’s heads 
and figure out who they are. 
Now listen all you guys I’m touching right now, there is spy in here. 
You don’t know who it is. You’re going to be very curious about who

Oh really? So what’s a really bad person?
He looks bad. 
He looks bad. So what is it about him that’s bad?
He looks naughty. 
Laughter
He’s naughty? What is he doing that’s naughty?
He’s looking away. 
He’s looking away. Okay. So what’s he doing? What do you think 
he’s doing by looking away?
He’s trying to not let me find out who he is. 
Oh really? 
Now I want to point out something. I had the microphone. She took it into 
her hand, right? Never let your subject take the microphone away from you. 
Always take it back, unless it’s something that you’re doing. There are two 
reasons for that. 
1. You always want to control your stage.
2. If you’ve got a microphone that’s expensive and they’re hypnotized, 
they might drop it on the floor and you may lose like $800 for a 
microphone. 
So I always guard these with my life. If I give them a microphone, I always 
give them one of those cheap Radio Shack type ones that you can pick up 
for like $29.95. All right. So just keep that in mind. 
Wow. So who else is up here? Oh yeah, so tell me about this guy.
I think he has a secret.
Really? What do you think that secret is? I know that you were 
taught to read minds. 
He has weapons of mass destruction.
Really?
Applause

I bet he’s sitting on them, too, right? So tell me about these weapons 
of mass destruction. What do you think he’s got down there?
He’s just kind of dangerous.
Really? How dangerous do you think he is?
He could be a spy. 
He could be a spy? Wow. What if they’re all spies, do you think 
maybe these guys are all spies?
Just me.
Just you? Do you know what? I was reading your résumé and I hear
that you can actually read people’s minds. 
Yeah, that’s true.
This is awesome, and you can really know what people are thinking. 
I mean you can look at a person, and you know what’s on their mind. 
You do, don’t you?
I do. 
What’s on my mind?
It’s dirty.
Laughter and Applause
She’s right. Let’s get some other responses out of her. 
I’m going to point to a few people, and you kind of give me an idea 
what’s on their mind. Okay? Because you’re really good at this, and I 
really like a spy that knows everything. For example, what’s this guy 
all about?
Oh, he likes lollypops.
Okay, wow. So he likes lollypops. Yeah, that’s nice. 
He likes green lollypops. 
Green lollypops, right on. Well, that’s pretty good. You are very good 
at this. Tell me, how did you learn this?

Um, I went to spy school.
Oh, you went to spy school. Well, this is very, very cool. 
I’ll tell you what, as a professional competent, confident stage hypnotist, 
you have your moments. 
How about this guy down here in the black shirt? Look at that. 
What’s that weird thing on his chest?
It’s a suck. So I think he likes to do sucking.
Laughter
Oh wow. Okay. Wow. We want to stay away from that one, right? He 
just sucks secrets out of your mind, right? Yeah, you’re a good spy. 
How about this guy over here in the black jacket and the dark hair?
Oh, he knows martial arts. 
Whoa. You are good. What kind of martial arts does he know?
Like Tae Bo.
Tae Bo. You do that very, very well. I like the way you do that. You 
really are a nice spy. I like that. So tell me, if I want to be a spy like 
you, what do I need to do?
You have to wear really sexy clothes, and then you have to go to spy 
school.
Oh really? Do you think I have a chance of that?
Hmmm. Maybe. 
Okay, maybe. Very well. Go ahead and have a seat back over there.
Everyone, give her a round of applause. Make her feel good.

Sleep very deeply. Let’s just burn it up a little bit. The guy I’m
touching right now is sleeping very, very deeply. The person I’m 
touching right now, sleep very, very deeply. There you go.
In a moment, I’m going to count to three, the music will begin. You’re 
going to stand up and you’re going to look across and see the most 
beautiful woman you’ve ever seen standing up looking for you. This 
is the best thing that’s ever happened to you in your entire life. I’m 
going to count to three, and you’re going to stand up, and the most 
beautiful woman you’ve ever seen is going to stand looking directly 
at you. 
You know who she is because she will be standing up looking 
directly at you. You want a little bit of the action. You’re going to have 
so much fun. You’re going to want to dance with her because she is 
hot. She has got the most sandals on her feet. Love the T-shirt. 
You’re going to dance. You’re going to come together like you’ve 
never danced before. When the music begins, when I count to 3, 
you’re on. 
The individual I’m touching right now, sleep very, very deeply. I’ve 
got a treat for you because I know you’re here alone and you want 
something bad. So I’ve got a special date for you. On the count of 3, 
the music will begin, you will stand up, you will look to your left and 
you’ll see the most beautiful woman standing up. She is hot, 
beautiful, the nicest thing in the room. You just want a little bit of that 
action. You will dance with her like you’ve never danced before. 
You’re going to be a little shy, maybe a little coy coming together, 
checking each other out, wondering what’s going to happen. But 
then you come together and you will embrace, and you will dance 
the dance of love and passion. Get ready. On 3, getting up and 
looking at the woman on the right getting up, looking at the woman to 
the left getting up, and you will get together, dancing like you’ve 
never danced before and you dig it.
Here we go. 1-2-3. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah.

for us. Twirl around, easily. Come on, whisper sweet nothings in 
each other’s ears. I know you love it. 
On the count of 3, open your eyes, you are stuck together and your 
hands are stuck to the other person. 1-2-3, eyes wide open, and 
you’re stuck to that person, wide awake. Hey, what’s going on here?
Um, she wasn’t what I thought she’d be.
Oh, she wasn’t? What did you think she was going to be?
I was hoping she’d be a lot taller.
A lot taller, but you’re not too disappointed, right? Here, turn around 
here for a second so I can talk to you a little bit better. You’re not 
really disappointed, are you?
Well, it depends on what I wanted.
How about you? You look like you’re having a good time.
Yeah.
Laughter
I don’t really think so, but we’ll go with it anyway. Is this something 
you normally do in public?
Yeah.
How about you? Wide awake, you’re with a guy. Hey, guys. What 
are you doing? What’s happening here? What are you doing with this 
guy?
I don’t know. I don’t think he likes me
You don’t think he likes you. What are you up to here?

Hypno-Heckler
Spencer:
Pick a number, any number, my friend. So do you see what’s happening 
here is that you get the people and you have a little dynamic going on. You 
may have a routine in your mind on something you want to perform, but 
within each routine there is a lot of leeway to improvise. 
I never know what I’m going to do. I just kind of look at the people and I play 
with them, and then I kind of go, what are they going to say? Then I can 
respond to something that they say, whether it’s them or the world’s sexiest 
spy. So there are all these things you can come up with within your mind 
that you can throw in a one-liner or something like that and you can play off 
it.
Now something I like to do in the shows that you saw me here earlier with 
the little heckler, is I like to have somebody out in the audience who gets 
really antagonistic towards me. The reason I do that is because I’ve been 
up here messing with them, and the audience likes to see people finally get 
even with the hypnotist. So I do this because I’m just that kind of a guy. 
Sleep very, very deeply here Doug. 
I’m going to pick him because he’s a big honcho. 
Now listen very carefully, Doug. I’m going to send you back out into 
the audience because I need more room up here. But for now sleep
very deeply. I’m going to put you out there, but whenever you hear 
me say the words 
, whenever you hear me say 
the words 
, you jump up and you tell me to shut 
up in no uncertain terms.
You just don’t like the way that I say 
. Every time 
I say the words 
, it just irritates you. You just 
don’t like it at all. In fact, you don’t like me. You have no idea why I 
am up here. Whenever I say the words 
, it 
irritates you, and you tell me to shut up in no uncertain terms.
Listen carefully, each time I say it, you get madder and madder. You 
will yell at me. You will say whatever you want to me. You will not 
throw anything at me. 
Remember, I told you earlier about that safety feature?
You will not throw anything at me. You will not spit on me. You will 
not pee on me. You will not shake your thing. You will leave

everything in place. You can only verbally say and abuse me 
however you want to. 
If you’re in an auditorium and there are children, you’ll say, please watch 
your language. So be respectful of the audience that you’re in at all times.
I’m going to count to 3, I’m going to send you back out into the 
audience. Whenever you hear me say the words 
, it makes you very upset and you tell me to shut up in no 
uncertain terms. 
Finally, if you want to come up here to the stage and you want to 
pick a fight with me. You want to pick a fight with this hypnotist 
because you’re tired of it. You’ve had it, and you want to come up 
here and have a piece of me. 
This guy’s big. I’m taking a risk.
If you try to get up on my stage, you’re going to lose your favorite 
body part. Be very careful. If you try to get up on my stage, you may 
lose your favorite body part.
I’ve had people that don’t care. That’s when it gets scary.
On the count of 3, open your eyes, wide awake. Was it Doug or 
Douglas, what do you prefer?
Doug.
Having a good time so far?
Yeah, it’s fun. 
Yeah, it’s great, huh? Man this is awesome. I like you a lot. You’re a 
good guy, but you keep falling asleep and I need a little bit more 
space up here, so I’m going to have you go back out into the 
audience. Is that cool with you?
Sure.
Maybe I’ll use you later. Maybe you can come back up here, but I 
think you’ll have more fun, okay? 
Okay.
Thanks a lot, man.

Remember what I said earlier, everything is a deepener. Do you remember 
what we did in the preshow? Everything you hear around you makes you go 
deeper into hypnosis. So, during the entire show, no matter where we’re at, 
everything is still happening, it’s still occurring. It doesn’t matter if you’re in
Timbuktu. It doesn’t matter if you’re in Dubai; LA; Chicago; New York or 
Toronto, Canada. It doesn’t even matter if you’re right here in Las Vegas, 
Nevada.
Be careful how you say that!
Pardon me?
Be careful how you say that.
Doug? Is that you? Be careful about what? Is there something 
wrong?
Oh, be careful.
Okay, that’s cool. No big deal. Anyway, we’re going to go on and we’re 
going to do some more stuff here. Give me another number. And 23 is

In a moment, I’m going to count to three. At number three, everybody 
up here, sit up in your chairs. You’re all little kids, you’re 6 years old. 
You’re only about 6 years old. Happy times only. On the count of 
three, open your eyes, and you’re just little children, and you’re 
having a lot of fun. You guys are all very, very hyper. You can’t sit in 
your chairs very well. You’re moving and fidgeting all over the place. 
Your mind is spinning, and let me tell you something, do not let me 
catch you making faces at me behind my back when I’m talking to 
the audience right here because we will be on TV. You be on your 
very best behavior. If I catch you making faces at me behind my 
back – I know you want to – you’re going to be in big, big trouble. 
On the count of three, open your eyes; you’re children, 6 years old 
here in Las Vegas, Nevada.
I’m trying.

Excuse me?

I’m watching. I’ve got some kids up here.

Okay, I’m going to keep an eye on you because I don’t trust you.
You don’t trust me?
On the count of three, open your eyes you’re little kids– 1-2-3, wide

interrupting.
Are you watching this?
Because they’re having a good time in Las Vegas, Nevada.
They’re having a good time in Las Vegas, Nevada?
Who threw that shoe at me? Did you?
He did it.
Did you throw that at me? You guys are going to get in big trouble in 
just a minute.
I bet they have to call out the cops every time you’re here.
They always call the cops on me in Las Vegas, Nevada. Las Vegas,
Nevada is the place where the cops look for me every single time.
Yeah, I bet they find you too.
Yeah, they might find me. Go sit down. I’m trying to do a show. Get 
out of here.
I think I’ll sit over here and just keep an eye on you.
Las Vegas, Nevada?

Laughter and applause
Good thing it’s a dark color, right? I’ll send you the dry cleaning bill. 
No big deal. Sleep! Hey, what are you doing over here? Hey, hey, 
hey, what are you guys fighting about?
She’s hitting me.
Well you shouldn’t be so stinky?
I’m not stinky.
Oh really? Is she? Why is she?
Because she’s hitting me and she’s saying it’s me.
Will you guys quit fighting? Here, let me move you. Let me separate 
you guys. Why don’t you come over here, little girl. I’ll put you right 
there. There you go. Is that better?
No, yes!
Very good. Sleep! Now listen very carefully. The next time I say Las 
Vegas, Nevada, you get a thousand times madder. Each time I say 
it, you get a thousand times more upset until you literally want to 
come up here and kick my butt. You are done with me, wide awake 
there, Doug.
Hey, what are you guys doing? Hey, hey, hey get up here. I’m trying 
to do this. What are you girls doing back there? Get up here. Get up 
here right now, children. Get up here. What is wrong with you? Sit 
down here. I need you to watch my back. I need you to watch my 
back. What are you doing down there?
I’m just hiding.
What are you hiding from?
You.
Me? Why are you hiding from me?
Because that man says you’re bad.

Sit beside me.
I can protect you. Come on up here. Don’t listen to Doug. He’s not in 
his right mind.
I won’t hit you anymore. 
Yeah, don’t hit her anymore and I’ll protect you from this guy in Las 
Vegas, Nevada.
No you won’t!
Oh yes, I will. In Las Vegas, Nevada, I am in control of the situation.
Hey, kids. You saw what a rotten guy he is didn’t you?
He’s not rotten.
Go get him.
Don’t listen to him.
Laughter
Oh the tide is turning on me. Not in Las Vegas, Nevada. Las Vegas, 
Nevada is the place. Las Vegas, Nevada, nobody hides from me in 
Las Vegas, Nevada.
Everybody hides from me. They hear you’re coming to town and they 
all go…
This is where it’s all happening. Sleep!
Why don’t we just leave him here, he’s not so tough now, is he?
Laughter
There are a lot of different things that – I’ll just leave him down there. 
I’m going to count to three, open your eyes right here, Doug. You’re 
just a little kid. You’re 6 years old. You’re going to come up here and 
have fun with all the other little kids. The problem is, Doug, that when 
you sit down, you’re going to have the worst smell coming from the
people next to you.

roses. 1-2-3, come on up here. Hi, come on up here. How are you 
doing there, little guy?
Hey. It’s fun.
Do you want to have some fun with us?
Yeah. 
What?
All the people.
Oh, they’re just people here watching. It’s our TV audience. We’re 
doing a TV show. Are you having fun?
We’re on TV?
Yeah, we’re on TV. Hi, how old are you?
Six, I think.
Six. Wow! Good for you.
So I’ll explain to you what I’m doing. When you’re doing a hypnosis show, 
you can go from one routine to another routine very quickly. Did you see 
how that works? 
Hey, what are you guys doing?
She’s pinching me and pulling my hair?
Are you pinching her and pulling her hair?
Yeah.
Laughter
She did it.
She did it?
She did it.
She’s lying.

In a moment, what I’m going to do is I’m going to count to 5. On 
number 5, I will say wide awake. At that time, you will be wide 
awake, feeling fantastic in every way. All the suggestions will now be 
removed. 
So what I’m going to do now is just formal transformation to show you what 
that’s like. Okay? Here we go. 
I’m going to count from 1-5. On number 5, you will be wide awake 
and feeling fantastic in every single way. Before I do though, I want 
you to go inside your body and I want you to find one thing that you’d 
want to change in your lives more than anything. Maybe you want 
more confidence, more success whatever that is, find that right now. 
When you have that in your mind, nod your head. Do it quickly. Very 
cool.
I want you to take that thought, and I want you to breathe into it. Give 
it energy, give it life, send it into the future and attach a powerful 
emotion to it. 
We’re anchoring into a beautiful state now. All right. I like to do that at the 
end of the show. I want them to feel good about it, feel that with you.
In a moment, I’m going to count from 1-5. On number 5, open your 
eyes, feeling fantastic in every way, accepting one more powerful 
round of applause from the audience because you guys were the 
stars of the show. When you hear this round of applause, it will 
cement in your mind this idea that you want for yourself. Get ready 
now. On number 5, open your eyes, feeling fantastic in every single 
way.
You will keep that one suggestion I gave you however. Here we go. 
1-2-3-4-5, wide awake, you guys. 
Applause
All right. Thank you. Liking me now? Correct age. Correct age, wide 
awake? Correct age. Okay.
You’re not asking that, right?
No, I’m not. I’m telling you your correct age. I’m not asking that? I saw you 
pull her hair. Come on over here, my friend. Thank you for coming up here. 
Give them all a round of applause.

Q&A Session
Spencer:
Student:
Spencer:
Student:
Spencer:
Students:
Spencer:
Student:
Spencer:
Student:
Okay, so do you guys have a general idea of how that works, right? So now 
you’ve got something going on in your mind. Do you have a question? You 
better stand up. Take this. And what is it very quickly. We’re running out of 
time.
I noticed when you say sleep, and everyone is in a trance, they really kind 
of fall down and really slouch, instead of just going and sitting like that. If 
they do kind of just fall around and you kind of position them so they’re lying 
down, is that so the audience thinks that they’re really kind of asleep, or so 
that they are asleep, or is it better to have them in a really sleeping, 
slouching position than just kind of sitting like this?
It doesn’t really matter. It’s your show. All it is for me is just about 
showmanship, and it looks fun. I could take people and drop them over like 
this or I can put them this way, or I can put them upside down on their head, 
or I can throw them on the floor. It just depends on what the feel of your 
show is at the moment. That was just something I’m doing here, playing 
around. 
Maybe during the real show, I’ll just keep everybody in their chairs. So 
much is dependent upon your subjects. You may walk into a room to do a 
show, have everything in your mind exactly how you want it, but you’re 
going to have subjects that are going to test and try everything you know 
about stage hypnosis. You may have to shift everything you’re doing on a 
dime. 
When the girls started fighting or kicking around, maybe it got out of control, 
what would you do to calm that down?
Oh I don’t know. I just let it go on for a while. The reason I do that is 
because the audience, tell me, did you guys think that was pretty cool to 
watch them just get goofy. 
Yeah.
Because I’m trying to do a show so it looks like they’re out of control. Listen, 
they think they’re 6 years old, so let them play like little kids. I’ve got a 6-
year-old. He gets goofy sometimes. I don’t care. Just be goofy.
Yeah, but what it started getting a little too physical, pulling hair…
Oh, I’ve had that happen.
Really?

You just let them go?
No, I don’t let them go. I might just go, sleep!
Yeah, stop it.
Then I’ll say, now listen very carefully. No pulling hair. 
Right. 
Wide awake, children. So you just handle the situation that way because 
you don’t want anybody to get hurt, the volunteers, they’re back there 
having a cat fight. Any other questions?

You guys are ready for an early night, aren’t you?
Yes.
Okay. Well, this has been a good day. You have a lot of information to think 
about. We’re going to send you off here soon. But I want you to think of 
everything that you’ve learned today with what we’ve presented to you, and 
let that roll around in your mind. As it rolls around in your mind, it’s going to 
be very powerful. You’ll have the dreams again, and if you haven’t had 
them, they’re going to happen.
And when you close your eyes and think about it, how good it feels…
Once again…
To finally end the day.
Moving.
And everything continues to flow.
Just calm.
Easily.
And just pause with your eyes closed.
All the way.
And drift deeper.
That’s right. Enjoy that feeling. That’s right. Enjoy that feeling.
That’s right. 
Deeper. That’s good.
The more you drift…
The more you let go.
The better you feel.
That’s right.

Continue to expand…
That’s right.
Oh yeah.
That’s right.
It’s unbelievable, isn’t it?
So whenever you’re ready to accept these ideas, to become a firm deep-
lasting impression on your subconscious mind, then your eyes will open up, 
and they’ll open up at that moment when you’ve accepted these ideas and 
you know that they have been instilled deep inside of yourself. At that 
moment, you can come all the way back. 
Whew. Is it me, or is it hot in here? Are all the eyes almost open? So how 
are you guys doing? Want to try that again? How are you guys doing?
Applause
All right, guys I think you deserve a slightly early break today. Have a great 
night. Those of you who want to go and do some street hypnosis well, you 
can let us know about it tomorrow. Off you go.
