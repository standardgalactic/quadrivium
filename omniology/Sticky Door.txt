Sticky Door

Q: My back door is difficult to open and close because it's sticking. Can I 
repair it? 
A: (from Brad Staggs, Ask DIY Home Improvement expert) There are a 
couple of easy, quick fixes that may be helpful in dealing with a sticky 
door. 
Materials (may include): 
Cordless drill and screwdriver attachment
Utility knife
Wood or cardboard shim
Wood toothpick
Suggestions:
G     The first thing to check is the strike plate mounted in the door 
frame. The strike plate is part of the door-latch mechanism. 
Sometimes the screws holding the strike plate in place can work 
themselves partially loose (figure A). If the screws are loose, they 
may be interfering with smooth operation of the door, or they may 
be allowing the strike plate to become misaligned and interfere with 
the door closing. If the screws are loose, tighten them and then 
check the door to see if the situation improves.
G     A related problem may arise if the strike plate is not mortised far 
enough into the doorframe -- causing the door to stick. You may 
want to remove the strike plate and inspect the mortise (or recess) 
in which the frame (figure B).

G     If necessary, use a utility knife to trim out around the edge of the 
mortise (figure C) so that the strike plate can sit further back into 
the frame.
G     Once you've trimmed out enough wood, reinstall the strike plate 
(figure D) and check the door's operation.
G     A separate problem may arise if the hinges aren't seated or 
functioning properly, causing the door to hanging improperly. 
Check the gaps around the perimeter of the door. Around the top of 
the door, the gap should be about 1/16-inch. Along the bottom, the 
gap should be about 1/4-inch, or slightly more if it has to clear 
carpeting when it opens. Along the lock side, the gap should be 
about 1/8-inch all the way down the length of the door. If the gap 
is uneven at the top or bottom, the door may be tilted slightly in 
the frame because of a hinge that is loose or not mounted properly. 
You may simply need to tighten the screws holding the hinges in 
place to correct a minor problem.
G     If tightening the screws doesn't provide enough adjustment, you 
may need to remove the hinge entirely, and place a thin wood-shim 
spacer (figure E) behind it. A shim can be made from a piece of a 
paint-stir stick, cut to the proper size. For a less severe problem, a 
cardboard spacer may be sufficient.
G     After the shim is in place, reinstall the hinge -- screwing the wood screws right through the shim 
and into the existing holes (figure F).
G     By using shims to adjust the way that the door hangs, you may be able to realign the door so that 
the gaps are even (figure G) and the door no longer sticks.

Tip: If the wood screws holding a hinge or strike plate in place have become stripped, you can tighten 
the screw's grip by inserting a wood toothpick in the screw hole before reinstalling the screw (figure H). 
Break the toothpick off so that there is none extending outside the hole. The extra sliver of wood in the 
hole will help tighten the screw's hold on the wood.
