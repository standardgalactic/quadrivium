We dedicate Mastering Autodesk Revit 2018 to our 
wives and families, who have supported the pursuit 
of our careers and the authoring of this book. Their 
encouragement, understanding, and ﬂexibility 
to personal time is what made this body of work 
possible. 
—Lance, Eddy, Marcus

Acknowledgments
Ah, acknowledgments. Although all the glory of writing a book is mostly consumed by the 
authors, it takes so many more people than just us to actually make this happen. Just like build-
ing design, the process of writing and publishing a book is truly a team sport—and without 
the hard work, dedication, and willingness to put up with the authoring team, this book would 
never have happened.
Of all the people to thank, ﬁrst we’d like to thank the staff at the Revit Factory. Without their 
ﬁne work, this would be a very empty book. A special thanks to the three product managers, 
Harlan Brumm, Sasha Crotty, and Steven Campbell. And a huge thank-you to the rest of the 
Factory: thank you, guys and gals, for your hard work, innovative ideas, and desire to stay in 
touch with current design and construction issues.
Also, a big thanks to our technical team. They dot our i’s, cross our t’s, and chide us every 
time we turn in something late. Their work and effort ensure that we as authors can produce 
something that you the reader can actually follow. So a thank-you to our amazing and patient 
developmental editor, Kelly Talbot, for putting up with our excuses and typos; to copyeditor 
Kim Wimpsett and proofreader Rebecca Rider for taking our slang and making it readable; 
and to production editor Dassi Zeidel for putting all the pieces together and getting it ready for 
print. Thanks also to Mary Beth Wakeﬁeld for watching the schedule and allowing us to use  
her as an excuse not to visit family on weekends or holidays during “Book Season.” A thank-
you to Alexandra Bergin, technical editor, who has given a careful and detailed eye to all of our 
Revit workﬂows, and to our excellent support team at Sybex, who helped us develop all this 
foxy content.
The building photograph on the cover was designed by Antunovich Associates, headquar-
tered in Chicago, Illinois.
Verde Pointe is a recently completed residential and retail mixed-use development located 
along Lee Highway in Arlington, Virginia. The project continues a long-standing collaboration 
between Antunovich Associates and developer McCaffery Interests to deliver distinguished 
mixed-use projects across the nation. The uniquely designed development achieved LEED Gold 
certiﬁcation and features two distinct portions with mixed-use residential, retail, and park-
ing on the west side of Uhle Street and a 12-ﬂoor contemporary residential tower on the east. 
Common spaces play a central role at Verde Pointe, and the sustainability-driven design encour-
ages environmentally friendly modes of transportation. A penthouse level in the residential 
tower with spectacular views of the greater Washington, DC, area also houses comprehensive 
tenant amenity spaces. These amenities, along with on-site retail opportunities, contribute to a 
ﬁrst-class experience for residents and exemplify destination-type developments envisioned by 
McCaffery Interests.
Many thanks as well to photographer Dana Bowden for taking and sharing compelling pic-
tures of this and other projects.

About the Authors
Lance Kirby is a senior business consultant with Autodesk. Lance’s pri-
mary focus is accelerating the adoption of BIM and VDC practices among 
owners and their supply chain of designers and contractors. He received 
his bachelor’s degree in architecture from Mississippi State University’s 
College of Architecture, Art, and Design and also studied at the Budapest 
University of Technology and Economics, coincidentally alongside the 
creators of Graphisoft’s ARCHICAD. He spent six years in various architec-
ture ofﬁces helping to produce everything from 400-square-foot fast-food 
kiosks in shopping malls to 7,000,000-square-foot federal prisons.
In 2000, he left a prominent architecture ﬁrm to join a new tech startup 
outside Boston to help produce a new design tool called Revit. In addition 
to helping develop Revit since version 1, Lance created its early tutorials and has supported hun-
dreds of BIM projects and trained thousands of its users over the past 15 years. Coincidentally, 
he has also supported all the previous and current authors of this book at some point in his 
career. Although this is his ﬁrst published book as an author, he routinely pens thousands of 
pages of customer reports a year.
Although Lance has been based in Atlanta since 1995, he is often out of town. When he is not 
traveling globally in support of Autodesk customers, he may be traveling globally with his ﬂight 
attendant wife, Scarlett. He enjoys ﬁction, analog/digital gaming, gastronomy of the smoked-
meat variety, and heavy down-tuned music.
Eddy Krygiel is a principal business consultant with the AEC team with 
Autodesk Consulting. Eddy focuses on BIM and technology workﬂows 
for AEC clients. He received his bachelor’s degree in architecture from the 
University of Kansas School of Architecture and Urban Design. He has 
almost 20 years of experience in architectural ofﬁces and on a range of 
projects from single-family residential to ofﬁce, federal, civic, and aviation 
clients. Eddy has helped ﬁrms around the United States at both the ﬁrm 
level and the project level.
Eddy is the author of more than 18 books on BIM and sustainability 
including the Mastering Revit series and Green BIM. He has also taught 
BIM, construction documents, and architectural communication at the University of Kansas 
School of Architecture.

Marcus Kim is a senior business consultant with Autodesk. Marcus 
focuses on enterprise adoption of Revit and BIM workﬂows for AEC 
customers and has traveled all over the globe providing BIM services to 
domestic and multinational customers. Marcus received his bachelor’s 
degree in architecture studies from the University of Illinois in Chicago 
and his associate of arts and sciences degree from the American 
Academy of Art in digital media. During the early part of his career, 
Marcus pursued design and technical architecture, but he was given the 
opportunity to participate in a Revit pilot program where he excelled. 
Throughout his career, until his transition to Autodesk, Marcus man-
aged the BIM on complex and high-proﬁle projects such as the NATO 
World Headquarters for SOM Chicago, developing and implementing workﬂows during a time 
when producing BIM projects and BIM management was in its infancy. Marcus has used Revit 
since version 7.0 and has lectured at Autodesk University on topics such as BIM management, 
BIM architecture workﬂows on large-scale projects, and design visualization.
At Autodesk, Marcus provides both technical and business process thought leadership to his 
customers, helping them adopt and improve new and existing BIM workﬂows, training, content, 
and standards. He has taken BIM concepts common to AEC and applied them to other indus-
tries ranging from manufacturing to energy to mining.
Marcus is based out of the Chicagoland area and spends much of his spare time chasing after 
his toddler and sneaking in moments of relaxation by pursuing his other two passions, digital 
art and painting little toy soldiers.

Foreword
“It’s time for a revolution” proclaimed the Revit release 1 video as Revit burst on to the scene 
to music that drowned out the competition on the 2000 AIA Convention ﬂoor. How time ﬂies. 
Seventeen years later, Revit remains revolutionary. Not only is adoption of Revit and building 
information modeling (BIM) growing at a breakneck pace around the globe, but the beneﬁts of a 
BIM-centric design and construction have set new efﬁciency expectations that have become the 
standard in architecture, engineering, and construction.
This year, we celebrate 15 years since the acquisition of Revit by Autodesk. Given the timing, 
we want to take a moment to reﬂect on how far Revit has come since those early trailblazing 
days. These screenshots show how Revit 6.0 (left) and Revit 2018 (right) look different but retain 
the same character:
 
Here are just a few of the powerful tools that didn’t exist in those ﬁrst Revit versions:
 
◆
MEP and Structure functionality
 
◆
Advanced conceptual modeling
 
◆
Point clouds
 
◆
Cloud rendering
 
◆
Energy analysis
 
◆
Structural analysis
 
◆
Steel detailing
 
◆
MEP fabrication
 
◆
Cloud collaboration
 
◆
Visual scripting with Dynamo

Not only have the features grown, but so has the size of the projects modeled in Revit. The 
Revit announcement video showcased a small two- or three-room house. Revit projects today 
run the gamut from managing 34-million-square-foot university campuses to building 450 
million-dollar hospitals and 40,000-seat stadiums. With bigger projects came increasingly fast 
hardware and the ability to truly model the entire building. Even the system requirements 
reﬂect how far Revit has come. Revit 3.0 required only 128 MB of RAM and 100 MB of free disk 
space. Today, Revit takes advantage of multiple 64-bit CPU cores and as much memory as you 
can throw at it so that you can work on the biggest and most complex projects.
One addition that has fundamentally changed Revit is the application programming inter-
face (API). It has enabled the creation of thousands of plug-ins to customize and automate Revit, 
and many of the tools we have built for Revit wouldn’t be possible without it. We see new tools 
created every week—tools to increase productivity, to better manage models, and to create 
stunning client presentations. This thriving ecosystem means that Revit is not limited by what 
Autodesk can build; it can be customized to suit your needs.
Alongside improvements in software and hardware, how we develop and make Revit has 
changed as well. We’ve adopted Scrum and Agile development to better address customer 
needs while focusing on providing the best quality product. We’ve moved ofﬁces a few times 
and grown to have great teams across the globe.
Even our tools have gotten an upgrade or two, as you can see in the following Revit 6.0 (left) 
and Revit 2018 (right) screenshots:
 
Through all of these changes, Revit continues to deliver on the promise of consistent, coordi-
nated, and complete models and documentation for all disciplines. This promise is at the core of 
our values. Revit is made for architects by architects and for engineers by engineers.
You, Reviteers, are doing amazing things with Revit and with all of Autodesk’s tools. You 
are making the world a better place and building amazing things. We’ve seen parametric cows 
and the world’s tallest buildings all take shape within Revit. If you ever want to be amazed by 
the capabilities of Revit gurus around the world, attend a BILT (previously RTC) conference. 
The caliber of the presenters and their presentations never ceases to amaze us. We are inﬁnitely 
proud of the Revit community. Who could have imagined in 2000 that Revit would be at the 
heart of four conferences each year and thousands of blog and forum posts?

FOREWORD | XXIX
Yet, the Revit team is not even close to done. This year, we embarked on a new way for you 
to share your voice with us to help us make Revit the best it can be. We launched our Revit ideas 
site and our ﬁrst public road map to share with you the direction we are going and how we are 
going to get there. We continue to strive to give architects and engineers the power and ﬂexibility 
to design the way you want to design and to remove barriers to creativity. We want architects to 
focus on the things you care about and, at the same time, ensure that you are working in a collab-
orative way with everyone on the project. We believe that the success of the building industry lies 
in breaking barriers between disciplines and working in closer collaboration. Revit has helped to 
drive radical changes in building design, but there is so much more that we can do together.
We are so excited that you are about to join us on this journey. The future of architecture is in 
your hands. Welcome to the revolution.

Introduction 
What you hold in your hands is regarded as the deﬁnitive source of Autodesk Revit expertise 
available in written form. It has been a leading book in educating novice and experienced users 
alike for the better part of a decade. Those of you who have read previous editions know there is 
a wealth of information regarding the practical usage and application of the program in produc-
ing many different architectural designs. If you have used these preceding editions to help you 
gain a better understanding of this complex application, then you know that new information 
is provided in each edition to update you on the newest features and how they might improve 
your workﬂow every day. What you may not know is that this speciﬁc edition seeks to go fur-
ther. Its purpose is to provide you with not only the best understanding of the available tools 
but also many of the skills sorely needed by professionals to manage these tools in an architec-
tural building information modeling (BIM) workﬂow.
Often when working with architects around the world, we ﬁnd that the terms Revit and 
BIM are used interchangeably in describing what is new about the profession and the way we 
execute work. From the typical user all the way to the principal members of a ﬁrm, there is a 
misconception that if you’re using Revit, you are doing BIM. The challenge, of course, is separat-
ing the tool from the technique. Although Autodesk Revit is a wonderful apparatus for joining 
three-dimensional geometry with incredibly powerful and accurate data, it’s not a process or a 
road map for producing architectural work. Although Revit is an important foundational asset 
to a BIM-based workﬂow, it is still a resource that needs associated procedures and the intent for 
reaching planned deliverables. Where is technology without technique?
BIM is a methodology used to produce a complete design, construction, and operations  
solution. It has become a catalyst for transforming design and production processes in the  
architecture, engineering, and construction industry. More than a decade ago in 2005, BIM  
was represented solely as architectural design and documentation authoring tools. By 2016,  
BIM has grown to form the basis of the process from design discipline authorship to construc-
tion and operation management of built assets. It is also being adopted for infrastructure as  
well as buildings. As the use of BIM tools and processes has become more mature, nations  
have changed legislation to accommodate the immediacy of centralized collaborative working 
practices in contrast with traditional sequential paper workﬂows. Global organizations within 
speciﬁc industries have deﬁned exchange classiﬁcations such as Industry Foundation Classes (IFC)  
and COBie, and owners and their customers now expect to see full 3D media to describe a 
building at any stage of the design and build process. They even expect to see it as part of the 
construction process on-site, controlling and validating the build environment.
The challenge for any company in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) 
industry is to recognize the BIM areas that match its business niche and to ensure that the 

XXXII | INTRODUCTION
information that it attributes to a model can be generated efﬁciently and maximized by all other 
information-model users. With this comes much more responsibility to users of the tools and 
managers of the information, beyond lines and arcs generated by zeros and ones. It entails that 
you work with intent beyond what you see displayed on monitors. It is not enough to know 
every button and setting contained in the program; the BIM practitioner must know why to use 
a feature and when it is appropriate. It is not enough to know how to customize the templates 
for your speciﬁc workﬂow; it involves user understanding, knowing when customization is 
needed to create a speciﬁc output, and when settings are best left unchanged. It is not enough to 
know how to create iterative forms through the manipulation of Python coding; it also requires 
an understanding of design criteria and how BIM uses align with them. Most important, it is not 
enough to just have the knowledge of how to model a thing; it is necessary to have the wisdom 
to know when and why to do so.
Rest assured, this book’s purpose is to educate you on the best techniques and practices of 
Autodesk Revit, regardless of your responsibilities as an architectural project team member. 
New users will ﬁnd a plethora of information regarding everything from simple concepts to 
complex techniques in executing modeling, documentation, and data input/output. All the 
while, we have included some lesser-known tips and tricks for seasoned veterans. All readers, 
regardless of their experience, will beneﬁt from the authors’ knowledge in planning, collaborat-
ing, governing, and supporting BIM projects with Revit at the center. The goal is not to turn all 
readers into BIM managers but to extend the amazing information provided in previous vol-
umes with additional recommendations for supporting your work for more efﬁciency and better 
quality.
Anyone involved in any aspect of BIM, even tangentially, can beneﬁt from knowledge of the 
bigger picture. This edition’s coverage of the collaboration process, the management of practices, 
and the governance of data standards has been expanded so that even novices can increase 
their value to the team. By understanding principles that show that every action should have a 
method and every method should have a purpose, readers will continue to progress their exper-
tise in providing precise modeling and valid data to their teams at the right time and in the 
right format.
If you seek a greater understanding of the BIM process and strive to transcend your 
traditional responsibilities, this edition will help you toward the goal of BIM manage-
ment. Pursuing knowledge of planning, organizing, leading, and controlling your projects 
through new techniques and tools will help you take those next steps. By planning, you will 
establish strategies for achieving BIM use objectives. By organizing, you will be structur-
ing the workﬂow to maximize the collaborative integration of your team. By leading, you 
will optimize your project team’s potential for providing quality deliverables efﬁciently. By 
controlling, you will be able to measure the team’s performance and provide continual self-
improvement with the goal of raising the level of excellence. Regardless of your role, you 
will contribute more.
As you begin delving into this book, keep an active mind about how each of the provided 
recommendations might ﬁt your company’s culture, your experience, and your customer’s 
needs. Not all of these ideas may be of interest or value to every project, but the goal of this book 
is that you will grow beyond any of the tools or techniques you deploy on your BIM projects, 
that the tools become second nature and an extension of your creativity, and that through this 
you will realize great architecture.
Architecture is the process of turning a thought into a space. Although it’s so simple to con-
vey that in the written word, the actual act of doing so is much more than it is possible to write. 

INTRODUCTION | XXXIII
It’s glory, it’s torment, it’s frustration, it’s freedom, it’s the realization that one miscalculation 
means a complete redesign, and it’s the 3 a.m. epiphany when you realize that the new design 
was what you were meant to get to in the ﬁrst place. With all of that, it’s also the burning desire 
to work relentlessly to make something better one step at a time.
Autodesk® Revit® 2018 software is one of the many tools we employ to help us through 
this organic process. It’s one tool in the toolbox, but it can be much more than that. It can be 
the workﬂow that helps to empower a team. That team is the designers, the contractors, and 
 ultimately the owners who are all looking to speak the same language.
We hope that in the process of using this book, you’ll experience a bit of the struggle to 
realize a bit of the satisfaction of ﬁnding the solution. We hope what you learn in this book 
helps inspire you to your own bit of greatness because what’s most important is that architec-
ture isn’t about buildings. It’s about what we are able to accomplish with what little time we 
have. This is the elegant essence of Revit. Before we go much further, we have a few semantics 
to discuss.
First, all the tutorial ﬁles necessary to complete the book’s exercises plus sample families are 
hosted online at www.sybex.com/go/masteringrevit2018.
Don’t have a copy of Revit 2018? Download the trial version of Revit at http://usa 
.autodesk.com/revit, where you’ll also ﬁnd complete system requirements for running Revit. 
Are you a student or educator? Someone with an .edu e-mail address? You can get a copy of 
Revit for free at http://students.autodesk.com.
For the clearest direction when following the exercises in this book, please make sure to 
install all the Revit support ﬁles that come with the default installation. We reference them 
heavily, and you’ll need them to best leverage the software.
Beginning with Revit 2018, there is only a single version of Revit that offers the Architecture, 
Structures, and MEP packages in one application. We have focused this book on the architec-
tural features and have set the user interface to remove some of the Structural and MEP tools for 
better visual clarity. The variations will be slight and ideally manageable, which really means 
you have some extra tools for Structure and MEP design. For the ease of reading, we removed 
those from the book’s images.
Finally, Revit comes with some additional options that you can download and install sepa-
rately, including access to cloud rendering, storage, and analysis. We cover these tools through-
out the book. You can go to http://accounts.autodesk.com to create an Autodesk® A360 
account to access those additional tools.
Who Should Read Tis Book
This book is written for architects and designers who have had some exposure to Revit and are 
eager to learn more. It’s for architects of any generation—you don’t need to be a computer wiz-
ard to understand or appreciate the content within. We designed the book to follow real project 
workﬂows and processes to help make the tools easier to use. The chapters are full of handy tips 
to make Revit easier to leverage in your day-to-day world.
This book is also for the entire range of architects, from those who are fresh out of school 
to seasoned project managers. We have endeavored to include content for all walks of the 
profession so that regardless of your role on a project, you can learn how BIM changes both 
workﬂow and culture within a project team. With that, a basic understanding of Revit will 
make it easier to work through the book. Revit is a robust tool requiring more than one project 
iteration to master.

XXXIV | INTRODUCTION
For BIM managers, the book offers insights into the best practices for creating good project 
or ofﬁce templates; these managers should also take a sneak peek into the powerful world of 
building content and Revit families. We’ve added many time-saving and inspiring concepts to 
the book, supported by examples from our own projects and the rest of the real world, to help 
motivate and inspire you on your journey through building information modeling.
What You Will Learn
This book will help you take the basics of Revit and BIM that you already know and expand on 
them using real-world examples. We will show you how to take a preliminary model and add 
layers of intelligence to help analyze and augment your designs. We’ll show you how to create 
robust and accurate documentation, and then we’ll help you through the construction process.
We go beyond introductory topics. To that end, we won’t be starting a project from scratch 
or teaching you the basics of how to build a simple BIM model. If you are interested in learning 
at that level or are brand new to Revit, we strongly recommend you pick up Autodesk® Revit® 
Architecture 2016 Essentials (Wiley, 2015) before plunging headlong into this book. Instead, this 
book begins with a brief overview of the BIM approach. As you are already aware, BIM is more 
than just a change in software; it’s a change in architectural workﬂow and culture. To leverage 
the full advantages of both BIM and Revit in your ofﬁce structure, you will need to make some 
changes to your practice. We’ve designed the book around an ideal, integrated workﬂow to help 
you make this transition.
Starting with the project team, standards, and culture, we’ll discuss how BIM changes your 
project approach and how to best build your team around a newer workﬂow. From there, we’ll 
delve into conceptual design and sustainability studies, continuing through best practices for 
design iteration and reﬁnement. You’ll learn how to use powerful modeling techniques, how  
to design documentation best practices, how to make compelling presentation graphics, and 
how to take advantage of parametric design with the Family Editor. We’ll explore workﬂow  
topics such as tracking changes and worksharing as well as some strategies that move beyond 
traditional concepts of BIM. The book includes an appendix on troubleshooting and best  
practices so you can avoid common pitfalls. Throughout the book we’ve shared our practical 
experience with you, particularly in the form of real-world scenario.
Whether you’re studying Revit on your own or in a class or training program, you can use 
the “Master It” questions in the section called “The Bottom Line” at the end of each chapter to 
test your mastery of the skills you’ve learned.

What’s New?
The Autodesk Revit team works continuously to improve the software, add new features, and 
eliminate bugs. It’s a constant evolution. Here’s a list of the items that have been added or 
enhanced in the 2018 release:
Cloud Technologies  Revit has made several changes to how it integrates with cloud tech-
nologies. This includes updates to Collaboration for Revit® (C4R), A360, where documents 
and models are shared online, and how Revit works with conceptual design applications 
such as Dynamo and Autodesk® FormIt®.
Interoperability  Revit now allows more versatility when working with other applications. 
FormIt ﬁles and Navisworks® ﬁles are now accessible to import or link into a Revit model. 
Additionally, there is better compatibility between Revit and Autodesk® Civil 3D® so site 
models now have the option to geolocate. Additionally, FormIt and Revit now use the same 
material library so textures and materials will move seamlessly between applications.
Stairs and Railings  Revit now allows for multistory stairs, even if the ﬂoor to ﬂoor heights 
change between ﬂoors. Railings are now able to be mapped to terrain so they will follow 
changes to the topography.
Annotations  Changes have been made to how you can annotate your drawings in Revit. It 
is now possible to use complex characters (e.g., using the diameter symbol: ∅). Bulleting and 
numbering text has also been updated.
UI Changes  The Revit team has updated the UI to give it a more modernized interface. The 
ribbon is still being used, but it takes up less screen real estate and has a more modern look 
and feel.
What to Expect
Mastering Autodesk Revit 2018 is divided into several parts, each representing a milestone in your 
progress toward becoming an expert Revit user. Here is a description of those parts and what 
they will show you.

XXXVI | INTRODUCTION
Part 1: Fundamentals
This book is not intended for novices, but we recognize that not everyone will know how to ﬁnd 
every tool or have a complete understanding of the workﬂow. The chapters in Part 1 help you 
build a foundation of essential tools and knowledge.
Chapter 1, “Understanding the Principles of BIM,” covers principles in building information 
modeling within your ofﬁce or project environment.
Chapter 2, “Exploring the UI and Organizing Projects,” details the Revit interface and gen-
eral organization.
Chapter 3, “The Basics of the Toolbox,” explores the commands and tools within Revit. It 
gives you an overview of where to ﬁnd them and leaves the deep dive into their use for the 
chapters ahead.
Chapter 4, “Conﬁguring Templates and Standards,” discusses the tools you’ll need to 
develop and manage graphic standards in a project template.
Part 2: Collaboration and Teamwork
Part 2 sets you on the path toward using Revit on a team or throughout your ﬁrm and takes a 
deep dive into a successful BIM workﬂow.
Chapter 5, “Collaborating with a Team,” discusses the critical tools to working with Revit on 
any project team.
Chapter 6, “Working with Consultants,” covers the basics of working with team members 
outside your ofﬁce.
Chapter 7, “Interoperability: Working Multiplatform,” details the tools you’ll need to share 
your Revit ﬁles with other team members who don’t use Revit as a design tool.
Chapter 8, “Managing Revit Projects,” covers how to manage the Revit model to keep the ﬁle 
running smoothly and efﬁciently.
Part 3: Modeling and Massing for Design
In this part, you’ll delve into the use of Revit starting from the early stages of design through 
analysis, iteration, and visualization.
Chapter 9, “Advanced Modeling and Massing,” details the creating of forms and shapes with 
the conceptual Revit toolkit.
Chapter 10, “Conceptual Design,” gives you an overview of conceptual design tools includ-
ing Dynamo and FormIt.
Chapter 11, “Working with Phasing, Groups, and Design Options,” takes the next step after 
the initial design and analysis: iteration.

ate stunning renderings and imagery of your design.

INTRODUCTION | XXXVII
Part 4: Extended Modeling Techniques
Part 4 takes the conceptual forms you create in Part 3 and expands them to the real world using 
walls, ﬂoors, roofs, and other building components to create the elements behind a building.
Chapter 13, “Creating Walls and Curtain Walls,” delves into the use of the Wall and Curtain 
Wall tools.
Chapter 14, “Modeling Floors, Ceilings, and Roofs,” demonstrates a variety of ways to work 
with the horizontal components of a building: ﬂoors, ceilings, and roofs.

families to create a host of content for the building design.
Chapter 16, “Creating Stairs and Railings,” demonstrates a variety of ways and techniques to 
use the Stair and Railing tools—for their intended purpose and for others.
Part 5: Documentation
Once the building is designed, it becomes necessary to create the views and documents needed 
to build the project. This section shows you how to detail, document, and annotate the design.
Chapter 17, “Detailing Your Design,” works with the building design you created in previous 
chapters to add 2D components for documentation.
Chapter 18, “Documenting Your Design,” works with the newly created views and helps you 
organize them on sheets.
Chapter 19, “Annotating Your Design,” takes the next step in the documentation process and 
works with keynoting and dimensioning.
Part 6: Construction and Beyond
This section focuses on what to do once the design is resolved, taking it into the construction 
process and working with presentation tools.
Chapter 20, “Working in the Construction Phase,” focuses on the tools Revit has to keep track 
of changes during construction.
Chapter 21, “Presenting Your Design,” shows you how to take the completed design and dis-
play the results in a variety of 2D and 3D methods.
Chapter 22, “Design Analysis,” teaches you how to use new tools that analyze the energy 
consumption of your proposed design and help optimize the building’s energy footprint.
Part 7: Appendixes
Finally, three appendixes supplement the chapters’ coverage of Revit software features.
Appendix A, “The Bottom Line,” offers solutions to the “Master It” questions in each chap-
ter’s “Bottom Line” section.

 T e Fundamentals of a BIM Approach 
 Building information modeling is an integrated model-centric methodology that delivers 
validated and coordinated knowledge about a building project throughout planning, design, 
construction, and operation. When this collaborative, interdisciplinary approach is optimized, 
it can improve an organization’s operations. BIM provides designers, contractors, and owners 
with a process to improve decision-making, quality, and timeliness. At the core of this BIM 
approach are model-centric workﬂ ows (geometric and data models) that support project execu-
tion and asset lifecycle management. These workﬂ ows determine the methodology for creating 
data-rich geometries, integrated deliverables, and a model-based process to develop projects 
from planning through the operation and management lifecycle phases. BIM can be deﬁ ned 
through technology, processes (its governance through standardization), and people. The tech-
nology system is central to the processes of creating, storing, and using models. With processes, 
the success of BIM requires all stakeholders in the project ecosystem to follow a series of steps, 
both as individuals and as a team. Ultimately, the users of these techniques and technologies 
are committed to improving their design process by successfully integrating both geometry 
and data. 
 To succeed with these practices in this environment, a business must make fundamental 
changes in the way it operates, whether by moving into a new market or by changing its meth-
ods of operation. It requires an alignment of the organization’s activities relating to its people,

processes, and technology with its business strategy and vision. Through collaboration and data 
management during an asset’s lifecycle, sharing information efﬁciently and effectively can sup-
port better integration and interoperability among all project stakeholders. Along with this data 
comes the possibility of integrated analysis. By making these analyses easily accessible, deriva-
tives of this model-centric workﬂow can provide a better understanding of design opportunities 
and decisions’ consequences. With the availability of valid geometry-based data, 2D, 3D (visual-
ization, clash detection), 4D (time), 5D (cost), and beyond are possible. Taking advantage of these 
capabilities is a must in keeping architecture ﬁrms relevant in today’s market. Transforming your 
organization’s business quickly and efﬁciently will be the difference between maintaining  
your market share and taking that next evolutionary step forward.
Te Management People Inside a BIM Project Team
The architectural marketplace is changing and is inﬂuencing stafﬁng decisions as skills needed 
for BIM projects can be different than traditional CAD skill sets. Some of your organization’s 
leadership may be aware of this change and are organizing BIM teams and resources to better 
anticipate new processes. Others are unsure of how BIM may change how they plan projects, 
from stafﬁng to hiring. When looking to acquire BIM-skilled staff, savvy ﬁrms look for process 
experience in their new hires and no longer solely focus on hiring those with tool expertise. The 
primary factor is always professional experience, but knowledge of a BIM workﬂow supports 
these professional skills very well.
When planning project stafﬁng, architecture ﬁrms generally focus on deliverables produced 
by a project hierarchy of managers, designers, engineers, interns, and draftspeople. BIM roles 
and responsibilities are based on the availability within the project team, rather than compos-
ing the best ﬁt based on model-based workﬂows. This does not constitute a project problem as 
much as it decreases efﬁciency in two ways.
 
◆
Roles/responsibilities are not clearly deﬁned, and team members must adjust to BIM 
project needs during the project. Managers, who are making stafﬁng decisions, may not 
have the resources to judge BIM experience level or tool/process skill sets, other than 
hearsay or previous project experience with similar circumstances.
 
◆
BIM managers have a better understanding of these capabilities but do not generally make 
stafﬁng decisions for projects. There may be project managers who know to confer with 
BIM managers over this need at project start-up; however, this is uncommon.
Typically, professionals are hired based on project experience, education, and certiﬁcations. 
Historically for architecture ﬁrms, BIM experience was considered as nice to have but not 
required. In today’s market as BIM and BIM skills have become commoditized, an increasing 
number of professionals have BIM experience on their résumés in the form of project experience 
and trained tools, as BIM skill sets are being required more frequently. Not having these skill 
sets does not preclude new staff from being successful BIM project team members, but it does 
impede the ability of managers with BIM experience to staff projects appropriately and hinders 
their ability to develop a plan in accordance with project requirements.
Regardless, whether you are making stafﬁng decisions or are a hardworking BIM project 
team member, understanding how these workﬂows are changing the planning and execution of 
projects is important. Being prepared by understanding the people, processes, and technology 
of BIM is a must.

THE MANAGEMENT PEOPLE INSIDE A BIM PROJECT TEAM | 5
Staﬃng for BIM
As the building industry’s process of design and documentation is transforming, one of the 
fundamental changes teams need to address is staff planning in a BIM process. A common mis-
conception of project management is that stafﬁng the BIM project will be the same as it has been 
in CAD workﬂows. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Because a BIM-based project can signiﬁ-
cantly alter the project workﬂow, which now includes BIM-focused goals that are beyond simple 
documentation, many of the standard timetables for task completion are no longer valid. (See 
Chapter 8, “Managing Revit Projects,” for further details.) Although fundamental deliverables 
remain the same (drawings, schedules, etc.), the processes to reach these outputs are different. 
For example, in a CAD workﬂow a user can create a plan as a single one-off entity. In a BIM 
workﬂow, the same user must develop a model before a ﬂoor plan can be produced. The invest-
ment in the 3D model requires more time upfront, and therefore the ﬂoor plan to be produced 
necessitates a longer schedule. However, once this model has been produced, many other deriv-
atives can be produced with less effort. As a model is developed, the ability to generate accurate 
and precise drawings, schedules, and analysis is made expedient because it is derived from the 
developed model. To leverage this workﬂow, the staff and processes must take into account the 
gathering of momentum early in the cadence of execution to accommodate all phases.
Years ago, Patrick MacLeamy, who was then CEO of Hellmuth, Obata, + Kassabaum, 
explained this workﬂow movement with a diagrammatical description of the shift of work-
load and the ease of affecting change in the construction process forward. The graph, which 
has come to be known as the MacLeamy curve (Figure 1.1), is not simply intended to imply a 
shift in labor earlier in the design process; rather, it stresses the importance of being able to 
make higher-value decisions earlier before changes become too difﬁcult or costly to implement. 
The x-axis of the chart represents project phases from conceptual design through occupancy,

Understanding Project Roles
It’s also important to understand how the signiﬁcant changes to tools and processes provided 
by BIM affect the roles and responsibilities of the project team. Project managers need to plan 
stafﬁng and labor required to complete tasks in every project phase. BIM projects are supported 
by a few primary roles that will allow the team a level of predictability, although the speciﬁc 
effort and stafﬁng will vary between ofﬁces (and even projects). Here are the primary roles that 
should be considered on every BIM project:
Design Architect  Generates design intent from the planning stage through early design
Technical Architect  Produces the deliverables, ensuring the design intent is achieved
Coordinator  Directs the BIM workﬂow between design and production
These roles represent efforts and general tasks that you need to take into account on any BIM 
project. For larger projects, these roles could represent multiple people, whereas smaller projects 
Another important aspect of a BIM workﬂow is its ability to leverage decisions earlier in the 
process. As shown in Figure 1.2, implementing BIM in earlier project phases allows teams to 
make and share better information earlier so that the entire project team can beneﬁt earlier. On 
the basis of the BIM uses, a common industry term that we will refer to later in this chapter, 
project teams may need to adjust labor in the planning and design stages to support the devel-
opment of the geometric and data model. In a CAD workﬂow, different project roles may be 
tasked with separate tasks in order to move the design forward. A planner may be developing 
a program, just as a designer may be producing massing studies. In a BIM workﬂow, these roles 
may be continuing the same task but in the context of a single model allowing them to interact 
through geometry and information. Because of this interaction and its ability to allow better 
decision-making, project teams may be deploying additional staff to help support this collabo-
ration in BIM. Depending on the BIM uses, teams might increase staff to build a model or to 
perform energy analysis; however, deploying a BIM workﬂow will not necessarily provide more 
proﬁciency or quality than a CAD-based project without proper planning and governance.

THE MANAGEMENT PEOPLE INSIDE A BIM PROJECT TEAM | 7
might constitute the same person ﬁlling multiple roles. For many architecture ﬁrms, designers 
and production staff may be tightly integrated and have few differences in the responsibilities. 
For other ﬁrms, there may be a clear demarcation between the ﬁrst two roles. Regardless of the 
interaction between designers and production roles, every BIM project has some coordination 
responsibilities. We will next explore each of these in more detail and discuss how these roles 
affect the project workﬂow.
The Role of the Design Architect
The role of the design architect is to generate the design intent, typically focused on the project 
from pursuit through planning to design development. These staff may include licensed archi-
tects and interns. Designers typically interact with the BIM process by ﬁrst transferring their 
conceptual ideas into digital form. For many planners this is going from two 2D layouts to a 3D 
model. For more sophisticated designers it might be to create a conceptual massing model based 
on sketched geometry or something as sophisticated as iterative design calculations. Whatever 
the case, designers are the origin for models of the project.
For some workﬂows, designers may stay in a more traditional process, and technical archi-
tects begin the BIM process based on their designs. As creative processes and digital capabilities 
align, designers moving forward are more likely to use digital authoring tools for their work 
rather than traditional ones, such as hand sketching and physical modeling. With this, the BIM 
process will start earlier in the project timeline. Following this workﬂow, designers have the 
capability to make better decisions for the project team earlier based on the intelligence they 
provide to their geometric-based designs. What becomes most important at this stage is having 
a workﬂow speciﬁc to design work in BIM projects that allows creativity but properly sets the 
stage for production staff to develop the designs into buildable instructions. With this in mind, 
the typical responsibilities for design architect include
 
◆
Create initial design intent models through the creation of 3D geometry through concep-
tual massing or iterative design processes.
 
◆
Lead the creation of architectural elements and building from within the model.
 
◆
Design around code requirements and other building logistics.
The Role of the Technical Architect
The role of the technical architect is to ensure that the project is buildable. These staff can be 
a wide-ranging group from experienced licensed architects and architectural technologists 
to interns who are learning how buildings go together. As with design architects, technical 
architects have a role in the BIM process not because of their professional skill sets but because 
of their responsibilities to the project workﬂow. As models are developed, technical archi-
tects solve issues such as constructability, wall types, and managing the program of spatial 
and equipment requirements, as well as other issues involving code compliance and client 
relationships.
Primarily concerned with deliverables, production staff manipulates models to create the 
needed outputs, such as drawings and schedules. The role of these staff is to create sheets and 
embellish associated views with annotations or other details. This role applies standards to the 
project (as in wall types, keynotes, and so on) and organizes the document set. Technical archi-
tects are responsible for the bulk of the work needed to document the project. In earlier stages of 

8 | CHAPTER 1 UNDERSTANDING THE  PRINCIPLES OF BIM
the project, this role is typically assumed by either the architect or the modeler, but as documen-
tation progresses into later phases of design, this can quickly become the role of multiple people 
on a larger project. This role includes the following tasks:
 
◆
Validate the constructability and detailing aspects of the design.
 
◆
Produce project deliverables from well-coordinated models.
 
◆
Follow the established Level of Development (LOD) or Model Development Speciﬁca-
tion (MDS) to ensure models comply with requirements of the stated BIM uses.
 
◆
Ensure the models and valid data are passed to construction and operation phases of the 
project lifecycle.
The Role of the Coordinator
BIM coordinators supervise the overall project modeling techniques and discipline-speciﬁc BIM 
output through all project phases. They are responsible for checking that all models produced by 
design and production staff comply with the standards set out by the BIM project execution  
plan (PxP). They check that models are correctly named and are the current version and that all 
relevant asset metadata has been completed with appropriate values. They coordinate requests for 
supplier information from the design teams and determine whether model details already exist 
in the library of design objects. Where model components do not already exist, they create or dele-
gate their creation in the context of standards and set responsibilities. Their BIM duties are to
 
◆
Author and maintain the technical sections of the PxP.
 
◆
Determine project ﬁle organization and model splitting strategy.
 
◆
Deﬁne ﬁle sharing protocols for the project.
 
◆
Determine team training needs and organize training if needed.
 
◆
Assemble and maintain any multidiscipline models.
 
◆
Manage publication of ﬁles.
 
◆
Create project delivery output from assembled ﬁles matching all the ﬁrm’s BIM standards.
 
◆
Review models for adherence to project standards.
 
◆
Maintain the team’s access to the correct tools for BIM authoring, aggregation, and analysis.
 
◆
Oversee the application of BIM technologies and ensure that the model adheres to all inter-
nal and client-speciﬁc goals and standards.
 
◆
Oversee the development of the content of a speciﬁc model element to the LOD/MDS listed 
for a particular phase of the project.
 
◆
Assist all team members in BIM processes at all stages of the project.
 
◆
Lead 3D coordination meetings.
These BIM roles for architectural project teams generally work for most ﬁrms and building 
types; however, it is ultimately up to each organization and its management to decide how team 

ESTABLISHING A BIM EXECUTION PLAN | 9
members share in the responsibilities of managing geometry and connected data speciﬁcally for 
its needs. As long as there is an expectation set at the beginning of the project and a workﬂow 
deﬁned during its phases, any number of roles and responsibilities should help ensure that the 
project is completed successfully. In support of that, project managers have a responsibility to 
help maintain the integrity of this workﬂow. Although they may not be directly developing 
models, they are making important stafﬁng decisions based on this workﬂow and have the 
responsibility to ensure that the deliverables from this process meet contractual obligations. 
With that, we suggest that project managers have enough knowledge of BIM people, processes, 
and tools to do the following:
 
◆
Understand the impact BIM has on a project delivery schedule.
 
◆
Allocate time as planned for BIM management activities for the BIM coordinator and any 
BIM administration and support requirements.
 
◆
Be familiar with BIM concepts and uses on a project so that they are able to effectively 
manage the project team and communicate progress and requirements to the client.
 
◆
Oversee the administrative and contract sections of the BIM project execution plan.
Establishing a BIM Execution Plan
To optimize your results with BIM, you need to start with the end in mind. Although a lot of 
tasks are possible with BIM, before you draw your ﬁrst wall, you will want to create a BIM  
project execution plan. We go into more detail about creating these plans and some resources for 
them in Chapter 6, “Working with Consultants,” but essentially a BIM plan helps to drive the 
direction of the modeling effort and modeling outcomes. How will your consulting team share 
models? Will your project need to provide BIM deliverables such as a reference model or data-
bases in the Construction Operations Building Information Exchange format? Does the owner 
have expectations for a model deliverable for operations and management? All of those possibili-
ties and more are explored and documented in a PxP. It gives the project team a deﬁnitive out-
come to develop and enrich the models.
Creating a standard BIM project execution planning process will help project teams to 
plan and execute the required processes to achieve the anticipated goals. Using a PxP tem-
plate and a planned methodology, the project team members should actively pursue these 
concepts:
 
◆
All parties should clearly understand and communicate the strategic goals for implement-
ing BIM on the project.
 
◆
Teams should understand and communicate their roles and responsibilities in the project 
execution.
 
◆
The plan should outline resources, training, or other competencies necessary to success-
fully implement BIM for the intended uses.
 
◆
The baseline plan should provide a goal for measuring progress throughout the project.
 
◆
The plan should provide a benchmark for describing the process to future participants 
who join the project.

10 | CHAPTER 1 UNDERSTANDING THE  PRINCIPLES OF BIM
Teams carry additional process risk when implemented by teams that are not experienced 
with the BIM process, as many team members, managers and users alike, are not familiar with 
the strategies and processes of this workﬂow. If the process is well planned and communicated, 
the project team will set expectations of what is to be done and how, thereby reducing the over-
all risk to the project. To ensure a successful project execution planning process, the team should 
do the following things with the PxP:
 
◆
Modify the plan to meet the project’s needs.
 
◆
Build the plan with the entire consulting team.
 
◆
Create an LOD or an MDS with the entire consulting team to facilitate model and staff 
planning, unless it is already required by the owner.
 
◆
Review the plan early and often, making needed changes as project experience grows.
For those of you who are responsible for developing the PxP for your team, begin your plan 
by referencing industry-based templates, such as the Penn State Project Execution Plan or the 
Autodesk BIM Deployment Plan, that can provide you with shortcuts to a well-organized and 
consistent PxP process. Determine what is needed by your project teams and then modify the 
plan to match your requirements. Additional language speciﬁc to the type of facility and con-
struction should be added to the plan to make it more appropriate. A comprehensive PxP should 
include these sections:
 
◆
Statement of project goals and objectives
 
◆
Intended BIM uses
 
◆
Team structure and deliverables
 
◆
Roles and responsibilities
 
◆
Data transfers
 
◆
Phase-based data requirements
 
◆
Intended authoring, analysis, and aggregation tools
 
◆
Governance information
By doing these things, project teams should have no problem developing a comprehensive 
project execution plan that will beneﬁt them on a daily basis.
Optimizing BIM Processes
According to the National Institute of Building Sciences (www.nibs.org), BIM is deﬁned as “a 
digital representation of physical and functional characteristics of a facility” that serves as a 
“shared knowledge resource for information about a facility forming a reliable basis for deci-
sions during its lifecycle from inception onward.” Although this is the deﬁnition of the noun 

OPTIMIZING BIM PROCESSES | 11
In a BIM-based workﬂow, the team creates 3D parametric models to generate the drawings 
necessary for documentation and analysis. Plans, sections, elevations, schedules, and perspec-
tives are all by-products of creating a building information model, as shown in Figure 1.4. This 
enhanced representation methodology not only allows for highly coordinated documentation 
but also provides the basic model geometry necessary for analysis, such as daylighting studies, 
energy usage simulation, material takeoffs, and so on.
used to represent the electronic data, the verb form of building information modeling is equally 
important. BIM is both a tool and a process, and one cannot realistically exist without the other.
Building information modeling implies an increased attention to more informed design and 
enhanced collaboration. Simply relying on tools to replace your current processes without an 
updated corresponding methodology will yield limited success. In fact, it may even be more 
cumbersome than using traditional CAD tools to execute project work.
Regardless of the design and production workﬂow you have established in the past, mov-
ing to BIM is going to be a change. Moving to BIM is a shift in how designers and contrac-
tors approach the design and documentation process throughout the entire lifecycle of the 
project, from concept to occupancy. In a traditional CAD-based workﬂow, represented in 
Figure 1.3, each view is drawn separately with no inherent relationship between drawings. In 
this type of production environment, the team creates plans, sections, elevations, schedules, 
and perspectives as stand-alone entities and must coordinate any changes between these 
views manually.

Identifying and Planning BIM Uses
We encourage you to explore ongoing research from organizations such as Penn State University, 
buildingSMART International, and the UK BIM Task Group. Penn State (http://bim.psu.edu) 
has developed a catalog of BIM uses and project implementation guidelines that have been 
adopted into the National BIM Standard-United States Version 3 (http://nationalbimstandard 
.org). Another important aspect of supporting numerous BIM uses is the development of open 
standards. The organization known as buildingSMART (www.buildingsmart.org) provides a 
global platform for the development of such standards. The UK-based BIM Task Group  
(www.bimtaskgroup.org) is helping the region adopt BIM practices through building standards and 
educational support. Groups from a number of regional chapters around the world are generating 
information exchange standards that will soon have a profound impact on the ways in which we 
share model data with our clients and partners. The following are some of the latest developments:
 
◆
Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) version 4
 
◆
Construction Operations Building Information Exchange (COBie)
 
◆
Speciﬁers’ Properties Information Exchange (SPie)
 
◆
BIM Collaboration Format (BCF)
For a general overview of the approach to standardizing exchanges with information deliv-
ery manuals (IDMs) and model view deﬁnitions (MVDs), visit www.buildingsmart-tech.org/

As the industry continues to build processes around the technology behind BIM, its poten-
tial continues to grow. Many applications are possible using building information modeling.

IDENTIFYING AND PLANNING BIM USES | 13
When you are trying to plan and manage your organization’s BIM and methodology, it’s 
important to think about the use of these processes and technology to achieve your project 
goals. One of the primary ways of understanding this is through BIM uses. These many uses 
can be organized into ﬁve basic activities: gather, generate, analyze, communicate, and realize.
Gather  To collect and manage building information
Generate  To create information about the building
Analyze  To examine aspects or components of the building to make better decisions about 
how to plan, design, construct, or operate it
Communicate  To shared information about a building collaboratively
Realize  To build or manage a physical element using building data
Understanding how beneﬁts are derived from these uses will help focus your teams’ efforts 
in planning, managing, and governing BIM processes.
Gather
As architects pursue work and plan awarded projects, they gather information about budgets, 
required functionality, site context, and anything else of signiﬁcance that is required to make 
the best decisions for the project. In an analog process, this information may be gathered in 
the building program, a contract, or even a cartoon set of drawings required. The advent of 
BIM processes and technology is changing this. BIM not only allows the acquisition of smartly 
acquired contextual data about the project but also becomes an improved repository for infor-
mation gathered in traditional ways.
One example of these traditional processes is the creation of the space program. Space pro-
grams are usually developed by interviewing user groups that are to occupy the building and 
gathering information about the things that they do and the equipment they need in the adja-
cencies of the spaces they occupy. These processes are collected in a spreadsheet or in graphical 
As more and more beneﬁts are achievable through BIM, teams ﬁnd new uses to explore and 
develop. Figure 1.5 shows some of the potential opportunities that have been identiﬁed by the 
AEC (architecture, engineering, and construction) industry and clearly organized by Penn State.

layouts that explain their qualities. This type of data is typically used in parallel with the design 
process, with many planners manually pulling information into computer-aided drawing (CAD) 
layouts. With BIM, this process takes on a more evolved approach to connecting design data 
to programmatic requirements. Using a BIM process, a designer can input spatial information 
directly into the model database even before conceptual massing or area plans are generated. 
This allows the designer to take directly from the program information to lay out a design and 
get instant feedback on whether it meets the required tolerances for these requirements.
Another example of gathering intelligent data could be in the form of laser scanning. There 
are sophisticated technologies that allow for the generation of point clouds for pre-existing 
spaces. The generation of these spatially located points can be used as an accurate underlay in 
the building of existing conditions. With millions of points available, designers have at their  
ﬁngertips a massive amount of data in which to begin to understand the context of their designs. 
This has incredible applications for complex renovations or spatially challenged sites or even 
historical preservation efforts.
Through this kind of information gathering, the qualiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation of data can 
empower the design team to understand both the implicit and explicit attributes of its projects. 
These processes can also help support estimating and cost forecasting efforts. During the early 
design phases of a building, quantities may be generally estimated but become more certain as 
the contract documents are created and construction processes proceed. All along the stored 
information becomes more and more accurate with respect to design intent.
Toward the later part of the construction process and into operations and maintenance, pro-
cesses can help establish real-time performance measurements within facilities to help owners 
understand energy usage, operation costs, and many other metrics. As an example, an inte-
grated operations and maintenance (O&M) system may be tracking electrical costs on an hourly, 
daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly basis to help owners understand where they’re maximizing 
their energy investments and where there is waste that they may reduce. Information gathering 
can be important throughout the entire lifecycle of a BIM project.
Generate
One of the most common aspects of building information modeling, and the one most acces-
sible to new users, is the creation of intelligent geometry. As users draw a wall, a mass, or a new 
level, they are generating not only form but also data that helps them make informed design 
decisions. For example, when a wall is drawn in an authoring tool, that object can immediately 
have attributes such as length, width, and height. It may also have multiple materials, structural 
and ﬁnish, as well as cost and a ﬁre rating. In a CAD process, the users must maintain the intel-
ligence that they attribute to the objects they are drawing. They may be able to quickly gener-
ate four lines to represent a wall that could understand length and width, but that’s where the 
distinction stops. These CAD drawings, although they can contain additional information, are 
inherently based on the output, whereas building information models inform the outputs rather 
than vice versa. A wall in a model database is the design. In CAD, the outputs represent what 
the users conceptually maintain in their mind. As smart as we are as architects, we can’t main-
tain all the information needed to be communicated to the contractor in building our designs. 
That’s where BIM can begin to support us by maintaining the information for us.
When users generate information about the project through both geometry and integrated 
data, they are prescribing attributes, arranging elements, and determining real-world dimensions. 
Within the context of the lifecycle of the building, the designers during the planning and design 

IDENTIFYING AND PLANNING BIM USES | 15
phases are the primary generators of geometry and data. During the construction phase of the proj-
ect, the subcontractors will manage most of the data in the models. For sophisticated BIM projects, 
the construction phase management of as-built data can be created to build a foundation for the 
operations phase where that information could be used to operate and maintain the building. This 
database that they might maintain could be updated with new information throughout its entire 
lifecycle. This might include new equipment installed or renovations made to existing structures.
As experts generate both geometry and data for the project, they are specifying qualities and 
generating design data. The planner of a building may deﬁne particular spaces in the building, 
just as a structural engineer may deﬁne a structural grid. Later in the project, a contractor might 
deﬁne a speciﬁc construction sequence as attributes of materials, just as the owner’s construc-
tion manager may deﬁne the need for a speciﬁc piece of equipment. Because all these ideas are 
generated inside the building information model or linked systems that inﬂuence this database, 
generation of building data can happen in every phase.
As designers make decisions about the spatial conﬁgurations of the building, they have a 
range of elements in three dimensions. This is the beginning of 3D coordination processes, 
which is a major asset to BIM practices in terms of collaboration and problem solving. This can 
begin with the arrangement of spaces; move to an arrangement of structural systems, through 
mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems; and end with coordination of trades that are con-
structing the building. Because of all these aspects that occupy space and therefore have some 
relationship with one another, the model becomes a spatial organizer for this arrangement.
Before the opportunities that BIM provides, subcontractors could only determine technical 
issues with installations as services were being installed. This might include a piece of ductwork 
that does not quite have enough room to move around a beam or a doorway that does not have 
enough clearance from the edge of the stair riser. Because BIM provides the ability to simulate design 
conditions, the spatial coordination between designers, engineers, and consultants can be addressed 
prior to construction and installation. We now have the ability to ﬁnd mistakes within a simulated 
environment and provide corrective actions during the design phase of the project. This ability to 
solve problems earlier in the arrangement of these three-dimensional objects affords designers and 
builders a great opportunity of designing better outcomes with much more cost-effective and timely 
solutions. In the end, it’s much cheaper to ﬁx it in the computer than in the ﬁeld.
The sizing geometry also is an important aspect to the generation of information in these 
models. Just as spatial organization is important, the ability to estimate the correct dimensional 
aspects of building systems in the speciﬁcation of speciﬁc equipment is important. Generating 
sizing information in a 3D model might take the form of creating types based on standard 
industry speciﬁcations. Being able to speciﬁcally model objects that have real sizes and toler-
ances helps designers be able to make the right decisions about specifying common building 
elements and complex building systems. Typical authoring programs have tolerances built in 
for the level of detail that’s required to have buildings constructed accurately. Users have the 
capability of modeling much more accurately than they ever could in the ﬁeld. Of course, the 
caution here is that teams need to realize that though they can be more accurate in the model, 
the ultimate purpose of the model is to get the building built and into operation efﬁciently and 
effectively. This means sizes should be based on the requirements of the construction trades; 
any more information or accuracy beyond that is not needed. However, where BIM shines above 
typical CAD processes is its ability to share truth. It is much more work to hide the true sizes 
than it is to display them accurately. This may frustrate some users who are used to applying 
their own dimensions, until they realize that the models represent what they designed, whether 
it is to a standard dimension or not.

16 | CHAPTER 1 UNDERSTANDING THE  PRINCIPLES OF BIM
In some instances, models authored in one platform may not work directly with analysis 
platforms, such as the example in A and B. This caused the re-creation of the geometry directly 
in the analysis tool and also required time to coordinate and maintain the design and its itera-
tions between the two models. The trend of these tools is moving toward better integration or 
additional analysis tools embedded inside the authoring applications. In application C, model 
geometry was directly imported into the analysis package, saving nearly 50 percent of the time 
needed to create and run the full analysis. Using this workﬂow, you can bring analysis to more 
projects, perform more iterations, or do the analysis in half the time.
The same workﬂow is true for daylighting (Figure 1.7) and other types of building perfor-
mance analysis. By designing directly in the authoring tool, designers are able to move away 
from anecdotal or prescriptive design solutions and begin to rely on calculated results.
Building analysis can reach beyond just the design phase and into the whole building  
lifecycle. Once the building has been occupied, the use of BIM does not need to end. More 
advanced facilities management systems support tracking—and thereby trending—building use 
over time. By trending building use, you can begin to predict usage patterns and help anticipate 
future uses such as energy consumption or expansion. This strategy can help you become more 
proactive with maintenance and equipment replacement because you will be able to perceive 
how equipment performance begins to degrade over time. Trending will also aid you in pro-
viding a more comfortable environment for building occupants by understanding historic use 
patterns and allowing you to keep the building tuned for optimized energy performance. The 
application of this analysis comes in the Realize stage of BIM uses covered later in this chapter.
Analyze
The primary purpose for the authoring environment is creation and not analysis. Because 
geometry and data are combined in a single database, conﬁdence in that interaction allows us 
to begin to understand what it is and what it will create. This ﬁrst step into analysis begins at 
the planning stages. However, it’s common to pull information from the authoring environ-
ment into one speciﬁcally built for analysis. You’ll ﬁnd that many processes and tools speciﬁ-
cally built for analysis work in parallel, and sometimes perpendicular, to model authoring. The 
real value in BIM beyond design documentation is the interoperability of model geometry and 
metadata between applications. Consider energy modeling as an example. In Figure 1.6, we’re 
comparing three energy-modeling applications: A, B, and C. In the ﬁgure, the darkest blue bar 
reﬂects the time it takes to either import model geometry into the analysis package or redraw 
the design with the analysis package. The lighter blue bar reﬂects the amount of time needed to 
add data not within the authoring environment, such as loads, zoning, and so on. The lightest 
bar represents the time it takes to perform the analysis once all the information is in place.

IDENTIFYING AND PLANNING BIM USES | 17
Communicate
Using BIM to better visualize a building is a powerful way to communicate design intent. Creating 
documentation and visualization using BIM gives teams the added advantage of being able to 
communicate the design of the project in 3D, where it is more accessible to project participants. It 
is especially persuasive for those who are typically involved directly with the construction process 
but are still important decision-makers. Owners can beneﬁt greatly from this type of communica-
tion. In this, visualization is an important tool for making design or construction decisions.
Although 3D visualization was initially conceived as one of the “low-hanging fruits” of a BIM 
workﬂow, this beneﬁt has led to an explosion of additional perceptions of the design, including 
isometric details, renderings, animations, clash detection reports, and so on. This provides a much 
better way to communicate design opportunities and decisions between project stakeholders.
In the 1990s, if you wanted to create a rendering, a physical model, a daylighting model, 
an energy model, and an animation, you would have had to create ﬁve separate models and 
use ﬁve different pieces of software. There was no ability to reuse model geometry and data 
between model uses. One of the key uses of BIM is the opportunity to repurpose the model for 
a variety of visualizations. This not only allows you to not have to re-create geometry between 
uses but also ensures you’re using the most current information in each visualization because 
it all comes from the same source. As the capacity of cloud rendering and analysis grows, the 
feedback will no longer need to process locally, and you’ll be able to receive feedback faster.
This digital creation of the project has given us a variety of tools to communicate its aspects. 
Because the model is a single source of truth, it can be used in many different applications for 
communicating. Models may be imported into a gaming engine for an interactive virtual expe-
rience, allowing clients to virtually tour the building at their own pace, to help understand how 
this building will accommodate their functional and aesthetic needs. These same virtual models 
can also be physically printed through rapid prototyping methods such as 3D printing, creat-
ing small models (Figure 1.8) in a fraction of the time it would take to build one by hand. Many 
other forms of communicating through BIM are emerging as you read this book.

18 | CHAPTER 1 UNDERSTANDING THE  PRINCIPLES OF BIM
If we consider a broad spectrum of representations, from tabular data to intelligently gener-
ated 2D documentation and 3D visualization, our traditional design deliverables become trans-
formed. Schedules give you instantaneous reports on component quantities and space usage, 
whereas plans, sections, and elevations afford you the ﬂexibility to customize their display 
using the information embedded in the modeled elements. For example, the plan in Figure 1.9 
shows how color ﬁlls can be automatically applied to illustrate space usage by function. Because 
this is live in the model, changes can be made easily, providing conﬁdence to the communica-
tors and the receivers of this information that what they are seeing is accurate and can be the 
basis of valid decision-making.
Expanding 2D documentation to include 3D imagery also gives project teams the ability to 
clearly share the intent of more complex designs. It also has a positive effect on construction 
by reducing translation errors with illustrative documentation, rather than cryptic details and 
notations. Figure 1.10 shows a basic example of a drawing sheet composed of both 2D and 3D 
views generated directly from the project model.
Another obvious beneﬁt to creating a complete model of the building is the ability to gener-
ate a wide variety of 3D images for presentation. These images are used not only to describe 
design intent but also to illustrate ideas about proportion, form, space, and functional relation-
ships. The ease with which these kinds of views can be produced makes the rendered perspec-
tive more of a commodity. As shown in the left side of Figure 1.11, materiality may be removed 
to focus on the building form and element adjacencies. The same model is used again for a ﬁnal 
photorealistic rendering, as shown in the right side of Figure 1.11. As the model contains infor-
mation of both form and function, it’s up to the communicator to decide what information is 
shared. A plan, perspective, and schedule can share common information. Because they come in 
different forms, the intent of the communication can be different. That is the great boon of hav-
ing an intelligent model; you decide where and when information is communicated in any of 
the outputs with the conﬁdence that it is the single source of truth.

By adding materials to the BIM elements, you can begin to explore the space in color and light, 
creating photorealistic renderings of the building. These images can convey information about 
both the intent and context of the design. Iterations at this level are limited only by processing 
power and user intent. The photorealism allows for an almost lifelike exploration of color and 
light qualities within a built space even to the extent of allowing analytic brightness calcula-
tions to reveal the exact levels of light within a space, but with the added beneﬁt of being derived 
directly from the working models. In this case, renderings can be an embedded process or a per-
pendicular instantaneous output. The ﬁrst option would be rendering within the authoring tool. 
This would produce timely renderings based on the current models but may not be of the quality 
needed for presentation purposes. More high-end renderings used for marketing would nor-
mally require exports from models brought into speciﬁc rendering tools. These renderings can be 
more stylized or photorealistic; however, they are a snapshot in time of the working model and 
take additional preparation to be useful. This in effect ends their BIM connectivity.
The next logical step is taking these elements and adding the element of time. In Figure 1.12, 
you can see a still image taken from a phasing animation (commonly referred to as a 4D simu-
lation) of a project. Not only do these simulations convey time and movement through space, 
but they also have the ability to demonstrate how the building will react or perform under 
real lighting and atmospheric conditions. All of this fosters a more complete understanding of 
the constructability and performance of a project before it is realized. This is also a common 
method when trying to understand construction sequencing by contractors as they are planning 
the building of the facility.
Realize
The use of BIM can potentially remove the direct human input to develop speciﬁc elements of the 
facility. Using the data generated through BIM-based planning and design processes to fabricate or 
manage building elements of the facility allows facility owners to realize some of the most beneﬁ-
cial aspects of the entire endeavor. Using BIM for facility management can enable owners to take 
advantage of the facility data throughout the building’s lifecycle to support safe, effective, and efﬁ-
cient environments. The maintenance of this data can improve efﬁciencies through having accurate 
as-builts. It can promote the optimization of operation and maintenance of the facility’s systems to 
reduce energy usage. Let’s explore two main concepts of BIM realization: assemblage and control.

IDENTIFYING AND PLANNING BIM USES | 21
Assemblage  By developing building information modeling, you can replan building ele-
ments way before they are actually fabricated and assembled. This can include the speciﬁc 
speciﬁcation of existing systems or the design of custom systems to be installed in the facil-
ity. Examples include picking a water pump that ﬁts both the functional requirements and 
the spatial requirements of a mechanical space or the opportunity to prefabricate a custom 
receptionist desk for a highly designed lobby space. During the projects’ early phases, these 
processes can be used to generate multiple design schemes. For construction, these processes 
can help the contractors to understand the process of bringing materials on-site and how and 
when they should go together. It might also inform them how to pre-assemble custom sys-
tems for delivery to the project site, preventing cumbersome storage or barriers to successful 
assemblage such as poor weather or misinterpreted documents. Being able to assemble sys-
tems with the aid of machines, such as CNC (Computer Numerical Control) systems, can 
reduce not only costs but also the time needed to install components in the facility. Examples 
of prefabrication might include wall systems, ductwork, and curtainwall.
Control  Building information modeling also allows operators of the facilities to help man-
age and maintain the equipment and systems once they are installed on-site. If a database 
was created during the planning, design, and construction phases of the project to ensure 
that all as-built systems are well documented with speciﬁc properties associated with each 
system, operations and maintenance stakeholders not only will have a better knowledge of 
what systems they have but also may have some automated processes that could schedule 
maintenance requests or connect in with building system analysis tools. When you do an 
analysis of the lifespan of a building, you will see most of the time is in the occupancy stage. 
This really means that most of the money spent on the facility is running it. If BIM can  
help reduce the costs of operating and maintaining a facility, this becomes a huge beneﬁt to 
owners that can be realized through a building information modeling process. Architects 
are the primary origin of this information that can help owners achieve these beneﬁts. A 
good model-based database can help an owner solve maintenance issues more quickly, may 
be able to ﬁnd potential issues more readily, and can be able to plan future construction 
much more easily. The use of this data to regulate facility systems potentially allows

22 | CHAPTER 1 UNDERSTANDING THE  PRINCIPLES OF BIM
facility operators to optimize their operations. It is even possible that in the future, build-
ing systems could be automated because of information generated by BIM. Being able to 
plan the system integrations ahead of time allows for more intelligence built into the facility. 
An example of this is when a thermostat is programmed to modify the settings of the HVAC 
system in response to preprogrammed rules by its connection to an intelligent monitor-
ing system, enabled by the BIM. Beneﬁts such as these can really help owners optimize the 
 operations and maintenance of the facilities and demand more services from its designers, 
such as yourself.
Integrating Tools Inside a BIM Workﬂow
As you have read with the explanations of people and processes involved with BIM, the last 
aspect to discuss is the technology. Without the technology you would not be here; it sup-
ports all the other things that make building information modeling possible. The thing you 
may not realize is that even though it is the foundation of all these other great opportunities 
and beneﬁts, it is still a lesser aspect of the entire BIM ecosystem. This may confuse some 
readers, but in our experience we ﬁnd that the most meaningful changes happen with the 
people deploying these processes and the methodology they take in transforming their work. 
The tools that people use in their workﬂows to generate geometry and data change only 
slightly from year to year. Technology is constantly being improved, made more efﬁcient,  
and better integrated with other tools in the market. You as an individual user have little 
inﬂuence over this. Understanding the existing capabilities of tools is important; however, 
change in the technology sense is much more limited than improvements to your process 
and skill sets.
The purpose of this book is to connect your knowledge as a person with the best understand-
ing of authoring tool’s capabilities. That speciﬁc authoring tool, of course, is Autodesk Revit. 
Coming to this realization, the user must understand that an expert of the software is not an 
expert in BIM. Many people know the functions of the tool based on learning or experience but 
still do not have a grasp on why they should do something and when they should do it. That 
comes with having a better understanding of not only why BIM is beneﬁcial but also how all 
these things come together to create an architectural zeitgeist. Throughout this volume we hope 
to make contributions to your understanding of all three and to help you make the connection 
between opportunities in the application and a methodology to deploy them, with the overall 
sense of what it means to your project and to your organization.
What Is Revit?
Autodesk Revit software is a BIM application for authoring parametric 3D models that gener-
ate geometry with embedded information for the design and construction of buildings and 
infrastructure. It is from these intelligent models that plans, sections, elevations, perspectives, 
details, and schedules—all of the necessary instruments to document the design of a building—
can be derived. Drawings created using Revit are not a collection of 2D lines and shapes that 
are interpreted to represent a building but live views extracted from virtual building models. 
These models are a compilation of intelligent components that contain not only geometric 
attributes but also data informing decisions about the building at every stage of the process, 
including occupancy.

THE BOTTOM LINE | 23
Elements in Revit are managed and manipulated through a series of parameters that we will 
discuss in greater detail throughout this book. These elements have bidirectional associativity, 
allowing the user to change the 2D views to change the 3D model or to change the 3D model to 
change the 2D views. If you move a door in a plan, that door is moved in all of the elevations, 
sections, perspectives, and so on, in which that object appears. In addition, all of the element’s 
properties contain information internally, which means that intelligent annotations are directly 
linked to the objects. These tags display the object’s data directly, rather than a manual entry 
interpreted by the user. When contrasted with traditional CAD tools that store element informa-
tion only in the annotation, Revit gives you the opportunity to more easily input, manage, and 
export your project data for project coordination and execution.
Te Bottom Line
Focus your investment in BIM.  Since using Revit software is a change in workﬂow, it is 
also important to understand the change in stafﬁng and who is needed to perform what roles 
on a project.
Master It  What are the three primary roles in a Revit project, and what are the respon-
sibilities of those roles?
Understand a BIM workﬂow.  Understand how projects are completed in BIM and how the 
use of Revit software on a project can change how information within a project is created.
Master It  Explain one of the primary differences between a more traditional 2D CAD-
based workﬂow and producing documents using Revit.
Leverage BIM processes.  Understanding the level of risk your ﬁrm is willing to take in 
new technologies will help you establish goals for your future use of BIM.
Master It  Using the three areas of ﬁrm integration (visualization, analysis, and strat-
egy), deﬁne how those areas overlap for your ﬁrm or project.

 T e Basics of the Toolbox 
 The road to mastering Autodesk ® Revit ® 2018 software will always include reinforcement of 
fundamental skills. Just as an accomplished musician will practice her scales, here you will 
“practice” by reviewing the fundamental selection and editing tools throughout the Revit 
Architecture program. There are many tools that can assist you in reﬁ ning your models and 
project designs. Some are simple geometry-editing functions, whereas others possess more 
powerful capabilities.

 Selecting, Modifying, and Replacing Elements 
 Knowing how to select, modify, and replace elements efﬁ ciently is fundamental to working 
productively in Revit software. These interface operations are the foundation on which you will 
build skills to create and edit your project models. In the following sections, we will review 
methods for selecting, ﬁ ltering, and modifying properties. 
 Selecting Elements 
 Revit was one of the ﬁ rst programs that had the ability to pre-highlight elements as you hov-
ered the mouse pointer over them, before actually clicking to select. Not only does this give 
you a clear idea of what you are about to select, but it also displays information about that 
object in the status bar and in a banner near the mouse pointer. When you hover over any ele-
ment in Revit, it pre-highlights; click the highlighted element and it turns blue, indicating that 
it is selected. 
 Once an element is selected, the ribbon changes to Modify mode, where consistent edit-
ing tools are located on the left side and context-sensitive tools appear to the right. Notice 
the subtle differences in the ribbon, as shown in Figure  3.1 , when a roof, wall, and ﬂ oor 
are selected.

74 | CHAPTER 3 THE BASICS OF THE TOOLBOX
Changing Selection Colors
You can customize the default colors for selection, highlighting, and alerts to your own color  
palette. To do this, click the Application menu and select Options. In the Options dialog box, select 
the Graphics option on the left to edit the settings for colors.
While selecting an element is a seemingly simple task, Revit provides you with a few ways to  
perform a selection:
Add or Subtract  You can build a selection of individual elements by using the Ctrl and 
Shift keys on your keyboard. Hold down the Ctrl key while picking to add elements, and 
hold down the Shift key while picking to remove elements. Notice that the mouse pointer 
will indicate a plus (+) when you hold the Ctrl key and a minus (–) when you hold the 
Shift key.
Window  To select a large number of elements in a view window, you can click and drag the 
mouse to form two different types of selection windows. Click and drag from left to right, 
and only the elements completely within the window will be selected—this implied win-
dow is displayed as a solid line. Click and drag from right to left, and any element within or 
crossing the window will be selected—this implied window is displayed as a dashed line. To 
activate either window-selection tool, you must begin by clicking in a blank area (not on an 
element) within the view window.
Chain  Chain-select is an intelligent method for selecting connected elements such as walls, 
lines, sketch segments, and line-based components. To activate this mode, hover your mouse 
over (but don’t click) one linear element that is connected to several other linear elements. 
While the element is pre-highlighted, press the Tab key once and the connected elements will 
be pre-highlighted. You can then click to select the chain of elements. When selecting objects,

Te right end of the 
Modify tab changes 
based on the element

tab; (c) the Modify | 
Floors tab.

SELECTING, MODIFYING, AND REPLACING ELEMENTS | 75
use the Tab key to cycle through all available objects near your mouse pointer. If a ﬂoor edge 
happens to be near the edge of a wall that you are trying to chain-select, you can skip the 
chain of walls and select the ﬂoor. Be sure to look at the status bar; it will indicate “Chain of 
walls or lines” when you have selected correctly.
Select Previous Command  A little-known feature allows you to select elements you had 
previously selected. Either right-click and choose Select Previous from the context menu or 
press Ctrl and the left-arrow key on your keyboard.
Selection Options
You have the ability to choose elements that will be included or excluded when you select ele-
ments in a model. For instance, you can choose to select elements that are within a linked ﬁle. 
Or not. There are two ways to adjust these settings, as shown in Figure 3.2: click the drop-down 
menu under the Modify button in the ribbon, or use the icons at the right end of the status bar. 
Note that the icons in the status bar will change slightly to indicate the status of each option. 
When a mode is disabled, a small red X will be displayed on the icon (the second and fourth 
icons show that X in Figure 3.2b). One of these selection options is Select Elements By Face, 
which allows you to select elements simply by picking any face of the element.
Filtering Your Selection
Once you have elements selected, a count of selected objects is displayed at the right end of the 
status bar. You can also ﬁlter the selection into object categories by clicking the Filter icon in  
the status bar or ribbon. Just as when selecting folders in Windows Explorer, you can select mul-
tiple categories while holding the Shift key or add a single category by holding the Ctrl key. This 
tool allows you to select large numbers of elements and then focus your selection by removing 
categories you don’t need, as shown in Figure 3.3. For example, if you window-select an entire 
ﬂoor plan, you will have a selection set of many different categories. Using the Filter tool, you 
can limit the selection to just the Doors category—or perhaps Doors and Door Tags.
You can also use the Properties palette as a ﬁlter; see the section “Using the Properties 
Palette” later in this chapter for more information.
Figure 3.2 
Use selection options 
to avoid picking ele-
ments, such as links or 
pinned elements. Tese 
options are found in 
the Select expanded 
panel (a) and the status 
bar (b).

76 | CHAPTER 3 THE BASICS OF THE TOOLBOX
Using Selection-Based Filters
If you need to save a selection of elements for future editing, you can save a selection-based ﬁl-
ter. When you have a number of elements selected, click Save at the far right of the contextual 
tab of the ribbon, and you can create a named selection set model. To load or edit any saved 
selection-based ﬁlter, go to the Manage tab in the ribbon and locate the Selection panel. Click the 
Load button to activate any of the saved selection sets, and then you can use other tools such as 
Temporary Hide/Isolate to continue your task work. These selection sets remember the items 
selected within the categories and will not select additional items made after the selection set was 
created. You may update the selection set with new items by loading the existing set and using 
your Ctrl key to add and the Shift key to subtract. The selection set can be saved over the previ-
ous set or made as another set.
Selecting All Instances
Another fast and powerful method for selecting objects is the Select All Instances function. 
When you right-click a single object in the drawing area or a family in the Project Browser, 
the Select All Instances tool gives you two options: Visible In View or In Entire Project. 
Selecting the Visible In View option will select only those items you can see in the current 
view. This will not select elements that have been either temporarily or permanently hidden 
in the view.
Use the In Entire Project option carefully because you could modify elements in many places 
that you did not intend to change. Always remember to look at the selection count in the status 
bar when you use Select All Instances. Here are some common situations where you might use 
this tool:
 
◆
View titles—when updating graphics for all views
 
◆
Walls—when switching from generic to speciﬁc types across the entire model
Figure 3.3 
Use the Filter dialog 
box to ﬁne-tune your 
selections.

SELECTING, MODIFYING, AND REPLACING ELEMENTS | 77
 
◆
Title blocks—moving from design to detail documents for all title blocks
 
◆
Viewports—useful when trying to purge unused viewports
Note that Select All Instances does not work on model lines or symbolic lines. This limitation 
exists because lines not only are drawn in project views but also are integral parts of other objects 
such as ﬁlled regions and shaft openings.
Using the Properties Palette
The Properties palette is a ﬂoating palette that can remain open while you work within the 
model. The palette can be docked on either side of your screen, or it can be ﬂoated to any loca-
tion or a second monitor. You can open the Properties palette by using one of the following 
methods:
 
◆
Click the Properties icon in the Properties panel of the Modify tab in the ribbon.
 
◆
Select Properties from the context menu.
 
◆
Press Ctrl+1 or PP on your keyboard.
As shown in Figure 3.4, the Type Selector is located at the top of the Properties palette. When 
you are placing elements or swapping types of elements you’ve already placed in the model, the 
palette must be open to access the Type Selector.
When no elements are selected, the Properties palette displays the properties of the active 
view. If you need to change settings for the current view, make the changes in the Properties 
palette and the view will be updated. For views, you do not even need to use the Apply button 
to submit the changes—simply move the mouse out of the Properties palette, and the changes 
will automatically be accepted.
Customizing the Apply Button Behavior
You can modify the behavior of the Apply button in the Properties palette by editing the Revit.ini
ﬁle. By default, the Apply button applies any changes the second your mouse leaves the Properties 
palette. If you want to disable the automatic acceptance of settings when you move the mouse, add 
the following code to the Revit.ini ﬁle:
[UserInterface]
DisableMppAutoApply=1
If the bracketed text [UserInterface] already exists in the Revit.ini file; simply add 
DisableMppAutoApply=1 below it. You should restart Revit after making any changes to the 
Revit.ini ﬁle.

78 | CHAPTER 3 THE BASICS OF THE TOOLBOX
Figure 3.4 
Te Properties 
palette contains the 
Type Selector and 
is used to set view 
properties when no 
objects are selected.
Finally, you can also use the Properties palette as a ﬁltering method for selected elements. 
When you select elements from different categories, the drop-down list below the Type Selector 
displays the total number of selected elements. Open the list and you will see the elements listed 
per category, as shown in Figure 3.5. Select one of the categories to modify the parameters for the 
respective elements. This process is different from the Filter tool in that the entire selection set is 
maintained, allowing you to perform multiple modifying actions without reselecting elements.

Use the Properties 
palette to ﬁlter selec-
tion sets.
Matching Properties
Located on the Modify tab of the ribbon in the Clipboard panel, the Match Type Properties 
tool allows you to select one element and apply its type and instance properties to other 
elements of the same category. Once you select one element, the brush icon near the mouse 
pointer appears ﬁlled. Each subsequent pick on elements of the same category will replace 
the selected element with the properties of the ﬁrst element picked. Clicking in an open space 
will clear the brush icon and allow you to pick a new source object without restarting the 
command.
If you want to use the Match Type Properties tool for multiple objects in a more  
controlled manner, click the Select Multiple button in the contextual tab of the ribbon 
after the source object is selected. Proceed to use any of the usual selection methods 
described  earlier in this chapter. When your selection is complete, click the Finish button on 
the ribbon.
Be careful when using this tool with walls, because not only does it change the wall type, 
it also changes the top and bottom constraints of the walls being matched. One best practice 
for changing wall types without affecting height constraints is to pick a wall and use the Type 
Selector to modify its type.
Using the Context Menu
The context menu that appears when you right-click in the view window contains several 
options. You can activate the last command or select from a list of recent commands, as shown 
in Figure 3.6. The context menu will also show you the shortcuts for any commands that have a 
shortcut assigned. In Figure 3.6, you can see the shortcut for the wall command is WA (shown in 
parentheses).

80 | CHAPTER 3 THE BASICS OF THE TOOLBOX
In addition to the other right-click commands listed throughout this chapter (such as Create 
Similar), zoom commands, including Previous Pan/Zoom, are on the context menu. There are 
also useful commands when you right-click views in the Project Browser. For example, activate 
a plan view and then try right-clicking a 3D view in the browser. Select Show Section Box, and 
you can edit the extent of the 3D view’s section box while in a ﬂoor plan.
Editing Elements Interactively
The Revit software provides a range of options to edit elements in the model interactively. The 
most obvious are selecting elements and then dragging them on the screen or using the blue 
control grips to extend walls, lines, shape faces, and region boundaries; however, you often need 
more precise ways of moving and copying objects. Let’s look at some ways to do that.
Moving Elements
You can move elements in several ways, ranging from choosing traditional tools to using inter-
active dimensions that appear on the ﬂy when you select elements. Become familiar with each 
method and determine what is best for your workﬂow.
Using Temporary Dimensions
You have likely noticed by now that dimensions appear when elements are selected or newly 
placed. These dimensions are called Temporary Dimensions and are there to inform you of the 
location of the elements relative to other elements in the model, as well as to help you reposition 
Figure 3.6 
Run recent commands 
from the context menu.

EDITING ELEMENTS INTERACTIVELY | 81
them. Clicking the blue dimension value (the text representing the distance measurement) 
makes it an active and editable value. Type in a new value, and the selected element will move 
relative to the element from which it is dimensioned. Remember that when you are editing the 
position of an element via the dimensions, it will always be the selected element that moves. You 
can’t modify a dimension value if an element is not selected.
If a temporary dimension is not referencing a meaningful element, you can choose a different 
reference by dragging the small blue dot on the dimension’s witness line to a new, parallel refer-
ence, which will highlight when the mouse moves over it (Figure 3.7). For example, if you want 
to position a door opening at a speciﬁc dimension from a nearby wall, you will need to drag the 
grip of the temporary dimension that references the center of the door to the side of the opening. 
Then you can edit the value of the dimension as required. When you are dragging the grip of a 
temporary dimension, you can also use the Tab key on the keyboard to cycle through available 
snapping references near the mouse pointer. To learn more about how to add references to fami-
lies, refer to Chapter 15, “Designing with the Family Editor.”
Figure 3.7 
Drag or click the 
blue grip to change 
the reference of 
the temporary 
dimension
If you click a blue grip, it cycles to the next possible reference in the element. For example, 
clicking the grip of a dimension to a door or window cycles between the left and right open-
ings and the center reference. The same applies to walls: try clicking the grip on the temporary 
dimension extending from a wall and see how the dimension cycles through the various refer-
ences in the wall (interior face, centerline, exterior face). Note that when you drag a temporary 
dimension reference to a different position, the new reference is remembered when you return 
to the element for future editing.
You can also change the default behavior of temporary dimensions using the Temporary 
Dimension Properties dialog box, shown in Figure 3.8 (on the Manage tab, click Additional 
Settings and then select Temporary Dimensions). Here you can specify how temporary dimen-
sions will independently reference walls, doors, and windows.

82 | CHAPTER 3 THE BASICS OF THE TOOLBOX
You can modify the font size and transparency of temporary dimensions in the program 
options. To customize these values, click the Application menu and select Options. In the 
Options dialog box that opens, switch to the Graphics category and locate the Temporary 
Dimension Text Appearance settings. Adjust the text size and transparency according to your 
needs.
If you have several elements selected at the same time or select an element within the prox-
imity of a large number of other elements, temporary dimensions sometimes don’t appear. 
Check the Options bar for the Activate Dimensions button; clicking it will make the temporary 
dimensions appear in the view.
Figure 3.8 
Te Temporary 
Dimension Properties 
dialog box lets you 
deﬁne default behav-
iors based on your 
modeling needs.
Behaviors for Modify Tools
As in Autodesk AutoCAD software, you have the option to activate the Modify tools without any 
elements selected. If you choose this method, you must press the Enter key after selecting the 
objects you intend to modify.
You can also switch between any of the Modify panel tools while you have elements selected. For 
example, if you initially chose Mirror – Pick Axis and selected an element during the command, 
you can simply activate the Mirror – Draw Axis command without reselecting the elements.

EDITING ELEMENTS INTERACTIVELY | 83
Using the Move Tool
To relocate elements with more precision, use the Move tool rather than simply drag the ele-
ment. The tool allows you to type in values or use temporary dimensions as helpers to precisely 
locate your object.
Moving elements is a two-click process. First, you deﬁne a start point; then, you click to 
deﬁne a destination. If you know you need to move something a speciﬁc distance, it does 
not matter where your two picks take place. All that matters is that the distance between 
the two clicks is the speciﬁed distance and in the speciﬁed direction. Alternatively, you can 
guide the mouse pointer in the desired direction of the move and key in the desired dimen-
sion value.
There are a few options on the Options bar to be aware of when the Move command is active.
Constrain  When this option is selected, it constrains movement to horizontal and vertical 
directions relative to the view. Deselecting it allows you to move the element freely as long as 
the element is not hosted. Hosted elements, such as windows or doors, always move in a con-
strained manner parallel to their host’s axis.
Disjoin  The Disjoin option is helpful when you need to move elements and eliminate any 
joining relationships the moved elements might have with other objects. This is particularly 
useful with walls in some circumstances where you may be rapidly iterating through design 
scenarios.
You might also attempt to use the Disjoin option to move a hosted element, such as a door, 
to a new host. Don’t use the Move tool to perform this action; instead, you must select the 
hosted element, and from the contextual tab in the ribbon, click Pick New Host. The object 
will be relocated to the new host you select. This method is also preferred over deleting and 
re-creating because it maintains the data associated with the original element instance.
Multiple  The Multiple option is not active for the Move tool. This option is available only 
when you switch to the Copy tool.
Nudging Elements
Nudging is a simple way to push things around quickly, as you would in software programs 
such as Adobe Photoshop. When elements are selected, you can use the arrow keys on the 
keyboard to move the elements horizontally or vertically in small increments. Each press of an 
arrow key nudges the element a speciﬁc distance based on your current zoom factor. The closer 
you zoom, the ﬁner the nudge. Note that your snap settings do not affect the nudging distances 
set by the zoom level. However, holding the Shift key while using the nudge tool increases the 
distance of the nudge.
Moving with Nearby Elements
A simple way to constrain freestanding elements is to use the Moves With Nearby Elements 
option. This setting is designed to capture logical relationships between elements without 
establishing an explicit constraint. When furnishing a space, for example, you probably 
want to align the bed or dresser with an adjacent wall. If you change the design of the space, 
you want the furniture to follow the wall to the new location. For this purpose, select the 
furniture and then select Moves With Nearby Elements in the Options bar, as shown in 
Figure 3.9.

84 | CHAPTER 3 THE BASICS OF THE TOOLBOX
By setting this option, you create an invisible relationship between the bed and the wall 
so that each time you move the wall, the bed moves with it. To clarify the difference between 
this approach and other constraint relationships, you could create a wall-hosted family, but 
that would limit your placement options and would subject instances to deletion if the host is 
deleted. You could align and constrain the family to its host, but too many explicit constraints 
will adversely affect model performance.
The Moves With Nearby Elements option is also a simpler alternative to using a hosted fam-
ily. When a component family does not need to cut or carve the host geometry, consider using a 
freestanding family or just a face-based family in conjunction with the Nearby Elements option. 
Refer to Chapter 15 for more information about hosted versus nonhosted values.
Copying Elements
The Copy tool is another modifying tool that is nearly identical to the Move tool, but it makes a 
copy of the selected element at the location of the second pick. This tool doesn’t copy anything 
to the Clipboard; it copies an instance of an element or selection of elements in the same view. If 
you change views while using this tool, your selection is lost.
To activate this tool, choose elements you want to copy and then select the Copy tool in the 
Modify tab in the ribbon; alternatively, activate the Copy tool ﬁrst, select elements you want 
to copy, and then press the Enter key to start the copy process. Using the Options bar, you can 
choose to make multiple copies in one transaction by selecting the Multiple option.
An alternative to using the Copy tool is to use standard Windows accelerator keys to copy 
elements. To quickly copy a single element without the precision of the Copy tool, click and drag 
an element while pressing the Ctrl key on your keyboard. This technique is useful for quickly 
populating a quantity of elements in a design without the required precision of the multiple 
picks of the Copy tool.

Copying Using Worksets
If you are working in a model in which worksharing is enabled, be careful when performing any 
method of copying. Tese methods include pasting from the Clipboard, mirroring, and arraying, 
as well as using the Copy tool. Copied elements will always be placed on the active workset, not the  
workset of the original object. For example, if you are copying chairs that have been placed on  
the workset named Furniture but your active workset is Structure, the copied chairs will be assigned 
to the Structure workset. For more information, refer to Chapter 5, “Collaborating with a Team.”
Rotating and Mirroring Elements
When reﬁning or expanding your building design, you will likely ﬁnd a frequent need to rotate 
or mirror one or more objects. Just as with moving or copying, there are a few methods for these 
types of interactive operations. We will review these methods in the following sections.
Using the Spacebar
You can use the spacebar to rotate an element, both at the time of initial placement and after it 
has been placed. In addition to rotating an object in 90-degree increments, pressing the spacebar 
will locate any nearby non-orthogonal references (walls, grids, or reference planes) as rotation 
candidates. This is a great time-saving command to become familiar with because you can forgo 
the necessity of using an additional tool, such as Rotate or Mirror, after placing an object. Here 
are a few examples:
Doors and Windows  If you have a door with its swing in the wrong direction, select it 
and press the spacebar. You can cycle through all four possible orientations of the door 
using the spacebar. The same holds true for windows; however, many window families only 
let you ﬂip the window from inside to outside because many windows are symmetrical in 
elevation. If you are creating an asymmetrical window family, be sure to add ﬂip controls to 
the window family during its creation. These controls allow the spacebar to work on hosted 
elements.
Walls  If you select a wall, pressing the spacebar ﬂips the element as if it were being 
mirrored about its length. Walls ﬂip based on their location line, which often isn’t the 
centerline of the assembly. If you aren’t sure which direction your wall is facing, select it 
and look for the ﬂip-control arrows. These are always located on the exterior side of walls 
(Figure 3.10). You can also use the spacebar to ﬂip the direction of an object. Simply select 
the object and hit the spacebar to toggle through placement options while you’re locating a 
component.
Freestanding Elements  If you select a freestanding element, the spacebar rotates the ele-
ment around the center reference planes deﬁned in the family. Depending on how the family 
was built, the rotation origin may not make the most sense. If you decide to edit a family to 
change the location of the geometry relative to the center reference planes, be careful: when 
the family is loaded back into a project, all instances of the family will jump to a new location 
based on the change you made relative to the reference planes.

86 | CHAPTER 3 THE BASICS OF THE TOOLBOX
Using the Rotate Tool
To rotate an element, select it and click the Rotate tool in the Modify panel. Remember, you can 
also activate the Rotate tool ﬁrst, select one or more elements, and then press Enter to begin the 
operation. This is a two-click operation similar to the Move and Copy tools. The default rotation 
point is based on the center of the selected elements; however, you will most likely want to des-
ignate a more meaningful center.
To choose a new center of rotation, you have a couple of options. You can drag the center icon 
to a new location before clicking to set the starting reference angle. Note that you might have 
to zoom out in order to ﬁnd the center icon. The second option is to select elements you want to 
rotate and then use the Place button in the Options bar to simply place the rotation point in the 
desired location without dragging. Once the center is established, begin rotating the element 
using the temporary dimensions as a reference or by typing in the angle of rotation explicitly.
Note that you can also use keyboard snap shortcuts to reﬁne the location of the center of rota-
tion while dragging it. For example, type SE to snap to an explicit endpoint while dragging.
Using the Mirror Tool
The Mirror tool allows you to mirror elements across an axis in order to create a mirror image 
of an element or multiple elements. You can either pick an existing reference in the model with 
the Mirror – Pick Axis tool or draw the axis interactively using the Mirror – Draw Axis tool. In 
Figure 3.11, the centerline of the plumbing chase wall was picked as the axis for mirroring the 
plumbing ﬁxtures.

bath ﬁxtures are

an element. For walls,

EDITING ELEMENTS INTERACTIVELY | 87
Like the other Modify tools you have seen so far, the Mirror tools have the option to create a 
copy of the selected elements or to simply mirror the selected elements to a new position. You 
can ﬁnd the Copy option in the Options bar after you activate either of the Mirror tools.
Being Careful When Mirroring
Te Mirror tools should be used carefully on any type of freestanding elements that may be asym-
metrical in design. You can use the Mirror tools on any object, but keep in mind that performing 
this operation to suit a design may distort a product component. For example, if an asymmetrical 
chair family was loaded into your model and you decide to mirror it to ﬁt a space layout, the mir-
rored version of that chair may not be a viable product oﬀered by the manufacturer. Remember 
that although an object can be scheduled, the schedule cannot determine whether the object has 
been mirrored.
Arraying Elements
The Array tool allows you to copy instances of an element with equal spacing between the 
instances. You have the option to create intelligent arrays that can be grouped and associated 
for further reﬁnement, as well as one-off, unassociated arrays. Like the other tools we have 
reviewed in the Modify tab of the ribbon, the array options are presented on the Options bar.
You can create two types of arrays: linear and radial. Linear arrays are set as the default 
because they’re the most common. As you would expect, a linear array creates a series of ele-
ments in a line. Each element in the array can be given a deﬁned distance from the previous 
element (Move To 2nd option) or can be spaced equally based on a deﬁned overall array length 
(Move To Last option). Figure 3.12 shows a linear array where the Move To 2nd option was 
selected to deﬁne a ﬁxed distance between each instance in the array. Think of this type of 
array as additive and subtractive: if you change the number, the length of the array increases or 
decreases.
If you want to arrange elements in a ﬁxed space and the exact spacing between elements 
is less important, use the Move To Last option. Figure 3.13 shows an array where the location 
of its last element was picked and the elements were placed equally between the ﬁrst and last 
elements. With this option, the length is ﬁxed and the array squeezes elements within that con-
straint as the number changes.
A radial array uses the same options as a linear array, but it revolves around a center point. 
The Move To 2nd and Move To Last options function as angles instead of distances in a radial 
array. You can specify the instance angle or overall array angle with two picks, or you can enter 
a speciﬁc value. With this type of array, elements auto-rotate so that each element faces the cen-
ter of the array, as shown in Figure 3.14.

EDITING ELEMENTS INTERACTIVELY | 89
The radial array is a little trickier than a linear array. Here is how to achieve the example 
shown in Figure 3.14:
1. Download and open the ﬁle c03-Array.rvt from this book’s companion website at  
www.sybex.com/go/masteringrevit2018. Activate the Level 1 ﬂoor plan. To assist in 
starting the radial array, we provided a detail line to help locate the intended center of 
the array.
2. Select the chair and activate the Array tool from the Modify tab in the ribbon. In the 
Options bar, select the Radial option button, change Number to 6, and choose the Move 
To Last option.
3. In the drawing area, click and drag the grip indicating the center of rotation off the ele-
ment to the endpoint of the detail line provided.
4. Click the mouse to deﬁne any starting point. An exact starting point is not important, 
because you will be deﬁning a complete circle in the next step.
5. Do not click a second time; instead, go to the Options bar, type 360 in the Angle option, 
and press Enter on the keyboard.
6. Press Enter or click on any open space in the drawing area to complete the command.
Enabling the Group and Associate option allows you to treat an array as a group that can be 
modiﬁed later to adjust the number and spacing of the array. If this option is unchecked, the 
array is a one-off operation and you have no means of adjusting it after it is created.
As shown previously in Figure 3.12 and Figure 3.13, when an element in a grouped array is 
selected, a control appears, indicating the number of elements in the array. Editing that number 
changes the number of elements in the array. This tool comes in handy when you are creating 
certain families because the array number can be associated with a parameter or driven by a 
mathematical formula. See Chapter 15 for a detailed exercise.
Figure 3.14 
Elements will auto-
rotate in a radial array.

90 | CHAPTER 3 THE BASICS OF THE TOOLBOX
Grouping Arrays of Datum Elements
When developing a project for a multistory building, you may ﬁnd that using the Array tool is a 
quick and easy way to generate many levels and grid lines. We recommend not using the Group 
and Associate option when arraying datum elements. Maintaining grids and levels inside groups 
can cause problems with elements that refer to those data.
Scaling Elements
The Scale tool lets you scale certain lines and graphic elements in 2D that are appropriate for 
scaling, such as imported raster images and 2D line shapes. Although it’s not an obvious option, 
the Scale tool can be used in Sketch mode for any type of sketch-based element in a project or 
for solid and void geometry sketches in the Family Editor.
Keep in mind that you are working with a model made out of real-world objects, not abstract 
primitive forms. You cannot scale most elements because it’s not practical or meaningful and 
may cause dangerous errors in scheduling and dimensions. For example, you can’t scale the size 
of a door, wall, or sink because they represent real assemblies and scaling them would mean 
resizing all their components. This would lead to impractical results, such as a sink being dis-
played as a fraction of its actual manufactured size.
Aligning Elements
If you’ve been using Revit software for any amount of time, you have likely discovered the 
power of the Align tool. It can supplant the need to use many of the tools we have already dis-
cussed, such as Move and Rotate. The Align tool lets you line up elements in an efﬁcient way 
that works on almost all types of objects.
With this tool, you explicitly align references from one element to another, regardless of 
the type of either object. For example, you can align windows in a facade so that their centers 
or openings are all in alignment. To use the Align tool, activate it from the Modify tab in the 
ribbon and ﬁrst select the target reference—a reference to which you want to align another 
element. Next, select what you want to align to that reference—the part or side of the element 
whose position needs to be modiﬁed. The second element picked is the one that always moves 
into alignment. This selection sequence is the opposite of the other editing tools we’ve discussed 
so far, so remember, destination ﬁrst, then the element to align.
As soon as you make your second pick and the aligned element is moved, a lock icon 
appears, allowing you to constrain the alignment. If you click the icon, thereby constraining the 
alignment, the alignment is preserved if either element moves. Figure 3.15 illustrates the use 
of the Align tool to align multiple windows in an elevation view using the Multiple Alignment 
option on the Options bar.
The Align tool also works within Filled Region model patterns, such as brick or stone on sur-
faces of model objects. Select a line on an object such as the edge of a wall and then select a line 
in the surface pattern. Use the Tab key if you cannot get surface patterns selected with the ﬁrst 
mouse click. Note that the Align tool will also rotate elements in the process of aligning them to 
objects that are not parallel. This is a real time-saver compared to moving and rotating.

EDITING ELEMENTS INTERACTIVELY | 91
Trimming or Extending Lines and Walls
You can trim and extend lines and walls to one another using the Trim/Extend tools on the 
Modify tab of the ribbon. There are three separate tools in the ribbon: Trim/Extend To Corner, 
Trim/Extend Single Element, and Trim/Extend Multiple Elements. With the Trim/Extend tools, 
you ﬁrst activate the tool and then operate on elements in the model, selecting two lines or walls 
that need to meet in a corner or at a T-intersection.
The Trim/Extend tools are used frequently for editing sketches of ﬂoors and roofs because 
it’s easy to end up with overlapping lines that need to be trimmed to form a closed loop. Keep 
in mind that with the Trim/Extend tools, you are selecting pairs of elements to remain, not to 
remove. Although the Single Element and Multiple Elements tools are similar to the Extend 
command in AutoCAD, the behavior of the Trim/Extend To Corner tool in Revit Architecture is 
more like that of the Chamfer or Fillet command rather than its Trim command.
The Trim/Extend tools for extending a single element or multiple elements function in a 
slightly different way than Trim/Extend To Corner. To extend a wall or line, ﬁrst select a target 
reference; then select the element you want to extend to that target (Figure 3.16). Using the Trim/
Extend Multiple Elements tool, you ﬁrst select the target reference; then each subsequent pick 
extends the selected element to the target reference. You also have the ability to use a selection 
box to trim multiple elements.

You can use the 
Align tool to line up 
edges of windows in 
a facade.

92 | CHAPTER 3 THE BASICS OF THE TOOLBOX
Splitting Lines and Walls
The Split Element tool operates on walls and lines and lets you divide an element into two 
pieces. To cut an element, activate the Split Element tool from the Modify tab in the ribbon and 
place the mouse pointer over the edge of a wall or line. Before you click, you will see a preview 
of the split line. The split line will automatically snap to any adjoining geometry.
The Options bar displays a nice feature called Delete Inner Segment that removes the 
need to use any of the Trim tools after a splitting operation. In the example in Figure 3.17, the 
middle section of a wall needs to be removed so that you end up with a clean set of wall joins. 
Using the Split Element tool with the Delete Inner Segment option checked, you can accom-
plish this with two clicks and get a clean condition without having to return with any of the 
Trim commands.
Using Trim/Extend on Line-Based Components
You can use the Trim/Extend tools on line-based families that are either model or detail compo-
nents. Try this using a line-based detail component for batt insulation or gypsum wallboard. Te 
Trim/Extend tools will help make your detailing process much more eﬃcient and fun!
Figure 3.17

Element tool with the 
Delete Inner Segment 
option checked
Split With Gap
The Split With Gap tool allows you to specify a gap distance and pick a single point on a wall. 
Although the wall is divided into two separate segments, the gap distance is maintained with 
an automatic constraint. To use Split With Gap, follow these steps:
1. Go to the Modify tab, and from the Modify panel, select Split With Gap.
2. Specify the Joint Gap distance in the Options bar. Note that this distance can be set only 
between 1/16″ (1.6 mm) and 1′-0″ (300 mm).
3. Move the mouse pointer over a wall and click to place the gap.
Once you have successfully split a wall with a gap, select the wall and notice the constraints 
(locks) on the gap and between the two parallel wall segments (Figure 3.18). Try to drag either 
of the wall ends separated by the gap, and you will see that the gap distance is maintained. Try 
to move the wall in a direction perpendicular to the wall segments, and you will notice that the 
two wall segments remain aligned.

EDITING ELEMENTS INTERACTIVELY | 93
If you would like to rejoin walls that have been split with a gap, follow these steps:
1. Select a wall that has been split with a deﬁned gap.
2. Click the constraint icon in the gap to unlock the dimension constraint.
3. Select each wall segment and click the Allow Join icon near the end of the wall that was 
split.
4. Select the other wall and repeat step 3.
5. Drag the wall end grip of one wall segment to the end of the other segment. The walls 
should join.
Note that on walls with smaller gaps, the segments may automatically join as soon as you 
select Allow Join; however, rejoined segments may not form a single segment. If you have trou-
ble joining two parallel wall segments into one, try to drag one of the wall ends away from the 
other and release the mouse button; then drag the segment back to the other end.
Oﬀsetting Lines and Walls
Offset is similar to the Move and Copy tools in that it moves and makes a copy of an element 
by offsetting it parallel to an edge you select. You can ﬁnd the Offset tool in the Modify tab 
of the ribbon. You can also specify an offset distance as an option in the Options bar to give 
an offset distance or choose the Graphical option if you want to manually locate the offset 
element.
This tool is especially useful in the Family Editor when you are making shapes that have a 
consistent thickness in proﬁle, such as extruded steel shapes. The Offset tool has a Copy option 
available in the Options bar that determines whether the offsetting operation generates a copy 
of the selected elements or simply moves them.
Remember that you can Tab-select a chain of elements and offset them in one click, as shown 
in Figure 3.19. When the Offset command is active, the dashed line appears on the side of the 
element to which the offset will be created.
Figure 3.18

Gap tool

94 | CHAPTER 3 THE BASICS OF THE TOOLBOX
Preventing Elements from Moving
In some cases, you may want to make sure some elements in the model never move. An example 
of this is when you work on a renovation to an existing building. For obvious reasons, you 
would not want to move existing walls. Other examples include imported drawings, grids, 
levels, and exterior walls. There are two ways to deal with this and lock certain elements, thus 
preventing them from moving.
Pinning Elements
You can restrict an element’s ability to move by pinning it with the Pin tool. Use this tool to 
lock down critical elements that need to remain ﬁxed for long periods of time. As one example, 
this is an important tool to use on imported CAD ﬁles because it is easy to accidentally select 
an import and drag it or move it. This kind of accidental modiﬁcation can lead to coordination 
problems, even in a BIM environment. Use pins to lock down grid lines because you certainly 
do not want to accidentally relocate those either.
This tool is located in the Modify panel of the Modify tab in the ribbon. Select one or more  
elements for which you want to prevent movement, and click the Pin tool. If you try to move  
the element, nothing will happen—you will not even get a preview of a potential move. To unpin 
an element, select it and click the Unpin tool, which is also located in the Modify panel. You can also 
unpin an element by clicking the pin icon that appears near a pinned element when it is selected.
Revit helps you avoid accidentally deleting elements. Instead of permitting the deletion and 
providing a warning, Revit will warn you that the element is pinned and instruct you to unpin 
the element before using Delete. If you select multiple elements (some pinned and some not 
pinned) for deletion, Revit deletes the elements that are not pinned and warns that you must 
unpin the pinned elements before deleting them.
Combining the Pin tool and the selection ﬁlters will allow a BIM coordinator to create a selec-
tion set for pinned items. By loading the selection set, the coordinator can double-check that the 
items are indeed pinned.
Figure 3.19 
Use Oﬀset with 
Tab-select to copy a 
chain of elements.

EDITING ELEMENTS INTERACTIVELY | 95
Constraints
Constraints aren’t as rigid as the Pin tool, but they do allow you to create dimensional rules in 
the model so that elements remain ﬁxed relative to other elements. You can create a constraint 
using dimensions or alignments and then click the lock icon that appears upon creation of a 
dimension or completion of an alignment operation.
A simple example of using constraints is maintaining a ﬁxed distance between a door and a 
side wall. If the wall moves, the door will also move. If you try to move the door, the software 
will not let you move it. Look at Figure 3.20; the door has been constrained to remain 4″ (100 mm) 
from the wall face.
Figure 3.20 
A door constrained 
to a wall can’t be 
moved indepen-
dently of the wall.
Figure 3.21 
Deleting a con-
strained dimension 
generates an alert.
This type of constraint is accomplished by placing a dimension string between the doorjamb 
and the face of the wall and then clicking the lock icon on the dimension. Note that the dimension 
can be deleted while preserving the constraint. If you delete a constrained dimension, an alert will 
appear, giving you the option to unconstrain the elements or simply delete the dimension while 
maintaining the constraint (Figure 3.21). Note that you can determine where constraints were by 
creating new dimensions; constrained relationships will still display with the lock icon.
You can view these relationships when a constrained element is selected. Simply hover the 
mouse pointer near the constraint icon, and you will see the dimension constraint represented 
as a dashed dimension string. Another option to see what is constrained in your model is to use 
the Reveal Constraints tool on the View Control bar. Selecting this will toggle a setting allowing 
you to see what elements are constrained in the model (Figure 3.22).

96 | CHAPTER 3 THE BASICS OF THE TOOLBOX
Exploring Other Editing Tools
Many other editing tools are available, and we will cover them in subsequent chapters when 
they’re used in speciﬁc operations. However, there are a few you should know about now 
because they are generic tools you can put to immediate use on any project.
Using the Join Geometry Tool
Joining walls to ﬂoors and roofs creates clean-looking drawings, and Revit will attempt to create 
these joins automatically; however, in some cases, elements don’t look right until they are explic-
itly joined. This is where the Join Geometry tool comes into play. This tool creates joins between 
ﬂoors, walls, ceilings, roofs, and slabs. A common use for this tool is in building sections, where 
ﬂoors and walls may appear overlapped and not joined. Figure 3.23 shows a ﬂoor intersecting 
with some walls that aren’t joined. Using the Join Geometry tool, you can clean up these condi-
tions nicely.

EXPLORING OTHER EDITING TOOLS | 97
You might notice that some joins—especially in a view set to the Coarse detail level—contain 
a thin dividing line between two elements. This is usually because the two elements you joined 
consist of differing materials. Ensuring consistent material application will give you increased 
graphic quality in your project views.
You should also be aware that joining large host elements to many other elements may 
degrade model performance. One way to avoid this is to apply a black solid ﬁll to elements in 
the cut plane of your coarse view sections and avoid overall manual joining; then selectively 
join for medium and ﬁne views. You can do so easily by selecting the element in question (wall, 
ﬂoor, and so forth) and choosing Edit Type from the Properties palette. By default, the Coarse 
Scale Fill Pattern is set to No Pattern. Set this to Solid Fill; in all your coarse views, your ele-
ments will show as solid black (Figure 3.24).
Using the Split Face and Paint Tools
Occasionally, you may need to apply a thin material to the face of an object without making 
a new type of element. You may also need to divide an overall surface into smaller regions to 
receive different materials. You can use the Paint tool to apply materials and the Split Face tool 
to divide object surfaces. With the Paint tool, you can apply alternative materials to the exterior 
faces of walls, ﬂoors, roofs, and ceilings. This material has no thickness, but you can schedule it 
with a material takeoff schedule and annotate it with a material tag. A typical use case for these 
two tools is the application of a carpet or thin tile to a ﬂoor. See Chapter 14, “Modeling Floors, 
Ceilings, and Roofs,” for a detailed exercise on this topic.

Copying and Pasting from the Clipboard
Copying and pasting is a familiar technique used in almost all software applications, and Revit 
software provides the basic features you would expect (Ctrl+C to copy and Ctrl+V to paste). It 
also has some additional time-saving options that are speciﬁc to working on a 3D model.
To copy any element or group of elements to the Clipboard, select them and press Ctrl+C. 
To paste, press Ctrl+V. In the majority of cases, the software pastes the elements with a dashed 
bounding box around them. You then determine where to place the elements by clicking a point 
to deﬁne its ﬁnal position. In the Options bar, you will ﬁnd a Constrain option that when clicked 
will only let you deﬁne the location of the pasted content orthogonally to the original ele-
ments. With the elements copied to the Clipboard, you’ll also ﬁnd some additional tools on the 
Clipboard panel of the Modify tab.
Edit Pasted
Immediately after you select a point for the location of the pasted content, you will ﬁnd a new 
panel in the ribbon called Edit Pasted (Figure 3.25). You can click Finish to complete the pasting 
action or start another command. If you are unsatisﬁed with the pasting action, select Cancel.
Figure 3.25 
Additional actions 
are available when 
pasting elements.
If you select Edit Pasted Elements, a special mode will be started with the Edit Pasted tools 
appearing at the top left of the drawing area (Figure 3.26). In this mode, only the pasted ele-
ments are editable. You can use the Select All or Filter button to reﬁne those elements within the 
pasted selection. When your edits are completed, click the Finish button.
Figure 3.26 
Edit Pasted mode 
allows additional 
modiﬁcation of 
pasted elements.
Paste Aligned
If you need to paste elements with greater location control, Paste Aligned offers options to make 
the process simple and efﬁcient. These options allow you to quickly duplicate elements from 
one view or one level to another while maintaining a consistent location in the x-coordinate and 
y-coordinate planes. After selecting elements and copying them to the Clipboard, ﬁnd the Paste 
button in the Clipboard panel, as shown in Figure 3.27.

EXPLORING OTHER EDITING TOOLS | 99
Five options, in addition to the Paste From Clipboard option, are available when you click the 
Paste drop-down button. Depending on the view from which you copy and what kinds of ele-
ments you copy, the availability of these options will change. For example, if you select a model 
element in a plan view, you will not have the Aligned To Selected Views option. These options 
are as follows:
Aligned To Selected Levels  This is a mode you can use to quickly paste copied elements to 
many different levels simultaneously. When you select this option, you choose levels from a 
list in a dialog box. This is useful when you have a multistory building design, you want to 
copy a furniture layout that repeats on many ﬂoors, and selecting level graphics in a section 
or elevation would be too tedious.
Aligned To Selected Views  If you want to copy view-speciﬁc elements, such as drafting 
lines, text, or dimensions, this option allows you to paste them by selecting views from a 
list of views in a dialog box. In the list available for selection, you do not see levels listed 
but rather see a list of parallel views. For example, if elements are copied from a plan view, 
all other plan views are listed. Likewise, if you copy from an elevation view, only elevation 
views are listed.
Aligned To Current View  This option pastes the elements from the Clipboard into the 
active view in the same spatial location. For example, if you copy a series of walls in one 
view, switch to another view in the Project Browser, and paste with the Aligned To Current 
View option, the software pastes the walls to the same x-coordinate and y-coordinate loca-
tions in the view you switched to.
Aligned To Same Place  This option places elements from the Clipboard in the exact place 
from which they were copied or cut. One use for this tool is copying elements into a design 
option; see Chapter 11, “Working with Phasing, Groups, and Design Options,” for an expla-
nation of design options.
Aligned To Picked Level  This is a mode you can use to copy and paste elements between 
different ﬂoors by picking a level in a section or elevation. Although you can cut or copy 
elements from a plan view, you must be in an elevation or section to paste using this 
option. You might use this paste option to copy balconies on a facade from one ﬂoor to 
another.

100 | CHAPTER 3 THE BASICS OF THE TOOLBOX
Using the Create Similar Tool
Rather than hunting through a list of families or making copies you’d have to edit later, try 
using the Create Similar tool to add new instances of a selected element to your model.
This tool is available in the Create panel of the Modify tab of the ribbon when an object is 
selected or from the context menu. To use this method, select an existing instance of the same 
type of element you’d like to create, click the Create Similar tool, and you will immediately be 
in a placement or creation mode according to the type of element. For example, if you use Create 
Similar with a ﬂoor selected, you’re taken directly into Sketch mode, where you can start sketch-
ing the boundary for a new ﬂoor.
Using Keyboard Shortcuts (Accelerators)
To increase your productivity even further, you may like to use keyboard shortcuts to speed 
up common commands and minimize interruptions to your workﬂow. When you hover your 
mouse pointer over any tool in the ribbon, the keyboard shortcut is indicated to the right of the 
tool name, as shown here.
You can customize the keyboard shortcuts assigned to all commands. To access this tool, go 
to the View tab in the ribbon, ﬁnd the Windows panel, and select User Interface ➢ Keyboard 
Shortcuts. When the Keyboard Shortcuts dialog box appears (Figure 3.28), you can search for 
commands in the Search box.
Figure 3.28 
Customize keyboard 
shortcuts for 
commonly used Revit 
commands.

SHARING MODELS WITH THE CLOUD | 101
Once you ﬁnd a command to which you’d like to assign a shortcut, select it and type the 
shortcut in the Press New Keys box. Click the Assign button, and you will see the new shortcut 
added to the selected command. Click OK to close the dialog box, and the keyboard shortcuts 
will be ready for immediate use. If you choose to modify the shortcut, understand that no 
two commands can have an identical shortcut. As an example, if you use the shortcut AA for 
Align, you can’t use AA again for the shortcut to another command. Revit will take the one that 
appears ﬁrst in the list and ignore any other entries.
Double-Click to Edit
Revit allows you to double-click families and components to launch the respective editing 
mode. Although this may be the epitome of editing efﬁciency, you also have the ability to 
customize this behavior—even to completely disable it. From the Application menu, click the 
Options button. In the Options dialog box, select the User Interface settings, and then click the 
Customize button next to Double-Click Options. In the Customize Double-Click Settings dialog 
box, you will see the limits to which you can customize the behavior to your liking. Note that 
any of the actions can be set to Do Nothing and some can be set to Edit Type or Edit Element.
Sharing Models with the Cloud
Another tool in your Revit toolkit is A360. This is Autodesk’s cloud platform that allows you to 
visualize models and share content with other team members, regardless of whether they are 
using Revit. A360 is a cloud-based application. You can ﬁnd the site at http://A360.autodesk.com. 
If you have purchased an Autodesk product, you have an account on A360. The default account 
comes with 5GB of storage space as its only limitation. When you visit the site, it will allow you 
to either log in or set up an account if this is your ﬁrst time using A360. The default site works 
best in Google’s Chrome browser and looks like Figure 3.29. There is also a companion Android 
and iPhone/iPad app you can download.

102 | CHAPTER 3 THE BASICS OF THE TOOLBOX
For the sake of familiarizing you with the site and its capabilities, we’re going to set up a new 
project and upload a sample model. To do this, follow these steps:
1. Select the Create Project button on the main page after you’ve signed in.
2. You will be asked to name your project. You can enter anything you want here to deﬁne the 
project name. We’re going to use Mastering Revit Architecture. You can also upload a cus-
tomized image to better customize the project. Choose Create Project when you’re done.
3. The new project will not have any data in it by default. You can upload data either by 
choosing the Upload button or by simply dragging and dropping a ﬁle into the browser 
window. Upload the ﬁle c03-Sample-Building.rvt, which you can ﬁnd on this book’s 
companion website.
Once your ﬁle is uploaded, you will see it shown in the ﬁle list within the project 
(Figure 3.30). On this page as well, you have the ability to invite other people to your project for 
collaboration and view changes in the activity. Note that the ﬁle you uploaded is versioned (this 
one shows as v1) and subsequent uploads are saved on the site. You can roll back to a previous 
version at any time.
With the model uploaded, select it from the ﬁle list. It will open the default 3D view, and 
you’ll be able to navigate the model, pan, zoom, and select elements to get their properties, and 
perform many of the same functionalities you have in Revit, but here you will not be able to edit 
anything. Note that you can use all of these tools without having a copy of Revit installed on 
your computer. Figure 3.31 shows the default 3D view with a wall element selected and its prop-
erty window activated. You also have the ability to mark up and comment on any aspect of the 
model. Using the tools at the bottom of the screen, project team members can leave comments 
about the design or other aspects of the model.
Figure 3.29

A360 site

SHARING MODELS WITH THE CLOUD | 103
As a last tool to explore, select the 3D box icon at the upper-left corner of the site. From this 
expanded menu, you can select and view any of the views that are already deﬁned in the model. 
You can open up sheets, 2D views, and 3D perspectives. If it’s in the model, you have the option 
to view it on A360! Figure 3.32 shows the view of the building section. Note you also have all of 
the web tools available to zoom, select elements, or create markups.

104 | CHAPTER 3 THE BASICS OF THE TOOLBOX
While the A360 site gives you a lot of versatility, you might want to curate the content for 
what is viewable (or not viewable) on the site. Depending on who you’re sharing the content 
with, you might only want them to see views that are in a more ﬁnished state, or you might 
want to exclude design options and other “works in progress.”
Managing the content can be done directly in Revit. Open the same model in Revit and choose 
the Collaborate tab. Here you can select the Publish Settings tool from the Manage Models panel. 
This will open the Publish Settings dialog box and provide you with an entire list of the views 
and sheets that are currently in the model. Here you can assign Sets to the views for further orga-
nization as well as selecting or deselecting the views you want to show in A360 (Figure 3.33).

MODELING SITE CONTEXT | 105
The dialog box even gives you the opportunity to preview the view you’ve selected so you 
can see what it will look like once it is uploaded to A360. Once your changes are made, choose 
Save and Close to save your settings. The next time you upload a model to A360, only the 
selected views will be visible on the site for your larger team.
Modeling Site Context
In the previous sections of this chapter, you learned about the fundamental tools for editing 
and modifying model elements and viewing project ﬁles online. Other tools you should become 
familiar with are the site tools. They allow you to create a context within which your building 
models can be situated. For example, a toposurface will create a hatched area when you view 
your building in a section, and it will function as a hosting surface for site components such as 
trees, shrubs, parking spaces, accessories, and vehicles (Figure 3.34).
Figure 3.34 
A toposurface can host 
components, such as 
trees, people, vehicles, 
and other entourage.
The site tools are intended for use only in the creation of basic elements, including topogra-
phy, property lines, and building pads. Although editing utilities are available to manipulate 
the site elements, these tools are not meant to be used for civil engineering like the functionality 
found in AutoCAD® Civil 3D® application.
In the following sections, you’ll learn about the different ways to create and modify a topo-
surface, how to generate property lines with tags, and how to model a building pad within a 
toposurface.

106 | CHAPTER 3 THE BASICS OF THE TOOLBOX
Using a Toposurface
As its name suggests, a toposurface is a surface-based representation of the topography context 
supporting a project. It is not modeled as a solid; however, a toposurface will appear as if it were 
solid in a 3D view with a section box enabled (Figure 3.35).
Figure 3.35 
A toposurface will 
appear as a solid in 
a 3D view only if a 
section box is used.
You can create a toposurface in one of three ways: by placing points at speciﬁc elevations, by 
using a linked CAD ﬁle with lines or points at varying elevations, or by using a points ﬁle gener-
ated by a civil engineering application. We’ll examine these techniques in the following exercises.
Turning On and Off Tabs
If you don’t see the Massing & Site tab, just navigate to the Application menu and choose Options. 
From there, select the User Interface category. Here you can turn on and oﬀ any of the tabs from 
the ribbon.
Creating a Toposurface by Placing Points
The simplest way to create a toposurface is by placing points in your Revit project at speciﬁc 
elevations. To create a clean outer edge for your toposurface, draw a large rectangle using detail 
lines in your site plan. When you are creating a toposurface by placing points, there are no line-
based geometry tools; however, points can be snapped to the detail lines. The following exercise 
will show you how to create a toposurface by placing points:
1. Begin by opening the ﬁle c03-Site-Tools.rvt or c03-Site-Tools-Metric.rvt, which 
can be downloaded from this book’s companion web page.

MODELING SITE CONTEXT | 107
2. Activate the ﬂoor plan named Site, and you will see a rectangle created from detail lines.
3. Go to the Massing & Site tab, and from the Model Site panel, click Toposurface. Notice in 
the contextual tab in the ribbon that the default tool is Place Point.
4. Notice the Elevation value in the Options bar. Set the value of the points you are  
about to place.
Also note that the elevation values are always related to the Revit Project Base Point. They 
do not relate to the elevation of any shared coordinates.
5. With the Elevation value set to 0′-0″ (0 mm), place a point at each of the left corners of  
the rectangle.
6. Change the Elevation value to 20′-0″ (6000 mm) and then place a point at each of the right 
corners of the rectangle. You will notice the contour lines of the surface begin to appear 
after the third point of the surface is placed.
7. In the contextual tab of the ribbon, click Finish Surface (green check mark) to com-
plete the toposurface. Activate the Default 3D view, and you will see the sloping sur-
face, as shown in Figure 3.36. And keep in mind that this will be a thin surface, not 
a solid. Notice that the 3D view in this project already has the section box property 
enabled. To adjust the section box, activate the Reveal Hidden Elements tool in the 
view control bar.
8. Save the ﬁle for use in a subsequent exercise in this chapter.

108 | CHAPTER 3 THE BASICS OF THE TOOLBOX
Creating a Toposurface from Imported CAD Data
A common workﬂow you may encounter involves the use of CAD data generated by a civil engi-
neer. In this case, the engineer must create a ﬁle with 3D data. Keep in mind that Revit models 
are in real-world units (feet, inches, meters, and so on), so any content you bring into the model 
from other sources, like a Civil engineer, would also need to be modeled in real-world units. 
Blocks, circles, or contour polylines must exist in the CAD ﬁle at the appropriate elevation to be 
used in the process of generating a toposurface in Revit.
In the following exercise, you will download a sample DWG ﬁle with contour polylines. You 
must link the ﬁle into your Revit project before creating the toposurface:
1. Download and open c03-Site-Link.rvt or c03-Site-Link-Metric.rvt from this 
book’s website.
2. Download the ﬁle c03-Site-Link.dwg from this book’s web page.
3. Activate the Site plan in the Project Browser.
4. Go to the Insert tab in the ribbon and click the Link CAD button. Select the c03-Site-
Link.dwg ﬁle and set the following options:
 
◆
Current View Only: Unchecked
 
◆
Import Units: Auto-Detect
 
◆
Positioning: Auto-Center To Center
 
◆
Place At: Level 1
 
◆
Correct Lines That Are Slightly Off Axis: Unchecked
5. Click Open to complete the insertion of the CAD link. Open a Default 3D view to exam-
ine the results (Figure 3.37).

Select only the 
layers contain-
ing 3D contour 
information.
6. From the Massing & Site tab in the ribbon, click the Toposurface button. In the Tools 
panel of the Modify | Edit Surface tab on the ribbon, select Create From Import and then 
Select Import Instance.
7. Pick the linked CAD ﬁle, and the Add Points From Selected Layers dialog box will appear 
(Figure 3.38). Click the Check None button and then select the layers C-TOPO-MAJR and 
C-TOPO-MINR.
8. Click OK to close the dialog box. It may take a few seconds to generate the points based 
on the contour polylines in the linked ﬁle, but they will appear as black squares when 
they have all been placed.
9. If you would like to use fewer points to deﬁne the toposurface, click the Simplify Surface 
button in the contextual ribbon and enter a larger value, such as 1′-0″ (300 mm).
10. Click the Finish Surface button in the contextual ribbon tab to complete the toposurface. 
Change the visual style of the view to Consistent Colors to examine your results.
Creating a Toposurface from a Points File
A less-common method for creating a toposurface, although equally effective when using 
linked CAD data, is using a points ﬁle. A points ﬁle is a text ﬁle that is usually generated from 
a civil engineering program. It must be a comma-delimited ﬁle (TXT or CSV format) in which 
the x-, y-, and z-coordinates of the points are the ﬁrst numeric values in the ﬁle. In the following 
exercise, we have provided a sample points ﬁle that was exported from AutoCAD Civil 3D using 
the XYZ_LIDAR Classiﬁcation (comma-delimited) format setting:
1. Open the ﬁle c03-Site-Points-Start.rvt, which can be downloaded from this book’s 
web page.
2. Download the ﬁle c03-Points.csv from this book’s web page to your local computer.

110 | CHAPTER 3 THE BASICS OF THE TOOLBOX
3. Activate the Site plan in the Project Browser.
4. From the Massing & Site tab on the ribbon, click the Toposurface button. In the Tools 
panel of the Modify | Edit Surface tab, select Create From Import and then choose 
Specify Points File.
5. Navigate to the c03-Points.csv ﬁle and click Open. Note that if you were using a TXT 
format ﬁle, you would change the Files Of Type option to Comma Delimited Text.
6. In the Format dialog box, select Decimal Feet. It is important to understand the units of 
the values in the points ﬁle to ensure that the toposurface will be created at the correct 
scale. Click OK to close the dialog box.
7. Click the Finish Surface button in the contextual ribbon to complete the toposurface. 
Open the Default 3D view to examine your results. You may have to use the Zoom To Fit 
command to see the extent of the new toposurface.
Modifying the Surface with Subregion
The points ﬁle example in the previous exercise represents a section of terrain across Lake 
Mead, Nevada. If you wanted to deﬁne an area of the toposurface with a different material but 
not change the geometry of the overall surface, you would use the Subregion tool. In the follow-
ing exercise, you will use this tool to create a region that will represent the water of the lake:
1. Download and open the ﬁle c03-Site-Lake.rvt from this book’s website and then acti-
vate the Site plan from the Project Browser. In this view, there are dashed detail lines that 
represent the edge of the water.
2. Go to the Massing & Site tab in the ribbon and click the Subregion tool.
3. Switch to Pick Lines mode in the Draw panel of the contextual ribbon.
4. Hover your mouse pointer over one of the dashed detail lines on the left side of the sur-
face, Tab-select the chain of lines, and then click to select them. You will see a purple 
sketch line appear.
5. Repeat step 4 for the dashed detail lines at the right side of the surface.
6. Switch to Line mode in the Draw panel of the contextual ribbon and draw a line connect-
ing each open end of the water edge lines, as shown in Figure 3.39.
7. Click Finish Edit Mode in the contextual ribbon to complete the subregion.
8. Activate the Default 3D view and select the subregion you created in the previous steps.
9. In the Properties palette, select the Material parameter, and click the ellipsis button to 
open the Material Browser dialog box. Locate and select the material named Site - Water. 
Note that you can easily ﬁnd this material by typing Water in the search ﬁeld at the top of 
the dialog box.
10. Click OK to close the Material Browser dialog box; you will see the results in the 3D view, 
as shown in Figure 3.40.

MODELING SITE CONTEXT | 111
When you use the Subregion tool, the geometry of the original surface remains unchanged. If 
you no longer need the subregion, you can select it and delete it. Be aware that topographic sur-
faces cannot display surface patterns assigned to materials.

ization purposes.

112 | CHAPTER 3 THE BASICS OF THE TOOLBOX
Using the Split Surface Tool
If you need to divide a topographic surface into separate parts for the purpose of editing the 
geometry, you can use the Split Surface tool. With this tool, you can sketch a single line along 
which the surface will be divided into two editable entities. These separate entities can be 
recombined later using the Merge Surfaces tool. In the following exercise, you will split a topo-
graphic surface and edit some of the points. Remember that you can also use Split Surface to 
delete a portion of a topographic surface. Here are the steps:
1. Open the ﬁle c03-Site-Tools.rvt or c03-Site-Tools-Metric.rvt you saved in the 
“Creating a Toposurface by Placing Points” exercise.
2. Activate the Site plan in the Project Browser.
3. Go to the Massing & Site tab in the ribbon and click the Split Surface tool. Remember that 
you should use the Subregion tool if you plan to assign a different material only to the 
split region of the original surface.
4. Select the topographic surface and you will enter Sketch mode. Using the Line mode in 
the Draw panel of the contextual ribbon, draw two lines that overlap the edges of the sur-
face, as shown in Figure 3.41.
Figure 3.41 
Sketch lines that 
overlap the edge 
of the topographic 
surface.
5. Click Finish Edit Mode in the ribbon, and you will see the split surface highlighted 
in blue.
6. Activate the Default 3D view from the Quick Access toolbar or from the View tab.
7. Turn off the Section Box option in the Properties palette.
8. Select the split surface, and click the Edit Surface tool in the Modify | Topography tab of 
the ribbon.
9. Select the point at the outer corner of the topographic surface, and change the Elevation 
value in the Options bar from 20′-0″ (6000 mm) to 10′-0″ (3000 mm).
10. Click the green check (Finish Edit Mode) in the contextual ribbon, and you will see the 
result shown in Figure 3.42.

MODELING SITE CONTEXT | 113
11. To illustrate the difference between a split surface and other topographic surface edits, 
select the main surface and click Edit Surface in the contextual ribbon. Select the point at 
the upper corner opposite from the split region and change the Elevation value to 10′-0″ 
(3000 mm). Notice the difference in how the surface slope is interpolated between the 
other points on the surface (Figure 3.43).

Creating a Building Pad
A building pad in Revit terminology is a unique model element that resembles a ﬂoor with a 
grade underneath it. It can have a thickness and compound structure, it is associated with a 
level, and it can be sloped using slope arrows while you’re sketching its boundary. The building 
pad is different from a ﬂoor because it will automatically cut through a toposurface, deﬁning the 
outline for your building’s lowest level or basement.

114 | CHAPTER 3 THE BASICS OF THE TOOLBOX
The process of creating a building pad is virtually identical to that of creating a ﬂoor. Let’s 
run through a quick exercise to create a building pad in a sample project:
1. Open the ﬁle c03-Site-Pad.rvt, which can be downloaded from this book’s web page.
2. Activate the ﬂoor plan named Site in the Project Browser. You will see an existing topo-
graphic surface and property line. Notice that reference planes were created to demarcate 
the required zoning setbacks from the property line. Foundation walls have been created 
within these reference planes.
Note that you don’t have to create a property line and walls before creating a building 
pad. You might create a building pad before any other building elements. Just realize that 
you can use the Pick Walls mode to associate the boundary of the building pad with the 
foundation walls.
3. Activate the Basement ﬂoor plan from the Project Browser.
4. Go to the Massing & Site tab in the ribbon, and click the Building Pad button. In the 
Properties palette, change the Height Offset From Level value to 0.
5. Switch to Pick Walls mode in the Draw panel of the contextual ribbon and then pick the 
inside edges of the four foundation walls. You can use the Tab-select method to place all 
four lines at once.
6. Click the Finish Edit Mode button in the contextual ribbon to complete the sketch and 
then double-click the section head in the plan view to examine your results. Notice that 
the top of the building pad is at the Basement level, and the poché of the topographic sur-
face has been removed in the space of the basement (Figure 3.44).
If you are working on a project that has a complex site condition that might require sev-
eral building pads at different elevations, you should be aware that the pads cannot overlap; 
Figure 3.44 
Tis section view 
illustrates how 
the building pad 
adjusts the extents 
of the topographic 
surface.

MODELING SITE CONTEXT | 115
Adjusting the Section Poché for Topographic Surfaces
If you would like to customize the settings for the ﬁll pattern and depth of the poché, click the 
dialog launcher at the bottom of the Model Site panel in the Massing & Site tab of the ribbon. Tis 
will open the Site Settings dialog box, shown here.
As you can see in this dialog box, you can change the Section Cut Material and the Elevation Of 
Poche Base settings. Note that the elevation value is in relation to the Project Base Point. You can 
also adjust the display format of contour lines shown on topographic surfaces, as well as the units 
displayed by property lines.
Generating Property Lines
Property lines are used to delineate the boundary of the lot within which your building will be 
constructed. These special types of lines are different from simple model lines or detail lines 
because they can be tagged with standard property line labels that will display segment lengths 
along with bearings. The property line object can also report its area in a special tag.
however, they can share common boundary edges. To help avoid this situation before you get 
too involved in modeling any of the pads in your project, try using detail lines in your site plan 
to lay out the pad design ﬁrst.

116 | CHAPTER 3 THE BASICS OF THE TOOLBOX
You can create a property line in one of two ways: by sketching lines or by entering distances 
and bearings in a table. In the following exercise, you will create a simple property line by 
sketching and converting the sketched property line into a table of distances and bearings for 
comparison:
1. Open c03-Site-Prop-Lines.rvt or c03-Site-Prop-Lines-Metric.rvt, which you 
can download from this book’s companion web page. Activate the Site plan view in the 
Project Browser.
2. Go to the Massing & Site tab and click the Property Line button. When prompted by the 
Create Property Line dialog box, choose Create By Sketching.
3. Switch to the Rectangle tool in the Draw panel of the contextual ribbon and draw a rect-
angle measuring 120′ × 70′ (36 m × 21 m).
4. Click the Finish Edit Mode button in the contextual ribbon to complete the sketch.
5. With the property line still selected, click the Edit Table button in the Modify | Property 
Lines tab of the ribbon. You will be prompted with a warning that you cannot return to 
Sketch mode once the property line has been converted to a table of distances and bear-
ings. Click Yes to continue.
You will now see each vertex of the property line expressed as a distance and a bearing, 
as shown in Figure 3.45.

Tagging Property Lines with Area
In standard construction documentation, it is customary to annotate each vertex of a property 
line with its distance and bearing. There are two different types of tags you can use to annotate 
property lines. In the following exercise, you will load these two types from the Revit default 
library and tag each segment of the property line, as well as display the area contained within it:
1. Go to the Insert tab of the ribbon and click the Load Family button. Navigate to the Revit 
default library; double-click the Annotations folder and then the Civil folder.
2. Locate the following ﬁles and select them both by pressing the Ctrl key (the equivalent 
metric library families are shown in parentheses):
 
◆
Property Line Tag.rfa (M_Property Line Tag.rfa)
 
◆
Property Tag - SF.rfa (M_Property Tag.rfa)
3. Click Open to load both families.
4. Go to the Annotate tab of the ribbon, click Tag By Category, and then deselect the Leader 
option in the Options bar.
5. Click each segment of the property line to place the tags indicating the distance and bear-
ing, as shown in Figure 3.46.
Figure 3.46 
Tags are applied to 
display the distance 
and bearing of each 
segment of the prop-
erty line.
Now that you have tagged the individual vertices of the property line, it is time to display the 
area within the property line. This process is not the same as applying an area tag because an 
area object doesn’t exist for the property line. Instead, the annotation family Property Tag - 
SF.rfa (M_Property Tag.rfa) is designed to apply to the property lines when all its segments 
are selected.

118 | CHAPTER 3 THE BASICS OF THE TOOLBOX
You can try this with the property line you created earlier. Go back to the Annotate tab in the 
ribbon and click Tag By Category. Instead of picking a single vertex of the property line, hover 
your mouse pointer over one segment and use Tab-select to highlight the entire chain of prop-
erty line segments. Click to place the property area tag. Click the question mark above the area 
to change the name of the property line, as shown in Figure 3.47.
Figure 3.47 
Use Tab-select to 
place a property area 
tag for all segments.
Cut/Fill Schedules
As we mentioned earlier, Revit site tools are not meant to replace civil engineering software 
programs. We have shown you how to create a topographical surface in a variety of ways as well 
as some methods of modifying these objects. There is also a way to quickly quantify how much 
earth is displaced by proposed changes to existing topography. This is commonly referred to as 
a cut/ﬁll schedule.
One easy way to demonstrate the use of a cut/ﬁll schedule is through the creation of a build-
ing pad that automatically modiﬁes the topographic surface. Let’s go through a quick exercise to 
examine this process:
1. Open the ﬁle c03-Site-Cut-Fill.rvt, which can be downloaded from this book’s  
web page.
In this ﬁle, open a Default 3D view, select the toposurface, and you will notice that the 
topographic surface has been assigned to the Existing phase in the Properties palette.
2. From the View tab in the ribbon, click Schedules and then select Schedule/Quantities to 
open the New Schedule dialog box.
3. From the Category list, choose Topography, set Phase to New Construction, and then 
click OK.

MODELING SITE CONTEXT | 119
4. In the Fields tab of the Schedule Properties dialog box, choose Name, Projected Area, Net 
Cut/Fill, Phase Created, and Phase Demolished, clicking Add after each one. Click OK to 
close the dialog box.
5. While you are still in the working view of the schedule, go to the Properties palette and 
set the Phase Filter value of the schedule to Show Previous + New. This will allow only 
the modiﬁed toposurfaces affected by the Graded Region command to appear in the 
schedule. The complete existing topography will not be listed in the schedule.
6. Activate the Basement plan from the Project Browser, and create a building pad in the 
same way you created one earlier in this section.
After you complete the creation of the building pad and the topographic surface is modi-
ﬁed, notice that the Net Cut/Fill values in the topography schedule still have a value of 0. 
This is because the Graded Region tool must be used on a surface to generate the differ-
ences required to calculate what volume must be cut versus ﬁlled in the proposed design.
7. Tile the open Revit windows so you can see both the Default 3D view and the topography 
schedule.
8. On the Massing & Site tab, click the Graded Region tool, and you will see a dialog box 
appear with two options to continue the command. Choose the option Create A New 
Toposurface Exactly Like The Existing One. This option creates overlapping existing and 
proposed surfaces, which will allow the software to schedule the differences between the 
two as cut or ﬁll volumes.
9. Select the existing toposurface, and you will see the volume values in the topography 
schedule update to reﬂect how the excavation for the building pad affected the overall 
soil. Note that this type of calculation does not account for various construction methods, 
such as backﬁlling.
10. Click the Finish Surface icon in the contextual tab of the ribbon to complete the Graded 
Region command.
Activate the Section 1 view to see the building pad more clearly. Try selecting the building 
pad and changing the Height Offset From Level value in the Properties palette. Observe how 
the Net Cut/Fill values change as the pad deﬁnes the scope of excavation for the foundation.
You can also make the topography schedule easier to read by assigning descriptive information 
to each topographic surface. Select the surface and enter a value in the Name ﬁeld in the Properties 
palette. Change the name of the main surface to Existing Grade and then locate the surface where 
the building pad is. Change its name to Pad Area and observe the topography schedule once again.
Selecting Toposurfaces with the Filter Command
If you have trouble selecting the toposurfaces, you can select the objects in the drawing window 
with a crossing window and use the Filter command to select each toposurface.
If you would like to explore the completed project ﬁle for this exercise, you can download  
c03-Site-Cut-Fill-FINISHED.rvt from this book’s companion web page.

 Conﬁ guring Templates 
and Standards   
 In this chapter we discuss how to conﬁ gure and manage standards through the development 
and use of a project template. Such templates can be rich with information that goes beyond the 
out-of-the-box content that Autodesk provides. We will present proven methods for establishing 
template settings and content, as well as explain how the reuse of work will increase productiv-
ity with each successive project. 
 In this chapter, you’ll learn to 
 
◆
 Deﬁ ne settings for graphic quality and consistency 
 
◆
 Organize views for maximum efﬁ ciency 
 
◆
Create custom annotation families 
 
◆
 Start a project with a custom template 
 
◆
Develop a template management strategy 
 Introducing Project Templates 
 Like many other applications, the Autodesk ® Revit ® application allows you to start with a basic 
template and then evolve your own custom templates to suit speciﬁ c needs. As your knowl-
edge of the software progresses, you will begin to create new and reusable content such as wall 
types, roof types, ceilings, stairs, tags, and other families to meet your design and documenta-
tion needs. This is also the case with regard to the graphical language that you or your ﬁ rm has 
established and needs to implement within Revit. For instance, how you graphically present 
elements such as text, dimensions, annotations, keynotes, and hatch patterns to deﬁ ne your 
graphic style of design documentation. In reality, the architectural profession tends to develop 
stylized graphics to convey design intent, and Revit respects this by enabling the customization 
of almost all aspects of the project template. 
 You can conﬁ gure project templates by one or more of the following methods: 
 
◆
 Predeﬁ ning all project graphic and annotation requirements 
 
◆
 Preloading the model with annotation families and styles 
 
◆
Deﬁ ning standard system families

122 | CHAPTER 4 CONFIGURING TEMPLATES AND STANDARDS  
We will explain these methods in greater detail throughout this chapter. For now, know 
that you can save the completed settings as a new project template (with the ﬁlename extension 
.rte) and use this template whenever you start a new project. You can create templates by using 
a completely blank project, by saving an existing project as a template, or by using one of the 
default templates provided with the Revit installation.
To start from scratch, click the Application menu and choose New ➢ Project. In the New 
Project dialog box, shown in Figure 4.1, choose None for the Template File option, and 
choose Project Template for the Create New option. Once you click OK, you will be asked 
to choose a default unit of measurement—imperial or metric. This dialog box also appears 
when you press Ctrl+N or click New in the Recent Files window.
Figure 4.1 
Starting a new project 
template from scratch
Starting a new project template without a base template requires you to develop all common 
content such as levels, grids, sections, callouts, tags, and model elements. Before you start load-
ing all new graphic content, do a review comparing your requirements to the default symbol-
ogy. Determine whether you can use or modify existing families before you begin creating new 
ones to load into your new template. If you have only custom graphics and system families, 
this approach would be appropriate; however, if much of your graphic style is similar to the 
defaults, we suggest you start with one of the default templates and edit it as necessary. This is 
also a much faster approach to get you up and running. You can ﬁnd these templates by clicking 
Browse in the Template File area of the New Project dialog box. By default, the template ﬁles are 
installed in the root folder of the templates directory: C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\RVT 2018\
Templates.
Customizing Project Settings for Graphic Quality
One of the most common complaints from teams implementing Revit software on their ﬁrst 
projects is poor graphic quality of printed documents. When you ﬁrst install the software, only 
some default settings are deﬁned to approximate a standard graphic appearance of architec-
tural drawings. For example, walls cut in sections are thicker than those shown in projected 
views, and callout boundaries are dashed; however, almost all annotation categories are set 
to a line weight of 1. Fortunately, you can easily overcome these problems with some basic 
conﬁguration.

CUSTOMIZING PROJECT SETTINGS FOR GRAPHIC QUALITY | 123
Figure 4.2 
Te Object Styles 
dialog box gives you 
graphic control of all 
Revit categories and 
their subcategories.
Discovering Object Styles
The primary means of controlling graphic consistency throughout a project is through  
object styles. To access these settings, select the Manage tab and choose Object Styles from the 
Settings panel. As shown in Figure 4.2, the dialog box is divided into four tabs: Model Objects, 
Annotation Objects, Analytical Model Objects, and Imported Objects. Settings for Line Weight, 
Line Color, Line Pattern, and Material are established for each category.
Model Objects  The Category column on the Model Objects tab lists all available catego-
ries and subcategories of model elements. It is important to note that the subcategories for 
model and annotation objects are created in families, which are loaded into the project 
or template. This will be discussed in greater detail in Chapter 15, “Designing with the 
Family Editor.”
The next two columns, under Line Weight, deﬁne the line weight used when the elements are 
displayed in projection or cut view. You use a projection view when you are looking at the 
object from a distance; you use a cut view when your view plane is intersecting the element 
as in a section. In some categories, the Cut setting is unavailable; these element categories 
will never be cut in plan or section views, regardless of the location of the view’s cut plane. 
For categories that enable cut display, you can set element geometry in the Family Editor to 
follow that rule or not, as shown in Figure 4.3.

124 | CHAPTER 4 CONFIGURING TEMPLATES AND STANDARDS  
Figure 4.3 
Customizing the cut 
display of geometry 
in a family
Line Color and Line Pattern allow you to customize the display properties of each category 
and subcategory, but remember that printing a Revit view is WYSIWYG (what you see is 
what you get)—colors will print as colors unless you override them to print as grayscale or 
black in the Print Setup dialog box. The last column, Material, allows you to deﬁne a default 
material to be associated with the category or subcategory in case family components in that 
category don’t have materials explicitly deﬁned. If a family has materials set to By Category, 
it references the material deﬁned in the corresponding object style within the project 
environment.
Annotation Objects  The Annotation Objects tab is similar to the Model Objects tab 
except there are no material deﬁnitions. There is also only one column for line weight 
(Projection) because lines do not have three-dimensional properties like model objects and 
cannot be “cut.”
Analytical Model Objects  This tab allows you to color the various physical conditions in 
the building that correspond to the building’s structural components. Analytical settings 
apply only to structural and MEP analysis tools within Revit and are beyond the scope of 
this book.
Imported Objects  You can control the graphic appearance of layers (DWG) and levels (DGN)  
within linked or imported CAD ﬁles throughout the project on the Imported Objects tab 
of the Object Styles dialog box; however, we will cover this in greater detail in Chapter 7, 
“Interoperability: Working Multiplatform.”
Assigning Line Weight 1
You may want to avoid assigning a line weight of 1 to objects because this is the weight used by 
most ﬁll patterns. Reserving its use will help object proﬁles stand out compared to their patterns.

CUSTOMIZING PROJECT SETTINGS FOR GRAPHIC QUALITY | 125
Using Line Settings
You can use lines in a variety of ways. Some lines relate to obvious tools, such as detail lines and 
model lines, whereas you can place others with ﬁlled regions and by using the Linework tool. 
Lines also relate to the graphic representation of model and annotation elements, as previously 
discussed. Achieving the desired graphic quality requires a review of line weights, patterns, 
and styles.
Setting Line Weights
To open the line weight settings, click the Manage tab and choose Additional Settings ➢ Line 
Weights. The dialog box shown in Figure 4.4 manages the printed line weights relative to a 
numbered assignment from 1 to 16. For model objects, heavier line weights vary between view 
scales. If you require more granular control between scales, click the Add button to insert 
another scale value column and edit the line weights as required. In the Perspective Line 
Weights and Annotation Line Weights tabs there is only one column to specify line weights. 
This is because annotation is always displayed at 1:1 scale and perspective views are not deﬁned 
at any measurable scale.
Figure 4.4 
Model line weights 
vary depending on the 
view scale.
We recommend that you ﬁrst customize the graphic appearance of model and annotation ele-
ments with object styles before trying to manipulate any of the information in the Line Weights 
dialog box. You should attempt to reﬁne the line weight settings only with a rigorous investi-
gation of printed views in multiple scales, because changes in one area can have an impact on 
several others.

126 | CHAPTER 4 CONFIGURING TEMPLATES AND STANDARDS  
Setting Line Patterns
Line patterns are created from a repetitive series of dashes, spaces, and dots. To edit or create 
line patterns, switch to the Manage tab and choose Additional Settings ➢ Line Patterns. The Line 
Patterns dialog box, shown in Figure 4.5, displays a list of existing line patterns in the project.
Figure 4.6 
Line patterns consist 
of dashes, spaces,  
and dots.
Using Caution When Deleting Line Patterns
Before deleting a line pattern, you must verify that it hasn’t been used anywhere in your project 
because Revit does not have any method for purging unused line patterns. You can do so only by 
manually checking Object Styles, Line Styles, and Visibility/Graphic Overrides. If you fail to do so, 
all line styles using the deleted pattern will be assigned as Solid.
Figure 4.5 
Tis dialog box dis-
plays all line patterns 
in the project.
To edit an existing pattern, select a pattern from the list and then click the Edit button. Click New 
to create your own patterns. You create and edit patterns by specifying dash and space lengths, which 
will form a repeating sequence, as shown in Figure 4.6. For dots, a length value is not required.

CUSTOMIZING PROJECT SETTINGS FOR GRAPHIC QUALITY | 127
Frequently, a line pattern is required to include a symbol or text for elements such as fence 
lines, piping, or underground utilities. In Autodesk® AutoCAD® software, shape deﬁnitions can 
be used within linetype deﬁnitions to achieve the desired results. In Revit, these special lines 
can be created as line-based detail components. You can ﬁnd samples of this type of custom line 
by downloading the ﬁle c04-Lines.rvt or c04-Lines-Metric.rvt from this book’s companion 
web page at www.sybex.com/go/masteringrevit2018.
Creating a New Line Pattern
Follow these steps to create a new simple line pattern:
1. Switch to the Manage tab and choose Additional Settings ➢ Line Patterns.
2. In the Line Pattern dialog box, click New.
3. In the Name ﬁeld, type MARA Pattern.
4. Deﬁne the sequence, as shown in the following image.
Any dash or dot must be followed by a space, and all dashes and spaces must have a 
deﬁned length.
  
5. Conﬁrm by clicking OK.
6. The resulting line pattern looks like this:
Setting Line Styles
Now that we have discussed the basic components of lines (weight and pattern), the two are 
combined with a color to create line styles for use in detail lines, model lines, ﬁlled regions, and 

128 | CHAPTER 4 CONFIGURING TEMPLATES AND STANDARDS  
Figure 4.7 
Line styles consist 
of weight, color, and 
pattern.
Using Caution When Deleting Line Styles
If you delete a line style used in a project, any elements using the deleted style will be unable to 
reference that style anymore. Te lines assigned to the deleted style will be reassigned to a common 
style such as Tin Lines—possibly producing undesirable results.
masking regions. They are also available when the Linework tool is used to override a part of a 
model element. To open the Line Styles dialog box (shown in Figure 4.7), switch to the Manage 
tab and choose Additional Settings ➢ Line Styles. Note that you may need to expand the list of 
line styles by clicking the plus sign next to Lines.
In the Line Styles dialog box, notice that some of the style names are bracketed—for example, 
<Hidden>. These are internal, “system” types of lines that cannot be renamed or deleted; how-
ever, their weight, color, and pattern can be modiﬁed.
Establishing the best styles for your templates will be completely up to you, but we will offer 
some proven examples for inspiration. First, realize that the application already uses common 
line styles such as Thin Lines, Medium Lines, and Wide Lines. If you are creating a complete 
array of customized line styles for your colleagues to use, rename the out-of-the-box styles to ﬁt 
into your graphic standard.
One common approach is to create line styles organized by their weight number along with 
any variable to their appearance, such as (3) Gray Dashed or +Line 01. The parentheses (or the 
use of any special characters at the beginning of the line’s name) keep your custom line styles 
sorted to the top of the list in the Line Styles dialog box as well as in the Type Selector when 

CUSTOMIZING PROJECT SETTINGS FOR GRAPHIC QUALITY | 129
you’re using a line-based tool. This approach has proven to be effective and efﬁcient when creat-
ing details in drafting views or generating ﬁll or masking regions.
Another approach reserves certain line styles for special circumstances where lines rep-
resent aspects of a building in a plan, elevation, or section and must be assigned to a speciﬁc 
layer when views are exported in CAD format. For example, the crossing lines typically used 
to indicate an area-in plan that is “open to below” may need to be assigned to the CAD layer 
A-FLOR-BELW. This is difﬁcult if you used a line style based solely on weight and pattern 
such as (2) Dashed. You cannot separately assign that line style to A-FLOR-BELW for the ﬂoor 
plan export and A-DETL-THIN for all other exports. Here are some examples of line styles you 
could create:
 
◆
Open to Below
 
◆
ADA Circles
 
◆
Curbs
 
◆
Fire Rating
In summary, take care to understand the different settings when you are beginning to custom-
ize graphic settings for lines in the Revit template. To change the displayed weight of an element 
in a project, you should make changes not in Line Weights but rather through the Object Styles 
dialog box. For example, if you want to increase the cut line weight of a wall already set to (5),  
do not increase the value of (5) in the Line Weights dialog box. You would change this value by 
selecting (6) or (7) as the cut weight of a wall in the Object Styles dialog box.
Deﬁning Materials
Deﬁning materials in your project template is another important task that can help maintain 
graphic consistency in many other areas. Materials drive the graphic representation of elements, 
not just in a rendered view but also in hidden line views that are 2D or 3D. They are also respon-
sible for cleanups between model elements because materials can merge with one another when 
elements of the same material are joined. In Figure 4.8, the surface patterns and colors are all 
derived from the material assigned to each element.

patterns, color, and

Figure 4.9 
Manage material 
properties using the 
Material Browser.
Materials in Revit are organized into groups of properties called assets, consisting of the fol-
lowing: Identity, Graphics, Appearance, Physical, and Thermal. Let’s explore these by opening 
the Material Browser. Switch to the Manage tab and choose Materials on the Settings panel to 
open the Material Browser (Figure 4.9). The left side of the dialog box shows the materials that 
exist in the active project, including a search bar to help you quickly ﬁnd materials for edit-
ing. Click the icon just below the search bar to show or hide the Library Panel. On the right, the 
selected material’s assets are displayed as tabs.
Material Properties
Select any material in the Project Materials list and we’ll step through each of the asset tabs.
Identity  Deﬁnes schedule values and keynotes for materials. Specifying correct identity 
data for your standard or typical materials will increase efﬁciency when you’re using annota-
tion such as material tags as well as facilitate quality management by aligning model data 
such as manufacturer, model, and mark with your project speciﬁcations. In Figure 4.10, we’ve 
entered some sample identity data. The use of material identity data in project annotation is 
also discussed in Chapter 19, “Annotating Your Design.”

CUSTOMIZING PROJECT SETTINGS FOR GRAPHIC QUALITY | 131
Figure 4.10 
Use identity data to 
classify, ﬁnd, tag, and 
schedule materials.
Graphics  Deﬁnes shading color, surface patterns, and cut patterns. These properties will 
determine how a model element displays in nonrendered views (Hidden Line, Shaded, or 
Consistent Colors).
Shading  Deﬁnes the color and transparency of a material. Note that the color can be 
dependent on the material’s render appearance. If the Use Render Appearance option is 
selected, the color and transparency are adopted from the Appearance asset settings and 
the shading controls will be disabled.
Surface Pattern  Allows the selection of a model pattern to be displayed on the faces of 
elements in elevation, plan, and 3D views. Note that a material’s surface pattern does not 
appear in rendered views; a pattern can be deﬁned in the Appearance asset tab.
Cut Pattern  Allows the selection of a drafting pattern to be displayed when an element is cut 
in a model view. Some elements can’t be cut, as discussed previously in this chapter; in these 
cases, this setting has no effect on the graphic display, and the pattern will not display.

132 | CHAPTER 4 CONFIGURING TEMPLATES AND STANDARDS  
Appearance  Deﬁnes rendering attributes for use in Realistic and Ray Trace display modes 
as well as renderings. These properties will become visible only when you render a view 
and will not affect other graphic display styles, unless the Use Render Appearance option is 
selected in the Graphics asset under Shading.
Identity, Graphics, and Appearance are the three assets that are required for every material 
in Revit. You can add Physical and Thermal assets for analysis, if necessary.
Physical  Deﬁnes physical properties of a material for analysis.

CUSTOMIZING PROJECT SETTINGS FOR GRAPHIC QUALITY | 133
Thermal  Deﬁnes thermal properties of a material for analysis.
Adding and Replacing Material Assets
You can also replace an asset for Appearance, Physical, or Thermal properties with one from any 
asset library. Let’s review the process to add a new asset to a material. To complete the following 
exercises, download and open c04-Materials.rvt from this book’s web page.
1. On the Manage tab, select the Materials tool to open the Materials Browser. Select the 
material Concrete - Cast-In-Place Concrete from the Project Materials list.
2. Click the plus button in the tabbed list of assets and then select Physical.
3. The Asset Browser dialog box will open (Figure 4.11). In the asset selection tree at the left, 
expand the Autodesk Physical Assets tree and navigate to Concrete and then Standard. 
Find the asset named Concrete 3.5 ksi, and with the mouse pointer hovered over the 
asset, click the arrow located at the right end of the asset listing.
4. Click the X to close the Asset Browser and return to the Material Browser.

134 | CHAPTER 4 CONFIGURING TEMPLATES AND STANDARDS  
Figure 4.11 
Use the Asset 
Browser to access 
material assets in 
the document or a 
material library.
You will see a new Physical Asset tab next to the Appearance tab.
You cannot change any of the asset properties in the Autodesk Physical Assets library; how-
ever, after an asset has been assigned to a project, you can change the values. Let’s experiment 
with this process in a quick exercise. Remember that altering any physical or thermal assets may 
produce undesirable results in analysis or simulation.
1. Continuing from the previous exercise, make sure the Material Browser is open and the 
Concrete - Cast-In-Place Concrete material is selected. Select the Physical Asset tab.
2. Click the Duplicate This Asset icon at the top of the tab.
It should change the name of the asset to Concrete 3.5 ksi(1). To change the name of an 
asset, expand the Information drop-down menu and click in the Name ﬁeld. Change the 
name to Concrete 3.5 ksi (Custom).

CUSTOMIZING PROJECT SETTINGS FOR GRAPHIC QUALITY | 135
3. Change the Source ﬁeld to your name and then expand the Concrete drop-down menu. 
Change the Shear Strength Modiﬁcation to 1.75.
4. Return to the Project Materials list and select Cast-In-Place.
You will now add the customized physical asset to this project material.
5. Click the plus button in the tabbed list of assets and select Physical.
6. In the Asset Browser, scroll to the top of the list of assets and select Document Assets. 
From this list, you will ﬁnd Concrete 3.5 ksi (Custom). Hover the mouse pointer over this 
asset and click the arrow at the end of the row to add it to the selected material. This will 
update the material properties.
Another way you can quickly change assets is by using the Replace Asset command. Instead of 
manually changing each asset property, simply select a material in the Material Browser, and in one of 
the asset tabs, click the Replace Asset icon. Let’s explore this functionality with another quick exercise.
1. With the Material Browser still open, select the material named Concrete - Precast 
Concrete and then select the Appearance tab.
2. Click the Replace This Asset icon in the Appearance tab.
3. In the Asset Browser, navigate to the Appearance Library folder and then click Concrete.
Notice that the list of assets is automatically ﬁltered to show only those assets with the 
Aspect ﬁeld speciﬁed as Appearance.
4. Select the Smooth Precast Structural asset and double-click it, or click the replace arrow 
at the end of the row, as shown in Figure 4.12.
5. Click the X to close the Asset Browser and then click OK to close the Material Browser.

136 | CHAPTER 4 CONFIGURING TEMPLATES AND STANDARDS  
Planning Material Strategies
It may seem impossible to imagine all the materials you will need in a project, which may 
make the process of building a template seem daunting. Think of the basic materials you’re 
likely to use—wood, brick, concrete, glass, and so on—and build from those. Remember, a 
template is just a starting point, and you can always expand it. If you create a number of high-
quality  materials over the course of a project, use the Transfer Project Standards function to 
copy those materials back into your templates. You can also create custom material libraries  
for your own reuse or for larger project teams.
Your organization’s existing graphic standards taxonomy is likely the starting place when 
you are looking to manage materials. If there is not an existing system, you can create one based 
on the workﬂows of your teams. When you start to organize materials by name, there are many 
prevailing theories too numerous to list here, but here are a few suggestions:
By Type  Each material is preﬁxed with a descriptor such as Metal, Paint, Carpet, Wood,  
and so on.
By Use  Each material is preﬁxed with a description of its application, such as Cladding, 
Interior, Exterior, Site, and so on.
Alphabetical  Materials have no preﬁxes.
By CSI Division  Each material is preﬁxed with a MasterFormat numerical descriptor cor-
responding to its speciﬁcation section.
By Mark  Each material is preﬁxed with the designation of its Mark annotation parameter 
(for example, WD01-Wood-Cherry).
Whatever naming convention you choose for materials, the Material Browser can help you 
organize and manage them efﬁciently. First, note that you can change the display of the material 
list, including sorting options, by clicking the drop-down arrow at the upper right, as shown in 
Figure 4.13. You can also ﬁlter the list of materials according to the Class property by clicking 
the arrow at the upper right.

You can also use the Search bar to quickly ﬁnd matching text in any material property ﬁeld. 
For example, try typing sample in the Search bar and the list will reﬂect those materials that 
include that term in the Keywords property.
Creating a Simple Exterior Glazing Material
In the early phases of design, you may want to keep the level of detail to a minimum. In fact, 
guidelines for modeling levels of development may be established as part of a BIM execution plan. 
(See AIA G202-2013 Project Building Information Modeling Protocol Form at www.aia.org/ 
contractdocs or the BIM execution planning guide from Penn State at bim.psu.edu. You can also 
reference a Model Progression Speciﬁcation at www.vicosoftware.com/model-progression-
specification.) To simplify the creation of exterior enclosures such as a curtain wall, try creat-
ing a glass material with a surface pattern approximating the layout dimensions of a curtain wall 
system (such as 5′ × 12′ or 1.5 m × 3.5 m). Ten create a generic wall type using this material, and 
you will have a much lighter wall type to explore design options with great ease.
Deﬁning Fill Patterns
Materials are often represented with simple hatch patterns. For any material used, you can 
deﬁne a surface pattern and a cut pattern. For simple parallel hatches and crosshatches, you can 
use the patterns already supplied or you can make your own patterns.
For more complex patterns, you need to import an external pattern ﬁle (with the ﬁlename 
extension .pat). Such pattern deﬁnitions can be imported from pattern ﬁles used by AutoCAD—a 
process we explain later in this chapter. To create, modify, or view an available ﬁll pattern, switch 
to the Manage tab and choose Additional Settings ➢ Fill Patterns (see Figure 4.14). On the left side 
of the Fill Patterns dialog box, you can view the names and small graphic previews of the patterns. 
Below those are the Pattern Type options, where you choose what type of pattern to create and 
specify what type of pattern you want to edit (Model or Drafting).
Model patterns are used to convey real-world dimensional patterns to represent a material, 
whereas drafting patterns are intended for symbolic representations. For example, a model pat-
tern is used to show a brick pattern in 3D and elevation views, whereas a brick drafting pattern 
is used to represent the material in plan and section. Figure 4.15 shows how concrete masonry 
units (CMUs) are represented with a running bond pattern (model) as well as a crosshatch 
(drafting). To display cut patterns in a 3D view, you must enable and adjust a section box to 
intersect a model element.
Model patterns have speciﬁc behaviors that are not dependent on any view. The scale you 
establish in a model pattern will always be that size, regardless of the view scale. In the exam-
ple shown in Figure 4.15, the surface of the CMU wall displays a block pattern that measures  
16″ × 8″ (400 mm × 200 mm). If you were to change the view scale, the pattern would appear 
larger or smaller, but it would always measure the same. With a drafting pattern, the opposite is 
true: the pattern adjusts with the view scale, so the pattern looks identical in all scales.

Fill patterns are also created as one of two types: simple or custom. Figure 4.16 illustrates 
some examples of each option.
Figure 4.16 
From left to right: a 
simple ﬁll pattern, a 
simple ﬁll pattern with 
the Crosshatch option 
selected, and a custom 
ﬁll pattern
Simple  These patterns are generated with parallel or crosshatch lines that can have differ-
ent angles and spacing. With both the Crosshatch and Parallel Lines options, you can specify 
only one angle for the entire pattern. Using crosshatch, you can set two spacing values.
Custom  To create a more complex custom pattern, you have to import a pattern (PAT) ﬁle 
from an external source. This is often necessary because of the current limitation in creating 
natively complex patterns. Your ofﬁce may have a set of established patterns that have been 
used for years, and the Custom option allows you to import and reuse them without having 
to make them again from scratch. Custom patterns let you import a PAT ﬁle from anywhere 
on your hard drive or on a network and use it as a base pattern for a new ﬁll pattern.
Creating a New Simple Pattern
To create a new simple pattern, ﬁrst choose either Model or Drafting and then click the New 
button. A generic pattern appears in the New Pattern dialog box. You can then design your pat-
tern and assign orientation behavior.
The option Orientation In Host Layers is particularly useful when you’re making drafting 
patterns. This option allows you to specify how a pattern orients itself relative to host elements 
such as walls, ﬂoors, roofs, and ceilings when they are represented as cut. Note that the option is 
not available for model pattern types. As shown in Figure 4.17, the orientation options are Orient 
To View, Keep Readable, and Align With Element.
Figure 4.17 
From left to right: 
Orient To View, Keep 
Readable, and Align 
With Element

140 | CHAPTER 4 CONFIGURING TEMPLATES AND STANDARDS  
Orient To View  When this orientation is applied, the patterns used in the project all have the 
same orientation and the same origin. They’re always perfectly aligned with the origin of the view.
Keep Readable  This orientation will maintain alignment with the view (that is, horizontal 
lines will remain horizontal) but will be adjusted relative to angled host elements.
Align With Element  This orientation ensures that the pattern orientation depends on the 
orientation of the host element. Patterns essentially run parallel to the element.
Creating a Custom Complex Pattern
Custom patterns require an external ﬁle that contains the deﬁnition of the pattern. The ﬁlename 
extension of that pattern should be .pat, which is what you’ll make in this exercise by editing 
an existing AutoCAD PAT ﬁle. An advantage of specifying patterns in the template ﬁle is that 
the PAT ﬁle won’t need to be installed on each computer where the application is installed; pat-
terns are stored internally in the Revit template or project ﬁle.
Before modifying PAT ﬁles, always make a copy of the original PAT ﬁle you intend to use as a 
base; you don’t want to risk messing up other ﬁles that might already be using that original PAT 
ﬁle. PAT ﬁles can be edited with Notepad or any other text-editing application. For this exercise, 
you’ll choose the AutoCAD pattern called Grass, which you can ﬁnd in acadiso.pat (in metric 
units) or acad.pat (imperial units) located on this book’s web page.
Importing a Custom Pattern
Follow these steps to make a custom ﬁll pattern by importing an existing pattern deﬁnition:
1. Using Notepad or a similar text editor application, open the ﬁle acadiso.pat (Metric pat-
terns) or acad.pat (Imperial patterns).
2. Highlight the lines that deﬁne the pattern, and select them.
*GRASS,Grass area
90, 0, 0, 17.9605, 17.9605, 4.7625, -31.1585
45, 0, 0, 0, 25.4, 4.7625, -20.6375
135, 0, 0, 0, 25.4, 4.7625, -20.6375
The actual numbers in the pattern may differ slightly, depending on whether you are 
using acadiso.pat or acad.pat.
3. Choose Edit ➢ Copy.
4. Open a new text ﬁle and paste the selection. (You can also open the Revit metric.pat or 
revit.pat ﬁle located in C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Revit 2018\Data, in which all 
Revit patterns are already saved. In that case, you can paste the selected text in that ﬁle.)
 
5. This is the important part: in the new text ﬁle where you pasted the selected text, add the 
two lines shown in bold here:
;%UNITS=MM
*GRASS,Grass area
;%TYPE=DRAFTING
90, 0, 0, 17.9605, 17.9605, 4.7625, -31.1585
45, 0, 0, 0, 25.4, 4.7625, -20.6375
135, 0, 0, 0, 25.4, 4.7625, -20.6375

CUSTOMIZING PROJECT SETTINGS FOR GRAPHIC QUALITY | 141
The ﬁrst line that you write before the pattern text, ;%UNITS=MM, can appear only 
once in the text ﬁle. It deﬁnes the value for the units used in the pattern. In the example, 
the units are millimeters (MM); if you wanted to work in imperial units, it would be 
;%UNITS=INCH. (If you use the option in step 4 to collect all patterns in the master PAT 
ﬁle, then this line already exists and you don’t need to add it.)
The second statement, ;%TYPE=DRAFTING, helps deﬁne whether you’re creating a draft-
ing or model pattern. In this example, the pattern is the Drafting type.
6. Save your text ﬁle with a .pat ﬁlename extension.
7. On the Manage tab, choose Additional Settings ➢ Fill Patterns.
8. In the Fill Patterns dialog box, verify that the Drafting option is selected, and click New.
9. In the New Pattern dialog box, select the Custom option.
The lower part of the dialog box offers new options.
10. Click Import, navigate to the place on your hard drive or network where you saved the 
PAT ﬁle, select it, and then click Open.
Importing PAT Files
It’s important to know that when you import a new pattern, the type of pattern needs to be the 
same as the new type of pattern you’re making. In other words, if you’re making a new model pat-
tern, you can’t import a drafting pattern. If you try to do so, you’ll see a warning message like the 
one shown here:
In the list that appears to the right of this button, you can see the name of the pattern 
you created: GRASS, as shown in Figure 4.18. (If you have a PAT ﬁle with many patterns 
deﬁned, you’ll see all the other drafting patterns available in that list.) The name of the 
pattern automatically becomes the name of your ﬁll pattern, but you can change that if 
you like.
If necessary, you can adjust the scales of the imported pattern. The Preview window dis-
plays the graphic of the pattern, always in 1:1 scale. This informs you if you need to scale 
the pattern up or down. You’ll know that you need to scale the pattern if the preview 
appears as a solid black box—that means the pattern is too dense. As an alternative, if the 
preview box shows only white, your scale might need to be reduced.
11. If you’re happy with the result, conﬁrm by clicking OK.

142 | CHAPTER 4 CONFIGURING TEMPLATES AND STANDARDS  
Figure 4.18 
Te New Pattern dia-
log box displays the 
imported PAT ﬁle in 
the Custom group.
Now that you have created a ﬁll pattern, you can use the pattern in a number of ways. One 
of the simplest ways is to assign the pattern directly to a material. We purposely instructed you 
to create a grass pattern in the previous exercise to illustrate a limitation in Revit—you cannot 
assign a surface pattern to a material that is associated with a toposurface.
In the following exercise, you will assign the grass pattern to a material in the sample project 
that has already been assigned to a toposurface. We will then show you how to create a new 
ﬁlled region type to create a symbolic representation of grass in the site plan.
1. Continuing with the c04-Materials.rvt ﬁle, switch to the Manage tab and click Materials.
2. In the Material Browser, ﬁnd the material named Site - Grass and choose the Graphics 
tab. Under the Surface Pattern properties, click the Pattern ﬁeld and then choose the 
GRASS pattern you created in the previous exercise. Click OK.
The pattern will be assigned to the material, but you will be prompted with a warning 
that toposurfaces do not support surface patterns. Next, we will create a ﬁlled region type 
and use it as a graphic indicator on a site plan.
3. In the Project Browser, activate the ﬂoor plan named Site. Switch to the Annotate tab and 
in the Detail panel select Region ➢ Filled Region.
4. In the Properties palette, click Edit Type and duplicate the current ﬁlled region type to a 
new type named Grass. Set the Fill Pattern property to GRASS (Figure 4.19).
5. Click OK to close the Type Properties dialog box, and draw a shape on the Site plan using 
any conﬁguration of lines, making sure your lines form a closed loop.

similar to those shown here.

144 | CHAPTER 4 CONFIGURING TEMPLATES AND STANDARDS  
Preconﬁguring Color Schemes
The use of color schemes in project documentation will be covered in greater detail in 
Chapter 21, “Presenting Your Design”; however, for now, just know that you can preconﬁgure 
them in project templates for a variety of scenarios. For example, an architect may perform 
many projects for a single client that uses the same department names in all of its program 
design requirements. The architect would like to ensure that an identical color scheme is used in 
the colored plans in all projects for this client.
In the following steps, you will create a new color ﬁll legend with some predeﬁned depart-
ment values and associated colors. These settings can be saved in either a custom project tem-
plate (*.rte) or a project ﬁle (*.rvt) that acts as a container for settings to be transferred into 
another active project ﬁle. Download and open the ﬁle c04-Color-Schemes.rvt from this 
book’s web page and follow these steps:
1. Activate any ﬂoor plan view from the Project Browser. On the Annotate tab, choose the 
Color Fill panel and select the Color Fill Legend tool.
2. Place a legend in the ﬂoor plan view, and you will see the Choose Space Type And Color 
Scheme dialog box. Set Space Type to Rooms and Color Scheme to Department (these 
choices can be modiﬁed later) and then click OK.
3. Select the color ﬁll legend you placed in the previous step, and click the Edit Scheme icon 
at the right end of the ribbon. The Edit Color Scheme dialog box will appear.
4. Click the Add Value icon (the plus symbol) to populate the list of departments in the 
Scheme Deﬁnition area. Add the values as shown in Figure 4.20. Choose colors and ﬁll 
patterns according to your graphic requirements.
5. Click OK to close the dialog box.
6. Activate the Level 1 ﬂoor plan; then, from the Architecture tab, choose the Room button 
and add rooms to the enclosed spaces shown in the plan view. For clarity, we have turned 
on the Interior Fill and Reference properties for rooms in this plan view. This will make it 
easier for you to select the rooms in the next step.
You will not want to let these rooms remain if you save the ﬁle as a project template, but 
it will help to better visualize the color schemes if you can see them placed in a sample 
model view.

CUSTOMIZING PROJECT SETTINGS FOR GRAPHIC QUALITY | 145
Figure 4.20 
Edit color schemes 
to add predeﬁned 
values, colors, and

When rooms are placed, you can either type the values for departments that match the 
predeﬁned values in the color scheme or select the values in the Properties palette when 
each room is selected, as shown in Figure 4.21.
7. Select each room that you placed in the plan view, and select a Department value in the 
Properties palette according to the layout shown in Figure 4.22. The department values 
used in every project started with your project template will have the same colors and ﬁll 
patterns according to those speciﬁed in the original color scheme. You also have a pre-
deﬁned list of your client’s department names.

palette of a room.

146 | CHAPTER 4 CONFIGURING TEMPLATES AND STANDARDS  
Figure 4.22 
Color-ﬁlled plans can

in templates.
At this point, you have two options for storing these types of settings. We will discuss strate-
gies for managing templates later in this chapter, but for now you can either save this ﬁle as a 
project template or maintain it as a container ﬁle, which is simply an RVT ﬁle that holds settings 
you will transfer into other project ﬁles. For a container ﬁle, simply leave the ﬁle as is, and we 
will discuss the use of the Transfer Project Standards command later in this chapter. If you want 
to use this ﬁle as a project template, follow these steps:
1. In the plan view, select all the walls, rooms, and room tags, and then delete them.
2. Activate the Room Schedule view under Schedules/Quantities in the Project Browser.
3. Click in the ﬁrst row of the schedule and then click the Delete button in the ribbon. 
Repeat this step until all rooms have been removed from the schedule. (Note that delet-
ing rooms from the plan will not delete them from the model. To ﬁnd unplaced rooms, 
you will need to re-create a room schedule.)
4. Go to the Application menu and then select Save As ➢ Template. Name the ﬁle 
c04-Color-Scheme-Template.rte.
You don’t have to delete all the modeled content and rooms from your project templates; 
however, it’s likely that you will have a unique layout for each project you design. By deleting 
the sample walls and rooms, you maintained the color scheme settings with the predeﬁned col-
ors, patterns, and department names.
Increasing Eﬃcient View Management
Once you have customized the settings for graphic quality, you can use several other tools and 
techniques to increase efﬁciency and ensure that your visual standards are applied consistently 
throughout your projects. The properties of all views can be used to your advantage in creating 
a browser organization that meets the needs of your teams. You can apply ﬁlters to views for 
generating graphic overrides based on model element parameters. You can manage and deploy 
these settings and more in view templates that can be applied to many views simultaneously.
Organizing Views
Maintaining a clear and consistent organization of views within a Revit project can generate 
measurable increases in project productivity. Especially in larger projects, a Revit ﬁle can have 

INCREASING EFFICIENT VIEW MANAGEMENT | 147
more than 1,000 views, which can easily cause confusion and wasted time if the right view can-
not be found in the Project Browser when needed.
Download and open the ﬁle c04-Browser-Org.rvt from this book’s web page. Most default 
project templates contain a few simple Browser Organization types that can be copied and/or 
customized—except for the type named All. To access these settings, switch to the View rib-
bon, ﬁnd the Windows panel, click the User Interface drop-down button, and select Browser 
Organization, as shown in Figure 4.23.
Figure 4.23 
Accessing browser 
organization settings 
in the ribbon
Select any one of the listed types in the Browser Organization dialog box and click the Edit 
button. Remember, you can’t edit or delete the type named All.
In the Browser Organization Properties dialog box (Figure 4.24) are a Grouping And Sorting 
tab and a Filtering tab. Grouping And Sorting allows you to group views based on selected view 
parameters, whereas the Filtering tab gives you the opportunity to display only views that pass 
selected criteria.
Figure 4.24 
Use view properties 
and parameters to 
create folders for the 
Project Browser.

148 | CHAPTER 4 CONFIGURING TEMPLATES AND STANDARDS  
Choose the Grouping And Sorting tab to specify three levels of hierarchy to be shown in the 
Project Browser. Here are some examples:
 
◆
Family And Type, Discipline, View Scale
 
◆
Phase, Discipline, Family And Type
 
◆
Detail Level, Family, Type
To further organize the views in your project, you can create additional project parameters 
and assign them to views and sheets. The following is one example of adding custom text 
parameters to views for more reﬁned organization:
1. On the Manage tab, ﬁnd the Settings panel, and click Project Parameters.
2. In the Project Parameters dialog box, click Add.
3. In the Parameter Properties dialog box, create a parameter named Zone; for Type Of 
Parameter, specify Text. Select the Instance option; then ﬁnd and check the Views cat-
egory, as shown in Figure 4.25. You may also set the Group Parameter Under value to 
Identity Data.
Figure 4.25

parameters for addi-
tional view organiza-
tion options.
4. Click OK to close both of the open dialog boxes.
5. Return to the Browser Organization dialog box and click New. Name the new type Zone/
Phase and click OK.

INCREASING EFFICIENT VIEW MANAGEMENT | 149
6. Set the following values on the Grouping And Sorting tab in the Browser Organization 
Properties dialog box:
 
◆

◆
Then By: Phase
7. Click OK to close the dialog box and return to the Browser Organization dialog box.
8. Check the box next to Zone/Phase to make this browser setting current and click OK to 
close the dialog box.
The Project Browser is now ready to support the use of the custom view parameters you cre-
ated earlier.
It is now up to you to assign values to the custom view parameters created in the previous 
exercise. These values can be assigned directly to the view properties in the Properties palette 
or by adding them to view templates. Views that do not have values for these parameters will be 
found in the browser hierarchy listed as ??? (three question marks). Figure 4.26 illustrates this 
scenario in which ﬂoor plans and ceiling plans have values assigned to the Zone parameters but 
the elevation views do not.

Creating and Assigning Filters
Filters are another view conﬁguration and customization tool that can be developed and deployed 
in Revit project templates. They are similar to the ﬁlters available in schedules in that they can 
either display or hide elements matching user-speciﬁed criteria. However, ﬁlters can also override 
the graphic appearance of elements within a view. The possible combination and application of 
view ﬁlters is virtually limitless, so let’s take a look at a few real-world examples.

150 | CHAPTER 4 CONFIGURING TEMPLATES AND STANDARDS  
First, we will review the steps to create and assign a view ﬁlter. The fundamental steps are as 
follows:
1. Create a named ﬁlter.
2. Assign it to object categories.
3. Assign data criteria.
4. Add to the Visibility/Graphic settings of a view.
5. Deﬁne graphic overrides.
In the following example, you will create view rule-based ﬁlters to identify ﬁre-rated walls 
with different colors. You can download the sample ﬁle c04-Sample-Building.rvt from this 
book’s web page. Here are the steps:
1. Open the ﬁle c04-Sample-Building.rvt. Switch to the View tab, ﬁnd the Graphics 
panel, and click Filters.
2. Add a new named ﬁlter by clicking the New button on the right side of the dialog box. 
Name the ﬁrst new ﬁlter Walls-Fire 1, use the Deﬁne Rules option, and then click OK.
3. When the expanded Filters dialog box appears, make sure the Walls-Fire 1 ﬁlter is 
selected, and in the Categories list, ﬁnd Walls and check the category.
4. In Filter Rules at the right side, deﬁne the criterion to ﬁlter by Fire Rating Equals 1 HR 
and then click Apply.
5. With the Walls-Fire 1 ﬁlter still selected, click the Duplicate icon twice (the second icon 
below the Filters list) and then rename the duplicated ﬁlters Walls-Fire 2 and Walls-Fire 3.
6. Select Walls-Fire 2, change the value in Filter Rules to 2 HR, and click Apply.
7. Select Walls-Fire 3 and change the value in Filter Rules to 3 HR, as shown in Figure 4.27, 
and then click Apply again.
Figure 4.27 
Filter rules applied to 
walls for ﬁre ratings

INCREASING EFFICIENT VIEW MANAGEMENT | 151
8. Click OK to close both of the Filters dialog boxes.
9. Activate the Level 1 ﬂoor plan, open the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box, and 
select the Filters tab.
10. Click the Add button, select all three ﬁlters you created in the previous steps, and click OK.
11. Click the Override button in each ﬁlter row under Cut-Lines and change the line color as 
follows:
 
◆
Walls-Fire 1 = Green
 
◆
Walls-Fire 2 = Yellow
 
◆
Walls-Fire 3 = Red
12. Click OK to close the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box.
With the ﬁlters now applied to the ﬂoor plan, walls that have been assigned a ﬁre rating 
value will appear with the color overrides you assigned to the respective ﬁlters. You can create 
more ﬁlters to deﬁne graphic styles for speciﬁc model elements such as furniture by owner, inte-
rior walls, secure doors, or equipment not in contract.
You can also create ﬁlters based on selection. This allows you to deﬁne the objects to be ﬁltered 
without a ruleset. This is a useful option when there is no clear rule that will allow the visibility you 
need. The selection can happen before or after the ﬁlter creation, allowing you to add or subtract as 
needed. To create a selection ﬁlter, follow these steps with same ﬁle used for rule-based ﬁlters:
1. Activate the view Level 1 Design. In the Manage tab, locate the Selection panel.
2. Select Edit. The Edit Filters dialog will appear with a list of rule-based ﬁlters and selec-
tion ﬁlters.

152 | CHAPTER 4 CONFIGURING TEMPLATES AND STANDARDS  
3. Select New.
4. When the Filter Name dialog appears, provide the name MARA Test and choose Select. 
The dialog will close with the ribbon providing the Edit Selection tools. By default, the 
Add To Selection tool is active.
5. Select several objects in the plan view to add to the set. To remove objects from the set, 
select Remove From Selection. You will notice the mouse trades its plus symbol for a 
minus symbol. You will also see that previously unselected objects are now suppressed, 
allowing you easy access to change your selection set.
6. Once you are satisﬁed, choose Finish Selection. As shown in Figure 4.28, you now have a 
ﬁlter based on selection, rather than a rule.
Figure 4.28 
Filter based on selec-
tion, rather than rules
Using View Templates
After you have deﬁned your desired settings in as many view types as possible, you can use view 
templates to manage these settings and apply them to other views of the same type. The use of 
view templates will be discussed in various chapters of this book, but we will discuss their impor-
tance to the project template in this section. Let’s begin by opening the View Templates tool.
1. On the View tab, ﬁnd the Graphics panel and select View Templates ➢ Manage View 
Templates.
In the View Templates dialog box (Figure 4.29), you will ﬁnd icons to duplicate, rename, 
or delete view templates below the list on the left. On the right are the view properties 
that can be applied when the view template is applied to a view.
Notice the column named Include on the right of this dialog box. This column allows you 
to include or exclude various view properties when you are applying the view template. 
If you uncheck View Scale and Detail Level settings, you can apply this template to plans 
of multiple scales and detail levels, while applying settings such as visibility of Object 
Styles, Phase Filter, and View Range without affecting the View Scale or Detail Level 
settings.

INCREASING EFFICIENT VIEW MANAGEMENT | 153
Figure 4.29 
View Templates 
dialog box
Also notice in Figure 4.29 the custom view parameter created earlier: Zone. This value 
can be applied with the view template, which will have the effect of cataloging the views 
in a customized hierarchy within the Project Browser. Changes to view templates are 
automatically reﬂected in the views to which they have been assigned.
2. Click OK to close the window.
The only way to assign a view template to a view is in the Properties palette. Select any view 
in the Project Browser and then examine the Properties palette to locate the View Template 
parameter. If the View Template parameter button displays as <None>, then no view template 
has been assigned. Click the button to launch the Apply View Template dialog box, and choose 
an appropriate view template. In contrast to this assigning workﬂow, view template properties 
can be applied to individual views. Applying a view template is a onetime application. Future 
changes to the view template will not change a view where a template was applied. You can 
apply a template in various ways, including the following:
 
◆
Select multiple views in the Project Browser, right-click, and then select Apply View 
Template from the context menu.
 
◆
From the View tab, click View Templates ➢ Apply Template Properties To Current View.
 
◆
Select multiple sheets in the Project Browser, right-click, and then select Apply View 
Template To All Views from the context menu.
Any of these methods will apply the properties of a view template, but it will not assign the 
view template to the view. If you use these methods and a view happens to have a view tem-
plate already assigned, a message will prompt you to partially apply the properties that are not 
being managed by the view template assigned to the view.

154 | CHAPTER 4 CONFIGURING TEMPLATES AND STANDARDS  
Any properties listed in the View Templates dialog box, shown previously in Figure 4.29, 
that are selected in the Include ﬁeld will not be changed if you choose to partially apply view 
template properties to a view with an assigned template. For example, if model object styles 
are included in the assigned view template and you are attempting to apply template proper-
ties that also have model object style modiﬁcations, the model object settings from the assigned 
view template will not be overridden from the applied properties.
Despite these relatively intuitive methods for applying view templates, you can increase 
efﬁciency on larger projects by assigning a default view template for each view type. In the fol-
lowing exercise, continue to use this chapter’s exercise ﬁle c04-Sample-Building.rvt from the 
ﬁlters exercise, and follow these steps:
1. Activate the Level 1 ﬂoor plan in the Project Browser, right-click the Level 1 ﬂoor plan, 
and choose Duplicate View ➢ Duplicate from the context menu. Rename the duplicate 
view Level 1 Design.
2. With the properties of the Level 1 Design ﬂoor plan active in the Properties palette, click 
Edit Type. In the Type Properties dialog box, click Duplicate to create a new type named 
Design Plans.
3. Click the button in the View Template Applied To New Views ﬁeld and select the Design 
Plan view template (Figure 4.30). Click OK.
Figure 4.30 
Specify a view template 
for new views within a 
view type.

CREATING CUSTOM ANNOTATIONS | 155
4. Click OK to close the Type Properties dialog box.
You should notice that the Level 1 Design ﬂoor plan in the Project Browser is now listed 
under Floor Plans (Design Plans); however, the view template has not been applied to this 
view yet.
5. In the Properties palette, click the View Template ﬁeld button, select the Design Plan tem-
plate, and then click OK.
The ﬂoor plan view should appear changed, no longer displaying any annotation.
6. From the View tab, click Plan Views ➢ Floor Plan. In the New Floor Plan dialog box, select 
Design Plans in the Type drop-down list and then select Level 2 from the list.
7. Click OK, and a new ﬂoor plan for Level 2 will be created that has the Design Plan view 
template already assigned. Rename this view Level 2 Design.
The workﬂow described in the previous exercise will help you spend less time conﬁgur-
ing view settings and more time focused on your designs. Including view templates in your 
project template will give your teams the ability to quickly apply your standard view set-
tings. It will also support continued consistency as each building project grows in scope and 
size. Remember that view templates are easily shared between projects using the Transfer 
Project Standards tool, which we will discuss later in this chapter in the section “Strategies for 
Managing Templates.”
Creating Custom Annotations
We are avid supporters of global graphic standards for architecture and engineering, such as 
the United States National CAD Standard (www.nationalcadstandard.org), but in reality 
many architects and designers will likely have their own set of graphic conventions that will 
need to be implemented in their Revit projects. Placing customized annotation families in your 
project template will save time when you are starting new projects and ensure maximum com-
pliance with your ﬁrm’s conventions. You can load tag families into the template using several 
methods.
 
◆
Switch to the Insert tab, and in the Load From Library panel, select Load Family. This 
will open the Load Family dialog box where you can select the families you would like 
to load.
 
◆
Using Windows Explorer, select RFA tag families and drag them into the Revit project 
environment with the template open.
 
◆
Use the Loaded Tags And Symbols tool available in the Annotate tab when you expand the 
Tag panel (Figure 4.31). This tool allows you to preview all loaded and preset tags and sym-
bols that will be used for respective element categories.
In the following sections, we will walk you through creating some common element tags and 
customizing system annotation.

Figure 4.31 
Te Loaded Tags dia-
log box shows loaded

assigned to selected 
categories.
Archiving and Managing Custom Content
Many new users are unsure where to store custom-created families. It is not advisable to save them 
in the system folders created during the installation of Revit because you may lose track of them 
or inadvertently delete them when you reinstall the software. Reinstalling the application erases 
just about any folder and its entire contents. It is thus wise to keep your personally created content 
elsewhere, under a separate, independent folder; if you are not a single user, store that folder on a 
shared network drive. Remember that you can always include additional library shortcuts in the 
application options. Just select File Locations and click the Places button from the Options menu.
You should also keep your templates up-to-date as you add more content; that way, you need to 
maintain only a few template ﬁles rather than dozens of separate family ﬁles. It’s even better if 
you can establish a template manager as a role within the oﬃce so everyone isn’t making graphical 
changes to your templates.
Introducing Tag Family Fundamentals
Tags in Revit have various similarities and differences from the annotation symbols you might 
ﬁnd in a CAD application. They are similar in that they are created at 1:1 scale and contain lines 
and other graphic elements. The main difference is that Revit tags merely report information 
from model elements, whereas a CAD-based symbol usually holds an attribute value that does 
not directly relate to the annotated building element and therefore has to be entered manually. 
These dynamic annotation elements are referred to as labels within a Revit family, whereas static 
annotation is simply known as text.
Before you begin to customize annotation families or create your own, let’s take a detailed 
look at the difference between text and labels.
Text  In the Family Editor, placing text in an annotation family or title block means you 
are deﬁning text that will always be the same and is unchangeable when that family is 
placed in the project environment. Figure 4.32 shows the words AREA and VOLUME as text. 
Regardless of where this room tag is placed, the text will always say AREA and VOLUME. 
Section tags work the same way: if you add static text, that text appears the same for all 
 section marks. This technique is not typically used for sections because each section is a 
 reference to a unique view, and you want that information to be dynamic and parametric. 
This is where label functionality comes into play.

CREATING CUSTOM ANNOTATIONS | 157
Figure 4.32 
Floor plan showing the 
room tag
Labels  Like static text, a label offers textual information; however, it is a live reference to 
a parameter value of an element in the project. For example, if you add an Area label, it will 
pull the value of the area of the room; if you add a Sheet Number label in a Section Head 
family in the Family Editor environment and then use that section head in a project, the label 
will automatically display the actual sheet number on which the section view is placed in the 
project. If you move the section view from one sheet to another, the label will automatically 
report the new sheet number. In Figure 4.32, UNIT 4 is a label reporting the room name; the 
number 201 is a label reporting the room number. The label behaves as dynamic text and is 
always fully coordinated with the value of the model element parameter it represents.
Creating a Custom Door Tag
Imagine you could use the actual width and height of a door element to drive the tag value. You 
can! As an example of creating custom tags for a basic model element, use the following steps to 
create the custom door tag shown in Figure 4.33. You can download the template ﬁles from this 
book’s web page if you can’t ﬁnd them in the default location.
Figure 4.33 
Creating a custom  
door tag
1. Click the Application menu and select New ➢ Annotation Symbol.
2. In the New Annotation Symbol dialog box, select the family template called Door Tag.rft 
or Metric Door Tag.rft, and click Open.
The Family Editor opens in a view with two crossing reference planes, the intersection of 
which represents the origin of the tag. To avoid problems later, don’t move these planes.
3. On the Create tab, ﬁnd the Text panel and select Label. Click the intersection of the two 
planes to position the label.
Note that text and labels do not snap to geometric references; therefore, you will have to 
manually adjust the placement of labels to achieve the desired alignment.

158 | CHAPTER 4 CONFIGURING TEMPLATES AND STANDARDS  
4. In the Edit Label dialog box that opens, select Width from the column on the left, and 
click the Add Parameter(s) To Label icon between the Category Parameters and Label 
Parameters ﬁelds. Then do the same for Height, as shown in Figure 4.34.
Figure 4.34 
Adding more than 
one parameter to a 
single label
The Width and Height parameters will be concatenated in a single label, which will display 
the actual size of the door in the tag. In the subsequent steps, you will customize the display 
of the label.
5. Add a space and the letter x in the Sufﬁx column of the Width parameter, and change the 
number in the Sample Value column to 36 (in) or 1000 (mm). Change the sample value of 
the Height parameter to 80 (in) or 2000 (mm).
6. With the Width row selected (click on row 1), click the Edit Parameter’s Units Format icon. 
In the Format dialog box, uncheck the Use Project Settings option and set the following:
 
◆
Units: Decimal Inches (or Millimeters)
 
◆
Rounding: 0 decimal places
 
◆
Unit Symbol: None
7. Repeat the previous step for the Height parameter.
8. Click OK in all open dialog boxes.
9. On the Create tab, activate the Masking Region tool and sketch a six-sided polygon, as 
shown previously in Figure 4.33.
Remember to ﬁnish the sketch by clicking the green check mark in the Mode panel. A 
masking region is used instead of just lines because it will allow the door tag to obscure 
any geometry if it is placed over a model object. If you do not need this graphic conven-
tion, simply create the tag outline with lines.
10. Save and name your tag and load it into your project template.
Make sure that it is speciﬁed as the default tag for doors in the Loaded Tags And 
Symbols dialog box, and use the Tag By Category or Tag All Not Tagged tool or place 
new doors with the Tag On Placement option. Using concatenated parameters in tag 

CREATING CUSTOM ANNOTATIONS | 159
labels allows a great deal of ﬂexibility while utilizing actual parametric values. In this 
example (Figure 4.35), the actual Width and Height parameters driving the door size 
become the text displayed in the tag.
Figure 4.35 
Te custom tags 
applied to doors com-
prise actual door sizes.
Setting Some Defaults
To aid the users of your custom templates, take some time to establish default values for common 
elements, such as doors, windows, rooms, grids, sheets, and levels. Create one of each element 
and change the Mark value to a number just below the value at which you would like your users to 
begin. As an example, enter a value of 0 if you want your users to begin with 1. Unfortunately, this 
approach does not work for letters because nothing comes before A.
Customizing View Tags
Section, callout, and elevation tags are graphic indicators that reference (link to) other views in 
your project. The graphics for these elements can be customized to meet most scenarios. To cre-
ate a custom section tag, for example, you have to ﬁrst create a custom section tag family and a 
section tail family and then load them into a template or project. You must then associate them 
with a section tag system family type, which is then assigned to a section type. Switch to the 
Manage tab, and choose Additional Settings ➢ Section Tags; you will see the application of sepa-
rate section head and tail families in a section tag system family type, as shown in Figure 4.36.
Figure 4.36 
Creating a SIM-type 
section tag

160 | CHAPTER 4 CONFIGURING TEMPLATES AND STANDARDS  
In simple terms, view tags are organized in the following hierarchy: the view type refers to  
a Callout Tag type (and a Section Tag type for section views); the Section Tag type then refers to a 
section head family and a section tail family.
By default, there is a predeﬁned view tag for each view type. The graphics can vary depend-
ing on the language version of Revit you have installed on your machine. The view tags shown 
in Figure 4.37 are displayed and available by default in the U.S. English version.
Figure 4.37 
Te default tags
Creating a Custom Section Tag
In the next exercise, you will create a section tag that looks like the one shown in Figure 4.38. 
You will ﬁrst need to create a section tag family using the Family Editor before loading the sec-
tion tag family into the template. You can download the template ﬁles from this book’s web page 
if you cannot ﬁnd them in the default location.
Figure 4.38 
Customizing the 
section tag
To begin, follow these steps:
1. Click the Application menu, and select New ➢ Annotation Symbol.
2. In the New Annotation Symbol dialog box, select the family template called Section 
Head.rft or Metric Section Head.rft, and click Open.
The Family Editor environment automatically opens, and the drawing area shows a view 
in which three green reference planes (two vertical and one horizontal) have already been 
drawn. Do not change the position of either the horizontal reference plane or the vertical 
reference on the right. In some templates, this is indicated with help text in red (which 
you can later remove).

CREATING CUSTOM ANNOTATIONS | 161
The intersection of the horizontal and the right reference planes deﬁnes the connection 
location with the section line. This means your annotation will be located in between the 
two intersections points.
A proposed geometric shape is drawn for the annotation: a circle (two arcs) and a hori-
zontal line. The default shape is there to help you visually understand where to begin 
drawing your new tag geometry.
3. Select the arcs that create the circle and delete them.
4. On the Create tab’s Text panel, click the Label button. Position your cursor between the 
two vertical reference planes and below the horizontal plane, and click to position the 
start of the label.
5. In the Edit Label dialog box, select Sheet Number. Click the Add Parameter(s) To 
Label button. In the Sample Value column, you can enter a value; the default is A101. 
Click OK.
The label is placed and displays blue grips when selected. These let you change the 
length of the label text ﬁeld. The length is important because any value that is added (in 
a project) that is longer than the length of this box will begin to wrap and could cause 
undesirable results.
6. Following the same principle, place the label Detail Number above the horizontal refer-
ence plane but still between the vertical reference planes, as shown in Figure 4.39.
Figure 4.39 
Place labels for Detail 
Number and Sheet 
Number.
You can reposition a label by selecting it and using the Move button to move it around. 
For more precise positioning, use the arrow keys on your keyboard to nudge elements in 
small increments. You can also help yourself by zooming in for a better view. (Zooming 
in reﬁnes the increment for the nudge tools.)
7. On the Detail panel of the Create tab, click the Filled Region button. You’ll be put 
into Sketch mode. Using the Line tool, draw the shape shown in Figure 4.40. In the 
Properties palette, click Edit Type. In the Type Properties dialog box, check that Color is 
set to Black and Cut Fill Pattern is set to Solid Fill. Click OK to close the Type Properties 
dialog box and then make sure the lines you sketched form a closed loop (no gaps or 
overlapping lines).

162 | CHAPTER 4 CONFIGURING TEMPLATES AND STANDARDS  
Figure 4.40 
Draw the outline of the 
ﬁlled region to form 
the section arrow.
8. Click Finish Edit Mode on the Mode panel of the Modify | Create Filled Region 
Boundary tab.
9. Save the tag you just created as Custom Arrow.rfa on your hard drive or network, and 
you’re ready to use it in the template or a project. To load it into your project, click the 
Load Into Project button located in the Family Editor panel. Choose the project where you 
want to use the symbol and click OK.
Next, you will assign this tag to a section mark system family type in the context of a project 
or template.
Creating a Section Type with a Custom Head/Tail Graphic
To create a section type that uses the section head family you created earlier, you need to load 
the new section head into the template ﬁle (if you’ve already loaded the custom arrow family in 
the previous exercise, skip to step 3).
1. If the family is not already loaded, switch to the Insert tab, and on the Load From Library 
panel, choose Load Family.
2. In the Load Family dialog box, ﬁnd the Custom Arrow.rfa section head you created pre-
viously, select it, and click Open.
3. Switch to the Manage tab and select Additional Settings ➢ Section Tags.
4. In the Type Properties dialog box, click Duplicate.
5. In the Name dialog box, name the new type Custom Filled Arrow, and click OK.
6. In the section head’s Type Properties dialog box, click the drop-down menu for Section 
Head and select Custom Arrow. For Section Tail, click <none>. This means the other end 
of the section line will not use a symbol. Click OK.
The ﬁnal step is to create a customized section view type, which will use the new section 
tag type you created in the previous step.
7. Switch to the View tab, and on the Create panel, select Section.
8. On the Properties palette, select the Edit Type button.
9. In the Type Properties dialog box, select Duplicate.
10. Name the new type Design Sections, and click OK.

CREATING CUSTOM ANNOTATIONS | 163
You can now place a section in your drawing area and see the results shown in Figure 4.41. 
Note that in our sample the section is referencing a view that has already been placed on a sheet.
Figure 4.41 
Te completed custom 
section tag
You can repeat the previous exercises using a callout tag family template instead of a section 
tag template to achieve results similar to those shown in Figure 4.42.
Figure 4.42 
Customizing the 
callout tag
Creating a Custom Elevation Tag
Elevation tags are a bit different from section or callout tags because one tag can simultaneously 
reference up to four views. You must, therefore, create and nest various parts of a custom eleva-
tion tag into one family in order to create custom graphics. Here is how it works:
1. Click the Application button, and select New ➢ Annotation Symbol.
2. In the New Annotation Symbol dialog box, select the family template called Elevation 
Mark Body.rft or Metric Elevation Mark Body.rft, and click Open.
3. Using steps similar to those in the section tag exercise, place the Sheet Number label and 
draw lines as shown in Figure 4.43.
Figure 4.43 
Deﬁne the custom line-
work and sheet number 
for the elevation  
mark body.
4. Make sure the properties Keep Readable and Fixed Rotation are checked for the label.
5. Save the family as Custom Elev Head.rfa.
6. Click the Application menu and select New ➢ Annotation Symbol.
7. In the New Annotation Symbol dialog box, select the family template called Elevation 
Mark Pointer.rft or Metric Elevation Mark Pointer.rft and click Open.
8. Using methods similar to those in previous steps, place labels for the Detail Number and 
Reference Label parameters. Draw a diamond with lines and a small, triangular, ﬁlled 
region, as shown in Figure 4.44.

164 | CHAPTER 4 CONFIGURING TEMPLATES AND STANDARDS  
Figure 4.44

pointer composed of 
lines, ﬁlled region, and 
labels
9. Again, remember to make sure the properties Keep Readable and Fixed Rotation are 
checked for the labels.
10. Save the family as Custom Elev Pointer.rfa and load it into the Custom Elev Head.rfa 
family.
11. Place four instances of the Custom Elev Pointer family around the intersection of the 
 visible reference planes, as shown in Figure 4.45.
Figure 4.45 
Te nested pointer 
family is placed four 
times in the head 
family.
When this custom elevation tag family is loaded into a project and associated with an eleva-
tion type, it will function much like standard elevation symbols.
After the views are placed on a sheet, you get a preview of the completed elevation symbol, 
as shown in Figure 4.46.

STARTING A PROJECT WITH A CUSTOM TEMPLATE | 165
Starting a Project with a Custom Template
Now that we have covered many areas of customization within project templates, you can con-
ﬁgure Revit to use any of your custom project templates. To do so, follow these steps:
1. Click the Application menu and at the bottom of the menu click Options.
2. In the Options dialog box, select the File Locations category. The list of Project 
Template Files allows you to select several RTE ﬁles that will be displayed on the 
Recent Files screen. You can see these ﬁles in a drop-down list when you launch  
the New Project command either from the Application menu or by pressing Ctrl+N  
on the keyboard.
3. Click the green plus to add RTE ﬁles, and use the up and down arrow icons to modify the 
order of the templates in the list (Figure 4.47).
Figure 4.47 
Add your custom 
project templates to 
File Locations in the 
Options dialog box.

166 | CHAPTER 4 CONFIGURING TEMPLATES AND STANDARDS  
Strategies for Managing Templates
During implementation, you can take one of two approaches when managing project templates: 
additive or subtractive. An additive approach, as shown in Figure 4.48, assumes that more than one 
project template will be developed to manage standards and content for a single project. Typically, 
a “base” template is used to start a project with a minimum amount of settings, whereas content 
and settings from “supplemental” templates are appended based on region, project type, or project 
style. In this scenario, each template ﬁle is lighter, but managing the templates becomes more dif-
ﬁcult because changes in common settings or families must be applied to all templates.
Figure 4.48 
Additive template 
approach
In contrast, the subtractive approach, shown in Figure 4.49, uses a single master template that 
contains all standard settings and content and relies on the project teams to remove and purge 
unused content. Although the ﬁle size of these templates tends to be larger, graphic settings and 
template updates are easier to manage within a single ﬁle.
Figure 4.49 
Subtractive template 
approach
Aggregating Template Data
Whether you are managing the settings between templates or developing a project with mul-
tiple templates in an additive approach, you have useful tools within Revit to help share data 
between projects, such as Transfer Project Standards, Insert Views From File, and Insert 2D 
Elements From File.
Transferring Project Standards
You can easily share Revit families between project ﬁles by loading their RFA ﬁles; however, most 
other types of content must be transferred with the Transfer Project Standards command. Types of 
elements commonly transferred with this command include, but are not limited to, the following:
 
◆
Materials
 
◆
System family types (Walls, Floors, Roofs, Stairs, and so on)
 
◆
Text and dimension styles

STRATEGIES FOR MANAGING TEMPLATES | 167
 
◆
Filled regions
 
◆
Grid and level types
 
◆
Schedules
 
◆
Line styles and patterns
 
◆
Object style settings
 
◆
Viewport types
To use this command, you must ﬁrst have both the source and target Revit ﬁles open within 
the same instance of the software. As an alternative, you can have the source ﬁle linked into 
your target ﬁle. Next, make the target ﬁle the active project. Switch to the Manage tab, and 
select Transfer Project Standards on the Settings panel. In the Select Items To Copy dialog box 
(Figure 4.50), choose as many item categories as you want to transfer, and then click OK.
Figure 4.50 
Select categories to be 
transferred between 
projects.
If you choose an element category containing some of the same types that already exist in 
your current project, you will be prompted with the option to overwrite the existing types or 
import the new types only (New Only), as shown in Figure 4.51.

cate types

168 | CHAPTER 4 CONFIGURING TEMPLATES AND STANDARDS  
Using Project Templates to Reduce Redundant Work
In a survey conducted by Robert Manna for an Autodesk University class on templates  
(au.autodesk.com/au-online/overview, search for Robert Manna, choose the ﬁrst link), the 
majority of responders indicated that they develop two to ﬁve project templates primarily to diﬀer-
entiate between project types and/or market sectors. For example, if you work for an architectural 
ﬁrm that is usually contracted to perform work on large transportation sector projects, you might 
need to create a Revit ﬁle just to manage the site data for every project.
In that case, you would use a speciﬁc template as a site project template. Within such a template, 
you could use the following settings to reduce the amount of redundant work every time diﬀerent 
teams attempt to establish a site model to which other building models are linked:
 
◆
Name levels Sea Level and First Floor Reference.
 
◆
Set default view scales to larger sizes.
 
◆
Change default project units to reﬂect civil engineering.
 
◆
Add a Cut/Fill schedule.
 
◆
Create dimension types useful for large drawings.
 
◆
Pad types, including “gravel.”
Inserting Views from a File
The Insert Views From File command is useful for sharing views between project ﬁles— 
especially if you use the additive method of template management we mentioned earlier. This 
command allows you to copy drafting views, renderings, or schedules from one project to 
another. It can also insert entire sheets with all attached drafting views and associated proper-
ties. This procedure is quite useful if you use Revit project ﬁles as containers for your standard 
or typical details. An entire sheet of details can be inserted with one command!
Switch to the Insert tab, and choose Insert From File ➢ Insert Views From File in the Import 
panel.
Browse to a Revit project ﬁle (with the ﬁlename extension .rvt), and you will then see the 
Insert Views dialog box (Figure 4.52). In the left pane, all eligible drafting views, sheets, and 
schedules will be listed. If necessary, use the Views drop-down list to ﬁlter the choices.
If one or more sheets are selected in the Insert Views dialog box, all eligible drafting views 
placed on those sheets will be inserted into the current project as well. Note that repeating this 
process will not update the drafting views in the project but instead create new renamed draft-
ing views and sheets. Also note that any custom view parameters are maintained during the 
transfer and can ﬁt right into your customized Project Browser organizations, as we discussed 
earlier in this chapter.

STRATEGIES FOR MANAGING TEMPLATES | 169

Insert Views can 
be used to transfer 
an entire sheet of 
drafting views into 
your project.
Inserting 2D Elements from a File
The Insert 2D Elements From File command is similar to the Insert Views From File command, but 
instead of inserting an entire view, it will transfer only the view-speciﬁc elements from the selected 
view to the active view in the current project. You can select only one view from the selected ﬁle. 
This command allows you the ﬂexibility to insert various view-speciﬁc elements such as detail 
lines, ﬁlled regions, text, and color ﬁll legends. These elements can be imported from any view—
not just drafting views.
On the Insert tab, ﬁnd the Import panel, choose Insert From File ➢ Insert 2D Elements From 
File, and then navigate to a project ﬁle. Choose one of the available drafting views in the Insert 
2D Elements dialog box (Figure 4.53).
For consistency, be sure to select the Transfer View Scale option to convert the scale of the 
active drafting view to that of the view you are inserting. You can move the elements into 
position using the Move command, and after placing the 2D elements, be sure to click Finish 
in the Edit Pasted panel or double-click anywhere outside the elements to complete the 
command.

Duplicate Types When Inserting
When using Insert Views From File or Insert 2D Elements From File, be sure to watch for warnings 
about existing types not being overwritten, as shown here, because new element types from the 
inserted source may contain more desirable properties.
If duplicated types from the inserted source are needed, rather than the existing types, those 
families can be loaded using the Load Family or Transfer Project Standards tools.

 Exploring the UI and Organizing 
Projects   
 After more than a decade in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry, 
Autodesk ® Revit ® software continues to be unique in its combination of powerful features and 
ease of use. Revit may not be the absolute best tool to design and document every imaginable 
building type, but its features and functions make the vast majority of production tasks much 
more efﬁ cient and accurate. 
 Revit is a completely bidirectional, multiuser working environment, unlike other 2D computer-
aided drafting (CAD) or 3D building information modeling (BIM) tools. Instead of talking about 
layers and  vectors , you will be using terms such as  projects ,  components , and  parameters along with 
tools such as Wall, Door, and Floor. The concepts and terminology should seem familiar if you 
have experience in the building industry; however, transitioning to them can be a daunting 
task if you are more familiar with drafting terms than construction. This chapter provides an 
overview of the Revit user interface (UI) as well as the key aspects of data organization within a 
project.

 Understanding the User Interface 
 The UI is based on the Windows ribbon framework that is also found in software applications 
such as Microsoft Ofﬁ ce. Within Revit, you will ﬁ nd many commands and tools that use simi-
lar dialog boxes and workﬂ ows. For example, you will not ﬁ nd disparate dialog boxes for door 
properties versus window properties. Persistence of tool location is another key to increased 
usability. Even though tools remain contextually exposed or hidden, the majority of them can be 
found in the same place relative to the overall UI. 
 As you’re learning the interface, keep in mind that the interface presents a tooltip for every 
element. This tooltip has two stages. The ﬁ rst stage, which appears when you ﬁ rst mouse over 
the tool, provides the name as well as an option to ﬁ nd out more information from the Help 
menu by pressing the F1 key. Most tooltips provide a second stage that gives you an additional 
description about what the tool is typically used for. A new user can learn a lot just by mousing 
over various parts of the interface.

You have the ability to access all three disciplines of the Revit software suite—Architecture, 
Structure, and MEP. This functionality is addressed in the “Getting to Know the Ribbon” sec-
tion of this chapter.
Figure 2.1 shows the Revit UI. To illustrate some different project views, we’ve tiled four view 
types: plan, elevation, 3D, and sheet. In the following sections of this chapter, we will review the 
major components of the UI.
Figure 2.1 
Te Revit UI
Accessing and Using the Application Menu
Click the Revit tab just under the big R in the upper-left corner of the UI (Figure 2.2) to open  
the Application menu and access commonly used commands such as New, Open, Save, Print, 
and so on.
You can also export your project to a number of 2D and 3D formats from this menu. In the 
upper-left corner of the dialog there are two icons for both recent documents and open docu-
ments. Recent Documents lists the last several ﬁles that you’ve opened, no matter the location. 
Open Documents shows you all the ﬁles you currently have open, as Revit allows you to load 
multiple ﬁles at once. This is a great tool in case you have many views open and you want to 
quickly go to a speciﬁc ﬁle you’re working on. Many of the tools that allow you to open or save 
multiple formats include ﬂyout menus that help you specify different options. For example, 
when you have a project open and you choose Save As, you can save your project as a typical 
Revit ﬁle or as a template to be used as a basis for future projects. Dialogs like this will also 
limit you to the operations that you can do currently. If you have a project ﬁle open, you cannot 
save it as a family ﬁle; Revit will gray that option out, visually informing you that this is not a 
valid operation. These dialogs are nice in that you can customize locations for opening and sav-
ing certain ﬁle types. When you open the Open dialog, you’ll see a list of shortcuts to the left 
that give you quick access to your desktop, favorites, and even the history of your most recent 
navigation. What’s nice about this dialog is that you can also create additional locations based 
on your current workﬂow. Creating a shortcut to a library of components or to your project 
folder will help save you time when you’re navigating between ﬁles. The Publish option lets you

Te Application menu
upload exported formats (DWF, DWG, DXF, DGN, and SAT) to Autodesk® Buzzsaw® to share 
project documents with your team. Use the Close command to quickly close a project or family 
without closing every open view.
When accessing some of the ﬂyout commands in the Application menu, be aware that there 
may be additional commands or options on the ﬂyout that are hidden. This is most evident 
on the Export command ﬂyout, in which you must scroll to the bottom of the ﬂyout to access 
exporting options for Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and others. If you click the button 
without choosing the ﬂyout, you are choosing the default option.
Using the Quick Access Toolbar
The Quick Access toolbar (QAT) allows you to keep frequently used tools at your ﬁngertips. 
Some commonly used commands are included by default in the QAT, but you can customize it 
to meet your own needs.
Right-click any button in one of the ribbon tabs, and you will ﬁnd the command Add To Quick 
Access Toolbar. By clicking the small, down-facing arrow to the far right of the QAT, you’ll ﬁnd that 
tools may be further customized, grouped, or removed from the toolbar (Figure 2.3). By default, the 
QAT bar is above the ribbon, but you also have the option to show the QAT below the ribbon.

28 | CHAPTER 2 EXPLORING THE UI AND ORGANIZING PROJECTS 
Figure 2.3 
Customizing 
the QAT
With the QAT you also have the option of temporarily hiding quick access tools based on the 
ﬂyout arrow on the far-right side. With this, you could quickly provision or unprovision tools 
based on your current workﬂow, without having to re-create the shortcut.
Using the InfoCenter
To the far right of the QAT is the InfoCenter (Figure 2.4).
Figure 2.4 
Te InfoCenter
From left to right, you have the ability to search for help solutions, access the Subscription 
Center, open the Communication Center, show Favorites (saved articles and solutions from 
the Communication Center), sign in to other Autodesk services (such as cloud rendering or 
Collaboration for Revit), launch the Autodesk Exchange for Revit (Exchange Apps), and open the 
help content.
Because Autodesk continues to move toward more cloud services, we recommend making 
sure you have a login for your system. This helps with other things such as collaboration, but it 
is going to make it easier for you to take advantage of all the capabilities that the software has to 
offer.
Getting to Know the Ribbon
The ribbon is the primary location for accessing the commands and tools you will use in the 
application (Figure 2.5). Every program using Microsoft’s ribbon interface is different, and some 
software developers and companies develop their own unique interfaces and ways of working. 

UNDERSTANDING THE USER INTERFACE | 29
Revit is a great example of this. You can launch commands and tools by selecting icons in the 
ribbon, or you can create customized keyboard shortcuts as an alternative. Refer to Chapter 3, 
“The Basics of the Toolbox,” for more information on keyboard shortcuts. Throughout this book, 
we will refer to the ribbon frequently, so you should be familiar with its basic parts: tabs and 
panels. Tabs are the categories of tools, and panels are the subcategories organized into icons.
Figure 2.5 
Te ribbon

Expanded Panel

Tool or Command
The organization and size of the icons within each panel on the ribbon will change slightly as 
you scale the size of your application window. As the application window gets smaller, the icons 
will decrease in size and will sometimes stack, or the descriptions will be hidden.
Touring the Tabs
Tabs are the highest level of organization and are used to select from among the various groups 
of functionality. There are up to 12 tabs along the top of the ribbon. We’ll take a moment to 
brieﬂy describe them.
Revit  The Revit tab contains all the features for the Application menu, as previously dis-
cussed. (See “Accessing and Using the Application Menu.”)
Architecture, Structure, or Systems  When you install Revit, you will have access to the tools 
for all three design disciplines, and you can control the visibility of these tabs (Architecture, 
Structure, and Systems) from the Options dialog box (accessed from the Application menu), as 
shown in Figure 2.6. It has become common for architects to have all three disciplines visible 
to improve collaboration. These tabs contain tools you will use to create or place content spe-
ciﬁc to each design discipline. At the end of the tabs bar, there is a tool that allows you to cycle 
through variations of displaying tabs and panels. This is really useful only if you are trying to 
increase the real estate that is available to your working views.
Insert  The Insert tab is used to link external ﬁles (2D, 3D, image, and other RVT ﬁles)  
as well as search for external content via Autodesk® BIMobject®, which you can access at  
www.bimobject.com. (This was previously called Autodesk® Seek.) To insert content from 
family ﬁles, you can use the Load Family command from this tab; however, this same com-
mand is available with most modeling commands in the contextual tab of the ribbon. Learn 
more about linking Revit ﬁles in Chapter 6, “Working with Consultants,” and using other ﬁle 
formats in Chapter 7, “Interoperability: Working Multiplatform.”

30 | CHAPTER 2 EXPLORING THE UI AND ORGANIZING PROJECTS 
Figure 2.6 
Setting the UI options
Annotate  The Annotate tab contains many of the tools necessary to annotate, tag, dimen-
sion, or otherwise graphically document your project. Learn more about these tools in 
Chapter 17, “Detailing Your Design,” and Chapter 19, “Annotating Your Design.”
Analyze  The Analyze tab contains the tools necessary to modify energy analysis set-
tings and to run an energy simulation via Green Building Studio®. This feature requires an 
Autodesk Subscription account to access the online analysis engine. Learn more about con-
ceptual energy analysis in Chapter 22, “Conceptual Design and Design Analysis.”
Massing & Site  The Massing & Site tab contains the tools necessary to add massing and 
site-related elements such as toposurfaces and property lines. Learn more about modeling 
site context in Chapter 3 and in Chapter 9, “Advanced Modeling and Massing.”
Collaborate  The Collaborate tab contains the tools that you’ll use to coordinate and manage 
the project within your own team as well as across other teams and their linked ﬁles. Learn 
more about worksharing in Chapter 5, “Collaborating with a Team,” and interdisciplinary 
coordination in Chapter 6.
View  The View tab contains the tools that you’ll use to create all your project views, 2D 
and 3D, as well as schedules, legends, and sheets. You can also modify your UI from this tab, 
including your keyboard shortcuts. Learn more about creating multiple project views and 
sheets in Chapter 18, “Documenting Your Design.”

UNDERSTANDING THE USER INTERFACE | 31
Manage  The Manage tab contains tools to access all your project standards and other set-
tings. You will also ﬁnd the Design Options and Phasing tools on this tab. You can ﬁnd addi-
tional tools such as Review Warnings and Select by ID on the Manage tab that will help keep 
your project running smoothly.
One of the most important settings that you’ll use during your project is Object Styles on 
the Manage tab. Selecting this option will allow you to manage the global visibility settings 
for just about everything in your project: how it projects, how it cuts, and its associated color 
and pen weight. Learn more about this and other project settings in Chapter 4, “Conﬁguring 
Templates and Standards.”
Add-Ins  The Add-Ins tab appears only when additional extensions have been installed. 
It contains the tools that can do a variety of things based on additional applications created 
through the API. Many third-party companies, such as Ideate, BIMobject, and even Autodesk, 
have written additional applications that supplement the functions of Revit. These may 
include enhanced analysis or management processes.
Modify  The Modify tab contains the tools used to manipulate the content you’re creating in 
your project. You’ll ﬁnd tools such as Cut, Join, Move, Copy, and Rotate, among many others. 
Learn more about common editing tools in Chapter 3.
Contextual Tabs  Contextual tabs are revealed when speciﬁc elements are selected or ele-
ment creation commands are launched. For example, the Modify | Walls contextual tab 
(Figure 2.7) is displayed when a wall is selected. These unique tabs are usually colored green 
to help you distinguish them from other static tabs in the ribbon.
Figure 2.7 
Example of a contex-
tual tab
A simple, yet important, setting that may be exposed on the contextual tab when plac-
ing model content is Tag On Placement. Modeling commands such as Door, Window, and 
Component allow you to enable automatic tagging to reduce overall documentation time. If 
you are working in an early design phase, you may want to disable the Tag On Placement set-
ting, unless you have separate presentation views created.
Placing Panels
Within each tab in the ribbon are groups of tools and commands referred to as panels. If you 
want to make any panel consistently available for easy access, you can pull it out of its tab 
and arrange it anywhere on your computer screen. To relocate a panel, drag the panel out of 
the ribbon using your mouse pointer on the panel title bar (Figure 2.8). The panel will snap to 
alignment with other panels you have previously dragged from the ribbon if you hover over 
other ﬂoating panels while dragging. These changes are persistent beyond a session of the 
software and will retain their new position every time you restart Revit until you choose to 
change them again.

32 | CHAPTER 2 EXPLORING THE UI AND ORGANIZING PROJECTS 
To return a panel to the ribbon, hover the mouse pointer over a ﬂoating panel and the panel’s 
border will appear. Click the arrow in the upper portion of the gray bar at the right of the ﬂoat-
ing panel.
On some panels, you will ﬁnd that settings can be accessed from the panel’s title bar. You can 
see an example of these features on the Annotate tab of the ribbon. In Figure 2.9, the small arrow 
on the Text panel is known as a dialog launcher and will open the Type Properties dialog box for 
Text (not shown in Figure 2.9). Clicking the down arrow on the Tag panel exposes an expanded 
panel that displays the Loaded Tags And Symbols command.
Figure 2.8 
Panels can be relocated 
anywhere in the UI.

Special panel features
Using Other Aspects of the UI
Now that we’ve covered the fundamental elements contained in the ribbon, let’s look at other 
important aspects of the UI.
Options Bar
The Options bar is located directly below the ribbon and is a contextually sensitive area that 
gives you feedback as you select tools and objects. In Figure 2.10, you see the options available 
below the ribbon when the Wall tool is active. You can also use the Options bar when an object 
already placed in a project or family is selected.

UNDERSTANDING THE USER INTERFACE | 33
An especially important and frequently used option is included with any annotation  symbol—
the ability to include or exclude a leader. This will help you place tags in the clearest location 
within your documentation while maintaining a parametric relationship to the associated 
model element. Look for this option when you use the Tag By Category command from the 
Annotate tab in the ribbon.
Properties Palette, Project Browser
The Properties palette contains the parameters of whatever you’re currently working on and 
shows the instance parameters by default. In this palette, you will ﬁnd the Type Selector, a 
selection ﬁlter, and the Edit Type button (Figure 2.11). You’ll learn more about ﬁltering selected 
objects in Chapter 3, as well as much more about parameters in Chapter 15, “Designing with the 
Family Editor.”
Figure 2.10 
Options appear in a 
bar below the ribbon.
Figure 2.11 
Properties palette
The Project Browser (Figure 2.12) is a hierarchical listing of all the views, legends, schedules, 
sheets, families, groups, and links in your project. You can expand and collapse the project tree 
by selecting the + and – icons.

34 | CHAPTER 2 EXPLORING THE UI AND ORGANIZING PROJECTS 
You can search for elements by right-clicking any item in the Project Browser and selecting 
Search from the context menu. The simple search function will highlight any view, sheet, family, 
or type with the matching text in its name.
The Project Browser can also be ﬁltered and grouped into folders based on a number of user-
deﬁned parameters (see Figure 2.13). To access the Browser Organization Properties dialog box, 
right-click the Views portion at the top of the palette. You can also access this tool in the View 
tab under the User Interface ﬂyout button. Learn more about Project Browser customization in 
Chapter 4.

UNDERSTANDING THE USER INTERFACE | 35
The Properties palette and Project Browser can be undocked from the main UI and can also 
be placed on a secondary monitor simply by dragging or double-clicking the top border of either 
palette. You can also drag these UI elements onto each other to use them in a uniﬁed tabbed 
or stacked palette, as shown in Figure 2.14. Dragging one palette onto the top border of the 
other will create a tabbed palette, whereas dragging it just below the top border will result in a 
stacked palette.

Project Browser com-
bined in a tabbed or

Status Bar
The status bar at the bottom of the UI provides useful information about selected objects and 
active tools. When you start a tool, the status bar will display prompts about the next step 
required of the tool. For example, select an object and start the Rotate command; the status bar 

36 | CHAPTER 2 EXPLORING THE UI AND ORGANIZING PROJECTS 
will read “Click to enter rotate start ray or drag or click the rotation center control.” It is also 
useful when you are using the Tab key to toggle between object snap points or when selecting 
chains of elements.
Toward the middle of the status bar, you will ﬁnd toolbars for worksets and design options. 
Showing the current worksets during a collaborative project will help ensure you are placing 
elements on the correct workset. Worksharing will be covered in Chapter 5. If you’re using 
design options (covered more in Chapter 11, “Working with Phasing, Groups, and Design 
Options”), the status bar can also show you which option you’re currently exploring.
At the far right end, you will see a ﬁlter icon next to a number. When you select objects in a 
view window, the number of selected objects will be displayed here. Click the Filter icon to open 
the Filter dialog box and reﬁne the selection set. The ﬁve icons next to the Filter icon determine 
which objects in your model are eligible for selection. We will discuss selecting elements in 
greater detail in Chapter 3.
Drawing Area
The drawing area is the window into your design space. As shown previously in Figure 2.1,  
you can tile several views from any number of open ﬁles or you can maximize the view 
windows. When the view windows in the drawing area are maximized, press Ctrl+Tab on 
the keyboard to cycle through the open views. To reverse the cycling, press Ctrl+Shift+Tab. 
Alternatively, you can utilize the Switch Windows functionality located in the Windows panel 
of the View tab. To go directly to the view you want to see, choose the view from your Project 
Browser.
If you decide to use tiled views when you work in Revit, you should be aware of a subtle 
limitation. You’ll be able to zoom into only the extents that are deﬁned by the drawing area. If 
you want to get around this limitation, here’s a helpful tip: create a new sheet, but then delete 
the sheet border. This is now a workspace for any view of the project. Just be sure to label it as a 
working sheet apart from your documentation set. Now you can create duplicate views of any of 
your project views and assemble them in this working space (Figure 2.15). Zooming in and out 
is much more ﬂuid, and you’re not limited to the extents of one drawing area. You can create a 
keyboard shortcut to activate and deactivate views, which is helpful as well.
Figure 2.15 
Working sheet view

UNDERSTANDING THE USER INTERFACE | 37
Some of the buttons in the view control bar are just shortcuts to view parameters that are 
also available from the Properties palette. Scale, Detail Level, Crop View, and Show/Hide Crop 
Region are found in both the view control bar and the Properties palette. The Visual Style but-
ton allows you to select from a short list of graphic display modes that can be customized in 
detail with the Graphic Display Options in the Properties palette.
Other buttons in the view control bar are unique commands. One example is the Temporary 
Hide/Isolate command, which helps users more readily see speciﬁc elements while working in 
a view. When you select an object in a view window, use this button to select from various tools 
to hide or isolate either the selected objects or the entire category of objects. Temporary visibility 
states do not affect printing, and the view window will display with a turquoise border until the 
temporary visibility is reset. Next to the Hide/Isolate button is the Reveal Hidden Elements but-
ton. Use this tool to highlight any elements that are hidden in the current view, either temporar-
ily or through other methods.
The Worksharing Display button is available only on projects where worksharing is enabled. 
Worksharing Display can be enabled and conﬁgured in any view to illustrate Owners, Checkout 
Status, Model Updates, and Worksets. Refer to Chapter 5 for a detailed explanation of these vis-
ibility features.
The Show/Hide Analytical Model button allows you to quickly display analytical graphics 
that are commonly used by the Structural or MEP tools in Revit. Finally, the Reveal Constraints 
button temporarily displays all the model-based constraints visible in the current view. This is 
useful for troubleshooting model elements that might not be behaving as expected.
Temporary View Properties
You may also temporarily modify view properties or apply a view template. When you click 
the Temporary View Properties icon in the view control bar, you will have a choice of Enable 
Temporary View Properties or Temporarily Apply Template Properties, as shown in Figure 2.17. 
Because these applied properties are only temporary, when printing the view, Revit will provide 
an option to print with or without the temporary settings. The Temporary View Properties will 
not be saved with the project.
View Control Bar
The view control bar is at the bottom of every view and changes slightly depending on the type 
of view (Figure 2.16). For example, sheet views have only two buttons, and perspective views do 
not have a scale option. Figure 2.16 shows three view windows tiled to illustrate some of the dif-
ferences in the view control bar. From top to bottom, you can see a sheet view, a plan view, and a 
3D perspective view.

38 | CHAPTER 2 EXPLORING THE UI AND ORGANIZING PROJECTS 
Referring to Figure 2.18, you will notice that any recently applied view templates will appear 
in the Temporary View Properties menu. This allows for rapid application of templates to 
increase your productivity when manipulating views for various working scenarios.
The other command selection is Enable Temporary View Properties. This mode allows you 
to change any view properties manually. The result is the same as temporarily applying a view 
template, but you can tweak any setting to your needs. For example, you might want to tempo-
rarily hide all the furniture in a view.
To remove the temporary settings, you can simply wait until you close the project ﬁle because 
the temporary settings are not saved. Otherwise, click the Temporary View Properties icon 
again and select Restore View Properties.
Graphic Display Options
The Graphic Display Options dialog box gives you access to some of the same settings you 
can select in the view control bar; however, more reﬁnement options are available. From the 
Properties palette, click Edit in the Graphic Display Options property ﬁeld, and explore the 
graphic settings you can customize for the current view (Figure 2.19). As an alternative, you can 
click the Visual Style icon (the small box) in the view control bar and choose Graphic Display 
Options from the pop-up menu.
Many graphic options are available, including customized backgrounds, photographic expo-
sure, and a transparency slider. Experiment with a variety of the settings to see which ones meet 
your presentation and documentation needs. By saving them as view templates, you can group 
various settings for better comparison and contrast. You will learn much more about graphic 
styles in Chapter 12, “Visualization.”

If you select Temporarily Apply Template Properties, you can select from any view template 
established in your project. Once a view template is applied to the view with this tool, the view 
will be highlighted with a purple boundary, as shown in Figure 2.18. Refer to Chapter 4 for a 
detailed review of view templates.

Work Plane Viewer
Most modeling tools and commands require an active work plane on which to place geometry. 
When you are working in a plan view, the work plane is usually set to the current level associ-
ated with the view. In a 3D, section, or elevation view, the deﬁnition of an active work plane may 
be a bit more confusing. In addition to levels, work planes can be deﬁned as reference planes, a 
structural grid, or a surface of another object. To help you visualize an active work plane, a work 
plane viewer is available in Revit. Be aware that an active work plane could be perpendicular to 
your orientation if the view is adjusted three dimensionally.

40 | CHAPTER 2 EXPLORING THE UI AND ORGANIZING PROJECTS 
The Viewer option is located on the Work Plane panel of the Architecture tab. This viewer 
is available from all model views when you’re in the project environment. By default, the work 
plane is based on the active work plane of the last active view. But when you enter Sketch mode 
(for example, when you are creating a ﬂoor or a roof), the active work plane is that of the sketch 
(Figure 2.20). So even if the project window shows a 3D view, the viewer shows the plane of the 
sketch—and you can sketch directly in the work plane viewer! This is useful for working on 
sloped surfaces such as roofs.
Figure 2.20 
Sketch mode with 
active work plane
Navigation Methods
One of the challenges of any 3D modeling software is creating methods of navigation that are 
intuitive. If you have used more than one modeling application, such as Rhino, SketchUp, or 
Digital Project, you will know that there is no standard 3D navigation functionality. As is the 
case with Revit, Autodesk has consistent navigation tools across most of its industry-based 
applications such as AutoCAD® and Navisworks®. These include the ViewCube® tool, the 
SteeringWheels® tool, and basic mouse controls.
ViewCube
A 3D navigation tool known as the ViewCube is available in most Autodesk design software. 
This tool will appear by default in the upper-right corner of any 3D view. Click any face of the 
cube to orient the view to that face, or click a corner of the cube to orient to an axonometric 
angle. Press and hold the left mouse button while moving the mouse pointer over the ViewCube 
to orbit the view freely. Press and hold the left mouse button while hovering over the compass, 
and the view will rotate as if it were on a turntable. The selected tool, the cube or compass, will 
highlight with a shade of blue when active.

UNDERSTANDING THE USER INTERFACE | 41
Hovering over the ViewCube with your mouse pointer reveals the Home option (the little 
house above and left of the ViewCube) that you click to return to your home view. Right-clicking 
the ViewCube opens a menu that allows you to set, save, and orient your view (see Figure 2.21). 
Selecting Options from the context menu takes you directly to the ViewCube options in the 
Options dialog box, which you can also access from the Application menu. The ViewCube 
options allow you to customize the placement, transparency, and functional behavior of the tool.
Figure 2.21 
ViewCube  
context menu
SteeringWheels
Another method of navigation that is unique to Autodesk software is the SteeringWheels 
tool. This tool can be activated by pressing the F8 key, by pressing Shift+W, or by using the 
Navigation bar. The SteeringWheels will follow your mouse pointer as you move around a view 
and will stop when the mouse movement slows, allowing you to hover the mouse pointer over 
one of the command areas on the wheel. As you hover the mouse pointer over a navigation com-
mand, press and hold the left mouse button while moving the mouse to activate the correspond-
ing navigation method. There are many ways to customize the SteeringWheels, all accessible 
through the Wheel menu in the lower-left side of the tool. This is easier to demonstrate than 
explain in text, so feel free to try the various modes of the SteeringWheels tool as you continue 
through this book.
If you use a laptop or mobile workstation without the beneﬁt of a mouse, the SteeringWheels 
tool can be a welcome substitute for traditional pointer-based navigation. The touchpads or 
pointing sticks on most laptops do a poor job of emulating the press-and-drag motions of a 
mouse along with simultaneous keyboard button combinations that drive native navigation in 

42 | CHAPTER 2 EXPLORING THE UI AND ORGANIZING PROJECTS 
Revit. If you’re struggling without a mouse connected to your laptop, try the SteeringWheels 
tool and you might thank us!
Navigation Bar
Access to the most common navigating tools is also provided in the Navigation bar located at 
the right side of the drawing area. From here you can launch any of the SteeringWheels and all 
the zoom/pan commands from the ﬂyout buttons.
Navigating with the Mouse
As with most modern design applications, the mouse can also be used to navigate in any view. 
You are not constrained to using the ViewCube, SteeringWheels, or Navigation bar. You might 
have already ﬁgured out that pressing the left mouse button selects objects and pressing the 
right mouse button access context menus. We discuss selection methods with greater detail in 
Chapter 3. For now, let’s review how you can use the mouse to navigate the views in Revit.
To pan in any view, press and hold the wheel button on your mouse while moving it around 
your mouse pad. Hold the Shift key and use the wheel button on the mouse to orbit a 3D view.
The mouse wheel can be used to zoom in and zoom out of any view, but the zooming may be 
somewhat choppy. Hold the Ctrl key and press the wheel button while moving the mouse for-
ward to zoom out (pushing the model away) or backward to zoom in (pulling the model toward 
you). You will also notice that the views will zoom in and out with a focal point based on the 
location of the mouse pointer.
In camera views, zooming works a bit differently. Scrolling the mouse wheel zooms in and 
out but includes the view’s crop region. To adjust the view within the crop region, only the 
SteeringWheels and the ViewCube can be used.
Deﬁning Project Organization
If you have experience with 2D CAD software, you are likely familiar with many of the terms 
and concepts related to designing and documenting a project, but not all of them have exact 
equivalents in Revit. You may be comfortable with thinking in terms of what needs to be drawn 
and coordinated: plans, sections, elevations, details, schedules, and so on. Such information is 
likely stored in a plethora of separate ﬁles that have to be linked together in order to reference 
other parts of a building design. For teams collaborating in the design process, you are also 
likely accustomed to allowing only one person in one ﬁle at a time. With this, maintaining all 
your project settings and standards is a struggle across so many disconnected ﬁles.
Working in the Revit environment affords you much more control and efﬁciency in manag-
ing these issues. From within a single, bidirectional database, Revit organizes these project orga-
nization aspects: datum, objects, content, views, and project management. Figure 2.22 shows 
what we like to think of as a Revit organizational chart, which gives you a visual description of 
these four categories and what these categories contain. In the following sections, we’ll discuss 
each of these categories and describe its particular role in your Revit project environment.

Introducing Datum Objects
Data (plural) are sometimes referred to in Revit as datum objects and consist of references, grids, 
and levels (Figure 2.23). Datum objects establish geometric behavior by controlling the location 
and extents of your content (the building, the stuff that goes in a building, and the stuff you 
need to document your building).
Figure 2.23 
Datum objects

Level
Reference planes can be created in any 2D view from the main ribbon tabs (Architecture, 
Structure, or Systems), but once created, they may not be visible in 3D. After you add reference 
planes to your project, they can be set and seen from the Work Plane panel. This will allow you 
to work with respect to the desired work plane.
Grids are used to locate structural elements in your project. You are not required to include 
grids in your project, but they are quite useful in managing structural walls and columns. Like 
reference planes, grid lines can be added to any 2D view. Keep in mind that grids can be per-
pendicular only to levels. Furthermore, grids are visible only in views that are perpendicular 
to the grid. So if the grid is in a north–south orientation, you’ll be able to see it only in plan and 
from the east–west orientation.
Levels are datum objects that are parallel to the ground plane. They serve several purposes. 
First, they are the main method for placing and managing the elevation (or Z-location) of con-
tent. Virtually all content placed in a Revit model has a Level parameter. You can even move 
objects from one level to another simply by changing this property in the Properties palette. 
Levels also function as constraints for objects such as walls and columns. These objects have top 
and bottom constraints that can be set to levels so that they will automatically update if the lev-
els are adjusted. Levels may be seen and created only in elevation and section views; therefore, 
you can’t create levels in plan view, and they can’t be diagonal to the ground plane.
Creating any datum is easy. Simply select the desired tool from the Architecture tab and then 
pick two points to deﬁne the start and end locations. Despite their two-dimensional appear-
ance, all datum objects have three-dimensional extents that help you manage their appearance 
throughout a project. You will explore this further in the section “Explaining 3D and 2D Datum 
Extents” later in this chapter.
Creating and Duplicating Levels
In the previous section, we discussed the overall purpose of datum objects; however, there are 
special conditions related to the creation of levels. First, you should understand that a level does 
not always require an associated plan view. Levels that have plan views will have a blue graphic 

DEFINING PROJECT ORGANIZATION | 45
symbol at the end (double-click it to go to that view), whereas those that don’t will have a black 
graphic symbol. The blue represents hyperlinked data, which you can ﬁnd on levels, section 
heads, and other annotations. When you create a new level, you have the option to create a cor-
responding plan view by using the Make Plan View option from the Options bar.
Copying an existing level will not create the corresponding plan views. This is useful if you 
are working on a larger project, such as a high-rise, and you want to quickly conﬁgure multiple 
levels without creating them one at a time. You might also want to use levels just as a reference 
for content but not for a speciﬁc plan, such as for an intermediate landing or mezzanine.
Although it is easy to create many levels by copying or arraying, only create the levels that 
are necessary to manage major parts of your project and that need to be shown in your docu-
mentation. You do not need to create a level for every slab, stair, or ﬂoor offset, as objects can 
be shifted in the Z direction offset for any level. Too many levels can have a negative impact on 
your project’s and your performance, as they take resources to manage.
Let’s explore the creation and duplication of levels with an exercise. First, download and 
open the ﬁle c02-Levels-Start.rvt or c02-Levels-Start-Metric.rvt from this book’s web 
page at www.sybex.com/go/masteringrevit2018. Then follow these steps:
1. Open the exercise ﬁle and make sure the Project Browser is open—remember that it 
may be in a tabbed palette with Properties. Expand the Views tree and then expand 
Elevations. Double-click South to activate that view in the drawing area.
You will see two levels that are usually present when you create a new project using the 
default template.
 
2. From the Architecture tab in the ribbon, ﬁnd the Datum panel and click the Level tool. In 
the Options bar, ensure that the Make Plan View option is selected.
 
3. From left to right, draw a new level exactly 10′-0″ (3000 mm) above Level 2.
When you hover the mouse pointer anywhere near either endpoint of the existing levels, 
you will see alignment guides (dashed lines) that help keep the extents of the datum 
objects consistent.
 
4. Click the Modify button or press the Esc key, and you will notice that the new level has a 
blue target. Double-click the target for Level 3, and the Level 3 ﬂoor plan will open.
 
5. Return to the South elevation view and select Level 3. From the Modify tab in the ribbon, 
click the Copy tool. In the Options bar, select the Multiple option.
 
6. Create two copies of Level 3: one that is 2′-0″ (600 mm) above Level 3 and one that is 9′-0″ 
(2700 mm) above that one, as shown in Figure 2.24.
7. You can change the names and elevations of levels by selecting a level and then clicking 
the name or the elevation value. Rename Level 3 to Level 2B, Level 4 to Level 3, and  
Level 5 to Roof. If you are prompted to rename the corresponding views, click Yes.

46 | CHAPTER 2 EXPLORING THE UI AND ORGANIZING PROJECTS 
Figure 2.24 
Create multiple copies 
of levels.
As we stated previously, plan views are not created for levels that are copied or arrayed. This 
gives you the ﬂexibility to quickly generate levels for taller buildings without all the associated 
views that may increase your project ﬁle size unnecessarily. Although this workﬂow may be 
beneﬁcial for you in early design phases, what do you do when you need all those ﬂoor plans 
and ceiling plans for that high-rise design?
If you want to convert a level that doesn’t have a view to one that does, ﬁnd the Create panel 
on the View tab and then select the Plan Views ﬂyout and then the Floor Plan command. This 
opens the dialog box shown in Figure 2.25. You can select among all the levels without corre-
sponding views in your project. Only the levels you copied in the previous exercise are listed in 
the dialog box.
You can also use this command to create duplicate views of existing levels. Clear the Do Not 
Duplicate Existing Views option at the bottom of the dialog box to see all the levels in your project.
Figure 2.25 
Adding views to levels

DEFINING PROJECT ORGANIZATION | 47
Select the Roof level and click OK. A ﬂoor plan will be created for the Roof level, and that 
ﬂoor plan will be opened. It is important to note that every plan you create with this method 
will be opened as you complete the command. Remember to use the Close Hidden Windows 
tool (available in the Quick Access toolbar) to avoid slower performance in your work session.
Explaining 3D and 2D Datum Extents
Datum objects—speciﬁcally grids and levels—have two types of extents: 3D (analytic) and 2D 
(graphic). These extents are expressed as grips that are shown at the endpoints of the grids and 
levels in plans, sections, and elevations. The analytic grips control the extents of the datum 
across the entire project and all views. The analytic grip is shown as an open circle, and the 
indicator displays as 3D, as shown in Figure 2.26.
If you want to adjust the 2D extents of your datum in only the current view, click the 3D icon, 
and it will change to 2D. You can then modify the 2D extents of the datum object without affect-
ing the 3D extents. We will explore this further in an exercise later in this section.
Datum objects are visible only in views that intersect their 3D extents. The elevation in 
Figure 2.27 shows four grids and four levels. Grid lines 3 and 4 are not visible on Levels 3 and 4 
because their 3D extents are not intersecting those levels.

48 | CHAPTER 2 EXPLORING THE UI AND ORGANIZING PROJECTS 
Figure 2.28 
Customizing 3D and 
2D extents of datum 
objects
3D Extent
You can use the 3D and 2D extents to your liking in any view. In Figure 2.28, for example, the 
3D extents of the grid lines extend through Level 1 and Level 2, but the 2D extents are set above 
Level 2. This means the grid datum would still be visible in both levels, even though it looks like 
they do not intersect the levels.
When you move a datum object, one way or another, content is going to respond. If you 
move a level, walls and furniture are going to move accordingly. If you move a grid, structural 
elements associated to the grid will relocate. And if you move references, the elements associ-
ated with them will update. Therefore, you will often constrain or pin datum objects in order to 
restrict their movement as your project is starting to develop.
Let’s continue with the exercise from the section “Creating and Duplicating Levels” and edit 
the 2D extents for one of the levels you copied. Remember that although this exercise uses levels, 
these methods can be applied to grids as well. Here are the steps:
1. Open the South elevation view again, and you’ll notice that the label for Level 3 is slightly 
overlapping the label for Level 2B because they are relatively close. You’ll need to adjust 
the 2D extent of Level 3.
2. Select Level 3, and you’ll see two items at the right endpoint with which you’ll need to 
interact: the 3D indicator and the lock symbol. First, click the lock symbol to unlock the 
right endpoint. This will allow you to move the endpoint for the selected level without 
affecting all the other levels.
3. Click the 3D indicator so that it changes to 2D. Now you are ready to modify the 2D 
extents of the level.
4. Drag the 2D extents grip (the solid circle) to the right. The result should look like the 
image shown in Figure 2.29.

5. As a ﬁnal option, you can choose to break the end of a level or grid line so that the tag or 
label will clearly display. Click the Add Elbow symbol near the label at the right endpoint 
of Level 3. We have indicated the location of this symbol in Figure 2.29.
6. Use the additional line grips to adjust the level endpoint so that it resembles the image 
shown in Figure 2.30.
Figure 2.30 
Adding an elbow to a 
level
Propagating Extents
Quite often you will adjust the extents of datum objects that need to be replicated in several 
other views. Fortunately, there is a tool to help you accomplish this—Propagate Extents. The 
premise of this tool is simple, but you must be aware of the subtleties in applying it to a three-
dimensional model.
The Propagate Extents tool pushes any modiﬁcations you apply to a datum object from one 
view to other parallel views of your choosing. This tool does not work well on levels because 
the parallel views are essentially mirrored views of each other. For example, the orientation of 
the South elevation is the opposite of the North elevation; therefore, if you make a change to the 
extents at the right end of a level in the South elevation, those changes would be propagated to 
the left end in the North elevation.
The best way to apply the Propagate Extents tool is with the 2D extents of grids. Why only 
the 2D extents? Because changing the 3D extents affects the datum object throughout the proj-
ect, independent of any speciﬁc view. Let’s examine this behavior with a quick exercise.
1. Download and open the c02-Grids-Start.rvt ﬁle from this book’s web page and then 
activate the South elevation.
You will see three levels and four grids.
2. Select grid 3 and click the 3D indicator at the bottom endpoint. Notice that the lock sym-
bol turns off automatically, allowing you to immediately adjust the graphic extents of  
the grid.
3. Drag the 2D extent of grid 3 up toward the top. Repeat this process for grid 4 so that the 
result looks like the image shown in Figure 2.31.
The line weight of the grid lines has been increased for clarity.
Before you continue, open the Level 1 and Level 2 ﬂoor plans and observe that grids 3 
and 4 are still visible. If you had adjusted the 3D extents of the grids in the South eleva-
tion view, those changes would already be reﬂected in the other views. We’re using this 
method because we want to maintain the 3D extents but modify the 2D extents only in 
the South elevation view.

50 | CHAPTER 2 EXPLORING THE UI AND ORGANIZING PROJECTS 
4. Return to the South elevation view and select grids 3 and 4 while pressing the Ctrl key. 
From the contextual tab in the ribbon, click the Propagate Extents button, and the dialog 
box will appear as shown in Figure 2.32.
Figure 2.31

5. In the Propagate Datum Extents dialog box, select the North elevation view.
6. Click OK to complete the command and then activate the North elevation view. Observe 
that the 2D extents of grids 3 and 4 now match the modiﬁcations you applied in the South 
elevation view.
You can use the Propagate Extents command to easily copy datum settings to any paral-
lel views in your project. This is especially effective for propagating grid extents to many plan 
views in high-rise buildings.

DEFINING PROJECT ORGANIZATION | 51
Resetting or Maximizing 3D Extents
Two commands you might need when adjusting datum object extents are ones that give you the 
ability to reset or maximize the 3D extents. These commands are available in the context menu 
when you have a datum object selected (Figure 2.33).
Figure 2.33 
Extent commands in 
the context menu
The Reset To 3D Extents command allows you to reset any graphic extent modiﬁcations back 
to the analytic extents. Let’s apply this command in the continued exercise ﬁle.
1. In the c02-Grids-Start ﬁle, return to the South elevation view. Right-click grid 3, and 
select Reset To 3D Extents from the context menu. Repeat this step for grid 4.
2. You will see the grid lines return to their original condition; however, this has been 
changed only in the current view (South elevation). Activate the North elevation view to 
observe this behavior.
3. Return to the South elevation view and select grids 3 and 4. Click the Propagate Extents 
button in the contextual tab in the ribbon, and select the North elevation view.
4. Click OK to close the dialog box, and the reset 2D extents will be applied to the grids in 
the other views.
The other command in this pair serves a similar purpose in dealing with datum objects. 
Maximize 3D Extents is most often used if your levels or grids are exhibiting strange 
behavior. There are various reasons why this happens, but you’ll realize it when it does. 
You can use this command to set the analytic extents of a datum object to the outer 
boundaries of your project geometry.
Continuing in the exercise ﬁle, activate the Level 1 ﬂoor plan and notice that grid line 
C seems to be displayed like all the other grids. Now activate Section 1 from the Project 
Browser or by double-clicking the section head shown in the ﬂoor plan. You’ll notice that 
grid line C is not visible in the section view. This is because someone mistakenly pulled 
the analytic (3D) extents far to the left in plan view while the graphic (2D) extents remained 
consistent with the other grids. Let’s continue the exercise and repair this problem.
5. Activate the Level 1 ﬂoor plan and select grid line C. Right-click and, from the context 
menu, choose the Maximize 3D Extents command.
6. It may not seem like anything happened, but activate the Section 1 view and you’ll now 
see that grid line C is visible.
7. Return to the Level 1 ﬂoor plan, select grid line C again, and then click the 2D indicator at 
the right endpoint so that it indicates 3D.

52 | CHAPTER 2 EXPLORING THE UI AND ORGANIZING PROJECTS 
Using Reference Planes
Objects in the Revit model are able to maintain relationships with other objects; however, you 
may not always have other model elements (like walls, ﬂoors, and roofs) to relate to other geom-
etry. This is why datum objects are so important.
If you have been using Revit for a reasonable amount of time, it seems obvious that levels and 
grids would control content, but reference planes aren’t often appreciated. Here’s a simple exer-
cise to demonstrate this special kind of relationship between reference planes and walls:
1. Download and open the ﬁle c02-Walls-Start.rvt from this book’s web page. Activate 
the Level 1 ﬂoor plan, select the wall segment, right-click, and then choose Create Similar 
from the context menu. Use the Tangent End Arc option from the Draw panel in the con-
textual tab of the ribbon to create a series of concentric walls starting from the left end-
point of the provided wall, as shown in Figure 2.34.
Figure 2.34 
Concentric walls
2. Go to the South elevation view. From the Architecture tab in the ribbon, click the 
Reference Plane tool and add two angled planes (dashed lines), as shown in Figure 2.35.
Figure 2.35 
Reference planes 
and levels shown in 
elevation

DEFINING PROJECT ORGANIZATION | 53
3. If you move Level 1, you’ll notice that the walls all move with it. You don’t have to select 
the walls; it’s in the properties of the walls to maintain a relationship to the Level 1 
datum. You could make the top of the walls maintain this same kind of relationship to 
Level 2.
4. You can also create a relationship to the reference planes. To do so, simply select all the 
walls (just hover your mouse over one wall, press and release the Tab key, and then left-
click to select the chain of walls) and then click the Attach Top/Base button in the ribbon. 
Note that Attach Wall ➢ Top is the default selection in the Options bar, so ﬁrst pick the 
upper reference plane. Click the Attach Top/Base button again, make sure Attach Wall ➢ 
Base is selected in the Options bar, and then pick the lower reference plane.
Figure 2.36 shows the results in a 3D view after you’ve attached the top and bottom of the 
walls to the upper and lower reference planes.
Figure 2.36 
Finished walls
Try moving and rotating the reference planes, and notice that the walls will maintain their 
relationships to the planes. This is shown in a section view of the walls in Figure 2.37.
Figure 2.37 
Section view

54 | CHAPTER 2 EXPLORING THE UI AND ORGANIZING PROJECTS 
Although you can use levels, grids, and reference planes to customize model elements, there 
may be situations where you need to establish relationships with nonplanar geometry.
Using Content
Effective use of content is all about repeated elements in a hierarchy (project, family, type, 
instance) that you put in your Revit project to develop and document your design. Content can 
often maintain relationships with other content, but more important, they maintain relation-
ships to datum objects. As you can see from the Revit organizational chart shown previously in 
Figure 2.22, content includes system families, component families, and spaces.
System families (also called host families) are content that is part of the Revit project environ-
ment and are more akin to rule sets rather than physically constructed components. These fami-
lies are not created and stored in external ﬁles (RFAs)—they’re found only in the RVT project 
ﬁle. If you need another type of a system family, you will duplicate an existing type from within 
the project. System families can be 3D elements such as walls, ﬂoors, roofs, ceilings, stairs, and 
railings or 2D elements such as text, dimensions, revision bubbles, and insulation.
Component families are created in the Family Editor and are either 2D or 3D content. This 
means you will have to create and load these kinds of families outside the Revit project environ-
ment as RFA ﬁles. When you start to create a component family, you’ll need to select an appro-
priate family template (Figure 2.38). By selecting the right family template, you will be certain 
that the component you’re creating is going to behave, view, schedule, and (if necessary) export 
properly.
Figure 2.38 
Selecting a family 
template
Although most system families help shape the physical aspects of a building, the occupied 
voids within are critical to a successful design. These elements are spaces, which take the form 
of rooms and areas. Spaces maintain relationships to datum objects but also to model elements 

DEFINING PROJECT ORGANIZATION | 55
including ﬂoors, walls, ceilings, and roofs. In addition to spatial properties, rooms are used to 
document ﬁnishes within your project. Take a look at the properties of a room, and you will ﬁnd 
Floor Finish, Base Finish, Wall Finish, and Ceiling Finish.
Working with Type and Instance Parameters
All content in a Revit project has parameters, which are simply the information or data about 
something. Parameters can affect many different aspects of an object, such as visibility, behav-
ior, size, shape, and material.
To develop a fundamental understanding of parameters, you must note that there are two 
kinds of parameters: type and instance. Type parameters control information about every element 
of the same type. For example, if the material of a piece of furniture is designated as a type param-
eter and you change it, the material for all the furniture of that type will change. Instance param-
eters control only the instances that you have selected. So if the material of the piece of furniture 
that you have selected is an instance parameter, you will be editing only the selected elements.
Instance parameters can be constantly exposed in the Properties palette. Selecting something 
initially displays the instance parameters. Figure 2.39 shows the instance parameters of a wall 
that control the relative height, constraints, and structural usage.
By clicking the Edit Type button, you expose the type parameters (Figure 2.40). These param-
eters control values such as the structure, graphics, and assembly code.
This section provided you with a basic overview of families and parameters; you will learn 
much more about these concepts in Chapter 15.

Working with Views
Views are the means by which you will interact with, perceive, and document the project. As you 
can see in the Revit organizational chart shown previously in Figure 2.22, there are both 2D and 
3D views. Two-dimensional views are oriented to speciﬁc coordinates such as plan, elevation, 
and section. Schedules and material takeoffs are yet another way of viewing information in a 
project that is neither 2D nor 3D. Three-dimensional views are either orthographic or perspec-
tive (camera view) in nature. Views also have type and instance parameters that control proper-
ties such as name, scale, detail level, phase ﬁlter, and graphic display options. We will review 
each type of view again in more detail in Part 5, “Documentation.”
Reviewing the Common Properties of Views
Let’s ﬁrst review, in detail, some of the properties that apply to most views. All of these are 
found in the Properties palette when no objects are selected; however, some properties may also 
be accessed in the view control bar. The most common view properties are as follows:
Crop Region  With the exception of schedules and drafting views, the extents of all views 
can be limited using crop regions. The visibility of the crop region itself can be turned off, 
but you can choose to hide all crop regions in the Print Setup dialog box when using the 
Print command. Although you might feel the need to keep crop regions visible to allow eas-
ier editing, you can use the Reveal Hidden Elements tool in the view control bar to temporar-
ily show hidden crop regions. Buttons to enable/disable and show/hide the crop region are 
available on the view control bar.

DEFINING PROJECT ORGANIZATION | 57
View Scale  The view scale is the proportional system used to represent components of 
measured drawings. The scale of a view not only controls its printed size but also automati-
cally controls the relative weight of line work as well as the size of annotations such as text, 
dimensions, and tags. The view scale is displayed on and can be modiﬁed from the view 
control bar.
Visibility/Graphics  The Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box (Figure 2.41) allows over-
rides of a view’s elements in two essential ways: visibility (turn object categories on/off) and 
graphics (customize line thickness, color, and ﬁll pattern).
Figure 2.41 
Visibility and graphic 
overrides for an 
elevation
Detail Level  The Detail Level parameter can be set to one of three predeﬁned choices: 
Coarse, Medium, or Fine. A representation for each setting is deﬁned during the component’s 
construction and sets the level of detail in each view level. It can help improve model perfor-
mance and avoid cluttered views by limiting the visibility of smaller model elements. Detail 
Level can be set with a button on the view control bar.
View Template  View templates are a selection of view properties, which can include prop-
erties that change the scale, detail level, and visibility of objects in the view. As an aid to stan-
dardization, view templates can help you organize common view settings and apply them to 
groups of views throughout your project and other projects within your ofﬁce or ﬁrm. View 
templates are covered in detail in Chapter 4.

58 | CHAPTER 2 EXPLORING THE UI AND ORGANIZING PROJECTS 
Creating and Duplicating Views
You can create views in various ways in order to work with your project in a manner that meets 
your needs. Although creating views is quick and easy, you should avoid populating your proj-
ect ﬁle with too many unnecessary views. An overabundance of unused views will increase the 
amount of management your team will need for the project’s organization. Views that do not 
have a speciﬁc purpose are just another object to maintain, search through, and store. Keep it 
simple, and routinely purge valueless views. Let’s review the procedures to create different view 
types and see how to control their extents after they’re created.
New views can be generated from the Create panel on the View tab of the ribbon (Figure 2.42), 
and the process is quite simple. Click one of the buttons, and a new view is activated and stored 
in the Project Browser.
Figure 2.42 
Creating new views 
from the ribbon
Another quick way to create new views is to right-click a view name in the Project Browser 
and select one of the Duplicate View commands (Figure 2.43). You can also duplicate the current 
view by using the Duplicate View button in the Create panel of the ribbon.
Figure 2.43 
Duplicating views from 
the Project Browser

DEFINING PROJECT ORGANIZATION | 59
As you can see in Figure 2.43, there are three choices in the Duplicate View ﬂyout command: 
Duplicate, Duplicate With Detailing, and Duplicate As A Dependent. Let’s take a quick look at 
what each of these options means.
Duplicate  This command will create a copy of the selected view but will not replicate any 
of the annotations in the view. Use this command when you need a fresh copy of a view in 
which you will create a new annotation for a different documentation purpose or even a 
working view without clutter.
Duplicate With Detailing  As its name suggests, this command will create a copy of the 
selected view with all the annotation in the view. We don’t recommend using this command 
too often because replicated annotation is often a sign of an inefﬁcient production process.
Duplicate As A Dependent  This command allows you to create a series of partial 
views that assume the properties of one parent view. Using dependent views does not 
mean you can have a parent view with a larger scale like 1:100 and then create dependent 
views at larger scales such as 1:50. The parent view has all the same properties as the 
dependents, but you can manage the crop regions and settings from the parent view. This 
is used most commonly with large plans and elevations that cannot ﬁt on the project’s 
standard sheet size.
Creating Floor Plans and Ceiling Plans
As you learned in the section “Creating and Duplicating Levels” earlier in this chapter, when 
you create a level in an elevation or section view, you have the option to create a plan view for 
that level in the Options bar. If you have levels without corresponding plan views, you can also 
use the Plan Views tool from the ribbon to create a plan view.
The vertical extents of plans and ceiling plans are controlled by the View Range settings. The 
View Range settings, as shown in Figure 2.44, deﬁne the vertical range of the view.
Figure 2.44 
View Range dialog box
The view range properties can be difﬁcult to understand, so we created a diagram to illustrate 
the principles. In Figure 2.45, you will see that the primary range is the zone you usually see in 
a default ﬂoor or ceiling plan. If an object crosses the cut plane, the object’s Cut values are used. 
If the object is below the cut plane but above the bottom, the object’s Projection values are used. 
Cut and Projection values can be found in Visibility/Graphics.

60 | CHAPTER 2 EXPLORING THE UI AND ORGANIZING PROJECTS 
Figure 2.45 
View range properties 
explained
For most views, the Bottom and View Depth parameters are set to the same plane. Therefore, 
objects below the bottom of the view range simply won’t appear. So, what happens if you need 
to show objects on a lower terrace for reference in the current view? When you set View Depth 
to Level Below or Unlimited, objects that are below the bottom of the view range but within the 
view depth will be overridden with the <Beyond> line style.
Perhaps you only need to apply a different view range setting to isolated areas of a view. This 
can be accomplished with the use of the Plan Region tool. You can ﬁnd this tool in the Create 
panel of the View tab along with the other Plan View tools. The Plan Region tool allows you to 
sketch a boundary within which the View Range dialog box will be available to make speciﬁc 
changes. You can use this method for areas such as windows that might be placed in a wall 
above the cut plane but need to be shown on the plan for documentation.
Another useful property of plans is known as an underlay. Although this property may func-
tion more like a tool, it is found in the Properties palette along with the other view properties. 
An underlay allows you to use any other level as a reference in the current view. You can use the 
underlay to display ceiling sofﬁts in a ﬂoor plan, to display furniture layouts in a ceiling plan, or 
to use another level as a reference for replicating partition layouts.
Creating Elevations
Selecting the Elevation tool on the View tab creates elevations of various types. You’ll also notice 
that as you place an elevation tag, the elevations automatically orient to walls (Figure 2.46). If 
there’s no host element nearby to reference, they’ll automatically orient to the left.
Selecting the center of the tag will allow you to create additional elevation views (more typi-
cally done for interior elevations) by selecting the unchecked boxes that surround the elevation 
tag (Figure 2.47).
If you select the directional point of the elevation tag, you will see a blue line that deﬁnes the 
beginning of the cut plane for the elevation as well as a dashed line that deﬁnes the side and 
rear extents (Figure 2.48). This allows you to control the analytic extents of the elevation without 
moving the graphic tag, which is useful if you want the tag in a particular location but you want 
the cutting plane to start somewhere else.

Finally, there are three types of elevations in a Revit project: exterior, interior, and framing. 
Their differences are more than graphic. Exterior elevations, by default, do not have an active 
crop boundary, only a starting cut plane. Interior elevations have their crop boundary on by 
default and attempt to ﬁnd boundaries of host elements, such as walls, ﬂoors, and ceilings. 
Framing elevations can be placed only along a grid line, and their cut plane corresponds to the 
respective grid.

62 | CHAPTER 2 EXPLORING THE UI AND ORGANIZING PROJECTS 
Creating Sections
Selecting the Section tool on the View tab creates sections. By default, three types of sections 
are available from the Type Selector: Building, Wall, and Detail. This allows them to be grouped 
with better clarity in the Project Browser, but there are also other important properties.
Unlike elevations, the cutting plane of a section must correspond with its graphic line. 
Figure 2.49 shows the instance properties of a Building section. The far and side cut planes of a 
section can also be controlled. This goes for both Building and Wall sections.
Building and Wall sections must be created in a perpendicular orientation with respect to 
levels. But after you create them, they can be rotated in elevation. However, doing so would 
lead to confusion in your project. Once rotated, the section wouldn’t be displayed in plan view 
because the section cutting plane would no longer be perpendicular to the plan view.
A Detail section will have a different graphic symbol by default, although you can customize 
this to your liking. (We discuss this form of customization in Chapter 4.) Beyond the differing 
graphic symbol, Detail sections will have a smaller clipping region than a Building or Wall sec-
tion. In Figure 2.50, a Building section is shown at the left of the image, and a Detail section is 
shown to the right.
It’s important to know that a Detail section created in plan view will automatically display as 
a callout in any Building section or Wall section if the Detail section overlaps a larger section. Of 
course, this is not an ideal workﬂow for architectural documentation. We discuss the process of 
using callouts from larger sections in Chapter 17.

Section properties 
and extents

Creating Callouts
The Callout tool allows you to create views that are intended to be enlarged from the scale of the 
parent view in which you create the callout. When you are in a parent view—a ﬂoor plan, sec-
tion view, or elevation view—you can create a callout from the View tab in the ribbon within the 
Create panel.
The most important aspect of the Callout tool you need to understand is the difference 
between the types of callout views you can create. When you activate the Callout tool, click the 
Type Selector in the Properties palette. You will see several choices that depend on what kind 
of view you currently have activated. For example, if you are using the Callout tool in a ﬂoor 
plan view, you will see Detail and Floor Plan listed in the Type Selector, as shown in Figure 2.51. 
Although Detail callouts may look like Detail sections graphically, they are not visible inside 
other perpendicular views. So, a callout created in plan view will not be visible in elevations or 
sections like a Detail section.
In the example shown in Figure 2.51, if you select Detail, the callout view you create will be 
listed in the Project Browser under Detail Views. If you select Floor Plan, the callout view will 
be listed under Floor Plans. You cannot change a callout view from one type to another after it is 
created, so plan the conﬁguration of your views carefully.
Also note the color of callout and section heads in Figure 2.50. These blue icons act as  
 hyperlinks to the other views in your project. Double-click any of these blue heads to activate 
that view.

64 | CHAPTER 2 EXPLORING THE UI AND ORGANIZING PROJECTS 
Figure 2.51 
Be aware of the diﬀer-
ent types of callouts 
you can create from the 
Type Selector.
Beyond the organization of callout views in the Project Browser, choosing the right type 
for your callouts affects other functionality as well. The Detail callout has a unique property 
called Show In. This property can be set to either Parent View Only or Intersecting Views. If the 
callout is set to show in Intersecting Views, this type of callout in plan view would display as 
a section detail mark in an intersecting view such as a Building section. In Figure 2.52, you can 
see the callout added to the ﬂoor plan (left). When the Show In property of that callout is set to 
Intersecting Views, it displays as a detail section mark in the building section (right).
Figure 2.52 
Detail callouts can be 
set to show in inter-
secting views.
If you create a callout using the same type as the parent view, the callout view will also have 
all the same view controls as the parent view. In the ﬂoor plan example, you will still have view 
properties such as Depth Clipping and View Range. In a Detail callout, the property called Far 
Clip Settings can be set to either Independent or Same As Parent View.
Take a moment to note the grips on the boundary of a callout when one is selected. You can 
use these grips to change the size of the callout boundary, but this also modiﬁes the crop region 
within the callout view. As you might assume, if you modify the crop region in the callout view, 
the callout boundary also changes.
Callouts can be created either in a simple rectangular shape or in any custom sketched shape. 
You will see these two tool options in the Callout ﬂyout button in the ribbon, but you can always 
edit a rectangular callout by ﬁrst selecting a callout and then selecting Edit Crop from the con-
textual tab in the ribbon. You can also return a custom shape callout to a simple rectangular 
shape by clicking Reset Crop in the ribbon.

DEFINING PROJECT ORGANIZATION | 65
Using Drafting Views
Not every view needs to be connected directly to the model. Drafting views give you the ability 
to draw without ﬁrst creating a reference to something in your project. They may contain Detail 
and Repeating Detail components and any other annotation content. Drafting views are great 
for quickly documenting typical conditions that don’t require an actual model geometry.
Once you create a drafting view, you can refer to this view when creating an elevation, sec-
tion, detail, and so on, that would normally rely on an actual view of the model. As you start to 
create a standard project view, simply select the Reference Other View option from the contex-
tual tab of the ribbon (Figure 2.53), and then you’ll be allowed to select a reference view from all 
the other like views in your project as well as any drafting views. You can even use the search 
bar to easily locate speciﬁc view names instead of scrolling through a long list of all project 
views. Drafting views can also be saved out of the project as common reusable details. This will 
be covered in more depth in Chapter 17.
Figure 2.53 
Use the search bar with 
the Reference Other 
View option.
Using Legends
Legends are views in which you can display samples of model elements that will not affect 
schedules and quantity takeoffs. There are two types of legends: legends and keynote leg-
ends. Regular legends are used to assemble analytic views of content in your project, graphics, 
geometry, tags, and so on—anything that lives in your project. Legends may contain Detail, 
Repeating Detail, and Legend components, which are live representations of 3D model ele-
ments. Legends are unique in that they are the only view that can be placed on more than one 
sheet.
A Legend component (Figure 2.54) is a special live representation of a system or component 
family that may appear only in legend views (not drafting views). If you make a change to an 
element in your project, the representation of that element in the legend will change as well. 
When you are creating a legend view, the Legend Component tool is located in the Component 
ﬂyout button on the Detail panel of the Annotate tab in the ribbon.
Keynote legends are special schedules. When creating a keynote legend, you will be 
prompted much the same way as you are when creating a schedule (Figure 2.55). These 
types of legends are meant to be placed on either one sheet or multiple sheets. If the leg-
end is placed on every sheet in which keynotes are used, the Filter By Sheet option should 
be selected on the Filter tab of the Keynote Legend Properties dialog box. With this option 
selected, only those keynotes that appear in views placed on a sheet will appear in the sheet’s 
keynote legend.

Using Schedules
All model elements have information about their properties such as size, material, and cost. In 
Revit, a schedule is a list of any type of element in a project or linked models and the  element 
attributes. You can report and interact with this information in tabular views known as sched-
ules. There are six types of schedule views that can be accessed from the Create panel in the 
View tab of the ribbon: Schedule/Quantities, Graphical Column Schedule, Material Takeoff, 
Sheet List, Note Block, and View List.
Schedule/Quantities  This is the most commonly used schedule type, allowing you to list 
and quantify all the element category types. You would use this type to make door sched-
ules, wall schedules, window schedules, and so on. These schedule types are usually limited 

DEFINING PROJECT ORGANIZATION | 67
to scheduling properties within the same category; however, you can create a multi-category 
schedule or use some ﬁelds from other elements. For example, many model elements can 
refer to the properties of the room in which they are placed.
Graphical Column Schedule  This schedule is different from the other schedule types and 
is commonly used by structural engineers. Structural columns are displayed according to 
their grid intersections, indicating top and bottom constraints as well as offsets.
Material Takeoff  This type of schedule lists all the materials and subcomponents of any 
family category. You can use a material takeoff to measure any material that is used in a 
component or assembly. For example, you might want to know the volume of concrete within 
the model. Regardless of whether the concrete is in a wall or ﬂoor or column, you can tell 
the schedule to report the total amount of that material in the project. Material takeoffs will 
report material properties across multiple categories.
Sheet List  This schedule allows you to create a list of all the sheets in the project.
Note Block  This tool creates a unique schedule that lists the properties of a generic annota-
tion symbol used in a project.
View List  This schedule shows a list of all the views in the Project Browser and their prop-
erties. A view list can be a valuable tool to help you manage your project’s views efﬁciently.
One important aspect that we want to reiterate is that schedules are derivatives of the model. 
Often, if the schedule is not accurate, the model is not accurate. A schedule can also deal with 
the tolerances the team has set in the units of the ﬁle and may be based on the template.
Using Sheets
Printed contract documents are still a common deliverable that architects are paid. You will 
use sheets to organize views and other annotation for the purpose of issuing printable (physi-
cal or digital) documents. Sheet borders can be customized, but the important fact to realize is 
that sheets are always scaled at 1:1. The important thing to remember is that you are not going 
to select a scale when you print a sheet; it’s really more like printing than plotting. If you need 
your sheet to be smaller or ﬁt on the desired page, these options are available, and using them is 
little different than printing from a word processing application.
You will learn more about creating sheets in Chapter 18.
Using 3D Views
Two kinds of 3D views are supported: orthographic and perspective. The Default 3D view is 
orthographic, whereas the Camera and Walkthrough views are in perspective (Figure 2.56). You 
can right-click the ViewCube and select the Toggle To command in the context menu. To enable 
the ability to toggle between isometric and perspective, you must have a crop region activated 
in the view. We’ll also cover 3D views in detail in Chapter 12.
Orthographic views will always show parallel edges along Cartesian x-, y-, and z-axes. 
Orthographic views are best if you need to show model information to scale. Many people do 
not realize that it is possible to dimension and detail in Revit inside a 3D orthographic view. 
For a more thorough explanation of annotating a 3D view, refer to Chapter 21, “Presenting Your 
Design.”

68 | CHAPTER 2 EXPLORING THE UI AND ORGANIZING PROJECTS 
Figure 2.56 
Creating 3D view  
types and toggling 
between them
Create camera views by placing the starting point and endpoints of a camera (typically from 
a plan view). The ﬁrst point you select in plan view is the point from which the view will be 
taken, but the second point is also the rotation origin for the view (Figure 2.57). This is impor-
tant because if you select a second point that is far beyond your view, when you open the view 
and attempt to modify it, it will rotate around a target that doesn’t seem to make sense. That’s 
because the target location of the view is off in the distance.
Figure 2.57 
Setting camera and 
target origins

DEFINING PROJECT ORGANIZATION | 69
A perspective view will not be to scale, but it can be made relatively larger or smaller by 
selecting the view’s crop region and then selecting the Size Crop button from the Modify | 
Camera tab. Once you do this, you will have the option to change the view size and ﬁeld of 
view, proportionally or not proportionally (Figure 2.58). You can also simply drag the nodes of 
the bounding box.
Figure 2.58 
Modifying the view 
size and ﬁeld of view
Camera extents are deﬁned by the Far Clip Offset option, accessed in the Properties palette 
for the view. If the Far Clip Offset is too shallow, the view may resemble the image shown in 
Figure 2.59. Geometry that you’d expect to see will be “clipped” in the view.
Figure 2.59 
Te Far Clip Oﬀset is 
too shallow.
Simply increase the Far Clip Offset value to show more of the model. You may also do this 
graphically by returning to a plan view, right-clicking the camera view in the Project Browser, 
and then selecting Show Camera. Once the camera is shown in your plan view, you can select 
the node at the far end of your clipping plane and manually drag the node to extend the far clip 
offset of your view so that the perspective becomes similar to that shown in Figure 2.58.

70 | CHAPTER 2 EXPLORING THE UI AND ORGANIZING PROJECTS 
Finally, the extents of 3D views (even walkthroughs) can be customized with the use of sec-
tion boxes. You’ll ﬁnd the Section Box option in the Properties palette for a 3D view. This will 
allow you to control how much of the project is shown (Figure 2.60) and is helpful for creating 
cutaway visualizations in real time or in renderings.
Figure 2.60 
Section box applied to 
a 3D view
Once a section box is enabled in a 3D view, you can select it in order to stretch or rotate it 
according to your needs. The section box is not considered a crop region, and therefore it is not 
affected when you use the Show Crop Region command. If you want to hide a section box, select 
it and then select Hide Elements from the View panel in the ribbon.
Managing Your Project Model
Project management involves all the settings that control (and therefore restrict) the graphic 
information previously described in this chapter as relationships, repetition, and representa-
tions. Returning to the organization chart in Figure 2.22, you’ll see that a Revit project is man-
aged with settings such as line styles, phasing, and view templates.
To cover all aspects of project management in this one chapter would be overwhelming; 
therefore, you can ﬁnd more detailed information about the following topics throughout  
this book:
 
◆
For object styles, line styles, ﬁll patterns, line weights, and view templates, refer to 
Chapter 4.
 
◆
For worksets and worksharing, refer to Chapter 5.
 
◆
For phasing and design options, refer to Chapter 11.
 
◆
To learn about locations and shared positioning, refer to Chapter 3.

THE BOTTOM LINE | 71
Te Bottom Line
Understand the user interface.  In addition to understanding how your project is orga-
nized, to use the Revit software well, you must understand how the UI is organized. Once 
you grasp both of these concepts, you will be ready to move ahead.
Master It  The “big” areas of the UI are the ribbon, the Properties palette, the Project 
Browser, and the drawing area. How do these areas work together, and what tabs corre-
spond to an iterative design process?
Understand project organization.  The compelling advantage of being able to design, docu-
ment, and manage your project across multiple disciplines—the architectural, structural, and 
mechanical disciplines—is something that you can do in Revit, and understanding project 
workﬂow is key to getting off on the right foot.
Master It  Thinking back to the Revit organizational chart shown in Figure 2.22, what 
are the main components of a Revit project, and how can you apply them to your design 
process? How do these categories directly affect your design workﬂow?

 Collaborating with a Team 
 Most architecture projects involve multiple people working together at any given time. It is 
common in design for many people to work collaboratively to meet deadlines and create a set 
of design documents. Autodesk ® Revit ® software has tools that allow for a collaborative design 
and documentation process while giving multiple people simultaneous access to the same ﬁ le. 
This unique functionality is known as  worksharing .

 Understanding Worksharing Basics 
Worksharing refers to the use of  worksets to divide a model for the purpose of sharing proj-
ect work among multiple people. A workset is an assigned group of building elements that 
can be used to manage project responsibilities. Typical worksets might be Building Shell 
or Core or Interiors. By associating various building elements with worksets, the design 
team has the ability to subdivide the model to retain additional control over element owner-
ship. Using worksets, several people can collaborate and work within the same file without 
fear that their decisions will conflict directly with their teammates. By default, workshar-
ing is not enabled when you start a project because it is assumed you are in a single-user 
environment. 
 Worksharing occurs when worksets are enabled and a project ﬁ le is saved as a  central ﬁ le 
located on a network drive. This central ﬁ le becomes the repository where all the design team’s 
work is saved. Team members then create a local copy of the central ﬁ le on their own worksta-
tion in which they will work as usual. The local copies of the model are individual versions of 
the ﬁ le connected to the central ﬁ le (Figure  5.1 ).

176 | CHAPTER 5 COLLABORATING WITH A TEAM
The Library Worksharing Analogy
Another way to understand worksets and how they relate to element permissions is to think of a 
workset as a shelf of books in a library and of the model elements as individual books on the shelf. 
If you are working on a research paper about beavers, you can go to the library and do one of two 
things: check out the entire shelf of books about animals or check out the book about beavers. 
Checking out an entire shelf of books within a certain category is the same as making an entire 
workset editable—no one else can do their animal research paper because you have all the animal 
books. You have become the owner of that workset, and there can be only one owner per workset.
As an alternative, you would likely borrow only the book or books on beavers so that your fellow 
students could access other animal books to complete their own papers. In this analogy, you have 
become an element borrower, and there can be many borrowers within each workset. Of course, 
Figure 5.1 
Te worksharing 
concept
The only information that ﬂows instantly between the local copies and the central ﬁle are per-
missions. As you work within the model when worksharing is enabled, edits to model elements 
or settings are not dynamically transferred among the project team members. This would sig-
niﬁcantly decrease computer performance and would be distracting to your workﬂow to see the 
model constantly changing on the screen. Instead, model updates are published to the central ﬁle 
and pulled from the central ﬁle to your ﬁle when you synchronize with the central model.
Even though worksets are established to break a model into manageable chunks, permissions 
for a worksharing-enabled project are managed at the element level. This means you could have 
a worksharing-enabled project with only one workset but still have multiple users in the ﬁle. 
A project ﬁle is essentially a database. As you are creating, selecting, and modifying elements 
within the model, you are automatically obtaining permission to edit elements from the central 
database. Once permission to modify an element is granted, no one else can make changes to 
that element until the changes are reconciled with the central ﬁle. This occurs when you use 
the Synchronize With Central (SWC) command on the Collaborate tab to save changes you 
have made back to the central ﬁle. It also simultaneously updates your local ﬁle with any other 
changes that have been published to the central ﬁle by other team members.

ENABLING WORKSHARING ON YOUR PROJECT | 177
the teacher probably made a mistake if she assigned two students to complete a research paper on 
the same animal. Tis mistake may also hold true when your team is working in Revit. Te same 
model element cannot be edited simultaneously by more than one person. After all, you probably 
should not be working on the same model area as your teammate anyway, right?
The actual use of worksets can vary greatly from project to project. Quite frankly, creating 
more worksets beyond the defaults is technically not necessary; however, you can use worksets 
to take advantage of other beneﬁts.
 
◆
Use worksets to control the visibility of groupings of building components, such as build-
ing skin, core, interior walls, and so on, without the need to use temporary view settings or 
control visibility manually.
 
◆
Close worksets as needed to remove those parts of your project from active memory, thus 
improving performance.
 
◆
Use workset ownership to prevent others from editing a part of the project you are cur-
rently designing.
Enabling Worksharing on Your Project
The worksharing feature can be enabled in any Revit project ﬁle. You can begin worksharing, 
create and remove worksets, or move elements between worksets during any stage of the project.
Worksharing in the Project Process
When the team has chosen to enable the worksharing feature, make sure everyone is aware of the 
change to the ﬁle and that it is planned within the project process.
To follow along with the text in this chapter, you can download the sample building project 
ﬁle from this book’s companion website at www.sybex.com/go/masteringrevit2018. One ver-
sion of the project does not have worksets, whereas the other has retained worksets but is not 
conﬁgured for worksharing. Open the ﬁle c05-Sample-Building_Start.rvt and switch to the 
Collaborate tab in the ribbon. Figure 5.2 shows the worksharing tools.
Figure 5.2 
Te Collaborate tab
You can initiate worksharing by clicking the Collaborate button. It will initially be the only 
active button on the Manage Collaboration panel. Selecting this tool opens the Collaborate dia-
log box, alerting you that you are about to enable collaboration for your project (Figure 5.3). You 
can choose to collaborate within your network or using the cloud. Both options allow you to 
enable worksets. To begin managing your worksets, select the Worksets button in the Manage 
Collaboration panel. Two worksets are automatically created within your project: Shared Levels 
and Grids, to which any existing levels and grids in your project will be assigned; and Workset1, 

178 | CHAPTER 5 COLLABORATING WITH A TEAM
to which all other building elements will be assigned. You can rename these worksets; how-
ever, we recommend not renaming Workset1 because you can never delete that workset—even 
if it has been renamed. You will read about an alternative way to use Workset1 in the section 
“Organizing Worksets” later in this chapter.
Figure 5.3 
Activating worksharing
Click OK to conﬁrm that you want to enable worksharing. Depending on the size of your 
model and your processor speed, this process can take a few minutes to complete. Once it is 
done, the Worksets dialog box opens (Figure 5.4).
Figure 5.4 
Te Worksets  
dialog box

ENABLING WORKSHARING ON YOUR PROJECT | 179
In the Worksets dialog box, you can create as many user-deﬁned worksets as necessary; we 
offer some tips in the section “Organizing Worksets” later in this chapter. By default, when a 
new workset is created, it does not contain any model elements or components. You can add 
model elements to worksets as you build them or reassign existing elements to worksets. The 
Worksets dialog box also lets you take and relinquish permissions over existing worksets. First, 
you should understand the different types of worksets illustrated by the options in the Show 
area at the bottom of the Worksets dialog box, shown in Figure 5.4.
Types of Worksets
There are four types of worksets in any project: user-created, families, project standards, and 
views. User-created worksets such as Shared Levels and Grids and Workset1 are shown by 
default, and you have the option to list the others by selecting the check boxes at the bottom of 
the Worksets dialog box.
User-Created Worksets  In addition to the two worksets automatically generated when 
you ﬁrst enable worksharing, all of the worksets you add in the Worksets dialog box will fall 
under this category. All building elements, spaces, and datum objects you place in the project 
are assigned to user-created worksets. Only elements in user-created worksets can be moved 
to other user-created worksets.
Families Worksets  For each family loaded in the project, a workset is automatically cre-
ated. When editing the properties of a family, you will automatically take ownership over 
that family.
Project Standards Worksets  The project standards workset type is dedicated to all the 
project settings, such as materials, dimension styles, annotations, tags, line styles, and so 
on. Any time you need to edit a project standard, such as modifying the type properties of 
dimensions, you will be taking ownership of the element’s workset.
Views Worksets  Every view created in a project has its own workset. The views workset 
type controls ownership of the view properties and any view-speciﬁc elements, such as 
annotations, dimensions, tags, detail lines, and so on. You can take ownership of a particular 
view workset by selecting it from the workset list and clicking the Editable button, but this 
is not necessary to start working in a view. You can also take ownership of a view by right-
clicking the view in the Project Browser and choosing Make Workset Editable from the con-
text menu. This can be a helpful shortcut in construction documents when much of the effort 
on the project is more view speciﬁc. Regardless of ownership, any team member always has 
the ability to add annotation elements to any view—you just cannot change any existing view-
speciﬁc elements when another user owns a view workset.
We will get back to worksets in the “Organizing Worksets” section of this chapter. For now, 
you should establish the workset-enabled project model as a central ﬁle.
Creating a Central File
After you enable worksets in a project model, you must save the project as a central ﬁle to enable 
others to collaborate on the model. This is the ﬁle that will collect all the work done by your 
team members and allow them to receive regular updates of changes being made to the model 
and documentation.

180 | CHAPTER 5 COLLABORATING WITH A TEAM
You can use one of two commands to establish a workset-enabled model as a central ﬁle: 
Save or Save As. If you click Save from the Application menu, you will be presented with a 
warning telling you that this is the ﬁrst time the ﬁle will be saved since worksharing was 
enabled (Figure 5.5). If you select Yes, the ﬁle will become a central ﬁle with only the default 
settings in its current location.
Figure 5.5 
Te Save command 
will create a central ﬁle 
with only the default 
settings.
As an alternative, we recommend using the Save As ➢ Project command from the Application 
menu. When you click this button instead of Save, the Save As dialog box will appear. In the 
Save As dialog box, click the Options button to access the options shown in Figure 5.6.
Figure 5.6 
Options for saving a 
project ﬁle
This dialog box contains some important settings. At the top, you can set the number of 
backups the ﬁle will keep in the folder history after saves. The default value is 20. Depending 
on the storage availability on your network, how often your network is backed up, and the num-
ber of people working in the model (remember, local ﬁles are also backups), you might want to 
increase this number. For example, if three users are using Synchronizing With Central every  
30 minutes over the course of a workday, that might be 48 saves before the next backup. Better

safe than sorry. Also, the Make This A Central Model After Save check box is selected and 
grayed out. This is because we have activated worksharing in this ﬁle and it is assumed that we 
will be making a central ﬁle on the next save.
You can also specify default settings for opening the project ﬁle (shown under Open Workset 
Default). We will discuss opening a ﬁle in the section “Creating a Local File” later in this chap-
ter, but we recommend setting this option to Specify for most project scenarios. This will always 
prompt your team members with the Worksets dialog box when a local ﬁle is opened. Click OK 
to exit the File Save Options dialog box.
Back in the Save As dialog box, choose a network location that everyone on the team has 
access to for your central ﬁle. Be sure that when you are naming your new central ﬁle, you 
choose a new name. We recommend you do not save over the existing Revit project ﬁle. There 
are two reasons for this. First, this workﬂow automatically gives you a backup of your ﬁle as it 
existed before worksharing was enabled. Second, saving over an open Revit ﬁle can sometimes 
cause corruption, even if it is the same model. It is also a good idea to name the ﬁle with some 
clarity that helps identify it as a central ﬁle, such as MyProject-Central.rvt.
Naming Files in Revit
When you are working with a project team in Revit, it is important to give your various team 
members some guidance when you name your ﬁles. We just touched on the idea of making sure 
you include “Central” in your ﬁlename so team members know they will need to make a local copy 
when opening the ﬁle, but there are some other guidelines you might want to consider.
When working with other disciplines, consider naming your ﬁle with a denominator to let the 
larger team know which ﬁle is architectural, which is structural, and so on. Also, because your oﬃce 
might be working on several Revit projects at one time, you might be working in more than one version 
of Revit if you’re working on more than one project. So it’s a good idea to include the Revit ver-
sion in your ﬁlename so team members don’t accidentally open the ﬁle with a newer version. An 
example ﬁlename might be c05-Sample-Building-A16-Central.rvt. “c05-Sample-Building” 
is the project name, “A” designates the discipline as architectural, “16” is the version of Revit 
(2016), and “Central’” notes it is a central ﬁle.
Once you have entered a new name for the ﬁle, click the Save button to save the ﬁle. Now that 
your ﬁle is saved to the network, close all the open view windows. As one ﬁnal step, you need 
to make sure you don’t accidentally retain any rights over the objects and elements within the 
central ﬁle, thereby prohibiting anyone from editing those elements.
To do this, go to the Collaborate tab, ﬁnd the Synchronize panel, and click the Synchronize With 
Central button. This button is a ﬂyout button that contains two commands: Synchronize 
And Modify Settings and Synchronize Now. You will want to use Synchronize And Modify 
Settings in this case. In the Synchronize With Central dialog box, shown in Figure 5.7, 
make sure you select any available check boxes in the middle portion to relinquish owner-
ship of all worksets. You can also add a comment to identify the action taken prior to this 
synchronization.

182 | CHAPTER 5 COLLABORATING WITH A TEAM
Figure 5.7 
Synchronizing with 
central to relinquish 
permissions
Yes, it might seem odd to use the Synchronize With Central command when you are actually 
in the central ﬁle, but this method is the fastest way to relinquish all worksets and complete the 
setup of the central ﬁle. Click OK to complete the synchronization.
Using a Revit Server Accelerator
If your project team is distributed in various geographic locations, an alternative to synchroniz-
ing with the central model directly over the wide area network (WAN) is to use a Revit Server 
Accelerator. This technology was developed by Autodesk to support extended collaboration 
through the use of server technology that creates a layer of virtual central models. The Revit 
Server then manages changes into a single central model without burdening the WAN with full 
synchronization trafﬁc.
Another tool that allows collaboration between ofﬁces within the same model is 
Collaboration for Revit, also known as C4R, which we discuss more in the “Collaborating 
in the Cloud” section later in this chapter. C4R is different from Revit Server in that it uses 
cloud technologies to pass model changes between users, and all that is required by the end 
user is an Internet connection. This approach is easier on IT departments as it requires less 
server support but might add security concerns if the project models need to be kept local-
ized to an ofﬁce.
Selecting a Starting View
On the Manage tab of the ribbon, locate the Manage Project panel and click the Starting 
View command. With this command, you can select any project view to be the ﬁrst view 
displayed when the model is opened (Figure 5.8). Because 3D views take longer to regener-
ate when your project opens, we recommend you select a 2D view to speed this process;  
you can even create a drafting view that contains the project name and image as the  
starting view.

ENABLING WORKSHARING ON YOUR PROJECT | 183
Using Caution When Using a Central File
Once you have created a central ﬁle, there are a couple of things you cannot do. Do not open it 
directly again and do not change the ﬁlename. Opening the ﬁle will change its attributes, and none 
of your team members will be able to synchronize with central. If they were actively working in the 
local ﬁle, their work would be lost. Te same problem occurs if you change the ﬁlename—those with 
a local copy will lose their association to the central ﬁle, and they will not be able to save their work.
Figure 5.8 
Selecting the  
starting view
Creating a Local File
Now that you have made a central ﬁle, you will need to create a local copy of it in which you 
will organize worksets for team collaboration and continue your design and documentation. 
There are several ways to perform this action. One option is to simply open the network location 
of the central ﬁle and copy the ﬁle from the network to your desktop or anywhere on your local 
hard drive. Be careful not to move the ﬁle—only copy it. It is also a good idea to rename the ﬁle 
to something that identiﬁes it as a local ﬁle, such as c05-Sample-Building-Local.rvt.
Another use for the starting view is as a project bulletin board. Simply create a drafting view 
for the starting view and keep it populated with project standards, modeling action items, and 
other notes your team might need to know like upcoming deadlines.
Synchronize the central ﬁle once again, and remember to relinquish any worksets you might 
have obtained during the conﬁguration of the central ﬁle. From the Application menu click 
Close to close the central ﬁle.

184 | CHAPTER 5 COLLABORATING WITH A TEAM
Another method of creating a local ﬁle is to use a script or macro. There are many variations 
of this method, so we will not discuss them in detail here. We believe the simplest example of 
a script is to use common Windows commands in a BAT ﬁle. You can create a BAT ﬁle in any 
simple text editor such as Windows Notepad, and you will ﬁnd a command-line reference in 
Windows Help and Support on your computer (search for commands). You can also ﬁnd a free 
tool on David Baldacchino’s blog.
http://do-u-revit.blogspot.com/2008/03/streamlining-local-file-creation.html
The last and most predictable method for creating a local ﬁle is to use the functionality inte-
grated with the Open command. Using any common method to open a ﬁle, you will get to the 
Open dialog box (Figure 5.9). Navigate to the central ﬁle, and when it is selected, you will have 
the option to create a new local ﬁle at the bottom of the dialog box. Whenever you select a cen-
tral ﬁle through the Open dialog box, this box is checked for you as a safety precaution against 
you opening the central ﬁle directly.
Figure 5.9 
Create a new local  
ﬁle from the Open  
dialog box.
The local ﬁle is created in the location speciﬁed as the default path for user ﬁles. This setting 
can be found in the application options, under the File Locations settings. The default loca-
tion for this setting is the My Documents folder. If you choose this method, the local ﬁle will 
be appended with your workset username. If you have already created a local ﬁle with this 
method, you will be prompted with a warning the next time you attempt to create a new local 
copy from the central ﬁle (Figure 5.10). You have the option to either overwrite the existing  
local copy or append a time stamp to the existing ﬁle.
Figure 5.10 
Overwriting existing 
local ﬁles
Before you proceed to open the ﬁle, you can change the way you interact with worksets. If 
you click the small arrow to the right of the Open button, you will see a list of options, as shown 
in Figure 5.11.

ENABLING WORKSHARING ON YOUR PROJECT | 185
Figure 5.11 
Workset options when 
opening a ﬁle
Figure 5.12 
Closing a ﬁle while 
relinquishing owner-
ship of worksets
The default setting for opening worksharing ﬁles is Last Viewed, but each of the available 
settings is helpful to your workﬂow. Let’s review these settings in detail.
All  This setting opens all available user-created worksets.
Editable  This setting opens only those worksets that you have previously made editable. If 
you did not retain ownership of any worksets the last time you worked on a local ﬁle, none 
of the user-created worksets will be opened. To retain ownership of worksets when you 
close a ﬁle, you will be prompted with the alert shown in Figure 5.12. Choose the option to 
keep ownership of elements and worksets. We do not recommend this workﬂow because it 
restricts others on your team from working on elements for which you retain ownership.
Last Viewed  The ﬁle will be opened with the Last Viewed worksets conﬁguration. If you 
use this option when opening a new local ﬁle for the ﬁrst time, all worksets will be opened.
Specify  We highly recommend this option because it will give you the most ﬂexibility 
when opening a local ﬁle and is especially helpful with cutting down the open time for large 
ﬁles. When Specify is selected, you will be presented with the Worksets dialog box imme-
diately after you click the Open button. You can then choose the worksets you would like to 
open or close before the ﬁle is loaded into memory.
To continue your exercise, choose the Specify option and then click the Open button. The ﬁrst 
time any local ﬁle is opened using a method other than the Create New Local option, you will 
see a warning message alerting you that you are opening a local ﬁle. This is simply a notiﬁca-
tion that you have made a local copy of a central ﬁle and you will be the owner of the local ﬁle. If 
this warning appears, click Close to dismiss the warning and continue the ﬁle-opening process.

186 | CHAPTER 5 COLLABORATING WITH A TEAM
The Benefits of Revit Local Files
Using a worksharing environment allows you to do something your IT department typically asks 
you not to do: work directly on your workstation’s hard drive. Although working oﬀ a network ﬁle 
is typically a good idea, there are several reasons why a local copy oﬀers additional beneﬁts.
 
◆
It allows more than one user to make changes to the central ﬁle by editing local ﬁles and syn-
chronizing those changes with the central ﬁle.
 
◆
Your local copy will be more responsive than a networked local ﬁle because your access speed 
to your hard drive is much faster than it is across most networks.
 
◆
If anything bad happens to your network or your central ﬁle, such as ﬁle corruption, each local 
ﬁle is basically a backup that can be used to create a new local ﬁle. Simply perform a Save As 
operation and select the option to make this a new central ﬁle.
Using Worksharing Usernames
Each local ﬁle is automatically associated with your worksharing username once it is opened; 
after it is opened, it cannot be edited by any other user. By default, your Windows login name 
is used as your worksharing username. When you use the Create New Local option to open a 
worksharing-enabled project, the username is appended to the end of the local ﬁlename—for 
example, c05-Sample-Building-A16-Central_YourName.rvt.
It can be a good idea to adjust the naming convention for usernames to help team communi-
cation. In a smaller ofﬁce, it might not be as necessary, but in a larger ofﬁce or multi-ofﬁce team, 
clariﬁcation of element ownership is vital. One option is to change your Revit username to ﬁrst 
name, last name, and phone extension. Alternately, with the use of tools like Slack or instant 
messaging, including a slack handle or IM name would also aid communication. This way, team 
members can quickly identify and contact you if they need you to relinquish permission of an 
element. As Autodesk tools move more and more to cloud technologies, it is recommended that 
you coordinate any renaming of your A360 account with your larger team. Changing your user-
name can lead to other issues with online tools.
To make this modiﬁcation, follow these steps:
1. Close all your open projects ﬁles. You can change the username only when no work-
shared projects are open (you cannot change your username while it is active in open 
projects). After you change your workset username, you will need to create a new local 
ﬁle because the old local ﬁle is associated with a different username.
2. From the Application menu, choose Options at the bottom.
3. In the Options dialog box, select the General category.
4. In the Username ﬁeld, enter a new value (Figure 5.13). Click OK to exit.
The Worksets dialog box will be displayed if you used the Specify option to open the ﬁle. At 
this point in the exercise, you will still have only Shared Levels and Grids and Workset1, but in 
the future, you will have the ability to close any workset you may not need for editing in your 
work session. Click OK to close the Worksets dialog box.

ORGANIZING WORKSETS | 187
Figure 5.13 
Changing the default 
username
If you have signed in to an Autodesk® 360 (A360) services account, your username will auto-
matically switch to your A360 username, which will likely not include your telephone number 
but will give you access to other ways of communication such as instant messaging through 
applications such as C4R. A360 is an online service with Autodesk accessible from the upper-
right portion of your application window. If you are not signed in, you should see the button as 
a small ﬁgure with Sign In next to it. More information on the A360 account is provided later in 
this chapter.
Organizing Worksets
Now that you have enabled worksets and conﬁgured your project ﬁle for worksharing, you 
have the opportunity to further organize your model into more worksets. When dividing your 
project into worksets, it is important to think about the larger building system rather than try 
to isolate its individual components. In other words, worksets should not be used like layers in 
a CAD application. A good way to think about dividing up worksets is to consider the building 

188 | CHAPTER 5 COLLABORATING WITH A TEAM
elements and the number of people working on each of these elements. A basic breakdown of a 
project’s components might include the following:
 
◆
Exterior skin
 
◆
Core
 
◆
Interior partitions (in a larger building, by ﬂoor)
 
◆
Site
 
◆
Furniture, ﬁxtures, and equipment (FF&E)
 
◆
Linked ﬁles
This breakdown mirrors some of the roles and responsibilities on the project. There might be 
a small group working on exterior skin design and detailing, another group working on interior 
partitions, and a third working on FF&E. And for larger projects where you have linked ﬁles 
(possibly from other disciplines such as mechanical, electrical, and plumbing [MEP] or struc-
ture), it is helpful to associate those linked ﬁles with their own worksets.
How Many Worksets Do You Need?
A good rule of thumb is that you should have one or two worksets for every person working on the 
project (besides Shared Levels and Grids). On a small project with two or three people, you might 
only have three or four worksets. On larger projects, you could have a dozen or more.
Also keep in mind that once you have six to eight people working in a project, the performance of 
Revit slows somewhat, not to mention that you will spend a bit more time saving local ﬁles because 
each person actually saves twice (once to save changes to central and another to download everyone 
else’s changes). If your project is large enough to warrant more than six to eight people working con-
currently in the model, consider dividing the model into multiple ﬁles, as we discuss in Appendix B, 
“Tips, Trick, and Troubleshooting.”
Continuing with the Sample Building exercise ﬁle, open a local copy of the central ﬁle and click 
the Worksets button from the Collaborate tab or from the status bar. Click the New button and cre-
ate each of the following new worksets (keep the Visible In All Views option selected each time):
 
◆
Exterior and Structure
 
◆
Furniture
◆
Interiors
When you have done this, you should see a total of ﬁve user-created worksets, as shown in 
Figure 5.14. The worksets we have set up demonstrate how a typical breakdown might occur in 
a project of this size, but creating, deﬁning, and assigning worksets is by no means limited to 
this scheme. Depending on how you structure work in your ofﬁce, the worksets might be quite 
different. Note that once you complete the exercise, you will need to identify which workset you 
would like to make active. The Active workset is the one where any new model elements will be 
placed. You can make the workset active in the Worksets dialog box or with the Workset selector 
at the bottom of the screen.

ORGANIZING WORKSETS | 189
Figure 5.14 
Creating new worksets 
in the project
Should You Keep Workset1?
Why keep Workset1? Well, it is a great holding place when new users need to work on the project, 
but they are not certain to which workset they should assign the new elements they create. Tell 
them not to worry! Simply ask them to make Workset1 their active workset. After they have ﬁn-
ished their work, they can isolate all the elements they have created and then assign them to the 
right workset later (maybe with some oversight). You can even have a custom 3D view with only 
Workset1 visible to visually check whether elements are placed correctly.
As we stated previously, one of the biggest challenges facing teams new to Revit is under-
standing the difference between layers in a CAD application as compared to worksets. These 
teams typically want to try to manage worksets as they managed layers in CAD, which can 
result in worksets named Doors, Windows, Walls, and so on. Although this is effective manage-
ment in a CAD environment, you do not want to create all of this structure for worksets. Not 
only is it time-consuming, but it does not provide any beneﬁt.
Much like layers, the workset is a tool that the team will need to understand in order to use 
it successfully. Worksets should be structured by a team’s BIM coordinator or a project manager 
familiar with a BIM workﬂow. Ultimately, though, it is up to the team members to place ele-
ments in the proper worksets and ensure that project standards are being followed.
Moving Elements Between Worksets
With this chapter’s exercises, you are applying worksharing to an existing model; therefore, you 
will need to assign the existing model elements to the worksets you have created. The easiest 
way to move elements between user-deﬁned worksets is by using a customized 3D view. The 
following exercise will walk you through moving elements from Workset1 to the new worksets 
you have established, using a subtractive method to reassign the model geometry. This should 
be done by a single person who owns all the elements to ensure that no permissions issues 

190 | CHAPTER 5 COLLABORATING WITH A TEAM
occur when elements are being moved between worksets. This is also best done with only one 
person actively working on the ﬁle. If you have other users with local copies, ask them to not use 
the model while you’re moving elements.
To move the elements between worksets, follow these steps:
1. Open the default 3D view so you can see the entire model. By selecting a 3D view, 
you cannot accidentally select view-speciﬁc elements (such as elevation or sections) or 
datum—you’ll be selecting only model elements that can be assigned to user-deﬁned 
worksets. Now open the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box and choose the 
Worksets tab. Choose to hide all the worksets except for Workset1 (Figure 5.15), and click 
OK. This will turn off any elements that are visible on those worksets and allow you to 
“subtract” elements from this view as you move them to the nonvisible worksets.
Figure 5.15 
Isolating Workset1 
in Visibility/Graphic 
Overrides
In a worksharing-enabled ﬁle, the default 3D view is unique to each user participating in 
the model. The name of the view will be appended with the team member’s username, 
for example, {3D – BIM Coordinator}.
2. To select model elements and assign them to different worksets, you have a few options:
 
◆
For a smaller model, select a comfortable number of elements using the Filter tool 
and then modify the Workset parameter in the Properties palette. What constitutes 
a “comfortable” number of elements depends on your computer’s capabilities. As an 
example, if you window-select all the elements in the Sample Building model, you can 
click the Filter button in the ribbon and choose to keep the Furniture category active 
and uncheck the remaining items (Figure 5.16). Click OK. In the Properties palette, 
assign these elements to the Furniture workset.

ORGANIZING WORKSETS | 191
Figure 5.16 
Use the Filter tool to 
select speciﬁc object 
categories.
 
◆
For a larger model, it might ﬁrst be necessary to select some individual components 
and move them separately. Although the process remains the same (select elements, 
change the workset in the Properties palette), the selection system can vary. Another 
example of moving elements by selection would be to highlight an exterior wall and 
use the Tab key to select a chain of exterior walls. Those exterior walls can be moved 
to the Exterior and Structure workset.
 
◆
You can also select one or more types of elements in the model and use the 
Temporary Hide/Isolate tools in the view control bar. In the exercise ﬁle, try to 
locate a single window and select it. From the view control bar, click the Temporary 
Hide/Isolate icon and select Isolate Category. The boundary of the 3D view will be 
highlighted, indicating a temporary view setting, and you will see only windows. 
Window-select all the windows and then go to the Properties palette to assign them 
to the Exterior and Structure workset (Figure 5.17). Return to the Temporary Hide/
Isolate icon in the view control bar and select Reset Temporary Hide/Isolate.
Figure 5.17 
Assign the Workset 
property to multiple 
elements.
3. Using the same technique, you can move the remainder of the model elements to their 
respective worksets. When the default 3D view is empty, you will know that all the ele-
ments have been reassigned to new worksets.

192 | CHAPTER 5 COLLABORATING WITH A TEAM
For even easier workset management and quality control, you can create a 3D view named 
according to each workset. In each of these views, isolate the respective workset in the Worksets 
tab of the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box. After these views are established in the proj-
ect, you can periodically examine them to ﬁx any workset assignment mistakes. For example, 
someone might have placed plumbing ﬁxtures on the Site workset.
As you continue to assign model elements to worksets, you should be aware of some special 
conditions that might exist in your project. Some elements that can be selected and/or ﬁltered 
are actually subcomponents of other systems, and as such, their Workset property cannot be 
changed independently of the parent system. For example, you can select and ﬁlter curtain wall 
panels and mullions, but you can change only the Workset property of the curtain wall object, 
which is simply categorized as a wall.
Another special condition to look for is the presence of groups. Grouped objects will show up 
in the ﬁlter list as Groups and not in their respective categories. As an example, in Figure 5.18, 
the ﬁlter list shows Model Groups. Select only Model Groups in the Filter dialog box and use the 
Isolate Elements command in the view control bar, and you will see that the groups contain ele-
ments in the Casework and Furniture categories.
Figure 5.18 
Select only Model 
Groups in the Filter 
dialog box.
Moving Every Instance of an Element
A quick way to move every instance of an element type to a new workset is to use the Select All 
Instances option from the context menu. For example, select a chair in the model and right-click it. 
From the context menu, choose Select All Instances ➢ In Entire Project. Tis selects all the family 
elements in the entire model, allowing you to quickly move them all to the same workset in the 
Properties palette.
Another way to select all instances of an element is to right-click the family name in the Project 
Browser under the Families node. Simply navigate to your family in its proper category.

MANAGING WORKFLOW WITH WORKSETS | 193
At any point in this process, you can check your work by opening the Workset tab in the 
Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box and setting all but one workset to Hide. Use this 
method to inspect the contents of each workset.
The workﬂow described in the preceding exercise is necessary only if you have developed a 
model before enabling worksharing for collaboration. You can always start a new project enabled 
with worksets, and your team can develop the model simultaneously. The only important thing 
to remember is to ensure your team uses the appropriate active workset when working in a 
worksharing-enabled project. We will cover that in greater detail in the following section.
Managing Workﬂow with Worksets
Now that you or your BIM Coordinator has established a central ﬁle and organized your project 
into worksets, you can get ready to work in a local copy of the central ﬁle. Do you need to do 
anything special to begin working in a project that is enabled with worksets? No. You can sim-
ply start adding or editing content in your project because permissions are being automatically 
managed as you work. Just remember that you cannot edit any elements (2D or 3D) that some-
one else is already editing.
You do not have to make any worksets editable unless you want to prevent other team members 
from editing certain parts of your project until you have completed some work. Making the entire 
workset editable allows you to freely manipulate any of the geometry on that workset but precludes 
anyone else from making changes. By editing at the element level, you are only taking permission 
of elements you are going to change, leaving the other elements available for other team members. 
Which option you choose to employ will be dependent on the workﬂow you are looking to establish.
Do Not Work in the Central File
Once you create a central ﬁle, make sure that you never work directly within that central ﬁle. Only 
work directly in local ﬁles. Working in the central ﬁle will change the ﬁle attributes on the server 
and prohibit anyone with a local ﬁle from being able to synchronize with the central ﬁle and likely 
lead to a loss of work. Te possibility of losing a lot of work and eﬀort from team members exists, 
so it is safer to err on the side of caution by simply never opening the ﬁle.
The most important thing to remember when you use worksharing is that every element in the 
ﬁle and added to the ﬁle belongs to a workset. To make sure you are placing elements in the proper 
workset while working, know there are a few tools to ensure that you select the right workset.
One such location is on the Collaborate tab, where you initiated worksharing. As shown in 
Figure 5.19, the active workset is Exterior And Structure. This also tells you that the Exterior and 
Structure workset is not editable. What this means is that as a user, you have not taken owner-
ship of this workset. However, as we mentioned previously, you do not need to own a workset to 
add elements to it. It just needs to be active in this window.
Figure 5.19 
Setting the active 
workset in the ribbon

194 | CHAPTER 5 COLLABORATING WITH A TEAM
The second location is in the status bar at the bottom of the application (Figure 5.20). The 
drop-down menu on the left serves the same function as the Active Workset drop-down in the 
Collaborate tab, but it allows you to verify that the proper workset is active without the need to 
bounce between tabs in the ribbon and interrupt your workﬂow. From this location you can also 
change the active workset and even open the Worksets dialog box using the small button to the 
left of the drop-down menu.
Figure 5.20 
Setting the active 
workset in the 
status bar
Another helpful tool located on the Collaborate tab is the Gray Inactive Worksets button. This 
dims all the elements that are not on the active workset, helping you identify what elements are 
in your current, active workset. This is a temporary view state and will not affect any printing 
or other output.
In addition, you can always view an object’s workset assignment by hovering your mouse 
pointer over the object and viewing its workset in the status bar (Figure 5.21). This location 
will also display an object’s family and category. In the example shown here, the wall is in the 
Exterior and Structure workset, in the Walls category, and its type is Exterior - EIFS on Mtl. 
Stud. There are two locations in this ﬁgure where you can see the workset: one in the Properties 
palette and one in the status bar. When you hover over an element, you can also see the location 
shown in the tooltip.

MANAGING WORKFLOW WITH WORKSETS | 195
Saving Work
It will eventually become necessary to save your work and share your progress with others 
in the model. You have three ways to both save your work and view the work of others: Save, 
Synchronize And Modify Settings, and Synchronize Now.
Save  The Save button saves the work you have done to your local ﬁle only; the work is not 
shared or published to the central ﬁle. This can be a useful step if you are in the middle of 
a process and want to make sure your work is saved but are not ready to share the changes 
with the rest of the team. You can ﬁnd the Save tool either by choosing Application ➢ Save or 
by clicking the Save icon on the Quick Access toolbar (QAT).
Synchronize With Central ➢ Synchronize And Modify Settings  When you are ready 
to publish your work for the rest of your team to see, you have two command choices to 
synchronize with the central ﬁle. The ﬁrst of two synchronizing commands is known 
as Synchronize And Modify Settings. You can access this command in a couple of ways. 
The ﬁrst is on the Collaborate tab in the Synchronize panel, as shown in Figure 5.22. The 
Synchronize With Central ﬂyout button is located on the left of this panel.
Figure 5.22 
Synchronize With 
Central command on 
the ribbon
As an alternative, you can use the Synchronize With Central button located on the QAT. 
Both buttons perform the same action and will open the Synchronize With Central dialog box 
(Figure 5.23). This dialog box gives you some additional tools to assist your workﬂow.
Figure 5.23 
Synchronize With 
Central dialog box
 
◆
The Compact Central Model check box allows you to compact the model to save on disk 
space. It will take some additional save time, but it can temporarily decrease your ﬁle size 
signiﬁcantly. This should not be seen as a permanent solution to managing a large ﬁle, 
however. Compaction will decrease the ﬁle size, but use of the ﬁle will expand the com-
pacted elements. Tips and techniques for reducing ﬁle size are discussed in Appendix B.

196 | CHAPTER 5 COLLABORATING WITH A TEAM
 
◆
Five additional check boxes will be available (depending on what work you have done to 
the ﬁle) to allow you to relinquish or keep permission over the elements you have previ-
ously edited. Unchecking these boxes means that you will retain ownership over all the 
elements you currently own with the model. This can be useful if you are planning to con-
tinue working on the same elements and want to publish only recent changes of the model.
 
◆
You can add comments to the synchronization that can be useful for tracing potential 
model conﬂicts later in the production process.
 
◆
A ﬁnal check box, Save Local File Before And After Synchronizing With Central, allows 
you to save your changes locally, get any new changes from the central ﬁle, and then save 
locally again, ensuring that your local copy is up to date. This is the save option that takes 
the longest, and you might choose to uncheck this periodically if you have pressed for time 
or have a large ﬁle that typically takes longer to save.
Synchronize With Central ➢ Synchronize Now  The second command choice to publish your 
changes is called Synchronize Now. Choosing this option allows you to bypass the Synchronize 
With Central dialog box and simply sync your ﬁle immediately. With this option, you will be 
relinquishing all your permissions over any elements you have borrowed; however, you will 
remain the owner of any worksets you have made editable in the Worksets dialog box.
Saving at Intervals
You will be prompted to save your work at regular intervals. Once worksharing is enabled, you 
will receive an additional reminder to synchronize with the central ﬁle as well as to save your 
work (Figure 5.24). You can dismiss these dialog boxes by clicking Cancel at the lower right, but 
remember, it is a good idea to save regularly so you do not lose any work.
Figure 5.24 
Changes Not 
Synchronized With 
Central dialog box
If the Changes Not Synchronized With Central dialog box appears, you will have three 
options to choose from.
 
◆
Synchronize With Central, which will perform a save operation identical to that of the 
Synchronize Now command.
 
◆
Synchronize With Central And Set Reminder Intervals, which will synchronize your ﬁle 
and then pull up the Options dialog box, allowing you to set the intervals in which you 
receive this message.
 
◆
Do Not Synchronize And Set Reminder Intervals. Selecting this option will open the Revit 
Options dialog box where you can disable any further reminders.

MANAGING WORKFLOW WITH WORKSETS | 197
You can modify the reminder time shown in the dialog box at any time by clicking the 
Application button, selecting Options, and then choosing the General tab.
Loading Work from Other Team Members
It is possible to update your model and load work from other team members without publishing 
your own work back to the central ﬁle. This process, called Reload Latest, basically downloads 
the latest changes from the central ﬁle to your local ﬁle. Because you are only downloading con-
tent from the central ﬁle and not uploading, this process takes only a portion of the time a full 
SWC does. To do this, click the Collaborate tab on the ribbon, and choose Reload Latest from the 
Synchronize panel. The default keyboard shortcut for this command is RL.
Using Worksharing Visualization
Sometimes it helps to have the ability to graphically display worksets and their status in the 
project using the Worksharing Display tool found on the View Control bar (Figure 5.25). With 
worksharing visualization, you can visualize four different values: ownership status, individual 
ownership, updated elements, and workset assignment.
Figure 5.25 
Worksharing  
Display tool
To display any of the values, select the desired setting. When any value is selected, the temporary 
view condition is indicated by colored highlighting around the edges of the view window.
Select the Worksharing Display Settings menu item to customize the graphic appearance of 
the visualization overrides. The Checkout Status tab of the Worksharing Display Settings dialog 
box shows three values: what is owned by you, owned by others, or not owned at all (Figure 5.26).
Figure 5.26 
Checkout Status tab

198 | CHAPTER 5 COLLABORATING WITH A TEAM
The Owners tab of the Worksharing Display Settings dialog box illustrates which elements 
are owned by the users in your project. If you see users listed who do not have any enabled ele-
ments or worksets, you can remove them from the list by selecting their username and clicking 
the Remove User icon at the lower left (Figure 5.27).
Figure 5.27 
Owners tab
The Model Updates tab of the Worksharing Display Settings dialog box indicates changes 
to the central ﬁle that may not be apparent until you have synchronized with the central ﬁle 
(Figure 5.28).
Figure 5.28 
Model Updates tab
The Worksets tab allows you to color-code the model based on the workset assignment of 
all the building elements. Color-coding is also helpful for keeping track of your active workset 
(Figure 5.29).

MANAGING WORKFLOW WITH WORKSETS | 199
Figure 5.29 
Worksets tab
Finally, how often the display settings update in your project is up to you. To modify these 
settings, choose Application ➢ Options to modify the Worksharing Update Frequency option 
(Figure 5.30). Moving the slider to the far left will set the description below the Updates slider 
to Manual Updates Only, and the update will occur when you use Reload Latest or Synchronize 
With Central. Slide just a bit to the right and you will see that the display will update every 
60 seconds. Slide it all the way to the right and your display will update every 5 seconds.

Managing Workset Visibility in View Templates
As we described in the section “Moving Elements Between Worksets,” worksets can be used 
as a different way to visualize your project using the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box. 
Workset visibility can also be managed as part of a view template. To modify these settings, go 
to the View tab, locate the Graphics panel, and select View Templates ➢ Manage View Templates. 
In the View Templates dialog box (Figure 5.31), select V/G Overrides Worksets to modify 
the visibility settings in any view template. Refer to Chapter 4, “Conﬁguring Templates and 
Standards,” for more information on view templates.
Figure 5.31

Closing Revit
Eventually, you will need to close your project and leave for lunch, attend a meeting, or go home 
for the day. Do not worry—the project will still be there tomorrow. But in the meantime, it is 
important to understand how to close the project correctly so you do not accidentally retain 
permission over any elements and prohibit others from working in your absence. This situation—
where a team member has accidentally left the ofﬁce and not closed the project ﬁle or relinquished 
permissions—leaves the other team members without a way to edit elements for which the team 
member had permission or even request permission. So that you are not the unfortunate victim 
of their wrath upon your return, make sure you close the application properly.
The most thorough way to close the ﬁle is to simply quit the application completely. You can 
do this by clicking the X at the upper right or choosing Exit Revit from the Application menu. You 
will be presented with a dialog box in which you can choose to synchronize with the central ﬁle, 
save your changes locally, or discard the changes (Figure 5.32). Obviously, the best choice is to use 
Synchronize With Central, allowing your changes to be published and any objects you own to be 
relinquished; however, you might be in the middle of a design study and not ready to share your 
changes. In that case, you may choose to save locally and retain ownership of certain elements. 
Just be aware that no one else on your team can edit elements you own until you relinquish them. 
Our recommendation is to always relinquish all elements at the end of your work session.

MANAGING WORKFLOW WITH WORKSETS | 201
Figure 5.32 
Saving options when 
closing a local ﬁle
What if you were only reviewing the model and making some minor changes, and you do 
not want to save the changes? Close the ﬁle or application with any of the methods previously 
mentioned and select Do Not Save The Project from the Changes Not Saved dialog box. You 
will then be presented with another dialog box with two choices concerning borrowed elements 
(Figure 5.33). In the Close Project Without Saving dialog box, you can either relinquish any bor-
rowed elements and worksets or retain ownership of them. Clearly, the best choice is to relin-
quish all elements and worksets.
Figure 5.33 
Te Close Project 
Without Saving  
dialog box
Disabling Worksharing
In a few cases, you might decide that you have enabled worksharing too soon, or after enabling 
worksharing you would rather go back. Worksharing may be disabled as part of the Detach 
From Central functionality. This option can be found at the bottom of the Open dialog box. 
When you elect to detach a copy of the central ﬁle, you have the option to discard worksets, 
as shown in Figure 5.34.

202 | CHAPTER 5 COLLABORATING WITH A TEAM
Figure 5.34 
Disabling worksharing
If you choose to preserve worksets, the worksharing functionality remains in the ﬁle. This 
allows you to maintain any visibility conﬁgurations you have established that depend on work-
sets. Although this ﬁle retains the worksharing capability, it can no longer be synchronized 
with the original central ﬁle because it will become a new central ﬁle as soon as you save it after 
detaching. This method can also create a ﬁle for review by a project manager or quality control 
reviewer without the fear of changing the model accidentally. If you elect to discard worksets, 
you will lose any visibility settings established from worksets. You will also need to create all 
new worksets from scratch if you decide to enable worksharing again in the future.
Understanding Element Ownership in Worksets
One of the fundamental concepts in a model enabled with worksharing is the ownership of 
elements. When you directly edit an element in a project, you automatically take ownership of 
that element—as long as no one else owns it. Determining whether you own an element is fairly 
easy. Simply select it. If you do not own it, you will see a worksharing icon, as shown on the 
selected element in Figure 5.35.
Figure 5.35 
Te worksharing icon 
on a selected element
By borrowing elements, team members can take ownership of only portions of a workset, 
leaving the remainder of the workset to be edited by someone else. Taking ownership of ele-
ments in this style creates a more “take what you need” approach to editing and usually results 
in less overlap between team members.
Besides automatically borrowing elements when they are edited, you can obtain ownership 
of an element or group of elements in a few other ways.
 
◆
In the Worksets dialog box, you can make any workset editable. You then become the 
owner of the workset instead of borrowing elements within one.

UNDERSTANDING ELEMENT OWNERSHIP IN WORKSETS | 203
 
◆
Select any element or series of elements, and take ownership of them by clicking the work-
sharing icon.
 
◆
You can right-click any element in the Project Browser under the Families node. In the con-
text menu that appears, you can take ownership of families, groups, or views.
 
◆
You can right-click any element in a view and choose Make Elements Editable from the 
context menu (see Figure 5.36). You also have the ability to make editable the entire workset 
to which the selected object is assigned.
Figure 5.36 
Making an element 
editable using the con-
text menu
If you use any of these options, if the selected element is already owned by another team 
member, Revit will alert you and you will not be able to modify the element or make it 
editable.
Accidents Happen
As proﬁcient as any team is, accidents may occur on a project, and elements will get modiﬁed or 
deleted unexpectedly. It is important to know how to recover your work when these accidents occur.
On one project, someone new to Revit and new to the team was working on window details on a 
three-sided building. In the detailing process, the new team member accidentally deleted one of the 
walls in the project. Because the wall had sections and callouts associated with the geometry, deleting 
the wall also deleted elevations, wall sections associated with that wall, and the associated details in 
plan and section. When the new team member deleted the element, he was not aware of the mistake 
and performed a Synchronize With Central operation, publishing all the deletions to the central ﬁle. 
Fortunately, the error was caught before everyone else performed a Synchronize With Central, and 
the team did not have to resort to restoring the model from the previous night’s backup. Te team 
was able to use another member’s local ﬁle to create a new central ﬁle, thereby minimizing the loss 
of work. Once everyone on the team made a new local copy, he was able to get back to work.
Had the deleted elements been more isolated (like a conference room layout), recovery would 
have been much less invasive. In such a case, you simply create a group from all the elements 
you would like to save and then right-click the group in the Project Browser. You will have the 
option to save the group out of the ﬁle, which can then be inserted into a diﬀerent project ﬁle 
and ungrouped again.

204 | CHAPTER 5 COLLABORATING WITH A TEAM
Understanding Editing Requests
When working in a worksharing project, you do not always have to take ownership of an entire 
workset to begin editing elements. As we discussed earlier in this chapter, it is possible to take 
ownership of individual model elements. This process is referred to as borrowing. Remember, 
there can be only one owner of a workset but multiple borrowers of elements within a workset.
If you need to work on elements that already belong to someone else, you will receive an 
alert that you cannot edit the elements until the other person relinquishes them, and you will be 
given the option to place an editing request.
Understanding the editing request workﬂow is critical for multiuser teams; it allows users to 
transfer permission of objects without having to constantly save all their work to the central ﬁle 
and relinquish all worksets. Let’s look at this interchange of permissions in more detail.
Simulating a Worksharing Environment
Practicing with a multiuser environment is not easy to describe in text, although it is possible to 
conﬁgure on your own computer. If you would like to work through the exercises in this section, 
you can launch the Revit application twice. Remember to change the worksharing username in the 
application options in one of your Revit sessions before you create a new local ﬁle. And of course, 
remember to restore your original username once you have completed the training exercises. Tis 
will give you a good understanding of how workshared elements are controlled in a real-life project.
Placing an Editing Request
Imagine you are happily working away on your model in a worksharing environment and you 
try to edit an element that someone else owns. What do you do? When that situation occurs, you 
will be presented with a dialog box that allows you to request permission to edit the element 
from the other user (Figure 5.37).
Figure 5.37 
Placing a request for 
permission
Looking at the dialog box, you have two options.
 
◆
You can click Cancel and not take possession of the element and then focus your efforts on 
another part of the design.
 
◆
You can click Place Request to ask your team member to relinquish possession over the 
element in question. When you click Place Request, the dialog box shown in Figure 5.38 
opens.

UNDERSTANDING ELEMENT OWNERSHIP IN WORKSETS | 205
Figure 5.38 
Editing Request Placed 
dialog box
The recipient of an editing request will see a pop-up notiﬁcation appear at the bottom of the 
application, as shown in Figure 5.39. The notiﬁcation gives the recipient instant information 
about the element in question and who made the request and provides buttons to grant or deny 
the request. It also provides a Show button that ﬁnds the element in a view so the recipient can 
determine the most appropriate response to the request.
Figure 5.39 
Editing request 
notiﬁcation
If you happen to miss or accidentally close the request notiﬁcation, there is also a small 
visual indicator on the status bar at the bottom of your screen.
It indicates whether there are any outstanding requests (both to and from you). Clicking this 
icon opens the Editing Requests dialog box (Figure 5.40). Any requests indicated by an asterisk 
require you to Synchronize With Central before granting the editing request.
Figure 5.40 
Te Editing Requests 
dialog box
Granting an Editing Request
Let’s discuss the other side of this scenario: you are the recipient of an editing request and you 
are ready to grant it. Now, one of two things will happen. If you have not changed the element, 

206 | CHAPTER 5 COLLABORATING WITH A TEAM
you can simply click Grant and the permission for the element will be transferred to the request-
ing team member.
If you have modiﬁed the element or one that is dependent on or hosted by the element in 
question, you will be alerted that you will need to synchronize with the central ﬁle before 
the request can be granted. The team member who placed the editing request will subse-
quently need to use the Reload Latest command or Synchronize With Central to receive the 
recent changes, and then that team member can edit the most recent version of that element. 
Permission requests that require Synchronize With Central are ﬂagged in the Editing Requests 
dialog box by an asterisk next to the request.
After your editing request has been granted, you will receive a notiﬁcation similar to those 
shown in Figure 5.41. If the request did not require a Synchronize With Central operation from 
the other team member (as indicated in the left image in Figure 5.41), you can continue the editing 
command that prompted the request. Otherwise, you will need to use Reload Latest before you can 
continue the editing command. If you need to return to a view of the element or  elements related 
to the editing request, you can click the Show button. Click the X to close the notiﬁcation box.

cation of a granted

Getting Permission for Someone Else’s Objects
Tis situation may happen on one of your projects: someone leaves for a meeting or goes home 
without relinquishing permission of borrowed elements and worksets. Tis scenario would prevent 
other team members from editing any of the borrowed elements until that person returns to the 
oﬃce and synchronizes the changes with the central ﬁle. If that person cannot return to the oﬃce, 
there is a workaround for this problem. Te workaround will result in the loss of the work by the 
missing team member, but it will clear up all the permissions issues.
If the immediate team needs outweigh the potential loss of the missing person’s work, follow 
these steps:
 1. Open a new session of Revit.
 2. Click the Application menu, select Options, and choose the General tab in the resulting dialog box.
 3. Change the name listed in the Username ﬁeld from your username to the person’s whose permis-
sions you are looking to release.
 4. Create a new local ﬁle of the project and open it. Now simply perform a Synchronize With Central 
operation, and all the person’s elements will be available to the team to edit. Ten close the ﬁle.
 5. Before closing Revit, be sure to go back to the Application menu, click Options, and select the 
General tab so you can change the username back to your own.

UNDERSTANDING ELEMENT OWNERSHIP IN WORKSETS | 207
Relinquishing Permission
It is not always necessary to wait for a request from another team member to relinquish permis-
sion over your elements. Fortunately, there is a tool to do just that. On the Synchronize panel of 
the Collaborate tab is a button called Relinquish All Mine (Figure 5.42). This feature returns the 
permissions for any elements you have not edited back to the central ﬁle so they are available to 
the rest of your team.
Figure 5.42 
Relinquish All Mine
Using the Worksharing Monitor
If you are an Autodesk® Subscription customer, you will have access to a useful extension appli-
cation called Worksharing Monitor, shown in Figure 5.43. This tool is available from Autodesk’s 
subscription site, manage.autodesk.com. When you are working on a team project that is 
enabled for worksharing, this utility gives you real-time information about the users participat-
ing in the project ﬁle. It also has a convenient resources monitor to keep you informed of your 
computer’s available RAM, virtual memory, and disk space.
Figure 5.43

Monitor is avail-
able for Autodesk

208 | CHAPTER 5 COLLABORATING WITH A TEAM
Collaborating in the Cloud
Eventually you will need to collaborate with other designers. Maybe this partnership—if it is with 
your structural engineer or MEP designer—will require the both of you to share models. Maybe 
you simply need to share your modeling work with people within your own ofﬁce who are not 
Revit savvy enough to be able to negotiate their way through the software, and you are looking for 
an easy way for them to view and comment on what you have created. Fortunately, there is a way 
for you to not only share your model but also comment on models created by your team.
Autodesk has created a web-based resource to share and mark up Revit ﬁles. The site is A360 
Drive (360.autodesk.com). The site requires an A360 account, which you can register for on the 
website. Once signed up, you can sign in through Revit to take advantage of online applications 
like daylighting or cloud rendering or use the site as an online collaboration portal.
The site (Figure 5.44) allows you to upload and share models with collaborators. You can 
make models public or you can share them with only certain individuals.
Figure 5.44 
Viewing models 
online with A360 
Drive
Figure 5.45 
Using the A360 
online viewing 
engine
One of the great beneﬁts of the site beyond just document management and sharing is 
the ability for non-Revit users to be able to navigate the model in a read-only format. Using 
the sample model we will work on throughout this book, a non-Revit user can navigate any 
of the views within the model (plans, elevations, 3D views, and so forth) as well as spin the 
model around in an interactive 3D format. Figure 5.45 shows the interactive 3D view.

COLLABORATING IN THE CLOUD | 209
This is an easy way to share models and allow nonusers to make comments on preset views. 
The site works best with Google’s Chrome web browser and works on either a Mac or a PC.
Collaboration for Revit
Although the A360 Drive website allows you to upload and download ﬁles as well as view Revit 
models, it does not provide an alternative to true collaboration with Revit worksharing. A ser-
vice called Collaboration for Revit (C4R) allows teams to synchronize changes using Autodesk’s 
cloud services instead of a Revit Server Accelerator on your WAN.
Collaboration for Revit is a paid service that can be purchased per registered user. You can 
learn more about the service at www.autodesk.com/products/collaboration-for-revit.
C4R is an “entitlement,” which means it is an additional service that runs on top of Revit. 
This service allows you to collaborate within the same Revit model without having to be on the 
same network. As an example, if you are working on the architectural design of a large project 
with another design ﬁrm and both of you are in different cities, C4R will allow you to both work 
within the same model environment without the hassle of setting up VPNs, a Revit Server, or 
any sort of network sharing.
C4R can be initiated in the same way that worksharing can be: simply click the Collaborate 
button on the Manage Collaboration panel of the Collaborate tab. By clicking this, you’ll get the 
Collaborate dialog box (Figure 5.46). However, instead of selecting the Collaborate Within Your 
Network option, choose Collaborate Using The Cloud.
Figure 5.46 
Collaborating  
using C4R
Selecting this option will bring up an additional dialog box (Figure 5.47) called Collaborate 
using the cloud. Here you can give the model a name, and you will need to choose a location to 
publish the model to. Since you can be collaborating with different teams on different projects, 
it’s important to assign your new model to the right team.
Note that with any C4R project, it is recommended that you ﬁrst set up a site to host the 
model. Think of the site like a folder. This will keep you from having multiple models for mul-
tiple projects stored in the same location.

210 | CHAPTER 5 COLLABORATING WITH A TEAM
Figure 5.47 
Collaborating 
using C4R
Once the C4R model is established, additional users can be invited using the A360 web por-
tal. The limits you have to working in a C4R environment are the same as working within any 
other shared Revit project. You can still use worksharing and Synchronize With Central, check 
out elements or worksets, and so on. The primary difference will be opening your project. In 
Revit, there is an icon in the Open dialog box (Figure 5.48). Your central ﬁles will reside on the 
cloud in a location called BIM 360 Team.
Figure 5.48 
Opening a model 
using C4R
With your model saved to C4R, Autodesk is aware that it is not as easy any longer to just 
lean over and speak to one of your teammates about the project. With C4R models, team 
members have access to the Communicator (Figure 5.49). This multiuse dialog box allows 
several ways to stay in touch with team members. It will show you who is actively in the 
model, show you who is currently performing commands like Synchronize With Central, 
and give you a chat window for reaching out to your team members regardless of which 
ofﬁce they might reside in.

Te Bottom Line
Understand key worksharing concepts.  Once the team has created local ﬁles, it is neces-
sary to understand how to keep both the local ﬁles and the central ﬁle up to date as changes 
occur on the project. Doing so ensures that everyone is working from an updated and recent 
copy of the model at all times.
Master It  Once you have begun working in your local ﬁle, how do you publish your 
changes to the central ﬁle? How do you download changes from the central ﬁle to your 
local ﬁle?
Enable worksharing on your project.  Knowing how to activate and use worksharing is 
indispensable to working in a team environment using Revit.
Master It  How do you transition a single-user Revit ﬁle to a multiuser environment 
 using worksharing?
Organize worksets in your model.  There is no single rule for organizing worksets in your 
project models; however, they can be used to your team’s advantage. You can use worksets to 
better organize larger projects and for additional visibility control.
Master It  How do you assign objects to worksets? How do you change an object’s work-
set assignment?
Manage workﬂow with worksharing.  Once the central ﬁle has been created, you will need 
to organize and structure the model into logical worksets to maintain workﬂow with Revit.
Master It  How do worksets differ from layers in 2D CAD? What are some logical ways 
to create worksets within a model?

212 | CHAPTER 5 COLLABORATING WITH A TEAM
Understand element ownership in worksets.  Editing elements in a central ﬁle means you 
have sole ownership over further changes to those elements. Understanding the permissions 
is critical to working in a team.
Master It  How do you edit an element in the model if someone has already taken own-
ership of it in a worksharing environment?
Collaborate in the cloud.  Not all of your team members will be Revit-savvy and know 
how to use the tools. In addition, not everyone on the team will have a copy of Revit, but you 
might still need their input and comments on the design. Learning to leverage complemen-
tary tools to Revit is critical to keeping a project moving smoothly.
Master It  How do you use the cloud to get feedback from non-Revit users on a  
project team?

 Chapter  6 
 Working with Consultants   
 Whether you work on large or small projects—residential, commercial, or industrial build-
ing types—collaboration is an almost certain aspect of the workﬂ ow you will encounter when 
implementing BIM. This chapter discusses important considerations for interdisciplinary coor-
dination as well as the tools within Autodesk ® Revit ® software to help you manage the process. 
This chapter covers aspects of collaboration solely utilizing the Revit platform, and Chapter  7 ,
“Interoperability: Working Multiplatform,” focuses on collaborating with other software 
programs. 
 In this chapter, you’ll learn to

 Preparing for Collaboration 
 Working alone in the Revit environment will deliver measurable increases in productivity, 
 quality, and consistency; however, the true beneﬁ t of building information modeling (BIM) is 
the ability to effectively collaborate between design disciplines, share model data with contractors, 
and deliver useful information to facility operators. 
 The difference between these working paradigms has been described as  lonely BIM versus 
social BIM . Lonely BIM can be thought of as the use of isolated BIM techniques for targeted tasks 
such as architectural design or structural analysis. Social BIM is the act of sharing model data 
between project stakeholders in order to enhance collaboration while developing a building 
design. The importance of increased efﬁ ciency in collaboration is the underpinning for the goals 
set forth by organizations such as buildingSMART International ( www.buildingsmart.org ) or the 
UK’s BIM Task Group ( www.bimtaskgroup.org ). 
 The ability to support high-quality information exchanges necessitates the proper use of 
3D models and nongraphic data in a highly collaborative environment. Although we will be 
discussing collaboration solely within the Revit platform in this chapter, the buildingSMART 
Alliance and the National BIM Standard (NBIMS-US) stress the need for open interoperability 
between BIM applications. 
 Once a project team decides to participate in social BIM—either through a team’s desire or 
the requirements of a client—they must decide how to collaborate with BIM in a manner that is 
useful to all constituents throughout the project life cycle. Whether or not your client requires it, 
you should develop a BIM execution plan in order to set clear expectations related to the use of BIM.

214 | CHAPTER 6 WORKING WITH CONSULTANTS 
The buildingSMART Alliance (www.buildingsmartalliance.org), in an effort sponsored 
by the Charles Pankow Foundation, the Construction Industry Institute, the Penn State Ofﬁce 
of Physical Plant, and the Partnership for Achieving Construction Excellence (PACE), has cre-
ated a “BIM Project Execution Planning Guide” and template for a BIM execution plan. You 
can ﬁnd this information at the Penn State Computer Integrated Construction (CIC) website: 
http://bim.psu.edu.
One of the most critical parts of a BIM execution plan is the deﬁnition of the project goals 
and uses of BIM to achieve the stated goals. If you are just beginning your implementation of 
Revit software, you may be using it to create 3D visualizations, or perhaps you are attempting to 
increase your drafting productivity. Deﬁning clear and concise reasons for implementing BIM 
on each project will help you deﬁne where to concentrate your modeling efforts. According to 
the buildingSMART Alliance, “[A] current challenge and opportunity faced by the early project 
planning team is to identify the most appropriate uses for Building Information Modeling on a 
project given the project characteristics, participants’ goals and capabilities, and the desired risk 
allocations.” A listing of the common uses of BIM along with potential value opportunities and 
required resources is also available on the Penn State CIC website.
According to the American Institute of Architects’ “Integrated Project Delivery: A Guide,” 
a BIM execution plan “should deﬁne the scope of BIM implementation on the project, identify 
the process ﬂow for BIM tasks, deﬁne the information exchanges between parties, and describe 
the required project and company infrastructure needed to support the implementation.” To 
be clear, the development of such a plan does not imply the application of integrated project 
delivery (IPD). IPD is “a project delivery approach that integrates people, systems, business 
structures and practices into a process that collaboratively harnesses the talents and insights of 
all participants to optimize project results, increase value to the owner, reduce waste, and maxi-
mize efﬁciency through all phases of design, fabrication, and construction.” For the purposes 
of this chapter, we will consider only the collaboration and coordination between members of a 
project design team, not the interactions with a client or contractor.

Managing the Coordination Process
The coordination process in a Revit environment begins with linking multiple ﬁles to form a 
composite view of your building project. Even though smaller projects might be coordinated 
within a single Revit project ﬁle, most moderate to large projects will be designed by multiple 
disciplines or trades working in different ofﬁces. A project can be divided in many different 
ways to meet a variety of workﬂow requirements. Most often, each discipline will develop at 
least one separate Revit project ﬁle, and many of these project ﬁles will be linked into each other 
for reference. Because there are several workﬂow possibilities, this chapter will focus on the 
coordination among a traditional design team consisting of the following:
 
◆
Architect
 
◆
Structural engineer
 
◆
Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) engineers

MANAGING THE COORDINATION PROCESS | 215
The workﬂow within a traditional design team is more complex than you might assume. If 
you were to graph the dependencies and coordination between these parties (Figure 6.1), you 
would see a web of primary relationships (architect to/from structure, architect to MEP) and 
secondary relationships (structure to/from mechanical and piping).
Figure 6.1 
Te relationships

These relationships can be further parsed into physical and logical relationships. If we use 
mechanical and electrical as an example, you can see that a physical relationship means making sure 
a light ﬁxture is not interfering with the bottom of a mechanical duct, whereas a logical relationship 
means making sure the electrical design (created by the electrical engineer) properly accounts for the 
load of the heating coil in a variable air volume (VAV) box (created by the mechanical engineer).
It is the complexity of these possible workﬂow scenarios that makes this process prone to 
errors and illustrates the importance of proper coordination between the different disciplines of 
a design team. So, what are the tools that can be used for collaboration between Revit products? 
Three distinct tools are typically used in a collaboration scenario.
Linked Models  Linking models together using the Link Revit tool provides full visual 
ﬁdelity of the referenced content, showing the complete context of the other disciplines’ data, 
fostering a complete understanding of their geometry. The data can also be controlled and 
shown in any manner appropriate to the use. You can turn it on or off, half-tone the data, 
or enhance it with color or line pattern overrides. Linking also provides support for the 
Interference Check, Copy/Monitor, and Coordination Review tools.
Copy/Monitor  Copy/Monitor is a powerful tool available in all products built on the Revit 
platform and is considered the most intelligent of the coordination tools. It offers several ben-
eﬁts. It lets you link Revit ﬁles from other team members (structural engineers or MEP engi-
neers) and copy key elements from their model into yours. Once that link is created, you can 
monitor that relationship and know whether the element has moved or changed when you 
Certiﬁcation
Objective

216 | CHAPTER 6 WORKING WITH CONSULTANTS 
receive updated models from your team members. A basic example of using this tool would 
be copying the structural grid into your architectural ﬁle. If the grid moves or changes with 
subsequent updated models, you will be instantly alerted to the change. Note that it is not 
recommended to copy/monitor all the elements from a linked ﬁle. The suggested workﬂow is 
to only copy/monitor the key elements you need to track.
Interference Check  In many cases, the only workﬂow requirement is to verify that items 
from another discipline are not interfering with your items. The Interference Check tool can 
be used to check between categories within a single model or between linked models.
Indiana University BIM Requirements
In 2009, the University Architect’s Oﬃce at Indiana University (www.iu.edu) announced that it 
would require the use of BIM on all projects with a capital value of over $5 million. Accompanying 
the announcement was the release of the IU BIM Standards and Project Delivery Requirements, 
which included a BIM execution plan template and IPD template—developed under the guidance 
of Autodesk and SHP Leading Design (www.shp.com). Although the university’s BIM requirements 
seemed new at the time, the desire to ensure the maximum reuse of information had been evolving 
at IU for several years, beginning with its implementation of integrated GIS tools for campus and 
facility management in 1996.
One important excerpt from these requirements focuses on the organization of the interference 
checking (aka clash detection) process. Within the IU BIM Standards & Guidelines for Architects, 
Engineers, & Contractors, rules have been established for classifying clashes between modeled 
elements. Level One clashes are considered critical and include ductwork and piping clashing with 
ceilings, rated walls, or structure; equipment clearances interfering with structure are included in 
Level One as well. Level Two clashes are less critical but include casework clashing with electrical 
ﬁxtures and structure versus specialty equipment. Finally, Level Tree clashes are still important 
but are a lower priority. Tese include casework clashing with walls and plumbing interfering with 
mechanical equipment.
Tese requirements may be deﬁned diﬀerently by other clients, but it is critical to understand the 
importance of using interference-checking tools for logical groups of model elements. Checking 
for clashes throughout an entire model will yield a plethora of unusable data and will limit the 
eﬀectiveness of model-based coordination.
For more information, visit the IU BIM site at www.indiana.edu/~uao/iubim.html.
Given the range of available Revit tools for collaboration, they are not necessarily applicable 
to all interdisciplinary relationships. As shown in Figure 6.2, only the most appropriate tools 
should be applied to each collaborative situation. These situations are merely suggestions based 
on our experience. The needs for your collaborative workﬂows may vary.

Architect to Structural Engineer  The relationship between the architect and the structural 
engineer is becoming closer as we strive for lighter structures and more innovative design. 
In many respects, structural engineers may be affecting the building aesthetic as much 
as the architects. Thus, this workﬂow may be considered the most crucial and should be 
bidirectional.
Architect to Structural Engineer: Copy/Monitor and Coordination Review  By using 
Copy/Monitor, structural engineers are able to create a strong, intelligent link between 
the structural and architectural models. In doing so, they can easily track the changes in 
the architect’s model that will affect the structural design. Structural designers are also 
able to create geometry in their model using these tools, which can be directly or indi-
rectly related to architectural elements such as walls and ﬂoors.
Remember that coordination of relationships for datum (grids and/or levels) should be 
established at the beginning of a project. For example, does the architect “own” the levels 
and the grids—or will the structural engineer? Conﬂicts due to a lack of proper planning 
will negatively impact the effective use of the Copy/Monitor tools on your projects.
Structural Engineer to Architect: Interference Check  The architect’s primary require-
ment for the structural model is to include the structure in context and to know if the 
structure is interfering with any architectural elements. For this workﬂow, it is recom-
mended that the architect link in the structural model and use interference checking. The 
rules governing what clashes are considered critical may be established by a client’s BIM 
standards and protocols.

218 | CHAPTER 6 WORKING WITH CONSULTANTS 
Architect to MEP Engineer  The relationship between architecture and MEP is not quite as 
dynamic as that between architecture and structure but represents speciﬁc opportunities to 
beneﬁt from collaboration.
Architect to MEP Engineer: Copy/Monitor and Coordination Review   The MEP  
engineer needs to link in the architect’s model for context and geometry relationships 
and the avoidance of clashes. Copy/Monitor is used to copy and monitor the architect’s 
levels and rooms. These room objects take on the additional properties, such as light  
levels and airﬂow. Levels are required to copy or monitor the rooms.
MEP Engineer to Architect: Linked Models  The architect’s primary beneﬁt from link-
ing in the MEP model(s) is the ability to reference this geometry within the context of 
the architectural model and drawings. There is usually no compelling reason to use the 
Copy/Monitor and Coordination Review tools from the MEP on the architectural project, 
although interference checking may be required under certain circumstances.
Structural Engineer to MEP Engineer  This relationship is almost always best served by 
cross-linked models using interference checking. The most important aspect of collaboration 
between these disciplines is the early detection and correction of clashes.
Using Linked Models in Revit
The ﬁrst rule governing all Revit-to-Revit coordination situations is that all linked project ﬁles 
must be generated with the same Revit platform version. Linking an “older” ﬁle into a “newer” 
one will cause an irreversible upgrade to the older ﬁle.
In a worksharing environment with other disciplines, it is important to ensure that the 
computers of all team members working on a project have the same Revit build installed. As 
discussed previously in this chapter, a BIM execution plan should include an agreement on all 
modeling and coordination software to be used on a project, including the version of each listed 
program.
You can ﬁnd the build information for your Revit product by clicking the Help drop-down 
button in the InfoCenter and selecting About Autodesk Revit (Figure 6.3). The build appears at 
the upper right of the About Autodesk Revit dialog box.
Figure 6.3 
Linked ﬁles must use 
the same platform 
version, and all work-
sharing team members 
should use the same 
build. Te build num-
ber can be found in 
About Autodesk Revit.

USING LINKED MODELS IN REVIT | 219
Shared Positioning
In the collaborative process of sharing information via linked models, the coordinated position-
ing of each model is of paramount importance. To ensure accuracy, every project’s BIM execu-
tion plan must include agreement on a common coordinate system and origin. This section will 
help you develop a fundamental understanding of the coordinate systems within Revit so you 
can conﬁgure and manage them in your projects.
We will begin our description with a simple statement: there are two coordinate systems in 
every Revit project, project internal and shared. Each system has essential features and limitations.
Project Internal  Every Revit project has an internal coordinate system referred to in several 
places as project internal. The origin of this coordinate system is at ﬁrst marked by a Project 
Base Point; however, this reference point can be moved away from the internal origin. We 
discuss the Project Base Point in greater detail later in this chapter.
The project internal coordinate system cannot be changed, and your model should be con-
structed within a one-mile radius of the internal origin. The true origin in Revit is referred to 
as the Project Start Up Point, and the Project Base Point can be reset to this point by setting it 
to Unclipped, right-clicking the icon, and selecting Move To Startup Location.
A complementary component of the project internal coordinate system is the view orienta-
tion of Project North. This setting is the default and can be found in the View Properties of 
any plan. We strongly recommend that your model be created in an orthogonal relationship 
to the project view or as you expect the plans to be oriented on a typical sheet. Your project’s 
actual relation to true north will be established via shared coordinates.
Shared Coordinates  In simple terms, shared coordinates are just a way for the project 
team to use the same work point. In other words, the shared coordinate system consists of 
a single origin and true north orientation that can be synchronized between models and 
even Autodesk® AutoCAD® and Autodesk Civil 3D® drawings. In the diagram shown in 
Figure 6.4, you can see an architectural model and structural model linked together. Each 
model was created using a different project internal origin (not the recommended method), 
but their shared coordinates were synchronized.

tionship between proj-

220 | CHAPTER 6 WORKING WITH CONSULTANTS 
It is critical to establish the location of the Project Base Point and Survey Point as early as 
possible in a project. Once the project is underway, moving these elements without disrupting 
the project schedule is almost impossible. On larger-scale projects or campuses, many agencies 
(such as universities or other owners who have multiple buildings) are mandating where the 
Survey Point and Project Base Point should fall as part of their standards. It is recommended 
that both the owner and project teams should coordinate the location of the Survey Point and 
Project Base Point as part of the project kick-off process.
Limitations on Using Shared Coordinates for Exporting
Although you can use either Project Internal or Shared as the setting for Coordinate System Basis 
when exporting CAD formats, there are some limitations. If you are exporting sheet views, the plan 
data will always use the project internal coordinate system. Using the Export Views On Sheets And 
Links As External References option during export does not change this limitation. We recommend 
using plan views—not sheets—for issuing 2D CAD backgrounds to project participants who are 
not using Revit. Refer to Chapter 7 for more detailed information on exporting to other ﬁle types.
Acquiring or Publishing Coordinates
There are two ways to synchronize shared coordinates between linked projects: Acquire 
Coordinates and Publish Coordinates. A simple way to understand the difference between these 
tools is to think of them in terms of pulling versus pushing.
 
◆
Acquire = pull
 
◆
Publish = push
It is important to understand the situations in which you would pull or push coordinates 
between linked ﬁles. A typical workﬂow for establishing a synchronized, shared coordinate sys-
tem on a single building project is as follows:
1. A separate site model is generated in which the Survey Point (SP) in the Revit project is 
coordinated with geodetic survey markers or station lines. The site model is linked into 
the architectural Revit model. This ﬁle is located manually in a position relative to the 
building. Do not move or rotate your building to the linked site model!
2. From the Manage tab, select Coordinates ➢ Acquire Coordinates. Pick the linked ﬁle 
and the origin of the shared coordinate system, and the angle of true north in your Revit 
model will be synchronized with those in the linked ﬁle.
3. All engineers or consultants using Revit should obtain a copy of the site model and 
repeat steps 1 and 2. When linking other project models that have already been synchro-
nized with the site model, they can be placed using the Auto–By Shared Coordinates 
option in the Insert Link dialog box.

USING LINKED MODELS IN REVIT | 221
Acquiring Coordinates from a CAD File
A common scenario in a project workﬂow begins with the architect beginning a design model 
and receiving a 2D survey ﬁle in DWG format from a civil engineer. Te survey is drawn in 
coordinates that are geospatially correct but may not be orthogonal to true north. Te architect 
should create the model close to the internal project origin; however, the architect will need 
to ensure that the building and survey coordinates are synchronized for properly oriented 
CAD exports and for coordination with additional linked Revit models from engineers in later 
phases of the project.
Te architect will link the 2D CAD ﬁle into the Revit model but will ﬁrst manually place it—moving 
and rotating the CAD ﬁle to be in proper alignment with the building model. Once the link is in 
place and constrained (or locked), the architect will acquire the coordinates from the DWG survey 
by switching to the Manage tab, selecting Coordinates ➢ Acquire Coordinates from the Project 
Location panel, and then clicking the DWG link. Tis will not aﬀect any views that are oriented to 
project north—only those set to true north will display the orientation established by the coordi-
nates acquired from the survey ﬁle.
For a campus-style project in which you might be creating multiple instances of a linked 
building model, you would most likely use Publish Coordinates to push information from 
a site model into the linked building model. Here is how that would work in a hypothetical 
scenario:
1. Assuming a site model and building model were created in Revit, you would begin by 
opening the site model and linking the building model into the site.
2. Adjust the position of the ﬁrst instance of the linked building model to location A.
3. From the Manage tab, select Coordinates from the Project Location panel and then click 
Publish Coordinates. Pick the linked building model.
4. The Location Weather And Site dialog box will open, and you will create a duplicate loca-
tion named Location A.
5. Copy the linked building model as required for each subsequent location. Repeat 
steps 2 through 4 for each copy. As shown in Figure 6.5, there are three locations 
(Location A, Location B, and Location C) that represent each instance of the linked 
project model.
6. When you close the site model and open the building model, you can link the site model 
to the building using any of the named location references you pushed into the building 
model.

tions for a single linked

Using Project Base Point and Survey Point
Revit provides two graphic objects to identify the Project Base Point and the Survey Point. In the 
default templates, these points are visible in the ﬂoor plan named Site; however, they can also be 
displayed in any other plan view by opening the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box, select-
ing the Model Categories tab, and expanding the Site category, as shown in Figure 6.6. You can 
also use the Reveal Hidden Elements command in the view control bar to temporarily display 
these points in a 3D view.
Figure 6.6 
Te Project Base Point 
and Survey Point set-
tings are found under 
Site in Visibility/
Graphic Overrides.
Project Base Point  The Project Base Point (PBP) is a reference point that is usually located 
at the origin of the internal project origin. The PBP is used to deﬁne a common reference for 
project-speciﬁc annotation such as spot coordinates. The PBP cannot be used for exporting 

USING LINKED MODELS IN REVIT | 223
your project to CAD or Navisworks® formats. The only choices you have for exporting are 
Internal or Shared. Remember, the internal project coordinates cannot be modiﬁed, but you 
can move the PBP using the paperclip icon you will see when the PBP is selected. Let’s review 
what the paper clip icon means when you need to relocate the base point.
The unclipped PBP can be moved in relation to the internal origin, thus creating a second-
ary reference point for spot coordinates, spot elevations, and levels—as long as the measur-
ing parameter (either Coordinate Origin or Elevation Base) is set to Project Base Point in the 
respective type properties of such annotation elements. Moving the clipped PBP icon is the 
equivalent of using the Relocate Project tool, which moves the project relative to the shared 
coordinates system.
Unless your project requires the use of a secondary point of reference other than the Survey 
Point, we recommend you do not adjust the PBP and that you make sure your building model 
lies within a close reference of this point, such as the corner of a property line or intersection 
of column grids A and 1.
Survey Point  The Survey Point is the equivalent of a station pin or geodetic survey marker 
in a civil engineering drawing (Figure 6.7). This is the point that will be coordinated to real 
geospatial coordinates. For coordination with Autodesk® Civil 3D® software, the SP is used 
when a Revit project is exported to the ADSK ﬁle format.
Figure 6.7 
Te Survey Point can 
be considered similar 
to a real-world geodetic 
survey marker.
Specifying a particular location for the SP based on civil engineering data is not a require-
ment. For smaller projects, the SP and shared coordinates may never be used at all; however, 
they are critical in the use of analytical tools for daylighting and solar analysis.
To further expand your understanding of these points and what happens when they are modi-
ﬁed, we created a sample ﬁle for your reference. Open the ﬁle c06-Shared-Points.rvt, which you 
can download from this book’s web page (www.sybex.com/go/masteringrevit2018). In this ﬁle 
you will ﬁnd three copies of the Level 1 ﬂoor plan. One view is conﬁgured to display the project 
coordinates, another view displays the shared coordinates, and the third view displays a combina-
tion of the two. There are also two types of spot coordinates: one indicating project coordinates in 
which the values are preﬁxed with the letter p and the other indicating shared coordinates with 
the preﬁx of s. You can open these three ﬂoor plans and tile the windows (click the View tab,  
select the Window panel, and choose Tile, or type the keyboard shortcut WT) to get a better 
sense of how these points affect one another (Figure 6.8).

224 | CHAPTER 6 WORKING WITH CONSULTANTS 
Figure 6.8 
Using tiled windows 
helps you examine the 
eﬀect of project and 
shared coordinates.
In this sample ﬁle, you can explore the effects on your model’s coordinates of moving the 
Project Base Point and Survey Point. When selected, the Project Base Point and Survey Point 
have paperclip icons that determine the behavior of the points when you move them. Clicking 
the paperclip icon changes the state from clipped to unclipped and back to clipped.
The following list shows the possible point modiﬁcations and how they affect the project. In 
most cases you should not have to move the Project Base Point or Survey Point if you are using a 
linked Civil 2D or 3D ﬁle and acquiring the coordinates from the linked ﬁle.
 
◆
Project Base Point: Clipped
 
◆
Move the PBP.
 
◆
PBP coordinates change relative to the Survey Point.
 
◆
Project-based spot coordinates do not change.
 
◆
Model elements “move” relative to shared coordinates.
Moving a clipped PBP is the same as using Relocate Project—that is, the model elements 
maintain their relationship to the PBP, but the relationship of the PBP to the Survey Point 
is changed.
 
◆
Project Base Point: Unclipped
 
◆
Move the PBP.
 
◆
PBP coordinates change relative to the Survey Point.
 
◆
Project-based spot coordinates change.
 
◆
Model elements do not move.

USING LINKED MODELS IN REVIT | 225
Unclipping the PBP essentially detaches it from the internal project origin. Moving the 
unclipped PBP is used only to affect the values reported in spot coordinates set to the 
project origin base. It does not have any effect on exported ﬁles.
 
◆
Survey Point: Clipped
 
◆
Move the SP (Survey Point).
 
◆
SP coordinates do not change.
 
◆
Shared spot coordinates change.
 
◆
Model elements do not move.
The clipped SP represents the origin of the shared coordinate system. Moving it is the 
equivalent of setting a new origin point. Use caution if you must move the shared coordi-
nates origin if linked models already exist in which the shared coordinates have already 
been synchronized. In such a case, each linked model must be opened and manually rec-
onciled with the model in which the origin has changed.
 
◆
Survey Point: Unclipped
 
◆
Move the SP.
 
◆
SP coordinates change.
 
◆
Shared spot coordinates do not change.
 
◆
Model elements do not move.
Moving an unclipped SP essentially does not do anything. It does not affect spot coordi-
nates, and it does not affect the origin of exported ﬁles.
Use Pinning to Protect Coordinate Origins
An excellent way to prevent accidental modiﬁcation of your project’s coordinate systems is to pin 
them. To do so, you must ﬁrst make sure the Survey Point and Project Base Point are visible in a 
view (as we discussed previously in this section). Next, select each point and click the Pin button on 
the Modify panel when the Modify | Project Base Point or Modify | Survey Point ribbon appears.
Attachment vs. Overlay
Linked Revit models use what we will call a portability setting that is similar to the way Xrefs 
are handled in AutoCAD. Although this setting is not exposed when you initially link a Revit 
model, you can modify the setting by switching to the Insert tab and selecting Manage Links. 
Change the setting in the Reference Type column as desired (Figure 6.9).

226 | CHAPTER 6 WORKING WITH CONSULTANTS 
Figure 6.9

reference type 
of linked Revit 
models
Attachment  The Attachment option ensures that the linked model will be included if the 
host model is subsequently linked into other hosts. For example, if Project A is linked into 
Project B as an attachment, when Project B is linked into Project C, Project A will automati-
cally be included as well.
Overlay  The Overlay option prevents linked models from being included if the host model 
is subsequently linked into other hosts. For example, if Project A is linked into Project B as 
an overlay, when Project B is linked into Project C, Project A will not be included. When you 
initially link a model that contains other linked models with the Overlay option, you will be 
notiﬁed that those links will be invisible (Figure 6.10).

USING LINKED MODELS IN REVIT | 227
Linking Files with Worksharing
If you are using linked Revit models where one or more of the project ﬁles have worksharing 
enabled, there are a few guidelines to follow as well as some tangible beneﬁts, such as linked 
visibility control between worksets. Be sure to read more about worksharing in Chapter 5, 
“Collaborating with a Team,” before continuing with this section.
When you are linking worksharing-enabled ﬁles from consultants, you will ﬁrst need to 
decide whether you need to maintain the worksets in the linked ﬁles. Even though you may not 
have direct access to your consultants’ servers, the software will attempt to reconcile the loca-
tion of each project model’s central ﬁle location. We recommend handling each received project 
ﬁle using one of the following options:
 
◆
Open the project using the Detach From Central option, choose Preserve Worksets, and 
then save the project as a new central ﬁle on your server. Refer to Chapter 5 for speciﬁc 
instructions on this process.
 
◆
Open the project using the Detach From Central option, choose Discard Worksets, and 
then save the ﬁle.
If your team decides to disable worksets in linked ﬁles received from consultants, you will 
avoid any problems related to the central ﬁle not being found; however, you will not be able to 
extend workset visibility settings into the linked ﬁles or use worksets to selectively load content 
from the linked model into your host project. If you preserve worksets, you can continue to use 
worksets in the linked model to your advantage. For example, when you ﬁrst link a worksharing-
enabled model into your project, you can use the Specify option associated with the Open button 
in the Import/Link RVT dialog box, as shown in Figure 6.11.
Figure 6.11 
Use the Specify 
option to close work-
sets when linking.

228 | CHAPTER 6 WORKING WITH CONSULTANTS 
At any time throughout the development of the project, you can adjust the loaded work-
sets from linked ﬁles very easily. From the Manage tab or the Insert tab in the ribbon, click the 
Manage Links button. In the Manage Links dialog box (Figure 6.12), select one of the linked 
RVT ﬁles, and if it is a worksharing-enabled ﬁle, click the Manage Worksets button to open the 
Worksets dialog box. We describe this process in greater detail in the next section of this chapter.
Figure 6.12 
Access worksets of 
linked ﬁles from 
Manage Links.
In addition to the workset-loading control, you can apply visibility settings automatically to 
linked models—as long as the worksets in any linked ﬁles are named exactly as they are in the 
host ﬁle. For example, if you linked a model that had the default workset named Shared Levels 
and Grids and your host model also had that same workset, you can hide the workset in both 
the host and linked model in one step. Open the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box, select 
the Worksets tab, and then set Shared Levels and Grids to Hide. You will see that any datum 
objects assigned to that workset—in either the host or linked model—are hidden. You do not 
need to perform a separate visibility override on the linked ﬁle.
Although the automated visibility linking of worksets can be beneﬁcial, it can also be prob-
lematic when you need to coordinate content between the host and linked models. In the same 
scenario described previously, what if you wanted the Shared Levels and Grids workset to be 
visible in the host model but hidden in the linked model? This is common when you are coordi-
nating datum objects between architectural and engineering models. The grids and levels from 
a linked model should be visible for use with the Coordination Monitor tools described in this 
chapter, but then the linked references might need to be hidden. In this case, you might choose 
to access the Manage Worksets button discussed earlier and close the Shared Levels and Grids 

USING LINKED MODELS IN REVIT | 229
workset in the linked ﬁle. You could also adjust the linked view; however, this would require 
you to adjust every view in which the linked model appears. We discuss linked views in greater 
detail in Chapter 18, “Documenting Your Design.”
Using Worksets to Organize Linked Models
As we discussed in Chapter 5, we recommend that you create and reserve a workset for each 
linked Revit model, such as Link-RVT-Structure or Link-RVT-HVAC. This simple step will allow 
your team members to choose whether they would like any, all, or none of the linked models to 
be loaded when working on a host model. To enable this functionality, use the Specify setting in 
the drop-down options next to the Open button.
When the Worksets dialog box appears, select the worksets reserved for the linked models 
and set their Open/Closed status as you desire. The beneﬁt of using worksets to manage linked 
Revit models is the ﬂexibility it offers a project team. When a team member closes a workset 
containing a linked model, the linked model is unloaded only for that person—it does not 
unload for the entire team.
Expanding Workset Properties for Linked Models
Additional ﬂexibility can be leveraged with the Workset parameter in both the instance and 
type properties of a linked model. In a large and complex project that consists of multiple build-
ing elements where some of the elements are identical, each may consist of multiple linked 
models: architecture, structure, and MEP. Figure 6.13 shows a simpliﬁed representation of such 
a design where the Podium has one set of models and Tower A and Annex are identical to one 
another, as are Tower B and the Penthouse.
Figure 6.13 
Schematic represen-
tation of a complex 
project assembled with 
multiple linked models
Annex: Arch 2,
Struct 2, MEP 2
Podium: Arch 1, Struct 1, MEP 1
Tower A: Arch 2,
Struct 2, MEP 2
Tower B: Arch 3,
Struct 3, MEP 3
Penthouse: Arch 3,
Struct 3, MEP 3
In Figure 6.13, there are three Revit models that represent the podium and the two towers  
(A and B) for each discipline (Arch1, Arch2, and so on). There are multiple instances of several of 
the linked models. For each instance of a linked model, you can specify the Workset parameter 
so that the workset instance property represents the building element, and the type property 
reﬂects either the entire discipline or one of the discipline models, as in this example:
 
◆
Instance workset: Tower A
 
◆
Type workset: Link-Architecture1 or simply Link-Architecture
Using this example, you can choose to open the Tower A workset, which would load all the 
discipline models but only for Tower A, or you could choose to open the Link-Architecture 
workset, which would load only the architectural models but for all the building elements. 
You can modify the workset-type properties only after placing a linked model in your project. 
Access this setting by selecting an instance of a linked model and opening the Properties palette 

230 | CHAPTER 6 WORKING WITH CONSULTANTS 
and then click Edit Type. Although this functionality can offer a variety of beneﬁts to your proj-
ect team, it should be used with care and proper planning because it can adversely affect model 
visibility if you are using worksets for visibility manipulation.
Worksharing-enabled linked models also afford you the ﬂexibility to adjust the visibility of 
project elements for the entire project, without relying on individual settings per view or main-
tenance of view templates. For example, grids and levels are not usually displayed from linked 
models because their extents are not editable in the host model and the graphics may not match 
those in the host model. Without worksets, the owner of the host model would have to establish 
visibility settings for the linked model within all views and hopefully manage those settings in 
view templates. Assuming the owner of the linked model maintains the levels and grids on an 
agreed-upon workset such as Shared Levels and Grids, you will be able to close that workset in 
one place, thus affecting the entire host project. To modify the workset options for linked Revit 
models, follow these steps:
1. Open the Manage Links dialog box and switch to the Revit tab.
2. Select one of the linked ﬁles and click the Manage Worksets button.
3. In the Manage Worksets for Link dialog box, select the worksets you would like to close, 
click the Close button, and then click Reload.
4. Click OK to close the Manage Links dialog box.
Relative Paths of Linked Models
If your team is working in a situation where your project ﬁle(s) is regularly transferred between 
multiple locations throughout the design process, you may ﬁnd it diﬃcult to maintain linked ﬁles 
(they are automatically unloaded when the ﬁle is exchanged), even if you are using relative paths. 
To alleviate this problem, try keeping the linked models and CAD ﬁles within subdirectories of 
the central ﬁle. For example, if your central ﬁle is saved in W:\Architecture\BIM, try keeping 
linked CAD ﬁles in W:\Architecture\BIM\Links-CAD and linked Revit models from consultants in  
W:\Architecture\BIM\Links-RVT.
Summarizing the Beneﬁts and Limitations of Linked Models
Let’s review some of the beneﬁts and limitations of using linked Revit models. You should care-
fully consider these aspects not only when preparing for interdisciplinary coordination but also 
when managing large, complex projects with linked ﬁles.
The following list highlights some of the beneﬁts and limitations:
Tagging Elements in Linked Files  Most model elements from a linked model can be 
tagged in a host model. Linked views can also be used if the annotation exists in the linked 
model and needs to be displayed in the host.
Scheduling Elements in Linked Files  In the Fields tab of the Schedule Properties dialog 
box, check the option Include Elements In Links.
Copying/Pasting Elements from Linked Files  In a host model, use the Tab key to select 
any individual element within a linked ﬁle, and you can use standard copy-and-paste tech-
niques to create a copy of the element in the host model.

USING LINKED MODELS IN REVIT | 231
Hiding Elements in Linked Files  In addition to having full control of a linked model’s visual 
ﬁdelity through object styles, you can use the Tab key to select an individual element in a linked 
ﬁle and use the Hide In View commands as you would on any element within the host model.
The following list highlights some of the limitations:
Joining Walls  Walls cannot be joined between linked Revit models. Consider alternative 
graphic techniques such as using coarse-scale black solid ﬁll to mask unjoined walls.
Opening Linked Models  You cannot have a host model with loaded linked models open 
in the same Revit session as the linked model ﬁles. Either separate Revit sessions must be 
launched or the host ﬁle must be closed before opening a linked model. If you choose not 
to follow either of these options and open the link in your current session, the linked model 
will be unloaded and need to be reloaded after the edits are made.
Using Linked Models—Exercises
Before you begin the exercises in this chapter, download the related ﬁles from this book’s web 
page. The project ﬁles in each section’s exercise should be saved because the lessons will build 
on the data. In this ﬁrst exercise, you will do the following:
 
◆
Link the architectural model to a structural project.
 
◆
Establish shared coordinates.
The structural model is essentially a blank project with a few element types speciﬁcally built 
for this chapter’s lessons. Let’s get started working with shared coordinates.
1. Open the sample project ﬁle c06-1-Structure.rvt or c06-1-Structure-Metric.rvt 
and activate the Level 1 ﬂoor plan.
2. Switch to the Insert tab and select Link Revit.
On the Revit tab of the Manage Links dialog box, click the Add button to add a new 
linked model. To make the steps easier to follow, the rest of this chapter will use the Link 
Revit button on the Insert tab, but both buttons will give you the same result.
3. Navigate to the ﬁle c06-2-Architecture.rvt or c06-2-Architecture-Metric.rvt.
4. Set the Positioning option to Auto – Center To Center and click Open.
5. Activate the South elevation view and use the Align tool to bring the linked model’s 
Level 1 down to align with Level 1 in the host model if necessary.
Remember, linked models should be aligned to the geometry in the host model. The 
modeled elements in the host model should be as close to the internal project origin as 
possible.
6. Switch to the Manage tab, and from the Project Location panel, select Coordinates ➢ 
Acquire Coordinates. Pick the linked model.
The elevation value displayed in the level within the host ﬁle has changed to match the 
shared elevation in the linked ﬁle. This is because the Elevation Base parameter of the 
level’s type properties has been set to Survey Point.
7. Save the project ﬁle for subsequent exercises in this chapter.

232 | CHAPTER 6 WORKING WITH CONSULTANTS 
Modifying Element Visibility in Linked Files
Once you have linked one or more Revit ﬁles into your source project ﬁle, you may want to 
adjust the visibility of elements within the linked ﬁles. By default, the display settings in the 
Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box are set to By Host View for linked ﬁles, which means 
model objects in the linked ﬁles will adopt the same appearance as the host ﬁle. In the follow-
ing exercise, we will show you how to customize these settings to turn the furniture off in the 
linked ﬁle and then display the room tags:
1. Continue this exercise with the structural model that you saved with the linked architec-
tural model.
2. Activate the Level 1 ﬂoor plan from the Project Browser.
3. Go to the View tab in the ribbon, locate the Graphics panel, and select Visibility/Graphics. 
In the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box, select the Revit Links tab.
You will see the linked architectural model listed as an expandable tree. Click the plus 
sign next to the name of the linked ﬁle, and you will see a numbered instance of the link. 
This allows you to customize the visibility for each instance of a linked ﬁle if you have 
multiple copies of the link in the host ﬁle.
4. In the row displaying the name of the linked ﬁle, click the button in the Display Settings 
column that is labeled By Host View.
Doing so opens the RVT Link Display Settings dialog box.
5. To begin customizing the display of elements in the linked ﬁle, you must ﬁrst choose the 
Custom option in the Basics tab, as shown in Figure 6.14. This enables all the options in 
each tab of the RVT Link Display Settings dialog box.
Figure 6.14 
Enable all custom 
display settings for a 
linked RVT ﬁle.

USING LINKED MODELS IN REVIT | 233
6. Select the Model Categories tab and choose <Custom> in the drop-down list at the top of 
the dialog box, as shown in Figure 6.15.
Figure 6.15 
Enable custom display 
settings for model 
categories of a linked 
RVT ﬁle.
7. Clear the check marks from the following categories: Casework, Furniture, and Furniture 
Systems.
8. Click OK to close all open dialog boxes.
You should observe that all the furniture and casework from the linked architecture ﬁle are 
no longer visible in the Level 1 ﬂoor plan. In a standard architecture-to-structure collaboration 
scenario, the structural engineer is likely to have a view template in which typical architectural 
elements are already hidden. In such a case, the default By Host View settings would be sufﬁ-
cient. The previous exercise illustrates a scenario where additional visual control is required.
Using Linked Views
Whereas the previous exercise focused on the display of model elements, a slightly different 
approach is required to use annotation elements from a linked ﬁle. In the following exercise, we 
will show you how to display the room tags from the linked architectural model. Many other 
tags can be applied to linked model elements. Here are the steps:
1. Continue with the structural model saved from the previous exercise and make sure you 
have activated the Level 1 ﬂoor plan.
2. Open the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box and select the Revit Links tab.

234 | CHAPTER 6 WORKING WITH CONSULTANTS 
3. The button in the Display Settings column should be labeled as Custom based on the pre-
vious exercise. Click the Custom button to open the RVT Link Display Settings dialog box.
4. Select the Basics tab and click the Linked View drop-down box. You will see the ﬂoor 
plans available for reference in the linked ﬁle. Only view types similar to the current 
view in the host ﬁle will be available for use as a linked view.
5. Select the linked view named Level 1-A-Anno.
6. Click OK to close all open dialog boxes.
After completing these steps, you should see the room tags from the linked architectural ﬁle 
in the host ﬁle. Remember that you can tag other model elements in linked ﬁles. Try using the 
Tag By Category tool to place some door tags on the linked architectural model.
Using the Coordination Tools
Once you have established the conﬁguration of linked Revit models for your project, the next 
step is to create intelligently bound references between speciﬁc elements within the models. In 
the past, CAD users might have referenced ﬁles containing grid lines or level lines to establish a 
level of coordination between one user’s data and another’s. These elements in CAD are merely 
lines—not datum objects as they are in a Revit model. If these referenced elements were modi-
ﬁed in a CAD setting, the graphic appearance of the referenced lines would update, but there 
would be no additional automated response to the geometry. It would be the responsibility of 
the recipient to update any referring geometry in their host ﬁles.
The coordination tools in Revit—Copy/Monitor and Coordination Review—allow a project 
team to ensure a high degree of quality control while achieving it at an increased level of pro-
ductivity. These tools can function on datum (levels and grids) as well as model elements such 
as columns, walls, ﬂoors, and ﬁxtures. The Copy/Monitor command is used ﬁrst to establish the 
intelligent bonds between linked elements and host elements, whereas the Coordination Review 
command automatically monitors differences between host and linked elements that were pre-
viously bound with the Copy/Monitor command.
Although these tools are indeed powerful and have no similarities to CAD workﬂows of 
the past, it is important to employ proper planning and coordination with your design team. The 
familiar adage of “quality over quantity” holds true for the implementation of coordination 
tools. It may not be necessary to create monitored copies of all structural elements within the 
architectural model. How would these affect project-wide quantity takeoffs for the sake of 
minor improvements in graphic quality?
We reiterate the necessity of developing a BIM execution plan to determine important aspects 
of the collaboration process. When using speciﬁc coordination tools such as those in Revit, 
teams might plan on issues such as these:
 
◆
Who is the “owner” of grids and levels?
 
◆
Who is the “owner” of ﬂoor slabs?
 
◆
Are structural walls copied, monitored, or just linked?
 
◆
How often are models exchanged?
 
◆
How are coordination conﬂicts resolved?

USING THE COORDINATION TOOLS | 235
A seemingly powerful BIM tool will not replace the need for professional supervision and 
the standard of care implicit to respective disciplines in the building industry. Thus, there is no 
substitution for the most important part of effective collaboration: communication. Without open 
and honest communication, the coordination tools will discover conﬂicts, but the results may be 
ignored, dismissed, or overwritten to the detriment of the team’s progress.
Using the Copy/Monitor Command
The Copy/Monitor command allows you to create copies of linked elements for better graphic 
control of the elements while maintaining an intelligent bond to the linked elements. If the 
linked element changes in a subsequent iteration of the project ﬁle, the changes are detected in 
the Coordination Review tool, which we will discuss next.
With the structural model saved from the exercises in the “Using Linked Models—Exercises” 
section, switch to the Collaborate tab and select Copy/Monitor ➢ Select Link. Pick the linked 
architectural model, and the ribbon will change to Copy/Monitor mode. Click the Options icon 
to open the dialog box shown in Figure 6.16.

Element tabs available 
for Copy/Monitor in

As shown in Figure 6.16, the Copy/Monitor Options dialog box in Revit is divided into ﬁve 
tabs representing the elements available to be copied and/or monitored. For each element tab, 
there is a list called Categories And Types To Copy. As shown in Figure 6.17, the Floors tab lists 

236 | CHAPTER 6 WORKING WITH CONSULTANTS 
the available ﬂoor types in the linked model in the left column and host model ﬂoor types in 
the right column. Notice that any of the linked types can be speciﬁed with the option Don’t 
Copy This Type. This feature can be used for quality control if your project’s BIM execution 
plan states that certain elements are not to be copied. For example, if walls are not to be copied, 
switch to the Walls tab and set all linked wall types to Don’t Copy This Type. You can also use 
the option Copy Original Type if the element type exists in the linked ﬁle but not in the host ﬁle. 
After one or more of these elements are selected using Copy/Monitor, the type mapping will be 
synchronized.
Figure 6.17 
Te Copy/Monitor 
Options dialog box 
allows customiza-
tion for intelligent 
collaboration.
At the bottom of the Copy/Monitor Options dialog box, you will ﬁnd a section called 
Additional Copy Parameters for each element tab (refer to Figures 6.16 and 6.17). The additional 
parameters are different for each element category. For example, when levels are copied and 
monitored, an offset and naming preﬁx can be applied to accommodate the difference between 
the ﬁnish ﬂoor level in a linked architectural model and the top-of-steel level in the host struc-
tural model.
Let’s take a closer look at each of the element category options available for the Copy/
Monitor tool.
Levels  In most cases, the difference between the location of a structural level and an archi-
tectural level may lead to the presumption that you would not want to copy levels between 
ﬁles. However, maintaining an offset between linked and host levels can be quite desirable. 

USING THE COORDINATION TOOLS | 237
Keep in mind that the offset will apply to all copy/monitor selections. Thus, if a structural 
level needs to be offset by a different value, create the level in the host model and use the 
Monitor command to create the intelligent bond to the linked model’s level. The difference 
will be maintained through any modiﬁcations in the linked model.
Grids  Copying the grids is usually a strong workﬂow. You can use the options on these 
tabs to convert the grid bubbles used by the architect into those used by the structural engi-
neer. It is also possible to add a preﬁx to the grid names. For instance, you could add the 
value S- in the preﬁx ﬁeld, and then grid A from the architectural model will come into the 
structural model as S-A.
Columns  The structural engineer can choose to replace any column—architectural or 
structural—in the architectural model with an appropriate structural column; however, this 
implies that the architect will maintain an understanding of where differentiating column 
types would exist. Realistically, the structural elements should exist only in the structural 
engineer’s model and then link into the architectural model. The architect may then choose 
to either copy/monitor the linked structural columns with architectural columns (which act 
as ﬁnish wrappers) or place architectural columns along the monitored grid lines. In the lat-
ter option, architectural columns will move along with changes in grid line locations but will 
not update if structural columns are removed in the linked model.
Walls and Floors  Similar to columns, structural walls that are important to the coordina-
tion process may be better managed in the structural model and linked into the architectural 
model. If you decide to use a copy/monitor relationship for these types of elements, it is best 
to create uniquely named wall types for structural coordination. Name such wall types in a 
manner that makes them display at the top of the list in the Copy/Monitor Options dialog 
box. You can do so by adding a hyphen (-) or underscore (_) at the beginning of the wall  
type name.
Finally, make sure you select the check box Copy Windows/Doors/Openings for walls or 
Copy Openings/Inserts for ﬂoors so that you also get the appropriate openings for those 
components in the monitored elements.
Using the Copy/Monitor Command—Exercise
Continue with the structural model saved in the previous exercise in this chapter. In this exer-
cise, you will do the following:
 
◆
Use Copy/Monitor to establish new levels and grids.
 
◆
Use Copy/Monitor to create ﬂoors.
 
◆
Link the new structural model back to the architectural model.
 
◆
Use the Monitor option for grids in the architectural model.
These steps will establish the intelligent bonds between elements in the host ﬁle with the 
related elements in the linked model. With the structural model open, activate the South eleva-
tion view. Then follow these steps:
1. Switch to the Collaborate tab and select Copy/Monitor ➢ Select Link. Choose the linked 
model.
2. On the Copy/Monitor tab, click the Options button.

238 | CHAPTER 6 WORKING WITH CONSULTANTS 
3. Select the Levels tab, and under Categories And Types To Copy, make sure the rows 
under New Type are set to TOS Head (Survey Pt). In the Additional Copy Parameters sec-
tion, set the following options:
 
◆
Offset Level: –0′ –6″ (-150 mm)
 
◆
Add the preﬁx (note the order in the dialog box) to Level Name: T.O.S.
4. Select the Grids tab, and under Categories And Types To Copy, make sure the rows under 
New Type are set to 1/4″ Square (6.5 mm Square).
5. Select the Floors tab and set the following options under Categories And Types To Copy:
 
◆
Arch Slab 6″ (150 mm): LW Concrete on Metal Deck
 
◆
Set all other entries under Original Type to Don’t Copy This Type.
Remember that you can select multiple rows in the Categories And Types To Copy list by 
pressing the Shift key while selecting a range of rows. You may then make a selection in 
the New Type column for any row, and all the selected rows will be modiﬁed.
In the Additional Copy Parameters section, set the following option:
 
◆
Copy Openings/Inserts: Yes (checked)
6. Click OK to close the Copy/Monitor Options dialog box.
7. From the Copy/Monitor tab of the ribbon, choose the Copy button.
8. Select the Level 2 and Roof levels in the linked model. Levels in the host model should be 
created 6″ (150 mm) below the linked levels with the preﬁx T.O.S. (Top Of Structure).
There is already a Level 1 in the host model. You will need to use the Monitor tool to 
establish a relationship to Level 1 in the linked model.
9. From the Copy/Monitor tab of the ribbon, choose the Monitor button and select Level 1 in 
the host model.
You can only select levels in the host model for the ﬁrst pick.
10. Select Level 1 in the linked model to complete the monitored relationship.
You will see an icon appear near the midpoint of the level indicating that it is now moni-
toring the level in the linked model.
11. Activate Section 1 and return to Copy mode by clicking the Copy button in the Copy/
Monitor tab of the ribbon.
12. Select the ﬂoor in the linked model at Level 2.
13. Activate the Level 1 ﬂoor plan and make sure the Copy tool is still active. Check the 
Multiple option in the Options bar.
14. Select all the visible grids using any selection method you prefer.

USING THE COORDINATION TOOLS | 239
15. Click the Finish button in the Options bar to complete the multiple copy process for the 
grids. Do not click the Finish icon in the Copy/Monitor tab of the ribbon without ﬁnish-
ing the Multiple selection mode ﬁrst.
16. Click the Finish icon in the Copy/Monitor tab of the ribbon to exit Copy/Monitor mode.
If you now select any of the grids or levels in the host ﬁle, you will see a monitor icon near the 
center of the element. This icon indicates that the intelligent bond has been created between  
the host and the linked element and will evaluate any modiﬁcations in the linked ﬁle whenever 
the ﬁle is reloaded.
Save and close the structural model and then open the architectural model,  
c06-2-Architecture.rvt or c06-2-Architecture-Metric.rvt. Using the procedures you 
have learned in this chapter, link the structural ﬁle into the architectural model. Placement 
should be done in the Level 1 ﬂoor plan using Auto – By Shared Coordinates positioning.
Use the Copy/Monitor tools in Monitor mode to establish the relationships of the grids 
between host and linked models. Doing so will ensure that changes to grids in either model will 
be coordinated.
Using the Coordination Review Tool
After intelligent connections have been established between elements in linked models, it is the 
purpose of the Coordination Review tool to support the workﬂow when datum or model ele-
ments are modiﬁed. This tool was designed to allow the recipient of linked data to control how 
and when elements in host models are modiﬁed based on changes in the linked models.
When a linked model is reloaded—which will happen automatically when the host model 
is opened or when you manually reload the linked model in the Manage Links dialog box— 
monitored elements will check for any inconsistencies. If any are found, you will see a warning 
message that a linked instance needs a coordination review.
The Coordination Review warning is triggered when any of the following scenarios occur:
 
◆
A monitored element in the linked model is changed, moved, or deleted.
 
◆
A monitored element in the host model is changed, moved, or deleted.
 
◆
Both the original monitored element and the copied element are changed, moved, or 
deleted.

240 | CHAPTER 6 WORKING WITH CONSULTANTS 
 
◆
A hosted element (door, window, opening) is added, moved, changed, or deleted in a moni-
tored wall or ﬂoor.
 
◆
The copied element in the host ﬁle is deleted.
To perform a coordination review, switch to the Collaborate tab and click Coordination 
Review ➢ Select Link. After picking one of the linked models, you will see the Coordination 
Review dialog box, which lists any inconsistencies in monitored elements (Figure 6.18).
Figure 6.18 
Te Coordination 
Review dialog box 
lists inconsistencies in 
monitored elements.
For each of the changes detected in the Coordination Review dialog box, one of the follow-
ing actions can be applied. Actions that result in changes to elements will be applied only to the 
host model; they do not modify elements in a linked model. Also, not all options are available 
for all monitored elements.
Postpone  Takes no action on the monitored element and changes the message status so that 
it can be ﬁltered out or considered later.
Reject  Select this action if you believe the change made to the element in the linked ﬁle is 
incorrect. A change must then be made to the element in the linked ﬁle.
Accept Difference  Accepts the change made to the element and updates the relationship. 
For example, if a pair of grids was 8″ (200 mm) apart and one was moved to 12″ (300 mm) 
away, the change would be accepted and the relationship would now consist of a dimen-
sional offset.
Modify, Rename, Move  The command name changes based on the action. If the name 
of the monitored element has changed, the command reads Rename. If a column or level is 
moved, the command is Move. If a grid is changed or moved, the command is Modify.

USING THE COORDINATION TOOLS | 241
Ignore New Elements  A new hosted element has been added to a monitored wall or ﬂoor. 
Select this action to ignore the new element in the host. It will not be monitored for changes.
Copy New Elements  A new hosted element has been added to a monitored wall or ﬂoor. 
Select this action to add the new element to the host and monitor it for changes.
Delete Element  A monitored element has been deleted. Select this action to delete the cor-
responding element in the current project.
Copy Sketch  The sketch or boundary of a monitored opening has changed. Select this 
action to change the corresponding opening in the current project.
Update Extents  The extents of a monitored element have changed. Select this action to 
change the corresponding element in the current project.
As you can see, Coordination Review can be a powerful tool to support the collaboration 
process. Remember that such a tool may not be appropriate for all elements at all times. For 
example, instead of copying and monitoring columns and grids, it may be sufﬁcient to copy and 
monitor only grids because the columns placed in your host model will move with the grids 
anyway.
Using the Coordination Review Tool—Exercise
In this exercise, you will use two ﬁles that have already been linked together with  
monitored elements between both ﬁles. You can download the ﬁles c06-Review-Arch.rvt  
or c06-Review-Arch-Metric.rvt (architectural model) and c06-Review-Stru.rvt or  
c06-Review-Stru-Metric.rvt (structural model) from this book’s web page. In this exercise, 
you will do the following:
 
◆
Modify elements in the architectural model.
 
◆
Use Coordination Review to address these changes in the structural model.
Remember that you cannot have a host model and a linked model open in the same  
Revit session. To make this lesson easier, you can launch a second Revit session. Open  
c06-Review-Arch.rvt or c06-Review-Arch-Metric.rvt in one session and  
c06-Review-Stru.rvt or c06-Review-Stru-Metric.rvt in the other. Then follow  
these steps:
1. In the architectural model, activate the Level 1 ﬂoor plan and make the following 
modiﬁcations:
 
◆
Move grid line F to the north by 2′-0″ (600 mm).
 
◆
Rename grid 6 to 8.
2. Save the architectural model and switch to the structural model. Open the Manage Links 
window, select the linked architectural model, and click Reload From. Browse to the 
downloaded Structural ﬁle and reload it. Once the ﬁle is done reloading, you are pre-
sented with the Coordination Review warning. Click OK to close the dialog box and then 
click OK to close the Manage Links dialog box.
3. In the structural project, activate the Level 1 ﬂoor plan, and then switch to the Collaborate 
tab and choose Coordination Review ➢ Select Link. Select the linked architectural model.

242 | CHAPTER 6 WORKING WITH CONSULTANTS 
4. When the Coordination Review dialog box opens, you will see changes to monitored 
elements detected in the reloaded architectural model. You may need to expand some of 
the statuses and categories to reveal the detected change and the drop-down list under 
the Action column.
5. Apply the appropriate modifying action to each of the detected changes. (Modify the 
moved grid, and rename the numbered grid.)
6. Click Apply and OK to close the dialog box.
In the previous exercise, you might have noticed the appearance of a monitored ﬂoor sketch. 
Why did a ﬂoor sketch change if you only moved a grid and renamed another? The answer lies 
in constraints and relationships. The exterior wall in the architectural model was constrained 
to be 2′-0″ (600 mm) offset from grid line F. When it was moved, the exterior wall was moved 
to maintain the offset. The sketches of the model’s ﬂoor slabs were created using the Pick Walls 
tools, creating an intelligent relationship to the wall. The modiﬁed grid affected the wall, which 
modiﬁed the ﬂoor, and the Coordination Monitor tools ensured that all changes were detected 
and presented to you for action.
Using Interference Checking in 3D Coordination
In addition to asset management, digital fabrication, and cost estimation, 3D coordination is  
one of the most important uses of building information modeling. It has enormous potential  
to reduce the costs of construction through the computerized resolution of clashing building 
elements as well as exposing opportunities for alternate trade scheduling or prefabrication.  
The key component to achieving 3D coordination is interference checking, also known as  
clash detection.
Indiana University Defines Clashes
As we mentioned previously in this chapter, not only are some building and facility owners requiring 
BIM processes and deliverables for new projects, but they are also deﬁning how these processes are 
to be used. When you focus on interference checking, myriad potential clashes can be distilled into 
a prioritized grouping of building elements. Borrowing from Indiana University’s BIM Standards & 
Guidelines for Architects, Engineers, & Contractors, the following is an intelligent approach to the 
organization of potential interferences. (Always remember that the priorities listed here are based 
on the requirements of one organization. Te needs of your ﬁrm and those of your clients may vary.)
Level One Clashes
Clashes in these categories are considered the most critical to the coordination process. Tey usually 
relate to systems or construction techniques that are more costly to delay or reschedule.
 
◆
Mechanical Ductwork and Piping vs. Ceilings
 
◆
Mechanical Ductwork and Piping vs. Rated Walls (for coordination of dampers and other 
mechanical equipment needs)
 
◆
Mechanical Ductwork and Piping vs. Structure (columns, beams, framing, etc.)

◆
All Equipment and Teir Applicable Clearances vs. Structure
 
◆
Mechanical Equipment and Fixtures vs. Electrical Equipment and Fixtures
 
◆

Level Two Clashes
Tese categories of clashes are considered important to the design and construction process but 
are less critical than those designated as Level One.
 
◆
Casework vs. Electrical Fixtures and Devices
 
◆
Furnishings vs. Electrical Fixtures and Devices
 
◆
Structure vs. Specialty Equipment
 
◆
Structure vs. Electrical Equipment, Fixtures, and Devices
 
◆
Ductwork and Piping vs. Electrical Equipment, Fixtures, and Devices
 
◆
Ductwork vs. Floors
Level Three Clashes
Tese clashes are considered important to the correctness of the model; however, they will usually 
change on a regular basis throughout the design and construction process.
 
◆
Casework vs. Walls
 
◆
Plumbing Piping vs. Electrical Equipment, Fixtures, and Devices
 
◆
Plumbing Piping vs. Mechanical Equipment, Fixtures, and Devices
 
◆
ADA Clear Space Requirements vs. Doors, Fixtures, Walls, Structure
Using the Interference Check Tool
The Interference Check tool is a basic tool supporting 3D coordination. You can use it within 
a single project model or between linked models. You can also select elements prior to run-
ning the tool in order to detect clashes within a limited set of geometry instead of the entire 
project.
For more powerful clash-detection capabilities, Autodesk offers Navisworks® Manage 
(www.autodesk.com/navisworks), which is a multiformat model-reviewing tool with vari-
ous modules supporting phasing simulation, visualization, and clash detection. Figure 6.19 
shows an example of a model in Navisworks Manage comprising Revit, Tekla Structures, 
and AutoCAD MEP components. Some of the beneﬁts of using Navisworks for interference-
checking over Revit include automated views of each clash, grouping of related clashes, 
enhanced reporting, clash-resolution tracking, and markup capabilities. Revit models can 
be opened directly in Navisworks or exported directly to the Navisworks format from the 
Application menu.
Revit now allows you to link in NavisWorks ﬁles (.nwc and .nwd). We will review those 
workﬂows in more detail in the next chapter.

Running an Interference Check—An Exercise
Let’s take a look at the Revit interference-checking process. For this exercise, you will need 
to download three sample ﬁles to your computer or network: c06-Interference-Arch.rvt, 
c06-Interference-Mech.rvt, and c06-Interference-Stru.rvt. You can download these 
ﬁles from this book’s web page. The sample ﬁles are already linked to each other using relative 
paths, so be sure to place all three ﬁles in the same folder. Then follow these steps:
1. Open the ﬁle c06-Interference-Mech.rvt and activate the default 3D view.
2. Switch to the Collaborate tab, ﬁnd the Coordinate panel, and choose Interference Check ➢ 
Run Interference Check.
3. When the Interference Check dialog box appears, choose c06-Interference-Stru.rvt 
from the Categories From drop-down list in the left column. Select Structural Framing in 
the left column and Ducts in the right column (Figure 6.20).
4. Click OK to close the dialog box.
5. The Interference Report window will appear, listing all clashes detected between the 
categories you selected. The list can be sorted by either Category 1 or Category 2, repre-
senting the left and right columns in the Interference Check dialog box, respectively. In 
Figure 6.21, one interference condition has been selected, and the corresponding element 
is highlighted in the 3D view.

246 | CHAPTER 6 WORKING WITH CONSULTANTS 
You can navigate in the 3D view using any method (mouse, ViewCube®, or SteeringWheels®) 
while keeping the interference report open. This facilitates resolution of the clashing items. 
The results of the interference check can also be exported to an HTML format report. Click the 
Export button and specify a location for the report. You can then share this report with other 
members of your design team for remedial actions on linked models.
Te Bottom Line
Prepare for interdisciplinary collaboration.  Proper planning and communication are the 
foundation of effective collaboration. Although only some client organizations may require a 
BIM planning document, it is a recommended strategy for all design teams.
Master It  What are the key elements of a BIM execution plan?
Collaborate using linked Revit models.  The most basic tool for collaboration is the ability 
to view consultants’ data directly within the context of your own model. Project ﬁles from 
other disciplines can be linked and displayed with predictable visual ﬁdelity without com-
plex conversion processes.
Master It  How can worksharing complement the use of linked Revit models?
Use Copy/Monitor between linked models.  The Coordination Monitor tools establish 
intelligent bonds between elements in a host ﬁle and correlating elements in a linked model. 
They also support a workﬂow that respects the needs of discrete teams developing their own 
data, perhaps on a different schedule than that of other team members.
Master It  How can grids in two different Revit projects be related?
Run interference checks.  Interference checking—also known as clash detection—is one of 
the most important components of building information modeling. It is the essence of virtual 
construction and has the greatest potential for cost savings during the physical construction 
process.

 Interoperability: Working 
Multiplatform   
 In the previous chapter, we discussed working with others in an environment in which all par-
ties use Autodesk ® Revit ® software; however, often you’ll need to work with data from other 
software platforms. For example, you may need to coordinate data from other disciplines, reuse 
legacy data, or integrate disparate design platforms. There are several ways to use external data 
within your Revit model in both 2D and 3D. We will discuss not only the methods of import-
ing and exporting data but also when to use each method and the reasons for using speciﬁ c 
settings. 
 In this chapter, you’ll learn to

 Examining Interoperability on a BIM Curve 
 On the basis of a 2007 study on interoperability in the design and construction industry, 
McGraw-Hill Construction reported annual losses of $9.1 billion in the building industry due 
to insufﬁ cient interoperability. You can ﬁ nd the full report online ( http://www.aia.org/
aiaucmp/groups/aia/documents/pdf/aias077485.pdf ). Although the study is now a bit 
dated, it underscores a problem that building information modeling (BIM) as a whole tries to 
address. Adequate interoperability will help rectify the problem illustrated in Figure  7.1 , some-
times known as the BIM curve. In Figure  7.1 , the downward spikes in the lower line at the end 
of each project phase represent a loss of knowledge and acquired data. This loss usually occurs 
when a project is exported from BIM to a 2D CAD format or is printed to paper. Project data is 
then gradually reconstructed in another software platform. The upper line represents a more 
ideal paradigm where data and knowledge are gradually increased throughout the life of the 
project—a paradigm supported by BIM and full interoperability. 
 Although full interoperability between BIM platforms is the ideal scenario, we realize that 
you are likely to be working with constituents who are using 2D CAD or non-BIM 3D software.

Inserting CAD Data
Although Revit software provides ample means to generate 2D documentation based on a rich 
multidimensional (3D, 4D, 5D, and so on) model, there are a few real-world scenarios in which 
CAD data must be integrated with the building information model. Such scenarios might 
include the following:
 
◆
Using CAD details developed within your ﬁrm
 
◆
Coordinating with other ﬁrms using CAD software
 
◆
Converting projects from CAD to a Revit model
 
◆
Using external modeling tools for conceptual massing
 
◆
Using complex component models from other software
Using Predeﬁned Settings for Inserted CAD Data
When you are inserting data from a DWG or DXF ﬁle, you can establish some predeﬁned set-
tings to control its appearance within the Revit environment. Some settings are controlled at 
the time you link or insert a CAD ﬁle, but other settings can be conﬁgured more deliberately in 
saved conﬁguration ﬁles. The two ways you can conﬁgure this data are by mapping layer colors 
to Revit line weights and by converting font types.
Mapping Layer Colors
For inserted CAD ﬁles, layers within the ﬁle are assigned a Revit line weight based on the 
weight assigned to each layer by the CAD software application that created the ﬁles. If the layer 
line weights are set to Default in the CAD ﬁle, they will follow a translation template you can 
Certiﬁcation
Objective

INSERTING CAD DATA | 249
conﬁgure that maps the layer colors to Revit line weights. To access these settings, select the 
Insert tab and click the dialog launcher at the bottom right of the Import panel. Doing so opens 
the Import Line Weights dialog box, shown in Figure 7.2.
Defining the Imported Line Weights Template in Revit.ini Files
You can deﬁne the default Import Line Weight template directly from the Revit.ini ﬁle. Te ﬁle 
location for the template is stored in the Revit.ini ﬁle in the following category:
[Directories]
ImportLineweightsNameDWG=< Full path to TXT file >
If you are using any kind of automation scripts to set up standards, your imported line weights 
template ﬁle location can be written into the Revit.ini ﬁle for all your users. Doing so ensures 
consistency for all team members inserting CAD data into your Revit project.
Figure 7.2 
Deﬁning settings for 
imported DWG/DXF 
line weights
As you can see in the title bar of this dialog box, these settings are stored in a text ﬁle (TXT) 
in the Data folder where Revit is installed. There are several predeﬁned text ﬁles based on inter-
national CAD standards for layer color.
 
◆
AIA (American Institute of Architects)
 
◆
BS1192 (British Standard)
 
◆
CP83 (Singapore Standard)
 
◆
ISO13567 (International Standards Organization)
Click the Load button to select one of these predeﬁned line weight templates or your own. 
On the basis of the unique needs of some projects, you might also consider creating customized 
import setting ﬁles and storing them along with the rest of your project data.

250 | CHAPTER 7 INTEROPERABILITY: WORKING MULTIPLATFORM 
Mapping Font Types
Another important aspect for inserted CAD data is the ability to map shape-based fonts  
to TrueType fonts. Usually a remnant of older CAD standards based on graphic performance, 
CAD ﬁles may contain fonts such as Simplex, RomanS, or Monotxt that do not have  
matches in standard Windows fonts. The shxfontmap.txt ﬁle deﬁnes the mapping of 
TrueType fonts as substitutes for each speciﬁed SHX font. You can ﬁnd this text ﬁle at  
C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\RVT 2018\UserDataCache.
If your ﬁrm frequently uses CAD data as an integrated part of your ﬁnal documentation, the 
shxfontmap.txt ﬁle should be conﬁgured to map your standard CAD fonts to your standard 
fonts used in a Revit project. This ﬁle should then be copied to the workstations of all team 
members using Revit software. Failure to do so may result in undesirable results when using 
CAD ﬁles in a worksharing environment.
Importing vs. Linking
You can insert CAD data into the Revit environment in two ways: importing and linking. Each 
method has advantages and disadvantages.
Linking  A linked CAD ﬁle in a Revit project is analogous to an external reference (XREF) 
in an AutoCAD project. When the original CAD ﬁle is modiﬁed, its reference is automatically 
updated in the Revit environment. Linking also allows you to easily unload or remove a ﬁle 
when it is no longer needed, which will leave no trace of the ﬁle’s contents after removal.
Linked data cannot be modiﬁed directly in a Revit project unless it is converted to an import 
in the Manage Links dialog box (Insert ➢ Manage Links) and then exploded. We discuss this 
process in the “Manipulating Inserted CAD Data” section later in this chapter. As an alterna-
tive, it can be modiﬁed in its original authoring application and then updated within Revit.
Importing  Similar to the using the Insert command in Autodesk® AutoCAD® software, 
importing data integrates the CAD data into the Revit project but does not allow the imported 
data to be updated if the original CAD ﬁle is modiﬁed. In such a case, the imported data would 
have to be deleted and reimported. It also does not give you an easy way to purge the layers, 
linetypes, and hatch patterns of an imported ﬁle if the data has been exploded and then deleted.
Linking is the preferred method for external data integration. This is primarily because 
linked CAD ﬁles, like linked Revit ﬁles, can be temporarily unlinked and cleared out of active 
memory. This gives you more ﬂexibility with the ﬁle. However, too many linked ﬁles will make 
it slower to open a Revit project. For example, ceiling plan ﬁxture layouts may change with 
every design iteration (where linking is preferred); however, standard details that all share a 
minimal amount of standardized layers, linetypes, hatch patterns, text, and dimension styles 
might be better suited as imports.
Certiﬁcation
Objective
Collect CAD Links in a Linked Revit File
Another option to manage many CAD references in larger projects is to create a separate Revit 
project that contains only the inserted CAD data. If the CAD data is placed with the Current View 
Only option, you must use linked views between Revit models. If the linked data does not use this 
option, it will be visible like any other modeled element in a linked Revit model. Refer to Chapter 6, 
“Working with Consultants,” for more information about linked Revit models.

INSERTING CAD DATA | 251
Using Options During Importing/Linking
After you have conﬁgured the necessary settings for inserted CAD data and decided whether 
to import or link, you need to understand certain options during the import/link process. We’ll 
discuss the preferred settings for each of the options based on real-world situations in the sec-
tions “Using Inserted 2D Data” and “Using Inserted 3D Data.”
To place your ﬁrst CAD ﬁle into a Revit project, switch to the Insert tab and select either 
the Link CAD or the Import CAD button. No matter which tool you use, there will be several 
important options at the bottom of the respective dialog box, as shown in Figure 7.3.
Figure 7.3 
Options available for 
import/link
Let’s examine the meaning of the settings in this situation.
Current View Only  When this option is selected, the linked or imported ﬁle can be seen 
only in the view in which it was inserted and is thus considered a view-speciﬁc element. In 
a worksharing-enabled project, this data will be assigned to the view’s workset. More often 
than not, you will want to choose this option to limit the number of views in which the refer-
enced data will appear. If you need this data in other views, you can copy and paste it from 
one view to another.
If the option is not selected, the linked ﬁle can be seen in all views, including 3D, elevations, 
and sections. In a worksharing-enabled project, this data will be assigned to the active work-
set. A beneﬁt to using links in a worksharing environment is the ability to create a workset 
speciﬁcally for linked data and uncheck its Visible In All Views option. The CAD ﬁles placed 
in this manner will not appear in every view but are available when you need them by 
adjusting the workset visibility in the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box.
Colors  Colors don’t matter for CAD ﬁles being used as a basis to create a Revit model; how-
ever, using Invert or Preserve may help distinguish the CAD data from the modeled elements 
during the conversion process. If you are going to integrate the inserted data with other ele-
ments in your project for ﬁnal design or construction documentation, you’ll want to select the 
Black And White option, because printing from Revit is mostly WYSIWYG (what you see is 
what you get). Read the section “Using CAD Data for Coordination” for more detailed recom-
mendations on this process.
Layers/Levels  These options allow you to import or link all the layers, only the layers vis-
ible when the CAD ﬁle was last saved, or a selected group of layers you choose from the 
linked ﬁle in a separate dialog box. (Layers is a DWG-based term. Revit software supports the 
same functionality with levels from DGN ﬁles.)
Import Units  For CAD ﬁles generated in an original program (that is, DWG from AutoCAD 
or DGN from MicroStation), the Auto-Detect option works well. If you are linking CAD data 
that has been exported from a different program, such as a DWG ﬁle exported from Rhino, 
you should specify the units relative to the respective CAD ﬁle.

252 | CHAPTER 7 INTEROPERABILITY: WORKING MULTIPLATFORM 
Positioning  To maintain consistency in a multilevel project during a CAD-to-Revit coordi-
nation or conversion process, you should use Auto – Origin To Origin or Auto – By Shared 
Coordinates. Origin To Origin will align the world coordinates origin of the CAD ﬁle with 
the project internal origin. Although Autodesk claims Auto – By Shared Coordinates is only 
for use with linked Revit ﬁles, it can be used with CAD ﬁles if the rotation of true north 
becomes inconsistent using the Origin To Origin option.
Place At  This option is available only if Current View Only is not selected; it speciﬁes the 
level at which the inserted data will be placed.
Correct Lines That Are Slightly Off Axis  Selecting this option automatically corrects 
lines that are slightly off axis when you import or link CAD geometry. This option is 
selected by default and will help keep your Revit elements (such as walls or linework) that 
tie to CAD lines from being askew; however, you may need to consider this option care-
fully. If the CAD data you are inserting is intentionally off-axis, the corrections may lead to 
inaccurate results. For example, a site plan may have property lines that are a fraction of a 
degree from being orthogonal, but they must be maintained for accurate building placement 
in your Revit project.
Orient To View  This option may be used if True North has been rotated away from Project 
North. If that is the case and you are linking a CAD ﬁle into a view that is set to True North, 
deselect this option to align the CAD ﬁle’s World Coordinate System with True North as 
deﬁned in your Revit project.
If you do check the Orient To View option, the CAD ﬁle will align with Project North regard-
less of the view orientation.
Manipulating Inserted CAD Data
Once you have CAD data imported or linked into a Revit project, you have several ways of 
manipulating the data to suit your needs.
Foreground/Background  This setting applies only to linked or imported CAD ﬁles placed 
with the Current View Only option. With the inserted ﬁle selected, a drop-down menu will 
appear in the Options bar so you can adjust whether the data appears above or below your 
modeled Revit content. You can also access this setting in the Properties palette when the 
inserted ﬁle is selected.

INSERTING CAD DATA | 253
Pay close attention to this option when integrating 2D CAD data with an existing Revit 
model—sometimes linked or imported CAD data may not appear at all until you set the 
option to Foreground because of ﬂoors or ceilings obscuring the 2D data.
Visibility of Layers/Levels  The layers or levels within a linked or imported CAD ﬁle 
can be accessed in two ways, the easiest of which is the Query tool. First, select a linked or 
imported CAD ﬁle; then, from the contextual tab in the ribbon, select the Query tool and pick 
an object in the CAD ﬁle.
You will see the Import Instance Query dialog box (Figure 7.4). Using this tool, you can hide 
the layer or level by clicking the Hide In View button. The Query tool will remain active even 
after you click any of the command buttons in the Import Instance Query dialog box, and 
you must press the Esc key or click the Modify button to end the command.
Figure 7.4 
Querying objects 
within a linked  
CAD ﬁle
The second way to make layers or levels in imported or linked CAD ﬁles invisible is to use 
the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box by switching to the View tab and selecting 
Visibility/Graphics from the Graphics panel. Once the dialog box opens, select the Imported 
Categories tab, as shown in Figure 7.5. Only the inserted CAD ﬁles that are visible in the 
active view will be listed in this tab. Expand any listed ﬁle to expose the layers/levels within 
that ﬁle, and use the check boxes to customize visibility of the link within the current view. 
This method is the only way to restore visibility of layers/levels that were hidden with the 
Query tool.
CAD Data in Families
Remember that 2D and 3D data imported into Revit families will be listed under the Imports In 
Families category in both the Visibility/Graphic Overrides and Object Styles dialog boxes. Tey 
will not appear as separately listed ﬁles.

254 | CHAPTER 7 INTEROPERABILITY: WORKING MULTIPLATFORM 
Figure 7.5 
Controlling visibil-
ity of layers within 
imported objects
Graphic Overrides  If you need to change the appearance of the content within a linked 
or imported CAD ﬁle, you can accomplish that at the project level or within an individual 
view. To change a CAD ﬁle’s appearance throughout the project, select the Manage tab on 
the ribbon, and click Object Styles in the Settings panel. Select the Imported Objects tab 
(Figure 7.6), and expand any of the imported or linked CAD ﬁles to change the color, line 
weight, line pattern, or material of the layers/levels within the referenced ﬁle. Changing 
these properties in the row of the ﬁlename does not affect the contents of that ﬁle. You 
can also apply these settings in a speciﬁc view using the Visibility/Graphic Overrides 
dialog box.
Exploding  Although we do not recommend exploding CAD data within a Revit project, 
you can do it to facilitate the modiﬁcation of such data. Linked content must ﬁrst be con-
verted to an import in order to be exploded. You do this by selecting the Insert tab on the 
ribbon, choosing Manage Links from the Link panel, choosing a listed link, and clicking the 
Import button. To explode the imported ﬁle, select it, and choose Explode ➢ Full Explode 
or Partial Explode from the contextual tab in the ribbon. The lines, text, and hatch patterns 
will become new line styles, text types, and ﬁll regions in your project. Remember that these 
types of objects cannot be removed from your project via the Purge Unused command; you 
must remove them manually.

Tips on Importing CAD Files
To minimize the adverse impact of unnecessary styles and types carried into the Revit environ-
ment with exploding imported CAD data, we recommend removing extraneous data in the CAD 
ﬁle before linking it. We suggest purging the ﬁle as well prior to linking. Here are some general 
tips for this workﬂow:
 
◆
If your import contains elements such as hatches or annotations not intended for use in the 
Revit project, delete them before importing.
 
◆
Consider consolidating data within the CAD ﬁle to a minimum number of layers or levels. Doing 
so will ease the process of converting to Revit line styles if the ﬁle is exploded. Tis process 
will also facilitate graphic overrides.
 
◆
If it is allowable within your workﬂow for the imported CAD ﬁle, import it into a family, and 
then insert that family into your project. Tis will not reduce the overall ﬁle size, but it will 
make it a lot easier to ﬁnd and manipulate should your imported CAD ﬁle need additional 
changes. It will also give you some extra control over the graphic display of the imported ﬁle.
Revit software doesn’t allow line segments shorter than 1/32″ (0.8 mm). Although it might 
seem like you wouldn’t have a lot of lines that length, many manufacturers’ details contain 
small ﬁllets in sections and plans and will fall into this range. Take care when exploding CAD 
details with very small line segments because they will be removed upon exploding. A good 

256 | CHAPTER 7 INTEROPERABILITY: WORKING MULTIPLATFORM 
example of this is the manufacturers’ details. Many of those CAD ﬁles have the level of detail 
needed to create the part (for example, a window mullion) but are not necessary for architec-
tural detailing. Revit will automatically remove those shorter segments, and in some cases it 
might be quicker to simply trace over the detail rather than insert and explode it.
Using Inserted 2D Data
In the following sections, we will discuss how to import 2D CAD data from platforms such 
as AutoCAD (DWG) and MicroStation (DGN) or in the generic Drawing Exchange Format (DXF). 
You can also use ﬁles from other software platforms, but only if they are DWG, DGN, or 
DXF format. Most commercially available CAD programs are able to export in DWG or DXF 
format.
2D CAD data can be used in three fundamental ways with respect to a building project’s 
ﬂoor plans, ceiling plans, or site plans:
 
◆
Using 2D data as backgrounds for BIM conversion
 
◆
Integrating 2D data with the model
 
◆
Importing CAD details
Setting Options for BIM Conversion
On the basis of a common situation, we will assume that 2D CAD data will be linked into the 
Revit model to be converted into building elements. Although the positioning of the ﬁles is 
important, the color and line weights of the imported data are not.
To begin the next exercise, you will need the ﬁles c07-Plan01.dwg and  
c07-Conversion-Start.rvt. You can download these ﬁles from this book’s  
web page, www.sybex.com/go/masteringrevit2018. After downloading, open the  
c07-Conversion-Start.rvt ﬁle, and activate the Level 1 ﬂoor plan. Then follow  
these steps:
1. Switch to the Insert tab and select Link CAD from the Link panel. Browse to the ﬁle  
c07-Plan01.dwg.
2. In the Link CAD Formats dialog box, set the following options:
 
◆
Current View Only: Selected
 
◆
Colors: Invert
 
◆
Layers/Levels: All
 
◆
Import Units: Auto-Detect
 
◆
Positioning: Auto – Origin To Origin
 
◆
Correct Lines That Are Slightly Off Axis: Selected
3. With those settings in place, choose Open to link in the CAD ﬁle.

USING INSERTED 2D DATA | 257
Linking Large CAD Data
Use caution when attempting to link or import CAD ﬁles with vector data very far from the origin. 
Revit software has distance limitations on imported vector data that—if exceeded—may result 
in a warning, as shown here:
Te warning message indicates that the software will automatically use Center To Center positioning 
if the distance limitations are exceeded. Tis will preclude you from using the origin of the linked 
ﬁle for Origin To Origin placement. If you must link data that is a physically large cube such as 
many miles in diameter—which may occur in projects such as airports or master plans—you should 
separate the data into smaller portions before linking. If the data is smaller than the 20-mile cube 
but is located farther than 20 miles from its origin, an alternate origin should be coordinated with 
your project team, and the data should be moved closer to the origin.
Using CAD Data for Coordination
If you need to use 2D CAD data as an integrated component of your team coordination, differ-
ent settings become important. Here are a few examples of these types of scenarios:
 
◆
Showing light ﬁxture layouts from a lighting designer
 
◆
Integrating landscape design into a site plan
 
◆
Reusing existing CAD data for a renovation project
Most of the settings and procedures for conversion apply to the coordination process; how-
ever, the color and the placement visibility will be different. Because this data will be included 
in the Revit output, you will usually want the color option to be set to Black And White in the 
options during linking. It is also likely that some sort of background plans will be exported 
from the Revit model for use in coordination by one or more consultants using a CAD-based 
program. The data returned in this process may still contain the background information 
originally exported from Revit; thus, we recommend agreement on a standard that establishes 
unique layers for the consultants’ content. This will help you select layers to be loaded when 
linking your consultants’ ﬁles into the Revit project.
Use these options when linking CAD ﬁles into a Revit project for plan-based coordination:

Current View Only: Selected if data is needed in one view; unselected if data is needed in 
many views
 
◆
Colors: Black And White
 
◆
Layers: Specify (choose only designated layers to isolate consultants’ content)
 
◆
Positioning: Auto – By Shared Coordinates

258 | CHAPTER 7 INTEROPERABILITY: WORKING MULTIPLATFORM 
If Current View Only is not selected, the 2D CAD data will be visible in all other views. This 
could be a nuisance in views such as sections and elevations; however, you might ﬁnd it useful 
to visualize the data alongside the Revit model, as shown in Figure 7.7.

Linking Details
Your company’s CAD detail library does not need to go to waste when you start working in a 
Revit environment. CAD data can be linked or imported into drafting views, allowing you to 
leverage the powerful view coordination tools within Revit. Entire sheets of CAD details can 
be inserted to reduce the number of linked ﬁles you have to reconcile; however, we recommend 
linking one detail into each drafting view and using the software’s ability to automatically 
manage the view references with callouts, sections, and detail views. You may also want to 
name these drafting views with a unique preﬁx to help keep track of where any linked CAD 
data might reside. For example, a drafting view might be named CAD-Roof Detail 04. Also 
refer to Chapter 4, “Conﬁguring Templates and Standards,” for additional information on view 
organization.
In this exercise, you will create a drafting view into which a single CAD detail will be linked. 
This view can be referenced throughout your Revit model using a section, callout, or eleva-
tion view with the Reference Other View option selected in the contextual tab of the ribbon, as 
shown in Figure 7.8.
Figure 7.8 
Creating a view as a 
reference to a  
drafting view

USING INSERTED 2D DATA | 259
To begin this exercise, open the c07-Sample-Building-Start.rvt ﬁle. You can download 
this ﬁle and the associated CAD ﬁle (c07-Detail.dwg) from the book’s web page.
1. Switch to the View tab and select Drafting View from the Create panel.
2. Name the new drafting view CAD Wall Detail 1, and set the scale to 1 1/2″ = 1′-0″. Click 
OK to close the dialog box.
3. Switch to the Insert tab and select Link CAD.
4. In the Link CAD Formats dialog box, navigate to the c07-Detail.dwg ﬁle and set the fol-
lowing options:
 
◆
Colors: Black And White
 
◆
Layers/Levels: All
 
◆
Units: Auto-Detect
 
◆
Positioning: Auto – Center To Center
 
◆
Correct Lines That Are Slightly Off Axis: Unchecked
5. Click Open to complete the command. If you don’t see the linked detail in the drafting 
view, use Zoom To Fit (or type ZF on the keyboard) to reset the extents of the view.
6. Open the Wall Section, Typ view from the Project Browser located under the Sections (Wall 
Section) node, and zoom to a portion of the view where a ﬂoor meets an exterior wall.
7. On the View tab, select Callout from the Create panel, and select Reference Other View 
in the contextual tab of the ribbon (similar to Figure 7.8). Choose Drafting View: CAD 
Wall Detail 1 from the drop-down list. In the drawing window, drag the callout rectangle 
around the area where the ﬂoor at Level 2 intersects the exterior wall.
8. After the callout is placed, select the callout you just created and use the grip where the 
leader line meets the callout head to drag the callout head to the left. The result should 
look like the image shown in Figure 7.9.
Figure 7.9 
Callout created to ref-
erence a drafting view 
containing a linked 
CAD detail
9. Double-click the callout head, and you will be taken to the drafting view with the CAD 
detail linked in the previous steps.

260 | CHAPTER 7 INTEROPERABILITY: WORKING MULTIPLATFORM 
Customizing Callouts
You also have the option to create your callouts with nonrectangular shapes. Additionally, for any 
view you reference using the previous steps, you can change the target view after you’ve created 
the callout or sectional reference. Simply highlight it and choose a new detail to reference from 
the Options bar.
Using Inserted 3D Data
Now that we have discussed using 2D reference data, we will show you how to use 3D model 
data from other design software within your Revit project. There are many valid reasons for 
modeling outside of the Revit environment, including software expertise, the availability of con-
tent, and optimization of complex geometry. The following sections will explore some situations 
in which model data can be shared between programs:
 
◆
Inserted data as a mass
 
◆
Inserted data as a face
 
◆
Inserted data as an object
Using CAD Data as a Mass
In Chapter 10, “Conceptual Design,” you will learn more about harnessing the impressive mod-
eling toolset in Revit and FormIt for conceptual design; however, the fast and ﬂexible process of 
design may lead architects to a tool in which they have more expertise or comfort. This type of 
massing design workﬂow is supported in the Revit environment under the following conditions:
 
◆
Inserted model data requires solid geometry to calculate volume, surface area, and ﬂoor 
area faces.
 
◆
Finely detailed complex geometry should be avoided because the Host By Face tools may 
not be able to generate meaningful objects.
The following exercise creates an in-place mass by linking an external model—in this case, a 
SketchUp model. Download the ﬁles c07-SKP-Mass.rvt, c07-Mass.skp, and c07-Mass-2.skp 
from the book’s web page and follow these steps:
1. Open the project ﬁle c07-SKP-Mass.rvt. Activate the Level 1 ﬂoor plan, and from the 
Massing & Site tab (if that tab isn’t available, you can turn it on under the Application 
menu ➢ Options ➢ User Interface), select In-Place Mass from the Conceptual Mass panel.
2. Name the new mass family SKP Mass and click OK.
3. Switch to the Insert tab and select Link CAD from the Link panel; be sure to switch your 
Files Of Type ﬁlter to *.skp ﬁles.

USING INSERTED 3D DATA | 261
4. Navigate to the c07-Mass.skp ﬁle downloaded from the book’s web page and set the fol-
lowing options:
 
◆
Current View Only: Unchecked
 
◆
Colors: Invert
 
◆
Layers/Levels: All
 
◆
Import Units: Auto-Detect
 
◆
Positioning: Auto – Center To Center
 
◆
Place At: Level 1
5. Click Open to complete the link process.
6. Click Finish Mass in the In-Place Editor panel of the ribbon.
7. Activate the Mass Schedule view from the Project Browser and observe the values for 
Gross Surface Area and Gross Volume.
Now that a new mass has been created, you can assign mass ﬂoors and begin to see calcu-
lated results in schedules of masses and mass ﬂoors. Calculation of volumes, perimeters, and 
mass ﬂoor areas will work well in this workﬂow, but be careful when using imported model 
geometry with the By Face tools because face updates will likely be more difﬁcult for the soft-
ware to maintain than native Revit massing.
Using linking instead of importing enables continued iteration of the form in the original 
software. In the case of this example, you may edit the original ﬁle in SketchUp, which is avail-
able as a free download from www.sketchup.com, or you can download the ﬁle c07-Mass-2.skp 
from this book’s web page.
If you modify and save the original SKP ﬁle yourself, save, close, and reopen the Revit project. 
As an alternative, open the Manage Links dialog box, select the SKP ﬁle, and click Reload. If you 
want to use the alternative ﬁle downloaded from the book’s web page, use the following steps:
1. From the Insert tab of the ribbon, click Manage Links.
2. In the Manage Links dialog box, switch to the CAD Formats tab, select the SKP ﬁle, and 
click the Reload From button.
3. Navigate to the ﬁle c07-Mass-2.skp and click Open.
4. Click OK to close the Manage Links dialog box.
With the modiﬁed mass loaded, activate the Mass Schedule view and notice the changes of 
Gross Volume and Gross Surface Area.
Using CAD Data as a Face
Similar to the data as mass workﬂow, externally modeled data can be used as a planar host for 
more complex forms. An example might be the need to generate a complex curved roof sur-
face. We will demonstrate this workﬂow using Rhinoceros (commonly referred to as Rhino) by 
McNeel (www.rhino3d.com) to generate a shape, link the shape into the project, and create a roof 
by face on the shape.

262 | CHAPTER 7 INTEROPERABILITY: WORKING MULTIPLATFORM 
As shown in Figure 7.10, a complex surface is generated in Rhino by drawing two curves and 
using the Extrude Curve Along Curve tool. Note that some reference geometry was exported 
from a Revit model to DWG and linked into this study in Rhino.
Figure 7.10 
Curves for a complex 
surface in Rhino
A ﬂat surface model is enough to generate a roof by face; however, it may be difﬁcult to see 
the imported surface, so use the Extrude Surface tool to give it a thickness. Once the surface is 
complete (Figure 7.11), select only the double-curved geometry, choose File ➢ Export Selected 
Objects, and choose the .sat ﬁlename extension. SAT will generate the cleanest geometry for 
curved solids and surfaces. However, new to Revit is the ability to directly import Rhino forms 
without ﬁrst having to perform an export. To keep this exercise more generic and accessible to 
other design platforms besides Rhino, we are going to use the SAT ﬁle, but as an alternative, you 
can use the native Rhino .3dm ﬁle as well.
Figure 7.11 
Completed complex 
surface in Rhino

USING INSERTED 3D DATA | 263
You can download the Rhino ﬁle (c07-Roof-Face.3dm) and SAT export (c07-Roof-Face.sat) 
from this book’s web page. You can also download the sample Revit project and continue the 
process as follows:
1. Open the ﬁle c07-Roof-by-Face.rvt and open the 3D view named 00-Start.
2. On the Massing & Site tab, choose In-Place Mass and name it Rhino Roof. You will see an 
alert that the Show Mass mode has been enabled. You may choose to not show this mes-
sage again, but you can always use the Show Mass combination button in the Massing & 
Site tab of the ribbon to toggle between different visibility modes.
3. Switch to the Insert tab and select Link CAD. In the Files Of Type drop-down, select 
*.sat and navigate to the c07-Roof-Face.sat (or c07-Roof-Face.3dm) ﬁle downloaded 
from the book’s web page.
4. Set the placement options as follows:
 
◆
Positioning: Auto – Origin To Origin
 
◆
Place At: Level 1
 
◆
Import Units: Inch
5. Click Open to complete the link and close the dialog box; then click the Finish Mass but-
ton in the ribbon.
You should be able to see the mass above the tops of the walls in the Revit model, as 
shown in Figure 7.12.

place mass
6. Return to the Massing & Site tab and select the Roof tool from the Model By Face panel. 
Choose Basic Roof: Generic - 12″ from the Type Selector, and click the top face of the mass 
created in the previous steps. Click the Create Roof button in the ribbon to complete the 
command, and the roof will be generated along the mass surface, as shown in Figure 7.13.

7. Select all the perimeter walls, using the Tab key or Ctrl to add them individually to the 
selection.
8. Select the Attach Top/Base tool from the Modify | Walls tab, set the Top option in the 
Options bar, and pick the roof by face created in step 6.
The walls will connect to the underside of the complex roof shape. Activate the 3D view 
named Camera-Front and you will see the result of the exercise, as shown in Figure 7.14.

USING INSERTED 3D DATA | 265
The imported shape can be edited in the original modeling software and will update via the 
link if the original exported SAT ﬁle is overwritten. To update the roof based on the newly mod-
iﬁed massing geometry, select the roof and click the Update To Face button in the contextual tab 
of the ribbon.
Using CAD Data as an Object
Yet another derivation of the reference data workﬂow supports the use of CAD model geometry 
for speciﬁc instances of building components. Examples of this scenario might include a com-
plex canopy structure being designed in SolidWorks or a building’s structural framing being 
modeled in Tekla Structures. The workﬂow is again similar to that of using CAD data as a mass 
or face; however, the ﬁle format will help you control the component’s visualization. In the 
previous exercise, we used an SAT format to transfer complex curved geometry from Rhino to 
Revit; however, a limitation of an SAT ﬁle is that the geometry contains only one layer, making it 
impossible to vary material assignments for different components of the design. We recommend 
using a solids-based DWG, DGN, or DXF ﬁle format, which will maintain a layer structure in 
most cases.
In the following exercise, you will create an in-place structural framing component that will 
act as a placeholder for a consultant’s structural model, which is in DWG format. You will be 
using the ﬁle c07-3D-Structure.dwg, which you can download from this book’s web page.
1. Download and open the ﬁle c07-Framing-Start.rvt from the book’s web page. Activate 
the Level 1 ﬂoor plan.
2. Switch to the Architecture tab and choose Component ➢ Model In-Place. Set Family 
Category to Structural Framing and click OK.
3. Name the new in-place model DWG Structure.
4. From the Insert tab, select Link CAD.
5. Change the Files Of Type option to DWG Files (*.dwg) and navigate to the ﬁle  
c07-3D-Structure.dwg.
6. Set the following options and then click Open:
 
◆
Current View Only: Unselected
 
◆

◆

◆
Import Units: Auto-Detect
 
◆

The DWG ﬁle provided is actually a sample Revit ﬁle that was exported to DWG 
format (Figure 7.15). Models may be provided in this format from any number of 
other design applications such as Autodesk® AutoCAD® MEP software or Tekla 
Structures.
7. Click Finish Model in the In-Place Editor panel to complete the process.

Activate the default 3D view, and you should see the entire contents of the linked CAD model 
(Figure 7.16). Because the linked content was created as a structural framing model, the linked 
data will be displayed similarly to any other structural framing element. Examine the linked 
model in different plans and sections to observe this behavior.

WORKING WITH OTHER DATA TYPES | 267
If you’re not seeing the model as part of your 3D view, you forgot to uncheck the box for 
Current View Only in step 6. If that is the case, you’ll need to either undo your way back or 
unlink and relink the CAD ﬁle.
Using linked models in DWG, DGN, or DXF format also allows you to modify the graphic 
representation of the elements within the Revit environment. To adjust these settings, follow 
these steps:
1. Select the Manage tab, click Object Styles, and switch to the Imported Objects tab.
2. Find your linked ﬁle, expand it to expose the layers or levels included in it, and modify 
the graphic settings as desired.
When you are using linked model data for custom components, the consistency of the data 
you bring into Revit software from other programs depends on the ability of that software to 
generate organized information. Some programs use layers, and some don’t. Recognizing this 
difference will give you the best opportunity for success in coordination through interoperability.
Working with Other Data Types
Revit now has the ability to utilize two new ﬁle types, Autodesk® Navisworks®  ﬁles (.nwc and 
.nwd) and FormIt ﬁle types. Navisworks ﬁles are key for model coordination for disciplines that 
are not native Revit content. While Navisworks focuses on the resolved building design (it is 
typically incorporated near the end of the construction document phase), FormIt can integrate at 
the beginning of the project process. FormIt (formit360.autodesk.com) is an early design tool, 
similar to SketchUp. We will review workﬂows with both tools.
Working with Navisworks Files
You can now bring Navisworks ﬁles directly into Revit for coordination and visualization. 
Navisworks is typically a tool employed by contractors and used to combine a variety of model 
types for construction coordination. You can ﬁnd out more about more about Navisworks from 
Autodesk’s website: www.autodesk.com/products/navisworks/overview.
In the following exercise, you will insert a Navisworks model into your Revit ﬁle. For 
the sake of this exercise, we have converted the c07-3D-Structure.dwg ﬁle to an NWD ﬁle. 
We will insert this ﬁle into the c07-Framing-Start.rvt ﬁle for structural and architectural 
coordination.
1. Open the c07-Framing-Start.rvt ﬁle you downloaded earlier and open the 
Coordination view from the Project Browser. You will also need to download the  
c07-3D-Structure.nwd ﬁle.
2. On the Link panel of the Insert tab you’ll see a new tool, Coordination Model (Figure 7.17). 
Choose this tool to insert a Navisworks model.
Figure 7.17 
Te Coordination 
Model tool on the 
Insert tab

268 | CHAPTER 7 INTEROPERABILITY: WORKING MULTIPLATFORM 
3. Selecting the Coordination Model tool will show you the Coordination Models 
Management dialog box (Figure 7.18). This dialog box operates similarly to the  
Linked Files dialog box. Choose the Add button at the bottom left and navigate to the  
c07-3D-Structure.nwd ﬁle you downloaded. Select the ﬁle and choose Open. With  
the ﬁle inserted, it should look like Figure 7.18.
Figure 7.18

Once the model is inserted, you can interact with it in many of the same ways you can with 
a Revit model. You are able to view different ﬂoor plans, cut sections, use crop regions, assign 
a phase, and so on, in order to use the Navisworks model for coordination or documentation. 
Once the model is imported into Revit, it will maintain any of the element colors you assigned it 
in Navisworks. Figure 7.19 shows the model inserted into Revit.

WORKING WITH OTHER DATA TYPES | 269
Working with FormIt Files
Autodesk FormIt is a conceptual design tool similar to SketchUp with the difference being that 
SketchUp is plane-based and FormIt is a solid-based modeler. This means you can also take 
FormIt models directly to a 3D printer.
FormIt was designed as a web-based tool and saves your content by default to an A360 site 
(autodesk360.com). While FormIt has many tools available to it, including energy analysis, 
rendering, and ﬂy-throughs, we are going to simply focus on FormIt’s interoperability with 
Revit.
Figure 7.20 shows the typical FormIt interface. For this example, we have re-created the  
c07-Roof-Face ﬁle in FormIt and assigned a material to it. Via FormIt’s export command, we 
have exported the ﬁle as c07-Roof-Face.axm, which is FormIt’s native ﬁle format. You can 
download this ﬁle from the book’s website.
Figure 7.20 
Te FormIt interface
FormIt has the unique ability to interact with Revit as a family ﬁle. Essentially, an AXM ﬁle 
is converted to an RFA ﬁle when it is imported into Revit. Alternately, you can export content 
from Revit to an AXM format to continue working directly with it in FormIt. While there is no 
“live linking” available right now between the two tools, it is easy to use the import/export 
mechanism.
You can import FormIt models to Revit or export to FormIt from the same menu in Revit. On 
the Add In tab from the FormIt 360 panel, choose the Import FormIt 360 To RVT drop-down 
(Figure 7.21). From here, you can browse to a local or A360 FormIt ﬁle to import into your Revit 
model or export to the same locations from Revit.

Exporting CAD Data
Just as signiﬁcant as importing data is the ability to export Revit data for use by others. We will 
now examine various processes for exporting data from your Revit project to other formats. To 
achieve your desired results when exporting, remember that exporting from Revit is essentially 
a WYSIWYG process. For example, exporting a 3D view will result in a 3D model, exporting a 
ﬂoor plan will result in a 2D CAD ﬁle, and exporting a schedule will result in a delimited ﬁle 
that can be used in a program such as Microsoft Excel.
We will ﬁrst review the settings to be conﬁgured for the exporting process. These methods 
are similar for almost all exports and will be referred to in subsequent sections. The process for 
exporting CAD ﬁles from Revit includes two basic steps: create a list of views to be exported 
and deﬁne the settings in an export conﬁguration.
Preparing a List of Views for Exporting
The ﬁrst step to any CAD export is to establish the set of views to be exported. You can use the 
ﬁle c07-Sample-Building-Start.rvt for this section’s exercises. The following steps will walk 
you through the process of creating a saved list of views for export:
1. You can ﬁnd all exporting commands in the Application menu when you click the Export 
ﬂyout. You may need to scroll down this ﬂyout menu to access all the export commands 
available for use. From the Export menu, select CAD Formats ➢ DWG.
2. You will ﬁrst see the DWG Export dialog box, as shown in Figure 7.22. The Export drop-
down list is set to <Current View/Sheet Only> by default. This is where you would select 
predeﬁned lists of views to be exported from your project.
3. Begin to create your own list of views and/or sheets to export by choosing <In-Session 
View/Sheet Set> from the Export drop-down list, shown in Figure 7.23.
4. From this point, you can either use a temporary in-session set or create your own named 
set. We will continue these steps by creating a new named set so you can export the same 
sheets later without the additional setup. Click the New Set icon above the view list, 
shown in Figure 7.24, and name the set PLANS. Click OK to close the dialog box.
Using In-Session Lists with Worksharing
Be careful when using an in-session list for printing or exporting on a worksharing-enabled project. 
If two or more team members working on the same Revit project attempt to use the in-session set, 
you may receive errors about the workset not being editable. Instead, always try to use predeﬁned 
lists for exporting and printing on worksharing projects.

272 | CHAPTER 7 INTEROPERABILITY: WORKING MULTIPLATFORM 
5. To begin adding views and/or sheets to your new export set, from the Show In List drop-
down menu, choose Views In The Model.
6. Click the Check None button to clear any extraneously selected views and then ﬁnd the 
ﬂoor plans with the A- preﬁx. Select these views by checking the boxes next to the views 
in the Include column.
Remember, you can sort the list by clicking any of the list headers (Figure 7.25).
Figure 7.25 
Adding views/sheets to 
the export list
7. For now, we will simply end this exercise by saving the list of views for later. Click the 
Save Set & Close button and the DWG Export dialog box will close.
8. Save the project ﬁle to continue the next exercise.
Now that you have created a saved list of views for export, they will be available for any CAD 
export processes. You can create as many lists as you need as well as duplicate, delete, or rename 
them in the DWG Export dialog box. In the next section, we will show you how to adjust the set-
tings for exported DWG ﬁles.
Settings for DWG Exports
In addition to saving lists of views for exporting, you have the ability to save predeﬁned export-
ing conﬁgurations. To complete an export, you will select a list of ﬁles and an export setup 
before deﬁning an export location and launching the process. Let’s examine the various settings 
that can be customized for DWG export.
Continuing with the c07-Sample-Building.rvt ﬁle, go to the Application menu, and then 
choose Export ➢ CAD Formats ➢ DWG. You will return to the DWG Export dialog box. In the 
previous exercise, you created a named list of views to export. Before we begin an exercise to 

EXPORTING CAD DATA | 273
create a customized conﬁguration for export settings, we will brieﬂy explore the various set-
tings that can be saved and applied to any list of views to complete the export process. Click the 
ellipsis button at the top of the dialog box. A tooltip will appear showing the associated com-
mand as Modify Export Setup. The Modify DWG/DXF Export Setup dialog box will appear 
(Figure 7.26).
Figure 7.26 
Modify DWG/DXF 
Export Setup dialog
As you can see, a number of opportunities for customization are offered in this dialog box. 
First, you’ll notice at the left side of the dialog box a list of export setups and icons similar to 
those found in the main DWG Export dialog box. Use these icons to create, duplicate, rename, 
or delete export setups in your project. Let’s take a look at some of the other export settings in 
greater detail.
Layers
The Layers tab was shown previously in Figure 7.26. It contains many options to completely cus-
tomize the export of object styles to layers. Let’s examine each of these settings more closely.
Export Layer Options
At the top of the Layers tab is a drop-down that allows you to specify the overall behavior of 
exported elements. This setting accounts for any graphic overrides that might be applied in a 
Revit view. For example, the Linework tool might have been used to modify the edge of a wall to 
a dashed line. These options determine how that override will be exported to a CAD format.
Export Category Properties BYLAYER And Overrides BYENTITY  This option will 
export unmodiﬁed elements to their respective layer assignments, and their properties 
will remain assigned to the layer. If an object or part of an object has been overridden, the 

274 | CHAPTER 7 INTEROPERABILITY: WORKING MULTIPLATFORM 
overridden element will still be assigned to the respective layer, but the graphic override 
will be applied directly to the entity. In the wall example noted previously, the wall edge 
would still be assigned to the A-WALL layer but would have a DASHED linetype instead of a 
BYLAYER assignment.
Export All Properties BYLAYER, But Do Not Export Overrides  If the recipients of your 
CAD ﬁle will use scripts or macros to enforce their own graphic standards to the exported 
data, select this option. Using the wall example again, the wall elements would be assigned 
to the A-WALL layer; however, the dashed line overrides would not be exported. This style 
of export is usually appropriate for engineers who need to use architectural plans as back-
ground information and thus will override all elements to halftone.
Export All Properties BYLAYER, And Create New Layers For Overrides  This ﬁnal 
option will assign default objects to layers based on their categories; however, any elements 
with graphic overrides will be assigned to new layers that are subsets of the original layer. 
When we continue with the previous wall example, the unmodiﬁed wall elements will be 
assigned to the A-WALL layer, but the overridden edge will be assigned to a new layer such 
as A-WALL-3, where the properties of the element are all BYLAYER and the new layer con-
tains the dashed linetype. In our opinion, this option is less useful because there is no control 
over the naming of the new layers, thus creating potential confusion for the recipients of the 
exported ﬁles.
Load Layers From Standards
Several exporting templates based on the industry-standard layering guidelines are included 
(Figure 7.27) with the Revit application and can be applied in the Load Layers From Standards 
drop-down. Similarly to import settings, you may want to create customized layer export tem-
plates and save them with your project data for future reference. Export templates may inherit 
the layer names of linked CAD ﬁles in your active project. Because of this, we recommend sav-
ing a copy of your export templates in a ZIP archive in case you need to return to the original 
template.
Figure 7.27 
Industry-standard lay-
ering conventions can 
be applied to export 
settings.
Layer names and colors can also be customized by directly editing the values in the Layers 
tab in the Modify DWG/DXF Export Setup dialog box. Each category and subcategory is capable 
of independent color and layer names.
Layer modiﬁers can be applied to any or all of the model categories for export. To do this, 
either click in the Layer Modiﬁers column for any of the listed model categories and then click 
the Add/Edit button that appears or click the Add/Edit Modiﬁers For All button. Either method 
will open the Add/Edit Layer Modiﬁers dialog box (Figure 7.28). Here you can assign modiﬁers 
such as phase status, workset, view type, or user-customized ﬁelds.

Switch to the Lines tab in the Modify DWG/DXF Export Setup dialog box, and you will ﬁnd addi-
tional settings for assigning Revit line patterns to CAD-based linetypes (Figure 7.29). The ﬁrst 
setting at the top of the tab is to assign the linetype scale in the exported CAD ﬁles. This option 
can be conﬁgured to Modelspace, Paperspace, or Scaled Linetype Deﬁnitions. This setting can be 
changed by the recipient of the exported ﬁles, so it is common to use the Modelspace setting for 
any model view exports, such as plans or elevations, and the Paperspace setting for sheet views.
Figure 7.29 
Line styles can be 
assigned to speciﬁc 
CAD linetypes.

276 | CHAPTER 7 INTEROPERABILITY: WORKING MULTIPLATFORM 
In the main list within the Lines tab, any line patterns deﬁned in your Revit project can be 
assigned to a speciﬁc CAD-based linetype. The default linetype deﬁnitions ﬁle is included with 
Revit, but it can be changed with the command buttons above the line patterns list. The default 
setting for exporting line patterns is Automatically Generate Linetype, which will replicate the 
graphic pattern but will not integrate well with any other CAD software if the exported ﬁles 
require additional modiﬁcation by the recipient.
Patterns
As with lines, the exporting of ﬁll patterns can be completely customized. Switch to the Patterns 
tab (Figure 7.30), and you will see similar options to specify a default CAD-based pattern ﬁle 
as well as the ability to assign Revit ﬁll patterns to hatch patterns that are native to AutoCAD 
software.
Figure 7.30 
Fill patterns can be 
assigned to CAD 
hatch patterns.
Figure 7.30 shows a few of the Revit ﬁll patterns to be mapped to a respective pattern from 
the AutoCAD pattern deﬁnition.
Similar customizations can also be made for fonts in the Text & Fonts tab, and in the Colors 
tab you can choose to either use speciﬁc layer-based color IDs or use the true color RGB val-
ues assigned in your Revit project. Let’s take a quick look at the remaining tabs and their 
importance.
Solids
In the Solids tab, you have the option to select either Polymesh or ACIS Solids for exporting 3D 
views. For cleaner solid geometry exporting, we recommend the ACIS Solids option; however, 
this will likely result in a larger ﬁle size upon export.

EXPORTING 2D CAD DATA | 277
Units & Coordinates
One of the most important settings is Coordinate System Basis, which can be found in the Units 
& Coordinates tab. This option will affect the ability of your exported ﬁles to be properly aligned 
with other project ﬁles. Refer to Chapter 6 for more information on using shared coordinates.
General
Finally, the General tab (Figure 7.31) contains some additional options such as assignment of 
nonplottable layers, exporting space boundaries, and default export ﬁle options.
Figure 7.31 
General options 
allow further cus-
tomization of CAD 
exports.
At this time, you can click the Cancel button to close both active dialog boxes. In the next sec-
tion, you will return to these settings and save a conﬁguration to be applied to the export process.
Exporting 2D CAD Data
When you are collaborating with others who require 2D CAD, developing a planned strategy 
will allow you to share your Revit data more efﬁciently and consistently. We highly recommend 
that you determine and document the scope of data to be shared, the schedule by which the ﬁles 
will be shared (when and how often), and the software platforms to be used on a project. These 
aspects should be compiled in a BIM execution plan, as explained in Chapter 6.
To facilitate the setup and ultimate export of plan data, you can create copies of ﬂoor plans 
and ceiling plans with a standardized naming convention in your Revit project. These should 
be easy to recognize, and they help in building the export list. Figure 7.32 shows a series of 
duplicated plans that have been created and assigned to the ﬂoor plan type named Export. The 
view name conforms to the naming convention speciﬁed by the United States National CAD 
Standard (www.nationalcadstandard.org).

278 | CHAPTER 7 INTEROPERABILITY: WORKING MULTIPLATFORM 
Figure 7.32 
View organization for 
plans to be exported
In the following exercise, you will continue to use the c07-Sample-Building-Start.rvt 
project ﬁle while using the saved list of views you created in the “Preparing a List of Views for 
Exporting” exercise:
1. From the Application menu, click Export ➢ CAD Formats ➢ DWG. In the DWG Export 
dialog box, make sure PLANS is selected in the Export drop-down. Click the Modify 
Export Setup ellipsis button (three dots) at the top of the dialog box.
2. In the Modify DWG/DXF Export Setup dialog box, select the New Export Setup button 
from the bottom left to create a new export setup. Name the new export setup British 
Plans with Phase.
3. In the Layers tab, set the Export Layer Options drop-down list to Export Category 
Properties BYLAYER And Overrides BYENTITY. Locate the Load Layers From Standards 
drop-down list and select British Standard 1192. You will receive an error message stating 
that loading these settings will replace your previous settings. Click Yes to accept.
4. While still in the Layers tab, click the Add/Edit Modiﬁers For All button. In the Add/
Edit Layer Modiﬁers dialog box (Figure 7.33), add the {Phase Status} modiﬁer from the 
list at the left to the Modiﬁers Added list at the right. Next to {Multiple Categories} in 
the Separator column, add a hyphen. The preview above should now read {Multiple 
Categories}-{Phase Status}. Click OK to close this dialog box.
Figure 7.33 
Add a Phase Status 
modiﬁer to all

5. Switch to the Units & Coordinates tab and set Coordinate System Basis to Shared by click-
ing the radio button. Click OK to close the Modify DWG/DXF Export Setup dialog box.
6. Click the Next button to continue the exporting process. In the Export CAD Formats–
Save To Target Folder dialog box, set the Naming drop-down list to Automatic–Short. 
This will create ﬁles named similarly to FloorPlan-A-FP01.dwg.
7. Uncheck the Export Views On Sheets And Links As External References setting. 
Although this setting does not affect this exercise, we discuss its importance after the 
exercise.
8. Select an appropriate location on your computer or your network for the exported ﬁles 
and then click OK to complete the export process.
Unfortunately, you cannot customize the naming of the exported ﬁles when you export 
more than one view in a batch process. That said, any kind of ﬁle-renaming tool can be used to 
remove the preﬁx FloorPlan- from exported ﬁles using the Automatic–Short option.
There is one more option that you should understand in the exporting process. In the ﬁnal 
Export CAD Formats dialog box, you will see the option Export Views On Sheets And Links 
As External References. When this option is selected and you are exporting sheet views, any 
views that are placed on those sheets will be exported as separate ﬁles. Those ﬁles will then be 
conﬁgured as external references (Xrefs) in the exported sheets. If you also have other RVT ﬁles 
linked into your current model, they too will be exported as separate CAD ﬁles and conﬁgured 
as Xrefs in the exported ﬁles.
We recommend that you deselect the External Reference option during exporting unless it is 
absolutely necessary. The exporting process will result in fewer ﬁles and more portable and pre-
dictable results for the recipients of your exported data.
Exporting 3D Model Data
In the previous section, we showed you how to export 2D views to CAD formats, which will 
support more traditional collaboration workﬂows. You can also export your Revit project as a 
3D model in several formats for use in other modeling software. A frequent destination for such 
data is Navisworks software for its enhanced coordination with contractors during construc-
tion. This workﬂow is supported by a free Navisworks plug-in to Revit that will allow you to 
export your models as NWC ﬁles, which Navisworks uses. More generic exports in DWG, DGN, 
DXF, or SAT formats can provide numerous opportunities for you to become more creative with 
the presentation of your designs.
Exporting to SketchUp
Previously in this chapter we discussed using SketchUp for conceptual building massing stud-
ies. These studies were imported directly into the Revit environment for further development 
of a true building information model. Revit model data can also be exported via 3D DWG to 
SketchUp, where visualization studies can be conducted on an entire project or even a simple 
wall section.
In the following exercise, we will export a wall section study from the Revit environment to 
SketchUp using ﬁles you can download from this book’s web page. To complete this exercise, 
you will need to download SketchUp from www.sketchup.com and install it.

280 | CHAPTER 7 INTEROPERABILITY: WORKING MULTIPLATFORM 
To begin the exercise, follow these steps:
1. Open the ﬁle c07-Sketchup-Wall-Study.rvt.
2. Activate the Default 3D view and enable the Section Box option in the Properties palette 
for the view.
3. Set the detail level of the view to Medium or Fine.
4. Select the section box in the 3D view, and shape handles will appear on each face. Grab 
the shape handle of one side of the section box parallel to the vertical edge of the wall 
sample, and drag toward the wall until the section box intersects the wall, as shown in 
Figure 7.34.
Figure 7.34 
Using the section box 
to expose the layers of 
the wall
You should see the layers of the wall structure exposed.
5. With the section box still selected, right-click and choose Hide In View ➢ Elements.
This will prevent the section box from being exported.
6. Click the Application menu and select Export ➢ CAD Formats ➢ DWG Files. Set the 
Export drop-down list to <Current View/Sheet Only>.
7. Click the Modify Export Setup ellipsis button to open the Modify DWG/DXF Export 
Setup dialog box. In the Modify DWG/DXF Export Setup dialog box, switch to the Solids 
tab and set the option to Polymesh. Click OK to close the Modify DWG/DXF Export 
Setup dialog box.

EXPORTING 3D MODEL DATA | 281
8. Click Next and set the Files Of Type drop-down to AutoCAD 2013 DWG Files. Select a 
location on your computer or network and then click OK to save the ﬁle.
9. Launch SketchUp, and choose File ➢ Import.
10. Switch the Files Of Type option to AutoCAD Files, navigate to the ﬁle saved in step 8, and 
click Open.
11. Switch to the Select tool, select the entire DWG import, right-click, and choose Explode.
This will allow you to directly edit the elements in the SketchUp environment. Other compo-
nents within the exploded model may need to be exploded again.
Once the DWG model is loaded in SketchUp, you can use the Paint Bucket tool to apply materi-
als to individual components, use the Push/Pull tool to hide or expose layers of the wall construc-
tion, and use the line tools to customize the proﬁle of the revealed layers, as shown in Figure 7.35.

3D Exports by Level
Effective coordination between Revit and AutoCAD® MEP software frequently relies on the 
exchange of 3D DWG ﬁles of limited scope with respect to the overall project. MEP engineers 
using AutoCAD MEP will usually manage their BIM with one model ﬁle per level. Even though the 
entire architectural model can be exported to a single DWG model, they may not be able to refer-
ence such a large model eﬃciently. Te good news? Your Revit project can be set up to achieve this 
by creating 3D views with section boxes for each level.

282 | CHAPTER 7 INTEROPERABILITY: WORKING MULTIPLATFORM 
continued
 Begin by creating a series of ﬂ oor plans designed for exporting (discussed previously in this chap-
ter). In the View Range settings for these plans, set the Top value to Level Above, Oﬀ set: 0 and the 
Bottom value to Associated Level, Oﬀ set: 0. Create a 3D view for each level required in the project 
and rename the views according to your standards. In each duplicated 3D view, right-click the 
ViewCube®, select Orient To View ➢ Floor Plans, and choose the corresponding ﬂ oor plan with the 
adjusted view range. T is series of 3D views can be saved in an export list and batch-exported to 
3D DWG when needed for collaboration, as shown here:
 
 
 Using IFC Interoperability 
 Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) are the data model standard developed by buildingSMART 
International to support interoperability in the building industry. The IFC model speciﬁ cation is 
registered by the International Standards Organization (ISO) as ISO/PAS 16739 and is currently 
in the process of becoming the ofﬁ cial International Standard ISO/IS 16739. Because of its focus 
on ease of interoperability between BIM software platforms, some government agencies are 
requiring IFC format deliverables for publicly funded building projects. 

EXPORTING 3D MODEL DATA | 283
Some scenarios where IFC exchange may apply and facilitate data exchange include, but are 
not limited to, the following:
 
◆
Linking AutoCAD MEP software into a Revit project
 
◆
Using Solibri Model Checker or Viewer for model quality audits
 
◆
Coordination between Revit projects and Nemetschek Allplan, Vectorworks, or ArchiCAD
 
◆
AutoCodes Project by Fiatech
 
◆
Construction-Operations Building Information Exchange (COBie) deliverables
 
◆
GSA spatial validation
You can export the Revit model quite effectively to IFC 2×2, IFC 2×3, IFC 4, IFC GSA 2×3, or 
any of the other IFC formats by clicking the Application menu and selecting Export ➢ IFC. The 
resulting IFC ﬁle (Figure 7.36) can be viewed in a number of programs that can be downloaded 
at no cost from any of the following websites:
 
◆
DDS-CAD Open BIM Viewer from Data Design System (www.dds-cad.net)
 
◆
Solibri Model Viewer (www.solibri.com)
 
◆
IFC Viewer (www.ifcbrowser.com)
 
◆
Tekla BIMsight (www.tekla.com)
Figure 7.36

to IFC format

284 | CHAPTER 7 INTEROPERABILITY: WORKING MULTIPLATFORM 
Importing IFC data into the Revit environment is similar to the process for importing 3D 
CAD geometry; however, the data generated is intended to be more intelligent and editable. 
Although this method has great potential, the accuracy of the Revit IFC import is highly depen-
dent on the software used to generate the IFC output. We recommend the use of one of the free 
IFC viewers listed previously to inspect IFC data prior to importing into a Revit project.
Viewing the Contents of an IFC Format File
Did you know that an IFC ﬁle can be viewed in a text editor such as Notepad? Download a sample 
ﬁle from the book’s companion web page and check it out! Right-click an IFC ﬁle, select Open With, 
and choose Notepad.
After you’ve reviewed the contents of the IFC ﬁle, you can link it into a Revit project and inte-
grate it into your coordination process as follows:
1. Start a new project with any default template. From the Insert tab in the ribbon, click  
Link IFC.
2. Navigate to the c07-Structure.ifc ﬁle and click Open.
3. Save the project ﬁle.
4. Open the default 3D view and inspect the linked geometry.
If an updated IFC ﬁle is received, overwrite the linked ﬁle you used in the previous steps. 
When the host project ﬁle is reopened, the linked IFC content will be updated.
Downloading and Customizing the Open Source IFC Exporter
In addition to offering a basic IFC export command in the default installation of Revit,  
Autodesk has been developing an improved IFC exporter on the website SourceForge.net 
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/ifcexporter). Anyone can download the source code 
for this exporter and contribute to its development. This allows a larger international commu-
nity to provide input on the improvement of this important feature.
The open source exporter consists of two separate downloads and installations: the exporter 
and a custom export UI. After they are installed, you can still launch the IFC export command 
from the Application menu; however, you will see a new Export IFC dialog box (Figure 7.37). 
Much like the CAD export process described earlier in this chapter, this interface allows you to 
create, customize, and save export setups.
For advanced IFC exporting options, click the Modify Setup button in Figure 7.37. There are 
several tabs across the top of the Modify Setup dialog box that allow you to customize the IFC 
export setup (Figure 7.38). In addition to the predeﬁned export conﬁgurations, you can create 
and save your own setups that will be maintained in the Revit project ﬁle.
An excellent resource for IFC interoperability in Revit is the buildingSMART alliance web 
page for Common Building Information Model Files (www.nibs.org/?page=bsa_commonbimfiles). 
You can download sample ﬁles as well as a conﬁguration guide with additional instructions 
related to customizing IFC exports from Revit.

Classifying IFC Export Settings
Because exporting to IFC format is about converting one model format to another, settings are 
not related to layer conversions, linetypes, or text, as they are in a CAD export. Rather, it is criti-
cal to correctly map the logic of the Revit model organization to the open data standard. In other 
words, model object categories must be mapped to IFC entities; for example, walls in Revit will 
be exported as IfcWall entities. This translation seems quite logical for walls and other objects, 
but consider an electric receptacle. Such a device would be categorized in Revit as Electrical 
Fixture; however, it is classiﬁed as IfcFlowTerminal in the open standard. Entities are further 
reﬁned with types—in this case, IfcFlowTerminalType—that would help distinguish an electric 
receptacle from other IfcFlowTerminal entities such as a faucet or an air diffuser.
The schema of the currently released standard (IFC4) can be viewed at www.buildingsmart-
tech.org, the portal for the Model Support Group and Implementation Support Group. 
Although IFC4 is the currently released standard, many workﬂows still use IFC2x3, including 
native export from Revit software. If you work with IFC export and import regularly in the 
Revit environment, you should become familiar with some of the common classiﬁcations in the 
IFC schema. You’ll ﬁnd the IFC2x3 and IFC4 schema indexes here:
www.buildingsmart-tech.org/ifc/IFC2x3/TC1/html/index.htm
www.buildingsmart-tech.org/ifc/IFC4/final/html/index.htm

286 | CHAPTER 7 INTEROPERABILITY: WORKING MULTIPLATFORM 
Click Alphabetical Listing and then Entities, and you will be able to browse through some of 
the most common IFC classiﬁcations related to building elements. For example, ﬁnd and click 
IfcCovering, and you will see that this classiﬁcation is used for wall claddings, ﬂooring, and 
suspended ceilings.
One aspect of the Revit project model that can be exported to IFC is a structural grid. These 
datum objects are beneﬁcial to the coordination process if you are using Solibri Model Checker 
or Viewer or Tekla BIMsight; however, they are not exported if you use the default IFC export 
settings in Revit. Let’s solve that problem with a quick exercise. You can continue to use the 
c07-Sample-Building-Start.rvt ﬁle.
1. From the Application menu, click Export ➢ Options ➢ IFC Options.
You might need to scroll down the Export menu to see the Options ﬂyout.
2. In the IFC Export Classes dialog box (Figure 7.39), ﬁnd the entry for Grids and set IFC 
Class Name to IfcGrid. You must manually enter any IFC entities and types into this dia-
log box; therefore, you should always refer to the buildingSMART website for accurate 
classiﬁcations.
Figure 7.39 
Customize the 
mapping of Revit 
categories to IFC 
entities.
3. Click OK to close the IFC Export Classes dialog box.
You can save the IFC mappings to a text ﬁle for use in other projects.

EXPORTING 3D MODEL DATA | 287
4. From the Application menu, click Export ➢ IFC. If you are not using the custom IFC 
exporter that we discussed earlier in this chapter, simply set the export ﬁle type to 
IFC2×3 and save the ﬁle to your computer or network.
5. Open the IFC ﬁle in an application such as Solibri Model Checker or Viewer, and you will 
be able to see the Revit grid lines in the model-only exported format.
There are two other methods to customize the classiﬁcation mappings for IFC. One is to 
use subcategories in families. As an example, a Revit family created for an elevator has been 
assigned to the Generic Models category; however, a subcategory named Elevators was created 
in the family (Figure 7.40).
Figure 7.40 
Create subcategories in 
a family for customized 
classiﬁcation.
After the elevator family is loaded into a project, the new subcategories can be assigned to an 
appropriate IFC classiﬁcation. Click the Application menu and then click Export ➢ Options ➢ 
IFC Options to open the IFC Export Classes dialog box. Locate the Revit category for Generic 
Models, and you will also see the Elevators subcategory, as shown in Figure 7.41. For IFC Class 
Name, enter IfcTransportElement and for Type, enter IfcTransportElementType, and you will 
be ready to export your project with the additional object classiﬁcations.
The second method of classiﬁcation customization is to use two speciﬁc shared parameters 
associated with a family. These parameters must be named IfcExportType and IfcExportAs, as 
shown in Figure 7.42, but they can simply be selected from a shared parameters ﬁle downloaded 
from the Common BIM Files web page mentioned previously in this chapter. When these fami-
lies are loaded into and placed in a project, the IFC classiﬁcations will be automatically mapped 
according to the values speciﬁed in these parameters.

 Managing Revit Projects 
 In this chapter, you will take an in-depth look at how to manage Autodesk® Revit® projects 
within your ofﬁ ce. We will explain strategies for the processes needed to support your 
project. We will discuss how to review your Revit projects and then determine the state of 
project health. As you will see, through proactive management, you will be able to address 
potential issues before they become major problems. This is the difference between being 
strategic with your projects’ technical approach versus being reactionary to a project’s 
 technical issues.

 Understanding the Importance of Managing 
Revit Projects 
 The authors of this book collectively have extensive experience in the architecture, engineering, 
and construction (AEC) industry. For a large part of our careers, we have been involved in uti-
lizing Autodesk Revit on projects and have delved into the larger building information model-
ing (BIM) landscape. We have traveled the globe discussing Revit projects with a wide variety 
of companies. We’ve seen the complete range of companies with Revit practices, from large to 
small and from the best in class to those who have recently adopted Revit. We’ve seen compa-
nies who have become very successful with Revit, those companies that struggle with Revit, 
and everything in between. Regardless of company size, the organizations that are successful 
with Revit have at a minimum one critical thing in common: they have implemented a plan to 
 manage Revit. 
 What’s in a Plan to Manage Revit Projects? 
 Let’s be clear, the plan to use Revit on a project is not the same as the plan to manage a Revit 
project. In both Chapter  1 , “Understanding the Principles of BIM,” and Chapter  6 , “Working 
with Consultants,” we covered a concept called BIM uses. We also brieﬂ y reviewed the con-
ceptual frameworks developed by Penn State University, buildingSMART International, and 
the UK BIM Task Group, which are all outstanding resources that help companies identify

292 | CHAPTER 8 MANAGING REVIT PROJECTS
the purpose, goals, and results needed for their respective BIM programs. Companies 
capitalize on this idea, and from the BIM uses, they develop the BIM execution plan (BEP), 
a guideline document that deﬁnes how they intend to use BIM throughout the duration 
of a project. We also covered in Chapter 6 the relationships needed for interdisciplinary 
coordination and how to effectively conduct BIM with a multidisciplinary team. Chapter 7, 
“Interoperability: Working Multiplatform,” then discussed how to utilize Revit to work in 
conjunction with other CAD software platforms. All of these principles culminate in a BIM 
standards document that, when combined with the BIM execution plan, deﬁnes the everyday 
functionality of your BIM projects. But this doesn’t help ensure quality or proper administra-
tion of your projects.
So, what is included in a plan to manage your Revit projects? In Figure 8.1, the top three tiers 
represent the typical plan used by companies for approaching their projects. Over the years, 
thought leadership across the industry has solidiﬁed what is required at those three levels. The 
bottom tier, Revit/BIM Administration, is what is currently lacking in many organizations. This 
represents a plan to manage your Revit projects. Though you cannot administer without a “plan 
for use,” the contract language, the BIM execution plan, and the BIM standards become mean-
ingless documents without a “plan to manage.”

Revit/BIM ADMINISTRATION
(Undeﬁned Process)
Revit/BIM Administration
Let’s discuss the intention of Revit/BIM administration. It is intended to address two key com-
ponents of project delivery.
General Workﬂow and Processes  Controls the submission of BIM deliverables. 
Coordinates the acceptance and handoff of information.
Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC)  Review and vetting of deliverables prior to 
formal submission or acceptance.

UNDERSTANDING THE IMPORTANCE OF MANAGING REVIT PROJECTS  | 293
These concepts are conceptually easy to understand, but the reality of implementing them 
is very different. Though the submission of BIM deliverables is straightforward and can be 
covered by current project management procedures, the handoff of information is often poorly 
managed. In most cases, project teams don’t know if they are delivering the correct information 
beyond what is covered in the physical output of their construction documents. For example, 
if your submission includes construction documents that fully address the constructability of 
your project but the included Revit model is incomplete in required data such as Construction 
Operations Building Information Exchange (COBie), then your submission is incomplete. 
Incomplete submissions put your projects at risk!
This leads to the second point, QA/QC. This process is the safeguard intended to ensure 
deliverables meet contractual requirements, are correct, and are of the highest quality. Though 
many AEC companies have a QA/QC component, it is generally conﬁgured to review design 
and technical information contained within construction documents. With the advent of Revit 
and maturity of BIM across the industry, the documents have become a derivative of BIM; the 
sheets are extracted and expanded upon from the data and geometry authored in the model. 
If you factor in BIM-savvy owners who see opportunities to take BIM beyond the design and 
construction phase and those who mandate BIM requirements, especially on data compliance, to 
address future needs such as operations and maintenance, then the typical  
QA/QC process used today woefully inadequate.
Let’s examine the way in which many companies address the QA/QC of BIM and Revit 
 projects today. Figure 8.2 outlines the usual phases in a U.S.-based project: schematic design (SD), 
design development (DD), construction document (CD), construction (Con), and operations  
and maintenance (O&M). For each project phase, it maps a level of development (LOD).  
For more information, see BIMFORUM (https://bimforum.org/lod/), which deﬁnes the BIM 
speciﬁcation for each model element. Throughout each phase, project teams hand off models 
and continually add data. Though standard document-oriented QA/QC takes place throughout 
the project, the QA/QC of BIM/Revit does not take place until the ﬁnal handoff to the customer. 
When observing it in this context, you can see the inadequacies of the current BIM/Revit  
QA/QC process. You might ask yourself, at this late stage of the project, can you even address 
the accuracy and completeness of the BIM requirements? The answer obviously is “no.”

BIM/Revit QA/QC
Figure 8.3 
Ideal BIM/Revit QA/
QC approach
As before, there are the typical project phases and LOD requirements. Instead of holding off 
the BIM/Revit QA/QC until the end, it is approached incrementally throughout each phase, 
with a major QA/QC check at the end of each phase. This changes the rationale from holding off 
on the BIM requirements until the end but allows for a comprehensive vetting of BIM throughout 
the entirety of the project. It is better to address this a bit at a time instead of tackling it all at once. 
You do this with your QA/QC approach with document deliverables, and you must extend the 
same vigilance to the rest of BIM.
The Process of Administrating Revit
Administrating Revit is a process. It can be as easy or as complex as you need it to be, but there 
must be an understanding of the process by all people involved in the project. In the case of 
administrative activities such as Revit QA/QC, a business process model and notation (BPMN) 
swim lane diagram (Figure 8.4) can be used to visually depict when the activity starts, who 
conducts the activity, the resulting actions of a pass or fail, and how the activity ends.

296 | CHAPTER 8 MANAGING REVIT PROJECTS
Ultimately, we have to ask ourselves, “Are process diagrams for the administration of BIM/
Revit necessary?” It depends. If your company develops only small projects and it’s basically 
you and the owner, then maybe this methodology is a bit too much. But if you are a company 
tackling large-scale, multidisciplinary projects with complex moving parts, then implementing 
a formal process on how your Revit project is being administered offers the following:
 
◆
Clear, concise procedures on actions pertinent to your Revit project
 
◆
An understanding of ownership and accountability to needed activities that support your 
Revit project
 
◆
The ability to track progress, acceptance, and/or rejection of deliverables throughout the 
process
Who Administrates BIM and Revit?
The BIM manager is the individual charged with the successful administration of BIM projects 
within an organization. The manager assists with the development of a project’s BIM execution 
plans, develops and enforces BIM standards, provides guidance, and manages the processes 
that administer BIM. You may be the senior professional who is the designated person at your 
company who manages Revit projects. Or your company may have a dedicated resource or an 
entire department that specializes in the administration of Revit projects. If you ﬁt one of these 
two categories, then congratulations, your organization is ahead of the game and has identiﬁed 
a BIM manager.
With that said, we would like to take this opportunity to make some recommendations to 
those who are looking to reﬁne their BIM and Revit practices and to the individuals who are 
looking to make the administration of BIM their career. A qualiﬁed BIM manager has the fol-
lowing characteristics:
 
◆
Is an architecture or engineering professional who has extensive project experience and 
understands what it takes to put a project together
 
◆
Has an in-depth understanding of BIM practices common to the industry, with the neces-
sary experience to translate the practices to standards and procedures appropriate for their 
organization
 
◆
Has enough IT experience to ensure that the BIM technologies utilized can be maintained, 
supported, and connected to their company’s infrastructure
 
◆
Has an expert knowledge of BIM tools and procedures to ensure proper utilization and 
adoption by their organization
We would like to steer organizations away from a common mistake, where BIM is often 
treated as a drafting tool. We recommend against putting the recent graduate in charge of your 
BIM program just because they have familiarity with utilizing Revit. When you consider the 
complexity of BIM as a concept, when you consider BIM as the commoditized process that is the 
primary means of production, and when you consider that customers are mandating BIM as a 
contractual requirement that contains comprehensive delivery requirements, then asking the 
recent graduate to be your BIM manager and expecting that person to succeed is unfair to that 
individual; more important, you are providing a disservice to your organization.

UNDERSTANDING WHAT’S NEEDED IN A QA/QC PROGRAM | 297
BIM managers are an integral resource for the future of your Revit practice. Like anything 
else that is considered an enterprise-critical position, the BIM manager is an investment that 
must be made.
Understanding What’s Needed in a QA/QC Program
Previously, we’ve examined the importance of managing BIM/Revit projects through a deﬁned 
QA/QC process. Now that you understand the process, let’s discuss the components you need to 
conduct your QA/QC review. This section will not cover everything, but we will examine a core 
concept called the Revit health check, which we hope will empower you to develop your future 
QA/QC practices.
Revit Health Check
If you have opened a Revit ﬁle to examine how it was developed, tried to understand why  
it is not behaving correctly, and then developed an action plan to ﬁx the problem, you have  
conducted what we loosely deﬁne as a Revit health check. We typically go through a compre-
hensive review of individual ﬁles when something goes wrong, but as you work on increasingly 
complicated projects or if you are supporting multiple projects, then this methodology becomes 
quickly unsustainable. In addition, the act of reviewing and diagnosing a ﬁle only when tech-
nical issues arise is very reactionary. Instead, we would rather address projects before they 
become a problem, before they break.
So, instead of reviewing and conducting Revit health checks when projects go wrong, let’s 
shift the existing paradigm and consider regularly conducting health checks for all projects 
as part of the QA/QC process. If you are to pursue this, you can no longer afford to conduct 
time-consuming manual reviews of every Revit ﬁle in a project set. Instead, you must focus on 
the analysis of metrics extracted from the Revit ﬁle to determine whether the project is in good 
order. You must be able to answer the following questions:
 
◆
Are the ﬁles optimized for best performance?
 
◆
Is routine maintenance being conducted on the ﬁles?
 
◆
Are the ﬁles stable and error free?
If the analysis of the gathered metrics can answer these questions, then you can accurately 
determine whether the Revit ﬁle is in good health. If metrics point to an unhealthy ﬁle, then you 
can focus your efforts on resolving only those ﬁles that need attention.
Revit Metrics
The following are the baseline metrics that determine the health of a Revit ﬁle. Each metric 
will be listed by name, with a description of the metric, a conservative range or value for 
what we consider optimal, and comments that we feel are pertinent. Note that as you become 
familiar with analyzing Revit projects based purely on metrics, you may choose to move away 
from our conservative values and instead use values that better represent your company’s 
requirements.

298 | CHAPTER 8 MANAGING REVIT PROJECTS
Original File Size  This represents the digital footprint of your ﬁle as is, prior to any  
QA/QC tasks conducted on the ﬁle. The larger the ﬁle size, the larger the computational 
requirements needed to process the ﬁle.
Value/Range  The maximum ﬁle size should be between 150 MB and 200 MB.
Comment  This value is based on a typical workstation with a midgrade Xeon or i7 
processor and 16 GB of RAM. If your typical workstation loadout is top-of-the-line, 
then the value can be shifted between 200 MB and 250 MB. This metric is relevant in 
that you utilize ﬁle size as one of the barometers for project hardware requirements. 
For example, if the typical workstation utilized by your organization can competently 
handle ﬁles within 150 MB and 200 MB but you observe project ﬁles beginning to ex-
ceed the allowable maximum ﬁle size, then you can anticipate performance issues with 
your existing hardware. You can then address this potential problem by implementing 
ﬁle optimization procedures or incrementally upgrading hardware to meet new ﬁle 
size norms.
Compact File Size  This represents the digital footprint of a workshare-enabled Revit cen-
tral ﬁle after conducting the Compact File command. This action condenses the Revit data-
base by removing any space that is not populated with information.
Value/Range  Optimal value for this metric falls within minus 10 percent of the 
Original File Size value. For example, if the Original File Size value is 200 MB, the accept-
able range is between 200 MB and 180 MB.
Comment  This metric is important in that it veriﬁes that routine maintenance is being 
conducted on the Revit ﬁle. Compacting a Revit ﬁle is typically done weekly and if con-
sistently performed will cause only a slight drop in ﬁle size. An extreme drop in ﬁle size 
usually indicates that routine maintenance actions are not being conducted and the ﬁle is 
unnecessarily bloated.
Purge Unused File Size  This represents the digital footprint of a Revit ﬁle after con-
ducting the Purge Unused command. This command removes any family content that 
is stored in the Revit ﬁle but is not actively being used. For workshare-enabled ﬁles, the 
Compact File command is invoked after the Purge Unused command to determine the 
ﬁnal ﬁle size.
Value/Range  The optimal value for this metric should fall within minus 15 percent of 
the Compact File Size value. For example, if the Compact File Size value is 200 MB, the 
acceptable range should be within 200 MB and 170 MB.
Comment  This metric is not pertinent during the early project phases because of the na-
ture of project development. During the early phases, the project teams may be continually 
loading content to accomplish rapid iterative design. However, during the Construction 
Document phase, it is recommended to monitor this metric since the introduction of new 
content would be limited. Large deviations in ﬁle size after a Purge Unused operation 
would therefore indicate either a signiﬁcant ﬂuctuation in design or the inexperience of 
the project team.

UNDERSTANDING WHAT’S NEEDED IN A QA/QC PROGRAM | 299
Other Metrics for Analysis
Te metrics mentioned in this section were selected because they are considered core baseline met-
rics but also because they can be easily gathered through Windows Explorer or Revit’s interface. As  
you become more proﬁcient in analyzing the health of your Revit ﬁles, and if you have a resource 
proﬁcient in programming in Revit’s API, you can automate the extraction of baseline metrics. In 
addition, the API allows for the extraction of other pertinent metrics that would be otherwise dif-
ﬁcult to gather but are considered extremely relevant in determining the health of a Revit project. 
Tese include the following:
 
◆
Errors and warnings (in Revit 2018 API only)
 
◆
Number of families, in-place families, imported/linked drawings
 
◆
Family ﬁle sizes (min, max, average)
 
◆
Number of views, number of sheets, number of views not on sheet
Number of Worksets  Worksets are available only when a Revit ﬁle is enabled for work-
share. Worksets allow multiple users to work simultaneously in a ﬁle by grouping Revit 
 elements into self-contained, user-deﬁned assemblies.
Value/Range  For Revit ﬁles within 200 MB, the maximum allowable number of work-
sets range between 10 and 15.
Comment  The total number of worksets accommodates the two default worksets gener-
ated when worksharing is enabled. It allocates four worksets for potential Revit linked 
models, four user-deﬁned worksets for logical model assemblies, and ﬁve worksets to 
accommodate any project-speciﬁc worksharing needs. If the number of worksets is below 
or above the range, this may indicate a poor workshare strategy.
Number of Errors and Warnings  This number represents the total number of errors and 
warnings logged within the Revit ﬁle. A high number of errors and warnings exceeding 500 
may impact ﬁle performance. Excessive errors and warnings may result in ﬁle corruption.
Value/Range  An allowable number of errors and warnings is allocated to one warning 
for every 1 MB of ﬁle size. For a 200 MB ﬁle, the total numbers of errors and warnings 
should not exceed 200.
Comment  There are many opinions on what this number should be. We’ve seen projects 
where the mandate is for zero errors and warnings, in which case anything other than zero 
is unacceptable. We’ve also seen project teams set a limit of 500 errors and warnings during 
the early phases of design to allow for some ﬂexibility while quickly iterating through de-
sign conﬁgurations. However, this is with the understanding that in subsequent phases as 
the design is stabilized, the errors and warnings are addressed. We’ve taken a conservative 
stance on this number with the assumption that the health check would be conducted on a 
regular basis and the errors and warnings addressed incrementally between each QA/QC 
review, with the ﬁnal goal of having zero errors and warnings.

300 | CHAPTER 8 MANAGING REVIT PROJECTS
Visual Analysis of Revit Metrics
In the previous section we discussed gathering metrics for the purpose of analyzing the health 
of a Revit ﬁle. Ultimately, the extracted metrics distill to numbers. We love numbers because 
they do not lie. However, you can lie to yourself through either over-analysis or under-analysis 
of the data. You must therefore always conduct your analysis with the full understanding of 
how Revit performs and accommodate an acceptable variance to ensure you are not being overly 
rigid with your analysis.
Because of the potential volume of data points to be analyzed and your desire to accommo-
date an acceptable variance, the best way to assess metrics is through visual analysis. Visual 
analysis is simply plotting metrics to a graph in relation to contextual information that is consid-
ered relevant (see Figure 8.7). Compare the readability of the information captured in the data 
table versus the same information represented in the visual analysis graph. In the previous sec-
tion, we discussed the Original File Size metric and deﬁned that the allowable maximum range 
is between 150 MB and 200 MB. When analyzing the data table, it is not easily made clear which 
Revit ﬁles are within the range. However, the visual analysis graph instantly brings to attention 
two ﬁles, A-01-FFF.rvt and A-01-FFG.rvt.
Figure 8.7 
Original File Size data 
table versus Original 
File Size visual analysis 
graph
Now that you can quickly visualize the data, let’s analyze it in a different way. If you were 
to apply a rigid interpretation that ﬁle sizes cannot exceed the allowable range, A-01-FFG.rvt 
(208 MB) would be ﬂagged for exceeding the allowance. Based on the results of this metric, do 
you have reason to panic? Realistically, the single data point reports the metric within 4 percent 
of the upper allowable limit. Based on this, at ﬁrst glance, the answer is, “There’s no need to 
panic!” Even with this initial assessment, because you are dealing with data analysis, you must 
make every effort to validate your hypothesis. If you have an abundance of the same data  
metric on the same entity across multiple periods of time, you can conduct a trend analysis  
(see Figure 8.8).

UNDERSTANDING WHAT’S NEEDED IN A QA/QC PROGRAM | 301
In the trend analysis, we plotted the original data point of the ﬁle size taken on March 14, 2017, 
in the center of the graph, then plotted the ﬁle sizes from the previous two weeks, and then cap-
tured and plotted the ﬁle size during the following two weeks. After plotting these points on 
our analysis graph, we calculated the ﬁve-week average, which puts the average ﬁle size at 204 MB, 
which is only a 2-percent deviation from our maximum allowable of 200 MB. Based on this 
analysis and if we rationalize the result within a process improvement scheme like Six Sigma, 
we would’ve validated that a 2-percent deviation is well within an acceptable variance.
Figures 8.7 and 8.8 demonstrate the power of analyzing metrics within a small dataset, but we 
want to impress upon you the power of analysis with larger datasets (see Figure 8.9). We quickly 
plotted the ﬁle sizes for 34 Revit ﬁles and mapped the Original File Size, Compacted File Size, and 
Purged File Size values. From experience we know that in later project phases, large ﬁle size reduc-
tions from Original File Size to Compact File Size to Purged File Size are indicators of inadequate 
ﬁle maintenance. By conducting this analysis, we were able to quickly isolate nine ﬁles that required 
further analysis. This is much better than blindly committing to the review of all 34 ﬁles.

302 | CHAPTER 8 MANAGING REVIT PROJECTS
We could endlessly discuss the potential application of Revit metrics analysis as a primary 
means to conduct QA/QC on Revit projects. This technique affords you with the ability to rap-
idly review a large volume of ﬁles quickly and repeatedly. Implementation of this technique 
becomes a schedulable and actionable item, an ideal toolset to coincide with a QA/QC program. 
It determines which ﬁles require greater levels of attention, but most important, it gives you the 
ability to address potential issues before they become critical problems.

 Part 3 
 Modeling and Massing 
for Design 
In Part 2, we covered the topics that help you deﬁ ne important project standards when using 
Autodesk® Revit® 2018 software—within your team as well as across external teams with other 
consultants. In this section, we’ll delve into the use of Revit from the earliest design stages to 
 analysis, iteration, and ﬁ nally visualization.

 Chapter  9 
 Advanced Modeling and Massing 
 Every design starts with an idea. These ideas can take the form of shapes drawn out on trace 
paper, a chipboard model, or a conceptual form in a 3D model. This idea becomes the basis for 
your design ultimately evolving into your building. Although you might sketch out several 
variations to give your ideas shape, there comes a point in the design process where you need 
to begin testing your assumptions. Does the ﬂ oor plan ﬁ t within the building’s massing? Does 
it meet the client’s functional requirements? Is the design energy efﬁ cient? Revit’s massing 
tools can help your designs become quantiﬁ able forms that can transition your concept into a 
schematic. 
 Massing is a set of unique tools within Autodesk® Revit® software speciﬁ cally created for 
this kind of early design analysis. By creating the “big” design idea at a macro level, you are able 
to quickly and easily quantify and analyze the results. This allows you to conﬁ dently work from 
general to speciﬁ c as your design progresses, without concern about actual building elements. 
 In addition, the massing tools allow you to create forms and containers to control other 
building system components. Complex walls, curtain walls, curtain panels, and other elements 
would be incredibly difﬁ cult to make and update without some underlying form to establish 
and drive their design. 
 Even though your overall design might not be represented by a complex massing form, it is 
likely that somewhere in a more conventional design, massing is essential to the success of your 
project. 
 In this chapter, you will learn to

 Create and schedule massing studies 
 
◆
 Know when to use solid and surface masses 
 
◆
Use mathematical formulas for massing 
 T e Massing User Interface and Functionality 
A  mass is simply a form with geometric substance (solids and voids) that is not related to any 
 speciﬁ c building element category. It is intended to allow designers to create a lightweight com-
ponent that can represent either an entire building or a building system. Alternatively, it can 
serve as a guide for a single component, such as a complex roof form. When you create a mass in 
the context of a whole building, you can quantify the surface area, assign functional “ﬂ oors” to 
the mass, and perform energy analysis—all without creating a single wall, ﬂ oor, window, or roof.

306 | CHAPTER 9 ADVANCED MODELING AND MASSING
After you create a whole-building mass, you can use By Face versions of commands to place 
system families such as walls, ﬂoors, and roofs. When these elements are placed by face, they 
retain a relationship to the mass elements. The associated building elements are not updated 
automatically, which means you can freely explore design alternatives to the massing. Once 
you are conﬁdent of your design decisions, the building elements can be updated to match the 
changes in the underlying mass.
Another important thing to know about massing is that masses can be created in either the 
project environment or the Family Editor. Much of the functionality overlaps in each case, so 
what is the difference between the two?
The main difference as to whether you create massing in place or in the Family Editor does 
not depend on the kind of shape or surface you want to create. Solid and surface forms can be 
created in both the project and Family Editor environments. Rather, it depends on how you 
want to create the massing and how you want to change the mass once it has been created.
Using in-place masses gives you the ability to model in the context of other surroundings 
(Figure 9.1). For example, you may be proposing an addition to an existing building or a new 
building on an existing campus. You may need to create a complex shape for a feature wall or  
a roof form, and you therefore need the context of the rest of your building design.
Figure 9.1 
Building massing in 
the context of an  
existing  
neighborhood
Creating a mass in the Family Editor gives you a slightly different user interface (UI)  
(Figure 9.2). When you create a Conceptual Mass family, you have the ability to see work planes 
and levels in 3D views; however, these references are not in the context of your project environ-
ment. In addition to the lack of context in the Family Editor, to make changes to massing, you 
must reload the mass families into your project for face-based elements and schedules to update.
Let’s take a moment to clarify the difference between in-place component modeling and 
massing. If you need to create a custom-shaped building element, such as the wall shown in 
Figure 9.3, you would use the Model In-Place command. You would set the category to Walls 
and then use either a blend or a sweep to generate the form of the wall. You will notice in the 
ﬁgure that the sectional dimensions of the wall are not consistent.

THE MASSING USER INTERFACE AND FUNCTIONALITY | 307
Figure 9.2 
Building massing in 
the Family Editor
If you wanted to use a wall assembly with consistent sectional dimensions but conﬁgure the 
wall in a complex vertical layout, you would create a mass and then use the Wall By Face com-
mand. In the example shown in Figure 9.4, a generic wall is applied to the face of a mass that 
was created by generating a surface between two splines.
The rest of this chapter will focus solely on the creation of masses for the purpose of whole-
building design. You can learn more about component modeling tools in Chapter 15, “Designing 
with the Family Editor.”

an in-place element

308 | CHAPTER 9 ADVANCED MODELING AND MASSING
Creating Mass Geometry
How you create masses (surface or solid) differs signiﬁcantly from the UI used to create other 
standard family content. When you are creating standard project content, you have speciﬁc 
geometry tools such as Extrusion and Sweep (Figure 9.5). In some ways, this is a noun-verb 
approach: you select a tool for the form that you want to create and then you take action to 
create it.
Figure 9.4

of a mass
Figure 9.5 
Family Forms  
creation tools
Figure 9.6 
Te Create Form tool
Creating a mass still requires that you know the form you intend to create, but you are not 
required to select a particular form type to get started. Rather, you start by simply creating 
the sketch-based elements that would deﬁne your shape. Then you select them as a group and 
choose the Create Form tool (Figure 9.6). This will allow you to create both solids and voids.
Both solid and surface may be created from model lines or reference lines; however, the 
 differences are important. Keep in mind that your ability to further iterate the form that you 
 create depends on whether you use model or reference lines to generate the form, even though 
the forms created may look exactly the same at ﬁrst.

THE MASSING USER INTERFACE AND FUNCTIONALITY | 309
If your intent is to simply create a form that is not likely to require rule-based parameteriza-
tion, using model lines is ﬁne. Model lines are consumed by the form after you use the Create 
Form tool. In other words, the only way to get back to your original sketch form is to dissolve 
the shape. But if you intend to control the form with formulas and other parameters, it is best to 
start with reference lines. Figure 9.7 shows the subtle graphic difference between the two line 
types. The model line shape is on the left, and the green reference lines are on the right. You will 
also notice that when reference lines are selected, they have much more capability to serve as 
multidimensional references for hosting other geometry.
Because the difference is so subtle on the screen, we recommend you give your reference 
lines more thickness and lighten the default green color so that they stand out better and make 
that a part of your project template.
Creating an In-Place Mass
Now that you are familiar with the difference between massing for components and  whole-building 
massing, let’s look closer at the important capabilities that will help you develop building designs. 
Download and open the ﬁle c09-Massing-1-Start.rvt or c09-Massing-1-Start-Metric.rvt 
from this book’s website at www.sybex.com/go/masteringrevit2018. In this section, we will cre-
ate some simple mass forms, generate mass ﬂoors, and then build schedule views to quantify the 
results. After you open either ﬁle, activate the Level 1 ﬂoor plan before starting the exercise.
Whether you create masses in place or in the Family Editor, you are able to generate ﬂoor faces 
(not the actual ﬂoors) and schedule important metadata before you have even begun to assign 
actual geometry to the masses. This is important to do early in the design process because the 
masses will be “light” in your project—they will not drastically impact performance. Use them to 
establish your overall design idea and get a general idea for building size and area.
In-place mass forms can be both solid- and surface-based forms; however, masses that con-
tain only surfaces cannot be analyzed for any sort of volumetric quantities. You can start an in-
place mass in one of two ways. The ﬁrst way is to select the Architecture tab in the ribbon, and 
on the Build panel, choose the Component ➢ Model In-Place command.
Figure 9.7 
Model lines and  
reference lines

310 | CHAPTER 9 ADVANCED MODELING AND MASSING
When you select this option, the Family Category And Parameters dialog box appears 
(Figure 9.8). You will be able to use the other massing tools only if the in-place component is 
assigned to the proper category. Be sure to select the Mass category and click OK.
Where Are My Massing Tools?
If you do not see the Massing & Site tab in the ribbon, you might need to activate it. In some 
 installations, these tools are deactivated by default. In the Application menu, click Options and 
then select User Interface. Make sure that the Massing & Site Tab And Tools option is checked.
Figure 9.8 
Selecting the Mass 
category
The other way to create an in-place mass is to select the Massing & Site tab in the ribbon 
and from the Conceptual mass panel, choose the In-Place Mass command. In either case, when 
you start to create the mass, you will want to have the Mass category visible (it is turned off by 
default in all views). Rather than confuse you by allowing you to create objects that would not 
be visible, the software prompts you to turn the category on (Figure 9.9).

THE MASSING USER INTERFACE AND FUNCTIONALITY | 311
Once you close this dialog box, you will be given the opportunity to name your in-place 
mass. In this case, you are going to name the mass Cube (Figure 9.10).

After you have named the mass from the previous steps and clicked OK, you will be shown 
the Massing toolset for in-place families. The Create tab contains the tools that you will use to 
create solid and void geometry including surface-generated masses.
In the following exercise, we will create a cube, pyramid, and sphere (Figure 9.11) to demon-
strate some uses for masses. Starting with the cube, its dimensions are 100′ × 100′ × 100′ (about 
30 m × 30 m × 30 m). The base of the pyramid is the same size as the cube, with equal sides 
tapering to the same height. The sphere is the same width as the cube.

312 | CHAPTER 9 ADVANCED MODELING AND MASSING
You have already started the command with either the Model In-Place or In-Place Mass command. 
The next step will be to create the 3D geometry inside the family. Mass geometry is created in a two-
step process. First, create the 2D shape of the object; then use the Create Form tool to generate the 3D 
geometry. This process is different from typical modeling software applications because it does not 
require you to choose a speciﬁc modeling command before you begin to explore your design.
Now, let’s get into the details with the following steps:
1. For the cube, you will ﬁrst need to sketch a square in a plan view. From the Create tab in 
the ribbon, in the Draw panel, use the Line or Rectangle tool to sketch a 100′ × 100′ 
(30 m × 30 m) square. Detail lines have been placed for your reference.
2. Activate the default 3D view and then click the Modify button in the ribbon. Select one 
of the lines you sketched in the previous step. The closed loop of your sketch will con-
veniently select all lines of the square. From the contextual tab in the ribbon, choose the 
Create Form ﬂyout tool from the Form panel and choose Solid Form. You will see a dimen-
sion in the 3D view that indicates the default height of the extrusion. Click the dimension 
value and then type 100′ (30 m) and press Enter on the keyboard to set the desired height.
3. In the contextual tab of the ribbon, click Finish Mass.
4. Return to the Massing & Site tab in the ribbon, and then click In-Place Mass. Name the 
next mass Sphere.
5. From the Create panel in the ribbon, select the Circle tool from the Draw panel. In the Options 
bar, set Placement Plane to Level : Midpoint and toggle the Radius option set to 50′ (15 m).
You may get a warning that the elements are not visible in the current view. That is ﬁne 
for now; continue to the next step.
6. In a 3D view, click the Modify button in the ribbon and then select the circle. From the 
contextual tab in the ribbon, choose Create Form ➢ Solid Form. This will pop up two 
visual options for you (Figure 9.12). One will allow you to simply extrude the circle and 
create a cylinder; the other will allow you to create a sphere. Choose the Sphere option.
Figure 9.12 
Create Form options 
for a circle
7. In the contextual tab of the ribbon, click Finish Mass.
8. Once again, return to the Massing & Site tab in the ribbon and then click In-Place Mass. 
Name the next mass Pyramid. For this shape, you will need to sketch a square in plan 
and a triangle in elevation before you use the Create Form tool.

THE MASSING USER INTERFACE AND FUNCTIONALITY | 313
9. Activate the Level 1 ﬂoor plan and sketch a square that measures 100′ × 100′ (30 m × 30 m). 
From the Draw panel in the ribbon, click the Plane tool. Draw two reference planes—one 
for each centerline of the square you just sketched (Figure 9.13). Select the horizontal ref-
erence plane, and in the Properties palette set the Name value to Pyramid Ctr.
10. Activate the South elevation view. From the Draw panel in the ribbon, click the Line tool. You 
will be prompted to select a work plane. Choose the Name option, and from the drop-down list 
select Reference Plane: Pyramid Ctr. Sketch a triangle as shown in Figure 9.14. Make sure to use 
intersection and endpoint snapping to make the base of the triangle in line with Level 1 and at 
the intersection of the Top level and the vertical reference plane with the base at 50′ (15 m).
Figure 9.13 
Draw two reference 
planes in the pyramid 
sketch.
Figure 9.14

314 | CHAPTER 9 ADVANCED MODELING AND MASSING
11. In a 3D view, click the Modify button in the ribbon. Select both the square and the tri-
angle, using either the Ctrl key to add multiple selections or windowing over both. Select 
Create From ➢ Solid Form from the contextual tab in the ribbon. The Create Form com-
mand will detect that the most likely conﬁguration of these two 2D shapes is to sweep 
the triangle along the square path, thus forming a pyramid. Click Finish Mass in the con-
textual tab of the ribbon, and you will see the three masses that you have created: cube, 
pyramid, and sphere (Figure 9.15).
Figure 9.15 
Cube, sphere, and 
pyramid
As each form was ﬁnished, the in-place mass was completed, and the process was repeated 
for each new mass. In the Project Browser, locate the Families branch and the Mass category. 
Expand the branch and you will see each mass as a separate item.
Placing a Mass
Continuing with the previous exercise, you will now load and place a mass family. There are 
many premade families in the default libraries for Revit software. We have already loaded a 
mass family in the project ﬁles for this exercise. Continue with the c09-Massing-1-Start.rvt 
or c09-Massing-1-Start-Metric.rvt ﬁle by following these steps:
1. Activate the Level 1 ﬂoor plan. Switch to the Massing & Site tab in the ribbon and click 
Place Mass. In the Type Selector, make sure that either Gable or M_Gable is selected.
2. Click an area to the right of the mass forms you created in the previous exercise steps. 
Click the Modify button in the ribbon and then select the Gable mass you just placed.

THE MASSING USER INTERFACE AND FUNCTIONALITY | 315
3. In the Properties palette, set the following values:
Width: 100′ (30 m)
Depth: 100′ (30 m)
Eave Height: 50′ (15 m)
Height: 100′ (30 m)
When you switch back to a 3D view, you will see the Gable mass family in the same context 
as the in-place masses you created previously (Figure 9.16). All of the mass forms will function 
similarly as you assign mass ﬂoors, place building elements by face, and create schedules. The 
main difference is that to edit the geometry of the placed mass, you must do so by changing the 
values in the Properties palette. Keep in mind that you may also load a different mass family 
and swap one shape for another. You cannot swap an in-place family for a loaded family.
Figure 9.16 
Te Gable mass family 
is placed and modiﬁed.
Creating Mass Floors
Once you have created some solid mass forms, it is important to understand how to create mass 
ﬂoors. Floors can be created from the levels that intersect the mass using the Mass Floor tool. 
This is a great tool to further evolve the concept design into a building schematic design. The 
Mass Floors dialog box allows you to generate some quick ﬂoor plates and get a rough idea of 
the ﬂoor areas available in your masses for visualization or quantiﬁcation. This technique will 
work equally well with in-place masses or loaded mass families.
To create mass ﬂoors, follow these steps:
1. Activate the South elevation view. Use the Copy tool from the Modify tab in the ribbon to 
create more levels in addition to the three provided in the exercise ﬁle. Place the copied 
levels at intervals of 10′ (1500 mm) so you have a total of 10 levels (Figure 9.17).

316 | CHAPTER 9 ADVANCED MODELING AND MASSING
2. In a 3D view, select all the masses and click the Mass Floors button in the contextual tab 
of the ribbon.
3. In the Mass Floors dialog box, check the boxes for all the available levels. This allows you 
to assign a conceptual ﬂoor plate wherever each selected level intersects a mass form. A 
warning stating “Failed to create a Mass Floor” is generated for the sphere, as two of the 
planes (top and bottom) are incidental. Click OK to close the dialog box.
Wherever the selected levels intersect the mass forms, ﬂoor faces will be generated, as shown in 
Figure 9.18. Now the masses and ﬂoor faces can be calculated and scheduled. If you select any one of 
the masses and observe the parameters in the Properties palette, you will see that Gross Floor Area 
now reports an area that will change depending on how many mass ﬂoors are assigned to that mass.
Figure 9.17 
Create multiple  
intersecting levels.
Figure 9.18

Scheduling Masses
With the mass ﬂoors created, you can now schedule them and begin to understand what kinds 
of areas you have for ﬂoor plates in these shapes. Remember, you can do this exercise with any 
type of mass shape, and it can be a great way to validate your building’s program against a 
variety of building forms.
Let’s continue with the exercise by following these steps:
1. From the View tab in the ribbon, click Schedules ➢ Schedule/Quantities, and you will be 
given the option to schedule the Mass category itself or various subcategories, including 

THE MASSING USER INTERFACE AND FUNCTIONALITY | 317
2. Select the ﬁelds Family, Gross Floor Area, Gross Surface Area, and Gross Volume, as shown in 
Figure 9.20. Add them to the Scheduled Fields table by clicking the Add Parameter(s) button.
For this example, we will also show you how to create two calculated values. This will 
allow you to calculate the overall volume of each mass compared to the ﬂoor area, as well 
as the overall surface area compared to the ﬂoor area. Schedules like these will be helpful 
during the early design process to help understand how efﬁcient your design is com-
pared to the volume and surface areas required to contain that space. Follow these steps:
Mass Floor (Figure 9.19). Select Mass, and you will schedule the masses to do a compara-
tive analysis between the different mass types.

a. Click the Add Calculated Parameter button in the Fields tab of the Schedule Properties dia-
log box, and name the new calculated value Volume to Floor Ratio, as shown in Figure 9.21. 

318 | CHAPTER 9 ADVANCED MODELING AND MASSING
In the Formula area, enter the following formula, and be sure to use the correct case: 
(Gross Volume / 1) / Gross Floor Area. In metric units, the formula to enter is (Gross 
Volume / 1m) / Gross Floor Area. To keep the units consistent, you divide the gross vol-
ume by 1′ (1 m) before dividing by the gross ﬂoor area. Click OK to accept the formula.
Figure 9.21 
Create a calculated 
value for volume-to-
ﬂoor ratio.
b. To create your next calculated value, click the Calculated Value button again and name 
this formula Surface to Floor Ratio. In the Formula box, enter the following formula 
and again be sure to maintain the correct case: Gross Surface Area / Gross Floor Area. 
Once you have entered the formula, click OK (Figure 9.22).
Figure 9.22 
Create a calculated 
value for the surface-
to-ﬂoor ratio.
Figure 9.23 shows the ﬁnished schedule. Notice that, proportionally, a sphere and a cube 
have efﬁcient ﬂoor areas compared to their corresponding surface area and volume.
Figure 9.23 
Completed schedule

THE MASSING USER INTERFACE AND FUNCTIONALITY | 319
On the other hand, the pyramid mass will require signiﬁcantly more surface and volume to 
create the same relative surface area as a cube or a sphere; thus, a pyramid takes far more sur-
face area than a cube to contain the same amount of space.
You can download the ﬁnished ﬁle from the book’s web page. It is in the Chapter 9 folder and 
is named c09-Massing-1-Finished.rvt.
Massing Surfaces
Now that we have discussed how to create or place solid mass forms, let’s review some of the 
ways in which you can generate massing surfaces. Similar to the process of creating a solid 
massing form, you can select one or more lines and then use the Create Form tool to generate a 
surface. Figure 9.24 shows a number of reference line types you can create with the Draw tools: 
Spline Through Points, Spline, Curve, and Line.
Figure 9.24 
Reference line  
segment types
Figure 9.25 
Reference line  
control points
As you can see in Figure 9.25, each of these reference lines has different control points that 
allow for further control.

320 | CHAPTER 9 ADVANCED MODELING AND MASSING
These are not closed loops and the form that will generate from each of these segments will 
only be a surface (Figure 9.26). You generate the form by selecting each of the lines (one at a time, 
not together) and then selecting Create Form ➢ Solid Form.
Figure 9.26 
Surface forms
Figure 9.27 
Surfaces based on  
multiple splines
You can also create surface-based forms from more than one line at a time. The result is a 
surface that can be controlled in more complex ways than a single line.
Take the Spline Through Points line, for example. The form on the left in Figure 9.27 creates 
a face that is controlled by a single reference line, whereas the form on the right is a face con-
trolled by two (and it could be more) reference lines.
Moving the location of the control points on the form on the left maintains a consistent height 
to the top of the surface previously generated, whereas moving the control points of the surface 
on the right creates a surface that varies in height (Figure 9.28).

THE MASSING USER INTERFACE AND FUNCTIONALITY | 321
After a surface is generated, it is also possible to add more proﬁles, as illustrated by  
Figure 9.29. A proﬁle is basically a joint in the form, allowing for another control location. Any 
proﬁle you add will respond in the same way the edges of the mass respond, by allowing you to 
modify and manipulate both them and their location. We will demonstrate how to use this tool 
and the rest of the Form Element panel later in the chapter. For now, we will step through some 
of the tools so you can get an understanding of the relationship of tool to form and see how 
quickly you can create forms.

After the proﬁle was added, it was moved to create a bulge in the surface (far right shown in 
Figure 9.30).
Figure 9.30 
Moved proﬁle

322 | CHAPTER 9 ADVANCED MODELING AND MASSING
The fourth iteration of the form was created by selecting the surface and then choosing the 
Dissolve tool in the contextual tab of the ribbon. This removed the surface but left us with all the 
references used to create the form.
Once the face was dissolved, another reference called Spline Through Points was added 
between the upper and lower reference splines. The result is shown in Figure 9.31.
Figure 9.31 
Additional spline

Selecting all three references and then choosing the Create Form tool stitched them all into a 
new single-surface form (Figure 9.32).
Figure 9.32 
New surface form

THE MASSING USER INTERFACE AND FUNCTIONALITY | 323
Selecting the points within the middle reference allowed for even more complex surface con-
trol (Figure 9.33).
Figure 9.33 
Edited center spline
Keep in mind that selecting lines or shapes to create forms is a sequential operation (when it 
is not in a closed loop). Window-selecting all the splines and then creating the surface will result 
in very different forms than if you were to sequentially select adjacent splines (Figure 9.34). 
The result is that the surface form is not interpolated as smooth between the upper and lower 
splines. Instead, a distinct edge is created between the two splines.
Figure 9.34 
Spline-based surfaces
As you can see, it is easy to create complex surface forms using reference lines. Now you’ll 
create complex forms using reference planes.

324 | CHAPTER 9 ADVANCED MODELING AND MASSING
Using Free-Form Building Massing
Now that you are familiar with the basic functionality of the massing tools, you’ll learn how to 
generate and explore building forms in an informal way. The exercise in this section will build 
on the skills you learned in the previous section, and you will learn how to directly manipulate 
solid geometry using grips, gizmos, and dimensions.
Start by downloading and opening either c09-Massing-2-Start.rvt or c09-Massing-
2-Start-Metric.rvt from the book’s web page. Begin the exercise by following these steps:
1. Activate the Level 1 ﬂoor plan. From the Massing & Site tab in the ribbon, click In-Place 
Mass and name the new family Mass 1.
2. From the Draw panel in the ribbon, choose the Rectangle tool. In the Options bar, check 
the box to make a surface from closed loops. Sketch a rectangle that is approximately 
40′ × 90′ (12 m × 28 m). Speciﬁc dimensions are not important; it is more about the 
proportions.
3. Open the Default 3D view, and click the Modify button in the ribbon. Hover the mouse 
pointer over one of the lines in the rectangle sketch. Press the Tab key until you see Form: 
Form Element displayed in the status bar. Select the form element and you will see con-
trols that allow you to pull the surface into a solid (Figure 9.35). Using the control point-
ing in the up direction, press and drag it until the form is about 140′ (43 m) tall.
Figure 9.35 
Creating a solid form
There are a number of shape handles that allow you to modify each face, edge, and inter-
section. Simply hovering over each face, edge, and vertex will highlight the appropriate 
control. You can also press the Tab key on the keyboard to select the desired control. We’ll 
step through some of the selections to give you an idea of what the controls for the faces, 
sides, and points look like.
4. Starting with any vertical face, select it and you will be given the control shown in  
Figure 9.36.
5. Select an edge and you will have the ability to move the edge of a form in multiple direc-
tions (Figure 9.37).

USING FREE-FORM BUILDING MASSING | 325
Figure 9.36 
Face control
Figure 9.37 
Edge control

326 | CHAPTER 9 ADVANCED MODELING AND MASSING
6. Select the point at the intersection of several edges. You will likely need to press the Tab 
key to select a corner point. This control allows you to modify the location of a vertex 
(Figure 9.38).
The control arrow allows you to modify the selected element parallel to the direction 
of the arrow, whereas the angled indicators of the same colors as their corresponding 
arrows allow you to modify the location of the selected element perpendicular to the 
arrow.
There are also some tools to help you with the visualizations of the mass, especially as 
it gets more complex. One of these is the X-Ray tool, which will take a solid and turn it 
into a semitransparent form. Turn on X-Ray mode by selecting the form and clicking the 
X-Ray button on the Form Element panel. This will let you see any of the proﬁles and  
controls on the other side of the object.
Now that X-Ray mode has been enabled, look at the options that are provided for turn-
ing a rather simple, extruded form into something complex. An edge may be added to an 
existing form from vertex to vertex or parallel with the trajectory of the form (shown as a 
dotted line from the upper to the lower face).
7. Click the Modify button in the ribbon and then select the front face of the extruded mass 
you previously created. From the contextual tab in the ribbon, select Add Edge. As you 
mouse over the face you have selected, you will be given a ghosted line to locate the edge. 
Simply click to place it, as shown in Figure 9.39.
Figure 9.38 
Vertex control

USING FREE-FORM BUILDING MASSING | 327
8. Once the edge has been added, you can push or pull the face adjacent to the new edge, as 
shown in Figure 9.40. Click the Modify button and then select the face to the left of the 
edge you created in the previous step. Press and drag the green control arrow to move the 
face back into the extruded form.

to a form

328 | CHAPTER 9 ADVANCED MODELING AND MASSING
9. Select the overall mass form again and then click the Add Proﬁle tool on the Form 
Element panel in the ribbon. You will get the same ghosted line as you did to create the 
edge, but this time it will be the circumference of your element—essentially representing 
the proﬁle at that point. Click to place it as shown in Figure 9.41.
Figure 9.41 
Adding a proﬁle  
to the form
10. Again, click the Modify button in the ribbon and then select the edge at the upper left 
of the extruded form. Use the green control arrow to pull the edge away from the mass 
form. Pushing or pulling a point or single edge will create curved and warped surfaces 
(Figure 9.42). This is ﬁne because the form that you are creating can be rationalized later 
when you are adding a pattern to the surface.
11. Click the Add Edge button in the contextual tab of the ribbon and then click the  
vertices indicated in Figure 9.43 in the order they are numbered. Doing so will force 
the warped faces to become triangulated and planar because three points deﬁne a 
plane.

330 | CHAPTER 9 ADVANCED MODELING AND MASSING
Dissolving and Rebuilding
Now, let’s say you have come to a point in your design exploration when you would like to sim-
plify the mass form you have created and start exploring some other alternatives. The tool to 
perform this function is called Dissolve. Using the Dissolve function will remove the mass solid 
and leave behind the proﬁles that deﬁne the solid. The dot in the center of each plane is a control 
that will allow you to edit the elevation, rotation, and location of each proﬁle.
Continue with the c09-Massing-2-Start.rvt or c09-Massing-2-Start-Metric.rvt ﬁle 
you used for the previous exercise, and follow these steps:
1. In a 3D view, select the entire form and then click Dissolve on the Form Element panel in 
the ribbon. Only the proﬁles will remain, as shown in Figure 9.45.
Figure 9.44 
Pulling the upper edge
Escape the Madness
By now, you are probably tired of constantly clicking the Modify button in the ribbon when you 
need to jump between commands to explore the free-form modeling processes. An easier solution 
is to simply press the Esc key to return to the Modify state.
12. Select the edge at the upper right of the mass form and use the red control arrow to pull 
it away from the form, as shown in Figure 9.44. Again, it is not necessary to maintain the 
exact dimensions of what you see here; it is about trying to keep the proportions appro-
priate. This is what free-form massing is all about!

USING FREE-FORM BUILDING MASSING | 331
2. Select all the remaining proﬁles and then click Create Form ➢ Solid Form. This will stitch 
the form back together in a way that interpolates the shape as more of a lofted blend 
(Figure 9.46). Once the new shape is created, you can add more proﬁles or edit the shape 
using the tools just reviewed.
Figure 9.45 
Using Dissolve to 
remove the mass solid

from three proﬁles

332 | CHAPTER 9 ADVANCED MODELING AND MASSING
There are a few other ways to generate shapes using the proﬁles you just created. For 
instance, if you select only two proﬁles at a time, then you will get a form like the one in 
Figure 9.47. This form was created by ﬁrst selecting the bottom and middle proﬁles and then 
creating the form. Then the middle and upper proﬁles were selected, and another form was 
created. The result is straight—rather than curved—interpolation between the proﬁles.
Figure 9.47 
Making a blend from 
two proﬁles at a time
As another way to generate form using these proﬁles, you can alter the shape of the pro-
ﬁles before you create the form again. In the next steps, you will delete the straight edges 
along one side of the proﬁles and then deﬁne a curved edge.
3. Start by deleting the existing edges along the right side (you will have to tab to select just 
the edges), as shown in Figure 9.48.
Now you will want to draw a ﬁllet arc to rejoin the two remaining edges. Before you can 
draw the arc, you ﬁrst have to deﬁne the right work plane.
4. Click the Set command from the Work Plane panel. Highlight the control point in the cen-
ter of the proﬁle, and press the Tab key to cycle through your options until you get a work 
plane that is parallel to your proﬁle (Figure 9.49). Click to select. Now you will be able to 
draw your arc on the proper plane.
5. From the Draw panel in the ribbon, choose the Fillet Arc tool. Click each edge on either 
side of the open end and then click again to set the arc in place. Once the work plane is 
selected, you will be able to draw additional model lines. In this example, you are using a 
ﬁllet arc to connect the lines. You will do the same thing for the other two shapes.
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for the other two proﬁles.

7. Select the lower two proﬁles and click Create Form ➢ Solid Form. Then do the same with 
the upper two proﬁles. Finally, you will want to remove any blends by adding an edge to 
the opposing edges.
Creating additional mass solids is easy. You can select an existing face, as shown in  
Figure 9.50, and then select the Create Form command.

334 | CHAPTER 9 ADVANCED MODELING AND MASSING
The same tools were used to create the form shown in Figure 9.51. Click the Finish Mass com-
mand in the contextual tab of the ribbon and return to the regular project environment.
Figure 9.50

mass forms
Figure 9.51 
Creating another form
Once you are out of In-Place Massing mode, you will notice that if you select the model, 
many shape handles simultaneously appear in the form of solid blue arrowheads (Figure 9.52). 
You can use shape handles to push and pull your solid mass, but you will not be able to modify 
edges or vertices without reentering In-Place Massing mode.

USING FREE-FORM BUILDING MASSING | 335
Figure 9.53 shows the ﬁnished mass in a perspective view. Both solids and voids can be used 
to complete a mass form. Whereas solids will add more geometry, voids will remove geometry 
from your mass.
To demonstrate this, return to In-Place Massing mode and create another face on the top of 
the existing form (Figure 9.54).

Starting Voids as Solids
If you create the void as a void, it will immediately cut the solid mass and become invisible. This can 
be annoying when you are trying to resolve your design and want to selectively cut after you have 
intuitively resolved a design idea. Fortunately, there is another way to create the form as a void.
Follow these steps:
1. Rather than creating a void, start by creating a solid of a different color to keep things 
clear during your design iteration. You can simply give the new solid a different material 
type to change the color.
2. Select the solid mass and convert it to a void by changing the Solid/Void property in the 
Properties palette, as shown in Figure 9.55. Be aware that unlike forms in the standard 
families, massing void forms cannot convert to solids and would need to be re-created.
Figure 9.56 shows the result of the void cutting the solid. Note how the form on the left side 
of the image has changed from Figure 9.53. Keep in mind that if you want to convert the void 
back to a solid, you will have to uncut any geometry that was being cut by the void. But the nice 
thing about this technique (converting solids to voids and then cutting) is that you have selec-
tively cut only the solids that you wanted to cut. Had you originally modeled the void as a void, 
you would have found that the void was cutting many solids, and you would have had to uncut 
solids that were not even overlapping with the void!
Overall, creating solid masses intuitively is a great way to establish, analyze, and visualize 
your overall design idea. As you saw previously in the chapter, mass ﬂoors allow you to even 
quantify gross ﬂoor areas before you have committed to geometry.
Furthermore, it is possible to put different intuitive massing ideas inside different design 
options (covered in Chapter 11, “Working with Phasing, Groups, and Design Options”) so that 
many ideas can live in a single Revit project ﬁle. Simply initiate worksharing and create work-
sets for each study mass. Multiple team members will be able to see one another’s work at the 
same time and in context with their design ideas. This is the holistic kind of team approach to 
design information that makes massing a unique and valuable design tool. If you would like to 
investigate this ﬁle further, you can download the ﬁle c09-Massing-2-Finished.rvt from the 
Chapter 9 folder of the book’s web page.
Next, you will investigate parametric and formulaic solid mass creation in the Family Editor.

338 | CHAPTER 9 ADVANCED MODELING AND MASSING
Creating Formula-Driven Massing
Formula-driven massing can be done in the project environment, but the challenge is that you 
have to work in the context of the project, and all the parameters, formulas, reference planes, and 
lines can start to get in the way. Therefore, having the option of creating form-driven masses in 
the Family Editor without the clutter of the project environment can help you focus on what you 
are trying to accomplish.
In this section of the chapter, we will show you two different methods for creating formula-
driven massing. First, you will create a generic model family and then load it into the project 
environment as part of an in-place mass. Second, you will create a conceptual mass family to 
observe the differences in modeling tools and how they will affect your design explorations.
Creating a Generic Model Mass Family
Although it is possible to create complex forms as a generic model in the Family Editor, they 
do not behave as masses when you place them in the project. You can assign standard walls, 
curtain walls, and roofs to the faces, but you cannot add patterns, create mass ﬂoors, or even 
schedule the results as a mass. The tools you will use in this exercise are the tools available for 
building most other 3D content using extrusions, sweeps, and blends. It is good to understand 
how to use these tools so you are familiar with all the types of modeling in Revit software.
1. Open a Generic Model template by clicking the Application button and choosing New ➢ 
Family. Select either Generic Model.rft or Metric Generic Model.rft from the list of 
default templates.
In some cases, you can change the category of a family by clicking the Family Category 
And Parameters button in the ribbon; however, you cannot convert a generic model 
 family to a mass (Figure 9.57). You will need to maintain the family as a generic model 
and then place it into an in-place mass within a project.

Message box explaining 
that you cannot change 
the category to Mass

2. Go to a ﬂoor plan reference-level view in your family. From the Create tab in the ribbon, 
click the Reference Line tool (not Reference Plane). Draw a reference line along the y-axis 
(up), as shown in Figure 9.58. Note that the reference line is drawn from the intersection 
of the reference planes. Note also that we have increased the line weight of Reference 
Lines in the Object Styles settings for clarity.
Figure 9.58 
First reference line
3. Draw another reference line in a downward direction along the y-axis (Figure 9.59). These 
reference lines will control the angular “twist” in your ﬁnished family.
Figure 9.59 
Second reference line

340 | CHAPTER 9 ADVANCED MODELING AND MASSING
Now you are going to create a blend that will be associated with the reference lines you 
just created. The bottom of the blend will be associated with the ﬁrst reference line, and 
the top of the blend will be associated with the second reference line.
4. From the Create tab in the ribbon, click the Blend tool. By default, you will start by deﬁn-
ing the bottom proﬁle of the blend. Click the Set command in the Work Plane panel of the 
contextual tab in the ribbon. Choose the Pick A Plane option (Figure 9.60), click OK, and 
then click the ﬁrst reference line you drew.
Figure 9.60 
Setting the work plane
5. From the Draw panel in the contextual tab of the ribbon, choose the Rectangle command 
and sketch a 10′ × 10′ (3 m × 3 m) square in the plan view.
6. Switch to the Annotate tab in the ribbon and click the Aligned dimension tool. Place a 
dimension on both vertical lines in the square sketch and the vertical reference line—not 
the reference plane. Click an empty area of the plan view to ﬁnish the dimension com-
mand. Highlight the ﬁnished dimension and click the EQ icon on the dimension string. 
The plan view should look like the image in Figure 9.61.
7. Use the Aligned dimension tool again to create dimensions for the vertical and horizontal 
sketch lines. This time, you will want to select the end of the reference line at the intersec-
tion as your center dimension. The goal is to make the box equal on all sides and equi-
distant from the reference planes (Figure 9.62). After you place the two dimensions, select 
them, and from the Options bar go to the Label Dimension panel and choose the Create 
Parameter button. In the Parameter Properties dialog box, set the following values:
 
◆
Name: BW
 
◆
Type or Instance: Instance
 
◆
Edit Tooltip: Bottom width of blend
The plan view should now look similar to the image in Figure 9.62. You can adjust the 
value of the BW parameter by clicking the Family Types icon from the Properties panel in 
the ribbon.

CREATING FORMULA-DRIVEN MASSING | 341
8. From the contextual tab in the ribbon, choose Edit Top. Click the Set command in the 
Work Plane panel, choose the Pick A Plane option, click OK, and then click the second 
(downward) reference line you drew in step 3.
9. Repeat steps 5 and 6 for the top sketch. Equally distribute the overall dimensions in rela-
tion to the downward reference line and create the parameters as you did previously, but 
name the parameter TW (top width), as shown in Figure 9.63.

10. In the Properties palette, locate the property named Second End. Click the small button at 
the right end of the row, which is the Associate Family Parameter button. Click the Add 
Parameter button. In the Parameter Properties dialog box, set the following values:
 
◆
Name: H
 
◆
Type or Instance: Instance
 
◆
Edit Tooltip: Height of blend
11. Click OK to create the parameter and close the open dialog boxes. Now click Finish 
Family (the green check mark) from the contextual tab in the ribbon to complete the 
blended form.
12. You should take a moment to test that the reference lines control the top and bottom 
sketches of the blend. Finish the sketch and activate the default 3D view. Change the view 
to a wireframe, select the reference line to highlight it, and then move the end of the ref-
erence line. Be careful when moving the reference line. The goal is to test the parameters, 
so when you move the line, do so by dragging the line slightly. You will see the resulting 
forms change. Do not use the Move command, as it will break the parameters. The other 
end remains associated with the intersection of the default reference planes, and the top 
and bottom sketches rotate, as shown in Figure 9.64.
13. From a plan view, move the reference lines so that they’re no longer on top of the refer-
ence planes. From the Annotate tab, click the Angular dimension tool and place dimen-
sions between each reference line and the vertical reference plane.
Figure 9.63 
Top width parameters 
and sketch

CREATING FORMULA-DRIVEN MASSING | 343
14. Select the upper angular dimension, and from the Label drop-down list in the Label 
Dimension panel click the Create Parameter button. Create a new family parameter with 
the following values:
 
◆
Name: BA
 
◆
Type or Instance: Instance
 
◆
Edit Tooltip: Bottom angle, counterclockwise from 90
Furthermore, you can add parameters to control the top and bottom angles of the blend. 
We have called these instance parameters BA and TA (for bottom angle and top angle, 
respectively).
15. Select the lower angular dimension and again click the Create Parameter button in the 
Label Dimension panel. Create another new parameter with the following values:
 
◆
Name: TA
 
◆
Type or Instance: Instance
 
◆
Edit Tooltip: Top angle, clockwise from 270
Figure 9.65 also shows all the parameters that control this blend. Switching to 3D view, 
from the Create tab in the ribbon, click the Family Types icon. Go ahead and test the 
parameter values by changing angles in the Properties palette and clicking the Apply 
button (or moving your mouse out of the palette). The form should rotate and twist. This 
is how you will interact with the form after you load it into a project environment.

with reference lines

344 | CHAPTER 9 ADVANCED MODELING AND MASSING
16. You are going to use the edges of this blend to drive the geometry that you are going 
to create, but since you do not want to see this blend, turn it into a void. With the blend 
selected, use the Solid/Void drop-down list in the Properties palette (Figure 9.66). The 
blend form will change color to a yellow-orange if you set your visual style of the view to 
Shaded. As an alternative to the void blend, you can toggle the Visible parameter in the 
solid version properties.
Figure 9.65 
Test the dimensional 
parameters before 
continuing.

into a void
17. From the Create tab in the ribbon, click the Sweep tool. Select Pick Path (not Sketch Path) 
in the contextual tab of the ribbon to select the edges of the blend previously created. Pick 
the edges of the blend, as shown in Figure 9.67. Note the location of the sketch plane along 
the lower rear edge. This is because it is the ﬁrst edge selected.

CREATING FORMULA-DRIVEN MASSING | 345
18. Once you select the edges of the blend, click the green check mark to ﬁnish the path. 
Click the Select Proﬁle icon and select Edit Proﬁle from the contextual tab in the ribbon. 
Doing so allows you to sketch the proﬁle in direct context of the selected edges.
19. Sketch a rectangular proﬁle 5′-6″ (1.7 m) wide × 4′-6″ (1.4 m) high. After you sketch the 
proﬁle, add an aligned dimension and then add parameters to the proﬁle width and 
height as you have done previously in this exercise. We have called the instance param-
eters PW (proﬁle width) and PH (proﬁle height), respectively (Figure 9.68).

346 | CHAPTER 9 ADVANCED MODELING AND MASSING
20. Finish the sketch and the sweep, and the proﬁle will generate as shown in Figure 9.69. Be 
aware that larger proﬁle dimensions may make the sketch fail. If this occurs, try to sup-
ply shorter dimensions to the proﬁles. As with any dimensional parameter, testing varia-
tions for validity in the Family Editor may save you from frustration in your project ﬁle.
Save the family on your computer as Generic Model Mass.rfa. With the form created, it is 
now possible to load this family into your project environment and place it within an in-place 
mass. To do this, follow these steps:
1. Open a new project using the default Architecture template, and begin by creating an 
in-place mass from the Conceptual Mass panel of the Massing & Site tab. Name the mass 
Generic Mass.
2. While still in the In-Place Mass Sketch mode, toggle back to the mass family you just  
created and click Load Into Project from the ribbon. You should immediately be ready to 
place an instance of the loaded family, but if not, switch to the Create tab in the ribbon 
and click Component. Place the generic family as a component into your in-place mass.
3. Select the component you just inserted, and notice in the Properties palette that all the 
attributes you gave to the mass are available for you to edit. Using these parameters, set 
the values as follows:
 
◆
BW: 160′ (49 m)
 
◆
TW: 140′ (43 m)
Figure 9.69 
Te ﬁnished sweep

CREATING FORMULA-DRIVEN MASSING | 347
 
◆
H: 160′ (49 m)
 
◆
PW: 40′ (12 m)
 
◆
PH: 65′ (20 m)
 
◆
BA: 22°
 
◆
TA: 22°
4. Now ﬁnish the in-place mass by clicking the green check mark, which is the Finish Mass 
button. Even though this is a generic model family, because you have placed it during 
In-Place Mass mode, the software treats it as a mass.
5. Activate the South elevation view and add 15 additional levels. Space the levels every 10′ 
(3 m) apart, as shown in Figure 9.70, so that there are levels that extend across the entire 
elevation of your massing.
Figure 9.70 
Adding levels that 
extend across the ele-
vation of your massing
6. Select the mass and click the Mass Floors button on the contextual tab in the ribbon. 
Select and check the boxes for all the levels and then click OK to apply the changes and 
close the dialog box.
7. Select the mass, and on the contextual tab in the ribbon click Edit In-Place. Hover over 
one of the surfaces on the generic model, press the Tab key until the status bar indicates 
a face, and then click to select it. In the contextual tab of the ribbon, click Divide Surface. 
With the face still selected, go to the Type Selector and choose Triangle (Flat). You will 
also be able to associate patterns and pattern-based components with your generic mass-
ing family (Figure 9.71). Continue to do this for each vertical surface on the generic model 
and then click Finish Mass.

348 | CHAPTER 9 ADVANCED MODELING AND MASSING
8. Finally, switch to the Architecture tab in the ribbon and click Roof ➢ Roof By Face. Click the 
horizontal surfaces of the mass and then click Create Roof in the contextual tab of the rib-
bon. Click the Modify button to complete the command. Figure 9.72 shows four perspective 
views of the completed massing study, all created with the familiar geometry toolset.

We’ve also rendered the model, as shown in Figure 9.73. The results are quite interesting, and 
you will still have the ability to modify the underlying parametric family and then rehost the 
faces. You will also be able to schedule the volume, surface, and ﬂoor area of the mass.

generic massing project
You can download and further investigate the ﬁles that were used to create this exercise in the 
Chapter 9 folder of the book’s web page. Download the project ﬁle c09_Parametric_Generic_
Massing_Finish.rvt, which contains the in-place massing and the loaded generic element.
Now let’s begin to investigate how to create parametric massing in the Family Editor using 
the conventional massing tools.
Design by Visual Programming
Using visual programming tools to generate complex forms is a popular practice in design method-
ology. We are not talking about parametric design as an aesthetic philosophy, but rather the tools 
employed to achieve the results. Te term visual programming refers to the use of a graphic UI to 
drive code-based scripting that will generate complex geometrical forms. One tool that uses this 
creation method bundled with Revit is called Dynamo. Chapter 10, “Conceptual Design,” walks you 
through the process. Te website http://dynamobim.org has learning material, free downloads, 
and a discussion forum.
Creating a Complex Mass Family
In the previous exercise, we used the basic modeling tools that are available for most family cat-
egories. The tools available in the conceptual massing environment are somewhat different. In 
the next exercise, you will open a conceptual mass family that we have started with a number of 
datum objects and embedded formulas.

350 | CHAPTER 9 ADVANCED MODELING AND MASSING
Overall, the UI is not too dissimilar from the project environment. It is as if you are creat-
ing masses in-place, except that you are not in the project environment; you are in the Family 
Editor. One signiﬁcant difference that you can see is that there is a single level and two reference 
planes, which also deﬁne the origin for a massing family (Figure 9.74). Keep in mind that when 
you reload this family into your project, it will update relative to the origin in the family.
Figure 9.74 
Te Massing user 
interface
The ability to parametrically control objects in the massing editor was done using reference 
planes and reference lines. These references add another level of control to model elements. 
Point elements allow for Cartesian X, Y, Z, as well as rotational control.
With all complex and parametrically controlled families, we think it is best to understand 
complex families to get the basic rules down ﬁrst. In this case, the rules are the parameters and 
formulas that will control a twisting, tapering tower.
To begin this exercise, download and open the ﬁle c09-Formula-Massing-Start.rfa or 
c09-Formula-Massing-Start-Metric.rfa from the book’s web page. Open the Family Types 
dialog box and observe the parameters and formulas that are included with the exercise ﬁle, as 
shown in Figure 9.75.
We will brieﬂy describe how this conceptual mass family was created so you can get an over-
view of the process and employ similar techniques on your own designs. Similar to the steps 
you performed in the previous exercise, reference lines were used to generate a square sketch at 
the ﬁrst reference level.
The reference lines were dimensioned with equality constraints based on the reference 
planes deﬁning the origin. Overall dimensions were placed and associated with the W0 param-
eter (Figure 9.76). W0 is shorthand for the width dimension on the 0-level.

352 | CHAPTER 9 ADVANCED MODELING AND MASSING
When you select a reference point, you have the option to associate any of the point’s 
properties with any of the family parameters developed for this conceptual mass. This is 
done by clicking the small button in the Properties palette next to each property value. 
For each reference point in this exercise ﬁle, the Offset property was associated with a cor-
responding L-parameter (Figure 9.78). The L-parameters refer to the level number of each 
of your point elements. The ﬁrst point element is associated with the parameter named L1 
because it is reference Level 1. The second point is associated with L2, and so on. When you 
associate a property with a family parameter, you will notice that the button ﬁlls with a 
small equal sign.
Figure 9.77 
Moving the point 
element
Figure 9.78 
Adding a parameter to 
the point element
Activating the South Elevation, you can see seven reference points were placed at the  
intersection of the default reference planes. Each reference point was then elevated manually 
by dragging the up arrow to move it away from the other overlapping point elements  
(Figure 9.77).

CREATING FORMULA-DRIVEN MASSING | 353
By default, the reference point elements are just spherical nodes. Their reference planes are 
not visible. To make them a little more usable for your modeling purposes, you can set them to 
display their internal reference planes. With a reference point selected, in the Properties palette 
you will ﬁnd a property called Show Reference Planes; set it to Always, and the reference planes 
of the point elements will be visible (Figure 9.79).
Next, the Rotation Angle property of each reference point was associated with the corre-
sponding family parameter. Point 1 was associated with A1 (angle 1), Point 2 with A2, and so on.
We then used the Set command in the Work Plane panel to use each point’s horizontal plane 
as the working reference to draw a square sketch of reference lines associated with each point. 
Each sketch was dimensioned in a similar way to the ﬁrst sketch. The dimensions for the sketch 
associated with Point 1 are W1, the Point 2 sketch dimensions are W2, and so on. Switching to 
the 3D with Dimensions view, you can see this (Figure 9.80).
For clarity, we have hidden the dimensions in the default 3D view so that you can see all the 
reference lines and point elements. If you would like to see all the dimensions conﬁgured in this 
exercise ﬁle, activate the 3D view named 3D with Dimensions.
Now let’s begin to create some mass forms using the parametrically driven framework of  
reference lines in this exercise ﬁle. Follow these steps to get started:
1. While pressing the Ctrl key, select all the square reference line sketches, and then click 
Create Form ➢ Solid Form on the Form panel in the ribbon. Although this will look like a 
simple extrusion, it is actually a blend with many proﬁles.
2. Open the Family Types dialog box and begin to test the results before loading the family 
into the project (Figure 9.81). Set the WCPL and APL parameters to 0 and click Apply.
Figure 9.79 
Selecting Always  
next to Show  
Reference Planes

354 | CHAPTER 9 ADVANCED MODELING AND MASSING
3. Test the parameter that controls the distance between levels by increasing the HPL 
instance parameter (which stands for height per level). If you hover the mouse pointer 
over these parameters, a tooltip will appear telling you what they mean.
4. Now test the ability of the shape to taper (Figure 9.82). Do so by increasing the WCPL 
instance parameter (which stands for width control per level).
5. Next, test the parameters that control the amount of angular twist per level (Figure 9.83). 
Do so by increasing the APL parameter (which stands for angle per level).

6. Start a new project using the default Architectural template. Switch back to the mass  
family, and click Load Into Project from the ribbon. Place an instance of the conceptual 
mass family in the project environment. When you select the massing family, you will be 
given access to all of its parameters in the Properties dialog box. You can quickly and  
easily test the massing parameters to signiﬁcantly increase the height, width, taper, and 
incremental rotation of the massing family.
7. Switch back to the family ﬁle. Select the mass and click Divide Surface in the contextual 
tab of the ribbon. From the Type Selector, choose Rhomboid to apply the pattern, as 
shown in Figure 9.84. You will notice in the Properties palette that you can change the 
properties of the Rhomboid pattern to adjust the pattern to meet your design needs.

356 | CHAPTER 9 ADVANCED MODELING AND MASSING
8. Click Load Into Project to reload the mass into the project. Activate the South elevation 
view and set the elevation of the Level 2 datum element to 30′ (9 m). Select Level 2 and 
click the Array tool in the Modify tab of the ribbon. In the Options bar, uncheck Group 
and Associate, set Number to 60, and choose the Move To 2nd option. In the elevation, 
click once, move the mouse pointer upward, and then type 15′ (4.5 m). This will create 
a quick conﬁguration of levels for your tower design. Note that no plans will be created 
when you copy or array levels.
9. Select the mass form and click Mass Floors in the contextual tab of the ribbon. Using the 
Shift key, multiselect and check all the levels in the project. Click OK to apply the changes 
and close the dialog box. In Figure 9.85, we applied a section box to the 3D view to illus-
trate the mass ﬂoors.
If you want to learn more about expanding the use of the divided surfaces on massing forms, 
see Chapter 13, “Creating Walls and Curtain Walls.” In that chapter, we discuss the modeling 
techniques to create custom panel families and how to apply them to pattern-based curtain 
walls.
Creating interesting and complex massing studies that can be parametrically controlled is 
not just a skill developed over time. The rules you develop to make and reiterate your designs 
are also carefully considered aesthetic choices to make decisions rather than blobs! To see this 
ﬁle, go to the Chapter 9 folder and download c09-Formula-Massing-Project_Finished.rvt. 
Be sure to turn on Show Mass Form And Floors on the Massing & Site tab if it is not turned on 
when you open the ﬁle.

THE BOTTOM LINE | 357
Te Bottom Line
Create and schedule massing studies.  Starting the design process with actual building 
elements can lead to a lot of unexpected frustration. Walls lead to rooms, which get room 
tags and are eventually scheduled. If you have failed to fulﬁll the client’s program, you will 
wonder where to start over!
Master It  You are faced with creating some design studies of a large hospital  complex. 
How would you go about creating a Revit project that would allow you to create a 
 massing study and schedule it against the design client’s program?
Know when to use solid and surface masses.  Solid masses and surface masses can both be 
used to maintain relationships to host geometry such as walls and roofs, but surface masses 
cannot be volumetrically scheduled or contain ﬂoor area faces.
Master It  You have been asked to create a complex canopy system for the entry to a 
 hotel project. The system will consist of a complex wave of triangular panels. What kind 
of mass would you create?
Use mathematical formulas for massing.  Not all massing is going to involve intuitive, in-
the-moment decision-making. By discovering the underlying rules that express a form, you 
can create the formulas that can iterate and manipulate your massing study. So, rather than 
manually manipulating the mass, you manipulate the formulas related to your mass.
Master It  What is the best way to discover and create these formulas?

 Chapter  10   
 Conceptual Design   
 For a typical Revit user, the term  computational design can evoke visions of obscure tools used 
for advanced form-making. This preconceived notion has proven difﬁ cult to curtail, even as 
parametric modeling and design computation become more commonplace. New tools provid-
ing parametric design environments enable users to not only create unique geometry but also 
develop automated processes and sophisticated data manipulation techniques. 
 Autodesk tools have taken two approaches—one that is data-centric and the other that is 
geometry-centric. This provides more ﬂ exibility and expediency to the design process. With 
these tools, users can create algorithms and manipulate data graphically, rather than textually. 
They can also drive geometry exploration with simple visually based manipulation. 
 In this chapter, you’ll learn to

 Getting Started with Dynamo 
 Dynamo is a visual programming interface plug-in for Revit. It is also available as a stand-
alone application known as Dynamo Studio. With Dynamo for Revit, users can create custom 
design and automation methods with node-based diagrams that instantly affect both project 
and family ﬁ les. Geometry and data generated with Dynamo become ﬂ exible; minor tweaks to a 
Dynamo deﬁ nition ﬁ le can deliver major results. Figure  10.1 shows an example. 
 Downloading Dynamo 
 Dynamo is an open source application. You can download the ofﬁ cial released version 
of Dynamo from  www.dynamobim.com . Figure  10.2 shows the Dynamo BIM home page. On 
the home page, browse to the dedicated download page and choose the latest version. 
 Installing Dynamo 
 Once Dynamo is downloaded, running the executable ﬁ le will complete the installation if you’re 
planning to use the stand-alone version (Figure  10.3 ). Make sure Revit and any other applica-
tions are closed. During the installation you can customize the installed components, including 
what versions of Revit you want to add Dynamo to (if you want to install this for earlier versions 
of Revit). (In Revit, Dynamo is installed automatically with Revit.) Make sure Dynamo Training 
Files is selected, as these are an invaluable learning resource.

GETTING STARTED WITH DYNAMO | 361
Opening Dynamo
Once Dynamo is installed, open Revit to use the application. Dynamo will be available in 
the Manage tab of the ribbon. You might notice that Dynamo is grayed out initially. To open 
Dynamo, you must have a Revit project ﬁle or family ﬁle (typically a conceptual mass) open 
to connect to Dynamo. Dynamo will run only in the ﬁle in which it was opened. If you have 
multiple ﬁles open within Revit, make sure the ﬁle you want to connect to Dynamo is the active 
window before clicking the Dynamo button.
Click the Dynamo button to start the application. It will open in a new window (Figure 10.4). 
To create a new Dynamo ﬁle, with the extension .dyn, click the New icon on the start page. A 
Dynamo ﬁle is referred to as a deﬁnition and can be thought of as a dynamic diagram that  
performs a function or process.
Figure 10.4 
Dynamo start page
Understanding the Dynamo UI
Although connected to a Revit ﬁle, Dynamo has its own user interface and window sepa-
rate from the Revit window. Dynamo’s user interface is divided into four areas, as shown in 
Figure 10.5.

A: Toolbar  Like most Windows-style software, the toolbar contains the basic application 
functionality for managing ﬁles, selections, and settings. It includes drop-down menus as 
well as icons for quick access. Hovering over an icon will display its functionality and hotkey 
in a contextual box.
B: Node Library  The Node Library is a categorized repository for all available nodes. Nodes 
are objects within Dynamo that connect to form a routine or program and are connected 
with elements called wires. Wires are what visually demonstrate the ﬂow of data between 
nodes. We’ll go into the parts of a node a bit later in this chapter.
The nodes are organized hierarchically within nested libraries based on how nodes relate to 
one another. You can browse the Node Library by clicking the menus and submenus until 
you reveal a set of nodes and their descriptions. As an example, point-related nodes can be 
found in the Geometry menu and then the Point submenu (throughout this chapter we will 
use the convention Geometry ➢ Point to describe where to locate a speciﬁc node). Within the 
submenu, nodes are further categorized by color: green is Create, red is Action, and blue is 
Query. Hovering over a particular node will reveal a contextual box with the node descrip-
tion, including necessary inputs for the node and what it will output when used properly. 
The search bar at the top of the Node Library palette can be used in lieu of browsing the 
library’s hierarchy to search for a speciﬁc node by name. Finally, clicking a node will place 
the node into the Graph View of the workspace.
C: Workspace  The workspace is where you interact with nodes and relationships while 
developing your Dynamo deﬁnition. The workspace is an area where two views are overlaid: 
the Graph View and a 3D Preview. The Graph View is the display of your Dynamo deﬁnition 

GETTING STARTED WITH DYNAMO | 363
showing the mapping of the nodes and formulas; the 3D Preview view is the display beyond 
the Graph View (in the background) and shows any geometry being created by your Dynamo 
deﬁnition. Both are rendered simultaneously.
As you create a Dynamo deﬁnition that includes geometry nodes, you will see a preview of 
the results, or an instantiation, not only within the workspace but also within the project or 
family environment. The preview geometry cannot be selected and should be thought of as a 
by-product of what you are creating in your deﬁnition. It is shown as a visual reference only.
It is important to note that your mouse will behave differently depending on whether the 
Graph View or 3D Preview view is activated. Refer to Table 10.1 for mouse controls in each of 
these views.

Toggling between the two views to control the extent and orientation of each view is possible  
by selecting the Toggle Preview icons at the top-right corner of the workspace, as shown in 
Figure 10.6 (A). Any geometry that is displayed in the 3D Preview is visible only within the work-
space. Unless you have created a deﬁnition that converts Dynamo geometry into model geometry 
using particular Revit element nodes, you will be unable to see any geometry visible in the Revit 
project or family ﬁle you have connected to this Dynamo session. We suggest playing with the 
two different view types and the mouse controls. While it might not sound intuitive when read-
ing the workﬂow, it functions fairly simply when you are in the Dynamo environment.

Also shown in Figure 10.6 are additional navigation tools. Dynamo deﬁnitions can become 
rather large, and at times you will want to zoom in or zoom out to work in greater detail or to 
see the overall workﬂow. From top to bottom in Figure 10.6 (B), these tools will allow you to 
zoom to ﬁt, zoom in, zoom out, and pan within the view.

364 | CHAPTER 10 CONCEPTUAL DESIGN 
D: Execution Bar  The Execution Bar is where you run the Dynamo deﬁnition or perform 
the process that you have laid out in the view. A new deﬁnition defaults to Automatic as a 
run style. This means the deﬁnition is running automatically and updates immediately when 
it is modiﬁed. Automatic execution is appropriate for smaller and leaner Dynamo deﬁnitions. 
However, it can create performance issues when you are modifying larger deﬁnitions where 
small changes can take considerable time to update. If you notice a lag in performance or 
are working with large deﬁnitions, switch to Manual where the deﬁnition is processed only 
when the user chooses.
Connecting Nodes Makes Data Flow
Now that you have looked at the user interface, let’s take an in-depth look at a node’s structure 
and state and how you can create a visual program when connecting nodes with wires.
Node Structure
Dynamo nodes are the building blocks of a visual program. The ﬂow of data within a node (and 
ultimately through the entire Dynamo deﬁnition) enters through the left and exits out the right 
side via ports. Nodes can store, analyze, and process both data and geometry; they can even 
report and access information that exists outside of the Dynamo environment. A node is broken 
down into ﬁve key parts, as shown in Figure 10.7.
Figure 10.7 
Te anatomy of a 
Dynamo node
A
C
E
D
B
A node consists of the following:
A: Node Name  This is the common name of the node. The system of naming is Category 
.NodeName. For example, you can deﬁne a point in space with Point.ByCoordinates. 
Throughout the chapter this convention will be used to deﬁne nodes.
B: Input Ports  These are receiving locations for data from another node. You can hover over 
a port to see a contextual pop-up containing the type of data required. Some nodes do not 
have input ports, meaning that their primary function is either to act as an input for other 
nodes (for example, the Integer node) or to access and report information from the Revit ﬁle 
you have tethered to the Dynamo ﬁle (for example, the Wall Type node).
C: Output Ports  These are transmitting locations to send data from the current node to the 
input port of another. Whatever the function of the node might be (whether you are creating 
a point or calculating the volume of a solid mass), you can supply the results further along 
the Dynamo deﬁnition. Some nodes do not have output ports, meaning that their primary 
function is to either display information from a preceding connected node (Watch) or per-
form a transaction (Excel.WriteToFile).

CONNECTING NODES MAKES DATA FLOW | 365
D: Node Preview  This tool allows you to preview the resultant data from the node. You can 
hover over the icon to see a contextual pop-up of the data or click the icon to open and close a 
preview pane.
E: Lacing Option  This tool illustrates the lacing option applied to the resultant data (more 
on lacing options later) and is relevant only when your node contains a list of data, which it 
often does.
Using Nodes
You can place a node into the workspace by browsing through the Node Library categories and 
clicking one of the node options available. The node will appear in the center of your workspace 
when selected. A node can be moved by simply selecting and dragging it to a new location.
Search Bar
Once you get a handle on the naming conventions of the Node Library, another method for 
node selection and workspace placement is to use the search bar available at the top of the Node 
Library palette. When nothing is selected in the Dynamo environment, the search bar is auto-
matically active; simply typing at any point will begin a dynamic search. As you type, the Node 
Library will limit the available nodes based on what is being typed. Dynamo will try to predict the 
node you are searching for and highlight a node as you continue typing. If the highlighted node is 
the desired node, pressing Enter on your keyboard allows you to place it, as shown in Figure 10.8. 
Pressing Esc will clear the text in the search bar and restore all available nodes. If you are having 
trouble with the search bar being automatically active, press Esc prior to typing a search query.

Connecting Nodes with Wires
Nodes are linked together using wires, a graphical representation denoting the ﬂow of data 
within the Dynamo deﬁnition. To connect two nodes, left-click the output of one node (the right 
side of the node), then move the mouse to the inputs of another node (on the left side) until the 

366 | CHAPTER 10 CONCEPTUAL DESIGN 
Node States
As shown in Figure 10.10, a node can have various visual states depending on how it is con-
nected to other nodes, whether the user is interacting with it, and whether the deﬁnition is valid. 
Here are some examples of node coloration:
A: Active  The node’s header is dark gray with all inputs connected and (when running 
automatically) the type of data is correct.
B: Idle  The node’s header is gray and disconnected from other nodes.
C: Warning  The node is yellow; it is in an error state because of the type of data being fed 
to it or the structure of the data it is attempting to interpret.
D: Selected  The node has a blue stroke around the perimeter. Any connected wires will 
also highlight as blue.

intended input port highlights, and left-click again to complete the connection. A connected 
node will look like Figure 10.9. To disconnect, left-click the output port of your node and then 
again in an empty area in the workspace.

USING VISUAL PROGRAMMING | 367
Organizing a Deﬁnition
As you develop a Dynamo deﬁnition, it can start to look a lot like spaghetti if you are not care-
ful. Organization and legibility are important, regardless of whether you are a beginner or 
advanced user. There are many reasons why you would want to stay organized.
 
◆
You are sharing your deﬁnition with your colleagues.
 
◆
Your deﬁnition is large or complex.
 
◆
You are working on your deﬁnition intermittently and might not remember your line of 
thinking between opportunities to work on it.
 
◆
You have realized you have made an error and need to go back through your deﬁnition and 
troubleshoot.
Fortunately, Dynamo includes some tools to help you with organizing your deﬁnition.
Notes  Notes are editable text ﬁelds you can add to your Dynamo deﬁnition, allowing you 
to add descriptions and characterize areas of your deﬁnition in plain language. To add a note 
to the workspace, select Edit in the toolbar and choose Create Note (or use Ctrl+W). You can 
move the note around with your mouse similar to how you do with a node. Double-clicking 
the note opens an Edit Text window.
Selection Alignment  Making your deﬁnition look neat and tidy by manually moving 
nodes with your mouse can be difﬁcult, if not impossible. To align a set of nodes, drag-select 
them and right-click. In the context menu, choose Align Selection. There are a variety of 
alignments available including average and distribution options.
Grouping  Grouping is an effective way to organize your deﬁnition, allowing you to high-
light selections of nodes with color and annotate with text. To group a set of nodes, drag-
select them and right-click. In the context menu, select Create Group. A green rectangle will 
appear around your selected nodes. You can drag the group with your mouse similar to how 
you move a node and edit the group annotation by double-clicking the group. To change the 
group color or ungroup the selection, right-click the group and select the appropriate option.
Using Visual Programming
With that background, let’s start programming! Once you have an understanding of the user 
interface and node structure, it is time to delve into visual programming by creating small 
snippets of Dynamo deﬁnitions. As you read through the exercises, use Dynamo to re-create 
the images shown in this section. Each aspect covered includes relevant material, advice, and 
where/how to ﬁnd depicted nodes. You can also use the automatic search function within 
Dynamo to quickly ﬁnd a node if you are familiar with the node name (in other words, the 
header text at the top of each node).
Before beginning, we have to delve into the two types of nodes you are going to use: input 
nodes and watch nodes.
Input Nodes  Input nodes are how a user can deﬁne values or parameters within a deﬁni-
tion. There are a variety of different types of inputs.
Number and Integer  These nodes allow you to manually input a numeric value.
String  A string is another word for a series of characters or text. An example of a string 
could be “Room Name” or “Fire Rating.”

368 | CHAPTER 10 CONCEPTUAL DESIGN 
Number Slider and Integer Slider  These nodes are similar to Number and Integer but 
give you dynamic control of the output with a slider. By clicking the down arrow at the 
left of the node, you can reveal the default values controlling the slider granularity.
File and Directory Path  These nodes allow users to access and utilize ﬁles or directo-
ries available on the workstation.
Watch Nodes  Watch nodes are preview nodes. They serve a similar function to clicking the 
Node Preview button, but they create a continuous reveal that is useful for troubleshooting 
and data management. There are two types of watch nodes.
Watch  This node creates the standard data list preview.
Watch3D  This node creates geometric results, acting like a small workspace view. It 
might seem redundant at ﬁrst glance, but if you are creating a deﬁnition with multiple 
geometric solutions, the overlap within the workspace can be illegible and cumbersome. 
You can hide a geometry’s preview in the workspace by right-clicking the node and se-
lecting Preview.
In Figure 10.11, watch nodes surface solutions from data that has been both created and 
derived from manual inputs.
Figure 10.11 
Input nodes and 
watch nodes
With an understanding of the node types, you’re ready to begin creating a Dynamo deﬁni-
tion. This deﬁnition is going to start with a simple shape. Shapes can be points, curves, and sur-
faces. Let’s explore each type.
Points  Point nodes can be found by browsing Geometry ➢ Point in the Node Library. In 
Figure 10.12, two points are created using the Point.ByCoordinates(x,y,z) node. The coordi-
nates for the ﬁrst point are deﬁned by Number nodes, while the second point is deﬁned by an 
Integer Slider node. Both points require user input for their coordinate values. Note the point 
in the lower right of Figure 10.12.

USING VISUAL PROGRAMMING | 369
To create a point, simply drop in the following nodes:
 
◆
Number (you’ll need two instances of this)
 
◆
Integer Slider
 
◆
Point.byCoordinates node
Once the nodes are placed, connect them, mimicking Figure 10.12. With the Execution Bar set 
to Automatic, modify the Number node values, and slide the arrow on the Integer Slider node. 
You should see the location of the points update in the 3D Preview beneath the Graph View.
Curves  By browsing for geometry in the Node Library, you can ﬁnd a number of categories 
corresponding to types of curves such as Line, Curve, and NURBS Curve. In Figure 10.13, a 
Line.ByStartPointEndPoint node is used to create a curve with two point nodes as inputs. You 
can use this to create a curve attached to your point.

a point

ing point and

370 | CHAPTER 10 CONCEPTUAL DESIGN 
1. Start by detaching the Integer Slider node. You are going to use a similar tool, the 
Number Slider node (shown in Figure 10.14), in the following steps. This slider allows 
you a higher level of granularity but works effectively the same way as the Integer Slider 
node. After you detach the Integer Slider node, connect the Number Slider following the 
same layout (Figure 10.14).
Figure 10.14

by extruding  
a curve
2. Add another Point.ByCoordinates node and connect them as shown in Figure 10.13. Set 
your ﬁrst Number node to zero and connect it to the X and Z connections on the ﬁrst 
Point.ByCoordinates node and to the Y on the second Point.ByCoordinates node. Set the 
second Number node to 5 and connect it to the remaining Y and X and Z connections.
3. Add a Line.ByStartPointEndPoint node. Connect the Point connections from the  
Point.ByCoordinates nodes to the startPoint and endPoint connections of the new node.
4. Add a new NumberSlider node and a Curve.PointAtParameter node.
5. Connect the Line connection from the Line.ByStartPointEndPoint node to the Curve con-
nection in the Curve.PointAtParameter node. Finally, connect the NumberSlider output to 
the Param connection of the Curve.PointAtParameter node.
Now, by changing the values of the Number node or the slider, you can change the location 
of the point on the line or the line’s start and endpoints.
The Value of Computational Programming
Seems like a lot of work for a line, right? Remember, one of the beneﬁts of visual programming is 
the ability to rapidly change the output based on a string of values. As you become more practiced 

USING VISUAL PROGRAMMING | 371
Surfaces  Now that you have created a point and a curve, you can use what you have to 
create a surface. There are a number of surface categories to browse under the Geometry 
heading of the Node Library such as Surface, Sphere, and PolySurface. There are also surface 
nodes that are “hidden” within other categories.
To continue this exercise, you are going to use the Line.ByStartPointEndPoint node from the 
previous example (Figure 10.13). You will create an extruded surface using a Curve.Extrude 
node, which can be found by selecting Geometry ➢ Curve. Notice how the extrusion of the 
curve is controlled with the NumberSlider nodes in this example.
1. This example will get a bit more complex. Start by removing the NumberSlider and 
Curve.PointAtParameter nodes. You are going to connect a few additional nodes between 
your original content and the sliders.
2. Add Vector. YAxis, Number, and Curve.Extrude nodes (shown in the shaded box, top 
right, in Figure 10.14). With those nodes added, do the following:
a. Connect the output of Line.ByStartPointEndPoint to the Curve input of CurveExtrude.
b. Connect the Vector output of Vector.YAxis to the Direction input of CurveExtrude.
c. Connect the output of the Number node to the Distance input of CurveExtrude.
d. Give the Number node a value of 10.
with Dynamo, you can use deﬁnitions like this to feed geometry within families and rapidly change 
a building’s facade design or other aspects of the form.

372 | CHAPTER 10 CONCEPTUAL DESIGN 
3. Add two NumberSlider nodes and a Surface.PointAtParameter node, as shown in the blue 
area of Figure 10.14. With those nodes added, connect the following:
a. The output of ﬁrst NumberSlider to the U input of Surface.PointAtParameter
b. The output of the second NumberSlider to the V input of Surface.PointAtParameter
c. The output of the CurveExtrude node to the Surface input of Surface.PointAtParameter
Now, by changing the sliders, you can update the curve and the surface! As we’ve demon-
strated in this basic example, once your deﬁnition is created, it can be a simple matter to use the 
deﬁnition to manipulate forms. Next, you’ll look at some advanced elements in Dynamo.
Additional Dynamo Tools
Now that you have stepped through some basic examples of using Dynamo to create points, 
lines, and surfaces, you can learn how those tools can be leveraged for more complex shapes. 
In this section, you’ll explore some additional tools and see how they can be leveraged to create 
more robust Dynamo deﬁnitions. Because providing exercises to fully explain all the aspects of 
Dynamo could easily ﬁll an entire book, the following content will simply explain the concepts 
and refrain from more step-by-step examples.
Code Blocks
Code Blocks are nodes that you can use to deﬁne a snippet of DesignScript, a simple program-
ming language developed by Autodesk. DesignScript is a programming language available in 
many Autodesk tools such as AutoCAD that allows for more robust control of parametric con-
tent. You can create a Code Block by searching for it in the Node Library or just double-clicking 
an empty area in the workspace. The basic structure of DesignScript works by creating a line 
of code followed by a semicolon, as shown in Figure 10.15. Code Blocks can come in handy in a 
variety of ways. The following are two commonly used Code Block functions:
Creating Inputs  A Code Block can be used in lieu of inputs. Simply typing a numeric value fol-
lowed by a semicolon will create an output. Multiple outputs can be created using the same node.
Creating Expressions  Adding an expression with variables will reveal inputs. This mini-
mizes the need for additional nodes for mathematical equations that can make a deﬁnition 
bulky and difﬁcult to follow.

creating inputs  
and expressions

Managing Data
Situations will arise using Dynamo where you will create data ﬂows that are collections of 
items, and in some cases, they are associated with other collections. Any data ﬂow containing 
multiple items is known as a list (sometimes described as an array). List nodes can be found 
under Core ➢ List. Understanding the principles of data management in Dynamo is critical for 
successfully developing useful deﬁnitions. Take some time to peruse and experiment with all 
the various list nodes available. Each of the images accompanying the following topics can be 
used to practice the concept and replicate the Dynamo deﬁnition.
Simple Lists
A simple list is a line of items, as shown in Figure 10.16. A List.Sequence node has been used to 
create the list 1, 2, 3…. Let’s examine Figure 10.16 more closely. In the ﬁrst Watch node, you will 
notice that each item in the list has an index value in brackets signifying its location in the list. 
Index values are integers and begin with the value [0]. To select an item from a list, you have to 
use its index value. In the second half of the deﬁnition, items [0] and [3] have been singled out 
using List.GetItemAtIndex.
Figure 10.16 
Creating a simple list 
and retrieving items
Complex Lists
A complex list has more than one dimension, often referred to as a list of lists or a multidimen-
sional array. In Figure 10.17, a complex list is generated from a simple list using List.Chop. The 
result is a list of ﬁve sublists, each containing two values. Using List.GetItemAtIndex will single out 
an item of the highest order, as shown in the Watch node. It can then be used again to single  
out a particular value.

Figure 10.17

and retrieving items
Figure 10.18

turing complex lists
Structuring Lists
Certain nodes require list inputs. For example, the Curve.ByPoints node has one input port, 
curves. A simple list of points will produce a single curve. To create multiple curves, you must 
break up the list supplied into sublists. By organizing data correctly, a single node can have a 
robust output. In Figure 10.18, we use the List.Create and List.Transpose nodes to reorganize 
point data. Code Block nodes, in the blue ﬁeld, are used to reduce the size of the deﬁnition for 
clarity. You can also use Code Blocks to create lists. As you can see, 0..6..1; creates a list from 0 to 
6 with a step of 1.

Lacing
Lacing is another word for data matching, or the method in which a Dynamo node interprets and 
associates different sizes of inputs. There are three methods available, each one producing differ-
ent results. To modify the lacing method of a node, right-click the lacing icon on the lower-right 
corner of the node. In the cascading menu, hover over Lacing and make a selection. The follow-
ing lacing methods are illustrated using points and lines to establish their behavior:
Shortest  The default lacing option for Dynamo is Shortest, as shown in Figure 10.19. For 
each list, associate each corresponding list item until there are no more items in one list.
Longest  Figure 10.20 shows the Longest list lacing option. For each list, associate each cor-
responding list item, duplicating the last item in the shorter list until there are no more items 
in either list.
Cross Product  As shown in Figure 10.21, the Cross Product lacing option makes all pos-
sible connections. For each list, associate each list item with every other item in the corre-
sponding list.

376 | CHAPTER 10 CONCEPTUAL DESIGN 
Changing a lacing method (particularly to Cross Product) on a large deﬁnition can gener-
ate a massive increase in node solutions, leading to performance issues and the possibility of 
Dynamo freezing and not responding. It is good practice to save your ﬁle ﬁrst, disconnect any 
subsequent nodes before switching lacing methods, and then use a Watch node to best ensure 
the intended outcome.
Geometric Manipulation and Analysis
Beyond the creation of geometry, nodes can also manipulate existing geometry or perform anal-
ysis against an existing model. In this section, we’ll explore some of the node types that allow 
those functions.
Vectors
A vector is a quantity that has a direction and magnitude. The input of a vector is similar to 
that of a point (x,y,z), but the node calculates the relative difference between the origin, in 
this case (0,0,0), and the coordinate input. Vector-related nodes can be found by browsing 
Geometry ➢ Vector in the Node Library. In Figure 10.22, a Points.ByCoordinates node is used 
to deﬁne the direction of a line using the Line.ByStartPointDirectionLength node. The YAxis 
node is also a vector and was used in the preceding surface example to deﬁne the direction of 
an extrusion.
Coordinate Systems
Coordinate systems are two-dimensional abstract planes, similar to construction planes 
in CAD software, and are used to create local coordinates for evaluating existing geomet-
ric conditions and creating new ones. Coordinate system nodes can be found by browsing 
Geometry ➢ Vector or Geometry ➢ Plane in the Node Library. In Figure 10.23, a Surface.
CoordinateSystemAtParameter node was used to locate a coordinate system on a surface at 
(U:0.5, V:0.5).

Geometric Transformations
A transformation is a general term for methods used to manipulate the orientation, size, and 
location of a shape. Common transformations are translate (move), scale, rotate, and reﬂect. 
Figure 10.24 shows two of these transformations. Vectors and coordinate systems are critical for 
deﬁning a transformation.

Revit to Dynamo to Revit
The real utility of Dynamo lies in its connection to Revit, enhancing the design process by com-
bining design computation with a robust building information database. Information from a 
Revit project or family ﬁle can be ported into Dynamo, provided that you opened the Dynamo 
session when your existing ﬁle was open. If you have multiple ﬁles open, make sure that the 
active window belongs to the appropriate ﬁle before clicking Dynamo. Revit-related nodes are 
found in their own menu within the Node Library.
Category, Type, and Element Selections
Controlling the quality of a Revit project ﬁle through auditing and en masse model changes are 
two prospects ripe with manual technical solutions, plug-ins, and workarounds developed over 
the years. Dynamo’s suite of Revit selection nodes, found by browsing for Revit ➢ Selection and 
for Revit ➢ Elements within the Node Library, can help you develop your own dynamic solu-
tions. There are two general types of nodes that when used together can query and select ele-
ments in a Revit ﬁle: menu selection nodes and All Elements nodes.
 
◆
Menu selection nodes are more difﬁcult to ﬁnd because they do not have a standard nam-
ing convention, but they all share two common features: no input ports and an embedded 
drop-down menu. These nodes can give you access to Revit categories and types. There 
is also the Element Types node, a node where the term element is used broadly to describe 
nearly anything in Revit, from sun settings to voltage types to phase ﬁlters.
 
◆
All Elements nodes select all the elements in a project based on a particular qualiﬁcation, 
usually one of the tiers within the Revit hierarchy (Category ➢ Family ➢ Type ➢ Instance).
Auditing a Revit Project
Figure 10.25 shows two project ﬁle audits being performed. Using the Categories and Element 
Types nodes connected to All Elements nodes, you can identify all walls that have been placed  
Figure 10.24

ADDITIONAL DYNAMO TOOLS | 379
Placing Revit Families
In addition to auditing, you can use menu selection and All Elements nodes to help place Revit 
families. In Figure 10.26, a Dynamo deﬁnition creates a series of ﬂoors. All elements of category 
levels are retrieved from the model. The level elevations are used to deﬁne a series of points. 
These points deﬁne planes where a rectangle is placed. A Floor.ByOutlineTypeandLevel node 
uses a Longest list lacing option to combine the outlines, ﬂoor type, and levels to create a series 
of ﬂoor elements in the project.

shows the wall type properties as a series of sublists corresponding to the order of the list of 
wall types.

380 | CHAPTER 10 CONCEPTUAL DESIGN 
Manual Selections
There are a variety of manual selection nodes available in Revit ➢ Selection (or you can type 
select in the search bar). These are point-click nodes that allow you to select model elements 
as well as parts of model elements. These nodes tend to be more useful in conceptual mass 
families than project ﬁles. Once selected, the element is visible in the workspace 3D preview. 
The node is now dynamically linked to the object, recognizing any modiﬁcations that might 
occur in the Revit ﬁle and displaying the element ID below the select button, as shown in 
Figure 10.27.
Figure 10.27 
Selecting faces of 
a conceptual mass
Interoperability
There is an entire ecosystem of software being used by architects and engineers during the 
design process. Each particular platform in that ecosystem has its own ﬁle formats and proto-
cols. Moving from one ﬁle format to the next can result in both data loss and geometric “impu-
rity.” Interoperability, a term heard often when discussing BIM processes and workﬂows, is a 
property of one piece of software that enables it to work with another. More generally, the term 
has come to mean the ability to send and receive data seamlessly.
Using database formats like spreadsheets is a pragmatic (and democratic) solution to the 
problem of interoperability. If you can convert design data into a tabular form, Dynamo proves 
quite useful. Dynamo has the ability to read and write in both Microsoft Excel and CSV formats. 
The Excel nodes, Excel.ReadFromFile and Excel.WriteToFile, can be found in their own menu 
named Ofﬁce. CSV nodes can be located in the BuiltIn and Core menus. Using either format will 
require File Path inputs.

ADDITIONAL DYNAMO TOOLS | 381
The original data is three columns corresponding to x, y, and z values. As you can see  
in the output of the Excel.ReadFromFile node, Dynamo understands the data in a way that  
might seem unconventional at ﬁrst. The highest-order list deﬁnes a row, and the three items  
in that list deﬁne the three columns. Each list could be considered a point, in effect, but  
Point.ByCoordinates requires three inputs. The List.Transpose node is used to transpose the 
data, similar to transposing a spreadsheet (swapping columns and rows). Once transposed, 
there are three lists each with all values x, y, or z. A Code Block is used in lieu of List.GetItems 
to quickly create three outputs that can be used to create the point geometry.

Data can just as easily be sent to Excel from Revit (via Dynamo). In Figure 10.29, room data 
is retrieved from a project ﬁle and exported to a newly created Excel ﬁle. The resultant 
spreadsheets were added to emphasize the connections in Figure 10.29. Using selection 
nodes, all elements of category Room are retrieved, and room parameters are obtained 
using Element.GetParameterValueByName. The room names and areas are then combined 
into a List.Create node. If the data was placed into Excel.WriteToFile at this point, the 
result would be 14 columns of data including one row of room names and one row of room 
areas. By transposing the data before writing to Excel, you can create a more conventional 
spreadsheet.
Figure 10.28 
Importing Excel data 
to create points
Excel to Revit
An Excel spreadsheet can be used to create a set of points. File.Path and File.FromPath are used 
to convert the browsed path to an input for Excel.ReadFromFile, as shown in Figure 10.28. A 
String input is used to locate the correct sheet in Excel. Keep in mind, strings are case sensitive. 
If you are having trouble accessing the data from a spreadsheet, check to make sure your sheet 
name is correct.

Package Manager
The Dynamo Node Library is extensive and built for a variety of applications across a range 
of industries, but there is always missing functionality or modiﬁcations to existing nodes that 
might pique a user’s interest. Dynamo is open source and welcomes community involvement. 
The package manager is a portal for Dynamo users to develop and publish additions to the 
Node Library to extend Dynamo’s core functionality.
Packages are available to download in the online package search by choosing Packages ➢ 
Search For A Package in the toolbar. The list might take a few moments to load. Packages can 
include a suite of nodes or be an individual node. You can browse existing packages or search 
using the search bar at the top of the window. Similar to the Node Library, searching will limit 
the results related to what you type.
To install a package, select the download icon and voilà! At the bottom of the Online Package 
Search window, the downloaded package is highlighted in cyan. The location of the new node 
(or nodes) depends on how the developer has structured the package. In some cases, installing 
a new package might create an additional menu in your Node Library; in others, it might be 
blended to ﬁt within the library. Use the search bar if you are unsure where an installed package 
has been located.
Additional Resources
Sample deﬁnitions are included during installation; you can access them in the Dynamo tool-
bar under Help ➢ Samples. Learning Dynamo can be both rewarding and arduous, but you 
are not alone! The community of Dynamo users is continuously growing. At DynamoBIM 
(www.dynamobim.org) you can ﬁnd additional tutorials, forums, user galleries, and a blog. 
A simple online search query for help with a Dynamo issue can yield many results, but it is 
important to realize that Dynamo is (currently) a perpetual beta software that has undergone 
many changes since 2011. Online search results that are more than a year old can yield obso-
lete solutions.

Getting Started with FormIt
Autodesk’s FormIt application is architectural modeling software that enables architects 
to sketch, collaborate, analyze, and revise early-stage design concepts. FormIt began as an 
iPad-only application but is now also available as a full desktop application. FormIt has the 
capability to create conceptual design models and output presentation-quality images. From 
inception, FormIt’s mission has been to eliminate the “throw-away” design model by enabling 
the transition from a free-ﬂowing concept design phase model to a design development and 
documentation model in Revit. This capability has grown in Revit 2018. We will explore a few 
of the interoperability-focused workﬂows between FormIt and Revit in this section. FormIt is 
available on Windows, installed side by side with Revit (http://formit360.autodesk.com). 
In Figure 10.30, you can see examples of conceptual FormIt models.
Figure 10.30 
FormIt models 
shown with 
two diﬀerent 
rendering styles
FormIt is intended for architectural designers in the conceptual design phase of a project. 
FormIt ﬁts between the loose push-and-pull modeling environment reminiscent of SketchUp 
and the powerful constraints of Autodesk Revit. FormIt introduces BIM concepts early in the 
design process and maintains intelligent model elements downstream to Revit.
Conceptual design is an important phase of any project where general massing crucially 
informs building area, solar impact, and whole-building energy analysis. These early decisions 
and the compelling presentation imagery shared with stakeholders are essential to winning proj-
ect work. Too often schematic design models are “thrown away” when the work is won and 
project documentation begins. FormIt exists to end the throw-away model by smoothly con-
necting models to Revit.
Understanding the FormIt UI
Before you get started with massing and model building exercises, let’s take a quick look at the 
application and the basic interactions such as camera navigation and selection. The FormIt user 
interface is designed to have common tools you need right at your ﬁngertips for quick decision-
making. The overall UI looks like Figure 10.31.

384 | CHAPTER 10 CONCEPTUAL DESIGN 
Navigation
First, the FormIt mouse commands work very much like the Revit commands. Zooming, pan-
ning, orbiting, and swiveling use the same mouse movements as Revit. Just like with Revit, 
you can also access these tools from a menu command. They are located on the right side of the 
screen (see Figure 10.32).
Figure 10.31 
Te FormIt UI
Figure 10.32 
FormIt naviga-
tion tools
In this screen, creation and editing tools appear across the top. Here you can create and 
manipulate and perform selections and measurements. Down the right side of Figure 10.31 are 
the navigation tools. Before we get into form creation and manipulation, let’s take a quick look at 
how to move around within the model.

GETTING STARTED WITH FORMIT | 385
To change your view angle, you can use the middle mouse button, similar to Revit. Different 
from Revit, FormIt does not have a ViewCube but instead has three tools in the upper-right 
corner of the UI to help with model orientation (Figure 10.33). These tools are referred to as view 
modes. Perspective View, Top View, and Fly-Through are different modes to review your model.
Figure 10.33 
FormIt view modes
FormIt is always operating from a 3D viewpoint. Currently there are no 2D views that cut 
geometry like plans or sections in Revit. Primarily, you will be modeling in a 3D perspective 
camera orientation.
When you select the Top View tool, you enter a plan view, but it’s important to note that this 
view is similar to a site plan—you are above the entire model, looking down from the sky.
The other icon associated with Top View and Perspective View is the Fly-Through mode, 
which is a fun ﬁrst-person-style walk-through. You can move through your model with WASD 
keyboard controls and hover (like with a jet-pack) using the spacebar. You can also take steps up 
and down with Q and E. This is helpful for setting up custom scenes, which we’ll discuss later.
Modeling
Now that you know the basics of navigation, we’ll explore the essential selection and modeling 
interactions tools. The Action bar at the top of the screen has several tools (Figure 10.34).
 
◆
The Pencil tool has a few sketch tools in the ﬂyout menu that allow you to draw lines, arcs, 
and shapes.
 
◆
The Line tool (L) allows you to sketch in lines on the ground plane and “up” into the z-axis 
as well.
 
◆
The Rectangle (R) tool is essential, and you’ll use it heavily when you get to modeling.
 
◆
The Arc (A), Spline (S), and Circle (C) tools are exactly what they sound like, allowing you 
to draw those shapes.
Figure 10.34 
FormIt modeling tools

386 | CHAPTER 10 CONCEPTUAL DESIGN 
Please try all of these different drawing tools out in the drawing view, called the Canvas 
in FormIt. To place a point, click anywhere in the canvas. The default drawing mode is using 
the Line tool, and this will place your ﬁrst point. To place the second point, click in the canvas 
again. The two points will automatically connect with a line.
You’ll notice an editable dimension appear as you’re drawing lines. You can either click 
the dimension box or press the Tab key to bring up a small dialog box where you can input a 
speciﬁc dimension (Figure 10.35).
Figure 10.35 
Drawing to an exact 
dimension
While you’re placing points in the sketch tools, you’ll see red, green, and blue axis lines 
appear on the canvas. These are guides that correspond to the x-, y-, and z-axes of your model. 
When they appear, hold down the Shift key to “lock” your next point onto that axis. This 
enables you to draw perfectly parallel and perpendicular lines in the 3D canvas.
If you start drawing lines off the cardinal XYZ grid, then you’ll begin seeing purple guides 
appear—these represent axes parallel and perpendicular to the custom angles you’ve drawn. As 
you’re drawing lines, you’ll notice small, colorful snap icons appear. These represent the basic 
snaps you are familiar with from Revit.
 
◆
Red square icons indicate “endpoint.”
 
◆
Green circle icons indicate “on edge.”
 
◆
Red triangle icons indicate “midpoint.”
 
◆
Blue diamond icons indicate “on face.”
When you have drawn a “closed loop” of lines, a geometric face will automatically be created. 
You’ll still be in the sketch tool, so you can continue sketching from the last placed point. Once 
you are done sketching, you can hit the Esc key to stay in the sketch tool (your next mouse click 
will start your next line), or you can hit the spacebar to clear the sketch tool and start selecting 
other geometry.
At its heart, FormIt is a fun, fast, push-pull modeler. There are a few tricks to master in order 
to be a push-pull pro. Note that FormIt calls the push-pull tool Drag Face.
Select a face by clicking one. If you already have a face drawn (from the previous sketching 
exploration), then go ahead and select it. If you don’t, then draw a Rectangle and then hit Esc a 
few times to clear the sketch tool.

GETTING STARTED WITH FORMIT | 387
Once you select a face, you are automatically put into the push-pull tool. You have to click 
only once (on the face or on an endpoint of the face) to start the drag face operation. Then 
you are free to move your mouse to the desired location and click again to end the drag face. 
Figure 10.36 demonstrates the Drag Face tool.
Figure 10.36 
Manipulating 
geometry with the 
Drag Face tool
When you start a drag face, you’ll see a blue axis line appear. This indicates the orthogonal 
(or normal) direction you can pull the face. Essentially you’re already locked onto an axis in 
drag face, so your mouse can wander all over the canvas and snap to any other point or face. 
This allows you to align your drag face with any other element in the model.
Note that you can select more than one face at a time (by holding down the Shift key when 
you click to select similar to Revit). Then you can drag more than one face at a time.
One essential technique to practice is splitting a face, which combines sketch tools with the 
Drag Face tool. Choose the Line tool (L) and split a face by drawing a line from the midpoint 
of one edge to the midpoint of another edge on the face. This will create two faces where there 
used to be one—you’ve split a face! When you select one of the faces, you can push it in or out of 
the plane of the face. Figure 10.37 shows the results of the Split Face tool.
Figure 10.37 
Manipulating 
geometry with the 
Drag Face tool

388 | CHAPTER 10 CONCEPTUAL DESIGN 
Selecting Elements
FormIt has a hover highlight tool that indicates what you are about to select. This gets you 
started, but of course there are selection tricks that you’ll want to master too. Here’s a list of a 
few of the tools you’ll want to get to know in order to use FormIt more ﬂuidly.
 
◆
Click to select a face.
 
◆
Click to also select edges (click the desired edge).
 
◆
Click to select vertices (endpoints of faces and faces).
 
◆
Click to select groups. You’ll create groups later in this chapter.
 
◆
Double-click to select everything that is connected by a line or face. If you place a cube in 
the model, you can click faces and edges. If you double-click the cube, you select the entire 
cube. If you’ve created a more complex shape than a cube, then you can still double-click to 
select all of it at once.
 
◆
Double-click will select less important elements such as imported images and imported 
satellite images.
 
◆
Double-click is also an essential shortcut to move into group edit mode.
Finally, for multiselection, you’ll start from the upper-left corner of your canvas and drag 
your mouse across the elements in your canvas to the lower-right corner of the canvas. You’ll see 
a red rectangle appear to indicate the “window” of the canvas that you’ve selected. You can ﬁlter 
your selection with the Select tool in the Select + Filter ﬂyout (Figure 10.38).
Figure 10.38 
Filtering a 
selection
Understanding Context Menus
FormIt has a minimal user interface to keep the focus of the interactions in the modeling canvas. 
There are a number of useful tools that are hidden in context menus accessed after selecting 
speciﬁc geometry. To access the context menu, you’ll have to select the thing you want to edit 
and right-click the mouse. You will see a circular context menu appear with the tools available 
related to that FormIt element (Figure 10.39). We won’t deﬁne all the tools in the FormIt context 
menus. That’s what the FormIt Help documentation is for!

GETTING STARTED WITH FORMIT | 389
Using Groups
Before moving on to a massing and modeling exercise, we have to pause and discuss groups. 
Groups are fundamental to successful modeling in FormIt and are also the vehicle to translate 
geometry to Revit. Groups are the key to creating distinct building components. Groups also 
allow you to separate geometry so elements don’t automatically combine. To illustrate this, let’s 
do a simple exercise without groups.
1. Place a cube from the 3D Primitives toolbar on to the canvas (Figure 10.40).
Figure 10.39 
FormIt context 
menus
Figure 10.40 
Placing a prim-
itive form
2. Start the Rectangle (R) sketch tool and draw a rectangle, making sure the edge of the rect-
angle overlaps with the edge of the cube.
3. When you’re done with the Rectangle tool, hit Esc on your keyboard to clear the tool.
4. Select the face of the rectangle and pull it up to make a solid. Finally, double-click the 
resulting geometry.
You should see that your cube and your extruded rectangle are essentially joined together 
and are now a single element, as in Figure 10.41. This is what happens when elements are cre-
ated outside of a group.

390 | CHAPTER 10 CONCEPTUAL DESIGN 
Let’s try a similar exercise but this time using groups.
1. Place a cube from the 3D Primitives toolbar.
2. Don’t hit the Esc key to keep the cube in selection, or double-click to select the cube again.
3. With the cube selected, right-click and choose the Create Group command, or press  
the G keyboard shortcut. The cube should have a dashed line around it and a stipple 
pattern on it.
4. Click in a blank part of the canvas to unselect, or hit Esc to clear the selection.
5. Draw a rectangle (R) as you did before, with one side connected to the cube.
6. Select the resulting face, and drag it up to create a solid.
7. Double-click to select the extruded rectangle. Add the group to the selection by holding 
down Ctrl and select the group.
The result will look like Figure 10.42. While similar to the other workﬂow, the key difference 
is that the elements will now move independently. They are not automatically joined.
Groups are also the method for creating parent-child relationships such that a change to one 
instance ripples through the model and updates all of the related groups. In Revit terminology, 
they are similar to families.
Figure 10.41 
Joined geom-
etry in FormIt

GETTING STARTED WITH FORMIT | 391
There are a handful of group-speciﬁc commands on the context menu when you have a 
group selected. Click a group to select it and then right-click. We’ll review these icons in coun-
terclockwise order from the top of the circular context menu shown in Figure 10.43.
Figure 10.42 
Unjoined 
geometry

Figure 10.43 
Te Group 
context menu

392 | CHAPTER 10 CONCEPTUAL DESIGN 
Starting at the top of the circle and moving counterclockwise, the tools are as follows:
Create Group (G)  You can create a group around a group, which is essentially what hap-
pens when you make nested groups.
Edit Group (E)  This is another way to enter into Edit Group mode. The double-click is more 
direct, but you can also select this icon, or you can select a group and type E for the keyboard 
shortcut.
Make Unique (MU)  This allows you to sever the relationship of this group from the other 
instances of the group. Now you can make changes to this particular group without affecting 
other groups.
Ungroup (U)  This tool explodes the group currently selected, leaving you with the indi-
vidual components. No geometry is deleted in this action.
Ungroup All (UA)  This tool is a bit more destructive, but it’s also a big time-saver if you 
have many nested groups. Ungroup All will ungroup everything below the currently 
edited group.
As we mentioned, groups are roughly equivalent to the concept of families in Revit. To that 
end, FormIt provides a way to categorize groups so that when they are imported to Revit, they will 
become families of a speciﬁed category. The list of categories is short but can be helpful. By default, 
groups are categorized as Mass. To modify the category, double-click to edit a group and then look 
in the Properties palette; you will see a category drop-down (Figure 10.44). Here you can choose 
from Casework, Entourage, Furniture, Furniture Systems, Generic Models, Parking, Site, and 
Specialty Equipment. We’ll talk more about techniques for importing to Revit later in this chapter.
Figure 10.44 
Modifying

Using FormIt for Massing
You have now practiced a few of the basic interactions of FormIt, had a chance to explore the 
interface, and drawn a few shapes. Let’s go through the most basic workﬂow in FormIt. You are 
going to model a simple mass and migrate that content to Revit.
Like Revit, FormIt is linked to Autodesk’s A360 platform. The online workspace allows for 
interoperability between many of Autodesk’s applications. To begin the exercise, you ﬁrst need 
to be signed in to A360. Select the avatar icon in the upper right of the FormIt tool (Figure 10.45) 
to sign in. If you don’t have an account, you can create one from here. This is an essential step as 
the A360 platform will convert FormIt content to Revit content.

GETTING STARTED WITH FORMIT | 393
1. Let’s make sure you’re starting the exercise with a clean canvas. Start a New FormIt 
project (Ctrl+N) from the File drop-down (Figure 10.46) and choose New.
Figure 10.45

Te Settings drop-
down menu
Figure 10.48 
Using the 
Location tool
2. Set the units appropriate for your project in the Settings drop-down (Figure 10.47). Units 
are critical for migration to Revit at the proper scale. Choose Units from the ﬂyout menu 
and select either Imperial or Metric.
3. Next you need to set the location of your project. This is necessary for Shadows, Solar, 
and Energy Analysis. Choose the Location pin icon (see Figure 10.48). A Google Maps 
dialog box appears. Enter the street address or city of the project in the Search box in the 
upper-left corner of the dialog box.
4. A red pin appears, and the map updates to show the chosen address. Click the Import 
Satellite Image button in the upper right of the dialog box to add an aerial image to 
your canvas.
5. A new view will appear with a cropped view of the satellite image. You can zoom and 
pan to choose the image extents you want to see. Click Finish Importing Image to import 
the satellite image to your FormIt canvas. Now you have accurate scale and have estab-
lished true north (type DN to see the north arrow).

394 | CHAPTER 10 CONCEPTUAL DESIGN 
6. Sketch out a basic mass. This can be a simple cube for the purposes of this exercise. 
Manipulate your forms and group (G) the resulting geometry.
7. Once you’re satisﬁed with the design of your mass, save your progress by pressing Ctrl+S 
or choosing File ➢ Save Sketch. Note that you have two options to save your ﬁle, either 
locally or A360 Drive (Figure 10.49). In addition, FormIt allows you to save to your A360 
Drive in the cloud, to your local ﬁle system, or to a network drive. Feel free to choose 
whatever you prefer.
Figure 10.49 
Understanding the 
Save options
8. Next you’re going to place some levels. Find the Levels tab of the tool palette on the right 
(Figure 10.50). Click the Add Levels icon or the Add Multiple Levels icon next to it at the 
top of the palette. Specify the number of levels and the ﬂoor-to-ﬂoor height you anticipate 
in your project. Finally, click OK to create the list of levels.
Figure 10.50 
Adding levels 
to the mass
9. Your mass should now be populated with levels similar to Figure 10.51. You can rename 
these levels by double-clicking the name in this list. Note that these levels are not auto-
matically applied to the geometry in the model. You have the opportunity to tell FormIt 
which geometry you want included in your Level Area calculation.
10. Now you want to add those levels to your mass. Click to select your Mass group and go 
to the Properties palette. Choose the Use Levels (UL) command to apply levels to the 
selected geometry.

GETTING STARTED WITH FORMIT | 395
You can see the list of levels that have been applied to your selection, and you can uncheck the 
levels that you do not want to use. This may be helpful in the case of atriums, mezzanine levels, 
or other similar spaces. Each level will calculate the ﬂoor area of the applied mass reporting how 
much area is on each level. If you unselect the geometry (by clicking in a space or hitting Esc) and 
look in the Properties palette, you can see the total area of all the geometry in the model.
In the canvas you should see all of the levels that intersect your mass geometry, which will 
appear as blue lines. You can snap to these level lines when you are sketching new geometry or 
dragging a face.
You can toggle the display of these levels by typing DL (display levels) on the keyboard or by 
clicking the visual styles icon (the sunglasses), choosing the Environment tab, and unchecking 
the Levels option.
The models you have seen so far in this chapter are available for download from the  
Chapter 10 folder on this book’s web page, www.sybex.com/go/masteringrevit2018. The ﬁle  
is called c10_01_MassExample.axm.
Shadows
For the next exercise, we’re going to look at how FormIt deals with shade and shadow. Not only 
is this beneﬁcial from a design exploration standpoint, but it will also impact solar gain stud-
ies and energy analysis. To activate shadows, ﬁnd the sun icon on the main toolbar and click it 
(Figure 10.52).
Selecting this tool will activate the Shadows dialog box. Selecting the Shadows check box at 
the top of the dialog enables shadows on the canvas. The rest of the dialog is a simple interface 
to choose the time of day and day of year to explore the shadow conditions you desire to visual-
ize. You can either adjust the sliders or type in speciﬁc date and time values.
Figure 10.51 
Adding levels in 
the mass model
Figure 10.52 
Te Shadow tool

396 | CHAPTER 10 CONCEPTUAL DESIGN 
Solar Analysis
At the bottom of the Shadows dialog box is the Solar Analysis tool (Figure 10.53). Selecting the 
tool places you in a speciﬁc mode that disables all editing tools and keyboard shortcuts. By 
clicking the Analyze button in the toolbar in the upper-left corner of the canvas, FormIt will cal-
culate and then render a thermal picture of the solar impact on your design. The default option 
is a Monthly Peak analysis, which is intended for a window shading study.
Figure 10.53 
Te Solar 
Analysis tool
Note that you can adjust the month of the year to see how the solar impact will change 
from month to month. You can also choose to the view the year’s cumulative results. This is 
intended for a solar panel study to demonstrate how to maximize solar gain for best panel 
efﬁciency.
By hovering the mouse over the different colors on your mass, a speciﬁc value will be 
reported to you, giving you some speciﬁc data to go with the thermal rendering. You can export 
this image by pressing Ctrl+E and choosing an image or by choosing File ➢ Export ➢ Image.
To exit Solar Analysis mode, unselect the check box in the toolbar.

GETTING STARTED WITH FORMIT | 397
Converting FormIt to Revit
As we mentioned at the beginning of this section, FormIt is designed to be a conceptual model-
ing tool with which you can easily migrate models to Revit. However, before migrating FormIt 
to Revit, let’s take a moment and do a “preﬂight check” of the FormIt geometry to ensure that it 
will import as expected. FormIt has a few model diagnostic features to help see any issues that 
may impact a successful conversion of your design geometry to Revit (or 3D printing). This is 
referred to as checking to see whether the model is “water tight.” What FormIt looks for is gaps 
in the geometry that would work in FormIt but not transfer properly to Revit.
To perform this check, look in the Visual Styles panel, go to the Diagnostics tab, and enable 
Watertight Issues and Back Faces (Figure 10.54). Any oddities in your model, such as nonsolids, 
stray edges, shared edges, inside out faces, and so on, will show up as red in this view. Those 
geometries will need to be resolved before you can successfully move the model to Revit.
Figure 10.54 
Checking the 
FormIt model 
geometry prior 
to moving the 
content to Revit
If you do see red highlighting geometric ﬁdelity issues, you can use the following to address 
them: use the Cover (CV) tool to heal missing faces on solids; delete stray edges (edges that 
do not enclose a region) or select inside-out faces, right-click, and choose Reverse Faces (FF). 
When your model is clean, save your ﬁle locally (Ctrl+S). This will create an AXM ﬁle that you’ll 
import to Revit. We used the c10_01_MassExample.axm ﬁle from earlier in this section.
Importing to Revit
To import the ﬁle into Revit, open Autodesk Revit 2018 and start a new ﬁle with the Architectural 
template. You can either stay in plan view or open the default 3D view. Next, select the Import 
FormIt To RVT tool from the FormIt Converter panel on the Add-Ins tab (Figure 10.55). If you 
don’t have this tab visible, your version of Revit is likely out of date, and we recommend you run 
the updates from the Autodesk Application Manager in the system tray.
Figure 10.55 
Importing FormIt ﬁles 
to Revit

398 | CHAPTER 10 CONCEPTUAL DESIGN 
Click the drop-down menu and click the Import FormIt To Revit button. Navigate to the 
AXM ﬁle you just saved from the FormIt export and select it. Revit will start the import process, 
which may take a few moments depending on how many groups you had in your FormIt sketch. 
If there are any errors in the import process, Revit will report the name of the FormIt group that 
it had trouble importing.
The FormIt geometry is now imported into Revit, and you should see 3D massing geom-
etry in your view (Figure 10.56). If you don’t see them, you may need to visit the Visibility And 
Graphics dialog (VG) and enable the Mass category. You can ﬁnd the imported Revit model on 
this book’s companion web page. The model is called c10_01_MassExample.rvt.
Figure 10.56 
Imported FormIt 
geometry in Revit
FormIt levels and their custom names have been imported to Revit also. If you open an eleva-
tion or section view, you will see your FormIt levels represented. You can create Revit ﬂoor 
plans from these levels by navigating to the View tab, choosing Floor Plans, and selecting all of 
the imported levels.
The FormIt levels automatically created mass ﬂoors cutting through your mass geometry. 
Revit allows you to attached Revit system families to mass objects using the Wall By Face, 

ADVANCED MODELING IN FORMIT | 399
Curtain System By Face, and Roof By Face tools located on the Massing & Site tab in the Model 
By Face panel. By associating geometry with the mass, you can continue to work in FormIt to 
further reﬁne your design. When you re-import your model content into Revit, it will move any 
Revit system families to address any changes in the newly imported model.
Another thing that imports into Revit beyond the geometry is the location you speciﬁed as 
well as the time of day and day of year. The geometry is imported relative to the 0,0,0 point of 
the x-, y-, and z-axes in FormIt.
You can continue to import any FormIt geometry into Revit as the FormIt model  
evolves. You can also export Revit geometry back to your FormIt model as SAT ﬁles (Revit  
menu icon ➢ Export ➢ CAD Formats ➢ ACIS (SAT)). The ﬁnished ﬁle for this example is  
c10_02_MassExample_Finished.rvt.
Advanced Modeling in FormIt
Now that you’ve been exposed to the FormIt interface and built out a basic massing workﬂow 
into Revit, we’re going to build on those techniques we just covered. In this section, you will 
explore some advanced modeling tools such as Shell Solid(s), Measure, and Sweep, as well 
as essential FormIt features, such as Materials, Layers, and the Groups Tree. You’ll use a cor-
ner window case study—something that is difﬁcult to model in Revit and instead build it in 
FormIt—and then import it to Revit. Figure 10.57 shows the window condition you are going to 
build in the following exercise.

Moving from a Mass to a Model
The Shell Solid(s) tool in FormIt is the fastest way to go from a conceptual massing study to a 
conceptual design model with interior volumes. Luckily, this powerful tool is also easy to use. 
To use the shell tool to create a corner window condition, follow these steps:
1. Start a new FormIt ﬁle and place a cube from the 3D Primitives drop-down on the canvas.
2. Click the Advanced Geometry toolbar (the cube with the lightning bolt) and choose the 
Shell Solid(s) tool (Figure 10.58).
Figure 10.58

shell tool from 
the Advanced 
Geometry

shelled mass
3. You’ll be presented with a dialog box to enter the thickness of the shell. Note a negative 
value indicates the offset will be in from the outside face of the mass. Set the value to -1′ 
(30 cm). You’ll mimic a 1′-0″ thick wall enclosure. Click OK to close the dialog box.
4. Select the top face of the cube and press Enter. This will remove the top face so you can 
see into your shelled mass. Since you clicked only the top face, it disappears to reveal  
the inside of a volume that has wall thickness and a ﬂoor (Figure 10.59). You can also 
download this completed ﬁle from the book’s companion web page. The ﬁle is called 
c10_02_ModelExample_ShelledMass.axm.

ADVANCED MODELING IN FORMIT | 401
5. You need to build the window opening. Select Create Sketch ➢ Rectangle (R) and draw a 
rectangle on the face of a wall to represent your window opening, similar to Figure 10.60 
at one of the shell’s corners. Make the window’s dimensions 2′ tall by 5′ wide (600 cm × 
1200 cm). Click Esc to exit the Rectangle tool. Make a similar window on the adjoining 
side of the shell so it forms a single window on the corner. Finally, select the rectangle 
(once on both sides) and push the rectangle to delete the shape to form an opening.
Figure 10.60 
Creating the 
window opening
6. Double-click the model and group (G) it. This step is essential; otherwise, the follow-
ing steps will result in a single mass of connected geometry, and you will want to have 
separate elements for Walls, Window Frame, and Window Glass. This step is saved in the 
model, c10_03_ModelExample_WindownOpening.axm.
7. Now you need to create the window frame and glazing. To do this, you’ll enclose the 
opening in your model with a window frame and window glass in the following steps 
using the Sweep tool. Sweeps in FormIt require a proﬁle outline and a path outline. After 
you give it these shapes, FormIt will automatically create complex geometry for you.
a. Zoom into one of the corners of your window opening.
b. Draw a rectangle (R) representing the proﬁle of a window frame. The dimensions 
should be 2′ wide by 2″ thick (60 cm × 5 cm), as in Figure 10.61.
Figure 10.61 
Creating the 
window frame

402 | CHAPTER 10 CONCEPTUAL DESIGN 
8. Select the Sweep (SW) tool from the Advanced Geometry toolbar (Figure 10.62).
Figure 10.62 
Creating the 
window frame
a. Now you’re in Sweep creation mode, as indicated by the toolbar in the upper-left  
corner. Note that the toolbar has some instructional text: “Select a face (or edges) for 
sweep proﬁle.” Click the face of the rectangle you’ve just drawn in the previous step.
b. The toolbar in the corner changes to indicate that you need to select the path for the 
sweep. Single click each of the outer edges of your window opening, as in Figure 10.63. 
Selected edges, like selected faces, will highlight in blue.
Figure 10.63

rectangle and edges 
for the sweep
c. Hit the Enter key, click the check box in the toolbar, or type F to ﬁnish the sweep com-
mand. The window frame is created automatically. Double-click the window frame 
and group (G) it.
d. You’ll create the window glass geometry the same way. You can ﬁnd a  
completed model of this step on the book’s companion website. The ﬁle is called 
c10_04_ModelExample_WindowFrame.axm.
9. Zoom into the corner of the window frame. Using the techniques reviewed, create the actual 
glass that goes into the window opening. A typical insulated pane of glass is 1″ (2.5 cm) 
thick. Remember to group the glass to keep it separate from the rest of the geometry.

ADVANCED MODELING IN FORMIT | 403
Applying Materials
Your model geometry is looking good, but you can’t tell that the glass is transparent or what 
material the window frame and walls might be made from. Next, we’ll cover how to apply  
materials to elements and groups. You’ll start by importing a material seed ﬁle using the 
Content Library.
1. To add materiality to objects, you ﬁrst need to add materials to the model. Select the 
Content Library icon from the tabs on the right. You may recognize this icon from Revit 
(Figure 10.64). The palette shows a few sample examples of furniture families exported 
from Revit.
Figure 10.64 
Te Content 
Library tool
Much of the content library is hosted online. You can ﬁnd the content here: https://
autodesk.box.com/v/FormItContent. Download this folder and place it somewhere 
generic on your system so you can use it for multiple projects. Remember this folder  
location. You’ll want to specify that folder location to your content library in FormIt.
2. In the Content Library palette’s toolbar, click the + icon to add a folder location. You’re 
directed to a dialog where you can choose to link a local folder or to an A360 folder. We’ll 
use the local folder for this exercise. Type the folder path in the FormItContent library 
you downloaded in the previous step. Click OK to exit the dialog (Figure 10.65).
Figure 10.65 
Adding the 
Content Library  
to FormIt

404 | CHAPTER 10 CONCEPTUAL DESIGN 
3. Choose the FormItContent option from the drop-down list at the top of the Content 
Library toolbar. The palette instantly shows folder icons and folder names. Click into 
the Materials folder and then click the Material_Library thumbnail preview. Move your 
mouse into the canvas and blue preview geometry appears. Single-click to place the 
seed ﬁle.
4. Next, select the Materials tool from the tabs on the right (Figure 10.66). You may have 
many materials loaded into your project now, and all of the material names are listed 
with black text, indicating they are in use.
Figure 10.66 
Te Materials tool
Select the material seed ﬁle in the FormIt canvas and delete it. Your material palette list 
still shows all the materials loaded in the project, but now the text is gray, indicating that 
these materials are not in use yet.
5. Let’s paint the walls ﬁrst. Double-click the wall group to enter Edit Group mode. Find the 
Wood – Batten New material in the list of materials. Click the wood thumbnail to load 
your paintbrush with this material. Click a wall face in your model. This will paint the 
material onto one face of the geometry at a time.
While you’re still in the paint tool, double-click the wall geometry. This will paint all the 
faces of the object at once, just like double-clicking to select a solid. Click off in space to 
exit the walls group.
6. Locate the Dark Grey material in the material palette list. Single-click the material thumb-
nail preview to load your paintbrush. Single-click the window frame group. Click Esc to 
clear the paint tool. The frame and the glass all turned dark gray! This is a quick way to 
apply materials to all the faces of a group. Finally, we’ll override the glass to be transparent.
7. Double-click the window frame group to edit the group. Find the Glass material in the 
list. Note that the thumbnail has a checkerboard pattern indicating that the material has 
some transparency. Click the thumbnail, and click the glass group to paint it. Click Esc to 
exit the paintbrush tool, and hit Esc again to exit the window frame group. Press Ctrl+S to 
save you work. The ﬁnal model should look like Figure 10.67.
You can download the ﬁnal model for this step from the book’s companion website. The ﬁle 
is called c10_05_ModelExample_WindowGlass.axm.

THE BOTTOM LINE | 405
Based on the steps in the previous examples, you should now also be able to take your con-
ceptual design from FormIt into Revit. If you choose to bring this model into Revit, you’ll also 
notice how the materials will now also import saving additional rework!
FormIt has many additional tools to support collaboration within the same conceptual model 
canvas, sharing models with clients, and so on. As you continue to explore the tool, we feel con-
ﬁdent that you will ﬁnd it a good companion to Revit during conceptual design.
Te Bottom Line
Get started with Autodesk Dynamo.  Dynamo has a simple, straightforward UI. Becoming 
comfortable with the parts of the user interface can allow you more ﬂexibility and lower frus-
tration when learning the application, either as a novice or on your road to becoming an expert.

 Chapter  11 
 Working with Phasing, Groups, 
and Design Options   
 Projects will progress through various stages during design and construction. As a result, it is 
sometimes necessary to distinguish the element of time within your project: when something is 
created, if it is demolished, and what it will look like when the project is complete. Beyond just 
phasing, design is also about maintaining relationships between repetitive elements. Sometimes 
this repetitive element can be a single component in your project, such as a light or a piece of 
furniture. But it can also be an entire collection of elements, such as a typical room in a hotel or 
hospital. 
 Another fundamental aspect of design is the iteration of options. You have to be able to see 
many ideas simultaneously and in context with other ideas. The client and contractor need to 
see options and alternates. It is important that these options not be fully independent, separate 
ﬁ les so that the results can be analyzed and compared. 
 This chapter focuses on these three concepts: time, repetition, and iteration of options. 
In Autodesk ® Revit ® software, they’re addressed with phasing, groups, and design options, 
respectively. 
 In this chapter, you will learn to 
 
◆
 Use the Phasing tools to create, demolish, and propose a new design 
 
◆
Understand and use groups 
 
◆
Create and use design options 
 Using Phasing 
Phasing is the software’s method of allowing you to add the element of time to objects in your 
project. It is easy to think of an architectural design in terms of what something is, where some-
thing is, and how it will be assembled. Phasing adds the dimension of  when something is, which 
is incredibly useful and powerful. 
 Phases are most useful for doing the kinds of tasks that require you to show when elements 
are being introduced into your design, such as showing demolition and new construction in an 
existing building or showing different drawing packages as examples. But a few words of cau-
tion and clariﬁ cation: we do not recommend using extensive phasing to simulate construction 
sequencing, which is referred to as 4D. It might seem like a great idea at ﬁ rst, but ultimately it 
will degrade the performance of your model and lead to confusion across your project team.

408 | CHAPTER 11 WORKING WITH PHASING, GROUPS, AND DESIGN OPTIONS  
There is a far more efﬁcient method of simulating construction sequences that allows model 
elements to be scheduled, viewed, and even color-coded based on the sequence value that you 
deﬁne: project parameters.
By using project parameters, you are able to create and assign an instance parameter value to 
everything in your project that you would want to assign a construction sequence, as shown in 
Figure 11.1.
Figure 11.1 
Creating a con-
struction sequence 
instance parameter 
for project geometry
Once you have created this instance parameter, you will be able to create view ﬁlters that over-
ride the default display style of an object based on the parameter value, as shown in Figure 11.2. 
Each construction week value is assigned to a ﬁlter rule.
Figure 11.2 
Developing ﬁlters by 
parameter

USING PHASING | 409
Combined with visibility and graphic overrides, you are able to create a ﬁlter that modiﬁes 
the graphics based on a parameter, as shown in Figure 11.3.
Figure 11.3 
Applying ﬁlters to 
graphic override 
settings
As a result of applying parameter-based ﬁlters, you will be able to modify the graphics of 
a view to illustrate some metadata about the objects in a far more ﬂexible and predictable way 
than with the phasing functionality, as shown in Figure 11.4. Another beneﬁt is that this technique 
is not limited to views of geometry. View ﬁlters can be applied to any view, including schedules, 
which will allow you to group and ﬁlter schedules based on your unique project parameter.
Figure 11.4 
Using parameters and 
view ﬁlters to override 
graphics
Now that you understand a better way to create sequencing in Revit using parameters and 
ﬁlters, we will discuss how phasing is best used. To work along with the steps in the following 
section, download and open the ﬁle c11-Phases-Start.rvt from this book’s web page at  
www.sybex.com/go/masteringrevit2018.
What Can You Phase?
All modeled elements in Revit have two parameters associated with phasing: Phase Created 
and Phase Demolished. When you place geometry in a view, the Phase Created property by 
default is the phase assigned to that view. For example, if your view is set to Phase Existing, all 
elements you place in that view will automatically be assigned to the Existing phase. After an 
element is placed in the project, the phase can always be changed in the Properties palette, as 
shown in Figure 11.5.

410 | CHAPTER 11 WORKING WITH PHASING, GROUPS, AND DESIGN OPTIONS  
Figure 11.5 
Changing the phase  
of geometry (near  
the bottom of the  
dialog box)
Rooms also have phasing properties, but there is an important difference: the Phase property 
of a room cannot be changed after it is placed. As shown in Figure 11.6, the phase is shown in 
the Properties palette, but it is read only. If you want to change the phase of a room, you will 
need to delete and re-create the room in a view that is assigned the desired phase. You also 
might ﬁnd it faster to press Ctrl+X to cut the rooms from one view and then press Ctrl+V to paste 
them into a view that has been set to the desired phase.
Figure 11.6 
Te Phase of a room 
may not be changed 
after placement.

USING PHASING | 411
The phase of an element when initially placed is often confusing to a new user, but it is 
quite simple: the phase of the view that you are placing the element into determines the ele-
ment’s phase, as shown in Figure 11.7. This is more critical for rooms than for building elements 
because the phase of a building element can be changed after placement. But there may be occa-
sions when you are placing many elements that you intend to be in a particular phase, and you 
will want to create a view with that phase active. This will allow you to place elements in that 
view and not worry about changing their phase later. Changing the name of the view to match 
its current phase is a good technique for organizing multiple phased views.
Figure 11.7 
Changing the phase 
of a view
Implementing Phase Settings
Applying the notion of time to your project may seem complicated, but it is actually quite simple 
to implement. You just need to understand three basic aspects about the settings related to 
phasing.
 
◆
What are the major phases of your project?
 
◆
How will you use the phasing properties to ﬁlter views within your project 
documentation?
 
◆
What is the graphic convention to convey an object’s phase?
These aspects are expressed in the three tabs of the Phasing dialog box. On the Manage 
tab of the ribbon, click the Phasing button to open the Phasing dialog box, shown in  
Figure 11.8.

412 | CHAPTER 11 WORKING WITH PHASING, GROUPS, AND DESIGN OPTIONS  
Figure 11.8 
Te Phasing 
dialog box
Applying Project Phases
In the most common of phased projects, you will have views to illustrate Existing, Demolition, 
and New Construction conditions. On more complex projects, you might have several stages 
of new construction as you build out larger facilities. This dialog box shows only Existing and 
New Construction, so new users may mistakenly create a new phase for Demolition. As we will 
demonstrate later, demolished elements are represented with phase ﬁlters, not as a dedicated 
project phase.
So, when do you need to create more than the phases shown by default? As one example, 
think of a staged construction project that will happen in two new phases. In this scenario, 
you are designing with a start time for the building shell followed by another phase for interi-
ors, allowing the owner to split funding for the project into two budgets. In the ﬁrst phase, the 
building core and shell are built. In the second phase, interior construction occurs. Your ﬁrst 
phase is labeled Shell And Core. Your other phase is labeled Interiors. This phasing also gives a 
contractor who is familiar with Revit the ability to use the model to see what needs to be built 
and when. Depending on how your model is created, the contractor can even do cost estimates 
by phase.
In the Project Phases tab of the Phasing dialog box, create the two phases as we just described 
(Figure 11.9). You can simply rename the New Construction phase Shell and Core. Click the 
Insert After button to create an additional project phase and then rename it Interiors. We will 
use these in a sample exercise in a moment. When you are creating phases, you might notice 
there is no Delete button. You cannot delete a phase once you have added it, because you do not 
want to delete any geometry placed on any phase by deleting just that phase. Should your plan-
ning process change and you want to eliminate a phase, you can merge two phases using either 
of the Combine With buttons on the right, without the fear of losing model objects associated 
with those retired phases.

project phases
Click OK to accept the changes and close the Phasing dialog box; then activate the Level 1 
ﬂoor plan. Once you have created these additional project phases, pick any project geometry and 
look at its instance parameters. You will notice in the Properties palette that it can be assigned to 
any one of these three phases, as shown in Figure 11.10.

phases
Applying Phase Filters
Return to the Manage tab in the ribbon and once again click the Phasing tool. The middle tab in 
the Phasing dialog box is Phase Filters (Figure 11.11). Seven predeﬁned phase ﬁlters are listed.

414 | CHAPTER 11 WORKING WITH PHASING, GROUPS, AND DESIGN OPTIONS  
Figure 11.11 
Te Phase Filters tab 
with seven predeﬁned 
phase ﬁlters
Do not be concerned if the ﬁlter names seem a bit cryptic at ﬁrst. What is really important are 
the four graphic conditions that can be overridden: New, Existing, Demolished, and Temporary. 
Let’s take a moment to explore how these graphic conditions are applied to a virtually unlim-
ited number of user-deﬁned project phases. Any object you place into a project has certain states 
relative to any particular phase. In other words, you might ask the following questions about a 
model element:
 
◆
Was it created in the current phase? This is new.
 
◆
Was it created in a previous phase? This is existing.
 
◆
Was it created in a previous phase and demolished in the current phase? This is demolished.
 
◆
Is the object created and demolished in the same phase? This is temporary.
As you can see, phase ﬁlters are relative settings. That is, the ﬁlters are relative to the phasing 
properties of the object and the phase of the view in which the object is displayed. Also realize 
that although phases are applied to elements, phase ﬁlters are applied only to views.
Now let’s explore the predeﬁned ways a phase ﬁlter can be applied. Select any of the drop-
down menus, as shown in Figure 11.12. You will notice that the phase ﬁlter can override the 
graphics in one of three ways.
By Category  The object can be shown by its category settings or not overridden. It will be 
displayed in the project just as it does by default.
Overridden  This means you can deﬁne a graphic override for that object. We will get into 
the graphic overrides in a moment.
Not Displayed  The object is hidden in the view. You should make sure you differentiate 
this from the object’s existence, as it will continue to interact with other components, visible 
or not.

USING PHASING | 415
Once you understand how each of the phase ﬁlters displays objects, phases can begin to 
make sense. For example, the Show Complete phase ﬁlter shows New and Existing elements 
By Category. But Demolished and Temporary elements are not displayed at all. Use this setting 
when you want to show the model in a ﬁnished condition. Another example is to use the Show 
New phase ﬁlter in a schedule such as in a door schedule. The Show New ﬁlter will include only 
those doors that are assigned to the phase that is also assigned to the schedule. The schedule 
will not list any existing doors or doors that were demolished.
If there is any remaining confusion, it likely involves the naming convention of Show 
Previous + Demo. A better name might be Show Existing + Demolition, but Existing is a bit 
misleading because this setting is showing the previous phase, which is not necessarily exist-
ing elements. They might be temporary elements that need to be demolished. Therefore, Show 
Previous makes more sense.
Using Graphic Overrides
The Graphic Overrides tab is the ﬁnal tab in the Phasing dialog box (Figure 11.13). This dialog 
box relates to the Overridden assignment of the previous tab.
Figure 11.12 
Setting a ﬁlter override
Figure 11.13 
Te Graphic 
Overrides tab

416 | CHAPTER 11 WORKING WITH PHASING, GROUPS, AND DESIGN OPTIONS  
This tab allows you to override geometry in a few areas: the Lines and Patterns character-
istics of Projection/Surface and Cut (which refers to the cut proﬁle of objects). You also have 
the option to just halftone the element. Finally, you can assign a unique Material setting when 
rendering. Although this ability is helpful for rendering with phase information, it can also 
be useful for rendering everything to a matte material, something we discuss in Chapter 12, 
“Visualization.” As it is, phasing can show you where you are (new construction) and where you 
are coming from (existing) but not where you are going (future).
Illustrating the Geometry Phase
Here is a simple exercise to illustrate each of the phases in a single view. Close the  
c11-Phases-Start.rvt ﬁle without saving and then re-open it and activate the default 3D  
view (Figure 11.14).
Figure 11.14 
Four generic walls
By default, all of these walls have been created in the New Construction phase because the 
phase of the view is New Construction. Now, selecting each of the walls from left to right, asso-
ciate them with each of the following phase settings:
 
◆
Wall 1: Phase Created: Existing/Phase Demolished: None
 
◆
Wall 2: Phase Created: Existing/Phase Demolished: New Construction
 
◆
Wall 3: Phase Created: New Construction/Phase Demolished: None
 
◆
Wall 4: Phase Created: New Construction/Phase Demolished: New Construction
It’s Hammer Time
Troughout most of this chapter we show you how to set the Phase Demolished property in the 
Properties palette, but there is a more fun way to change this parameter. In the Modify tab of the 
ribbon, within the Geometry panel you will ﬁnd the Demolish hammer. Activate this tool and you 
can simply click model elements in the active view to set their Phase Demolished property to the 
phase of the view. It has even been suggested to Autodesk to include a hammering sound eﬀect 
to this tool!

USING PHASING | 417
In Figure 11.15, you will notice that Wall 1 (Existing/Phase Demolished: None) and Wall 3  
(New Construction/Phase Demolished: None) look similar. Graphically, this might not be 
enough to demonstrate the different phases, so let’s change the graphic properties of the 
Existing wall so it is more visually distinct.
Figure 11.15 
Default shaded over-

From the Manage tab in the ribbon, click Phases; then click the Graphic Overrides tab. Next, 
select the option to open the Material setting for the Phase - Exist material. You will click the far

box highlighting the Phase - Exist material (Figure 11.16).

well. Click OK to close the Material Browser. When you ﬁnish changing these settings, you’ll 
have the result shown in Figure 11.19, with each phase shown distinctively within the view.
Figure 11.19 
Finished shading 
values
Once you settle on a color and graphic scheme, we recommend making this particular set-
ting part of your default project template or your ofﬁce’s standards. That way, new users will be 
able to distinguish the phase of an object far more clearly, and the standard will be consistent 
throughout your ofﬁce.
Using the View Phase
Now that we have discussed the phasing properties of geometry, we will cover the phase prop-
erties of the views. Starting with the 3D view from the previous example, examine the view 
properties in the Properties palette, provided there are no model elements selected (Figure 11.20). 
We have collapsed some of the property groups at the top to show the Phasing properties at the 
bottom of the list.
Figure 11.20 
Phasing options for  
a view

420 | CHAPTER 11 WORKING WITH PHASING, GROUPS, AND DESIGN OPTIONS  
Remember that all the graphic overrides and ﬁlters for phasing are relative to the phase that 
is assigned to geometry or a view. By default, the New Construction phase is assigned to new 
views created in your project. This phase assignment can be changed at any time from the 
Properties palette. The phase property can also be assigned to a view template for easier man-
agement of this parameter.
The next important step is to apply the most appropriate phase ﬁlter. To illustrate how a 
phase ﬁlter changes the way objects are displayed in a view, you will step through several ﬁlters 
in the following exercises.
The default phase ﬁlter is Show All (Figure 11.21). This ﬁlter will show all the model elements 
relative to the phase assigned to the view and will override their graphics based on their Phase 
Created and Phase Demolished parameters. It also gives you a sense of all the elements as they 
exist in time.
Figure 11.21 
Show All phase 
ﬁlter for the New 
Construction phase

Blue
Although this is great for 3D views, where every phase has a distinct color, it is also useful 
for working in a plan, elevation, or section. To turn this graphic visibility on, activate the Level 1  
ﬂoor plan from the Project Browser and change the Graphic Display setting to Shaded or 
Consistent Colors. You will be able to clearly distinguish between objects in different phases, as 
shown in Figure 11.22.
Now let’s start moving through each of the phase ﬁlters. An important note: rather than mov-
ing through the various phase ﬁlters from top to bottom, we’ll move through time by changing 
the Phase parameter.
Return to the 3D view and keep Phase Filter set to Show All, but change Phase to Existing 
(Figure 11.23). This will show only the objects created in the Existing phase—and their graph-
ics are not overridden. The two walls that were assigned to the New Construction phase are not 
shown in the view because Revit does not provide a way to see future construction beyond the 
phase assigned to the view. Unfortunately, creating a future phase requires adding view-speciﬁc 
2D line work apart from the Phases tool.
Set the phase of the view back to New Construction and set the phase ﬁlter to Show Previous +  
Demo (Figure 11.24). This ﬁlter still shows only the existing walls (the walls from the previous 
phase). One of the walls is clearly being demolished. Keep in mind that the graphic overrides 
that are being applied are relative to what you would be seeing through the lens of the New 
Construction phase.

Now select Show Previous Phase as the phase ﬁlter, as shown in Figure 11.25. The demol-

We will move forward another moment in time and set the phase ﬁlter to Show Previous +

present and previous views (Figure 11.26). It is not always necessary to click Apply in the 
Properties palette each time you want to apply the settings you’ve just changed. Moving your 
mouse pointer outside the palette has the same effect as clicking Apply.

This visualization brings up another interesting point: why not show the remaining exist-

a new phase ﬁlter, for this example we will change the settings of the Show Previous + New 
graphic phase ﬁlter (Figure 11.27). From the Manage tab on the ribbon, click the Phases tool 
again. Choose the Phase Filters tab, and in the Show Previous + New row, go to the Temporary 
column and change the setting to Overridden.

Phasing with Linked Models
If you are working on larger-scale projects, you will want to keep some additional factors in mind 
when using phasing. To control phasing between linked models (which could be linked architectural 
models or consultant models), make sure your phase names are identical. If one model has “Existing +  
Demo” and the other team has “existing+demo,” the linked models will see those as diﬀerent phases. 
Remember, consistency is the key.
Moving forward in time, let’s now show only the elements in the New Construction  
phase. Set the phase ﬁlter to Show New and only one wall will be displayed, as shown in 
Figure 11.30.
Now comes the ﬁnal phase ﬁlter setting, Show Complete (Figure 11.31). This shows only the 
existing elements that were not demolished in previous phases up to the phase assigned to the 
view. Elements that are demolished in any phase are not displayed, and neither existing nor new 
elements are overridden. This phase ﬁlter is most often used for camera views where a render-
ing of the ﬁnished conditions may need to be generated without any sort of graphic overrides.

CREATING AND USING GROUPS | 425
Creating and Using Groups
It is easy to think of groups as functionally similar to blocks in Autodesk® AutoCAD® software 
or cells in Bentley MicroStation, but groups can be much more. They are great at maintaining 
repetition within your project, but there are some major differences.
 
◆
Creating groups is quite easy. And whether it is a 2D or 3D group, the insertion point for 
the group is easily deﬁned and modiﬁed. The same cannot be said of simple 2D blocks in 
other applications.
 
◆
Updating groups is a breeze. It is easy and intuitive to modify a group after it has been 
created. Practically anyone on your team can do it, which means that design workﬂow  
will not bottleneck in your project team.
 
◆
Copying groups throughout your project is also a breeze. Groups can be copied across dif-
ferent levels, rotated, and handle other modiﬁcations. We cover groups in more detail later 
in this chapter.
There are a few good practices that you will want to keep in mind when using groups. But 
they are so straightforward that you will wonder how you have ever worked without them.
Creating Groups
You can create two kinds of groups in Revit. One kind is just for geometry, called model groups. 
The other is just for view-speciﬁc content such as text, tags, dimensions, and so on, and are 
called detail groups. You can create one kind of group or the other explicitly. If you try to create 
a group with both model and detail elements, Revit is smart enough to create a separate detail 
group that is associated with the model group.
To demonstrate this, download and open the ﬁle c11-Groups-Start.rvt or  
c11-Groups-Start-Metric.rvt from this book’s web page. Activate the Level 1 ﬂoor  
plan and you will see four walls with dimensions, as shown in Figure 11.32.
Figure 11.32 
Four walls and 
dimensions

426 | CHAPTER 11 WORKING WITH PHASING, GROUPS, AND DESIGN OPTIONS  
Select the walls and dimensions in the view, and click the Create Group button on the con-
textual ribbon in the Create panel. Keep the default name, Group 1, for both Model Group and 
Attached Detail Group (Figure 11.33).
Figure 11.33 
Creating the model and 
attached detail group
Now select the group of walls and copy it to the side of your original group. You will notice 
that only the model-based group is copied, which is ﬁne for now (Figure 11.34).
Figure 11.34 
Copied model 
group
It is a simple process to associate the detail group to another instance of the model group. 
Select the group and then click the Attached Detail Groups button on the Group panel in the 
contextual ribbon, and you will see the dialog box shown in Figure 11.35. Select the check box 
for Group 1 from the list and click OK.

Modifying Groups
Now that you have created two identical groups, let’s add a door to one of the walls that belong 
to the group, as shown in Figure 11.37. To illustrate a point, do not add the door to the group—
just place it in one of the walls as you would with any nongrouped wall.
Figure 11.37 
Adding a door 
outside of Edit 
Group mode
The results are fairly straightforward (Figure 11.36). Both groups are now identical with 
geometry and dimensions.

428 | CHAPTER 11 WORKING WITH PHASING, GROUPS, AND DESIGN OPTIONS  
Now select the group to the left (the one with the new door) and select Edit Group from 
the Group panel in the contextual tab of the ribbon. You will enter a special editing environ-
ment, shown in Figure 11.38, and the nongrouped elements will be grayed out. The screen 
overlay color alerts you that you are in Edit Group mode. The screen will appear with a 
yellow background in this mode. Here you will be able to add, remove, and attach other ele-
ments to your group.
Now add the door to the group by selecting the Add function from the Edit Group panel. 
When you add an element to the group, it will appear black in the Edit Group mode, letting you 
know it is available for selection. Once you select it and successfully add it to your group, it will 
turn gray with the rest of the group. If you had added a tag on placement, you would not be able 
to add it to the group because this is a model group and tags are 2D components. Now ﬁnish the 
group by clicking the Finish button (the green check), and you will notice that both groups now 
have a door in the same location (Figure 11.39).
Figure 11.39 
Finished group
The process is essentially the same for modifying any group: start the Edit Group mode, 
make the changes and/or additions, and then ﬁnish the group.
Figure 11.38 
Edit Group mode

CREATING AND USING GROUPS | 429
Creating New Groups
Sometimes the easiest way to make a new group is to copy and modify an old one. A quick way 
to do this is to right-click the name of the group you want to duplicate in the Project Browser 
and choose Duplicate from the context menu, as shown in Figure 11.40. Complete this command 
and make sure the new group is named Group 2 in the Project Browser.
Figure 11.40 
Duplicating a group
Return to the plan view and select your group. Notice in the Type Selector that you can swap 
between groups in the same way you can swap between types within a family. Choose Group 2 
in the Type Selector so you have one of each group type on the screen.
With Group 2 still selected, click Edit Group from the contextual tab in the ribbon. Edit it by 
making it 13′-6″ square (4 m), as shown in Figure 11.41; then ﬁnish the group.
Figure 11.41 
Modifying 
the second 
group type
Groups have insertion points that you need to consider before you exchange one group for 
another. When you create a group, the insertion point is initially at the geometric center of all 
the elements in the group. The group’s origin is also identiﬁed by x- and y-coordinates.
Keep in mind that as you edit the group, the insertion point does not move until you delib-
erately relocate it. This can be seen in Figure 11.42; editing the geometry for Group 2 retains the 
same insertion point that was active when the group was initially created. Even though we have 
modiﬁed the group, the insertion point remains where it was originally when the group was cre-
ated. (When editing this group, the left wall was moved to the right and the top wall was moved 
down to achieve the dimensions.)

430 | CHAPTER 11 WORKING WITH PHASING, GROUPS, AND DESIGN OPTIONS  
Figure 11.42 
Insertion points in 
diﬀerent groups
Moving the insertion point is an easy matter of dragging (and, if necessary, rotating) the 
Insertion Point icon to a common location before swapping one group for another (Figure 11.43). 
Drag the insertion points for both Group 1 and Group 2 to the inside face of the walls at the 
lower-left corner.
Figure 11.43 
Relocating insertion 
points
Once you have adjusted the insertion points of multiple similar groups, swapping groups will 
occur at the same relative location. Figure 11.44 illustrates Group 1 being swapped for Group 2, and 
vice versa, but common insertion points are maintained. Select the instance of Group 1 in the 
ﬂoor plan and choose Group 2 from the Type Selector.
Figure 11.44 
Exchanged groups

CREATING AND USING GROUPS | 431
Excluding Elements within Groups
There will be occasions where everything in a group works great and it works throughout the 
project—except for that one particular case where a condition is slightly different. This is deftly 
handled by excluding individual elements from groups. The original group deﬁnitions remain 
intact, and schedules are aware of excluded elements. Figure 11.45 shows an example of this in 
practice. We have created another instance of Group 1; however, there is a column right in the 
middle of the door.
Figure 11.45 
A column location 
conﬂicts with the door 
in our sample group.
We do not want to destroy the integrity of the group and give up being able to quickly 
modify similar elements, but we also cannot advance the design with the column located where 
it is shown. To resolve this, hover the mouse pointer over the door within the group and then 
press the Tab key until the door is highlighted, right-click it, and select Create Similar from the 
context menu. This will allow you to place a new door in a better location. This door will not be 
part of the group. In Figure 11.46, the new door has been placed above the grouped door, and its 
swing direction has been ﬂipped.
Now you can exclude the door that conﬂicts with the column as an exception to the original 
group deﬁnition. This process can be a bit confusing at ﬁrst because you do not need to enter 
Group Edit mode to exclude members from groups. Simply hover the mouse pointer over the 
door and press the Tab key until the door is highlighted. Select the door, as shown in Figure 11.47.
Once the door in the group is selected, you will notice an icon pointing to the door. Clicking 
this icon will allow you to exclude the door as an exception to the group. The icon will change 
and show a red hash through it. This means the element is now excluded and will automatically 
be deleted when you deselect the group. The wall will heal itself as if the door were never there.

How can you tell whether a given group has elements that have been excluded? Selecting 
the group will reveal any hidden elements in the group that are excluded (Figure 11.48). Just tab 
through to select the hidden door to include the component back into the group.

CREATING AND USING GROUPS | 433
Saving and Loading Groups
Just as you would not want your family components locked up inside a project ﬁle, there are 
good reasons to keep commonly used groups outside your project. You might even want to keep 
them in a folder just as you do your custom content so you can use them again on similar proj-
ects or as part of your ofﬁce’s library. You can do so by saving groups outside your projects.
Saving groups is a simple matter of right-clicking the group name in your Project Browser 
and selecting Save Group (Figure 11.49).
Figure 11.49 
Saving groups from the 
Project Browser
You will then be prompted to save the group as an RVT ﬁle. You can open this ﬁle as you 
would any other RVT ﬁle if you would like to modify it later and then reload the group into the 
project in order to update all the instances. To load an external group into a project, go to the 
Insert tab in the ribbon. On the Load From Library panel, choose Load As Group.
Be aware that when you load the group in a project, if the group name already exists, you 
will be given a warning. You can overwrite the existing group (by selecting Yes) or load with the 
option to rename the group that is being loaded (by selecting No). Or you can cancel the opera-
tion altogether (Figure 11.50).
Figure 11.50 
Loading groups with 
the same name

434 | CHAPTER 11 WORKING WITH PHASING, GROUPS, AND DESIGN OPTIONS  
As a feature when loading groups, Revit remembers to exclude previously excluded elements 
from the group that were modiﬁed in another session. Figure 11.51 shows that a desk and chair 
have been added to Group 1 in the RVT ﬁle saved from the original group. The group has been 
reloaded, overwriting the original group, but the exclusions remain intact.
Figure 11.51 
Retaining excluded 
group elements
Creating Groups from Links
Groups are also RVT ﬁles, and as such, they can be linked into the project environment. 
Although you cannot edit a link in place (as with a group), there are some excellent reasons why 
you might want to start a group as a link and then bind the link at a later time. Binding a linked 
project will convert it to a group. Groups and links can also exist within design options (more 
on design options later in this chapter). To follow this workﬂow, use these steps:
1. From the Insert tab in the ribbon, choose Link Revit from the Link panel (Figure 11.52).
Figure 11.52 
Use the Link Revit 
command to add 
groups as links.
2. Browse to the group you just exported and click Open.
After the link has been placed, you can copy it throughout your project as you would any 
other element in Revit. Keep in mind that all the functionality between groups and nongrouped 
elements will not behave the same in links as it does throughout the rest of your project. For 
example, in Figure 11.53, the upper-right collection of walls and furniture is a link, not a group. 
As a result, walls are not cleaning up between linked models and groups in the same way they 
are between groups and other walls in the project.

CREATING AND USING GROUPS | 435
Figure 11.53 
Walls do not join to 
linked models.
This graphic restriction may not be a concern during early stages of design, when links allow 
for a lot of rapid ﬂexibility. After you have resolved your design using linked models, you can 
bind them into the project environment by selecting each link in a view and clicking Bind Link 
from the contextual tab in the ribbon. When binding, make sure you select all instances of that 
link. Links bound will also revert any modiﬁed version to the original. This can be avoided by 
binding modiﬁed groups with other names.
Rather than explode the linked model into separate and unrelated elements, Revit converts 
the link to a group. Once this happens, walls easily join across groups, as shown in Figure 11.54.
Figure 11.54 
Wall joins are resolved 
when linked models are 
bound in the current 
project.

436 | CHAPTER 11 WORKING WITH PHASING, GROUPS, AND DESIGN OPTIONS  
Using Best Practices for Groups
So far, you have learned that groups can help you maintain consistency among repeated ele-
ments and will facilitate additional design iteration; however, there are some important excep-
tions that you will want to note. Nearly every time a problem crops up with groups, it is the 
result of ignoring one of the following best practices:
Do not put datum objects in your group.  Avoid putting datum objects (levels and grids) 
inside your group. You cannot manage the extents of the datum objects unless you are in Edit 
Group mode, which can create conﬂicts elsewhere in your project. Of course, you will have 
the option to not include the datum objects when you bind your link. Again, doing so does 
not necessarily create a technical hurdle, but it can create a lot of confusion. Situations arise 
where duplicate levels were deleted and sometimes those levels were hosting content in the 
project.
Do not nest groups.  In other words, avoid creating groups within other groups. Although 
nesting can save time in some situations when the design is preliminary and your team is 
trying to distribute content and design ideas quickly, you will likely ﬁnd a point of diminish-
ing returns as the design evolves. You cannot get to all the features and functionality of Revit 
when you are in Edit Group mode. And if you are nested deep into groups and trying to 
modify project properties, you will quickly get frustrated digging in, out, and across nested 
groups to go back and forth between your group and the project.
Group hosted elements and their hosts together.  Always keep your hosted elements 
and hosts together. For example, do not group doors and windows without the walls that 
are hosting them. If any of the windows in a group become unhosted from walls and then 
deleted, this will delete the respective windows in all other group instances—even if they are 
properly hosted.
Do not use attached relationships in groups.  The top constraints of walls are commonly 
attached to levels or other hosts such as ﬂoors and roofs, but these relationships should be 
avoided in groups. If you manipulate the datum or attached host and the relationship creates 
inconsistent conditions among the instances of the group, you will see a warning asking you 
to ﬁx the groups (Figure 11.55).
Figure 11.55 
Avoid attaching with 
groups.
Fixing the group really does not ﬁx the group. It actually explodes it or creates a new group 
that is no longer referenced to the ﬁrst group (Figure 11.56).

MAKING DESIGN OPTIONS FOR DESIGN ITERATION | 437
Figure 11.56 
Resolving attachments 
warning
Do not mirror groups.  Finally, and maybe most important, do not mirror groups. Instead, 
it is better to create left and right versions. Does mirroring work in concept? Yes. Does it work 
in the real world? Not really.
Think about it. You would love to be able to mirror that prototype coffee shop, right? Mirror 
the coffee shop—and all the equipment in the group—and now the baristas are foaming 
milk on the right rather than the left. This might look great in a rendering, but it does not 
make sense for the company that manufactures the espresso machines.
And now the display cases have power supplies on the wrong side. The cash register has 
keys on the wrong side. The desk in the manager’s ofﬁce now has drawers on the left and ﬁl-
ing cabinets on the right. To make matters worse, the sink in the bathroom now has hot water 
coming from the wrong faucet. Again, it makes all the conceptual sense in the world to be 
able to mirror a building—and a group. But trying to make it work can cost a lot of time and 
money. And this is just a coffee shop. If you think it is a good idea to mirror a hospital room 
or a surgical theater or some other mission-critical building or civil construct, well, it could 
end badly. Or you will have to work very, very late to resolve the issues.
If you would like to download the ﬁle that has been created during the examples, you can ﬁnd 
it in the Chapter 11 folder on the book’s web page; the ﬁle is called c11-Groups-Finished.rvt.
Making Design Options for Design Iteration
Revit software provides a unique set of tools for developing multiple design iterations in the 
conﬁnes of a single-model environment. You can use these tools to explore alternative designs 
without the need to save multiple independent versions of your model as you move in different 
directions. You are free to investigate multiple roof conﬁgurations or different entry canopies 
or to explore various furniture, ofﬁce layouts, and stairs—quite literally anything that can be 
modeled. This functionality also allows you to create views that show each option so multiple 
designs can be compared.
Let’s begin by establishing a fundamental understanding of the workﬂow for design options. 
First, you have a main model, which includes all the elements you have learned how to model so 
far in this book. The main model can be thought of as a backdrop or stage on which different 
options are displayed. Elements in the main model are always visible by default, whereas design 

438 | CHAPTER 11 WORKING WITH PHASING, GROUPS, AND DESIGN OPTIONS  
options come and go, appearing and disappearing depending on which design option you’re 
editing or viewing. Put another way, the main model includes everything else that is not in the 
design options.
You begin to explore design options by ﬁrst creating a named option set—for example, 
Canopy Options. Within the option set, you then deﬁne options, the ﬁrst of which is the pri-
mary option. Each option can be named to help you identify the intent, such as Glass Canopy 
and Steel Canopy. From here, you need to either select elements you have already modeled and 
add them to the appropriate design options or edit each option and create the elements with the 
Design Options tool active. Either way, the primary option in each option set will be displayed 
throughout your project by default. You can make as many options as you need—there is no 
limit.
The last part of conﬁguring design options is to create some additional views in which to 
compare the ideas. As soon as you start creating design options in a project, the Design Options 
tab is added to the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box. In this interface, you can select a 
speciﬁc option to be displayed for any of the option sets in the project. You can then present 
them to a client, to the project architect, or to other stakeholders in the design process. At any 
time, you may set any other option as the primary option. This will affect any views that are 
displaying the default option.
When an option within a set is ﬁnalized, you can accept the primary design solution and add 
it back to the main model. Doing so deletes all elements in the other options within the option 
set and merges your accepted option back into the main model.
Creating Design Options
Let’s now explore the use of design options with a simple exercise. Download and open the ﬁle 
c11-DesignOptions-Start.rvt or c11-DesignOptions-Start-Metric.rvt from this book’s 
web page. The sample ﬁles have a simple layout of walls, as shown in Figure 11.57.
Figure 11.57 
Create a simple layout 
of walls to begin study-
ing design options
Starting in the Level 1 view, you are going to conﬁgure this simple space into a design option 
that divides the space vertically in one option and horizontally in the other. Follow these steps:
1. From the Manage tab in the ribbon, locate the Design Options panel (Figure 11.58) and 
then click the Design Options button.

MAKING DESIGN OPTIONS FOR DESIGN ITERATION | 439
Figure 11.58 
Launching the Design 
Options tool
You can also access the Design Options tool from the status bar at the bottom of the appli-
cation window.
2. In the Design Options dialog box, click New in the Option Set area to create a new option 
set. This will automatically create one design option within the set.
3. Click New in the Option area of the dialog box to create an Option 2 option, as shown in 
Figure 11.59. Click Close to dismiss the dialog box.
Figure 11.59 
Creating an option set 
and two options
Now that you have started creating design options, everything in the project is consid-
ered the main model. You can start adding elements to one of the two options.
4. Select the center wall, which will immediately initiate the Modify | Walls contextual tab 
in the ribbon.
With the wall segment selected, you can ﬁnd the Add To Set button in either the Manage 
tab in the ribbon or the Design Options toolbar in the status bar (Figure 11.60).

440 | CHAPTER 11 WORKING WITH PHASING, GROUPS, AND DESIGN OPTIONS  
Figure 11.60 
Using the Add To Set 
tool on the Design 
Options panel
5. In the Add To Design Option Set dialog box, add the wall to Option 1 but not Option 2, as 
shown in Figure 11.61.
Figure 11.61 
Adding elements to 
option sets
Note that when the elements are added to the option set, you immediately lose the ability 
to select them within the main model. This is because an option called Exclude Options in the 
status bar is checked by default. The purpose of this option is to support a workﬂow in which 
design options are explicitly edited. Otherwise, it is assumed you are working exclusively on 
other parts of the building design. Of course, you can disable this option at any time by dese-
lecting the check box in the status bar.
Editing Design Options
Selecting a design option to edit allows you to enter a special mode called Edit Option mode. 
In this mode, you can add elements you have already created in the main model or create them 
from within the option set. Visible elements in the Main Model that are not inside this option set 
turn light gray, indicating that they are not editable.
Entering Edit Option mode is quite easy. From the drop-down list in the Design Options 
toolbar or from the Design Options panel in the Manage tab, select the option you want to begin 
editing (Figure 11.62). In our example, we chose Option 2.
Figure 11.62 
Accessing Edit 
Option mode

MAKING DESIGN OPTIONS FOR DESIGN ITERATION | 441
Once you have entered Edit Option mode, you will notice that the wall you added to Option 1  
is not visible. Add one horizontal wall dividing the space, as shown in Figure 11.63. Note that 
anything else you add to the project while in Edit Option mode will be assigned to that design 
option. You can also modify or delete any elements in the selected option in this mode.
Figure 11.63 
Adding a wall in Edit 
Option mode
To exit Edit Option mode, return to the Design Options drop-down list and select Main 
Model. Remember that only the primary option will appear by default; therefore, when you 
ﬁnish adding the horizontal wall to Option 2 and you return to the main model, the horizontal 
wall will disappear and the vertical wall will reappear. In the next section, you will learn how 
to control the visibility of design options.
Viewing and Scheduling Design Options
You will notice that whenever you switch between Option 1 and Option 2, the view automati-
cally changes to show the option that you have selected. Initiating design options automatically 
creates a new tab in the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box. By default, a design option’s 
display shows as <Automatic> (Figure 11.64). This means the Primary design option (in this 
case, Option 1) will be shown in the view.
Figure 11.64 
Te Design Options 
tab displays 
<Automatic>.
The Design Options tab is available for any view, even for schedules. Selecting the Visibility/
Graphic settings in the view properties of a schedule ﬁlters the schedule according to the 
desired design option.
If you want to specify or lock a view to a particular design option, open the Visibility/
Graphic Overrides dialog box and select the Design Options tab. From the drop-down list, 
change the setting from <Automatic> to one of the design options (Figure 11.65).

442 | CHAPTER 11 WORKING WITH PHASING, GROUPS, AND DESIGN OPTIONS  
Figure 11.65 
Locking the view to a 
design option
For working views, it is ﬁne to leave the view properties set to <Automatic> so that the 
view switches to actively show the primary design option; however, using the Visibility/
Graphic settings can be particularly useful for views that are being placed on sheets. To 
show multiple design options on one sheet, simply duplicate any relevant views and use the 
Visibility/Graphic settings to set a speciﬁc design option for each view. One of the compelling 
visualization techniques using this feature is perspective. You can quickly and easily show a 
variety of design options all from the same vantage point within the model by simply creat-
ing a perspective view, duplicating it, and setting the relevant design option in the Visibility/
Graphic settings. Creating a system for naming options and option sets will help you organize 
them effectively.
Removing Design Options and Option Sets
As your project progresses, it may become necessary to delete an option set, accept the pri-
mary design option, or delete a single design option. Although some of these methods might 
yield similar outcomes, there are important differences. Remember that you can create an 
unlimited number of option sets and any number of individual options within each set. 
Maintaining too many design options may have adverse performance effects on your project 
ﬁle, so you should be conscious of the status of all design options. As always, each option set 
should be named appropriately so that your project team can understand the intended use of 
each study.
Accepting the Primary Design Option
The most common outcome of a design option study is to accept one option and delete the 
remaining ones. The Design Option tools are built to support this workﬂow quite effectively.
To accept the primary design option, open the Design Options dialog box from the 
Manage tab or the status bar. Select the associated option set from the list. Make sure the 
option you want to keep is the primary option. If it is not, select that option; then click the 
Make Primary button. Once that is complete, click the Accept Primary button, as shown in 
Figure 11.66.
When you accept the primary option in an option set, the geometry associated with the 
primary option is integrated into the main model. Any geometry on other options within the 
selected option set is deleted.
You will proceed through a series of warnings and conﬁrmations before completing the 
process. If any views are speciﬁcally assigned to display the options being deleted, you will 
have the option to delete or retain such views (Figure 11.67). This is a good way to keep your 
project ﬁle clean and free from extraneous views related to the rapid iteration process of 
design options.

Preserving Your Design Iterations
In our experience, we have heard many stories about vast amounts of eﬀort that have been wiped 
out when various actions are taken in a Revit model, usually for the sake of improving performance. 
One classic scenario is when several design options are created and only one is moved forward after 
certain project milestones. If you use the Design Options tool, be sure to create an archive copy 
of your project model before you activate potentially destructive commands such as accepting the 
primary design option or deleting an option set.

444 | CHAPTER 11 WORKING WITH PHASING, GROUPS, AND DESIGN OPTIONS  
Deleting an Option Set
Do not confuse the ability to completely delete an option set with the ability to accept the pri-
mary option and delete all other options within the set. If you delete an option set, all options 
within the set are deleted. This workﬂow is less common because you usually study options for 
some element of your design that will need to be included in one form or another. Sometimes 
you may just need to study a potential addition to the scope of your project and it does not get 
accepted. This is where it is useful to completely delete an option set.
To delete an option set, return to the Design Options dialog box and select an option set. 
Click the Delete button in the Option Set area, as shown in Figure 11.68. As in the previous exer-
cise, you will be prompted with a series of warnings and conﬁrmations because of the content 
you are about to permanently delete from your project.
Figure 11.68 
Deleting an option set
Deleting an Individual Option
Another common workﬂow in the iteration of design is to delete just one of the options within 
an option set. This may occur for various reasons, but let’s say you did not want to continue 
exploring the option for all enclosed ofﬁces in the furniture layout for the ﬁrst ﬂoor of your  
project. In Figure 11.69, we have the Design Options dialog box open and the All Enclosed 
option selected within the 1st Floor Furniture option set. From here, you would click the 
Delete button in the Option area, as shown in the ﬁgure.
You cannot delete the primary option in an option set. Some other option must be assigned 
as the primary option before you can delete the original primary option. To make an option 
the primary option, open the Design Options dialog box, select an option, and click the Make 
Primary button.

Combining Phasing, Groups, and Design Options
Now it is time to bring it all together—phasing, groups, and design options. In this exercise, 
we’re going to create a tenant-ﬁnish package in two phases. The ﬁrst phase will start construc-
tion on one side of the space, and then we will turn to the other side of the space to complete the 
renovation. We will also rely on groups for collections of components. Finally, we will create a 
design option for the second space. Ultimately, you need to visualize the exercise in plan, per-
spective, and schedule.
Download the c11-Exercise-Start.rvt ﬁle from this book’s web page to get started. Before 
you start this exercise, remember that this model will be the existing condition. So, rather than 
create the existing walls and then change their phase, let’s start by duplicating a view and 
changing the phase of that view so that the walls and other content are displayed as existing.
1. In the Project Browser, duplicate the Level 1 ﬂoor plan and name the duplicated view 
LEVEL 1 - EXISTING.
2. Activate the LEVEL 1 - EXISTING view, and in the Properties palette make sure the phase 
is set to Existing. Leave the phase ﬁlter set to Show All for now.
Figure 11.70 shows the ﬁnished existing plan.
As you can see, the ﬁnished existing space is really two areas. In this scenario, the tenant in 
the lower-left space is expanding and will be taking over the upper space. The idea is that we 
are going to demolish the space in stages. We do not want to upset the existing tenants to com-
plete the phased work.

446 | CHAPTER 11 WORKING WITH PHASING, GROUPS, AND DESIGN OPTIONS  
Figure 11.70 
Te existing ﬂoor plan
Phase 1: Demolition
In the ﬁrst phase of our exercise project, we will indicate some of the existing walls to be demol-
ished. You do not want to demolish them in the existing Level 1 ﬂoor plan view because the 
demolition should take place at the start of the New Construction phase. That said, there will 
be two construction phases (so there will also be two demolition phases). Create the new phases 
and associated plans by following these steps:
1. From the Manage tab in the ribbon, click Phases. In the Phasing dialog box, rename the 
New Construction phase to New Construction - Phase 1. Click the After button and cre-
ate a new phase named New Construction - Phase 2 (Figure 11.71). Click OK to close the 
dialog box.
2. In the Project Browser, duplicate the Level 1 ﬂoor plan. Activate the duplicated view, and 
in the Properties palette set the following values:
 
◆
View Name: LEVEL 1 - PHASE 1 - DEMOLITION
 
◆
Phase: New Construction - Phase 1
 
◆
Phase Filter: Show Previous + Demo

COMBINING PHASING, GROUPS, AND DESIGN OPTIONS | 447
3. Duplicate the default 3D view, listed in the Project Browser as {3D}. Activate the dupli-
cated view, and in the Properties palette set the following values:
 
◆
View Name: PHASE 1 - DEMOLITION
 
◆
Phase: New Construction - Phase 1
 
◆
Phase Filter: Show Previous + Demo
You’ll notice in the demolition plan that the graphic override for existing walls has been 
set to include a gray solid ﬁll. This will help to distinguish the existing, new, and demol-
ished walls. In the 3D view, existing elements are shown as transparent green to also aid 
in the visualization of the phases.
4. Demolish the walls as shown in Figure 11.72 using the Demolish tool (the small hammer) 
on the Geometry panel of the Modify tab.
Figure 11.71 
Create two new con-
struction phases.
Figure 11.72

You do not have to demolish the doors if you ﬁrst demolish the walls that host them.

448 | CHAPTER 11 WORKING WITH PHASING, GROUPS, AND DESIGN OPTIONS  
Phase 1: Proposed
Now that you have created a demolition plan for Phase 1 and have demolished the interior parti-
tions for that area, we will need to create another plan view in which you will create a new lay-
out. Follow these steps to continue the exercise:
1. Duplicate the Level 1 ﬂoor plan, and in the Properties palette set the following values:
 
◆
View Name: LEVEL 1 - PHASE 1 PROPOSED
 
◆
Phase: New Construction - Phase 1
 
◆
Phase Filter: Show Previous + New
2. Duplicate the default 3D view, listed in the Project Browser as {3D}, and in the Properties 
palette set the following values:
 
◆
View Name: PHASE 1 - PROPOSED
 
◆
Phase: New Construction - Phase 1
 
◆
Phase Filter: Show Previous + New
3. In the LEVEL 1 - PHASE 1 - PROPOSED plan view, you will add the new elements, as 
shown in Figure 11.73. First, add segments of Curtain Wall: Storefront to the existing 
walls in the room shown at the lower left of Figure 11.73.
Figure 11.73 
Phase 1 proposed 
layout
Because the new storefront is proposed and the interior walls exist, this action will auto-
matically demolish the openings necessary to accommodate the new wall type.
4. Using the furniture families already loaded in the project, add furniture to the proposed 
space, as shown in Figure 11.73.
You will add a reception area and other ofﬁce furniture. Add desks, tables, shelving, and 
chairs.
5. Add workstation and chair components to the open ofﬁce area to the right of the Phase 1 
area, but group the assembly before you start copying through the ofﬁce space.

COMBINING PHASING, GROUPS, AND DESIGN OPTIONS | 449
Use your own judgment and creativity in laying out the new elements in the space. The aim 
of this exercise is to become familiar with phasing and grouping. Figure 11.74 illustrates the 
space in a perspective view. Note that the demolished walls are not being shown.
Figure 11.74 
Phase 1 proposed lay-
out in perspective view
Phase 2: Demolition
Now that we have created a new layout for the ﬁrst phase of our renovations, we will create sim-
ilar views for the second phase. In addition to some selective demolition, we will add a design 
option set to explore two different ideas for the second phase. Follow these steps to get started:
1. Duplicate the plan view LEVEL 1 - PHASE 1 DEMOLITION, and in the Properties palette 
set the following values:
 
◆
View Name: LEVEL 1 - PHASE 2 DEMOLITION
 
◆
Phase: New Construction - Phase 2
 
◆
Phase Filter: Show Previous + Demo

450 | CHAPTER 11 WORKING WITH PHASING, GROUPS, AND DESIGN OPTIONS  
2. Duplicate the 3D view PHASE 1 - DEMOLITION. Activate the duplicated view, and in the 
Properties palette set the following values:
 
◆
View Name: PHASE 2 - DEMOLITION
 
◆
Phase: New Construction − Phase 2
 
◆
Phase Filter: Show Previous + Demo
3. Demolish the existing walls shown as dashed lines in Figure 11.75 using the demolition 
tool (the small hammer) from the Modify tab in the ribbon. Note that you will need to 
split the long wall between Phase 1 Proposed and Phase 2 Proposed in order to allow 
only a portion of the wall to be demolished.
Figure 11.75 
Demolished walls for 
Phase 2
4. Return to the 3D view named PHASE 2 - DEMOLITION and your view should be similar 
to the image shown in Figure 11.76. Do not be confused by the proposed content from 
New Construction - Phase 1 showing as existing. This is correct because that content is 
now considered existing when seen through the lens of New Construction - Phase 2.

COMBINING PHASING, GROUPS, AND DESIGN OPTIONS | 451

Phase 2: Proposed
In the ﬁnal steps of our exercise project, we will create two different layouts for the client to 
review. We will generate a design option set and views that will speciﬁcally show the alternate 
option.
1. Duplicate the plan view LEVEL 1 - PHASE 1 PROPOSED and rename it LEVEL 1 - 
PHASE 2 PROPOSED. Set the Phase to New Construction - Phase 2.
2. Start working in your new plan view, adding proposed elements for the primary design 
layout, as shown in Figure 11.77.
Figure 11.77

the primary option in 
Phase 2

452 | CHAPTER 11 WORKING WITH PHASING, GROUPS, AND DESIGN OPTIONS  
Do not worry about getting the design right—just get the idea right.
Just remember, adding elements in the view with the appropriate Phase and Phase Filter 
settings is the easiest way to avoid confusion. Figure 11.78 shows a perspective of the ﬁrst 
 proposed layout.

Scheduling
Now let’s create a schedule for walls that we will use to provide a volume-based cost for demoli-
tion in each phase of the proposed work.
First, you will need to create a phase ﬁlter to show only demolished elements. After you cre-
ate the new phase ﬁlter, you can apply it to any ﬂoor plan or 3D view to verify what the ﬁlter 
will display. The same elements will be displayed in a schedule. To create the phase ﬁlter and 
the wall demolition schedules, follow these steps:
1. From the Manage tab in the ribbon, click Phases. In the Phasing dialog box, switch to the 
Phase Filters tab. Click the New button and name the new ﬁlter Demo Only. Set the New 
and Existing column values in the table to Not Displayed and then click OK to close the 
dialog box.
2. Switch to the View tab in the ribbon, and from the Create panel choose Schedules ➣ 
Schedules/Quantities. In the New Schedule dialog box, set the following values and then 
click OK:
 
◆
Category: Walls
 
◆
Name: Wall Demo Schedule - Phase 1
 
◆
Phase: New Construction - Phase 1

COMBINING PHASING, GROUPS, AND DESIGN OPTIONS | 453
3. In the Schedule Properties dialog box, make sure you are in the Fields tab. Add the 
parameters Type and Volume to the Scheduled Fields list, as shown in Figure 11.79.
Figure 11.79 
Add Type and Volume 
to the list of scheduled 
ﬁelds.
4. Click the Add Parameter button, and in the Parameter Properties dialog box set the fol-
lowing values:
 
◆
Parameter Type: Project Parameter
 
◆
Name: Cost Per CF
 
◆
Type Or Instance: Type
 
◆
Type Of Parameter: Currency
 
◆
Group Parameter Under: Construction
5. Click OK to close the Parameter Properties dialog box and then click the Calculated Value 
button in the Schedule Properties dialog box. Create a new calculated value with the 
following values. You will need to add a calculated value in order to multiply the demol-
ished walls’ volume by the cost per unit and get the total. Click the Calculated Value but-
ton in the Schedule Properties dialog box. We have divided the Volume value by 1 CF to 
keep the units consistent.
 
◆
Name: Disposal Cost
 
◆
Formula or Percentage: Formula
 
◆
Type: Currency
 
◆
Formula: Volume / 1 CF * Cost Per CF

454 | CHAPTER 11 WORKING WITH PHASING, GROUPS, AND DESIGN OPTIONS  
In this formula, it is important that the spelling of each parameter be exact because it is 
case sensitive. We divided by 1 unit (cubic feet in this example) to eliminate the volu-
metric units in the equation. The result will be a number that is multiplied by the value 
assigned to the Demo Cost Per Unit parameter.
6. Click OK to close the Calculated Value dialog box and then switch to the Sorting/
Grouping tab. Establish the settings to sort by Type (with the Header option) and then by 
Volume, as shown in Figure 11.80. Check the box for Grand Totals, and set the associated 
drop-down list to Totals Only. Deselect the Itemize Every Instance option.
Figure 11.80 
Set the Sorting/
Grouping options 
for the demolition 
schedule.
7. Switch to the Formatting tab and select Disposal Cost. Select Calculate Totals in the 
Calculations drop-down menu and then click OK to create the schedule.
8. In the Properties palette, set Phase to New Construction - Phase 1 and Phase Filter to 
Demo Only. After you type a value in any of the Demo Cost Per Unit ﬁelds, the schedule 
will look similar to Figure 11.81.
9. For the Phase 2 demolition schedule, do not start over. In the Project Browser, duplicate 
the previously created schedule and just change the phase in the Properties palette to 
New Construction - Phase 2.

At this point in the exercise, you can drag the ﬂoor plan views, 3D views, and schedules from 
the Project Browser onto sheets for publishing, as shown in Figure 11.82. We will cover sheets in 
greater detail in Chapter 18, “Documenting Your Design,” but for now you can begin to become 
familiar with the process. Add the plans, 3D views, and schedule for Phase 1 to sheet A101 and 
then add the views for Phase 2 to sheet A102.

456 | CHAPTER 11 WORKING WITH PHASING, GROUPS, AND DESIGN OPTIONS  
Using the Design Option Tool
Everything looks great so far, but our client has asked us to prepare an alternative design for the 
second phase of construction. We will accomplish this within the same exercise ﬁle using the 
Design Option tool. Let’s get started with the following steps:
1. From the status bar at the bottom of the application window, click the Design Options 
icon. In the Design Options dialog box, click the New button to create a new option set. 
Click the Rename button and name the new set Phase 2 - Proposed. Click the other New 
button to add two options, as shown in Figure 11.83.
Using a Phase Filter to Start Design Options
To isolate what you need to assign to Option 1, activate the Phase 2 ﬂoor plan, and then set the Phase 
Filter property to Show New. Tis will turn oﬀ any existing conditions from the previous phases.
Figure 11.83 
Create a new design 
option set with two 
options.
2. Activate the LEVEL 1 - PHASE 2 PROPOSED ﬂoor plan and then select all the new 
construction elements. Switch to the Manage tab in the ribbon, and click Add To Set. 
Uncheck Option 2, as shown in Figure 11.84, and click OK. This will add everything 
selected to the primary design option. If you changed the Phase Filter property to help 
select the new construction elements, remember to set it back to Show Previous + New.
Figure 11.84 
Add the primary design 
elements to only the 
ﬁrst design option.

3. In the Project Browser, duplicate LEVEL 1 - PHASE 2 PROPOSED and rename it LEVEL 
1 - PHASE 2 PROPOSED - OPTION 2.
This will be your working view for the second design option.
4. Open the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box and switch to the Design Options tab. 
Change the Design Option value for the design option set shown from <Automatic> to 
Option 2. Click OK to close the dialog box.
5. From the Design Options toolbar, select Option 2 in the drop-down list to make Option 2 
active for editing and create another design iteration, as shown in Figure 11.85. When 
you are ﬁnished with the alternate layout, set the Design Options drop-down list to 
Main Model.
Figure 11.85 
Create an alternate 
design layout.
6. In the Project Browser, duplicate the 3D view named PHASE 2 - PROPOSED and name 
the duplicated view PHASE 2 - PROPOSED - OPTION 2. In the Visibility/Graphic 
Overrides dialog box for the view, set Design Option to Option 2.
7. Activate sheet A102 and then drag and drop the views for Option 2 onto the sheet, as 
shown in Figure 11.86.
Selecting Elements in Design Options
You might notice that you cannot select model elements that have been added to design option 
sets. Tere is a setting in the status bar at the bottom of the application window called Exclude 
Options, which is checked by default. When you uncheck this setting, you can select elements that 
are assigned to design options.
If you want to download the completed ﬁle used for this exercise, you can ﬁnd it in the 
Chapter 11 folder at this book’s web page; the ﬁle is called c11-Exercise-Finished.rvt.

Te Bottom Line
Use the Phasing tools to create, demolish, and propose a new design.  Time is such an 
important element to the design process and nearly impossible to capture with traditional 
CAD tools. Do not use phasing for construction sequencing (there is a better way). Embrace 
phasing for communication, not just illustration.
Master It  How can you use phasing to communicate your design across a series of key 
stages? What kind of project is best suited to phasing?
Understand and use groups.  Groups are great for creating collections of both host and 
family component geometry. Just remember to apply best practices, and you will avoid a lot 
of common roadblocks. Individual model elements within groups will always appear prop-
erly in schedules, as you would expect. Finally, creating exceptions in groups allows you to 
make subtle changes without creating a new group.
Master It  Why should you not mirror groups?
Create and use design options.  Like groups, design options work great when you follow 
the rules. Design options are intended for design iteration that is bounded and well-deﬁned, 
not for putting multiple buildings in one project ﬁle. Remember that links, groups, and phas-
ing can exist within design options. Always keep hosted elements with their host when using 
design options.
Master It  Suppose you have a multistory tower. How could you show multiple design 
options for the entire vertical exterior enclosure?

 Chapter  12 
 Visualization 
 Visualization in Autodesk ® Revit ® software—as with any tool (even a pencil)—isn’t an exact 
science. It still requires a patient, aesthetic eye. The most important thing you can do to suc-
cessfully visualize your work starts with one thing: the ability to listen. That’s right—it’s your 
ears that make you a great artist! You need to be able to understand what your client is trying to 
accomplish because you’re not really trying to visualize something—you’re trying to communi-
cate something  for someone else . 
 In this chapter, you’ll learn to 
 
◆
 Create real-time and rendered analytic visualizations 
 
◆
Render emotive photorealistic visualizations 
 
◆
 Understand the importance of sequencing your visualization workﬂ ow 
 
◆
 Understand what virtual reality (VR) means to your practice 
 Explaining the Role of Visualization 
 We believe that anyone can use Revit to create compelling, emotive visualizations. What’s really 
great is that your visualizations are based on the same coordinated design information you’re 
using to document your project. But there are a few challenges. 
 
◆
 Creating emotive visualization is usually such a small part of your project’s overall work-
ﬂ ow that it’s hard to spend the time necessary to hone your rendering skills. This is the 
reason that photorealistic renderings, both still and moving images and most recently with 
the advent of virtual reality (VR), are often the realm of a specialist who deeply under-
stands the techniques and workﬂ ow needed to create compelling imagery. 
 
◆
 The reality is that visualization is both art and science, but especially art. Though today there 
is technology that allows you to push a button and get a beautiful image, it’s still not an easy 
task because it involves comprehensive planning and an adherence to rigid workﬂ ows. But 
even with the advent of new technologies that make visualization more compelling, there’s 
a world of difference between getting something that’s photorealistic and something that’s 
emotive and compelling. In other words, the button says Render, not Make Beautiful. 
 
◆
   Most important, visualization is about communication, something that many people forget to 
take into account. Don’t ever create a rendering until you know what you’re trying to accom-
plish. You must know your audience and understand what needs to be communicated (keep-
ing in mind that the person requesting the rendering isn’t always the intended audience). 
Otherwise, you’ll spend hours doing something that is beautiful but entirely irrelevant.

460 | CHAPTER 12 VISUALIZATION
You’ll likely struggle with two important points about rendering in Revit, and unfortunately 
there’s little you can do about it, because the two are in tension with each other.
 
◆
Although engineers often analyze in order to design, architects often visualize in order to 
design. But if your intent is to put all of this visual iteration into Revit just to render it, you’ll 
probably get frustrated over all the entourage you’re putting into a database that you want to 
keep light and ﬂexible (particularly during early design). The reality is that Revit is most useful 
during early design to communicate analytic rather than visually representative information.
 
◆
You’ll never be able to render out of Revit more than you put into it. The level of detail 
required to create deeply emotive and detailed visualizations is usually far greater than 
the level of detail necessary to produce accurate construction documentation.
Even though Revit has the ability to help you create great renderings, the level of detail 
required at the beginning of a project (when analytical relationships are still being resolved) is 
too high for schematic design. Even when the project is well resolved and established, the level 
of detail required for a highly ﬁnished and photorealistic visualization is far beyond what’s 
required to complete your project documentation. So, what is the point of this chapter?
Our focus is to get you somewhere in the middle. You need to understand how Revit works, 
but you also need to understand that although something is technically feasible, it may not be 
practical from a workﬂow standpoint. Our goal is to help you focus on communication, not just 
visualization for its own sake. So if you’re happy with visualizing your project at its current 
level of development (not too far ahead and not overly detailed), you’re going to have a lot of 
success rendering with Revit software.
Analytic vs. Photorealistic Visualization
Troughout this chapter we will refer to basic modes of visualization as analytic as compared to 
the more advanced modes we will refer to as photorealistic. Although photorealistic visualization is 
self-explanatory, analytic visualization is the most common form of communicating with 3D views 
in Revit. You will not achieve the true realism of a photorealistic rendering, but analytic views are 
active views of the model within which you can create or analyze the design. You can even create 
a camera view with analytic graphic settings to use as a cover sheet for your document set—and 
you’ll never need to remember to regenerate a rendering to update the cover image!
Before we begin to address the two types of visualization techniques in greater detail, let’s 
review the basic controls that are available to help you conﬁgure views for further visualization.
Understanding View Controls
In this section, we’ll describe the various visual styles that are available in the view control bar 
with regard to analytic visualization. Figure 12.1 shows the view control bar of an orthographic 
view and that of a perspective view.
Figure 12.1 
2D and orthographic 
view control bar and 
perspective view 
control bar

UNDERSTANDING VIEW CONTROLS | 461
All the icons in the view control bar refer to view properties that can also be set in the 
Properties palette. The view control bar simply gives you quicker access to the most commonly 
used settings. The ﬁrst control at the left of the view control bar is the view scale. Because 
 camera views are not scale speciﬁc, it simply lists the status as Perspective.
Setting the Detail Level
After the Scale setting, the next icon in the view control bar sets the detail level in the view 
(Figure 12.2). The Detail Level property can be set to Coarse, Medium, or Fine.
Figure 12.2 
Level of detail
When you create a new view, the default value for Detail Level is initially determined by 
the scale of the view, as shown by switching to the Manage tab in the ribbon and clicking 
Additional Settings ➣ Detail Level. Figure 12.3 shows the default settings.
Figure 12.3 
View Scale-To-Detail 
Level Correspondence 
window
Even though a default value is speciﬁed for a new view, the Detail Level setting can be over-
ridden after the view is created. This fact is important for two reasons. First, changing the scale 
after the view is created will not automatically reset the level of detail. Second, rendering a view 
with a ﬁner detail level will (generally speaking) take more time. Even though the results may 
not be visible to the naked eye, the calculations required to render what you won’t be able to 
 discern (because the objects are so small) will still be computed.

462 | CHAPTER 12 VISUALIZATION
When you consider this information, you will ﬁnd it’s important to render at the appropriate 
level of detail. To understand this, look at the two perspectives in Figure 12.4. Although these 
two views look identical, one will rotate, refresh, and render faster than the other because 
they’re set to different levels of detail.
Figure 12.4 
Nonidentical views
The view on the left is set to a Coarse level of detail, but the view on the right is set to a Fine 
level of detail. Although this different detail level doesn’t have much of an effect on the content 
in either view, the detail level affects performance.
The Executive Chair family has been modiﬁed so that the casters at the base of the chair dis-
play only at a Fine level of detail. Figure 12.5 shows the results.
Figure 12.5 
Detail level of chair
This difference may not have a large effect on a small project, yet it can have a signiﬁcant 
effect on your project when you render (not to mention the additional time it will take when you 
export and print). So, be sure that before you render a view, the level of detail is appropriately 
set. If you’re far away from the building or your view is broad, a Coarse detail level is sufﬁcient. 
But if you’re zoomed in on a particular detail or part of the building (or just a single ofﬁce or 
room), a Fine detail level might be more appropriate.
We discuss the use of detail level in Chapter 15, “Designing with the Family Editor,” where 
you will learn how to apply this property to your own content families.
Working with Graphic Display Options
The Graphic Display Options dialog box allows you to control all of your views’ graphic 
options (Figure 12.6). You can access the dialog box through the Properties palette by selecting 
Graphic Display Options (refer to Figure 12.7). These are the Model Display (which we’ve just 
reviewed) and the Shadows, Sketchy Lines, Depth Cueing, Lighting, Photographic Exposure, 

UNDERSTANDING VIEW CONTROLS | 463
and Background settings. This dialog box also allows you to save views as templates to quickly 
transfer the settings to other views. It’s important to understand how these settings impact the 
visualization in your view. Since we just stepped through the Model Display options, let’s go 
through the options in this dialog box to round out your understanding of how you can modify 
the view to get the desired effect in your renderings and visualizations.

Model Display
Model Display is the ﬁrst group of settings you will ﬁnd in the Graphic Display Options dialog 
box. In this group, you can deﬁne settings for the visual style, transparency of model elements, 
and silhouettes.
Likely one of the most commonly used settings, the visual style of your view can be deﬁned 
from one of six options. The available visual styles are shown in the context of the view control 
bar in Figure 12.7.
As we explore each of the visual styles, note that the Show Ambient Shadows setting is made 
available with the exception of the Wireframe view style (Figure 12.8), which maintains only the 
edges of objects with Faces hidden.
Figure 12.8 
Wireframe view style
The Hidden Line view style keeps both the edges and faces visible (Figure 12.9). This view 
style is used by default in 2D and 3D views.
The Shaded view style shows faces in their shaded value with accentuated edges (Figure 12.10). 
Note the change in color is dependent on an object’s orientation. This effect is particularly pro-
nounced on curved surfaces. In addition, if you have a material applied to an element and that 
material has a color and pattern associated with it, you’ll see those colors and patterns repre-
sented (like the brick at the bottom of the image). Glazing in this type of view appears clear.

The Consistent Colors view style removes the color variation based on an object’s orientation 
to the viewer. Colors are strict interpolations of the shaded color setting (the RGB value of the 
material assignment) and therefore have a ﬂatter yet more consistent appearance (Figure 12.11). 
The curved wall in the center of the image is stone, so it begins showing as a color that is differ-
ent from those of the other wall types.

The Realistic view style provides real-time overlays of geometry with the material that 
will be used during a photorealistic rendering, as shown in Figure 12.12. In both Shaded and 
Realistic view styles, you can turn off Show Edges in the Graphic Display Options dialog box, 
whereas this mode is always on for all other styles.

UNDERSTANDING VIEW CONTROLS | 467
The Interactive Ray Trace mode is available only in the view control bar and is listed as Ray 
Trace; it is not available in the Graphic Display Options dialog box. When you select this mode 
from the view control bar, the application will perform a quick render of the view window 
based on your current view settings (Figure 12.13). Based on your computer’s processor, it may 
take a bit of time to render the view, but once rendered, the view remains interactive—meaning you 
can continue to navigate within the view. As you do, the rendering will dynamically update. 
This view type is computationally intensive; if you’re working in this view, make sure you close 
other applications that might consume RAM or processor resources so the view is as quick and 
ﬂuid as possible.
Figure 12.13 
Interactive Ray  
Trace mode
One graphic setting in the Model Display options that’s not accessible in the view control 
bar is Transparency. This slider at the top of the Graphic Display Options dialog box allows 
you to make all the elements within the view transparent to an equal degree. In earlier versions 
of Revit, this was the Ghost Surfaces setting, but the percent of opacity/translucency was not 
modiﬁable. In Figure 12.14, the view has been set to 40 percent transparency with the Consistent 
Colors view style.
The Silhouettes option allows you to override the edges of objects in the view using your 
deﬁned line styles (Figure 12.15).
In Figure 12.16, the image on the left illustrates the view without silhouettes, and the image 
on the right shows the view with Wide Lines enabled.

Shadows
The Shadows toggle is available in the Graphic Display Options dialog box, but there’s also a 
toggle in the view control bar. With this button, there is no ﬂyout—simply select it to toggle 
shadows on and off based on sun settings we will discuss later in this chapter. The ability to 
turn shadows on in real time is a terriﬁc feature that helps you add an improved sense of depth 
to your view (Figure 12.17). Note that the Shadows toggle is not available if a Transparency over-
ride is applied.
Figure 12.17 
Default shadows on
Keep a couple of things in mind when turning on shadows. First, it takes a bit longer for the 
screen to refresh when shadows are turned on. Depending on the complexity of your view and 
the size of your model, you might want to keep shadows off in your working views as you zoom 
in, zoom out, and rotate.
Second, the default settings could use adjusting depending on how you like to have the view 
rendered. Sometimes it’s more valuable to show the space well-lit than to show an exact time of 
day for the sun position. To set the sun to an angle that is not dependent on a location and time, 
choose the Sun Setting button in the Lighting group of options. This button will report the cur-
rent preset (such as Sunlight from Top Right). Clicking this button will open the Sun Settings 
dialog box (Figure 12.18). Notice that the Lighting radio button is selected and an azimuth and 
altitude are speciﬁed as being relative to the view. This will show a sun angle regardless of the 
building’s orientation or location on the globe.

Figure 12.19 
Increased sun intensity 
setting
Back in the Graphic Display Options dialog box, you also have the ability to modify the 
intensity of the sun, ambient light, and shadows with the sliders (Figure 12.19). Changing these 
can dramatically change the amount of shade or shadow that appears in your view.
Another important visualization tool in the Shadows settings is the Show Ambient Shadows 
option. Combined with other graphic options such as edge enhancements and real-time materi-
als, this setting allows you to create emotive, real-time views of your project that do not require 
renderings.
To activate ambient light and shadows, open the Graphic Display Options dialog box, expand 
the Shadows settings, and then select Show Ambient Shadows.
The results are noticeable, particularly around the intersections of objects. Shaded elements 
are embellished by highlights in the center of objects and deeper shading at the edges. The 
result is almost a watercolor effect that considerably softens the shaded view. The effect can be 
accentuated when combined with the option to enhance the silhouette of edges for even more 
real-time effects. Figure 12.20 demonstrates the differences in effect between shadows with and 
without ambient shadows turned on.

Sketchy Lines
You can apply the Sketchy Lines feature as a graphic display style (Figure 12.21).
You can adjust settings for Jitter and Extension to create unique interpretations of any visual 
style, as shown in Figure 12.22.

Lighting
For most analytic view styles, only sunlight settings are available to cast shadows throughout 
your model. Lighting controls are fully enabled in the Graphic Display Options when Realistic 
mode is selected. We discuss the use of artiﬁcial lighting settings for photorealistic visualization 
later in this chapter. If you are using Hidden Line, Shaded, or Consistent Colors, you will have 
access only to the Sun Settings dialog box we discussed earlier.
Sunlight can be customized to reﬂect the location of your project at a speciﬁc date and time 
or a position relative to the view. We will discuss solar and shadow studies later in this section.
Photographic Exposure
Photographic Exposure allows you to control the color range within the view (Figure 12.23). This 
option is available only when your model display is set to Realistic.
Figure 12.23

settings

UNDERSTANDING VIEW CONTROLS | 473
Without this setting enabled, the Realistic view types tend to be rather dark. The Exposure 
has two radio buttons, Automatic and Manual. When Automatic is selected, the software picks 
the best possible combination within the settings. With Manual selected, you can adjust the 
Value slider; lower the Value slider to brighten the view. With either Automatic or Manual 
selected, you can access Color Correction to make further reﬁnements, which allows for the 
adjustment to Highlights, Shadows, Saturation, and White Point (Figure 12.24).

The ﬁnal settings in the Graphic Display Options dialog box are the Background options 
(Figure 12.25).
Figure 12.25 
Background settings
From the Background drop-down, you can choose Sky, Gradient, or Image. With the Gradient 
or Sky option, you can simulate a ground plane and horizon without rendering. This is a great 
feature if you’re presenting anything live within the model environment because it gives a 
visual plane for the building to sit on. Figure 12.26 shows the effect of the default Gradient set-
tings on the building section. This setting can also be used in elevation and 3D views.

474 | CHAPTER 12 VISUALIZATION
Depth Cueing
Depth Cueing is a feature that was added to Graphic Display Options in Revit 2017. Depth 
Cueing provides easy controls that can graphically adjust the 3D effect of an image viewed in 
section or elevation by illustrating objects in the front more vividly than objects in the back. In 
earlier versions of Revit, this illustration effect could be achieved only by selecting an object and 
applying a manual graphic override or utilizing the Linework tool from the Modify tab.
Though this option is listed in Graphic Display Options for any view, it can be activated only 
within an elevation or section view types. With an elevation or section open, from the Depth 
Cueing menu, with Show Depth selected, control sliders can be manipulated to adjust the effect 
of Depth Cueing (Figure 12.27).
Figure 12.27 
Default Depth Cueing 
settings applied to a 
section or elevation view
The Fade Start/End Location slider represents the overall clipping depth of a section or eleva-
tion. The default value of 0 in the Near setting represents the point in which the section or eleva-
tion cuts the model. The default value of 100 in the Far setting represents the maximum extent 
of the clipping plane for the section (Figure 12.28). Adjusting the values for Near and Far is the 
equivalent of inputting a percentage of the total distance for the clipping plane.
Figure 12.28

default Near and Far 
settings applied to a

The Fade Limit (%) slider applies the amount of fading from the Near, where objects are 
clearly displayed, which then fades to the speciﬁed percentage as it approaches the Far distance. 
The slider ranges from 0 to 100 where 0 denotes objects in the distance that are signiﬁcantly

grayed to 100 where the objects in the distance maintain the same graphic characteristics as set 
by the object styles. In Figure 12.29, section (a) represents a section with Depth Cueing off, and 
section (b) represents the same section with Depth Cueing set to Near = 10, Far = 100, and Fade 
Limit (%) = 5. Note the differences between the two sections and how section (b) denotes objects 
in the distance with increasing lighter shades of gray, with the furthest wall illustrated in the 
lightest shade of gray.

Working with the Section Box
Before we get into the rendering process, let’s discuss the section box. By selecting the Section 
Box option from the Properties palette for the view, you create a rectilinear matrix around your 
project that may be pushed and pulled to isolate a portion of your project within the view.
In Figure 12.30, the section box has been pulled to isolate a portion of the project. This tech-
nique is helpful for isolating a smaller portion of a larger project. But a word of warning: be 
careful toggling the section box off and on. The extents of the section box will reset and you’ll 
have to pull them back into place. That can be frustrating! If you want to see the whole project 
and the sectional view, it’s best to use two separate views.

476 | CHAPTER 12 VISUALIZATION
Figure 12.30 
Pulling the section box 
to isolate a portion of 
the project
After you activate a section box in a 3D view and you conﬁgure the box to intersect some 
model elements, you have another graphic tool to aid in your visualization. If the Detail Level 
option of the view is set to Coarse, model elements that are intersected by the section box will 
display a color and ﬁll override that can be customized as you see ﬁt. From the Properties pal-
ette for the view, select Edit Type. When you open the type properties, you’ll notice that there’s a 
Coarse Poche Material setting, which determines the color and ﬁll pattern of the poché.
The poché can be seen in all display types (Wireframe through Realistic), but it is displayed only 
in a view that is set to the Coarse level of detail. We recommend you set the default color to black.
Here’s why you would want the poché color to be black. As shown in Figure 12.31, the 
regions between host elements (like the walls and ﬂoors) are shown as discrete geometries. 
Notice that you can see black lines dividing the geometry where walls meet ﬂoors and so on.
Figure 12.31 
Regions between host 
elements are shown as 
discrete geometries.
You can use the Join Geometry option to clean up the lines between elements. But this 
approach is time-consuming and often leads to other problems in your ﬁle when a lot of things 
get “joined” just to create a graphic impression.

UNDERSTANDING ANALYTIC VISUALIZATION | 477
One simple way to clean this up graphically is to select a poché color that is the same as the 
color of the lines between elements: black. Again, it’s not the most desirable result, but it’s fast, 
doesn’t require manual joining of geometry, and reads well (Figure 12.32).
Figure 12.32

Understanding Analytic Visualization
Now that we have covered the basic view control tools, let’s get back to the two types of visu-
alization: analytic and photorealistic. To better understand the analytic concept, think for a 
moment about Google Maps and how it uses two types of visualization—there’s an option 
to view both Map and Satellite modes. Think of the Map mode as your analytic view and the 
Satellite mode as your photorealistic view. Both views are important, depending on what you’re 
trying to communicate. If you’re simply trying to understand directional information, the Map 
view is better. But if you’re trying to show someone what something looks like with regard to 
trees and other real-world features, the Satellite view has obvious advantages.
It’s also interesting that real-time information is easier to maintain in analytic views. For 
example, Google Maps has the option to show live trafﬁc data. But this doesn’t mean they’re 
showing actual cars moving on actual streets in photorealistic mode. Rather, they’re color- 
coding the streets based on overall trafﬁc patterns and movement.
The same is going to be true when you’re visualizing your project in Revit. More often than 
not, you’ll have the ability to show analytic information in real time; however, producing photo-
realistic images of your project will require additional time to render.
Even as you get into more of the project development and detail, materials may be a distrac-
tion, whereas textures may not. Keeping your materials abstract and analytic allows you to help 
keep your focus on communicating the big ideas of your project. For example, does the spatial 
arrangement elegantly fulﬁll the design requirements? How is the vertical/horizontal stacking? 
We’ll show you how to communicate these ideas in the following sections.
Project Parameters
Viewing information about your project in a variety of ways is easy, and one way to do this is 
with view ﬁlters. In this section, ﬁrst you’ll create a view ﬁlter based on a project parameter, and 
then you’ll create one to illustrate a user-deﬁned project parameter. A ﬁlter can be used to alter 
the default display properties of elements on a per-view basis. As you can see from the Filters 
dialog box in Figure 12.33, you can apply up to three ﬁlters to a single ﬁlter type to override the 
graphic values of 2D and 3D content as well as spaces.

478 | CHAPTER 12 VISUALIZATION
Figure 12.33 
Te Filters dialog box
Figure 12.34 shows a simple example of how this works. In the view, there are walls that are 
two-hour rated. You’d be able to see this in a schedule, but how would you see it in a project 
view (2D or 3D)? You can easily show that with ﬁlters.
Figure 12.34

UNDERSTANDING ANALYTIC VISUALIZATION | 479
Let’s now explore the use of ﬁlters with a simple exercise. Download and open the ﬁle 
c12-Visualization-Start.rvt from this book’s web page. From the Project Browser, open the 
ORTHOGRAPHIC VIEW. To apply a ﬁlter to your view and visualize the rated walls, follow 
these steps:
1. First, open the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box (type VG on the keyboard or 
select it in the Properties palette) and choose the Filters tab. Click the Add button to begin 
the process of creating and applying a new ﬁlter.
2. Select the Edit/New button and create a new ﬁlter called Rated Walls, as shown in 
Figure 12.35. With the new ﬁlter selected, from the Categories list, check the box for 
Walls. In the Filter Rules group on the right side of the dialog box, select Fire Rating 
from the Filter By drop-down menu. Set the ﬁlter to Equals in the next drop-down, and 
then select 2 from the third drop down menu. Make sure the ﬁlter is selected in the 
 column on the left, and click OK to add it to your Visibility/Graphic Overrides settings.

3. When you return to the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box, you’ll need to add the 
ﬁlter to your view. Simply click Add, and select Rated Walls.
4. The next step is to customize the Rated Walls ﬁlter so that items that fall into the ﬁlter 
category will have a speciﬁc graphic effect. Set the Projection/Surface override for 
Patterns to Red and Diagonal Crosshatch. To do this, select the Override button in that 
category to bring up the dialog box shown in Figure 12.36. You’ll also want to choose the 
Override button for both Lines and Patterns under the Cut heading and set each of their 
colors to Red, as you just did for line graphics. (Note that you can specify whichever  
ﬁll pattern you want. Diagonal crosshatch was selected for this exercise for clarity of 
the ﬁgures.)

5. When you’ve ﬁnished, click OK to return to the view of the project. You’ll see that  
the ﬁlter is overriding the project-deﬁned graphics of the two-hour rated walls  
(Figure 12.37).
Figure 12.37 
Applied ﬁlter in 
Shaded view
What’s wonderful about this is that you’re able to visually coordinate and verify your project 
schedules with project views that conﬁrm what is being described in the schedules. This even 
works in Hidden Line view, as shown in Figure 12.38. Changing elements in the schedule or 
from the project environment will immediately update in all views of your project.

Setting User-Deﬁned Parameters
Now let’s look at another example where a particular parameter you might need for a project 
is not part of the default project environment. In this example, you want to show the space as 
functionally complete—all the ofﬁce furniture in place—but a lot of the content that is shown in 
the image isn’t actually in the scope of work for your contract. To demonstrate this, you want to 
show those furnishings as a separate color. To do this, you’ll make two changes to the image.
First, this kind of parameter will have to be applied across many categories of elements— 
furniture, equipment, appliances, and so on. Second, it may apply to one element but not apply 
to another element in the very same category, name, and type. For example, under the Furniture 
category, the designer can specify the desks and cubicles but not the chairs. To make this pos-
sible, you’ll want to make sure you’re using an instance parameter (not a type parameter).
For this exercise, continue with the ﬁle from the previous section or download and open the 
ﬁle c12-Visualization-Start.rvt from this book’s web page.
1. From the Project Browser, right-click the ORTHOGRAPHIC VIEW and duplicate the 
view. Rename the duplicate view that is created to PHASE 2 - 2 HOUR RATED WALLS. 
In the view, return to your Filters dialog box by opening the Visibility/Graphic Overrides 
dialog box (VG) and create a new ﬁlter named Not In Contract.
2. Make sure you select numerous categories of elements that you want to be able to dis-
tinguish as Not In Contract. For this example, we chose Electrical Equipment, Electrical 
Fixtures, Furniture, and Furniture Systems, as shown in Figure 12.39. When you ﬁnish, 
select <More Parameters…> from the Filter Rules drop-down list.

482 | CHAPTER 12 VISUALIZATION

3. The Project Parameters dialog box opens. You need to make a new parameter called 
Not In Contract. Click the Add button. This will take you to the Parameter Properties 
dialog box. Type in the name of the new parameter, Not In Contract. From the Type 
of Parameter drop-down menu, choose Yes/No. From the Group parameter select 
Construction. Finally, check the boxes for the following categories: Electrical Equipment, 
Electrical Fixtures, Furniture, and Furniture Systems, as shown in Figure 12.40.
This user-deﬁned project parameter will allow you to distinguish elements across a 
number of categories.
Figure 12.40 
User-deﬁned instance 
parameters

UNDERSTANDING ANALYTIC VISUALIZATION | 483
4. Click OK to apply your parameter to the ﬁlter.
In this case, you’re instructing Revit to override the graphics when the value of Not In 
Contract equals Yes in the Filter Rules settings (Figure 12.41).
Figure 12.41 
Filter parameters
5. You’ll return to the Filters tab in the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box, where you’ll 
deﬁne how the graphics will be overridden. Once again, add the ﬁlter and override the 
surface pattern with a solid yellow color.
6. Back in the 3D view, select some elements from the categories that you’ve just created a 
ﬁlter for. You’ll notice that as you select the object in your ﬁle, the instance parameter for 
Not In Contract is available in the Properties palette (Figure 12.42).
Figure 12.42 
Instance parameters

484 | CHAPTER 12 VISUALIZATION
7. Select the check box.
As you do, the solid color will be applied to the components, as shown in Figure 12.43, 
because the ﬁlter that you created now applies to the elements that you’ve selected, even 
in Hidden Line views!

Identifying Design Elements
Another use for this process of using ﬁlters is identifying “generic” host design elements as you 
move between design iteration and design resolution. Figure 12.44 shows a ﬁlter that has been 
applied to a view to highlight any walls, ﬂoors, ceilings, or roofs that have the term Generic used 
in their family name.
Figure 12.44 
Identifying generic 
elements

UNDERSTANDING ANALYTIC VISUALIZATION | 485
Typically in a design project, you might create a series of generic elements to replace the ones 
that have a more detailed label. Using a ﬁlter to identify those, you can quickly locate what 
needs more detail from within your project. The default template already uses the term generic to 
describe basic design host elements, which makes them easy to ﬁlter, as shown in Figure 12.45.
Figure 12.45 
Generic host ele-
ment ﬁlter
Setting Solar and Shadow Studies
By using solar and shadow studies, you can use another analytic visual style that allows you to 
communicate natural lighting based on your project’s location, orientation, and time of year. The 
sun’s path can also be displayed (Figure 12.46), and you can edit the path of the sun both directly 
by dragging the sun or sun path within the view and indirectly through time-of-day settings.
Figure 12.46 
Visual sun path

486 | CHAPTER 12 VISUALIZATION
The sun path can be activated from the view control bar. You’ll also notice the Sun Settings 
option in the Sun Settings pop-up menu. This setting will allow you to give an exact location, 
time, and date for the sun. Selecting Sun Settings (Figure 12.47) allows you to select the set-
tings for your particular view and solar study type. This tool can be used in various view types, 
including plans, elevations, 3D, and perspectives.
Figure 12.47 
Sun Settings
You can create four types of solar studies in Revit:
 
◆
The Still setting allows you to create a study of a particular time, date, and location.
 
◆
Single Day allows you to create a study over an entire day at intervals of 15, 30, 45, and 
60 minutes.
 
◆
Multi-Day allows you to create a sun study over a range of dates at intervals of an hour, a 
day, a week, and a month.
 
◆
A Lighting study is not related to a particular time, date, or place. It’s more useful for add-
ing graphic depth and texture with “sunlight” from an analytic top right or top left.
Single images are created using the Rendering dialog box. However, animations of single- 
and multiday solar studies are created by clicking the Application menu and selecting Export ➣ 
Images And Animations ➣ Solar Study.
For either single- or Multi-Day sun studies, you can set your project location through the Sun 
Settings dialog box. In the upper-right corner is the Location button. Selecting this button will 
pull up the Location Weather And Site dialog box (Figure 12.48). Here you can select your proj-
ect location from the map or via the Project Address drop-down menu. Select your city and click 
OK to close the dialog box. This will set the location of your project universally for this model, 
so if you are using the energy modeling tools or sun settings or exporting the project for use in 
another application like Autodesk® 3ds Max® software, this setting will locate the project on the 
globe for all those uses.

UNDERSTANDING PHOTOREALISTIC VISUALIZATION | 487
Figure 12.48 
Locating the project
Regardless of whether you choose to use Still, Single Day, or Multi-Day, analytic visualiza-
tion is incredibly useful for quickly communicating information about your project in a way 
that isn’t literally associated with the actual real-world material assignments of your project ele-
ments. Although photorealistic visualization would render wood as “wood,” an analytic visu-
alization could be used to identify which wood materials were sustainably harvested, recycled, 
or Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design (LEED) certiﬁed. Analytic visualization is 
concerned with the actual properties of a material, not just what it looks like. Because analytic 
visualizations can often be viewed in real time, your project information remains visually con-
current and up to date.
Understanding Photorealistic Visualization
When compared to analytic visualization, photorealistic visualization is the expression of the 
emotive, experiential qualities of your space and content. Materials are carefully selected 
for accuracy and real-world simulation. Put another way, if analytic visualization is about 
what something means, photorealistic visualization is about how something feels or is 
experienced.

488 | CHAPTER 12 VISUALIZATION
In many cases you’ll ﬁnd yourself tweaking materials and lighting in order to “theatrically” 
increase the visual interest of the space. Embellishing your model with nonproject entourage is 
probably essential, and we’ll cover important techniques to keep that content from cluttering up 
the views that are necessary for construction documentation.
In the following sections, we’ll review the process for creating camera views and walk-
throughs, and then we’ll look at some of the settings that impact the outcome of the renderings 
in Revit.
Rendering Sequence and Workﬂow
You’d be surprised, but many people render in the wrong sequence. The workﬂow for creating 
compelling renderings is not the same one you use to resolve your design process. If you try to 
do one like the other, the result is a lot of wasted time and frustration. Consider a documentation-
based design process to create a building that moves from intent to content.
1. Host components (walls, ﬂoors, and roofs)
2. Hosted components (doors and windows)
3. Furniture, ﬁxtures, and equipment
4. Assembly details and documentation
The challenge is that this process does not provide an optimal workﬂow for creating great 
renderings. If you’re focused on the process of visualization, the ideal workﬂow is more along the 
lines of the following:
1. Geometry (host and family components)
2. Cameras (setting up your views)
3. Lighting (using matte materials)
4. Materials
Yes, this is as simple as it gets: cameras, then lights, and then materials. In a documenta-
tion-based process, lights don’t usually show up until the building is well resolved because 
you’re placing lights meant to be the actual ﬁxtures to be installed in the building, not just 
for rendering. So, the documentation process is simply out of sequence with the visualization 
process.
In addition, you need to evaluate the lighting neutrally, without materials to distract you. As 
you’re placing your content, a lot of elements already have material assignments. You need to 
ﬁnd a way to neutralize the material settings while you ﬁgure out lighting. Now you just need 
to put it all together!
Creating Perspective Views
The tasks of creating and modifying your camera views are almost as important as the model 
content you’re creating. If you’re not careful, you can easily fail to impress the viewer by select-
ing the wrong view and aspect ratio of the camera and controls.

UNDERSTANDING PHOTOREALISTIC VISUALIZATION | 489
Figure 12.49 
Orthographic view 
versus perspective view
To create a perspective view, switch to the View tab, locate the Create panel, and click 3D 
View ➣ Camera. This command will not work if you are working in a drafting view, a schedule, 
or another camera view. When the Camera command is activated, you will need to pick two 
points. The ﬁrst point to select is the camera location, and the second point is the target location. 
Keep in mind that when you rotate your view, the rotation is centered on the target elevation. If 
you use the Camera command in a plan view, as shown in Figure 12.50, you have the opportu-
nity to specify the elevation of the camera as an exact distance from the associated level in the 
Options bar.
Figure 12.50 
Placing the camera 
in a plan view
Perspective views communicate far more depth than orthographic views (Figure 12.49). 
Unless the view needs to be at dimensioned scales, we prefer to use perspective views of the 
project for renderings.

490 | CHAPTER 12 VISUALIZATION
Figure 12.51 
Reactivate the camera 
controls with Show 
Camera.
Once you see the camera, you can select and move it around your project. Doing so allows 
you to move your camera closer or farther away. You can also select the clipping planes of your 
camera and edit the front and back planes of your camera’s view.
The aspect ratio of your camera view is also important. For example, a television ratio of 4:3 
seems far less expansive and dramatic than a 16:9 wide-screen ratio. Figure 12.52 illustrates this; 
image (a) is 4:3, and image (b) is 16:9. The result is that image (a) seems too tight and constrained, 
whereas image (b) is far more natural.
To change the aspect ratio, select the crop region in the camera view and then click the Size 
Crop command in the contextual tab of the ribbon. In the resulting dialog box, you can change 
the aspect proportionally or nonproportionally (Figure 12.53). Keep in mind that this setting 
doesn’t zoom your camera forward and backward; it simply changes the relative height and 
width of the aperture.
You can also modify the camera position and angle on the ﬂy using the SteeringWheels® 
(similar to other Autodesk products). Simply activate the Navigation Wheel (Figure 12.54) 
located on the right side of the view window or press Shift+W on the keyboard. You’ll be able 
to zoom, pan, and orbit as well as control other view features using the Navigation Wheel. 
This tool can take some getting used to because it will “follow” your mouse pointer across 
the screen—it’s not anchored at the bottom corner as the image might suggest. This is helpful 
because it will give you a dynamic menu to change and modify your view, but don’t forget to 
turn it off before you start modifying geometry. Selecting the same button again will hide the 
tool until you need it again.
After creating a camera view, you should understand that there is a boundary box that 
deﬁnes the extents of the view deﬁned by the camera and target locations. If you need to adjust 
these two locations (other than by navigating within the camera view), you can activate the 
controls by going to another view, like a plan, and then locating the camera view in the Project 
Browser. Right-click the camera view and choose Show Camera from the context menu, as 
shown in Figure 12.51.

Collaborating on Your Designs
One of the great features of Revit software is the almost immediate visualizations you can perform 
within a model for quick yet meaningful collaboration. In many ﬁrms, the lead designers tend 
to work and think with pen and paper. Traditionally, they ﬁnd it diﬃcult to design in modeling 
software. Using the visualization tools, it’s easy for modelers and nonmodelers to speak the same 
language. Being able to identify some key camera points within the model will allow you to create 
quick hidden line or shadowed perspectives that a designer can trace over and then collaborate with 
the team to drive changes in the model. Save those perspectives, and they can be printed again and 
again as the design changes, allowing the designer to see the progress.
Locking Your View
After you create your view, you might want to consider locking it so it can’t be accidentally 
adjusted. Although you can’t tag elements in a perspective view, it is a good practice to lock 
camera views to preserve consistency between rendering iterations. The view-locking tools  
can be accessed from the view control bar, as shown in Figure 12.55.
Figure 12.55 
Lock view settings
Three options are available from the Lock 3D View option. Save Orientation And Lock View 
keeps the current orientation and prohibits anyone from rotating the view. As its name implies, 
the Unlock View command unlocks the view and allows you to navigate freely. After you have 
unlocked a previously locked view and changed the view, click Restore Orientation And Lock 
View to return the view to its previously saved orientation. If you unlock a locked view and 

UNDERSTANDING PHOTOREALISTIC VISUALIZATION | 493
then choose Save Orientation And Lock View, the previously saved orientation is lost while the 
new orientation is saved and locked.
Creating a Walkthrough
In addition to still perspective views, you have the ability to create animation paths called 
walkthroughs. Creating a walkthrough is much like creating a series of connected camera views. 
Like any other 3D view, a walkthrough can be generated using any of the visual styles and settings 
we described previously in this chapter. In the following exercise, use the c12-Visualization-
Start.rvt ﬁle.
1. From your Level 1 plan view, start placing a series of cameras by setting the camera loca-
tion and then the camera direction.
Note that each time you pick a location, these cameras will become the key frames in 
your animation. When you have placed the last camera, press the Esc key and your 
ﬁnished path will appear (Figure 12.56).
Figure 12.56 
Te ﬁnished cam-
era path

494 | CHAPTER 12 VISUALIZATION
2. Right-clicking the path and choosing Edit Walkthrough will allow you to manipulate 
each of the series of views that you just created. Right-click the nodes on the path and 
choose Go To View.
If your walkthrough path is not displayed, look in the Project Browser for the 
Walkthroughs category and locate the walkthrough view you just created. Right-click it 
and select Show Camera from the context menu.
3. Double-click the walkthrough view in the Project Browser to open the view as you  
would any of the other views.
Figure 12.57 shows the ﬁrst view in the path that we’ve just created along with the 
Walkthrough view properties from the Properties palette.
The view you might see when you activate a walkthrough is the last frame in the camera 
path. You’ll need to use the Show Camera method to select the walkthrough and then 
click Edit Walkthrough to access the frame controls. You can then use the control icons in 
the ribbon or set the Frame value to 1 in the Options bar to get to the ﬁrst camera point in 
your walkthrough.
Figure 12.57 
A walkthrough  
camera view 
with associated 
properties
4. Let’s modify the aspect ratio to 16:9. Select the view boundary and select Size Crop from 
the contextual tab in the ribbon. By default, the view is 6″ × 4 -1/2″ (150 mm × 113 mm). 
Select the Field Of View radio button and then set the Width value to 8″ (200 mm).
5. We’re going to export a Hidden Line view for testing (especially before rendering),  
but we want to give the walkthrough more depth. So, in the Graphic Display Options  
dialog box we reviewed earlier in this chapter, under Model Display change the 
Silhouettes option to Wide Lines.
It’s not usually desirable to simply walk with the camera facing the same direction that 
you’re walking. So you’re going to modify the camera directions to make the visualiza-
tion more dynamic. This will require that you open a couple of views and tile the view 
windows, as shown in Figure 12.58. This way, you’ll be able to see the results of your 
work in one view while working in another.

UNDERSTANDING PHOTOREALISTIC VISUALIZATION | 495
Figure 12.58 
Tiled camera and 
plan views

6. Activate the plan view of Level 1, and then click the Close Hidden Windows button from 
the Quick Access toolbar. Activate the walkthrough, and then tile those views by press-
ing WT on the keyboard. Press ZA to activate the Zoom All To Fit command.
A couple of important points should be noted. First, you’re showing the plan and the 
camera view at the same time. This allows you to see both the graphic and the analytic 
camera, which is important for modifying views. As you can see, when you select the 
boundary of the view on the right, the camera path highlights in the view on the left. 
Since the view is selected, you have the option of editing the crop size just as with any 
other camera. But you also have the option of editing the walkthrough.
7. Click the Edit Walkthrough option, and you’ll see the contextual toolbar shown in 
Figure 12.59.
When you open the Walkthrough Editor, the camera path now shows important controls 
(Figure 12.60).
The red dots along the path represent key frame locations (when you placed your cam-
era), and the red dot directly in front of the camera allows you to control the rotational 
direction. By default, all the cameras face ahead relative to their location on the path. 
But you can edit the default so that the camera can follow one direction but face another 
direction.

496 | CHAPTER 12 VISUALIZATION
Figure 12.60 
Camera path and 
controls
Because the default path is 300 frames in length, it would take a long time to go to each frame 
and edit what you see. It’s better to jump ahead from key frame to key frame, editing fewer loca-
tions. When you do this, Revit will interpolate the frames between the key frames for you. As 
you advance through each key frame, try to experiment rotating the camera to the left and right 
as well as glancing up and down. You can do so by dragging the target point in the plan view 
or using the Navigation Wheel in the camera view. Use the Look command from the Navigation 
Wheel for best results.
Exporting a Walkthrough
After you edit the key frames in the walkthrough, you can export the animation by clicking the 
Application button and choosing Export ➣ Images And Animations ➣ Walkthrough. The options 
to export an AVI are the same as all of the options for rendering still images (Figure 12.61).
A 15 frames-per-second (fps) frame rate is minimal to keep the animation smooth. But if you 
increased the frame rate, the animation length would shorten, and it would seem like you were 
running (rather than walking) through the scene. What can you do to have a longer animation 
without adding speed? Simply add more frames to your animation.
From the Properties palette, open the Walkthrough Frames dialog box (Figure 12.62). By 
increasing the Total Frames value, you can also adjust the relative frames per second (fps) to 
maintain the desired speed.

UNDERSTANDING PHOTOREALISTIC VISUALIZATION | 497
Figure 12.61 
Graphic format 
controls
Figure 12.62 
Default frame count
So, for example, if you wanted to increase the fps to 30 but maintain the same travel speed, 
you would also increase the Total Frames setting to 600.
Finally, where a lot of people struggle is with the speed of their animation. Unless you’re 
breaking up your animation into separate paths (which will be combined later into a single 
sequence), it’s necessary to be able to speed up or slow down your camera’s movement. In Revit, 
you can uncheck the Uniform Speed option to speed up or slow down the camera during a 
single animation study.
The same visual effect plays a part in your renderings. The farther you are from something, 
the faster your camera can move as you ﬂy by and still seem smooth and ﬂuid. But you will 
need to slow down considerably if you’re walking through the building, where a comfortable 
pace is 6 to 8 feet (2 to 2.5 meters) per second.

498 | CHAPTER 12 VISUALIZATION
We’ve exported the animation from this portion of the chapter. It’s important to understand 
that when Revit exports video, it exports in an uncompressed format. The ﬁle sizes will be large 
compared to what you might be used to. Any of the videos can be brought into other video-editing 
tools (iMovie, HandBrake, Movie Maker, and so on) to compress the raw footage. If you want to 
investigate the ﬁle or animation, you can download the c12-Visualization-Finished.rvt ﬁle 
or the c12_Visualization_Animation.avi ﬁle from the Chapter 12 folder on this book’s web 
page at www.sybex.com/go/masteringrevit2018.
Rendering Settings
Now that we have covered the processes to create still camera views and walkthroughs, let’s 
discuss some of the settings that are important to understand before you begin to generate 
photorealistic renderings. You can access the Rendering dialog box by clicking the teapot icon 
on the View tab in the ribbon or in the view control bar of a 3D view.
Some of these settings are also available from the Rendering Settings dialog box, which is 
accessed from the Properties palette when you are working with a 3D view. Figure 12.63 shows 
the Rendering dialog box to the left and the Rendering Settings dialog box to the right.
Figure 12.63 
Rendering dialog box

UNDERSTANDING PHOTOREALISTIC VISUALIZATION | 499
If you are a veteran to Revit, you will notice that there is a subtle difference with the 
Rendering dialog. When Revit 2016 was released, it allowed a user to select a render engine 
called NVIDIA mental ray® or a new render engine called Autodesk Raytracer®, which had sim-
ilar rendering characteristics to the interactive Ray Trace view setting that can be selected in the 
view control bar. Since the release of Revit 2017, NVIDIA mental ray has been removed; instead, 
Raytracer is the default rendering engine and has undergone incremental improvements from 
what was originally released in Revit 2016.
So, what is Raytracer? Raytracer is an iterative rendering engine that renders in a series of 
passes, with each pass adding to the accuracy of how materials and lighting are represented 
in the rendered scene. Unlike traditional rendering engines, if you were to stop Raytracer mid-
render, the ﬁdelity of the rendered image would be consistent and complete. It would not have 
missing rendered areas or areas that are partially rendered. This capability brings enormous 
ﬂexibility in a rendering workﬂow. With Raytracer, you don’t have to worry if the available time 
for rendering is sufﬁcient to complete a rendered image. As long as you initiate the rendering 
process, even if you have only 30 minutes, the end result will be a complete rendering, consis-
tent in its quality. Granted, the previous example represents the direst of circumstances, but in 
the high-speed architecture industry, this capability is the difference between having something 
to show at a design meeting and being left empty-handed.
Using Output Settings
An important setting in this dialog box is Resolution. It’s easy to spend far too much time cre-
ating a rendered view because rendering times increase exponentially when the resolution 
doubles. Think of it this way: if you’re rendering a view at 150 dots per inch (dpi) and then you 
render the same view at 300 dpi, the image is now four times larger, not twice as large (1 × 1 = 1 
and 2 × 2 = 4). If you were to render the view at 600 dpi, it would be 16 times larger (4 × 4 = 16), 
and you could reasonably expect the 150 dpi image that rendered in a few minutes to take con-
siderably longer at 600 dpi.
How large you need to render something depends on what you’re going to use it for: screen 
or print. Don’t expect a rendering the size of a 3″ × 5″ (75 mm × 150 mm) postcard to work for a 
3′ × 5′ (900 mm × 1500 mm) banner.
The Output Settings options help you determine the level of resolution at which your image can 
be saved when rendered. The screen resolution is simply the resolution of the view on your monitor.
You should be much more interested in the Printer settings because of the likelihood that 
you’ll need to print your views. Again, the resolution is important, because you’re printing for 
something that will be viewed at some distance (arm’s length or a few feet away) with the naked 
eye. Rendering beyond what can reasonably be seen is time that can be spent on further reﬁn-
ing your design. While the default printer resolutions are shown in Figure 12.64, you can input 
other values by typing them in the dialog box.
Figure 12.64 
Printer settings

500 | CHAPTER 12 VISUALIZATION
Using Quality
Revit’s Raytracer render engine provides four presets: Draft, Medium, High, and Best. Figure 12.65 
illustrates the render range for settings between Draft and Best.
Figure 12.65 
(a) Draft setting;  
(b) Best setting
(a)
(b)
There is a drastic difference in the currently available options and what had been present 
throughout early versions of Revit. Gone are the slider controls that controlled reﬂection, trans-
parency, and indirect illumination; instead, the Render Quality settings provide ﬁve radio but-
tons grouped under two major categories.
Light And Material Accuracy  This grouping allows you to select one of two rendering 
accuracy settings.
Simpliﬁed - Approximate Materials And Shadows  Speeds up the rendering passes at 
the cost of accuracy to materials and shadows in areas such as indirect illumination, soft 
shadows, reﬂection, and refraction.
Advanced - Precise Materials And Shadows  Increases the accuracy of materials and 
shadow and with each rendering pass tightens the accuracy of real-world effects such as 
indirect illumination, soft shadows, reﬂection, and refraction. Using this setting increases 
the render time for each pass.
Render Duration  This grouping allows you to select one of three duration settings. 
Remember that with an iterative renderer, it is no longer a matter of whether you have 
enough time to complete the rendering; it becomes a question of what quality of rendering 
you can achieve with the available amount of time.
Render By Level  Selecting this option allows you to specify the number of render passes. 
The minimum setting is 1, and the maximum setting is 40.
Render By Time  Selecting this option allows you to specify the number of minutes to 
be dedicated to the rendering process.
Until Satisfactory  Selecting this option will instruct the rendering process to continu-
ously render pass after pass until it is instructed to stop rendering.

UNDERSTANDING PHOTOREALISTIC VISUALIZATION | 501
These settings will control the quality of the output, but remember, with Raytracer, time is a 
correlation to the quality of the rendering achieved (you will always get a complete rendering) 
instead of a risky proposition of whether the available amount of time allows you to complete 
a rendering at the desired output (which may or may not be ﬁnished). Raytracer’s iterative ren-
dering capability and the ability to specify render duration takes away the stress of trying to 
produce a rendering. We still recommend you perform a quick draft render to get a feel for your 
scene setup before committing to a rendering of longer duration.
Using Output Settings and Quality
We’ve discussed both Output Settings and Quality, but for a successful rendering, both must 
work together. As you start experimenting with your rendering exercises, pay attention to 
Output Settings and Quality. If you commit to a rendering with a high-output resolution such 
as 600 dpi but have your Quality set to Draft, you will unnecessarily increase the render time 
for each iterative pass. The end result is a high-resolution image of a low-quality render. The 
reverse is also true. If you set a low-output resolution such as 75 dpi but have your Quality set 
to Best, you will once again increase the render time for each iterative pass. The end result is a 
low-resolution pixelated image trying to convey characteristics of a high-quality render. In both 
cases, the results are subpar.
So, what is the right balance? Well, it’s probably better to render the output resolution a bit 
larger than the format in which it will be presented, which will give you some ﬂexibility if you 
need to increase the size of your image later. Of course, you would want the best quality possi-
ble, but you should always consider the audience that is viewing your rendering. If it is an inter-
nal design meeting, the Medium setting is probably good enough. If it is a ﬁnal presentation or 
a rendering that will be published, you might want to use Best (which defaults to 20 passes) or 
even set it to Until Satisfactory and let it render overnight. There are many potential combina-
tions, but with Raytracer, you have a rendering process that is forgiving. So experiment!
Estimating the Resolution You Should Use
Estimating your image resolution is easy. If the image is going to be viewed on a screen, 150 dpi is 
likely suﬃcient and even gives you some ﬂexibility if the image has to be slightly larger. If you need 
to print the image, 300 dpi will work the majority of the time. Now take the longest dimension of 
your image (height or width) and multiply the dimension by the needed resolution. Tat’s all you 
need to ﬁgure out your image pixel size. If you don’t know the size of the ﬁnal image, guess big: 
perform your necessary draft renderings and make the ﬁnal 2000 to 4000 pixels. Tat will work 
for any large-scale presentation or high-res monitors.
Using Monochromatic Views to Examine Context and Lighting
Now that we have our geometry in a sample model and we have shown you how to create and 
manipulate camera views, we will move on to lighting before discussing materials. That said, it 
is difﬁcult to review your design geometry with realistic lighting in Revit without also render-
ing component materials. If you want to examine spatial context and lighting quality in a mono-
chromatic model, we’ll show you how to accomplish that technique in Revit.
Take a look at the rendering shown in Figure 12.66, which has been created by rendering a 
camera view with all the default materials active.

502 | CHAPTER 12 VISUALIZATION
Figure 12.66 
Camera view rendered 
with default materials
Figure 12.67 
Abstract rendering
The challenge is that to get the materials correct, you’ll have to commit a signiﬁcant amount 
of time to selecting, testing, editing, and reﬁning many material selections for an otherwise 
simple view that’s quite early in the design stage. You don’t have time to resolve your design  
to this level of speciﬁcity early in the iterative process.
Figure 12.67 shows the same view rendered abstractly, with all the model objects set to a 
matte white material.

UNDERSTANDING PHOTOREALISTIC VISUALIZATION | 503
By selecting a matte material for everything in the view, you’re able to focus on form-space 
and light-shadow relationships. Using phase ﬁlters, you can create a rendering like this quickly 
and easily. This technique is much faster than trying to select neutral materials for each element 
type in your view. To begin the series of exercises in this chapter, download and open the ﬁle 
c12-Visualization-Start.rvt from this book’s web page. Here are the steps to create a matte 
rendering using the material overrides in Phasing:
1. From the Project Browser, activate the 3D view named OVERHEAD CAMERA. Press VG 
on the keyboard to activate the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box. In the Model 
Categories tab, uncheck the Ceilings category and then click OK.
2. In the Properties palette, you should see the properties for this 3D view. Click the Edit 
button for Graphic Display Options to bring up the dialog box shown in Figure 12.68. Set 
Style to Shaded, and under Shadows check Show Ambient Shadows. Click OK to close the 
dialog box.
Figure 12.68

Options settings
3. On the Manage tab in the ribbon, click the Phases button to open the Phasing dialog 
box. Select the Phase Filters tab. Click the New button to create a new row in the list of 
ﬁlters. Rename the new ﬁlter to Abstract. Change the New and Existing column values 
to Overridden and then change the Demolished and Temporary column values to Not 
Displayed.
4. Switch to the Graphic Overrides tab and then create a new material. You’ll do this by click-
ing inside any of the Material boxes and then clicking the Selector button on the right. (For 
this exercise use the Material box for Existing.) This will open the Material Browser. In this 
new dialog box, select the Create New Material icon at the lower-left corner. Switch to the 
Identity tab, change the Name to Abstract, and then click Apply (Figure 12.69).

504 | CHAPTER 12 VISUALIZATION
5. This will give you a generic material with some predeﬁned settings. We’re going to cus-
tomize this slightly to make it the universal material we want. Switch to the Appearance 
tab and click the Open/Closes Asset Browser icon.
This will open the Asset Browser, which will allow you to select the attributes of a 
material to match to your new material type. In the Asset Browser, type Porcelain in the 
search bar at the top. In the Asset Browser folder tree, click Ceramic/Porcelain under  
the Appearance Library folder and double-click Neutral Gray to replace the asset in the 
material deﬁnition (Figure 12.70).

This material will give the rendering a nice overall gray ﬁnish without too much reﬂec-
tivity. Click OK to close the Material Browser.
6. Now assign this material to your Existing and New phase objects by selecting this same 
material for those phases (Figure 12.71). Click OK to exit the Phasing dialog box.
Phasing Affects the Entire Project
In the previous exercise, you created a unique phase material override to generate a speciﬁc style 
of visualization. Be aware that phasing settings will aﬀect the entire project; therefore, if you 
are working on a project with others, your team should be made aware of these changes so other 
documentation isn’t adversely aﬀected.
Figure 12.71 
Assigning the Abstract 
material
7. This step is important. Because the material you created is associated as an override for 
the Abstract phase that was created in step 4, for the new material to take effect when you 
render, change the view properties’ Phase Filter setting to Abstract.
8. From the View tab in the ribbon, click the Render tool. In the Rendering dialog box, use 
the following settings:
 
◆
Quality: Medium
 
◆
Output Settings: Screen
 
◆
Lighting: Exterior: Sun Only
 
◆
Background Style: Color, with color set to White
9. Click the Render button and observe the results in the view window. To toggle back and 
forth between the rendered view and the shaded display, click Show The Model at the 
bottom of the Rendering dialog box.
That’s it! When you want to render a project view with this abstract material assignment, 
simply assign the Abstract material to the graphic overrides in the Phasing dialog box and apply 
the Abstract phase ﬁlter to the properties of the camera view.
Adjusting Lighting and Interior Renderings
Let’s take a closer look at an interior camera view and how to adjust natural and artiﬁcial light-
ing. You will continue with the c12-Visualization-Start.rvt ﬁle from the book’s web page. 
From the Project Browser, activate the 3D view named RENDER - CONFERENCE ROOM. As 

506 | CHAPTER 12 VISUALIZATION
you can see in Figure 12.72, we’ve already adjusted the shadows and sunlight as well as applied 
silhouette edge overrides to the live view.
Figure 12.72 
Viewing an interior 
camera view in 
Hidden Line mode
Now let’s render the view. Keep in mind that the rendered material applied to the Abstract 
phase override is solid white (which we set up earlier in this chapter), so you’ll want to turn off 
the visibility of your curtain panels if you want to see through the glazing. Open the Rendering 
dialog box by clicking the teapot icon in the view control bar and choose the following settings:
 
◆
Quality: Medium
 
◆
Output Settings: Printer, set to 300 dpi
 
◆
Lighting: Exterior: Sun Only
 
◆
Background Style: Color, with color set to White
The reason we’re using Printer as the Output Setting is that 300 dpi is sufﬁcient for printing 
this page. And an 8″ (200 mm) wide image will sufﬁce for the anticipated width of this book.
Figure 12.73 shows the results of the rendering. The scene can be viewed beyond the imme-
diate space of the conference room. Take particular note of the shadows and how the lighting 
drops off from the edge of a shadow. If the rendering appears too dark or too bright, click the 
Adjust Exposure button to change the Exposure Value setting.
Of course, this image is being rendered with the sun, which doesn’t count for interior render-
ings; it’s just a benchmark. But you can begin to see the level of detail and materiality and the 
“look and feel” of the space. Now that you know what it looks like, you can turn off the sun and 
start placing some artiﬁcial lights.
Because you’re rendering abstractly using a phase override, everything is going to be solid 
white. But if your light source is behind a solid lens, it’s not going to render very well. The best 
way we’ve found to handle this is to create a unique object subcategory for the lens that sur-
rounds the light source. Doing so allows you to control the visibility of the lens of the lighting 
ﬁxture, thus preventing obstruction of the light source. Unfortunately, this approach will not 
give the most realistic effect because many lighting effects result from light passing through 
translucent objects (like lenses or shades). But it’s the best you’ll be able to do for now to resolve 
lighting before you resolve materials.

UNDERSTANDING PHOTOREALISTIC VISUALIZATION | 507
Figure 12.73 
Sun Only rendering
Before you can add lighting, you need to add a ceiling to the spaces. To keep things generic, 
we’ve added the default compound ceiling to all the spaces. It’s just a placeholder for your ceil-
ing that will change later. But the important thing is that you don’t get hung up centering ceiling 
tiles during your design process. Rooms will change dimensions, and all that time spent center-
ing will go to waste.
Placing Artiﬁcial Lighting
Activate the Level 1 ceiling plan and locate the room we have identiﬁed with a revision cloud. 
This is the room in which you will begin placing light ﬁxtures to continue the exercise.
1. On the Architecture tab in the ribbon, click the Component tool, and from the Type 
Selector, choose the Downlight - Recessed Can family that has been preloaded from the 
default Revit library. You can use the 6″ Incandescent - 120V type.
2. Place ﬁxtures in the ceiling plan along the lower and right walls, as shown in Figure 12.74. 
The exact dimensions aren’t important—just get the idea right.
Figure 12.74 
Placing light ﬁxtures in 
the ceiling

508 | CHAPTER 12 VISUALIZATION
This light family doesn’t have a lens, so you don’t have to worry about the light source being 
obscured. Before you start to render these artiﬁcial lights, we need to explain the process and 
technique of using light groups.
Manipulating Light Groups
There are times when you’ll want to isolate the lights that are being calculated and rendered in 
a particular view. You might want to test the lighting that will result from having certain lights 
on and others off, just as in a real space. Revit software allows you to create light groups for 
this purpose. Doing so saves you a lot of time compared to turning individual lights off and on 
manually.
By default, whenever you place lights in your project, they’re not placed in any group. 
They’re “unassigned,” just like the lights shown in Figure 12.75. You access this dialog box 
by clicking the Show Rendering Dialog tool on the view control bar and then clicking the 
Artiﬁcial Lights button in the Rendering dialog box. Here you can assign and create all kinds 
of light groups.
Figure 12.75 
Light groups
Besides the assignment for the light group, you also have the option of adjusting the 
Dimming value. One reason you might use this feature would be to dim some of the lighting 
and leave other lighting at full value to highlight a feature in the rendering. Let’s create two 
light groups for the conference room in this exercise. Follow these steps:
1. In the Level 1 ceiling plan, select any one of the lights you placed during the previ-
ous exercise. From the Light Group drop-down in the Options bar, choose Edit/New. 
In the Artiﬁcial Lights dialog box, click the New button to create two groups, named 
Conference - Right and Conference - Left (Figure 12.76).

UNDERSTANDING PHOTOREALISTIC VISUALIZATION | 509
Figure 12.76 
Creating light groups
Figure 12.77 
Assigning light groups
2. Now assign the lights to the groups. Just select the lights in either the ceiling plan or any 
3D orthographic view and then assign them to the light group from the Light Group 
drop-down menu in the Options bar, as shown in Figure 12.77. Place the lights in each 
group as indicated in the Level 1 ceiling plan.
3. Return to the camera view named RENDER - CONFERENCE ROOM. Before you start to 
render the view, let’s test the light groups by rendering only the lights in the Conference - 
Right group. To do this, from the Properties palette, open the Rendering Settings dialog 
box and then click the Artiﬁcial Lights button. Turn off the lights in the left group by sim-
ply clicking the check box for that group in the Artiﬁcial Lights dialog box. Figure 12.78 
shows the results after you render with the following settings:
 
◆
Quality: Draft
 
◆
Output Settings: Printer, set to 96 dpi
 
◆
Lighting: Interior: Artiﬁcial only
 
◆
Background Style: Color, with color set to White
After the rendering is complete, if it appears a bit too dark for your liking, use the Adjust 
Exposure controls and turn up the Exposure Value.

510 | CHAPTER 12 VISUALIZATION
Figure 12.78 
Rendering with light 
groups
4. Let’s complete the rendering of the space with the other light group turned on. Keep in 
mind that the more lights you have turned on in your view, the longer the calculations will 
take and, therefore, the longer it will take to render your view. Figure 12.79 shows the results 
of this second rendering, the Exposure Value has been adjusted to 5.0 to brighten the image.
Figure 12.79 
Rendering both light 
groups
5. By default, the image will have a sepia tone. You can remove the sepia tone by adjusting 
the White Point value in the Exposure Control dialog box. In the Rendering Settings or 
Rendering dialog box, click the Adjust Exposure button and set White Point to 3500.
Keep in mind that what you’re looking for is how the lighting affects the space. Are the 
lights too close or too far apart? Does the light spread evenly across the space? Let’s examine 
the lighting further by adding the same lighting to the remaining two sides of the ceiling.
6. After you render the space with all the lights, what becomes apparent is that the lights 
aren’t illuminating the conference table (Figure 12.80). You need to add a nice linear 
lighting source above the table to understand the effect that light will have on the space. 
Again, it’s important that you do this without the distraction of materials.

UNDERSTANDING PHOTOREALISTIC VISUALIZATION | 511

center lights

ture over furniture
7. Return to the Level 1 ceiling plan. We’d like to see the conference table as a reference for 
placing a new light ﬁxture in the context of a ﬂoor plan. In the Properties palette, set the 
Underlay value to Level 1 and then set the Underlay Orientation to Plan.
8. Start the Component tool again, and from the Type Selector, choose the family named 
Pendant Light - Linear - 1 Lamp. Use the type named 96″ - 120V. Place one ﬁxture over the 
conference table, as shown in Figure 12.81. You may need to rotate the ﬁxture for proper 
alignment.

512 | CHAPTER 12 VISUALIZATION
The pendant light ﬁxture family has a lens, but it is not assigned to a subcategory that 
can be turned off when necessary. In the next series of exercise steps, you’ll assign the 
lens to a new subcategory in order to test a rendering with the lens turned off. First, open 
the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box, and expand the Lighting Fixtures category. 
You will notice that the only subcategories are Hidden Lines and Light Source. This will 
change in a moment when you add Lens to the list.
9. Select the linear light you placed over the conference table and click Edit Family in the 
contextual tab of the ribbon to open the family in the Family Editor. Activate the 3D view 
named View 1.
10. In the 3D view, orbit the model so that you can see the bottom of the light ﬁxture. Select 
the main cylindrical extrusion, and from the view control bar, click the sunglasses 
icon and choose Hide Element. You will then see a rectangular extrusion that runs the 
length of the ﬁxture. Select that extrusion and in the Properties palette you’ll see that 
the Subcategory value is None, but the material is set to Glass - White, High Luminance. 
Actually, it is assigned to a type parameter named Diffuser Material; however, this 
doesn’t help because we are overriding the material of all model objects using the abstract 
phasing ﬁlter we discussed previously in this chapter.
11. From the Manage tab in the ribbon, click Object Styles. In the Object Styles dialog box, 
click the New button and create a new subcategory named Lens. Make sure that it is a 
subcategory of Lighting Fixtures. Click OK twice to close both dialog boxes.
12. Select the rectangular extrusion again, and from the Properties palette set the Subcategory 
value to Lens, as shown in Figure 12.82. Repeat this step again for the half-circle diffuser.
Figure 12.82 
Assigning geometry to 
a subcategory
Assign both diffusers
to Subcategory:
Lens.
13. From the ribbon, click Load Into Project to reload the light family into your project. At 
this point, if you were to render the view, you’d notice that light is still obscured by the 
lens, as shown in Figure 12.83.
Eventually, the lens will use its assigned translucent material that will allow the light to 
shine through, but for rendering matte images, you don’t want the light blocked.

UNDERSTANDING PHOTOREALISTIC VISUALIZATION | 513
Figure 12.83 
Rendering with an 
obscured lens
14. Open the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box for the RENDER - CONFERENCE 
ROOM camera view. Expand the Lighting Fixtures category and uncheck the Lens 
subcategory.
15. When you render the view again, the results will look like Figure 12.84. The lens for 
the linear light isn’t showing, but this is ﬁne. You’re after the lighting effect of the 
lighting ﬁxture. The lens will come back on when you render with all the materials 
showing.
Figure 12.84 
Rendered view with 
light lens turned oﬀ
If you want your rendering to seem more complete than just a rendering of the building ele-
ments, you’ll have to add entourage. But you don’t want to clutter all your views with the kinds 
of things that you want to add that will not be part of your document set.

514 | CHAPTER 12 VISUALIZATION
Working with Entourage
Worksets are great for controlling this part of your project. By creating a workset called Entourage, 
you’ll be able to place your project content on a workset where all of its visibility can be quickly and 
easily controlled. But before creating and assigning elements to a workset, make sure the workset 
is turned oﬀ by default in other views.
Tis means that entourage will not show up in existing or new views until you turn it on; otherwise, 
you’ll have to turn this workset oﬀ in all present and future views. Tis will save you a lot of time 
as you add entourage to your project.
Assigning Materials
Now that you have determined the right lighting effects using matte materials, you can set the 
phase ﬁlter of the interior camera view back to Show Complete. You’ll also want to turn on the 
visibility for the curtain panels as well as the Lens subcategory of Lighting Fixtures. Keep in 
mind that with all the new materials, transparency, and reﬂectivity, it will take quite a bit longer 
to re-render the view (Figure 12.85).
Figure 12.85 
Rendering with 
materials
Once you render the view and you can start to see the transparency and reﬂectivity in the 
curtain panels, the rendering takes on a much more realistic effect. You can also see the materi-
als in the table and chairs as well as the lens for the linear light above the conference table.
At the moment, all the materials that are assigned to the walls in this view are based on the 
properties of the wall. And creating surface materials for every different wall would result in a 
very long list of wall types! A better method of assigning materials on a case-by-case basis is to 
use the Paint tool. Just be aware that your modeled walls might continue beyond the conﬁnes 
of the space in which you are designing, and painting a material on a surface may affect other 
spaces.

UNDERSTANDING PHOTOREALISTIC VISUALIZATION | 515
To assign materials to host elements, select the Paint tool on the Modify tab in the ribbon. 
Select a material from the Material Browser and then click a surface in the model. If you need to 
remove a painted-on material, use the Remove Paint tool from the same ﬂyout button you used 
for the Paint tool.
Rendering in the Cloud
In addition to rendering on your own computer, Autodesk offers the ability to render “in the 
cloud.” This simply means that you will be sending data from your computer to remote comput-
ers operated by Autodesk for increased processing power and more ﬂexibility. As we mentioned 
previously in this chapter, the rendering process can be time-consuming, especially when you 
can’t do any other work while renderings are being produced. The cloud option becomes quite 
compelling when you consider the beneﬁt of gained productivity.
As of this writing, you can create a user account for free at http://gallery.autodesk.com/
a360rendering. With a free account, you will receive some amount of complimentary cloud 
credits; however, some cloud-rendering processes are free. For example, you can process a still 
rendering up to a Render Quality value of Standard with an Image Size value of Medium with-
out using any credits. This allows you to send many draft renderings until you are happy with 
the results and then use your credits to produce the ﬁnal rendering.
After you create a user account, you will need to connect to the Autodesk® 360 service in the 
Info Center at the top of the application window, as shown in Figure 12.86.
Figure 12.86 
Sign in to the Autodesk 
360 service.
Once you are connected, you can use the Render In Cloud command from the View 
tab in the ribbon. In the Render In Cloud dialog box, you can select multiple 3D views for 
rendering, the output type (Still Image, Panorama, Stereo Panorama, or Illuminance), the 
render quality (Standard or Final), the image size (Small, Medium, Large, Extra Large, or 
Maximum), the exposure (Native or Advanced), and the ﬁle format (PNG, JPEG, or TIFF). At 
the bottom of the dialog box, you can also choose to be notiﬁed via e-mail when the cloud 
rendering is complete (Figure 12.87). Once you click the Start Rendering button, a small 
amount of data will be uploaded, and then you can get back to work while the cloud works 
on your renderings!
After you have been notiﬁed that your renderings have completed, you can access and share 
the renderings from your Autodesk 360 web space (Figure 12.88). Each image has contextual 
commands that include the ability to download the ﬁle and adjust the exposure levels.

Te Future of Visualization: Virtual Reality
Now that we’ve completed our discussion of all the visualization capabilities within Revit, we 
feel that it is necessary to discuss the future trend. We have all heard the buzzwords virtual 
reality and augmented reality (AR). Exciting new technologies are making these concepts pos-
sible. So, what is VR/AR, and if you want to engage in this, how do you proceed? First let’s look 
at the deﬁnitions.
 
◆
Virtual reality is the computer simulation of three-dimensional space, utilizing special 
equipment that allows for an immersive ﬁrst-person experience that is presented in 
real time. It can include interactivity that allows the user to manipulate aspects of the 
simulation.
 
◆
Augmented reality is a computer simulation that is superimposed on the user’s view of the 
real world, offering a composite view. The computer simulation that is composited can 
range from something as simple as data to presenting a complex model.
Though the two deﬁnitions have similar concepts, they are not interchangeable. So, what is 
possible? VR is here now. It is the emerging technology that your customers will already be 

THE FUTURE OF VISUALIZATION: VIRTUAL REALITY | 517
asking for, if not today then deﬁnitely in the immediate future. On the other hand, although we 
see incredible potential for the application of AR throughout all aspects of the design process, 
the available AR tools are still in their infancy. Because of this, the remainder of this section will 
focus on VR, but we want to note that as AR is reﬁned and becomes a realistic endeavor, future 
versions of this book will more thoroughly cover the topic.
Use Cases for Virtual Reality
In the ﬂurry of excitement about using VR, people have a tendency to forget why they want to 
utilize it in the ﬁrst place. To ensure that you are staying on target and not utilizing VR simply 
for the sake of using VR, deﬁning use cases is the ﬁrst step. Although there are potentially many 
use cases, we would like to speciﬁcally mention two that particularly have relevance in your 
practice.
Design Review  VR gives you the ability to rapidly review the model for design consider-
ations with both the internal team and the customer. With the inclusion of VR, you have the 
ability to experience the spatial characteristics that may not be obvious in a typical 2D/3D 
representation.
Marketing  For many owners, VR offers the capability to use the technology to sell their 
properties/spaces by allowing their customers to virtually experience the property before 
making the decision to make a sizable investment.
Whatever use cases you deem appropriate for your practice, knowing your use cases will 
inform you of how to proceed with your VR pursuit. It will impact three areas.
Quality  How detailed is the model being presented? Is it a sketch or is it photorealistic?
Interactivity  How much interaction is needed within the VR environment? Is it just a  
walkthrough, or do you need to be able to manipulate objects within the environment?
Available Time for Development  For the VR experience you are trying to create, do you 
need it on demand, or do you have a set development time for the VR? If so, do you have days 
or weeks?
Your answers to these questions will impact your selection of tools, which are described in 
more detail in the next section.
Available Virtual Reality Tools
We assume that you have done some research and you already have an idea of the hardware 
requirements for a computer that will run VR. We also assume you have chosen a VR system 
that you intend to deploy, such as Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. The question then is what software 
should you use, and your answer will determine the workﬂow you will need to get your Revit 
projects into VR.
In reviewing the available solutions, the following are four avenues that you can 
approach, listed from what we feel is the easiest to most difﬁcult in implementation. But 
when we say easy to difﬁcult, this is not to say we favor one method over the other; each 
avenue has its pros and cons. The more difﬁcult solutions, for example, have capabilities that 
the easier solutions do not. Also, this discussion just touches on the capabilities of each tool. 
You must do your homework to make sure that the solution you select is the right ﬁt for your 
organization’s needs.

518 | CHAPTER 12 VISUALIZATION
Enscape
This solution is a plug-in for Revit and perhaps one of the easiest ways of performing real-time 
visualization (Figure 12.89). Once you launch Enscape, it opens a window that runs the Revit 
model within a real-time engine and offers impressive renderings of the Revit model. For more 
information on Enscape, check out the website at https://enscape3d.com/.
Figure 12.89

◆
Ideal for conducting rapid design reviews, with the ability to quickly make edits natively in 
the Revit environment. Provides instant updates to the Enscape environment the moment 
any changes are made in the Revit model, including changes to geometry, material, light-
ing, and view settings.
 
◆
Materials are managed directly through Revit, but Enscape also provides supplemental 
tools to quickly change material appearance such as Paper Model, making it ideal for 
reviewing the project for spatial analysis without concern for Materials.
 
◆
Quickly translates Revit lights both exterior and artiﬁcial to lighting objects that can be 
quickly manipulated within Enscape.
 
◆
Support for Oculus Rift and HTC Vive.
Cons
 
◆
No signiﬁcant customization available for the UI.
 
◆
Limited to default interaction of environment built within Enscape.
 
◆
No scripting capabilities.

THE FUTURE OF VISUALIZATION: VIRTUAL REALITY | 519
Autodesk Revit Live
This solution is a plug-in for Revit that connects to the cloud-based Revit Live Service. The 
service optimizes the Revit model and creates a downloadable project ﬁle that can be opened 
with the Autodesk Live Editor (Figure 12.90). Autodesk Live Editor allows you to step into your 
design within an interactive environment. Some of the data from the Revit model persists and is 
viewable within the Live Editor. For more information on Autodesk Live, check out Autodesk’s 
website at https://www.autodesk.com/products/revit-live.
Figure 12.90 
Autodesk Live Editor 
real-time view
Pros
 
◆
One-click operation from Revit to Live allows for an easy transition to an interactive 
environment.
 
◆
Model elements retain data from the original Revit family that is viewable within Live.
 
◆
Automated features within Live create basic interactivity like the opening and closing of 
doors.
 
◆
Live ﬁles can be utilized by Autodesk Stingray for more comprehensive simulations.
 
◆
Support for Oculus Rift and HTC Vive.
Cons
 
◆
Reliance on a cloud service to create a virtual environment.
 
◆
Once the Revit model is in Live, there is little to no capability to manipulate or edit the data. 
Any changes needed for the virtual model must be adjusted in Revit and sent back through 
the Live service.
 
◆
Compared to other VR solutions, the presentation of the 3D environment is not as 
impressive.

520 | CHAPTER 12 VISUALIZATION
Lumion
This solution is a stand-alone architectural visualization tool that allows for the import of geom-
etry within a real-time engine (Figure 12.91). Lumion allows the user to easily create compelling 
3D simulations with tools speciﬁcally designed for material assignments and a comprehensive 
model asset library to supplement the model developed from Revit. The end result is a compel-
ling interactive visualization that can be quickly leveraged for making animation walkthroughs. 
For more information on Lumion, check out the website at https://lumion3d.com/.
Figure 12.91 
Lumion real-time view
Pros
 
◆
Accepts a wide range of model formats that can be placed within the Lumion environment, 
including FBX, DWG, MAX, and SKP.
 
◆
Comprehensive out-of-the-box asset library that contains realistic entourage and environ-
ment assets.
 
◆
Robust material system that is simple to use, with capabilities to export the Lumion model 
with materials that handle advanced rendering channels.
 
◆
Robust camera animation tools that are ideal for making quality walkthroughs/
ﬂythroughs.
 
◆
Support for Oculus Rift and Samsung GearVR.
Cons
 
◆
There is no easy button to go from Revit to Lumion. Revit models are imported as FBX.
 
◆
Model geometry optimization may be necessary to clean up artifacts due to FBX export 
from Revit.

THE FUTURE OF VISUALIZATION: VIRTUAL REALITY | 521
 
◆
Additional material assignments and/or material manipulation may be necessary within 
Lumion.
 
◆
No signiﬁcant customization available for the UI.
 
◆
VR capabilities currently limited to panoramas.
Autodesk Stingray
This solution is a full game engine developed by Autodesk (Figure 12.92). It is on par with other 
game engines such as Unreal and Unity. Stingray is capable of developing any type of VR expe-
rience, from something as simple as a walkthrough to a fully immersive interactive environ-
ment. The robustness of Stingray’s features allows for scalability, regardless of VR requirements. 
Because of all the features within Stingray, it is a difﬁcult tool to master. For more information 
on Autodesk Stingray, check out Autodesk’s website at https://www.autodesk.com/products 
/stingray/overview.
Figure 12.92 
Stingray real-
time view
Pros
 
◆
Interoperability with Autodesk Maya, Autodesk Maya LT, Autodesk 3ds Max, and 
Autodesk Live.
 
◆
Ability to leverage any content developed or processed from the applications previously 
listed.
 
◆
Robust material, lighting, and interaction capabilities.
 
◆
Everything from the desired interaction to the UI is highly customizable.
 
◆
Support for Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, iOS, Android, PS4, and Xbox.

522 | CHAPTER 12 VISUALIZATION
Cons
 
◆
There is no easy button to go from Revit to Stingray. Revit models are imported as an FBX.
 
◆
Model geometry optimization may be necessary to clean up artifacts due to FBX export 
from Revit. Though current workﬂows allow for an automated optimization of geometry 
through Autodesk Live, once the geometry is brought into Stingray, the model must be 
reassembled.
 
◆
Additional material assignments and/or material manipulation may be necessary within 
Stingray or through the use of other Material Editor applications.
 
◆
The learning curve is high.
So, the big question is “What VR tool is the best for my practice?” The answer is that it really 
depends on your needs. We previously talked about use cases for VR, and you should pick the 
VR tool that is most appropriate for your use case. You may even decide to pick more than one.
 
◆
If your use case is to quickly conduct design reviews with the ability to make adjustments 
in Revit and then immediately see the impact of the change in VR, Enscape or Autodesk 
Revit Live might be a good solution for you.
 
◆
If your use case is to easily and affordably create compelling presentations through the use 
of still shots and walkthrough animations, with some VR capabilities, then Lumion might 
be the better option.
 
◆
If your use case is to have a fully immersive, interactive VR experience allowing you 
to manipulate everything in your environment, then Autodesk Stingray would be the 
best ﬁt.
This section should have empowered you to more thoroughly investigate VR. Like Revit 
when it was ﬁrst released, VR is the new disruptive technology that will make an impact on 
how we do business, and it will become an integral part of the BIM process.
Te Bottom Line
Create real-time and rendered analytic visualizations.  Analytic visualization is the 
concept of communicating information about your project in a nonliteral way, and it’s very 
important! It’s not about showing real materials in the project but about using ﬁlters to visu-
alize important metadata.
Master It  During the renovation of a space, you want to reuse the doors rather than 
throw them away. How would you illustrate this?
Render emotive photorealistic visualizations.  Photorealistic visualization is about com-
municating design ideas but in emotive ways that are much closer to how the space will be 
experienced, including real lighting, materials, and entourage. Just remember that the time it 
takes to calculate and render your views will change dramatically based on the quality and 
resolution of your views.
Master It  Would the rendering for a PowerPoint presentation differ from a rendering 
being printed for a marketing brochure?

THE BOTTOM LINE | 523
Understand the importance of sequencing your visualization workﬂow.  The sequence 
of design—building, content, materials, and cameras—is not the same as the sequence for 
visualization (geometry/cameras, lighting, materials). Lighting is far more important than 
materials of actual objects. Get the lighting right and the materials will look great, but not the 
other way around.
Master It  How do you create a rendering environment that replaces the actual materials 
with matte materials in order to study the effects of lighting on your design?
Understand what VR means to your practice.  There must be a reason to pursue VR; sim-
ply engaging in it because it is the emerging technology will cause you to miss the mark. To 
effectively pursue VR, be sure to identify the use cases, such as design review or marketing. 
Once you have established the use cases, only then invest in the appropriate tools.
Master It  What is the difference between VR and AR?

 Part 4 
 Extended Modeling 
Techniques 
 In Part 3 we covered a variety of topics that are primarily useful in—although not exclusive to—
the earlier design phases of a project. As you continue to develop your designs, there will be an 
increased speciﬁ city to the elements required in the building information model. You will need 
to expand your knowledge of the fundamental components of a building model, including walls, 
ﬂ oors, roofs, stairs, and railings. In addition, you will likely be required to understand and create 
your own families. This part will dig deep into the rich, component-building skills necessary for 
mastering Autodesk ® Revit ® software.

 Chapter  13 
 Creating Walls and Curtain Walls   
 When modeling in a building information modeling (BIM) process, different levels of informa-
tion are required at speciﬁ c stages of the project. A level of development (LOD) speciﬁ cation 
is a resource that architects can use to plan and deliver the correct geometry and information 
to the project team, whether they be the owner, contractor, or other consultants. You can basi-
cally think of it as a spreadsheet of model requirements. According to the American Institute 
of Architects (AIA) document “G202-2013 Project BIM Protocol Form,” there are ﬁ ve levels of 
model development, ranging from 100 to 500. If you examine excerpts from the model con-
tent requirements describing each LOD for the design professions—LOD 100, LOD 200, and 
LOD 300—the evolution of modeling granularity becomes apparent. Although LOD 100 rep-
resents a conceptual level of information deﬁ ned as “overall building massing,” LOD 200 and 
LOD 300 are represented by “generalized systems or assemblies” and “speciﬁ c assemblies,” respec-
tively. This chapter will help you create walls that comply with both LOD 200 and LOD 300. 
For reference, LOD 400 is generally considered fabrication-level (shop-drawings equivalent), and 
LOD 500 is for as-builts. 
 Four different kinds of walls can be created: basic walls, stacked walls, curtain walls, and 
in-place walls. In this chapter, you will explore the skills needed to create and customize walls 
to meet your design requirements. You will also dive into the new and exciting realm of com-
plex curtain wall and panel generation made possible with the conceptual massing tools in 
Autodesk ® Revit ® software. 
 In this chapter, you will learn to

 Using Extended Modeling Techniques for Basic Walls 
 As you might already know, walls in the Revit environment are made from layers of materi-
als that act as generic placeholders for design layouts to complete assemblies representative 
of actual construction. These layers are assigned functions that allow them to react to similar

layers in other walls as well as in ﬂoors and roofs. The function assignments within object 
assemblies give you a predictable graphic representation when you join these types of overlap-
ping elements.
After you become familiar with the basic modeling functions for walls, you will probably 
need to create your own wall types to achieve more complex designs. As you add more infor-
mation into the source of your building model, you will be able to extract more useful results 
through intelligent tagging and schedules. In the following sections, we’ll show you how to get 
the most out of your basic wall types.
Creating Basic Wall Types
Walls and curtain walls are system families, meaning they exist in a project or template but can-
not be saved as individual families outside of the project ﬁle (as RFA ﬁles). In this sense, when 
deﬁning a system family such as a wall, you are providing the assembly, rather than building 
speciﬁc geometry as with typical families. Other system families include ﬂoors, ceilings, roofs, 
stairs, railings, and mullions. There are only three ways to create or add new system families to 
your project:
 
◆
Duplicate a type from one that already exists and modify its properties.
 
◆
Copy and paste them in as objects from one project to another or group them from one 
project to another.
 
◆
Use the Transfer Project Standards tool.
In Chapter 4, “Conﬁguring Templates and Standards,” we discussed different strategies 
for managing standard content through the use of templates. If you have a series of standard 
wall types you use on every project, you have the option of either storing them in your main 
project template using the subtractive method or storing them in separate container project fold-
ers in an additive method. If you need to make new, custom types that are not part of your tem-
plate, you can create new wall types on the ﬂy at any stage of a project by duplicating existing 
types, adding or removing wall layers, and adjusting the parameters to meet your require-
ments. Regardless of which method you employ to manage templates and standard system 
families, we will show you how to create and customize your own wall types in the following 
sections.
Within a project ﬁle, you can access and edit a wall type in one of two ways:
 
◆
In the Project Browser, scroll down to the Families category, locate any wall type, right-
click it, and select Type Properties, or simply double-click the wall type name.
 
◆
Select a wall in the model or start the Wall command, open the Properties palette, and click 
Edit Type.
The Type Properties dialog box will appear (Figure 13.1). If you don’t see the graphic preview 
to the left, click the Preview button at the bottom of the dialog box.

Using Function and Graphics Type Properties
You can assign basic parameters to the type properties of a wall such as Type Mark, Assembly 
Code, Type Comments, Fire Rating, Cost, and so on. As with any family, only populate the prop-
erties when information is both required by and known for the current project. When deﬁning 
wall types as part of a standard template, we suggest only adding property values when the users 
may refer to them to make decisions or will not likely change them based on their commonness. 
In addition to these parameters, there are two other type properties that are important to under-
stand: Function and Coarse Scale Fill Pattern. The Function type property of walls is a simple list 
of values, but it can be used in powerful ways. A wall’s function can be used to ﬁlter schedules or 
views—for example, if you wanted to hide interior walls for a series of drawings showing only 
core and shell (exterior) elements. The Function property also affects the default placement behav-
ior when you create new walls. The behaviors associated with each function are as follows:
 
◆
Interior—Default height for new walls is set to the level above the active level.
 
◆
Exterior—Default height is Unconnected: 20′-0″ (8 m).
 
◆
Foundation—Default height is determined as Depth, speciﬁed down from the active level.
 
◆
Retaining—Default height is Unconnected: 6′-0″ (2 m).
 
◆
Sofﬁt—Default height is Unconnected: 1′-0″ (250 mm).
 
◆
Core-shaft—Default height is Unconnected: 20′-0″ (8 m).

530 | CHAPTER 13 CREATING WALLS AND CURTAIN WALLS 
You can also use the Function type property when you export to CAD formats. You can 
export walls of different functions to speciﬁc layers assigned in the Modify DWG/DXF 
Export Setup dialog box, shown in Figure 13.2. Refer to Chapter 7, “Interoperability: Working 
Multiplatform,” for more information on exporting.
Figure 13.2 
Wall functions can be 
assigned to diﬀerent 
layers for exported 
CAD ﬁles.
The Coarse Scale Fill Pattern type property (along with Coarse Scale Fill Color) deﬁnes a ﬁll 
pattern to be applied to the wall type when a view’s Detail Level is set to Coarse. These settings 
are an important tool to help you communicate your designs more effectively. For example, you 
might want to set all the ﬁre-rated wall types to display with a red solid ﬁll for coarse views. 
Using these type properties for walls is a slightly different approach than you might use for 
design plans in which you want all wall types to display with a black solid ﬁll. For the design 
plan approach, you can override the ﬁll pattern for the Walls category in the Visibility/Graphic 
Overrides dialog box for a view or a view template.
When the Detail Level property of a view is set to Medium or Fine, the individual layers of a 
wall type’s structure are visible, including any ﬁll patterns that are assigned to the materials in 
the wall structure (you will learn more about wall structure in the next section of this chapter). 
When Detail Level is set to Coarse, the wall type is displayed only with the pattern deﬁned in 
the Coarse Scale Fill Pattern parameter—if one is deﬁned. This property is best explored with 
the generic masonry wall types in the default project templates.
Create a new project with any Autodesk default project template and then place a wall seg-
ment using the type Generic - 8″ Masonry (Generic - 225 mm Masonry) in a plan view that is 
set to Coarse. You will see that a ﬁll pattern is displayed. What you are seeing is the ﬁll pattern 
that is assigned to the Coarse Scale Fill Pattern type property of the wall—not the pattern that 
is assigned to the material within the wall structure. Select the generic wall segment you just 
created, and in the Properties palette click Edit Type. Change Coarse Scale Fill Pattern to No 
Pattern and then click OK to close all open dialog boxes. No ﬁll pattern will appear for this wall 
type in a coarse view. From the view control bar, set Detail Level to Medium, and you will then 
see the ﬁll pattern as it is deﬁned in the material within the wall structure.

Editing Wall Structures
We will ﬁrst discuss editing a wall type’s structure. To access these settings, click the Edit but-
ton in the Structure parameter ﬁeld. This will open the Edit Assembly dialog box, shown in 
Figure 13.3. From here you can add or delete wall layers, deﬁne their materials, manage the 
layers’ relationship to the core boundaries, and assign functions to each layer. You can also add 
sweeps and reveals or modify the vertical constraints of the layers.

dialog box lets 
you deﬁne the 
construction layers 
of a wall type.
This dialog box is divided into four zones: the Preview window, the Layers table, the Default 
Wrapping option, and the Modify Vertical Structure options (which are active only when the 
preview is set to section display). The area above the Layers zone holds basic reporting about the 
wall type: its family name, sample height in the Preview window, and thickness and thermal 
properties.
Preview Window  On the left side of the dialog box, you will see a graphic preview of the 
wall structure in plan or section. If you did not activate it in the Type Properties dialog box, 
click the Preview button at the bottom of the dialog box. To switch from the default plan view 
to the section view or vice versa, click the drop-down list next to View to choose an alternate 
viewing option. In the preview, the core boundaries of the wall are shown with green lines. 
Note that in the section preview, each wall layer is highlighted in blue when you select a row 
in the Layers table. Also note that you can change the height of the wall shown in the section 
preview by modifying the Sample Height value in the upper-right part of the dialog box. You 
can use any mouse-based navigation method to adjust the preview as well as activate the 
SteeringWheels® feature by clicking the button at the bottom left of the dialog box.
Layers Table  The Layers Table is where you add, delete, move, and deﬁne layers of the 
wall structure. The makeup of the wall is organized in a table, and the Exterior and Interior 
orientation of the wall is identiﬁed at the top and bottom. Each wall layer is represented 

532 | CHAPTER 13 CREATING WALLS AND CURTAIN WALLS 
as a separate row of information. Two of the rows are gray, representing the core boundar-
ies of the wall, which will be discussed in greater detail later in this chapter in the section 
“Creating a Wall Core.” The table is divided into ﬁve columns (Function, Material, Thickness, 
Wraps, and Structural Material):
Function  This column provides six choices for wall layer functions that relate to the 
purpose of the material in the assembly. Each of these functions deﬁnes a priority that 
determines how it joins with other walls, ﬂoors, and roofs. Note that the numeric priority 
is more important to understand than the name of the function itself.
 
◆
Structure [1] deﬁnes the structural components of the wall that should support the 
rest of the wall layers. This function gives the highest priority to a wall layer and 
allows it to join with other structural layers by cutting through lower-priority layers.
 
◆
Substrate [2] deﬁnes continuous board materials such as plywood or particle board.
 
◆
Thermal/Air Layer [3] deﬁnes the wall’s thermal insulation layer and/or an air gap.
 
◆
Finish 1 [4] speciﬁes a ﬁnish layer to use if you have only one layer of ﬁnish.
 
◆
Finish 2 [5] speciﬁes a secondary, less important ﬁnish layer.
 
◆
Membrane Layer is a zero-thickness material that usually represents vapor 
prevention.
With the exception of Membrane Layer, which has no priority assigned, all the other 
layers have a priority value from 1 to 5. These priorities determine how to clean up the 
intersections between various layers when two or more walls are joined. The principle is 
simply explained: Priority 1 is the highest and 5 is the lowest. A layer that has a priority 
of 1 will cut through any other layer with a lower priority (2, 3, 4, or 5). A layer with prior-
ity 2 will cut through layers with priority 3, 4, or 5, and so on. In Figure 13.4, layers with 
the same priority clean up when the two intersecting walls are joined. Notice the way the 
ﬁnish layers don’t join on the right side of the vertical wall, because one has a priority 4 
and the other is priority 5.
Figure 13.4 
Layers with the same 
priority clean up when 
joined.

Material  Associating a material to a wall layer provides graphic (color, cut/surface pat-
terns, and render appearance), identiﬁable (mark, keynote, description, and so on), and 
physical characteristics (for analysis purposes) of each wall layer. Using material takeoffs, 
you can calculate quantities of individual materials used in wall assemblies throughout 
your project. Keynoting and material tagging functionality are also supported through 
wall layers and are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 19, “Annotating Your Design.”
A material deﬁnition also affects cleanup between layers of joined walls. If the priority of the 
layers is the same and the material is the same, the software cleans up the join between these 

USING EXTENDED MODELING TECHNIQUES FOR BASIC WALLS | 533
two layers. If the priority of the layers is the same but the materials are different, the two lay-
ers are separated graphically with a thin line. In Figure 13.5 the structure layer of one of the 
joined walls was simply changed from Metal - Stud Layer to Metal - Stud Layer 2.
Figure 13.5

same priority but dif-
ferent materials. Te 
separation between the 
two layers is indicated 
with a thin line.

Thickness  This value represents the actual thickness of the material. Note that the 
membrane layer is the only layer that has no thickness.
Wraps  Wall layers rarely end with exposed edges at wall ends or wall openings, win-
dows, or doors. This option allows a layer to wrap around other layers when an opening 
or wall end is encountered. Figure 13.6 illustrates the layer wrapping of the outer wall 
layer based on the closure plane deﬁned in the window family. Layer wrapping will be 
covered in greater detail later in this chapter.
Figure 13.6 
Layer wrapping is a 
result of a coordinated 
approach between wall 
layers and hosted fami-
lies such as windows.
Structural Material  This value represents whether the material within the wall assem-
bly is load bearing or structurally signiﬁcant in any way. In the example shown earlier 
in Figure 13.3, you can see that the Structure [1] functional material, Concrete Masonry 
Units, was given a check mark by default.
Default Wrapping  Although you can specify whether each wall layer will wrap in the 
Layers table, you must also specify whether these options are activated at all in the wall type. To 
use this option, you must decide whether the wrapping should occur at openings, wall ends, or 
both. For inserts, you can choose Do Not Wrap, Exterior, Interior, or Both. Similarly, for wall ends 
the options are None, Exterior, and Interior. The default wrapping parameters appear in both the 
Edit Assembly dialog box and the wall’s Type Properties dialog box. Refer to the “Creating Layer 
Wrapping” section in this chapter for more detailed information about wrapping.
Modify Vertical Structure  These settings are available only when you enable the section 
view in the Preview window. In this area of the Edit Assembly dialog box, you can add artic-
ulation to the wall type using any combination of cornices, reveals, trims, and panels. We 
will discuss these in the section “Adding Wall Articulation” later in this chapter.

534 | CHAPTER 13 CREATING WALLS AND CURTAIN WALLS 
In summary, editing a wall type’s structure begins with adding or deleting wall layers. Each 
layer is assigned a priority, material, thickness, and wrapping option. To move layers up and 
down in the table or to add and remove layers, use the buttons at the bottom of the Layers table. 
Next, we will cover some more complex aspects of wall structure in greater detail: wall cores and 
layer wrapping.
Creating a Wall Core
One of the unique functions of a basic wall is its ability to identify a core. The wall core is more 
than a layer of material; in fact, it can comprise several material layers. It deﬁnes the structural 
part of the wall and inﬂuences the behavior of the wall and how it interacts with other elements 
in the model. The core boundaries are references to which you can dimension or constrain 
sketch lines when you use the Pick Walls selection option for ﬂoors, ceilings, or roofs.
The example shown in Figure 13.7 illustrates a sample ﬂoor in Sketch mode where the outer 
core boundary of the wall was selected using the Pick Walls method. The core boundaries of the 
wall are shown as dashed lines for clarity.
Figure 13.7 
A wall’s outer core 
boundary is used to 
deﬁne an edge of the 
ﬂoor.

Sketch Mode
Floor Boundary Edges
When ﬂoors generated with the Pick Walls method intersect the walls that were picked dur-
ing Sketch mode, you will receive a prompt to automatically join the geometry and cut the over-
lapping volume out of the wall.

USING EXTENDED MODELING TECHNIQUES FOR BASIC WALLS | 535
If you click Yes to this message and examine the intersection of the wall and ﬂoor in a  
section view, you will see the result of the joined elements (Figure 13.8). Note that you can  
get the joining prompt to appear again simply by selecting the ﬂoor, clicking the Edit 
Boundary button in the ribbon, and then clicking Finish Edit Mode (green check mark icon). 
If any portion of the selected ﬂoor and related walls still overlap, but are not joined, the 
prompt will be displayed.
Figure 13.8 
Section detail of joined 
wall and ﬂoor slab
Creating Layer Wrapping
To create a layer-wrapping solution for openings that reﬂect real-world conditions, you must 
deﬁne two settings. First, select the layer(s) of the wall structure you want to wrap and check 
the boxes in the Wraps column of the Edit Assembly dialog box. You must then specify the 
default wrapping behavior for the wall type. These default settings can be set in either the Type 
Properties dialog box or Edit Assembly, as shown in Figure 13.9.

options can be set in

Assembly.

536 | CHAPTER 13 CREATING WALLS AND CURTAIN WALLS 
Specifying the layer wrap settings in the wall type alone may not be sufﬁcient to generate 
the graphic results you desire. Another set of rules established in hosted families allows you to 
further customize how layers in a wall will wrap to inserted objects. The following exercise will 
illustrate this functionality.
Begin by opening the ﬁle c13-Wall-Wrapping.rvt or c13-Wall-Wrapping-Metric.rvt 
from this book’s web page, www.sybex.com/go/masteringrevit2018. Activate the Level 1 ﬂoor 
plan, and you should see a wall with an inserted window.
Next, follow these steps to create the wall wrap:
1. Select the wall, open the Properties palette, and click Edit Type.
Notice that Wrapping At Inserts is set to Do Not Wrap and that Wrapping At Ends is set 
to None.
2. Click OK to close the Type Parameters dialog box.
3. Select the inserted window and click Edit Family on the Modify | Windows tab in the 
ribbon.
4. When the Window family opens, go to the Project Browser and activate the ﬂoor plan 
named Floor Line.
You will notice that this window family has been slightly modiﬁed from the original 
Fixed window family in the Revit default library. Two reference planes have been added 
that allow the depth of the window frame and the wall wrapping to be customized.
5. Select the reference plane that is parallel to the window and just below the window panel. 
Its name should be displayed at the right end of the plane as Closure. In the Properties 
palette, ﬁnd the parameter named Wall Closure and make sure the option is checked, as 
shown in Figure 13.10.
Figure 13.10 
Assign the Wall 
Closure parameter to a 
reference plane.

USING EXTENDED MODELING TECHNIQUES FOR BASIC WALLS | 537
6. Create a dimension between the exterior face of the sample wall and the Wall Closure 
reference plane.
You may need to use the Tab key to ensure that you have selected the wall reference and 
not the centerline of the wall or any other extraneous reference plane.
7. Press the Esc key or click the Modify button to exit the dimension command, and select 
the dimension you just created.
8. On the Options bar, ﬁnd the Label drop-down list and choose <Add Parameter…>.
9. In the Parameter Properties dialog box, type Exterior Wall Closure in the Name ﬁeld and 
click OK to close the dialog box.
10. Click Load Into Project from the Family Editor panel in the ribbon. You may be prompted 
to select a project or family if you have more than the two sample ﬁles open. When 
prompted with the Family Already Exists dialog box, select Overwrite The Existing 
Version.
11. In the Level 1 ﬂoor plan of the example project, select the wall and click Edit Type from 
the Properties palette. From the Structure parameter, click Edit.
12. In the Edit Assembly dialog box, ﬁnd row 1, which will have a function of Finish 1 [4] and 
will have the material Masonry - Brick. Make sure the Wraps option is checked.
13. Set the Wrapping At Inserts option to Exterior, and click OK to close both dialog boxes.
You should now see the masonry layer wrapping into the opening in the wall created by 
the inserted window. You can now customize the depth at which the brick will wrap.
14. Select the window and click Edit Type from the Properties palette. Find the Exterior Wall 
Closure parameter and change the value to 0′-6 5/8″ (170 mm).
15. Click OK to close the Type Properties dialog box. Notice how the depth of the wrapped 
masonry layer changes in the plan view.
Adding Wall Articulation
If you need to develop more complex and articulated ﬁnishes expressed horizontally along the 
vertical surfaces of certain walls, you can customize wall types in a variety of ways to achieve 
just about any aesthetic effect. Reveals and sweeps can be added to a wall type, and you can edit 
the vertical extents of material layers. You can ﬁnd a good example of this kind of wall in the 
default project template. The wall type Exterior - Brick and CMU on MTL. Stud (Figure 13.11) 
contains a variety of sweeps, reveals, and vertical modiﬁcations of material layers.

538 | CHAPTER 13 CREATING WALLS AND CURTAIN WALLS 
Figure 13.11 
Sample wall with added 
articulation
To access these settings, select any wall in your project and click Edit Type in the Properties 
palette. You can also ﬁnd the wall type in the Project Browser; double-click it to open the Type 
Properties dialog box. Once it is open, make sure the preview pane is open and the view in 
the preview is set to Section. Within the Type Parameters options, click the Edit button in the 
Structure ﬁeld to open the Edit Assembly dialog box and begin modifying the layers and verti-
cal articulation of the wall type, as shown in Figure 13.12.
Figure 13.12 
With the section 
view active, tools for 
modifying the verti-
cal structure become

USING EXTENDED MODELING TECHNIQUES FOR BASIC WALLS | 539
In the following sections, we’ll examine how to create these types of articulation in your 
wall type. To begin the exercises, download and open the ﬁle c13-Wall-Articulation.rvt 
or c13-Wall-Articulation-Metric.rvt from this book’s web page. There are two samples of 
the Exterior - Brick on Mtl. Stud wall type. You will create a new wall type based on this wall 
throughout the following exercises.
Assigning Two Different Materials on the Finish Face of a Wall
We will begin our series of exercises by creating a new wall type based on an existing layered 
wall structure. Activate the Level 1 ﬂoor plan, select the two wall segments in the exercise ﬁle, 
and then click Edit Type in the Properties palette. In the Type Properties dialog box, click the 
Duplicate button and create a new wall type named Mastering - Wall Exercise. Click OK to 
accept the settings, and click OK to close the Type Properties dialog box.
Now let’s assume that you need to create a partial region of the ﬁnish face where the material 
is different but is of the same thickness. For example, you might want to use a split-face concrete 
block at the base of the wall instead of brick.
1. Activate the default 3D view and select one segment of wall in the view. From the 
Properties palette, click Edit Type, and in the Type Properties dialog box, click the Edit 
button in the Structure ﬁeld to open the Edit Assembly dialog box.
Make sure the Preview pane is open and the view is set to Section.
2. In the upper right of the Edit Assembly dialog box, change the Sample Height value to 
6′-0″ (2000 mm).
Use either the Steering Wheels button at the lower left of the dialog box (also located in 
the upper-right corner of the Preview pane) or your mouse wheel to zoom into the shorter 
segment of wall in the Preview pane.
3. Click the Split Region button under Modify Vertical Structure, and move your mouse 
pointer along the inside face of the brick layer to a point 4′-0″ (1,200 mm) above the bot-
tom of the sample, as shown in Figure 13.13.
When you split the layer, the thickness value of the layer indicates it is variable.
4. Select row 2 in the Layers list and then click the Insert button to add another row imme-
diately below the ﬁrst exterior layer. Change its function to Finish 1 and its material to 
Concrete Masonry Units. To open the Material Browser, select the material assignment 
under the Material column. Using the Graphics tab, set the cut pattern to Masonry – 
Concrete Block. Then click OK to close the Material Browser dialog box.
5. Click the Assign Layers button, select the new row you created in the previous step, and 
then click inside the lower portion of the split region in the section preview.
When the layer is properly assigned to the split region, you will see the ﬁll pattern 
change to diagonal crosshatch.
6. Click OK to close all open dialog boxes and save your project for additional exercises in 
this chapter.

540 | CHAPTER 13 CREATING WALLS AND CURTAIN WALLS 
Figure 13.13 
Splitting the exte-
rior ﬁnish into two 
materials
After you assign a material row to a split layer, you will notice that the thickness values of 
the two layers are linked but you can’t change them in the table. To change the thickness of a 
split wall layer, click the Modify button and select one of the faces in the section preview. Edit 
the temporary dimensions in the section preview to change the thickness of the layer.
You may also notice that once a layer is split and an additional layer is assigned to the split 
portion, the resulting portions can only be the same thickness. In the previous exercise, you split 
a brick masonry layer to create a region of concrete masonry units (CMUs). Although this may 
achieve the desired graphic result in an elevation view, does it accurately represent the construc-
tion of the wall if the CMU is intended to be thicker than the brick masonry? To create a similar 
result with a vertical layer of varying thickness, you will need to create a stacked wall. We will 
discuss this later in the section “Creating Stacked Walls.”
If you encounter a situation where you need to merge horizontal or vertical layers that 
already exist in a wall type, use the Merge Regions button and select a line in the section pre-
view between two layers. Once the mouse pointer is over a line between two layers, an arrow 
indicating which layer will override the other appears, as shown in Figure 13.14.

ers; (b) merge layers

Adding Sweeps and Reveals
Many walls have horizontal articulations that are either attached to or embedded in the wall 
assembly. Cornices, soldier courses, and reveals are examples of elements that can be incorpo-
rated into wall types. To begin adding these, we will continue our previous exercise of creating 
a new wall type named Mastering - Wall Exercise. In the following exercise, you will add a bull-
nose sweep to the wall.
1. Return to the wall’s type properties and open the Edit Assembly dialog box.
2. Click the Sweeps button to open the Wall Sweeps dialog box. Click the Load Proﬁle button 
and open the ﬁle c13-Profile-Bullnose.rfa or c13-Profile-Bullnose-Metric.rfa, 
which can be downloaded from this book’s companion web page.
3. Click the Add button to insert a sweep row. Change the values in the row as follows:
 
◆
Proﬁle: c13-Proﬁle-Bullnose: Type 1
 
◆
Material: Concrete, Precast
 
◆
Distance: 4′-0″ (1,200 mm)
 
◆
From: Base
 
◆
Side: Exterior
 
◆
Cuts Wall: Checked
 
◆
Cuttable: Checked
4. Click Apply and you should see the sweep appear just above the split region, as shown in 
Figure 13.15.
Figure 13.15

542 | CHAPTER 13 CREATING WALLS AND CURTAIN WALLS 
Notice that the loaded proﬁle was created for predictable results when placed in a wall 
assembly. For your own wall, you may need to adjust the offset, ﬂip, and setback values to 
achieve the desired results. Next, you will add a different proﬁle to the same assembly.
5. Click OK to close the Wall Sweeps dialog box. In the Edit Assembly dialog box, change 
the Sample Height value to 12′-0″ (3650 mm) so that the next sweep addition will not 
conﬂict with the one you just added. Adjust the section view as required to see the 
whole wall.
6. Click Sweeps to reopen the Wall Sweeps dialog box. Click Load Proﬁle again and navi-
gate to the default library. From the Proﬁles folder select the Walls folder, and select either 
Cornice-Precast.rfa or M_Cornice-Precast.rfa.
If you cannot locate these ﬁles in your default library, you can download them from this 
book’s web page.
7. Click Add to create another new row and change the values in the row as follows:
 
◆
Proﬁle: Cornice-Precast or M_Cornice-Precast (Metric)
 
◆
Material: Concrete, Precast
 
◆
Distance: 0′-0″
 
◆
From: Top
 
◆
Side: Exterior
 
◆
Offset: –0′-3 5/8″ (–90 mm)
 
◆
Cuts Wall: Unchecked
8. Notice that the order of the rows is automatically adjusted based on the vertical relation-
ship of the sweeps added to the wall. Click OK to close the Wall Sweeps dialog box.
A negative value for Offset was speciﬁed to bring the cornice sweep into the exterior ﬁn-
ish layer. Vertical adjustments can be made by assigning positive or negative values in the 
Distance column.
9. Click OK to close all open dialog boxes, and save the project ﬁle for additional exercises 
in this chapter.
The process to create reveals is almost identical to that used to create sweeps. Simply click  
the Reveals button to open the Reveals dialog box. Experiment with adding your own reveals  
to the wall type you are creating throughout this chapter’s exercises. We have added two  
reveals to the wall assembly (Figure 13.16) using the default Reveal-Brick Course proﬁle family.
In the default 3D view, switch to the Modify tab in the ribbon, and in the Clipboard panel, 
choose the Match Type Properties tool. Click the Mastering - Wall Exercise wall segment. The 
mouse pointer will change to a ﬁlled paintbrush, indicating that an existing type is ready 
to be applied to another object. Select the other wall segment to apply the Mastering - Wall 
Exercise type. When the types of the two wall segments in the exercise ﬁle are matched, you 
will see how nicely the sweeps wrap around corners in a 3D or camera view, as shown in 
Figure 13.17.

Modifying Wall Sweep Returns
In the previous exercises, you learned how to include sweeps and reveals in the assembly of a 
wall type; however, you can also apply a sweep to a wall if it is needed only in a limited loca-
tion. For example, you might need to create a chair rail molding in one special room. To accom-
plish this, go to the Architecture tab in the ribbon and click Wall and then Wall Sweep. You 
can place a sweep on a wall vertically or horizontally by changing the placement option in the 
ribbon while the Wall Sweep tool is active. Select a wall sweep type from the Properties palette, 
and pick the wall faces to which you would like to apply the sweep. If necessary, the sweep can 
be adjusted vertically in an elevation or section view.

Moving Wall Sweeps Between Projects
Although proﬁle families from RFA ﬁles can be used in wall sweep type properties, a wall sweep is 
a system family that exists only in a Revit project. New sweep types can be created only by using 
the Transfer Project Standards tool or by duplicating existing types within your active project. 
Keep in mind that once wall sweeps are added to your project, they can be scheduled like any other 
project component.
We created a sample chair rail sweep on the interior face of the walls in the  
c13-Wall-Articulation.rvt exercise ﬁle. In the default 3D view, orbit the model to view the 
interior faces. Let’s take a look at how to customize the returns of a wall sweep.
1. Select the sweep and it will display grips at each end. Zoom the view closer to the end of 
the sweep that is aligned with the end of the wall segment.
2. Click the Modify Returns button in the contextual tab of the ribbon.
There are some additional settings in the Options bar.
You can change the angle of the return or return it to a straight cut, but for now leave the 
options as Return and Angle = 90°.
3. You will notice that the mouse pointer changes to a knife symbol. Click the end of the 
sweep and then press Esc or use the Modify tool to exit the command.
4. Select the sweep again, and drag the grip at the endpoint you just modiﬁed to adjust the 
length of the sweep return around the corner of the wall.
Figure 13.18 shows how the return can be wrapped around the edge of a wall.

Modeling Techniques for Basic Walls
In the previous sections, we explored methods to create a variation within the structure of a 
basic wall type. When you begin to use these types to assemble your building model, you have 
still more methods at your disposal to further customize how walls are applied. Let’s take a look 
at techniques you can use for modeling basic walls once they are placed in a project. You can use 
some of these techniques for stacked walls and curtain walls as well.
Extending Wall Layers
In many types of construction, you will need layers of materials to extend within or beyond the 
constraints of the wall. Some common examples include the extension of sheathing and siding 
on an exterior wall or gypsum wallboard extending only slightly above the ceiling for interior 
partitions (Figure 13.19).
Figure 13.19 
Examples of wall lay-
ers extending past or 
within the constraints 
of the wall
Enabling the extension of layers within a wall assembly requires you to unlock speciﬁc edges 
in the section preview of the Edit Assembly dialog box. Once layers have been unlocked, an 
instance parameter of the wall becomes active: either Base Extension Distance or Top Extension 
Distance (depending on which edges you unlocked). You can enter this value directly in the 
Properties palette or adjust it graphically in a section view by dragging the small blue tri-
angle control at the edge of the unlocked layer. Let’s go through an exercise to explore this 
functionality:
1. From the Architecture tab of the ribbon, click the Wall: Architectural tool, and from the 
Type Selector, choose either the Generic - 5″ or Generic - 200 mm type. Click Edit Type to 
open the Type Properties dialog box.
2. Click the Duplicate button, and name the new type Exterior Siding.
3. Click Edit in the Structure ﬁeld to open the Edit Assembly dialog box.

546 | CHAPTER 13 CREATING WALLS AND CURTAIN WALLS 
4. Add a new layer to the exterior of the wall; set its function to Finish 1 (4); use the material 
Siding, Clapboard; and assign a thickness of 3/4″ (18 mm).
5. Open the Preview pane and switch to section view. Zoom into the bottom of the wall.
6. Select the Modify button and click the bottom edge of the exterior siding layer. Click the 
padlock icon to unlock the layer (Figure 13.20).
Figure 13.20 
Using the Modify but-
ton, click the padlock 
icon to unlock layers.
You can unlock as many layers as you like; however, the unlocked layers all need to be 
adjacent. For example, you cannot unlock wallboard layers on both sides of a framing 
layer.
7. The siding layer is now unlocked. Click OK to close all open dialog boxes. With the Wall 
tool still active, create a segment of wall in the project using the Exterior Siding type. 
Press Esc or click the Modify button and then select the segment of wall you just created. 
In the Properties palette, you will see that the Base Extension Distance parameter is now 
enabled. Change the value to –10″ (–250 mm) for this parameter and observe the wall in 
the default 3D view.
You will see that the siding layer is now extending 10″ (250 mm) below the base of the 
wall, as shown in Figure 13.21.
8. Create a section view that intersects this wall segment and then set the Detail Level in the 
section view to Medium or Fine. Select the wall, and you will see grips at the base of the 
wall indicating the layers that can be modiﬁed (Figure 13.22).
You can drag the controls to the required offset or use the Align tool to set the unlocked edge 
to another reference object. If you use the Tab key to select just the edge, you can use the Move 
tool to set a precise distance as well.
There are also controls for layers that are locked. Editing the wall with a control of a locked 
layer changes the Base Offset or Top Offset value and will automatically adjust any Base 
Extension or Top Extension distances you previously established.

Editing Wall Joins
In another common design and construction scenario, you may need to speciﬁcally control how 
two or more walls behave when they intersect. There are a number of ways to customize these 
occurrences. Let’s examine two scenarios where wall joins may need to be edited: phasing con-
ditions and acute angled corners.

548 | CHAPTER 13 CREATING WALLS AND CURTAIN WALLS 
When you create a model for a renovation of an existing building, you will likely create ele-
ments that are existing, demolished, and new. In the example shown in Figure 13.23, a new wall 
and a wall to be demolished are intersecting an existing wall. Notice that the walls are cleaning 
up with each other as they normally would if they were all in the same phase.
Figure 13.23 
Wall joins will clean up 
by default regardless of 
phasing.
Existing
New
Demolished
If you would like to change the graphic behavior of the new and demolished walls when they 
intersect the existing wall, follow these steps:
1. Select the new or demolished wall. Right-click the grip control at the end of the wall you 
would like to modify and select Disallow Join.
This will cause the walls to overlap, as shown in Figure 13.24.
Figure 13.24 
Walls with disallowed 
joins will overlap.
2. To complete the operation, you can use the Trim/Extend Single Element or Trim/Extend 
Multiple Elements tool, or simply drag the endpoints of the walls to create the most 
appropriate intersecting condition (Figure 13.25).

USING EXTENDED MODELING TECHNIQUES FOR BASIC WALLS | 549
For walls that meet at an acute angle, you can use the Edit Wall Joins tool to control the reso-
lution of the intersection.
1. From the Modify tab in the ribbon, locate the Geometry panel and select the Wall 
Joins tool.
2. Hover your mouse pointer over an intersection of two walls at an acute angle. You will 
see a box appear around conditions that can be modiﬁed with this tool (Figure 13.26).
3. In the Options bar, you will see a number of choices to help you customize the joining 
condition between the walls related to the selection.

Use Trim/Extend or 
drag wall endpoints 
to complete the 
modiﬁcation.

wall conditions.
4. To cycle through the available options, choose one of the joining types (Butt, Miter, or 
Square Off) and then click the Previous or Next button. Figure 13.27 shows some options.

USING EXTENDED MODELING TECHNIQUES FOR BASIC WALLS | 551
Modifying Wall Profiles
An important extended modeling technique for walls is the ability to customize the elevation 
proﬁle of a wall segment. There are two ways you can accomplish this: by attaching the wall’s 
top or base to another element or by editing the sketch proﬁle of the wall. You can apply these 
methods to basic walls, stacked walls, and curtain walls.
To attach a wall to another element, select a wall segment and you will see the Attach Top/Base 
button in the contextual Modify tab. Once this command is activated, select either Top or  
Base and then pick an object. Walls can be attached to roofs, ceilings, ﬂoors, reference planes, 
and even other walls. Figure 13.28 shows a stacked wall that has been attached to a curvilinear 
roof by extrusion.
Figure 13.28 
Stacked wall attached 
to an extruded roof
When you use the attach method, be mindful of how the software treats walls that are 
attached to other objects. After you use this method, the instance parameters Top Is Attached 
and Base Is Attached will show the status of the selected wall’s attachment. These are read-only 
parameters and are for information only. Be aware that the top constraint and any other offset or 
height value will not display the actual height of the wall when it is attached to something. For 
example, if a wall whose base constraint is Level 1 and top constraint is Level 4 is attached to a 
ﬂoor slab on Level 2, the wall’s top constraint will still be listed as Level 4 in the Properties pal-
ette. This variance does not affect other calculations such as wall length, area, and volume.

Automatically Attaching Walls to Floors
When you create a standard ﬂoor by sketching a boundary, the ﬂoor is hosted on a speciﬁc level. 
After you complete the boundary sketch and ﬁnish the editing mode, Revit oﬀers you some help 
to attach walls to the ﬂoor. Any wall whose top constraint is the level on which the ﬂoor is hosted 
can be automatically attached to the bottom of the ﬂoor.
continues

552 | CHAPTER 13 CREATING WALLS AND CURTAIN WALLS 
The other method of modifying wall proﬁles is to edit the sketch proﬁle of the wall. To do 
this, select a wall and click the Edit Proﬁle button in the contextual Modify tab. This will open a 
Sketch mode in which you can draw a new boundary for any edge of the wall shape, as shown 
in Figure 13.29. Click Finish Edit Mode to complete the operation.
Figure 13.29 
Te sketch elevation 
boundary for a stacked 
wall instance is edited.
Creating Custom In-Place Walls
If you are working on traditional architecture, restoration of historic buildings, or free-form 
design, you may need to create walls that are irregular in shape. The Model In-Place tool, 
found in the Component drop-down list on the Architecture tab, lets you create any wall style 
independent of the constraints of the layer structure described in the previous sections of this 
chapter. Figure 13.30 shows an example of such a wall created with the solid geometry tools also 
found in the Family Editor.
continued
As a bonus, you can access this functionality at any time—not just when you create a ﬂoor. If you 
forgot to attach the walls to the ﬂoor when you ﬁrst modeled the ﬂoor, simply select the ﬂoor and 
then click Edit Boundary. Click the Finish Edit Mode button, and you should be prompted to attach 
walls to the ﬂoor.

CREATING STACKED WALLS | 553

You can refer to Chapter 15, “Designing with the Family Editor,” to explore the various mod-
eling techniques available in the Model In-Place mode. Remember that the selection of the fam-
ily category is important to the behavior of the custom geometry. Select the Walls category to 
allow your custom elements to be scheduled with other walls and to place hosted elements such 
as doors and windows.
Creating Stacked Walls
Walls in a building—especially exterior walls—are often composed of several wall types 
made out of different material combinations and with different widths that stack one on top 
of another over the height of the façade. Because these walls usually sit on top of a founda-
tion wall, you would likely want to establish an intelligent relationship among the different 
wall assemblies so the entire façade acts as one wall (for example, when the foundation wall 
moves and you expect walls on top of the foundation to also move). This is where stacked 
walls can help.
Stacked walls allow you to create a single wall entity composed of different wall types 
stacked on top of each other. Before you can create a stacked wall, you will need to download 
some basic wall types into your project. So, follow these steps to download a variety of stacked 
walls and then modify one of them:
1. Download and open the ﬁle c13-Stacked-Walls.rvt or c13-Stacked-Walls-Metric.rvt 
from this book’s web page. Activate the Level 1 ﬂoor plan view.
2. From the Architecture tab in the ribbon, pick the Wall tool and select Stacked Wall: 
Exterior - Brick Over Block W Metal Stud (you can ﬁnd stacked wall types at the bottom 
of the list in the Type Selector). Draw a segment of wall in the Level 1 ﬂoor plan and then 
exit the Wall command.
3. Select the wall segment, and in the Properties palette click the Edit Type button. Click the 
Duplicate button to create a new stacked wall named Mastering Stacked Wall.
4. Click the Edit button in the Structure ﬁeld to open the Edit Assembly dialog box. Open 
the preview pane and set the view to Section.

554 | CHAPTER 13 CREATING WALLS AND CURTAIN WALLS 
When you are editing the stacked wall type, you will notice that the Edit Assembly dia-
log box (Figure 13.31) is slightly different than when you are working with a basic wall. 
Rather than editing individual layers, in this dialog box you are editing stacked wall 
types and their relationships to each other.
Figure 13.31 
Te Edit Assembly 
dialog box for  
stacked walls
5. Click the Insert button to add a new wall to the stacked wall assembly. A new row 
appears in the list and allows you to deﬁne a new wall. Select the Generic - 12″ (Generic - 
300 mm) wall type from the Name list, and enter a Height value of 10′-0″ (3 m) (the Width 
value is not important in this exercise).
6. At the top of the dialog box, ﬁnd the Offset drop-down list and change the setting to 
Finish Face: Interior.
This will align the interior faces of the stacked walls and allow you to use the Offset ﬁeld 
in the Types table to adjust each stacked wall type in a predictable manner.
7. Select the row of the generic wall type by clicking the row’s number label at the left side 
of the table. Click the Variable button to allow the wall to vary in height to adjust with 
varying level heights.
Note that one row must have a variable height, but only one row in the assembly can be 
assigned as such. All others must have a speciﬁc height value.
8. Go back to the Level 1 ﬂoor plan and draw a new wall with the Mastering Stacked Wall 
type, setting its top constraint to Level 3 in the Options bar or in the Properties palette.
9. Cut a section through the model, and change the heights of Level 1 and Level 3 to see the 
effect this has on the wall (make sure the level of detail in the section is set to Medium so 
you can see the layers of the wall).

CREATING STACKED WALLS | 555
You will see that changing Level 2 does not change the bottom walls because they are  
of a ﬁxed height; however, changing the height of Level 3 changes the height of the vari-
able wall.
At any time, you can break down a stacked wall into its individual wall types. To do this, 
select a stacked wall, right-click, and select Break Up. Once a stacked wall is broken up, the 
walls become independent, and there is no way to reassemble them back to a stacked wall. The 
base constraint and base offset of each subwall are the same as the stacked wall. For example, if 
the stacked wall was placed on Level 1, the base constraint for an upper subwall would still be 
Level 1, with the height difference accounted for in the wall’s Base Offset parameter. This can be 
modiﬁed in the Properties palette if necessary.
The following important notes about stacked walls are from the Revit user’s guide (from the 
section “Vertically Stacked Wall Notes”):
 
◆
When you create a wall schedule, vertically stacked walls do not schedule, but their sub-
walls do.
 
◆
When you edit the elevation proﬁle of a stacked wall, you edit one main proﬁle. If you 
break up the stacked wall, each subwall retains its edited proﬁle.
 
◆
Subwalls can host sweeps; stacked walls cannot.
 
◆
Subwalls cannot be in different phases, worksets, or design options from those of the 
stacked wall.
 
◆
To place inserts such as doors and windows in a stacked wall, you may need to use the Pick 
Primary Host tool to switch between subwalls composing the stacked wall. For example, 
the door shown in Figure 13.32 is outside the upper wall because the main host of the door 
is the bottom subwall.
Figure 13.32 
Inserts may not host 
correctly in vertically 
stacked walls.
To place the door properly, select it and then choose Pick Primary Host from the Modify | 
Doors tab in the Host panel. Place your mouse pointer over the wall and select the upper sub-
wall (you may need to press the Tab key to select the correct component). The door will then be 
properly hosted in the upper wall, as shown in Figure 13.33.

Creating Simple Curtain Walls
Curtain walls and curtain systems are unique wall types that allow you to embed divisions, 
mullions, and panels directly into the wall. They have a distinct set of properties yet still share 
many characteristics of basic walls. A curtain system has the same inherent properties as a cur-
tain wall, but it is used when you need to apply a curtain wall to a face. Curtain systems are 
usually nonrectangular in shape, such as the glazed dome shown in Figure 13.34.
Figure 13.34 
Glazed dome created 
with a curtain system
Before we explore the creation and modiﬁcation of curtain wall types, you should become 
familiar with the fundamental components of this object type in Revit. A curtain wall is deﬁned 
by the following elements and subcomponents:

CREATING SIMPLE CURTAIN WALLS | 557
The Curtain Wall  A curtain wall is drawn like a basic wall and is available in the Type 
Selector when the Wall tool is activated. It has top and bottom constraints, can be attached 
to roofs or reference planes, can have its elevation proﬁle edited, and is scheduled as a wall 
type. When a curtain wall is selected in a model, the overall curtain wall deﬁnition is dis-
played as a dashed line with extensions at both ends of the segment.
The dashed line of the overall curtain wall deﬁnition represents the location line of the wall. 
This is important if you are placing a curtain system on a face because the placement will be 
based on the location line. The location line of a curtain wall also determines the measure-
ment of the room area. Even if the Room Area Computation option is set to Wall Finish, a 
room’s area will be measured to a curtain wall’s location line.
So, how do you adjust the location line of a curtain wall? This is accomplished by modifying 
the offsets in the mullions and panels you assign to a curtain wall or system. We will cover 
this process in the section “Customizing Curtain Wall Types” later in this chapter.
Curtain Grids  These are used to lay out a grid, deﬁning the physical divisions of the cur-
tain wall. You can lay out grids freely as a combination of horizontal and vertical segments, 
or they can be predeﬁned in a curtain wall’s type properties in regular spacing intervals. 
Figure 13.35 shows a freely designed layout of curtain grids and expressive curtain panels in 
between.
Figure 13.35 
Curtain wall with regu-
lar orthogonal grids 
and expressive curtain 
panels

558 | CHAPTER 13 CREATING WALLS AND CURTAIN WALLS 
Mullions  These represent the structural proﬁles on a glass façade, and they follow the 
curtain grid geometry. Mullions can be vertical or horizontal and can be customized to any 
shape based on a mullion proﬁle family. Offsets speciﬁed in a mullion’s type properties affect 
how the mullion is placed relative to the curtain wall’s location line.
Curtain Panels  These ﬁll in the space between the curtain grids. Offsets in a curtain pan-
el’s type properties determine how the panel is placed relative to the curtain wall’s location 
line. Curtain panels are always one of the following:
Empty Panels  No panel is placed between the grids.
Glazed Panels  These can be made out of different types of glass that can have any color 
or transparency.
Solid Panels  Panels can be created with custom geometry in the Family Editor and can 
include anything from doors and spandrels to shadow boxes and solar ﬁns.
Wall Types as Inﬁll  When you have a panel selected, you can also choose a basic wall 
type from the Type Selector to ﬁll the space between the curtain grids. All wall types in 
the project will be available for your selection. An example of this application would be 
interior ofﬁce partitions in which the lower portion is a standard wall and glass panels 
ﬁll the upper portion.
Designing a Curtain Wall
Let’s go through a quick exercise to become familiar with the creation of a simple curtain wall. 
To create a curtain wall, you can either model a standard wall and change its type to Curtain 
Wall or select a curtain wall type from the Type Selector when the Wall tool is active. To begin 
the exercise, create a new project and follow these steps:
1. From the Architecture tab in the ribbon, select the Wall tool. From the Type Selector (in 
the Properties palette) select Curtain Wall 1.
2. In the Level 1 ﬂoor plan, draw a single curtain wall. Go to a 3D view to see the result.
The basic curtain wall deﬁnition has no predeﬁned grids or mullions. The wall seg-
ment you see is just one big system panel that you will need to divide. If you create a 
curved segment for a curtain wall, the panels are always straight segments. Thus, if 
you draw a curved segment in the plan with the Curtain Wall 1 family, there will be 
only one straight panel segment between the endpoints of the curve until you start to 
divide it up with curtain grids. Revit does not allow for curved glazing outside of a 
custom family.
3. Divide the wall into panels using the Curtain Grid tool from the Architecture tab. 
Position your mouse pointer over the edges of the wall to get a preview of where the grid 
will be placed (select a vertical edge to place a horizontal grid or select a horizontal edge 
to place a vertical grid).
There are some snapping options when you are placing curtain grids that will help you 
divide the panels and subsequent divisions at midpoints and thirds. Watch the status bar 
for snapping prompts because there are no graphic indicators of the snapped positions 
other than the mouse pointer pausing. Place grids on the wall segment so that you get 
something like the wall shown in Figure 13.36.

CREATING SIMPLE CURTAIN WALLS | 559

manually applied grids
4. From the Architecture tab, select the Mullion tool.
Notice that you can select from a variety of mullion types in the Type Selector; however, 
the default choice is adequate for this exercise. At the right end of the ribbon, you will 
see the Placement panel with three options for placing mullions: Grid Line, Grid Line 
Segment, and All Grid Lines. You can place mullions on the curtain wall using any of 
these methods. Give them a try to see how they work.
Replacing Panels and Mullions
Next, you will replace panels in the wall you just created. As we explained earlier, panels are 
subcomponents of the overall curtain wall, so you may need to press the Tab key to select a 
panel and view its properties. Special selection tools for curtain walls are available in the con-
text menu when you highlight a mullion or a panel.

panels:
1. In a 3D view, select one of the glazing panels in the narrow horizontal band (press the 
Tab key to select it if necessary).
2. Right-click and choose Select Panels ➣ Along Horizontal Grid, as shown in Figure 13.37.

type is in the same family as the Solid panel).

Customizing Curtain Grid Segments
In the last part of this exercise, you will practice the techniques for adding or removing seg-
ments of curtain grids to reﬁne your curtain wall design.
Understanding the Curtain “Grid”
One important fact to remember when working with curtain grids is that they are always implied 
across the extent of the curtain wall. When we say they are implied, we mean they are not neces-
sarily expressed on all panel segments. In other words, although a curtain grid is always expressed 
from one end of the wall to the other, you can decide whether the grid divides every panel it crosses.
To become more familiar with this technique, you will add a curtain grid to the midpoint of 
the right-center panel and delete the division between the two panels to the left of the added 
grid, as shown in Figure 13.38.
Figure 13.38 
Individual grid lines 
are added or deleted to 
further customize the 
design.

562 | CHAPTER 13 CREATING WALLS AND CURTAIN WALLS 
Follow these steps:
1. Begin by activating the Curtain Grid tool from the Architecture tab. In the Placement 
panel at the right end of the ribbon, click the One Segment button. Hover your mouse 
pointer over the bottom edge of the right-center panel and snap to the midpoint of the 
panel (Figure 13.39).
Figure 13.39 
A single segment is 
added to the center 
panel of the curtain 
wall.
2. The second step is tricky. You do not continue creating another division in the short panel 
above the center panel. Instead, press the Esc key or click the Modify tool to exit the 
Curtain Grid command. Select the vertical grid line you created in step 1 (you may need 
to press the Tab key until you see the dashed line indicating the curtain grid).
Notice that the grid extends the entire height of the wall (Figure 13.40).
3. With the curtain grid selected, click the Add/Remove Segments button in the Modify | 
Curtain Grids panel of the Modify tab. Pick the segment of the curtain grid that passes 
through the short panel. Press the Esc key, and you should see that the short panel is also 
split in half.

Select the curtain 
grid in order to add or 
remove individual seg-
ments along it.
4. Activate the Mullion tool and place mullions on the division between the two center pan-
els, as shown in Figure 13.41.
5. Press the Esc key or click Modify. Select and delete the horizontal mullion between the 
two left panels (this step is optional).

the narrow band and click the Add/Remove Segments button in the ribbon. Click the 
segment in the left-center panel.
If you did not delete the mullion in step 5, a warning will appear prompting you to delete 
the mullion segment. The result should look like the wall shown in Figure 13.42.

CREATING SIMPLE CURTAIN WALLS | 565
Placing Doors in Curtain Walls
In the next exercise of this topic, you will swap one of the curtain panels for a door panel. Door 
families for curtain walls can be found in the Doors folder of the Revit default library, but they 
behave differently than regular doors. The height and width of the curtain wall door are driven 
by the curtain grids—not the type properties of the door. Follow these steps:
1. From the Insert tab on the ribbon, locate the Load From Library panel and click the Load 
Family button. Navigate to the Doors folder of the Revit default library and load the 
Door-Curtain-Wall-Double-Glass.rfa or M_Door-Curtain-Wall-Double-Glass.rfa 
family.
If you can’t ﬁnd these default families, you can download them from this book’s  
web page.
2. Zoom into the bottom-middle panel in your curtain wall. Delete the mullion under this 
segment, as shown in Figure 13.43. (You don’t want to have a tripping hazard at your 
door!) Remember, you may have to press the Tab key to select the mullion.
Figure 13.43 
Delete the mullion 
below the panel where 
the door will be placed.
3. Select the bottom-middle panel and go to the Type Selector. Find the door family you just 
loaded and select it from the list so the results look like the wall in Figure 13.44. (Once 
hosted, if you only see the glass door panels and do not see the door hardware, change 
the view’s Detail Level to Fine.)
The door swing can be adjusted in plan as with any other door.

Placing Corner Mullions
Revit includes special mullions to be used at the corners of two curtain walls. These mullion 
types are unique in that only one is needed to connect two wall segments. In the default proj-
ect template, you will ﬁnd four corner mullion types, as shown in Figure 13.45: (a) V Corner 
Mullion, (b) Quad Corner Mullion, (c) L Corner Mullion, and (d) Trapezoid Corner Mullion.

(d)
Corner mullions cannot be customized beyond the shapes included in the Revit project tem-
plate; however, you can modify the material assigned to the mullions as well as the offset and 
depth dimensions in the type properties. When you use corner mullions between two segments 
of curtain wall, they will automatically adjust to the angle between the segments, as shown in 
Figure 13.46.
Figure 13.46 
Corner mullions adapt 
to angles between cur-
tain wall segments.

CREATING SIMPLE CURTAIN WALLS | 567
Before you place a corner mullion, make sure the endpoints of the two curtain wall segments 
are cleanly connected. You can drag the endpoint controls of the walls or use the Trim/Extend 
To Corner tool. To place a corner mullion, simply use the Mullion tool and select one of the cor-
ner edges of either one of the wall segments. If you have already placed a regular mullion at the 
end of a curtain wall segment, select the mullions along the vertical edge and then use the Type 
Selector to choose a corner mullion type. Remember that you can use the context menu (right-
click and select Mullions ➣ On Gridline) to make the selection easy.
Customizing Curtain Wall Types
In the previous exercises, you learned the fundamental techniques of building a simple but cus-
tom curtain wall design. To reap some additional productivity from the curtain wall tool, you 
can predeﬁne almost all the properties necessary to generate a complete curtain wall assembly 
simply by placing the wall in your project. In the following sections, we will examine one of the 
curtain wall types included with the default project template.
Download and open the ﬁle c13-Simple-Curtain-Wall.rvt or c13-Simple-Curtain-Wall-
Metric.rvt from this book’s web page. Switch to a 3D view, and you will see that the wall 
already has vertical and horizontal divisions along with mullions placed on the divisions, as 
shown in Figure 13.47.
Figure 13.47 
Sample curtain wall 
storefront type
Select the sample of storefront wall in the exercise ﬁle and click the Edit Type button in the 
Properties palette. The settings that drive the generation of this type of wall are relatively easy 
to understand. Let’s review some important options related to these properties:
Automatically Embed  When you enable this option, any instance of this curtain wall type 
will embed itself inside other wall segments. This is useful for modeling extended areas of 
ribbon or strip glazing (Figure 13.48) instead of using a window family.

568 | CHAPTER 13 CREATING WALLS AND CURTAIN WALLS

Te Automatically 
Embed option allows 
curtain walls to be 
placed inside basic 
walls.
Join Condition  This option deﬁnes the behavior of the mullion joins. It can be one of the 
following:
 
◆
Not Deﬁned (join conditions can be overridden as necessary)
 
◆
Vertical Grid Continuous
 
◆
Horizontal Grid Continuous
 
◆
Border And Vertical Grid Continuous
 
◆
Border And Horizontal Grid Continuous
Display In Hidden Views  This option allows you to control the graphic display of indi-
vidual components over several views. The options for this can be one of the following:
 
◆
Edges Hidden By Other Members (the default)
 
◆
Edges Hidden By Element Itself
 
◆
All Edges
 
◆
None
Grid Pattern: Layout  There are four options to deﬁne how the vertical and horizontal grids 
will be arranged in your curtain wall:
Fixed Distance  The most common setting, which allows you to specify spacing be-
tween gridlines. Leftover panel segments must be accounted for in the overall length of 
the wall.
Fixed Number  Divides the wall segment into equally spaced panels. When you select 
this option, the Spacing parameter becomes disabled. In its place, a new integer param-
eter named Number will appear in the instance properties.
Maximum Spacing  Indicates the maximum spacing distance. Curtain panels will be 
equally divided over the length of the wall segment, not to exceed the Spacing value.
Minimum Spacing  Indicates the minimum spacing distance. Curtain panels will be 
equally divided over the length of the wall segment, no smaller than the Spacing value.

CREATING SIMPLE CURTAIN WALLS | 569
Mullions  This option allows you to specify the mullions that will be automatically applied 
to the curtain wall. Corner mullions can be applied to either Border 1 or Border 2 for the ver-
tical mullions, but use them carefully—their resolution at corners will depend on how you 
construct your wall segments. For example, if you deﬁne a corner mullion for Border 1 and 
none for Border 2, you must construct all curtain wall segments of this type in a uniform 
direction. If you model one wall segment from left to right and another from right to left, you 
will have overlapping mullions at one corner and none at the other corner.
Modifying Pinned Panels and Mullions
You may have already noticed that when a panel or mullion is selected from a predeﬁned cur-
tain wall type, it appears with a pushpin icon. This indicates that this element is part of a system 
and cannot be changed without additional action.
To change or delete a predeﬁned panel or mullion in a curtain wall instance, select the  element 
and click the pushpin icon. The icon will change to a pushpin with a red X next to it. At this point, 
you can change the element using the Type Selector or delete it (only mullions can be deleted).
Pin with Care
Be careful when you attempt to unpin elements from a curtain wall because you cannot re-pin 
back to the predeﬁned system. Within the active Revit session, you may be able to return to an 
unpinned curtain wall element and still ﬁnd the unpinned icon. Tis allows you to ﬁx any acci-
dental unpinning, but once your project is closed and reopened, you can no longer re-associate the 
unpinned elements.
Creating Custom Curtain Panels
A curtain panel does not have to be conﬁned to a simple extrusion of glass or solid material. You 
can create any kind of panel family to satisfy your design requirements. When creating a new 
panel, be sure to select the Curtain Wall Panel.rft or Metric Curtain Wall Panel.rft 
family template ﬁle. The width and height of the panel are not explicitly speciﬁed in the fam-
ily; instead, the outermost reference planes will adapt to the divisions in the curtain wall into 
which the panel is embedded. If required, you can adjust the panel geometry to offset within 
or beyond the reference plane boundaries in the family. This is useful for creating butt-glazed 
curtain wall assemblies. The following feature contains examples of situations where you might 
want to consider custom curtain wall panels.
Nesting Curtain Models
Generic models can be nested in a curtain panel family.
Spider Fittings and Sunshades  In the example shown here, two instances of the spider 
component are placed on one edge of the panel. Visibility parameters are assigned to the 
two spider ﬁttings that enable either the top or bottom spider to be displayed as needed. Te 
continues

570 | CHAPTER 13 CREATING WALLS AND CURTAIN WALLS 
spider ﬁttings were downloaded from RevitCity.com, and the sunshade is a Kawneer model 
1600 SunShade – Planar, downloaded from BIMObject® (http://bimobject.com).
Spandrel and Shadowbox  Often in glazing applications, the spacing of horizontal mem-
bers will consist of a pattern including a narrow band or spandrel to mask the ﬂoor and 
ceiling sandwich. Revit software does not currently have the ability to deﬁne two spacing 
values, but you can create the spandrel or shadowbox in a single panel family. In the example 
shown here, the spandrel height is a type property of the custom panel family. Standard 
mullions are applied to the wall.

CREATING COMPLEX CURTAIN WALLS | 571
Louvers  Our last example shows how metal louvers can be embedded in a curtain panel 
family. Te image shown here is a panel developed with a nested generic model. Te louver 
ﬁns are arranged in a parametric array within the generic model, and then the generic model 
is placed in the panel. Te edges of the louver array are constrained to the reference planes in 
the panel. Tis parametric louver curtain panel was downloaded from RevitCity.com.
Creating Complex Curtain Walls
Often at the early stages of design, as an architect or designer you need to be able to model cur-
tain wall systems that indicate more complex design intent. These systems need to be ﬂexible 
and light enough to allow you to explore design iteration, but they also need to be robust and 
detailed enough to be useful as your project moves from concept to design development and 
then on to fabrication.
In Revit you can build complex curtain walls using massing tools. There are two potential 
workﬂows. You can model your curtain wall system directly within the project environment 
from massing forms, or you can build it as a family within a conceptual design environment. 
Both of these methods are quite similar, but we prefer to use the conceptual design environment 
because the complexity of modeled elements, such as adaptive components, is better managed in 
a ﬁle that is separate from the project environment.
Project Environment  You can build your forms directly within your project environment 
using the in-place massing tools. When walls are constructed through the In-Place Mass tool, 
the conceptual design environment does not have 3D reference planes and 3D levels.
Essentially, to create a complex curtain wall within the project environment, you follow these 
simple steps:
1. Create an in-place mass in the project environment.
2. Divide the surface.

572 | CHAPTER 13 CREATING WALLS AND CURTAIN WALLS 
3. Apply a surface pattern.
4. Replace the surface pattern with a pattern-based curtain panel family.
Conceptual Design Environment  You create your curtain wall designs in the Revit con-
ceptual design environment (CDE), which is a type of Family Editor. These forms reside 
outside the project environment. You can then reference these massing families into a project 
environment, allowing you to explore contextual relationships with the building form.
To create a complex curtain wall within the conceptual design environment, you are going to 
follow these simple steps:
1. Build a new conceptual mass in the Family Editor.
2. Divide the surface.
3. Apply a surface pattern.
4. Replace the surface pattern with a pattern-based curtain panel family.
5. Load it into your project.
You start by designing a conceptual form that will represent the shape and form of the sur-
face of the curtain wall. You are then able to subdivide the surface of this form using a grid 
system, referred to as a UV grid. A UVW coordinate system is used to plot location across the 
surface, as surfaces are not always planar (ﬂat). This grid system automatically adjusts, follow-
ing the natural contours of a nonplanar surface or form. The UV grid is then used as a guide 
for applying a pattern to the surface. You can investigate how you might panelize the surface to 
make it constructible by applying a geometric pattern to it. This pattern provides a basic graphic 
representation of how the panel may look. These graphic patterns can then be replaced with 
parametric components that automatically conform to the divided surface.
Dividing the Surface
Let’s take a look at the basic tools that will allow you to divide the surface of a concep- 
tual form.
1. Start by opening c13-Square-Panel.rfa from this book’s web page.
This ﬁle represents a simple conceptual shape for a curtain wall design (Figure 13.49). 
The form was constructed by drawing two curves at varying reference levels, and then a 
surface was generated between them.
2. Select the form and then click Divide Surface on the contextual tab in the ribbon.
This will divide the surface of the form, and you will see horizontal and vertical grids 
displayed. This is the UV grid.
You can control the display of the UV grid when it is selected (Figure 13.50). To modify 
the display, click the U Grid or V Grid button in the UV Grids And Intersects panel on the 
Modify | Divided Surface tab of the ribbon.

design
Figure 13.50 
A surface of the con-
ceptual form has been 
divided and the UV 
grid is displayed.
3. With the surface selected, make sure the U Grid and V Grid icons are highlighted in the 
contextual tab of the ribbon.
Notice how the Options bar provides a number of settings for you to modify the divided 
surface. You can control the U grid and V grid by a number or with a speciﬁc distance. 
If you select the Number option, you can enter a number of divisions that will distribute 
evenly across the surface.

574 | CHAPTER 13 CREATING WALLS AND CURTAIN WALLS 
4. Select Distance, which will allow you to enter a speciﬁc absolute distance between grids 
across the divided surface. Under the Distance setting, there is a drop-down menu that 
also allows you to specify a Maximum Distance or a Minimum Distance value; these are 
similar to the constraints described earlier in this chapter for basic curtain walls. Make 
sure the surface is divided by number, with a U grid of 10 and a V grid of 10.
5. With the UV grid selected, you will see a 3D control (x-, y-, and z-axis arrows), and an 
icon appears in the center of the surface. Click the icon to enable the Conﬁgure UV Grid 
Layout command. The display will change (Figure 13.51), and you can now apply speciﬁc 
settings to control the UV grid even further.
Figure 13.51 
To conﬁgure the UV 
grid, click the icon 
at the center of the 
surface.
You have the ability to alter the rotation of the grid, the UV grid belt, and the justiﬁcation 
of the UV grids at the surface borders. These grid conﬁguration parameters can also be 
found and modiﬁed in the Properties palette.
6. In the Properties palette, set the U Grid Rotation value to 45 degrees and the V Grid 
Rotation value to 45 degrees; then click Apply.
Notice how the modiﬁed values are updated in the 3D view with the Conﬁgure UV Grid 
Layout command activated.
In the Conﬁgure UV Grid Layout mode (Figure 13.52), you will see a number of controls—
all of which relate to parameters you can also access in the Properties palette. The arrow 
cross in the middle of the grid is the grid justiﬁcation marker. You can drag it to any side or 
corner or the center of the grid, which will adjust the value of the Justiﬁcation property of 
both U and V grids.
The belts represent the lines along the surface from which the distance between grids is mea-
sured. The distance is measured by chords, not curve lengths, and can be seen in the Properties 
palette as the Belt Measurement parameter for both U and V grids.

Properties palette.
Dividing the Surface with Intersects
As you saw in the previous exercise, the Divide Surface tool allows you to divide the surface of a 
form using the natural UVW grid of the surface. However, if you want to divide the surface with 
a customized grid pattern, you divide it by intersecting geometry. By using the Intersect feature, 
you can divide the surface based on the following:
 
◆
Intersecting levels, reference planes, and even lines drawn on a reference plane
 
◆
A mixture of U or V grids and intersects
Let’s take a look at an example based on our previous ﬁle, which will demonstrate how you 
can use a series of deﬁned reference planes to divide a surface.
1. Start by opening the ﬁle c13-Square-Panel-Intersects.rfa from this book’s web page.
Notice that a series of reference lines are now drawn in the X plane; you will use these 
reference lines to divide the surface of the form.
2. Select the surface and choose Divide Surface from the ribbon. Click the U Grid tool on the 
ribbon to disable the display of the U grids.
3. With the surface still selected, click the Intersects button on the ribbon. Select all the 
reference planes in the X plane and then click the Finish icon in the Intersects panel on 
the ribbon.
This will divide the surface based on where the reference planes intersect the surface of 
the form. You could also select Intersects ➣ Intersects List to choose named references 
such as levels or named reference planes instead of picking them in the model view.
4. Go to the Project Browser and open the 3D view named 3D Surface to review the results 
(Figure 13.53).

and lines.
Applying Patterns
Surface patterns allow you to quickly preview in a graphical manner how a panel will work 
across the surface of the form. The editing and adjustment to the design concept are quick, 
because you are not working with complex geometry at this stage. Revit provides a number of 
predeﬁned patterns that are available from the Properties palette, and they can be applied to 
your divided surface. You will now apply a surface pattern to a form:
1. Start by opening c13-Square-Panel-Pattern.rfa from this book’s web page. Divide the 
surface following the steps from the previous exercise.
2. With the UV grid on the form selected, you will notice in the Type Selector that the 
default empty pattern named _No Pattern is applied to the surface. Open the Type 
Selector, and you will see that you can apply one of a number of predeﬁned patterns to 
the surface. Click the Rectangle Checkerboard Pattern type to apply it to your surface 
(Figure 13.54).
3. Experiment with the various predeﬁned patterns and adjust the UV grid as required to 
play with the proportions of the patterns.
At any time, you can display both the underlying surface divisions and the pattern surface. 
With the grid selected, click the Surface button in the Surface Representation panel on the 
Modify | Divided Surface tab. This display should give you a better understanding of the rela-
tionship between the pattern deﬁnition and the spacing of the surface divisions.

CREATING COMPLEX CURTAIN WALLS | 577
Editing the Pattern Surface
There will be situations where you will want to edit and control the border conditions for pattern 
surfaces. Patterned surfaces may have border tiles that intersect the edge of a surface, and they may 
not end up as complete tiles. You can control the border tile conditions by setting them to Partial, 
Overhanging, or Empty in the Border Tile instance property of the patterned surface. You will now 
modify a conceptual curtain wall to examine how the different border conditions affect the surface.
1. Start by opening c13-Square-Panel-Border.rfa from this book’s web page.
2. Select the surface, and in the Properties palette, locate the Border Tile parameter under 
Constraints. Set the value to Empty, and click Apply or drag the mouse out of the 
Properties palette.
Notice that the tiles at the borders are no longer visible, as shown in Figure 13.55.
Figure 13.54

Checkerboard Pattern

3. Next, change the Border Tile parameter to Overhanging and click Apply.
The border tiles will now show in their entirety, extending beyond the edge of the surface.

578 | CHAPTER 13 CREATING WALLS AND CURTAIN WALLS 
Editing a Surface Representation
When editing a surface in the conceptual design environment, you have the option to choose 
how surface elements will be displayed. A number of options are available to you, allowing 
you to customize how you show or hide the various elements that make up a divided surface 
in a view. If you select either the U or V Grid icon, this will enable or disable the UV grid in 
the view. The Surface icon allows you to display the original surface, nodes, or grid lines. The 
Pattern icon allows you to hide or display the pattern lines or pattern ﬁll applied to the sur-
face. The Component icon allows you to hide or display the pattern component applied to the 
surface. If you decide to make any changes to the display using the Surface Representation 
tools, these changes will not carry through into the project environment. To globally show or 
hide surface elements, you will have to alter this from the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dia-
log box.
In the Surface Representation panel, you will also notice a small arrow in the bottom-right 
corner. Clicking this arrow will open the Surface Representation dialog box, where you will ﬁnd 
additional display options for the surface, patterns, and components. You also have the ability 
to display nodes and override the surface material of the form. Let’s practice controlling the sur-
face representation of your form.
1. Start by opening c13-Square-Panel-SurfaceRep.rfa from this book’s web page.
2. With the surface selected, go to the Surface Representation panel in the ribbon, and 
click the arrow in the bottom-right corner to open the Surface Representation dialog box 
(Figure 13.56).
Figure 13.56 
Use the Surface 
Representation 
dialog box to further 
customize the display 
of your form.
3. On the Surface tab, enable Nodes if is not already enabled; this will display a node at each 
intersection of the UV grid, as shown in Figure 13.57.

CREATING COMPLEX CURTAIN WALLS | 579
Figure 13.57 
Nodes are displayed at 
the intersections of the 
U grids and V grids.
Adding Deﬁnition
So far, you have created a surface, subdivided it, and applied a graphical representation to the 
form. You can now begin to add actual component geometry similar to mullions and panels. 
Although the underlying graphic pattern will remain, the component geometry will take pre-
cedence. To begin this process, you will create special curtain panel families using the Curtain 
Panel Pattern Based.rft or Metric Curtain Panel Pattern Based.rft family template. 
This type of panel family can be applied to the divided surface to populate it with architectural 
components, adding realistic deﬁnition to your conceptual curtain wall surface.
Building a Pattern-Based Panel Family
In the following exercise, you will build a simple rectangular panel and apply it to your divided 
surface:
1. Click the Application menu, choose New ➣ Family, and select the Curtain Panel 
Pattern Based.rft or Metric Curtain Panel Pattern Based.rft family template.
Figure 13.58 shows the pattern-based curtain wall family template, which consists of a 
grid, a series of reference lines, and adaptive points. The grid is used to lay out the pat-
tern of the panel. The adaptive points and reference lines act as a rig, deﬁning the layout 
of the panel. You can construct solid and planar geometry within and around the refer-
ence lines to form the panel.
When a panel is applied to a divided surface, the points in the panel adapt to the UV grid, 
and the panel will then ﬂex accordingly. As a general rule, the grid pattern in your cur-
tain panel family should match the pattern on the divided surface to which it is applied. 
For example, if you have applied a hexagonal pattern to your divided surface, make sure 
the curtain panel family is also using a hexagonal pattern.

580 | CHAPTER 13 CREATING WALLS AND CURTAIN WALLS 
Figure 13.58 
Te rig in the pattern-
based curtain panel 
family
2. You now need to decide what pattern you will use for the component. To change the pat-
tern, select the grid, go to the Type Selector, and change the pattern to Rhomboid. Notice 
how the adaptive points and reference lines update to reﬂect the change. Review the vari-
ous patterns that are available to you. Revert to the Rectangular pattern.
Modeling a pattern-based curtain panel is similar to how you would sketch and construct 
a form within the conceptual design environment. You use points, lines, and reference 
lines to construct geometry.
3. Select one of the adaptive points and drag it. These points move only vertically, not 
horizontally.
As you move the point, the reference lines attached to the point will alter the shape. 
Therefore, as you build geometry on the deﬁned reference lines and an adaptive point is 
moved or adjusted, the reference lines are altered, and the geometry constructed along 
the reference lines updates to reﬂect the change.
4. To reset the adaptive points to the grid, select the grid and you will notice a Reset Points 
To Grid button in the Options bar. Click the button to reset the points.
5. Select the four reference lines and click the Create Form ➣ Solid Form button in the ribbon. 
Two icons now appear in the middle of the model view (Figure 13.59), giving you the option 
to create an extruded form or a ﬂat planar surface. Select the icon for the planar surface.
Figure 13.59 
Geometry options are 
presented when you  
are using the Create 
Form tool.

CREATING COMPLEX CURTAIN WALLS | 581
6. Next, you will ﬂex the geometry to test its consistency. Select one of the adaptive points 
and move it vertically. Observe how the geometry ﬂexes, as shown in Figure 13.60, and 
then reset the points to grid.
Figure 13.60 
Te panel form will ﬂex 
when the points are 
dragged vertically.
7. Switch to the Architecture tab in the ribbon, and from the Draw panel, select the Point 
Element tool. Place a point on one of the reference planes, as shown in Figure 13.61. This 
point becomes a hosted point; observe how its symbol is smaller than the symbol for the 
adaptive points. Select the point, and from the Properties palette change the value of the 
Show Reference Planes parameter to Always.
Figure 13.61 
A reference point is 
placed on one of the 
reference lines.
This will make it easier to build geometry using the hosted point in later steps.
8. From the Architecture tab and the Work Plane panel, click the Set button (Set Work Plane 
tool) and pick the work plane of the hosted point.
9. Draw a circle with a radius of 6″ (150 mm) on the work plane of the hosted point, as 
shown in Figure 13.62.

582 | CHAPTER 13 CREATING WALLS AND CURTAIN WALLS 
Figure 13.62 
Draw a circle on the 
vertical work plane of 
the hosted point.
It can be a little tricky drawing the circle onto the active work plane of the hosted point. 
Therefore, use the Show Work Plane tool to display the active work plane for the point. 
This will make the process of sketching the circle easier.
10. Select the circle and the four default reference planes, and then choose Create Form ➣ 
Solid Form.
This will sweep the circle proﬁle along the four reference planes, as shown in Figure 13.63.
Figure 13.63 
Creating a form from 
a circle and four refer-
ence lines
When building your curtain panels, consider how you will assign geometry to appropri-
ate subcategories. This will ensure that you have full control over the elements from a 
visual and graphical point of view. For details on assigning geometry to subcategories, 
refer to Chapter 16, “Creating Stairs and Railings.”
11. Save the family as Square-CWPanel.rfa.

CREATING COMPLEX CURTAIN WALLS | 583
Changing Patterns with Geometry
It is important to understand that if you decide to switch your curtain panel grid pattern after 
creating solid forms, the geometry will not automatically adapt to the new pattern you choose. 
Te geometry will be left orphaned, and you will need to delete any geometry and remodel based 
on the new pattern.
Applying Components to a Divided Surface
Now that you have created a pattern-based curtain panel family, you will need to load this fam-
ily into your conceptual mass family and apply it to the divided surface, replacing the graphical 
pattern with the actual component.
1. Download and open the ﬁle c13-Square-CWSystem.rfa from this book’s web page.
2. Load the family ﬁle Square-CWPanel.rfa you created in the previous exercise into this 
ﬁle by clicking Load Family on the Insert tab of the ribbon, or switch to that ﬁle and click 
the Load Into Projects button.
3. In the conceptual mass ﬁle, select the pattern and divided surface. In the Properties 
palette, click the Type Selector, and scroll down the list until you ﬁnd the name of your 
pattern-based curtain panel family.
Your new panel family will be listed under the pattern within which it was designed. The 
component will now be applied to the patterned surface, as shown in Figure 13.64. Note 
that the more complex the surface and component, the longer it will take to load.
Figure 13.64 
Te pattern-based cur-
tain panel component 
is applied to a surface

family.
Creating a Pyramid Curtain Wall Pattern-Based Family
Now that you have mastered the technique of constructing a simple planar curtain panel, let’s 
look at how to create a pyramid type panel. You will add a type parameter to your pyramid cur-
tain panel so that you can vary the apex of the panel.
1. Start a new family using the Curtain Panel Pattern Based.rft or Metric Curtain 
Panel Pattern Based.rft family template.

584 | CHAPTER 13 CREATING WALLS AND CURTAIN WALLS 
2. Place a reference point, ensuring that it snaps to the middle of one of the reference lines 
included within the template. Place another reference point on the reference line opposite 
the one you previously placed, as shown in Figure 13.65.
Figure 13.65 
Hosted points are 
placed at the midpoint 
of two reference lines.
3. From the Architecture tab in the ribbon, click the Reference tool and ensure that 3D 
Snapping is activated in the Options bar. Draw a reference line between the two newly 
placed hosted reference points, as shown in Figure 13.66.
Figure 13.66 
A reference line is 
drawn between two 
hosted points.
4. Place another reference point, so that it becomes hosted, at the midpoint of the previously 
created reference line (Figure 13.67). Select this reference point, and from the Properties 
palette, make sure that Show Reference Planes is set to Always.
5. From the Architecture tab, choose the Set Work Plane tool and select the work plane of 
the hosted point at the middle of the previously drawn line. Activate the Reference Line 
tool and uncheck the 3D Snapping option. Draw a reference line vertically in the Z plane 
from the hosted point.
Ensure that the start point of the reference line is locked to the hosted point. You may 
need to drag the end of the reference line, nearest to the point, in the Z direction before 
dragging it back to the hosted point. This will ensure that the lock symbol will appear.

6. Select the vertical reference line to display the temporary dimension, and turn this into a 
permanent dimension by clicking the dimension icon.
7. Select this dimension and then choose <Add New Parameter…> from the Label pull-
down in the Options bar. Assigning this dimension to a parameter will allow you to alter 
the apex of the pyramid panel as needed. In the Parameter Properties dialog box, name 
the parameter Apex_Height. Click OK to close all open dialog boxes.
8. Add a series of reference lines using the 3D Snapping option from the apex to the four 
points on the base of the pyramid, as shown in Figure 13.68.
Figure 13.68 
Reference lines are cre-
ated from the corners 
to the apex.
9. You will now create faces on each slope to complete the pyramid shape. To do this, select 
one reference line from the base and two reference lines on the sloping edges (use the Ctrl 
key to add lines to your selection), and click the Create Form button. Select the planar 
triangular face rather than the extrusion (Figure 13.69).

10. Repeat step 9 for the three remaining faces until you have a completed pyramid, as 
shown in Figure 13.70.

All four sides of the 
pyramid have been

11. It is important that you ﬂex the pyramid to check that you can control the height of the 
apex. Open the Type Properties dialog box, and you will see the parameter named Apex_
Height. Change the value a few times and click Apply after each change. The pyramid 
panel should change in height. Save your ﬁle as Pyramid-Panel.rfa.
12. Open the ﬁle c13-Pyramid-Project.rfa from this book’s web page. Load your 
Pyramid-Panel.rfa family into the ﬁle c13-Pyramid-Project.rfa. Select the surface, 
go to the Type Selector, and choose Pyramid-Panel.
Your pyramid shape curtain panel will now be populated across the divided surface, as 
shown in Figure 13.71.

Creating Custom Patterns
Although Revit includes a variety of patterns you can use for conceptual curtain walls, cur-
rently there is no way to create your own pattern-based curtain panel template. The current 
patterns shipped with the software are hardwired, so there is no way to modify them either; 
however, with a bit of creative thinking, you can use the provided templates to construct panels 
that will conform to a custom pattern concept. When you consider building a custom panel, it 
is important to take into account how it will repeat vertically and horizontally. You will need to 
break it down into its smallest module. If you think about a repeating architectural pattern such 
as a masonry wall, its individual component can be broken down into the brick that forms that 
pattern, which, in essence, is a rectangle. Figure 13.72 shows an example of a hexagon-shaped 
panel, constructed within a rectangular pattern.
Figure 13.72 
A hexagonal panel is 
constructed within a 
standard rectangular 
pattern.
Once you have decided on the design for your panel, look at how the panel could be modu-
larized. To do this, consider laying out the pattern utilizing graph paper. This will certainly help 
you better understand the layout before attempting to construct the panel using an appropriate 
template. In Figure 13.73, you can see the hexagonal panel applied across a divided surface.

Limiting the Size of Pattern-Based Families
When designing complex curtain wall systems, the goal is to limit the variety of panels. The 
more variety you have, the higher the cost because you have to create a greater number of 
unique panels. When you divide a surface, the panel sizes can vary quite dramatically. Although 
you do not actually have the ability to limit panel sizes, you can start to reduce the size and vari-
ety of panels by nesting curtain panels inside other panels. In the following exercise, you will 
learn how to nest panels to limit size variation:
1. Start by creating a simple pattern-based curtain panel family (use either Curtain Panel 
Pattern Based.rft or Metric Curtain Panel Pattern Based.rft). Make sure the 
grid is set to the Rectangular type.
2. Select the four reference lines and use the Create Form tool to generate a planar 
surface.
3. Similar to the previous exercise, place a hosted point on one of the edges of the surface, 
and then draw a circle with a 6″ (150 mm) radius on the point’s work plane. Use Create 
Form to generate a swept proﬁle on two edges to represent a mullion, as shown in 
Figure 13.74. Save this panel as Limit-Panel-1.rfa.
4. Start another new pattern-based curtain panel family, again using the Rectangular grid 
pattern. Select the four reference planes, and use Create Form to generate a planar surface 
rather than an extrusion.
5. Select the planar surface and click the Divide Surface tool from the ribbon. You will 
divide this surface and set the UV grid by number; set U Grid to 2 and V Grid to 2, as 
shown in Figure 13.75.
6. Load the Limit-Panel-1 family into the divided surface panel.
7. Select the divided surface and apply your panel to the divided surface by choosing 
Limit-Panel-1 from the Type Selector. This will nest the panel into the subdivisions of the 
divided surface (Figure 13.76). Save this panel as Limit-Panel-2.rfa.

You can now apply this nested panel into any divided surface. Download and open the 
ﬁle c13-Limit-Panel-Project.rfa from this book’s web page.
8. In the c13-Limit-Panel-Project.rfa ﬁle, select the pattern and divided surface. From 
the Type Selector, select the name Limit-Panel-2.
Your new panel family will be listed under the pattern within which it was designed. It 
will take a few seconds for the software to replace the pattern with the real geometry of 
the panel. But observe that by nesting the panel inside other panels, you have been able to 
limit the size and variety of the panels (Figure 13.77).

ing the nested panel is

Using the Adaptive Component Family
So far, the examples look at using the UV grid to nest in curtain wall pattern–based families; 
however, there will be situations where you may want to manually place a panel, speciﬁcally at 
border conditions where you may need to construct custom panels. To do this, use the Adaptive 
Component functionality that is available to you in the pattern-based curtain panel. This func-
tionality is designed to handle cases where components need the ﬂexibility to adapt to many 
unique, related conditions. This functionality also addresses the problems of creating and plac-
ing pattern component panels (triangular, pentagonal, hexagonal, and so on) on nonrectangular 
and irregularly spaced grids. In the following exercise, you will create an adaptive panel and 
manually place it along the border of a divided surface:
1. Create a simple pattern-based curtain panel family (Curtain Panel Pattern Based.rft 
or Metric Curtain Panel Pattern Based.rft) and use the rectangular grid pattern. 
Select each of the four adaptive points and notice that each point has a number from 1 to 4.
2. Select one of the points; from the Properties palette, change the Show Placement Number 
parameter to Always.
3. Select all the reference planes in the family and choose Create Form; select the Planar 
Surface option. Save this panel as My Adaptive Panel.rfa.

CREATING COMPLEX CURTAIN WALLS | 591
4. Download and open the ﬁle c13-StitchSurface-Project.rfa from this book’s web page.
5. Load the My Adaptive Panel.rfa family into c13-StitchSurface-Project.rfa.
Notice that in c13-StitchSurface-Project.rfa the UV grid has been enabled, as well 
as the nodes at the intersections of the UV grid (Figure 13.78). You will use these nodes to 
snap your panel.
Figure 13.78 
Sample surface with 
nodes displayed
6. Locate the Families category in your Project Browser and expand the Curtain Panel tree. 
You will ﬁnd the My Adaptive Panel type in this list. Drag it into the 3D view window.
7. With the panel attached at your mouse pointer, place the pointer onto one of the nodes on 
the subdivided surface to place the ﬁrst point. Place the remaining points onto the corre-
sponding nodes, as shown in Figure 13.79.
Observe how the panel will adapt based on its placement in the surface division.

592 | CHAPTER 13 CREATING WALLS AND CURTAIN WALLS 
Scheduling Pattern-Based Panels
Now that you have completed the design of your pattern-based curtain wall families, you may 
want to use Revit scheduling capabilities to assess the quantity and area of panels in your con-
ceptual curtain wall system. This can be useful for calculating approximate costs at the early 
stages of design. You can schedule panels that have been applied to an in-place mass directly in 
the project environment; however, it is not possible to schedule panels in the conceptual design 
environment. You will ﬁrst have to load your concept mass into a project, where you will then be 
able to schedule the panels. In this example, you will open a sample ﬁle, load it into a project, and 
then create a schedule, which will list all the panels that make up your conceptual curtain wall:
1. Download and open the ﬁle c13-Square-Panel-Schedule.rfa from this book’s web page.
2. Start a new project using either default.rte or MetricDefault.rte; then load the ﬁle 
c13-Square-Panel-Schedule.rfa into your new project.
3. From the Massing & Site tab in the ribbon, click the Place Mass button and select 
c13-Square-Panel-Schedule from the Type Selector. Make sure that the Place On 
Workplane icon is selected in the Placement panel, and place the massing component in 
the Level 1 ﬂoor plan.
4. Open the default 3D view to view your model (Figure 13.80).
Figure 13.80 
A conceptual curtain 
wall is loaded into a 
project and placed 
using Place Mass.
5. From the View tab in the ribbon, click Schedules and then click Schedules/Quantities. 
This will open the New Schedule dialog box. Select Curtain Panels from the Category list 
and click OK.

THE BOTTOM LINE | 593
6. You will now deﬁne the ﬁelds that will be included within your panel schedule. Choose 
Family in the left column and click the Add Parameter(s) button to add this ﬁeld to your 
schedule. Next, add Area and then Count.
7. Click the Sorting/Grouping tab and check the options for Grand Totals and Itemize Every 
Instance.
8. Click the Formatting tab and select the Area ﬁeld. Make sure the Calculate Totals option 
is selected. Do the same for Count.
9. Click OK, and your schedule will be created. If you scroll down to the bottom of the 
schedule, the total area and the number of custom panels in your conceptual curtain wall 
will be listed.

 Chapter  14 
 Modeling Floors, Ceilings, 
and Roofs 
 Floors, ceilings, and roofs, which may seem like simple building components, can sometimes 
prove to be difﬁ cult to model and detail in your project designs. In the previous chapter, you 
learned about creating and customizing walls. Many of the objects in this chapter depend on 
walls and curtain walls to deﬁ ne their boundaries, but both groups of object types are system 
families that use a built-up set of layers that are applied to a sketched form. Whereas walls 
mostly rely on a linear path, ﬂ oors, ceilings, and roofs rely on a boundary sketch.

 Understanding Floor Types 
Floors are likely to be one of the ﬁ rst sketch-based elements you will encounter in Autodesk ® 
Revit ® software. Some families in the default libraries are ﬂ oor hosted, so you must ﬁ rst have 
a ﬂ oor before you’ll be able to place such components. Consequently, ﬂ oor-hosted components 
will be deleted if the ﬂ oor that hosts them is deleted. You can ﬁ nd a more detailed discussion on 
creating families in Chapter  15 , “Designing with the Family Editor,” but for now let’s review the 
fundamental types of ﬂ oors that can exist in a project: a ﬂ oor, a structural ﬂ oor, a ﬂ oor by face, 
and a pad. 
 Modeling a Floor 
The traditional ﬂ oor object is a sketch-based element that comprises any number of material 
layers as deﬁ ned by the user. The top of the ﬂ oor object is its reference, also known as top of 
slab (TOS), with respect to the level on which it was created. As such, changes to a ﬂ oor’s struc-
ture will affect its depth down and away from the level. You can start modeling ﬂ oors with 
generic types, which contain a single layer, and then change the generic ﬂ oors to more speciﬁ c 
assemblies later in the development of your project. You can use ﬂ oors in a variety of ways to

meet the needs of a speciﬁc phase of design. In early phases, for example, you can create a ﬂoor 
type to represent the combined ﬂoor, structure, plenum, and ceiling assemblies of a building. 
Commonly referred to as the sandwich, a sample is shown in Figure 14.1.
Figure 14.1 
You can use a single 
ﬂoor type to show  
the entire ﬂoor/ 
ceiling sandwich in  
the early design.
During intermediate phases of design, you can model ceilings so the ﬂoor types can include 
only the ﬂoor and a structural layer, as shown in Figure 14.2. Columns may be created, but more 
precise horizontal structural framing may not be modeled yet. The layer within the ﬂoor type 
represents an assumption of the maximum depth of structural framing.
Figure 14.2 
Tis ﬂoor assembly 
includes an assump-
tion for the depth of 
structural framing.

UNDERSTANDING FLOOR TYPES | 597
In later phases of documentation approaching and including construction, ﬂoors should be 
modeled as close to actual conditions as possible. You should accommodate detailed ﬁnish con-
ditions for ﬂoors as well as coordination with a resolved structural system. Accurate modeling 
of these conditions will help support consistent quantity takeoffs and interference detection. 
Figure 14.3 illustrates an example of a more accurate ﬂoor slab.
Collaboration and the Ownership of Floors
Whether or not you are working under an integrated project delivery (IPD) contract, the so-called 
ownership of ﬂoors should be carefully considered for the collaboration process between an architect 
and a structural engineer. Floors can be one of the most contentious elements of a building design 
because they can be simultaneously construed as architecture and structure.
Te model element author (MEA) for ﬂoors should be discussed and clearly deﬁned for each phase in 
your project BIM execution plan. Remember that element ownership can pass between the architect 
and the structural engineer when it is appropriate for a given phase. For example, the architect may 
choose to be the MEA for ﬂoors in schematic design but pass ownership to the structural engineer 
in design development and construction documentation.
Figure 14.3 
Floor assemblies for 
construction should 
be accurate and sepa-
rate from structural 
framing.
These ﬂoor assembly types are offered as suggestions for the sake of increased productiv-
ity. As such, they should be used with care, especially when performing quantity takeoffs for 
estimating. For example, the area of a ﬂoor will be the only accurate value to be extracted from 
a ﬂoor sandwich model in early design, not a volumetric material takeoff. For more information 
on the use of models by other disciplines, we recommend referring to the AIA document G202-
2013 Project BIM Protocol Form, which lists authorized uses of a model at various levels of devel-
opment. You can learn more about AIA contract documents at www.aia.org.

598 | CHAPTER 14 MODELING FLOORS, CEILINGS, AND ROOFS 
With a basic understanding of ﬂoors as elements of the building, let’s look at some properties 
of ﬂoors that allow expanded uses in the project model. These properties and ﬂoor types can 
help expand your use of ﬂoor systems to create better documentation.
Creating a Structural Floor
The structural ﬂoor is similar to a traditional ﬂoor but has structural functionality, such as the 
ability to indicate span direction and to contain structural proﬁles. For example, you can specify 
a composite metal deck proﬁle, which will display in sections and details generated within your 
project. You can create a structural ﬂoor by selecting the ﬂoor element and clicking the instance 
property called Structural (Figure 14.4). Because Structural is an instance property, any ﬂoor 
type can become a structural ﬂoor.
Figure 14.4 
Structural parameter 
in a ﬂoor’s instance 
properties
After you select the Structural parameter check box for a ﬂoor, you can edit its type proper-
ties to add a structural decking layer. Let’s create a new structural ﬂoor so you can explore how 
this is done:
1. Open the ﬁle c14-Floors-Start.rvt or c14-Floors-Start-Metric.rvt from the book’s 
web page (www.sybex.com/go/masteringrevit2018), and activate the Level 3 ﬂoor plan.
2. Go to the Architecture tab in the ribbon, and from the Build panel, select Floor ➢ Floor: 
Structural.

UNDERSTANDING FLOOR TYPES | 599
3. In the Draw panel of the contextual tab in the ribbon, make sure your options are set to 
Boundary Line with the Pick Walls tool, as shown in Figure 14.5.
Figure 14.5 
Use Pick Walls mode to 
draw boundary lines.
4. In the Options bar, specify an offset of 0′-3″ (75 mm).
This setting will place the ﬂoor boundary just within the inner face of the curtain wall 
mullions because the location line of the curtain wall is at the center of the mullions that 
are 5″ (125 mm) deep.
 
5. Begin picking the exterior curtain walls by selecting one of the north-south–oriented 
walls ﬁrst.
The ﬁrst wall that you pick will determine the span direction of the structural ﬂoor. You 
can change this at any time by picking the Span Direction tool from the Draw panel and 
then selecting one of the boundary lines in the ﬂoor sketch.
 
6. Pick the remaining exterior walls to complete the ﬂoor boundary.
After you ﬁnish deﬁning the boundary lines of the ﬂoor, you will create a new ﬂoor type. 
If the Properties palette is not open, press Ctrl+1 on the keyboard, type PP, or click the 
Properties icon in the ribbon.
 
7. Click Edit Type in the Properties palette. Select Generic - 12″ or Generic - 300 mm as the 
active type and click Duplicate. Name the new type Structural Slab.
 
8. In the Edit Type dialog box, click the Edit button in the Structure row to open the Edit 
Assembly dialog box.
 
9. In the Edit Assembly dialog box, ﬁnd the layer of the assembly that represents the generic 
ﬂoor you duplicated. This should be row 2. Change the material of this layer to Concrete – 
Cast-In-Place Concrete and change the thickness to 0′-6″ (150 mm).
 
10. Select row 3 and click the Insert button. There should now be four layers. Select the new 
row 3 and set its function to Structural Deck [1].
The new Structural Deck properties appear below the layers, as shown in Figure 14.6.
 
11. The value for Deck Proﬁle should default to Form Deck_Non-Composite: 2′ × 6″ or  
M_Form Deck_Non-Composite: 50 × 150 mm. Once you conﬁrm this proﬁle, click OK  
for the Edit Assembly and Type Properties dialog boxes.
If you do not have a structural deck proﬁle loaded, ﬁnish the ﬂoor by selecting Finish 
Edit Mode. Then select the Insert tab of the ribbon, and click Load Family. In your default 
Autodesk content library, ﬁnd the Profiles folder and open the Metal Deck subfolder. 
Pick an appropriate deck proﬁle and click Open to load it. Select the Structural Slab ﬂoor 
and click Edit Type in the Properties palette to continue the exercise.

12. Activate Wall Section 1 and you should see the completed slab at Level 3.
Notice that you do not see the details of the structural decking when Detail Level is set to 
Coarse.
If you activate the callout at Level 3 (Detail At Level 3), you will see the structural decking 
because the callout’s detail level is set to Medium. This difference is illustrated in Figure 14.7.

tion to Structural Deck

options.

UNDERSTANDING FLOOR TYPES | 601
Cantilevered Metal Decking
In Figure 14.7, you can see the metal decking proﬁle shown in a section view; however, when metal 
deck runs parallel to a support member, the decking cannot cantilever as shown by default when 
you model a ﬂoor. You must customize these slab edges to show a more accurate representation of 
the decking condition.
One easy way to accomplish this is to use the Cantilever options when you are creating or editing 
the boundary lines of the ﬂoor. If you are using a ﬂoor type that includes a Structural Deck layer, 
select any of the boundary lines and you will see Cantilever settings in the Options bar.
If you deﬁne the boundary line at the centerline of the supporting member, deﬁne the cantilever 
value for Steel to be 0′-0″ (0 mm) and Concrete to be the value appropriate to your engineered 
design. Sometimes these values may need to be negative distances to achieve the desired cantilever 
condition. When you ﬁnish the sketch and observe the slab edge in a section view, you will see 
a more accurate representation of the appropriate construction technique for the ﬂoor element.

602 | CHAPTER 14 MODELING FLOORS, CEILINGS, AND ROOFS 
Modeling Floor by Face
This ﬂoor modeling method is used when you have generated an in-place mass or loaded a mass 
family. After you assign mass ﬂoors to a mass, you can use the ﬂoor-by-face method to assign 
and manage updates to ﬂoors, as shown in Figure 14.8. This type of face-based modeling is dis-
cussed in greater detail in Chapter 9, “Advanced Modeling and Massing.”
Deﬁning a Pad
A pad is technically not a ﬂoor but has properties similar to a ﬂoor. What differentiates a pad 
is its ability to cut into a toposurface and deﬁne the lowest limits of a building’s basement or 
cellar. If desired, you can conﬁgure the pad to represent a slab on grade, as shown in Figure 14.9. 
The Pad tool can be found on the Model Site panel of the Massing & Site tab. If you do not see 
this tab, you can access it by clicking the Application button and choosing Options ➢ User 
Interface.

SKETCHING FOR FLOORS, CEILINGS, AND ROOFS | 603
For a more detailed exercise on creating building pads, refer to Chapter 3, “The Basics of the 
Toolbox.”
Sketching for Floors, Ceilings, and Roofs
Because ﬂoors, ceilings, and roofs are sketch-based objects, the method you use when creat-
ing the boundary lines is critical to the behavior of the element to those around it. The recom-
mended method is to use the Pick Walls option.

604 | CHAPTER 14 MODELING FLOORS, CEILINGS, AND ROOFS 
By selecting the walls to generate the sketch for the roof, you are creating a parametric rela-
tionship between the walls and the roof. If the design of your building changes and the wall 
position is modiﬁed, the roof will follow that change and adjust to the new wall position with-
out any intervention from you (Figure 14.10).

and the roof changes to

Also notice in Figure 14.10 that the illustrated roof was generated with overhangs beyond the 
exterior faces of the walls. You can specify an overhang or offset value for a ﬂoor, ceiling, or roof 
in the Options bar before picking walls to deﬁne the sketch.
If your building design is using curtain walls, be careful with the location lines of these walls. 
The location line of a curtain wall is deﬁned relative to the offsets speciﬁed in the mullion and 
panel families that make up the curtain wall type. As discussed in Chapter 13, “Creating Walls 
and Curtain Walls,” you have many options when deﬁning the relative location line of your cur-
tain wall types. Refer to the exercise in the section “Creating a Structural Floor” earlier in this 
chapter for an example of picking curtain walls with an offset based on a centered location line.

MODELING SLAB EDGES | 605
Modeling Slab Edges
Slab Edge is a tool that allows you to create thickened portions of slabs typically located at the 
boundaries of ﬂoors. A slab edge type is composed of a proﬁle family and a material assign-
ment. It is important that the material assignment of the slab edge match that of the ﬂoor to 
which you will apply the slab edge to ensure proper joining of geometry. Let’s explore the  
application of a slab edge to a ﬂoor at grade.
1. Open the ﬁle c14-Design-Floor.rvt from the book’s web page and activate the 3D view 
named Floors Only.
2. Click the Architecture tab in the ribbon and select Floor ➢ Slab Edge from the Build panel.
This tool is also available from the Structure tab.
3. If necessary, orbit the 3D view so that you can see the bottom of the lowest ﬂoor slab. Pick 
all four bottom edges of the ﬂoor slab at the level named Ground.
4. Activate the view Section 1 and you will see the slab edge applied to and joined with the 
ﬂoor, as shown in Figure 14.11.
Remember that the material in the slab edge type must match the material in the ﬂoor 
type properties for the geometry to join properly.

Making Early Design Models
When you ﬁrst start implementing BIM in early phases of the design, the need to emulate draft-
ing methods is often needed to align the schemes with drawing conventions. As a design idea is 
created, there is usually a need to make some generic assumptions about more complex systems to 
make the overall design intent as clear as possible. How do you translate this so-called conceptual 
design into a building information modeling process?
continues

606 | CHAPTER 14 MODELING FLOORS, CEILINGS, AND ROOFS 
Creating a Custom Floor Edge
You can apply a great deal of ﬂexibility to a ﬂoor assembly in early design. As we described 
previously, you can create a ﬂoor for early design phases that accommodates the ﬂoor, structure, 
plenum, and ceiling in a single ﬂoor type. You can also apply a customized edge to this type of 
assembly for more creative sofﬁt conditions at exterior walls, as shown in Figure 14.12.
To bridge the gap between conceptual design and a highly accurate model, we created a single ﬂoor 
type that contained assumptions not only for the ﬂoor but also for the structure and ceiling assem-
bly below. Tis larger assembly gives a graphic emphasis to building sections without the burden 
of modeling three diﬀerent systems before they are close to being resolved. Te design ﬂoor type 
also gave us the opportunity to create custom slab edges that are voids instead of solids—voids 
that approximate a design for ceiling shade pockets or other interface conditions.

Customized edge

assembly in early

Let’s run through a short exercise so you can practice this skill.

from the previous exercise and activate the view Section 1.
2. Select the ﬂoor at Level 1 and open the Properties palette. Change the type to Design

Component ➢ Model In-Place from the Build panel.
4. Set the Family Category to Floors and specify the name as Floor Edge-L1.

MODELING FLOOR FINISHES | 609
Modeling Floor Finishes
You can apply ﬂoor ﬁnishes in a variety of ways. Most methods are based on the thickness of the 
ﬁnish material. For example, a thin ﬁnish such as carpet might be applied with the Split Face and 
Paint tools, whereas a thicker ﬁnish such as mortar-set stone tile might be a separate ﬂoor type.
Using a Split Face for Tin Finishes
One of the easiest ways to divide a ﬂoor surface for thin ﬁnishes is to use the Split Face and 
Paint tools. This method will require a ﬂoor to be modeled and an appropriate material to be 
deﬁned with at least a surface pattern. You can schedule ﬁnishes applied with the Paint tool 
only through Material Takeoff schedules. Let’s explore this method with a quick exercise:
1. Open the ﬁle c14-Design-Floor.rvt from the book’s web page or continue with the ﬁle 
from the previous exercise and activate the Level 1 ﬂoor plan.
You will see an area of the ﬂoor that is bounded by a wall and two reference planes.
2. Click the Modify tab in the ribbon, activate the Split Face tool from the upper-right corner 
of the Geometry panel, and pick the ﬂoor in the Level 1 ﬂoor plan.
3. Draw a rectangle in front of the three interior walls, as shown in Figure 14.17.

boundary with the

610 | CHAPTER 14 MODELING FLOORS, CEILINGS, AND ROOFS 
You can constrain—or lock—the sketch lines to the interior walls, reference planes, and 
ﬂoor edge. You may do so in this exercise, but use constraints sparingly in larger projects 
to avoid slower model performance and updating calculation time.
Also notice that you generated a complete rectangular sketch instead of only three 
bounding lines. You do not need to draw the boundary line at the edge of the ﬂoor; how-
ever, if you do not include that line and the ﬂoor shape is modiﬁed in the future, the split 
face may be deleted because it is no longer a closed-loop sketch.
4. Click the Finish Edit Mode icon in the Mode panel.
5. Return to the Modify tab in the ribbon and activate the Paint tool in the Geometry panel, 
just below the Split Face tool.
6. In the Material Browser, type carpet in the ﬁlter search at the top.
This will minimize your choices, allowing you to select Carpet Tile from the ﬁltered list 
(Figure 14.18).

8. Click the Done button in the Material Browser to exit the Paint command.
Modeling Tick Finishes
Thicker ﬁnish materials such as tile, stone pavers, or terrazzo can be applied as unique ﬂoor 
types and modeled where required. For large areas of ﬁnish such as a public atrium or airport 
terminal, you can assign these materials within the layers of a ﬂoor assembly. When you need 
to add smaller areas of thick ﬂoor ﬁnishes, you may encounter one of two scenarios: with a 
depressed ﬂoor and without.
In areas such as bathrooms, a thick-set tile ﬂoor may require the structural slab to be 
depressed in order to accommodate the thickness of the ﬁnish material. In Figure 14.20, the 
main ﬂoor object has been cut with an opening at the inside face of the walls. Another ﬂoor has 
been modeled with a negative offset value to accommodate the thickness of the tile material, 
and the tile has been placed as a unique ﬂoor element.

Te thick tile ﬁnish 
and depressed slab are

612 | CHAPTER 14 MODELING FLOORS, CEILINGS, AND ROOFS 
If you do not need a ﬁnish but just a slab depression, you can create it with an in-place void 
extrusion. Select the Architecture tab in the ribbon and click Component ➢ Model In-Place. 
Choose the Floors category and create a void extrusion where you need a slab depression. 
Remember to use the Cut Geometry tool to cut the void from the ﬂoor before ﬁnishing the fam-
ily. As an alternative, you can create a ﬂoor-based generic family that contains a parametric void 
extrusion. You can download the ﬁle c14-Slab-Depression.rfa as an example of this type of 
family from the book’s web page.
Finally, if the structural requirements allow a thick ﬁnish to be applied to a ﬂoor without 
dropping the structural slab, a ﬁnish ﬂoor element can be modeled directly in place within  
the structural slab. As shown in Figure 14.21, the tile ﬂoor has been graphically embedded  
in the structural ﬂoor using the Join Geometry tool. To do this, click the Modify tab in the  
ribbon and click Join Geometry. Be sure to pick the ﬁnish ﬂoor before the structural ﬂoor or 
you will get an error.

Creating Ceilings
Ceilings are system families composed of sketch-based elements that also serve as hosts for 
components such as light ﬁxtures. Like other host elements such as ﬂoors and roofs, if a ceiling 
is deleted, elements on its hosts are also deleted.
Ceilings are classiﬁed as being either a Basic Ceiling or a Compound Ceiling. The Basic 
Ceiling family does not have a layered assembly and is represented in a section as a single line; 
however, it does have a material parameter that can display surface patterns in reﬂected ceiling 
plans and 3D views. The Compound Ceiling family allows you to deﬁne a layered assembly 
of materials that are visible when displayed in a section view. As with ﬂoors, you can change 
ceiling types by selecting a ceiling in your project and choosing another type from the Type 
Selector in the Properties palette or with the Match Type Properties tool.
Both the Basic Ceiling and Compound Ceiling types can serve as a host to hosted family 
components. Ceilings also serve as bounding elements for the volumetric calculation of rooms. 
This is critical when using environmental analysis programs. For more information about anal-
ysis for sustainable design, see Chapter 10, “Conceptual Design.”

UNDERSTANDING ROOF MODELING METHODS  | 613
You can create a ceiling in one of two ways: automatically or by sketching a boundary. When 
you select the ceiling tool from the Architecture tab of the ribbon, you can switch between the 
Automatic Ceiling and Sketch Ceiling modes at the right end of the ribbon.
In Automatic Ceiling mode, the software will try to determine the boundaries of a ceiling 
sketch when you place the cursor inside an enclosed space. If an enclosed space cannot be deter-
mined, the cursor will still indicate a circle/slash and you must switch to Sketch Ceiling mode. 
In this mode, you can use the Pick Walls method as discussed earlier in this chapter to create 
intelligent relationships with the bounding walls of the ceiling.
Check Your Ceiling Height
When you are using Automatic Ceiling mode, be aware of the Height Oﬀset From Level property 
when placing a ceiling within a space. If the Height Oﬀset From Level value is higher than the 
height of the bounding walls, the ceiling cannot be placed in the space.
Room Bounding Performance
Floors, ceilings, and roofs all have the ability to be room-bounding elements. Tis parameter can be 
found in the instance properties of each object. If you are not using volume calculations for rooms 
or you do not intend to use the model for environmental analysis, you might consider turning oﬀ 
the Room Bounding parameter in horizontal objects. In larger Revit projects, unnecessary applica-
tions of the Room Bounding parameter may lead to reduced model performance.
Ceilings are best modeled in ceiling plans even though they can be created in a ﬂoor plan. 
When you place a ceiling, its elevation will be based on the level of the current plan with an off-
set from that level. With the Properties palette open, the Height Offset From Level value can be 
modiﬁed as you create ceilings.
Understanding Roof Modeling Methods 
In today’s construction environment, roofs come in a great number of shapes and sizes. They 
can be as simple as a pitched shed roof or can involve complex double-curved surfaces or inter-
secting vaults. Once you understand the fundamental concepts, tools, and logic pertaining to 
roofs, you will be able to design almost any roof shape.
Roofs are similar to ﬂoors and ceilings because they are sketch-based elements and can be 
deﬁned in generic types or with speciﬁc material assemblies. You can also change a roof element 
Certiﬁcation

from one type to another in the same manner as you can a ﬂoor or ceiling. A fundamental dif-
ference between ﬂoors and roofs is that a roof’s thickness is generated above its referencing level, 
not below. You can also easily create slopes in roofs by deﬁning slopes in the roof’s sketch lines.
In general, roofs can be constructed in four different ways.
 
◆
By footprint
 
◆
By extrusion
 
◆
Modeled in place
 
◆
By face
Before we start into how to create the roofs themselves, let’s take a look at some of the impor-
tant instance properties for the roof family. These properties will need to be set properly to get 
the desired roof type, and they are all found in the Properties palette (Figure 14.22).
Figure 14.22 
Roof instance 
properties
Base Level  As in other Revit elements, this is the level at which the roof is placed. The roof 
moves with this level if the level changes height.
Room Bounding  When this is checked, the roof geometry has an effect on calculating room 
area and volume.

UNDERSTANDING ROOF MODELING METHODS  | 615
Related To Mass  This property is active only if a roof has been created with the roof-by-
face method (Conceptual Mass tools).
Base Offset From Level  This option lowers or elevates the base of the roof relative to the 
base level.
Cutoff Level  Many roof shapes require a combination of several roofs on top of each 
other—for this you need to cut off the top of a lower roof to accommodate the creation of the 
next roof in the sequence. Figure 14.23 shows an excellent example of this technique.
Figure 14.23 
Te cutoﬀ level applied 
to the main roof and 
a secondary roof built 
on top of the main roof 
using the cutoﬀ level 
as a base
Cutoff Offset  When the Cutoff tool is applied, the Cutoff Offset value also becomes 
active and allows you to set the cutoff distance from the level indicated in the Cutoff Level 
parameter.
Rafter Cut  This deﬁnes the eave shape. You can select from Plumb Cut, Two Cut–Plumb, 
or Two Cut–Square. When either Two Cut–Plumb or Two Cut–Square is selected, the Fascia 
Depth parameter is activated, and you can set the value for the depth.
Rafter Or Truss  With Rafter, the offset of the base is measured from the inside of the wall. 
If you choose Truss, the plate offset from the base is measured from the outside of the wall. 
Figure 14.24 illustrates the difference between the Rafter and Truss settings.

and Truss setting

The following sections provide a closer look at the different approaches to modeling roofs.

616 | CHAPTER 14 MODELING FLOORS, CEILINGS, AND ROOFS 
Constructing a Roof by Footprint
Use the roof-by-footprint method to create any standard roof that more or less follows the shape 
of the footprint of the building and is a simple combination of roof pitches (Figure 14.25).
Figure 14.25 
A simple roof created 
using the roof-by-
footprint method
These roofs are based on a sketched shape that you deﬁne in plan view at the sofﬁt level and 
that can be edited at any time during the development of a project from plan and axon 3D views. 
The shape can be drawn as a simple loop of lines, using the Line tool, or can be created using the 
Pick Walls method, which also should result in a closed loop of lines.
To guide you through the creation of a roof by footprint and explain some of the main prin-
ciples and tools, we offer a brief exercise demonstrating the steps:
1. In a new project using any default template, open a Level 1 plan view and create a build-
ing footprint similar to Figure 14.26.
Figure 14.26 
Sample building out-
line to be sketched on 
Level 1
Make sure the height of the walls is set to Unconnected: 20′-0″ (6000 mm).
2. Activate the Level 2 plan; then select the Architecture tab in the ribbon and click Roof ➢ 
Roof By Footprint.

UNDERSTANDING ROOF MODELING METHODS  | 617
3. From the Draw panel in the Modify | Create Roof Footprint tab, select the Pick Walls tool 
(this should be the default).
4. When you have chosen to create a roof by footprint, the Options bar displays the follow-
ing settings (change the Overhang value to 1′-0″ (300 mm)).
To deﬁne whether you want a sloped or ﬂat roof, use the Deﬁnes Slope check box in the 
Options bar. The Overhang parameter allows you to deﬁne the value of the roof overhang 
beyond the wall. When the “Extend into wall (to core)” option is checked, the overhang is 
measured from the wall core. If the option is deselected, the overhang is measured from 
the exterior face of the wall.
5. After deﬁning these settings, place the cursor over one of the walls without clicking and 
using the Tab key, select all connected walls. A dashed lined will indicate the ﬁnal edge of the 
overhang. Once all are highlighted, click one of the walls to complete the overhang sketch.
Your display should look like Figure 14.27.
Figure 14.27 
Roof sketch lines are 
automatically drawn 
after Tab+selecting the 
bounding walls, and 
they are oﬀset from 
the walls by the value 
of the overhang as 
deﬁned in the

6. Select the three walls within the alcove, open the Properties palette, and uncheck the 
Deﬁnes Roof Slope parameter, as shown in Figure 14.28.
7. Click the Finish Edit Mode icon in the Mode panel of the ribbon. If you are prompted 
with the question, “Would you like to attach the highlighted walls to the roof?” click the 
Yes button. Activate a 3D view, and your roof should look like the image in Figure 14.25 
shown previously.

618 | CHAPTER 14 MODELING FLOORS, CEILINGS, AND ROOFS 
If the shape of the roof does not correspond to your expectations, you can select the roof and 
select Edit Footprint from the Mode panel in the Modify | Roofs tab to return to Sketch mode, 
where you can edit lines, sketch new lines, pick new walls, or modify the slope.
To change the slope deﬁnition or angle of individual portions of the roof while editing 
a roof’s footprint, select the sketch line of the roof portion for which you want to change 
the slope and toggle (check) the Deﬁnes Slope button in the Options bar, toggle the Deﬁnes 
Roof Slope parameter in the Properties palette, or right-click and choose Toggle Slope 
Deﬁning. If you mistakenly made all roof sides with slope but wanted to make a ﬂat roof, 
you can Tab+select all sketch lines that form the roof shape and clear the Deﬁnes Slope box 
in the Options bar. You can dynamically change the roof slope by selecting the roof and 
then selecting the blue grips (Figure 14.29) and dragging them either up or down to make 
the roof pitch steeper or shallower. This is a great way to make quick (although not precise) 
edits to the roof pitch.

Roof slope can be measured in two different ways: as an angle or as a percentage rise. You can 
ﬁnd all slope-measuring options in the Manage tab by selecting Project Units in the Project Settings 
panel and then selecting Slope to open the Format dialog box (see Figure 14.30). If the current slope 
value is not in units you want to have (suppose it displays percentage but you want it to display an 
angle), change the slope units in the Format dialog box—you will not be able to do that while editing 
the roof slope. Setting it here means specifying the way you measure slopes for the entire project.

Format dialog box

Applying a Roof by Extrusion
The roof by extrusion method is best applied for roof shapes that are generated by extrusion  
of a proﬁle, such as sawtooth roofs, barrel vaults, and waveform roofs. Like the roof-by-footprint 
method, it is based on a sketch; however, the sketch that deﬁnes the shape of the roof is drawn 
in elevation or section view (not in plan view) and is then extruded along the plan of the build-
ing (see Figure 14.31).
Figure 14.31 
An extruded spline-
shaped roof

620 | CHAPTER 14 MODELING FLOORS, CEILINGS, AND ROOFS 
Roofs by extrusion do not have an option to follow the building footprint, but that is 
often needed to accommodate the requirements of the design. To accomplish this, you can 
use the Vertical Opening tool to trim the edges of an extruded roof relative to the building 
outline.
Let’s brieﬂy review the concept behind the Vertical Opening tool: you create a roof by 
 extrusion by deﬁning a proﬁle in elevation or 3D that is then extruded above the building.  
The extrusion is usually based on a work plane that is not perpendicular to the building  
footprint, as shown in Figure 14.32. If the shape of the building is nonrectangular in footprint 
or the shape of the roof you want to create is not to be rectangular, this tool will let you carve 
geometry from the roof to match the footprint of the building or get any plan shape you need 
using a plan sketch.
With sketch-based design, any closed loop of lines creates a positive shape; every loop inside 
it is negative, the next one inside that negative one will be positive, and so on. In Figure 14.33, a 
roof by extrusion was drawn at an angle to the underlying walls, but the ﬁnal roof shape should 
be limited to a small offset from the walls. To clip the roof to the shape of the building footprint, 
the Vertical Opening tool was used to draw, in plan view of the roof, a negative shape that will 
remove the portions of the roof that extend beyond the walls.

Roof In-Place
The roof in-place technique accommodates roof shapes that cannot be achieved with either of 
the previously mentioned methods. It is the usual way to model historic roof shapes or challeng-
ing roof geometries such as those illustrated in Figure 14.34. The ﬁgure shows a barrel roof with 
a half dome (Extrusion + 1/2 Revolve), a dome roof (Revolve only or Revolve + Extrusion), and 
an onion dome (Revolve only).

To create an in-place roof, select the Architecture tab in the ribbon and click Component ➢

While you remain in the In-Place Family editing mode, you can create any roof shape using 
solids and voids of extrusions, blends, revolves, sweeps, and swept blends (Figure 14.35). More 
advanced editing techniques are discussed later in this chapter, in the section “Using Advanced 
Shape Editing with Floors and Roofs.”

622 | CHAPTER 14 MODELING FLOORS, CEILINGS, AND ROOFS 
Creating a Roof by Face
The Roof By Face tool is to be used when you have created an in-place mass or loaded a mass 
family. These types of roofs are typically more integrated with the overall building geometry 
than the examples we’ve shown for in-place roofs. You can ﬁnd more detailed information about 
using face-based methods in Chapter 9.
Creating a Sloped Glazing
In Chapter 13, you learned that a curtain wall is just another wall type made out of panels and 
mullions organized in a grid system. Similarly, sloped glazing is just another type of a roof that 
has glass as material and mullions for divisions. Using sloped glazing, you can make roof lights 
and shed lights and use them to design simple framing structures.
To create sloped glazing, make a simple pitched roof, select it, and use the Properties palette 
to change the type to Sloped Glazing (see Figure 14.36).
Figure 14.36 
Sloped Glazing listed in 
the Properties window
Once you have done that, activate a 3D view and use the Curtain Grid tool from the Build 
panel of the Architecture tab in the ribbon to start applying horizontal or vertical grids 
that deﬁne the panel sizes; then you can apply mullions using the Mullion tool in the Build 
panel. Figure 14.37 illustrates an example of a standard gable roof that has been converted 
to sloped glazing. Refer to Chapter 13 for more information on using the Curtain Grid and 
Mullion tools.

UNDERSTANDING ROOF MODELING METHODS  | 623
Using Slope Arrows
If your design calls for a sloped roof with an unusual footprint that does not easily lend 
itself to using the Deﬁnes Slope property of boundary lines, slope arrows can be added 
within the sketch of the roof. First, create the sketch lines to deﬁne the shape of a roof, 
but do not check Deﬁnes Slope in the Options bar. Instead, choose the Slope Arrow tool 
from the Draw panel. Draw the slope arrow in the direction you want your roof to pitch. 
Select the arrow, and in the Properties palette, you can set any of the parameters, as shown 
in Figure 14.38. The Specify parameter can be set to either Height At Tail or Slope. If you 
choose Height At Tail, be sure to specify the Height Offset At Head parameter as the end 
result of the desired slope.

Using Additional Roof Tools
The following three roof tools (Figure 14.39) can be found under the Roof ﬂyout.
 
◆
Roof: Sofﬁt
 
◆
Roof: Fascia
 
◆
Roof: Gutter
Figure 14.39 
Edge condition  
roof tools
Each of these tools behaves in a similar fashion—it uses a proﬁle that is swept along the edge 
of the roof.
The difference between these tools is fairly simple. The Sofﬁt tool will sweep a proﬁle to the 
underside of a roof overhang parallel to the ground. The Fascia tool will sweep a proﬁle along 
the vertical face of the roof edge, and the Gutter tool will sweep a proﬁle along one of the edges 
of the roof. Try these tools on the roofs you’ve created in this chapter to better understand how 
they react to roof conditions. You can see how the Gutter tool looks using the default proﬁle in 
Figure 14.40.
Figure 14.40 
Te Gutter tool

(b)
Do not feel you are limited to residential uses with these tools. For example, the Gutter tool 
can be used to create a break metal cap for a ﬂat roof parapet. Do be careful when you are pick-
ing an edge to apply the Gutter tool. The best approach is to pick in-plan views because the 
Gutter tool will default to the lower of the two edges so your gutters will be all placed at a con-
sistent level. The ﬁrst selection determines the location and additional segments can be added.

Creating a Dormer Step by Step
Roofs with dormers generally cause grief for architects, so we will guide you through the creation 
of one:
1. Create the base of a building, set up three levels, and create a roof by footprint with Deﬁnes Slope 
checked for all sides.
2. Approximately in the position indicated in the following illustration, on Level 2 create the four 
walls of a dormer. Set their height to a value that makes them extend above the roof.
For easier veriﬁcation, create a cross section through the dormer to check the height of the 
dormer walls and, if necessary, modify their height in the Properties palette so that they 
extend above the roof.
3. Using the Roof By Footprint tool, create a pitched roof on top of the dormer walls.
4. If you switch to a side elevation view, you will notice that the dormer roof probably does not extend 
to meet the main roof, so you will need to use the Join/Unjoin Roof tool, located in the Modify 
tab in the Edit Geometry panel, to join the main roof and the dormer. Select the Join/Unjoin Roof 
tool, select the main roof as the target, and then select the edge of the dormer roof to extend it.

626 | CHAPTER 14 MODELING FLOORS, CEILINGS, AND ROOFS 
5. From the Opening panel on the Architecture tab, select Dormer. Now pick ﬁrst the main roof 
and then the dormer roof, and then select the sides of the walls that deﬁne the dormer. Select the 
inside faces of the walls.
Unlike most sketches, you will not need to provide a closed loop of lines in this case. Finish 
the dormer opening.
6. Finally, go back to the section view you previously created and edit the elevation proﬁle of the side 
walls to make sure they do not extend below or above the roofs.
You should not use the Top/Base Attach tool for tricky modeling scenarios such as the roof dor-
mer, as the attachment may fail. Instead, select the wall and use the Edit Proﬁle tool available 
in the Mode panel of the Modify | Walls tab to edit its elevation proﬁle and manually resketch 
the edge lines of the walls to get the triangular elevation proﬁle as shown.

As a ﬁnal option, you can convert the front wall of the dormer to a storefront wall type or add 
a window.
Using Advanced Shape Editing with Floors and Roofs
No ﬂat roof is ever really ﬂat! Fortunately, there are tools that allow you to model tapered insu-
lation over a ﬂat roof and similar conditions to give the roof a small pitch. These powerful tools 
are modiﬁers that are applicable to roofs and ﬂoors and will allow you to model concrete slabs 
with multiple slopes for sidewalks or roof assemblies with tapered insulation (see Figure 14.41).
Figure 14.41 
Roof with sloped drain-
age layer
The set of tools available for editing ﬂoor and roof shapes appears in the ribbon when you 
select a ﬂat ﬂoor or roof. If the Reset Shape command is inactive, that means the selected ele-
ment has not been modiﬁed with the shape editing tools.

628 | CHAPTER 14 MODELING FLOORS, CEILINGS, AND ROOFS 
Let’s look at what each tool does:
Modify Sub Elements  This tool allows you to directly edit element geometry by select-
ing and modifying points and edges. If you do not create any additional points or split lines 
before activating this tool, the object’s outer edges and corners will be available for editing.
Add Point  This tool allows you to add points on the top face of a roof or ﬂoor. Points can 
be added on edges or surfaces and can be modiﬁed after placement using the Modify Sub 
Elements tool.
Add Split Line  This tool allows you to sketch directly on the top face of the element, which 
adds vertices so that hips and valleys can be created when the elevations of the lines are 
modiﬁed using the Modify Sub Elements tool.
Pick Supports  This tool allows you to pick linear beams and walls in order to create new 
split edges and set the slope and/or elevation of the ﬂoor or roof automatically.
Once a ﬂoor or roof has been modiﬁed using any of these tools, the Reset Shape button will 
become active. You can use this tool to remove all modiﬁcations you applied to the selected ﬂoor 
or roof.
Creating a Roof with a Sloped Topping
Let’s work through an exercise that shows you how to make a roof with a sloped topping like 
the one shown in Figure 14.42 (shown in plan view).
Figure 14.42 
A roof plan showing 
a roof divided in seg-
ments, with drainage 
points
Follow these steps:
1. Open c14-Roof-Edit.rvt or c14-Roof-Edit-Metric.rvt from the book’s web page. 
Activate the Roof ﬂoor plan.
2. Select the roof that has already been prepared for you.
3. Activate the Add Split Line tool (the color of the rest of the model grays out while the roof 
lines are dashed green).
4. Sketch two ridge lines to divide the roof into three areas that will be independently drained.
The ridge lines will be drawn in blue.
5. Using the same tool, draw diagonal lines within those areas to create the valleys.

USING ADVANCED SHAPE EDITING WITH FLOORS AND ROOFS | 629
Make sure you zoom in closely when drawing the diagonal lines, and be sure that you 
are snapping in the exact same dividing points. (If you notice that the split lines are not 
snapped to the correct points, select the Modify Sub Elements tool, pick the incorrect 
lines, delete them, and try again.)
You have split the roof surface into many regions, but they are still all at the same height 
and pitch. You should have a roof that looks like Figure 14.43.
Figure 14.43 
Using the Add Split 
Line tool, you can cre-
ate ridges and valleys.
Press the Esc key or click the Modify button to stop the editing mode.
6. Switch to a 3D view.
7. To add a slope, you need to edit the height of the drainage points or the heights of the 
edges and ridges created by the split lines. For this exercise, you will raise the elevation of 
the boundary edges and ridges. Activate the Modify Sub Elements tool and select an edge 
of the roof (dashed green line). New controls that allow you to edit the text will appear, 
and you can either move the arrows up and down or type in a value for the height. Type 
in 1′-0″ (300 mm).
8. Repeat step 7 for all boundary edges and the two north-south split lines forming the 
ridges between the drainage areas.
9. Make a section through the roof—if possible, somewhere through one of the drainage 
points. Open the section; change Detail Level to Fine to see all layers.
The entire roof structure is now sloped toward the drainage point.
Applying a Variable Tickness to a Roof Layer
What if you wanted the insulation to be tapered but not the structure? For that, the layers of the 
roofs can now have variable thickness. Let’s see how to apply a variable thickness to a layer of 
the roof assembly.
1. Continuing with the c14-Roof-Edit.rvt or c14-Roof-Edit-Metric.rvt ﬁle from the 
previous exercise, select the roof, and in the Properties palette select Edit Type to view 
the roof’s type properties. Click Edit in the Structure row to edit the layers of the roof 
assembly.

630 | CHAPTER 14 MODELING FLOORS, CEILINGS, AND ROOFS 
2. Activate the preview. You will notice that in the roof-structure preview, you do not see 
any slopes. That is correct and will not change. This preview is just a schematic preview 
of the structure and does not show the exact sloping. Look for the Variable column under 
Layers, as shown in Figure 14.44. This allows layers of the roof to vary in thickness when 
slopes are present. Check the Variable option for the insulation material.
Figure 14.44 
Specify variable 
layers of material in 
the Edit Assembly 
dialog box.
3. Go back to the section view and observe the changes in the roof assembly.
As you can see, only the insulation is tapered, while the structure remains ﬂat.
You will only be able to modify an adjustable layer of a ﬂoor or roof with a negative value to 
the next nonadjustable layer of the assembly. In the previous exercise, for example, if you modi-
ﬁed the drainage points by more than –0′-5″ (–140 mm), an error would be generated, and the 
edits to the roof would be removed. You must think about the design requirements of your roof 
or ﬂoor assembly when planning how to model adjustable layers. An alternative approach to the 
previous exercise might have been to increase the thickness of the insulation layer in the roof 
assembly to that required at the high pitch points. The drainage points could then be lowered 
relative to the boundary edges and ridge lines.

 Chapter  15 
 Designing with the Family Editor   
 In previous chapters, we discussed the modeling techniques for system families such as 
walls, roofs, ﬂ oors, and ceilings. Although system families are essentially rule-based assem-
blies applied to sketch-based forms, component families are more self-contained and diverse. 
Another way to explain the difference is that system families are the objects you usually quan-
tify in terms of linear units, surface area, or volume, whereas component families are most often 
counted objects. Such families include doors, windows, furniture, light ﬁ xtures, plumbing ﬁ x-
tures, specialty equipment, and so on. 
 In Autodesk ® Revit ® software, the Family Editor is where you will create these component 
families. If you are familiar with other 3D modeling applications, the good news is that it will 
be easy to get started. So relax, and prepare yourself for getting excited about design. Once you 
understand how to create parametric content in the Family Editor, you will probably realize you 
can do anything in Revit. We will begin this chapter by discussing some of the general topics that 
are important to understand about the Family Editor and creating component families. Then you 
will use some of this knowledge to create your own component family in a detailed exercise. 
 In this chapter, you will learn to

 Getting Started with a Family 
 Many generic 3D modeling applications allow you to create content that can be used in design-
ing your buildings, and modeling in 3D is certainly a big part of the Family Editor. The key to 
the Family Editor is that you are not just modeling but also modeling something speciﬁ c. The 
thing you are creating is meant to be a particular thing that behaves in speciﬁ c ways. 
 So when you are modeling in the Family Editor, you are not just trying to model  how  and  what  
something is but also trying to predict how it might change. Anticipating change is essential to 
creating great, ﬂ exible content that is able to quickly and easily reﬂ ect your design changes. 
 For example, take a simple table. If you were to model this table in a program such as McNeel 
Rhino®, what you would have when you have ﬁ nished is exactly what you have modeled. 
Alternatively, think about the design process and how often during design you will need to

634 | CHAPTER 15 DESIGNING WITH THE FAMILY EDITOR 
iterate something like height, length, width, or material. In the real world, each of these param-
eters is critical. Suppose you have only three options for each of these values—this results in 81 
permutations! Who has time to manually create each of these options? This is what you would 
have to do if you were using a generic modeler rather than Revit, where these options are driven 
by rules. By using parameters to deﬁne dimensions, materials, nested elements, and more, you 
can create additional permutations on the ﬂy.
Understanding In-Place Families
In the previous chapter, you learned how to create an in-place void family in order to custom-
ize the edge of a ﬂoor slab. Although some truly unique content in your project can be modeled 
using in-place families, it is often a dead-end process that robs you of hours of otherwise pro-
ductive time for a number of reasons.
First, an in-place family should be used only in cases where the object that you are making 
is not likely to be moved, rotated, or copied. Any attempt to move, rotate, or copy an in-place 
family can often have unintended consequences that are difﬁcult to remedy. For example, if you 
model an in-place family and then create copies in your project, they may all initially look the 
same, but in fact you are creating new unique families—not just copied instances of the same 
family. Therefore, if you modify one of the copied instances of an in-place family, the other copy 
will remain unchanged.
Second, each copied instance will schedule independently from the other instances as sepa-
rate line items. This is often not desirable because you may want to group like elements together 
in a schedule.
Finally, there is no way to convert an in-place family into a component family. In some cases, 
you can copy and paste sketch lines or other 2D elements between the project and family envi-
ronments. If you try to copy and paste geometry from the project environment to the Family 
Editor, you will get an error stating that you cannot copy between family and project. The only 
way to proceed is to start again in the Family Editor.
It is common practice to create in-place families only for conditions that are unique, and it is 
advantageous to model the element in the context of the overall design considerations within 
the project ﬁle. Examples of this could be a bespoke wall system of nonstandard geometry or a 
unique sculptural element that is part of the environment.
Content Guidelines and Standards
Before you begin to create your own custom content, you should be aware of the vast number of 
online content providers in the AEC industry. As of this writing, there are more than 1,000 build-
ing product manufacturers providing Revit families. Tere are also more than 20 online content-
hosting providers such as BIMobject®, RevitCity, National BIM Library, BIMstore, and ARCAT BIM 
Objects (just to name a few). With most of these providers oﬀering content for free, how can you 
be sure that the content you download will be usable or will support extended interoperability 
and collaboration?
A few of the content-aggregating sites oﬀer content standards or guidelines. One example can be 
found on the Autodesk-endorsed BIMobject site at http://bimobject.com.

GETTING STARTED WITH A FAMILY | 635
Object style guides such as the Autodesk Seek Style Guide and the BIMstore BIMBible contain 
detailed information on family creation guidelines, including standardized shared parameters, 
model-object subcategories, and naming conventions. There are no international, platform- 
independent content standards to help you develop content that will oﬀer maximum potential 
for data interoperability. Tat said, eﬀorts are under way within the buildingSMART International 
community (www.buildingsmart.org) to help set a standard in the future.
Choosing the Right Family Template and Category
The ﬁrst thing you will want to consider in creating a component family is to determine what 
kind of component you want to build—in other words, you need to select an appropriate cat-
egory. As we discuss in various chapters throughout this book, there are many predeﬁned 
categories within a Revit project. You can create a new family from the Application menu by 
clicking New ➢ Family. This command will open a dialog box where you can choose from a 
vast selection of family templates (Figure 15.1). Templates for component families use the RFT 
ﬁle format.
Certiﬁcation
Objective
Figure 15.1 
Select a family tem-
plate to begin creating 
a component family.
From the New Family dialog box, select Generic Model.rft or Metric Generic Model.rft 
and then click Open. (If you cannot ﬁnd either template ﬁle, you can download them from this 
book’s web page at www.sybex.com/go/masteringrevit2018.) Selecting the right family tem-
plate is important because it determines a lot of the family’s behavior. For example, a baluster 
template contains default datum objects that relate to the geometry of a railing (Figure 15.2).
Aside from some speciﬁc cases such as balusters, the family template’s primary function is to 
assign a category. In some cases, you can change the category of the family after it has been cre-
ated. In the family you just started to create, switch to the Properties panel in the Create tab in 
the ribbon and then click the Family Category and Parameters button.

636 | CHAPTER 15 DESIGNING WITH THE FAMILY EDITOR 
Figure 15.2 
A baluster family 
template contains pre-
deﬁned datum objects 
to manage the geomet-
ric behavior.
In the dialog box shown in Figure 15.3, you will see that this Generic Models family is 
capable of being assigned to another category. This is helpful if you need to schedule a family 
in a category different from the one you initially selected. In many cases, categories cannot be 
switched, and hosted or face-based components cannot be changed to unhosted (and vice versa). 
It is also difﬁcult to convert a family that has many modeled elements to another category 
because you may be forced to reassign all the modeled elements to new subcategories.
Figure 15.3 
Switching between 
family categories

GETTING STARTED WITH A FAMILY | 637
Some categories are hardwired for speciﬁc behavior, and if you change from one such cat-
egory to another, you cannot go back. For example, if you start a family in one of the baluster 
templates, you can switch to another category. After having done so, you cannot switch the fam-
ily back to being a baluster. Knowing what you want to create before you begin helps you mini-
mize the amount of switching you need to do later in the process.
You should become familiar with the following characteristics that relate to a family’s 
assigned category.
Scheduling
Remember that as you start a new component, the category you select controls how the family 
component will schedule. For example, you would not select the Furniture category to develop 
a family that you want to schedule as a plumbing ﬁxture. Most of the categories you will use 
as you develop custom content will be self-explanatory; however, there may be some building 
elements for which you may need to think about categorization. One example is a vertical circu-
lation component such as an elevator or escalator. You might select the Specialty Equipment cat-
egory, but that category does not allow the geometry to be cut in a plan or section view. Perhaps 
you would use the Generic Models category instead, but you would need to use other parameters 
to schedule these types of families separately from other generic model families in your project.
Using Projection and Cut Values
Another important characteristic of the family category mentioned in the previous section is 
that it will dictate whether a family will “cut” when intersecting a view plane (plan, section, ele-
vation, and so on). For example, convention dictates that when furniture encounters a cut plane, 
you should show a projected view rather than a sectional view.
Revit respects this convention by cutting some categories while not cutting others. You can 
ﬁgure out which categories cut or do not cut by going to the Manage tab and clicking Object 
Styles. As you can see, categories such as Casework, Ceilings, and Columns have line weight 
values in the Cut column, whereas categories such as Electrical Equipment, Furniture, and 
Lighting Fixtures do not.
Assigning Parameters
As you start to get into the parameters that can control a family’s geometry, material, or other 
value, keep in mind that it is not always necessary to create components as fully parametric. 
This is especially true of the ﬁrst pass. The location and spacing of content are often more 
important than whether the family can ﬂex geometrically.
Nonparametric families often occur when the component being modeled is speciﬁc and 
highly unique. It may have parameters that control materials or a few other values, but not much 
more. At this point, little more than selecting the right category and insertion point is necessary. 
It is often far more efﬁcient to maintain design relationships by modifying the component in 
the Family Editor and then reloading it into the project—at least until more is known about the 
design. When more is known, you can open the family and embed more parameters.
Choosing Between Hosted and Nonhosted Family Types
The next important question you need to ask yourself as you select your family template is 
whether the family is meant to be hosted or nonhosted. If you make the wrong decision here, you 

638 | CHAPTER 15 DESIGNING WITH THE FAMILY EDITOR 
will have to start over to switch between these types. To identify the difference between hosted 
and nonhosted family types, examine the family templates shown previously in Figure 15.1.  
Some of the ﬁlenames are indicated as “line based” or “wall based.” These templates are used to 
create hosted families. Most of the other templates such as Casework.rft, Furniture.rft,  
Metric Casework.rft, Metric Furniture.rft, and Metric Generic Model.rft are nonhosted.
First, keep in mind that hosted objects are meant to cut or create an opening or depression in 
their host. Obviously, a window needs to cut the wall into which it will be placed, or a ﬁre extin-
guisher case will often need to generate a recess in the host wall. Second, if the component is to 
be hosted and you are certain that it needs to create an opening in its host, it can cut only one 
type of host. For example, a lighting ﬁxture that is wall-based may not be hosted by a ceiling.
Want to see a bad example of this? Download and open the Tub-Rectangular-3D.rfa family 
from this book’s web page (Figure 15.4).
Figure 15.4 
Wall-hosted plumb-
ing ﬁxtures
What is wrong with this picture? First, this tub is wall hosted and not all tubs need walls, so 
you will have to make another family that has no host in order to place the tub where there is no 
wall. This seems a bit redundant, because one tub will do.
Second, if you delete a host, all the hosted elements are deleted as well. This makes some 
sense when you delete a wall that hosts windows or doors. But it will certainly lead to a lot of 
frustration if you delete a wall that hosts bathroom ﬁxtures!
We cannot stress this enough: as a best practice, avoid creating hosted relationships between 
objects that do not require hosting (that do not cut or otherwise modify the host). This discus-
sion brings up an interesting point. Rather than use hosted elements, why not make elements 
face-based? There are some advantages:
 
◆
You do not have to decide on a particular host. Any surface will do: Wall, Ceiling, Top of 
Casework, anything that has a face. This is great if the lighting component you are creating 
needs to cut into a wall, ﬂoor, and ceiling!

GETTING STARTED WITH A FAMILY | 639
 
◆
A face-based element can cut the face of geometry in both the project and family editing 
environment. So, the light ﬁxture that cuts a wall in a project can cut the face of a piece of 
casework in the Family Editor.
 
◆
Deleting the host will not delete the component. Is this desirable? Maybe sometimes, but 
not always. What is important is that you have the option if the component is face-based. 
You will not have the option if the component is hosted.
 
◆
You can place face-based families on host elements from a linked project model. This 
works great when an architectural model is linked into an engineer’s model for placement 
of electrical or plumbing ﬁxtures.
Creating Other Types of Families in the Family Editor
Now that you understand the importance of selecting between a hosted and a nonhosted family 
template, you should become familiar with some other types of families you can create in the 
Family Editor.
Placing Line-Based Components
This is a less common type of family that allows you to place components in the project environ-
ment as lines. Line-based families can take advantage of line-based tools such as Trim/Extend 
and Split and can also support parametric arrays.
Generic model, detail item, and structural stiffener are the only family categories currently 
available to be used as a line-based component. An example of one is a generic model created by 
Steve Stafford for his Revit OpEd blog (Figure 15.5). This family is used to lay out egress paths 
and then calculate the total travel distance in a schedule. You can download this family here:
http://revitoped.blogspot.com/2007/01/egress-path.html
Figure 15.5 
An example of a 
generic line-based 
family
Using Detail Components
Some types of families consist of only 2D elements—these are called detail components. They 
are most often used in drafting views; however, detail components can also be placed in plan, 
elevation, and section views. The beneﬁt of using detail components, as compared to individual 
lines and ﬁlled regions, is that a detail component can be reused many times, thus increasing 
drafting productivity; quality is increased by allowing control of repetitive detail elements and 
they support keynote and tagging abilities. We discuss detail components further in Chapter 17, 
“Detailing Your Design.”

640 | CHAPTER 15 DESIGNING WITH THE FAMILY EDITOR 
Placing Annotation Symbols
Much like detail components, annotation symbols are families that contain only 2D graphics, 
including lines, text, and ﬁll or masking regions. They are different from detail components 
because annotation symbols will react to the scale of the view in which they are placed. Aside 
from the common uses of annotation symbols such as tags, north arrows, or graphic scales, you 
can nest annotation symbols in other types of model families to customize and better manage 
your approach to project documentation. Consider some of the families for electrical terminal 
ﬁxtures in the default library. These families include a 3D representation of a small element, 
such as a receptacle plate that will be seen in an elevation view, but they also include a generic 
annotation to represent the object with a scaled symbol in a plan view, as shown in Figure 15.6.
Figure 15.6 
A default family 
illustrating a nested 
annotation symbol
In Chapter 4, “Conﬁguring Templates and Standards,” we showed you how to build custom 
annotation symbols for use in your own projects or templates.
Creating Mass Families
Mass families are special components that are created in a slightly different environment of 
the Family Editor called the conceptual design environment (CDE). Within this environment, 
you use tools to sketch lines that are used to generate forms almost automatically. As shown in 
Figure 15.7, the line tools in the ribbon of the CDE allow you to sketch ﬁrst, select lines, and then 
use the Create Form button. After a form has been created, it can be subdivided for additional 
articulation.
Figure 15.7 
Geometry tools 
in the concep-
tual design 
environment
Using Mass Families with an Application
We discuss using mass families with greater detail in Chapter 9, “Advanced Modeling and 
Massing.” If you have an Apple iPad or Android tablet, you might also want to experiment with 
the free Autodesk® FormIt® mobile application. It is also available as a web application here: 
http://formit360.autodesk.com. With this design application, you can quickly generate and 

GETTING STARTED WITH A FAMILY | 641
study forms—including the ability to analyze gross ﬂoor area and shadows (Figure 15.8). When 
the app synchronizes with your Autodesk® A360 cloud account, it will automatically convert the 
designs to RVT project ﬁles where the modeled geometry is represented as in-place masses.
Figure 15.8 
Te Autodesk FormIt 
application can be 
used to generate 
mass forms.
Using Adaptive Components
Finally, a special type of dynamic family that is used in the CDE is known as an adaptive com-
ponent. These families are an adaptation of the pattern-based curtain panel concept, but you 
can use them in geometry other than divided surfaces. You can learn more about creating and 
using adaptive components in Chapter 13, “Creating Walls and Curtain Walls,” and Chapter 10, 
“Conceptual Design.”
Understanding the Family Editor
The Family Editor is not a different software application that you need to install. It is simply a 
unique mode within Revit that has tools and commands speciﬁcally designed to create com-
ponent content. After you launch the command to make a new family and you choose a family 
template, you will enter the Family Editor. If you happen to have a project ﬁle open, you can 
switch back and forth between a family ﬁle and the project just the same way you would toggle 
between the open views of a project.
Depending on the type of family you are building, the Create tab in the ribbon will have 
slightly different tools. In this chapter, you will be using the Furniture family template, and the 
Create tab will have speciﬁc 3D modeling tools, as shown in Figure 15.9.

642 | CHAPTER 15 DESIGNING WITH THE FAMILY EDITOR 
Figure 15.9 
Te Create tab for 
model families
If you were creating a detail component or annotation family, neither of which can con-
tain 3D geometry, the Create tab displays only 2D tools such as Line, Filled Region, and Label 
(Figure 15.10).
Figure 15.10 
Te Create tab for 
detail and annotation 
families
Within the Family Editor, you also have the ability to include imported CAD data. From the 
Insert tab in the ribbon, you can use the Import CAD tool to use 2D or 3D information from 
another source. You cannot use the Link CAD tool in the Family Editor; therefore, any data 
imported to a family will not update if the original CAD ﬁle is changed.
A feature in Revit is the ability to explode and then manipulate imported 3D solid CAD 
geometry. You can experiment with this feature by downloading the ﬁle ImportCAD.sat from 
this book’s web page.
Switch to the Insert tab, click the Import CAD tool, and then browse to the location where you 
downloaded the sample SAT ﬁle. You will have to change the Files Of Type drop-down list to ACIS 
SAT Files. Use the default settings and click Open. After the model has loaded, go to the default 3D 
view and press ZF for the Zoom To Fit command. Select the imported geometry, and from the con-
textual tab in the ribbon choose Explode ➢ Full Explode. Select the solid geometry again, and you 
will notice that the imported model is now ready to be manipulated with a series of grip controls 
(Figure 15.11). Delete the imported geometry before continuing with the exercise in this chapter.
Figure 15.11 
Imported solid geom-
etry can be exploded 
and manipulated.

DEVELOPING THE FRAMEWORK FOR A FAMILY COMPONENT | 643
Another tab in the Family Editor that might seem familiar is the Annotate tab. Here you will 
ﬁnd tools for dimensions, symbolic lines, and text. In a model component, dimensions and text 
placed in the Family Editor are not visible when the family is loaded and placed in a project. 
Although text can be used for reference notes in the Family Editor, dimensions are used to con-
trol and drive the geometry. You will learn much more about parametric dimensions later in 
this chapter.
The tools in the Detail panel of the Annotate tab in the ribbon allow you to create some 2D 
geometry within a 3D family. This is especially useful if you have a somewhat complex model 
that you would like to display as a simpliﬁed graphic in a plan view. For example, you may 
have a detailed 3D model of a bathroom water closet (toilet) ﬁxture. If such a model was com-
posed of complex curved surfaces and solids, displaying many of these components in a project 
view might ultimately begin to degrade visual performance. Instead, the 3D geometry can be 
assigned to not display in a plan view, while you include a simple sketch of the ﬁxture in the 
plan view of the family. Your renderings, sections, and elevations will display the 3D family 
geometry, while your plan views will remain simple and fast.
One ﬁnal aspect to understand about the Family Editor is its ability to use multiple views to 
visualize your design. Similar to the project environment, it lets you create as many views as 
you need to help visualize the content in your family. The Ref. Level plan view can be dupli-
cated if you need to examine your family at different elevations. Simply change the View Range 
properties of each plan view to control the height of the view’s cut plane. From the View tab in 
the ribbon, you can also create camera views and sections within the family.
Developing the Framework for a Family Component
Now that we have discussed some of the basic deﬁnitions and rules of the Family Editor, we 
will talk about the hierarchy of creating a family component.
In this section you will work through the fundamentals of creating a family in terms of 
datum objects, constraints, parameters, materials, subcategories, and visibility settings. Later in 
the chapter, you will learn more advanced modeling and parametric techniques.
Click the Application menu and then select New ➢ Family. Use the Furniture.rft or  
Metric Furniture.rft family template, which is available for download with this chapter’s 
exercise ﬁles from the book’s web page.
Creating the Necessary Reference Planes, Lines, and Points
In the project environment, datum objects are available for you to control and manage the loca-
tion and behavior of modeled geometry. In previous chapters, we discussed the use of grids, lev-
els, and reference planes, but this data is also extremely important in a component family. When 
used in the Family Editor, reference planes, lines, and points will function as the skeleton for the 
solid and void geometry you build.
To be clear about the usage of datum objects in families, they are not required to construct 
geometry; however, if you are conﬁdent that what you are about to model in the Family Editor 
will need to ﬂex (have a modiﬁable length, angle, location, and so on) from within the rules 
of the family, then it is important that you begin by ﬁrst creating the rules that will allow the 
geometry to move.
With few exceptions, you do not want to give parameters to the geometry itself. Instead, you will 
want to create the necessary reference planes, lines, and points ﬁrst. Then associate the param-
eters to these references and whenever possible test the parameters to make sure the refer-
ences are ﬂexing properly. Once you are conﬁdent the references are ﬂexing, you can build the 

644 | CHAPTER 15 DESIGNING WITH THE FAMILY EDITOR 
geometry in context to the references, again testing to make certain that when the references 
ﬂex, the geometry is ﬂexing as well.
The type of datum object you use is based on how you want the geometry to ﬂex.
Reference Planes  These deﬁne a single plane that can be set to host sketch lines or geom-
etry. They’re best for controlling linear geometric relationships—that is to say, geometry 
that will ﬂex in a linear fashion. Reference planes do not have endpoints. This is important 
because you do not want to use reference planes for controlling angular or directional 
relationships.
As illustrated in the plan view of the Desk.rfa family, the linear parameters of Depth and 
Width are appropriately assigned to reference planes. All of these geometric constraints are 
parallel to one another (Figure 15.12).
Figure 15.12 
Reference planes con-
trolling the parameters 
of the default  
Desk.rfa family
Reference Lines  By deﬁnition these datum objects have endpoints and are great for con-
trolling angular and directional relationships. They can have four axes of reference, two 
along the length of the line (which are perpendicular to each other) and one at each end that 
is perpendicular to the line.
You can also create curved reference lines, but they have only planes that may be used for 
hosting at each end. There are no references along the curved line, as shown in Figure 15.13.
As an example, reference lines can be established in a family with length and angular 
dimension parameters to control path geometry for sweeps such as the iterations shown in 
Figure 15.14.
Reference Points  This type of datum object is available only in certain family templates, 
including Mass, Generic Model Adaptive, Generic Model-Pattern Based, and Curtain Panel-
Pattern Based. Reference points have three planes that can be set to host sketch lines or 
geometry. You can also use a series of points to control a line or even a spline. Other objects, 
such as reference lines or other geometric surfaces, can also host reference points. You can 
select reference points from the Draw panel in the ribbon, as shown in Figure 15.15.

646 | CHAPTER 15 DESIGNING WITH THE FAMILY EDITOR 
Setting the Behavior of Reference Planes and Lines
When you place a new reference plane or line or select one already in your family, you will 
notice a property in the Properties palette called Is Reference. This setting is an important factor 
in how the family will behave when it is placed in a project. It affects how you can dimension or 
align to the family as follows:
Not A Reference  The reference will be used only to control geometry in the Family Editor.
Weak Reference  The reference can be accessed for measurement in the project environ-
ment only by pressing the Tab key on the keyboard.
Strong Reference  The reference has the highest priority for dimensions and alignment. 
Temporary dimensions are displayed at the strong reference data.
In the Family Editor, reference planes also have other available values for the Is Reference 
property including Top, Back, Bottom, Left, Right, and Front. These values are all strong refer-
ences and are provided to help you better organize your family geometry.
You will also notice that symbolic lines have a property called Reference with settings identi-
cal to those for the Is Reference property of reference planes and reference lines. We recommend 
that you treat symbolic lines with the same care as the datum objects.
Use the strong and weak references sparingly throughout your family. The default setting for 
the Is Reference property is Weak Reference; therefore, there could be a large number of possi-
bilities for measurement within every component in your project. For every strong or weak refer-
ence, Revit must analyze the reference when you are annotating or designing.
Setting the Insertion Point
After you have chosen an appropriate family template, the rest is pretty ﬂexible. If you make 
any mistakes, you will probably be able to recover most if not all of your work to correct the 
problem. But some considerations should come before others, which is why we believe that the 
insertion point is the next most critical criterion on your list for family creation.
First, the insertion point determines the location about which the family will geometrically 
ﬂex. But second (and often more importantly), the insertion point is the point of reference when 
two family components are exchanged. This is critical if the “design” family that you have used 
as a placeholder is being swapped out for something more speciﬁc at a later date. If the insertion 
points are not established similarly between families, the location of the new family will not 
agree with the location of the old one.
For example, most of the tables in the default Revit furniture library deﬁne the insertion 
point at the center of the geometry, as shown in Figure 15.16. If you place one table family in 
your project and then later decide to swap it for a different table family, there should be mini-
mal disruption to the layout of other furniture in your design. The new family will appear in 
roughly the same spot as the originally placed family. Now what happens if you were to down-
load a table family from a web-based content provider? Will that table also follow the same 
convention for the location of the insertion point? This concern illustrates the importance of fol-
lowing published guidelines or standards for content creation.
Keep in mind that changing the insertion point is easy. As you might expect, you do not 
move the geometry to the insertion point. Rather, you simply select two reference planes and 
then make sure the Deﬁnes Origin parameter is selected in the Properties palette. Continuing 
with this chapter’s exercise using the Furniture.rft or Metric Furniture.rft template, the 
two reference planes provided already are assigned the Deﬁnes Origin property. You will now 
start to build a geometric framework around these reference planes.

DEVELOPING THE FRAMEWORK FOR A FAMILY COMPONENT | 647
Figure 15.16 
Insertion point for 
default table families
Let’s place some reference planes in the new family to ofﬁcially begin the chapter exercise.
1. Activate the Ref. Level ﬂoor plan in the Project Browser. From the Create tab in the rib-
bon, click the Reference Plane command and sketch four new reference planes around 
the two existing reference planes, as shown in Figure 15.17.
Figure 15.17 
Adding new refer-
ence planes to the 
exercise family
The exact placement of the new planes does not matter for now.
2. Select the reference plane you added to the left of the center plane, and in the Properties 
palette set its Name parameter to Left. (In Revit 2018, you can select the reference plane, 
and on both ends you will see the words Click to name or the predeﬁned name for the ref-
erence plane. Click this area and input the name.)
Assigning a name to a reference plane will allow you to use it later as a work plane for 
creating solid forms.
3. Select the reference plane you added to the right and set its Name parameter to Right. 
Select the one near the top of the view and name it Back; then select the one near the bot-
tom of the view and name it Front.
 
4. Activate the Front elevation view and add another reference plane above and parallel to the 
Ref. Level. Again, the exact placement does not matter for now—just make sure it is parallel 
to the level. In the Properties palette, set the Name parameter for this reference plane to Top.

648 | CHAPTER 15 DESIGNING WITH THE FAMILY EDITOR 
The Is Reference property for these new reference planes will be set to the default value of 
Weak Reference. That is acceptable because these will be the major geometrical references of 
the table family. As an option, you can set the four reference planes in the plan view to Strong 
Reference and observe later how they behave in the project environment.
Using Dimensions to Control Geometric Parameters
Dimensions are useful for controlling the geometric parameters of your families; however, we 
recommend they be placed directly on reference planes and lines and not within the sketches 
of solid or void forms. When you start to construct a component family, you should ﬁrst lay out 
any reference planes or lines and then add dimensions to the references—all before you create 
any solid geometry.
As you complete the exercise steps in this section, you will be creating the framework for 
solid geometry that you will build in subsequent sections of this chapter.
1. With the Front elevation view still active, start the Aligned Dimension command. You 
can access this command in the Measure panel of the Create tab in the ribbon, in the 
Annotate tab, or by pressing DI to activate the default keyboard shortcut. Place a dimen-
sion from the Ref. Level to the reference plane labeled “Top” you previously created.
This process will consist of three mouse clicks: one on the Ref. Level datum object, one on 
the reference plane above, and a ﬁnal click in open space to place the dimension string. 
Use the Tab key to cycle through the selection options to help you pick.
2. Press the Esc key or click Modify in the ribbon to exit the Dimension command, and then 
select the dimension you just placed. To make this dimension parametric, locate the Label 
Dimension panel and choose the Create Parameter tool. The Parameter Properties dialog 
box will appear, as shown in Figure 15.18. In the Name ﬁeld type Height, and make sure 
the Type radio button is selected.
Figure 15.18 
Assign your ﬁrst 
dimension to a new 
parameter.

DEVELOPING THE FRAMEWORK FOR A FAMILY COMPONENT | 649
3. Click OK to continue. The dimension will now display with the preﬁx Height =.
The exact height does not matter because you can control it later on through parameter 
manipulation.
4. Activate the Ref. Level ﬂoor plan. You now need to ensure that the four new reference 
planes are equally placed around the two planes that deﬁne the family origin. After the 
equality constraints are established, you will place dimensions to control the overall length 
and width of the shape. The order of this procedure—equality and then overall dimension—
should be followed to establish the correct relationship with a center-based origin.
5. Place an aligned dimension between the three vertical reference planes and then click 
the EQ symbol near the dimension string. Repeat this process for the horizontal reference 
planes so that the result looks like Figure 15.19.
Figure 15.19 
Set equality con-
straints on reference 
planes ﬁrst.
6. Next, you will add the dimensions that will actually control the overall size of the shape 
in plan. Place an aligned dimension between the outer two vertical reference planes and 
then place a dimension between the outer two horizontal reference planes.
7. Exit the Dimension command and select the horizontal dimension string. From the Label 
Dimension panel create a new parameter. Name the new parameter Length and then click 
OK. Repeat this process for the vertical dimension string, and name the parameter Width.
The result should look similar to Figure 15.20.
Figure 15.20

parameters in the plan.

650 | CHAPTER 15 DESIGNING WITH THE FAMILY EDITOR 
Should Everything Be Parametric?
When you start assigning dimensions to datum objects in your families, take a moment to think 
about whether you will need to modify those dimensions to create iterations of the component. 
Creating too many unnecessary labeled dimensions can make a family more complex, thus poten-
tially degrading performance of your project ﬁles and potentially over-constraining your model. 
If the dimension is a ﬁxed dimension that will not change between types, then either use an 
unlabeled dimension or do not dimension it at all. For example, in our table-building exercise, the 
height might be ﬁxed at 2′-6″ (750 mm); therefore, the Height parameter would not be needed.
Modifying Parametric Dimensions 
Now that you have established some dimensions and assigned them to family parameters, it 
is time to ﬂex the geometry—a term that has become popular with Revit users since the early 
adoption years of the software. You ﬂex your references by applying varying dimension val-
ues to conﬁrm that no errors are generated and that the references are behaving the way you 
intended. Doing this early and often in the family-building process reduces the chance of 
encountering a problem that you cannot solve later. When you have more forms and more com-
plex parametric relationships, it becomes more difﬁcult to unravel problematic geometry.
There are two ways you can modify the parametric dimensions, thus ﬂexing your family 
geometry. First, you can simply select a labeled dimension in the drawing area and enter a new 
value. The second way is different than in the project environment, where you must ﬁrst select 
one of the objects a dimension references before editing the value. Although this method seems 
to be the easiest and most intuitive, you must be careful after you have established deﬁned types 
within the family because direct manipulation of labeled dimensions will change the value of 
the active type. For this reason, we recommend you become accustomed to using the Family 
Types dialog box to ﬂex your families.
In the Properties panel click the Family Types command. Move the dialog box off to the side 
so you can still see the drawing area and observe the reference planes and dimensions. In the 
Family Types dialog box, click the New button and create a new type named Type 1. Set the 
dimension parameters as follows and then click Apply:
Width = 2′-6″ (750 mm)
Length = 6′-0″ (1800 mm)
Height = 2′-6″ (750 mm)
Click the New button again and create a new type named Type 2. Set the dimension param-
eters as follows and then click Apply:
Width = 3′-0″ (900 mm)
Length = 8′-0″ (2400 mm)
Height = 2′-6″ (750 mm)
If the reference planes and dimensions were created properly, you should not receive any 
error messages while you are ﬂexing the parameters. If you do receive any errors, you could 
delete the dimensions and even the reference planes and start over. If this were to happen later 
in the process, it would be more difﬁcult to resolve the problem.

Type Naming
In the previous exercise, you created two types within the family simply named Type 1 and 
Type 2. You might have also noticed that other families in the default libraries have type names 
that indicate some sort of size information. For example, the door family Single-Flush has types 
named according to the respective length and width such as 36″ × 84″. Te problem here is 
that the type name is not automatically linked to any parameters in the family; therefore, if a 
parameter value is modiﬁed and the type is not renamed, the situation can become confusing 
to users working in your project. However, since this is a common feature for selecting doors, 
we recommend naming it based on how it would be easiest to select in the project. If you choose 
names based on parameters that can change, make sure to verify those properties. A door sched-
ule would be great for this.
Tere is no single, correct answer to the type-naming conundrum. You can use speciﬁc type names 
(36″ × 84″) to help the users of your content decide which type to select, or you can choose generic 
names (Type 1) to avoid conﬂicts. One possible conﬂict could arise if you use the type name of a 
family in a schedule. For example, if you generated a door schedule that used the type name instead 
of the actual width and height parameters, there might be inconsistency with the actual dimensions 
versus those in the user-deﬁned name.
A relatively safe methodology is to use more detailed type-naming conventions such as Material - 
Nominal Size to help content users better understand the available choices. An example for a door 
family might be Wood - 36 × 84. And then, as a standard practice, do not use the type name in any 
schedules for production documentation.
Reviewing the Diﬀerences Between Type and Instance Parameters 
In the previous exercise, you created a few dimension-based parameters that were set to be type 
parameters. Let’s review the difference between a type parameter and an instance parameter, 
keeping in mind that they can be switched at just about any time.
The key difference between the two is that modifying a type parameter always modiﬁes all 
instances of the type. Think of a type as a set of identical elements. Change one item in the set, 
and all the other items of that type in the model change to match. Door sizes are a good example 
of this. Doors come in standard sizes: 32″, 34″, 36″ (800 mm, 850 mm, 900 mm). On the other 
hand, an instance parameter modiﬁes only the instances that you have selected. A good use 
of an instance parameter would be the ﬁre rating on a door. Not every 36″ (900 mm) door will 
be ﬁre rated, so you will need to individually identify which ones are. Figure 15.21 shows the 
parameters of a default curtain wall door family.
In Figure 15.21, the parameters that have the notation (Default) are instance parameters. 
There are other parameters that can be used to report dynamic values from within the family. 
These are shown with the (Report) notation. In the example of a standard door, dimensions such 
as Width, Height, and Thickness would be best established as type parameters because you 
would not want users to create random or arbitrary values. Also be aware that once a param-
eter is created, only some aspects of the parameter can be modiﬁed. You cannot change the 
Discipline or Type Of Parameter value after the parameter has been created.

Sorting Parameters
Complex families can have many parameters that control geometry, information, materials, and 
so on. To make it easier for your team to ﬁnd parameters eﬃciently, you can sort them in any way 
that you deem appropriate for use. When the Family Types dialog box is open in the Family Editor, 
use the Move Up and Move Down buttons to organize your parameters. When the family is loaded 
into a project, this sorting order will be seen in the Properties palette and in the Type Properties 
dialog box.
On the other hand, each new option can create a lot of new types. By default, loading a family 
into your project will also load all the types. If you want to create the potential for many types but 
be selective about which types are loaded, you can use a type catalog to load only speciﬁc types.
Using Type Catalogs
If you are creating a family that will have many different type iterations, you can consider using 
a type catalog instead of creating each iteration within the Family Editor. A type catalog is a text 
ﬁle that contains all the iterations of the parameters speciﬁed within a family. When you load a 
family into a project that has an associated type catalog, such as steel framing families, you are 
presented with a dialog box within which you can select one or more types (Figure 15.22). You 
can select multiple types by pressing the Ctrl or Shift key.

DEVELOPING THE FRAMEWORK FOR A FAMILY COMPONENT | 653
Figure 15.22 
A type catalog allows 
you to choose types 
to load.
If you ever need to load additional types from a family you have already loaded in your 
project, you do not have to locate the original family ﬁle. Instead, locate the family in the Project 
Browser, right-click it, and then select Reload.
When you generate a type catalog, the easiest method is to ﬁrst use the Export Types com-
mand from the Application menu. This process will export all available parameters and any 
types you have established in your family to an appropriately formatted syntax. Save the TXT 
ﬁle in the same location as the associated RFA ﬁle and with the same ﬁlename. For example, the 
type catalog associated with the W-Wide Flange.rfa family ﬁle is named W-Wide Flange.txt. 
Using the same ﬁlename is critical to using a type catalog because that is how Revit will associ-
ate the two ﬁles.
Open the TXT ﬁle with a text editor such as Notepad or Notepad++. Or you can open the ﬁle 
as a comma-delimited table in Microsoft Excel—as long as you save the ﬁle back to TXT format 
when you ﬁnish editing. Be sure to have the TXT ﬁle in the same folder as its family counterpart, 
as Revit looks for them together.
The ﬁrst row of the type catalog will be a header that establishes the purpose for each col-
umn in the table. The syntax for the header is as follows:
ParameterName##ParameterType##ParameterUnits
Table 15.1 lists valid entries for ParameterType with the proper method for declaring them in 
the type catalog header. For measurement parameters such as Length and Area, the units can be 
adapted accordingly. Where the parameter declaration is listed as ParameterName, you will sub-
stitute a user-deﬁned parameter name. Otherwise, the parameter name is built into the family 
and cannot be changed.

The ﬁrst column in the table is where you will list the types within the family. In the ﬁrst 
row of the table, the ﬁrst value is blank—that is, the ﬁrst row will begin with a comma delimiter 
when it is saved as a TXT ﬁle. After the header row is ﬁlled with parameter declarations and a 
list of type names is entered in the ﬁrst column, you can start populating the values in the rest 
of the catalog. Figure 15.23 shows a sample of a type catalog opened in Excel.

Organizing Solids and Lines in a Family Editor
When you get beyond the basic geometric controls in families that are dictated by datum objects 
and dimensions, there are three other ways you can organize the solids and symbolic lines you 
create in a family.
 
◆
Object styles and subcategories
 
◆
Visibility settings
 
◆
Materials
Each of these three methods of control is directly related to the 3D and 2D content you gener-
ate. In other words, you must apply these settings directly to the solids and lines in a family. We 
will ﬁrst review each method, and then you will learn about family-modeling techniques in the 
next section.
Using Object Styles and Subcategories
Let’s get back to the exercise ﬁle and discuss object styles and subcategories. As mentioned ear-
lier in this chapter, Revit has a predeﬁned number of family categories. These categories deﬁne 
how elements display, schedule, export, and so on. Even though these main object categories 
cannot be modiﬁed, you can create subcategories for model, annotation, and imported objects.
Although you can use subcategories to control the visibility of some part of the family, keep 
in mind that the detail level and visibility settings already manage visibility. The subcategories 
are most important when you are exporting your project because each category and subcategory 
is permitted its own CAD layer or IFC classiﬁcation (Figure 15.24).
Figure 15.24 
Export options 
for categories and 
subcategories
So if your project is being exported to CAD in such a way that you will need to associate 
objects with granular layer settings, creating and assigning subcategories to elements is neces-
sary. Although it is best not to rely on subcategories to manage visibility, we will show you how 
to create a new subcategory in the exercise ﬁle and then assign geometry to it.
In your exercise ﬁle, switch to the Manage tab and choose Object Styles. In the Object Styles 
dialog box, click the New button and create a new subcategory named Tables, as shown in 
Figure 15.25. Click OK to close both dialog boxes.

656 | CHAPTER 15 DESIGNING WITH THE FAMILY EDITOR 
Figure 15.25 
Create a new family 
subcategory.
Remember that unless you speciﬁcally need to isolate tables from other types of furniture in 
your project, you should not create too many subcategories because doing so creates an oppor-
tunity for inconsistency. What if someone else on your team created a different table family and 
added a subcategory called Table? When both families are loaded into a project, you will have 
two subcategories: Tables and Table.
Subcategories must be assigned to solid geometry or symbolic lines in the family in order 
to be used in the project environment. We will discuss this in the “Modeling Techniques in the 
Family Editor” section later in this chapter.
Assigning Visibility Settings
The time it takes for Revit to generate or regenerate a view depends on how much stuff in the 
view needs to be displayed. When you are building smaller parts of a larger component (or if 
the elements are not visible in certain orientations), you should assign those elements to reveal 
themselves only at a certain level of detail (or in certain views). Doing so prevents the software 
from managing more information than necessary and helps you keep your views uncluttered.
The Revit Model Content Style Guide previously published by Autodesk lists guidelines for 
assigning geometry to the three detail levels available in project views (Table 15.2).

DEVELOPING THE FRAMEWORK FOR A FAMILY COMPONENT | 657
To practice using these visibility settings, download and open the ﬁle c15 Desk Project.rvt 
from this book’s web page. The sample project contains the default Desk.rfa family that is 
loaded in the Revit default project template. We have created a working sheet in which three 3D 
views have been placed with different Detail Level properties. Notice that all of the drawer faces 
and hardware are displayed in every view, despite the Detail Level assignments.
Starting with Existing Content
Many of us have downloaded Revit families from a number of widely available online sources to get 
a ﬁrst design pass at a piece of content. BIMObject, Revit City, and the AUGI forums are all great 
places to start. But when you download a family component, take a moment to make sure that the 
detail level and orientation of detail are appropriate.
Double-click any one of the viewports you see in the sample sheet view to activate a view. 
Select one of the desks; then from the contextual tab in the ribbon, click Edit Family. You should 
be in a 3D view once the Desk.rfa family opens. If you are not, activate the default 3D view. 
Select the two sets of drawer handles; press the Ctrl key to select multiple items. From the con-
textual tab in the ribbon, choose Visibility Settings. In the Family Element Visibility Settings 
dialog box (Figure 15.26), uncheck the boxes for Coarse and Medium. Because these handles 
are smaller than 1′ (300 mm), they should be seen only when a view’s Detail Level is set to Fine. 
Also uncheck the Left/Right option because viewing the handles from the side might not be 
that valuable in a section or interior elevation view.

Notice that the box for the Plan/RCP option is unchecked. This is appropriate for the desk 
because little more than the surface of the top of the desk needs to show up in the plan. The legs, 
the hardware, and even the faces of the drawers do not need to show up in the plan. Click OK to 
close the dialog box.
Next, select the drawer faces and then click the Visibility Settings tool. This geometry range 
is 1′ – 3′ (300–900 mm), so it should display at Medium and Fine detail levels. Also uncheck the 
Left/Right option (Figure 15.27) and then click OK to close the dialog box.
From any tab in the ribbon, choose Load Into Project and then select the c15 Desk Project.rvt 
ﬁle if you are prompted. Choose the option to overwrite the existing version, and return to the 
sample sheet view. You will now see that the appropriate geometry is displaying only at the 
most appropriate detail levels in each view (Figure 15.28).

DEVELOPING THE FRAMEWORK FOR A FAMILY COMPONENT | 659
Using Materials
Materials are crucial to a family. But what are often more important are the Shading setting and 
the Transparency value of the material because they communicate much about the intent of your 
design in the early stages (Figure 15.29).
Figure 15.29 
Shading and 
Transparency set-
tings in the Material 
Browser dialog box
In addition, material options are often not easily created in Revit. Yes, a family can have a 
material parameter. However, expressing many different materials for visualization purposes is 
probably best left to visualization specialists, who understand the subtleties of creating a com-
pelling image and not just a rendering of a working model. It is unlikely they will be using Revit 
for this purpose.
Beyond visualization, materials in Revit are used for a host of other things. Graphic representa-
tion in construction documents and material takeoffs are two examples. If the materials in your fam-
ilies are something you will need to schedule or view graphically, it is a good idea to deﬁne them.
Multiple materials can be assigned to a family. They are assigned based on model solids, so if 
you have multiple solids (sweeps, extrusions, and the like), each one can be given a unique material.
You have two options to deﬁne a material within a family, both being handled in the solid’s 
object properties shown in the Properties palette. By default, the material is set to <By Category>. 
Select this option and you can change the material to any material currently loaded in the fam-
ily, or you can load a new one from any material library. This is a great use for the family if you 
know the material is not going to change. Once <By Category> is clicked, a gray button on the 
right side will appear. Select the small button and the Material Browser dialog box will appear. 
If you know that your casework is not going to be anything but blonde maple, for example, go 
ahead and set the material within the family by associating a material parameter to the object by 
selecting the Associate Family Parameter button. This option uses the tiny ellipsis to the right of 
the Material ﬁeld in the Properties palette to deﬁne a new parameter. In this case, you can call the 
material something like Casework Material. If you were to use this same parameter for all your 
casework families, once it is placed in the model you can change that material via the Material 
Browser dialog box, and it will update all your casework families at once.

Modeling Techniques in the Family Editor
Creating complex geometry is not always as easy as opening the Family Editor and starting to 
model the shape that you think you are trying to create. Sometimes you need to model one form 
in order to create another form. And sometimes you need to model a complex parameterized 
negative form to control a solid shape that you are trying to create. So that you understand these 
advanced techniques, we will ﬁrst cover the available geometry types that can be created in Revit.
There are ﬁve discrete geometry types in the Family Editor: Extrusion, Blend, Revolve, 
Sweep, and Swept Blend. Both solid and void forms can be modeled from these shapes. In this 
section you will learn how to create all of these types, along with the Family Editor technique of 
nesting families.
Which type you select is important, but our advice is to use the simplest form that will 
express what you are trying to model, keeping in mind how the geometry is likely to change.
Creating an Extrusion
Let’s get back to the furniture exercise where we are constructing a table. Activate the Ref. Level 
ﬂoor plan, and from the Create panel in the ribbon click Extrusion. The ﬁrst action we will take 
is to specify a work plane to host the extrusion. If you do not specify a work plane, the default 
plane will be the level associated with the current view.
1. In the Work Plane panel in the contextual tab of the ribbon, click Set. In the Name drop-
down list within the Work Plane dialog box, choose Reference Plane: Top, as shown in 
Figure 15.30.
2. In the Options bar, set the Depth to –0′-2″ (–50 mm).
This will allow the top of the extrusion to be aligned with the Top reference plane, with 
its thickness extruding downward—away from the work plane.

Figure 15.31 
Set the constraints of 
the extrusion sketch to 
reference planes.
3. In the Properties palette, set Subcategory to Tables. For the Material parameter, click the 
small button to the right of the parameter value ﬁeld.
This button will allow you to associate a family parameter to the property instead of sim-
ply choosing one material to be assigned to the solid.
4. Click the Add Parameter button and create a new parameter named Tabletop Material. 
Click OK to close both open dialog boxes, and then you will see that the Material ﬁeld is 
now inactive and the small button has an equal sign label.
This means that the property is now being controlled by a family parameter.
5. In the Draw panel, choose the Rectangle tool and then sketch a rectangle that snaps to the 
intersections of the outer reference planes (Left, Front, Right, and Back). Immediately after 
your second click to complete the sketch, you will see padlock icons at each of the four sides 
of the sketch. Click each one to establish an alignment constraint with the respective reference 
plane (Figure 15.31). If you click away and the constraint icons disappear, you will either have 
to delete and redraw the sketched lines or use the Align tool to reestablish the constraint.
Click Finish Edit Mode from the contextual tab in the ribbon, and you will see the ﬁrst 
solid piece of your exercise family. Activate a 3D view and open the Family Types dialog 
box. Switch between Type 1 and Type 2, and click Apply to verify that the extrusion ﬂexes 
like the reference planes did previously in the chapter.
6. Activate the Front elevation view, and add an aligned dimension from the Top reference 
plane to the bottom of the tabletop extrusion.
7. Select the dimension, and from the Label drop-down list in the Options bar, choose <Add 
Parameter…>. Name the new parameter Tabletop Thickness and then click OK.
8. Open the Family Types dialog box again, and set the Name drop-down list to Type 2. In 
the Tabletop Material parameter, click the ellipsis button to launch the Material Browser.
9. From the Material Browser, make sure the library panel is displayed by clicking the icon 
at the top of the document materials list. Search for oak at the top of the dialog box, and 
then select the material Wood (Oak) from the library panel. Click the up-arrow icon to 
load the material from the library into the family. In the Graphics tab of the Material 
Browser, check the box Use Render Appearance (Figure 15.32) and then click OK.

10. Set the Tabletop Thickness value to 4″ (100 mm) and then click Apply in the Family Types 
dialog box. Repeat steps 8, 9, and 10 for Type 1, but search for glass and load the material 
named Glass, Green. Set the Tabletop Thickness for Type 1 to 1″ (25 mm) and then click 
OK to close the Family Types dialog box.
Creating a Sweep
Let’s have a little fun and assign a void sweep to the edge of the tabletop. It will be unique 
because we only want the sweep to cut the tabletop when Type 2 is selected—it will not cut the 
top for Type 1.
A sweep is a 2D proﬁle that follows a path. The magic behind sweeps in the Family Editor is 
that a sweep path can be set to automatically follow other model geometry. A great example is the 
continuous tubular structure of the chair shown in Figure 15.33. As you can see in the sequence 
of images, a simpler solid form is generated, a path is generated along the edges of the void geom-
etry, a tube proﬁle is applied to the path, and the solid shape is made invisible. To explore how this 
family was made, download the ﬁle c15 Tube Chairs.rvt from this book’s web page.

MODELING TECHNIQUES IN THE FAMILY EDITOR | 663
Figure 15.34 
Use the Pick Path tool 
to select the edges of 
the solid tabletop.
In this part of the chapter exercise, you will create a void sweep along the outer edge of the 
tabletop using the Pick Path tool. You will then assign a parameter to drive the void into or away 
from the solid extrusion, depending on which type is speciﬁed.
1. Activate the default 3D view and set the graphic style in the view control bar to Shaded. 
Open the Family Types dialog box, select Type 2 in the Name drop-down list, and then 
click OK.
2. Load the proﬁle family c15 Table Void Profile.rfa that accompanied the 
exercise ﬁle.
3. From the Create tab, choose Void Forms ➢ Void Sweep. From the contextual tab in the rib-
bon, click Pick Path. In the 3D view, pick each of the four upper edges of the tabletop solid 
(Figure 15.34).
4. Click Finish Edit Mode (the green check mark) in the contextual tab of the ribbon to com-
plete the Pick Path command.
5. In the Sweep panel of the contextual tab, set the Proﬁle drop-down list to c15 Table Void 
Proﬁle.
6. Zoom into the area where the proﬁle is applied to the path, and make sure the curved 
part of the proﬁle is facing toward the tabletop solid (Figure 15.35). If it is not, click the 
Flip button in the Options bar.
7. Click Finish Edit Mode in the contextual tab in the ribbon, and the void will automati-
cally cut the tabletop solid.
When you create a void in the Family Editor, it will automatically cut any existing solids. If 
you do not want a void to automatically cut other geometry, you can create the elements as sol-
ids ﬁrst. When you are satisﬁed with the forms, select the appropriate solids and change them 
to voids in the Properties palette. Note that once a solid or a void is being cut by another object, 
you cannot change the solid/void property. You must use the Uncut Geometry tool ﬁrst.

ting Type 1 (glass)

Figure 15.35 
Adjust the sweep pro-
ﬁle to face the solid.
Because you used the Pick Path method to deﬁne the sweep path, the sweep will automati-
cally update as the shape of the tabletop changes. This exercise is a simple example of a power-
ful tool with a plethora of applications.
Now that you have created a void that cuts the solid geometry of the wood tabletop type, you 
need to adjust it so that the proﬁle does not cut the solid when the glass tabletop type is speci-
ﬁed. Unfortunately, you cannot simply turn the void sweep on and off, but you can adjust its 
horizontal offset so it cuts like a virtual sliding saw.
1. In the 3D view, select the void sweep. In the Properties palette, you will see the param-
eters that drive the proﬁle within the sweep. Click the Associate Family Parameter button 
next to the Horizontal Proﬁle Offset value.
2. Click the Add Parameter button. Create a new parameter named Trigger Cut and then 
click OK to close both dialog boxes.
3. Open the Family Types dialog box, and for Type 2, set the Trigger Cut value to 0′-0″ and 
then click Apply.
4. Switch to Type 1 and set the Trigger Cut value to –0′-4″ (–100 mm) and then click OK to 
close the dialog box. Figure 15.36 shows the difference between the two types just deﬁned.

MODELING TECHNIQUES IN THE FAMILY EDITOR | 665
Adding Tooltips
Tere have probably been times when you have pulled a family out of your library or a previous 
project to add to your model and you cannot remember what the parameters actually control. 
Parameters like Height or Length are pretty easy, but will you remember what the Trigger Cut does?
In the Family Editor you can add tooltips to your parameters. You can add up to 250 characters 
to describe your parameter and add some additional notes to how it is intended to be used. In the 
Parameters Properties dialog box you will see the Edit Tooltip button.
Clicking this button will allow you to add a message or description to your parameter to help 
explain its functionality.
Hovering your mouse over the parameter in the Parameter Properties dialog box will show the 
tooltip you have created.

666 | CHAPTER 15 DESIGNING WITH THE FAMILY EDITOR 
You will see that adding the negative value to the Horizontal Proﬁle Offset allows you to con-
trol whether the void cuts the solid tabletop. We simply assigned the offset value to each family 
type, but you could explore methods of using formulas with logic such as this:
If Tabletop Thickness < 4″ then Trigger Cut = –4″ else Trigger Cut = 0″
The actual syntax of this formula to be applied in the Family Types dialog box would be as 
follows:
if(Tabletop Thickness < 0′ 4″, -0′ 4″, 0′)
Creating a Revolve
Let’s move on to the process of creating the legs for the table. You will use the Revolve tool to 
create this shape; however, you will create the shape only once in a separate family that will be 
loaded into the table family and placed multiple times.
We have created a preloaded family for the purpose of this segment of the exercise. 
Download and open the ﬁle c15 Table Leg.rfa from this book’s web page. You will create a 
revolve form, assign height and material parameters, and then load it into the table family.
1. In the c15 Table Leg ﬁle, activate the Front elevation view. You will see that we have 
sketched a 2D proﬁle consisting of invisible lines.
These will not display when the leg family is loaded into the table family.
2. From the Create tab in the ribbon, click Revolve. From the Draw panel in the contextual 
tab, make sure the Pick Lines tool is selected. Hover the mouse pointer over one of the 
provided proﬁle lines and press the Tab key once; then click to select all the lines of  
the proﬁle.
Do not worry about constraining any of the sketch lines because this shape will not be 
dependent on adjacent geometry.
3. Click the Axis Line tool in the contextual tab, select the Pick Lines mode, and then click 
the vertical reference plane in the drawing area.
4. Click the Finish Edit Mode icon in the contextual tab to complete the Revolve command.
5. Add an aligned dimension between the Ref. Level and the reference plane above the 
revolve. Select the dimension, and in the Label Dimension panel choose the Create 
Parameter button. Name the new parameter Leg Height, and make sure it is a type 
parameter.
6. Select the solid revolve, and in the Properties palette click the Associate Family Parameter 
button for the Material property. Create a new parameter named Leg Material, and click 
OK to close the open dialog boxes.
Before you save the leg family and load it into the table family, you should consider whether 
the nested family needs to be scheduled—in the case of a table leg, probably not. However, you 
will load some chairs into the table family later, and those will surely need to be scheduled.
Switch to the Create tab, and from the Properties panel click the Family Category And 
Parameters button. In that dialog box, you will see a list of family parameters that contains a 
parameter called Shared. When this box is checked, the nested family can be scheduled. For 

MODELING TECHNIQUES IN THE FAMILY EDITOR | 667
example, if you checked the box for the table leg family, loaded it into the table family, loaded 
the table family into a project, and then placed several instances of the table, you could create 
a schedule to count the total number of table legs in the project. For a later exercise, leave the 
Shared box unchecked.
Creating a Blend and Swept Blend
When you create a blend, you are essentially combining two different shapes. Say you have a 
circle and want to transition it to a square. Creating that geometry by using an extrusion and 
voids would be complicated, but creating it with a blend is simple (see Figure 15.37).
Figure 15.37 
A simple blend of a 
square and circle
The only difference between a blend and a swept blend is that a blend is deﬁned along a straight 
line starting on a work plane. A swept blend is along a user-deﬁned path. Figure 15.38 demon-
strates a swept blend between a smaller square and a larger square along a user-deﬁned path.
Figure 15.38 
A swept blend

668 | CHAPTER 15 DESIGNING WITH THE FAMILY EDITOR 
Both types of blends can incorporate a variety of shapes and proﬁles. Using the context of 
furniture that we have established, you will create a swept blend. You are going to create a 
wooden stool.
1. To begin, create a family from the default furniture family template. You are going to cre-
ate a three-sided stool, starting with the legs. When you open the default furniture fam-
ily, you will be in the Ref. Plane view. In this view, choose the Swept Blend tool from the 
Create tab.
The Swept Blend tool has its own contextual menu, shown in Figure 15.39. You will cre-
ate a path for the sweep and the starting and ending shapes. As you can see, the software 
ﬁrst wants you to deﬁne a path.
Figure 15.39 
Te Swept Blend 
contextual menu
2. Choose the Front elevation view to start the path, and pick the Sketch Path button from 
the Swept Blend panel. Using the Line tool (which is selected by default), start a line from 
10″ (250 mm) to the left of the base and continue until it intersects with the vertical plane 
at a 73° angle. You will have a measurement roughly 2′-10″ (865 mm) across the hypot-
enuse of the triangle (Figure 15.40). Click the green check mark to accept the path.
Now you need to make the base of your leg.
Figure 15.40 
Creating the leg sweep

MODELING TECHNIQUES IN THE FAMILY EDITOR | 669
3. Open the Ref. View and you will see two red dots and a line connecting them. The dot on 
the left is the base of the leg, the dot on the right is the top of the leg, and the line between 
is the path you just created. Starting with the base, choose the Select Proﬁle 1 button and 
then the Edit Proﬁle button (Figure 15.41).
Figure 15.41 
Modify the two 
proﬁles to create the 
swept blend.
4. Using the left red dot as a center point, create a circle 1″ (25 mm) in diameter. Click the 
green check mark and then the Finish Edit Mode button to complete the shape.
Next, you need to create the top of the leg.
5. Select the Select Proﬁle 2 button and then Edit Proﬁle from the Swept Blend panel. Using 
the y-reference plane as the right side of the box, create a rectangle centered on the x-axis 
1″ × 3″ (25 mm × 75 mm). You can draw the rectangle the correct size anywhere and then 
move it into place if that makes it easier for you. Click Finish Edit Mode when you have 
ﬁnished. The two shapes will look like Figure 15.42.
Figure 15.42 
Finishing the two 
shapes of the blend
6. With those two proﬁles and a path complete, click Finish Edit Mode again to complete the 
sweep. You now have one leg of your stool.
7. To ﬁnish the base, select the leg and choose the Array tool. In the Options bar, set these 
options:
 
◆
Choose a radial array.
 
◆
Leave the Number of arrayed items at 3.
 
◆
Change Angle to 360.

670 | CHAPTER 15 DESIGNING WITH THE FAMILY EDITOR 
 
◆
Change the rotation center to the middle of the x-y reference planes.
 
◆
The array is completed by accepting the number based on the next or last iteration 
with your settings.
You should now have a set of stool legs (Figure 15.43).

8. From this point, use the techniques explained earlier in the chapter to add a round stool 
seat and a bar near the base for your feet.
Figure 15.44 shows the ﬁnished stool. There are a few ways to create the seat and bar—it 
can be with a swept blend, an extrusion, or even a revolve.
Figure 15.44

MODELING TECHNIQUES IN THE FAMILY EDITOR | 671
You can ﬁnd the ﬁnished family on the book’s web page. The ﬁle is called c15-WoodenStool.rfa.  
Before continuing with the table-modeling exercise, let’s take a moment to discuss the impor-
tance of nested families in comparison to modeling repetitive geometry all within one family. 
Families are used to create individual components. By combining those components, you can 
use a nested family to add parameters to better deﬁne the relationships between those compo-
nents and best leverage the families within your project.
Nesting Families
Geometry from one family can be loaded into another family. This process is called nesting, 
and it allows you to create a single element that will be used many times in another family. 
This method is much more efﬁcient than creating an element and then grouping and copying it 
around the same family. Let’s review some beneﬁts of using nested families.
When one family is loaded into another, the nested family behaves as a single, uniﬁed com-
ponent. This means it will be much easier to change and control the instance placements of a 
nested family. Even though the nested family may seem like a static component, references and 
parameters in nested families can be driven by controls in the host family.
A nested family can also be controlled by a Family Type parameter, which will allow you 
to select from multiple nested families as another parameter in the host family. This feature is 
incredibly powerful for creating design iteration within families that are in your projects. You 
will see this functionality later in this chapter when you load two different chair families into 
the table family and use a Family Type parameter to select between them.
As a ﬁnal note about nested families, you should always be aware of the insertion point 
deﬁned in the families you load into other families. As we mentioned previously in this chapter, 
a consistent insertion point will ensure that a nested family does not “ﬂip-ﬂop” in unintended 
directions when you switch between family types.
Let’s get back to the exercise on which you should still be working in the c15 Table Leg 
family ﬁle:
1. Make sure the earlier table family is still open. Save the leg family and then click the 
Load Into Project button in the ribbon. You will now place multiple instances of the leg 
family, associate the parameters, and adjust the visibility for control of an optional  
leg instance.
2. Switch to the c15 Table ﬁle, and activate the Ref. Level ﬂoor plan. From the Create tab, 
click the Component tool, and the c15 Table Leg family should be the active component in 
the Type Selector. Look in the Properties palette at the Host property, and make sure that 
it is Level: Ref. Level. Place four instances of the leg near the corners of the table and one 
exactly at the crossing of the center reference planes.
3. Add dimensions for each of the four corner legs, and adjust the legs as necessary so that 
they are offset exactly 6″ (150 mm) from each edge reference plane (Figure 15.45). Lock 
these dimensions to preserve the offset.
4. Select the middle leg, and in the Properties palette click the Associate Family Parameter 
button for the Visible property. Click the Add Parameter button, and name the new 
parameter Middle Leg. This will be a Yes/No parameter that can be controlled with a 
logic formula that will be driven by the length of the table.

672 | CHAPTER 15 DESIGNING WITH THE FAMILY EDITOR 
Figure 15.45 
Leg families are placed 
and dimensioned in a 
plan view.
5. Open the Family Types dialog box, and in the Formula ﬁeld for the Middle Leg param-
eter type the following: Length > 7′ (for metric, type Length > 2000 mm).
This simple formula will make the middle leg visible when the Length parameter exceeds 
7′ (2000 mm) and invisible when it does not.
6. Switch to a 3D view, and now you will need to assign dimensional parameters to drive 
the leg heights in relation to the table.
You can do this a few different ways, but when you are dealing with multiple instances of 
an object, we recommend you feed a value into a nested type parameter rather than align 
and lock each instance to reference planes within the host family.
7. Select one of the legs and then click the Edit Type button in the Properties palette. In the 
Type Properties dialog box, click the Assign Family Parameter (AFP) button for the Leg 
Height parameter. Add a new parameter named Nested Leg Height.
8. Click the AFP button for the Leg Material parameter, and add a new parameter named 
Nested Leg Material. Click OK to close the Type Properties dialog box.
You must associate the parameters in nested families with parameters in the host family, 
even if it is simply to allow materials to be assigned to the nested elements.
9. Open the Family Types dialog box. In the Formula ﬁeld for the Nested Leg Height param-
eter, type the following: Height - Tabletop Thickness.
Make sure that the parameters are spelled exactly because they are case sensitive. This 
formula will use the overall height of the table minus the thickness of the tabletop to 
drive the height of the nested legs.
10. Switch between Type 1 and Type 2 to verify the behavior of the legs. Even though the 
middle leg is still visible in the Family Editor, it will be invisible when the family is 
loaded into the project environment.

MODELING TECHNIQUES IN THE FAMILY EDITOR | 673
Save the table family and load it into the c15 Desk Project ﬁle, referenced previously in 
this chapter. Place some instances of each type and observe the differences in size and 
number of legs (Figure 15.46).
Figure 15.46 
Te two family types 
placed in a project
11. Select one of the Type 1 instances of the c15 Table family and then click Edit Type from 
the Properties palette. Locate the Nested Leg Material parameter and launch the Material 
Browser.
12. Search for white and load the material named Metal, Paint Finish, White, and Matte from 
the library into the project. In the Graphics tab, check the box Use Render Appearance 
and then click OK in the Material Browser to assign it to the Nested Leg Material. Click 
OK to close the Type Properties dialog box.
13. Select one of the Type 2 instances and assign the Wood (Oak) material to the Nested Leg 
Material parameter.

674 | CHAPTER 15 DESIGNING WITH THE FAMILY EDITOR 
Troubleshooting Techniques
Now that you have created a basic component and explored some of the fundamental modeling 
techniques, let’s look at some additional methods and troubleshooting you might experience 
working on a real project.
Doing a Visibility Check
In the c15 Desk Project.rvt ﬁle, open the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box and expand 
the Furniture category. Uncheck the box for the Tables subcategory and then click OK to close 
the dialog box. You will notice that only the tabletops have been turned off in the drawing area, 
as shown in Figure 15.47.
Figure 15.47 
Visibility set-
tings applied to a 
subcategory
Open the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box again and uncheck the box for the 
Furniture category. Click OK, and you will see that the desks and even the table legs have been 
turned off in the view. Even though the nested table leg family was created with the Generic 
Model family template, it will behave according to the main category of the host family; how-
ever, this does not apply to subcategories. Let’s go through the process to ﬁx the problem.
1. Go back to the c15 Table Leg family, and from the Create tab, click the Family Category 
And Parameters tool. Change the Family Category to Furniture and then click OK.
The family category must be changed to Furniture to avoid confusion with object style 
subcategories. If you create a subcategory under Generic Models named Tables and then 
reload the nested leg family in the table, there will be two separate subcategories named 
Tables.
2. Switch to the Manage tab and then choose Object Styles. In the Object Styles dialog box, 
click the New button and name the new subcategory Tables.
Remember to use careful planning when naming subcategories within your custom fami-
lies. As mentioned earlier in this chapter, inconsistency with subcategories can lead to 
problems with view templates, graphics, exporting, and printing.

TROUBLESHOOTING TECHNIQUES | 675
3. In the drawing area, select the solid revolve, and in the Properties palette, set the 
Subcategory parameter to Tables.
4. Save the family and then click the Load Into Project command in the ribbon. First, reload 
the leg family into the table family and then reload the table family into the c15 Desk 
Project.rvt ﬁle. When prompted, choose the option to overwrite the existing family.
You will now notice in c15 Desk Project.rvt that the table legs are turned off along 
with the other elements of the tables.
When you are editing a nested family, you could reload the family directly into the project 
without reloading it into the host family. We recommend working your way back through each 
family so that the original host family RFA ﬁle is maintained in your project content library.
Applying Parametric Arrays and Family Type Parameters
For the ﬁnal exercise, you will work with additional nested families, but you will now learn how 
to apply a Family Type parameter and use parametric arrays. The steps in the following exer-
cises must be carefully applied in the correct order or the ﬂexibility in the family may be dis-
rupted. More complex families are prone to errors if you build them quickly and without care, 
so take your time and review each step along the way.
You will begin by loading two different chair families into the c15 Table.rfa family. 
Download the ﬁles Chair-Dining-1.rfa and Chair-Dining-2.rfa from this book’s web page. 
These modiﬁed families were originally downloaded from the RevitCity.com website.
1. In the c15 Table.rfa ﬁle, activate the Ref. Level ﬂoor plan. From the Create tab in the 
ribbon, click the Component tool. If you have not already loaded the two chair families, 
click the Load Family command in the ribbon.
2. From the Type Selector, choose the Chair-Dining-1 family and place one chair along the 
upper edge of the table.
Remember to press the spacebar to rotate the chair as needed before you place it.
3. Exit the Component command and select the chair you placed in the previous step. In the 
Label Dimensions panel, choose the Create Parameter button. Create a new parameter 
named Chair Type. Note that the parameter type is <Family Type>.
This kind of parameter will let you apply different families that are nested in the host 
family.
Also, it is important that all nested families with which you intend to use a family type 
parameter must be of the same category. For example, one of the chairs originally down-
loaded from the RevitCity.com website was assigned to the Furniture Systems category, 
whereas the other was in the Furniture category. Therefore, the two nested families could 
not be assigned to the same family type parameter.
4. With the chair still selected, click the Edit Type button in the Properties palette. Click the 
AFP button for the Chair Material parameter. Create a new parameter named Nested 
Chair Material and then click OK to close the open dialog boxes.
5. From the Modify tab in the ribbon, click the Align tool. As shown in Figure 15.48, click 
the Back reference plane (1) and then the Center Front/Back Reference Plane within the 
chair (2). Finally, click the padlock icon to establish a constraint (3).

6. Add an aligned dimension from the Right reference plane to the center reference of the 
chair. Set the value to 1′-8″ (500 mm), and click the padlock to establish the dimension as 
a constraint.
7. Select the chair, and then from the Modify tab in the ribbon, click the Array tool, with the 
Linear option selected. In the Options bar, choose the Group And Associate option and 
the Move To: End radio button.
8. Click once near the chair and then click a second time 2′-8″ (800 mm) to the left. Press the 
Enter key to accept the number of entities in the array.
9. Use the Align tool to constrain the arrayed chair to the Back reference plane, add an 
aligned dimension, and then lock the dimension—similar to the previous steps. The plan 
view should look like the image in Figure 15.49.
Figure 15.49 
Two nested chairs are 
established as a para-
metric array.

TROUBLESHOOTING TECHNIQUES | 677
10. Select one of the arrayed chairs, and you will again see a line connecting the arrayed 
objects displaying the number 2. In the Label Dimensions panel, click the Create 
Parameter button. Create a new parameter named Chair Array. Click OK to close any 
open dialog boxes.
11. Open the Family Types dialog box. In the formula ﬁeld for the Chair Array parameter, 
type (Length - 2′) / 2′ (for metric, type (Length - 600) / 600).
This will automatically increase or decrease the number of elements in the array based on 
the length of the table.
12. Repeat steps 1–10 to place another parametric array along the Front reference plane. 
When you get to step 3, instead of choosing <Add Parameter…> from the Label drop-
down list, you will simply choose the Chair Type parameter, and in step 10 you will 
choose the Chair Array parameter.
Before you continue with the exercise, take a moment to open the Family Types dialog 
box and switch between Type 1 and Type 2. Verify that the chairs maintain alignment with 
the edges of the tabletop. When you select Type 2, there should be six chairs instead of four. 
Compare your results to the image shown in Figure 15.50.
Figure 15.50 
Te complete table 
family with nested 
chairs
With Type 2 still active in the Family Type dialog box, set the Chair Type parameter to  
Chair-Dining-2 and then click the Apply button. You should see all the nested chairs change to 
the alternate chair family. Save the family and reload it into the c15-Desk-Project.rvt ﬁle, and 
choose the option to reload the family and overwrite any parameter values. If the Tables sub-
category is still turned off in the view, you may notice that the chairs appear but not the tables. 
There is likely no realistic need to create another subcategory for chairs, so open the Visibility/
Graphic Overrides dialog box and turn on the Tables subcategory.
You can experiment with adjusting the values of the table family, including creating new 
types with variations in materials (Figure 15.51).

Te Bottom Line
Get started with a family.  Before you start to create your own family components, take a 
moment to think about how you expect that component to “behave” in your project. The role 
of the Family Editor is not just an environment to model geometry; it also determines how 
the content that you create will behave in the project environment.
Master It  Choosing the right template is critical. You can convert from one family tem-
plate to another, but this is not always the case. Why would you want to choose a door 
template rather than a Generic Model template?
Create the framework for a family component.  Reference planes, points, and lines are the 
“bones” of your component. Assign parameters to the skeleton, and the geometry will follow 
along. Be sure to test the parameter and reference relationships before you start to create any 
solid model geometry.
Master It  Why should you build, assign parameters to, and test the references ﬁrst? 
Why not just model the geometry?
Understand family modeling techniques.  Although the Family Editor contains a wide 
assortment of modeling and editing tools, you do not always need to build everything in one 
ﬁle. You can use a number of techniques to reduce redundancy and manage complex geom-
etry for a component family.
Master It  When would you consider using the technique of nesting families? How 
could this method improve the efﬁciency of a component family?
Apply extended family management techniques.  Sometimes parametric behavior 
will depend on the parameters that directly control it, but often these parameters will be 
expressed as a relationship to something else.
Master It  Why are formulas so important? Why not just create the parameters you need 
and then modify them as needed in the project environment?

 Creating Stairs and Railings   
 Creating stairs and railings in Autodesk ® Revit ® 2018 software can be challenging. In addition, 
stairs and railings are often sculptural as well as functional, and there is a limit to the amount of 
customization you can design with the provided tools and commands. 
 An entire book could be written about mastering stairs and railings in Revit, considering the 
breadth of functionality in these tools and the unlimited number of design conﬁ gurations they can 
be used to create. Instead of walking through a few examples of creating stairs and railings, this 
chapter will give you foundational knowledge about the rules, parts, and key functionality of these 
tools so that you can use them in the most effective way possible for your own designs. We will also 
give you some ideas to tackle tougher design challenges by thinking beyond the default tools. 
 In this chapter, you will learn to 
 
◆
 Understand the key components of stairs and railings 
 
◆
 Understand the different stair tools and apply them to custom designs 
 
◆
 Design railings and use the Railing tool for other model elements 
 
◆
Implement best practices 
 Designing Stairs and Railings 
 Designing and iterating complex stairs and railings in any software application can be difﬁ cult. 
You will need to thoroughly understand the rules and constraints of the application—in effect, 
learn the  language of the application. To communicate ﬂ uently in that language, you need to 
be able to think ﬂ uently. You almost have to be able to think beyond the individual words and 
begin to arrange whole ideas. 
 Regardless of how well you know how to use a particular application, you have to incorporate 
imagination and complex design issues. Sometimes stairs and railings are straightforward and 
functional (for example, a steel or concrete egress stair), and there is not much room for creative 
thinking. But in many cases, stairs and railings are conceived as feature elements within a space. 
They will be touched and experienced up close. They may be extraordinarily complex and spa-
tial—almost an inhabited sculpture (Figure  16.1 ). 
 Revit is purpose-built for designing building elements and relating them to the rules of 
 commonly constructed relationships (doors associate with walls, furniture associates with ﬂ oors, 
and so on). The software is biased toward relationships speciﬁ c to designing a building and 
maintaining those relationships as the design changes. To make things a bit more complicated, 
there is a speciﬁ c language for creating stairs and railings in Revit Architecture. For example, 
Figure  16.2 illustrates the Edit Baluster Placement dialog box for a baluster condition.

Before we begin detailed exercises for creating stairs and railings, let’s review the main  
components of each object type and how they are organized within Revit.

REVIEWING THE KEY COMPONENTS OF STAIRS AND RAILINGS | 681
Reviewing the Key Components of Stairs and Railings
Stairs and railings are system families, so they exist only within the project environment. 
However, they are supported by regular families that provide needed components to the 
stairs such as balusters for railings and proﬁles for stair nosings. As you should already know, 
these types of families can be shared between projects only by copying and pasting, using the 
Transfer Project Standards tool, or including them in your project templates. There are several 
component family templates that serve as subsets of stair and railing system families, such as 
proﬁles, posts, and panels.
Reviewing the Basic Rules of Stairs
Before you start to create any stairs in a project, you should become familiar with the basic rules 
related to these special elements in Revit. We will discuss the actual geometric components later, 
but ﬁrst let’s review the parameters that drive the geometry. When you launch the Stair tool, it 
is assumed that you want a stair to be generated between two levels. If you start the tool from a 
ﬂoor plan view, the base level will be the level associated with the ﬂoor plan view, and the top 
will be the next level above. Keep in mind that this may be a level that is not the next major level 
above; it could be a minor level such as a mezzanine. Always check the instance parameters in 
the Properties palette when you are creating a new stair (Figure 16.3). You can also assign top- 
and base-level offsets in the instance parameters the same way you can for walls.
Figure 16.3 
Instance parameters 
for a stair
Using the overall height determined by the base and top levels, the stair object will be 
equally divided into risers. The maximum riser height is deﬁned in the type properties of every 
stair type. The overall height of the desired stair will be equally divided into risers not exceed-
ing the deﬁned maximum riser height. Tread depth is speciﬁed in the stair’s type properties as 
well, but that may be overridden if you manually lay out the treads in Sketch mode. The tread 
depth may also accept a Global Parameter.
In addition to the simple rule of overall riser height, some public agencies require a stair 
calculation to be employed for dimensional compliance. This type of calculation can be enabled 
Certiﬁcation
Objective

682 | CHAPTER 16 CREATING STAIRS AND RAILINGS 
from the stair’s type properties as well. With either of the stair commands activated, click the 
Edit Type button and then the Edit button in the Calculation Rules parameter. This will give you 
the Stair Calculator dialog box (Figure 16.4), which will allow you to enter the code-based values 
driving the creation of new stairs.
Figure 16.4 
Te Stair Calculator 
dialog box
Stairs you create will be associated with a base level and top level. You can also assign  
offset distances to the base and top levels, which allow the stairs to start or end later or sooner 
depending on the design. If the datum objects are adjusted or the offsets are redeﬁned, the 
stairs will automatically adjust within the calculated rules, as the stairs remain associated 
with these datum objects. This means that if the height reduces, the riser count will remain, 
but each riser will be shorter. In other words, the footprint or plan of the stair will remain 
unchanged. If the height of a stair run increases and an automatic adjustment would violate 
the maximum riser height, you will receive a warning that the actual number of risers is dif-
ferent from the desired number of risers. In other words, the footprint of the stair will not 
change automatically. It is up to you to edit the stair to add more risers where you feel they  
are appropriate.
Before we discuss the basic component of stairs and railings, download and open the ﬁle 
c16-00-Stair-Rail.rvt or c16-00-Stair-Rail-Metric.rvt from this book’s web page at 
www.sybex.com/go/masteringrevit2018.

REVIEWING THE KEY COMPONENTS OF STAIRS AND RAILINGS | 683
Working with Stair Components
With previous versions of Revit, stairs were created using either the Stair By Sketch or Stair By 
Component tool. In Revit 2018, there is one Stair option based on the Stair By Component feature 
of previous versions. The main part of the stairs—the risers and treads—is called the run in 
Revit. The structural elements that hold the run in place are represented by landings and supports 
in the Stair tool. In the tool, each of these basic elements (run, landing, support) is deﬁned with 
its own unique type properties.
Run  The critical parts of a run are the construction, material deﬁnitions, and tread 
and riser settings. There are two system families for runs in the default project template: 
Monolithic Run and Non-Monolithic Run. A monolithic run is essentially a single material 
for the stair, stringer, tread, and riser. Typically, monolithic runs are used for cast-in-place 
and precast concrete stairs, whereas nonmonolithic runs are for stairs made of wood, metal, 
and various other materials.
Support  The supports for an assembled stair usually take one of two forms. In Revit, these 
are referred to as carriage (open) or stringer (closed), as shown in Figure 16.5. Carriage and 
Stringer are system families you can ﬁnd in the Project Browser under Families ➢ Stairs. 
After you select either the Carriage or Stringer option in the stair type properties, you can 
select one of the respective support types. For example, the Right Support property may be 
Carriage (open), and the Right Support Type value would be Carriage – 2″ Width.
Figure 16.5 
Stair support options
Stringer (Closed)
Carriage (Open)
Lateral Offset
Landing  Landings are the transitional elements between runs. As such, one of the main 
settings in the type properties for a landing is Same As Run. With this setting enabled, you 
are left with only the identity data and the material property for monolithic landings. If the 
Same As Run setting is disabled, you can treat the landing as another tread with the same 
opportunities to apply a thickness and a nosing proﬁle.
Reviewing the Components of Railings
The major parts of a railing are the proﬁles, different kinds of balusters, and the nested types 
within each railing family. Additional functionality is available to help integrate different rail-
ing parts into a more cohesive system. In Figure 16.6, a common railing is shown to illustrate  
the fundamental parts of a railing type.

Let’s examine some of these railing components in greater depth.
Proﬁles  The proﬁle is the most basic component used to model a railing. All the rails, posts, 
and balusters are generated from proﬁle families. You can have as many proﬁles per railing 
as you like, but you cannot have more than one shape in a proﬁle family (RFA) ﬁle. In each 
proﬁle family, the shape needs to be a closed loop—no gaps or overlapping lines allowed. 
Furthermore, all the railing proﬁles will be swept parallel to their host objects. In Figure 16.7, 
the top rail and all the intermediate rails are simple circular proﬁles swept along the path of 
the railing.
Figure 16.7 
Multiple proﬁles  
per railing

REVIEWING THE KEY COMPONENTS OF STAIRS AND RAILINGS | 685
Balusters  There are three kinds of baluster family templates you can use to customize a 
railing type:
 
◆
Baluster posts have built-in instance parameters to control the height of the baluster so that 
it can adjust automatically when used within a railing type in a project. The posts are used 
at the start, end, and transitions of railings.
 
◆
Balusters are the main, repeated vertical structure of most railing designs. They have 
instance parameters as well that control the vertical length and the angle of the top and 
bottom of the baluster (Figure 16.8). When you create your own custom baluster families, 
you must constrain the geometry to these reference planes so the baluster will adapt to the 
settings in the railing type.
 
◆
Baluster panels have controls much like the baluster, but there are additional reference 
planes to control the overall width of a desired panel (Figure 16.9).
Figure 16.8 
A baluster template
Top Rail  The top rail is a separate component of a railing type. That is to say, it will not 
appear in the Edit Rails dialog box. Instead, you will ﬁnd the Top Rail settings in the type 
properties of the railing, and they consist only of a height and a type. The top rail is a 
nested system family that you can ﬁnd in the Project Browser under Families ➢ Railings 
➢ Top Rail Type. Locate and double-click Circular – 1 1/2″ (Circular – 40 mm). You will 
ﬁnd more detailed settings to control this subset of railing functionality (Figure 16.10). 
Let’s take a look at some of the properties of a top rail: Construction, Terminations, and 
Extensions.
Construction  The ﬁrst category of properties in a top rail deﬁnes the basic construction 
of the rail. Here you will select a proﬁle and specify other behavior such as default join 
condition, transitions, and hand clearance.

REVIEWING THE KEY COMPONENTS OF STAIRS AND RAILINGS | 687
Terminations  Another top rail option is deﬁning a termination. This is a family compo-
nent that can be used at the end of a rail or rail extension. There is only one termination 
family loaded in the default project template, but you can create your own family using 
the Railing Termination.rft or Metric Railing Termination.rft family template. 
Figure 16.11 shows an example of a termination.
Figure 16.11 
Rail termination
Extensions  When you need a rail to extend beyond its main sketch deﬁnition of the rail-
ing, an extension can be speciﬁed as part of the rail type. The extension is an integrated part 
of the rail, so it is controlled by the same properties such as size or materiality. In the settings 
for Extension (Beginning/Bottom), you can select an option called Plus Tread Depth. This 
is to accommodate common building codes that require a stair handrail to be extended the 
length of one tread plus some standard distance. Extension Style is a setting that gives you 
three predeﬁned designs for the rail extension: Wall, Floor, or Post (Figure 16.12).
Figure 16.12 
Options for rail exten-
sion styles
Wall
Floor
Post
You can customize a rail’s extension by pressing the Tab key to select the rail. Then click Edit 
Rail in the contextual tab in the ribbon, and click Edit Path.
Handrail  The handrail is another system family that is nested within a railing family, 
and its properties are almost identical to those of the top rail family. The one exception is 
that handrails can use support families. From the Project Browser, navigate to Families ➢ 
Railings ➢ Handrail Type and then double-click Circular – 1 ½″ (or Pipe – Wall Mount in the 
metric equivalent) to open the Type Properties dialog box for a handrail (Figure 16.13).

688 | CHAPTER 16 CREATING STAIRS AND RAILINGS 
Figure 16.13 
Type properties for 
handrail supports
Beyond selecting a support family, you will notice settings for Layout that include Align 
With Posts, Fixed Number, Fixed Distance, Maximum Spacing, and Minimum Spacing. These 
are the main controls that will enable or disable the other settings for Supports, including 
Spacing, Justiﬁcation, and Number.
Rail Structure (Non-Continuous)  Let’s return to the type properties of the main railing 
family. In the Project Browser, navigate to Families ➢ Railings ➢ Railing and double-click 
Guardrail – Pipe (900 mm Pipe in the metric exercise ﬁle). In the Rail Structure (Non-
Continuous) parameter, click the Edit button to open the Edit Rails (Non-Continuous) dialog 
box (Figure 16.14). In this interface, you can insert rails deﬁned by proﬁle families as well as 
set their relative height, horizontal offset distance, and material. These rails are considered 
noncontinuous because they will be intersected by any balusters you deﬁne in the Baluster 
Placement settings. Click OK to exit this dialog box.
Baluster Placement  When you return to the type properties of the railing, locate the 
Baluster Placement parameter and click the Edit button to open the Edit Baluster Placement 
dialog box (Figure 16.15). As you can see, there are options for the main pattern and the posts 
and an option for how the balusters will be used on stairs.
The Main Pattern section of the dialog box is where you would assemble all your baluster 
types and then space and host them accordingly. You can also decide how you want the pat-
tern to repeat (or not repeat) itself at the ends of sketched line segments. The Posts section is 
used to specify which baluster is used at start, corner, and end conditions (and the frequency 
of corner posts). Click OK to close both open dialog boxes.
That is a high-level overview of the properties of railings and what they are used for. We 
have covered the primary features necessary to create great railings.

Using the Tab Key with Stairs and Railings
Railings consist of nested families for top rails and handrails. Stairs are divided into runs, land-
ings, and supports. When you ﬁrst select a railing or stair, you will be selecting the parent type. 
You could then click Edit Type in the Properties palette to change the child types; however, there 
are some unique instance properties and editing capabilities exposed when you use the Tab key to 
directly select one of the nested elements.
For stairs, one of the important features of a run is whether it begins or ends with a riser. Tis 
property is critical in determining how a stair interacts with an adjacent ﬂoor slab. Depending on 
the type of stair you create, these properties are part of either the stair type or the run type. In the 
newer style of stair, the only way you can access these properties is by hovering your mouse pointer 
over a stair and then pressing the Tab key once to select the run. Te instance properties of the run 
will then be shown in the Properties palette. You can also access the run width in the same manner.
For railings, you can use the Tab key to access editing functions of top rails and handrails. If you 
hover the mouse pointer over a top rail and then press the Tab key once to select the rail, you will 
ﬁnd an Edit Rail button in the contextual ribbon. Activating this tool allows you to customize the 
path of the continuous rails to build or customize extensions.
Creating Stairs 
Various common conﬁgurations of stairs can be created using the tools provided in Revit. 
Examples include three-run stairs (when the stair run turns back onto itself, creating an overlap-
ping condition) and stringers with custom proﬁles. Despite the versatility of the stair tools, there 
is still no way to anticipate every unique and sculptural design condition. In these cases, we will 
show you techniques that are not exactly using the stair tools as intended, but the results will 
geometrically resemble stairs (and their railings).

CREATING STAIRS  | 691
Understanding the Stair Tools
There is now just one tool for creating stairs in a project environment instead of two, previously 
known as Stair By Component and Stair By Sketch.
Using the Stair tool, you have the ability to customize runs and landings within the overall stair 
element. You also have the unique ability to edit the stair in a 3D view. That is to say, the stair remains 
visible as a complete model as you edit it (Figure 16.16).
Figure 16.16 
Editing a stair in a 
3D view
There are additional subcategories of the Stairs object style that allow you to further customize 
the appearance of stairs and their related elements (Figure 16.17). One of the subcategories is 
Riser Lines—providing an additional dashed line parallel to the edge of the riser that indicates 
the nosing length. You can customize the appearance of these elements in Object Styles from the 
Manage tab in the ribbon. You can also adjust the visibility of the stair elements for any view in 
the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box and optionally save the settings to view templates.
The fundamental concept behind the Stair tool is that the major components of a stair (run, 
landing, support) are nested system families that can be independently customized. Although 
both stair tools are being maintained in the software, understanding the difference between all 
the families and types can be challenging.
Looking at the Stair tool, there are several system families that function as the parent families. 
The following families are the top-level families into which other families are nested:
 
◆
Assembled Stair
 
◆
Cast-In-Place Stair
 
◆
Stair
 
◆
Precast Stair

692 | CHAPTER 16 CREATING STAIRS AND RAILINGS 
Figure 16.17 
Additional subcat-
egories are available 
for stairs.
Under each of these families is where you deﬁne a type to be used in your projects. For example, 
under the Cast-In-Place Stair family, you will ﬁnd the Monolithic Stair type, which uses nested 
families for the run, landing, and support. To better understand this nesting, let’s look at the 
family hierarchy of the Monolithic Stair type in a simple list.
 
◆
Family: Cast-In-Place Stair
 
◆
Type: Monolithic Stair
 
◆
Run Type: ¾″ Nosing (20 mm)
 
◆

In the Project Browser, you will ﬁnd listings for the following nested families under the 
Stairs category:

CREATING STAIRS  | 693
Let’s explore the ability to directly manipulate component stairs. To begin, create a stair with 
a landing:
1. From the Architecture tab, on the Circulation panel, choose Stair. This will bring you into 
Sketch mode. Draw the stair from left to right. Base the base of the stair on the left of the 
screen, and drag your mouse to the right until you place nine risers. Click to locate the 
ninth riser.
2. Now, move your mouse about 4′ (1.2 m) to the right and click again. This will create a 
landing and the base for the tenth step.
3. Drag your mouse to the right, placing the other nine risers. Your stair in sketch mode 
should look like Figure 16.18.
Figure 16.18 
Creating the com-
ponent stair with 
landing
Selecting the runs or the landing will display grips and temporary dimensions that can 
be used to change the width, direction, and location of the runs or landing.
4. Widen the left run and landing by selecting the portion of the stair and pulling the blue 
arrow grips down, as shown in Figure 16.19.
Figure 16.19 
Widening the 
left run
5. Now select the landing and move the lower grip to further widen the landing, as shown 
in Figure 16.20. The landing maintains the connection to the lower run.

694 | CHAPTER 16 CREATING STAIRS AND RAILINGS 
Figure 16.20 
Extending the landing
6. Changing the shape of the landing is not possible without converting the landing to a 
sketch-based component. Select the landing and then select Convert from the Tools panel. 
This will convert the component element to a sketch-based element. Keep in mind that 
this is irreversible (Figure 16.21).
Figure 16.21 
Converting the land-
ing to a sketch-based 
component
7. With the landing now sketch based, you can edit its shape and create a form that is not 
rectilinear. Select Edit Sketch from the Tools panel. Delete the lower sketch line and then 
replace it with an arch-shaped boundary, as shown in Figure 16.22. Finish the sketch for 
the landing and then click Finish Edit Mode for the component stair.
Figure 16.23 shows the resulting stair. Do not be afraid to experiment with using both component 
and sketch-based stair tools in a single stair condition. Just remember that it is often easier to start 
with the component stair and then modify with sketches when necessary. This is a powerful, ﬂexible 
combination and gives you important feedback in 3D rather than requiring you to go back and forth 
between sketches and the ﬁnished stair. This ﬁle can be downloaded from the Chapter 16 folder on 
the book’s web page. Look for the c16-Stair-Landing.rvt or c16-Stair-Landing-Metric.rvt ﬁle.

696 | CHAPTER 16 CREATING STAIRS AND RAILINGS 
Using the Instance Properties of Stair Components
We have discussed the hierarchy of nested families and types for components in other chapters; 
stairs follow this same structure. You can Tab+select through the stair to choose either the stair 
or the rail, but you have other options as well. By hovering over the side of the stair, you can 
choose just the treads or just the stringer. Both of these selection options come with their own 
properties, but there are even more parameters available as instance properties of runs, land-
ings, and supports. When the Stair tool is activated, you can set the width of a run only after it 
has been created. If you Tab+select the run within a stair assembly, you can access the Actual 
Run Width property and change it.
The Begin With Riser and End With Riser properties are critical to integrating a stair with 
adjacent ﬂoor slabs. With the Convert to Sketch-Based stair, these parameters are available only 
in the Type Properties dialog box, which means that you would need to create a new stair type 
if either of these conditions needed to be customized. For the standard component stairs, these 
properties can be found in the instance properties of each run. You will need to Tab+select a run 
within a stair instance to enable or disable these parameters, but it is ultimately more ﬂexible to 
do this throughout your project.
Another important group of instance properties is assigned to the stair supports. If you 
Tab+select a support for any component stair, you will see parameters, including Lower End Cut 
and Upper End Cut in the Properties palette. These can be assigned to Vertical Cut, Horizontal 
Cut, or Perpendicular.
Using Component Stairs in Assemblies
Stairs cannot be added to assemblies. See Chapter 20, “Working in the Construction Phase,” for 
more information about assemblies.
Using the Components for Customizing Stairs
One of the main tenets of BIM is the ability to manage elements within a predictable category. 
However, it is not always practical for elements to maintain a strict taxonomy. In making the 
best use of Revit, do not always get hung up on how elements and tools are named or labeled. 
For example, you can use the Railing tool to create a shading device—which is obviously not 
a railing. This may make it more challenging to schedule, label, and manage the properties of 
the objects. It, however, may give you more ﬂexibility to deploy the tools for your project. This 
same concept applies to stairs—do not overlook the nosing proﬁle family as a device for creating 
interesting shapes that complete the tread because the shape of the nosing is not limited to 
traditional-nosing proﬁles. Any shape that needs to extend beyond the face of the tread is fair 
game to model with the Nosing Proﬁle family. Just remember that you are limited to a single 
proﬁle per tread and stair run (Figure 16.24). You will also want to pay particular attention to the 
insertion point of the nosing proﬁle, because the intersection of the reference planes  coincides 
with the top of the tread and the face of the riser.
Figure 16.25 shows an example from a real stair that was designed to have each tread fab-
ricated from a single plate of steel and then rolled to form the face of the riser above it. Here, 
each of these treads can be welded behind the lip of the tread above it. It is a fairly elegant 
idea that can be accomplished by using a custom-nosing proﬁle to create the appearance of 

CREATING STAIRS  | 697
a continuous tread. Look closely and you can see where the actual tread ends and where the 
 nosing proﬁle begins. Final linework can be adjusted or hidden (if necessary) when you are 
 creating the details.

Figure 16.26 shows this stair in its ﬁnal form using our custom proﬁle, but the walls are hidden

Understanding the Stringer
Stringers in Revit are good for creating a number of standard wooden or steel conditions, and 
the right and left stringers may be customized with proﬁles. If you need a custom middle proﬁle 
or a stringer that follows the railing but deviates from the standard left/right stringer location, 
use the Railing tool (Figure 16.27). The stair will host this railing containing the custom stringer 
proﬁle (or just the custom proﬁle, with no handrail).
Figure 16.27 
Use the Railing tool 
to create a custom 
stringer proﬁle.

CREATING STAIRS  | 699
Notice in Figure 16.27 that the last proﬁle is not part of the traditional portion of the railing. 
Instead, this proﬁle is used to indicate a custom stringer proﬁle (Figure 16.28). But it has been 
assigned to the railing to maintain a particular relationship to the stairs.
Figure 16.28 
Railing proﬁle
In Figure 16.29, we have isolated the railing from the stairs to illustrate the ﬁnished railing: 
the handrail, two glazed and continuous panels, and the custom stringer.
Figure 16.29 
Completed railing 
proﬁle
This railing with a custom stringer proﬁle is perfect for a multitude of stair conditions: 
straight, curved, or even a combination (Figure 16.30). This technique ﬁnishes off the stair nicely 
and exposes the structure in interesting ways.

700 | CHAPTER 16 CREATING STAIRS AND RAILINGS 
Figure 16.30 
Finished stairs
Although the stringer usually occurs to the left or right of the treads, this is certainly not always 
the case. In some situations you will want to create a middle stringer using a custom proﬁle. Just 
remember that this will be a railing that will be hosted by the stair and may not even contain 
a handrail, just the proﬁle for the stringer (Figure 16.31). In this case, the railing is still being 
hosted by the stairs; however, there is not any railing geometry above the tread.
Figure 16.31 
Custom middle 
stringer proﬁle

CREATING STAIRS  | 701
For component stairs, you can also use a custom proﬁle for a stringer, but instead of using 
a railing family as we previously described, you can assign it to a support type. To accomplish 
this, you must ﬁrst create a duplicate support type.
1. Download and open the exercise ﬁle c16-Custom-Stringer.rvt. In the Project Browser, 
navigate to Families ➢ Stairs ➢ Stringer, right-click Stringer – Default, and then select 
Duplicate from the context menu.
2. Double-click the duplicated type to open the Type Properties dialog box. Click the 
Rename button and set the new name to Stringer – Channel. Click OK.
3. In the Section Proﬁle parameter, select C-Channel-Proﬁle : C9X15 (M_C-Channel-Proﬁle : 
C250X30 in the Metric ﬁle).
4. Check the box for the Flip Section Proﬁle parameter.
5. Finally, change the Structural Depth on Landing to 5″ (125 mm) to set the channel location 
under the stair. Click OK to close the Type Properties dialog box.
6. Activate the default 3D view and select the stair in the view after tabbing until it highlights 
Stairs: Assembled Stair: Stair. In the Properties palette, click Edit Type.
7. Find the Right Support Type parameter and click in the parameter value ﬁeld. Click again 
on the small icon in the parameter ﬁeld to open the Type Properties dialog box for the 
stringer.
8. In the Type drop-down list, select Stringer - Channel and then click OK.
9. Repeat steps 7 and 8 for the Left Support Type.
10. Click OK to close the dialog box and then observe the change in the stringer support for 
the stair (Figure 16.32).
Figure 16.32 
A custom proﬁle can be 
used as a support type.
This workﬂow applies to customizing carriage supports as well. Just repeat the previous steps used 
in creating custom stringers, but look for those support types under Families ➢ Stairs ➢ Carriage.

702 | CHAPTER 16 CREATING STAIRS AND RAILINGS 
As a ﬁnal note about custom support proﬁles, you must ensure that the proper usage prop-
erty is speciﬁed in the proﬁle family when you are creating the shape. In the Family Editor, 
click the Family Category And Parameters button in the ribbon and make sure the Proﬁle Usage 
parameter is set to Stair Support (Figure 16.33).

Using Balusters as Tread Supports
Common tread shapes are not the only type that the stair tool can use, so let’s move directly 
to custom treads where you need to be a bit more inventive. This technique can either create a 
custom support element for the default treads or indicate the actual tread. But instead of the bal-
uster being vertical, it is going to be horizontal. This horizontal baluster will be used in conjunc-
tion with the default tread. This baluster may even completely envelop the tread (Figure 16.34).
Figure 16.34 
Baluster as tread 
support

CREATING STAIRS  | 703
First, we need to discuss a few rules for creating a customized tread support for the default 
tread.
 
◆
Not every baluster needs a railing. If your baluster support is not going to be part of the 
“actual” railing, simply create a second “railing” that is hosted by the stairs. Sketching 
another path for your custom railing that only contains the tread support baluster can 
be accomplished in a few steps. The baluster family template needs to be used for the 
component that will act as the tread support. Otherwise, it cannot be associated to the 
railing.
 
◆
If you have a complex support element, it may be helpful to model the desired support 
element as a generic family. When you have ﬁnished, nest this generic element into the 
baluster family. You may want to do this because the baluster templates have hardwired 
reference planes and parameters (which is ﬁne if you are making a baluster that needs 
to geometrically ﬂex). But in some cases, we have found that these reference planes and 
parameters may cause your baluster to fail when you load it in the project as a result of 
these parameters ﬂexing. By modeling the geometry elsewhere and nesting it, you avoid 
this hassle because it moves as a single component.
 
◆
Designating the level of detail is critical. Assigning smaller model elements to appear 
only when the Detail Level option of a view is set to Fine will result in much faster graph-
ics regeneration, view panning, and model rotation. So if you are nesting one component 
into another family, the detail that you are assigning at the deepest level will be respected 
through nesting (Figure 16.35).
Figure 16.35 
Single component that 
will be used as a tread 
support
Once the component is complete, you can nest it into a baluster template, as shown in  
Figure 16.36. If necessary, it is also possible to assign parameters to the dimensions in the 
nested conﬁguration.
The completed stairs are shown in two different conﬁgurations in Figure 16.37. Many con-
ﬁgurations are possible once you correctly deﬁne a single stair type. If you would like to investi-
gate this stair further, it is in the Chapter 16 folder on the book’s web page, and the ﬁle is called 
c16-Angled-Support-Stair.rvt.

Completed stairs 
with angled tread 
supports
A custom baluster support might be modeled to contain the real balusters that are intended 
to support railings. This can simplify and shorten modeling time. In the example shown in 
Figure 16.38, the baluster support geometry also contains the railing elements on both the right 
and left sides. If you would like to investigate this stair further, it is in the Chapter 16 folder on 
the book’s web page; the ﬁle is called c16-Support Tread.rfa.

CREATING STAIRS  | 705
Figure 16.38 
Complex tread support 
with balusters
The previous support baluster can be brought together with a custom proﬁle for the center 
stringer, handrails, and glazed panels to form a complete stair and railing design (Figure 16.39). 
You can download this example from the Chapter 16 folder on the book’s web page; the ﬁle is 
called c16-Center Baluster Support.rvt.
Figure 16.39

port as a baluster
Controlling the Baluster Supports
Do not forget to control the number of baluster supports per tread. Revit has an easy way to accom-
plish this through the railing option Use Baluster Per Tread On Stairs, found in the Edit Baluster 
Placement dialog box.

706 | CHAPTER 16 CREATING STAIRS AND RAILINGS 
Once you have begun to experiment with creating balusters as tread supports for stairs, you 
will notice you have options for making more complete and ﬁnished conditions.
Start and end posts are useful and can help complete the structure of your custom railing 
and baluster system, particularly if you want to properly anchor and connect your custom stair 
and railing. The elements shown in Figure 16.40 are the start and end posts to anchor a custom 
railing and a baluster that will serve as the tread with integrated support. It builds on the previ-
ous example of using a baluster as a support element for a tread.
Figure 16.40 
Custom post 
and baluster 
families
To ﬁnish this stair, you need to create start and end posts that anchor the stair. As with the 
previous handrail-join exercise, you will want to model the bulk of the custom stair with the 
custom railing. Then you will export the stair parts for importing into the baluster template  
(or the generic model template that will be nested into the baluster template).
Figure 16.41 shows the results after the start and end posts and custom baluster families are 
applied to a completed stair design.
When it all comes together, the results can be elegant and interesting. All of this is available 
through the default Stairs tool. You can download this stair from the Chapter 16 folder on the 
book’s web page; it is called c16-Tube Stair.rvt.
Now let’s go one step further. There is no reason that the baluster support element needs to 
exactly conform to the shape of the tread. And there is no reason that the support element can-
not contain the actual baluster that is intended to support the handrail.
Take a look at the support element in Figure 16.42. Not only does it contain the support 
 element, but the support element has been modeled to exceed the shape of the tread that will be 
modeled by the Stairs tool.

CREATING STAIRS  | 707
Figure 16.41

posts
Figure 16.42 
Support and baluster 
as a generic model
Keep in mind that we have modeled the support element as a generic model and then nested 
it into a baluster post template (Figure 16.43). Again, this keeps the baluster uniﬁed so it is not 
affected by the built-in reference planes and parameters.

708 | CHAPTER 16 CREATING STAIRS AND RAILINGS 
Figure 16.43 
Baluster and support 
nested into a baluster 
post template
Once this custom baluster post is loaded into the project, associate it with the stair and its  
railings. Remember to select the Use Baluster Per Tread on Stairs option and select one baluster 
per tread. When ﬁnished, the default tread is an inlay to the more complete tread support  
(Figure 16.44). In more complex conditions, it may be desirable to envelop the entire tread with the 
support geometry. Doing so will allow you to create complex tread shapes that are not dependent 
on the default tread and use the functionality of the stair and railing objects to properly locate, 
rotate, and elevate each of your custom treads. If you want to examine this stair further, check out 
the ﬁle c16-Curved Tread Support.rvt in the Chapter 16 folder on the book’s web page.
Figure 16.44 
Finished stair with 
integrated baluster and 
support
Figure 16.45 shows an example using this technique. The tread support elements have been 
modeled using blends in order to sweep under the metal plate while changing direction from 
vertical to angle. This will accommodate the angled pipe rail that will support the stair.

CREATING STAIRS  | 709
Figure 16.45 
Te top and underside 
of a tread support
Treads come together in a particularly interesting stair and railing conﬁguration. There is 
obviously a more conventional outer railing for this stair. But the inner railing does not have 
any elements that occur at hand height. The entire inner railing exists to support the baluster sup-
ports (which in turn support the default treads). The end post is being used to anchor the entire 
structure through the second level. You can ﬁnd this example, c16-Highlights.rvt, in the 
Chapter 16 folder of the book’s web page. Figure 16.46 shows the ﬁnished stair. The large structural 
element is actually a baluster that has been designated as the end post.
Figure 16.46 
Completed stair with 
large end post

710 | CHAPTER 16 CREATING STAIRS AND RAILINGS 
Creating Stairs with Other Tools
We have discussed a number of different ways the parts of stairs can be manipulated and 
created. As we approach alternate modeling techniques with the goal of creating elegant stairs, 
understand that the metadata may not correspond to the geometry. This is usually the only 
option to complete a design where there are limitations to the default tools while avoiding the 
need to resort to strictly 2D representation. Because the metadata—the information part of 
BIM—is not being coordinated properly, you will want to take particular care with regard to 
tagging and scheduling.
A solid spiral wall can be used as a railing, or a support element can easily be created in the 
Family Editor and then associated with the stair as a start post. Of course, this geometry could 
also be created as an in-place family, but then you would lose the advantage of being able to 
quickly and easily relocate the stair in your project (or create a multistory condition).
In Figure 16.47, you can see part of a spiral stair with default treads and supports modeled  
as balusters with the Railing tool.
Figure 16.47 
Baluster used as a 
support element
Rather than create the spiral wall (Figure 16.48) as an in-place family under the stair, we 
modeled the form as a baluster post in order to associate it with the beginning of the railing 
being used for the support brackets.
To make sure the path is correct, we copied the run line of the stair into the post family 
named Spiral Start Post (Figure 16.49). Now you can use this path as you create each of the 
blended sweeps (creating only one swept blend per path). In this case the blends are being 
 modeled so that there is a 3″ (75 mm) gap between the undersides of the default treads.

CREATING STAIRS  | 711

A series of swept 
blends modeled in a 
post family
Figure 16.49 
Copy the stair run path 
into the post family.
Figure 16.50 shows what you get when it all comes together. The swept blend has been 
 created in a post template. This post is then loaded into the project environment and associated 
with the railing type named Support Baluster that contains the baluster deﬁnition with the 
 support brackets named Custom Baluster. This is also a useful technique if you have to create 
walls that need to follow either side of a stair. If the condition exists only once, you may opt to 
create this as an in-place component.

712 | CHAPTER 16 CREATING STAIRS AND RAILINGS 
Figure 16.50 
Finished stair 
condition
If this occurs more than once or might be rotated and relocated (as well as occur on many 
levels), we recommend that you create this as part of the stair and railing deﬁnition. Then it will 
be easier to maintain relationships throughout the project. To investigate this stair, download 
the c16-Concentric Stair.rvt ﬁle from the Chapter 16 folder on the book’s web page.
Creating Multistory Stairs
Many stairs that architects make traverse multiple stories. The difﬁculty in a repeating pattern 
is that some ﬂoors may not have the exact ﬂoor-to-ﬂoor heights. With the Multistory Stairs tool, 
stairs can be associated with selected levels, regardless of consistent vertical dimensions. As 
a multistory stair is created, sections are categorized into different groups based on the level 

CREATING STAIRS  | 713
heights. Stairs grouped with the same level height can now be edited together, even allowing 
changes in stair type. For stair runs that need alternative conﬁgurations, they can be ungrouped 
with the Unpin tool. However, if that stair is added back to the group, all of its changes will be 
overridden by the features of the group it is joining.
To transform a stair to Multistory Stair, switch to an elevation view that shows the stair 
and levels together. Select the stair to access the Select Levels tool in the Modify Stairs palette. 
This will trigger a sketch mode where you will use the Connect Levels tool to choose the levels 
where the stair will run (Figure 16.51). Using the Ctrl key as a modiﬁer, each level can be added 
to a selection set, and the Shift key will allow subtraction.
Figure 16.51 
Connecting levels to a 
multistory stair
Once all the levels have been selected, ﬁnish the sketch to complete the operation. Additional 
stair runs will be generated to the connected levels, regardless of their heights (Figure 16.52). 
Keep in mind that stairs’ landings will be the initial alignment. Adjustments can be made by 
unpinning the stairs from the Multistory Stair group (Figure 16.53).

Annotating Stairs
Stair treads are annotated using the stair tread/riser number, labeled as the Tread Number tool 
on the Annotate tab of the ribbon. You can use this tool from any plan view. When this tool is 
activated, place a string of labels on any component stair by simply selecting the stair run. The 
tread number annotation can be placed at the sides, the middle, or the quarter points along the 
run width (Figure 16.54).

Te tread number

Properties palette.
To customize the tread number annotation, select a tread number instance you have already 
placed in a view, and you will ﬁnd additional parameters in the Properties palette, such as 
Number Size, Orientation, and Display Rule (Figure 16.55). You can also change the start 
 number in the Options bar.
The arrow and label for stairs are controlled independently of the stair type for component 
stairs. When you select individual components of a stair, you will notice that the arrow and label 
can be selected separately. When they are selected, you can change the type of annotation in the 
Type Selector, and you have additional parameters in the Properties palette (Figure 16.56).
Figure 16.56 
Settings for the stair 
path annotation

716 | CHAPTER 16 CREATING STAIRS AND RAILINGS 
Because the stair path annotation for component stairs is a separate element, it can simply be 
deleted when you do not need it in a view. To replace the annotation, go to the Annotate tab in 
the ribbon, and from the Symbol panel click the Stair Path button and pick a stair to apply the 
annotation.
Finally, the cut mark that displays with stairs in a plan view can be slightly customized. The 
settings for cut marks are stored in yet another system family that is nested within the compo-
nent stair type properties. In the Project Browser, navigate to Families ➢ Stairs ➢ Stair Cut Mark 
to ﬁnd the types available in the default project template. Double-click any of these types to 
observe the properties for customizing the cut mark (Figure 16.57). To assign a Cut Mark Type 
value, open the Type Properties dialog box for a component stair type and look for the Graphics 
heading.
Figure 16.57 
Parameters for the 
Stair Cut Mark family
Creating Railings
Railings can be created anywhere in a project. They can be placed on stairs, ramps, ﬂoors, and 
roofs, but they are not hosted elements. The railing does not need to be dependent on a host object 
to exist. From the Architecture tab in the ribbon, you will ﬁnd the Railing tool in the Circulation 
panel. Click the Railing ﬂyout and you will see Sketch Path and Place On Stair/Ramp.
You would use the Sketch Path tool to create a railing on a ﬂat surface such as a slab edge. When 
the Place On Stair/Ramp tool is activated, you must select a stair or a ramp and the placed railing 

CREATING RAILINGS | 717
will follow the slope of the stair or ramp. If you choose this second option, notice in the contextual 
ribbon that you have the option to specify whether the railing will be oriented above the tread or 
the stringer (Figure 16.58)—you can always modify this after the railing has been placed.
Figure 16.58 
Set options for tread or 
stringer placement of 
railings.
Before we create a railing, we should explain the placement of a railing on a stair a little fur-
ther. When you use the Place On Stair/Ramp method, the railing path is automatically assigned 
to the edge of the stair that represents the outside face of the tread and the inside face of the 
stringer (if one is deﬁned). The railing orientation is simply ﬂipped to either side of this path—
toward the tread or toward the stringer. In the Properties palette, you will ﬁnd a parameter 
named Offset from Path that is set to –0′-1″ (–25 mm) by default. Most rail and baluster families 
are developed along a center axis; therefore, the Offset From Path value pushes the railing to one 
side or the other of the railing’s path. To modify this orientation after a railing has been placed, 
select a railing and either click the ﬂip arrow that appears in the view window or right-click  
and select Flip Orientation from the context menu. The Offset From Path value will remain the 
same no matter which way the railing is oriented.
When you click the Railing button from the Circulation panel on the Architecture ribbon, 
you will no longer be given a dialog box asking you to pick a railing type. Now, those choices 
are simply made with the Type Selector. From the drop-down list in the Type Selector, you can 
choose any railing type deﬁned in the project. For stairs only, you can deﬁne the placement of 
the railing to be along the treads or the stringers.
Where would you need to use these sketch segment options for railings? You can use them 
to customize a railing that has been placed on a host. For example, you may need to continue a 
railing from a stair run onto a ﬂat landing. Follow these steps to try this:
1. Download and open the ﬁle c16-Railing-Tool.rvt or c16-Railing-Tool-Metric.rvt-
from this book’s web page.
2. There is a sample stair from Level 1 up to Level 2, and a railing has already been placed 
on the stair. Open the Level 2 ﬂoor plan. Select the railing along the outer edge of the stair 
and click Edit Path on the Mode panel in the contextual ribbon.
3. In the Draw panel of the contextual ribbon, select the Line tool and draw a line from 
the end of the existing railing sketch, as shown in Figure 16.59. Include a short segment 
extending in the direction of the existing sketch line and then draw the next segment to 
the perpendicular edge of the ﬂoor landing.

718 | CHAPTER 16 CREATING STAIRS AND RAILINGS 
Figure 16.59 
Draw two new sketch 
lines to extend the 
railing path.
4. Select both new sketch segments you drew in step 3, and from the Options bar, set the Slope 
option to Flat. Now, this step may not be necessary because the railing sketch should be 
aware that the ﬂoor below is ﬂat, but this is the best way to ensure consistent results with 
manually sketched railing paths.
5. Click the green check mark in the contextual ribbon to ﬁnish the sketch, and activate the 
Default 3D view to observe your results (Figure 16.60).

CREATING RAILINGS | 719
Creating a Custom Railing
Now that we have reviewed the major components of stairs and railings, let’s create a rail. The 
rail you are going to make is a stainless steel cable railing with ﬂat steel stock posts. The com-
pleted railing will look like Figure 16.61. You can adapt the workﬂow you are going to complete 
to create just about any typical railing.
Figure 16.61 
Te ﬁnished cable 
railing
1. To begin, you need to build some of the components of the railing. The rail will have a 
stainless steel top rail, which is already part of the default project template. However, 
you will need to create the cables and the posts. Let’s start with the cable. Select the 
Application button and choose New ➢ Family. Select the Profile-Rail.rft or Metric 
Profile-Rail.rft family template. You will see two intersecting reference planes and 
some text describing the rail centerline and the rail top.
2. You are going to create the cable, which is a simple, circular extrusion. On the Create tab, 
select the Line tool from the Detail panel. Use this tool to create a circle that is ½″ (12 mm) 
in diameter (Figure 16.62). Save this ﬁle as Cable.rfa.
Figure 16.62 
Te cable proﬁle family

720 | CHAPTER 16 CREATING STAIRS AND RAILINGS 
3. You need to do a similar thing to create the stainless steel posts. Select the Application button 
again, choose New ➢ Family, and select Baluster-Post.rft or Metric Baluster-Post.rft 
from the list of new families. This will open the Left elevation view of the family. From the 
Project Browser activate the Ref. Level plan. You are going to make an extrusion that will 
become your baluster.
4. You will notice that the tools in this family are different from those in the proﬁle family 
you just created. The proﬁle family was simple 2D linework that will extrude along a path 
to create the cable. In this baluster family, you are going to create a 3D element. In the 
plan view, choose Extrusion from the Forms panel of the Create tab. Using the intersec-
tion of the reference planes as the lower-left corner of the form, create a box that measures 
1 ½″ × ½″ (40 mm × 12 mm). The shape should look like Figure 16.63. Do not worry about 
adding the dimensions.
Figure 16.63 
Using the Extrusion 
tool to create the post
With the shape created, click the green check mark in the contextual tab of the ribbon to 
make the form. You will see your box in plan, but for the next step, activate the Front ele-
vation view from the Project Browser. You will see a short extrusion of the form you just 
created with the base at the Ref. Level. You will also see two reference planes above the 
form—one represents the typical railing height and the other (the higher one) represents 
the typical guard rail height.
5. Switch to the Modify tab in the ribbon, choose the Align tool, and align the bottom of 
the extrusion to the Ref. Level and the top of the extrusion to the lower reference plane 
(Figure 16.64). Make sure to activate the lock after each alignment. When you are ﬁn-
ished, save the new family as SS-Post.rfa.
6. With both of these families created, you can now make the railing. Open a new project 
ﬁle and load both of these families into it. Choose the Railing command and select 
Sketch Path. Draw a simple line of any length. That will become your railing. Now, 
while you are in the Railing command, you need to create a new system family type to 
be your rail. Since this is a system family, like walls or ﬂoors, you need to create the rail 
by duplicating an existing one. Choose Handrail – Pipe and select Edit Type from the 
Properties palette.

CREATING RAILINGS | 721
Figure 16.64 
Align the post to the 
reference planes.
7. In the Type Properties dialog box, choose Duplicate and name the new family Cable 
Rail. Click OK to close the Name dialog box. The family you duplicated shares many of 
the features of the rail you want. The top rail is a circular pipe, and the rail itself is 2′-6″ 
(700 mm) tall. You need to modify the Rail Structure (Non-Continuous) and the Baluster 
Placement options. Begin with the Rail Structure (Non-Continuous). Choose the Edit but-
ton to open the Edit Rails (Non-Continuous) dialog box. This dialog box has rails that are 
spaced 6″ (150 mm) apart using the Circular Handrail proﬁle. You want to change a few 
things here. First, under the Proﬁle heading, change the proﬁle to Cable : Cable, which 
is the railing proﬁle you just created. You can do that by selecting Cable : Cable from the 
drop-down menu. Do this for all of the proﬁles.
8. Next, you want to change the rail spacing from 6″ (150 mm) to 4″ (100 mm). Modify each 
of the rails to show a 4″ (100 mm) increment. Your rails from bottom to top will read as 
follows:
4″ (100 mm)
8″ (200 mm)
1′-0″ (300 mm)
1′-4″ (400 mm)
1′-8″ (500 mm)
This will not be sufﬁcient to make it to the bottom of the top rail, so you will need to add 
more rails. Click the Insert button to add three more rails: Rail 6, Rail 7, and Rail 8. Make 
the proﬁle for all of those Cable : Cable and give them a height of 2′-0″ (600 mm), 2′-4″ 
(700 mm), and 2′-8″ (800 mm), respectively. Here you can also deﬁne the materiality of the 
rail. We have applied Stainless Steel to all of the rails. The completed dialog box will look 
like Figure 16.65. Once you have ﬁnished, click OK.

9. Now you need to adjust the baluster. In the Type Properties dialog box, at Baluster 
Placement, select Edit. This opens the Edit Baluster Placement dialog box.
10. Like in the rail, you need to modify the family that is used to make the baluster. From the 
Baluster Family drop-down menu for both Main Pattern (the upper portion of the dialog 
box) and Posts (the lower portion of the dialog box), change the family to SS Post : SS 
Post. Also, you want the post centered under the top rail. Because you built the post fam-
ily to one side of the reference planes, you need to offset the post to center it. In the Offset 
column on the far right, enter a value of ¾″ (19 mm). The ﬁnished dialog box will look 
like Figure 16.66.
 
11. Click OK twice to ﬁnish the rail. The completed cable railing will look like Figure 16.67. 
You can see how quick and easy it is to create some simple railings. You can ﬁnd the ﬁn-
ished railing, c16-SS Railing.rvt, on the book’s web page.
Creating Glass Railings with the Curtain Wall Tool
The most challenging railings often require exceptions to the rules. This usually means you are 
trying to manually locate balusters or use panels that are not part of the routine railing deﬁni-
tion. If you tried to deﬁne each of these exceptions as a different railing type, your project would 
be overﬂowing with railing types. The best solution for these types of railings is to diverge from 
the Railing tool and use the Curtain Wall tool.

724 | CHAPTER 16 CREATING STAIRS AND RAILINGS 
By using curtain walls, you will be able to create railings by modeling the balusters and pan-
els inside the Curtain Panel family template (Figure 16.68). Another nice feature about this tech-
nique is that the railing is a room-bounding element because it is actually a wall. That makes 
this perfect for mezzanine conditions that require area calculations—certainly more efﬁcient 
than creating redundant room-separation lines!
Figure 16.68 
Curtain panel as a 
railing
Start by creating a single panel using the Curtain Panel template. The family may contain not 
only the panel for the railing but also the balusters. Once you load this panel into your project, 
you can create curtain walls with predeﬁned panel widths (Figure 16.69).
Figure 16.69

with custom baluster 
locations
Because curtain panels allow you to unpin predeﬁned grids (as well as create other grid 
 locations), you will be able to quickly and easily make exceptions to the rules that you previously 
deﬁned (Figure 16.70) and create several unique baluster locations speciﬁc to the installation.
When you are creating railings as curtain walls, be sure to ﬁlter your schedules accordingly 
to prevent these “railings” from being included in your curtain wall schedules. If you want 
to download this example project, it is in the Chapter 16 folder on the book’s web page and is 
named c16-CurtainWall-Railing.rvt.

These outside-the-box techniques should give you some great ideas for making custom rail-
ings faster and more interesting than you could ever have imagined.
Using the Railing Tool for Other Objects
Currently, Revit software does not have a speciﬁc tool to allow components to be quickly and 
easily distributed along a user-deﬁned path. In some cases you could use line-based families, 
but these do not work in curved conditions. You could also experiment with adaptive compo-
nents in the conceptual massing environment, but that could be too complicated for a simple, 
repeating element. In the meantime, consider using the Railing tool to distribute elements along 
paths for a variety of uses besides just for railings.
Carefully Identifying Customized Model Elements
In this chapter we make a few suggestions to use tools designed to create one type of element to 
generate other types of model elements. We highly recommend you take care in identifying such 
elements so that they may be clearly understood by other people who might use your model. If not 
clearly identiﬁed, these elements could cause trouble in BIM applications such as 3D coordination, 
quantity surveying, and estimating, as well as where speciﬁcation databases are connected to the 
design model. Here are some suggestions for identiﬁcation:
 
◆
Use the Assembly Code property to assign an appropriate system description.
 
◆
Provide a unique and clearly recognizable Type Name value.
 
◆
Provide a clear description in the Type Comments ﬁeld.
continues

726 | CHAPTER 16 CREATING STAIRS AND RAILINGS 
Whatever method you choose to identify these types of customized elements, be sure to indicate 
the method in your project’s execution plan. Whether it is a BIM execution plan, project execution 
plan, or other similar document, this type of communication and collaboration is essential to the 
reduction of errors and rework.
When using railing functionality outside of a railing to distribute elements along paths, keep 
in mind these three rules:
 
◆
You will probably want to nest your family into a baluster family template (rather than creat-
ing it directly as a baluster). This is because the existing parameters within the baluster family 
can cause your geometry to ﬂy apart if it needs to move up and down as a single element.
 
◆
Do not expect your nested element to schedule or tag. If you need the elements to schedule 
or tag individually, you probably want to place them individually (or use another tech-
nique, such as a line-based family).
 
◆
Do not share parameters of nested families in an attempt to schedule. Your element will 
not schedule properly.
In some cases, you will want the railing family to have associated proﬁles, like the shading 
device in Figure 16.71. The railing proﬁles are used to create the shading ﬁns, and the balusters 
are the support elements.

Figure 16.71 
Railing as shading 
device
Using railings to quickly and evenly distribute components along a path is great during 
design and allows for quick iteration. Before you decide to use Railings in this fashion, consider 
whether a simple array can perform the same function. Outdoor elements such as lampposts are 
particularly appropriate for distributed placement (Figure 16.72). In this example, a lamppost 
has been nested into a baluster family.

USING THE RAILING TOOL FOR OTHER OBJECTS | 727
Figure 16.72 
Lamppost nested into a 
baluster family
Figure 16.73 
Lampposts distributed 
along a path as a balus-
ter family
Once this lamppost has been nested in the baluster family, you will be able to create a custom 
“railing” with the lamp designated as the “baluster.” This will allow you to quickly and easily 
distribute lampposts along a sketch at speciﬁc intervals that can be modiﬁed as a parameter. So, 
for example, if the lamppost was originally distributed on 60′ (18 m) centers, you could quickly 
redeﬁne it to occur on 40′ (12 m) intervals (Figure 16.73).
You can use this for any repetitive elements that must be placed on center and evenly distrib-
uted along a path. Other uses might include pipe bollards and outdoor planting.

components as

Even a design pass at light rail tracks (including railcars) can be distributed along paths 
(Figure 16.74). In this case, the rail sleepers are balusters, and proﬁles are used to create the  
rails and the rail bed. The monorails are easy too. The vertical supports and railcars are balusters, 
and the suspended track is the rail proﬁle. This ﬁle can be downloaded from the Chapter 16 
folder on the book’s web page. Look for the c16-Monorail and Railway Railing.rvt ﬁle.
Important Best Practices
Here are some best practices to consider with regard to creating complex stairs and railings:
 
◆
Do not forget to nest your family components whenever possible and appropriate. Tis will keep 
the components together when associated with some other template that contains hardwired 
parameters and reference planes. It will also save you time during design changes and iteration.
 
◆
Do not forget to use examples to base your system on if you struggle with creating the stairs 
in this chapter. If you get stuck, you can download the sample stairs from this chapter’s ﬁles 
and use them for a starting point when creating your custom stair. Just remember, it is usually 
easier to build and test a custom stair or railing in a sample project ﬁrst. Ten copy and paste 
or use Transfer Project Standards to get the custom stair or railing from the test project to 
your actual project. Download sample ﬁles for this document at the book’s web page. You will 
probably want to copy your custom stairs and railings in an easy-to-access project that contains 
several ﬁnished examples (since they cannot be kept as family components).
 
◆
Do not forget that the level of detail and visibility are crucial to your ﬁle if you care about 
graphic refresh times and printing. As you model the components of your custom stairs and 
railings, assign appropriate orientation and level of detail (Coarse, Medium, or Fine). You will 
notice a diﬀerence when you pan and rotate your model.
 
◆
Take care to ﬁlter schedules. Using a curtain wall as a railing may have certain advantages, 
but you also want to make sure your curtain wall schedules are ﬁltered to exclude these types 
of elements.

THE BOTTOM LINE | 729
Overall, be careful when reaching into your bag of tips and tricks! You need to weigh the cost of 
implementing a new process against the cost of doing what is familiar. Make sure you are main-
taining a balance between predictability and eﬃciency. Tere are frequently two extremes that you 
need to avoid.
High Predictability, Low Eﬃciency.  Most people will grasp the solution that you intend 
to implement; they will fully understand the technology and technique. But they will also 
quickly realize that managing design changes and iteration will be highly manual and time-
consuming. And the rest of the team will doubt your leadership and understanding of the 
technology and processes.
High Eﬃciency, Low Predictability.  Te solution will be very eﬃcient to manage 
the design, but only you or a few team members will understand what you have created. 
Everyone else on the team will resist making any changes to your creation out of fear that 
they will break it.
So, what is important with creating interesting and innovative stairs and railings is that you manage 
to strike a balance between these two extremes. Just remember these four simple characteristics:
 
◆
Beneﬁcial—not just to you but to the project team
 
◆
Eﬃcient—implementation and changes that are fast and predictable
 
◆
Elegant—understood by the team and by any new team members
 
◆
Repeatable—can be used on many projects
If you cannot remember these guidelines, the handy acronym of BEER should help. When you are 
not sure which solution is the best one to follow, your team will tend to gravitate to whatever allows 
them to have a beer at the end of the day.
In other words, whatever allows them to decompress, reenergize, and come back to work the next 
day refreshed, focused, and enthusiastic will ultimately win out. And keep in mind that this prin-
ciple is not just important to stairs and railings or Revit or BIM but is also important to having 
an interesting life.
Te Bottom Line
Understand the key components of stairs and railings.  Having a complete understand-
ing of the components of stairs is important. You do not want to set about breaking the rules 
until you understand how best (and when) those rules can be broken.
Master It  What are the essential parts of stairs?
Understand the different stair tools and apply them to custom designs.  Designing 
in a spreadsheet is hard. Step back and consider what you are trying to accomplish. 
If you will look at the components that make up stairs, you will see some interesting 
opportunities.
Master It  How would you create a continuous tread that was not monolithic? What 
would you do if you wanted to create a custom stringer? Are balusters always vertical 
and used to support handrails? What if your particular stair just cannot be modeled in 
the Stairs tool?

730 | CHAPTER 16 CREATING STAIRS AND RAILINGS 
Design railings and use the Railing tool for other model elements.  From model patterns 
to geometric intricacy, there is a lot that can be created with the Railing tool. When this does 
not work, look to the curtain wall for “railings” that can contain space and allow “balusters” 
to be conveniently unlocked.
Master It  Why would you not use a railing to manage repetitive relationships? What if 
you need to accurately distribute geometry along a path?
Implement best practices.  There are speciﬁc best practices when creating custom stairs and 
railings. Pay attention to nesting geometry, maintaining the right level of detail, and ﬁltering 
schedules so the metadata ends up in the right place.
Master It  Is it possible to create solutions that are too efﬁcient? What is the big deal with 
detail levels? Finally, what is the most important thing to remember before creating an 
elegant workaround?

 Part 5 
 Documentation 
Up to now, we’ve discussed how to create an Autodesk® Revit® model and use  building information 
modeling (BIM) to derive interesting forms, create parametric content, and perform analysis on 
your design. This part focuses on how to document those designs in the  construction document 
phase and ultimately present those drawings to project stakeholders. 
 We will walk through the process of creating detail views and 2D content (detailing);  generating 
different types of plan views and sheets (documenting); and ﬁ nally, how to add text, notes, and 
dimensions (annotating).

 Chapter  17 
 Detailing Your Design   
 As you’ve seen so far, you can show information in Autodesk ® Revit ® software in a variety of 
ways, including 3D views, plans, sections, and elevations. In each of these cases, the geometry is 
typically modeled based on design intent, meaning that your goal isn’t to model everything but 
to model enough to capture the overall scope of the proposed building. To this end, it becomes 
necessary to embellish the model in speciﬁ c views with more detailed information. These take 
the shape of 2D detail elements that you will use to augment views and add extra information. 
 In this chapter, you’ll learn to 
 
◆
Create details 
 
◆
 Add detail components to families 
 
◆
Learn efﬁ cient detailing 
 
◆
Reuse details from other ﬁ les 
 Creating Details 
 If you are accustomed to using 2D CAD applications to create drawings, you should ﬁ rst be aware 
of how the detailing process in Revit differs from CAD drafting. In Autodesk ® AutoCAD ® software, 
for example, you would create a new DWG ﬁ le and then add lines, arcs, circles, hatch patterns, text, 
and dimensions to develop a detail. You might use blocks to combine repeatable elements to increase 
efﬁ ciency and maintain consistency. In Revit, you will create additional views within the project 
ﬁ le, to which you might add 2D embellishment along with annotation and dimensions. Details can 
incorporate parts of the 3D model or can be empty views exclusive to 2D elements.  
 Using View Types for Detailing 
 Before we discuss the process of detailing, let’s review the fundamental views in which you can 
create details: detail views and drafting views. 
Detail Views  Detail views are essentially subsets of the views we’ve discussed previously in 
this book such as plans, elevations, and sections. When you create a new section or callout, you 
have the option to select Detail View from the Type Selector. The model is still displayed in a detail 
view, although you can set the Display Model view property to Do Not Display if necessary. 
 Because you can use detailing tools in any view, we will refer to any view that displays the 
model as a detail view throughout the remainder of this chapter. 
 Refer to Chapter  2 , “Exploring the UI and Organizing Projects,” for more information about 
the difference between callouts and detail views.

734 | CHAPTER 17 DETAILING YOUR DESIGN 
Drafting Views  Drafting views do not display model content. Instead, they are simply a 
blank canvas within which you can create details using only 2D elements such as lines, arcs, 
circles, or 2D families. Drafting views can be associated with sections or callouts, but those 
view references will display a reference label such as SIM (similar) or TYP (typical). You can 
customize the Reference Label value in the type properties of each view.
Download and open the ﬁle c17-Sample-Building.rvt or c17-Sample-Metric.rvt from 
this book’s web page (www.sybex.com/go/masteringrevit2018).
From the Project Browser, activate the view Section 2, and you will see an overall section of 
the building. We will create a more detailed section callout of the exterior wall at the right side 
of the view. Let’s walk through the steps to generate this view:
1. Switch to the View tab in the ribbon, locate the Create panel, and then click Callout ➢ 
Rectangle.
2. In the Type Selector, change the view type to Wall Section.
3. Sketch a rectangular region around the exterior wall at the right side of the building.
4. When you ﬁnish sketching the new callout, it should look like the section view shown in 
Figure 17.1. Double-click the callout head to activate the new view, or alternatively you 
can right-click the callout and select Go To View.

5. In the Properties palette, change the View Name to Wall Section North, set Detail Level 
to Medium, and change Scale to 1/2″=1′-0″ (1:25).
You have taken the ﬁrst step toward creating the path from the overall down to the spe-
ciﬁc. From the plan and an overall section, you have created a wall section. Before we drill 
down even further, let’s break the view down to isolate the transition conditions at the 
ﬂoors and roof.
6. Select the crop region in the wall section view and you will see a number of view break icons. 
Click one of the Horizontal View Break icons along either vertical edge of the crop region.
7. You now have two crop subregions, but you will need to create one more. Select the crop 
region again and then click and drag the grip at the bottom of the upper subregion to 
stretch it downward. Do not drag it too close to the lower subregion because it will rejoin 
the subregions back into the original crop boundary.
8. Use the grips at the top edge and bottom edge of the three subregions to show the inter-
section conditions with the Level 1, Level 2, and Roof.
9. Select the crop region once again, and you will see vertical double arrows at the middle of 
each subregion. Use these arrows to move the subregions closer together.
The ﬁnal result of this exercise should look like the image in Figure 17.2.

736 | CHAPTER 17 DETAILING YOUR DESIGN 
Working with the Detailing Process
Now that you have completed the setup of a detail view, we will discuss three different method-
ologies with which you can approach the detailing process: stand-alone detailing, hybrid detailing, 
and model detailing. These are terms we invented to help you understand and plan your detailing 
efforts as your skills improve in the Revit environment.
Stand-Alone Detailing (Beginner)  If you are relatively new to the Revit environment, you 
might choose to develop your details without any part of the 3D model serving the detail. In this 
scenario, you can use either detail views or drafting views; however, you may tend to use more of 
the latter. If you use detail views, the Display Model view property (in the Properties palette with 
the view selected) will most often be set to Do Not Display. The Display Model settings allow you 
to see the model components in a regular line weight, half tone, or not at all in a detail view.
With a stand-alone detailing approach, you forfeit some ability to ensure your details accu-
rately reﬂect the modeled condition. In a detail view, you may temporarily return the Display 
Model view property to Normal or Halftone, but you may be able to draft more comfortably 
using the blank canvas of an empty view.
Hybrid Detailing (Intermediate)  As you become more experienced with detailing in 
Revit, you may start to use a more balanced number of detail views and drafting views. 
With a hybrid approach you will maintain the model in any detail views, and you will add 
detail components to embellish the 3D model. This approach tends to yield a more accurate 
representation of the intended design, but it will require more time and care to maintain as 
the model evolves throughout the design process. This is the workﬂow used by most teams 
detailing in Revit.
In Figure 17.3, you can see a detail view in which the Display Model view property has been set to 
Halftone. This illustrates the difference between what is modeled and what is a detail component.

Example of a detail 
view with embellished

DETAILING TOOLS | 737
Model Detailing (Advanced)  The most complex approach to detailing can also be the most 
efﬁcient—once you become familiar with creating families and customizing your project 
templates. The approach we refer to as model detailing still involves the use of some detail 
components; however, they are embedded into model elements where applicable. For exam-
ple, in a wood-framed structure, detail elements such as sill plates, studs, joists, or anchors 
can be embedded in wall type deﬁnitions. The details will display automatically when the 
walls are displayed in a section detail view.
With any of these three methods we’ve described, there is a range in which you can use the 
model to help generate your details. You should plan your approach before you begin detail-
ing in your project. As always, the more time you spend preparing your template content in the 
beginning, the less time you will need to develop your details later in the project.
Detailing Tools
Even when you’re creating details, Revit has a variety of parametric tools to allow you to lever-
age working in a BIM environment. You can use these tools to create strictly 2D geometry or to 
augment details you are trying to create from 3D plans, sections, or callouts. To become truly 
efﬁcient at using Revit to create the drawings necessary to both design and document your 
project, it’s important to become acquainted with these tools—you will ﬁnd yourself using them 
over and over again throughout your process. All of these tools are located on the Detail panel 
of the Annotate tab.
This small but very potent toolbox is what you will need to familiarize yourself with to cre-
ate a majority of the 2D linework and components that will become the details in your project. 
To better demonstrate how these tools are used, let’s step through them to explain each one’s 
purpose. Note that some of the tools may not be available depending on the active view. For best 
results, make sure you have a plan or detail view active before continuing.
Using the Detail Line Tool
The Detail Line tool is the ﬁrst tool located on the Detail panel of the Annotate tab. This tool is 
the closest thing you’ll ﬁnd to CAD drafting because it allows you to create view-speciﬁc line-
work using different line styles and it provides tools for drawing and manipulating different 
line shapes.
Detail lines are view speciﬁc—they appear only in the view in which they’re drawn. They 
also have an arrangement to their placement, meaning you can layer them underneath or on top 
of other objects. This is especially important when you begin using a combination of regions, 
detail lines, and model content to create your details.
Using the Detail Line tool is fairly easy. Selecting the tool will change your ribbon tab to look 
like Figure 17.4. This new tab will have several panels that allow you to add and manipulate 
linework.

738 | CHAPTER 17 DETAILING YOUR DESIGN 
There are three major panels on this new tab: Line Style, Draw, and Modify. Because of their use 
sequence (selecting the line type, creating the shape, and modifying the line), we’ll talk about 
them in order from right to left.
Line Style  This panel includes a drop-down menu that allows you to choose a line style in 
which to produce the linework in this view. The drop-down menu has all the default Revit 
line styles as well as any custom ones you might have made for your project or to accom-
modate ofﬁce or client standards. The active line will be the one displayed in the drop-down 
window before it’s expanded.
New line styles can be added at any time in the project, and many ofﬁces ﬁnd it necessary to 
add custom line styles beyond the thin, medium, and wide ones available in Revit out of the 
box. To add more styles or to just see the complete list, choose Additional Settings from the 
Manage tab and select Line Styles. For more information about creating your own custom 
line styles, refer to Chapter 4, “Conﬁguring Templates and Standards.”
Draw  The Draw panel contains a number of geometry tools to draw within the active view. 
The tools allow you to create lines, boxes, circles, splines, ellipses, and arcs. The last tool in 
the bottom row is the Pick tool. This tool allows you to select a line previously drawn or a 
portion of a model element (say an edge) and add linework on top of the existing shape.
Modify  The Modify panel has several tools that you can use to modify any of the linework 
already placed within the view. The larger tools, from left to right, are Align, Offset, Mirror 
(axis), Mirror (line), Move, Copy, Rotate, and Trim.
Using the Linework Tool
Although not part of the Annotate tab, the Linework tool helps you make your detail compo-
sition more legible. Default settings for object styles and line weights will manage most of a 
view’s composition automatically, but you sometimes need to adjust a line or two to clarify a 
detail. The Linework tool allows you to modify the edges of model elements in a view-speciﬁc 
context. Note that this tool is not available in a drafting view because it works only on model 
elements.
To use the Linework tool, switch to the Modify tab in the ribbon, locate the View panel, and 
click Linework. This will add the familiar Line Style selector panel at the end of the ribbon. 
Simply choose the line style you want to assign and then select an edge of a model element. 
The edges you pick can be almost anything: cut lines of walls, families, edges of ﬂoor slabs, and 
so on. Selecting the edge of an element will change the default line style to the style you have 
Certiﬁcation

chosen. To return an edge to its original line style, use the Linework tool again, but select <By 
Category> from the Line Style drop-down list.
You can also choose to remove lines using this tool. By selecting the <Invisible Lines> line 
type, you can make some edges disappear. Use this method instead of covering unwanted lines 
with masking regions.
Another great use of the Linework tool is to indicate the edges of overhead ceilings or ﬂoors 
in a ﬂoor plan view. To accomplish this task, set the Underlay property of the active view to the 
level where the ceiling, ﬂoor, or roof is associated. If necessary, set the Underlay Orientation to 
Reﬂected Ceiling Plan. Start the Linework tool, select an overhead line style, and then pick any 
edges you’d like to see in the ﬂoor plan view. When you’re ﬁnished, set the Underlay property 
back to None, and not only will the lines you created with the Linework tool remain, but they 
will update if the overhead model object is modiﬁed.
Let’s use the Linework tool to continue our exercise with the wall section detail by following 
these steps:
1. Switch to the Modify tab in the ribbon, locate the View panel, and then click the Linework 
tool.
2. From the Line Style drop-down menu in the contextual tab of the ribbon, choose Medium 
Lines.
3. As indicated in Figure 17.5, click the inside face and the outside face of the exterior wall. 
Also click the edge of the wall below the window sill.

740 | CHAPTER 17 DETAILING YOUR DESIGN 
Using Filled Regions and Masking Regions
The next tool on the Detail panel of the Annotate tab is the Region tool, which contains two 
individual commands: Filled Region and Masking Region. Regions are two-dimensional areas 
of any shape or size that you can ﬁll with a pattern. This pattern (much like a hatch in AutoCAD 
software) will dynamically adjust based on changes to the region boundary. You can  manipulate 
the draw order of regions in the same manner as detail lines. Regions also have a type property 
(Background) that can be set to Opaque (hiding the objects they are placed over) or Transparent 
(letting the elements below show through).
Filled regions allow you to choose from a variety of hatch patterns to ﬁll the region. These are 
commonly used in details to illustrate materials such as rigid insulation, concrete, or plywood. 
Masking regions, on the other hand, do not include a ﬁll pattern. Masking regions are typically 
used to “hide” or mask certain content from a view that you don’t want shown or printed. As an 
example, there might be a particularly detailed way in which two walls join and their materials 
overlap. In some cases, it doesn’t make sense to model that condition, and it makes more sense 
to use detail lines to describe the condition. Here you would need to mask a portion of the view 
so you can essentially draw over it with new content.
When selecting the Region tool, you will be taken directly into Sketch mode, and you’ll have 
a series of tools similar to those for drawing detail lines. The Draw panel allows you to create 
any number of shapes with all the associated tools to move, copy, or offset the linework.
When creating either kind of region, it’s important to note that you cannot complete Sketch 
mode unless the boundaries you draw are in closed loops. You can create as many closed-loop 
boundaries as you want as long as they do not overlap and are all formed with closed loops 
(Figure 17.6). Notice in the ﬁgure that, in addition to the use of multiple closed loops, you can 
use any combination of line styles to draw the boundary of a region.
Doors and Symbolic Lines
In the architecture industry, doors are typically modeled in a closed position but shown as open and 
with a door swing direction in plan view. To get this dual representation, in the Family Editor turn 
oﬀ the visibility of the door panel (extruded solid form) in the plan view and draw the 90-degree 
open door panel and its swing using symbolic lines. Control this visibility in the family environ-
ment using the Visibility settings explained in the next section of this chapter.
Symbolic lines can be controlled using the same Visibility settings available for detail components 
and the solid model elements in the family. You can use the same logic and draw the dashed lines 
that represent the door-opening direction in elevations.

DETAILING TOOLS | 741
Another consideration for using regions is the linework that borders a region. When start-
ing the Region tool, you’ll be able to choose the line style you want to use for the border of the 
region from the Line Style drop-down (similar to working with detail lines). You can change 
line styles for any of the segments of the region and even make them all different if needed.
One especially useful segment line style is <Invisible Lines>. When drawn in Sketch mode, 
these appear as gray lines, but once the sketch is completed, they become invisible lines. When 
used with a masking region, this line style can create a completely invisible box that allows you 
to hide elements that are unwanted in a particular view. Figure 17.7 shows the same masking region 
in two instances, one selected and the other not selected. You can see how the masking  
region seems to disappear, covering the ﬁlled region. Use caution if you decide to use  
masking regions with invisible boundary lines because you will not be aware of their existence 
unless you hover the mouse pointer over them. In the example shown in Figure 17.7, the end result 
can also be achieved by modifying the ﬁlled region and drawing two additional invisible lines.

742 | CHAPTER 17 DETAILING YOUR DESIGN 
Filled regions have slightly more options because, unlike masking regions, they let you con-
trol the parameters of the ﬁll pattern. Filled region types are another type of Revit system fam-
ily. A region type created in one view can be used in any other view, and modifying the type 
properties of a region in one view changes it in all the other views.
Figure 17.8 shows the list of ﬁlled region types from one of our ofﬁce templates. You’ll notice 
that many of the region names are indicative of various materials. Instead of naming the ﬁlled 
region types according to their graphic properties, such as Diagonal-Up, it’s a good idea to use 
the identity parameters such as Type Mark and Assembly Code to help extend the effectiveness 
of even 2D detail elements.
Figure 17.8

type from the Type 
Selector within the 
Properties palette

DETAILING TOOLS | 743
The ﬁlled regions also have additional properties. By highlighting any placed region, you can 
open its type properties from the Properties palette by clicking Edit Type (Figure 17.9). These 
properties allow you to control the ﬁll pattern, background opacity, line weight, and color of the 
region. Remember that these properties are by type, so if you want a region that is opaque and 
then decide you also want one that is transparent, you’ll need to create another type.
Standardizing Type Names for Filled Regions
Having some sort of naming convention applied to your ﬁlled region types can help you  organize 
the Type Selector in a way that is easy for the project team to understand. You’ll notice in  
Figure 17.8 that we’ve organized the region names around a two-number MasterSpec division preﬁx. 
Because MasterSpec is tied to the keynoting system as well, project teams tend to be familiar with 
the naming convention. Tis approach also keeps similar material types together rather than all 
the materials being sorted alphabetically. Take Concrete and Precast Concrete as an example. You 
can see in Figure 17.8 that those material types are close together in the drop-down list based on 
their preﬁx.

ﬁlled region

744 | CHAPTER 17 DETAILING YOUR DESIGN 
As we discussed in Chapter 4, ﬁlled regions can use either a drafting pattern or a model 
pattern. Refer to Chapter 4 for instructions on how to create a custom ﬁll pattern. For now, let’s 
review the process of creating a new ﬁlled region type.
Creating a New Filled Region Type
To create a new ﬁlled region type, begin by duplicating an existing region and then modify its 
properties. Follow these steps to get started:
1. Switch to the Annotate tab in the ribbon, and on the Detail panel click Region ➢ Filled 
Region. Click the Edit Type button in the Properties palette.
2. Click Duplicate in the Type Properties dialog box.
3. Name your new region Earth Fill and then click the button in the Fill Pattern ﬁeld to 
open the Fill Pattern dialog box.
4. Make sure you have Drafting selected at the bottom of the Fill Patterns dialog box. Select 
the pattern named Earth.
Note that you can create ﬁlled region types with model patterns; however, you must 
make sure the region types are named clearly so you can recognize the difference 
between similar regions. For example, the ﬁlled region you would use to indicate brick 
masonry in a section is a drafting pattern (diagonal hatch), whereas a brick surface pat-
tern is a model pattern and can be used in an elevation or plan view.
5. When you ﬁnish, click OK until you exit all the dialog boxes. The same region patterns 
that you created for a ﬁlled region can also be associated with material surfaces or cuts by 
accessing the Materials dialog box from the Manage tab in the ribbon.
Placing a Filled Region
Now that you have created a new ﬁlled region type, let’s add a region to the detail and explore 
how different boundaries can be used to create unique graphics without separate linework. If 
you continue from the previous exercise, the Filled Region command will still be active. If not, 
switch to the Annotate tab of the ribbon, locate the Detail panel, and then click Region ➢ Filled 
Region and follow these steps:
1. In the Line Style panel in the ribbon, select Wide Lines from the drop-down menu.
2. In the Draw panel of the contextual tab in the ribbon, select the Line tool and then sketch 
an area to the right of the slab edge at the bottom of the detail view. Use Figure 17.10 as a 
guide.
3. After you complete a closed loop of lines, hold down the Ctrl key while selecting the lines 
to the right and below the top line of the sketch, as shown in Figure 17.10. With  multiple 
lines selected, go back to the Line Style drop-down menu in the ribbon and choose 
<Invisible Lines>.

DETAILING TOOLS | 745
The sketch line in the ﬁlled region boundary that is coincident with the edge of the slab 
should be of the same line weight as the setting for the slab. In this sample ﬁle, both 
Floors and Wide Lines are set to a line weight of 5.
Adding Detail Components
Another important tool for detailing is the detail component—a family that consists of exclu-
sively 2D geometry. You can schedule detail components, tag them, and assign keynotes.

will look similar to the image shown in Figure 17.11.

746 | CHAPTER 17 DETAILING YOUR DESIGN 
Because they are families, they can also be stored in your ofﬁce library and shared easily across 
projects.
To add a detail component to a view, select Detail Component from the Component drop-
down list located on the Annotate tab, and use the Type Selector to choose from components 
that are already loaded into the model. If you don’t see a detail component you want to insert 
in the Type Selector, click the Load Families button in the contextual tab of the ribbon, and load 
one from the default library or your ofﬁce library.
Remember, in the Autodesk default family library, detail components are stored in the Detail 
Items folder, under which the folders are organized according to MasterFormat or a similar 
standard coding system. Many building objects are represented in the default library with detail 
components. For example, if you are looking for a detail component representing a steel beam, 
don’t look in the library under Structural Framing—instead look in the Detail Items folder.
Adding Detail Components and Embellishing the View
We have preloaded some detail component families into the sample building project you down-
loaded earlier in this chapter. Use the following components to further embellish the bottom, 
middle, and top portions of the wall section (the metric equivalents may have an M_ preﬁx):
 
◆
Base Molding - Section
 
◆
Nominal Cut Lumber - Section
 
◆
Corrugated Wall Tie - Section
These detail components are all speciﬁcally designed to be used in a section detail. There 
are other similar detail components in the default library that can be used in a plan detail or 
when the object is to be shown from the side. Figure 17.12 shows an example of some detail 
embellishment.
You might notice that there are only three types loaded for the detail component family named 
Nominal Cut Lumber - Section. What if you need to load more types from that same family? This 
scenario occurs sometimes when you use families that have a type catalog. Refer to Chapter 15, 
“Designing with the Family Editor,” for more information about families and type catalogs.
To reload a family for access to additional types within the family, one option is to start the 
Detail Component tool again, click Load Family, and ﬁnd that family in the library. A simpler 
solution is to locate the family in the Project Browser (the Families branch is toward the bottom), 
right-click the family name, and then choose Reload from the context menu. If the family’s source 
ﬁle (the RFA ﬁle) is available and the family has an associated type catalog, the Type Catalog dia-
log box will appear and allow you to select additional types to be loaded into the project.

DETAILING TOOLS | 747
Follow these steps:
1. In the Project Browser, expand the Families branch of the tree, locate and expand the 
Detail Items branch, and then locate Nominal Cut Lumber-Section or M_Nominal Cut 
Lumber-Section.
2. Right-click the family name and select Reload from the context menu.
Note that you may be prompted to select a family ﬁle if the original RFA ﬁle cannot be 
located. In that case, we have provided the RFA and the accompanying type catalog in 
TXT format along with this chapter’s exercise downloads.
3. Select the types 2 × 10 and 2 × 14 (50 × 200 mm and 50 × 300 mm) from the Specify Types 
dialog box, as shown in Figure 17.13, and then click OK.
4. Use the additional types to continue adding detail components to the view within the 
ﬂoor element at the middle of the detail view.

748 | CHAPTER 17 DETAILING YOUR DESIGN 
Arranging Elements in the View
So far you have created all the content in order and have not had to change the arrangement of 
any of the elements. However, knowing how to change the arrangement is an important part of 
detailing, so you don’t have to draw it all in exact sequence. Arrangement allows you to change 
the position of an element, such as a line or a detail component, relative to another element. Much 
like layers in Adobe Photoshop or arrangement of objects in Microsoft PowerPoint, Revit allows 
you to place 2D elements in front of or behind others. You’ll see the Arrange panel on the far right 
once an element or group of elements is selected and the Modify menu appears (Figure 17.14).
Figure 17.13 
Select types to be 
loaded from a family 
type catalog.
Figure 17.14 
Te Arrange panel
From here, you can choose from among four options of arrangement.
Bring To Front  This brings the selected objects all the way to the front of the stack. In 
Figure 17.15, there are two detail lines on top of a masking region, which is also on top of a 
ﬁlled region. By selecting the detail lines and choosing Bring To Front, we moved the lines on 
top of all the other elements.
Figure 17.15 
Bring To Front

DETAILING TOOLS | 749
Bring Forward  This option brings the selected elements one step closer to the front in 
a given sequence. In Figure 17.16, we’ve selected the masking region and chosen Bring 
Forward, and now it appears on top of one of the detail lines. Note that each of the detail 
lines is its own layer within this stack.
Figure 17.16 
Bring Forward
Send To Back  This option does the exact opposite of the Bring To Front tool and will send 
an object all the way to the back of the stack. In Figure 17.17, we’ve chosen the masking region 
again and sent it to the back.
Figure 17.17 
Send To Back
Send Backwards  The fourth option, Send Backwards, will step the selected elements one 
step backward in the stack. In Figure 17.18, we’ve chosen the horizontal detail line and sent it 
backward; it now appears behind the ﬁlled region.

Repeating Detail Component
Repeating elements are common in architectural projects. Masonry, metal decking, and wall 
studs are some common elements that repeat at regular intervals. The tool to help create and 
manage these types of elements is called the Repeating Detail Component, and it’s located in the 
Component ﬂyout on the Annotate tab (Figure 17.19).
Certiﬁcation
Objective
Figure 17.19 
Choosing Repeating 
Detail Component
This tool lets you place a detail component in a linear conﬁguration where the detail compo-
nent repeats at a set interval. This allows you to draw a “line” that then becomes your repeating 
component. The default repeating detail is common brick depicted in section, repeating in regu-
lar courses (Figure 17.20). Creating elements like this not only lets you later tag and keynote the 
materials but also gives you some easy ﬂexibility over arraying these elements manually.
Figure 17.20 
A brick repeating detail
Beware the Limitations of Repeating Detail Components
Before you decide to use the Repeating Detail Component tool in any of your details, you should 
be aware of its limitations. Although repeating detail components can be scheduled, they cannot 
be tagged or assigned a keynote as you would for a simple detail component. If your annotation 
methodology relies on tags and/or keynotes, we recommend you avoid the use of repeating detail 
components. Instead of the repeating detail component, you can use a single detail component and 
then use the Array command.

DETAILING TOOLS | 751
Before you create a repeating detail component, we’ll cover the properties behind one so 
you can get a better idea of how they work. Start the Repeating Detail Component command 
and draw a sample line using the Brick type. Exit the command by pressing Esc or clicking the 
Modify button and then select the Brick repeating detail. In the Properties palette, click Edit 
Type to open the Type Properties dialog box.
Let’s review what each of these settings does.
Detail  This setting allows you to select the detail component to be repeated.
Layout  This option offers four different modes.
Fixed Distance  This is the absolute spacing between components, for example, a strictly 
deﬁned center-to-center measurement.
Fixed Number  This mode sets the number of times a component repeats itself in the 
space between the start and endpoint (the length of the sketched path).
Fill Available Space  Regardless of the value you choose for Spacing, the detail compo-
nent is repeated on the path using its actual width as the Spacing value.
Maximum Spacing  The detail component is repeated using the set spacing, and the 
number of repeated components is set so that only complete components are drawn. 
Revit creates as many copies of the component as will ﬁt on the path.
Inside  This option adjusts the placement of the last detail component in the repeating 
detail. If Inside is selected, the last component will be drawn inside the endpoint of the 
repeating detail line. If Inside is not selected, the last component will be drawn outside or 
overlapping the endpoint of the line.
Spacing  This option is active only when Fixed Distance or Maximum Spacing is selected 
as the method of repetition. It represents the distance at which you want the repeating detail 
component to repeat. It doesn’t have to be the actual width of the detail component.
Using Formulas to Perform Math
In the example of the imperial brick, you have a distance of 2-2/3″ or 2-171/256″ vertically between 
bricks stacked in a wall. Because there are three brick courses in every 8″ (225 mm is standard 
in the UK), you don’t need to know the exact distance between each brick—you can use Revit  
to calculate that value. Revit is formula driven, so you can enter = 8″/3 in the Spacing ﬁeld and 
it will calculate the distance for you, similar to using a formula in Microsoft Excel.
Detail Rotation  This option allows you to rotate the detail component in the repeating 
detail.
In the c17-Sample-Building.rvt (c17-Sample-Metric.rvt) ﬁle, we have already created 
a repeating detail to illustrate brick and mortar coursing. At the base of the exterior wall, you 
will see that a portion of the modeled wall assembly already contains a layer assigned with a 
brick material; however, individual brick courses are not shown. Let’s embellish the view with a 
repeating detail component to better communicate the design intent.

752 | CHAPTER 17 DETAILING YOUR DESIGN 
1. Zoom closer to the bottom portion of the detail view, at the base of the exterior wall. From 
the Annotate tab in the ribbon, locate the Detail panel, and click Component ➢ Repeating 
Detail Component.
2. From the Type Selector, choose the Brick repeating detail type. Starting at the bottom 
of the inside face of the brick layer, draw a line up to the bottom of the window sill, as 
shown in Figure 17.21.
Figure 17.21 
Te brick repeating 
detail component 
applied to the view
If the last brick detail does not appear at the top of the sketched line, you can either drag 
the line farther up or edit the type properties of the repeating detail family and toggle 
the Inside parameter.
3. Press the Esc key or click the Modify button to exit the Repeating Detail Component 
command. Select the corrugated metal wall tie components you placed in the Detail 
Components exercise. Hold down the Ctrl key while clicking each component.
4. From the Arrange panel in the contextual tab of the ribbon, click Bring To Front. If nec-
essary, you can use the arrow keys on the keyboard to nudge the wall tie components 
so that they display in proper relation to the mortar lines of the repeating brick detail 
(Figure 17.22).
Although this detail still needs annotations before you can think about placing it onto a 
sheet, you can begin to see how you have used the 3D geometry of the model and were able 
to quickly add some embellishment to it to create a working project detail. For now, save this 
detail. You’ll return to it later in the chapter.

DETAILING TOOLS | 753
Using Line-Based Detail Components
Although there isn’t a command dedicated to line-based detail components, this category of 2D 
elements can be quite powerful. As their name suggests, line-based detail components are  
2D elements that behave like lines. Some examples of building elements you can illustrate with 
these components include waterprooﬁng, gypsum board, plywood, and even repeating ele-
ments such as brick. Why would you use a line-based detail component for brick instead of a 
repeating detail component as we previously discussed? You can tag and schedule a line-based 
detail component. You can use any modifying commands on line-based detail components such 
as Trim, Extend, and Align.
In the default content library you will ﬁnd components in the Detail Items folder such as 
Gypsum Wallboard, Rigid Insulation, and Drainage Board. Start the Detail Component com-
mand, click Load From Library, and load a few of these families. In a detail view, practice draw-
ing these elements to embellish the modeled design further.
Drafting Insulation
The best way to think of the Insulation tool is as a premade repeating detail. You’ll ﬁnd this tool 
on the Detail panel of the Annotate tab.
Selecting this tool allows you to draw a line of batt insulation, much like a repeating detail. 
Figure 17.23 shows a typical line of insulation.
Figure 17.22 
Adjust the draw order 
and position of previ-
ously placed detail 
components.

754 | CHAPTER 17 DETAILING YOUR DESIGN 
When selecting the Insulation tool, you can modify the width of the inserted insulation 
from the Options bar or the Properties palette. In the Properties palette, you can also control 
the Insulation Bulge To Width ratio, which adjusts the amount of curve in the insulation. The 
default value is 2.0. By default, insulation is inserted using the centerline of the line of batt, but 
you can control the offset in the Options bar once the tool is activated. You can also modify the 
width either before or after inserting insulation into your view.
Let’s continue to embellish the wall section view in the c17-Sample-Building.rvt 
(c17-Sample-Metric.rvt) ﬁle. Follow these steps to begin adding insulation detail components:
1. From the Annotate tab in the ribbon, click the Insulation tool. In the Options bar, set the 
Width value to 5″ (150 mm) and the Offset to 0″ To Center.
You can customize the Offset value depending on how you would like to sketch the insu-
lation by drawing the line representing the center of the insulation or either edge.
2. Within the wall assembly, hover the mouse pointer at the midpoint of one of the nominal 
wood framing detail components you placed previously in this chapter. Use the midpoint 
snaps of the framing components to set the start point and endpoint of the insulation 
component.
3. Continue to add insulation components in the remaining wall, ﬂoor, and roof structure 
layers in the detail view.
Figure 17.24 shows a sample of the result.

DETAILING TOOLS | 755
Creating Detail Groups
Detail groups are similar to blocks in AutoCAD and are a quick alternative to creating detail 
component families. They are collections of 2D graphics and can contain detail lines, detail com-
ponents, or any other 2D elements. You will probably want to use a detail component to create 
something like wood blocking; however, if you plan to have the same conﬁgurations of wood 
blocking in multiple locations, you can then group those conﬁgurations and quickly replicate 
them in other details. As with blocks in AutoCAD, manipulating one of the detail groups will 
change all of them consistently.
There are two ways to make a detail group. The more common one is to create the detail 
elements you’d like to group, select all of them, and then click the Create Group button in the 
Create tab of the contextual tab of the ribbon. When you’re prompted for a group name, use a 
naming convention that will help you organize and recognize the contents of each group rather 
than accept the default name (Group 1, Group 2, and so on).
The other way to create a detail group is by clicking the Create Group button in the Detail 
Group ﬂyout on the Annotate tab (Figure 17.25). You will then be prompted for the type of group 
(Model or Detail) and a group name before you can select any elements for the group. If you are 
working in a drafting view, you can only create a detail group; the Model option is inactive in 
this case.
Figure 17.25 
Click the Create 
Group button on the 
Annotate tab and then 
select the elements.
After deﬁning a group name, you’ll be taken into Edit Group mode. Your view will have a 
yellow transparency overlaid on top of it, and elements within the view will appear gray. To 
add elements to the group, click the Add button in the Edit Group panel (Figure 17.26). Here you 
can also remove unwanted elements from your group. When you ﬁnish, simply click the green 
Finish check mark.
Figure 17.26 
Te Edit Group panel
You can place any group you’ve already made using the Place Detail Group button from the 
Detail panel of the Annotate tab (Figure 17.27) and selecting the group from the Type Selector. 
You can also drag and drop any group from the Project Browser into the active view.

Adding Detail Components to Families
In this chapter, you have read about the number of ways you can embellish a 3D model with 
2D detailing. We have discussed how to add detail elements as needed in the project environ-
ment, but you can also include 2D elements inside families. The possibilities for this method are 
almost limitless. You can add any kind of symbolic line to 3D families, but in this section we 
will focus on nesting a detail component in a proﬁle family, which will then become the basis 
for the curtain wall mullions in the sample project.
A more detailed review of curtain wall modeling is provided in Chapter 13, “Creating Walls 
and Curtain Walls.” For now, we will simply edit the mullions already provided in the sample 
building project to add some 2D detailing. Let’s get started by following these steps:
1. Continue working with the c17-Sample-Building.rvt or c17-Sample-Metric.rvt ﬁle 
you downloaded from this book’s web page. In the Project Browser, locate and activate 
the section view named Section At Curtain Wall. It is located under the Sections (Wall 
Section) branch of the Project Browser.
2. In the Project Browser, expand the Families branch, locate and expand the Proﬁles 
branch, and then right-click Pr-Mullion-Horizontal or M_Pr-Mullion-Horizontal. Choose 
Edit from the context menu, and the mullion proﬁle family will open.
The basic reference planes and proﬁle lines have already been created.
You should already have downloaded the RFA ﬁles included with this chapter’s exercise 
ﬁles. Among them are a series of detail components that represent the internal extrusion 
details of the mullions in the sample project’s curtain wall system.
3. From the Create tab in the ribbon, click the Detail Component command. Browse to the 
location where you downloaded this chapter’s exercise ﬁles and load the ﬁle named 
Kawneer-1600-Sys1-Horizontal.rfa or M_Kawneer-1600-Sys1-Horizontal.rfa.
4. Place the detail component to ﬁt exactly within the proﬁle boundary.
You may need to rotate the component before placing it by pressing the spacebar. The 
result should look like the image in Figure 17.28.
5. Click the Modify button and then select the detail component you just placed in the view. 
From the contextual tab in the ribbon, click Visibility Settings. In the Family Element 
Visibility Settings dialog box, uncheck the Coarse and Medium settings. The only setting 
that should be checked is Fine. Click OK to close the dialog box.
6. Click the Load Into Project button from the ribbon and load the revised proﬁle family 
into the sample building project ﬁle. When prompted, select the option to override the 
existing version.
7. From the View tab in the ribbon, locate the Create panel and click Callout ➢ Rectangle. In 
the middle portion of the wall section, sketch a rectangle around the mullion near the top 
of the ﬂoor associated with Level 2, as shown in Figure 17.29.
Detail Components and Project Templates
If you ﬁnd you are inserting the same detail components over and over again, load them into your 
project templates and make them readily available when you begin any new project.

8. Double-click the callout head to activate the callout view. In the Properties palette or the 
view control bar, change View Scale to 3″=1′-0″ (1:5) and set Detail Level to Fine.
After you have made these changes, you will see the nested detail component appear in 
the curtain wall mullion, as shown in Figure 17.30.

9. Repeat the steps in this exercise for the head and sill mullion families. Edit the proﬁle 
families listed here (starts with Pr-Mullion) with the associated detail components (RFA 
ﬁles) or their metric equivalents:
Pr-Mullion-Head > Kawneer-1600-Sys1-Head.rfa
Pr-Mullion-Sill > Kawneer-1600-Sys1-Sill.rfa

758 | CHAPTER 17 DETAILING YOUR DESIGN 
The detail components we used for this sample exercise were excerpted from real manufac-
turer’s content that is available for free from the Kawneer website (www.kawneer.com). Complete 
curtain wall system components for Revit are also available from the website.
You might have noticed that the curtain wall modeled in this chapter’s sample building is 
somewhat simpliﬁed. For example, the portion of the glass panels inside the mullions is not 
modeled; however, this condition appears in the detail component once you get down to a ﬁne 
level of detail. This exercise illustrates a hybrid approach to the balance between modeling and 
detailing. If you download one of the Revit models from the Kawneer website (one sample, 
ASCMDDH3a.dwg, is provided with this chapter’s downloaded content), you will see that the glass 
panels are more accurately modeled to include the mullion bite (Figure 17.31). In that scenario, 
you would not need to include masking regions to simulate the glass panel in the mullion detail 
component.
Figure 17.31 
More detailed model-
ing will require less 
detailing.
Learning Efficient Detailing
As you get more practice creating details in Revit, you’ll ﬁnd certain workﬂows support more ﬂex-
ibility and speed. Here are some tips to keep in mind when creating your details:
 
◆
If your modeling is reasonably detailed to begin with, the detailing will go much faster 
because you will need to add fewer components. However, you must strike a balance and 
not make an overly detailed model because that would negatively impact performance. 

REUSING DETAILS FROM OTHER FILES | 759
Reusing Details from Other Files
As you develop details of common building features, you will likely ﬁnd the need to reuse this 
content in future projects. You might even have an existing library of details that were created in 
a CAD application. In either situation, there are tools and commands available in Revit software 
that allow you to maximize the usage of the material you produce over time.
Using CAD Details
It is quite common to have details that were originally created in a CAD program. Sometimes 
these are details taken from a manufacturer’s website, and sometimes they can be details drawn 
in other projects or from an ofﬁce library, and you simply want to reuse them in your project 
rather than re-create them. Regardless of where they originated, you have the ability to work 
with 2D detail elements and import or link them into the model for use in your project.
In Chapter 7, “Interoperability: Working Multiplatform,” we provide detailed guidance on 
using linked DWG ﬁles for the basis of project details.
When wondering what to model or what to make into a detail component, ask yourself the 
following questions:
 
◆
Will I see or use this in other views in the project?
 
◆
Will it aﬀect other aspects of the project (like material takeoﬀs)?
 
◆
How large is it? (Our oﬃce tends to use 2D detailing for details 1 1/2″ (40 mm) and smaller.)
 
◆
Tere is no limit to how much information you can place in a detail component. If you will be 
seeing similar conditions throughout the model, put in as much as you can.
 
◆
You can use detail components at every scale within the model, so it is a great way to draw the 
information only once.
If the lines describing small components seem to merge when printed, there’s little point in showing 
that geometry at that scale. You might consider making the model simpler.
Tips on Importing CAD Details
At times in the project, your workﬂow will necessitate using 2D information from a past project, 
a manufacturer’s library, or another resource in your current Revit project. To optimize the per-
formance of your imported CAD ﬁles within your model, we recommend that you take some steps 
to prepare the CAD ﬁle before import. Here are some general tips to help your import process:
 
◆
If the ﬁle you’d like to import contains hatches or annotations, delete them before importing 
and use ﬁlled regions and the Revit Text or Keynote tool for annotations. Tis will help keep

Using Details from Other Revit Projects
As we begin to discuss the reuse of detailing content, we must return to the three methodolo-
gies introduced at the beginning of this chapter—stand-alone detailing, hybrid detailing, and 
model detailing. As you approach a project with more detailed modeling, you will reduce the 
amount of drafting needed in the project environment; however, you will be less able to reuse 
content as standard details or detail templates. This is because the best way to reuse 2D content 
is with drafting views.
your graphics consistent (in the case of hatch) and allow you to edit the verbiage and location 
of any notes.
 
◆
Import only one detail at a time so you can take better advantage of the software’s ability to 
manage sheet referencing. If you have a series of details organized in a single CAD ﬁle that 
you want to use in documenting your project, isolate each detail, save it as a separate ﬁle, and 
then import it.
 
◆
Make sure you import the CAD details using the proper line weights, colors, and styles. Check 
your CAD ﬁle before importing into your Revit project to make sure it is consistent with your 
oﬃce’s standards.
 
◆
If the imported geometry is something you really want or need to edit, it’s better for your model 
and overall ﬁle size to import the CAD ﬁle into a detail component (if it’s 2D) and explode it 
and edit it in the Family Editor. Tis way, when you import it into your project ﬁle, it is still a 
single object rather than thousands.
 
◆
Revit software doesn’t allow line segments shorter than 1/32″ (0.8 mm). Although this is 
seemingly a very small line, many manufacturer details have small segment lines in them. 
When CAD details are exploded, those short lines will be deleted and can leave your linework 
looking incomplete.
For additional tips on leveraging CAD data, refer to Appendix B, “Tips, Tricks, and Troubleshooting.”
There’s an App for That
If you have many details in DWG format that you would like to quickly import to a project ﬁle, 
a few add-ins are available to automate the process. One example is the Detail Link tool that is 
part of the Revit Express Tools suite that Cad Technology Center developed. Tis tool allows you 
to select multiple DWG ﬁles and import each one to its own drafting view in Revit. You can learn 
more about the Detail Link tool at www.cadtechnologycenter.com and at the Autodesk Apps 
Exchange (http://apps.exchange.autodesk.com).

REUSING DETAILS FROM OTHER FILES | 761
Saving a Single Detail
If you are working in a detail view of the model or a drafting view, you can save all the 2D ele-
ments to an external ﬁle for reuse in other Revit projects. In the case of a single 2D detail, it can 
be quick work to get the ﬁle from one project to the next.
1. Open the ﬁle with the detail you’d like to collect, and activate the view in which this 
detail appears. Select all the 2D geometry and annotation within the drafting view, and 
create a group using the Create Group button on the contextual tab of the ribbon.
Note that if you are in a callout or detail view in which model elements are displayed, 
two groups will be created—a model group and a detail group.
2. Give the group a name, making sure the name is unique enough not to overlap with any 
view names in your current project or the project you’re going to import into.
3. With the detail grouped and named, expand the Groups node in the Project Browser. 
Now, expand the Detail Group node and ﬁnd the group you just created. Right-click the 
group and choose Save Group from the context menu.
4. As part of the Save As process, you’ll get the Save Group dialog box (Figure 17.32). This 
will allow you to create a separate RVT ﬁle for your group—basically a stand-alone proj-
ect ﬁle. Save the group in a location where you’ll be able to ﬁnd it again and close your 
project ﬁle. There’s no need to name the group because the new ﬁle will reﬂect the  
group name.

dialog box

762 | CHAPTER 17 DETAILING YOUR DESIGN 
We have created a sample ﬁle using this method for use in the remainder of this exercise. 
Make sure you download the ﬁle c17_JambDetail.rvt from the book’s companion 
web page.
5. Continue with the sample building project ﬁle saved from the previous exercises in this 
chapter.
6. From the View tab, click Drafting View to create a new view, and name it JAMB DTL.
The scale does not matter because it will inherit the scale of the imported detail.
7. From the Insert tab of the ribbon, choose Insert From File and then Insert 2D Elements 
From File.
8. In the Open dialog box, navigate to and select the c17_JambDetail.rvt file and then 
click Open. You will then see the Insert 2D Elements dialog box, which is shown in 
Figure 17.33. Highlight Drafting View: JAMB DTL from the list box, and select the 
Transfer View Scale check box. Click OK to close the dialog box and begin  
the import.

REUSING DETAILS FROM OTHER FILES | 763
Saving Multiple Details
As you create more details in Revit projects, you will inevitably want to save some of them to an 
ofﬁce library or some sort of localized resource so you can quickly locate the good ones again. 
Revit allows you to selectively save multiple views from a single project into a separate, stand-
alone ﬁle. This workﬂow will work for both 2D and 3D content.
A quick way to get any view with 2D elements isolated to an external ﬁle is to right-click the 
view in the Project Browser and choose Save To New File from the context menu. Note that this 
option is not available for any view that does not contain 2D detail elements. It might take the 
software a few moments to compile the view content, but you will be presented with a dialog 
box asking you to locate the new ﬁle. Once the view is exported, it functions like any other RVT 
ﬁle. You can open these new views directly and edit or manipulate any of the content or ele-
ments within the ﬁle. You’ll also see a streamlined version of the Project Browser having only 
the nodes that relate to the content you’ve exported.
Another way to export multiple views is to click the Application menu and choose Save As ➢ 
Library ➢ View. This command allows you to save multiple views into a single RVT ﬁle that acts 
as a library for those views. Here are the steps:
1. Start by opening the ﬁle with the views you want to save. Open the Application menu by 
clicking the Revit tab, and select Save As ➢ Library ➢ View.
2. This will give you the Save Views dialog box (Figure 17.34). It will show a list of view 
names on the left and a preview window on the right. Select the check box for each of the 
views you want to save into a separate ﬁle. Once you have all your view names estab-
lished, click OK.
Figure 17.34 
Exporting multiple 
views to a separate ﬁle

764 | CHAPTER 17 DETAILING YOUR DESIGN 
The software might take a few moments to export the views, depending on how many you’ve 
chosen and how large the overall ﬁle size is. Once the process is complete, you’ll have a sepa-
rate ﬁle to import those views back into Revit projects. This import process is just as simple as 
exporting. Here’s how to import the views:
1. Open the project where you want to put the imported views. From the Insert tab on the 
ribbon, choose Insert From File and then Insert Views From File.
2. The new dialog box will look similar to the Save Views dialog box. You will have a list of 
the views you can import from the column on the left and a preview of those views on the 
right. Select the box for the views you want to import, and click OK (Figure 17.35).
Figure 17.35 
Importing multiple 
views into a project
You can also import entire sheets of details using this method. If sheets exist in the ﬁle you 
have selected with the Insert Views From File command, they are listed as options to insert. 
When sheets are inserted, the details placed on each sheet are automatically imported into the 
project as well.
Te Bottom Line
Create details.  Details in Revit are a combination of 2D elements layered on top of 3D 
model elements or sometimes just stacked on top of each other. Creating good, easy-to-read 
details typically requires some embellishment of the 3D model.
Master It  What are the three primary categories of detail elements, and how are they used?

THE BOTTOM LINE | 765
Add detail components to families.  You can make creating details in Revit easier by 
adding some of the detail elements directly to the family. In this way, when you cut sec-
tions, make callouts, or enlarge plan conditions, your “smart” details can begin to construct 
themselves.
Master It  Because you don’t always want elements to appear in every scale of a view, 
how can you both add detail elements to your families and still limit the amount of infor-
mation that is shown in any given view?
Learn efﬁcient detailing.  As you master detailing in Revit, you’ll begin to learn tips and 
tricks to make your process of creating details more efﬁcient.
Master It  To help you assess how much effort you should be putting into your details, 
what are three questions you should be asking yourself before starting any detail?
Reuse details from other ﬁles.  In many project workﬂows, you will need to incorporate 
details from other projects. Reusing these details can aid in the speed and efﬁciency of proj-
ect documentation.
Master It  There are several ways to reuse details from other projects. Name one and 
list the steps to perform the tasks necessary to quickly move a detail from one project to 
another.

 Chapter  18 
 Documenting Your Design 
 While the industry continues to move toward a 3D building information model as a construc-
tion deliverable, today we still need to produce 2D documents for a construction document set 
or design reviews. Using the integrated documentation tools in Autodesk ®  Revit ® software, you 
can create these sets with more accuracy and reliability than in the past. In this chapter, you will 
take the elements you have previously modeled and detailed and begin to create the documen-
tation for your design. 
 In this chapter, you’ll learn to 
 
◆
Document plans 
 
◆
Create schedules and legends 
 
◆
Lay out sheets 
 Documenting Plans 
 In this chapter, we’ll introduce a scenario that will mimic what might happen on a real 
project in a preliminary design phase. We are going to assume that you’ll be using the 
c18-Sample-Building-Start.rvt or  c18-Sample-Metric-Start.rvt model from the book’s 
web page:  www.sybex.com/go/masteringrevit2018 . 
 Here’s the story: you have recently completed some preliminary design work in advance of 
your upcoming client meeting. You’ll need to lay out the plans, elevations, and perspectives on 
some presentation sheets for the meeting, but you’ll also have to include some building metrics, 
such as area plans and schedules of overall spaces. 
 In the following sections, you’ll set up those views and sheets, starting with the area plans. 
For the purposes of program veriﬁ cation, you have decided you need to establish the spatial 
areas for the building so the client can get some preliminary pricing from the contractor. Before 
you create your area plans, we’ll discuss some of the various ways you can calculate areas in 
Revit.  
 Calculating Space Using Room Objects 
 The simplest way to calculate the space in a building design is to use room objects. Room tags 
can be used to report room name, department, area, and any of the other properties of a room. 
These properties can also be scheduled to report the total area of all rooms within a design. With 
rooms, however, the areas that they report are limited to how those spaces are deﬁ ned. With the 
c18-Sample-Building-Start.rvt  or  c18-Sample-Metric-Start.rvt model open, choose the

Architecture tab; then access the expanded panel under the Room & Area panel. Click Area And 
Volume Computations, which opens the Area And Volume Computations dialog box. You will 
see the options for room area computation in the project. The choices are as follows:
 
◆
At Wall Finish
 
◆
At Wall Center
 
◆
At Wall Core Layer
 
◆
At Wall Core Center
Because each of these settings affects the entire project, a level of consistency is ensured for 
room calculations; however, the global nature of the settings makes it difﬁcult to use the room 
objects for gross area calculations. Room calculations can give you an accurate net area—or 
carpet area—that refers to the area between the ﬁnished wall surfaces considered as occupied 
space. This value can also be reported in the room tag or in a schedule by selecting the ﬁrst 
choice under the Room Area Computation settings, At Wall Finish, in the Area And Volume 
Computations dialog box (Figure 18.1). Select this option and click OK. Please note that should 
you instead choose the Areas And Volumes option, Revit will also calculate the room volume, 
which will impact performance for larger project ﬁles.
Figure 18.1

Computations

Let’s see how this looks in the ﬂoor plans. Activate the Level 2 ﬂoor plan. In this view, we 
have already established the rooms and added room tags; however, the tags do not show the 
room areas. To modify this setting, follow these steps:
1. Select any of the room tags, and from the Properties palette, choose Edit Type.
2. In the Type Properties dialog box, select the Show Area check box. Click OK to exit the 
dialog box.

DOCUMENTING PLANS | 769
Now you should see the areas reﬂected in the room tags, as shown in Figure 18.2. This is 
because the Show Area setting was created as a Yes/No type parameter assigned to the vis-
ibility property of the area label within the room tag family. If you want to explore this func-
tionality further, you can open the tag family. Select the room tag and click Edit Family in the 
contextual tab of the ribbon.

Objective
Figure 18.2 
Room area reﬂected in 
the room tag
If you select any one of the room tags, you can also see the area that it is calculating dis-
played with a red outline (Figure 18.3). When adding rooms, you are not limited to only 
rooms that are bound on all sides with walls. If you note the lounge and lobby spaces on 
Level 1, shown in Figure 18.3, there isn’t a wall dividing the two rooms, yet they are shown as 
being independent of each other. This separation is achieved by using room separation lines, 
which can be placed with the Room Separator tool located on the Room & Area panel of the 
Architecture tab. Note that these lines will print and export with other model and annotation 
elements, but you can adjust their visibility in the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box. 
If you decide to change the visibility of the room separator lines and turn them off within 
a view, they will continue to divide the room objects. You will ﬁnd these elements in the 
Visibility/Graphic dialog box on the Model Elements tab, under Lines, <Room Separation>.
Because area calculations using rooms don’t usually include wall thicknesses, let’s look at 
another way to calculate areas—using area plans.
Working with Rooms and Areas
Rooms and areas are the two object types you will use to annotate and report the occupied space 
within your building designs. You can use room tags and area tags to visualize data such as a room 
name or number, but the tags merely report the data that exists in the object itself. So, how do you 
work with objects that have no solid geometry?
Both rooms and areas have a reference that can be seen if you hover the mouse pointer within a 
space. Sometimes these references can be diﬃcult to ﬁnd, but there is something you can do to 
improve your eﬃciency when working with these objects. In the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog 
box, locate Areas or Rooms in the Model Categories tab. Expand the category for either object and 
you will see Interior Fill and Reference. Tese subcategories are turned oﬀ by default, but you can 
turn them on if you will be frequently editing these objects.

770 | CHAPTER 18 DOCUMENTING YOUR DESIGN
Creating Area Plans
Area plans are views of the model used to calculate deﬁned, two-dimensional spaces within the 
model according to prescribed calculation standards but with the added ability to customize 
the area boundaries. The software allows you to create as many area calculation schemes as you 
need to depict the design. Area boundaries can exist only in area plans and can be either manu-
ally placed or automatically associated with walls. If they are automatically placed, the areas 
within them will be calculated based on the BOMA standard.
BOMA Area Calculations
BOMA stands for the Building Owners and Managers Association. Widely used in the United States 
by architects, developers, and facility managers alike, it was created to help standardize building 
development and spatial needs. BOMA uses its own set of standards for calculating areas that 
have some nuances relating to exactly where the area boundaries between spaces fall, depending 
on the Area Type property. You can ﬁnd more information on BOMA standards at www.boma.org.
Figure 18.3 
Te room object shows 
what area is being 
calculated.
The default project template includes some predeﬁned areas. To add to the list of available 
area schemes, access the expanded Room & Area panel in the Architecture tab of the ribbon, 
and then click Area And Volume Computations.

Name ﬁeld of the new row and rename the scheme Usable Area (Figure 18.5). Click OK to close 
the Area And Volume Computations dialog box.
Figure 18.5 
Create a new area 
scheme.
When the Area And Volume Computations dialog box opens, choose the Area Schemes tab, 
shown in Figure 18.4. Here you can add as many new area schemes as your design requires. For 
each area scheme, you can create associated plans, schedules, and area boundary layouts; how-
ever, be careful not to add too many superﬂuous area schemes on larger projects because doing 
so can degrade performance and increase ﬁle size.
To continue the exercise, you will need to create area plans for your presentation. You can 
create an area plan from either of two locations: one is located on the Room & Area panel of the 
Architecture tab; the other is located on the Create panel of the View tab. Follow these steps:
1. From the Architecture tab in the ribbon, ﬁnd the Room & Area panel, click Area, and 
then click Area Plan. You are prompted with the New Area Plan dialog box, shown in 
Figure 18.6.

plans
2. From the Type drop-down menu, choose Usable Area. While pressing the Ctrl key, select 
both Level 1 and Level 2.
3. Click OK. You are prompted with the option to automatically generate area boundaries 
for exterior walls. Because you selected more than one level, you will receive a prompt 
for each level for which a plan is being generated. Go ahead and click Yes to generate the 
plans automatically.
This creates new area plans under a new node in the Project Browser: Area Plans (Usable 
Area). The name in the parentheses will always be associated to the area calculation type 
you used.
4. In the Project Browser, select both Level 1 and Level 2 under Area Plans (Usable Area). 
Right-click and select Apply View Template from the context menu.
5. In the Apply View Template dialog box, choose Area Plan from the list of view templates, 
click OK to apply the template, and close the dialog box.
Note that this method applies the template properties to the views, but it does not associ-
ate the template with the views. To permanently assign the view template to the views, 
edit the View Template parameter in the Properties palette.
View references, furniture, and ﬂoor patterns are turned off based on the settings deﬁned 
in the view template (Figure 18.7). For more detailed information on using view tem-
plates, refer to Chapter 4, “Conﬁguring Templates and Standards.”
When looking at the area plan on your screen, you’ll notice a thick, purple line running 
around the inside face of the exterior wall. This is the Area Boundary line. Note that we 
have changed the default properties of the Area Boundary line type in the ﬁgures within this 
project for clarity. The software has attempted to calculate your plan area based on some 
predeﬁned rules. For the most part, it does a reasonable job of ﬁguring out where the 
boundaries are, but from time to time those lines need some adjusting. You will learn 
over time whether this automation works based on the complexity of the perimeter walls 
in your designs. If they are complex and not clearly closed, the results of the automated 
boundary placement may be undesirable.

Area boundaries have 
been automatically 
assigned to the exte-
rior walls.
In the Project Browser, ﬁnd the node Area Plans (Gross Building) and open either of the 
plans. Notice the difference in the application of the area boundaries to the exterior walls. 
The area boundaries are applied to the outside faces of the exterior walls. In the Usable 
Area plans (Figure 18.7), the boundaries are assigned to the inside faces of the exterior 
walls—also adapting to window elements.
To complete this part of the exercise, you will place additional area boundaries to subdi-
vide the interior space into different spaces.
6. Activate the Level 1 area plan for Usable Area. From the Architecture tab, select the Room 
& Area panel; click Area Boundary.
The default drawing method is set to Pick, and in the Options bar, the Apply Area Rules 
setting is checked. Remember that this setting determines whether the location of the 
boundary will be affected by the Area Type property of the areas placed on either side of 
the boundary.
7. Pick the interior walls indicated in Figure 18.8.
8. Activate the Level 2 area plan for Usable Area, and using the same method as in Level 1, 
add area boundaries to the interior walls indicated in Figure 18.9. You will need to use the 
Trim tool to adjust the line for the wall at the end of the corridor.

Adding Area Objects
Like room objects, areas need a closed boundary in order to be placed, and they have proper-
ties to which you can add attributes that are “taggable.” You can have any number of areas 
visible in an area plan, but unlike rooms, areas can be seen and tagged only in area plans. In 
this section’s exercise, you will place area objects within the boundaries you created in the pre-
vious exercise:
1. On the Room & Area panel on the Architecture tab, choose the Area tool.
The Area tool places an area in a manner similar to placing a room, and it gives you a 
bound area with a large X in it (Figure 18.10). The area of the space bound by the purple 
boundary lines will be reported as part of the area tag.
Figure 18.10 
Te placed area ele-
ment with area tag
2. Place areas in each of the zones deﬁned by the boundary lines in the Level 1 ﬂoor plan 
for Usable Area. To modify the names of the areas, you can select the area object and then 
modify the name in the Properties palette, or you can select the area tag, click the name, 
and then type the new value. Change the names of the areas to OFFICES, LOBBY, and 
SERVICES, as shown in Figure 18.11.

776 | CHAPTER 18 DOCUMENTING YOUR DESIGN
Deleting Areas
As you complete this exercise, you may accidentally place an area outside the boundaries of the 
design, or you may place two areas within the same space. First, realize that you must delete the 
area, not just the area tag, to remove the area element; however, the area actually remains in your 
project. You are prompted with a warning as shown here:
Figure 18.11 
Rename the areas 
placed on Level 1.
3. Select the OFFICES area (not the tag), and in the Properties palette, change the Area Type 
property to Ofﬁce Area. Select the SERVICES area and change its Area Type property to 
Building Common Area.
Notice that some of the area boundaries change to different wall faces as the Area Type 
property is modiﬁed. This behavior is based on the BOMA area measurement standards 
and is dependent on either allowing Revit to automatically assign area boundaries or 
using the Apply Area Rules option when you are placing the boundaries yourself.
Rooms are not visible in the area plans, based on the settings in the view templates pro-
vided in the sample project. If you do not turn off the visibility of rooms in area plans, 
you may mistakenly select a room object instead of an area. Always be sure to check the 
Type Selector to verify that you have selected an area or a room.

DOCUMENTING PLANS | 777
4. The next step in our area plan is to follow steps similar to those for Level 1. Activate the  
Level 2 area plan for Usable Area, and place areas in the zones deﬁned by the area boundaries.
5. Rename the areas OFFICES, CIRCULATION, and SERVICES, as shown in Figure 18.12.
Figure 18.12 
Rename the areas 
placed on Level 2.
To completely remove an area from your project, you must remove it from an area schedule. Te 
Area and Level properties of deleted areas are shown in a schedule as Not Placed. You can pick these 
rows in a schedule and choose Delete from the Rows panel of the ribbon.
6. Select the OFFICES area, and change the Area Type property to Ofﬁce Area. Select the 
CIRCULATION area, and change Area Type to Major Vertical Penetration. Select the 
SERVICES area, and change the Area Type to Building Common Area.
7. Select the area tag for SERVICES, and from the Options bar, activate the Leader setting. 
This will allow you to move the tag away from the area object without generating a warn-
ing. With the SERVICES area tag still selected, move it outside the area boundary lines 
and adjust the leader line as necessary.
Modifying Area Plans
Like rooms, areas can be modiﬁed at any time during the design process. They will be adjusted 
automatically if the boundary lines are locked to a wall or other element that has been moved as 
part of the design, or they can be modiﬁed manually.
If you delete an area line, you’ll get the warning message shown in Figure 18.13. This mes-
sage tells you that you have removed one or more of the boundary lines for an area and the soft-
ware can no longer calculate the area.

778 | CHAPTER 18 DOCUMENTING YOUR DESIGN
Working with Area Plans on Large Projects
On a large project where our client was a government agency, our team was required to create 
many diﬀerent area schemes to comply with the documentation deliverables. Tese area schemes 
included gross ﬂoor area, rentable area, and individual department areas. Because the project was 
so large in overall area and number of spaces, performance of our Revit project ﬁle was suﬀering 
because the software was simultaneously analyzing the parametric relationships between all the 
physical building elements while maintaining all the calculations in our area plans for each of the 
area schemes.
To alleviate some of the degraded performance, we decided to create a separate project ﬁle into 
which we linked our architectural model. In this ﬁle, we re-created the required area schemes, 
area objects, and area plans. Even the sheets dedicated to the area calculations were created in 
this project ﬁle.
Although this approach improved the performance of the main architectural model, there were 
some limitations. Te main limitation was that we could not use the Pick Walls method to assign 
the area boundaries to the walls in the linked model. Tus, the Apply Area Rules option did not 
function, which required us to manage the area boundaries manually in relation to their associ-
ated walls.
If you decide to pursue this method of working with area plans on large projects, consider the work 
involved against the beneﬁts gained in performance before you decide to implement it.
Figure 18.13 
Modifying an area 
boundary generates a 
warning.
If you are in the midst of modifying a space, ﬁnish your modiﬁcations and replace any area 
lines that you’ve deleted or removed as part of the design change. Once the area is completely 
bound, it will recalculate the space.
In this section, you’ve created an area plan that will give you a graphic representation of the 
space you’ve deﬁned with boundary lines. But what if you want to show this same information 
in a spreadsheet format? All you need to do is set up a view type in the model that allows you to 
look at the same information in a tabular format. For this, you can use a schedule.
Creating Schedules and Legends
Schedules are lists of elements and element properties within the model. They itemize building 
objects such as walls, doors, and windows as well as calculate quantities, areas, and volumes. 
They can also list document elements such as sheets, keynotes, and views. Schedules are yet 
another live way to view a Revit model. Once created, they are constantly kept up to date with 
any changes that occur to the model itself.

Objective

CREATING SCHEDULES AND LEGENDS | 779
Legends are views in which you can display building components or annotations used in your 
model without affecting quantity schedules of the actual project model. Legends can be created 
for displaying information such as door types, wall types, key plans, or general notes. Legends 
and schedules are unique in their behavior as a view because they are the only views that can be 
placed on multiple sheets.
Creating Schedules
In a project workﬂow, creating schedules of objects, areas, or quantities is usually one of the 
most laborious tasks for architects. When this process is performed manually, it can take a very 
long time and typically results in errors that require validation of the design data.
In Revit, all building elements have information about their properties deﬁned within the 
model. You also have the option to include additional information with any element. For example, 
doors have properties such as size, material, ﬁre rating, cost, and so on. All of this information can 
be scheduled and quantiﬁed. Because the schedule is a live tabular view of the element within the 
model, modifying values in a schedule changes the element in the model, and vice versa.
There are several types of schedules, all of which you can access from the Create panel of the 
View tab. You can also create schedules by right-clicking the Schedules/Quantities node in the 
Project Browser. You can create six primary types of schedules.
Schedule/Quantities  As the most commonly used schedule type, this schedule allows you 
to list and quantify all element category types. You would use this type to create tabular 
views for doors, walls, windows, areas, rooms, and so on.
Graphical Column Schedule  This type of schedule can graphically show the structural 
columns in the project and their attributes.
Material Takeoff  This type of schedule can calculate the area or volume of materials across 
any family category. For example, you might want to know the volume of concrete within the 
model. Regardless of whether the concrete is in a wall, ﬂoor, or column, you can conﬁgure 
the schedule to report the total amount of that material in the project.
Sheet List  This schedule allows you to create a list of all the sheets in the project. In addi-
tion to the number and name of the sheet, you can include the current revision number, date, 
and revision description.
Note Block  This type of schedule lists the parameters of generic annotation families that are 
used in your project. These are different from element tags because the values reported in the 
Note Block schedule come from the annotation families, not the model objects. You can also use 
a note block to list the annotation symbols (centerlines, north arrows) used in a project.

780 | CHAPTER 18 DOCUMENTING YOUR DESIGN
View List  This schedule generates a list of all the views in the Project Browser and their 
properties. A view list is useful for managing your project because the schedule is a bidirec-
tional view, which allows you to edit many view properties such as name, scale, and phase.
Each of these schedule types gives you the ability to select related element properties that you 
can mix and match to track elements within the model. When you create a new schedule, you 
must ﬁrst select a category of objects to itemize (Figure 18.14). You can also ﬁlter the schedule 
based on the various disciplines by selecting the Filter List drop-down menu at the upper left.
Figure 18.14 
Creating a new 
schedule
Although the most common schedules are based on a single object category, you can also 
create schedules that span categories. The ﬁrst option in the dialog box in Figure 18.14 is the 
<Multi-Category> schedule. You might want to schedule all the casework, furniture, and furni-
ture systems in a project simultaneously, or all the windows and doors if they are being ordered 
from the same manufacturer. Although this type of schedule allows you to span multiple cat-
egories, many speciﬁc parameters cannot be included. First, it is difﬁcult to isolate just two cat-
egories (such as windows and doors) in a multi-category schedule. Second, you cannot include 
critical parameters in the schedule such as length, width, and height. Another limit of this 
schedule type is that you cannot schedule host elements (walls, ﬂoors, ceilings, and so on), only 
their materials and family components.
Schedule Keys
Tere is a special kind of schedule that gives you the ability to populate a list of values before 
placing any actual objects in your model as well as manage these values from one location. 
Known as a schedule key, it can be selected when you ﬁrst create a schedule. A common example 
of the use of a schedule key is to manage room ﬁnishes. In this use case, you create a schedule 

CREATING SCHEDULES AND LEGENDS | 781
key named Room Finish Type. You add the parameters Floor Finish, Base Finish, Wall Finish, 
and Ceiling Finish to the schedule. In the schedule, use the New Row button to create room 
ﬁnish types. For example, you could create types for Executive Oﬃce, Standard Oﬃce, Service 
Corridor, and Rest Room.
The parameter Room Finish Type will then appear in the element properties of every room 
object. The parameters that are assigned to a schedule key can be edited only in the key 
schedule—not in the room properties. This might seem inconvenient; however, you can man-
age large numbers of objects with common parameters. For example, if the floor finish for all 
the rooms in your project that were assigned as an Executive Office type needed to change 
from carpet to ceramic tile, you would simply change the schedule key and all instances of 
that room type would update.
Creating a Room Schedule
To become familiar with the general functionality of creating a schedule, you will  
create a room schedule. You’re going to continue working in the model, which is the 
c18-Sample-Building-Start.rvt ﬁle or c18-Sample-Metric-Start.rvt ﬁle you opened 
earlier in this chapter. Later in this chapter, you will apply your skills to create an area 
schedule based on the previous exercises.
From the View tab in the ribbon, click Schedules ➢ Schedule/Quantities. In the New 
Schedule dialog box, select Rooms from the list of categories, and click OK to continue. You are 
then presented with the Schedule Properties dialog box. This is the main interface by which you 
set, and later modify, any of the organizational or appearance characteristics of your schedules. 
The dialog box consists of six tabs: Fields, Filter, Sorting/Grouping, Formatting, Appearance, 
and Embedded Schedule. (Note that the Embedded Schedule tab is available only if you select 
either a room or space schedule.) Let’s step through each of these tabs and examine how they 
affect the form and function of the schedule.
Fields  The Fields tab (Figure 18.15) lets you select the data that will appear in your sched-
ule. The list of available ﬁelds on the left will vary based on the category you choose to 
schedule. If you’ve assigned any custom parameters to those categories, they will be avail-
able here as well. Also notice the option Include Elements In Links at the lower-left corner. 
Enabling this option will allow you to schedule across multiple ﬁles, and it can be a great tool 
for larger projects. The order of the ﬁelds you add to the Scheduled Fields list at the right side 
(top to bottom) determines the order of columns in your schedule from left to right.
From the list of available ﬁelds on the left, add Level, Number, Name, and Area to the list of 
scheduled ﬁelds on the right.
Filter  On the Filter tab (Figure 18.16), you can ﬁlter out the data you don’t want to show in 
your schedule. Filters work like common database functions. For example, you can ﬁlter out 
all the sheets in a set whose names don’t begin with the letter A. Or you can ﬁlter a material 
list so that it shows only items containing Concrete. Filters operate only on certain schedule 
ﬁelds. For instance, you can’t apply a ﬁlter to the Family And Type ﬁeld.
Set the ﬁrst group of ﬁlter drop-downs to Filter By: Level: Does Not Equal: Roof 1. Set the sec-
ond group of ﬁlter drop-downs to Filter By: Level: Does Not Equal: Roof 2.

Te Fields tab
Sorting/Grouping  The Sorting/Grouping tab (Figure 18.17) lets you control the order in 
which information is displayed and which ﬁelds control that order. For instance, if you are 
creating a sheet index, you can choose to sort by sheet number or sheet name, depending on 
how you’d like the information displayed. You can also decide whether you want to show 
every instance of an item or only a summary of object types by using the Itemize Every 
Instance check box at the bottom.
Figure 18.16 
Te Filter tab

CREATING SCHEDULES AND LEGENDS | 783
In the ﬁrst Sort By options, set the drop-down to Level, select the Header and Footer options, 
and set the Footer drop-down to Count And Totals. In the next Then By options, set the drop-
down to Number.
In the Sorting/Grouping tab, you have the ability to summarize the reported information in 
group footers or as a grand total at the bottom of the schedule; however, you must designate 
one or more ﬁelds to calculate totals in the Formatting tab to display these results.
Formatting  The Formatting tab (Figure 18.18) controls the display for each ﬁeld and 
whether the ﬁeld is visible on the schedule. It also controls other elements of the ﬁeld, such 
as justiﬁcation, display name, and orientation of the header. This tab also allows you to use 
the Calculate Totals check box found within the pull-down menu for use with the footer or 
Grand Totals options in the Sorting/Grouping tab. Note that you may also need to use the 
Calculate Totals option for certain numerical ﬁelds if you intend to deselect the Itemize Every 
Instance option in the Sorting/Grouping tab. For example, if you include the Area property 
of walls and choose not to itemize every instance, the area appears as a blank ﬁeld in the 
schedule unless you check the Calculate Totals option.
The Hidden Field option is also an important feature to help you customize your schedules. 
You can use this option when you need to include a ﬁeld just for ﬁltering or sorting but you 
don’t want to see it in the schedule, such as a custom sorting parameter for drawing sheets. 
You can also select it when you want to use a ﬁeld as the header of a group of elements in a 
schedule. For example, you may include the Family and Type ﬁelds, but you want only the 
family listed as a grouping header because you don’t need to show the family name repeat-
edly in every row of your schedule.
For this exercise, select the Level ﬁeld and then activate the Hidden Field option. Select the 
Area ﬁeld, set Alignment to Right, and then activate the Calculate Totals option.

allows you to change 
unit formats and 
specify ﬁelds in which 
you need to calculate

Appearance  The Appearance tab (Figure 18.19) controls the graphical aspects of the sched-
ule, such as font size and style of text for each of the columns and headers in the schedule. It 
also allows you to turn the schedule grid lines on and off and modify the line thickness for 
the grid and boundary lines. For revision schedules, you can also specify whether the sched-
ule reads from top to bottom or from bottom to top.

For this exercise, select the Outline check box and set the Outline drop-down to Wide Lines.
Embedded Schedule  The Embedded Schedule tab (Figure 18.20) is only an available tab 
when you create a room schedule or a space schedule. The Embedded Schedule tab allows 

CREATING SCHEDULES AND LEGENDS | 785
you to associate another schedule of elements. For example, in your Room Schedule, if you 
were to enable Embedded Schedule and select Furniture, it would correlate Furniture objects 
and properties to their respective room.
The primary use of the Embedded Schedule tab is to create a schedule for spaces and associ-
ate elements from MEP-based systems such as duct systems, piping systems, and electrical 
systems. Though the example of embedding a furniture schedule would be an appropriate 
example, for this exercise, we will leave it to you to experiment further.
Once you’ve worked through each of the tabs in the Schedule Properties dialog box, click 
OK and you will see the working layout of the schedule. The schedule settings can be modiﬁed 
at any time, but this gives you a basis from which to begin. To modify the schedule, you can 
access any tab of the Schedule Properties dialog box from the ﬁve corresponding buttons in the 
Properties palette when the schedule view is active.
A special tab on the ribbon is active when you are editing a schedule. This ribbon is not avail-
able when you select a schedule that has been placed on a sheet but available only in the edit-
ing mode. To edit a schedule on a sheet, you must right-click the schedule and then select Edit 
Schedule from the context menu. The Modify Schedule/Quantities tab shown in Figure 18.21 
has many tools that enable you to modify ﬁeld selection, hide columns, merge cells, and perform 
other functions that are similar to those found in Microsoft Excel.

Schedule tab

Te contextual 
tab in the ribbon

786 | CHAPTER 18 DOCUMENTING YOUR DESIGN
Another key feature of the contextual tab for schedules is the Highlight In Model button. 
This button allows you to select any element in the schedule and locate that element within the 
model. Let’s say you want to locate a particular door from your door schedule. Select the respec-
tive row in the schedule and click the Highlight In Model button; Revit will pull up a different 
view with that door highlighted. This technique can be a useful way to locate elements in the 
model, especially for larger models.
Now that you have an idea of the elements that compose a schedule, let’s explore the work-
ﬂow with the following two exercises. You will ﬁrst create a simple wall schedule and then cre-
ate a Usable Area schedule based on the areas you deﬁned earlier in this chapter.
Making a Wall Schedule
In this exercise, you will create a schedule of building elements that is ﬁltered to report only 
certain types of walls and is simpliﬁed to show only a summary of each unique wall type 
within the project. Make sure you have the c18-Sample-Building-Start.rvt or  
c18-Sample-Metric-Start.rvt ﬁle open; then follow these steps:
1. From the View tab in the ribbon, locate the Create panel, click Schedules, and then click 
Schedules/Quantities.
The New Schedule dialog box opens.
In some schedules, such as room schedules, area schedules, and sheet lists, the Insert Data Row 
button is active. This command allows you to add rows to the schedule to prepopulate the project 
with values before you actually create an element. In the example of rooms, if you ﬁrst create a room 
schedule and then generate a list of rooms using the Insert Data Row command, you can place 
rooms in your model using the predeﬁned data in the Room drop-down from the Options bar.
In addition to the various formatting tools in the contextual tab for schedules, you will ﬁnd 
a panel named Parameters. The drop-downs in this panel allow you to select some cells in the 
schedule and point them to other parameters within the project. As an example, we inserted a 
row beneath the title row and set the left cell to Project Information: Project Number. The two 
remaining cells in that row were merged and the cell’s parameter was set to Schedule: Phase 
using the two drop-downs in the Parameters panel. As you can see in Figure 18.22, you can even 
change the phase of the schedule directly in the cell of the schedule.

Additional informa-
tion can be added to 
a schedule with tools 
from the Parameters 
panel.

2. Choose Walls from the Category list, and click OK.
3. In the Fields tab, choose the following wall properties from the Available Fields list, and 
add them to the Scheduled Fields list (in order):
 
◆
Function
 
◆
Family
 
◆
Type
 
◆
Area
4. Switch to the Sorting/Grouping tab, set the ﬁrst Sort By ﬁeld to Family, and check the 
Header and Blank Line options. Leave the Itemize Every Instance option checked for now.
5. Click OK to close the dialog box and observe the amount of data that is available for this 
schedule.
Let’s reﬁne the schedule even further.
6. In the Properties palette, scroll down to ﬁnd the Edit buttons related to the ﬁve tabs in 
the Schedule Properties dialog box. Click the button next to Filter. Set the ﬁrst ﬁlter drop-
down list to Function: Equals: Exterior.
7. Switch to the Formatting tab and select the Function ﬁeld from the list. Check the Hidden 
Field option, and click OK to view the result in your schedule. It will look like this:
Note that now only the exterior walls are being listed. Walls with any other function 
property are not being itemized. Although the Function ﬁeld is not shown, it must be 
included in the Scheduled Fields list to be used as a ﬁlter.

788 | CHAPTER 18 DOCUMENTING YOUR DESIGN
8. From the Properties palette, click the Edit button related to the Sorting/Grouping tab. 
Uncheck the Itemize Every Instance option, and check the Grand Totals option. From the 
Grand Totals drop-down list, choose Totals Only.
9. Switch to the Formatting tab, and select the Family ﬁeld from the list. Check the Hidden 
Field option. Next, select the Area ﬁeld, check the Calculate Totals option, and set the 
Alignment to Right.
10. Click OK to close the dialog box and observe the ﬁnal modiﬁcations to your wall sched-
ule (Figure 18.23).
Figure 18.23 
Te ﬁnished exterior 
wall schedule dis-
plays a summary of 
elements.
In this simple wall schedule exercise, you saw that a large amount of model data can be suc-
cinctly itemized and displayed using a combination of parameters within the elements. Only 
the exterior wall types were itemized, and the total area for each type was reported, including a 
grand total of all types.
Making an Area Schedule
In our next exercise, you will create an area schedule speciﬁcally for the Usable Area scheme 
you established earlier in this chapter. The process is similar to that of creating a wall schedule.
If you are working through all the exercises in this chapter, continue with the c18-Sample-
Building-Start.rvt or c18-Sample-Metric-Start.rvt ﬁle from this book’s web page. To cre-
ate the schedule, follow these steps:
1. From the View tab in the ribbon, select Schedules and then Schedule/Quantities. From 
the Categories list, select the Area (Usable Area) schedule type and click OK.
2. On the Fields tab, notice that the available ﬁelds in an area table are much more limited 
than they were in the Walls table in the previous exercise. For this schedule, you need 
only four ﬁelds.
 
◆
Area Type
 
◆
Level
 
◆
Name
 
◆
Area
Choose those from the Fields list on the left, and using the Add button, move them to the 
right or double-click the names to move them from one side to the other.

CREATING SCHEDULES AND LEGENDS | 789
Remember that the order of the ﬁelds in this list will determine the order of the columns 
in your ﬁnal schedule. Use the Move Up and Move Down buttons as needed to order the 
list correctly.
3. Next, choose the Sorting/Grouping tab. From the ﬁrst pull-down menu, choose to sort by 
Area Type and check the Header and Footer boxes with the Totals Only option. In the second 
pull-down, choose to sort by Level. Check the Itemize Every Instance option at the bottom.
4. In this schedule, you want to make the areas read as they would in a spreadsheet—right-
justiﬁed and totaled. Choose the Formatting tab and select Area from the list on the left. 
Change the Alignment to Right and check the Calculate Totals box. Select the Area Type 
ﬁeld and select the Hidden Field box.
5. Click OK to close the dialog box, and observe your results (Figure 18.24). The areas placed 
on each level should be listed under a header, and the total area should be calculated at 
the bottom of each grouped level. Finally, the sum of all areas is displayed as a grand 
total at the bottom of the schedule.

Adding Schedules to Your Templates
As you continue to document your designs, you will likely use the same schedules on many projects. 
Spend the time to make them consistent with your oﬃce’s graphic standards, and add them to 
your oﬃce template. Tat way, you won’t have to create them from scratch each and every time. 
As you add content to your model, the schedules will automatically populate, in eﬀect ﬁlling 
themselves out.
If you have a schedule in another project and you want to add it to your current project, there’s no 
need to re-create it. Open both projects in the same instance of Revit. Go to the sheet on which 
the schedule you want to copy appears. If it’s not on a sheet, you’ll need to place it on one. Ten 
simply select it and copy it to the Clipboard (press Ctrl+C). In your destination project, go to any 
sheet and press Ctrl+V to paste it. Once the paste is ﬁnished, the schedule should be there with all 
the formatting from the previous project but with all the information from your current model.

790 | CHAPTER 18 DOCUMENTING YOUR DESIGN
Another way to save a schedule separate from a project ﬁle is to save the view. Choose the Application 
button and click Save As ➢ Library ➢ Save Views. From here you can select several schedules to 
export as a small, separate RVT ﬁle. Tis ﬁle can then be inserted into other project ﬁles to add the 
schedules. If you want to export only one schedule, you can right-click the schedule in the Project 
Browser and select Save To New File from the context menu.
continued
Creating a Sheet List
Using a sheet list schedule, you can create a tabular view of sheets in your project, even 
including drawings provided by consultants. This type of schedule allows you to create 
placeholders for sheets that are not yet created or that will not be part of your discipline’s 
drawing set.
In the sample workﬂow, you have created area plans for the Usable Area scheme. Eventually, 
you may want to create another area scheme based on departmental spaces. You haven’t created 
them yet, but you want to create your sheet list, including the area plans that you will create 
later. To do so, follow these steps:
1. From the View tab in the ribbon, click Schedules ➢ Sheet List.
2. In the Fields tab of the Sheet List Properties dialog box, add the ﬁelds named Sheet 
Number and Sheet Name to the list of scheduled ﬁelds.
3. On the Sorting/Grouping tab, choose to sort by Sheet Number, and make sure the Itemize 
Every Instance check box is selected. Click OK to close the dialog box.
4. To begin adding sheets to the sheet list, go to the Rows panel in the ribbon and then 
click Insert ➢ Data Rows. This will give you a row with the next sequential number 
based on the last number you entered. Change the sheet number in the new row to 
G101 and click the Data Rows button again. The next new row should be G102. Change 
the names of G101 and G102 to LEVEL 1 AREA PLAN and LEVEL 2 AREA PLAN, 
respectively.
You can continue populating the schedule in this way, adding any sheet names you need 
or plan to have in the presentation package. Next, you will begin to create a sheet directly 
from a row in the sheet list.
5. Start by selecting the New Sheet button from the Modify Schedules/Quantities tab on the 
ribbon. This will give you a dialog box similar to Figure 18.25.

CREATING SCHEDULES AND LEGENDS | 791
Figure 18.25 
Converting a place-
holder into a sheet
6. Select the type of sheet border you’d like to use from the list at the top. Choose the C size 
sheet border for this exercise.
7. Select G101 - LEVEL 1 AREA PLAN from the list of placeholder sheets and click OK.
This will create a sheet from the line item in the schedule using the same name and sheet 
number. The new sheet will appear under the Sheet node in the Project Browser with the correct 
number and name. You will begin to add views to this sheet later in this chapter.
Using Legends
Legends can become great tools for general notes, key plans, or any other view type that you 
will want to have consistent across several sheets. It’s also important to note that anything you 
place inside a legend view—doors, walls, windows, and so on—will not appear or be counted in 
any schedules. Legend elements live outside of any quantities present in the model.
The Legend tool is located on the Create panel in the View tab. You can create two types of 
legends from this menu: a legend, which is a graphic display, or a keynote legend, which is a text-
based schedule. Both legend types can be placed on multiple sheets, but for this exercise, you’ll 
focus on the graphic legend. The keynote legend will be handled in more detail in Chapter 19, 
“Annotating Your Design.”
As part of the sample workﬂow, you may want to present some of the wall types from your 
presentation package to demonstrate the Sound Transmission Class (STC) of the walls and the 
overall wall assembly. Because these wall types will be appearing on all the sheets where you 
are using them in plan, you’ll make them using a legend.
Certiﬁcation
Objective

792 | CHAPTER 18 DOCUMENTING YOUR DESIGN
To make a legend, choose the Legend button from the View tab under the Legends ﬂyout. 
Creating a new legend is much like creating a new drafting view. You’ll be presented with a 
New Legend View dialog box (Figure 18.26), where you can name the legend and set the scale. 
For this legend, name it WALL LEGEND and choose 1 1/2″ = 1″−0″ (choose 1:10 if you are work-
ing in metric) for the scale.
Figure 18.26 
Creating a legend
The legend you’ve created will look like a blank view. At this point, it’s up to you to add 
content. The simplest type of legend would be adding notes such as plan or demolition notes 
that would appear in each of your ﬂoor plans. You could do this simply by using the Text tool 
and adding text within this legend view; however, in this example you want to add more than 
just text.
To add wall types or any other family to the legend view, expand the Families tree in the 
Project Browser and navigate to the Wall family. Expand this node and then expand the Basic 
Wall node. Select the Interior − 4 7/8″ (138 mm) Partition (1-Hr) wall type, drag it into the view, 
and insert it anywhere.
With the family inserted into the view, it will appear as a 3′ (1000 mm) plan wall. Change 
your view’s detail level from Coarse to Medium or Fine so you can see the details change within 
the wall. With that done, select the inserted wall and look at the settings in the Options bar. 
These options will be consistent for any of the family types you insert. The Options bar for leg-
end elements consists of three sections.
Family  This drop-down menu allows you to select different family types and operates just 
like the Type Selector does for other elements within the model.
View  The View option lets you change the type of view from Floor Plan to Section.
Host Length  This option changes the overall length (or in the case of sections, height) of the 
element selected.
Let’s make some minor adjustments to the wall sample in the legend. Let’s change View to 
Section and change Host Length to 1′-6″ (500 mm).
The wall now looks like a sectional element. By adding some simple text, you can embellish 
the wall type to better explain the elements you’re viewing (Figure 18.27).
Continue the exercise by adding the Exterior – EIFS On Metal Stud wall type to the legend 
along with some additional text notes to Figure 18.27.

LAYING OUT SHEETS | 793

Laying Out Sheets
Throughout this chapter, you have created different kinds of views, including area plans, sched-
ules, and legends. Eventually you will need to lay those out onto sheets so they can be printed or 
exported as PDF or DWF ﬁles and sent to others for review.
Creating sheets is easy. As you’ve already seen, you can create sheets through a sheet list 
schedule. You can also create sheets by right-clicking the Sheet node in the Project Browser and 
selecting New Sheet from the context menu, or you can create new sheets by clicking on the 
Sheet icon in the View tab. Regardless of which method you use to create them, in the following 
sections we’ll walk you through laying out these views on sheets and show you how to manipu-
late each view further once it’s placed on a sheet.
Adding the Area Plan
In the following exercise, you will continue to use the c18-Sample-Building-Start.rvt or 
c18-Sample-Metric-Start.rvt ﬁle saved from previous exercises in this chapter:
1. Open the G101 – LEVEL 1 AREA PLAN sheet in the view window by double-clicking it 
in the Project Browser. Now, let’s add your ﬁrst view—the Usable Area plan for Level 1. 
To do this, simply drag and drop it from the Project Browser onto the sheet. The view will 
show at the proper scale and with a view title already established. You can then drag the 
view across the sheet to place it where you’d like to have it, which in this case is centered 
at the top of the sheet.
2. When views are placed on sheets, they are referred to as viewports. Select the view you 
just placed on the sheet and look at the Properties palette. The instance properties of the 
viewport are actually the view properties of that view. These properties can be modi-
ﬁed at any time in the Properties palette for a viewport that has been placed on a sheet. 
A viewport also has type properties that determine the view title family, the visibility of 
the view title, and the formatting of the optional title extension line. We discuss viewport 
management with greater detail in Chapter 21, “Presenting Your Design.”
3. After placing the view on the sheet, you’ll notice that the purple area boundary lines are 
still visible. If you print the sheet at this point, the software will print those lines as thick, 
black lines that border your ﬂoor plate. This may be undesirable, so you need to do some 
view management to turn those lines off. One way you can do this is by activating the 
area plan from the Project Browser and working within the view itself. Since you have 
the view already established on a sheet, there’s no reason to go back to the original view 
when you can work on it directly through the sheet.
4. Right-click the view on the sheet and choose Activate View from the context menu. You 
can also double-click a view placed on a sheet to activate it.

794 | CHAPTER 18 DOCUMENTING YOUR DESIGN
Activating a View
Activating a view is like working in model space through a paper space viewport in Autodesk® 
AutoCAD® software. You’re working on the actual view, but you’re doing so while it is placed 
on the sheet. This gives you the beneﬁt of seeing how changes to the view will affect the lay-
out of the view on the sheet. For example, it could be undesirable to enlarge the crop window 
for the view to show more information on the sheet. Doing so will take up valuable sheet real 
estate and should be balanced by the amount of space the other views on this sheet need. You’ll 
also notice that once the view is activated, all the surrounding materials (the sheet and any 
other views) turn gray. This is to alert you to the fact that you’re working in the view and are 
not active on the sheet.
In this view, however, you want to make some modiﬁcations to the visibility and turn off the 
area boundaries so they are not visible when you print. To do this, open the Visibility/Graphic 
Overrides dialog box by pressing VG on your keyboard or navigating to the command via the 
context menu.
In the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box, pan down in the Model tab (activated by 
default) and choose the Lines node. Uncheck the box for <Area Boundaries> and click OK. The 
boundary lines should disappear from the view.
Now you’re ready to get out of the activation mode and add some additional views to the 
sheet. To do this, right-click anywhere within the view and choose Deactivate View from the 
context menu. You can also double-click outside the viewport to deactivate the view.
Deactivate Active Views
Keep the following in mind: once you activate a view and complete your edits, you must deac-
tivate it. As you can see on the sheet, activated views gray out the surrounding sheet context. 
If you were to print at this point, the sheet would print as gray with only the activated view 
showing in black.
To deactivate a view, you can do one of three things. You can click Deactivate View from the context 
ribbon, you can right-click the mouse and choose Deactivate View from the context menu, or you 
can simply double-click outside of the view area.
With the view on the sheet, you will want to make some other adjustments to help clean 
up the sheet layout a bit. One thing you will want to do is modify the view title’s location and 
length. To do this, select the viewport, and the view title will activate. With the view title active, 
you’ll notice the blue grip at the end of the title line. By grabbing and dragging the grip, you can 
shorten the view title. Press the Esc key or click the Modify button in the upper-left corner in the 
ribbon to deselect the viewport.
Now select the view title itself—not the viewport—and then click and drag the title closer to 
the view itself (Figure 18.28).

Using Guide Grids
If you have multiple plans, elevations, or sections that need to be placed at the same location on 
a series of sheets, the Guide Grid command can help you manage this. Guide grids are nonprint-
ing grids that can be associated with sheets. The grids allow you to snap or align elements such 
as reference planes, other grids, or crop regions to speciﬁc locations relative to the sheet border.
You can create as many unique guide grids as required in a Revit project. First, activate the 
G101 sheet to establish your ﬁrst guide grid. Complete the following exercise before placing the 
next area plan on a new sheet:
1. From the View tab in the ribbon, select Guide Grid from the Sheet Composition panel. 
Name the new grid C-Sheet Area Plans.
2. When you see the grid appear on the sheet, select it and look at the Properties palette. 
Change the spacing to 3″ (75 mm).
3. Select the outer boundary of the guide grid and activate the Move command (press MV 
on the keyboard). Snap to one of the grid intersections within the guide, and then move it 
to the upper-left intersection of the inner sheet border.
Where you place the guide grid and the spacing of the grid itself will depend on exactly 
how you plan to use it. In our example, we need to identify only a single common point to 
which we will align our area plans. The location of the boundary of the grid is not impor-
tant; the boundary cannot be snapped to.

796 | CHAPTER 18 DOCUMENTING YOUR DESIGN
4. Access the view properties of the sheet and scroll down to ﬁnd the Guide Grid property. 
Make sure it is set to C-Sheet Area Plans.
5. Select the area plan already placed on sheet G101 and activate the Move command. Snap 
to the intersection of the two reference planes visible in the plan and then to a nearby 
intersection on the guide grid.
Note that some traditional modifying methods do not work with guide grids. For exam-
ple, you cannot use the Align command.
6. If you haven’t already done so, create a new sheet using the G102 - LEVEL 2 AREA PLAN 
placeholder. In the Properties palette, make sure the guide grid is speciﬁed, and note that 
it is now in exactly the same location as on the previous sheet.
7. Drag the Level 2 Usable Area plan onto the sheet; then use the Move command to adjust 
the location of the plan to the same location as on the previous sheet (Figure 18.29). Note 
that only crop regions and datum objects will snap to the guide grids; therefore, you may 
need to activate the area plans and enter Reveal Hidden Elements mode in the view con-
trol bar. This will temporarily display reference planes in the exercise ﬁle. Deactivate the 
view and move the viewports into alignment with the guide grid.
Figure 18.29 
Use guide grids to help 
align views among a 
series of sheets.
If you haven’t noticed already, model views of the same scale will always snap to each other 
without any special grids. What you might not realize is that this also works between views of 
different types as long as they are of the same scale. For example, you can drag an elevation from 
the Project Browser onto sheet G102 and see how it snaps in relation to the plan. Sections can also 
be aligned with elevations and with plans. Even 3D views can be aligned with each other.

LAYING OUT SHEETS | 797
Adding the Schedule
With the largest view, the area plan, on the sheet, you can use the bottom portion of the sheet to 
lay out your other views. For the second view, let’s add the area schedule you created. To do this, 
drag and drop it from the Project Browser in much the same way you added the area plan. The 
inserted view will look like Figure 18.30. You’ll notice some differences in how this view looks 
from the way a schedule looks when it’s not on a sheet. Speciﬁcally, you can now see the header 
text and the fonts you chose in the schedule properties. You’ll also be able to see the grid lines 
and their associated line weights from the Appearance tab of the schedule properties.
Figure 18.30 
A schedule placed on 
a sheet
With the schedule on the sheet, it looks a bit tight. You have the ability to redeﬁne the column 
spacing so you can make any visual adjustments to the schedule while it is on the sheet to help it 
read better. These adjustments do not change the actual schedule—just its appearance on the sheet.
To do this, highlight the schedule by selecting it. The schedule will turn blue, and you’ll have a few 
new grips to help you make adjustments (Figure 18.31). The blue inverted triangles will allow you to 
modify the column widths. Grab them and drag them left or right to change the column sizing.
Figure 18.31 
A schedule’s appear-
ance can be manipu-
lated when it is placed 
on a sheet.
You’ll also notice a blue cut symbol on the schedule. This cut symbol lets you break the 
schedule into multiple vertical columns on the same sheet. This tool can be especially handy if 
you have a long schedule like a room schedule or door schedule and it has too many rows to ﬁt 
vertically on your sheet. Selecting this tool will break the schedule in half (and you can break 
it into half again and again) so that you can take advantage of the horizontal real estate. If you 
choose to separate your schedule in this fashion, it will still retain all the necessary information 

798 | CHAPTER 18 DOCUMENTING YOUR DESIGN
and all the portions will continue to automatically ﬁll themselves out dynamically as a single 
schedule would. You also have the opportunity to change the overall height of the schedule once 
it is broken up by grabbing the grips at the bottom of the schedule and dragging up and down 
(Figure 18.32). Doing so will draw or push rows from the adjacent schedule portion so that all of 
your information is continuous.
Figure 18.32 
Changing the schedule 
height
To rebuild a split schedule—essentially returning it to a single list—select the schedule on the 
sheet so it highlights and the grips are displayed. Click one of the move icons and drag the split 
portion on top of the other schedule segment. The split schedule will then become whole again.
Finishing the Sheet
Now that you have those two views on the sheet, it is a simple matter to add the remaining 
view. To add the wall legend you created, you will drag and drop it from the Project Browser in 
much the same way you did with the other two views. In this case, the wall legend came onto 
the sheet needing little modiﬁcation, completing Sheet G102 (Figure 18.33).

Document plans.  With ﬂoor plans you can create visual graphics that help deﬁne how a 
space is laid out. However, Revit provides other tools such as area plans to help you describe 
space.
Master It  List the four types of area plans that you can create, and note the two that 
Revit creates automatically.
Create schedules and legends.  Schedules are another view type; they allow you to show 
information about the model in a nongraphic format. Schedules can also be used to dynami-
cally report quantities of elements inside the model.
Master It  Understand how to create schedules and report additional information about 
the elements in the model. How would you create a simple casework schedule showing 
quantities of types?
Lay out sheets.  Eventually in a project it will become necessary to create sheets that will 
become the documentation set. Knowing how to create a good sheet set provides you with 
another venue to communicate with contractors, clients, and other team members.
Master It  To properly create a sheet set, you need to understand the dynamics of adding 
views to a sheet. In the Revit environment, there is only one way to add views to a sheet. 
What is it?

 Chapter  19 
 Annotating Your Design   
 No set of documents is complete without the annotations to describe the drawings. Even when 
you are using a digital, parametric model, you still need to provide annotated documents. It is 
necessary to add dimensions, tags, text, and notes to the drawings to properly communicate 
with owners, contractors, and the rest of the design team. 
 In this chapter, you’ll learn to 
 
◆
 Annotate with text and keynotes 
 
◆

◆
Add dimensions 
 
◆
Set project and shared parameters 
 Annotating with Text and Keynotes 
 Notes are a critical part of communicating design and construction intent to owners and build-
ers. No drawing set is complete without descriptions of materials and the work like the ones you 
can see in Figure  19.1 . 
 You can add notes to your drawings in Autodesk ® Revit ® software in two ways. Both are 
located on the Annotate tab and highlighted in Figure  19.2 . One of these methods is the Text 
command (shown on the left), and the other is the Keynote command (shown on the right). 
 The text object consists of a resizable ﬁ eld into which you can enter text with optional fea-
tures, including leaders, bullets, or numbers. Text can be used for annotations, sheet notes (such 
as general notes), or legends; it can be used generally anywhere you need to add a description or 
a note. 
 Keynotes are predeﬁ ned text ﬁ elds that are linked to elements and materials through a data 
ﬁ le. Keynotes can be scheduled and standardized across the project but can’t be directly edited 
within the application. Both keynotes and text have speciﬁ c uses. Let’s look at how both of these 
can be used in a project. 
 Using Text 
 Text is quick and easy to add to any view (including 3D views), and like other drafting ele-
ments it is view-speciﬁ c. Text added to one view will not appear in any other location within 
the model, nor will the information that you insert into the text box hold any sort of parametric 
values.

802 | CHAPTER 19 ANNOTATING YOUR DESIGN 
You can access the Text tool from the Text panel on the Annotate tab (shown previously in 
Figure 19.2). To begin adding text, select the Text tool and ﬁrst observe the settings in the contex-
tual ribbon (Figure 19.3). You can specify an option for a leader, the position of the leader, and 
the justiﬁcation of the text. It is easier to set these options before you place a text object, but they 
can always be adjusted later.

for the text tool
After you have selected the most appropriate settings for your annotation, go to a place in a 
view where you’d like to place the text object. You will have the opportunity to use one of two 
methods to create the text object. If you click once, the location you clicked will be the origin of 

ANNOTATING WITH TEXT AND KEYNOTES | 803
the text object and the text will not have a deﬁned width. Using this method, you may need to 
use the Enter key to ﬁt the text to your needs—pressing Enter will create a line break in the text 
box. This method may cause some difﬁculty in the future if you need to resize the text box or if 
you change the scale of the view.
The other option is to hold down the left mouse button while you click to place the origin of 
the text. Then drag the mouse pointer to specify the boundary of the text object, creating a box. 
Don’t worry about the vertical extents of the boundary; you just need to set the width of the 
text box. Using this option gives you greater ﬂexibility if you need to resize the text box or if the 
scale of your view changes, because the word-wrapping will be handled automatically. With the 
Text command active, you’ll be presented with the standard mouse pointer crosshair, but it will 
have a small A in the lower-right corner to let you know you are adding text and not other ele-
ments. In either case, if you need to adjust the width of your text box, you can do so at any time 
using the grips.
If you select one of the leader options in the ribbon before placing the text object, your ﬁrst 
one or two clicks (depending on the leader option selected) will be to place the leader. For exam-
ple, if you choose the two-segment line leader option, your ﬁrst click will be the arrowhead of 
the leader. Your second click will be the elbow of the leader, and then the third click will be the 
beginning of the text box. At this third click, you can still drag the mouse pointer to predeﬁne 
the width of the text box. Try this a few times until you become familiar with the implicit place-
ment and snapping alignment of text objects and leaders.
Once you place a text object in a view, you can write much as you do in applications such as 
Microsoft Word. Once you ﬁnish typing, click outside the text box. Your ﬁnished text box will 
look like Figure 19.4.
Figure 19.4 
A highlighted text box
With the text box selected, or as you’re typing, you’ll notice some text formatting features. 
For anyone familiar with any other text editor, these tools should be fairly self-explanatory, 
and for anyone familiar with Revit over the past few years, these come as some long-sought-
after text-editing improvements. The tools, shown in Figure 19.5, will allow you to do the 
following:
 
◆
Format the font to bold, italic, or underlined text
 
◆
Add subscripts or superscripts
 
◆
Change font size visually
 
◆
Add bullets, numbers, or alphabetical lists
 
◆
Indent text
 
◆
Change the position of text in a list by adding or removing incremental tabulation

804 | CHAPTER 19 ANNOTATING YOUR DESIGN 
Figure 19.5 
Additional text  
formatting tools
You’ll also notice that once you ﬁnish with your initial text or you select an existing text 
object, a few tools are available with which you can modify the text:
Grips  The round grips on either side of the text box allow you to resize the width of the box.
Move  There is a move icon that appears in the upper-left corner of the text box. In addition, 
hovering your mouse anywhere within the highlighted text will also display a move cursor. 
You can click and drag from within the box or click the move icon on the upper-left corner 
to relocate it. When you’re moving text with the move icon (or the Move command), the text 
and leader will relocate together. When you’re moving text by dragging, the leader end will 
remain pinned while you relocate the text box. These methods let you move either the text or 
the text and the leader, depending on your need.
Rotate  The upper-right corner shows a rotate icon. Clicking this icon allows you to rotate 
the text box as you would any object in a project. Remember that text will always position 
itself to be read left to right if it is horizontal or bottom to top if it is vertical in a view.
A text family behaves like other families because it maintains a parametric relationship 
throughout the project. Making type property changes to a text object in one location (changing 
font, font size, color, and so on) changes all the instances of that type throughout the model. To 
modify text type properties, select a block of text or choose the Text tool and then observe the 
Properties palette, as shown in Figure 19.6.
Figure 19.6 
Type Selector for text
The instance properties for text objects are rather limited and deal primarily with controls 
such as alignment, location, and so on, which you can also set on the ribbon. The Type Selector 
also allows you to select a different text type or edit the properties of the currently selected 
type. Click the Edit Type button to open the text family’s type properties. Figure 19.7 shows the 
properties for the default 1/4″ Arial text type.

ANNOTATING WITH TEXT AND KEYNOTES | 805
In the Type Properties dialog box, you have more control over the style of the text from a type 
perspective. While you can now edit speciﬁc text in a text box, there are still many reasons that 
you want to control text with the Type tool. In the Type Selector, you can modify text type prop-
erties, such as font, size, and width factor. You can also add formatting to the text, such as bold, 
italic, and underline. Other important settings to consider include Show Border, Background, 
and Leader Arrowhead. The Show Border property simply allows all text object instances to 
be enclosed with a line boundary. The Background property can be set to either Opaque or 
Transparent, which will control whether the text will obscure objects beneath it. Finally, the 
style of leader arrowhead is deﬁned in the text type properties to help you maintain consistency 
throughout your design documents.
Contextual Text Formatting
When any text object is selected in a view (not the text itself), additional formatting tools 
become available on the ribbon. The Format panel is divided into four sections that allow you 
to modify the instance of the text you’ve placed. Figure 19.8 shows the Format panel when the 
overall text object is selected and when you activate the text within the object. Let’s look at this 
panel in more detail to better understand the toolset.
Figure 19.7 
Type Properties  
dialog box

806 | CHAPTER 19 ANNOTATING YOUR DESIGN 
Leaders  The leftmost section of this panel (a) allows you to designate the type and style of 
leader you want to add to your text box. When you activate the Text tool, the upper-left A is 
selected by default (as in Figure 19.8), which designates that no leader is currently added. The 
other choices all add a leader to the text. Reading from left to right, the options are no leader, a 
single-segment leader, a double-segment leader, and an arc leader. Leaders can be added at any 
time when you’re placing or editing text and can also be removed at any time. Remember that 
when you’re removing leaders, they will disappear in the order in which they were added.
Leader Location  The second portion of this panel (b) dictates leader location. Leaders can 
be added to the left or to the right and at the top, middle, or bottom of the text box. The top 
example in Figure 19.9 shows the default with a left leader springing from the upper left of 
the text; leaders that spring from the right side typically come from the end of the text box 
(at the bottom). A double-segment leader springing from the left and right will look like the 
example shown in Figure 19.9.

Using Keynotes
Keynotes are annotations that use a parameter to connect speciﬁc elements or materials in the 
model to descriptive information stored in an external TXT ﬁle. You can control the formatting 
of the keynote’s font style, size, and justiﬁcation in the same manner as you can format standard 
text, but keynotes are essentially a tag family. Formatting changes must be made in the keynote’s 
family (RFA) ﬁle and reloaded into the project.
Inserting a keynote allows you to choose a value from the TXT ﬁle and apply it to a material 
or element. Because keynotes act as families, they can also be scheduled where standard text 
cannot. Before we discuss how to add different keynote types, we’ll explore the various ways a 
keynote can be displayed.
The keynoting functionality generally supports the American Institute of Architects (AIA)  
proposal of the ConDoc system, in which a short numeric reference (usually based on 
MasterFormat by the Construction Speciﬁcations Institute) followed by a two-letter sufﬁx is 
used to label elements in a drawing. The keynote then references a list or legend that is located 
on the same sheet as the note and has a longer deﬁnition of the note. For example, a keynote on a 
detail might read 033000.A1, with a leader pointing to an element in the drawing. The associated 

ANNOTATING WITH TEXT AND KEYNOTES | 807
list on the side of the sheet would read CAST IN PLACE CONCRETE. Figure 19.10 shows an 
example of a keynote legend.
Figure 19.10 
A keynote legend
Despite the intended use of a keynote, you are not restricted to using only the numeric code. 
You can also display the full, written description directly within the detail or view without the 
numeric reference key. Figure 19.11 shows an example of keynotes that display the full descrip-
tion instead of the key.
Figure 19.11 
Keynotes displaying 
full text descriptions
There is no wrong way to use keynotes, and Revit supports several methods of using them 
for annotation. Regardless of the method you use, keynotes will adhere to the same process 
for use. Once an element is tagged with a keynote, it will retain that keynote in all other views 
in the model. If an element has been tagged with a keynote in one view and is then annotated 
in another view, it will automatically display the same keynote value. This can become a pow-
erful tool you can use to add consistency throughout the project for annotated elements.
You also have the ability to pin keynotes. Pinned keynotes will retain their location even if 
the element they have tagged has been moved.

808 | CHAPTER 19 ANNOTATING YOUR DESIGN 
The Keynote command is located on the Annotate tab in the ribbon. When you select the 
Keynote tool, you have three options.
Element  Use Element keynotes to annotate elements and assemblies within the model, 
such as walls, doors, ﬂoors, or other family instances. This type of note is typically used if 
you want to annotate an entire assembly (such as a wall, roof, or door). Moving the Element 
keynote leader arrow off the object will change the value of the note based on the element to 
which it points. The keynote value for a family type can be preset within the family. We’ll go 
into that later in this chapter.
Material  Using the Material keynote type will allow you to annotate speciﬁc materials 
within any elements. You can add notes for materials such as concrete, gypsum board, rigid 
insulation, metal studs, and so on. Moving the Material keynote leader arrow from one mate-
rial to another will change the value of the note based on the material to which it points even 
if it’s within the same element. So, a wall with multiple materials can have several Material 
keynotes. Material keynotes can also be predeﬁned as part of your project template through 
the Materials tool on the Manage tab. Material keynotes can also be used in conjunction with 
Element keynotes (Figure 19.12).
Figure 19.12 
Adding a Keynote  
value to the identity 
data for a material

ANNOTATING WITH TEXT AND KEYNOTES | 809
User  User keynotes are different from Element and Material keynotes because they are 
view-speciﬁc and cannot be predeﬁned. Although they are still tied to the same TXT ﬁle and 
will update in the same manner as other keynotes, they are not associated with any model 
objects. User keynotes are meant to be used for all the instances when you don’t have a mod-
eled element or material but you still need to deﬁne a note. Some examples of things you 
wouldn’t necessarily model might be sealant, backer rod, or ﬂashing.
User keynotes are used primarily in drafting views. To use any keynote, a given view 
must have at least one model element or component visible within it. In the case of a drafting 
view, you will need to insert a 2D component (such as wood blocking or a steel stud) because 
keynotes cannot be used to note linework. Because User keynotes are not locked to speciﬁc 
model geometry, once they are inserted they can easily be copied or moved around within 
the view and pointed toward any element. In this way, if you have sealant or ﬂashing shown 
as linework, you can add a User keynote to the view and then adjust the note leader and the 
note value to call out the sealant properly. You can change the value of a User keynote at any 
time simply by double-clicking the note value; this modiﬁcation will not affect any other notes 
within the project.
You can use all these note types in conjunction with one another. Using an Element note to 
add a keynote to a wall doesn’t mean you cannot also use a Material note to call out the indi-
vidual materials in the wall assembly.
Assigning Keynotes and Editing
A core concept of the Keynote tool is how the notes react within the model. Assigning a 
keynote to an object lets you associate a text or numeric value with a family’s keynote type 
parameter. This value is consistent for every instance of that element within the model or 
project. For example, all walls have a type parameter called Keynote that lets you set the 
keynote value. If you keynote a wall anywhere within the model, the keynote value in the 
type parameter will reﬂect that note. Consequently, any other wall of that type will be pre-
populated with that keynote value. Changes to this keynote value will dynamically update 
the type parameter value and update any keynotes placed within the model tagged to  
this wall.
All keynotes within a project are tied to an external TXT ﬁle. This TXT ﬁle is the only loca-
tion where the value of the keynotes can be edited. You can modify this ﬁle at any point to add 
or remove notes, and you can make the edits while the project is actively open. Figure 19.13 
shows a sample of the ﬁle.
This external ﬁle is designed to keep the annotations consistent by storing them in one repos-
itory. Every time you add or change a note value and reload the TXT ﬁle back into the Revit 
model, all the keynotes dynamically update.
You can edit this TXT ﬁle or add one to the project at any time. You can have multiple key-
note ﬁles for various projects, but you can have only one TXT ﬁle associated with a project at a 
time. You cannot assign multiple keynote ﬁles to one project model.

810 | CHAPTER 19 ANNOTATING YOUR DESIGN 
Figure 19.13 
Te keynote TXT ﬁle
Because the keynote list is a separate TXT ﬁle, if you are transferring ﬁles to other ofﬁces 
or clients, you may need to include the TXT ﬁle along with the RVT ﬁle. If you don’t send the 
TXT ﬁle, others will be able to see all your keynotes, but they won’t be able to change or edit 
any of them.
Managing Keynotes
A great way to ensure consistent use of notes throughout multiple projects is to create a master 
keynote ﬁle for each of your various project types. Tis master note list can be linked to elements 
and materials within your project template so that you can immediately begin inserting common 
notes into any project. Because this master list will likely be quite long, project teams can make 
a copy of the list and place it in their project directory. Tey can then safely delete the notes they 
won’t be using over the course of the project, giving them fewer options to hunt through when 
they need to add a keynote.
A single keynote ﬁle also gives project management a level of control over the consistency of the 
notes that you won’t be able to get if you use regular text. Spelling accidents or mislabeling can 
happen in a project when you use regular text objects. For example, it’s easy to overlook a note 
that reads CIP CONCRETE on one detail and CAST-IN-PLACE CONCRETE in another. By placing 
all the notes into one ﬁle, the project manager or project architect has better control over how the 
note reads, thus ensuring consistency throughout all the sheets and details.

ANNOTATING WITH TEXT AND KEYNOTES | 811
Using the Keynote File
Three default keynote text ﬁles are available at the library locations. In Windows 7, Windows 8,  
or Windows 10, they are found at C:\ProgramData\Autodesk\RVT 2018\Libraries\US 
Imperial (there is also a default metric keynote ﬁle in the US Metric folder). Another way to 
ﬁnd these ﬁles is to start a new project using the default template and go to the Annotate tab. 
Click the Keynote drop-down arrow on the Tag panel and select Keynoting Settings. In the 
Keynoting Settings dialog box, click the Browse button and you will be taken to the default 
library location.
These four keynote ﬁles are
RevitKeynotes_Imperial.txt
RevitKeynotes_Imperial_2004.txt
RevitKeynotes_Imperial_2010.txt
RevitKeynotes_Metric.txt
You can edit any of these ﬁles in Notepad or Excel and follow the format already established 
within the ﬁle. Let’s look at the format of this ﬁle so you can understand how to customize the 
keynotes.
The ﬁrst few rows of the ﬁle (Figure 19.14) designate the grouping of the notes. In this exam-
ple, they consist of a label (Division 03) followed by a tab and then a description (Concrete).
Figure 19.14 
Te keynote TXT ﬁle 
header
Directly below this header is a secondary, or minor, grouping. This secondary group-
ing follows the same format as the primary group and provides better control over how the 
keynotes are displayed within Revit. This line follows the same format as the ﬁrst: Label 
(030000), then a tab, then a description (Concrete), then another tab, and then a reference to 
the parent code (Division 03). This last entry must match the label in the line above. This 
designates the second line as a subset to the ﬁrst line. You can add as many or as few sub-
groups as you’d like. In our case, we have subcategories for each division, but that’s not 
necessary.
Below the grouping are the contents of that group. These lines are articulated in the follow-
ing format:
Label [tab] Description (note body) [tab] Grouping
In the example shown in Figure 19.14, this reads as follows (where [tab] is an actual tab, not 
the text):
033000.A1 [tab] C.I.P. CONCRETE (033000) [tab] 030000
To get an idea of how this will all look once loaded into Revit, see Figure 19.15, which shows 
you the Keynotes dialog box with Division 03 expanded.

812 | CHAPTER 19 ANNOTATING YOUR DESIGN 
Using the keynote ﬁle approach lets you add, remove, or edit notes and groups of notes. It 
might seem frustrating to have to open and load a separate TXT ﬁle every time you want to add 
or remove notes from the keynote list. However, remember that this also maintains consistency 
and a level of control over the master list that isn’t available with simple text objects. Although 
it might be slow at stages to get all the project notes into the TXT ﬁle, it also means that the time 
you’ll spend checking and verifying the notes is dramatically reduced.
If you ﬁnd that editing keynotes in an external TXT ﬁle that is segregated from the proj-
ect environment does not suit your needs, tools are available online to help you manage 
keynotes using a graphical interface. Revolution Design has created a tool called Keynote 
Manager (www.revolutiondesign.biz) that will manage your keynote list, create headings 
and subheadings, and format the TXT ﬁle in a way that Revit can read it. Tools like this are 
great for speeding up the editing process for keynotes and maintaining proper formatting 
of the TXT ﬁle.
Accessing Keynote Settings and Loading the TXT File
Now that the keynote TXT ﬁle is established and you’ve begun populating it with annotations, 
you need to link it to your project. Loading this ﬁle into the project is simple and needs to hap-
pen only once. Additionally, loading this keynote ﬁle is a project setting, not a user setting. Once 
the ﬁle is linked, all team members will have access to the keynotes. As a side note, if you are 
Figure 19.15

working in a team environment, make sure to place the keynote ﬁle in a location everyone has 
access to, like a network resource. Placing it on your C: drive will allow you access to it but will 
not allow others on your team to see the notes.
To access the keynote settings and load the keynote text ﬁle, go to the Annotate tab in 
the ribbon, locate the Tag panel, and then click Keynote ➢ Keynoting Settings, as shown in 
Figure 19.16.
Figure 19.16 
Accessing the 
Keynoting Settings
This command will open the Keynoting Settings dialog box (Figure 19.17). Here, you can 
deﬁne the project’s keynote ﬁle as well as adjust some other settings. To load the keynote ﬁle, 
click the Browse button and navigate to the TXT ﬁle you created.
Figure 19.17 
Te Keynoting Settings 
dialog box
Here are some other variables that you can set in the Keynoting Settings dialog box:
File Path  File Path deﬁnes how Revit Architecture looks for your text ﬁle using one of three 
methods.
Absolute  The Absolute option follows the UNC naming conventions and navigates 
across your network or workstation for a speciﬁed location.

814 | CHAPTER 19 ANNOTATING YOUR DESIGN 
Relative  This option locates the text ﬁle relative to your RVT project ﬁle. If you move 
the RVT ﬁle and the text ﬁle and maintain the same folder structure, the keynote ﬁle will 
be found and automatically loaded.
At Library Locations  This option lets you put the text ﬁle in the default library location 
deﬁned in the File Locations tab of the Options dialog box (Application ➢ Options).
Numbering Method  Numbering Method deﬁnes how the keynotes are numbered.
By Keynote  This option allows you to number keynotes as they come from the associated 
text ﬁle.
By Sheet  With this option enabled, the keynotes are numbered sequentially on a  
per-sheet basis.
Adding Keynotes
Download the project ﬁle c19-Sample-Building-Start.rvt and the keynote ﬁle MARA_
Keynotes.txt from the folder for Chapter 19 on this book’s web page at www.sybex.com/go/
masteringrevit2018. Make sure you place them in the same folder on your computer because 
the path setting for the keynote ﬁle is set to Relative in the RVT ﬁle. Open the RVT project ﬁle to 
begin the exercise.
To add keynotes to an element in a project model, choose one of the three keynote types 
from the Annotate tab; then select the object you want to annotate in your view and insert a 
keynote. The sequence for inserting keynotes is arrowhead, leader segment, and then key-
note. Similar to placing a tag, the Keynote command (even the User keynote) requires an 
object to be selected to start the insertion sequence. If the object doesn’t have a note already 
deﬁned, you’ll be prompted to pick a note from the Keynotes dialog box. Figure 19.18 shows 
a sample of this list.
Loading or Reloading Keynotes
Once the keynote TXT ﬁle is loaded into Revit, it is available for the team to use. As we’ve men-
tioned, changes can be made to this ﬁle on the ﬂy while the project is open and active. Although 
this is true, if changes are made to the keynote ﬁle while the project is open, the keynote ﬁle will 
need to be reloaded into the project for the changes to be visible to other team members. Tere 
are two ways to do this.
 
◆
Open the Keynoting Settings dialog box and click the Reload button. Once this is done, you’ll 
need to use Synchronize With Central (if the project is workshared), and your team members 
will also need to use SWC to gain access to the changes.
 
◆
Close and reopen your project ﬁle.

ANNOTATING WITH TEXT AND KEYNOTES | 815
Let’s explore this functionality with a quick exercise in which you will annotate a detail with 
keynotes. Follow these steps:
1. From the Project Browser, expand the Sections (Wall Section) heading and activate the 
view named Window Sill Detail.
2. Go to the Annotate tab in the ribbon and select Keynote ➢ Element Keynote on the Tag panel.
3. Select the window in the view and then place the leader and keynote.
You will see that the keynote code has already been populated because the keynote has 
already been deﬁned in the type properties for the window family.
4. With the Element Keynote command still active, click the wood sill detail component and 
place another keynote. This time, the Keynotes dialog box will appear because no key-
note was deﬁned in the wall’s type properties. Select the keynote labeled 061100.A1 and 
then close the dialog box.
5. Go back to the Annotate tab in the ribbon and select Keynote ➢ Material Keynote.
6. Select the cross-hatched material at the right side of the wall below the window. Again, 
the Keynotes dialog box will appear because a keynote value was not deﬁned in that mate-
rial’s identity data. Select the keynote labeled 071300.A1 and then close the dialog box.
The results will look like the image in Figure 19.19.

816 | CHAPTER 19 ANNOTATING YOUR DESIGN 
Creating Keynote Legends
Depending on your choice of keynote and your workﬂow, you might want to create a legend on 
each sheet for your notes. You might want only the keynotes that are shown on a given sheet to 
dynamically appear in the legend. Or you might want to have one legend that will show all key-
notes used throughout the project.
These legends usually reside on the side of a sheet near the title block information and can 
take one of two forms. The ﬁrst type is all-inclusive and shows every note within the project. 
This style has the beneﬁt of consistency between sheets in the set. The same note will always be 
in the same location in the list; however, this type of list can become quite long for larger proj-
ects. The other type of keynote list includes only the notes that show up on a particular sheet. 
This has the advantage of supplying a list of notes customized for each sheet without extraneous 
information. Creating either list manually has traditionally been challenging. One of the ben-
eﬁts of Revit Architecture is the ability to completely automate either list type, thus removing 
much of the chance for error in the process. Let’s review how to create both types of lists.
Creating a keynote legend is simple: choose the Legends button on the View tab and select 
Keynote Legend from the drop-down list (Figure 19.20). Once you launch the command, name 
the keynote legend, and then click OK.
Figure 19.19 
A section detail with 
keynotes applied

You’ll be presented with what looks like a typical schedule dialog box, called Keynote 
Legend Properties. There are only two ﬁelds available in a keynote legend, and by default, they 
are both loaded into the Scheduled Fields side of the Fields tab (Figure 19.21). Those ﬁelds are as 
follows.
Key Value  This ﬁeld contains the numeric value of the keynote.
Keynote Text  This ﬁeld contains the text description for the keynote.

ANNOTATING WITH TEXT AND KEYNOTES | 817
A keynote legend works like any other schedule as far as formatting and appearance go. By 
default, the sorting and grouping are already established because the key value is used to sort. 
The one special item of note is located on the Filter tab. At the bottom of this tab is a feature 
unique to this type of schedule: a Filter By Sheet check box (Figure 19.22). Selecting this box 
gives you the ability to ﬁlter the list speciﬁcally for each sheet set; leaving the box deselected 
will supply a full list of the keynotes over the entire project.

818 | CHAPTER 19 ANNOTATING YOUR DESIGN 
Like any other type of legend, a keynote legend can be placed on sheets again and again 
within the project. You’re not limited to only one instance of the legend on a sheet as you are 
with other view types. Additionally, if you choose the keynote legend that ﬁlters by sheet, it 
will dynamically modify the note list based on individual sheet contents. As views are added or 
removed from a sheet or notes are added to the project, the keynote legend updates accordingly.
Keynote legends are considered to be another type of legend view and will appear under the 
Legends node of the Project Browser.
Using the Keynote Family
Revit Architecture comes with a default keynote family that allows you to produce both keynotes 
and text notes using the default keynote TXT ﬁle. The family name is Keynote Tag.rfa. This 
family has four types that let you change note styles within the project, as Figure 19.23 shows.
Figure 19.23 
Keynote styles avail-
able in the default tag
Here are the four default styles:
 
◆

A Schedule for Keynotes
Creating a schedule for keynotes is a great way to ﬁnd single-use notes and typos in a project. If 
you are working on a project team, there’s always a chance that someone could be inserting an 
incorrect keynote into the project. Scheduling the notes is an eﬃcient approach to managing the 
annotation process and gives you the tools to verify consistency. Scheduling keynotes allows you 
to do three things.
 
◆
List all the notes within a project and verify their spelling and accuracy.
 
◆
Find odd or one-oﬀ instances. Sometimes this can mean the note was accidentally placed in 
lieu of another note.
 
◆
Make sure all the keynotes in the project are represented in the speciﬁcations.

ANNOTATING WITH TAGS | 819
 
◆
Keynote Number – Boxed – Small

Keynote Text
Each of these tag types pulls information from the text ﬁle we discussed previously in this 
chapter and reports it at the end of the leader. To change your keynotes between any of these 
options, select the keynote and choose a different type in the Type Selector.
Annotating with Tags
Tags are text labels for elements such as doors, walls, windows, rooms, and several other 
objects that architects typically need to reference in a set of drawings. In Revit Architecture, 
tags are intelligent, bidirectional graphics that report information stored in an object’s prop-
erties. Once you’ve tagged an element and entered a value in the tag, the tagged model ele-
ment will retain that value until you remove it. The value lives with the model elements in 
a project; it is not a property of the tag. That means you can delete or remove tags without 
fear of losing the data entered into the tag. It also means that once an element is tagged with 
information in one view, if the tag is conﬁgured to report a type property, the same or simi-
lar elements will report the same information in any other view in which they are tagged 
without the necessity of entering the information twice. To understand this a bit better, take 
the example of a wall tag.
You’ve placed a wall tag in a view. The tag initially had “?” as a value, meaning that the Type 
Mark property for that wall was blank. In the wall tag, you’ve entered a wall type value of A1. 
In another view, you can now tag the same wall type, and it will automatically display a value of 
A1. You can also delete any, or even all, of the tags for that wall, and new tags you place will still 
report the type number of A1.
Keep in mind that you can also tag elements that are in linked models. Although you can-
not edit the properties of these elements (for example, you cannot change the wall type or door 
number), you can add tags to any of the linked elements as if the same elements were part of 
your project ﬁle.
Tags are versatile elements for annotating your designs. A tag can display a door number, but it 
can just as easily display any other properties of the door, such as ﬁre rating, cost, or material type.

820 | CHAPTER 19 ANNOTATING YOUR DESIGN 
Inserting Tags
Tags can be automatically inserted when a model element, such as a door or room, is placed 
within the project (by checking the Tag On Placement option in the contextual tab of the ribbon), 
or they can be inserted later. The options to place a tag are all located on the Tag panel of the 
Annotate tab (Figure 19.24).

Objective
Figure 19.24 
Tag tools in the 
Annotate tab
When you’re adding tags, it’s not necessary to ﬁnd or choose the right tag—they will be 
assigned automatically. Tag families are speciﬁc to the elements to which they are being 
tagged. For example, you use a door tag to tag a door, but you can’t use a door tag to tag a 
wall or other element within the project. Figure 19.25 shows you some of the tags that are 
available; there is a tag for each type of object. You can customize each of the tag family 
types so you can graphically differentiate your door tags from wall tags, room tags, area 
tags, and so on.
Figure 19.25 
Listing of various tag 
families
When inserting a tag, you’ll have several placement options available in the Options bar, as 
shown in Figure 19.26.
Figure 19.26 
Te Options bar when 
placing a tag

ANNOTATING WITH TAGS | 821
Orientation  The ﬁrst option allows you to orient the tag horizontally or vertically. Tags, like 
text, will always read from either the bottom or right side of the sheet or view.
The Tags Button  Clicking this button opens the Loaded Tags and Symbols dialog box, 
where you can load various tags.
Leader  The ﬁnal three options relate to the tag leader. You can select the Leader check 
box (or turn it off) to have a leader show (or not show). Although attached leaders are the 
default for tags, the Leader drop-down can be changed from Attached End to Free End if 
you don’t want to associate the end of the leader with the element you’ve selected. Using 
the Free End option allows the leader to ﬂoat free of the object. The ﬁnal option of this set 
for leaders is the default leader length. By default, the value is set to 1/2″ (12 mm). When 
you’re placing tags like wall tags that have leaders perpendicular to the wall they are 
tagging, it is a good idea to set a default length with which you are comfortable. You can 
adjust the tag location after inserting them, but sometimes it’s easier to set a good default 
value in leader length.
Like Keynotes from the previous section, annotation tags can be pinned. A pinned tag will 
retain its location even if the element it has tagged has been relocated. This can be beneﬁcial to 
keep small changes to elements from impacting several views prior to a deadline, but it can be 
equally problematic by allowing elements that have been dramatically changed to look incor-
rectly tagged.
Using the Tag Toolset
On the Annotate tab, you’ll ﬁnd several tools that you can use to insert tags. Look back at  
Figure 19.24 to see these tools. Each has a different purpose and can be used in conjunction with 
other tools or separately to help document your project. Let’s take a look at several important 
tools on the Annotate tab.
Tag By Category  The Tag By Category button is possibly one of the most frequently used 
Tag commands. As we mentioned before, several tags are available, allowing you to tag a 
host of elements in the model. Click the Tag By Category button when you want to tag one 
element at a time, regardless of its category.
Using this tag command will allow you to select a door, a window, a wall—whatever 
single element you want to apply a tag to in the model. As you hover over elements, the 
tag type that corresponds to that element will be shown. Should the element you are try-
ing to tag not have the associated tag loaded in the project, you will be prompted to load it 
(Figure 19.27).
Figure 19.27 
Loading a tag for a spe-
ciﬁc element type

822 | CHAPTER 19 ANNOTATING YOUR DESIGN 
Tag All  The Tag All button, which activates the Tag All Not Tagged command, will do 
exactly that: tag all the untagged elements of a selected category within a given view. For 
example, you can tag all the doors. Or you can tag all doors, walls, and rooms—or any 
combination of any list of elements. When you select the Tag All command, the Tag All Not 
Tagged dialog box will appear (Figure 19.28). This dialog box displays a list of the elements in 
the view for which you have already loaded tags. Here, you can specify which elements can 
get tagged, what tag will be used, and if that tag will have a leader assigned to it. Use the Ctrl 
key on your keyboard to select more than one element from the list. When you’ve selected 
the categories you would like tagged, click OK.
Figure 19.28 
Tag All Not Tagged 
dialog box
Tagging all the elements within a view can be a wonderful time-saver—but only if you’re 
OK with the software choosing the location for each of the tags. For example, the tags will 
be placed in the middle of the rooms. For most spaces, that will work just ﬁne. For other tag 
types, such as walls or doors, you might have to adjust tag locations to make sure everything 
reads properly.
Room Tag and Area Tag  These two tag types work in much the same way. They will tag the 
room elements or area elements, depending on the type of view in which you happen to be. In 
other words, room tags will work only in plans and elevations, whereas area tags can be placed 
only in area plans. To tag rooms or areas, simply select the tag type you want and select the room 
or area object. When you place rooms or areas initially, the tag option is selected by default.
Material Tag  The material tag is used to annotate speciﬁc materials within a model ele-
ment, similar to the Material keynote. The main difference from the keynote is that the tag 
does not use an external TXT ﬁle to read additional information about the tagged element. 

ANNOTATING WITH TAGS | 823
The default material tag will display the Material Description value (Figure 19.29, left) as 
opposed to the Keynote value. You can always customize the material tag to display other 
values such as the Mark, as shown in Figure 19.29 (right).
Figure 19.29 
Two options for tag-
ging materials
Multi-Category Tag  The multi-category tag allows you to use the same tag style in a proj-
ect to tag elements of different categories. This tag type can be useful in a number of ways. 
Let’s say you want to tag several elements in a ﬂoor plan and call out their manufacturer and 
unit cost. Typically, you would have to create a few different tag families to tag furniture, 
casework, lighting, and so on. However, the multi-category tag can do this for you by tagging 
the same ﬁeld (such as manufacturer or unit cost) across different element types. Let’s step 
through making a multi-category tag.
From the book’s web page, download the c19-Sample-Building-Start.rvt or c19-Sample-
Metric-Start.rvt ﬁle or continue with the exercise ﬁle from the previous section. Then follow 
these steps:
1. Activate the Level 1 ﬂoor plan.
2. Click the Application menu and choose New ➢ Family. This will take you to the default 
family templates. Open the Annotations folder and choose Multi-Category Tag.rft or 
Metric Multi-Category Tag.rft.
3. In the Family Editor, go to the Create tab and select the Label tool. Click near the intersec-
tion of the reference planes in the view to place a label.
4. Once the label is placed in the view, the Edit Label dialog box opens (Figure 19.30). 
Here you’ll see a list of the parameters that are common across multiple family types—
Assembly Code, Cost, Family Name, and Model, among others. Select Manufacturer 
and Cost from the list and click the icon with the green arrow to add them to the Label 
Parameters list. Make sure the Manufacturer parameter is above the Cost parameter (you 
can do this by selecting Manufacturer and then the Move Parameter Up button). Select 
the Break option in the Manufacturer row. Click OK to close the dialog box.

5. Save the family as MfrCost.rfa and then click the Load Into Project button in the ribbon. 
If you have multiple project ﬁles open, select the c19-Sample-Building-Start.rvt proj-
ect ﬁle when prompted.
6. Back in the project ﬁle, switch to the Annotate tab in the ribbon, locate the Tag panel, 
and then click the Multi-Category button. Click one of the chairs in the space named 
LOUNGE. When the tag is placed, you will see a question mark, indicating that this ele-
ment has no predeﬁned value for either Manufacturer or Cost. Press the Esc key twice or 
click Modify to exit the Tag command, select the tag you just placed, and then click the 
question mark.
7. The Change Parameter Values dialog box (Figure 19.31) opens. This dialog box is used 
only when a tag has multiple parameters assigned to a single label. Otherwise, you would 
usually be able to type a value directly into a tag. Enter values for both Manufacturer and 
Cost; then click OK. You’ll get a dialog box stating that you’re changing a type parameter 
that could affect many other elements. Click Yes and then OK to accept that change.

ADDING DIMENSIONS | 825
8. As you hover your mouse over other elements in this view, you’ll notice the same behav-
ior as with other tags. Elements that have predeﬁned values will show the tag ﬁlled in 
while elements without values will have question marks. Add a few more tags, and you 
can begin to see some of the versatility of the multi-category tag.
Adding Dimensions
Dimensions are used to convey the distance or angle between elements or parts of elements. In 
Revit, a dimension is a bidirectional annotation, which means you can edit the distance directly 
within the dimension string to move elements a speciﬁc distance apart and the dimension 
updates automatically as the distance between elements changes. Dimensions are annotations, 
making them view-speciﬁc elements that appear only in the view in which they’re drawn. The 
Dimension tools are located on the Annotate tab.
Like all annotations in Revit, dimensions will automatically adjust to the scale of the view. 
If you change the view scale, the dimensions automatically resize. By default, a Linear dimen-
sion string can only be created between parallel entities. Nonparallel elements by their very 
nature have a dynamic dimensional relationship. Dimensions in Revit Architecture always read 
from the bottom or from the right, following standard architectural sheet layout conventions.
To place a dimension, choose any Dimension tool and begin selecting multiple entities. You can 
keep selecting multiple entities in any sequence, creating a dimension string across your view. Click 
anywhere in an open area of the view to ﬁnish selecting entities and place the dimension string.
When any Dimension tool is active, you will see two settings available in the Options bar 
that are speciﬁcally related to walls. The ﬁrst drop-down list allows you to specify the default 
method for dimensioning wall geometry. You can choose from wall centerlines, wall faces, cen-
ter of core, or faces of core. This setting merely establishes the defaults—what will be selected 
when you ﬁrst click a wall with the Dimension tool. If you need to select a different part of a 
wall, hover the mouse cursor over a wall segment and then press the Tab key to cycle through 
the available options. Each part of the wall segment geometry will highlight at the mouse 
pointer as you continue to repeatedly press the Tab key.
The second option allows you to pick either individual references (default) or entire walls. When 
the Entire Walls option is selected, click the Options button to modify the Auto Dimension settings, 
shown in Figure 19.32. In this example, we have chosen to dimension opening widths as well as 
intersecting walls. The dimension string shown was placed with a single click on the exterior wall!

Once a dimension string is placed, you have several options to customize the string, the 
dimension values, and the witness lines (the linework that makes up the dimension). In 
Figure 19.33, you can see a typical aligned dimension string that has been selected after place-
ment. Let’s take a look at each of the available controls.

Dimension Value Grip  To adjust the position of any of the dimension values, especially 
for shorter dimension strings where the value might overlap the witness lines, click and drag 
the dimension value grip to relocate the text. The leader settings associated with dimension 
values are found in the dimension type properties. If you need to reset the position of the 
dimension value, right-click the dimension string and select Reset Dimension Text Position 
from the context menu.
Extension Line Grip  The predeﬁned distance that separates the dimensioned object from 
the beginning of the extension line is speciﬁed in the dimension type properties as Witness 
Line Gap To Element; however, you may need to manually adjust the extension line in some 
circumstances. Click and drag the extension line grip, and you will also notice that the grip 

ADDING DIMENSIONS | 827
will snap into place near the predeﬁned distance if you need to return the extension line to 
its original gap distance.
Witness Line Grip  The grip on each extension line that is closer to the dimension string is 
the witness line grip. This control allows you to move the witness line to a different entity. 
Click and drag this control to another object in the project and the dimension string will 
automatically update.
Dimension Value Constraint  The lock symbol allows you to preserve a dimension value so 
that it cannot be changed unless the constraint is removed. This functionality can be used to 
preserve dimension values for minimum widths of corridors, ﬂoor-to-ﬂoor heights, and other 
special features of your designs. As powerful as this feature is, you should use it only when 
absolutely necessary, because an overly constrained model can create problems you may have 
difﬁculty unraveling. Remember, with great power comes great responsibility.
Dimension Equality Toggle  Another powerful control included with dimensions is the 
ability to set all the values of a selected dimension string to be equal. And because the 
dimension is a bidirectional annotation, the model elements associated with the dimensions 
will be spaced equally as well.
Using Dimension Equality
When you choose to use the dimension equality toggle, there are a few unique options to 
customize how the values are displayed. In the type properties of a dimension style, you can 
specify the default text displayed as well as a formula and how the witness lines are displayed 
(Figure 19.34).
Figure 19.34 
Equality settings in the 
dimension style type 
properties
When you click the Equality Formula button, you can specify a customized string of values 
to best express the intention of the equality and how those values will be shown on the dimen-
sion string. In the example shown in Figure 19.35, the parameters Number Of Segments, Length 
Of Segment, and Total Length are selected with sufﬁx symbols to display the complete result in 
the dimension string, as shown at the bottom of the ﬁgure.

828 | CHAPTER 19 ANNOTATING YOUR DESIGN 
Customizing Dimension Text
One of the main beneﬁts of dimensions in Revit Architecture is that they cannot be overridden 
to display a different length or angle other than what is actually being measured. This may 
come as a shock if you have used Autodesk® AutoCAD® software in your past experience, but 
this restriction is necessary to maintain the integrity of the building information model.
Even though you cannot override the value of the dimension, you have the ability to either 
append some text to a dimension value or override the length or angle with a text string. To 
access these settings, double-click any dimension string to open the Dimension Text dialog 
box. In the example shown in Figure 19.36, the text HOLD has been added to appear below the 
dimension string, indicating that the dimension is to be maintained during construction.
Figure 19.35

equality formula

ADDING DIMENSIONS | 829
You’ll notice the option Replace With Text at the top of the Dimension Text dialog box. You 
might think you can override the dimension value with a string representing another length or 
angle value, but a warning will prevent you from entering any numeric values.
The Replace With Text option can be used to indicate various conditions for the purpose  
of construction tolerances. For example, you may have a series of similar conditions where 
new construction abuts existing conditions and you simply want the dimension to display 
VARIES, as shown in Figure 19.37.

Using Dimensions to Modify Geometry
We have trained hundreds of new Revit Architecture users through the years, and one of the most 
misunderstood concepts is how to use dimensions to modify model geometry. We just discussed the 
method for customizing dimension text, but users often will use this same method to make a change 
to model elements. Tis results in frustration when all you get is the Dimension Text dialog box.
To develop a clearer understanding of this concept, remember that a simple dimension string is a 
measurement between two objects. If you select the dimension, the software does not know which

Editing Dimension Strings
As you continue to annotate your project with dimensions, you will likely need to edit dimen-
sion strings to combine, split, or add new witness lines. Most of these editing functions can be 
done with the Edit Witness Lines command. You will ﬁnd this command in the contextual rib-
bon when you select a dimension string in a view.
Let’s walk through each of these dimension-editing scenarios with some exercises.  
Download and open the ﬁle c19-Dimensions-Start.rvt or c19-Dimensions-Metric-Start.rvt  
from this book’s web page, and then follow these steps:
1. Activate the Level 1 ﬂoor plan and zoom in to the lower-left portion of the layout. You 
will see that some dimensions have already been placed and you will need to edit them 
(Figure 19.38).
object you are intending to move. Instead, pick the model element ﬁrst and then select an associ-
ated dimension to change its value, and the element will be moved.

5. Now select the upper dimension string labeled as B in the view and once again activate 
the Edit Witness Lines command.
6. Click each of the intersecting interior partitions to remove them from the dimension 
string. Click an open area of the view to complete the command, and the results should 
look like Figure 19.40.

to a dimension string
2. Select the lower dimension string (indicated as A in the view) and then click the Edit 
Witness Lines command in the contextual ribbon.
3. Click the next vertical wall segment to the right of the layout and then the corner point. 
You might need to press the Tab key to place the dimension on the outer face of the wall 
and to snap to the angled corner.
4. To complete this editing command, click an open area of the view. Do not press the Esc 
key or you will lose the edits you just made.
The results should look like Figure 19.39.

832 | CHAPTER 19 ANNOTATING YOUR DESIGN 
You can also delete any inner segment of a dimension string if you hover your mouse pointer 
over one segment in a dimension string and press the Tab key once. An individual segment will 
highlight; select this segment and then press the Delete key. Try this with the outer dimension 
segment from the previous exercise (Figure 19.41).

Using Alternate Units
Alternate Units allows you to show mixed Imperial and metric units within a single annotation. 
You can do this either to the right of the base dimension or below it. Just select one of the dimen-
sion strings and open its type properties. The Alternate Units settings are highlighted in  
Figure 19.42. Set Alternate Units to Below to show the alternate units below the dimension string.

ANNOTATING WITH PROJECT AND SHARED PARAMETERS | 833
Let’s explore how to use this tool:
1. Continuing from the previous exercise, select the dimension string B and click the Edit 
Type button in the Properties palette. You don’t want all the dimensions to show both 
sets of units, so click the Duplicate button and name the new dimension string Linear – 
3/32″ Arial I/M (Linear - 2.5mm M/I for the metric ﬁle).
2. In the same Type Properties dialog box, change Alternate Units to Below. Set 
Alternate Units Format to Millimeters in the Imperial ﬁle (Feet And Fractional Inches 
in the metric ﬁle). So that you know the other number is a measurement in an alter-
nate unit, in Alternate Units Sufﬁx add mm in the Imperial ﬁle. The settings will look 
like Figure 19.43.
3. Click OK to close the dialog box.

You’ll see the dimension string with Imperial units above and metric units below (Figure 19.44).

Annotating with Project and Shared Parameters
Every element in a project has a list of parameters. Some of these parameters, such as 
Assembly Code and Mark, are common parameters that are assigned to almost all object 
types. Others, such as Length, Height, and Volume, are unique to speciﬁc element types. 

834 | CHAPTER 19 ANNOTATING YOUR DESIGN 
Despite the plethora of default parameters, there are situations where you may need to add 
custom parameters to elements. These custom parameters, like the default ones, can be 
tagged and scheduled.
Depending on how you’d like to use a custom parameter, you can add them to your elements 
in a few ways.
 
◆
If all you want to do is schedule the new parameter, you have a couple of options.
 
◆
Add the parameter directly within the schedule itself. This will add a new parameter 
to your element family. Adding a parameter using this method adds it only to the 
element family in the schedule. For example, say you want to schedule the sound 
transmission class (STC) of a wall. You could add this property directly within the 
wall schedule and the new parameter would be available only to objects in the Walls 
category.
 
◆
Add the parameter to the project. Using this method, you can still schedule the new 
parameter, but you will have the option to add it to multiple categories. So, if you 
want to add a parameter for Unit Cost, you can add that to both your door and win-
dow categories at the same time.
 
◆
If you want to be able to both schedule and tag your parameter, you will need to create a 
shared parameter. This parameter is created as part of a separate ﬁle that is shared among 
the tag family, the element family, and the project. An example of this kind of tag might be 
for door security hardware. You can create a parameter that is assigned to a door family as 
well as a door tag that will allow you to designate whether a door has a card reader to gain 
entrance to a room.
In the following sections, we will discuss how to create both of these parameter types as well 
as the pros and cons of each.
Creating Project Parameters
You can create custom project parameters at any time in the project cycle. Depending on how 
you create the parameters, you can assign them to one or more element categories within the 
model. You can also assign them to elements that have already been created or to element cat-
egories for elements that you have yet to create.
The following steps will allow you to make a custom parameter that can be scheduled but 
not tagged. For this example, pretend you are working on an existing building and rework-
ing a space. Much of what is onsite will need to be demolished, but you would like to reuse all 
the elements that are salvageable. As you are documenting the existing conditions, you want 
to schedule the elements you want to keep. To do this, you’ll make a parameter called Reuse. 
Continue with the project ﬁle from the previous exercise (c19-Dimensions-Start.rvt or 
c19-Dimensions-Metric-Start.rvt).
To add a new project parameter, follow these steps:
1. Go to the Manage tab in the ribbon and click the Project Parameters button.
This will display the Project Parameters dialog box (Figure 19.45).

ANNOTATING WITH PROJECT AND SHARED PARAMETERS | 835
Figure 19.45 
Te Project Parameters 
dialog box
2. Click the Add button to open the Parameter Properties dialog box. Here you will be 
asked to deﬁne a list of properties for the new parameter.
Let’s step through what these selections will be (Figure 19.46 shows a view of the com-
pleted dialog box).
Figure 19.46

properties (shown 
with Hide Un-checked 
Categories selected)

836 | CHAPTER 19 ANNOTATING YOUR DESIGN 
3. Set Parameter Type to Project Parameter.
Choosing between project and shared parameter is the ﬁrst choice you’ll need to 
make. We’ll get to shared parameters later, so for now, leave it at the default of Project 
Parameter.
4. For Name, type Reuse. The name is used for describing the parameter as well as refer-
encing it in schedules and the Properties palette.
5. Leave the Discipline setting at Common.
The Discipline drop-down menu will give you a few choices: Common, Structural, 
Electrical, HVAC, Piping, and Energy.
6. Set Type Of Parameter to Yes/No.
This setting dictates the format or behavior of the parameter. As you can see in 
Figure 19.47, a variety of parameter types are available. It’s important to understand 
some of these options and, more speciﬁcally, their differences. If you start creating 
formulas with your parameters, you’ll quickly understand how important it is to use 
the proper type. For instance, you cannot multiply Angle × Volume. Text cannot be 
added to a formula. Integers do not have decimal values. Many of these values are 
easy to understand if you apply a bit of logic.
Figure 19.47 
Listing of available 
parameter types
7. For Type Or Instance, choose Instance. This setting controls the uniqueness of the param-
eter itself. Both parameter types can be mixed within a given family. In this example, use 
an instance parameter because you want to designate whether something is reusable on 
an element-by-element basis.
See Chapter 2, “Exploring the UI and Organizing Projects,” for more information on type 
and instance parameters.
8. For Group Parameter Under, choose Green Building Properties.

ANNOTATING WITH PROJECT AND SHARED PARAMETERS | 837
This setting is an organization tool. When you open your element properties, depending 
on how many parameters you add, you can develop quite a long list. This tool allows you 
to group new parameters into any given category.
9. In the list of categories, check the boxes for Doors, Furniture, and Windows.
Categories is the list of element types in which this new property will appear. This 
is where you deﬁne all the category types you’ll associate with the new parameter. 
Category selections are ﬂexible. If you decide you need to change categories after you cre-
ate your parameter, you can easily come back to the Project Parameters tool and modify 
your selection.
10. When you ﬁnish, click OK. This will take you back to the Project Parameters dialog box, 
where you can choose to add another parameter or, in our case, just click OK to exit 
completely.
Back in the model, you can now select a door (because it is one of the categories you chose) 
and see that you have added a Reuse parameter in the form of a check box to the bottom of the 
Properties list (Figure 19.48).
Figure 19.48 
Te Reuse parameter in 
the family
Now that you’ve created a custom parameter in the project, it’s even easier to create one while 
in a schedule. You can create a custom parameter while creating a schedule or after the fact 
by modifying one. To create a parameter in a schedule, click the New Parameter button in the 
Schedule Properties dialog box (Figure 19.49). Doing so opens the same dialog box that you see 
when you click the Project Parameter button, with the exception that the Categories selections 
will be grayed out because you can create parameters in schedules only for the element being 
scheduled.

838 | CHAPTER 19 ANNOTATING YOUR DESIGN 
Figure 19.49 
Adding a parameter 
while in a schedule
Creating Shared Parameters
When you want to schedule and tag a custom parameter, you will need to use shared param-
eters. Previously in this chapter, you learned that customized project parameters are useful 
for scheduling the STC rating on a wall. You can also use them to schedule which doors have 
security systems as part of the door hardware set, for example, or to specify which equipment in 
a lab will require special gases (oxygen, argon, and so forth). None of these parameters exist by 
default in any families, but they are all values that you might want to tag or schedule, depend-
ing on the type of project you are working on.
These parameters do not exist in any of the tags either, so in order to tag these parameters, 
you need to create them in both the tag and the element families.
Don’t worry—it’s not as complicated as it all sounds, but you will need to follow some steps 
fairly closely. Once you have added a shared parameter to your project, you cannot modify it. If 
you want to change it, you’ll need to delete it and add the parameter again. So it behooves you to 
make your choices thoughtfully.
Let’s look at the workﬂow behind creating a shared parameter. You’ll do this by creating a 
custom wall parameter called STC so you can tag the sound transmission class of the wall types. 
To get started, continue using the c19-Dimensions-Start.rvt or c19-Dimensions-Metric-
Start.rvt example from the previous exercise.
Creating the Shared Parameter
The ﬁrst thing you do is create a new, shared parameter ﬁle. This ﬁle translates the values of the 
shared parameter between the tag, family, and project. Follow these steps:
1. To create a shared parameter, go to the Manage tab in the ribbon and click the Shared 
Parameters tool.
Doing so opens the Edit Shared Parameters dialog box (Figure 19.50).

ANNOTATING WITH PROJECT AND SHARED PARAMETERS | 839
Figure 19.50 
Creating the shared 
parameter
2. Click the Create button to open the Create Shared Parameter File dialog box. Name 
your shared parameter ﬁle. For our example, we’ve named it STC; however, if you plan 
to make more than one shared parameter, you might want to name it something more 
universal. All of the shared parameters for a given project will ultimately live in the 
same ﬁle. Give the ﬁle a name and location that will make sense to the project team. 
Then click Save.
3. Now that you’ve saved the TXT ﬁle, you’ll return to the Edit Shared Parameters window, 
where you’ll assign this parameter to a group by selecting New under the Groups option 
(this keeps like elements grouped together). This group is a hierarchical collection. So, for 
the wall’s STC, you will want to create a group called Wall Properties (Figure 19.51). This 
grouping allows you to easily sort different parameters within project categories. Once 
you name the group, click OK.
Figure 19.51 
Creating a shared 
parameter group

840 | CHAPTER 19 ANNOTATING YOUR DESIGN 
4. Once you have a group, you’ll see that the Parameters buttons are now active. Click the 
New button and name the parameter STC. Leave the Discipline setting at Common. For 
Type of Parameter, choose Integer. Because STC ratings are whole numbers, you can use 
the Integer type and eliminate any decimal places you’d have if you used Number as the 
type (Figure 19.52). Once you’ve entered the settings, click OK.
Figure 19.52 
Naming the parameter 
and setting the type
5. You should see the new STC parameter in the Edit Shared Parameters dialog box. Click 
OK to exit this dialog box.
You’ve now created a shared parameter. The next step is to assign it to a category.
Assigning the Shared Parameter to a Category
The shared parameter is now deﬁned, but you don’t have it associated with any categories yet. 
To do so, follow these steps:
1. From the Manage tab in the ribbon, click the Project Parameters button to open the 
Project Parameters dialog box. You want to add a new parameter, so click Add.
2. The Parameter Properties dialog box opens. This time, select the Shared Parameter radio 
button and then click Select. In the Shared Parameters dialog box, select the STC param-
eter you just created and then click OK. You’ll see that many of the ﬁelds are now grayed 
out in the Parameter Properties dialog box. This is because you have already speciﬁed 
this information in the shared parameter. In the Categories list, select Walls (Figure 19.53). 
Click OK to exit the dialog box.
3. You’ll see the new shared parameter (STC) below your previous project parameter 
(Reuse) in the Project Parameters dialog box (Figure 19.54). Click OK to close the  
dialog box.

4. Now that the STC parameter is part of the project, you can begin assigning values to it. 
Open the Level 1 ﬂoor plan and select one of the interior walls on the left side of the plan. 
By scrolling down in the Properties palette, you’ll notice that the STC parameter is now at 
the bottom (Figure 19.55). Enter a value of 45 and click Apply, or simply move your mouse 
out of the palette to set the value.

842 | CHAPTER 19 ANNOTATING YOUR DESIGN 
Tagging the Shared Parameter
So far, you’ve created a shared parameter and added it to the Walls category in a project. These 
are all features you could have leveraged with a project parameter. The beneﬁt of using a shared 
parameter is being able to tag it. The ﬁnal step in this process is creating a tag to display the  
STC parameter in the wall:
1. The ﬁrst thing you’ll need is a new tag. Because you’re tagging a wall and there isn’t a 
default wall tag type, you’ll need to make a generic tag and apply it to a wall condition. 
From the Application menu, select New ➢ Family. Open the Annotations folder, select 
Generic Tag.rfa, and click Open.
2. Next, you’ll assign the correct category to the tag. By default, a generic tag is just that: 
generic. You want it to report information from the Walls category, so on the Create tab, 
in the Properties area, click the Family Category And Parameters button.
3. With the Family Category And Parameters dialog box open, choose Wall Tags from the 
list (Figure 19.56), and click OK. Delete the red text note in the tag family template before 
continuing.
4. With the proper category selected, you need to add a label for your tag. From the Create 
tab in the ribbon, select the Label tool on the Text panel and then click just above the 
intersection of the two reference planes in the view.
5. In the Edit Label dialog box, select Type Mark from the list of category parameters and 
add it to the Label Parameters list to the right (Figure 19.57). This will call out the wall 
type and help you associate the proper wall with the STC rating. Click OK to close the 
dialog box and zoom in closer to the label you just placed.

the Edit Label dialog box, click the Add Parameter button at the bottom of the Category

Select to open the Shared Parameters dialog box. Select STC and click OK; then click 
OK again.

7. You’ll now see the STC parameter in the Category Parameters list. Select it and add it to 
the right side of the dialog box (Figure 19.59). Click OK to close the dialog box.
Figure 19.59 
Adding the STC  
parameter to the label
8. With all the labels added, you can brush up the tag with a bit of linework to help differ-
entiate the tag from the rest of the drawing. On the Create tab, choose the Line tool from 
the Detail panel. Using the default options, draw a box around the two labels and a line 
between them (Figure 19.60). Once this is done, save the family as Wall-STC.rfa and 
then load it into the project by clicking the Load Into Project button.

Te customized  
wall tag
9. Back in the project, you’re ready to tag the wall. Once you insert the tag into the project 
ﬁle, Revit will automatically begin the tagging command. However, the other way to 
begin tagging is to choose Tag By Category from the Annotate tab. Select the wall to 
which you have already given a value of 45 for the STC. You’ll see the wall type and STC 
rating populate within the tag (Figure 19.61).
Figure 19.61 
Te shared param-
eter now shows up 
in the tag within the 
project.
Once you’ve stepped through this workﬂow a few times, it will quickly become famil-
iar and you’ll be able to add custom parameters to projects and tag them without a second 
thought. One thing to keep in mind while you’re doing all this, however, is that once you have 
added a shared parameter to your project, you will not be able to change any of the properties 
of the parameter itself. If you set the parameter type to Integer but you really wanted Number, 
you’ll need to delete the parameter and start over. Also, when working with a team, remember 
that shared parameters work much like keynotes with their external TXT ﬁles. If you are shar-
ing the project ﬁle with the idea that it will be edited by another team, be sure to include the 
shared parameter ﬁle.

846 | CHAPTER 19 ANNOTATING YOUR DESIGN 
Shared Parameters Beyond Tagging
We have just ﬁnished a section on how to create your own shared parameters and use them to cre-
ate tags that are not part of the default Revit categories. But, as with all parameters, your use of 
shared parameters is not limited to only tagging. In one project, for example, we were designing 
a manufacturing facility. Tis facility had a large amount of process equipment, and the various 
pieces of equipment had special design needs such as argon and nitrogen gases, compressed air, or 
special electrical power. We wanted to tag the equipment in our drawings, but we also wanted an 
easy way to visualize which pieces of equipment needed what kinds of services.
To do this, we combined the shared parameter ﬁle we created for the tags and used color ﬁlters 
(discussed in Chapter 11, “Working with Phasing, Groups, and Design Options”) to color the equip-
ment in plan and help the design teams make sure we were supplying the right services to the 
right elements.
Te Bottom Line
Annotate with text and keynotes.  Although a picture is worth a thousand words, you 
still need notes to make drawings understandable and be able to call out key elements 
in each view. Know how to create and modify text and keynotes for a complete set of 
documents.
Master It  To properly use the keynoting feature, you’ll need to understand what each of 
the three keynote types do and how they’re used. List each, and explain how they can be 
used in a project.
Use tags.  Tags are text labels for elements such as doors, walls, windows, rooms, and sev-
eral other objects that architects typically need to reference in a set of drawings. These tags 
typically refer to other schedules or information in other portions of the drawing set and are 
unique to the view in which they are inserted.
Master It  Inserting tags quickly can be a good way to make documentation time more 
efﬁcient. How can you quickly tag a number of elements in the model at the same time?

THE BOTTOM LINE | 847
Add dimensions.  Dimensioning is a critical part of the project documentation, allowing 
you to communicate the distance elements are from one another.
Master It  Adding dimensions is a necessary part in any project. However, in a project 
workﬂow you will typically want to change the location of a dimension’s witness line 
without having to re-create the entire dimension. How do you move a witness line with-
out remaking the entire dimension?
Set project and shared parameters.  Revit Architecture lets users add as many custom 
parameters to an element as are needed to document the project. These parameters can be 
both tagged and scheduled, depending on how they are made.
Master It  You need to add a custom parameter for your project to track the percentage 
of recycled content in materials. What’s the best way to go about doing this?

 Part 6 
 Construction and 
Beyond 
 In the previous chapters, we focused on the architect’s role in design and construction using 
Autodesk® Revit® software. As the software continues to expand beyond being a tool for design 
documentation, we want to touch on several other uses outside the traditional scope of the 
designer. In the chapters in Part 6, we discuss how Revit can be used to augment design and 
documentation after construction documents are complete. 
◆ Chapter  20 : Working in the Construction Phase 
◆ Chapter  21 : Presenting Your Design 
◆ Chapter  22 : Design Analysis 


 Chapter  20 
 Working in the Construction Phase   
 In this chapter, we will explore the use of Autodesk® Revit® software in the construction 
phase by design teams and builders. For Architecture design teams, the use of Revit usually 
entails markups, sketches, and revision management; however, a builder may approach building 
information modeling (BIM) tools in unique ways. Many different BIM programs are available 
for builders to use in preconstruction and construction phase tasks, so we will not assume that 
Revit is the primary tool used by the majority of them.

Model for construction 
 Using Revisions in Your Project 
 Revisions allow designers and builders to track changes made to a set of construction docu-
ments during the construction phase of a project. Because the construction documents usu-
ally consist of numerous sheets, this methodology allows everyone on the team to track and 
identify which changes were made and when they were made during construction. The 
purpose is not only to ensure correct construction but also to create  as-built documentation 
recording how the building was actually created to be delivered to building owners upon 
occupancy. 
 In a typical drawing set, revisions will look like Figure  20.1 when they are created and 
issued as part of the drawing set. Revision clouds are created within views that are placed on 
sheets. The revision tag is also placed within the view, but once the view is placed on a sheet, 
the revision will dynamically appear in the sheet properties and on any revision schedule on 
the sheet.  
 Creating a Revision Cloud 
 To create a revision cloud in your project, switch to the Annotate tab in the ribbon, locate the 
Detail panel, and then choose Revision Cloud. This places you in a revision cloud drawing 
mode, similar to Sketch mode, and allows you to bubble the revised detail or drawing. When

you ﬁnish, click the green check mark to complete the sketch and your annotation is done. We’ll 
step through this in more detail later in this chapter.
You will usually have several rounds of revisions to a document set. Revit provides a way to 
manage the revision list and gives you the ability to name and date the various revisions in your 
project to better track them. The Sheet Issues/Revisions tool is located in two places within the 
application. You can ﬁnd it on either the View tab in the Sheet Composition panel or the Manage 
tab under Additional Settings.
Either one of these buttons will open the Sheet Issues/Revisions dialog box (Figure 20.2). 
Here you can add, merge, issue, and deﬁne the visibility of revisions.

USING REVISIONS IN YOUR PROJECT | 853
Figure 20.2 
Te Sheet Issues/
Revisions dialog box
Before you begin creating revisions in your sheet set, it’s good to start with this dialog box 
to give those revisions some order. Let’s review the major components of the Sheet Issues/
Revisions dialog box, beginning with the table of revisions.
Table of Revisions  The Sheet Issues/Revisions dialog box starts with one default revision 
already in place, even though you may not have made a revision yet. This is only to give you 
a place to start—no revision will appear in your title blocks until you add revision clouds to 
your views. Each revision has a ﬁxed number of parameters that you can enter. As you can see 
in Figure 20.2, the parameters include Numbering, Date, Description, and an Issued check box 
in addition to Issued To and Issued By columns and options for showing clouds and tags.
Numbering (Table Column)  The Numbering option allows you to number each revision 
numerically, alphabetically, or not at all. If you choose an alphabetic sequence, the sequence 
is deﬁned in the Customize Numbering Options. In the Numbering Options box in the lower 
right, choose either Numeric or Alphanumeric to set your sequence and remove letters you 
don’t want to use. For instance, some ﬁrms don’t use the letters I and O because they are 
often confused with the numbers 1 and 0, respectively. Figure 20.3 shows a sample of the 
dialog box. By default, an entire alphabet appears here. The None option allows you to add 
project milestones—unnumbered entries that appear in revision tables—to sheets without 
having to add revision clouds.
Date and Description  Both of these ﬁelds are user-driven only. The date is not tied to any 
functionality within Revit, nor is the description—both are simple text ﬁelds. However, both 
ﬁelds will schedule as part of your revision table on your sheets and are useful in organizing 
and tracking your revisions.
Issued  To issue a revision, click the check box in the Issued column. Doing so locks the 
revision clouds and tags placed on sheets or in views associated with that revision, prevent-
ing them from being moved, deleted, or otherwise edited. The parameter values in the dialog 
box become inactive. This is to guarantee that the clouds and data do not change down-
stream once you issue a set of drawings.

Customize Numbering 
Options allows you to 
use any order of letters 
or numbers.
Revisions in a Live Model
During the construction process, the project model may still be changing. When you issue a revi-
sion, keep in mind that although the clouds can become ﬁxed in the project, the model will not be 
static. As you continue to make revisions to the model, it will always be up to date. Tis means you 
might have multiple revisions in the same location on your sheet set. So if you need to maintain 
an archive of all project phases or each revision, be sure to export the sheets as either DWF or PDF 
ﬁles as a snapshot of the sheets at time of issue.
Issued To/Issued By  You may enter notes to the project team in these ﬁelds for whom the 
revisions are to be issued and who issued them.
Show  This table column controls the visibility of revision clouds and revision tags that 
have been issued. As issues occur, you may want to hide just the clouds or just the tags from 
previous revisions. For example, if you’ve issued one revision and then add revisions to a 
later issue and want to clean up your drawing, you can choose to show the issued revision as 
the tag only—typically a small triangle with the revision number inside it—or not show any-
thing at all by using the None option.
Add Button  This function is used to create a new revision. The new revision will automati-
cally be placed in sequential order, and only the sequence number will be automatically 
updated. You’ll need to add your own description and date.
Numbering (Radio Buttons)  You can choose to number revisions by sheet or by proj-
ect. This is a global setting for the whole project, but one can be swapped for the other at 
any point. Which method you choose mainly depends on how your ﬁrm chooses to track 

USING REVISIONS IN YOUR PROJECT | 855
revisions. The Per Sheet setting allows you to have as many revisions as you want within 
the drawing set, but on each sheet, the list of revisions will remain sequential. For example, 
an issue named “Issued for Design Development” may be revision number 4 on one sheet 
and number 7 on another. Using the Per Project setting will order your revision clouds based 
on the sequence established in the Sheet Issues/Revisions dialog box. In other words, all 
revisions with the same issue date would have the same revision number regardless of how 
many revisions appear on any given sheet. This approach might give you a greater degree of 
consistency throughout your document set but may limit the number of overall revisions you 
can use in the project. Either numbering method can be conﬁgured in advance and added to 
your project template.
Placing Revision Clouds
If you want to place a revision, open a view in which changes to the project have occurred and 
use the Revision Cloud tool found in the Detail panel on the Annotate tab. Use the familiar 
sketching tools from the Draw panel in the contextual tab of the ribbon to generate a cloud 
around the area you are calling out as a revision. The tool automatically starts with the Box 
command, allowing you to draw a box around your revision. If you’d like something more ﬂuid, 
you can switch to the Line tool on the Draw panel. Lines are automatically created that make a 
cloud (or series of arcs), as shown in Figure 20.4. The size of the arcs will be determined by the 
Arc Length setting found in the Sheet Issues/Revisions dialog box described in the previous 
section. When you ﬁnish creating the cloud, click the Finish Sketch button (the green check 
mark) in the contextual tab of the ribbon. Note that the Revision cloud tool doesn’t require you 
to form a closed loop—you can ﬁnish the sketch at any point.
Figure 20.4 
Adding a revision 
cloud to a view
By default, each new revision cloud will be assigned to the last revision in the Sheet Issues/
Revisions dialog box. If you need to change the revision to which a cloud is assigned, select the 
cloud and use the Properties palette to modify its revision number (Figure 20.5).

856 | CHAPTER 20 WORKING IN THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE

Te revision cloud’s 
issue assignment can

Properties palette.
Revision Clouds in a Live Model
During the construction process, the project model may still be changing. As you create revisions, 
you might need to create more than one within the same view or sheet. Where you place the revi-
sion cloud can be as important as the revision itself. For instance, do you place it within the view 
or on the sheet? As a best practice, we suggest you place the revision in the location where the 
content is changing. So, if you’re modifying a ﬂashing detail, place the revision bubble in the view. 
If you’re changing the name of the detail on the sheet, place it on the sheet itself. Tis will help you 
downstream, when you make another change to that same view or element.
As soon as you have placed a revision cloud on a sheet, any revision schedules placed in your 
title block will update to include the revision number, description, and the date you assigned in 
the Sheet Issues/Revisions dialog box earlier (Figure 20.6).

USING REVISIONS IN YOUR PROJECT | 857
Like other objects, the graphics for revision clouds are controlled from the Object Styles 
dialog box, found in the Settings panel on the Manage tab. Settings for revisions are located on 
the Annotation Objects tab. The default setting for the line thickness is 1. We recommend you 
increase the default thickness for revisions in your project template to more clearly illustrate and 
communicate your design modiﬁcations.
Tagging a Revision Cloud
Revision clouds can be tagged like many other elements. Similar to other tags, revision tags are intel-
ligent and designed to report the revision number or letter that has been assigned to the revision 
cloud. To place a revision tag, use the Tag By Category tool in the Tag panel on the Annotate tab.
If a tag for revisions is not in your template, you will be warned that no such tag exists in your 
project. To continue, simply load a revision tag. The default tag is named Revision Tag.rfa and 
is located in the Annotations folder of the family library within a standard installation.
Once you have a tag loaded, you are ready to tag revision clouds. Hover the cursor over a revi-
sion cloud and click to place the tag. You will see a preview of the tag prior to placing it (Figure 20.7). 
Once the tag is placed, you can drag it around the cloud to reposition it and turn the leader on and 
off. With or without a leader, the revision tag will stay associated with the cloud.
Figure 20.7 
Tagging a revision 
cloud
Disabling the Leader
You can choose to use a leader line between the tag and the cloud, depending on your prefer-
ence or your ofﬁce standards. In many cases, the tag just needs to be near the cloud and a leader 
is not necessary. Disable the leader by selecting the tag and clearing the Leader option in the 
Options bar. It’s good to note here that if your ﬁrm’s standards are to hide the cloud and you 
have the leader activated, you’ll see the revision tag plus the leader but no cloud since the leader 
and tag are connected.
BIM and Supplemental Drawings
Te process of making supplemental drawings (SDs)—also known as supplemental sketches (SKs)—
entails making a change to an existing drawing and then issuing that change as a separate document 
during the construction process. Sometimes this can be a single 8 1/2″ × 11″ [A4] or 11″ × 17″ [A3] 
sheet where the new detail is then pasted over the old one in the document set. From a workﬂow 
perspective, this can be a little disruptive for two reasons.
 
◆
Placing a view into a smaller sheet to issue the individual view can lead to other problems. 
Because there is only one instance of the view, it requires you to take the view off your 
Construction Document sheet to place the view in a new sheet. Te problem is that the new 
continues

858 | CHAPTER 20 WORKING IN THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE 
sheet/detail is meant to replace a portion of your original document set, so your set is now 
out of sequence. You will need to remove the view from the sheet it was issued on temporarily 
(and remember to put it back) or duplicate the view and hope that you do not need to make 
last-minute additional changes.
 
◆
A supplemental drawing, once issued, is like a snapshot in time. It becomes a numbered change 
made to the drawing set at a given date. Because the model and all the views in the model always 
reﬂect the most current state of the project, making separate SD sheets and views within Revit 
will show any additional changes made to that view.
As an alternative, you can reissue the full sheet. Tis is easiest for a Revit workﬂow, but it depends 
on your ﬁrm’s standards for supplemental drawings.

Using Digital Markups
Both Autodesk® A360 (www.autodesk360.com) and Autodesk® Design Review offer an efﬁcient 
way to view and mark up 2D digital documents and 3D models. This workﬂow is different from 
revisions and is geared more toward informal design review rather than the management of 
sheet issues. For example, if your drawings must be reviewed for quality control and overall 
comments by a senior designer who might not be familiar with Revit software, this tool can 
streamline the process. The senior designer, consultant, or any other third party can make com-
ments and review changes directly in the digital ﬁle and return them to the Revit Architecture 
user who needs to modify the original model.
In this section, we’re going to focus on the use of Design Review for DWF markups. Both 
applications are capable of this workﬂow. Think of the A360 tool as an online version of the 
DWF markup tool. It additionally has many powerful collaboration tools to help the overall proj-
ect process—markups are only a portion of what the tool does. Feel free to explore A360 to see 
the full effect it can have on team collaboration.
Using Design Review, you can view ﬁles in DWFx or DWF format. If you export sheets to 
DWFx and the markups are linked back into Revit, the markups will be automatically placed on 
the corresponding sheet. So there is no need on your part for any sort of alignment or placement 
of the revisions.
Design Review is a free tool that you can download from the Autodesk website at www.autodesk 
.com/products/design-review/overview. Once it’s installed, you can open and mark up any 
DWFx or DWF ﬁle produced by any Autodesk or other CAD/BIM software package.
Publishing to Design Review
There are two ways to share your model using Design Review: as 2D drawings or as a 3D model. 
If you publish to 3D, you create a single 3D representation of your model that can be orbited, that can 
control visibility of element categories, and that can be queried for the properties of any of the ele-
ments. Publishing to 2D can create either a single view or a whole collection of interconnected views 
and sheets packaged as one ﬁle. You can even combine 2D views and a 3D model in one DWFx ﬁle.
Exporting DWFx Files
You can export to DWFx from any view, except a schedule. To export your views or sheets, select 
the Application menu and choose Export ➣ DWF/DWFx. The DWF Export Settings dialog box 
(Figure 20.8) will open. Here you can choose views/sheets to export in addition to specifying 
how the results will be published.

USING DIGITAL MARKUPS | 859
Figure 20.8 
Te DWF Export 
Settings dialog box
In the following exercise, you will open a Revit ﬁle and create a DWFx ﬁle for review:
1. Open the c20-Sample-Building-Start.rvt model, which can be downloaded from this 
book’s web page, www.sybex.com/go/masteringrevit2018.
2. Open Sheet A101 from the sheet list in the Project Browser. Click the Application menu 
and select Export ➣ DWF/DWFx to open the dialog box shown in Figure 20.8.
3. Click the New Set icon at the top of the list of views and name the set MASTERING 
SHEETS.
Once you create the set, you will see a new drop-down list appear in the dialog box; you 
can use it to control which views are displayed in the view list (Figure 20.9).
Figure 20.9 
Te Show In List drop-
down is available only 
with a view set.
4. From the Show In List drop-down, select Sheets In The Model, and then select sheets 
A101 and A102.
These sheets will be added to the set to be published.
You can sort the list of views by any of the columns by clicking a column header. Try this 
by clicking the Name header.

860 | CHAPTER 20 WORKING IN THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE 
5. To check the export size, select the DWF Properties tab and click the Print Setup button. In 
the resulting dialog box, you can set explicit sizes for your export. Click the option Use Sheet 
Size to automatically detect sheet sizes based on the title blocks you are using in the project.
This dialog box mirrors the one used for printing.
6. Click Next and specify the name of the ﬁle and a location in which to save it. Make sure 
you check the box to combine all sheets into a single DWFx ﬁle (see Figure 20.10).
Figure 20.10 
Manual ﬁle naming 
is available when you 
combine views for 
publishing.
7. Open the published DWFx ﬁle in Autodesk Design Review. Choose the Markup & 
Measure tab, and then add a few comments and markups on the A101 sheet.
Using the Shapes and Draw tools on this tab, you can add clouds, arrows, and text to insert 
your comments or changes into the drawings. This can be done in a variety of colors and line 
weights to give them extra visibility on the page. Once all your changes are created, save the ﬁle, 
and it will retain all your changes. Figure 20.11 shows an example of a markup.
Figure 20.11 
A marked-up DWFx ﬁle

USING DIGITAL MARKUPS | 861
Importing a Design Review Markup
Once you’ve added markups to the DWFx ﬁle, save the ﬁle and close Design Review. You can 
then link the marked-up DWFx ﬁle back into the RVT project ﬁle. Continue to use the sample 
ﬁle from the previous exercise. You can also download the ﬁle c20-Sample-MarkedUp.dwfx 
from this book’s web page. This ﬁle already contains some markups to use in the following exer-
cise. Perform these steps to import the marked-up ﬁle into the project ﬁle:
1. On the Insert tab, choose DWF Markup from the Link panel and then select the DWFx ﬁle 
you saved in the previous exercise.
This is a simple import dialog box. There are no settings in the window.
When you select a DWFx ﬁle, only the markups will be shown—not the entire DWFx ﬁle. 
If there are no markups in the ﬁle, nothing will be visible in Revit.
2. In the next dialog box (Figure 20.12), you will see the views in the DWFx ﬁle that contain 
markups and the sheets in the Revit project to which they will coordinate. You can insert 
all the markups or only speciﬁc sheets. Select the sheets you’d like to import; be sure to 
select A101, and then click OK.
Figure 20.12 
Sheets with associated 
markups are shown.
3. Open sheet A101 from the Project Browser, and you will see the markup as an overlay in 
the same location where it was created in Design Review (Figure 20.13).
Markups can be linked only to sheets. If you export a view and mark it up, you will not be 
able to link that view back into the model. Also, none of the other linework from the DWF will 
link into the model—any of the building geometry, backgrounds, sheet content, and so on. The 
only thing that will be visible in Revit is content created with the DWF Markup tool.

862 | CHAPTER 20 WORKING IN THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE 
Figure 20.13 
Te marked-up sheet 
linked into Revit
You cannot move or delete linked DWF markups. They appear with a pin if selected; how-
ever, you can do a number of things to graphically indicate that you’ve reviewed a markup.
Change its graphic appearance.  Let’s say you have 20 redline markups on your sheet. You 
need to keep track of which ones you’ve picked up. One way to do this is to graphically over-
ride each markup as you make the requested modiﬁcations. Select the markup, right-click, 
choose View ➣ By Element, and click Override Graphics. Choose a color to indicate “done.” 
Yellow works well because it suggests a highlight marker.
Hide it.  This approach is similar to the graphic override, but you hide the markup alto-
gether. Select the markup, right-click, and choose Hide In View ➣ Element.
Remove it.  You can remove markups by choosing Manage Links from the Manage tab. In 
the Manage Links dialog box, select the DWF Markups tab, select the markup, and click the 
Remove button. This removes all markups associated with the link.
Another way you can interact with a linked DWF ﬁle is by modifying the status or append-
ing comments to each markup. You can access these features in the Properties palette when you 
select a markup, as follows:
1. In the A101 sheet view, select one of the markups you created and go to the Properties 
palette.
2. Change the Status drop-down list to Done and then click the Edit button in the Notes 
ﬁeld. In the Edit Text dialog box, enter some text related to the completion of the design 
modiﬁcation requested in the markup (Figure 20.14).

ties of the markup
3. Click the Apply button at the bottom of the Properties palette or move the mouse pointer 
out of the Properties palette.
4. Switch to the Insert tab in the ribbon, and from the Link panel choose Manage Links. 
Select the DWF Markups tab.
5. Select the row containing the DWFx ﬁle you linked in the previous steps; then click the 
Save Markups button at the bottom left of the dialog box.
There is no alert or notiﬁcation that the save process has completed, so just wait a few 
seconds.
6. Click OK to close the Manage Links dialog box.
7. Open the DWFx ﬁle again in Design Review, and you will see that the status of the mark-
ups has been updated.
The comments you added can be seen in the Markup Properties palette (Figure 20.15).

ties of the markup

864 | CHAPTER 20 WORKING IN THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE 
Using the DWFx ﬁle format along with the integrated tools within Revit, you have closed a 
communication and coordination loop that has traditionally been an area of difﬁculty. This 
workﬂow also beneﬁts larger project teams because you don’t have to manage a central pile of 
drawing markups that need to be shared or distributed among several teammates. All the staff 
working on a project will have access to the same linked DWF markups.
Modeling for Construction
Now that we have reviewed some basic functionality a design team might use during the con-
struction phase, let’s take a look at how a builder (contractor, subcontractor, or construction 
manager) might use Revit in the industry today.
Revit is often referred to as a design application; however, contractors are using the software 
more frequently as both a model-authoring and project-analysis tool. Although builders use 
BIM tools to obtain different results than design professionals do, many of the processes and 
functions are the same; they are merely applied in particular ways according to the needs of the 
various users.
Functionality introduced back in Revit Architecture 2012 supports a more interactive and 
ﬂexible approach to construction modeling. The ﬁrst addition was the ability to create parts, 
which are individual subsets of more complex layered elements such as walls and ﬂoors. The 
other addition allowed you to generate assemblies, which are segregated subsets of the project 
model with their own associated views, annotations, and sheets. These tools are used to take 
large elements and break them down into smaller components as they’d be used on the job site. 
As an example, in an architectural model, a cast-in-place concrete ﬂoor would be a single ele-
ment for the entire ﬂoor plate. In practice, the contractor would never pour the ﬂoor that way. 
The concrete would be poured in a series of pads, and the contractor would have to divide 
the slab into those series of pours for his or her schedule. The potential to minimize data loss 
between the design and construction stakeholders of a project can start to change how we 
approach collaboration and delivery of our buildings.
Creating Parts
Parts are designed to aid the user in subdividing larger model elements into smaller compo-
nents for construction planning. Each part maintains a persistent relationship with the elements 
from which it was derived, and it can be subdivided into smaller parts if necessary. Parts can be 
generated from walls, ﬂoors, ceilings, and roofs, as long as they are of consistent thickness. They 
also have their own properties, such as volume, area, and height; as such, they can be scheduled 
independently of their original elements.
While it is likely that designers will use parts to customize architectural elements, we are 
going to discuss only the workﬂow intended for the builder. To get started with the basic work-
ﬂow for creating and dividing parts, follow these steps:
1. Open the ﬁle c20-Parts-Start.rvt or c20-Parts-Metric-Start.rvt, which you can 
download from this book’s web page.
2. Activate the Default 3D view if it isn’t already open.
Notice that each of the wall, ﬂoor, ceiling, and roof elements in this sample model is com-
posed of one object. A section box has been activated in this view that is exposing the 
layers within each element (Figure 20.16).

MODELING FOR CONSTRUCTION | 865
Figure 20.16 
Te beginning Parts 
model
3. Select the ﬂoor at Level 2. On the Create panel in the contextual tab of the ribbon, click 
the Create Parts button.
Notice that the original object has been visually replaced in the current view by the parts 
representing each layer of the ﬂoor assembly. It is still in the project model—it has not 
been deleted.
There is a new view property in the Properties palette named Parts Visibility whose 
default value is Show Parts. This means that if parts have been created for any object, 
they will be displayed instead of the original. This property can also be set to Show 
Original or Show Both.
4. In the Project Browser, right-click the Default 3D view and choose Duplicate View and 
then Duplicate. Rename the copy of the view Original Model.
5. Activate the view named Original Model. From the Properties palette, ﬁnd the Parts 
Visibility parameter and change it to Show Original.
6. In the Project Browser, rename the {3D} view to Parts Model.
7. Activate the Parts Model view, and repeat the process of creating parts for the wall, the 
ceilings, and the roof in the sample model. Simply select each of these elements and 
choose the Parts tool from the context menu as before.

866 | CHAPTER 20 WORKING IN THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE 
In the previous exercise, you created an alternative way to view your model that begins to 
explore constructability. Without additional modiﬁcation, you can start to interact with these 
individual components by examining their properties or even hiding them or overriding their 
graphic display.
Modifying Parts
In addition to creating parts from original model elements, you can divide these parts into 
smaller ones. You can even change the phasing properties at the part level and use grips to 
modify the extents of the parts. Let’s begin with an exercise to divide some parts using planes 
and sketched lines:
1. Go back to the Parts Model view and select the top part of the roof at the Roof level.
This will be the layer representing insulation.
2. From the Part panel in the contextual ribbon, click Divide Parts.
You will enter Sketch mode, where you can either select an intersecting datum or draw 
your own dividing lines.
3. Click the Intersecting References button in the contextual ribbon. You are presented 
with the Intersecting Named References dialog box (Figure 20.17). From the Filter 
drop-down list, select All and notice that you can choose from levels, grids, and 
named reference planes.
Note that if a reference plane has not been named, it will not appear in this list.
Figure 20.17 
You can use a datum 
as one way to divide 
parts.

MODELING FOR CONSTRUCTION | 867
4. Check the boxes for the two reference planes named xPlane1 and yPlane1. Click OK to 
close the dialog box. You’ll see two green datum objects highlight in the model.
5. Click the green check mark in the contextual ribbon to ﬁnish Edit mode.
After you complete the process for dividing the part, notice that the part has now become 
four separate pieces. To experiment with how the parts maintain their relationship to the 
original object as well as the intersecting reference planes, go to the Level 1 ﬂoor plan 
and move the reference planes around, but try to keep them within the boundary of the 
sample ﬂoor. When you return to the 3D view, you will see that the divisions stay syn-
chronized with the reference planes.
6. Activate the ceiling plan for Level 1. In the Properties palette for the view, change Parts 
Visibility to Show Parts. Select the Gypsum Wall Board part on the bottom of the ceiling 
below the Level 2 ﬂoor.
Graphically, this will look like you’re selecting the entire ceiling because it will all high-
light blue.
You can make sure you have the correct part selected by examining the Properties pal-
ette. The category ﬁlter at the top should display Parts (1), and the Material parameter 
should indicate Gypsum Wall Board – Ceiling (Figure 20.18).
Figure 20.18 
Verify your selection of 
the gypsum ceiling by 
making sure you have 
Parts (1) selected and 
the material is Gypsum 
Wall Board.
7. Click the Divide Parts button in the contextual ribbon; then click the Edit Sketch button to 
activate Sketch mode. Draw a diagonal line across the part from left to right, as shown in 
Figure 20.19.
If you need to sketch lines to divide parts, the lines do not have to be in closed loops, but 
they must intersect the boundaries of the part. Keep in mind that if the original element 
is edited so that its boundaries extend beyond any sketched part divisions, the part divi-
sions will be deleted.
8. Click the green check mark in the contextual ribbon to ﬁnish the sketch; then click it 
again to ﬁnish the part-dividing mode.
9. Activate the Parts Model view, and orbit the model so you can select the inside face of the 
wall. Select the part of the wall that would represent the gypsum wall board at the inte-
rior face of Level 2.

868 | CHAPTER 20 WORKING IN THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE

Sketch a line to 
divide a part.
10. From the Properties palette, ﬁnd the Show Shape Handles parameter and check the 
box. You will see triangular shape handles on all four sides of the part, as shown in 
Figure 20.20. Drag the top shape handle down to indicate that the gypsum wall board is 
not to be installed to the full height of the wall assembly.
Figure 20.20 
Use the Properties 
palette to enable shape 
handles for parts.

MODELING FOR CONSTRUCTION | 869
There are several other ways you can interact with parts in your project model. Select any of 
the parts and observe the Properties palette. You will see that you can override each part’s mate-
rial, phase created, and phase demolished (Figure 20.21).
Figure 20.21 
Some part properties 
can be overridden.
Using Parts
So far in this chapter, you’ve seen how you can use parts to subdivide building elements such as 
walls and ﬂoors. While the workﬂow outlined can take away from quickly laying out walls and 
ﬂoors, the Parts tool is useful if leveraged correctly. As an example, one use for the Parts tool 
would be to deﬁne precast panels. In many instances, the precast paneling follows architectural 
grid lines. Controlling those with hosted voids or sweeps can be cumbersome and lead to a lot of 
manual coordination. Hosted sweeps can also be problematic around windows or other openings 
in the panels. Tis workﬂow would allow you to dynamically update the design and have it resonate 
through the documents quickly and clean up more easily than sweeps.
Knowing when to make use of a tool in Revit is almost as important as knowing how to use the 
tool. Tools like parts that allow a granular manipulation of building geometry are typically better 
left until later in the design process.
Dividing Parts with a Gap
In the previous exercise, you learned how to divide parts using datum objects and simple 
sketches. You also have the ability to divide parts with a deﬁned gap as well as with a custom 
proﬁle. Let’s explore these options with another exercise:
1. Continue to work with the sample ﬁle c20-Parts-Start.rvt or c20-Parts-Metric-
Start.rvt from the previous exercise. Activate the Parts Model 3D view and orbit the 
model to view the exterior face of the wall.
2. Select the main part of the exterior wall face that has the material assignment Concrete, 
Precast. Click the Divide Parts tool in the contextual ribbon.
3. In the Properties palette, set the Divider Gap parameter to 1″ (25 mm).
4. Click the Intersecting References tool in the ribbon, set the ﬁlter to All, and then select 
Level 2, Reference Plane: yPlane1, and Grid: 1. Click OK to close the dialog box.
5. Click the green check mark in the ribbon to ﬁnish Divide Parts mode, and the panel will 
be divided with a continuous gap, as shown in Figure 20.22.

870 | CHAPTER 20 WORKING IN THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE 
Figure 20.22 
Parts divided with a 
continuous gap
In addition to simple gaps, parts can be divided with a custom proﬁle. A family template 
called Division Profile.rft (Metric Division Profile.rft) is available in the default 
family template library. This proﬁle family is similar to other proﬁles except that the com-
pleted sketch in the family does not need to be a closed loop. That said, the sketch must 
extend completely between the two reference planes associated with the Width parameter in 
the template.
A number of division proﬁles are loaded in the default architectural project template. You 
can ﬁnd these in the Project Browser under Families ➣ Division Proﬁles. To examine how any of 
these are created, right-click Tapered Notch and select Edit from the context menu.
Let’s explore how you can edit an existing division and apply a custom proﬁle to the gap. 
Follow these steps:
1. Continue to work with the project ﬁle c20-Parts-Start.rvt or c20-Parts-Metric-
Start.rvt from the previous exercise. Activate the Parts Model 3D view, and orbit the 
model to view the exterior face of the wall.
2. Select any one of the divided parts of the main precast concrete portion of the wall. Once 
a part has been divided, you won’t need to select all the parts to edit the division—select 
just one. From the contextual ribbon, click Edit Division.
3. In the Properties palette, change the Division Proﬁle parameter to Angled Step: Angled 
Step. Once you select a proﬁle type, additional parameters are available in the Properties 
palette. Set the Edge Match parameter to Complementary (Figure 20.23).

MODELING FOR CONSTRUCTION | 871
Figure 20.23 
Assigning a division 
proﬁle to a part
4. Click the green check mark in the ribbon to ﬁnish the division edits, and you will see that 
the updated proﬁles are applied to all edges of the divided parts (Figure 20.24).
Figure 20.24 
Parts divided with a 
division proﬁle
5. To explore different functionality with division proﬁles, repeat steps 2 through 4, but 
select the proﬁle Notch and set the Edge Match parameter to Mirrored. Observe the 
change in behavior using a different matching property.
When you apply a custom proﬁle to a division of parts, the proﬁle is applied to all divi-
sions. If you need to assign different proﬁles to different divisions, you must apply each 
of those unique divisions separately. Let’s try this approach by continuing the exercise.
6. In the Parts Model view, select any of the precast concrete parts you generated earlier in 
this exercise. Click Edit Division in the contextual ribbon.
7. Click the Intersecting References button in the ribbon, and in the Intersecting Named 
References dialog box, set the Filter drop-down to All, and then deselect Reference

8. Click OK to close the dialog box and then click the green check mark in the ribbon to ﬁn-
ish editing the division.
9. While pressing the Ctrl key, select the two larger precast concrete panels to the right side 
of the wall. Click the Divide Parts button in the ribbon.
10. Click the Intersecting References button in the ribbon, set the Filter drop-down to All, 
and then select Reference Plane: yPlane1. Click OK to close the dialog box.
11. In the Properties palette, set the Divider Gap parameter to 0″–1″ (25 mm). Click the green 
check mark in the ribbon to ﬁnish editing the division.
You will now see that the custom proﬁle was maintained for the other part divisions, but the 
rightmost vertical division has only a simple gap.
Merging Parts
Parts can be merged to form larger, more contiguous geometry; however, the parts to be merged 
must have the same material and the same creation and demolition phases, and the merged 
geometry must consist of a single connected component. Parts with gaps assigned to the divi-
sions will not be merged.
To merge parts, press the Ctrl key while selecting multiple parts. In the contextual ribbon, 
click Merge Parts. Once parts have been merged, you can always edit them in the future. To edit 
merged parts, select the part and then select Edit Merged from the contextual ribbon.
Excluding Parts
Parts can also be excluded from a model to support more detailed construction conditions. To 
exclude a part, select the part and click Exclude Parts from the Exclude panel of the contextual 
ribbon. Excluded parts will not appear in any schedules; however, they are easily restored. 
To restore an excluded part, hover over the area with your mouse pointer where the part was 
excluded. You will be able to select the excluded part, but it will be indicated with a special icon. 
Click the icon on the excluded part or click Restore Parts in the contextual ribbon.
Be Aware of the Parts Category
Because parts are considered a separate category of elements, you should pay careful attention 
to how they might aﬀect your views and view templates. Take a look at the visibility and graphic 
overrides for any view, and you’ll see that Parts is listed as an object category. Tis means that 

MODELING FOR CONSTRUCTION | 873
once you create parts for a model element—whether the original object was a ﬂoor, ceiling, wall, 
or roof—the parts are all treated as a singular type of object. For example, if you have surface pat-
terns for ﬂoors hidden in a view and you create parts for a ﬂoor, the surface pattern will appear 
again unless you have hidden surface patterns for the Parts category as well.
Scheduling Parts
Another valuable aspect of using parts is the ability to schedule them—essentially a cleaner way 
to generate material takeoffs. You can create a parts schedule in the same manner as you would 
for other object categories. On the View tab, click Schedules ➣ Schedule/Quantities, and choose 
the Parts category.
Select the Fields tab of the Schedule Properties dialog box, and you will see the available 
ﬁelds (Figure 20.25). With a part schedule, you can report the original category of the object 
along with the part material and the usual geometric information.
Figure 20.25 
A part schedule has 
access to some unique 
ﬁelds for reporting.
There is also a ﬁeld named Construction that indicates whether the part was derived from 
a Core layer or a Finish layer. This ﬁeld can then be used as a ﬁlter and/or sorting criterion in 
your schedule. Figure 20.26 shows an example illustrating the results of a part schedule.
Creating Assemblies
An assembly organizes related elements within your project. The feature is designed to help 
users track and schedule a collection of elements as a single entity. In the case of precast con-
crete, for example, a column made of multiple families, including reinforcing bars, mounting 
hardware, and corbels, can be collected into a single assembly.

874 | CHAPTER 20 WORKING IN THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE 
Figure 20.26 
An example of a com-
pleted part schedule
As you identify objects to be included in an assembly, you can also choose from a variety of 
views in which to document the element in isolation from the rest of the project model. A collec-
tion of assembly views can be thought of as shop drawings. Let’s take a look at the workﬂow for 
creating an assembly.
In the following exercise, you can use any sample model to illustrate the process of creating 
assemblies:
1. In any view of your project, select a few model elements. Try to pick a few that are rela-
tively close to each other.
2. From the contextual tab in the ribbon, click Create Assembly. You will be prompted to 
name the new assembly (Figure 20.27).

MODELING FOR CONSTRUCTION | 875
Figure 20.27 
Enter a name for the 
new assembly.
Using Identical Assemblies
When you create a new assembly, the software automatically determines whether an identical 
assembly exists in your model. If one exists, the new assembly inherits the name of the identical 
assembly. In a somewhat similar situation, if you were to create copies of an assembly throughout 
your project, the matching assemblies would function in a similar way to how groups function. 
Te fundamental diﬀerence between assemblies and groups is in the propagation of changes. If 
you have identical assemblies in a project and you change one of them, the name of the modiﬁed 
assembly is changed and it is treated as a unique assembly.
Creating Assembly Views
After you have created an assembly, you can create a series of views that are dedicated to that 
assembly. In other words, you will see only the elements included in the assembly within these 
views. In addition to plans, sections, and 3D views, you can generate parts lists and quantity 
takeoffs for an assembly.
To generate assembly views, select an assembly in any view and select Create Views from 
the Assembly panel in the contextual tab of the ribbon. You are prompted with a dialog box in 
which you choose the views assigned to the assembly (Figure 20.28).
After you click OK, you will ﬁnd the assembly views at the bottom of the Project Browser. 
Under the Assemblies grouping, you will ﬁnd each assembly listed with all the associated views 
(Figure 20.29).
If you selected objects of different categories such as a wall and a ceiling, you have the oppor-
tunity to select which category the assembly will inherit. Choosing one category or the other 
does not seem to have an effect on the functionality beyond the organization that is exposed to 
the user.

Assembly views are

Although sections are automatically placed for the included elements, the individual views 
are not placed on the assembly sheet. To do this, activate the sheet within an assembly and then 
drag and drop the views onto the sheet. Note that assembly views can be used on nonassembly 
sheets and regular views can be placed on an assembly sheet. An example of views compiled 
into an assembly sheet is shown in Figure 20.30.

 Presenting Your Design   
Although Autodesk ® Revit ® software is most often used to create parametric content for docu-
mentation, it is often necessary to show designs to clients and other project stakeholders to 
make critical decisions. Revit has tools that you can use to embellish views or create new graph-
ics to help present the design. 
 In this chapter, you’ll learn to 
 
◆
Understand color ﬁ ll legends 
 
◆
 Use 3D model views in your presentation 
 
◆
Work with viewport types 
 
◆
Create “exploded” axonometric views 
 Understanding Color Fill Legends 
 There are many times in the design process when you will need to go beyond documentation 
for construction and portray spaces in a building in a different way. For example, you may 
need to communicate design intent, departmental adjacencies and allocations, or room ﬁ nishes. 
Because Revit software has these functions, you can use its parametric capabilities to do more 
than just generate annotation—you can graphically show all kinds of model parameters. 
 The tool for creating this kind of view is called the Color Fill Legend. You can use this tool to 
color areas and rooms in plans, sections, and elevations. It allows you to assign different colors 
to just about any of the room or area properties within a view. Here are just a few examples of 
the types of views you can create: 
 
◆
Floor plans showing departments. 
 
◆
 Floor plans showing spaces based on area value. An example might be rooms smaller than 
500 square feet (50 sq m) as one color, rooms that are between 500 and 1,000 square feet 
(50 sq m to 100 sq m) as another color, and rooms bigger than 1,000 square feet (100 sq m) as 
a third color. 
 
◆
 Building sections showing different departments in different colors as in a stacking diagram. 
 
◆
 Plans, sections, or elevations portraying room ﬁ nish types. 
 There is an almost endless list of the types of color ﬁ lls you can create to help communicate 
a wide variety of project-speciﬁ c details. The Color Fill Legend tool is located on the Color Fill 
panel of the Annotate tab (Figure  21.1 ).

880 | CHAPTER 21 PRESENTING YOUR DESIGN 
Figure 21.1 
Te Color Fill 
Legend tool
To better demonstrate some of the uses of the Color Fill Legend tool, let’s make a simple color 
ﬁll plan showing room types.
Making a Color Fill Legend for Rooms
In many projects, it becomes necessary to display plans with some additional information about 
the spaces. Typically during the design phases, clients need to see how different departments 
are located adjacent to one another. Even in a simple residential design, it can be helpful to see 
how public spaces such as kitchens and living areas are located relative to the more private 
spaces of bedrooms and bathrooms.
In the sample building project used in Chapter 18, “Documenting Your Design,” you may 
want to visually show the various space types in the ﬂoor plans. You want to graphically dem-
onstrate which spaces have been assigned to various departments deﬁned in the building’s pro-
gram of requirements. To get started, download and open the c21-Sample-Building-Start.rvt 
or c21-Sample-Metric.rvt model from the book’s web page, www.sybex.com/go/ 
masteringrevit2018. You will begin by creating a new type of ﬂoor plan that will help organize 
the Project Browser and automatically assign an appropriate view template.
To get started, follow these steps:
1. Switch to the View tab in the ribbon, locate the Create panel, and then choose Plan Views ➢ 
Floor Plans. In the New Floor Plan dialog box, click the Edit Type button to open the Type 
Properties dialog box for the Floor Plan type.
2. Click the Duplicate button and then name the new view type Color Fill.
3. Click the button in the parameter ﬁeld named View Template Applied To New Views. In 
the Apply View Template dialog box, select Color Fill Plans and then click OK to close the 
Type Properties dialog box.
4. Using the Ctrl key, select both Level 1 and Level 2 in the New Floor Plan dialog box and 
then click OK.
5. Return to the Project Browser, and you will see a new heading called Floor Plans (Color 
Fill). Change the names of the new ﬂoor plans to Level 1 - Dept - Color and Level 2 - 
Dept - Color.
6. Activate each of the new color ﬁll plans and use the Tag All Not Tagged tool to add room 
tags to each plan.
For more information on tagging, see Chapter 19, “Annotating Your Design.”
7. Open the Level 1 - Dept - Color ﬂoor plan and click the Color Fill Legend button in the 
Color Fill panel of the Annotate tab. This will activate the Color Fill Legend tool and ask 
you to place a legend somewhere in the active view. Anywhere for now is ﬁne—just place 
it to one side of the plan or the other.
Once the legend is placed, you can then deﬁne and customize its characteristics.

UNDERSTANDING COLOR FILL LEGENDS | 881
8. After the legend is placed, you’ll be presented with a dialog box similar to the one in 
Figure 21.2. This dialog box will prompt you to choose from a list of space types avail-
able in the current view and color schemes that have already been established within the 
model. From the Space Type drop-down list, select Rooms, and from the Color Scheme 
drop-down list, choose Name and click OK.
Figure 21.2 
Choose the space type 
and color scheme after 
you place the legend in 
a view.
The color scheme will automatically generate a legend based on your room names and 
color the rooms on the plan.
If you already created a color scheme that you wanted to use in this view, it would be 
a simple matter of selecting it from this list and clicking OK, and the legend and view 
would be complete. The default project template contains a few simple color schemes 
from which you can choose when you place your ﬁrst legend. You started with a basic 
one that automatically assigns a color for each unique room name in the project; however, 
this type of presentation is not usually that useful.
In the subsequent steps of the exercise, you will create different color schemes to further 
explore more complex methods of presentation.
9. After the legend is placed, you can then alter its properties or choose a different color 
scheme. To modify a legend, select the legend, and in the Modify | Color Fill Legends 
context menu, click the Edit Scheme button.
This opens the aptly named Edit Color Scheme dialog box (Figure 21.3). This dialog box 
allows you add, rename, or delete color schemes on the left side and deﬁne the graphic 
properties and attributes of these schemes on the right.
A drop-down list labeled Color at the top of the Scheme Deﬁnition area appears. This is 
the property by which the color scheme is being deﬁned. It is currently assigned to color 
the plan according to room name. Each unique room name in the project is automatically 
generating its own color for the legend.
10. From the list of schemes at the left, choose Department.
The Color drop-down list now indicates the Department parameter, but there are no 
values deﬁned in the list to the right. This is because text has not been added to the 
Department parameter for any of the room elements in the project.
Any parameter available to be used in a color ﬁll legend needs to have values in its prop-
erties. You can enter the value in the Properties palette either by selecting the item and 
ﬁnding that property or by predeﬁning values in the color scheme. In the following steps, 
you will predeﬁne values for the departments and then assign them to the rooms later.

11. Now let’s predeﬁne some values. At the left side of the table under Scheme Deﬁnition, 
click the green plus sign to add values to the color scheme for Department. Create four 
new values as follows:
 
◆
MANAGEMENT
 
◆
OPERATIONS
 
◆
PRODUCTION
 
◆
SALES
For now, you can use the automatic color and pattern assignments.
12. Click OK to close the dialog box.
You will notice in the ﬂoor plan that the legend now shows the title Department Legend 
and displays No Colors Deﬁned (Figure 21.4). Even though you deﬁned some Department 
values, they will not show on the legend until you assign values to the rooms placed in 
the project.

with no deﬁned color 
scheme
13. Back in the ﬂoor plan, select the Manager room on the lower left of the plan and look in 
the Properties palette. Find the Department property and click in the value ﬁeld to access 
a drop-down list (Figure 21.5).
The values available in the list are the values you added to the color scheme in step 5.

to room proper-
ties based on data 
assigned to a color

14. Assign the two rooms at the left side of the plan to the MANAGEMENT department, 
assign the LOUNGE space to the SALES department, and assign the SUPPORT space to 
the OPERATIONS department.
As you make these assignments, the color ﬁll legend will update, and the space will ﬁll 
with the matching color.
15. Activate the Level 2 - Dept - Color ﬂoor plan and repeat steps 7 through 14 to assign 
some department values.
Because you already created a color scheme deﬁned by department value, you don’t need to 
repeat steps 9 and 10.
Assigning Color Fills without a Legend
In the previous exercise, you generated color ﬁlls on a plan by adding a legend and then custom-
izing the color scheme through the legend. You don’t have to place a legend to color a plan with a 
color scheme. In the Properties palette for a view, you can ﬁnd the Color Scheme property. Click 
the button in the value row to open the Edit Color Scheme dialog box and choose a color scheme 
to be assigned to the view. Te plan will display the respective colors even without a legend shown 
on the view. You can always add a legend later by using the Legend tool in the Color Fill panel of 
the Annotate tab in the ribbon.

884 | CHAPTER 21 PRESENTING YOUR DESIGN 
Customizing a Color Fill Legend
Although the software automatically assigns colors to each value in a color scheme deﬁnition, 
you’ll likely want to change the colors or the ﬁll patterns to suit your presentation needs. In this 
section you will customize the color scheme and the legend created in the previous exercises. 
Because many ﬁrms typically have standards for presentation color schemes, it’s a good idea to 
add your customized schemes to your ofﬁce template.
In the following exercise you will create a copy of the department-based color scheme to use black 
line patterns instead of color ﬁlls. Download and open the ﬁle c21-Sample-Building2-Start.rvt 
or c21-Sample-Metric2-Start.rvt from the book’s web page. Then follow these steps:
1. Return to the Level 1 - Dept - Color ﬂoor plan you used for the exercise in the previous 
section. In the Project Browser, right-click Level 1 - Dept - Color and choose Duplicate 
With Detailing from the context menu. Rename the duplicated view Level 1 - Dept - 
Black. Repeat this process for the Level 2 - Dept - Color plan.
2. Activate the Level 1 - Dept - Black ﬂoor plan, select the legend located to the right  
of the plan, and click Edit Scheme in the ribbon to open the Edit Color Scheme  
dialog box.
3. Select Department from the list of schemes on the left side and click the Duplicate icon at 
the bottom of the list. Name the duplicate scheme Department (Black).
4. You can change any of the assigned colors by selecting any of the buttons in the Color 
column. Doing so opens the Color dialog box (Figure 21.6) and allows you to select colors 
based on RGB values or PANTONE colors. Change the colors for each of the departments 
to black (R:0, G:0, B:0) and then click OK.
Figure 21.6 
Click the button in the 
Color column to select 
a diﬀerent color.

UNDERSTANDING COLOR FILL LEGENDS | 885
After you have deﬁned the colors, take note of a couple of other features in the Edit 
Color Scheme dialog box, shown previously in Figure 21.3. The ﬁrst is the Options area 
at the bottom of the dialog box, which contains a single check box that allows you to 
pull values from linked projects. If you are working on a large building that is split into 
multiple ﬁles, this is a good way to tie all that information together into a single graphic 
presentation.
5. The other option you have is the ability to exclude various scheme deﬁnition values for 
a color scheme. Notice the Visible column next to the Value column in the scheme deﬁni-
tion, as shown in Figure 21.7.
Figure 21.7 
Use the Visible option 
to exclude values from 
the legend.
Uncheck the box in the Visible column next to the value for OPERATIONS. This setting 
will exclude the selected value wherever this color scheme is applied to a view. In this 
example, we might assume that the client does not need to see spaces that belong to the 
OPERATIONS department in color—just the remaining departmental spaces.
6. Click each of the ﬁelds under the Fill Pattern column to change the ﬁll pattern to a variety 
of line-based patterns, as shown in Figure 21.8.
Figure 21.8 
Te pattern for 
each value can be 
customized.
7. Click OK and you’ll notice that the color ﬁlls have dynamically changed to reﬂect the 
modiﬁcations you made in your color scheme properties, as shown in Figure 21.9.
8. Open the Level 2 - Dept - Black ﬂoor plan. In the Properties palette, locate the Color 
Scheme parameter and click the button in the value ﬁeld that is currently assigned to 
Department. In the Edit Color Scheme dialog box, choose the Department (Black) color 
scheme and click OK.
The pattern ﬁlls are automatically placed according to the department assignments. Also 
notice that spaces assigned to the OPERATIONS department are not colored, and the depart-
ment name does not appear in the legend because the Visible setting was turned off in step 5.

Figure 21.9 
Te ﬂoor plan after 
scheme colors and 
patterns are altered
Modifying Other Settings
By now, you’ve created a color ﬁll legend and placed it within a view, and you’ve seen a num-
ber of the settings and properties of the legend. Those settings reﬂect how the color ﬁll legend 
will look and react to the plan or view in which it’s placed, but there are other settings you can 
modify as well. The legend key itself has several properties that control fonts and swatch sizes. 
Select the legend and click the Edit Type button in the Properties palette to explore some of the 
other properties you can modify.
Figure 21.10 shows the type properties for a color ﬁll legend. In this dialog box, you can 
change the font size and type as well as the size of the color swatches that appear in the 
legend.
An important type property for color ﬁll legends is Values Displayed. The two options for 
this property are By View and All, and the default setting for color ﬁll legends is By View. 
You might have noticed that none of the spaces on Level 1 are assigned to the PRODUCTION 
department, so that value does not appear in the legend placed on Level 1.
Try creating a duplicate color legend type named All Values and change the Values 
Displayed property to All. This legend type shows all department names, regardless of the 
department assignments on each level. This setting does not override the Visible options you 
specify in the color scheme settings; therefore, the OPERATIONS department will still not dis-
play when you use the Department (Black) color scheme.
In summary, you can combine any color scheme with any color legend type—the two are not 
dependent on each other.

Don’t Forget Your Standards
It can take several tries between creating color ﬁll plans and printing them to get the colors just 
right. You’ll ﬁnd yourself making multiple adjustments along the way. When you have one that 
works for you, take the time for a couple of extra steps so you don’t have to re-create this work in 
the future.
First, if it is a type of project that you’ll be doing again and again, add the legend to your project 
template. Tis is as easy as placing the legend on a view and the view on a sheet (similar to a 
schedule) and copying it to the Clipboard. Open your project template (in the same instance of 
Revit) and paste it onto a sheet, and your settings, colors, and naming conventions will be quickly 
transferred and saved for future use.
Using Numerical Ranges for Color Schemes
In the previous exercises, you explored how to use color schemes to create presentation mate-
rial based on speciﬁc object properties. You can also create color schemes that display ranges of 
numerical values. In the following exercise, you will continue with the c21-Sample-Building 2 

888 | CHAPTER 21 PRESENTING YOUR DESIGN 
-Start.rvt or c21-Sample-Metric2-Start.rvtﬁle. With the Room color ﬁll legend deﬁned, 
you have seen an example of how to create color ﬁll legends. A variety of other legend types are 
available, and some of these types allow you to deﬁne your own parameters when creating the 
legend itself. Let’s step through this process again using a different legend type so you can see 
how you can deﬁne your own parameters in a color ﬁll legend.
The next color scheme you will create is based on areas. Whereas the Department color 
scheme was deﬁned by rooms that were already placed on plans, the area scheme is deﬁned by 
numerical ranges you will need to deﬁne within the color scheme properties. Follow these steps:
1. In the Project Browser, right-click the Level 1 - Dept - Black ﬂoor plan and choose Duplicate 
With Detailing from the context menu. Rename the duplicated plan Level 1 - Area Range. 
Select the color ﬁll legend in the view, and click Edit Scheme in the contextual tab of the 
ribbon.
2. In the Edit Color Scheme dialog box, create a copy of the Name color scheme, using the 
Duplicate icon at the bottom of the list. Name the new scheme Area Range. Also change 
the Title ﬁeld to Area Range.
3. From the Color drop-down list, choose Area. Click OK if you are presented with a warn-
ing about preserving colors.
You’ll notice that all the room names and colors will disappear; they are replaced with 
values representing each unique room area.
This type of schedule—like a schedule of room names—is probably not that useful as a 
presentation method. Instead, let’s create a series of colored area ranges to easily identify 
which spaces are within speciﬁc ranges.
4. Next to the Color drop-down list in the Scheme Deﬁnition ﬁeld, select the By Range 
option. The static area values in the list below are now split into two columns labeled At 
Least and Less Than (Figure 21.11).
Figure 21.11 
Select By Range to 
change the scheme 
deﬁnition.
5. Select one of the rows so the green plus button is active. Click that button two times so 
that you have four rows in the list of value ranges.
6. Starting from the bottom row, change the values to 800, 500, and 200, as shown in 
Figure 21.12.
You can also try changing some of the colors assigned to each of the value ranges to make 
the presentation more meaningful or simply easier to read.

ues in the Scheme

7. Click OK to update the color ﬁll scheme and view the results in the plan (Figure 21.13).
The rooms now have colors based on their sizes rather than their names.

8. In the Project Browser, right-click Level 2 - Dept - Black and choose Duplicate With 
Detailing from the context menu. Rename the duplicated view Level 2 - Area Range.
9. In the Level 2 - Area Range ﬂoor plan, select the existing color ﬁll legend and click Edit 
Scheme from the contextual tab in the ribbon. In the Edit Color Scheme dialog box, select 
Area Range and then click OK.
The rooms on Level 2 are now also represented with the same color range as we assigned for 
Level 1.
Program Verification with Color Fills
Another more advanced presentation technique can be achieved with color ﬁlls by using value 
ranges for veriﬁcation of your project’s program of requirements. We showed you how to create a 
color ﬁll scheme to illustrate ranges of spatial area; however, the results can be made even more 
useful for eﬀective decision-making.

890 | CHAPTER 21 PRESENTING YOUR DESIGN 
continued
Te Area property of rooms will always display the actual value of the enclosed space. To compare 
the actual or designed area with the required area, you must create and populate a user-deﬁned 
parameter. Tere are other applications that can accomplish this integration with Revit, including 
Trelligence Aﬃnity (www.trelligence.com) and dRofus (www.drofus.com); however, the ability 
of an external application to feed the required program areas into the Revit model is irrelevant. 
Te key is to compare the required area with the designed area and feed the diﬀerence into another 
user-deﬁned room parameter. Tis can be accomplished using the Revit application programming 
interface.
Once the diﬀerence in area is captured in a room parameter, a color scheme can be established to 
color the ranges in the diﬀerence. For example, if the designed area is divided by the required area, 
you will get a percentage that can be included in a color scheme range. Color the higher percentages 
(positive and negative) with a noticeably visible color and the lower percentages with a more subtle 
color. If the range of acceptable diﬀerences is between 95 percent and 105 percent of the required 
area, then that range can be assigned no color and no pattern.
Presenting with 3D Views
In addition to using 2D views such as plans, sections, and elevations to convey your design 
intent, you can present the 3D model in a variety of ways. In Chapter 12, “Visualization,” we 
discussed the methods for creating analytic and photorealistic visualizations; the following 
sections will help you to establish a new repertoire of presentation techniques for design and 
construction documents.
Orienting to Other Views
A quick and easy way to create more useful 3D views is by utilizing the Orient To View com-
mand. This command, which is somewhat hidden within the ViewCube®, allows you to create a 
3D view that mimics the settings of a 2D view.
In the following exercise, you will continue to use the c21-Sample-Building2-Start.rvt 
or c21-Sample-Metric-Start.rvt ﬁle. You will ﬁrst adjust the view range settings for the ﬂoor 
plans and then create a 3D view for each level. Finally, you will assemble the views on a sheet to 
complete the presentation.
1. Select Level 1 from the Project Browser and go to the Properties Palette to examine the 
view properties. Click the Edit button in the View Range property.
2. In the View Range dialog box (Figure 21.14), change the Top value under Primary Range 
to Level Above and set the corresponding offset value to –1′-8″ (–0.5 m). Repeat this step 
for Level 2.
Although you are changing the top of the view range of the ﬂoor plans, you will not see 
any difference in their graphic display.
3. Right-click the Default 3D view {3D} in the Project Browser and create two duplicates. 
Rename the duplicate views Box-Level 1 and Box-Level 2.

7. Create a new sheet using the title block in the project ﬁle, and drag the Box-Level 1 and 
Box-Level 2 views onto the sheet.
Place the Box-Level 2 view directly above the Box-Level 1 view and you’ll notice that the 
views will align vertically. You can align model views of various types on sheets as long 
as they are the same scale. This does not work for drafting views or perspective views.
You can continue to experiment with the view settings of these 3D views on the sheet. Even 
though the section boxes won’t print by default, you may want to hide them anyway. You can’t 
uncheck the Section Box property because the view would no longer be three-dimensionally 
cropped. To hide the section box, select the viewport and then click Activate View in the con-
textual tab in the ribbon. Select the section box, and from the contextual tab in the ribbon, click 
Hide In View (the light bulb icon) ➢ Hide Elements. Right-click and choose Deactivate View 
from the context menu and then repeat this process for the other 3D view.
Cutting to the Core
We have worked on many building projects in which there was a central core of vertical circula-
tion: stairs, elevators, and shafts. After years of legacy experience using 2D views to explore these 
complex yet isolated three-dimensional spaces, we found it diﬃcult to imagine an easier way to 
perform this design and coordination task.
Te ability to quickly generate a 3D view that is based on an enlarged stair plan or elevator shaft 
section has proven to be immensely valuable. Teaching this technique to the senior architects and 
engineers on your team will bring you plenty of praise! Tere’s even an app for that—the COINS 
Auto-Section Box add-in is a free download that can be found in the Autodesk Exchange app store 
(http://apps.exchange.autodesk.com). Te Auto-Section Box tool has become one of our 
most used add-ins.

PRESENTING WITH 3D VIEWS | 893
Annotating 3D Views
Once you add a 3D view to your sheets, you’re likely to want to annotate it. To add annotations 
to your 3D view, you ﬁrst need to lock it before you add text and tags as you would in a 2D view. 
This functionality is quite simple to implement.
In any orthographic 3D view, you will ﬁnd the Lock/Unlock View button in the view short-
cut bar, as shown in Figure 21.17. Once you lock the view, you can begin to add tags, text, and 
dimensions, but you cannot change the orientation of the view unless it is unlocked.
Figure 21.17 
Te 3D view can 
be locked from the 
view control bar.
In the example shown in Figure 21.18, a section box was ﬁrst applied to a 3D view and then 
annotated.
Figure 21.18 
Annotation can 
be applied to a 3D 
view with locked 
orientation.
Once you have added annotation to a view, you may need to rotate the view. Return to the 
locked view tool and click Unlock View. You are now free to orbit the 3D view; notice how 
your annotations orbit with your model. The annotations will appear a bit skewed as a result 
of this rotation. If you want to return the view to the originally saved orientation, click Restore 
Orientation And Lock View. The annotations will reappear in their original locations.

894 | CHAPTER 21 PRESENTING YOUR DESIGN 
Editing Viewport Types
In the previous exercises, you might have noticed that the 3D views placed on the sheet displayed 
the default view title; however, you don’t need the titles every time you place a view on a sheet. 
Options and properties related to the display of views on sheets are stored as viewport types. 
Although the name conjures up memories of model space and paper space in Autodesk® AutoCAD® 
software, it is actually quite different in Revit. The viewport does not determine the scale or any-
thing else about the view itself but simply sets the parameters for how a view sits on a sheet.
Let’s examine how to customize viewport types by completing an exercise that continues 
from the previous example of placing 3D views on a sheet.
1. Using the sheet with the two stacked 3D plan views created from the previous exercise, 
select one of the views and click Edit Type in the Properties palette.
The Type Properties dialog box appears (Figure 21.19).
Figure 21.19 
Te type properties 
of a viewport
There are only a few properties in a viewport type, most of which are related to the 
extension line in the title. You can change the View Title family selection in the Family 
drop-down list. However, in this exercise you will not need a view title. We’re going to 
create a new viewport type that does not use a title.
2. Click the Duplicate button to create a new viewport type named No Title.
3. Click the Show Title drop-down list and select No. Note that the Show Extension Line 
check box becomes grayed out.
Before you click OK to make the new type, let’s verify an important property in this dia-
log box. The Show Title property is set to When Multiple Viewports, which will display 
the titles only when multiple views are placed on a sheet. The view title is not displayed if 
only one view is placed on a sheet, as in an overall ﬂoor plan.
4. Click OK to close the Type Properties dialog box, and you’ll see that the viewport you 
had selected is already changed to the new type. Select the other viewport and switch it 
to No Title in the Type Selector.

CREATING “EXPLODED” AXONOMETRIC VIEWS | 895
When you have completed the exercise, you can also add some detail lines to the sheet to 
further embellish the descriptive presentation, as shown in Figure 21.20. Although you cannot 
snap to the geometry within the viewports, you can use the arrow keys to nudge the lines into 
alignment as required.
Figure 21.20

Creating “Exploded” Axonometric Views
A useful tool to help you present your designs in a unique way is the Displace Elements tool. 
This tool allows you to create an “exploded” axon, essentially allowing you to take the geometry 
of a 3D view and move it without impacting the model. In Figure 21.21, you can see the use of 
the Displace Elements tool on the left and the original model on the right. The displacement is 
view-speciﬁc, so in all other views the model integrity remains.
Figure 21.21 
Using the Displace 
Elements tool

896 | CHAPTER 21 PRESENTING YOUR DESIGN 
In this exercise, you’re going to continue using the c21-Sample-Building2-Start.rvt or 
c21-Sample-Metric2-Start.rvt ﬁle to create a displaced element. The Displace Elements tool 
is found on the Modify tab, and it is active when you select an object in a 3D view. It is located 
on the View panel in the upper-right corner.
You’ll start this exercise by creating a new view.
1. Take the Box-Level 1 view you created in the previous exercise and duplicate it. Rename 
the view Axon-Level 1.
2. With the new view established, you can change the orientation. Right-click the 
ViewCube, select Orient To A Direction, and select Southeast Isometric. Alternatively, you 
can select the corner of the ViewCube where the Front, Right, and Top sides connect.
Your starting view will look like Figure 21.22.
Figure 21.22 
Baseline view for the 
displaced elements
3. One thing that you’ll notice about this view is the section box. In other situations, the scope 
box would create a limit for what you could change because anything outside the  
scope box would effectively disappear within the view. Because the changes you are 
making using the Displace Elements tool are only view-speciﬁc and not actually manipu-
lating model content, you can leave the scope box where it is.
So that it doesn’t interfere with the view, however, you can turn it off. Right-click the 
scope box and choose Hide In View ➢ Element from the context menu.
4. Now, you can begin displacing elements. When using this tool, elements will be grouped 
based on selection. So, if you were to pick multiple elements and then displace them, they 
would all move together, keeping a relative distance to one another.
To demonstrate this, select both of the walls on the right of the view (Figure 21.23).

5. Select the Displace Elements tool from the View panel of the Modify tab. Both walls will 
remain highlighted now, but you’ll see a 3D control tool appear (Figure 21.24).
6. Grab the red control (the one that points to the lower right) and pull it away from the 
building. The walls should move in a plane parallel to their original position.
You’ll see the walls you selected visually unjoin from the building (Figure 21.25). If you were 
to move these walls without the use of this tool, you would receive error messages about 
rooms being unbound or elements being unjoined. None of that is happening because the 
changes you’re making are just view-speciﬁc and not impacting the actual model.

7. For the next displacement, select the three walls on the backside of the building  
(Figure 21.26). Select the Displace Elements tool again, and drag these using the green 
arrow (the one pointing to the upper right).
Figure 21.26 
Te second

CREATING “EXPLODED” AXONOMETRIC VIEWS | 899
Notice how the door moved without selecting it (instead the wall was selected) but the 
storefront system did not move. As you create these types of views, you’ll need to make 
sure you’re selecting all the elements you want to relocate. If you don’t get it exactly right, 
however, don’t worry. With these displaced walls highlighted, some new tools are active 
in the Modify | Displaced Elements tab: Edit, Reset, and Path. The Reset tool will undo 
the displacement you have created and reset the walls to their original locations.
8. To complete this step, you need to use the Edit button. Select Edit and notice how 
the view has changed. The elements within the displacement group are highlighted 
orange, and a new Edit Displacement Set panel has popped up that is similar to the 
Edit Groups panel.
9. In this view, choose Add from the Edit Displacement Set panel. Choose the storefront sys-
tem that you didn’t select in step 7 (Figure 21.27).
Figure 21.27 
Add the storefront wall 
to the displacement set.
It will immediately move to its proper location within the wall and turn orange like the 
rest of the set (Figure 21.28). Click Finish from the panel to exit this view.
Figure 21.28 
Displace the wall next 
to the stairs.
10. You’re going to make one more displacement: the wall to the right of the stairs. Select 
it, choose the Displace Elements tool, and move the wall away from the stairs just a bit 
(Figure 21.29).
11. With all the elements displaced for this view, we’re going to touch on one more 
tool. Highlight the ﬁrst set of walls you displaced and select the Path tool from the 
Displacement Set panel. With this tool selected, click the lower portions of the walls you 
moved. It creates a dashed line or a “path” that the walls are pulled out upon. This will 
help to add visual clues to the view so you can see the origin point of speciﬁc elements. 
Do this for the other elements you’ve displaced (Figure 21.30).

THE BOTTOM LINE | 901
In addition to moving building elements along their logical displacement plane, you can 
move them in any other direction if it increases the clarity of your 3D presentation. The 
path will be jogged for elements that are displaced out of plane.
12. The ﬁnal view with the paths and displaced elements will look like Figure 21.31.
Figure 21.31 
Te ﬁnished view
As with any other view in Revit, this view is parametric as well. Changes you make to 
elements within the model will update elements within this view and to the paths too.
If you now open the Default 3D view, you’ll see that the integrity of the model has not 
changed—all the building’s elements are exactly where you would expect them. You can even 
begin to experiment with making modiﬁcations to the walls you have displaced—add a door or 
a window and you can see that updated within the displaced view. You can quickly begin to see 
how useful this type of visualization can be.
Te Bottom Line
Understand color ﬁll legends.  Color ﬁlls are a great way to illustrate data that otherwise 
might appear only in a schedule, such as department assignment, designed areas, and room 
ﬁnishes.
Master It  There are a variety of ways to graphically display information using color 
ﬁlls. It can initially take a bit of time to get things organized, but once you create the leg-
ends, they can easily be transferred between views and projects. Describe how to add a 
color ﬁll legend, once created, to your project template.

 Design Analysis   
 In this chapter, we will take a further look at the Autodesk ® Revit ® conceptual design tools 
and how you can leverage them for sustainable design analysis. We’ll also explore a few other 
tools, some of which use building information modeling (BIM) geometry to support design 
analysis. 
 Most building design starts with some simple concepts and forms. Will the building be tall or 
long? Curved or rectilinear? How will those shapes affect sustainable design concepts like solar 
gain, daylighting, and energy consumption? To perform these kinds of analyses and explore the 
initial ideas for building form in Revit, we use masses. In the previous chapter, we discussed 
how to create several kinds of massing. In this chapter, we’ll explore a different type of mass 
called a  conceptual mass and use that to generate sustainable design analysis. 
 In this chapter, you’ll learn to 
 
◆
Embrace energy analysis concepts 
 
◆
 Analyze your model for energy performance 
 
◆
Analyze your model for daylighting performance 
 Analyzing for Sustainability 
 Environmentally thoughtful design strategies have been around for millennia, but the practice 
of sustainable design with quantiﬁ able metrics has seen substantial growth in the past decade. 
Sustainable design practices can help address many issues, among them energy use, access 
to natural daylight, human health and productivity, and resource conservation. One of the 
principal goals of sustainable design is to reduce a building’s overall resource use. This can be 
measured in the building’s carbon footprint ( www.architecture2030.org ) or the net amount of 
carbon dioxide emitted by a building through its energy use. 
 Before we delve into discussing any speciﬁ c workﬂ ows involving BIM and sustainable design 
analysis, it’s important to recognize that many concepts are both interdependent and cumula-
tive. The more sustainable methods you can incorporate into a project, the “greener” the project 
becomes. 
 Take the example of building orientation, glazing, and daylighting. Designing your building 
in the optimal orientation, using the right glass in the correct amount and location, and inte-
grating sunshading into the project to optimize the use of natural light all build on each other. 
Using these three strategies together makes a building operate more efﬁ ciently while allowing

occupants access to plenty of natural light. The amount of usable daylight you might capture 
will be greatly reduced with the application of highly reﬂective glass or if the building’s orienta-
tion is inappropriate for the geography. The appropriateness and beneﬁts of any of these indi-
vidual strategies depend on building type and climate.
Revit software has similar characteristics. Because it is a parametric modeler, all the parts are 
interrelated. Understanding and capitalizing on these relationships typically takes numerous 
iterations that span multiple projects. Optimizing the integrated strategies and technologies for 
a high-performance design requires an understanding of how they work together to deliver the 
best potential. That is where Revit comes in—allowing the ability to iterate and analyze faster 
than in a more traditional process. The process is built on the following methodology for reduc-
ing the energy consumption of buildings:
 
◆
Understand climate
 
◆
Reduce loads
 
◆
Use free energy
 
◆
Use efﬁcient systems
Understanding Energy Modeling
Understanding a building’s energy needs is paramount to helping the project become more 
sustainable and reducing costs throughout the building lifecycle. According to the U.S. Energy 
Information Administration (www.eia.doe.gov), as of March 2015 buildings in the United States 
account for 30 percent of the world’s energy consumption and 60 percent of the world’s electric-
ity use, making the United States the primary consumer of energy in the world (Figure 22.1).
Figure 22.1 
Energy use in the 
United States
U.S. Electrical Energy Consumption
Transportation
1%
Buildings
76%
Industry
23%
Within the United States, buildings consume nearly half (47 percent) of all energy produced 
in the United States and are responsible for more than 44 percent of CO2 emissions in the nation 
per year, exceeding emissions in the transportation sector (34 percent) and industrial sector  
(21 percent). (See architecture2030.org/about.) Architecture 2030 seeks to achieve a dramatic 
reduction in energy consumption and CO2 emissions by changing the way that buildings and 
communities are planned, designed, and built.
The Architecture 2030 Challenge was established in recognition of the signiﬁcant role that 
buildings play in the climate change crisis. Architecture 2030 established the 2030 Challenge, 
asking the global AEC community to adopt a series of CO2 emissions reduction targets and sus-
tainable building design strategies to ensure that all new buildings, developments, and renova-
tions are carbon-neutral by 2030.

ANALYZING FOR SUSTAINABILITY | 905
It is important to distinguish carbon-neutral from net-zero energy buildings. Net-zero build-
ings must produce as much energy onsite as the building consumes. In contrast, carbon-neutral 
buildings do not use fossil fuels or emit greenhouse gases. While this may sound impossible, 
there are intelligent and realistic design options to achieve sustainability targets, including 
optimizing building orientation, passive heating and cooling, and daylighting. These low-cost/
no-cost methods in combination with energy-efﬁcient technologies such as high-efﬁciency 
mechanical equipment, onsite renewable energy generation, and offsite renewable energy or 
credits can contribute to carbon-neutrality goals.
The design of new buildings and major renovations are targeted to meet a fossil fuel and 
energy performance standard of 70 percent below the regional average for the building type 
(derived from Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey [CBECS]). The fossil fuel 
reduction standard is then increased to 80 percent in 2020, 90 percent in 2025, and an ultimate 
target of carbon-neutral buildings by 2030.
The 2030 Challenge has been embraced by the AIA in the form of the AIA 2030 Commitment. 
Global architecture ﬁrms (nearly 400) have signed on to the commitment. A cornerstone of the 
commitment is energy modeling, which the AIA describes as playing a critical role in improving 
building design and building performance (as stated in the AIA 2014 progress report). Leading 
architecture ﬁrms recognize that in designing projects that meet the 2030 targets, they are providing 
their clients with the highest-quality, top-performing buildings at minimal or zero additional cost.
Using Revit for Energy Simulations
Energy simulation is key to meeting the 2030 Challenge and critical sustainable building design. 
Historically, one of the biggest barriers to successful discovery and implementation of sustainable 
design measures for buildings is the difﬁculty of getting informative energy simulation results 
early in the design process quickly and cheaply. A common approach to improving models for 
energy simulation has been to increase the precision of model inputs, requiring considerable effort 
and time. Even after signiﬁcant effort, the results are often still inaccurate when compared to real-
world buildings because errors due to uncertainties and operational variations are still present.
Revit now addresses these challenges with rapid energy simulation leveraging  
EnergyPlus and DOE 2 energy analysis engines with results presented in Autodesk Insight 
(insight360.autodesk.com).
The energy needs of a building depend on a number of issues that are not simply related to 
leaving the lights on in a room that you are no longer using, turning down the heat, or increasing 
the air-conditioning. Many of the components and systems within a building affect its energy 
use. For instance, if you increase the size of the windows on the south facade, you allow in more 
natural light and lower your need for electric lighting. However, without proper sunshading, you 
are also letting in additional solar heat gain, so those larger windows are increasing your need 
for air-conditioning and potentially negating the energy savings from reduced lighting.
In exploring the use of energy in a building, you must consider all energy-related issues, 
which is a good reason to use energy-simulation tools. These computer-based models use cli-
mate data coupled with building loads, such as the following:
 
◆
The heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system
 
◆
Solar heat gain
 
◆
The number of occupants and their activity levels
 
◆
Sunshading devices
 
◆
Daylight dimming
 
◆
Lighting levels

906 | CHAPTER 22 DESIGN ANALYSIS 
The energy model combines these factors to predict the building’s energy demands to help 
size the building’s HVAC system. It also combines the parameters of other components properly 
so you are not using a system larger than what you need, and you can understand the impact of 
your design on the environment. By keeping the energy model updated with the current design, 
you can begin to grasp how building massing, building envelopes, window locations, building 
orientation, and other parameters affect energy demands.
There are four ways you can use Revit Architecture software for energy analysis: concep-
tual massing, schematic/facade design, detailed modeling, or exporting to other applications 
(Figure 22.2). Let’s explore each of these workﬂows in a bit more detail.
Figure 22.2 
Ways of using Revit 
Architecture software 
for energy analysis
Conceptual/Massing Analysis  Conceptual or massing analysis allows you to analyze 
the energy consumption of the model directly within Revit. Using this workﬂow, you can 
analyze mass forms directly in the model and view energy simulation results within Insight 
(http://insight.autodesk.com). This is ideal for the following use cases:
 
◆
Early targeting and assessing feasibility, including feasibility of client goals and 
expectations
 
◆
Guiding early-stage architectural decisions such as geometry, orientation, window-to-wall 
ratio, shading, and materials to reduce energy consumption
 
◆
Meeting the requirements for the AIA 2030 Design Data Exchange (DDx) submittal, which 
is one of the steps to meeting the 2030 Challenge
 
◆
Exporting your model to gbXML, DOE2, or EnergyPlus formats for additional analysis
Schematic/Facade Design  By using a simple massing model, you can quickly apply curtain 
wall systems to mass faces using the Curtain System tool on the Model By Face panel of the 
Massing & Site tab. This workﬂow works best with massing objects rather than more reﬁned 
model data as it allows quick iterations of the building facade. This workﬂow is valuable in 
any of the previously mentioned cases, but would also include the following:
 
◆
Model content has more accurate settings for walls and exterior shading.
 
◆
It allows you to specify space and material thermal properties providing additional detail 
in the analysis.
Detailed Models  A detailed Revit model refers to the type of model you would have closer 
to the end of the construction documentation process. These models are richer in speciﬁc 

USING THE CONCEPTUAL ENERGY ANALYSIS TOOL | 907
materiality and other features that would change energy consumption. They also allow for 
the isolation of elements that are used in the creation of the energy model and resolution of 
missing elements or large “gaps” in the design. For instance, if a section of the building has 
unresolved design elements, you can still create a meaningful analysis by isolating that por-
tion of the building. The beneﬁts to this workﬂow include those listed earlier and the speciﬁ-
cation of space and material thermal properties.
Export  This workﬂow requires exporting a more detailed model to another application 
using the gbXML format (a standardized XML schema used for sustainable design analysis). 
Additional export options include INP and IDF for DOE 2 and EnergyPlus.
Numerous experiments with energy analysis throughout all the stages of model development 
reveal consistency in energy simulation results. Note that in Figure 22.3, the energy cost ranges 
have little variation from conceptual mass to more detailed models. Our point is that massing 
models with Insight is fast, simple, valuable, and worth exploring early in building design to 
guide design decisions, with continuous optimization as design progresses.
Figure 22.3 
Energy cost ranges in 
diﬀerent models
Regardless of your choice of analysis workﬂow, the ﬁrst step is to have accurate location and 
true north settings for your model. Without them, it is impossible to understand the localized 
energy performance. Once you have those established, you can approach energy analysis with 
conﬁdence. Let’s take a look at the process for generating a conceptual energy analysis.
Using the Conceptual Energy Analysis Tool
A conceptual energy analysis (CEA) tool has been part of the Revit software since 2009. This tool 
created a link to the online analysis service known as the Autodesk® Green Building Studio® 
web service. These tools have since evolved into Autodesk Insight, which leverages the DOE2 

908 | CHAPTER 22 DESIGN ANALYSIS 
and EnergyPlus simulation engines, providing millions of parametric simulations with results 
presented in interactive dashboards. The energy analysis results are generated quickly and pro-
vide the following:
 
◆
Estimate of energy use intensity (EUI) in kBtu/sf/year or kWh/m2/yr
 
◆
Energy operational cost estimate
 
◆
Benchmarking against Architecture 2030 and ASHRAE 90.1
 
◆
Interactive key performance indicators or building factors, rank-ordered by their relative 
inﬂuence on energy use and costs
 
◆
Ability to manipulate key performance factors and compare design options to drive 
toward desired energy outcomes
 
◆
Ability to report directly into the Architecture 2030 DDx, directly from Insight  
(www.aia.org/pages/5041-aia-2030-design-data-exchange-ddx)
In the following exercise, you will load a conceptual mass into a template project to run 
a series of energy analyses. There are ﬁve basic tools for conﬁguration, analysis, and com-
parison of results on the Analyze tab of the ribbon for both building elements and masses 
(Figure 22.4).

Accessing Insight
Accessing Revit’s Energy Tool, Insight, is available as a subscription beneﬁt of Revit and the AEC 
Collection. You will need an Autodesk login ID (A360 account) to access Insight. You can check to 
see whether you have an account already or create one at http://A360.autodesk.com.
Setting Up an Energy Analysis
Before you can run an analysis for either building elements or massing, you need to do a bit of 
conﬁguration to give your analysis engine some parameters. You’re going to use a building that 
is through schematic design. The building is a University Foundation building that serves as an 
ofﬁce space. You can download the ﬁle from the book’s companion web site: www.sybex.com/
go/masteringrevit2018. The model is c22-Analysis-Start.rvt.
Once the ﬁle is open, activate the Default 3D view. Spin the model around a bit and get orien-
tated so you’re familiar with the design. The building looks like Figure 22.5.

To begin the conﬁguration of the energy analysis settings, follow these steps:
1. Activate the Default 3D view, and in the view control bar, set Visual Style to Shaded. Turn 
Shadows on.
2. The next step is to establish the correct location of your project. On the Analyze tab, 
choose the Location tool. This will open the Location Weather And Site dialog box 
(Figure 22.6). Here you can ﬁnd your building location in a few ways. On the Location 
tab, you can either browse to the location using the map or enter the city name and search 
for the location. In our example, we’re going to use Boulder, CO, USA. Enter the city name 
in the Project Address ﬁeld and click Search.
Figure 22.6 
In Location Weather 
And Site, ﬁrst specify 
the location and 
weather station.

910 | CHAPTER 22 DESIGN ANALYSIS 
You can further reﬁne your location by dragging the red icon with the house shape 
around on the map. Finally, choose Use Daylight Saving Time if that is appropriate for 
your location. When you’ve made the selections, click OK to close the dialog box.
3. Next, on the Analyze tab, click Energy Settings. Energy settings drive the behavior of the 
energy model you will create and allow optional use of additional properties if speciﬁed, 
including materials and thermal spaces. Figure 22.7 shows the Energy Settings dialog 
box. We’re going to work our way down this dialog box, making sure you have the set-
tings correct. If settings are not changed, the defaults will be applied.
Figure 22.7 
Te Energy Settings 
dialog box
You’ll notice a lot of options in the Energy Settings dialog box—some of them quite complex.
4. In the Energy Settings dialog box, change the following values:
Mode  Revit offers three modes for creating the energy model. For all cases, you should 
use the mode Use Conceptual Masses and Building Elements because it includes more 
accurate thermal zoning capabilities and it will use the building type to create the 2030 
benchmark in Insight. Note that this mode supports masses, building elements, or com-
binations. A reason to not use this mode would be if you wanted to isolate certain geom-
etries from other components.
Ground Plane  This should be set to Level 1 so that the model assumes contact with the 
group for heat transfer.
The rest of the settings we are going to leave as they are, but let’s review them so you under-
stand their impact to the conceptual model.

USING THE CONCEPTUAL ENERGY ANALYSIS TOOL | 911
Project Phase  This is the phase the analysis will be run against. Keep the default set-
ting of New Construction, but if you had multiple phases to your project, you could 
change how the analysis is run here. It is important to note that if a later project phase 
is selected, properties assigned to a later building phase are omitted from the energy 
analysis.
Analytical Space Resolution and Analytical Surface Resolution  These numbers dic-
tate the tolerances for Revit to resolve the spaces and surfaces within the model. For our 
uses, keep the default values (1′ 6″ and 1/-0″, respectively).
Perimeter Zone Depth and Perimeter Zone Division  When this setting is enabled (the 
default), zones are automatically deﬁned around the perimeter of the massing form. If 
you prefer to create your own zones, disable this setting and set the Core Offset value to 0. 
Then create more detailed mass forms and use the Cut Geometry tool to combine over-
lapping forms.
Other Options  Choose the Edit button and you’ll see the Advanced Energy Settings 
dialog box (Figure 22.8). As the dialog box suggests, these are more advanced settings 
for the energy performance and building systems. You don’t have to manipulate many of 
these settings because you can vary them in Insight, but let’s walk through them here so 
you can see what’s available from this dialog box.
Figure 22.8 
Advanced Energy 
Settings dialog box
Target Percentage Glazing  This value sets the assumed amount of glazing as a 
percentage of the overall wall area.
Target Sill Height  This is the height of the sill for glazing to begin on each ﬂoor.

912 | CHAPTER 22 DESIGN ANALYSIS 
Glazing Is Shaded  Select this check box if you intend to design sunshading for the 
glazing. This does not differentiate by building orientation, so if you check the box, 
conceptual shading elements will be added to the glazing assumptions on all sides.
Shade Depth  When the Glazing Is Shaded option is checked, you can assign a 
depth to any assumed sunshading.
Target Percentage Skylights  Like Target Percentage Glazing, this value assumes an 
amount of skylighting for your model.
Skylight Width & Depth  This value sets the size for skylights if you are using them.
Building Type  This value sets the type of building use. By default, it is set to Ofﬁce, 
but there are many different building uses. The building use will help dictate the 
type of load on the building, assumed number of occupants, and so on.
Building Operation Schedule  How often will your building be occupied? Will 
it have people in it 24/7, or will it be operational only during ofﬁce hours? This can 
have a large impact on your heating and cooling cycles.
HVAC System  Here you can set a conceptual HVAC system. That could be a 
four-pipe system, underﬂoor air distribution, or a variety of other HVAC system 
types.
Outdoor Air Information  If you know how many air exchanges you’ll be required 
to produce per hour, you can set that value here.
Export Category  Your option here is either Rooms or Spaces. If you’re working 
from an architectural model, chances are you’re using Rooms. If this were an MEP 
model or you were linking in information from an MEP consultant, you’d want to use 
Spaces. For our exercise, leave it set to Rooms.
Conceptual Types  The Conceptual Types dialog box allows you to edit the as-
sumed values of building elements for the mass form, as shown in Figure 22.9.
Figure 22.9 
Te Conceptual 
Types dialog box 
allows you to test 
assumptions about 
massing forms.

USING THE CONCEPTUAL ENERGY ANALYSIS TOOL | 913
Schematic Types  The Schematic Types dialog box allows you to edit the as-
sumed values of the U values for each building system. Here is where you can 
customize the assumptions for the building type for insulation values, as shown 
in Figure 22.10.
Figure 22.10 
Schematic Types 
allows you to edit the 
assumed insulation 
(U-values).
Detailed Elements  The ﬁnal setting in the dialog box is the Detailed Elements 
check box. This box is unchecked by default, but checking it will tell Revit to use the 
thermal properties associated with the materials you have in your model. For our 
analysis, we have no materials assigned, so we will leave this unchecked, but if you 
are performing an analysis on a more developed model, this option could give bet-
ter results. Be aware that you will need to make sure to have thermal properties as-
signed to each of your materials to get accurate results.
5. Once those values are set, click OK to exit the dialog box.
Remember that this type of analysis is based on assumptions only and uses the overall size, 
location, and orientation of your proposed design. After you start analyzing the results, you can 
examine different massing conﬁgurations with the same construction and systems assumptions 
or varied assumptions on the same massing conﬁguration.
Running Energy Analysis Simulations
After you have established some baseline settings and assumptions for an energy analysis, it’s 
time to create the energy model. This is the ﬁnal step before running a simulation. Clicking the 
Create Energy Model button on the Analysis tab will apply the energy settings reviewed in the 
previous section to your model. This process can take a bit of time. As a warning, Revit will 
provide you with a dialog box noting that it will not be accessible during the computation time 
(Figure 22.11). Click Create The Energy Analytical Model to continue.

914 | CHAPTER 22 DESIGN ANALYSIS 
Figure 22.11 
Creating the energy 
model
Creating the model will change the look of your 3D view. The model will take on some trans-
parency tones during the calculation. Don’t worry—this is just a visualization for this view. 
Your building design has not been modiﬁed (Figure 22.12). You will notice that this step has  
created a new view called 3D Energy Model in your 3D views list.
Figure 22.12 
Creating the Energy 
Model assigns the 
energy values to the 
elements.
With the energy model created, the next step is to run the energy simulation. Click the 
Generate button on the Analyze tab to begin the energy simulation. Choosing this option will 
present you with another dialog box asking if you want to use the existing analytical model or 
create a new one (Figure 22.13). For this set of options, you would want to create a new energy 
model only if you had made revisions to the model since creating the initial analytical model. If 
not, choose to use the existing model.

USING THE CONCEPTUAL ENERGY ANALYSIS TOOL | 915
When you run the initial analysis, you get a potential warning message (Figure 22.14). This 
message states that there is some variation in the levels of complexity with the model. If you 
are performing the analysis on the model that was provided with this chapter content, there 
are some building elements that are signiﬁcantly more reﬁned than others—largely based on 
the phase of design this model is currently in. The dialog box simply calls your attention to the 
variety of complexity. If you are unaware of the variation, this is an opportunity to investigate 
before the analysis run. For this exercise, choose OK to continue.
Figure 22.13 
Choose an existing 
energy model or create 
a new one.
Figure 22.14 
Revit warning that 
there is wide variation 
in model complexity
The time required for analysis depends on model size, model complexity, and the simula-
tion server queue. You will receive one e-mail when the analysis begins, and you should receive 
another e-mail when energy analysis is complete.
When you receive the e-mail stating that your analysis is ready for review, you can access it 
one of two ways. You can click the Optimize button within Revit or follow the e-mailed link to 
your Insight simulation project. Using either option will open the Insight 360 tool (Figure 22.15) 
showing your energy model results.
The energy simulation run will be stored in the All Uncategorized folder since at this stage 
the run has not been associated with a project. Before you review the analysis, let’s ﬁrst create 
a project. Choose Insights from the menu along the top of the dialog box. This will take you to 
the main Insight 360 screen and allow you to create a project. Click the + Create Insight button, 
select the model you just ran from the list, and click Done. This will effectively put that model 
run into a folder within Insight 360.

916 | CHAPTER 22 DESIGN ANALYSIS 
Figure 22.15 
Energy model results
By default the analysis is called Untitled Insight (Figure 22.16). By choosing the three vertical 
dots at the lower right corner, you will expose a menu allowing you to make edits to the con-
tainer folder. Rename the Untitled Insight folder and call it Mastering Revit.
Figure 22.16 
Editing the Insight

USING THE CONCEPTUAL ENERGY ANALYSIS TOOL | 917
Open the newly renamed Insight folder and you will see your Insight model named after the 
ﬁle name of the model. Click the three vertical dots and rename the analysis to Baseline. You 
are going to be creating new scenarios where parameters are varied, so labeling it as baseline 
will help to differentiate this scenario.
Before exploring the actual analysis, let’s take a look at the options within this screen 
(Figure 22.17).
Figure 22.17 
Tools within the 
Insight project 
dialog box
On the right side of this dialog box are four tools.
 
◆
Starting at the top, you’ll see the Bar Chart icon. This tool enables model comparison, 
which is useful when you have multiple iterations of a model or multiple models from a 
campus location within the same Insight. Since you have only one model analysis right 
now, you’ll come back and explore this tool in more detail later in this chapter.
 
◆
The next icon from the top is the Comments icon. This allows the user to preserve or share 
notes on the model comparison.
 
◆
Third, the Avatar icon allows the user to add another member to the project via e-mail 
invitation.
 
◆
Finally, the Settings icon allows the user to select default units (Figure 22.18). Units include 
the following:
 
◆
Imperial or metric
 
◆
Annual cost or EUI
 
◆
Sorting of model widgets by importance
 
◆
Customization of currency and utility rates (default rates are selected by an auto-
mated rate service based on model location)

918 | CHAPTER 22 DESIGN ANALYSIS 
Change your units to match your desired output (we have changed ours to Imperial), 
and change your models to sort by importance. Click the Settings icon again to exit the 
dialog box.

Modifying the Insight 
settings
Understanding the Energy Analysis
Now that you have explored some of the Insight settings and navigation, let’s look at the actual 
analysis. Open Mastering Revit Insight and drill down into the Baseline analysis (Figure 22.19). 
You’ll see a dialog box that scrolls down quite a bit. Don’t be discouraged by the length—we’ll 
explore the options.
Stepping through the dialog box, you’ll ﬁnd the following tools:
A. The dial at the upper left allows the user to switch the view between EUI and cost/
square foot. Click the dial to see it change. In this example the EUI is 80.3 kBtu/sf/year or 
$1.58/sf/year.
B. The viewer shows the energy model submitted to Insight. The icons below the model allow 
rotation, panning, section analysis, measurement, and exploding the model. You can pull 
properties of various model elements or go into full-screen mode for a deeper exploration. 
These tools mimic the ones available in the A360 viewer.

C. The Benchmark Comparison shows current performance compared to industry bench-
marks such as ASHRAE 90.1 and Architecture 2030. Based on this initial run, the worst that 
the building theoretically could be performing is 355.8 kBtu/sf/year and the lowest EUI is 
-5.2 kBtu/sf/year.
D. The Model History area tracks all changes made to your model and impact. Since you 
have only one model, there is no real comparison yet.
E. The Energy Cost Factor cards ﬁll the remainder of this dialog box. These allow you to 
quickly visualize the impact of different design decisions for key drivers of performance and 
are ranked in order of highest impact at the top to least impact at the bottom.
Let’s dig into the Energy Cost Factor cards in a bit more detail. Turn over the HVAC energy 
factor by selecting the blue circular arrow at the top right of the card. The HVAC card should be 
the third one in the sequence if you used the book’s model for analysis (Figure 22.20). Turning 
over the card, you will notice that a broad range of options were selected for the initial analysis 
run. The assumed setting for the run is labeled as “BIM” and represented by a triangle shape on 
the chart.
Note that the energy dial incorporates this wide range across the factors to represent uncer-
tainty and allow the user to reﬁne the baseline to incorporate uncertainty and optimize scenar-
ios to drive to desired outcomes.

920 | CHAPTER 22 DESIGN ANALYSIS 
Creating a Realistic Baseline
The Insight default run includes the full range of options across all energy factors, including the 
BIM settings that were assigned in the Revit model or are assumed based on building type. It is 
prudent to quickly create a more realistic baseline for analysis based on your general knowledge 
of the building, industry standards, building type, typical systems, regional building practices, 
or other guidance. In this exercise, you will create a more reﬁned baseline scenario that reduces 
the uncertainties initially introduced by the Insight engine because of minimal data input and 
broad assumptions:
1. Save the original (default) Insight and add an alternate scenario by selecting the Add 
Scenario icon at the top-right corner of the Insight page (Figure 22.21). This will pull a 
panel into the dialog box from the left of the screen.
Figure 22.20 
Exploring the HVAC 
Energy Cost Factor card
Figure 22.21 
Making a new scenario
2. Select the three vertical dots next to Untitled Scenario to name the scenario. Name the 
scenario Baseline from Revit and press Enter to save the scenario name. We’re going to 
modify some of the assumptions to better reﬁne the analysis.

USING THE CONCEPTUAL ENERGY ANALYSIS TOOL | 921
3. As we mentioned, the energy cost factors are ranked in order of importance. Choose the 
third option again, HVAC, and notice the curve of the graph. Each of the HVAC equipment 
selections is highly inﬂuential on the energy performance of this building in Colorado.
For the purposes of this exercise, we are going to create a baseline that represents the 
lower-performing HVAC and other factors that are moderate in performance. To modify 
the performance assumptions, click the card so that it turns over. Then click into the card 
exposing the editing window (Figure 22.22). Adjust the assumptions by moving the slid-
ers along the bottom of this window to tighten the assumptions.
Figure 22.22 
Modify the energy

for HVAC.
Adjust sliders
4. You can immediately see how making modiﬁcations to the assumptions impacts the 
energy performance in the dial. Now that you understand how to modify the baseline, 
make the following changes to some of the other assumptions:
Operating Schedule  The default is set to 24/7 – 12/5. Push the left slider on the card to 
12/6. Note that as you modify each card, it stays turned over to show that the assumption 
has been manipulated.
Plug Load Efﬁciency  Push the left slider on the card to 1.3 W/sq ft.
Inﬁltration  Push the left slider on the card to 0.4 ACH.
PV – Surface Coverage  Push the right slider to the left so there is 0 percent photovoltaic 
coverage.

922 | CHAPTER 22 DESIGN ANALYSIS 
5. Save these modiﬁcations as a new scenario by clicking the Add Scenario icon at the top-
right corner of the Insight page. Select the three vertical dots next to Untitled Scenario to 
name the scenario, and save it as Reﬁned Baseline.
6. Next, you’ll look at how much you have changed the analysis by doing a comparison. 
To compare the reﬁned baseline to the original simulation directly from Revit, click the 
Scenario Compare icon at the top right of the Insight dialog box (Figure 22.23). The icon 
looks like two rectangles layered on top of each other.
Figure 22.23 
Comparing scenarios
Note that the EUI increased slightly in the reﬁned baseline compared to the original from 
Revit, as shown in Figure 22.24. This is because you reﬁned your assumptions and under-
standing about the building and quickly created a more realistic picture. The EUI of 89 is 
close to ASHRAE 90.1 benchmark (for this building the benchmark is 79.8).
Figure 22.24 
Comparison analysis
Creating a High-Performance Building Design
In this next exercise, you will seek to increase the energy performance of the building against 
the revised baseline EUI (89 kBtu). You’ll further reﬁne some of the assumptions to help drive 
better energy efﬁciency.
1. First, you are going to optimize HVAC performance without having to select a speciﬁc 
system. Scroll down to the HVAC card and click it. Move the right slider all the way to 
the right side of the card and the left slider to High Eff. Heat Pump. Note the impact 

USING THE CONCEPTUAL ENERGY ANALYSIS TOOL | 923
on the EUI just with this one change. It dropped from 89 to 58. Because the example 
building is in Colorado, this one factor has a signiﬁcant impact on energy performance 
(Figure 22.25).
Figure 22.25 
Further modify-
ing HVAC for better 
eﬃciency
2. Leave Operating Schedule Plug Load Efﬁciency alone.
3. Next, you’ll edit the window to wall ratio (WWR). You will need to do this separately 
for each cardinal direction as there is a separate card for the north, south, east, and west 
facades. This allows you greater variation based on the speciﬁc climate and environment 
of your building project. For your analysis, reduce window glazing on all four sides.
 
◆
WWR – Southern Walls: 40 percent to 50 percent
 
◆
WWR – Western Walls: 40 percent to 50 percent
 
◆
WWR – Norther Walls: 30 percent to 40 percent
 
◆
WWR – Eastern Walls: 15 percent to 30 percent

924 | CHAPTER 22 DESIGN ANALYSIS 
4. Next, change Window Glass on all four sides to Double Pane Low E-Triple Low E. The 
setting you will see on the card will read Dbl LoE – Trp LoE (Figure 22.26).
Figure 22.26 
Modifying window 
glass eﬃciency
If you review some of the remaining cards, you will see there are a few additional factors 
with steep curves. This indicates that major investments in these areas will have a lesser 
impact on overall energy performance.
5. Finally, let’s re-investigate the use of photovoltaic panels (PV) by adjusting sliders to 
represent 60 percent to 75 percent roof coverage area with high-efﬁciency panels and a 
30-year payback. Modify the following cards:
 
◆
PV – Surface Coverage: 60 percent to 70 percent
 
◆
PV – Payback Limit: 30 yr
Solar PV represents a ﬁnancial investment that may be subsidized with tax credits or 
local or utility incentives. Given the shape and allowable roof area available to PV and 
the location, there is signiﬁcant impact on the EUI (it reduced from 51 to 8!) and a lengthy 
payback period. Colorado speciﬁcally receives about 300 days of sunlight per year, so it is 
a great candidate for solar panels.
6. Finish the exercise by choosing the Add Scenario tool at the top right of the dialog box. 
(It looks like a ribbon with a plus sign.) Save this as a new scenario and name this version 
Energy Savings Scenario 1.
Finally, use the Model Comparison tool again to compare the new analysis against the oth-
ers (Figure 22.27). You can see a signiﬁcant improvement to energy performance with the latest 
revisions.
You can apply your favorite scenarios to other projects and models by going to your Insight 
project folder (one level up). Open the Model Comparison window and highlight your favorite 
scenarios (in this case, Energy Savings Scenario 1) by clicking the Star icon (Figure 22.28). This will 
make the scenario accessible to other projects and allow you to utilize the results across projects.

You can now see how quick and easy it is to explore a variety of design options to optimize 
your energy performance. Understanding how to quickly iterate these settings will help you 
design smarter, better-performing buildings. You can download a copy of the ﬁnal model, 
c22-Analysis-Finish.rvt, from the book’s companion website.
Using Architecture 2030
Architecture 2030 is a nonproﬁt organization established in response to the climate change cri-
sis by architect Edward Mazria in 2002. Architecture 2030’s mission is to rapidly transform the 
global built environment from the major contributor of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to a 
central part of the solution to the climate crisis. More than 350 ﬁrms are currently participating 
in the AIA 2030 Commitment. If you are one of these ﬁrms or are interested in modeling to this 
performance metric, you need to report your project data, which has historically been cumber-
some. Insight automates the data entry process and streamlines AIA 2030 reporting.
In the following steps, you’ll explore how to take your current analysis and use it for 
Architecture 2030:
1. First, you need to enable the Architecture 2030 service. This service is called AIA DDx 
and is available as an Insight service. Choose your proﬁle picture in the Insight dialog 
box and then choose Services from the drop-down list (Figure 22.29). Choose the AIA 
DDx slider to enable the service.
Figure 22.29 
Enabling AIA DDx
2. To use the service, you or your ﬁrm will need to be registered participants. You can reg-
ister for the program at http://architecture2030.org/2030_challenges/adopt_the_
challenge. Registration will provide you with an API key and a client key that you can 
enter into the Insight dialog box (Figure 22.30).
Figure 22.30

ect with AIA 2030

3. After you’ve generated an Insight from Revit and identiﬁed the key factors that are driv-
ing energy cost and performance, select Report to AIA DDx from the options menu for 
the model (Figure 22.31).
Figure 22.31

4. Before submitting, review the information that will be reported to the DDx and enter any 
additional information required for reporting. Gray ﬁelds are automated by Insight, and 
white ﬁelds can be edited. Finally, click Send to provide the project information to the 
AIA DDx (Figure 22.32).

928 | CHAPTER 22 DESIGN ANALYSIS 
Making More Informed Decisions
We have seen so many projects in which design forms were arbitrarily created and presented to 
clients—only to have them choose the option that looked the most compelling. Cost of construc-
tion may come into play for a more complex design against a simpler solution. But what about how 
each of the design solutions will perform after construction?
Using the energy analysis tools has allowed our teams not only to present various design ideas to 
clients but to accompany the forms with performance characteristics as well. One design may cost 
more to construct, but it is projected to perform better in terms of heating loads in the winter. We 
frequently use selected graphs and comparisons from the Insight reports in our presentations to 
clients. Tis enhanced information increases client conﬁdence in making key decisions when they 
are most appropriate to drive value in the design and construction process.
Understanding Lighting Analysis
The Light Analysis Revit (LA/R) capabilities within the Insight tool leverage the Autodesk ren-
dering cloud service to understand the daylighting availability for your building design. Using 
natural daylight to light a building space can signiﬁcantly impact your energy performance 
by reducing the need for artiﬁcial lighting. Lighting analysis in Revit is quick and accurate. 
Additionally, it supports automated scheduling to study common analysis types. Supported 
analysis types include the following:
 
◆
Illuminance Analysis
 
◆
Daylight Autonomy (sDA preview)
 
◆
LEED 2009 IEQc8 opt1
 
◆
LEED v4 EQc7 opt1
 
◆
LEED v4 EQc7 opt2
 
◆
Solar Access
The Revit LA/R service does not require that architects understand complicated concepts, 
such as Perez versus CIE’s sky models or direct normal incident versus direct horizontal radia-
tion. It is easy to get started with lighting analysis for the whole building or just speciﬁc areas.
To get started, let’s dive right into getting the analysis set up and running. To begin, you’ll 
need to make sure your version of Revit is up to date. This will include making sure the 
Lighting and Solar Analysis for Revit tool is loaded. You can ﬁnd this tool in the Autodesk 
Desktop App (Figure 22.33).
Figure 22.33 
Loading the 
daylighting tool

UNDERSTANDING LIGHTING ANALYSIS | 929
You’re going to use the same model you’ve been using for the energy analysis. You can down-
load the model, c22_Analysis_Start-Lighting.rvt, from the book’s companion website. Here 
are some basic assumptions:
 
◆
You’ve given the building a location.
 
◆
You’ve provided proper orientation (for example, the north side of the building actually 
faces north). If not, use the Rotate True North tool on the Manage tab to adjust the building 
direction.
 
◆
You are still logged into A360 from the previous exercise. You will need to be logged into 
your account to run the analysis.
With those assumptions taken care of, there is one other setting we need to address to set up 
the building for a realistic daylighting study. A key component to daylighting inside of a build-
ing is the glazing. If light isn’t passing through the glass properly, you’re not going to get accu-
rate daylighting results. You need to make sure you set the right materials, both for the glass 
(light transmittance) and for the interior surfaces (light reﬂectivity).
All of your elements within the model—or at least within the space to be analyzed—should 
have materials deﬁned. Even generic elements such as generic walls need to be deﬁned. Let’s 
look at some of these materials in more detail.
One common material will be paint (Figure 22.34). Here, we have applied paint as the ﬁnish 
type, called Cool White, to describe the ﬁnish type for Gypsum Wall Board, one of our most 
common building materials. As you can see on the Appearance tab, you have the ability to 
change some of the properties of the paint. You can alter the ﬁnish (ﬂat, eggshell, semi-gloss, 
gloss, and so on) and the application, which is how the paint is applied to the wall (rolled, 
sprayed, and so on). Each of these will affect the reﬂectance of the paint in a different way. If you 
don’t know the exact ﬁnish, it’s OK to use one as an estimate for now.
Figure 22.34 
Setting materiality for 
walls

930 | CHAPTER 22 DESIGN ANALYSIS 
In any case, four material properties should be set for all the materials you have in your 
building. Having these as accurate as possible will help establish the most accurate lighting lev-
els within the space. If you don’t know what color or material type to use, some generic sugges-
tions later in this chapter will help establish some median lighting conditions.
Color  The color of the glazing will partially determine light transmittance. Set your glazing 
color to reﬂect the color you will have in your design. The software supplies several common 
glazing colors.
Reﬂectance  As with different colors, reﬂectance will also help determine how much light 
you will get inside a space. You will see that if you use the Replace feature at the top to select 
one of the preset glazing colors, it will also give you a default value for reﬂectance.
Transmittance  Transmittance measures the amount of light that will come through the 
glass. Reﬂective glazing or smoked glass will have a lower transmittance than clear glazing.
Sheets Of Glass  The number of sheets of glass will determine how the light will be 
refracted as it moves from outside the building to the inside. Typically, in a Revit window 
family, you model glass as a 1″ (25 mm) single pane for ease of modeling. Modifying the 
number of panes in this location will allow you to keep your modeling simpliﬁed but still 
maintain a level of accuracy in the daylighting analysis.
Another material you should review is Glass. Getting the proper glazing settings will deter-
mine how much daylight you are getting inside the space. Select Glass or Glass, Clear Glazing 
from the material list and choose the Appearance tab to see the options shown in Figure 22.35. 
There are a few critical settings for glazing: Color, Reﬂectance, and Sheets Of Glass. These are 
similar to the other material properties previously discussed.
Figure 22.35

UNDERSTANDING LIGHTING ANALYSIS | 931
Depending on the stage of design you are in, you might not know what your ﬁnal material 
is, but you want to create some default material types so you can perform some preliminary 
lighting analysis. When in doubt, here are some default reﬂectance values you can apply to the 
generic materials:
 
◆
Floors: 20 percent reﬂectance
 
◆
Walls: 50 percent reﬂectance
 
◆
Ceilings: 85 percent reﬂectance
With your materials set, now it’s time to perform the actual analysis. Make sure you exit any 
open dialog boxes.
1. On the Analyze tab, choose the Lighting tool. Selecting this tool will give you a dialog 
box that will outline the steps to run the analysis. Essentially, the steps are to prepare 
your model, run a new analysis, and review the results. Click the Continue button in the 
dialog box to move to the ﬁrst step. You are given the option to run a new analysis type 
or recall previously saved results. Since you haven’t done an analysis yet, choose Select 
Run New Analysis and then click Go.
2. Next, the Lighting Analysis In the Cloud dialog box opens (Figure 22.36) and allows you 
to control the study settings.

The settings include the following:
Analysis Type  This deﬁnes the type of analysis you want to perform. You can choose 
from the following:
 
◆
Illuminance Analysis
 
◆
Daylighting Autonomy (sDA preview)
 
◆
LEED 2009 IEQc8 opt 1
 
◆
LEED v4 EQc7 opt 1 (sDA+ASE)
 
◆

For our use, leave this setting at Illuminance Analysis.
Environment  This setting allows you to deﬁne the location of your building if you 
haven’t done so previously.
Illuminance Settings  Here you can set the threshold for how much illuminance you 
want to see in the model. You can also change the default value from reporting in lux to 
foot-candles. Foot-candles is more commonly used in the United States, while lux is used 
by the USGBC and European countries. To understand what the output values would mean 
in either lux or foot-candles, Table 22.1 lists activities with an associated lighting value.

Here, you can also set the height above the ﬂoor that the lighting analysis will calculate. 
Typically this is set to desk height, or 32″ (0.8 m).

UNDERSTANDING LIGHTING ANALYSIS | 933
Cloud Credits  This setting allows you to set the grid spacing for the analysis. The dens-
er the grid, the more analysis points and therefore the more cloud credits the analysis 
will require. The cloud credits won’t be used until the analysis is complete.
Finally, you can also check the box to e-mail you when the analysis is complete.
3. When the settings are complete, choose Start Analysis to begin the analysis. This will 
upload your model to Autodesk’s cloud service and begin analyzing your daylighting. 
This will take some time to complete, but you are free to continue working in Revit. 
When the ﬁle is uploaded successfully, you’ll receive a ﬁnal dialog box like Figure 22.37 
telling you that the analysis is in progress.

performed in the cloud
4. Once the analysis is complete, you’ll receive an e-mail notifying you that you can now 
review the results. In a 3D view, choose the Analyze tab again and the Lighting tool. 
You’ll be prompted to accept the cost of the analysis in cloud credits (Figure 22.38). 
Choose the appropriate option to continue.

Your results will be ﬁrst presented in a dialog box (Figure 22.39) that will outline the numeric 
results of the analysis. Note the analysis is run for two times of day, 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. at the 
equinox (September 21). The analysis will also deliver results based on your ability to properly 
shade the space with or without the inclusion of sunshading devices.
Once the analysis is complete, it will deliver a heat map of your building (or ﬂoor or area that 
you deﬁned for analysis) of your results. Figure 22.40 shows the results of your building analysis 
delivered in lux.

By comparing the results from the heat map with Table 22.1, you can get an understanding of 
the light levels in any given area of the building.

THE BOTTOM LINE | 935
Te Bottom Line
Embrace energy analysis concepts.  Understanding the concepts behind sustainable design 
is an important part of being able to perform analysis within the Revit model and a critical 
factor in today’s design environment.
Master It  What are four key methods for a holistic sustainable design?
Analyze your model for energy performance.  Being able to predict a building’s energy 
performance is a necessary part of designing sustainably. Although Revit doesn’t have an 
energy-modeling application built into it, it does have interoperability with many applica-
tions that have that functionality.
Master It  Explain the steps you need to take to get a Revit model ready for energy 
analysis.
Analyze your model for daylighting performance.  Understanding the concepts behind 
daylighting analysis is an important part of sustainable design. It is more than just under-
standing how light comes into a space; it is also understanding how the exterior and interior 
building design can help to bring light deeper into a building and provide a better quality of 
lighting overall.
Master It  What are the four primary items to consider when you’re looking to perform 
accurate daylighting analysis?

 Appendix A
T e Bottom Line  
 Each of The Bottom Line sections in the chapters suggest exercises to deepen skills and under-
standing. Sometimes there is only one possible solution, but often you are encouraged to use 
your skills and creativity to create something that builds on what you know and lets you 
explore one of many possible solutions. 
 Chapter  1 : Understanding the Principles of BIM 
Focus your investment in BIM.  Since using Revit software is a change in workﬂ ow, it is 
also important to understand the change in stafﬁ ng and who is needed to perform what roles 
on a project. 
Master It  What are the three primary roles in a Revit project, and what are the respon-
sibilities of those roles? 
Solution  Every successful Revit project will need three roles. These roles do not need 
to be individual people; one person can assume all three roles at any point in the project. 
The roles are architect, modeler, and drafter. These roles are responsible for understand-
ing and articulating the design, creating model content, and laying out and annotating 
the documentation, respectively. 
Understand a BIM workﬂ ow.  Understand how projects are completed in BIM and how the 
use of Revit software on a project can change how information within a project is created. 
Master It  Explain one of the primary differences between a more traditional 2D CAD-
based workﬂ ow and producing documents using Revit. 
Solution  In a 2D CAD-based workﬂ ow, documents are created by team members by 
creating plans, sections, elevations, and details, all as separate drawings, and then manu-
ally coordinating that content for the project set. In a BIM or Revit workﬂ ow, the plans, 
sections, elevations, and perspectives are a by-product of creating the virtual building 
model and are coordinated through updates made to the model itself. 
Leverage BIM processes.  Understanding the level of risk your ﬁ rm is willing to take in 
new technologies will help you establish goals for your future use of BIM. 
Master It  Using the three areas of ﬁ rm integration (visualization, analysis, and strat-
egy), deﬁ ne how those areas overlap for your ﬁ rm or project. 
Solution  Remember, there is no wrong answer in mapping a path forward for your ﬁ rm 
or project. The important thing is to identify which areas are critical to the workﬂ ow of 
your ﬁ rm to help you focus your future efforts.

940 | APPENDIX A THE BOTTOM LINE
Chapter 2: Exploring the UI and Organizing Projects
Understand the user interface.  In addition to understanding how your project is orga-
nized, to use the Revit software well, you must understand how the UI is organized. Once 
you grasp both of these concepts, you will be ready to move ahead.
Master It  The “big” areas of the UI are the ribbon, the Properties palette, the Project 
Browser, and the drawing area. How do these areas work together, and what tabs corre-
spond to an iterative design process?
Solution  The Architecture tab is where you’ll turn in your early design process because it 
contains datum objects, system families, component families, and spaces. As the design de-
velops, you’ll establish your views from the View tab. When you start to get into documen-
tation, you’ll work from the Annotate tab. Having panels from the Modify tab pulled off 
and close at hand will keep you from having to go between one contextual tab and another.
Understand project organization.  The compelling advantage of being able to design, docu-
ment, and manage your project across multiple disciplines—the architectural, structural, and 
mechanical disciplines—is something that you can do in Revit, and understanding project 
workﬂow is key to getting off on the right foot.
Master It  Thinking back to the Revit organizational chart shown in Figure 2.22 (and 
here in Figure A.1), what are the main components of a Revit project, and how can you 
apply them to your design process? How do these categories directly affect your  
design workﬂow?
Solution  The top-level categories of a Revit project are datum, content, views, and man-
agement. They correspond to the design process of maintaining relationships, repetition, 
representations, and restrictions. Keep these corollaries in mind as you move sequentially 
from schematic design, design development, construction documentation, and construc-
tion management.
Chapter 3: Te Basics of the Toolbox
Select, modify, and replace elements.  Many fundamental interactions are supported by 
Revit software to select just what you need and to modify elements efﬁciently.
Master It  How can you quickly select only the door tags in a plan view and switch 
them to another type?
Solution  First, window-select the entire plan. Then, using the Filter tool in the Modify 
tab of the ribbon, select only the Door Tags category, close the Filter dialog box, and 
change the type in the Properties palette.
Edit elements interactively.  The editing tools in Revit are similar to those found in other 
CAD and BIM software programs. Tools such as Move, Copy, and Trim are available on the 
Modify tab of the ribbon.
Master It  How do you create a parametric repetition of an element?
Solution  Select an element and activate the Array tool from the Modify tab of the rib-
bon. Specify a linear array with the Group And Associate option, and choose either Move 
To 2nd for speciﬁc element spacing or Move To Last for consistent overall length with 
varied element spacing.

942 | APPENDIX A THE BOTTOM LINE
Use other editing tools.  Beyond the basic editing tools are more advanced commands to 
help you consistently and intelligently populate a building model with content.
Master It  How do you copy model elements in the same location for a multistory 
building?
Solution  Select the required elements and copy them to the Clipboard (Ctrl+C). From 
the Clipboard panel in the Modify tab, select Paste Aligned To Selected Levels, and then 
choose the levels to which you’d like to paste the copied content.
Explore A360 features for collaboration.  While Revit is a great interface for creating and 
editing project content, there are times when you will want to share the model with  
clients or consultants who don’t have Revit.
Master It  Describe the functionalities and limitations of loading your project model up 
to http://A360.autodesk.com.
Solution  A360 allows for visualization of model views (both 2D and 3D), markups, 
commenting, and the ability to pull properties of selected elements. What the A360 site 
does not allow is any editing of the model content. Adding, deleting, or modifying model 
geometry or data can only be done in the native Revit application.
Create site context for your project.  The site tools allow you to create context for your 
building models, including topographic surfaces, graded regions, and property lines.
Master It  Describe the different methods used to create a topographic surface.
Solution  A topographic surface can be created by placing points at speciﬁc elevations 
relative to internal project coordinates, by using an imported 3D CAD ﬁle from a civil 
engineering software program, or by using a text ﬁle that contains the x-, y-, and  
z-coordinates of a ﬁeld of points.
Chapter 4: Conﬁguring Templates and Standards
Deﬁne settings for graphic quality and consistency.  The fundamental building blocks for 
any template are the customized settings for object styles, line styles, ﬁll patterns, materials, 
and more.
Master It  How can a complex custom-ﬁll pattern be imported?
Solution  Use a text-editing application to create a custom pattern or copy a pattern 
from another application. Be sure to add lines to the pattern deﬁnition that describe 
the units and pattern type. In the New Pattern dialog box, choose Custom and click the 
Import button to select your custom pattern ﬁle. Adjust the pattern as necessary for the 
desired result.
Organize views for maximum efﬁciency.  The project template can be used to capture a 
framework supporting your visual and organizational standards.
Master It  How can you customize the Project Browser to support your business needs?
Solution  Filtering folders based on view types and documentation helps team members 
quickly ﬁnd what they’re looking for in a project. Your project template can also exclude 
views that are not needed based on a speciﬁc task. For example, if you’re in design de-
velopment, you can exclude previous views and sheets that were part of a previous sche-
matic design stage.

CHAPTER 5: COLLABORATING WITH A TEAM | 943
Create custom annotation families.  Developing a graphic style to match your standards 
will usually require you to edit some annotation families or create them from scratch.
Master It  Can a single label display more than one parameter? How are custom view 
tags loaded into a project?
Solution  A single label can show more than one parameter—and even custom param-
eters. Just remember to place the label with the Label tool. Assign the label to report the 
desired parameters.
Start a project with a custom template.  Making your custom template available for new 
projects ensures that all future projects will maintain the same level of graphic quality and 
efﬁciency you expect.
Master It  How do you set your own custom project template to be the default for new 
projects?
Solution  Click the Application button, select the Options button, and navigate to the 
File Locations tab. Click the Browse button for the Default Template File ﬁeld, and navi-
gate to the location of your custom project template. From now on, click the Application 
button, select New Project, and select New in the Recent Files window—or press 
Ctrl+N—to use your new template as the basis for the new project.
Develop a template management strategy.  Organizing your standards, content, and set-
tings while using Revit tools to transfer content will make your effort more efﬁcient.
Master It  How do you insert your standard details from one Revit project to another? 
How do you transfer settings such as materials?
Solution  2D content such as standard details can be stored in separate Revit project ﬁles 
and loaded when needed. One way to do this is with the Insert Views From File tool in 
the Insert tab. Select an RVT project ﬁle and then choose eligible views such as drafting 
views, sheets, or schedules. They are transferred into your active project with all associ-
ated parameters. To transfer settings and styles such as materials, select the Manage tab 
and click Transfer Project Standards. Remember to open another project from which 
you’d like to transfer settings before running this tool.
Chapter 5: Collaborating with a Team
Understand key worksharing concepts.  Once the team has created local ﬁles, it is neces-
sary to understand how to keep both the local ﬁles and the central ﬁle up to date as changes 
occur on the project. Doing so ensures that everyone is working from an updated and recent 
copy of the model at all times.
Master It  Once you have begun working in your local ﬁle, how do you publish your 
changes to the central ﬁle? How do you download changes from the central ﬁle to your 
local ﬁle?
Solution  The easiest way to do this is by using the Synchronize With Central command, 
which is accessible from the Collaborate tab and also from the Quick Access toolbar. To 
download changes from others without uploading your latest work, use the Reload  
Latest (RL) command.

944 | APPENDIX A THE BOTTOM LINE
Enable worksharing on your project.  Knowing how to activate and use worksharing is 
indispensable to working in a team environment using Revit.
Master It  How do you transition a single-user Revit ﬁle to a multiuser environment us-
ing worksharing?
Solution  To activate worksharing, click the Worksets button on the Collaborate tab. This 
will initiate the worksharing feature and divide your model into the two default work-
sets. To allow others to access the model, you will need to choose File Save As and save 
the ﬁle to a network location. After this, close the ﬁle. Each team member then makes a 
local copy of this network ﬁle and works exclusively within his or her local copy.
Organize worksets in your model.  There is no single rule for organizing worksets in your 
project models; however, they can be used to your team’s advantage. You can use worksets to 
better organize larger projects and for additional visibility control.
Master It  How do you assign objects to worksets? How do you change an object’s work-
set assignment?
Solution  As model elements are added to a project, they are assigned to the active 
workset selected by the user. The active workset is visible either in the Collaborate tab 
in the ribbon or in the status bar. An object’s workset assignment can be changed in the 
Properties palette at any time.
Manage workﬂow with worksharing.  Once the central ﬁle has been created, you will need 
to organize and structure the model into logical worksets to maintain workﬂow with Revit.
Master It  How do worksets differ from layers in 2D CAD? What are some logical ways 
to create worksets within a model?
Solution  2D CAD layers were logically divided around individual elements in isolated 
ﬁles. In Revit, because everything is in one ﬁle and you are working with 3D objects, not 
just model lines, you need to use worksets to divide the building in different ways. Some 
logical workset divisions would be Shell And Core, Interiors, FF&E, and Site.
Understand element ownership in worksets.  Editing elements in a central ﬁle means you 
have sole ownership over further changes to those elements. Understanding the permissions 
is critical to working in a team.
Master It  How do you edit an element in the model if someone has already taken own-
ership of it in a worksharing environment?
Solution  Trying to edit the element initiates a request for permissions in Revit. When 
you alert the other team member of your desire to have ownership of this element, that 
person can grant your permission request using the Editing Requests button on the 
Collaborate tab.
Collaborate in the cloud.  Not all of your team members will be Revit-savvy and know 
how to use the tools. In addition, not everyone on the team will have a copy of Revit, but you 
might still need their input and comments on the design. Learning to leverage complemen-
tary tools to Revit is critical to keeping a project moving smoothly.
Master It  How do you use the cloud to get feedback from non-Revit users on a project team?
Solution  Create a series of views in your project, making sure to name them in a 
way that is easy for other team members to understand. These views can be plans, 
sections, elevations, or 3D views. Share the Revit model with team members using 
http://360.autodesk.com. The site will allow them to browse the views and add 
comments.

CHAPTER 6: WORKING WITH CONSULTANTS | 945
Chapter 6: Working with Consultants
Prepare for interdisciplinary collaboration.  Proper planning and communication are the 
foundation of effective collaboration. Although only some client organizations may require a 
BIM planning document, it is a recommended strategy for all design teams.
Master It  What are the key elements of a BIM execution plan?
Solution  An effective BIM execution plan will ﬁrst list the goals and uses of building 
information modeling as well as the scope of the data to be developed. It will also list the 
software platforms to be used, information exchange process, delivery strategy, and tech-
nology infrastructure.
Collaborate using linked Revit models.  The most basic tool for collaboration is the ability 
to view consultants’ data directly within the context of your own model. Project ﬁles from 
other disciplines can be linked and displayed with predictable visual ﬁdelity without com-
plex conversion processes.
Master It  How can worksharing complement the use of linked Revit models?
Solution  Placing each linked model on a unique workset allows team members to 
choose when to load or unload the linked models without affecting their teammates. 
Worksets within linked models can also help you manage graphic quality using the 
 ability to load or unload worksets globally.
Use Copy/Monitor between linked models.  The Coordination Monitor tools establish 
intelligent bonds between elements in a host ﬁle and correlating elements in a linked model. 
They also support a workﬂow that respects the needs of discrete teams developing their own 
data, perhaps on a different schedule than that of other team members.
Master It  How can grids in two different Revit projects be related?
Solution  The Copy/Monitor tool allows you to copy elements such as grids from a 
linked ﬁle into a host ﬁle and monitor the linked element for changes.
Run interference checks.  Interference checking—also known as clash detection—is one 
of the most important components of building information modeling. It is the essence of 
virtual construction and has the greatest potential for cost savings during the physical con-
struction process.
Master It  How do you ﬁnd interfering objects between two linked Revit models?
Solution  On the Collaborate tab, locate the Coordinate panel and choose Interference 
Check ➢ Run Interference Check. If you are using linked models, select the desired 
linked project in the Categories From drop-down list while keeping the other column set 
to Current Project. Select the desired object categories in the left and right columns (for 
example, choose Structural Framing from a structural model and Ducts from an MEP 
model). Click OK to run the check. The results can be exported to a report for coordina-
tion with others.

946 | APPENDIX A THE BOTTOM LINE
Chapter 7: Interoperability: Working Multiplatform
Use imported 2D CAD data.  CAD data can be integrated into your Revit project in a num-
ber of ways: as plans of existing conditions, as ﬁxture layouts from consultants, or as stan-
dard details from your company’s library.
Master It  How can CAD details be used in a Revit project?
Solution  Create a new drafting view for a single detail. From the Insert tab, choose Link 
CAD and select a DWG detail ﬁle. During linking, set the colors to Black And White. 
Make sure the scale of the drafting view matches the notation scale of the CAD detail. 
Use the Query tool to turn off unwanted layers within the linked ﬁle.
Export 2D CAD data.  The ability to deliver quality 2D information to other constitu-
ents involved in your project is as important as importing it into the Revit environment. 
Appropriately formatted views, standardized layer templates, and proper coordinate settings 
will result in happy team members and a smooth coordination process.
Master It  Does Revit software comply with the National CAD Standard?
Solution  Yes, you have the ability to map Revit model categories to standardized layers 
in the Export Layers dialog box. Access this tool by clicking the Application menu and 
selecting Export Options Export Layers DWG/DXF. Load industry-standard layer con-
ventions using the Standard button.
Use imported 3D model data.  Model data generated outside of the Revit environment 
can be integrated into your projects as whole-building systems, massing studies, or unique 
components.
Master It  How can a building’s structural model created with the Bentley Structure be 
integrated into a Revit project?
Solution  Create a structural framing family into which the DGN model will be inserted. 
When the family is ﬁnished, the DGN geometry will be displayed as any other Revit 
structural-framing component.
Export 3D model data.  Your modeled elements don’t have to remain in the Revit environ-
ment forever. Data can be exported to 3ds Max, SketchUp, AutoCAD MEP, and more.
Master It  How can you coordinate your architectural Revit model with an engineer us-
ing AutoCAD MEP?
Solution  The engineer will likely require one DWG model per level for efﬁcient coordi-
nation. Create duplicate ﬂoor plans for exporting and adjust the View Range settings for 
Top to Level Above, Offset: 0, and Bottom to Associated Level, Offset: 0. Create duplicate 
3D views for each level, right-click the ViewCube, choose Orient To View Floor Plans, and 
ﬁnd the corresponding ﬂoor plans. These 3D views can be batch-exported to DWG format 
and referenced by the MEP engineer in the designs.
Work with IFC imports and exports.  Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) is a vendor- 
neutral model format designed to support interoperability in the AEC industry. It is widely 
used by some major BIM platforms available around the world.
Master It  How is an IFC model integrated into a Revit project for coordination?
Solution  You can open an IFC ﬁle by clicking the Application menu and selecting Open 
IFC. Once the ﬁle is open, the data can be saved as an RVT Revit project ﬁle and linked 
into another Revit ﬁle for continued coordination.

CHAPTER 9: ADVANCED MODELING AND MASSING | 947
Chapter 8: Managing Revit Projects
Understand how to conduct Revit/BIM administration.  Revit/BIM administration is 
intended to address two key components of project delivery: general workﬂows/processes 
and quality assurance/quality control.
Master It  Describe the ideal BIM/Revit QA/QC approach.
Solution  Put into place a QA/QC program that incrementally reviews the Revit project 
throughout all phases of the project. This approach will ensure consistency, quality, and 
accuracy of the information.
Explain how your QA/QC process will work.  The administration of Revit is reliant on 
process. All people participating on the project must understand how an activity starts, who 
conducts the activity, the possible results during the activity, and how the activity ends.
Master It  Draw a swim lane process diagram that depicts your desired Revit QA/QC process.
Solution  The swim lane process diagram depicting a desired Revit QA/QC program 
may vary between individuals, but the methodology described as follows will remain con-
sistent. First, identify all parties needed to conduct the QA/QC process. This establishes 
the swim lanes. Denote which party starts the QA/QC and then map all activities to its 
respective swim lane. Denote the change in ownership of the QA/QC activity by connect-
ing the transitions between the swim lanes. The ﬁnal transition that represents where the 
activity ends should reside in the swim lane of the party who completes the activity.
Understand important Revit metrics.  Revit metrics can be graphically analyzed to discern 
characteristics of a Revit model or a group of Revit models. The visual analysis is always in 
relation to contextual information that is considered relevant to the analysis.
Master It  Describe an example of a Revit visual analysis and potential application for 
conducting QA/QC on a set of Revit models.
Solution  The ﬁle sizes of Revit models can be plotted in sequence within a graph. 
Overlaying contextual information such as a maximum allowable ﬁle size range allows 
for quick visual clarity regarding which ﬁles are below the range, within the range, 
and exceeding the range. The Revit ﬁles that are denoted as exceeding the range can be 
marked for further analysis because of their nonconformance.
Chapter 9: Advanced Modeling and Massing
Create and schedule massing studies.  Starting the design process with actual building  
elements can lead to a lot of unexpected frustration. Walls lead to rooms, which get room 
tags and are eventually scheduled. If you have failed to fulﬁll the client’s program, you will 
wonder where to start over!
Master It  You are faced with creating some design studies of a large hospital complex. 
How would you go about creating a Revit project that would allow you to create a mass-
ing study and schedule it against the design client’s program?
Solution  Massing studies allow you to create schedules of the surface, ﬂoor areas, and 
volumes of a mass. This is incredibly helpful for resolving the design intent and client’s 
program before committing to walls, ﬂoors, and other building geometry.

Know when to use solid and surface masses.  Solid masses and surface masses can both be 
used to maintain relationships to host geometry such as walls and roofs, but surface masses 
cannot be volumetrically scheduled or contain ﬂoor area faces.
Master It  You have been asked to create a complex canopy system for the entry to a ho-
tel project. The system will consist of a complex wave of triangular panels. What kind of 
mass would you create?
Solution  You are probably going to be better off not creating a solid mass because you 
do not need a solid—you need only a surface. It is best to use solids when you have to 
calculate the client’s overall design program: ﬂoor areas, surface, and volume. For lim-
ited, surface-based relationships, just use surface massing. Surface masses will help you 
resolve the overall design idea ﬁrst. Then you can move on to patterns and eventually 
component-level geometry.
Use mathematical formulas for massing.  Not all massing is going to involve intuitive, in-
the-moment decision-making. By discovering the underlying rules that express a form, you 
can create the formulas that can iterate and manipulate your massing study. So, rather than 
manually manipulating the mass, you manipulate the formulas related to your mass.
Master It  What is the best way to discover and create these formulas?
Solution  Never stop sketching! Staring at a blank spreadsheet is a one-way road to 
frustration. Sketch the idea and try to discern the rules that make the form change and 
morph into your design idea. Once you think you have discovered the rules that contain 
the idea, start testing the rules. Once you ﬁnd that the idea or principle is valid, it is sim-
ply a matter of scale.
Chapter 10: Conceptual Design
Get started with Autodesk Dynamo.  Dynamo has a simple, straightforward UI. Becoming 
comfortable with the parts of the user interface can allow you more ﬂexibility and lower frus-
tration when learning the application, either as a novice or on your road to becoming an expert.
Master It  What are the four primary sections of the user interface?
Solution  The following are the four primary sections of the Dynamo UI:
 
◆
The toolbar
 
◆
Node Library
 
◆
Workspace
 
◆
Execution Bar
Connect nodes to make data ﬂow.  Connecting nodes is the true power behind Dynamo. The con-
nections visually and programmatically show data ﬂow and the path of information from beginning 
to end to create the form, run the analysis, or provide whatever is the desired output. Understanding 
the basics of connecting nodes is the ﬁrst step to creating your own Dynamo deﬁnition.
Master It  Describe the workﬂow to create a series of nodes and connect them properly.
Solution  Nodes are added by searching for them in the Node Library and adding 
them to the workspace. This can be done via dynamic search or by browsing through the 

CHAPTER 11: WORKING WITH PHASING, GROUPS, AND DESIGN OPTIONS  | 949
library and clicking a node. Once added to the workspace, nodes output on the right and 
input on the left. Connecting nodes is done by dragging the right (output) of one node to 
the left (input) of another node, creating a sequence for the data to ﬂow. The sequence or 
deﬁnition is the visual program.
Use additional Dynamo tools.  While Dynamo is a robust programming application, there 
are additional tools you can use to further leverage its capabilities.
Master It  Describe some of the tools external to Dynamo and how they can be used to 
push the capabilities of the application even further.
Solution  Several applications can interface with Dynamo. The ﬁrst and most obvious 
one is Revit. Revit can be used as a workspace of sorts to create geometry or as a data set 
to pull information from if you want to perform any type of analysis on your project ﬁle. 
Excel is another application that can help feed long lists of data (numbers, strings, and so 
on) into Dynamo to cut down on manual entry or as a pass-through application. In this 
last example, you might pull room areas from an Excel-based building program and push 
them into Dynamo to test designed room sizes. Finally, there is the Dynamo package 
manager that allows more advanced users a way to give back to the Dynamo community 
and create their own nodes and other content.
Understand the Autodesk FormIt to Revit workﬂow.  FormIt was designed to optimize 
model interoperability between the conceptual design phase and schematic design phase, 
when most Revit models get started.
Master It  Describe the FormIt to Revit workﬂow and note the key beneﬁts.
Solution  FormIt models are meant to optimize interoperability between early project 
phases. Not only is the geometry interoperable, but it also has other model traits such as 
project orientation, location, and materiality.
Chapter 11: Working with Phasing, Groups,  
and Design Options
Use the Phasing tools to create, demolish, and propose a new design.  Time is such an 
important element to the design process and nearly impossible to capture with traditional 
CAD tools. Do not use phasing for construction sequencing (there is a better way). Embrace 
phasing for communication, not just illustration.
Master It  How can you use phasing to communicate your design across a series of key 
stages? What kind of project is best suited to phasing?
Solution  From the Manage tab, you can access the settings for phases. You can create 
phases for the major stages of work in your project as well as deﬁne ﬁlters and graphic 
overrides to illustrate the overall design approach. Use the Phase and Phase Filter view 
properties to customize project views, including schedules. Set the Phase Created and 
Phase Demolished properties of model elements to adapt to the project phases. Any kind 
of project can use phasing, but tenant improvement projects beneﬁt the most from the 
ability to document existing conditions and demolition.
Understand and use groups.  Groups are great for creating collections of both host and 
family component geometry. Just remember to apply best practices, and you will avoid a 
lot of common roadblocks. Individual model elements within groups will always appear 

950 | APPENDIX A THE BOTTOM LINE
properly in schedules, as you would expect. Finally, creating exceptions in groups allows you 
to make subtle changes without creating a new group.
Master It  Why should you not mirror groups?
Solution  Although mirroring works conceptually, it breaks down in implementation. 
Just because you can mirror something in Revit does not mean that it can actually be 
manufactured that way. And even more confusion can result if the mirrored object has 
to be powered, accessed, maintained, and so on, in an impossible condition. Mirroring 
groups has been known to create so much hassle that you are better off avoiding it.
Create and use design options.  Like groups, design options work great when you follow the 
rules. Design options are intended for design iteration that is bounded and well-deﬁned, not for 
putting multiple buildings in one project ﬁle. Remember that links, groups, and phasing can exist 
within design options. Always keep hosted elements with their host when using design options.
Master It  Suppose you have a multistory tower. How could you show multiple design 
options for the entire vertical exterior enclosure?
Solution  Put each enclosure option in a different project ﬁle. You can link these ﬁles 
into one master project ﬁle. Then associate each of the links with a different design 
 option. Eventually you set and accept the primary option. Then bind the link, and the 
chosen enclosure model will become a group within your project. The group can be  
ungrouped to continue editing the ﬁnal design.
Chapter 12: Visualization
Create real-time and rendered analytic visualizations.  Analytic visualization is the 
concept of communicating information about your project in a nonliteral way, and it’s very 
important! It’s not about showing real materials in the project but about using ﬁlters to visu-
alize important metadata.
Master It  During the renovation of a space, you want to reuse the doors rather than 
throw them away. How would you illustrate this?
Solution  Assign an instance parameter to the doors called Recycled. Then apply this 
value to all the doors fulﬁlling these criteria in your project. Now you can use this pa-
rameter to create a view ﬁlter to illustrate where these reused doors are being used.
Render emotive photorealistic visualizations.  Photorealistic visualization is about com-
municating design ideas but in emotive ways that are much closer to how the space will be 
experienced, including real lighting, materials, and entourage. Just remember that the time it 
takes to calculate and render your views will change dramatically based on the quality and 
resolution of your views.
Master It  Would the rendering for a PowerPoint presentation differ from a rendering 
being printed for a marketing brochure?
Solution  The rendering for the PowerPoint presentation needs to be only about 150 dpi, 
whereas the rendering for the printing needs to be 300 dpi. A 300 dpi image will take much 
longer to render than a 150 dpi image, even though they’ll look the same on the screen.
Understand the importance of sequencing your visualization workﬂow.  The sequence 
of design—building, content, materials, and cameras—is not the same as the sequence for 
visualization (geometry/cameras, lighting, materials). Lighting is far more important than 

CHAPTER 13: CREATING WALLS AND CURTAIN WALLS | 951
materials of actual objects. Get the lighting right and the materials will look great, but not the 
other way around.
Master It  How do you create a rendering environment that replaces the actual materials 
with matte materials in order to study the effects of lighting on your design?
Solution  Use Phase Filter to create a material override, and assign this analytic ﬁlter to 
the view that you’re rendering.
Understand what virtual reality (VR) means to your practice.  There must be a reason to 
pursue VR; simply engaging in it because it is the emerging technology will cause you to miss 
the mark. To effectively pursue VR, be sure to identify the use cases, such as design review or 
marketing. Once you have established the use cases, only then invest in the appropriate tools.
Master It  What is the difference between VR and augmented reality (AR)?
Solution  Virtual reality is an immersive 3D simulation that is viewed as reality. 
Augmented reality is the compositing of imagery to what is physically being seen.
Chapter 13: Creating Walls and Curtain Walls
Use extended modeling techniques for basic walls.  Walls in Revit are made from layers of 
materials that can represent everything from generic placeholders for design layouts to com-
plete assemblies representative of actual construction.
Master It  How can you customize the proﬁle of a wall?
Solution  A wall can be attached to another object such as a roof, ﬂoor, or reference 
plane. Select a wall, activate the Attach Top/Base tool, and pick the object to which the 
wall should be attached. You can also edit the proﬁle of a wall in elevation by selecting a 
wall, activating the Edit Proﬁle tool, and modifying the sketch of the wall.
Create stacked walls.  Exterior walls are usually composed of several combinations of 
materials with varying thicknesses. These various wall types can be combined into a single 
entity called a stacked wall.
Master It  How do you create a stacked wall?
Solution  You must duplicate an existing stacked wall type within a project. In Type 
Properties, open the Edit Assembly dialog box and add any combination of basic walls 
into the stacked wall structure.
Create simple curtain walls.  A curtain wall is an assembly of parts including curtain 
grids, panels, and mullions. They can be created in predeﬁned types with regular horizontal 
and vertical spacing along with speciﬁc panel and mullion types.
Master It  How do you add a door to a curtain wall?
Solution  Use the Tab key to select a single panel in a curtain wall segment. If the panel 
is part of a predeﬁned system, you must unpin the panel ﬁrst. From the Type Selector, 
choose a curtain panel door family.
Create complex curtain walls.  The Revit conceptual massing environment can be used to 
create complex curtain wall conﬁgurations. Pattern-based panel families can be loaded into 
the massing environment and populated on a divided surface. These populated surfaces can 
then be loaded and placed in a project model for documentation and scheduling.

952 | APPENDIX A THE BOTTOM LINE
Master It  How do you create a complex divided surface?
Solution  From the Recent Files window, select New Conceptual Mass. Add a second 
level to the family and draw a curved line on each level. Select the two lines and click 
Create Form; choose the Planar Surface option. Select the new form and click the Divide 
Surface button on the ribbon.
Chapter 14: Modeling Floors, Ceilings, and Roofs
Understand ﬂoor modeling methods.  Floors make up one of the most fundamental, 
sketch-based system families used in a Revit model. You can customize them to accommo-
date a variety of assumptions at various stages of design.
Master It  How can you create a structural ﬂoor with integrated metal decking?
Solution  You can create a structural ﬂoor by going to the Architecture tab of the rib-
bon and clicking Floor Structural Floor. This tool activates the Structural parameter in a 
ﬂoor’s instance properties. Once this is activated, edit the ﬂoor’s type properties to add a 
Structural Deck layer and assign a deck proﬁle.
Model various ﬂoor ﬁnishes.  Thick and thin ﬂoor ﬁnishes can be created to support tag-
ging, scheduling, and quantity takeoffs.
Master It  How would you represent a thin ﬁnish material in your project such as carpet?
Solution  Activate the Split Face tool from the Modify tab of the ribbon, select a ﬂoor, and 
deﬁne the boundaries of the area to be assigned as the thin material. Activate the Paint 
tool, select the appropriate material, and click the split face you created within the ﬂoor.
Create ceilings.  Ceilings are sketch-based system families that can host objects such as 
light ﬁxtures and HVAC diffusers.
Master It  What is the best way to model a ceiling within a space?
Solution  Ceilings are best created in a ceiling plan. Activate the Ceiling tool from the 
Build panel in the Architecture tab of the ribbon. Specify a value for the Height Offset 
From Level setting of the ceiling in the Properties palette, and use Automatic Ceiling to 
ﬁll a bounded space with a ceiling object.
Understand roof modeling methods.  Roofs can be modeled as simple single-pitch shed 
roofs or complex extrusions of sinuous curves.
Master It  What is the best way to create a single vault roof?
Solution  That roof is best created with the Roof By Extrusion method. Go to the 
Architecture tab of the ribbon and click Roof ➢ Roof By Extrusion. Specify a wall or  
reference plane as the work plane and switch to an elevation, section, or 3D view. Draw 
the proﬁle of a vaulted roof and click Finish Edit Mode. Adjust the extents of the extru-
sion as desired.
Work with advanced shape editing for ﬂoors and roofs.  A small but powerful toolset 
is available for extended editing of ﬂoor and roof objects. These tools allow you to create 
warped ﬂoor slabs and tapered layers of roof assemblies.
Master It  How do you create a drainage point in a ﬂat roof slab?
Solution  Select a roof object and activate the Add Split Line tool from the Shape Editing 
panel in the ribbon. Draw two crossing lines from the four corners of the roof boundaries. 

CHAPTER 15: DESIGNING WITH THE FAMILY EDITOR | 953
Activate the Modify Sub Elements tool and select the point where the split lines cross. 
Change the value that appears to create a low drainage depression in the slab.
Chapter 15: Designing with the Family Editor
Get started with a family.  Before you start to create your own family components, take a 
moment to think about how you expect that component to “behave” in your project. The role 
of the Family Editor is not just an environment to model geometry; it also determines how 
the content that you create will behave in the project environment.
Master It  Choosing the right template is critical. You can convert from one family tem-
plate to another, but this is not always the case. Why would you want to choose a door 
template rather than a Generic Model template?
Solution  Balusters, curtain panels, detail components, and hosted elements all have 
speciﬁc, predeﬁned behavior. Plan ahead when you are creating these categories. Objects 
that need to “cut” their host, like doors and windows, must be created in templates that 
are hardwired to contain a portion of the host that will be cut. This allows you to create 
the door or window and also cut the host in the way that it needs to cut in the project.
Create the framework for a family component.  Reference planes, points, and lines are the 
“bones” of your component. Assign parameters to the skeleton, and the geometry will follow 
along. Be sure to test the parameter and reference relationships before you start to create any 
solid model geometry.
Master It  Why should you build, assign parameters to, and test the references ﬁrst? 
Why not just model the geometry?
Solution  Testing the references and parameters before you add geometry keeps things 
simple and helps you troubleshoot parametric behavior before building the geometry. 
Remember to keep parametric dimensions outside of Sketch mode so you and others can 
easily ﬁnd them later. After you have tested the parameters and references successfully, 
you can be conﬁdent that your geometry will behave predictably.
Understand family modeling techniques.  Although the Family Editor contains a wide 
assortment of modeling and editing tools, you do not always need to build everything in one 
ﬁle. You can use a number of techniques to reduce redundancy and manage complex geom-
etry for a component family.
Master It  When would you consider using the technique of nesting families? How 
could this method improve the efﬁciency of a component family?
Solution  Anytime you need to create a repetitive element within a family, you should 
consider using a nested family. This method allows you to build the repetitive element 
only once, and you will maintain better control of the placement of the nested component 
within its host. You can also use multiple nested families as a way to explore various de-
sign solutions for a component or to efﬁciently manage subcomponents, such as different 
hardware types for a door.
Apply extended family management techniques.  Sometimes parametric behavior 
will depend on the parameters that directly control it, but often these parameters will be 
expressed as a relationship to something else.

954 | APPENDIX A THE BOTTOM LINE
Master It  Why are formulas so important? Why not just create the parameters you need 
and then modify them as needed in the project environment?
Solution  Formulaic relationships help maintain rules within a family so that chang-
ing one rule can have an effect on many others. Using formulas, therefore, allows you to 
drive one parameter based on the value of another, and the result can drive a length, ma-
terial, or other rules-based value. When you have many parametric-type permutations, it 
is better not to weigh your project down with a lot of options that you’ll probably never 
use. Whenever this happens, do not load all the possible types in your project—just turn 
to a type catalog in order to select only the family types that you need. Since you do not 
want to have to remember all of these relationships manually, allow Revit to maintain 
them for you.
Chapter 16: Creating Stairs and Railings
Understand the key components of stairs and railings.  Having a complete understand-
ing of the components of stairs is important. You do not want to set about breaking the rules 
until you understand how best (and when) those rules can be broken.
Master It  What are the essential parts of stairs?
Solution  Baluster posts, balusters, and baluster panels along with handrail proﬁles are 
the essential parts of any railing. Nosings, stringers, and treads are the essential parts of 
stairs. Having a ﬁrm understanding of how these components react to changes in their 
respective dialog boxes is critical.
Understand the different stair tools and apply them to custom designs.  Designing in a 
spreadsheet is hard. Step back and consider what you are trying to accomplish. If you will 
look at the components that make up stairs, you will see some interesting opportunities.
Master It  How would you create a continuous tread that was not monolithic? What 
would you do if you wanted to create a custom stringer? Are balusters always vertical 
and used to support handrails? What if your particular stair just cannot be modeled in 
the Stairs tool?
Solution  Try using the nosing proﬁle to complement the shape of your tread. Do not 
forget that a handrail proﬁle can be used to create a custom stringer proﬁle with little 
trouble. Although balusters often support handrails, this is not always the case. Balusters 
may also consist of the support element that will support the tread. A complex baluster 
family associated with the railing as the start post can create the most complex railing 
conditions quickly and easily. But if all else fails, remember that there is still the Family 
Editor. Just model it the way you want it and then put it in the project. It is probably more 
sculpture than stair at this point. Modeling it in the Family Editor means that you will be 
able to move, elevate, rotate, and copy the results throughout the project. If you have to 
make changes (and you will), you will simply open the component in the Family Editor.
Design railings and use the Railing tool for other model elements.  From model patterns 
to geometric intricacy, there is a lot that can be created with the Railing tool. When this does 
not work, look to the curtain wall for “railings” that can contain space and allow “balusters” 
to be conveniently unlocked.
Master It  Why would you not use a railing to manage repetitive relationships? What if 
you need to accurately distribute geometry along a path?

CHAPTER 17: DETAILING YOUR DESIGN | 955
Solution  Modeling these railings as components in the Family Editor is often faster 
than creating groups and then copying them throughout the project. Railings are also 
helpful for creating geometry that needs to be distributed along paths, even if the results 
are not actually railings. Finally, do not use geometry when a model pattern will do. This 
will keep your project light.
Implement best practices.  There are speciﬁc best practices when creating custom stairs and 
railings. Pay attention to nesting geometry, maintaining the right level of detail, and ﬁltering 
schedules so the metadata ends up in the right place.
Master It  Is it possible to create solutions that are too efﬁcient? What is the big deal with 
detail levels? Finally, what is the most important thing to remember before creating an 
elegant workaround?
Solution  You are not the only person working on the project! Design is a team sport, 
and any out-of-the-box exceptions to the rules need to be understood by the entire team. 
“Over modeling” is often misunderstood to mean “too much geometry,” but geometry is 
critically important to understanding how your design is going to be assembled. So if you 
will take the time to assign levels of detail to components, it will help refresh views and 
printing. Finally, remember that the best solution is the one that is implementable. If your 
team does not understand your “hack,” you are not being a team player and the project 
may ultimately suffer.
Chapter 17: Detailing Your Design
Create details.  Details in Revit are a combination of 2D elements layered on top of 3D 
model elements or sometimes just stacked on top of each other. Creating good, easy-to-read 
details typically requires some embellishment of the 3D model.
Master It  What are the three primary categories of detail elements, and how are they used?
Solution  Detail lines are used to create two-dimensional linework of various weights 
and styles. They are used for drafting, much as you would draft in a CAD application. 
Filled regions and masking regions are the two region types that are used to apply pat-
terns (even if that pattern is a solid-white ﬁeld) against your details. These can help to 
show context such as materiality. Components such as detail components and detail 
groups are used to create 2D families that can be used and reused in a variety of details 
within the model. They are historically used to create elements such as blocking, metal 
studs, metal deck, and so on.
Add detail components to families.  You can make creating details in Revit easier by 
adding some of the detail elements directly to the family. In this way, when you cut sec-
tions, make callouts, or enlarge plan conditions, your “smart” details can begin to construct 
themselves.
Master It  Because you don’t always want elements to appear in every scale of a view, 
how can you both add detail elements to your families and still limit the amount of  
information that is shown in any given view?
Solution  Using the detail levels (Coarse, Medium, and Fine), you can control the visibil-
ity of any element within a family to show, or not show, at those settings. By controlling 
the detail level, you can keep the family simple in a Coarse view and add more detail as 
the drawing gets increasingly complex.

956 | APPENDIX A THE BOTTOM LINE
Learn efﬁcient detailing.  As you master detailing in Revit, you’ll begin to learn tips and 
tricks to make your process of creating details more efﬁcient.
Master It  To help you assess how much effort you should be putting into your details, 
what are three questions you should be asking yourself before starting any detail?
Solution  Before starting any detail, ask yourself these questions:
 
◆
Will I see or use this in other views in the project?
 
◆
Will it affect other aspects of the project (like material takeoffs)?
 
◆
How large is it?
Reuse details from other ﬁles.  In many project workﬂows, you will need to incorporate 
details from other projects. Reusing these details can aid in the speed and efﬁciency of  
project documentation.
Master It  There are several ways to reuse details from other projects. Name one and 
list the steps to perform the tasks necessary to quickly move a detail from one project to 
another.
Solution  Here are the steps to save views from one project for use in another project:
1. Start by opening the ﬁle with the views you want to save. Click the Application menu 
and select Save As Library Views.
2. The Save Views dialog box shows a list of view names on the left and a preview win-
dow on the right. Click the check box for each of the views you want to save into a sep-
arate ﬁle; click OK.
3. To import the views, open the project you’d like to import the views into, and choose 
Insert From File from the Insert tab. Choose Insert Views From File.
4. In the resulting dialog box, you will have a list of the views you can import from the 
column on the left and a preview of those views on the right. Select the box for the 
views you want to import, and click OK.
Chapter 18: Documenting Your Design
Document plans.  With ﬂoor plans you can create visual graphics that help deﬁne how 
a space is laid out. However, Revit provides other tools such as area plans to help you 
describe space.
Master It  List the four types of area plans that you can create, and note the two that 
Revit creates automatically.
Solution  The four types of area plans are rentable area, gross area, usable area, and 
BOMA area. The software provides automatic calculations to show rentable and gross 
areas.
Create schedules and legends.  Schedules are another view type; they allow you to show 
information about the model in a nongraphic format. Schedules can also be used to dynami-
cally report quantities of elements inside the model.
Master It  Understand how to create schedules and report additional information about 
the elements in the model. How would you create a simple casework schedule showing 
quantities of types?

CHAPTER 19: ANNOTATING YOUR DESIGN | 957
Solution  Here are the steps to create a schedule within Revit:
1. On the View tab, choose Schedule/Quantities from the Schedule button.
2. Choose Casework as a schedule category.
3. On the Fields tab, choose Family And Type followed by Quantity.
4. On the Sorting tab, choose to sort by Family And Type; make sure Itemize Every 
Instance is checked. When that’s done, click OK.
Lay out sheets.  Eventually in a project it will become necessary to create sheets that will 
become the documentation set. Knowing how to create a good sheet set provides you with 
another venue to communicate with contractors, clients, and other team members.
Master It  To properly create a sheet set, you need to understand the dynamics of adding 
views to a sheet. In the Revit environment, there is only one way to add views to a sheet. 
What is it?
Solution  Views can be added to a sheet by dragging them from the Project Browser 
and dropping them onto the sheet. From that point, they can be edited or manipulated to 
properly place them relative to other views that appear on that sheet.
Chapter 19: Annotating Your Design
Annotate with text and keynotes.  Although a picture is worth a thousand words, you still 
need notes to make drawings understandable and be able to call out key elements in each 
view. Know how to create and modify text and keynotes for a complete set of documents.
Master It  To properly use the keynoting feature, you’ll need to understand what each of 
the three keynote types do and how they’re used. List each, and explain how they can be 
used in a project.
Solution  Element keynotes annotate assemblies such as walls, ﬂoors, and roofs. 
Material keynotes designate materials within Revit, such as concrete, gypsum board, or 
rigid insulation. User keynotes are not tied to an element or a material and can be used to 
note other aspects of the view or detail.
Use tags.  Tags are text labels for elements such as doors, walls, windows, rooms, and sev-
eral other objects that architects typically need to reference in a set of drawings. These tags 
typically refer to other schedules or information in other portions of the drawing set and are 
unique to the view in which they are inserted.
Master It  Inserting tags quickly can be a good way to make documentation time more 
efﬁcient. How can you quickly tag a number of elements in the model at the same time?
Solution  Use the Tag All tool. This tool allows you to load several tags for different 
elements at the same time and populate a view with all those tag types at once. You will 
probably need to manipulate the location of some of the tags, but most should be placed 
cleanly and accurately, saving you time for other portions of the project.
Add dimensions.  Dimensioning is a critical part of the project documentation, allowing 
you to communicate the distance elements are from one another.
Master It  Adding dimensions is a necessary part in any project. However, in a project 
workﬂow you will typically want to change the location of a dimension’s witness line 
without having to re-create the entire dimension. How do you move a witness line with-
out remaking the entire dimension?

958 | APPENDIX A THE BOTTOM LINE
Solution  Highlight the dimension string and grab the blue grip that is below the text string. 
By clicking and holding this element, you can now select a new host for the witness line.
Set project and shared parameters.  Revit Architecture lets users add as many custom 
parameters to an element as are needed to document the project. These parameters can be 
both tagged and scheduled, depending on how they are made.
Master It  You need to add a custom parameter for your project to track the percentage 
of recycled content in materials. What’s the best way to go about doing this?
Solution  Since the items you want to track need to be scheduled but not tagged, it’s 
easiest to do this with a project parameter. Add one to the project for a percentage of re-
cycled content and then track that in a multi-category schedule showing all the material 
types you want to track.
Chapter 20: Working in the Construction Phase
Add revisions to your project.  You need the ability to track changes in your design 
after sheets have been issued. Adding revisions to a drawing is an inevitable part of your 
workﬂow.
Master It  How do you indicate revisions on a drawing sheet?
Solution  First, a revision must be created in the Sheet Issues/Revisions dialog box. 
Then, a revision cloud is drafted in either an active view or a sheet. The revision cloud 
is assigned to one of the project revisions in the Properties palette. Finally, the revision 
cloud is tagged. The revisions are automatically tracked in revision schedules that are 
part of the title block.
Use digital markups.  DWFs provide a lightweight means to digitally transfer and mark up 
multiple sheets in a document set.
Master It  Explain the workﬂow using DWF markups.
Solution  Once your views are drawn and placed on sheets, export the sheets to a DWFx 
format. They can be shared with other members of your team for markup. Others will 
open the DWFx in Design Review and create the comments and then send the marked-
up set back to the design team. This set is then linked back into the drawing set, and the 
markups will be visible on the drawing sheets.
Model for construction.  Parts and assemblies allow a model element to be broken down 
into smaller parts. These subelements can be used in more detailed ways for the construction 
process while still maintaining their association with the original element.
Master It  Describe the method for breaking down a design-based model assembly into 
its individual components.
Solution  Select a wall, ﬂoor, roof, or ceiling and use the Create Parts tool. The view 
may need to be set to Show Parts. Once parts are created, they can be divided, merged, or 
excluded.

CHAPTER 21: PRESENTING YOUR DESIGN | 959
Chapter 21: Presenting Your Design
Understand color ﬁll legends.  Color ﬁlls are a great way to illustrate data that otherwise 
might appear only in a schedule, such as department assignment, designed areas, and 
room ﬁnishes.
Master It  There are a variety of ways to graphically display information using color 
ﬁlls. It can initially take a bit of time to get things organized, but once you create the leg-
ends, they can easily be transferred between views and projects. Describe how to add a 
color ﬁll legend, once created, to your project template.
Solution  To add a color ﬁll legend from a project to your project template, add it to a 
view and add the view to a sheet. Legends can be transferred like schedules: once they 
are added to a sheet, they can be copied to the Clipboard and then pasted to the sheet in 
the project template. This will transfer all the colors, fonts, and other settings from the 
project to the template.
Use 3D model views in your presentation.  Revit provides a variety of ways to help you 
visualize your designs—both while designing and during presentation. Understanding 
where these features are located and how and when to use them can help expedite 
the presentation process, depending on the look and feel you want to create with 
your images.
Master It  Describe the process for creating an exploded 3D view of each level within 
your project.
Solution  After adjusting the view range of your plan views to accommodate the actual 
bottom of the level up to the top, open a 3D view and right-click the ViewCube. Select 
Orient To View and choose the ﬂoor plan for each level.
Work with viewport types.  Viewport types are simple to manage, but they are powerful 
when applied to the views you place on sheets. You can customize the view titles for any use 
case, from design presentations to construction documents.
Master It  Describe the process for adding a new viewport type to your project.
Solution  After placing a view on a sheet, select the view and click Edit Type in the 
Properties palette. Click Duplicate and create a uniquely named type. Once you have 
modiﬁed the settings, apply the new type to other views by selecting a viewport and 
picking the new type from the Type Selector.
Create “exploded” axonometric views.  The Displace Elements command is used to cre-
ate exploded axonometric views that used to be drafted by hand or created manually in a 
separate model. Understand the best ways to use this tool to help visualize and communicate 
design ideas.
Master It  Describe the process for creating a displaced view.
Solution  Starting in a 3D view, select elements to visually displace. The selections will 
be based on how you would like to see the elements grouped as you move them around 
within the view. By selecting elements and then selecting the Displace Elements tool, you 
can begin staging your axonometric view.

960 | APPENDIX A THE BOTTOM LINE
Chapter 22: Design Analysis
Embrace energy analysis concepts.  Understanding the concepts behind sustainable design 
is an important part of being able to perform analysis within the Revit model and a critical 
factor in today’s design environment.
Master It  What are four key methods for a holistic sustainable design?
Solution  Four key methods for a sustainable solution are (1) understanding a building’s 
climate, (2) reducing building loads, (3) using free energy when possible to power those 
loads, and (4) using efﬁcient systems.
Analyze your model for energy performance.  Being able to predict a building’s energy 
performance is a necessary part of designing sustainably. Although Revit doesn’t have an 
energy-modeling application built into it, it does have interoperability with many applica-
tions that have that functionality.
Master It  Explain the steps you need to take to get a Revit model ready for energy analysis.
Solution  The steps are as follows:
1. Make sure the building has walls, ﬂoors, and roofs. Those all need to meet and join so 
there are no unrealistic gaps in the model.
2. Make sure each of the regions in the model has a room element inserted into it and that 
the room element’s height is set to the bottom of the ﬂoor above.
3. Add a location to your building to ensure the correct environmental variables are 
taken into account.
4. Generate an energy model and run the analysis using Insight. Once the analysis is 
complete, you can further reﬁne the ﬁnal model.
Analyze your model for daylighting performance.  Understanding the concepts behind 
daylighting analysis is an important part of sustainable design. It is more than just under-
standing how light comes into a space; it is also understanding how the exterior and interior 
building design can help to bring light deeper into a building and provide a better quality of 
lighting overall.
Master It  What are the four primary items to consider when you’re looking to perform 
accurate daylighting analysis?
Solution  Transmittance, sheets of glass, materiality, and color.
 
◆
Transmittance. This describes how much light the glazing on the building will allow 
into the space.
 
◆
Sheets of glass. More sheets of glass will help energy consumption but can limit day-
lighting potential.
 
◆
Materiality. Once the light is in the building or space, the materials it comes into con-
tact with will impact how the light bounces around inside the room. Highly reﬂective 
materials can also create glare problems, so ﬁnding the right balance of reﬂectivity 
and diffusion is critical.
 
◆
Color. Different colors of materials will have different reﬂectivity and lighting value.

 Appendix B
Tips, Tricks, and Troubleshooting  
 This appendix provides some tips, tricks, and troubleshooting to help keep your project ﬁ les 
running smoothly. Listed here are some pointers to keep you from getting into trouble as well 
as a peppering of time-savers and other great ideas. 
 In this appendix, you will learn to

 Optimizing Performance 
 It should make sense that a smaller Revit ﬁ le on a fast computer with a good network will run 
the quickest. There is no real “typical” project ﬁ le size for Autodesk ® Revit ® projects, and a 
ﬁ le can range anywhere from 10 MB to well over 1 GB. We have found that a project with less 
square footage and with a lot of geometry and detail (such as a hospital) can be larger in ﬁ le size 
than a warehouse project, which has a lot of empty square footage. Because documentation is 
often an indication of project complexity, we have found as a good rule of thumb that for each 
documented sheet, your ﬁ le should be about 1 MB. So, a completed project of 100 full-size sheets 
should be about 100 MB. 
 Much of the variation depends on the level of detail in the model itself, the presence of 
imported geometry (2D CAD ﬁ les, Trimble SketchUp imports, and so on), the number of views 
you have, and the overall complexity. Obviously, your hardware conﬁ guration will also be a 
factor in determining the speed and operation of your models. 
 You can optimize your hardware in a number of ways to get the most out of the conﬁ guration you 
have. You should ﬁ rst look at the install requirements and recommended hardware specs for a com-
puter running Revit software. Autodesk has published those requirements on its website, and they 
are updated with each new version of the software. You can ﬁ nd the current specs at  www.autodesk
.com/Revit ; then choose System Requirements from the right side of the menu at the top of the page. 
 Beyond the default speciﬁ cations, you can do things to help keep your ﬁ les nimble. Here are 
some other recommendations: 
Use a 64-bit OS.  Revit likes RAM, and the more physical RAM it can use, the more model you 
can cache into active memory. Windows offers several versions of a 64-bit OS, but since Revit 2014, 
Windows 7 has been a minimum requirement. Using a 64-bit OS allows you to use as much RAM 
as you can pack into your machine. Note that Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 are also supported.

962 | APPENDIX B TIPS, TRICKS, AND TROUBLESHOOTING
Get a faster hard drive.  Chances are you are working on Revit on a local hard drive. If you 
are working on a large project with a central ﬁle, your local ﬁle will be on your computer’s 
hard drive. If you are working on a small project without worksharing enabled, there is a 
chance you might be working on your local drive if you are taking the ﬁle home or if you do 
not have a network. Regardless, one of the things that will affect performance is your drive 
speed. This is how fast your computer can read/write to the local drive (input/output or I/O 
speed). With the large ﬁles Revit can create, a faster drive will equal less read/write time, so  
if it is within your budget, try to get a solid state drive (SSD) or a 7200 rpm hard disk drive (HDD) 
as a minimum. We have found the SSD, especially in a laptop, is a huge performance boost. 
You will appreciate the difference.
Get a good graphics card.  Revit is also very graphics-intensive and will push the limits of 
any video card you have in your computer. Although many graphics cards are available at a 
variety of performance and price levels, a good starting point is looking for ones that have 
been tested and approved by Autodesk for use with Revit. For many operations, a gaming-
grade card may be more cost-effective than a workstation equivalent. You can ﬁnd recom-
mended system hardware as well as graphics hardware and driver speciﬁcations at  
www.autodesk.com/graphics-hardware-detail.
Figure out how much RAM your project will need.  Before you e-mail your IT department 
requesting 64 GB of RAM, ﬁgure out how much you are actually going to use on your project. 
Your OS and other applications such as Microsoft Outlook will use some of your RAM, but you 
can calculate how much RAM Revit will need to work effectively. The formula is as follows:
Model size in Microsoft Windows Explorer × 20 + Linked file size(s) × 20 = Active 
RAM needed (in megabytes)
Let’s look at a couple of examples to demonstrate how it works. You have a Revit ﬁle with no 
linked ﬁles, and your ﬁle size on your server is 150 MB. So, you will need 150 MB × 20 = 3000 MB, 
or 3 GB, of RAM just for Revit to operate effectively. In another example, you have a 120 MB 
ﬁle, a 50 MB structural model linked in, and four CAD ﬁles at 1 MB each. The calculation is 
as follows:
(120 MB × 20) + (50 MB × 20) + (4 MB × 20) = 3480 MB or 3.5 GB of RAM
Manage your views.  There are two things you can do using views to help improve perfor-
mance. First, the more views you have open at once, the more information you will load into 
active RAM. It is easy to have many views open at once, even if you are concentrating on only 
a few views. Close windows you are not using to help minimize the drain on your resources. 
You can always close all the windows except your active one using the Close Hidden 
Windows tool. Choose the View tab and click the Close Hidden button (Figure B.1). You 
can map a keyboard shortcut to this command such as “XX,” or you can ﬁnd it in the Quick 
Access toolbar. The Close Hidden Windows command will close the hidden windows in your 
active project as well as all other open projects and families in your current session of Revit.
Figure B.1 
Closing hidden 
windows

OPTIMIZING PERFORMANCE | 963
The other way to manage your views is to get rid of the ones you do not need. Revit allows 
you to make different views within your model quickly and easily. This can sometimes lead 
to having a lot of views (sometimes hundreds) that you are not using in your document set 
and do not plan to use. Adding too many views can raise your overall ﬁle size even if you 
have not added any geometry or annotations within those views. More important, having 
more views means having more to manage. You will need to spend more time searching for 
valid views while wading through the superﬂuous. Get rid of those unused views—typically 
views that are not on sheets—to help keep your ﬁle running smoothly. We discuss how to 
create a schedule to help identify the unused views later in this appendix.
Delete or unload unused CAD ﬁles.  There are many times in a project process when you 
will want to load content from another source as a background. This could be a client’s CAD 
as-built drawings or a consultant’s MEP design. You might link these ﬁles into your draw-
ing and, during the busy course of the project, forget about them. As you have seen from the 
earlier tips on RAM use, all these small ﬁles add up. Getting rid of them can speed up your 
Revit project ﬁle and is just good housekeeping. If the CAD ﬁle is linked, you can remove it 
using the Manage Links button on the Insert tab. If the CAD ﬁles have been inserted instead 
of linked, right-click an instance of the CAD ﬁle in a view and choose Select All Instances 
from the context menu. Then click Delete to remove all the instances in the entire model as 
opposed to only the CAD ﬁle in the active view.
Link Instead of Import
As a general rule of thumb, we highly recommend linking CAD ﬁles instead of inserting them. 
You will notice a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in model performance as you get more and more CAD ﬁles 
into your model.
Do not explode imported CAD ﬁles.  A CAD ﬁle, when imported into Revit, is a collection 
of objects managed as a single entity. If you explode a CAD ﬁle, the single object immediately 
becomes many objects—and these all take up space in the ﬁle, requiring more resources to 
track and coordinate.
If you are importing DWG ﬁles, leave them unexploded as much as possible. If you need to 
hide lines, use the Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box to turn layers on and off. Explode 
only when you need to change the imported geometry, and start with a partial explode to 
minimize the number of new entities. Figure B.2 shows the tools available on the ribbon 
when you select an imported or linked DWG ﬁle. Also note that lines smaller than 1/32″  
(∼1 mm) are not retained when CAD ﬁles are exploded. This can result in unusable imports.
Figure B.2 
Explode options

964 | APPENDIX B TIPS, TRICKS, AND TROUBLESHOOTING
A better workﬂow than importing your CAD ﬁles directly into the project is to import them 
into a Detail Component family and then load that family into the project. This approach 
will also aid in keeping accidents from happening, like a novice user exploding the imported 
CAD. An example of this workﬂow is to import a SketchUp model into a mass family and 
then load the mass family into a project ﬁle. This workﬂow is covered in more detail in 
Chapter 7, “Interoperability: Working Multiplatform.”
Turn on volume computation only as needed.  Calculating the volumes on a large ﬁle can 
slow down your model speed immensely. This setting is typically turned on when export-
ing to gbXML, but sometimes teams forget to turn it back off again. Volumes will recalculate 
each time you edit a room, move a wall, or change any of the building geometry. Turn these 
off using the Area And Volume Computations dialog box found at the bottom of the Room & 
Area panel on the Home tab (Figure B.3).
Figure B.3

unneeded 
computations.
Using Best Practices
Good ﬁle maintenance is critical to keeping your ﬁles running smoothly and your ﬁle sizes low. 
The following are some best practices and workﬂows that were identiﬁed in other areas of the 
book but are consolidated here as a quick reference:
Manage the amount of information shown in views.  Learn to manage the amount of 
information needed in a given view. Minimize the view depth and the level of detail so you 
do not show more than you need to show in a view.

USING BEST PRACTICES | 965
Minimize the level of detail.  Set your detail level, found in the view control bar, relative 
to your drawing scale. For example, if you are working on a 1/32″ = 1′-0″ (1:500) plan, you 
probably do not need Detail Level set to Fine. This will cause the view to have a higher level 
of detail than the printed sheet can show, and you will end up with not only black blobs on 
your sheets but also views that are slow to open and print.
Minimize view detail.  Along with the amount of detail you turn on in the view using the Detail 
Level tool, make sure you are not showing more than you need to show. For instance, if you have 
wall studs shown in a 1/16″ = 1′-0″ (1:200) scale plan or the extruded aluminum window section 
shown in a building section, chances are it will not represent properly when printed. Turning off 
those elements in your view will keep things moving smoother as well as printing cleaner.
Minimize view depth.  View depth and crop regions are great tools to enhance performance. 
As an example, a typical building section is shown in Figure B.4. The default behavior causes 
Revit to regenerate all the model geometry to the full depth of that view every time you open 
the view. To reduce the amount of geometry that needs to be redrawn, drag the section’s far 
clip plane (the blue dashed line when you highlight the section) in close to the cutting plane.
Figure B.4 
Minimizing the 
view depth

966 | APPENDIX B TIPS, TRICKS, AND TROUBLESHOOTING
Model only what you need.  Although it is possible to model to a small level of detail, do 
not fall into the trap of over-modeling. Be smart about what you choose to model and how 
much detail you plan to show. If it is not conveying information about the project, maybe 
it is not really needed. The amount of information you do or do not model should be based 
on your project size and complexity, your timeframe, what you need to document, and 
your comfort level with the software. The amount of information required in the model is 
also inﬂuenced by the LOD requirements of the project. LODs are discussed in Chapter 1, 
“Understanding the Principles of BIM.”
Use three rules of thumb when deciding how much to model.  When you are trying  
to decide how much detail to put into a model or even a family, there are three good rules 
of thumb to help you make the right decision for the particular element you are looking 
to create.
Scale  What scale will this detail be seen in? If it is a small scale (such as 3″ = 1′-0″), it 
might be simpler to just draw it in 2D in a drafting view.
Repetition  How many times will this detail appear in the drawing set? If it will appear 
in only one location or only one time, it might be easier to just draft it in 2D rather than 
try to model the element. If it will appear in several locations, modeling is the better solu-
tion. The more exposure an element has in the model (the more views it shows in), the 
more reasons you have to model it. For example, doors are good to model. They show in 
elevations and plans all over the sheet set.
Quality  Be honest—how good at modeling families are you? Do not bite off more than 
you can chew. If you are new to the software, keep it simple, use 2D components, and 
keep the parametric properties to a minimum. The more projects you complete, the better 
you will understand the transition to a BIM workﬂow.
Do not over-constrain.  Embedding user-deﬁned constraints into families and the model 
helps keep important information constant. However, if you do not need to lock a relation-
ship, do not do it. Over-constraining the model can cause problems later in the project pro-
cess when you want to move or modify locked elements. Constrain only when necessary. 
Otherwise, let the model be free. However, if you do over-constrain your model, Revit has a 
feature to show you where the constraints are located in any given view. In the view control 
bar at the bottom of the screen is the Show Constraints tool (Figure B.5).
Figure B.5 
Finding constrained 
objects with the Show 
Constraints tool
Watch out for imported geometry.  Although you have the ability to use geometry from 
several other ﬁle sources, use caution when doing so. Remember that everything you link 
into a project or a family takes up around 20 times the ﬁle size in your system’s RAM. So, 
linking a 60 MB NURBS-based ceiling design will equal 2 GB of RAM and more than likely 
slow down your model. Deleting unused CAD ﬁles, using linking rather than importing, and 
cleaning up the CAD geometry before insertion will help keep problems to a minimum.

USING BEST PRACTICES | 967
Purge unused ﬁles and family types.  You will ﬁnd that you will not use every family, 
group, or material you create in your model. Revit has a tool that will allow you to get rid 
of those unused elements to help keep your ﬁle sizes down to a reasonable level. This tool, 
Purge Unused, can be found on the Manage tab in the Settings panel. If your ﬁle is large, it 
can take several minutes to run, but eventually you will be presented with a list (Figure B.6) 
of all the unused elements within your ﬁle.
Figure B.6 
Use the Purge 
Unused dialog 
box to reduce 
ﬁle size.
We will discuss the Purge Unused command in greater detail later in this appendix.
Model correctly from the beginning.  As you reﬁne your design, it is critical to model cor-
rectly right from the beginning, not taking shortcuts, so you do not have to ﬁx things later. 
If you can begin by thinking about how your project will be assembled, it will save you a lot 
of time later in the process. It is good practice to plan ahead, but remember that the software 
will allow you to make major changes at any stage in the process and still maintain coordi-
nation. If you are still in an early phase of design and do not know the exact wall type, use 
generic walls to capture your design intent; changing them later will be simple.
Manage workshared ﬁles.  When employing worksharing on a project, you will want 
to follow additional tools and tips. Check out Chapter 5, “Collaborating with a Team,” for 
more details.

968 | APPENDIX B TIPS, TRICKS, AND TROUBLESHOOTING
Make a new local copy at least once a week.  In a workshared environment, your local 
copy can begin to perform poorly or grow in ﬁle size while the central ﬁle remains small and 
nimble. If this is the case, it might be time to throw out the old local copy for a new one. Keep 
in mind that Revit allows you to make a new local copy upon opening the central ﬁle. When 
you choose a central model from a network location, Revit will automatically make a new 
local copy and place it in your Documents folder. If you choose not to follow that workﬂow, 
keep in mind that if you are accessing a project on a daily basis, it is a good idea to make a 
new local copy at least once a week. Also consider making a new local copy if your team has 
been working for a few days without you, as syncing all of their changes can take a lot of 
time for an out-of-date ﬁle.
Divide your model.  For larger projects or campus-style projects, you can break up your 
model into smaller submodels that are linked together. You can also do this on a single, large 
building, although it is a bit more complex. Dividing a model helps limit the amount of infor-
mation you are loading into a project at one time. It also reduces the likelihood of crowding 
the model with users, as more than ﬁve simultaneous connections to a single model can 
affect performance.
This is a particularly good idea if your project is going to be delivered in separate phases or 
bid packages. As the project progresses and you complete each delivery, you will start the 
next phase by creating a new project ﬁle and then linking in the previous project ﬁle as con-
text. Doing so will greatly simplify your document set (because you will be able to start over 
after each phase) and avoid inadvertently modifying the previous phase (since the geometry 
and documentation are in a linked ﬁle).
If you decide to divide your project, make your cuts along lines that make sense from a  
holistic-building standpoint. Do not think of the cuts as you would in CAD, but think about 
how the actual assemblies will interact in the building. For example, do not cut between 
ﬂoors 2 and 3 on a multistory building unless you have a signiﬁcant change in the building 
form or program. A good place to cut might be between the building and the adjacent park-
ing garage. Here is a list of some good places to split a model:
 
◆
At a signiﬁcant change in building form or massing
 
◆
At a signiﬁcant change in building program
 
◆
Between separate buildings on the site
 
◆
At the building site
Do not want to divide your model? Use Collaboration for Revit.  Collaboration for Revit is 
a service that synchronizes your model with other model users in your ofﬁce or other loca-
tions. It is a paid service that allows you similar functionality to something like Revit Server, 
but without the need to manage the installation process across your network. In lieu of your 
ﬁles being saved on your Revit Server installation, the central ﬁle resides on the Autodesk® 
A360 website. For more information about the service, visit www.autodesk.com/products/
collaboration-for-revit/overview.
Collaboration for Revit (C4R) is included in the default Revit installation starting with  
Revit 2018. The service is designed for teams working in different locations to work within 
the same model at the same time without having to manage a Revit Server installation.

QUALITY CONTROL | 969
To use C4R, open Revit and choose the Collaborate tab. On the Manage Collaboration panel, 
you can activate C4R by choosing the Collaborate button (Figure B.7).
Figure B.7 
Activating 
Collaboration  
for Revit
Revit will ask you to save your model and then ask whether you want to collaborate across 
your network or collaborate using the cloud (Figure B.8). Collaborating within the network 
will limit you to working only with people who have access to your LAN. If you are working 
with other ﬁrms on the same model, you would want to use the cloud option. When you save 
your model, it will either save to a central location on the LAN or save to the A360 site, allow-
ing you to coordinate with anyone else, anywhere.
Figure B.8 
Collaborating 
across the LAN or 
with the cloud
Quality Control
In any project process, you should always maintain a level of quality control to ensure a solid 
workﬂow. When working in a BIM environment, good model maintenance is an imperative part 
of the process. A well-maintained model will open quickly and be responsive when you are 
changing views or manipulating content. A model that is not well maintained can have a large 
ﬁle size, take a long time to open or save, or even become corrupted. Letting the quality of your 
model suffer can negatively impact the team’s overall production and lead to frustration because 
members cannot be as efﬁcient as they would like to be. The model size will grow, it will take a 
long time to save locally or with the command Synchronize With Central (SWC), and the ﬁle can 
suffer corruption or crashes.

970 | APPENDIX B TIPS, TRICKS, AND TROUBLESHOOTING
Maintaining a good, healthy model is not difﬁcult. It takes about as much effort as regularly 
changing the oil in your car. The important thing, as with your car, is actually doing the regular 
maintenance so you do not have to ﬁx a bigger problem that could have been avoided. In the fol-
lowing sections, we will cover some simple things you can do using the tools already built into 
Revit software.
Keeping an Eye on File Size
The size of your ﬁle is a good metric for general ﬁle stability. A typical Revit ﬁle size for a proj-
ect in construction will be between 100 MB and 500 MB. Note that 500 MB is really on the high 
side of ﬁle sizes; beyond that, the model will be slow to open and hard to rotate in 3D views. 
Other views, such as building elevations and overall plans, will also be slow to open.
Should your ﬁle become large or unwieldy, you have several ways to trim your ﬁle and get 
your model lean and responsive again. We have discussed some ways to make your computer 
faster to accommodate larger ﬁle sizes. Now, let’s discuss ways to optimize the ﬁle itself.
Purging Unused Families and Groups
On the Manage tab is a command called Purge Unused. This command removes all the unused 
families and groups from your model by deleting them. There are many times in a design pro-
cess when you will change window types or wall types or swap one set of families for another. 
Even if those elements are not being used in the project, they are being stored within the ﬁle, 
and therefore, when the ﬁle is opened, they are being loaded into memory. Depending on the 
stage of your project, you should periodically delete these elements from the model to keep 
your ﬁle size down. Reducing unused content also helps make the management of the content 
you retain more efﬁcient. Do not worry—if you ﬁnd you need a family you’ve removed, you can 
always reload it.
Select the Manage tab and choose Purge Unused from the Settings panel. Depending on the 
size of your model and how many families you have loaded, it might take the software a few 
minutes to complete this command.
After the software is done thinking, it will provide you with a list of all the families and 
groups in the ﬁle that are not actively within a view (Figure B.9). At this point, you have the 
option to select the elements you want to delete or keep and remove the rest. You can select 
either entire families or just unused types. Notice that some of the families cannot be selected 
for deletion because either they are nested in another family or other types of that family are 
already being used in your project.
In addition to families, unused materials and property sets can be removed using the Purge 
Unused command. Imported categories can be purged as well; however, you do not have the 
option to choose which ones to delete.
We do not recommend you use this command in the early stages of design because your ﬁle 
size will not be that large early on and purging would eliminate any preloaded families that you 
might have included in your template. During schematic design and design development, 
you are typically going through design iteration and will likely be adding and removing content 
regularly. It can become a hassle to have to constantly load or reload families into the model. If 
your model is not suffering from performance issues or the ﬁle size is not unruly, it is not neces-
sary to perform a Purge Unused operation.

QUALITY CONTROL | 971
You might also consider using the Save Families tool before purging all unused families. 
From the Application menu, click Save As Family and you can export all of the families in your 
project to a folder. After you purge unused families, you can always return to the folder in 
which you saved the families and reload them as necessary.
Cutting Down on the Number of Views
The ability to quickly create views within a model is one of the beneﬁts of using Revit; however, 
this ability can be a detriment if it is not managed. Beyond the simple hassle of sorting through 
many views to ﬁnd the one you need, too many views can also negatively affect your perfor-
mance and ﬁle size.
Obviously, a number of views are needed within the model to show design intent and create the 
construction documentation. Beyond those views, you will ﬁnd yourself creating views to study the 
design, deal with model creation, or simply view the building or project from a new angle. These types 
of working views will never make it to the sheet set, and some will be used for only brief periods.
Before you go through the effort of counting all your unused views, remember that a Revit 
model is a database. You can use this feature to let the software perform the counting for you, using 
schedules. To create a schedule that will track unused views, open the AppB-Foundation .rvt 
ﬁle found on the book’s web page at www.sybex.com/go/masteringrevit2018. Next, select the 
Schedules ﬂyout from the View tab and choose View List.

972 | APPENDIX B TIPS, TRICKS, AND TROUBLESHOOTING
How Many Working Views Are Too Many?
How many working views are too many to have in your model? Te obvious answer is that when 
performance begins to suﬀer, you need to start looking at ways to make the model leaner and speed 
up response times. We had a project team new to Revit software, and they were complaining about 
the ﬁle being slow to open and manipulate. When reviewing their model, we saw their ﬁle size was 
over 900 MB! We were surprised they were able to do any work at all.
One of the ﬁrst things we did to get the ﬁle size down to something more reasonable was look at 
all the views that were not on sheets. We found they had more than 1,200 views not being used. 
Deleting those views and running a File Save (with the Compress box checked) brought the ﬁle size 
down to 500 MB. Although the size was still high, this example demonstrates the impact that too 
many views can have on your ﬁle size.
The View List Properties dialog box allows you to select the ﬁelds you want to have in your 
schedule. For your View List schedule, select the following ﬁelds (in order):
 
◆
Sheet Number
 
◆
View Name
 
◆
Title On Sheet
Use the Add Parameter(s) button to move those ﬁelds from the left column to the right one 
and sort them in the order listed (Figure B.10).
If you were to click OK right now, you would create a schedule of all the views you have within 
the model. Since you want to see only the views that are not on sheets, you have a bit more for-
matting to do. By selecting the Filter tab, you can choose to see only the views not placed on sheets. In 
the sample model, there are two sheet types: those that begin with an A and ones that begin with a K.
1. On the Filter tab, choose to ﬁlter the sheets by sheet number.
2. From the drop-down menu, choose Does Not Begin With as a ﬁlter type.
3. Finally, in the text ﬁeld, enter a capital A (Figure B.11).

QUALITY CONTROL | 973
Remember that because these are database functions, they are also case sensitive. Before 
moving on to the next tab, choose to add another ﬁlter selection. Copy the one you just created 
to ﬁlter A sheets, but now ﬁlter out all the K sheets.

Filtering out views

974 | APPENDIX B TIPS, TRICKS, AND TROUBLESHOOTING
As a last bit of formatting, select the Sorting/Grouping tab. On this tab, from the drop-down 
menu select Sheet Number. Should you have missed a sheet number type (for instance, if you 
have G sheets in your list), it would appear at the top. Be sure to have the Grand Totals and 
Itemize Every Instance check boxes selected (Figure B.12). Click OK when you have ﬁnished.
Filtering Is AND, Not OR
Remember that ﬁltering is not an OR command (this OR that)—it is an AND command. So, if 
you have more than one ﬁlter, what you see in the schedule needs to meet both requirements, 
not just one.
Figure B.12 
Sorting the schedule 
by sheet name
The result of this exercise will be a schedule that looks similar to Figure B.13; it shows a 
list and the total of all the views not on sheets in your model. You can see that in this example 
model we have 18 views not currently on sheets. No matter how many views you have in this 
schedule, you will want to be selective about what you eliminate and what you choose to keep. 
Just because a view is not on a sheet does not mean it is not valuable to your project. Ideally, 
someone familiar with the project will assess the value of the views in this schedule to deter-
mine what to keep and what to remove.
It is also a good idea to add this schedule to your ofﬁce template where it will keep a running 
list of views not on sheets that you can refer to at any time in the project process.

QUALITY CONTROL | 975
Using Schedules
As you saw in the previous example, using schedules is a great way to use tools already in the 
software to perform quality control on your projects. Do not think that all schedules need to 
be placed on sheets. There are several uses for schedules as a quality assurance measure. In the 
previous example using views, you used schedules to help troubleshoot poor model perfor-
mance; however, you can use schedules to help you control quality for all kinds of things. The 
following sections highlight two more examples.
Using Multi-category Schedules
An excellent way to monitor the contents of your building model is through the use of multi-
category schedules. For the purpose of quality control, you might not be too concerned with 
extensive quantity takeoffs. Thus, you will need to create a schedule with a limited number of 
ﬁelds, organized in a way that does not list each and every object instance in the project. We will 
show you how to do this in the following exercise:
1. Continuing with the AppB-Foundation.rvt ﬁle, go to the View tab in the ribbon, click 
the Schedules ﬂyout, and select Schedule/Quantities.
2. Choose <Multi-Category> at the top of the Category list and change the name to  
Multi-Category QA Schedule.
3. In the Fields tab of the Schedule Properties dialog box, add the following ﬁelds (in order) 
to the Scheduled Fields list:
 
◆
Category
 
◆
Assembly Code
 
◆
Assembly Description
 
◆
Family And Type
 
◆
Count
Figure B.13

976 | APPENDIX B TIPS, TRICKS, AND TROUBLESHOOTING
4. Switch to the Sorting/Grouping tab, set the ﬁrst sorting parameter to Category, and select 
the Header option. For the second sorting parameter, choose Assembly Code, and set the 
third sorting parameter to Family And Type. Finally, uncheck the Itemize Every Instance 
option at the bottom of the dialog box (Figure B.14).
5. Switch to the Formatting tab and select the Category ﬁeld. Check the box to make it a hid-
den ﬁeld and then click OK to view the results (Figure B.15).
Figure B.14 
Specify the sorting 
and grouping options 
for the multi-category 
schedule.
Figure B.15 
Te multi-category 
schedule shows all 
elements in the 
project.
With this type of schedule, you can manage the entire scope of contents actively placed in 
your model. Objects that do not have the proper assembly codes can be corrected in this sched-
ule. For other issues such as family- or type-naming conventions, you will need to make those 
adjustments in the Project Browser. In addition to verifying that the correct content has been 
used throughout your project, you can check the Count ﬁeld for rows where a small number of 
elements have been placed—perhaps indicating that a family has been placed in error.

QUALITY CONTROL | 977
Discover a Bundle of Schedules
Did you know that there are some valuable elements hidden in project templates provided by 
Autodesk? If you create a new project ﬁle using the Construction-Default template, you will ﬁnd 
many schedules related to quality assurance (QA) or quantity surveying (QS). Tere is also a sheet 
named 000 - Temporary Schedule Sheet, from which you can copy any number of schedules and 
then paste them into your own project.
NOTE 
Another way to save your schedules is to simply right-click them in the Project Browser 
and choose Save To New File. Tis will export the schedule to an RVT ﬁle and is a good way to 
save any view type.
Using Keynotes
As a ﬁnal example illustrating the use of schedules to manage the consistency of a project, we 
will discuss how to use keynotes in the construction document process. Regardless of whether 
you use numerical keys or text-based keys, you will invariably need to use one of them to add 
annotations to your project. Although the software can easily produce both types of annotation, 
for the sake of ease and consistency we will refer to them as keynotes for the remainder of this 
section because that is the name of the Revit command.
If you are keynoting a project, you are adding annotations that call out speciﬁc materials 
or conditions within your details. Those notes not only need to be consistent across multiple 
details but will also link directly back to the project speciﬁcations—a separate set of documents 
published outside of the Revit environment. Historically on a project, to maintain any sort of 
consistency between notes in different views, you needed to manually coordinate all the notes 
and manually check them. When you are talking about hundreds of sheets in a drawing set 
and thousands of notes, there is plenty of room for error. In a manual process, you can have 
notes on one sheet that read “Cast-in-Place Concrete,” whereas on another sheet they read “CIP 
Concrete,” and on a third sheet “Cst in Place Conncrete” (note the typos).
The Keynote tool has some built-in checks and balances to ensure a level of consistency when it 
is being used, and we explore the tool further in Chapter 18, “Documenting Your Design.” However, 
it should be pointed out that a keynote legend is another good way for the project manager to main-
tain a level of oversight throughout the project. A keynote legend will give you a running list of 
what notes are being used in a project, even though it is intended to be placed on sheets to comple-
ment your documentation. This overall list can also be cross-checked against the speciﬁcations so 
you can ensure that everything you have added to the model has a corresponding section.
To create a keynote legend, follow these steps:
1. On the View ribbon, select the Legends drop-down, and choose Keynote Legend.
2. The ﬁelds for a keynote legend are limited to Key Value and Keynote Text.
3. Switch to the Filter tab, and you will notice an option unique to this type of legend. Check 
the box labeled Filter By Sheet if you want the legend to display only the keynotes shown 
within the same sheet on which the legend is placed. Remember, you can place a legend 
on as many sheets as necessary.
4. In the Sorting/Grouping tab, you have one additional option to help you review the key-
notes used in your project. If you select the Footer option and choose the Title, Count, 

978 | APPENDIX B TIPS, TRICKS, AND TROUBLESHOOTING
And Totals option (Figure B.16), you can view how many times each keynote is used 
throughout your project. Remember that this option will also affect the instances of the 
keynote legend already placed on sheets. Use this option sparingly and disable it after 
your quality control tasks.

option to show 
a count of each

The ﬁnished schedule will look like Figure B.17. If you look at the elements displayed in the 
schedule, you will notice that it is organized by Construction Speciﬁcation Institute (CSI) divi-
sion, and every note will be listed so you can verify the spelling and accuracy of each item.
Reviewing Warnings
A seemingly obvious place to troubleshoot your model is the Review Warnings tool. Although this 
technique will do little to affect your overall ﬁle size, the Warnings dialog box will alert you to prob-
lems within the model that should regularly be addressed to ensure ﬁle stability. To locate this dialog 
box, go to the Manage tab in the ribbon, ﬁnd the Inquiry panel, and click the Warnings button.
Selecting this tool will give you the dialog box shown in Figure B.18, which lists all the warn-
ings still active in your project ﬁle.
Warnings are notiﬁcations of all types of issues the software has resolving geometry, conﬂicts, 
or formulas that do not equate. Examples of things that will appear in this dialog box are instances 
where you have multiple elements sitting directly on top of each other, thereby creating inaccurate 
schedule counts; wall joins that do not properly clean themselves up; wall and room separation lines 
overlapping; stairs that have the wrong number of risers between ﬂoors; and so on. This dialog box 
shows you all the times the yellow warning box appeared at the bottom-right corner of the screen and 
you did not take action to solve the problem. Warnings that go unchecked not only can compound to 
create other errors but also can lead to inaccurate reporting in schedules or even ﬁle corruption. You 
will want to check the Warnings dialog box regularly as part of your periodic ﬁle maintenance and 
try to keep the number of warnings to a minimum. You might also notice that the dialog box has an 
Export feature. This feature exports your warning list to an HTML ﬁle, allowing you to read it at your 
leisure outside the model environment (Figure B.19). Pulling this list into a Microsoft Word or Excel 
document allows you to distribute the warnings across the team for them to be resolved.

Figure B.19 
Exporting the 
warnings

980 | APPENDIX B TIPS, TRICKS, AND TROUBLESHOOTING
In the example shown in Figure B.19, we have 47 warnings in the ﬁle. How many warnings in 
a ﬁle are too many? That depends on your model, computer capabilities, what the warning types 
are, and your deliverable. For instance, if you are delivering a model to your client or to the con-
tractor, you might have a zero-warning requirement. In that case, all warnings must be resolved 
prior to delivering the model. If you are still actively in the design phase of the project, however, 
you will always have some warnings—it is an inescapable part of the process of iteration. As you 
reﬁne the drawings, problems will be resolved, and as you add new content to the model that 
is in need of resolution, new ones will be created. If you are not worried about a model deliver-
able, you can get away with having fewer than 1,000 warnings in the project without too much 
trouble. The number of types of warnings can also be a concern. Having 100 warnings with  
25 different types of warnings may be more of a concern than 1,000 warnings with just a few 
types. More types signal that the health of the ﬁle may be suspect. That said, the cleaner the 
model, the smoother it will run.
Another option for ﬁnding and resolving warnings is available in the contextual tab of the 
ribbon. When you select one or more objects that have warnings associated with them, you will 
see the Show Related Warnings button at the end of the ribbon. Click this tool to display the 
warning dialog box, and only the warnings related to the selected elements will be displayed. 
This is a good way to resolve model issues as you and your team develop a project. Being proac-
tive about model quality will save you time in the long run. As Benjamin Franklin once said, 
“An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.”
Other Tips and Shortcuts
Beyond all the things you can do to hone your skills, you will begin to learn a number of tips 
and shortcuts as your experience grows using Revit. Here is a compilation of some of those tips 
and tricks:
Let the software do the math.  Revit is like a big calculator, and it is very good at doing math 
correctly. Do not want to spend the time trying to ﬁgure out what your room size is after you 
subtract a 3 5/8″ stud and 5/8″ piece of gypsum board from an 11′-2″ room? Do not. If you 
need to modify a dimension, simply add an equal sign and a formula (Figure B.20), and Revit 
will calculate the value for you. You can do a lot of math within the Properties palette. Revit will 
support everything from simple calculations to the more complex Boolean equations.
Figure B.20 
Use an equal 
sign to perform 
calculations.
Make elevators visible in your plans.  You want to create a shaft that will penetrate all the 
ﬂoors of your building and put an elevator in it that will show in all your plans. You could 
do that with an elevator family and cut a series of holes in the ﬂoors by editing ﬂoor proﬁles, 
but sometimes those holes lose their alignment. Fortunately, you can do both things at once 
using the Shaft tool found on the Opening panel of the Architecture tab. Here, not only can 
you cut a vertical hole through multiple ﬂoors as a single object, but you can also insert 2D 

OTHER TIPS AND SHORTCUTS | 981
Orient to view.  Creating perspective views of isolated design elements can be quick and 
easy in a plan or section, but let’s say you want to see that same element in 3D to be able to 
work out the details. Here is how:
1. Create a plan region or section cut isolating the area in question. If you are using a  
section, be sure to set your view depth to something practical.
2. Open the Default 3D view or any axon of the project.
3. Right-click the ViewCube®, select Orient To View, and select your view from the  
context menu.
Now, your 3D view will look identical to your section or plan region, but by rotating the 
view, you will be able to see that portion in 3D.
Tune your shortcuts.  You can edit your keyboard shortcuts without the hassle of rooting 
through your hard drive looking for a TXT ﬁle. To edit your shortcuts, click the Application 
menu and select Options. Choose the User Interface tab and then click the Customize but-
ton. The Keyboard Shortcuts dialog box (Figure B.22) will allow you to edit those shortcuts. 
Consider making common shortcuts the same letter. So instead of pressing VG to get to your 
Visibility/Graphic Overrides dialog box, make the shortcut VV for quicker access.
Drag and drop families.  You need to load a family into a project, you have the Explorer 
window open, and you know where the family is, but you do not want to go through the 
laborious effort of navigating across your ofﬁce’s server environment to get there. No prob-
lem. You can drag and drop families from Explorer directly into the project ﬁle.
Double-click families to edit.  You no longer need to highlight a family and then mouse 
all the way to the ribbon to choose Edit Family. If you want to edit the family, simply double-
click it and the family will launch in the Family Editor. You can customize other double-click 
settings in the Options dialog box, accessed on the Application menu.
Double-click the mouse wheel to activate the Zoom To Fit command for even faster view 
navigation!

982 | APPENDIX B TIPS, TRICKS, AND TROUBLESHOOTING
Copy a 3D view.  You made the perfect 3D view in your last project, and you can’t ﬁgure  
out how to get it into your current project. Fortunately, there’s a way to copy views from one 
project to another. Open both ﬁles in the same running instance of the software and then 
follow these steps:
1. In your perfect view, right-click the 3D view in the Project Browser and choose Show 
Camera from the context menu.
2. Press Ctrl+C to copy the selected camera.
3. In your new model, use Ctrl+V to paste the camera, and your view and all its settings 
are now there.
Use a quick-cut poché.  Want to change everything that is cut in a view without having to 
select every family and change its properties? A quick-cut poché is, well, quick.
1. Open the view you want to modify.
2. Using a crossing window, select all the elements within the view.
3. Right-click and choose Override Graphics In View ➢ By Element from the context 
menu. As shown in Figure B.23, you can choose any ﬁlled region in the project and 
assign it to anything that is cut within your model.
Move your ribbon.  Did you know that you can reorganize the tabs on the ribbon and place 
them in any order you would like? Hold down the Ctrl key and select a tab (like Insert). You 
can drag it left or right to change the order in which they appear.

Additional Resources
A number of resources are available to help you along the way to improve your Revit skills, 
solve problems, or create new content. In our digital age, there is a wealth of information online 
to help you learn or communicate with users far and wide. So, before you spend hours trying to 
solve a particularly challenging problem on your own, you might check some of these tools:
Help  Clicking the question mark icon in the upper-right corner of the application will take 
you to the Autodesk Help site at http://help.autodesk.com/view/RVT/2018/ENU. This site 
will give you a basic synopsis of all the tools, buttons, and commands available in the appli-
cation. If you do not want to use the online help resource, you can switch to the traditional 
local help ﬁle by searching your computer for the version of the Revit.ini ﬁle speciﬁc to 
your version of Revit software. For the individual user, the Revit.ini ﬁle is located here:
C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Autodesk\Revit\Autodesk Revit 2018
Edit the ﬁle in a text-editing application. Find the section heading named Documentation, 
and edit the values as follows:
[Documentation]
UseHelpServer=0
HelpFileLocation='C:\Program Files\Autodesk\Revit 2018\Program\Help\
en-US\WBH\index.html'
HelpBrowser=0
The value for HelpFileLocation in the previous example may vary, depending on the local-
ized version of the software or modiﬁcations to the default installation path. You can also 
change the HelpFileLocation variable to any location on your company’s server.
UseHelpServer can be set to 0 for ofﬂine help or to 1 for online help. HelpBrowser is an 
integer that controls the Internet browser used when calling the help content. Set this vari-
able to 0 to use the default browser or to 1 to always use Internet Explorer. The variable 
OnlineHelpLocale can be used to direct links to online help into a speciﬁc language. Use a 
locale designation such as enu for English-United States or fra for French.
