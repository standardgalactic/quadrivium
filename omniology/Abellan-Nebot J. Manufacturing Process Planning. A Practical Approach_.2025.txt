Foreword
This book is intended to be a reference textbook for teaching manufacturing process planning at undergraduate and
graduate courses in the fields of design, manufacturing, and mechanical engineering. Process planning refers to all
the activities that should be carried out in a manufacturing company to produce a product given the 3D model or
technical drawing from the design office. The book sequentially illustrates all the necessary steps and provides
practical examples at each stage of the process.
The book is organized as follows: the first chapters cover the fundamentals of process planning, the information
that comes from the technical drawings, and the documents that process planners should create to communicate the
required operations at the shop‐floor level. Then, specific process planning tasks are explained and illustrated with
practical examples. Some of these tasks are Selection of Manufacturing Processes, Process Planning in Sand
Casting, Process Planning in Machining and Process Planning in Inspection. These four topics are detailed in
different chapters and cover important activities performed in manufacturing companies. Fundamentals of casting,
mold design, machining sequence identification, tool and parameter selection, geometric validation, CNC
programming, and inspection reports are some of the key aspects that are reviewed throughout the book. Finally,
manufacturing cost estimation and pricing are presented as the final activities performed by process planners to
ensure a feasible and cost‐effective production.
The book also includes, as supplementary files, five practical computer sessions relating to manufacturing process
selection, casting simulation, pattern design, and CNC simulation. In addition, a project proposal is included for
instructors that may be interested in teaching the course using a project‐based approach. The project allows
students to practice almost all of the concepts covered with in the book, using minimal workshop equipment found
in most university facilities.
The authors of the book are recognized lecturers from the Universitat Jaume I (Spain), Universitat Politècnica de
València (Spain), and the University of North Texas (United States), with more than 20 years of experience in
teaching and research in the field of manufacturing.
The Spanish Society of Manufacturing Engineering (MES‐SIF, Sociedad Ingeniería de Fabricación) acknowledges
the fine work presented and recommends the book as a reference textbook for courses related to manufacturing
process planning, especially for those who wish to study in detail sand casting and machining process planning.
The activities presented in the proposed manufacturing process planning project and the computer sessions provide
a good practical view of process planning and orient the instruction to a more active learning approach where
learning by doing is a keystone.

Preface
We started to work on Manufacturing Process Planning in the 1990s in the field of concurrent and collaborative
engineering. The thesis from Carlos Vila Pastor and Héctor R. Siller (Implementation Strategies of New
Technologies in the Field of Concurrent Engineering 2001 and Collaborative Process Planning Model Applied to
High Performance Machining of Hardened Steels Parts 2009) investigated process planning at different levels,
paying special attention to machining process planning. In 2004, Abellan‐Nebot joined the research team to work
on aspects more related to intelligent machining systems and computer‐aided manufacturing. Our research team
has been always working on design and manufacturing practices, teaching topics such as integrated manufacturing,
design for manufacturing, geometric product specifications, computer‐aided manufacturing, manufacturing process
planning and manufacturing process and materials selection at the Universitat Jaume I (Castellón, Spain),
Universitat Politècnica de València (Valencia, Spain), Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey
(Monterrey, Mexico), and The University of North Texas (Texas, United States).
This book is mainly based on the material and notes prepared since the end of the 1990s for the course
Manufacturing Process Planning, a graduate course for industrial engineering at the Universitat Jaume I and the
Universitat Politècnica de València, which was later updated for a fourth‐year course in mechanical engineering.
Part of the material was first prepared by Professor Fernando Romero‐Subirón, Pedro Rosado‐Castellano, PhD, and
Gracia M. Bruscas‐Bellido, PhD, who also contributed to reviewing and providing useful feedback to improve the
current manuscript. All this previous material was completed during the last eight years of teaching Manufacturing
Process Planning by José V. Abellán‐Nebot, PhD. During that period, active learning activities were prepared to
motivate and engage the students in activities related to manufacturing process planning. A manufacturing process
planning project was successfully applied and new material was prepared to cover CNC activities, inspection
planning, computer sessions, and project activities. The positive performance and feedback from students were the
spark that motivated us to prepare and share this book. With this book, the authors want to share the material on
manufacturing process planning together with computer sessions and project activities with other engineers,
students, and instructors around the world.
The result of the book is a self‐contained manual that presents all the steps required in manufacturing process
planning, starting with the identification of key aspects from a technical drawing, moving through manufacturing
process selection, detailed process planning for casting, machining, and inspection, and finally, costing and pricing
the product.
For the instructors, the book is organized to let them apply a project‐based learning approach. Given a technical
drawing and minimum laboratory equipment, the manufacturing process plan can be done by applying the contents
learned in each chapter. For this purpose, the book provides as supplementary documentation with five computer
sessions and one project description to let the instructors apply active learning practices in class.
The book is primarily intended to be useful to designers, mechanical and production engineers, and engineering
students in general interested in learning the basics of process planning from a practical point of view.
The authors and publisher do not assume any responsibility with respect to the use of the information contained in
this book.

Introduction to Process Planning
1.1 Introduction
Manufacturing process planning involves figuring out the best way to make a product or component, from
choosing the right materials and methods to determining the most efficient sequence of steps. The main goal of
manufacturing process planning is to optimize the production process, making it cost‐effective while ensuring
high‐quality results. In small manufacturing companies, process planning is still conducted by manual methods
that rely on experienced process planners who apply their knowledge in design and manufacturing to produce
efficient and cost‐effective process plans. More advanced manufacturing companies may utilize computer‐aided
process‐planning (CAPP) systems to help in process‐planning activities, saving money, and making more efficient
process plans.
In this chapter, an overview of the manufacturing process‐planning activities is presented, and the importance of
these activities and the communication between design and manufacturing departments is highlighted to ensure
competitive products in shorter lead times. The chapter briefly describes CAPP methods, whereas the manual
methods are just schematically presented since this method is covered in detail throughout this book.
1.2 Process Planning Within Product Development Cycle
Process planning is the deliberate selection of the techniques needed to make a product affordable and competitive.
Procedures, machine tools, and other equipment must be devised, chosen, and determined to transform raw
materials into finished and assembled goods.
Process planning may be also considered as a bridge between product design and manufacturing, as illustrated in
Figure 1.1. The initial steps of process planning coincide with the product design phase, involving decisions such
as material selection and manufacturing methods such as casting, forging, or die casting. The formal endpoint for
product design is marked by the release of all product data, usually in the form of three‐dimensional (3D) models
and engineering drawings, which specify the precise product details. At this juncture, process planning takes
charge, outlining the comprehensive manufacturing plan for each component of the product.

Figure 1.1 Traditional process planning deployment where machining operations are involved.
Process planning derives its input from 3D models or engineering drawings that detail what needs to be produced
and in what quantity. These drawings are carefully scrutinized to determine the project's overall scope. For
complex assembled products, considerable effort may be invested in breaking down the product into its constituent
parts and subassemblies. Initial decisions regarding subassembly groupings, such as whether to manufacture
certain parts or purchase them, as well as determining the general tooling requirements, may also be made.
Subsequently, a detailed routing plan is developed for each part, requiring technical expertise in processes,
machinery, and production economics. In essence, process planning translates the engineering drawing of a
component into a group of manufacturing process steps, leading to the creation of a route sheet, which outlines the
sequence of operations necessary for the component. The term “route sheet” is used because it also specifies the
machines through which the part must pass to complete the sequence of operations (Kesavan 2009).
In the context of product design and manufacturing on a global scale, three key functions are involved: marketing
and sales, design, and manufacturing. These functions traditionally follow a sequential process. Marketing assesses
the contemporary market trends and requirements, creating new product concepts based on its findings. It also
formulates specifications for the further enhancement of existing products, guided by market assessments. The
design function utilizes these product concepts and specifications from marketing, providing a comprehensive
overview of all parts and subassemblies required for the final product. This includes detailed 3D models, drawings,

assembly plans, and bills of materials. The product requirements determined during the design phase are then
assigned to the process‐planning team. This information serves as the basis for creating detailed work instructions
needed for production, defining, in case the part should be manufactured in‐house, the manufacturing processes,
the machine/equipment needed, tooling requirements, etc. These instructions are transferred to the manufacturing
facility for production, as depicted in Figure 1.1.
Consequently, even though the design and manufacturing departments operate independently, the process‐planning
activity serves as a connection between them, following a sequential approach. This sequential approach,
traditionally utilized in product design and manufacturing, assumes a lengthy lifespan for the product with a
consistent demand over an extended period. However, in current competitive global markets, this assumption often
does not hold true. As a result, manufacturing organizations have explored ways to reduce the time required for
product design and manufacturing, commonly known as time to market. Some organizations have prioritized
organizational changes with the intention of forcing all the stakeholders to be involved in the whole product
development cycle and fostering cross‐functional collaboration to expedite the design and manufacturing processes
of their products. This method, based on the collaboration of cross‐functional teams, is commonly known as
concurrent engineering. However, it can be found with other terms such as simultaneous engineering or integrated
product development.
Unlike a sequential approach, commonly referred to as “over‐the‐wall engineering” since no bidirectional
communication exists to ensure product performance and manufacturability, concurrent engineering can be seen as
a cooperative approach where members from all stages are in continuous communication to improve product
design and facilitate the subsequent stages of production (Figure 1.2). Some activities that may be found under a
concurrent engineering approach are listed in the following:
 
Collaborate in the definition of product design specifications.
Choose the best design and manufacturing techniques to employ.
Propose modifications of geometrical specifications or relaxation of tolerances.
Evaluate the design's manufacturability and modify it accordingly.
Evaluate the assembly of the design to detect potential assembly issues and improvements.

Figure 1.2 Sequential engineering versus concurrent engineering.
Besides reducing time to market, the main benefits of applying concurrent engineering are reducing cost and
increasing product quality and productivity. However, managing concurrent engineering is challenging, and it
requires the commitment of all stakeholders, and very often some of them are reticent to multidisciplinary
collaboration.
Regarding product and production costs, it is important to note that approximately 70% of the total cost of a
product is determined during the design phase (Ullman 1992). However, some studies reduce this impact to 47%
on average (Ulrich and Pearson 1993). This cost allocation is primarily influenced by material selection and the
associated manufacturing methods. The remaining 30% is attributed to decisions made regarding the
manufacturing process, such as the utilization of production equipment and tooling. Additionally, it is widely
recognized that any modifications made to the product during later stages have a greater impact on production
costs compared to earlier stages, and the time required to implement such changes is longer. Figure 1.3 shows the
impact of product design on product cost and production cost in common manufacturing companies.
Due to these reasons, concurrent engineering should be considered a widespread practice within manufacturing
companies to minimize lead times and decrease the overall costs associated with the final product.

1.3 Process‐Planning Levels of Detail and Activities
As stated earlier, process planning seeks to completely define the manufacturing processes, tools, process
parameters, inspection methods, etc., required to manufacture a product according to the 3D models and technical
drawings from the design office. Process planning can be conducted at different levels of detail defining four
different types of process planning (ElMaraghy and Nassehi 2014): generic planning, macroplanning, detailed
planning, and microplanning.
Figure 1.3 Impact of product design on product cost and production cost in common manufacturing companies.
Source: Adapted from Munro and Associates (1989).
Generic planning refers to rough process planning where only manufacturing process selection is conducted
according to material, production volume, process capabilities, and cost. Macroplanning details the equipment
selection related to manufacturing, assembly, and inspection, and defines the routing sheets, a document that shows
the route of each part with the stations and equipment involved at each step. Detailed planning refers to specific
information at each station about the sequence of operations, tooling, fixtures, etc. Finally, microplanning
describes process and operation parameters, NC programs, inspection procedures (conformity zones, sampling
strategy, etc.), working instructions, calculation of overall times and costs, etc., which ends with the documentation
of operation sheets. Although a first analysis for a new product development starts with generic planning, a final
microplanning will be required before production.

Many different process‐planning activities are required depending on the level of detail needed. For a complete
process planning before production, the following activities are commonly conducted:
1.3.1 Interpretation of Product Design Data and Manufacturability
The initial stage in developing a process plan for any component involves referring to the product design data,
mainly in the form of 3D models and engineering drawings. Interpreting the product data involves analyzing the
part's geometry, dimensions, and correlated dimensional and geometric tolerances, as well as surface finish
conditions and material specifications. Production information about lead time and production volume is also
gathered.
A key analysis to be conducted at this step is a manufacturability analysis. Process planners should evaluate and
propose design modifications that may reduce manufacturing costs and time. Practices related to design for
manufacturing (DFM) and design for assembly (DFA) are applied for this purpose, and modification or relaxation
of geometrical specifications and tolerances are also studied and shared with the design team.
1.3.2 Bill of Materials Analysis and Make‐or‐Buy Decision
Given the final 3D models and technical drawings, all components of the product are analyzed to decide which
parts are going to be purchased from the market and which ones are going to be manufactured in‐house. Typically,
if the part can be produced in‐house, a cost comparison between making versus buying is done. Assumptions are
often required regarding factors such as expected capacity, demand patterns, waste, inventory levels, and
fluctuations in material availability and affordability. After the make‐or‐purchase decisions are made, the bill of
materials for the product is defined, including the make‐or‐buy nature.
1.3.3 Manufacturing Process Evaluation and Selection
After analyzing the technical drawings and deciding which parts are being manufactured in‐house, process
planners can start to evaluate which manufacturing processes are more appropriate for producing the parts.
At this stage, the part material highly determines the manufacturing process selection. Thus, the process planner
may engage in meaningful discussions with design engineers to reconsider the material selection. For example,
some alloys are well‐suitable for casting or machining processes but are less adequate for forming processes. Note
that these discussions are typically conducted at the design stage when cross‐functional teams work together.
Manufacturing process selection requires identifying both primary processes (e.g., casting, forging, rolling,
extrusion, drawing, and bending) and secondary processes (e.g., machining, surface finishing, and
joining/assembly processes) that are required for reaching part specifications under the constraints of production
volume and production rate identified. For example, every manufacturing process and equipment possesses
inherent capabilities when it comes to achieving a certain surface quality. Therefore, any process or machinery that
cannot meet the specified surface quality requirements would either be eliminated beforehand in the selection
process, or additional finishing operations would need to be incorporated.
Therefore, after analyzing the technical drawings, materials, and production requirements, a list of potential
processes can be compiled. Those candidates that can be applied to fulfill part and production requirements are
then compared in terms of cost to ultimately identify the best manufacturing processes. At this step, early cost
estimation tools are applied to assist in the final manufacturing process selection. After the selection of appropriate
manufacturing processes, the raw material size for producing the part, including its size and any specific
requirements such as heat treatment, are also defined.
1.3.4 Selection of Machines and Equipment
The next stage, once the process planner has decided which manufacturing methods to use, is to choose the right
equipment, taking availability, process capability, production range, and cost into account. Factors such as the size
and weight of the components being produced, the physical dimensions of the machinery, tooling availability,
setup and production costs, and any limitations in terms of power and force are relevant aspects of the final
equipment selection.
1.3.5 Machining Sequence and Tolerance Charting

After selecting manufacturing processes, machines, and equipment, the process sequence is defined. When
secondary machining operations are needed, the machining sequence should be analyzed in detail to avoid
excessive manufacturing tolerance accumulation that may produce parts out of specifications. Machining sequence
diagrams and tolerance charts facilitate the definition of proper machining sequences to ensure part specifications.
1.3.6 Selection of Operation and Process Parameters
After selecting the machines and the sequence of operations to be conducted, it becomes necessary to define
specific parameters for each operation on each machine. When dealing with casting or plastic deformation
machinery, temperatures, cycle time, speeds, etc., are critical parameters. In the case of machining equipment,
cutting tools should be selected depending on the geometry to be machined, the material of the workpiece, and the
quality and capability requirements. Additionally, cutting parameters should be defined together with cutting
strategies and cutting tool paths. Machining handbooks and cutting data recommendations from tool manufacturers
are used for this purpose. It is possible to calculate the amount of nonvalue‐added time (such as handling and
setup) and operation time needed for each operation based on the process parameters. This facilitates the
compilation of the total time needed for the job for a later cost estimation.
1.3.7 Tooling Design
Tools, dies/molds, and workholding systems are also defined for each processing step, and if specific fixtures are
needed, a fixture design activity is conducted. For instance, in casting, patterns and molds must be designed. In the
case of machining operations, the process planner analyzes the workpiece and the final part to determine the
appropriate workholding devices. If a fixture or jig is required for a specific operation and the location and
clamping conditions have been identified, this information is typically passed on to a specialized fixturing
developer. Based on these requirements, the fixturing specialist generates detailed drawings and a general
arrangement drawing of the workholding device to be designed and fabricated. In many cases, this may involve
modifying an existing design or utilizing standardized components (Scallan 2003).
1.3.8 Time and Cost Estimation
Estimating cycle times and related expenses for the process plan is another responsibility of the process planners.
This involves forecasting manufacturing costs and lead times associated with creating a component or product
based on historical data or standard data from handbooks. Unlike early cost estimates at the manufacturing process
selection step, a more detailed estimation is conducted now since data about the specific equipment used, the
process and operation parameters, and inspection procedures have already been defined. At this step, an accurate
manufacturing cost estimation is crucial for determining the unit cost and assessing the product's success. This
estimation may result in changes in batch size considerations or whether to produce or purchase a particular
product or component that was not clearly identified at the first steps of process planning.
1.3.9 Documentation and Communication
Documents are created and shared with the design and manufacturing departments as a part of the different
preceding activities conducted. Basically, process‐planning documentation presents the methods, sequence of
tasks, parameters, time, and workforce required for manufacturing a product and they should clearly identify the
version of the document, date, and the person in charge.
At the generic and macroplanning level, assembly charts, operation charts, and routing sheets are defined. The
assembly and operation process charts graphically show the sequence of operations (assembly, manufacturing, or
inspection operations) that are necessary to produce a product and it shows the equipment and time required at
each operation. In a similar vein, routing sheets provide a tabular overview of the raw materials' journey through
the manufacturing process. A list of the production tools and equipment that will be used is usually included.
Routing sheets are typically used to accompany materials as they move around the production shop floor, giving
operators pertinent information at every turn.
At detailed and microplanning levels, operation lists, tooling lists, work instruction sheets, and inspection sheets
are defined. The operation list shows a detailed plan for every operation defined in the routing sheet, including
information about operation and process parameters such as feeds and speeds in case of machine tools, setup
procedures, and operation times. The tooling list serves the purpose of providing a comprehensive specification for
all necessary tooling across various operations. For specific activities, work instruction sheets may be provided to

offer supplementary information that is not covered in the operation or process sheets, providing additional details
for the tasks at hand. Finally, inspection sheets and quality reports present comprehensive instructions and
procedures for examining and measuring crucial quality attributes. If there is a need to collect and record specific
quality data for statistical process control (SPC) analysis, an inspection or quality report is required.
1.3.10 Selection of Quality Assurance Methods
Process planners should determine the quality assurance methods at the product and process validation stage and at
the production stage in collaboration with quality engineers. Inspection stages or in‐process inspection
measurements, sampling plans, the instruments required, and the conformity zones are defined for all critical
product specifications. It is crucial to achieve a compromise between guaranteeing product quality and avoiding
excessive inspection tasks, which would extend the processing time and increase the total manufacturing cost
(Scallan 2003).
1.4 Technical Data Required for Process Planning
Process planning requires dealing with reliable information about product design, manufacturing capabilities,
equipment capacities, manufacturing process parameters, etc. In general, the following sources of information
should be available during process planning (Adithan 2007):
 
Process plans of selected universal parts or other process plans from previous products that could serve as a
good starting point.
Product data and engineering drawings pertaining to each product component. For example, component
drawings, product specifications, requirements, and a bill of materials outlining the quantity of each
component used in the product.
Design data handbooks (charts of limits, fits and tolerances, material properties, etc.).
Manufacturing process capabilities and material–process compatibility matrices for process selection.
Machinery data handbooks (tables of process parameters for different manufacturing conditions and different
work materials).
Cutting data from vendors of machining tools and inserts.
Specifications of machines available on the shop floor (e.g., for machine tools: travel, spindle and motor
power ratings, working dimensions, etc.).
Machine hourly rate for all equipment available in the shop.
Tables of standard costs related to manufacturing processes, materials, operators, etc.
Tables of defining inspection sampling plans.
1.5 Process‐Planning Methods
Process planning can be classified into two primary methods: manual process planning and computer assisted
planning (CAPP). Expert engineers carry out manual process planning, taking their time to study and develop a
workable plan based on the shop floor's existing tools and equipment. CAPP approaches can be grouped into
variant CAPP or generative CAPP, and both seek to reduce or avoid relying on expert process planners, saving
time and cost along process‐planning activities. While manual process planning is most suitable for small shops
that cannot afford the cost and implementation of CAPP systems, large companies with a wide variety of product
geometries to be manufactured in‐house can take advantage of using these computer‐aided tools.
1.5.1 Manual Planning Methods
In manual process planning, all the activities shown in Figure 1.1 are conducted by experienced process planners.
The most relevant tasks are listed in the following:
 
1. The process planner chooses the best manufacturing processes for producing the component by looking at the
technical drawing, applying their manufacturing experience, and being aware of the available resources. They

also choose the size and shape of the material to be utilized, frequently based on designs that have already
been created for related elements.
2. The process planner determines the manufacturing parameters for each operation conducted at each
manufacturing process. For machine tools operations, it is determined the tools, feeds, and speeds for a
particular workpiece material. To ascertain the scheduled times for each handling and machining step
involved, they also refer to manuals and standard data. The setup time and time per unit quantity for each
activity are then determined using these time estimates.
3. All the relevant information from step 1 is documented in the routing sheet. This sheet provides a
comprehensive list of all the operations. For each operation, an operations list is defined by specifying all the
details mentioned in step 2.
The manual process‐planning method is usually based on preset workflows for workpiece types that are often
manufactured on the shop floor. After analyzing the drawing and identifying the required production processes, the
process planner can choose and appropriately modify the corresponding preset sequence of activities.
1.5.2 Computer‐Aided Process Planning
Process planning is still mostly a knowledge‐intensive manual operation carried out by skilled engineers, but there
have been numerous attempts to use computer tools to automate process‐planning tasks. The primary application of
CAPP systems is found in machining processes, where the most crucial tasks that significantly influence
production cost, total time, and manufacturability are setup planning and sequencing of operations.
The CAPP systems let process planners generate manufacturing process plans with the aid of advanced computer
software. CAPP systems are known to be more efficient than manual approaches and their main advantages are as
follows:
 
Automation and efficiency. Manufacturing plan generation time and effort can be greatly decreased by using
CAPP technologies to automate process‐planning operations. Moreover, the process planner's expertise and
experience are less important to the process‐planning process.
Optimization and cost reduction. The software can perform optimization algorithms to identify process plans
that minimize production time, reduce costs, or optimize other specified objectives. It considers various
factors (e.g., time, cost, or quality) and constraints to find the best possible solution.
Flexibility and adaptability. The software can easily adapt the process plans to changes in product designs or
manufacturing requirements. It can quickly generate new process plans based on updated inputs, allowing
manufacturers to respond to changes efficiently.
There are two principal approaches when dealing with CAPP systems: the variant approach and the generative
approach.
1.5.2.1 Variant Approach
In CAPP systems, the variant approach, also known as the retrieval method, refers to CAPP systems that obtain a
standard plan from a database and adapt it to fit a specific part. Typically, a coding system and a group technology
(GT) classification are used to organize the parts based on their geometrical and manufacturing characteristics.
This coding scheme uses a string of alphanumeric characters to stand for particular attributes shared by all parts or
products in the part family.
The Opitz coding system (13 digits), MICLASS (12 digits), KK3 system (21 digits), and DCLASS (8 digits) are
examples of typical GT coding systems. One of the most widely used GT coding schemes in manufacturing
companies is the Opitz system, which consists of 13 numbers categorized into three groups. First to fifth digit
codes are named form codes, and they are used to describe the geometrical attributes of the part. The sixth to ninth
digit codes are supplementary codes that provide relevant information to manufacturing such as raw material
shape, material, etc. The latter group of digits, tenth to thirteenth digits, are secondary codes that give information
about production processes and production sequences. Figures 1.4 and 1.5 show the possible values and the
corresponding explanation for the form and supplementary codes. As it can be observed, increasing the value of
the digit in the form codes means a more complex part. If a component has several features in the same code digit,

the value of the feature with higher complexity is chosen. For the secondary codes, they can be defined specifically
according to the company's needs. An example of using the Opitz coding system is shown in Figure 1.6.
The variant process planning has two operational stages, a preparatory stage and a production stage (Chryssolouris
2013). The preparatory stage involves the following tasks (Figure 1.7):
 
1. Part classification. The first step is to apply GT to classify parts into groups based on their similarities in
terms of shape, size, function, and manufacturing requirements.
2. Group formation. Once parts are classified into families and their process plans have been added to the
system, the next step is to form groups based on the similarity of manufacturing processes required to produce
those parts. Parts within the same family often share similar machining operations, tooling requirements, and
production methods. By forming groups, CAPP can leverage the similarities to design standardized process
plans for each group.

Figure 1.7 Preparatory stage of CAPP variant approach.

3. Creation of process‐planning templates. For each part group, process‐planning templates or standard process
plans are created based on previous process plans. These templates define the sequence of manufacturing
operations, tooling requirements, machining parameters, inspection points, and any other relevant information
needed to produce the parts in that group. The templates serve as a guide for generating specific process plans
for individual parts within the group.

Figure 1.8 Production stage of CAPP variant approach.
Source: Adapted from Chryssolouris (2013).
The second stage is named the production stage and it involves coding and classifying new components so the
CAPP system identifies the part's family and selects the corresponding process‐planning template. The system then
customizes the template to the specific requirements of the individual part, considering any unique features or
tolerances. This customization results in a variant process plan that is specific to the particular part while still
benefiting from the standardized processes of its group (Figure 1.8).
The primary benefits of a CAPP based on the variant approach are that the process planner has control over the
final process plan and that they are comparatively easier to use and comprehend than those based on the generative
approach. They may be a very useful tool for helping to organize and support process‐planning efforts. Variant
CAPP systems, however, are limited to planning components that are very similar to those that have already been
planned. Process planners still need to examine and modify the standard plan for the component.
1.5.2.2 Generative Approach
The foundation of this CAPP approach is starting from scratch with each component and developing a new process
plan. Because of this, this system does not make use of items that have been already manufactured; instead, it

combines product and process data to construct a process plan automatically for a new component. These plans are
produced by computer software using formulas, algorithms, decision logic, and geometric analysis. CAPP systems
use automatic feature identification algorithms to classify features and propose the best manufacturing operations.
For instance, in the machining process planning different setups and machining sequences may be defined
according to the features identified, their tool access directions, and the datum surfaces available. In accordance
with machining practices, the CAPP system defines machining sequencing based on knowledge‐focused reasoning
rules and heuristics.
Figure 1.9 CAPP generative approach.
The major components that define a generative CAPP software are shown in Figure 1.9 and are defined as (Scallan
2003):
 
A part‐based system that defines the material and geometry, including geometric and dimensional tolerances
and surface quality specifications. This system interprets the product manufacturing information (PMI)
annotations from CAD models and conducts feature recognition processes to completely describe each
component of the product.
A database of information on the manufacturing machinery accessible and their capacities and capabilities.
A subsystem that detects and sequences the operations and the required process parameters based on the part
description and available equipment. This is the core of the generative CAPP system, and it relies on
advanced algorithms based on expert systems or other techniques.
A report generator to create the process plan.
Generative process planning often incorporates knowledge and rules from domain experts, which are encoded into
the software. This CAPP approach applies advanced computer methods to automate and optimize the process‐
planning tasks. Theoretically, human intervention is not necessary for generative CAPP solutions. However, this is
rarely the case because most systems need some kind of assistance. In fact, most CAPP works are not easily

scalable to other processes, according to recent surveys, and no completely generative CAPP systems have been
implemented yet (Al‐wswasi et al. 2018).
The specific computer methods used in generative CAPP software solutions can vary and it depends on the
complexity of the manufacturing processes, available data, desired optimization objectives, and the specific
requirements of the industry. Some of these advanced computer methods are discussed as follows:
 
Expert systems. Expert systems utilize rule‐based reasoning to capture the knowledge and expertise of human
process‐planning experts. These systems encode domain‐specific rules, best practices, and heuristics into an
inference engine, which can generate process plans based on input parameters and constraints.
Machine learning (ML). ML algorithms are commonly used in generative CAPP to analyze historical process‐
planning data and learn patterns, relationships, and rules from the data. This learned knowledge can then be
used to generate new process plans based on similar input data.
Deep learning approaches. Neural networks, particularly deep learning architectures, can be used in
generative CAPP to analyze and interpret complex data, such as product designs or manufacturing
parameters. Neural networks can learn from large datasets and generate process plans based on the learned
patterns and relationships. They can be employed for tasks such as feature recognition, process optimization,
or decision‐making in generative CAPP.
Constraint programming. Constraint programming is a technique that models and solves problems by defining
constraints and finding solutions that satisfy those constraints. In generative CAPP, constraint programming
can define and enforce various manufacturing constraints, such as material availability, tooling constraints,
machine capabilities, and process sequencing requirements. It helps generate feasible process plans under
different types of constraints.

Product Data and Manufacturability
2.1 Introduction
When the process planning department receives all data of a product, usually in the form of three‐dimensional (3D)
models and their associated engineering drawings, planners must analyze and ensure that any defined specification
in the data will be fulfilled during the manufacturing stage. In manufacturing companies that are hired to produce a
specific product or parts, all product data is treated as a binding agreement between the manufacturer and the
customer, and this is the main reason why planners should carefully check and analyze the product data before a
formal agreement is signed. The drawings (a typical engineering drawing is shown in Figure 2.1), created by the
design department, represent specific functional requirements that have been established based on the part's
intended role within the overall product. The part is precisely defined to ensure that, when combined with the
entire mechanism, it performs its technical functions as intended (Halevi 2003). In addition to general details like
the component's material, designation, coding, production quantity, or weight, the drawing provides essential
information about the dimensions and tolerances (both dimensional and geometric) of the part.
This chapter reviews common information that manufacturing process planners may find in product data, such as
3D models, engineering drawings, and their corresponding bill of materials (BOMs). Dimensional and geometrical
specifications according to the International Organization for Standardization/American Society of Mechanical
Engineers (ISO/ASME) standards are briefly explained, paying special attention to the ambiguity issue in the
design intent that usually exists if these standards are not correctly applied. This issue can be a critical problem
when outsourcing manufacturing components. The importance of avoiding it with the correct use of ISO/ASME
standards about geometric product specifications (GPS) is shown by providing some examples. Additionally, other
notations in engineering drawings, such as general tolerances and surface roughness indications, are reviewed.

2.2 Product Data
2.2.1 Product Structure and Bill of Materials
A product structure arranges the components that make up a product hierarchically, making it possible to depict the
parts and their attributes. The materials, components, subassemblies, and other elements can be visually
represented in a hierarchical format using the product structure. This depicts how the pieces are grouped together
on an assembly drawing or how they converge at different points during the manufacturing process (Figure 2.2).
Engineers start the process of creating a new product by laying out a framework that lists the essential parts and
systems needed to build the intended product. After that, each component is evaluated to see if a commercial
component can be purchased to perform the required function or if custom parts should be designed. The engineer
specifies the necessity for new pieces when appropriate existing alternatives cannot be found, which causes the
product's structure to gradually expand. Product structure allows for the construction of complex, one‐of‐a‐kind
product structures as well as the development and reuse of multiple pieces and assemblies.

A graphic representation of a product called product 1 is provided in Figure 2.3. The product structure is
graphically represented, and the number of items required to create each of the parent goods is indicated in
parentheses. A BOM for product 1 is also included in the figure, where the total amount of each item's usage is
compiled into a single list for the product.
Figure 2.2 Example of a product structure.

Figure 2.3 Product structure for product 1 and summarized bill of materials (BOM).
The main properties that are commonly listed in a BOM are the following (Adithan 2007):
 
Name, material, and quantity of individual parts required to complete an assembly.
If the individual components are going to be purchased or manufactured. It may be more cost‐effective to buy
the part rather than manufacturing it in‐house, especially if the components are common commercial parts
such as bolts, nuts, washers, bearings, or plastic‐molded parts.
The name, date, and signature of the engineer who prepared the BOM. This is typically found in the title
block of drawings.
Figure 2.4 shows an example of a BOM as a part list in a drawing.
A product normally needs two different kinds of BOMs: an engineering BOM (eBOM, usually named directly as
BOM) and a manufacturing BOM (mBOM). Items are mostly arranged in the eBOM according to how they relate
to the parent product as shown in assembly drawings. In other words, the eBOM contains all of the product's
components as well as technical information about them from a design perspective. Nevertheless, this method
might not fully describe the grouping of parts at every stage of production or contain all the information required
for procurement or manufacturing support. To achieve this, the eBOM is converted into the mBOM, which
contains every item needed from an assembly and production perspective. Therefore, the mBOM specifies the
processes that are required at the execution stage. Figure 2.5 shows the mBOM for the previous bicycle product
(Figure 2.2).

Figure 2.4 Example of an engineering BOMs (eBOMs).
Source: Personat Martínez (2022).
The eBOM is used by engineers and process planners to identify which parts need process planning. The
production planning and control department relies on the eBOM to decide on manufacturing and scheduling dates.
On the contrary, the mBOM is used to estimate standard times as well as time allowances (cycle time) for
manufacturing and assembly procedures and to guarantee that all required components are available during the
assembly process.
2.2.2 3D Models and Engineering Drawings
Traditionally, the 3D design models elaborated by the design department are passed to the manufacturing
department by transferring them to 2D engineering drawings, including the necessary production information such
as dimensional and geometrical tolerances, materials, surface roughness, welding information, etc. However, more
recent practices apply the model‐based definition (MBD) approach to work directly with the 3D models with all
the manufacturing information embedded in the model itself eliminating the need for engineering drawings. Under
this approach, the 3D models include all the required engineering data using 3D annotations that are interpretable
among different software. Figure 2.6 shows an example of this type of 3D design model. All this engineering data

is named as product manufacturing information (PMI), and they must comply with the ISO/ASME standards about
product data representation and exchange (ASME Y14.41 and ISO 10303, ASME (2019), ISO (2024)). PMI data
are created with 3D annotation tools in the computer‐aided design (CAD) systems and can be imported and
interpreted in other software to assist in different tasks such as tolerance analysis, generation of computer
numerical controlled (CNC) programs for machining or coordinate measuring machine (CMM) programs for
inspection. For example, computer‐aided manufacturing (CAM) software can interpret the PMI in the 3D model
and can adapt the cutting tool paths and conditions according to the information related to dimensional tolerances
and surface quality. This approach saves significant time and cost in the product development process, and it also
opens the door to automating other activities downstream.
Figure 2.5 Example of manufacturing BOM (mBOM) for a bicycle product.
The use of the MBD approach in the industry is gaining relevance since it presents important benefits such as the
following:
 
Reduces human‐induced production and inspection errors, saving labor and time.
Reduces product development cycles, which means faster times to market.
Improves communication and makes an easier collaboration among stakeholders.

Allows up‐to‐date information embedded and easily revisable.
Reduces waste since there are no paper files to maintain and no misinterpreting 2D drawings, which cuts
down on the waste from scraps and rework.

2.2.3 Dimensional and Geometric Tolerances
2.2.3.1 Dimensional Tolerances
The dimensions of the parts in the design drawings or 3D models represent the basic or nominal dimensions of the
part and its shape. These are the values that the designer would like to have for the part if it could be manufactured
to an exact size without errors or variations in the manufacturing process. However, this is not possible, so
tolerances are used to define the limits of permissible variation for the part to maintain its functionality. The parts
that are outside these limits will be discarded or reprocessed.
Dimensional tolerances can be specified in different ways:
 

Bilateral tolerances. The deviation from nominal values can be from both sides – positive and negative – for
example, 
;
.
Unilateral tolerance. The deviation is only admissible in one direction, for example, 
.
Maximum and minimum dimensions, for example, 2.505–2.495.
According to ISO format using IT indices and ISO positions, for example, 20h6; 18F9. See Appendix 1 for
the ISO Tables according to “ISO 286‐1: 2010 Geometrical product specifications (GPS) – ISO code system
for tolerances on linear sizes – Part 1: Basis of tolerances, deviations and fits.”
Figure 2.7 shows an example of dimensional tolerancing for a cylindrical part using maximum and minimum
admissible dimensions.
Figure 2.7 Dimensions for a cylindrical part. Units in mm.

Figure 2.8 Four possible shapes that fit the previous dimensioned part. Units in mm.
2.2.3.2 Geometric Tolerances
Although the sizes of parts can be indicated quite accurately on the drawings and 3D models with dimensional
tolerances, they often do not define the true geometric shape of the workpiece with sufficient accuracy. Consider,
for example, the cylindrical part from Figure 2.7, dimensioned with considerable accuracy. With the specified
dimensions, this part can be made of any of the forms shown in Figure 2.8 which must be accepted as good.
To limit these geometric shapes that may produce functional or interchangeability issues, the part of Figure 2.7
should specify a set of geometric characteristics to define the part more accurately. These indications are known as
geometric tolerances. Figure 2.9 shows the initial part with the indications of geometric tolerances that uniquely
define the acceptable geometry of the part.
Table 2.1 shows different geometric tolerances established by the ISO/ASME standards, which are classified as
intrinsic (individual feature, unreferenced) or extrinsic (related features, referenced), the type of tolerance, and the
associated symbol.
2.2.3.3 Datum Features and Datum Reference Frames
The extrinsic geometrical tolerances relate different features, for example, the perpendicularity tolerance relates
the allowable perpendicular deviation between features. The information about the features' relationship is given in
the feature control frame, which defines the type of geometric tolerancing, the tolerance zone, and the datum
references. The datum references indicate the datum features (surfaces or features of size such as holes or widths)
that are used to locate the tolerancing zone. To correctly locate the tolerance zone, the feature control frame
indicates the datum reference frame (DRF) that defines the coordinate system that locks the part's degrees of

freedom. This is done by indicating in the feature control frame the sequence of datum features that apply to
position and orient the part.

An important distinction should be made between the concept of datums and datum features. While datum features
indicate the physical feature of the part that is used to reference the geometrical tolerance, a datum is a theoretical
and perfect feature (plane, axis, or point) that represents the reference feature, that is, a datum is a geometrically
exact representation of the datum feature. Unlike datums, datum features are real entities that are not exact and
may have an irregular form. When conducting an inspection operation, measurement instruments physically touch
the datum features, and the datum are generated by the measurement equipment (gauge pins, angle plates, V‐
blocks, etc.). In this sense, the instrument surfaces that touch the datum features are called datum simulators since
they provide the exact representation of the datums.
Figures 2.10a, b and 2.11 illustrate previous concepts related to datums and DRFs.

2.2.4 Traditional Tolerancing Versus GPS/Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T)
Conventional or traditional tolerancing, commonly referred to as “direct tolerancing,” is a method of tolerancing
where only dimensional tolerances are given, usually in ± form, and no geometrical tolerances are provided. When
manufacturing is outsourced, drawings based on traditional tolerancing usually result in a lot of issues because the
part is not completely defined, and the supplier does not have a shared understanding between the customer's
design department and his own workshop. It is crucial to keep in mind that when a drawing is given to another
business, it either becomes a contract or a portion of one. As a result, the two parties' legally enforceable
agreement is contained in the tolerancing notations.
The ambiguity that arises when applying traditional tolerancing is a fundamental issue. It raises some questions
regarding just what must be produced, as it was presented in Figure 2.8. The specifications frequently contain so
much ambiguity or uncertainty that even if the parts are manufactured to fulfill the tolerance requirements, they
may not function as intended. In some cases, geometric tolerances are combined with conventional tolerancing to
alleviate the ambiguity issue. This is called hybrid tolerancing, but the ambiguity problem is not entirely resolved
because the geometric tolerances merely serve to enhance conventional tolerancing.
In actual practice, most products work despite this ambiguity issue, but it results in higher costs (tighter
tolerances), larger manufacturing times to clarify design dimensions, higher waste, etc. To overcome these
limitations and reduce costs and lead times, modern manufacturing companies are being forced to adopt more
precise and unambiguous tolerancing approaches using the GPS approach from ISO standards (ISO 14638: 2015,
ISO [2015] and related standards) or the equivalent GD&T approach from ASME standards (ASME Y14.5: 2018,
ASME [2018]).
GPS (from now onward, GPS and GD&T are interchangeable) is required to guarantee that the drawing clearly
conveys the design intent. 3D models and drawings are increasingly being used for production outsourcing, and

any ambiguity in the geometry of the part will result in larger manufacturing costs and times. Conventional
tolerancing is only effective in cases where the manufactured parts exhibit minimal form flaws and all angles are
nearly faultless when compared to size tolerances. If this is not the case, GPS ought to be used.
The fundamental benefit of GPS is that it makes it possible to express tolerances with better precision and distinct
meaning, especially in the presence of severe shape errors and angular variations in the part. The GPS tolerancing
can very accurately imitate the part's operation since GPS sets the functional part tolerances. Experience has
demonstrated that to make the part function; traditional tolerancing pushes the designer to use smaller tolerances –
smaller tolerances than those GPS would have used in the drawing (Shepherd 1992). This is the financial fallout
from conventional tolerancing, which frequently causes needless issues with production and inspection.
Figure 2.12 shows a part with traditional tolerancing bounded with dimensional tolerances ±. The drawing defines
all necessary dimensions of the part. However, this tolerancing approach has several fundamental limitations.
First, it is impossible to know exactly from where to where the specified dimensions go. For example, in the
dimension 15 ± 0.1, it is not known the measuring direction where a deviation of ±0.1 mm is allowed, leaving the
ambiguous part design in two alternatives, as shown in Figure 2.13a. Similarly, the distance 20 ± 0.15 mm from the
hole center to the edge of the workpiece is also ambiguously defined since it is not known whether the
specification refers to the distance between the median plane and the average circumference, the distance between
the plane and the circle outside the material, or the distance between the closest points, as shown in Figure 2.13b.

The tolerancing according to the ISO standard “Geometrical product specifications (GPS) – Geometrical
tolerancing – Tolerances of form, orientation, location, and run‐out (ISO 1101: 2013)” allows unambiguously

define the geometries of the part described above. For example, the indication of a reference element and a
positioning tolerance defines precisely what deviation is allowed in both cases, the lateral deviation of the surface,
and the position of the hole with respect to the reference (Figure 2.14a, b).
Another important limitation of traditional tolerancing is that the dimensions cannot be assured that they are
aligned with each other or perpendicular to each other; however, they might be in the drawing. For example, all
dimensions may be within tolerances, although the generated parts present an important squaring error (Figure
2.15). A correct use of ISO GPS will allow the restriction of the orientation defects according to part functionality.
For the example shown in Figure 2.12, the GPS tolerancing approach can precisely limit the part's geometry
without ambiguity. Figure 2.16 shows the proper GPS tolerancing approach for the example.
Another important limitation of the traditional tolerancing approach is that references are not specified, so the
operator does not know which surface should be used as the datum surface for clamping, inspecting, and so on.
Figures 2.17 and 2.18 show an example where the position of the two holes is not unequivocally defined, which
may result in different interpretations for manufacturing or inspection.

Traditional tolerancing can be used in GPS‐based drawings but must be limited to geometric elements of size and
geometric elements that define depth or length. For the reasons described above, traditional tolerancing should not
be used to locate geometric elements.
2.2.5 General Tolerances
2.2.5.1 Dimensional and Geometrical Tolerances for Machined Parts
Standards “ISO 2768‐1/2:1989 General tolerances – Part 1: Tolerances for linear and angular dimensions without
individual tolerance indications” and “Part 2: Geometrical tolerances for features without individual tolerance
indications” allow to facilitate the definition of generic tolerances in machined parts without having to indicate
them one by one on the drawings. General tolerances apply to all dimensions or geometries of the part that do not
show any tolerance indication.
Note that those dimensions or geometries that are functional and require a tight manufacturing tolerance should not
be defined by general tolerances. Instead, they must be specified in the drawing by their respective dimensional
and geometric limitations.
The ISO standard defines four classes of generic dimensional tolerances: fine quality, f; average quality, m; coarse
quality, c; and very rude quality, v, These four classes are comparable to a quality index IT11, IT13, IT15, and
IT17, respectively. According to the tolerance class and nominal value, the general dimensional tolerances related
to dimensions and angles are defined in Tables 2.2 and 2.3.
For geometric tolerances, three types of tolerance classes are defined: H, K, and L going from more to less quality.
Thus, according to general geometric tolerances, the geometric deviations related to straightness, flatness,
perpendicularity, run‐out, and symmetry are defined in Tables 2.4–2.7.
For circularity, the general circularity tolerance is numerically equal to the diameter tolerance, but in no case will it
be higher than the corresponding value of tolerance given by the general circular run‐out from Table 2.6.
2.2.5.2 Dimensional and Geometrical Tolerances for Metal Casting Parts

For casting parts, general tolerances can be found in norm ISO 8062, “Dimensional and geometrical tolerances for
molded parts – Part 3: General dimensional and geometrical tolerances and machining allowances for castings.”
The norm defines the following terms:
 
DCT. Dimensional casting tolerance.
DCTG. Dimensional casting tolerance grade.
GCT. Geometrical casting tolerance.
GCTG. Geometrical casting tolerance grade.

General dimensional and geometrical tolerances for roundness, parallelism, perpendicularity, symmetry, and
flatness are defined as shown in Tables 2.8–2.10 (other tolerances, such as straightness and coaxiality, can be
found in norm ISO 8062). As shown in the tables, the tolerances are defined according to 16 grades for
dimensional tolerances and 7 grades for geometrical tolerances. According to the type of casting process, the norm
indicates the most common general tolerance grades for each process (see Tables 2.11 and 2.12).
2.2.5.3 General Tolerance Indication in Engineering Drawings
When general tolerances are applied, they must be indicated in the drawing title block or nearby using the
inscription of the standard and tolerance class. Thus, in the case of using a class m for dimensional and class K for
geometric in machining parts, it is indicated “ISO 2768‐mK.”

Figures 2.19 and 2.20 show two examples of generic tolerances. Figures 2.21 and 2.22 show the constraints of the
final part according to those general tolerances.
For the case of castings, the same procedure applies. When general orientation tolerances apply, the datum system
should be indicated in the drawing using the term “ISO 8062‐3 DS” followed by the datum surfaces. An example
of a casting drawing with general tolerances is shown in Figure 2.23.

2.2.6 Surface Roughness and Surface Treatments
In engineering drawings, surface roughness is indicated using the symbol shown in Figure 2.24. The fields a, b, c,
d, and e in this symbol can be used to indicate which manufacturing process should be employed, the level of
surface roughness (Ra, Rz), the direction of cutting tool marks, and so on. According to norm ISO 1302–2002
(ISO 2002), the following characteristics may be indicated:
Figure 2.19 Example 1 – part design with general tolerances.
 
Field a. Maximum surface roughness value in μm or maximum surface roughness index (N1–N12).
Field a and b. If a maximum and minimum value is required, both values are indicated, the higher value over
the lower value.
Field c. Manufacturing process, surface treatment, and coating; for example, turned, plated, ground, etc.
Field d. Direction of cutting tool marks.
Field e. Machining allowance.

Figure 2.25 shows an example of the application of surface roughness symbols. Table 2.13 shows the equivalence
of Nx (N1–N12) classes from ISO 1302 norm, the average surface roughness, and common manufacturing
processes able to reach that surface roughness.
It should be noted that allowing a high surface roughness value in a dimension where a tight dimensional tolerance
is needed makes no sense since microgeometry defects in surface roughness may reach the same level as
macrogeometry defects defined by the dimensional tolerance. Therefore, for a given dimensional tolerance, a
minimal surface roughness requirement may be defined. Table 2.14 provides common values considered by
process planners to relate dimensional tolerances and minimal surface roughness requirements.

2.3 Manufacturability
Designers should apply design for manufacturing and assembly (DFMA) techniques when designing a product.
There are many DFMA tools integrated into common CAD systems to assist designers in this process. Figure 2.26
illustrates an example of a DFMA tool integrated into a CAD system (SolidWorks). However, when process
planners review the engineering drawings, design changes may also be recommended to improve the
manufacturing process of the product and reduce manufacturing costs. Although design considerations related to
manufacturing depend on the manufacturing process chosen and, at this stage, manufacturing processes have not
been selected yet, process planners may expect the use of some types of processes according to materials and part
geometry. In any case, when manufacturing process selection is conducted, additional recommendations may also
be given to improve the part's manufacturability. It should be noted that proper DFMA practices lead to shorter
manufacturing/assembly times, lower costs, increased product reliability, and elimination of process waste.
Figure 2.26 Design for manufacturing and assembly (DFMA) tools included in conventional CAD systems assist
designers in applying good design for manufacturing practices.

Some basic design considerations for metal parts to be produced by machining and casting are discussed in the
following subsections. Readers interested in more detailed DFMA practices may refer to (Boothroyd et al. 2010;
Bralla 1998; Trucks 1987).
2.3.1 Machining Parts
Important characteristics to be checked in machining designed parts are (Trucks 1987):
 
Interior corner fillets. Avoid small internal corners in pockets or similar features that force the use of different
cutting tools with different radii, increasing machining time and cost. As a guideline, the recommended radius
is 1.3 times the cutting tool radius.
Floor fillets. The radius of floor fillets should be compatible with standard bull or ball end mills. No floor
fillets are easily machined by flat‐end mills.
Hole diameter‐to‐depth ratio. Due to issues with tool stiffness, this ratio should be less than 1:10, and ratios
around 1:4 are recommended.
Cavity width‐to‐depth ratio. Similar to the previous case, due to tool stiffness issues, cavity width‐to‐depth
ratios are recommended to be less than 1:4.
Wall thickness. Avoid machined walls with a thickness of less than 0.8 mm due to difficulties in reaching tight
tolerances (deflection issues).
Machined text. If text should be machined on a surface, use machine‐engraved text instead of embossed text
for lower costs. A text font of Sans‐Serif or Arial and 20 points size or higher are recommended.
Flat‐bottomed holes. Avoid flat‐bottomed holes if they are small and are expected to be drilled. Cone‐
bottomed holes with the angle of common drills for the applied material are recommended.
Entry of holes. The axis of the hole should be perpendicular to the entrance and exit surfaces to avoid tool
deviation, breakages, and burr removal issues.
Thread depth. A minimum length for threads is 1.5 times the hole diameter although a factor of four is
recommended. For blind holes, a no‐thread zone with a length of 1.5 times the hole diameter is needed at the
end of the hole.
2.3.2 Metal Casting Parts
Important characteristics to be checked in metal casting designed parts are (Trucks 1987):
 
Uniform thickness. A good practice is to keep the number of varying thicknesses in the design to a minimum
and always design smooth transitions between different thicknesses. Sharp corners and small radii in a change
of section should be avoided since they may cause turbulence during casting.
Fillets. Avoid sharp corners that can reduce tooling life. The applied fillets should be higher than 1 mm, but
not too high to avoid the formation of casting defects such as pipes. A radius equivalent to one‐third of the
summation of the intersected walls is recommended.
Joint design. Joints result in an area of metal with a higher volume than the rest of the junction, which may
produce hot spots with solidification issues, such as pipes. Some of these joints can be slightly modified to
reduce this problem by following some joint design rules.
Ribs. The ribs section should be 25% of the section of the main member unless the resultant rib is considered
too thin.
Minimum wall thickness. Avoid wall thicknesses too thin that may produce early solidification issues. Table
2.15 shows an example of the minimum thickness for aluminum alloys in different casting processes.

Selection of Manufacturing Processes
3.1 Introduction
Choosing the right material for a part or product is a critical aspect of the design and manufacturing process.
Designers are responsible for not only creating products that serve their intended purpose but also selecting the
most suitable material. However, the selection of a specific material can limit the available manufacturing options.
It is important to recognize that material and process choices are not limitless and are influenced by the
organization's manufacturing capabilities and the range of materials and processes available.
During the design phase, manufacturing typically assesses the chosen material. In some cases, manufacturing may
suggest an alternative material if the chosen one is not easily manufacturable or if it leads to high manufacturing
costs. This prompts a meaningful discussion between manufacturing and design teams. Such discussions require
manufacturing to have a thorough understanding of available materials, their properties, and their suitability for
different manufacturing processes. This underscores the close connection between material selection and the
choice of manufacturing processes (Scallan 2003).
The goal of this chapter is to introduce common materials and manufacturing processes and outline methods for
selecting them.
3.2 Materials in Manufacturing
The variety and breadth of materials utilized in modern manufacturing are immense. Nonetheless, the materials
utilized in manufacturing can be divided into four major types: composites, ceramics, metals, and polymers.
The most widely used materials in production are metals. Table 3.1 illustrates the further classification of metals
into ferrous and nonferrous categories (Scallan 2003).
Ceramics typically consist of a combination of metallic and nonmetallic substances, and they often exhibit greater
strength and hardness than metals when exposed to high temperatures. However, ceramics are more prone to
brittleness compared to metals, which is a significant drawback associated with their use. Ceramics can be
categorized into two main groups based on their composition: oxides and nonoxides. Nonoxide ceramics are also
divided into carbides and nitrides ceramics (Table 3.2).

In recent decades, the utilization of polymers in manufacturing, especially as substitutes for other materials, has
gained significant importance. A mere observation of the average car is enough to understand the extensive
application and significance of polymers as manufacturing materials. For example, take the widespread usage of
polymers in bumpers and automotive interiors. The three different categories of polymers are elastomers,
thermosets, and thermoplastics, as depicted in Table 3.2.
More recently, great advances in materials that consist of two or more distinct phases bonded together have
impacted industries such as aeronautics, space, or automobiles. These materials are named composite materials to
distinguish them from those dissolved in one another, such as metal alloys. The main benefits of composites are
their high resistance to wear, corrosion, and high‐temperature exposure. Furthermore, they can be fabricated in
large, complex shapes that would be difficult or impossible to make with other materials and reduce machining,
assembly, and fastener costs (Kutz 2015).
Composites are usually classified by the type of material used for the matrix. The three primary categories of
composites are organic matrix composites (polymer and carbon matrix), metal matrix composites, and ceramic
matrix composites. Furthermore, depending on the reinforcement type, composite materials can be classified into
particulate composites, fiber‐reinforced composites, and structural composites (Ibrahim et al. 2015). Table 3.3
shows the common classification of composite materials.

3.3 Manufacturing Processes
Manufacturing engineers have a wide range of options when it comes to selecting a suitable manufacturing
process. Each process possesses its inherent capabilities in terms of surface finish, dimensional accuracy, and
geometric accuracy within certain ranges. Moreover, some processes may be better suitable for producing specific
shapes or features. Despite the intrinsic capacities of different manufacturing processes, it is important to note that
more than one process can fulfill the manufacturing requirements. Hence, having a good understanding of the
available process types is crucial for an optimal manufacturing process selection.

To produce a part, a sequence of manufacturing processes is required, and they are commonly classified as basic or
primary processes, secondary processes, property‐enhancing processes, and finishing processes (Figure 3.1). Basic
or primary processes try to optimize the use of material and obtain a geometry very close to the final shape of the
part. These processes are also called net or near net shape manufacturing processes (net processes do not require
secondary operations to reach the final geometry) and are mainly casting, molding, forming, and powder
metallurgy processes. Secondary processes transform the resultant part from basic processes into the final
geometry or very close to it. For instance, after a basic process of casting, machining operations are common
secondary processes; after flat rolling processes, stamping operations such as punching or bending may correspond
to secondary operations. Processes to enhance material properties may be needed after secondary operations, for
instance, heat‐treating operations. After processes such as heat treatment, it may be necessary to conduct additional
secondary processes to reach the required tolerances. Finally, finishing operations such as powder coating,
painting, electroplating, etc., may be conducted at the end of the process.
Figure 3.1 A common sequence of manufacturing processes to produce a part.
Process planners should know the main manufacturing processes, their limitations, capabilities, and typical
applications to guide them in proper manufacturing process selection. The next subsections provide basic
information about the five main groups in manufacturing processes (joining processes are omitted here): casting
and molding, forming, powder metallurgy, machining, and surface processes. For a more detailed explanation,
readers may refer to the relevant books given in the references (Black and Kohser 2008; Groover 2020; Kalpakjian
and Schmid 2009).
3.3.1 Casting and Molding Processes
The wide variety of casting processes enables the manufacturing of parts or products in almost any desired shape
or size. Casting processes are known for their efficiency in transforming raw metals into finished parts, making
them a rapid manufacturing method. Furthermore, utilizing the appropriate casting process can minimize the
requirement for additional postprocessing steps. On the contrary, molding processes refer to similar processes
applied to plastic materials.
In casting, the molten metal is poured into a mold cavity that represents the final product. The molten metal cools
while heat is transferred through the mold, solidifying into the required shape. Casting processes can be divided
into two main categories: expendable mold processes and permanent mold processes.

When using expendable mold methods, the casting is removed by destroying the molds. Sand, plaster, and
ceramics combined with a bonding agent are common mold materials in these cases. On the contrary, since the
mold is reusable in permanent mold techniques, it needs to be made such that the casting may be removed with
ease. Permanent molds are usually composed of metals and refractory coatings (e.g., tool steel alloys) that are
strong at high temperatures. Generally, casting processes are employed because they can process materials that
would be difficult to handle using other methods. Furthermore, they allow the production of complex shapes with
internal cavities or hollow sections, and are often the most cost‐effective method of production.
3.3.1.1 General Characteristics of Casting and Molding Processes
Table 3.4 briefly describes each casting and molding process and some applications (Wick et al. 1984). Figure 3.2
shows some characteristics of the main casting processes. As it can be noted, casting/molding methods are
versatile in terms of the range of part sizes that may be accomplished and the intricacy of geometric shapes that
can be produced. They also show versatility in terms of the materials they can work with, such as ceramics,
polymers, and metals. Castability is the degree to which a material can be properly cast while still meeting quality
standards. The fluidity and reactivity of the molten material are the main elements impacting castability, while
casting techniques can also have an impact. The capacity of the molten material to flow and fill the entire mold
cavity is referred to as fluidity.

Choosing the suitable casting process relies on several considerations, such as the material properties, dimensions,
weight, and intricacy of the geometry, as well as labor, equipment, and tooling expenses. Other factors include the
desired tolerances and surface finish, required strength, quantity, production rate, and overall quality standards.
These characteristics are mentioned for a few of the more often used casting techniques in Tables 3.5 and 3.6
(Scallan 2003).
Previous casting processes apply for specific production volumes, named the economic batch quantity (EBQ),
which is defined by different cost terms such as labor/operating cost, equipment/capital cost, and tooling cost.
Table 3.6 shows typical ranges for production volume, production rate, and costs for common casting processes.
The table also shows common tool life values of their corresponding molds or patterns in the case of expendable
mold processes.
3.3.2 Forming Processes
In forming, a solid billet of material is typically shaped through the application of force to achieve the desired
shape. While forming can produce intricate shapes, it is not as versatile as casting when it comes to geometric
possibilities. However, forming has the advantage of yielding superior microstructure that enhances mechanical
properties.
Forming processes can be divided into two main categories: bulk forming and sheet forming. The following lists
some typical processes for both categories: 

 
Bulk‐forming. Rolling, drawing, extrusion, and forging.
Sheet forming. Sheet–metal forming, vacuum forming, blow molding, superplastic forming, and contact
molding.
Bulk‐forming processes are commonly referred to as deformation processes in metals. In these processes, a tool's
compressive loading causes most of the shaping's deformation. The material is typically heated at a temperature
higher than its recrystallization temperature during bulk forming. At this temperature, there are no negative effects
on the material's mechanical characteristics, and higher deformation ratios can be applied in most metals. If bulk
forming is performed at temperatures below recrystallization, only ductile materials can be processed. Rolling,
drawing, extrusion, and forging are examples of bulk processing, hot rolling being the most popular method.

As the name implies, sheet forming is used as raw material sheets with high surface area to thickness ratios.
Bending, stretching, or shearing loads are typically applied to produce the form change. Similar to bulk‐forming
techniques, successful sheet forming depends on the ductility of the material being used. Vacuum forming, blow
molding, and sheet–metal forming (including bending, deep drawing, and stretch forming) are all examples of
sheet‐forming techniques.

3.3.2.1 General Characteristics of Bulk Forming
The selection of a suitable forming process will depend on several factors, including the material, size, weight,
complexity of the geometry, labor expenses, tooling costs, necessary tolerances and surface finishes, strength,
quantity, and production rate. Tables 3.7 and 3.8 list these parameters for a few of the more popular bulk‐forming
methods (Scallan 2003). For general characteristics in sheet forming, please refer to Kalpakjian and Schmid (2009)
and Scallan (2003).
3.3.3 Powder Metallurgy Processes
Powder processing, also known as powder metallurgy, is the process of molding parts made of metal powders by
applying heat and pressure, sometimes at the same time. The powder metallurgy process usually consists of four
main phases, with extra processing added if needed. First, the metal powder must be combined with any necessary
additives, including binding agents or lubricants. Then, the powder mixture is compressed. In hot compacting,
heat, and pressure are applied simultaneously, while in cold compacting, the metal powder is just subjected to
pressure. When it comes to heat compacting, the procedure is finished unless further processing is required.
However, with cold compacting, after the compacting is complete, the part goes through a procedure called
sintering. Sintering involves the controlled application of heat to facilitate the formation of metallurgical bonds
among the powdered metal particles. The temperatures employed typically reach around 70–80% of the melting
point of the material. Following sintering, additional processing might be necessary. The powder metallurgy
process is employed for the mass production of small, intricate geometries that are challenging to fabricate using
alternative methods, often eliminating the need for secondary processing. For general characteristics in powder
metallurgy processes, please refer to Kalpakjian and Schmid (2009) and Scallan (2003).

3.3.4 Machining Processes
A range of operations falls under the heading of machining procedures, which entail removing material from the
workpiece. These can be divided into three major subcategories, cutting processes, abrasive processes, and
nontraditional machining processes (Figure 3.3).
The great majority of machining procedures employed are classified as cutting procedures because they remove
material from the workpiece in the form of chips, leaving the completed geometry behind. The part quality in these
processes ranges from IT6 in boring operations to IT13‐12 in drilling or shaping operations. For better dimensional
and surface roughness quality, abrasive processes are required. Under these processes, IT5‐01 and surface
roughness up to 0.01 μm can be reached. Nontraditional machining processes are applied under special
circumstances when cutting processes cannot be applied or may be uneconomical. For instance, machining very
deep and small holes in tool steels requires electrodischarge machining or machining at micro‐ or nanoscale
requires chemical machining.
Machining may be the most cost‐effective way of manufacturing when producing small batches. Additionally,
there are several reasons why machining operations are used, including the necessity for improved surface quality
that cannot be achieved by casting or forming processes alone and the need for tighter dimensional precision.
However, there are several clear drawbacks to using machining operations. By their own nature, they produce
waste material; they demand more capital, energy, and labor per unit of output than casting and forming
operations; and they often take longer than casting and forming procedures. Despite these drawbacks, machining
techniques are prevalent and play an essential role in manufacturing.

Figure 3.3 Machining processes classification with dimensional quality (IT) and surface roughness ranges.
3.3.4.1 General Characteristics of Machining Processes
A multitude of parameters will determine which machining process is best. Among them, the most relevant are the
geometrical quality achievable and the costs (labor, equipment, and tooling costs). The surface roughness and main
geometrical tolerances for most common machining processes are shown in Table 3.9. In terms of economy, the
processes are listed in order from the cheapest to the most expensive one. Figure 3.4 also shows graphically
common surface roughness ranges of operation and relative costs of machining processes and other manufacturing
processes.
Furthermore, machining processes require a minimum machining allowance for proper material removal. Table
3.10 shows typical machining allowances required for cutting and abrasive processes.
For nontraditional machining processes, the main characteristics related to typical tolerances, surface roughness,
costs, and production rates can be found in Table 3.11.
3.3.5 Surface Processes

Surface processing is usually done after all manufacturing processing is complete, apart from heat treatments. Bulk
treatments, surface treatments, surface coatings, and cleaning procedures are the most popular surface procedures
(Table 3.12).
Bulk treatments such as annealing, precipitation hardening, etc., alter the microstructure and subsequently the
properties of the majority of the material being treated, whereas surface treatments (e.g., anodizing, nitriding, etc.)
only alter the mechanical properties of the material's surface, usually corrosion resistance and hardness. Table 3.13
presents some types of bulk and surface treatments and their effects on the material.
Similarly, surface coatings are used to improve mechanical properties at the surface level. To increase corrosion
resistance, impact resistance, and thermal barrier properties, metal surfaces are coated with materials such as
carbides, powdered metals and alloys, and ceramics. Lastly, throughout processing, a number of parts and/or goods
may pick up surface imperfections. To remove these surface impurities, cleaning techniques such as solvent
cleaning, pickling, and vapor degreasing can be used.
3.4 Manufacturing Process Selection
3.4.1 Factors in Process Selection
The critical factors to be considered in manufacturing process selection are:
 
Shape or geometry considerations. The geometry of the part will constrain the manufacturing process that can
be used. For instance, hollow parts cannot be manufactured by forging processes, or very thin walls are not
possible to be cast in sand casting processes. The size and weight of the parts are also critical for process
selection.

Material and manufacturing process compatibility. Since not all materials are suitable for all manufacturing
processes, the material itself will restrict the techniques that can be employed. For instance, steel cannot be
cast in plaster molding since plaster would be burnt at steel pouring temperatures.
Dimensional and tolerancing compatibility. Dimensional and geometric tolerances will limit the potential
selection of manufacturing processes. The capability of manufacturing processes has to match the quality

specifications of the parts, or if not, the global selection of primary and secondary processes should match.
The same applies to surface roughness specifications.

Economic factors. The production cost is highly dependent on the type of manufacturing process used. For
example, depending on the production volume, some manufacturing processes may be more cost‐effective
than others. Therefore, it is important to estimate manufacturing costs in advance to select the optimal
process. Key factors to consider include the required manufacturing volume, production rates, and economic
batch size.

3.4.2 Process Selection Method
Process selection requires the use of a process selection method to make the process more methodical and reduce
the complexity of this activity. The proposed process selection has been modified from (Scallan 2003) to help
practitioners comprehend the intricacies of the process while also giving them a methodical approach to follow.
When employing the presented methodology, the following two fundamental assumptions are made:
 
The material was chosen first, and it has been indicated at the design stage.
Every piece of information found in the design documents – parts lists, drawings, and other materials – is
complete, and interpreting the engineering drawings can yield all the information needed for production
(production volume, production rates, etc.).
There are six steps to follow in the proposed process selection method:
 
1. Drawing interpretation:
1. Identify material.
2. Identify geometry class.
3. List general quality characteristics (general tolerances and surface roughness).
4. List specific key product characteristics (specific features that require tighten tolerances or roughness
requirements).
5. List special features, that is, features that may require nonconventional operations (electrodischarge
machining operations, etc.).
6. List surface processes required, that is, heat treatments, coatings, etc.
2. Material and compatibility processes:
1. List the potential processes according to material and production volume.
3. Geometry and process compatibility:
1. Discard noncompatible processes due to geometry constraints.
4. Manufacturing processes technically feasible:
1. Reduce the previous list of potential processes by considering:

1. Geometry:
1. Size.
2. Weight.
3. Thickness.
2. Tolerances and surface roughness.
5. Manufacturing processes economically feasible:
1. Reduce the previous list of potential processes by considering:
1. EBQ.
6. Identifying a process:
1. From the remaining manufacturing process candidates, select the most economical one considering the
following features:
1. Operating costs.
2. Capital costs.
3. Tooling costs and tool life.
4. Secondary processes costs.
3.4.2.1 Drawing Interpretation
As specified in Chapter 2, the three‐dimensional (3D) model/drawing interpretation initiates process selection.
After identifying the material, the geometry of the part should be identified according to the geometry
classification shown in Figure 3.5. According to Ashby (1999), the following shapes can be distinguished:
prismatic‐circular (P‐C); prismatic noncircular (P‐NC); sheet‐flat (S‐F); sheet‐dished (S‐D); 3D solid (3D‐S), and
3D hollow (3D‐H).
Then, the drawing is analyzed to complete the report shown in Table 3.14. Information that should be included is
surface finish, dimensional and geometric tolerances, special features that require nontraditional manufacturing
methods, etc.

3.4.2.2 Material and Process Compatibility
Once the drawing has been analyzed, the next step is to study the compatibility between manufacturing processes
and materials. Although the information about materials applied in different manufacturing processes has been
reviewed above previously, a more straightforward view of material and process compatibility can be conducted
using Tables 3.15 and 3.16 if only casting/molding, bulk‐forming, and sheet‐forming processes are considered.
3.4.2.3 Geometry and Process Compatibility

From the previous list of candidate processes, the geometry of the product will constrain the potential use of a
specific manufacturing process. The geometry compatibility for each manufacturing process is shown in the tables
from Section 3.3; however, Table 3.17 can be used for a more straightforward selection of geometry and process
compatibility. The report shown in Table 3.18 can be used to discard the noncompatible processes and narrow the
list of candidates.
3.4.2.4 Manufacturing Processes Technically Feasible
Then, for the remaining list of manufacturing processes, the following critical factors are checked:

Tolerances (dimensional tolerances, geometric tolerances, and surface roughness).
The template shown in Table 3.19 can be used for this selection process. The tables in Section 3.3 provide the
information about the process capability in terms of weight, size, tolerances, surface roughness, etc.
3.4.2.5 Manufacturing Processes Economically Feasible
At this step, only technically feasible manufacturing processes are kept in the list of candidates to analyze their
economic feasibility. The item to be studied is the EBQ. Although the analysis of the economic feasibility of a
manufacturing process depends on many factors, an easy way for process selection at a very early stage is to
discard the processes that do not match their EBQ with the required production volume (Ashby 1999). Template
from Table 3.20 can be used at this step.

3.4.2.6 Identifying a Process
After previous steps, a unique manufacturing process candidate may have been reached. However, in many cases,
there are several manufacturing processes that can fulfill part specifications within the given constraints. To select
one of these process candidates based on the production volume, further economic analysis in terms of labor,
equipment, and tooling costs must be considered. By estimating these costs, a break‐even analysis can be
conducted to choose between different manufacturing processes (Figure 3.6).
Figure 3.6 Examples of break‐even analysis for different manufacturing processes applied to a specific part
design.
Source: Adapted from Ashby (1999).
Given a required batch quantity, n, and the manufacturing process costs (i.e., operating cost, capital cost, and
tooling cost), a general part cost estimation can be obtained as follows:
where a is the amortization of the machinery during the production volume. Table 3.21 shows material cost for
different alloys although this cost may be omitted for comparing different manufacturing processes if all compared
processes are net or near net processes.

It should be noted that, depending on the primary process selected, the number of secondary operations may
change. For instance, a more accurate casting process, such as investment casting with a manufacturing tolerance
of ±0.05 mm, will require fewer secondary machining operations than shell molding processes where
manufacturing tolerances are around ±0.2 mm. Therefore, for cost comparison, the secondary machining
operations should be roughly estimated at this stage to include them in the cost per part. A straightforward way for
early cost estimation of machining is to calculate the material volume to be removed, a general material removal
rate according to the workpiece material (Table 3.22 shows some reference values for conventional machining),
and the hourly rate. Hourly rates in machining may range from $60 to 90/hour for common machining operations.
Considering the cost from the above equation and estimating the cost of secondary processes, the template shown
in Table 3.23 can be filled to conduct a final process selection based on a rough cost estimation per unit.

3.4.3 Practical Example
Identify suitable manufacturing processes for the casing part shown in Figure 3.7.
a) Drawing interpretation
The material of the part is gray iron, and considering the geometry of the part in Figure 3.7, the most suitable
classification is prismatic circular (P‐C). The general dimensional tolerance is ±0.75 mm, and the general surface
specification is 12.5 μm. Lastly, the production volume is 3,000 units in 3 months.
Analyzing the critical product characteristics, Table 3.24 is completed.

b) Material and process compatibility
According to the material and process compatibility (Tables 3.15 and Table 3.16) and limiting the example to
casting processes, the following processes are potential candidates.
 
Sand casting.
Vacuum casting.
Shell molding.
Gravity die casting.
Centrifugal casting.
Investment casting.
Ceramic mold casting.
Full‐mold process.

c) Geometry and process compatibility
From the previous list, all candidates are adequate from the geometrical point of view of the part as shown in Table
3.25.
d) Manufacturing processes technically feasible
From the previous list, the process capability is analyzed, filling the technical information (Table 3.26). As a result,
there are six possible processes that could be used, and two processes – sand casting and full‐mold processes – are
discarded.
e) Manufacturing processes economically feasible
Considering the production volume and the EBQ, vacuum casting and ceramic mold casting are also discarded, as
shown in Table 3.27.
Therefore, shell molding, gravity die casting (less common in practice for this material), centrifugal casting and
investment casting are the final potential manufacturing processes for manufacturing the part.

f) Identifying a process
From the previous list of candidates, a detailed cost analysis is required to select the most adequate process since
four casting processes are technically and economically feasible. Ideally, process planners should consider the
main economic characteristics of the equipment that the facility would purchase or is already installed to conduct a
fair estimation of part manufacturing cost. In those cases, the operating cost, capital cost, and tooling cost may be
approximately known and the optimal process in terms of cost can be obtained. However, at the early stage of
product development, this specific information may not be available, and only ranges of common operating costs,
capital investment, and tooling costs are known. In these cases, a rough estimation of these terms of cost can be
obtained by selecting the operating cost, capital cost, and tooling cost proportional to the position of the production
volume with respect to the EBQ. The reasoning is that higher production volume usually means bigger machinery,
more complex and automatic tooling, and so on. Although this may not hold in all circumstances, the reasoning
may provide a rough estimate that can help in the final decision if a more detailed economic analysis is not
available. Based on this approach, Table 3.28 shows the ranges of production rate, operating cost, capital cost,
tooling cost, production rate, and tool life, and the proportional point within those ranges. For instance, gravity die
casting presents an EBQ range of 1,000–10,000, and the production volume for the case study is 3,000, Thus, the
operating point within the EBQ range is 22.2%. Using this proportion, the costs according to each range are:
operating cost $117.7/hour, capital cost $25,000, tooling cost $8,333, and tool life 30,000 units. Additionally, using
the same reasoning, the production rate is 15 units/hour. Assuming an amortization coefficient of 5% for all
processes, the rough estimation of cost per unit for gravity die casting is
Following the same procedure, Table 3.28 shows the final cost per unit for all the remaining candidates.

An additional calculation can be conducted here to check if the production volume can be produced within the
defined period of time stated in the drawing. In this case, given production of 3,000 parts in 3 months, and
assuming 1 month to conduct all process planning activities and production setup, the minimum production rate is
estimated as
where it is assumed 2 shifts and 5 working days per week, 2 months of production, 4 weeks/month, and 7 hours per
shift. Comparing with the expected production rates of all manufacturing process candidates, all of them can reach
the required production volume.

Furthermore, secondary processes are required for the key product characteristics that are not met through the
primary manufacturing processes. For this case study, according to dimensional and geometrical tolerances,
surface roughness, and part shape, the appropriate secondary processes could be the following:
 
Turning to produce
 
The Ø40H6 mm with 0.02 mm perpendicularity tolerance. To reach IT6, a boring operation is required.
The base and top surfaces of the part that requires a surface roughness of 0.1 μm and parallelism of 0.05 
mm, respectively. The base surface requires a subsequent grinding operation to reach that roughness
value.
Drilling to produce the 4 × Ø15 ± 0.1 mm and position tolerance of 0.15 mm.
Grinding to finish the base of the part that requires a surface roughness of 0.1 μm and 0.02 mm flatness.

Table 3.29 shows the additional cost due to these secondary operations assuming a 2‐mm machining allowance,
400‐cm3/min material removal rate, and an hourly rate of $90/hour. Note that the investment casting process can
reach the quality of the holes of Ø15, and thus, drilling is not necessary after this primary process.
According to these results, shell molding seems to be the most adequate process under the assumptions considered
in the example. This cost can be compared to a manufacturing process plan where the part is obtained only by
machining operations with a round bar as raw material. Assuming bar dimensions of Ø220 and 120‐mm in length,
the total cost per unit considering the material cost ($31.56), the removed material (2,608 cm3), the hourly rate
($90/hour), and the material removal rate (400 cm3/min) is $41.34. As it can be seen, for this case study the shell
molding process still seems to be the most appropriate process, with a cost per unit of $36.71.
3.5 Use of Software for Process Selection
Material and manufacturing process selection is a common problem in the development of a new product. The
previous methodology assumes that the material is already selected and shows different steps for the best
manufacturing process selection, for example, material and process compatibility, geometry compatibility,
technical and economic criteria, etc. The information provided above permit designers to select the best casting
and/or bulk‐forming processes, as well as machining processes in terms of geometrical quality and costs. However,
only basic casting and machining processes are considered, and there are many more primary and secondary
processes that could be considered as candidates for a given application.
To consider more processes and conduct a more friendly manufacturing process selection, there are some
commercial software systems available to assist designers in a complete search and selection. Examples of this
type of software are Ansys Granta Edupack® and DFM Concurrent Costing®, software systems that include a
large number of databases to correctly select both materials and processes and obtain an early cost estimation for
proper product development. Under this software, the user imposes limits on material, shape, mass, section,
tolerance, and so on. The result is a subset of processes that meet all the constraints, and then the economics are
investigated by considering the desired batch size on an economic batch size chart.
Figure 3.8 shows an example of the use of Ansys Granta Edupack for the process selection of the casing example
in Figure 3.7. In the first step, the user defines the characteristics of the part under study, such as material, shape,
mass, section, tolerance, and so on. The result is a subset of processes that meets all the constraints: the investment
casting and the shell molding process. In this case, centrifugal casting is not included in the software database, and
gravity die casting is restricted to nonferrous metals. From the resulting subset, the economics are then
investigated by putting the desired batch size on the economic batch size chart. Keeping the default parameters of
the cost models from the software, the range of costs for shell mold is lower than investment casting, a range of
$32–85/part with respect to $100–300/part.

Process‐Planning Documentation
4.1 Introduction
One of the main activities that process planners must conduct is the documenting and communicating of all the
steps needed to be conducted to produce a product. Process planners must define the sequence of manufacturing
processes, the equipment, the setups, process parameters, frequency of inspection, key product specifications to be
inspected, etc. All the information should be available at shop‐floor level for operators and technicians, and clear
and understandable documents should be provided for this purpose.
This chapter describes some common documents generated by process planners to clearly define the
manufacturing process plans. Although presented in this chapter, these documents are generated after detailing the
manufacturing processes to be used, equipment, setup procedures, parameters, etc. In the next chapters, detailed
information and guidelines are given to correctly fill in these documents when dealing with sand casting,
machining processes, and inspection processes.
4.2 Process Flow Charts
The process flow chart provides a high‐level graphical overview of the complete manufacturing process for a given
component or assembly. This chart utilizes five basic symbols to depict operations, transportation, inspection,
delays, and storage stages within the process.
 
⚫: Operation. The item is intentionally changed in one of its characteristics. Examples are milling a part,
bending a metal sheet, casting a part, cleaning a casting part, etc.
➔: Transportation. The item is moved from one place to another (except when the movement occurs as an
integral part of an operation or inspection). Examples are moving an item on a conveyor belt between
operations, moving a part from a machine tool to another, or to storage.
■: Inspection. The item at an inspection point is compared with the quality standard established for that point.
◗: Delay. The next planned action does not take place, causing a delay in the process.
▾: Storage. An item is stored in a place/warehouse until the item is withdrawn.

Figure 4.1 Example of flow process chart.
Unlike operation and routing sheets that generally show value‐added activities, the process flow chart also shows
the nonvalue‐added steps such as transportation and storage. Figure 4.1 illustrates a sample process flow chart. In
this sense, the process flow chart is an efficient tool for process improvement, and it is commonly used in
continuous process improvement activities.
4.3 Assembly Charts and Operation Process Charts
In the planning stages of developing a production system, the layouts of machines and the plant are not yet known.
One can only visualize, from parts and product designs, the operations that are necessary and the sequence in
which they must be performed. Assembly charts and operation process charts are the graphical representations of
such methods. An assembly chart gives a broad overview of how several parts manufactured separately are to be
assembled to make the final product. Figure 4.2 shows an example of an assembly chart of a bench vice where
“SA” refers to “subassembly” and “A” refers to “assembly.”

Figure 4.2 Example of assembly chart for a bench vice.
Source: Personat Martínez (2022).
On the other hand, the operation process chart essentially refers to the task of detailing the assembly chart,
showing every operation and inspection that each part needs as it progresses from raw material to the final
assembly. Figure 4.3 shows the operation process chart of the previous example, a bench vice (Personat Martínez
2022).
4.4 Routing Sheets
The routing sheet, also known as process sheet or process planning sheet, is a basic document of process planning
where it indicates the route that the raw material should follow along the production process, identifying the
required production equipment, times, special tooling, etc. The information that is commonly included in the
routing sheet is:
 
Information about the product manufactured, for example, name and number of the part.
Operations required to manufacture the product in the proper sequence.

Machinery and tooling required at each operation.
Setup, handling, operation, and cycle times.
Quality control activities.
The header of a routing sheet contains basic product or component part information. The routing sheet's primary
body lists the operation numbers in increments of 10 and describes the process. The department and equipment
involved are then identified to indicate where the material must go for processing and what production equipment
is required.
Figure 4.3 Example of operation process chart for a bench vice.
Source: Personat Martínez (2022).
To illustrate the information presented in a routing sheet, the casing part shown in Figure 4.4 is used as a part
example and the corresponding routing sheet is shown in Figure 4.5.
4.5 Operations Lists

The operations list or operations sheet includes a detailed description of all operations for all processes listed in the
routing sheet. This list guides the workers on the activities to be done at each operation, indicating specific
processing parameters, working instructions, etc. Unlike routing sheets that provide an overview of the production
process, operation sheets are focused on each specific operation within the process, giving a more detailed and
operative description.
The header of the operations list contains product/component part information whereas the main body of the
document contains the operation numbers considering the numeration done in the routing sheet. For instance, in
the routing sheet shown in Figure 4.5, casting the starting geometry is recorded as Operation number 10.
Following that, all operations mentioned in the operations list that are related to this process are listed in
increments of one prefixed by 10, that is, 11, 12, etc., as shown in Figure 4.6. It then provides a description of the
operation, the machine tool that will be utilized, the tooling that will be used, and the process parameters that are
appropriate for the operation. The final column is for comments to clarify any part of the procedure.
Figure 4.4 A casing part. Technical drawing.

Figure 4.5 Routing sheet for the example given (casing part).

Figure 4.6 Operations list for the example given.
Figure 4.7 Tooling list for the example given.
4.6 Tooling List
The operations list identifies the tooling to be used without including tooling details. To complete the information
related to the tooling needed at each operation, a tooling list (Figure 4.7) is used. The operation numbers on the
tooling sheet are related to those in the operations list.
4.7 CNC Programs
Computer numerical control (CNC) programs are required in most of the machine tools used in industry. Programs
should be elaborated and simulated using specific computer‐aided manufacturing (CAM) software to ensure no
collisions and proper cutting tool path trajectories. These programs include all the information given in the
operations list such as the type of cutting tools needed, fixturing, and cutting conditions (cutting speed, depth of
cuts, feed rates, etc.). Figure 4.8 shows an example of a CNC program and its simulation using specific software.

Figure 4.8 Example of CNC program under a simulation software.

Figure 4.9 Example of a work instructions sheet.
4.8 Work Instructions Sheet
A work instructions sheet contains additional information not found in operation or process sheets. These
instructions are specific to the duties that influence the equipment operator or personnel assigned to a certain
activity. Instructions may include procedures, pictures, a sequence of steps to follow during the operation, and
examples of poor quality or performance. Another critical component of work instruction is the specific procedures
that an operator must take in the event of nonconforming parts (Rufe 2013). Therefore, work instructions may
cover the following details:
 
Equipment setup instructions.
Equipment maintenance procedures.
Material handling standards.
Safety alerts for the employees.
Reaction strategies for nonconforming parts.
Any additional information.
A typical work instructions sheet is shown in Figure 4.9. The main columns indicate the operation description,
describing each step in the order of work, and the key points, which refer to the main aspects that the workers
should consider performing their work accurately, safely, conscientiously as well as quickly. As key points, the
instructions indicate how the procedures should be performed paying special attention to three conditions: (i) a
success/failure condition, something that controls if the work is defective; (ii) a safety condition, a behavior that
may cause injury during performing the work; (iii) a work easier condition, something that makes the work easier
and is reported to be followed by the worker.
4.9 Inspection Sheets and Reports

Inspection sheets contain step‐by‐step instructions for inspecting all the important quality characteristics of the
product/component. If specific quality data needs to be collected and recorded for product and process validation,
statistical process control (SPC), confirmation of safety conformance, or verification of government or regulatory
compliance, an inspection report may be necessary.
Although it may depend on the type of inspection report, the main information that an inspection sheet should
include is as listed in the following:
 
Identification of the specifications of the part to be inspected, usually using balloons on the technical drawing.
Identification of the type of measurement instrument used.
Measurement uncertainty and conformity zones.
Frequency of inspection and number of samples inspected.
A field to add any observation that the operator may want to document.
One important report about the inspection is the so‐called first article inspection (FAI) report (SAE AS9102 2000).
FAI report allows suppliers to formally report measurements of the initial part manufactured in cooperation with a
customer who reviews and approves it. Customers expect verification of a project's specifications, and
manufacturer's need to document their work to set the standard for production runs. Therefore, the FAI report is
documentation that proves a product has been manufactured to the required specifications. Note that FAI is a
requirement in the aerospace and defense industry and other industries (e.g., automotive industry) use similar
procedures for product and process validation. Figure 4.10 shows an example of an inspection report that is part of
a more extended FAI report.

Process Planning in Casting

Fundamentals of Casting
5.1 Introduction
Foundries produce castings, often known as near‐net shape components, that are very similar to the shape of the
finished product. Molten metal is poured into molds to form castings, with cores used to make hollow internal
portions. The casting is extracted from the mold once the metal has cooled sufficiently and is then subjected to the
required cleaning and finishing operations.
Today, metal casting parts are manufactured at a worldwide level. Figure 5.1 gives a snapshot of the global metal
casting market in 2019, with China, India, and the United States being the most important countries in the
production of metal castings. In the automobile industry, for instance, many components are manufactured using
manufacturing casting processes (Figure 5.2).
If continuous casting is overlooked (almost any steel component is manufactured from a billet initially generated
from continuous casting), approximately 90% of the metal castings in the world are manufactured by sand‐casting
(Black and Kohser 2020, Chapter 12). It is an important manufacturing technique for the manufacturing of
automotive and heavy machinery components. Therefore, the importance of sand casting is evident, and process‐
planning activities related to casting may often include sand‐casting processes.
This chapter reviews the fundamentals of sand casting, with special attention to the solidification process, which is,
indeed, the key factor in achieving good casting parts. This chapter presents the basics that are later applied in the
next chapter, where process planning in sand casting is covered in detail.
5.2 Sand Casting
This ancient method is used to cast metals in sand molds. The steps involved in sand casting are shown in Figure
5.3 and are listed in the following: (i) pattern and mold design; (ii) mold construction (imprinting a pattern and
gating system in the sand); (iii) pouring molten metal into the mold cavity; (iv) permitting the metal to cool until it
solidifies; (v) separating the sand mold; (vi) cleaning and finishing; and (vii) casting inspection.

Figure 5.3 Outline of production steps in a typical sand‐casting process.
The following are the main parts of a sand‐casting mold (Figure 5.4):
 
Flask. The flask holds the mold in place and is divided into two parts – the cope and the drag. The parting line
separates the cope on top and the drag on bottom.
Pouring basin. The pouring basin is the top area of the mold where the molten metal is poured.
Sprue. The sprue is a vertical passage through which the molten metal is introduced into the runner system for
filling the mold cavity. At the bottom part of the sprue, a sprue well is added to retain impurities.
Runner system. The runner system is a horizontal passage that transfers the molten metal from the sprue to
the mold cavity through channels.
Gates. Gates are the part of the runner system that connects to the mold cavity.
Risers. Risers are deposits of molten metal that supply material as the casting solidifies and shrinks.
Cores. Cores are used to avoid molten metal filling specific zones of the cavity to create internal surfaces in
the casting. Cores are made of sand and are later removed during cleaning operations.
Vents. Vents are placed within molds to expel the gases produced as the molten metal fills the mold.

Figure 5.4 Features of sand‐casting molds. Cross‐section of typical sand‐casting mold.
5.3 Heating the Metal
Different types of heating furnaces may be used to heat the metal to the molten temperature that is appropriate for
casting. The heat required to melt the material, the heat of fusion needed to transform it into a liquid, and the heat
needed to raise the molten metal's temperature to the right pouring temperature are all included in the total heat
energy required. This can be expressed as (Groover 2007) follows:
where H is the total heat required to raise the temperature of the metal to the pouring temperature; ρ is the density
of the metal; Cs is the specific heat for the solid metal; Tm is the melting temperature of the metal; T0 is the starting
temperature – usually room temperature; Hf is the heat of fusion; Cl is the specific heat of the liquid metal; Tp is
the pouring temperature; and V is the volume of metal being heated. Some values of these thermophysical
properties for different alloys are shown in Table 5.1. The specific heat at the liquid state of metal alloys is
generally not provided in technical publications, but it usually tends to be higher compared to the solid state,
around 20–40% higher, according to the values reported in Table 5.1.
It should be noted that the previous equation has limited application and is mainly used for academic purposes.
Heat loss during the heating process, variations of the specific heat with temperature, change of solid to liquid state
within a temperature range for most alloys, unknown specific heat at liquid state, etc., make accurate estimation of
the heat needed at heating furnaces difficult (Groover 2007).
5.4 Pouring the Molten Metal

5.4.1 Flow Velocity and Reynolds Number
After heating, the metal is ready to be poured. A crucial step in the casting process is introducing the molten metal
into the mold. The metal must flow into every area of the mold before it solidifies without eroding the mold cavity
or generating gases and oxides. Pouring temperature, pouring rate, and fluid flow are the main three factors that
affect the quality of the pouring process.

The temperature of the molten metal when it is poured into the mold is known as the pouring temperature. The
volumetric rate at which the molten metal is poured into the mold is referred to as the pouring rate. Both pouring
temperature and pouring rate are crucial parameters to avoid an incomplete filling of the mold cavity or flow
turbulences. In the first case, the metal will cool and freeze before filling the cavity if the rate is too slow or the
temperature is too low. In the second case, turbulence may arise if the pouring rate is too high. As opposed to
laminar flow, which is a smooth and streamlined flow, turbulent flow results in an agitated and uneven flow.
Turbulence generates metal oxides that may get stuck during solidification and lower the casting's quality.
Furthermore, mold erosion is increased and may become a problem. For these reasons, turbulent flow should be
avoided during pouring.
The Reynolds number, Re, is used to quantify this aspect of the fluid flow, representing the ratio of the inertia to
the viscous forces in the fluid flow. The Reynolds number is defined as (Kalpakjian and Schmid 2009) follows:
where v is the velocity of the liquid, D is the diameter of the channel, and ρ and η are the density and viscosity of
the liquid, respectively. For noncircular channels, D is the equivalent diameter defined as 4S/P (Murdock 1993,
Chapter 4), where S is the cross‐section of the channel and P is the perimeter. Representative values of density and
viscosity of liquid elements and alloys are reported in Table 5.2.
The likelihood of a turbulent flow increases with Reynolds number. Re values in typical feed casting systems
range from 2,000 to 20,000. Laminar flow is represented by a number of up to 2,000; a blend of laminar and
turbulent flow is represented by a value between 2,000 and 20,000. In the feed systems, this kind of mixture is
typically regarded as harmless. Re values above 20,000, on the contrary, indicate extreme turbulence in lost mold
operations (sand casting, shell casting, etc.), which causes trapped air and the creation of slag (an oxide layer on
the surface of molten metal) as a result of the reaction between the liquid metal and other gases and air (Kalpakjian
and Schmid 2009, Chapter 10). In some technical publications, the Re values are limited according to the region of

the flow rate analyzed within the casting mold and the material poured. For instance, Re values in aluminum sand
casting are limited to 7,000 for sprues, 1,100 for gates, and 780 for mold cavities (Zych et al. 2014).

To estimate the velocity of the liquid during pouring, Bernoulli's theorem should be considered. This theorem
establishes that the sum of the energies (head, pressure, kinetic, and friction) at any two places in a moving liquid
is equal. This statement can be written in the following form (Beddoes and Bibby 1999, Chapter 2):
where h is the height, P is the pressure in the liquid, ρ is the density of the molten metal, v is the velocity of the
liquid, g is the constant of gravitational acceleration, and F is the load losses due to friction. Subscripts 1 and 2
indicate any two points in the flow of the liquid.
There are several ways to simplify the Bernoulli equation. If the system is assumed to be at atmospheric pressure
throughout, and friction losses are disregarded (friction will, of course, alter the liquid flow through a sand mold),
the equation can be simplified to
The initial speed of the molten metal at the base of the pouring sprue can be calculated using this expression.

Figure 5.5 Filling process of a mold cavity in sand casting.
Molten metal is poured into the pouring basin at point 1, and the molten metal enters into the runner system at
point 2, see Figure 5.5. If point 2 is used as a reference, then h1 is the height of the cope, and point 2's height is
zero. The metal's initial velocity at the top is zero when it is poured into the pouring cup and flows downward.
Then, the equation becomes simplified to
which can be reordered to express the flow velocity as
Therefore, the molten metal flows along the runner with the v2 velocity. The volumetric flow rate is equal to the
flow velocity multiplied by the cross‐sectional area of the runner. Thus, the volumetric flow rate at the runner is
where A2 is the cross‐sectional area of the runner. According to the continuity law, which states that the volume
rate of flow remains constant throughout the liquid, the flow velocity at the gate is obtained as
where Ag and vg refer to the cross‐sectional area and the flow velocity at the gate, respectively. The Reynolds value
of the flow velocity at the gate should be checked as indicated previously to avoid turbulent flow.
5.4.2 Filling Time
Given the volumetric flow rate, the time of filling the cavity can be roughly estimated as

where Vc is the volume of the mold cavity to be filled. However, as the mold starts to be filled above the parting
plane, the molten metal speed at the gate decreases since this point is not under atmospheric pressure anymore.
Thus, the previous equation underestimates the actual filling time. At point 3 (see Figure 5.5), the speed at the gate
of the mold is calculated as
Therefore, a more approximate calculation of filling time is obtained as
where tfB is the filling time of the mold cavity below the parting plane, which can be calculated by the previous
equation using Vc as the cavity volume below the parting plane, and tfA is the filling time of the cavity above the
parting plane, which is estimated as (Ghosh and Mallik 1986) follows:
where Am and hm is the cross‐sectional area and height of the mold cavity, respectively (Figure 5.5). For not
straight geometries, an approximate filling time can be obtained by using the projected area and the equivalent
height for Am and hm, respectively.
5.4.3 Ceramic Filters
To prevent slag, oxides, and impurities from entering the cavity, ceramic filters may be used (Figure 5.6). Filters
are most effective when placed in the gating system as close to the casting as possible (Chastain 2004, Chapter 5).
Especially in the fields of small‐ and medium‐sized castings such as automobiles, high‐speed railways, machine
tools, and hydraulic parts, the purification effect of the filter has been generally recognized by the majority of
foundry practitioners, and the method of use has become increasingly mature.
5.5 Solidification and Cooling
5.5.1 Solidification Time
The time needed for the casting to harden after pouring is known as the solidification time. Chvorinov's rule – an
empirical expression that indicates that the solidification time depends on the casting's size and shape – is usually
applied for time estimation, and it is defined as (Groover 2007) follows:

Figure 5.6 Example of ceramic filter and placement in a sand‐casting mold.
where Ts is the total solidification time, V is the volume of the casting, A is the surface area of the casting, n is an
exponent (n usually has a value of 2 in most sand‐casting processes), and Cm is affected by the specifics of the
casting process, such as the properties of the mold material (e.g., thermal conductivity), the thermal characteristics
of the cast metal (e.g., the heat of fusion, specific heat, or thermal conductivity), and the pouring temperature in
relation to the metal's melting point. The Cm coefficient can be estimated as (Jelinek and Elbel 2010; Marathe and
Quadros 2021) follows:
where Tm is the melting temperature (°C), T0 the initial mold temperature (°C), ρm the density of the mold (kg/m3),
Ch the specific heat of the mold (J/kg·K), km the thermal conductivity of the mold (W/m·K), ρc the density of the
casting metal (kg/m3) and Hf the latent heat of fusion of the casting metal (kJ/kg). Chvorinov's rule predicts that
cast iron will cool and solidify more slowly if the ratio of its volume to surface area is higher. This idea is useful in
both the riser and the mold's design as is shown in detail in Chapter 6.
For estimating the total time for solidification and cooling, the Cm parameter can be modified as shown in the
following equation:
where Cs is the specific heat of the casting metal at its solid state, and Tb is the temperature at which the cooling
ends, that is, the temperature of mold breakage. For sand‐casting processes, the following data can be used related
to sand molds: ρm = 1,500 kg/m3, Ch = 1,029 J/kg·K, and km = 0.6 W/m·K.
5.5.2 Shrinkage
Three stages of shrinkage take place in a casting process (Groover 2007): liquid contraction during cooling before
solidification, solidification shrinkage during the transition from liquid to solid, and thermal contraction of the
solidified casting during cooling to ambient temperature. Figure 5.7, which depicts a cylindrical casting formed in

an open mold, can be used to describe the three steps. Picture 1 of Figure 5.7 displays the molten metal right after
pouring. The liquid metal contracts as it cools from pouring temperature to freezing temperature, lowering the
liquid's height from its starting point. This liquid contraction is usually around 0.5% in most metals. At this point,
the solidification shrinkage begins (picture 2 of Figure 5.7). Two effects result from solidification shrinkage. First,
the height of the casting decreases as a result of contraction. Second, the amount of liquid metal used to feed the
casting's center region is limited because this is typically the last area to freeze. As shown in the example, the
solidification (nucleation) starts at the walls and ends in the center of the part. The absence of metal after shrinking
leaves a hole in the casting, which is commonly named as a pipe by foundrymen. After solidification (picture 3 of
Figure 5.7), the solid part cools from the solidification temperature to room temperature, producing an additional
shrinkage (picture 4 of Figure 5.7). Common shrinkage coefficients can be found in Table 5.3, denoting α, β, and γ
as the shrinkage coefficients during liquid contraction, solidification shrinkage, and solid contraction, respectively.
Figure 5.7 Cylindrical casting shrinkage during solidification and cooling: (1) starting level of molten metal
immediately after pouring; (2) liquid contraction during cooling; (3) height reduction and pipe generation due to
solidification shrinkage; and (4) thermal contraction during cooling of the solid metal.

5.5.3 Directional Solidification
As a good casting practice, the areas of the casting farthest from the liquid metal supply have to freeze first. From
these areas, the solidification of the part should continue toward the riser(s) to limit the harmful effects of
shrinkage. This will ensure that molten metal is always accessible from the risers, preventing shrinkage voids (i.e.,
pipes) during freezing. This strategy is called directional solidification, and it is commonly applied in the sand‐
casting mold design. By applying Chvorinov's rule in the design of the casting itself, a good directional
solidification can be obtained. For instance, by placing parts of the casting with lower V/A ratios away from the
riser, freezing will happen first in these areas, and the supply of liquid metal for the rest of the casting will remain
open until the bulkier parts freeze (Groover 2007).
Figure 5.8 (Left top) External chill and (left bottom) internal chill to promote rapid freezing and likely defects if
chills are not used. (Right) Examples of proper placement of chillers in castings.
The use of chills – internal or external heat sinks that quickly cause the freezing of some areas of the casting – is
another method for promoting directional solidification. Small metal components called internal chills are inserted
into the cavity before pouring, so the molten metal will solidify first around these components. Making the internal
chill from the same metal as the casting itself will make it easier to obtain the desired chemical similarity between
the internal chill and the metal being poured.
External chills are metal inserts in the mold cavity's walls that can quickly remove heat from the liquid metal to
accelerate solidification. They are frequently employed successfully in areas of the casting where feeding liquid
metal is challenging, promoting quick freezing in these areas. In contrast, the link to liquid metal is still open.
Well‐designed chills can locally reduce the modulus of the area where they are placed by up to 50%, significantly

reducing the solidification time (Rio Tinto 2000). Refer to Chapter 6 for the concept of modulus in sand‐casting
molds.
Figure 5.8 illustrates a possible application of external and internal chills and the likely result in the casting if
chills were not used. On a circular casting, a properly placed chill at the furthest point from the riser will promote
directional solidification. The use of chills at specific locations can control the sequential solidification of castings
and increase the feeding distance of the riser (Chastain 2004, Chapter 6).
5.6 Casting Quality
There are some flaws that all casting techniques share. The following is a description of the most typical flaws in
casting processes (Rao 2007, Chapter 7):
 
Incomplete casting. This defect results when an inadequate metal volume is poured or when the mold cavity
is not properly filled due to misruns (caused by early solidification) or runouts (resulting from metal being
lost from the mold after pouring).
Hot tearing. Sometimes referred to as hot cracking, hot tearing occurs when the casting cannot shrink due to a
hard mold during the latter phases of solidification or the first cooling phase following solidification.
Cold shuts. This defect is generated when two molten metal flows merged in the cavity are not properly fused
together due to premature freezing.
Pipes or shrinkage cavities. This defect is caused by solidification shrinkage and results in interior voids in
the casting that may result in mechanical weakness.
Surface depressions. Similar to pipes, surface depressions occur by solidification shrinkage, but instead of
internal voids, the defects appear at the superficial level in the form of depressions.
Microporosity. This defect is presented in the form of a network of tiny spaces locally dispersed and is caused
by a localized solidification shrinkage of the final liquid metal in the dendritic structure of the casting.
Additionally, some of the following flaws are exclusive to sand castings since they are caused by the usage of sand
molds:
 
Sand blow is a flaw that appears as a balloon‐shaped gas cavity and is brought on by the release of mold gases
during the pouring process.
Penetration is a surface flaw that develops when a liquid metal has high fluidity and permeates the sand mold
or sand core. As a result, the casting surface is made up of a combination of metal and sand grains.
Mold shift describes flaws brought on by the relative displacement of the cope and drag in a mold, which
causes a step to appear at the separating line in the cast product.
Core shift is comparable to mold shift, but it involves the movement of the core.
Mold crack happens when the mold's strength is insufficient, causing a crack that can allow the liquid metal to
enter.
5.7 Cleaning Operations
After the casting hardens and is removed from the mold, a few more steps are usually required. These procedures
consist of trimming, removing the core, cleaning the surface, inspecting, and, if necessary, heat treating. All these
operations in foundry facilities are typically referred to as cleaning operations.
Trimming is the process of removing superfluous metal from the cast item, including sprues, runners, risers,
parting‐line flash, chaplets, etc. The removal of any cores that were used in the part's casting is also conducted as
cleaning operations. They can occasionally be eliminated by mechanically or manually shaking the casting using a
hammer or press.
During surface cleaning, sand is removed from the casting's surface. The surface can be cleaned by wire brushing,
chemical pickling, tumble drying, and airblasting with a metal shot or coarse sand grit.

Castings may include flaws, and inspection is necessary to find them. After inspection, castings are frequently
heat‐treated to improve their mechanical properties and reduce internal tensions.

Process Planning in Sand Casting
6.1 Introduction
Figure 6.1 shows a representation of a standard sand‐casting mold. This mold is enclosed within a two‐part flask:
the upper part referred to as the cope, and the lower part known as the drag. The interface between the cope and
drag is termed the parting plane, which can also be referred to as the parting line when observing the casting in a
two‐dimensional context.
The vertical pathway through which molten metal is introduced into the casting is named as the sprue. Within the
parting plane, there are horizontal passages known as runners, responsible for distributing the molten metal. The
linkages connecting these runners to the cavities in the casting are named as gates or ingates. Additional
components of the casting, strategically placed to supply molten metal as the casting solidifies and contracts, are
termed risers or feeders. Occasionally, metal fragments are positioned within the mold to accelerate solidification
at specific points; these fragments are referred to as chills.
The process of designing the casting mold initiates with the identification of the parting plane. Subsequently,
determining the optimal gate placements to ensure even distribution during casting follows. Once gate locations
are established, an appropriate design for the runner system and sprue is chosen. The cavity dimensions are defined
considering the part's geometry and employing basic design principles. Shrinkage, machining allowance, and
drafts are taken into account at this step. Often, multiple iterations of mold designs are necessary before achieving
a successful and defect‐free casting.
This chapter presents general guidelines extracted from different references (Beddoes and Bibby 1999; Chastain
2004; Guleyupoglu 1998; Rao 2006) that process planners can follow for a proper design of sand‐casting molds.
Figure 6.1 Parts of a generic sand‐casting mold.
6.2 Mold‐Making Guidelines
6.2.1 Part Orientation Rules
Typically, the casting design decision that needs to be decided first is the part orientation. The part orientation will
define the orientation of the cavity with respect to the gravity action and will determine the dimensions of the

mold. The rules to define part orientation are:
 
1. Minimize the height of the casting.
2. Place open spaces down.
3. Place the casting such that top risers can be placed on high points on the casting for the heavy sections.
6.2.2 Parting Plane Rules
The parting plane depends on the geometry of the part to be cast and will define both pattern and mold geometry.
Some guidelines for parting plane definition are explained in Section 6.3 Pattern Fabrication Guidelines.
6.2.3 Gating System
The gating system is usually referred to as the system composed of the sprue, the runner, and the gate. The
guidelines for designing these three components in a sand‐casting mold are reviewed as follows.
6.2.3.1 Sprue Rules
The sprue goes from the pouring basin to the runner system, where the molten metal is distributed to reach the
cavity. A proper sprue design is of great importance to prevent turbulence during filling. Some standard guidelines
employed in the design of sprues are shown in the following:
 
The minimum height of the sprue is defined by the casting itself and the height of the top riser.
The dimensions of the sprue should be calculated to avoid turbulence at the runner system. Oversized sprues
may result in elevated flow rates, contributing to turbulent flow.
Rectangular cross‐section sprues are preferable compared to circular ones of the equivalent cross‐sectional
area due to the lower critical velocity for inducing turbulence. Additionally, circular cross‐section sprues tend
to be more prone to forming vortices. However, small round sprues with limited height and radius pose
minimal vortex‐related problems, are simpler to create, and hence, prove more cost‐effective for smaller
castings.
Figure 6.2 Sprue well and pouring basin design.

Source: Beddoes and Bibby (1999) and Chastain (2004).
The sprue should direct the molten metal into a standardized well area to diminish the kinetic energy of the
metal. The well's top area is usually recommended to be five times that of the sprue exit area, while the well's
depth is twice that of the runner depth (Figure 6.2).
The ideal placement for the sprue is as distant as feasible from the gates. This is mainly explained by the
common generation of turbulent flow at the end of the sprue. To avoid or minimize its effect, an elongated
path to the gate and the inclusion of a filter at the sprue base is recommended.
A minimum taper of about 5% should be applied to the sprues to prevent air aspiration and uncontrolled
descent of the metal (Figure 6.2). Slightly exceeding the required taper for the sprues offers an additional
margin of safety against air aspiration. The theoretical relationship between the sprue top area (A2), the sprue
base area (A3), the pouring basin height (hc), and the total sprue height (ht) to avoid air aspiration is (Beddoes
and Bibby 1999) as follows:
6.2.3.2 Runner Rules
Runners serve as passageways that transport molten metal from the sprue well to the gates, facilitating the entry of
metal into the mold cavity. The established principles applied to the design of runners are:
 
1. Employ standardized dimensions and configurations for runners.
2. In sand castings, rectangular cross‐sectional profiles are recommended.
3. Steering clear of abrupt alterations in the runner direction is advisable. If the directional shift exceeds
approximately 15°, filleting is required at the junction.
4. For elongated parts, runners traverse along the component where different gates are placed. It is considered
sound practice to progressively reduce the runner's cross‐sectional area after it passes through each gate,
adjusting for the gate area (Figure 6.3). This practice generates a balanced gating system that ensures a
consistent metal velocity at every entry point into the mold cavity.
5. Extensions, also known as blind ends, are commonly incorporated into runners to trap the first part of the
molten metal flow that tends to concentrate impurities and oxides.
6. The area of the runner is maintained at three to ten times the cross‐sectional area of the sprue exit, as
prescribed by the gating ratio (see Section 6.2.3.3).

Figure 6.3 Balanced gating system.
Source: Adapted from Chastain (2004).
6.2.3.3 Gate Rules
Gates serve as pathways connecting runners to the mold cavity that reproduces the part. The subsequent guidelines
for gate design are commonly applied:
 
1. Direct the gate toward thicker sections.
2. Adopt standardized configurations and dimensions for gates. Rectangular gates are the most prevalent choice.
3. Position gates strategically to minimize disturbance and prevent erosion of the sand mold due to the flow of
molten metal.
4. Keep the appropriate gating ratio. Appropriate ratios among the cross‐sectional areas of the sprue, runners,
and gates should be kept to achieve optimal filling conditions. Some examples of common gating ratios are
provided in Table 6.1. For instance, if a 4:3:2 ratio is adopted, the combined area of the runners should be
three‐fourths the area of the sprue base, while the collective area of the gates should be two‐thirds the area of
the runners.
5. The incorporation of fillets between the gates and the casting is beneficial.
6. Unless the casting is of a small and simple nature, multiple gates should be utilized to evenly distribute metal
throughout the mold. This approach facilitates quicker filling, reduces the risk of hot spots, and offers the
advantage of lower pouring temperatures, which enhances the metallurgical structure and mitigates
temperature gradients within the casting.

7. A gate length of 10–20 mm is generally adequate for small castings while 30–60 mm is common in
medium/large castings.
8. For rectangular cross‐section gates, the width‐to‐thickness ratio is usually around 3–6 to avoid junction hot
spots. Furthermore, the thickness is related to the adjacent wall thickness of the casting and should be less
than 0.5–0.8 times this thickness.
6.2.3.4 Steps for Gating System Design
The first step in designing a gating system is to determine the casting weight. From here it can be determined the
optimal pouring rate. Optimal pouring rates depend on several factors that include the type of alloy, the fluidity of
the metal, the pouring temperature, and the weight of the casting. In the study by Chastain (2004), it is shown how
to obtain the pouring rate for casting iron, aluminum, brass, and bronze. As a rough guide, Table 6.2 from the study
by Rao (2006) shows typical pouring rates for different materials and casting weights.
After determining the pouring rate, the pouring time or filling time of the mold is calculated by dividing the
casting weight (W) by the pouring rate (Pr):
Then, the area of the sprue base is calculated. For this purpose, the effective sprue height H according to the
placement of the pattern in the mold is obtained as follows:
where h is the height of the sprue, c is the total height of the mold cavity and p is the height of the mold cavity in
the cope (Figure 6.4). Next, the area of the sprue base is calculated as follows:
where ρ is the density of the molten metal and d is the discharge coefficient for the sprue (0.88 for round tapered,
0.47 for round straight sprue, 0.74 for squared tapered sprue).
Finally, using the adequate gating ratio (Table 6.1), the cross‐sectional areas of the runner and gates are calculated.

6.2.3.5 Practical Example
Figure 6.5a show an aluminum part and Figure 6.5b shows the resulting casting from a sand‐casting process. The
mold design has two cavities, a sprue height of 91 mm, and a pouring basin height of 20 mm. For each cavity, a
cylindrical riser of 60‐mm height and 60‐mm diameter is designed. For this mold, it is desired to evaluate the main

dimensions of the sprue, runner, and gates. The weight of each part after casting and trimming is 1 kg whereas the
weight of each riser is 0.46 kg.
The weight of the casting (without considering runners and sprue) is (1.46) × 2 = 2.92 kg. Thus, from Table 6.2 the
proper pouring rate is 0.3 kg/s. The pouring time is
The effective sprue height is
Thus, the area of the sprue base is
where c is 0.88 (sprue round tapered) and the density of molten aluminum is 2.375·10–6 kg/mm3. The diameter at
the sprue base is 11.8 ≈ 11.5 mm (As = 103.9 mm2).
To calculate runner area and dimensions, the gating ratio 1:3:3 is used (Table 6.1). Then, the runner area is
Assuming a rectangular cross‐section, the runner dimensions would be approximately 25 × 12.5 mm if an aspect
ratio of 2 (the width‐to‐height ratio) is considered. The gates area, since there are two cavities, is 0.5 × 311.6 =
155.8 mm2 per gate and the dimensions of each one are approximately 21 × 7 mm if a width‐to‐thickness ratio of 3
is applied. The length of the gate is set to 10 mm.
The area of the sprue well is 5 times the area of the sprue base, so the diameter of the sprue well is
The well depth is 2 times the runner depth, so 2 × 12.5 = 25 mm.
Finally, the area at the top of the sprue, considering the pouring basin height of 20 mm, is
Then, the sprue top diameter is around 17 mm.
6.2.4 Riser's Rules
Risers are molten metal reservoirs used to feed the casting when it solidifies. If more molten metal cannot be fed to
a mold cavity region, the shrinkage that occurs during solidification results in voids. Risers are intended to remove
casting voids caused by shrinkage and for this purpose, they should solidify last. Risers also function as pressure
heads to feed thin portions and as exits for gases and dross trapped in the metal. Typical riser designs are top risers
and side risers depending on where the riser is placed, and open risers and blind risers if they are opened to the
atmosphere or not. Figure 6.6 shows some examples of different riser designs.

Figure 6.6 Top risers, side risers, blind and open risers.

Figure 6.7 Correct and incorrect riser's locations and channel dimensions.
The general rules for riser design are:
 
1. Risers are situated close to areas of the casting that are thick (Figure 6.7).
2. Riser and casting connections must be designed to avoid early freezing (Figure 6.7). Thin and long channels
will freeze before the heavy section has entirely solidified.
3. Side risers are usually placed close to the gates. Thin‐walled castings commonly employ side risers.
4. If bosses are present away from the gates, top risers can be used to minimize shrinkage problems.
5. Open risers are simpler to produce, remove, and clean up after manufacturing than blind risers.
6. To ensure that the region fed by the riser solidifies earlier, risers should have higher volume to area ratios than
the region fed. According to Chvorinov's rule, the riser should ensure:

where the volume to area ratios of the cavity refers to the region fed by the riser, and the volume to
area ratios of the riser depends on the riser geometry defined by the process planner that should
ensure the above inequation. The terms Mr and Mc are named as riser modulus and cavity modulus,
respectively. To ensure that the region fed solidifies before the riser, a safety coefficient of 1.2 is
usually adopted. Therefore, defining the Mr value as 1.2 times the Mc value of the region where a
riser is going to be placed, a straightforward riser design for specific riser geometries can be done
according to Table 6.3.
7. The ideal riser shape is a sphere because of its high volume‐to‐area ratio, however, working with spherical
risers is challenging. Since they have the second‐best volume‐to‐area ratio, round cylinders are widely
employed as risers. Practical foundry experience has demonstrated that under this shape, height values of 1.5
times its diameter maximize feeding while using the least quantity of metal (Kaushish 2010, Chapter 5).

8. The connection of risers with the cavity, named the neck risers, needs special attention. If the neck is too
small, it freezes off and cannot supply feed metal to the casting. If it is too large, it becomes difficult to
remove. Figure 6.8 shows some recommendations from sand‐casting manuals (Chastain 2004; Wang et al.
2010).

6.2.4.1 Practical Example
The 3D model given in Figure 6.9 represents a support that is going to be produced by sand casting. The gate is
placed in Section 1 (the thicker region of the part), and to analyze the riser design, the casting is divided into three
sections where the modulus (V/A) of each section is given in Table 6.4.
According to Table 6.4, the middle section of the part presents the lower modulus value, which means that it will
solidify earlier. Therefore, both sides of the part remain disconnected from the molted metal that enters from the
runner system into Section 1. To avoid pipe shrinkages on both sides of the part, two risers are needed to provide
molten metal to both sides while solidification is produced. Another possibility would be to add a chiller to force
that Section 3 solidifies earlier than Section 2. Under this situation, only one riser at Section 1 would be needed
since a directional solidification would occur. Assuming the use of two risers, each one is designed to have a
modulus higher than 1.2 times the modulus of the section that it feeds. Therefore, the designs of the two top risers
are as listed as follows:

Riser 1. Mr > 1.2 × 9.53 = 11.43. Assuming a cylindrical riser with a height 1.5 times the diameter, the riser
modulus is
Thus, the diameter and height of the cylindrical riser are
The maximum value of the riser neck is d/2. Considering a value of d/6, the neck is 61/6 ≈ 10 mm,
and the neck diameter is = 10 + 0.2 × 61 ≈ 22 mm.
Riser 2. Mr > 1.2 × 7.34 = 8.8. Assuming the same height‐to‐diameter ratio, the dimensions of the riser are
The maximum value of the riser neck is d/2. Considering a value of d/6, the neck is 47/6 ≈ 8 mm, and the neck
diameter is = 8 + 0.2 × 47 ≈ 17 mm.
As a result, the cast part with the two risers is shown in Figure 6.10. Figure 6.11a shows the result of the casting
process with, and Figure 6.11b shows the result of the casting process without, the addition of the risers. As it can
be seen, the risers avoid pipe shrinkages and porosities on both sides of the part.

porosity, improving part quality.
6.3 Pattern Fabrication Guidelines
In the process of designing and crafting a pattern, many aspects should be defined such as follows:
 
Determining the optimal location for the parting line to facilitate foundry operations.
Selecting the methods to achieve the specified external and internal shape of the casting most effectively (e.g.,
core design, geometry simplification for pattern design, etc.).
Determining the flow of molten metal during filling for correct pattern and core design (e.g., mold erosion,
core stability, etc.).
Determining how the casting will contract as it solidifies and cools to room temperature to set shrinkage
allowances.
Deciding where and to what extent draft angles should be applied.
Identifying the locations and amounts of extra material needed for machining.

Selecting the appropriate pattern type, material, and fabrication process.
As shown in Figure 6.12, sand‐casting tool fabrication usually requires a 3D computer‐aided design (CAD) model
to conduct casting simulations and iterate different patterns and core designs. When casting analysis results in
adequate casting quality, the fabrication of the pattern is conducted by computer numerical control (CNC)
machining or additive manufacturing if low‐volume production or rapid fabrication applies. Ultimately, the choice
of pattern fabrication method hinges on a delicate balance between lead time, cost, production volume, and
precision.
The following guidelines can be used for a correct pattern fabrication process.
Figure 6.12 Tool fabrication process for sand casting.
6.3.1 Geometry Simplification
Sand casting cannot produce very small holes or fine details on casting surfaces. In these circumstances, it is
preferable to streamline the casting process by removing such elements and incorporating them into secondary
operations such as turning, milling, or drilling. Additional geometric simplifications depend on the level of
accuracy required, the casting process capabilities, and the mold construction technique used. Figure 6.13 shows

an example of geometric simplification of a casting part. Note that the internal hole of Ø16 mm and the slots are
fine details that need machining (Figure 6.13b) while the casting (Figure 6.13a) quality is enough for the rest of the
geometry.
In relation to hole simplification, it should be noted that small holes are more economical to be produced by
machining than by creating and using a core in the mold cavity. The minimum recommended hole that can be
produced by cores in casting depends on the metal cast, the casting process, the thickness of the section where the
hole is located, and the length of the hole. In gray irons by sand‐casting processes, holes below 8 mm are difficult
to produce; in aluminum die‐cast parts, the minimum hole to be cast is usually 3 mm (Ravi 2005, Chapter 3). Table
6.5 shows some ranges of minimum diameters of cored holes in casting (Beeley 2001).

Thickness should be also studied in detail before patternmaking. For instance, walls thinner than recommended
minimum values should be avoided due to filling and mold‐making issues. Table 6.6 shows some thickness limits
for different casting processes (Black and Kohser 2020, Chapter 11).
6.3.2 Shrinkage Allowance
In Chapter 5, three volumetric contractions were identified during the casting process: liquid contraction,
solidification shrinkage, and solid thermal contraction. The first two shrinkages reduce the volume of molten metal
in the mold, but this volume is compensated by a proper design of the mold or/and risers, that provide a correct
directional solidification. However, once the cavity is solidified, the cooling process shrinks the casting part. This
shrinkage must be taken into account and it should be incorporated as a corrective factor into the pattern design.
This factor is commonly named as the patternmaker's shrinkage factor by foundrymen. Therefore, the pattern is
typically crafted with slightly larger dimensions than the final part requires to compensate for the solid thermal
contraction. This oversizing ensures that, once the casting reaches room temperature, its dimensions align with the
design intent before secondary operations are placed, staying within acceptable tolerances (Wang et al. 2010).
The magnitude of the shrinkage allowance depends on the specific casting alloy employed, as different metals
contract at varying rates during cooling. Table 6.7 shows an average amount of shrinkage for important cast
metals. Note that the percentage of shrinkage listed in the table refers to dimensional shrinkage instead of
volumetric shrinkages reported in Chapter 5. Furthermore, casting shrinkage depends on shape, thickness, casting
temperature, mold temperature, and mold strength, in addition to the material used. Therefore, it is preferable to
estimate the quantity of shrinkage based on historical data gathered from previous experiences in similar castings.
Another crucial aspect to consider in shrinkage allowances is the resistance of the mold to the casting's contraction,
influenced by factors such as the casting's shape and the material of the mold itself. Take, for example, the casting
illustrated in Figure 6.14. In this case, dimension X experiences minimal constraints on its ability to contract
because the casting will naturally separate from the mold walls as it shrinks. Consequently, the full value of the
patternmaker's allowance would be applied to this dimension. Conversely, the contraction of diameter Y is
significantly restricted, depending on the rigidity of the core used to create the hole. Therefore, dimension Y would
receive little to no patternmaker's allowance. This example underscores that the application of the patternmaker's
allowance heavily relies on judgment and experience. Additionally, the shape of the casting can profoundly
influence the extent of local shrinkage. Various mold characteristics, such as mold rigidity, risers, gates, and so
forth, can also impact casting shrinkage.
Finally, in cases where precise tolerances are essential for a specific dimension, an initially larger‐than‐normal
shrinkage allowance may be employed. Subsequently, the pattern is fine‐tuned through iterative adjustments based
on precise measurements of the actual shrinkage that occurs, with machining modifications made accordingly.

6.3.3 Machining Allowance
Casting dimensions are larger than final design dimensions to provide stock for machining. This material is added
when higher dimensional quality is needed after casting, so secondary operations such as turning or milling are
required. This additional material is called machining allowance and it should be considered in the pattern design.
The following elements affect pattern enlargement caused by machining allowance:
 
1. The machining technique (such as turning, grinding, drilling, etc.). For instance, less metal is removed by
grinding than by turning.
2. Metal properties (ferrous or nonferrous, soft or hard, and easily machinable or difficult). For instance, iron
oxidizes, and thus, a higher allowance may be needed for iron than for aluminum or magnesium.
3. The casting technique employed. For centrifugal casting, a larger allowance is needed on the inner side where
most of the impurities is retained. Sand castings require more machining allowance while precision casting
such as investment casting, plaster casting and die casting need less.
4. The casting's dimensions and shape. For instance, long castings have increased warpage, and thus, larger
machining allowance is needed to ensure part quality after machining.
It should be remarked that the amount of metal remaining for machining must be kept to a minimum while still
being sufficient to allow cutters to fully remove the casting's scale, impurities, and imperfections. Common
machining allowances for different dimensions and alloys are shown in Table 6.8.
6.3.4 Draft
When pattern's vertical faces are tapered or angled (known as draft), the pattern is easier to be removed from the
sand mold, as shown in Figure 6.15. No matter what kind of pattern is employed, draft must be used. The amount

of draft needed depends upon (i) the shape of casting; (ii) depth of casting; (iii) casting process; and (iv) casting
material. Table 6.9 shows different taper allowances used for different casting processes.
6.3.5 Fillets and Radii
Fillets and radii are key characteristics of a well‐conceived pattern design. Fillets are defined as the rounding‐out
of internal corners of the pattern. Radii are the rounding‐out of the external edges of the pattern. Both enhance the
visual appeal of the casting while also aiding in the distribution of strains and the reduction of inherent stresses that
arise during casting.

pattern is higher than 50 mm.

a Although 0–2° drafts may be required to extract wax/polystyrene patterns from molds.
Internal corners may produce localized areas that solidify more slowly than the rest of the part, which may result in
many casting defects such as hot tears, cracking, or shrinkage. External corners rapidly lose heat to the
surrounding mold material, which may generate additional defects such as misruns (Kay 2002). Additionally, any
abrupt change along the pathway of the molten metal may induce turbulence. This turbulence encourages the
mingling of the molten metal with air in the casting cavity, resulting in the formation of oxide inclusions. The
presence of sufficient fillets/radii facilitates the smooth flow of molten metal, ensuring thorough cavity filling and
minimizing the likelihood of turbulent flow. As a general practice, fillets/radii with a radius of 4–5 mm are
commonly utilized.
6.3.6 Parting Line
In sand casting, the mold is typically split into two halves, the cope and the drag, to allow for the removal of the
pattern. The surface where the two mold halves meet is known as parting plane or parting line if a 2D perspective
is considered. It is generally preferable to have the parting line in a single plane because it simplifies pattern
design, pattern creation, mold construction, and assembly. Additionally, patterns with straight parting lines tend to
be more cost‐effective compared to those with irregular or offset parting lines.
Figure 6.16 Split patterns and resulting casting part.

A key rule in the placement of the parting plane is to select the casting's biggest cross‐section to facilitate the
removal of the pattern. Following this rule, when a casting design exhibits symmetry around a central axis or
plane, determining the position of the parting line is straightforward. Furthermore, the runners, gates, and sprue
well are typically positioned in the drag so that the top of these channels or cavities is formed by the separating
plane. An example of a split pattern is shown in Figure 6.16, where both cope and drag patterns are illustrated.
6.3.7 Core Prints and Chaplets
Whenever there is a need to incorporate a core to shape the inner contours of a casting, it becomes crucial to
establish the correct positioning and support for this core within the mold. To address this requirement, core prints
are extensions or projections intentionally integrated into the pattern. These core prints are carefully designed to
resist the upward pressure exerted on the core by the molten metal once it is poured into the mold. Additionally,
core prints are designed to prevent any displacement of the core when the molten metal flows into the mold cavity.
The buoyant force in casting is estimated as:
where P is the buoyant force, V is the volume of the core in the mold cavity, ρ is the density of the liquid metal,
and d is the density of the core material. For common sand cores, a density of 1,387 kg/m3 is assumed. A more
straightforward estimation can be done by expressing the buoyant force as a proportion of the weight of the core
according to Table 6.10.

Figure 6.17 (a) Core prints to support core; (b) chaplets added to support the core.
To keep the core in position without distorting the mold, it is empirically considered that a core print has to be able
to support a load of 3.5 N/cm2 (Rao 2006). Therefore, the core print area should satisfy:

where A is the area of the core print in mm2 and P is the buoyancy force exerted on the core and it is expressed in
N. For facilitating core assembly, a minimum core print length of 10 mm is recommended. In case the position of
the core (Figure 6.17a) cannot be ensured only with the core prints, chaplets (Figure 6.17b) can be added. Table
6.11 shows recommended core prints for horizontal and vertical cores (h1 and v1, respectively), according to Rao
(2006).
Additionally, the core itself may collapse due to the buoyant forces. For green sand cores, it can be assumed shear
and tensile strength ranges are within 100–150 kPa while for baked cores, 1,000–1,500 kPa is a reasonable range.
When it is expected that cores will need to resist higher values, chaplets should be used.
Cores are commonly supported from one side (the other side is free) or from both sides (Figure 6.17). For
cylindrical cores with one side support, the maximum shear stress is F/A (F is the buoyant force and A is the core
cross‐section) whereas for two sides supported cores, the maximum shear stress is F/(2A). In the last case, the
maximum tensile tension is given at the middle of the core due to the bending moment and its maximum value is
estimated as 
, where L is the core length and d is the core diameter.

For instance, consider a green sand core of 5 kg with a diameter of 100 mm and length of 460 mm for casting gray
iron parts. For this example, assume that the core is placed into the mold by two sides. Then, the buoyant force is
calculated as 3.5 × 5 = 17.5 kgf. The core print dimension required, considering a safety factor of 1.5, is:
The core print projected area is D × L, and since there are two core prints (two sides), the minimum length for each
core print is
After designing the core print, the core resistance is analyzed. In this example, since the core is supported by two
sides, the maximum tensile stress is
Since the tensile stress at the middle of the core is lower than 100–150 kPa for green sand cores, a chaplet is not
required.
6.3.8 Opening Forces on Molds
The force of the molten metal due to metallostatic pressure will force open the boxes and result in runouts if a
mold is not properly clamped. Therefore, it is crucial to quantify the opening force to utilize the appropriate
weighting or clamping devices.

The metallostatic force, Fm, can be estimated by taking the area of the cross‐section of the casting on which this is
acting. The projected area of the casting in the parting plane, Ap, is the area on which the metal pressure will be
acting. As shown in Figure 6.18, the metallostatic pressure depends on the height given by h − c. Hence, the force
Fm is calculated as
Figure 6.18 Parameters h and c related to the opening force of the cope.
Note that when the metal enters the mold cavity at a high flow rate, the loss of momentum would exert much
higher pressure than that accounted for the aforementioned static condition. It is a general practice to increase 50%
the estimated force to account for this dynamic effect (Brown 2000, Chapter 1).
6.3.9 Practical Example
Define the pattern and core required for a casting process to manufacture the cylindrical parts shown in Figure
6.19. The material is aluminum alloy and the machining allowance is defined as 3 mm.
First, the machining and shrinkage allowance are added to the model. The shrinkage for aluminum alloys is 1.3%
(Table 6.7) and the machining allowance is given in the example and its value is 3 mm. Thus, the pattern is defined
by the envelope of the final cast part with the following values:

Figure 6.19 Cylindrical part to be cast. Dimensions in mm.
The dimensions of the core are as follows:
The pattern will present a core print. The length of the core print is defined to ensure that the core resists the
buoyant force and stays in position without distorting the mold. The buoyant force is expressed as
where W is the weight of the core within the cavity, which is expressed as
and the core sand density is assumed to be 1,387 kg/m3. Thus,
The core print required assuming a safety factor of 1.5 is

The core print projected area is D × L, and since there are two print cores (two sides), the minimum core print
length required is
This minimum core print value will ensure that the mold has no distortion. In this case, the minimum value is too
small to be practical, and thus, a recommended core print value of 50 mm from Table 6.11 is chosen.
Next, the core resistance should be analyzed. For a two‐side support, the maximum tensile tension is
Since the tensile tension is less than 100–150 kPa, the core will resist the buoyant forces.
The opening force in this mold is

Figure 6.21 Cross‐section of the cope pattern with core prints. Dimensions in mm.
Note that since the cavity is cylindrical, the value of c depends on the point analyzed within the cavity and it is not
constant. An average from each cylindrical cavity is considered as three‐fourth of the radius as shown in Figure
6.20, since it presents the same volume of sand above the cavity. Thus, the final opening force is
If the weight of the cope with the sand is lower than this value, the cope and drag should be clamped together
during pouring to avoid lifting. At this step, a safety factor of 1.5 is usually applied. Finally, all surfaces have a
generous draft of 5° since the process is a sand‐casting process (Table 6.9). The fillets/radii of all corners are 5‐mm
radius. Figure 6.21 shows the final cope pattern plate dimensions.
6.4 Core and Core Box Fabrication
Cores are sand inserts used to shape the interior surfaces of a casting that cannot be formed by the pattern.
Patternmaker must determine the quantity and configuration of required cores and subsequently devise and
construct the corresponding core boxes. Each core must possess a shape that core makers can readily produce, and
that the foundry can easily handle. Furthermore, these cores must be assembled into the mold without causing
interference with other cores or mold components. A crucial consideration is ensuring the accurate positioning and
secure retention of the cores during the filling and solidification steps.
Typically, cores are crafted using a blend of sand and organic binders, which are favored over clay due to their
ability to disintegrate when exposed to the high temperatures of molten alloys. This characteristic facilitates their
removal during the shakeout process. Cores are fabricated by compacting the raw sand mixture into a core box. In
some cases, metal rods are employed to reinforce the core. After compacting the core, it usually undergoes a
baking process in an oven to impart the necessary strength required for manipulation during placement within the
mold. This strength also enables the core to withstand the fluid flow and buoyant forces that may arise during the
casting's filling and solidification stages.

6.5 Casting Simulation
Some popular casting simulation programs are AutoCAST‐X, MAGMA, ProCAST, SolidCAST, and Altair Inspire
Cast. The main inputs and outputs of casting simulation software are shown in Figure 6.22. In general, these
programs analyze mold filling (erosion, inclusions, cold shuts, and misruns), the solidification process (macro and
microporosity), the cooling process (residual stresses, cracks, and tears), and microstructure (grain size,
mechanical properties). Figure 6.23 shows an example of use of Altair Inspire Cast for validating a casting design
of a valve component. Therefore, casting simulations let process planners easily validate riser designs and gate
placement, detect issues in flow direction and thermal gradients, and predict defects such as pipes and
microporosity.
6.6 Melting and Casting
Depending on the metal to be cast, different furnace characteristics and melting requirements must be satisfied. An
estimation of the energy required to be provided by the furnace for melting can be done given the type of material
and mass, as shown in Chapter 5.
During casting, tools such as ladles are used to extract molten metal from the furnace that is then poured into the
molds. It is important to consider that the molten metal temperature will decrease due to heat loss through the
environment and the final pouring temperature will be lower than that from the furnace. Since pouring temperature
is a critical factor in avoiding incomplete castings, fluidity issues, etc., a fair estimation of this temperature drop is
needed to set up the furnace temperature. Table 6.12 provides the time for different temperature losses in
uncovered ladles from 50 kg to 500 kg in iron foundries. For steady‐state cooling, the cooling‐rate for 25 kg
uncovered ladles is defined as 30 °C/min; for 500 kg uncovered ladles, the value drops to 6 °C/min (BCIRA 1980).
Furthermore, Table 6.13 shows recommended pouring temperatures for different metals and thicknesses. Note that
higher pouring temperatures lead to higher costs and, in some cases, it also leads to reactivity issues with
atmospheric gases and casting defects such as flash or penetration issues.

6.7 Knockout, Fettling, and Finishing
6.7.1 Knockout
When the metal has solidified and cooled sufficiently, the mold passes through knockout, where the mold is broken
and the casting is roughly shot blasted and is then ready for the fettling process. Furthermore, molding sand is
conditioned so that the sand can be reused for producing additional sand molds.
6.7.2 Fettling
Fettling is defined as the process of cleaning castings after they leave the foundry, including the removal of
runners/gates, risers, filling rough spots, cleaning sand from the surfaces, and removing the cores. In recent times,
automated robotic processes have been developed to handle certain repetitive aspects of the fettling process, but
historically, skilled workers, known as fettlers, undertook this labor‐intensive task manually.
The sequence of tasks executed in the fettling process can be categorized as follows:
 
Removal of runners and risers. After knockout, risers, and runner systems are removed from the castings. The
removal is conducted using a metal hand saw for soft alloys such as aluminum, or more powerful saw‐cutting
machines for steels although other methods can be applied such as abrasive cut‐off wheels, flame cutting, and
arc cutting.
Decoring. Decoring, as the name suggests, is merely the removal of cores from castings or their knocking out.
Decoring tools such as core vibrators, water‐jet core knockout units, shot‐blasting, and many more can be
used to remove cores.
Burnt sand and scale removal. Manual shot blasting is commonly applied at this step to remove scale and
burnt sand. For mass‐produced small castings, the outer surfaces are cleaned using tumbling barrels with
periodic action. This cleaning process involves the castings rubbing against white iron picks within a
tumbling barrel.
Chipping and grinding of castings. To eliminate excess metal and flash from the completed casting, chipping,
and grinding are employed. Chipping involves removing flash using chipping hammers and chisels. Grinding,
on the contrary, is a smoothing process used to correct irregularities and remove excessive metal.
6.7.3 Finishing
The latter phase of the cleaning process after casting is known as finishing. Further surface refinement can be
achieved through various methods such as machining, chemical treatments, polishing, buffing, blasting, and
painting. Certain types of steel and malleable iron may undergo heat treatment after cleaning, which can impact the
casting's surface. Therefore, these metals often require specialized finishing processes. Nonferrous castings can
undergo finishing through chemical, electrolytic, and mechanical procedures. Another aspect of finishing that can
be applied to castings involves the removal of impurities such as dust, dirt, scales, sand, and grit, achieved through
a salt–bath cleaning process.
In some cases, casting parts present defects that will not pass quality control. When these defects are not critical
and can be corrected, a rectification process also named salvage operation is conducted. Methods employed for
rectifying defects in castings include electric welding, metal spraying, and gas welding. Whether salvage is
feasible or not depends on factors such as the defect's size, the weight of the casting, the casting's alloy, the
complexity of the repair, the cost of salvage, and the availability of the necessary equipment.

6.8 Inspection
Casting inspection is required for a correct assessment of the quality of castings, which ultimately leads to their
acceptance or rejection. Different types of inspection can be conducted in casting: visual, dimensional, mechanical,
and metallurgical.
 
Visual inspection. Visual inspection involves the examination of completed castings using the naked eye to
assess potential casting defects (dirt, misruns, cold shuts, blowholes, surface dross, etc.). Visual inspection is
typically conducted both before the cleaning and annealing processes and after the fettling operation. For tiny
cracks, pores, or other surface glitches that are hard to detect by the human eye, dye penetrant testing is used
for both ferrous and nonferrous materials.
Dimensional inspection. Dimensional inspection entails the measurement of the finished casting's dimensions.
Measurement instruments such as calipers and gauges are used to analyze if dimensions are within the
admissible values to move the casting to subsequent operations.
Mechanical inspection. Mechanical tests such as hardness testing, tensile/impact testing and load testing can
be also conducted.
Metallurgical inspection. Chemical composition analysis, evaluation of casting integrity, and other related
casting tests are conducted to confirm the internal quality of the casting part. Chemical analysis often involves
taking a sample of molten metal poured into a special mold that is analyzed by spectrographic atomic
absorption. For internal inspections, ultrasonic testing or radiographic inspection is applied to detect internal
imperfections such as pipes or inclusions.
6.9 Operations List in Sand Casting
A typical operations list in sand casting may look like the one shown in Figure 6.24. As can be seen, all required
operations for sand casting are indicated with the estimated operation time required. Setup times, specific tooling
and any relevant information are also indicated in the casting operations list.

Definition and Selection of Workholding Systems
7.1 Introduction
A workholding system refers to any mechanism utilized to secure a workpiece and prevent it from shifting during
manufacturing operations, typically machining operations. Furthermore, workholding systems are designed to
reduce operator labor by simplifying the tasks of locating and clamping, ultimately leading to an improved
production rate (Nee and Tao 2004).
Workholding devices can be general‐purpose workholders (such as clamps, vises, and chucks), jigs, or fixtures.
Jigs are commonly used for guiding cutting tools during the machining operation, specially to avoid deflection and
issues during cutting entries. The most common types of jigs are drill jigs, which serve various purposes, including
drilling, tapping, reaming, chamfering, counterboring, countersinking, and similar operations. On the contrary,
fixtures offer a broader range of applications compared to jigs, and they do not guide the cutting tools but locate
and hold the workpiece during machining. These specialized workholders are specifically designed for situations
where complex structures should be built to position and orient a part precisely. Figure 7.1a,b shows examples for
both jigs and fixtures in machining processes. The left side illustrates a commercial drill jig employing a V‐block
to secure cylindrical parts before the drilling process. The right side illustrates a permanent workholder used for
machining a pedal of a freight vehicle.
Workholding design can be a tedious task and it may entail a large budget in industries such as automobile or
aircraft where complex permanent fixtures are required. Process planners should take into account many factors
for a successful workholding design, such as identifying reference surfaces or datums, machining capability in
single setups, cutting and clamping forces estimation, ways of ease workpiece loading and unloading, prevention
of cutting tool path interferences, etc.
In this chapter, the main principles of workholding for proper workholding systems design are presented. Locating
and clamping guidelines are reviewed, and the main general‐purpose workholders applied in machining are
described. The chapter also presents a standard to formally indicate the configuration of the locating and clamping
systems in technical drawings. The type of contact, the movements locked, and other characteristics of the
workholding system can be graphically represented following the standard.

7.2 Principles of Workholding
Locating and clamping are the fundamental functions of any workholding system. As such, the fundamental
principles of locating and clamping must be thoroughly understood and are briefly reviewed in the following
sections.
7.2.1 Locating and Clamping Principles
A part needs to be held in a setup that ensures a specific location and orientation to be machined properly.
Throughout the production run, this arrangement must be reproducible. Additionally, the workholding mechanism
must maintain the part's position despite cutting forces and vibrations.
Understanding the coordinate system that represents a solid object in three‐space and its degrees of freedom is the
first step in defining its location. Any solid object in three‐space has six degrees of freedom, which corresponds to
three translation movements along the x, y, and z axes and three rotations around each of these three axes.
However, for fixturing design purposes, it is more recommendable to consider the positive and negative directions
of these movements, which in practice defines 12 directions of movements. These 12 movements correspond to six
translation movements along the x, y, and z axes (i.e., ±Tx, ±Ty, and ±Tz, which refer to the movements from #1 to
#6), and six rotations around each of these three axes (i.e., ±Rx, ±Ry, and ±Rz, which refer to the movements from
#7 to #12). A workpiece may move in any of these 12 directions (Figure 7.2).

The locators are the tools that accurately position the workpiece in the space, that is, they provide a secure stop.
When pressed up against the stop, the workpiece is immobile. Additionally, clamps are the tools that exert a
clamping force to secure the workpiece to the locators.
7.2.1.1 Forms of Location
Location can take one of three general shapes: plane, concentric, or radial, and in many cases, locating is
performed by a combination of them (Carrlane Manufacturing Co. 2023). Workpieces are typically located on
surfaces that may be flat, curved, or irregularly contoured. Figure 7.3a shows how plane‐locating devices often
locate a part via its exterior surfaces, for instance, on a machine tool table or a plane surface from a fixture. A plane
location will lock five movements, one translation (−Tz), and four rotation movements (±Rx, ±Ry).
Figure 7.2 The 12 movements of a part in the three‐space.

Figure 7.3 The three forms of location: plane, concentric, and radial.
Source: Adapted from Carrlane Manufacturing Co. (2023).
Another form of location is based on concentric location, usually locating the workpiece from a central axis. This
axis might or might not be in the workpiece's center. A locating pin that is inserted into a hole is the most typical
sort of concentric location (Figure 7.3b). A concentric location will lock four translations (±Tx, ±Ty) and four
rotation movements (±Rx, ±Ry). Finally, to prevent the movement of a workpiece around a concentric locator, a
radial locator is applied, as shown in Figure 7.3c. Therefore, one additional rotation movement is constrained
(−Rz).
7.2.1.2 Locating from External Surfaces
External flat surfaces are frequently employed as workpiece features for positioning purposes. A flat surface is
usually positioned by locators or supports that can be fixed or adjustable in height, as depicted in Figure 7.4.

Figure 7.4 Spherical fixed locator (a) and adjustable supports to locate/support a workpiece (b).
Figure 7.5 The 3‐2‐1 locating scheme and movements constrained by locators in a face‐milling operation. Clamps
are not shown.
Fixed supports, also known as solid supports, are locators with a predetermined height. They accurately position a
surface along a single axis. Adjustable supports, on the contrary, offer variable height settings. Similar to solid
supports, they excel at precise alignment along a single axis. Adjustable supports are particularly useful when

workpiece variations necessitate adaptable support to accommodate varying heights. They are predominantly
employed for cast or forged workpieces that exhibit uneven or irregular mounting surfaces.
The most widely adopted method for positioning a workpiece using its external profile is the 3‐2‐1 locating
scheme. In this approach, six individual locators (typically spherical locator pins) are employed to establish
references and constraints on the workpiece's movement. The 3‐2‐1 locating scheme is illustrated in Figure 7.5, and
it is defined as follows. First, three locators are situated on the primary locating surface, typically at the bottom
part of the workpiece. These locators restrict axial movement downward, along the −z axis (movement #6), as well
as the rotational movement about the x (#7 and #8) and y (#9 and #10) axes. Collectively, these three locators
constrain five movements. The next two locators are placed on the secondary locating surface, constraining axial
movement along the −y axis (#4) and rotational movement about the z (#11 and #12) axis, constraining three
additional movements. The final locator is positioned at the third locating surface, constraining axial movement in
one direction along the −x axis (#2). Together, these six locators collectively lock nine out of 12 movements. The
remaining three movements (#1, #3, and #5) are typically constrained by clamping forces.
Figure 7.6 Two locating pins mounted on a plate lock 11‐out‐of‐12 possible movements.
7.2.1.3 Locating from Internal Surfaces
Positioning a workpiece using internal surfaces represents an efficient form of placement, and it is commonly
applied in industry, for instance, in machining engine blocks after casting. This method primarily relies on specific
holes or hole patterns as key features for positioning. Two types of locators are typically employed for internal
positioning: concentric locators, also referred to as round pins, and radial locators, also referred to as diamond
pins.
A simple example to illustrate these two types of locators using internal surfaces is shown in Figure 7.6. The
workpiece is placed over a plate that effectively constrains five movements (i.e., plane location), preventing any
axial movement in the −z (#6) direction and rotations around the x and y axes (from #7 to #10). The workpiece
presents two holes, where a concentric and a radial locator are used for positioning. The concentric locator ensures
that there is no axial movement along the x (#1, #2) and y (#3, #4) axes. Collectively, the plate and the concentric

locator lock nine out of 12 movements. Finally, the radial locator restricts two movements by preventing rotational
movement around the z (#11 and #12) axis. Combined, the plate and locators lock eleven out of 12 movements.
The remaining movement in the +z direction is typically constrained using a clamp.
7.2.1.4 Analyzing Machining Forces
When designing fixtures, a key aspect is to understand the direction and magnitude of the forces generated during
the machining process. Knowing the magnitude of these cutting forces helps determine clamping requirements and
potential workpiece deflections. In cases where workpiece deflection needs to be controlled, additional supports
can be incorporated (see Section 7.2.3).
A correct workholding design ensures that the workpiece is held against the cutting forces by locators and not by
the clamps. Following this basic design rule, the necessary clamping pressure is highly reduced. In other words,
clamps are not intended to withstand the primary cutting forces; their sole purpose is to maintain the workpiece's
position against the locators and counteract the secondary cutting forces.
The relationship between locators and clamps can be illustrated using a plain vice for milling operations. In Figure
7.7a, the plain vice combines both locating and clamping elements. The solid jaw and the vice body serve as the
locators, while the movable jaw acts as the clamp. The recommended orientation places the locators in opposition
to the cutting forces, and thus, the cutting forces are directed toward the solid jaw and vice body. Then, the position
of the workpiece is ensured by the solid jaw, whereas the movable jaw, much like other clamps, merely secures the
workpiece's position against the locators. A similar reasoning can be conducted in Figure 7.7b, where a locator and
a clamp are used for holding a workpiece, and the cutting forces are directed toward the locator.

Figure 7.7 Cutting forces in a milling operation should be directed into the locating component: (a) plain vice; (b)
locator and clamp mounted on a machine tool table.
7.2.2 Locating Guidelines
There is no one location method or locator type that will be effective for all workholders. Each locator needs to be
carefully planned into the fixture layout to carry out the required location in a proper manner. The following are
some rules to follow when selecting and using locators.
7.2.2.1 Positioning Locators
Any locator's primary objective is to create a workpiece reference point to ensure position and orientation
repeatability. To avoid significant variation from part to part, locators should, whenever possible, be positioned to
make contact with a machined surface rather than a casting or forming surface. In addition to improving
repeatability, a machined surface usually offers a more stable positioning method. To create a sufficient contact
surface, the entire surface may sometimes be machined, but other times—especially when working with castings—
only certain sections may be machined.
To ensure repeatability, another crucial consideration in locator placement is the spacing between the locators
themselves. As a general guideline, locators should be spaced as far apart as is practically possible. This principle

is exemplified in Figure 7.8. All the locating schemes shown in the figure employ the 3‐2‐1 locating method, with
the only distinction being the locator spacing.
As it can be seen, only the first locating scheme can position the workpiece with good repeatability since a longer
distance between locators compensates for the irregularities in either the locators or the workpiece surfaces and
enhances overall stability. However, the other schemes are not adequate because locators are too close to each
other or, in the case of the last scheme, the three locators are aligned, which prevents the stability of the workpiece,
that is, the part is under‐constrained. It should be noted that if locators are too close to each other, any small locator
error would be magnified, producing a larger workpiece position deviation or even a slight rotation of the part.
Figure 7.8 Correct and incorrect locating schemes for machining. Locators should be spaced as far apart as
practical to compensate slight irregularities and ensure maximum stability.
Instead of external planar surfaces, machined holes are usually the preferred surfaces for positioning, as they offer
the most comprehensive and stable form of positioning with the fewest number of locators. In this case, the same
reasoning applies, and longer distances between radial and concentric locators will minimize the impact of
positioning errors of the locators, ensuring a repeatability position of the workpiece.
Finally, the positioning of locators should also consider the cutting tool path and the loading and unloading
movements of the workpiece to ensure easy and fast movements without interferences (Joshi 2003).
7.2.2.2 Avoiding Over‐Constrained Workpieces
Workholding must ensure the repeatability of the workpiece position. For this purpose, the part must be
constrained properly, avoiding parts to be over‐constrained. As shown previously, under‐constrained occurs when
there is at least one direction of motion unconstrained, and thus, the part will not be stable during machining. On
the contrary, over‐constrained workpieces are given when different locators try to constrain the same degrees of
freedom, and then, depending on the part and locator tolerances, the location of the part will vary from part to part,
and the repeatability of part location is compromised.
Therefore, fixture design must follow the principle of isostatism. The concept of isostatism means that the
workholding provides a unique location in space, and there is no ambiguity about the location of the part. To reach
isostatic positioning, locators that constrain the same degrees of freedom (named redundant locators) should be
avoided. The problem of redundant locators is illustrated in Figure 7.9. In case Figure 7.9a, it is observed that four
locators are constraining the same part movements (up and down movement and part rotation). Given that
workpiece dimensions may vary within their tolerances, the probability that all parts simultaneously rest on both
surfaces is minimal. Thus, the position of the part may vary, as shown in option 1 and option 2, which refers to two
possible workpiece positions. In Figure 7.9b, two locators and both concentric and radial locators constrain the
same part movements (up and down movements and part rotations). Due to workpiece variability, the final position
will depend on which surface touches the locators, as illustrated in the examples shown in option 1 and option 2.
As shown in Figure 7.9a, b, the repeatability of the workpiece position is not ensured due to the existence of
redundant locators.

Note that the same problem is given when locating surfaces instead of locators are applied, and those that are
redundant and prevent repeatability of workpiece position should be avoided. The most straightforward way to
eliminate redundant locations is by examining the blueprint of the part to determine which workpiece surface
serves as the reference surface. Often, the part's dimensional specifications indicate which surfaces or features are
critical and should be regarded as the main locating surfaces.
Figure 7.9 Examples of redundant locators that produce a non‐repeatable location (options 1 and 2): (a) a 3‐2‐1
scheme with 2 redundant locators; (b) a concentric and radial scheme with 3 redundant locators.
7.2.2.3 Designing Foolproofing Layouts
Foolproofing designs avoid operator's mistakes when locating parts on workholding devices and can be a good
strategy to avoid costly errors at the machining stage. The complexity of the foolproofing design depends on the
workpiece design, but in some cases, the foolproofing design can be easily included in the workholding device, as
shown in Figure 7.10.
7.2.2.4 Evaluating Locating Accuracy
As shown in Figure 7.8, the position of the locators, that is, the fixture layout, influences the accuracy of
workpiece location. For instance, if locators are too close to each other, any small locator error would be

magnified, producing a larger workpiece position deviation or even a slight rotation of the part. The accuracy of a
fixture can be mathematically estimated by analyzing the variability of the fixture coordinate system given the
fixture layout and the locators' tolerances. For a 3‐2‐1 fixture layout, the accuracy of the fixture can be estimated
considering the accurateness matrix of localization from Wang (2002) defined as follows:
Figure 7.10 Example of foolproofing workholding design to ensure that components are loaded properly.
where ni is a vector that defines the workpiece surface normal at the ith contact point (i = 1, …, 6); ri is the
position vector of each ith locator with respect to the fixture coordinate system; and ai is named as the locator
accurateness and is defined as 1/si, where si is Tol/36, being “Tol” the locator tolerance or estimated locator error.
Note that the superscript T refers to the transpose of the vector, and “×” refers to the cross‐product vector.
The accuracy of the fixture layout is related to the determinant of matrix A. Maximizing this matrix means
minimizing the overall variance of the fixture coordinate system that is used to locate the workpiece. Therefore, for
comparing different layouts for the same workpiece, analyzing and selecting the one with the higher determinant
of matrix A results in the best fixture layout configuration.
Figure 7.11 shows an example to illustrate the calculation process. In this example, three different 3‐2‐1 fixture
layouts are compared by evaluating the determinant of matrix A, that is, the accurateness matrix of localization,
and assuming that the tolerance of all locators is the same, 0.01 mm. As expected, case 3 presents the highest
determinant value, which indicates that it is less sensitive to locators' inaccuracies, and thus, the most accurate
fixture layout.
Note that this accuracy analysis does not consider aspects such as fixture rigidity, and it only analyzes the layout of
locators in a 3‐2‐1 fixture scheme. It should also be noted that the required accuracy in a workholding design is

defined by the final part specifications. Generally, 20–50% of part tolerance can be attributed to the fixturing
device (Hoffman 2012).
7.2.3 Clamping Guidelines
Besides locating the workpiece accurately and repeatedly, a workholding system should clamp it sufficiently to
prevent movement during the machining operation. Clamps are the primary tools used for this purpose. Here are
some guidelines for designing the clamping system in machining operations (Carrlane Manufacturing Co. 2023;
Joshi 2003):
Figure 7.11 Example of comparing different fixture layouts by evaluating the accurateness matrix of localization.
7.2.3.1 Positioning Clamps
 
Clamp placement. Clamps are sized to secure the workpiece against the locators without causing deformation
and resisting any secondary forces. Thus, clamps should contact the work at its most rigid point to avoid
bending or damaging the part. For instance, clamps are aligned directly over the supporting or locating
elements of the workholder as illustrated in Figure 7.12.
Worker's interference. Ensure that the clamps are placed to let the operator work easily and safely without
making the loading/unloading difficult.
Tool path consideration. Check for interference between the cutters and the clamps during both the machining
and return cycles. Clamps should be placed on a robustly supported part of the workpiece, away from the
loading/unloading and cutting tool paths.
Clamp height. Most clamps are positioned on or near the top surface of the workpiece. Keep the overall
height of the clamp relative to the workpiece to a minimum to avoid tool path interferences, as shown in

Figure 7.13. Gooseneck‐type clamps can be employed to achieve a lower profile when reduced clamp height
is necessary.
Contact area. Consider the size of the clamp‐contact area to minimize interference with the cutter. Smaller
clamping areas reduce the likelihood of interference and enhance clamping pressure on the workpiece.
Choose a clamp size that is large enough to securely hold the workpiece but small enough to avoid
obstruction.
Surface damage. If a finished surface is used to place a clamp, the clamp should prevent damage to the
surface by using proper terminals. Furthermore, the clamping pressure may be limited to ensure holding the
part without damaging the surface.
7.2.3.2 Avoiding Workpiece Deformation
As stated earlier, the main goal of a workholding system is to locate and hold the part during the machining
operation without causing distortion or deformation. Therefore, the clamping force should be adjusted to avoid
distortion of the component, and supports must be added if the part is not rigid enough and is expected to be
deformed.
An example is shown in Figure 7.14, where a compliant zone of the part is used for clamping, and auxiliary
support is added before applying the clamp to avoid deformations. This practice is common in holding sheet parts,
where an N‐2‐1 locating scheme is used, and N−3 is the number of auxiliary supports used to hold the part without
deforming it due to clamping forces.
Figure 7.12 Clamps should always be positioned so the clamping force is directed into the supports or locators.

Figure 7.13 Using gooseneck clamps is one way to reduce the height of the clamps.

Figure 7.14 Use of supports to avoid workpiece deformation.
When the part is not rigid enough, the type of the workholding device may result in completely different holding
results depending on the magnitude and direction of clamping forces. Figure 7.15a–c shows different workholding
systems to securely position a thin‐walled ring for boring its internal diameter. As can be seen, the performance of
these workholding systems differs noticeably between them. The first workholding system is a four‐jaw chuck that
clamps the workpiece on its outer diameter at four points. This method is likely to cause deformation of the ring
due to the direction and magnitude of the clamping force. The second workholding system is a face plate with four
strap clamps where the clamping force is directed into the plate rather than against the spring force of the

workpiece. Therefore, this clamping method eliminates the distortion that occurs with the previous workholding
system. However, it could be the case that the part can only be clamped on its outer surface, and thus, this
workholding system cannot be applied. Under these situations, the third example can be applied as an alternative
method. This workholding system consists of a collet that completely encloses the part, and the clamping force
generated is distributed along the whole perimeter of the part. Depending on the size of the part, either a collet or
pie‐shaped soft jaws can be employed for this arrangement.
7.2.3.3 Evaluation of Clamping Force Requirement
As shown earlier, workholding systems should securely position the part during machining operations. Therefore,
cutting forces and the corresponding required clamping forces for every machining operation should be estimated,
which can be indeed very challenging.
Figure 7.15 (a) Directing the clamping forces against an unsupported area will cause this cylindrical part to
deform; (b) strap clamps eliminate deformation by directing the clamping forces into the plate under the part; (c)
when the part can only be clamped on its outside surface, a collet or a pie‐shaped chuck jaws can be used to hold
the part and reduce deformation.

Cutting forces can be fairly estimated by analyzing the chip cross‐section removed by the tool, the cutting speed,
and the mechanical properties of the workpiece (refer to Chapter 10 for practical examples). Then, the cutting tool
path is analyzed, and a diagram of cutting forces, locator reactions, and clamping forces is drawn and
mathematically calculated. As a simple example, consider the machining operation shown in Figure 7.16, where
face milling is conducted, and the workpiece is clamped on the machine tool table by strap clamps.
If it is assumed that the cutting force (Fc) is entirely horizontal and no workpiece locators are used, frictional
forces alone are responsible for resisting the cutting forces. For this case, the required clamping force (Ff) can be

evaluated as:
where Sf is the safety factor, and μ is the friction coefficient, which depends on the type of materials and
lubrication state. Table 7.1 shows common friction coefficients (dry and lubricated conditions) between different
pairs of materials. Note that the friction coefficient depends on numerous factors (e.g., roughness, type of
lubrication, thickness of layer lubrication, etc.), and the actual values may differ notably from those in Table 7.1.

Once the required clamping force is calculated, the metric selection for the strap clamps can be done by referring
to engineering tables where the tensile force of the stud is given. The tensile force in the stud is usually 75% of the
proof load, defined as the maximum tensile force that can be applied to a bolt without resulting in plastic
deformation. For metric bolts, the strength is defined according to the property class (ISO 898‐1: 2013
[International Standard Organization 2013]) with designations 4.6, 4.8, 5.8, 8.8, 9.8, 10.9, and 12.9. For instance, a
property class of 4.6 refers to low or medium carbon steels with a metric range of M5‐M36 and a minimum tensile
strength of 400 MPa. For illustrative purposes, Table 7.2 shows the recommended torque, the clamping force, and
the tensile force in the stud of different metric sizes, assuming a property class of 4.8. Note that for strap clamps,
the tensile force in the stud is exerted on both sides of the strap (i.e., 2‐to‐1 clamping–force ratio). Thus, the
clamping force is equal to the tensile force divided by two.
The calculations are usually more challenging for conventional workholding systems where workpiece locators
and multidirectional forces should be taken into account. In those cases, the worst‐case force scenario can be
intuitively estimated and then represented as a free‐body diagram to solve the acting forces in the system.

For illustrative purposes, consider the example shown in Figure 7.17 and assume that, based on a prior calculation,
the cutting force Fc is 1,600 N. The weight of the workpiece is 250 N, and the friction coefficient between the
workpiece and the machine tool table is assumed to be 0.19. According to the forces drawn in Figure 7.17, the
unknown forces are the horizontal reaction force from locating pins (R1 and R2), the vertical reaction force from
left side (R3) and right side (R4), the clamping force from the strap clamps (for each clamp, a force of Ff) and the
friction force (Fr1 and Fr2).
For a static condition, all forces in any direction and moments at any point must be equal to zero. Therefore, the
following equations are given:

In this example, it initially appears to be statically indeterminate since there are only three equations and five
variables. But analyzing the case for minimum clamping force, the workpiece would be barely touching the
machine tool table and thus, R4 can be assumed equal to 0. Furthermore, assuming R1 ≈ R2, then the required
clamping force is obtained by solving the following system of equations:
where three equations and three variables are identified. Solving the equations, the results are Ff = 574 N, R1 = R2
= 667 N, R3 = 1,398 N. Therefore, a minimum clamping force per clamp of 574 N is required. Considering Table
7.2, a strap clamp with a metric stud size M6 and a clamping force of around 2,000 N would be more than enough
for the application.
7.2.4 Basic Steps for Workholding/Fixturing Design
As a general guide, the following steps can be considered when designing a workholding/fixturing device:
 
Analyze the type of workholding system required. Permanent fixtures, modular fixtures, and general‐purpose
workholders are used for different scenarios depending on the volume of production, accuracy, productivity,
etc. A break‐even analysis may be necessary to make the correct decision.
Analyze the part. Identify the surfaces to be machined and locate surface candidates. For locating surface
selection, the following order of preference is commonly used (Hoffman 2012):
1. Holes for applying concentric and radial locators.
2. Machined surfaces that form right angles to place locators and lock orthogonal movements.
3. One machined surface and one unmachined surface form a right angle.
4. Two unmachined surfaces that form a right angle.
For fixturing layouts, apply the previous locating and clamping guidelines. The locating accuracy evaluation
for 3‐2‐1 schemes may be used for selecting between different layouts.
Estimate cutting forces and clamping forces requirements.
Redesign the fixture according to force estimation. For instance, soft materials such as aluminum,
magnesium, or polymers present lower cutting forces, and thus, less rigid fixtures are needed. If forces may
deform some regions of the workpiece, supports may be required.
7.3 Types of Workholding Systems
A general classification of workholding systems is shown in Figure 7.18. While permanent fixtures are specifically
designed for a large production volume with high requirements, general‐purpose workholders are mainly used in
shop‐floor activities or very short runs with limited accuracy, and modular fixtures provide a flexible way of
fixturing. Virtually every manufacturer finds suitable applications for each of these three options at various times,
depending on its specific needs.
Next, some details about these three types of workholding systems are explained.
7.3.1 Permanent Fixturing
Workholding solutions designed for high‐volume production typically take the form of permanent tools. These
permanent jigs and fixtures are primarily tailored for a specific operation on a particular part and they are
constructed using a combination of standard tooling components and custom‐made parts.

The increased complexity of these permanent workholders offers advantages in terms of enhanced productivity,
accuracy, and reduced reliance on operator decision‐making, leading to a lower average cost per unit. Very often,
the fixture elements are machined from a raw stock in the base structure of the fixture, which improves the
accuracy of the fixture (i.e., increases workpiece location repeatability). In situations involving hydraulic or
pneumatic fixtures, their inherent advantages can significantly boost productivity, further driving down per‐unit
costs despite the initially higher construction costs associated with these fixtures compared to other alternatives.
Figure 7.18 General classification of workholding systems.
7.3.2 Modular Fixtures
Modular fixtures offer many of the benefits associated with permanent tools while employing only a temporary
setup. The benefit of modular fixtures lies in their ability to harness the advantages of permanent tooling, such as
reduced setup time, durability, productivity enhancements, and diminished reliance on operator decision‐making,
by utilizing a standardized set of components. Once a production run is completed, the fixture can be
disassembled, allowing the components to be reused in constructing a different fixture. Later, the original fixture
can be easily reconstructed using provided drawings, instructions, and photographic records. This reusability
facilitates the creation of intricate, high‐precision tools without the need for the permanent dedication of fixture
components.
However, modular fixtures are used when low to medium cutting forces are applied due to stiffness limitations.
Furthermore, dedicated fixtures are preferred to modular fixtures when large volumes of components are produced

due to higher productivity and lower maintenance.
7.3.3 General‐Purpose Workholders
In many cases, the part's shape and the required machining operations permit the use of versatile workholders such
as vices, collets, or chucks. These workholding devices can adapt to various machines and a wide range of parts.
Due to their nonspecific nature, they offer the flexibility to be employed repeatedly for different or small‐scale
production runs. The cost of these workholders is typically spread over several years and may not significantly
impact job–cost calculations. However, because of their general‐purpose design, they demand a higher level of
operator vigilance and precision to maintain consistency and accuracy. Consequently, they are not the preferred
choice for extended production runs.
7.3.4 Workholding System Selection
As shown previously, permanent fixturing, modular fixturing, and general‐purpose workholding devices present
different characteristics that make them suitable for specific production types. For instance, permanent fixtures are
adequate for large production volumes. Longer production runs require fixtures to be in service longer, and
production speeds are generally higher; thus, higher investment in an efficient fixture device is justified.
The main characteristics of these workholding solutions are qualitatively described in Table 7.3, which gives a
general idea about which type of production may apply. As shown in the table, permanent solutions present higher
investment costs than modular fixtures or general‐purpose workholding devices. However, their accuracy and
productivity are higher, which may result in lower production costs.
Besides this qualitative description, the selection of the proper fixturing solution may require a break‐even analysis
to select the most economical solution while ensuring part specifications. For this purpose, three cost terms are
considered: initial fixturing cost (Cini), setup cost (Csetup), and running cost (Crun).
The initial fixturing cost (Cini) is estimated by calculating the design expenses and the cost of all fixture
components including the cost of assembling. This cost is shared among all the expected parts to be produced
under this workholding/fixturing device (Nlife). Additional costs are related to the setup process (Csetup) for every
batch operation such as inspection, calibration, cleaning, and greasing operations. This cost is shared among the
parts expected to be produced in a batch (Nbatch). Finally, the workholding/fixturing device may present a running
cost (Crun) related to loading and unloading activities, power actuators, etc. Very often, the running cost includes
the machining and nonproductive costs since the workholding selection may influence cutting tool trajectories,
cutting parameters, etc. Therefore, the total fixturing cost per machined part can be formulated as follows:
The following example illustrates the fixturing selection among three tooling alternatives: (i) a modular fixture; (ii)
a permanent fixture; and (iii) a permanent fixture actuated by hydraulic power. The costs of each term for each
alternative and the break‐even analysis to select the most adequate one are presented as follows.
 
Running cost (Crun). The running costs vary among the alternatives due to changes in the machining cycle
time and power consumption. For this example, it is assumed that a running cost of $5 for the modular
fixture, $4 for the permanent fixture, and $3 for the permanent hydraulic fixture.

general‐purpose devices. Relative comparison for cost, accuracy, and productivity.

Figure 7.19 Break‐even analysis for the example presented.
Setup cost (Csetup). The permanent fixture is the quickest to set up, followed by the power–workholding
fixture, which is slightly slower due to hydraulic connections, and finally, the modular fixture, which is the
slowest due to the assembly required. For this example, it is assumed a setup cost of $400, $160, and $200 for
the modular, permanent, and hydraulic fixtures, respectively.
Lot size (Nbatch). The lot size remains consistent across all three options. For this example, it is assumed that
each batch contains 200 parts.
Initial tooling cost (Cini). The modular fixture is the most cost‐effective because its components can be reused,
followed by the permanent fixture and the hydraulic fixture, which is the most expensive option. For this
example, the initial tooling costs are assumed to be $920, $3,500, and $6,000 for the modular, permanent, and
hydraulic fixtures, respectively.
Total quantity produced over the tooling's lifespan (Nlife). The analysis is conducted considering up to 10,000
production volumes.
According to the preceding assumptions, the break‐even analysis for the three fixturing alternatives is shown in
Figure 7.19. Modular fixtures are unquestionably the most affordable option for a single run of 200 units. The
permanent fixturing is ideal if 10 runs (2,000 parts) are anticipated. The hydraulic fixturing device would be the
ideal option for orders of 3,000 parts or more. This example assumes that every noneconomic element is equal in
all cases.

7.4 Permanent and Modular Fixtures
7.4.1 Basic Fixture Elements
A permanent and modular fixture are commonly composed of similar elements, and they can be mainly grouped in
the following categories:
 
Structural components. Clamping cubes, blocks, and bases are used as the body of the fixture system where
the rest of the components are mounted. These elements are commonly made of nodular cast iron to impair
properties such as vibration–damping, torsion–resistance, and high stability. The surfaces are precision
ground for proper placement of support and clamping devices. Elements for positioning and quick change are
commonly included, and they can be easily mounted on a machine pallet. Other structural elements can be
used to locate the clamping and locating systems at the correct part surfaces. For instance, base plates (T‐slot
or hole threads), angle plates, consoles, position blocks, V‐blocks, etc. (Figure 7.20).
Figure 7.20 Basic structural elements for modular/permanent fixtures.

Rest pads. Rest pads are used to form a plane where the workpiece will lay. Rest pad material is hardened and
ground for accurate positioning. When clamping rough surfaces such as casting and forging surfaces, serrated
and hardened pads are recommended. In some cases, the rest of the pads are self‐aligned, which means that
they can be slightly tilted to accommodate nonhorizontal surfaces with respect to the base of the pad (Figure
7.21). Different types of rest pads are used to contact the workpiece and act as seats or stops (Figure 7.22).
Locating pins. Locating pins are used to locate the workpiece on the fixture, and their function is similar to
rest pads; they provide a surface contact to position the part and lock the corresponding part movements to
provide location repeatability. Locating pins are cylinders with dimensions and types of heads depending on
the application (Figure 7.22). For instance, bullet or chamfered head pins provide ease of loading the
workpiece, and long pins are used to lock eight potential movements of the part. Noncylindrical shapes such
as diamond pins are used to lock only two potential movements, for instance, to locate a slot.

Clamping devices. To hold the part in position during machining, clamping elements are applied. A large
variety of clamping devices can be mounted on fixtures. Figure 7.23a, b shows some clamping devices
commonly applied in fixturing. As shown in the figure, toggles must be applied with care since the clamping
force is limited, although they provide a fast and easy clamping method. Other mechanical clamps, such as
down‐hold clamps or centering clamping mandrels, present 3–10 times more clamping force. For automated
fixtures, pneumatic and hydraulic systems are applied. The pneumatic systems are more economical and
faster but provide low clamping forces (2–3 kN maximum), need more space to be implemented, and present
low reliability due to the compressibility of air. Unlike pneumatic actuated clamps, hydraulic actuated clamps
exert higher clamping forces (above 5 kN), and they are more compact and reliable. Although hydraulic
systems can be applied for thin‐section components, pneumatic fixtures may be preferred.

(b) different types of clamps.

Supports. Auxiliary devices such as support blocks, adjustable leveling supports, bedding supports or
additional rest pads may be also added to stabilize the workpiece during cutting, avoiding deformations
(Figure 7.24).
To illustrate the application of the preceding listed elements, Figure 7.25 presents two types of modular fixtures
and the components required, according to a well‐known manufacturer of fixture systems (Halder 2024).

7.4.2 Fixturing Examples
Figures 7.26 and 7.27 show examples of modular fixtures for locating and clamping complex parts for machining
operations. As it is shown, different types of basic elements such as T‐slot base plates, clamping cubes, down thrust
clamps, rest pads, locating pins, and manual clamping systems can be mounted to configure structures that are able
to locate and clamp different geometries in a fast and efficient way.
7.5 General Purpose of Workholding Devices for Turning
Depending on the size, weight, diameter, shape, and location of the workpiece on the lathe, various general‐
purpose workholding systems are utilized in turning. They can be classified as chucks and plates, collets and
mandrels, devices for holding between centers, and rests.
7.5.1 Chucks and Plates
Workpieces with a length‐to‐diameter (L/D) ratio lower than four may be clamped in a chuck quickly and rigidly
without the need for additional support of the free end. There are different types of chucks commonly used in shop
floor such as three‐jaw self‐centering chucks, four‐jaw independent chucks, magnetic chucks, and face plates.
7.5.1.1 Three‐Jaw Self‐Centering Chucks
The three jaws installed in the three slots of the chuck can be simultaneously adjusted by rotating any of the three
pinions using a chuck key (Figure 7.28a). This type of chuck is well suited for securing and rotating regularly
shaped workpieces, such as round or hexagonal rods, along the lathe's axis. However, it cannot effectively hold
workpieces with irregular shapes. The advantage here lies in the quick and straightforward clamping process, as all

three jaws move simultaneously. As a drawback, its position repeatability is low compared to other general‐
purpose workholding systems.
7.5.1.2 Four‐Jaw Independent Chucks
This chuck features four jaws, and each jaw can be adjusted independently by turning a screw with the assistance
of a chuck key (Figure 7.28b). It allows for precise positioning of the jaws to accommodate irregularly shaped
workpieces. However, it does require more time to align the workpiece with the lathe's axis. The chuck's face is
marked with concentric circles to facilitate the rapid centering of the workpiece.
7.5.1.3 Magnetic Chucks
The magnetic chuck relies on the magnetic field generated by an electromagnet housed within it to hold the
workpiece in place (Figure 7.29a). Magnets inside the chuck can be adjusted to secure or release the work. This
type of chuck is only suitable for workpieces made of magnetic materials. It is especially useful for very small,
thin, and lightweight workpieces that a standard chuck cannot effectively hold. However, its use is limited to
machining under very low cutting forces.
7.5.1.4 Face Plates
A face plate is employed to secure large, heavy, and irregularly shaped workpieces that cannot be conveniently
accommodated by other types of chucks (Figure 7.29b). It takes the form of a circular disc that is bored out and
threaded to fit onto the lathe spindle's nose. The face plate is equipped with radial plain and T‐slots, allowing
workpieces to be secured using bolts and clamps.

7.5.2 Collets and Mandrels
For clamping small parts using the external surface, an interesting clamping option is the use of a collet and a
collet chuck. The collet, a cylindrical bushing, is part of the collet chuck. The collet presents slots that have been
carved lengthwise in spring steel (Figure 7.30) and serve to grip the work with high accuracy when the collet is
inserted into the collet chuck. Although collets are used for holding small bars with different regular geometries
(cylindrical, square, hexagonal, etc.), in turn, similar holding systems can be found for holding solid mills in
milling.
For internal clamping, chucks with internal jaws can be used. However, when small internal surfaces are used for
clamping, mandrels can be the best choice. This type of workholding device expands its cylindrical surface to
compress and clamp the workpiece over a hole (Figure 7.31). For instance, tubes can be held using a mandrel
mounted on the spindle lathe on one side and a live center at the opposite side of the lathe. Under this workholding
scheme, the whole length of the workpiece can be machined.
7.5.3 Devices for Holding between Centers
A popular method of holding a workpiece in a lathe when accuracy and repeatability are required is between
centers. Long workpieces (shafts and axles) with an L/D ratio above four are turned between centers. Figure 7.32
shows an example of a workpiece held between centers. The workholding system is based on centers, a carrier and
a catch plate.

Figure 7.31 Mandrel for internal clamping in turning operations.

Figure 7.32 Holding a workpiece between centers.
There are two types of centers: live centers and dead centers. Live centers have internal bearings that make the
center rotate with the workpiece. This type of center is usually placed at the tailstock. Dead centers stay stationary
while the conical surface of the center and the workpiece are rubbing. Dead centers may be placed at the tailstock
or the headstock of the lathe. In the latter case, since the dead center rotates with the work, they may also be named
as live centers. The catch plate is used to drive the workpiece during the cutting process. Catch plates are designed
with U‐slots or elliptical slots to receive the bent tail of the carrier. The carrier is used to transmit the driving force
of the spindle to the work through the catch plates. The work is held inside the eye of the carrier and tightened by a
screw.
7.5.4 Rests
A rest is a mechanical tool utilized to provide support for a lengthy and slender workpiece, whether it is being
turned between centers or held by a chuck. Positioned at an intermediate point, its purpose is to prevent the
workpiece from bending and to counteract vibrations induced by cutting forces. Two distinct types of rests are
commonly used: the steady rest and the follower rest (Figure 7.33a, b).

Figure 7.33 Common steady rest (a) and follower rest (b) for shop‐floor turning operations.
Source: Courtesy of Probois Machinoutils.
The steady rest can be adjusted to slide along the lathe bedways, securing itself at the desired location where the
workpiece requires support. Comprising three jaws, it can be tailored to the workpiece's diameter. Machining
operations are conducted within the span extending from the headstock to the point where the rest provides
support.
Conversely, the follower rest presents two adjustable jaws designed to uphold the workpiece. It is affixed to the
rear end of the carriage and, during machining, moves in tandem with the carriage itself. As a result, it closely
follows the tool, offering continuous support to the workpiece throughout its entire length. Both steady and
follower rests can also be automated and operated by hydraulic or pneumatic power (Figure 7.34).

7.6 General Purpose of Workholding Devices for Milling
7.6.1 Vices
Vices are the most employed devices for securing workpieces on the milling machine table, allowing for efficient
loading and unloading. Vices come in three primary types:
 
1. Plain vice. The plain vice is directly affixed to the milling machine table and is the prevailing choice for plain
milling operations that involve substantial material removal. Its compact design ensures that the workpiece
remains close to the table, minimizing the risk of vibrations. Workpieces are clamped between the stationary
and movable jaws, and specialized jaws may be used for securing irregularly shaped workpieces (Figure
7.35).
2. Swivel vices. Swivel vices are employed for milling angular surfaces in relation to straight ones without the
need to remove the workpiece from the vice. They feature a circular base for a rotation movement and are
fastened to the machine tool table using T‐bolts or similar fasteners (Figure 7.36a).
3. Universal vices. Universal vices possess the ability to swivel in a horizontal plane similar to swivel vices and
can also be tilted to assume various vertical positions for angled cuts. They facilitate the milling of surfaces at

different inclinations without the necessity of removing the workpiece (Figure 7.36b).
7.6.2 Work Directly Mounted on Table
With the aid of slots, T‐bolts, clamps, and nuts, heavy or oddly shaped work that cannot be supported by ordinary
holding devices can be directly mounted and clamped on the machine tool table. There are numerous different
types of clamping systems that can be directly mounted on the machine tool table. One of the most common types
is based on step blocks, nuts, and studs that can be easily installed using the T‐slots in the machine tool table as
shown in Figure 7.37. Figure 7.38 shows a common set of components used for clamping workpieces directly on
the machine tool table.

Other popular clamping devices to be mounted on the machine tool table are clamping jaws. Heavy‐duty clamping
jaws present higher clamping force, height, and width. Low‐height clamping jaws, also called bulles, can be used
for clamping short parts. Similarly, mini bulles can be applied when only a small portion of the part can be used for
clamping since they do not protrude above the workpiece. Figure 7.39 shows some examples of clamping jaws and
their assembly with the workpiece.
Additionally, other devices used directly on the machine tool table are (Figure 7.40):
 
Angle plates (Figure 7.40a). When work surfaces are to be milled at right angles to another face, angle plates
are used to support the work.
Vee‐blocks (Figure 7.40b). Vee‐blocks are used for holding cylindrical workpieces on the machine table in
which keyways, slots and flats are to be machined.

7.6.3 Rotary Tables and Magnetic Plates
Rotary tables are circular, movable flat surface with a worm wheel mechanism to turn the table at a specific angle
(Figure 7.41a). This system is commonly used in manual milling to machine circular slots or to provide a fourth
axis to the machine tool. The workpiece is clamped in the rotary table using clamping devices such as step blocks,
bulles, etc. The rotary table can be positioned vertically or horizontally according to the purpose of the machining
operation.
Tilt milling tables are also an interesting fixture for milling operations since they can set up the workpiece at a
specific angle. The table has machined T‐slots along the length and can swing up to 45° on either side (Figure
7.41b).
For light milling operations of ferromagnetic workpieces that present difficulties for clamping using conventional
workholding devices, magnetic clamping plates may be an option. However, the clamping force is limited, and it
depends on the surface contact between the workpiece and the plate. Figure 7.42a shows a magnetic plate and
Figure 7.42b shows a machining operation on a workpiece clamped using a magnetic plate.

7.7 Workholding Drawing Representation
To create a common language for defining and locating symbols in fixture design, various initiatives for
standardization can be found in the literature. Although not widely adopted, the French standard under the norm
NF E04‐013: 2015 (AFNOR 2015) proposes a symbology to communicate workpiece holding schemes in technical
drawings that can be useful for process planners. The symbology used in this norm defines the position of locators
and clamps and the part movements that are locked by each element. The basic symbol used is shown in Figure
7.43, where the following characteristics are identified: technology type, type of surface, function of technological
element, and the type of contact on the surface.
The technology type refers to the type of position or clamping element. The following types are distinguished:
fixed support, fixed centering, a system with clamping, a system with concentric clamping, irreversible fixed
support, reversible support, and sliding positioning. Table 7.4 shows the symbols for each technology type.

The type of surface refers to the condition of the surface where the position/clamping element is placed. The
following types are distinguished (Table 7.5): surface machined and surface raw.
The function of the technological element refers to the function of the position or clamping element. The main
functions are exact positioning, which refers to locators or position elements that position the workpiece in the
space, and clamping, where the elements exert a clamping force to hold and prevent the movement of the part due
to machining forces. Additional functions are also identified such as datum origin, definition of axis,
prepositioning, and part holding against vibrations and deformations. Table 7.6 shows the symbol that identifies
each group of functions. Note that the representation of the symbol changes according to the drawing view, and
projection views are defined where the element is in a top view.
The type of contact on the surface refers to the geometrical characteristics of the contact between the
position/clamping element and the surface where it is placed. The following types are distinguished (Table 7.7):
flat, curved, serrated, free, pan, swing bar, vee, fixed center, and turning center.
Additionally, Table 7.8 shows some physical realizations of these types of contacts in fixturing systems. Table 7.9
also shows a physical realization and associated symbols for concentric and radial locations.

hours per batch and the purchase of the system is around $2,000. The second fixturing option reduces the time
of loading, clamping, and unloading the part. The total time per part under the semi‐automated system is
estimated to be 10 seconds while the manual system requires 75 seconds per part. Calculate the break‐even

Geometry Analysis and Machining Operations Sequence
8.1 Introduction
After the part drawing has been appropriately examined from a geometric point of view (described in Chapter 2)
and primary manufacturing processes have been selected and planned (described in Chapters 3–6), machining
process plans related to secondary manufacturing processes can then be defined. Process planning in machining
requires the execution of the tasks listed in Figure 8.1, which ends with the definition of an adequate process plan
subjected to economical and technical constraints (Zamanillo 1993).
This chapter covers the first four steps involved in machining process planning: (i) geometrical analysis of the part;
(ii) identification of surfaces, machining volumes and operations; (iii) determination of machining processes and
operations sequence; and (iv) selection of locating surfaces and workholding devices. A practical example is
provided at the end of the chapter to illustrate the methodology proposed to conduct these four machining planning
tasks.
The rest of the steps to complete the machining process‐planning methodology are covered in this book in the
subsequent chapters. Chapter 9 presents the selection of machine tools and cutting tools, and the selection of
proper cutting parameters are explained in detail in Chapter 10. Chapter 11 shows the geometric validation of
process plans through tolerance charts. Chapter 12 presents computer numerical control (CNC) programming
fundamentals, and finally, Chapter 14 shows the details for machining time and cost estimations.
8.2 Definition of Terms
The following terms are used throughout this chapter:
 
Job. A job in machining is the collection of all the operations that must be carried out on a single machine
tool. A job may be a machining center, a CNC lathe, or any other machine tool.
Subjob or setup. A subjob is the term used to describe a set of operations that are conducted under the same
fixturing. A machine's fixturing can be changed for a second set of operations and both subjobs can be
produced under the same machine, that is, the same job.
Machining operation. The term machining operation refers to a simple task carried out with a single tool over
the course of multiple cuts or passes. An operation, for instance, is the cylindrical turning of a workpiece on a
lathe. Figure 8.2 illustrates the concepts of operations, subjobs, and jobs in machining processes.

Figure 8.1 Process planning methodology for machining operations.
Tool approach direction (TAD). The TAD of a machining feature refers to the tool direction for machining the
feature without being obstructed by any part of the workpiece. A machining feature can have more than one
TAD, and those features with the same TAD are candidates to be produced under the same setup/subjob. For
machining a prismatic part, six possible TAD cases can be found: +X, −X, +Y, −Y, +Z, −Z. In the case of a
turning part, four possible cases are available: +X, −X, +Z, −Z. Figure 8.3a, b shows two examples and their
corresponding TADs for each feature to be machined.

Figure 8.2 Definition of job, subjob, and operation.

Figure 8.3 Tool approach directions (TADs) for some machined features in a revolution part (a) and
prismatic part (b).
Datum surface. A surface of a workpiece that is used as a datum (reference) for controlling the position and
orientation of another surface produced by a manufacturing process.
Locating surface. A surface of a workpiece that is used to locate the workpiece relative to a machine tool. This
surface is also named as setup datum or locating datum. A datum surface may or may not be a locating
surface.
8.3 Geometry Analysis
The first step in machining process planning is to analyze the part design to evaluate the manufacturability of the
part and the fulfillment of all specifications. Note that the part may come from a primary manufacturing process
such as casting or bulk forming processes, and some specifications may have already been reached at this stage
(hence, there is no need for machining). The analysis of the geometry should consider the following actions:
 
Check if dimensions and tolerances can be uniquely interpretable and if some information is missing.
Determine which surfaces require machining and which ones can be kept from the previous manufacturing
process (casting, preform dimensions, etc.).
Determine if there are available processes to reach dimensions and tolerances defined on drawings.
Analyze if additional processes, such as treatments or auxiliary operations, are required.
To elaborate a correct geometry analysis, the following methodology is proposed (Zamanillo 1993):
 
1. Analysis of material and initial workpiece geometry. Dimensions and tolerances of the initial workpiece
should be analyzed to check if some specifications are already obtained.
2. Numbering surfaces. To distinguish between machined and raw surfaces that may be not necessarily
machined, machined surfaces are numbered as 1, 2, 3, etc., while raw surfaces are numbered with the prefix
“R” (from “raw surface”) as R1, R2, R3, etc.

3. Analysis of surface specifications:
 
Dimensional specifications. Dimensions of size such as pin or hole diameters, width of a slot, etc., are
intrinsic specifications. When geometrical product specifications (GPS) are not applied, ± dimensional
specifications are commonly used to relate one geometrical feature with another one, and ambiguity
issues may arise (refer to Chapter 2). These dimensional specifications are, in fact, extrinsic
specifications that would have been specified using geometrical tolerances such as profile or position
tolerances if GPS had been applied. It is important to distinguish between intrinsic and extrinsic
dimensional/geometrical specifications since the extrinsic ones will have a significant influence on the
machining operation sequence.
Geometrical tolerances. Two types of geometrical tolerances should be identified: intrinsic specifications
and extrinsic specifications. Intrinsic specifications depend only on the geometrical feature itself, and
thus, there is no datum surface required. These are form specifications such as straightness, flatness,
roundness, cylindricity, etc. On the contrary, extrinsic specifications require a datum surface. Some of
these geometric specifications are parallelism, perpendicularity, run‐out, coaxiality, etc. Extrinsic
specifications should be clearly identified at this stage since they have a direct impact on setup
definitions and precedence constraints.
Surface roughness specifications. Surface roughness values should be identified to define if finishing and
high‐quality operations are required.
4. Analysis of other specifications. Other specifications should be also identified such as heat treatments,
chemical treatments, and special surface roughness requirements.
8.4 Machining Volumes
8.4.1 Determination of Machining Volumes, Features, and Tool Approach Directions (TADs)
Material volumes to be removed can be identified by knowing the workpiece dimensions previous to machining
and the dimensions of the final machined part. The total material to be removed can be divided into subvolumes,
which are those volumes that are potentially eliminated with different operations. These subvolumes are related to
machining features that can be identified in the final part facilitating the subsequent link to machining operations.
For each machining subvolume, all possible TADs are also identified.
Common machining features that are found in prismatic (milling subvolumes) and revolution parts (turning
subvolumes) are defined as follows (Ma et al. 2020; Mokhtar and Xu 2011):
 
Turning:
 
One‐face feature:

Cylinder
Through hole
Taper (internal and external)
Chamfer and fillets (internal and external)
Two‐face feature:

Figures 8.4 and 8.5 show some examples of these machining features and associated subvolumes for both milling
and turning features.
8.4.2 Linking Machining Features and Potential Machining Operations
The possible machining operations that could be applied to obtain each machining feature/subvolume are listed. At
this point, only operations compatibility with the volume to be removed are taken into account and tolerances or
surface roughness specifications are not considered. These potential operations will generate different process
plans to be evaluated. Table 8.1 shows common machining features and potential machining operations applied.
Some examples of machining operations in milling and turning are also illustrated in Figure 8.6.

Figure 8.4 Example of machining features and machining volumes in milling operations.

Figure 8.5 Example of machining features and machining volumes in turning operations.
Common turning and milling operations are shown in Figure 8.6 for different turning and milling features.
It should be noted that machining operations may be also classified as roughing, semi‐finishing, and finishing
operations. When a large volume of material should be removed, a first roughing operation using high depth of
cuts and feed rates increases the material removal rate reducing machining costs. This operation keeps some
material on the workpiece to be removed through a semi‐finishing or finishing operation to reach surface
roughness and dimensional tolerances. Thus, the machining volume to be removed and the final quality of the part
should be taken into account to determine if different roughing and finishing operations are needed. As a general
view, the following guidelines are given:
 
Roughing. Operation that gets close to the final shape of the part, removing the maximum quantity of material
at high depth of cuts and feed rates. In some situations, after roughing operations other operations may be not
needed if geometric specifications are already fulfilled. Common values obtained in this type of machining
operations are:
Surface roughness 12.5 μm ≥ Ra ≥ 5 μm
Dimensional tolerances 12 ≤ IT ≤ 16

Finishing. Operation that generates the final surface with higher accuracy than previous operations. Common
values obtained in this type of machining operations are:
Surface roughness  3.2 μm ≥ Ra ≥ 0.4 μm
Dimensional tolerances  6 ≤ IT ≤ 8
Note that if higher dimensional or surface roughness quality is needed, additional machining processes should be
added after conventional machining operations. These operations are grinding, honing, lapping, or polishing and
they can achieve values of surface roughness from 0.25 μm to 0.01 μm and dimensional tolerances from IT6 to
IT01.
Table 8.2 shows a global view of machining process capabilities to facilitate the machining process selection.
8.5 Definition and Sequence of Machining Operations
8.5.1 Grouping Features According to Tool Approach Direction (TAD)
The main goal of determining the machining sequence is to minimize the number of setups and tool changes,
which means lower costs and higher dimensional quality. The first step in sequencing machining operations is
grouping the operations according to their TADs to minimize the number of setups required (Liu and Wang 2007).
To sort the different operations and setups, precedence constraints are studied in the next step. If there is no
explicit precedence constraint to order the operations/setups, those with bigger volumes to be machined are
conducted first, which usually means higher cutting forces and heat that may result in deformation issues.

8.5.2 Precedence Constraints
Precedence constraints may be divided into hard constraints or soft constraints (Faheem et al. 1998; Mokhtar and
Xu 2011). Hard constraints are precedence relationships that must be followed or an infeasible process plan will
result. Soft constraints describe manufacturing preferences that are not necessary to be followed but which would
increase the quality of the plan in terms of costs or dimensional quality.
Some precedence constraints that are classified as hard constraints are related to manufacturing interactions.
Manufacturing interactions can be fixture–feature, tool–feature, and tool–fixture interaction. Some typical
examples of manufacturing interactions are presented below:
 
Fixture–feature interaction. Fixture–feature interactions occur when machining a feature may destroy other
features that are needed for proper clamping in a subsequent machining operation. Figure 8.7a shows an
example of fixture–feature interaction where the slot should be machined before the boss to facilitate fixturing
when machining the slot. A similar interaction is shown in Figure 8.7b where the angle cut of the feature
prevents holding the part in a subsequent operation.
Tool–feature interaction. This interaction occurs when machining one feature destroys a condition required by
the tool used in a subsequent machining operation. Figure 8.7c shows an example of tool–feature interaction
where the drilling operation cannot be conducted correctly due to the chamfer previously machined.
Tool–fixture interaction. This interaction occurs when the fixture and the tool used in the operation may
collide during cutting (Figure 8.7d). In some cases, a proper sequence of operations may facilitate or avoid
this type of interaction.
Additionally, to manufacturing interactions, other hard constraints are listed in the following:
 
Roughing/finishing operations. Surfaces that are machined using roughing and finishing operations, obviously
require roughing operations to be conducted first.
Drilling/threading. Threaded holes require first drilling operations to conduct later threading or tapping
operations.
Drilling/boring/reaming. To increase the quality of a hole, drilling operations (IT13–IT9) are conducted first,
and then boring operations or reaming operations (IT9–IT6) may be applied.

Figure 8.7 Different types of interactions: (a) and (b) fixture–feature interaction; (c) tool–feature interaction; and
(d) tool–fixture interaction.
On the contrary, good manufacturing practices provide guidelines for defining machining sequencing that may
result in soft precedence constraints. Some typical examples of these recommended precedence constraints
classified as soft constraints are shown below (Faheem et al. 1998; Mokhtar and Xu 2011):
 
Drilling/counterboring/countersinking. Counterboring and countersinking operations are conducted after
drilling operations. If threading or reaming operations are also needed, they are conducted after
counterboring/countersinking operations.
Holes in thin machined walls. When drilling a hole in a thin wall that is produced after a milling/slot
operation, drilling is conducted before milling to avoid deformation of the thin wall (Figure 8.8a).
Transition features (e.g., chamfer, fillets). Machining a transition feature is done after machining the main
features that interact with it (Figure 8.8b).
Interacting features:
 
Nesting/nested features. When one feature is nested into another one, the top feature (nesting feature) is
machined before the bottom feature (nested feature). Under this strategy, air‐cutting is minimized, and
chip removal is facilitated (Figure 8.8c). This is the case when drilling and milling should be sequenced
(Figure 8.8d). Additionally, under this strategy burr formation is minimized.
Side approach cutting. When two features are interacting and they are not nested/nesting features, the
feature with easier tool access (side access instead of plunging) is machined first. In Figure 8.8e, both

open pockets with side tool access are machined before the third pocket.
Interacting without side access. If two features are interacting and they are not nested/nesting features
and there is no side access, the feature with greater depth is machined first (Figure 8.8f).
Figure 8.8 Examples of recommended precedence constraints: (a) hole before slot machining to avoid deformation
in thin walls; (b) fillets after main feature; (c) nesting features before nested features; (d) milling before drilling;
(e) side accessed features first; and (f) features no nested with no side access, greater depth features are machined
first.
8.5.3 Feature–Datum Interactions. Critical Extrinsic Relationships
As shown earlier, precedence constraints are extracted from manufacturing interactions such as fixture–feature,
tool–feature, and tool–fixture interactions. Additionally to these interactions, feature–datum interactions are also
relevant for defining a proper machining process sequence.
When analyzing a feature–datum interaction where two features present a dimensional or geometrical tolerance
relation, three main options can be considered (Bansal et al. 2008): machine both features in the same setup; use
one feature as the setup datum and machine the other; or use an intermediate setup datum to machine the two
features in different setups.
Employing the same setup ensures that the differences in inaccuracy between various surfaces are solely caused by
the limits of the machine–tool (such as the straightness of the axis, thermal distortions, etc.). Any error due to the
workholding system (e.g., a calibration error of the fixture coordinate system) is added to all machined surfaces
and, thus, the error between them is canceled. Thus, machining both features under the same setup presents the

highest possible quality in a machining process. Feature–datum interactions where a tight tolerance is needed will
require this setup. These cases are called critical extrinsic relationships.
An example is shown in Figure 8.9 to illustrate this critical extrinsic relationship. According to the drawing,
surfaces B and C must be perpendicular with a tolerance of Ø0.02 mm, which is a tight machining tolerance. Both
surfaces should be machined within the same subjob to ensure high accuracy. If the perpendicular tolerance were
Ø 0.2 mm, then, there is no need to machine both surfaces at the same time, and thus, any sequence would be
feasible. Additionally, since surfaces B, C, and D have the same TAD, all three are machined in the same subjob.
If machining both features under the same setup is not possible, the second‐best alternative in terms of machining
accuracy is using one feature as setup datum (the one indicated in the datum reference frame or the larger feature
among them), which should have been previously machined, and machine the other one (Liu and Huang 2003). A
common example of this situation is machining a hole where a position tolerance applies. In this tolerance type,
the hole should be positioned with respect to some references that define the datum surfaces. These datum surfaces
should be machined in a previous subjob to be used later as locating surfaces when machining the holes. If a tight
tolerance is required and machining both features in the same setup is not possible, this option should be applied
and a hard constraint is imposed.

Finally, if the datum–feature interaction does not require a tight tolerance, a third option where both features are
machined under different setups indifferently may be used. Under this scheme, a tolerance stack‐up arises
increasing manufacturing variability.
To establish if the dimensional and geometrical relationships between surfaces can be obtained in multiple subjobs
or if the same subjob should be applied to ensure specifications, common machining errors and setup errors from
different workholding systems are provided in Table 8.3. More details about setup and machining errors can be
found in (Halevi and Weill 1995; Murty 2005). Specifications lower than the workholding accuracy means that
those surfaces should be machined in the same subjob to avoid workholding setup errors (i.e., they should be
considered as critical extrinsic relationships). It should be highlighted that multiple setups for carrying out
different machining operations would result in an unfavorable accumulation of tolerances. Chapter 11 will show
how to estimate the tolerance stackup of these setup errors to validate the process plan according to the design
tolerances.
8.5.4 Machining Sequence Diagram
Once the geometry of the part has been analyzed, the machining operations have been grouped according to their
TADs and their precedence constraints have been identified, a diagram to gather all relevant information is drawn
as follows:
 
Step 1. Add all surfaces/operations identified. The first step in drawing the diagram is to introduce all
surfaces/operations as columns. Since these columns refer to the machining operations that produce the
surfaces, those surfaces produced with the same machining operation are introduced in the same column.
These surfaces are grouped according to their TADs.

Figure 8.10 Machining sequence diagram template.
Step 2. Include extrinsic relationships. In this diagram, all extrinsic relationships between surfaces/operations
are included. For instance, positional tolerances, perpendicularity and parallelism tolerances, dimensional
tolerances between features, etc.
Step 3. Add hard and soft precedence constraints. At the bottom of the diagram, each precedence constraint
identified is graphically indicated using an arrow that indicates the order between operations. Soft constraints
are added as dashed arrows to indicate that this precedence is not mandatory. For the case of hard precedence
constraints, solid lines are used.
Step 4. Identify critical extrinsic relationships. Those surfaces with extrinsic tolerances that are too tight may
require to be machined under the same setup. Highlighting this type of relationship may help to define
properly the machining sequence. The identified critical extrinsic relationships are illustrated in the diagram
by a black line below the technological precedence.
Once the diagram is built, all the information presented is analyzed and the columns are exchanged to comply with
the precedence constraints, the TADs, and the critical extrinsic relationships. For instance, in the case of hard
precedence constraints, all arrows should be pointing to the right to illustrate that all precedence constraints are
correct. Then, the diagram is used to identify jobs, subjobs, and the final machining operations sequence. As a
general rule, the number of jobs and subjobs should always be minimized and the higher machining volumes

should be machined first. Figure 8.10 overviews the parts of the diagram to be elaborated for a correct machining
sequence analysis.
8.6 Definition of Locating Surfaces and Workholding
Once the jobs, subjobs, and machining operations sequence has been defined, it is necessary to determine the
locating surfaces and the corresponding workholding devices for each subjob. Since not all surfaces may be
available for locating, a tolerance stackup may arise. This is a critical issue since the process plan candidate may
result in an unfeasible plan due to an excessive tolerance accumulation. In that case, a step backward should be
taken to analyze other process plan candidates that minimize this tolerance stackup issue. Note that Chapter 11
presents in detail tolerance stackup calculations and process plan validation.
To define the locating surfaces and workholding systems, the following methodology is presented (Zamanillo
1993):
 
1. Determine the setup datum (i.e., locating surfaces). For each subjob, it is important to identify the
dimensional and geometrical relationships (liaisons) between the surfaces machined in the current subjob and
surfaces obtained from previous subjobs or previous manufacturing processes (i.e., raw surfaces previously
obtained from primary manufacturing processes). Three cases may be found (Romero et al. 2012):
1. The existing liaisons provide enough information about the part movements to be locked to conduct the
machining operation. The surfaces that define these liaisons will be considered as locating surfaces.
2. The existing liaisons exceed the necessary number of liaisons. Then, from all the surfaces that define the
liaisons, the ones that are more critical and can guarantee the isostatic location of the workpiece are
defined as locating surfaces. If there is no possible way to ensure all liaisons due to tolerance stackup
issues, the subjob is divided into different subjobs.
3. The existing liaisons between the current subjob and previous ones are not enough to define the locating
surfaces. In that case, it will be analyzed both previous and subsequent subjobs to establish new liaisons
between the current subjob and the previous ones that could define the appropriate datum surfaces. If
there are no new liaisons to define the locating surfaces, convenient surfaces to use conventional
workholding systems are selected.
2. Determine the clamping surfaces and the fixturing method. Clamping surfaces are usually defined according
to the locating surfaces by following the guidelines shown in Chapter 7. Additional supports may be added to
avoid deformation during machining. The fixture device or fixturing elements used to locate and clamp the
part are defined according to the tooling available. The accuracy of different fixturing methods (Table 8.3)
should be considered to ensure the geometrical and dimensional tolerances of the diagram.
3. Represent graphically the fixturing method. Symbols according to international norms (French Standard NF
E04‐013: 2015 is commonly used [AFNOR 2015]) are used to represent the locating and clamping method.
8.7 Practical Example
The proposed methodology is applied to the case study shown in Figure 8.11. The part is assumed to be cast using
a sand‐casting process with a machining allowance of 3 mm and a casting variability of ±0.5 mm. After casting,
machining operations are required to reach the design tolerances from the technical drawing. The part is made of
aluminum AISI SC64D (SAE 326), the general tolerance is ±0.5 mm and the general surface roughness is 1.6 μm
to all machined features and 12.5 μm to casting features. It is assumed that the external surfaces of the part that do
not require tight tolerances are kept from casting.

Figure 8.11 Practical example. Part drawing.

Figure 8.12 Numbering of surfaces. The datum letter used in the drawing is shown in parentheses.
For this case study, the proposed methodology is applied and it is discussed in the following.
a) Geometry analysis
The initial workpiece is a preform from a casting process with 3 mm machining allowance. For this case study, it is
considered that surfaces from R1 to R4 (Figure 8.12) are directly obtained from casting and do not require
machining.
All surfaces are numerated except those that have been previously numerated as raw surfaces. Figure 8.12 shows
the numbering of the surfaces for this case study indicating in parenthesis the datum letter used in the drawing.
All dimensional and geometrical specifications are reviewed and included in Table 8.4.

Observations: All surfaces with a surface roughness of 1.6 μm require finishing operations.
a The datum letter used in the drawing is shown in parentheses.
b) Machining volumes, operations and TADs

After the analysis of part geometry, the machining volumes shown in Figure 8.13 can be identified. As it can be
seen, surfaces 2, 3, and 4 or surfaces 7 and 8 can be considered as one surface since they are generated after one
machining operation. For each identified machining volume, its possible TADs are studied. The defined
subvolumes and TADs are included in Table 8.5.
Since the part is a revolution part, most of the features are machined in a lathe. After turning operations, the part is
finished in a machining center to conduct additional operations that cannot be conducted in a lathe.

a To reach dimensional and geometrical specifications, a boring or reaming operation after drilling is needed.
Table 8.5 shows the machining operations and the corresponding TADs to machine all surfaces/volumes. Note that
the machining allowance is 3 mm and, in this example, it is considered that there is no need to add roughing and

finishing operations, only finishing operations to reach 1.6 μm is enough. Thus, the operations are numbered by the
surface produced but with the letter “f” to indicate finishing operations. If roughing and finishing should be
distinguished, “r” and “f” letters would be used. In the case of surface 5, both drilling and boring operations are
needed to reach the geometrical specifications (
 cannot be reached only with drilling operations), then, 5d
and 5b operations are included for drilling and boring, respectively.
c) Sequence of machining operations
Analyzing the machining operations and the different TADs, the following groups of operations can be identified:
 
Group 1: surfaces 7 and 8, and surface 9. TAD +X, –X and –Z.
Group 2: surface 1 and surfaces 2–4. TAD +X, –X and +Z.
Group 3: surface 5. TAD –X (not lathe).
Group 4: surface 10. TAD +Z and –Z (not lathe).
Surface 6 can be included in group 1 or 2 since its TAD is +Z and –Z.
As a result, two different jobs are needed, a CNC lathe for groups 1 and 2, and a machining center for groups 3 and
4, and a total of four different setups or subjobs.
Furthermore, the following hard and soft precedence constraints are identified:
 
Hard constraints:
 
Surface 5 requires drilling and boring/reaming operation to reach dimensional and geometrical
tolerances. Boring or reaming operations should be conducted after drilling.
Soft constraints:
 
Drilling versus milling: surface 1 before surface 10.
Nesting prior to nested features:
 
Surface 1 before surfaces 2–4.
Surface 9 before surfaces 7 and 8.
Analyzing the feature–datum interactions, the following cases are identified:
 
Case 1. Both features are machined in the same setup due to too tight a tolerance relationship (critical
extrinsic relationships). In this case, a critical extrinsic relationship is highlighted in the diagram:
 
Perpendicularity between surfaces 1 and 2 with a tolerance value of 0.01 mm.
Parallelism between surfaces 7 and 9 with a tolerance value of 0.05 mm.
Coaxiality between surfaces 2 and 6 with a tolerance value of 0.06 mm.
Case 2. One feature (usually the one indicated in the datum reference frame) is machined first and used as
locating datum for the second feature:
 
Position tolerance between surface 5 and the datums 1, 2, and 10 (primary, secondary, and tertiary) with
a tolerance value of 0.1 mm. Surface 5 should be machined after surfaces 1, 2, and 10, and a hard
precedence constraint is drawn.
The dimensional tolerance of 55 ± 0.1 between surfaces 1 and 4 may require attention. Surface 1 should
be machined first or both features should be machined in the same setup. Since surfaces 1 and 4 are
grouped in the same setup, no constraint is added.
Case 3. Both features are machined in different setups. In this case, no precedence constraints are required:
 

Position tolerance between surface 10 and the datums surface 1 and 2 (primary, secondary) with a
tolerance value of 0.2 mm.
Parallelism between surfaces 9 and 1 with a tolerance value of 0.2 mm.
Coaxiality between surfaces 8 and 6 with a tolerance value of 0.2 mm.
Dimensional tolerances that present a high tolerance value: 20 ± 0.2, 55 ± 0.5, and 75 ± 0.3.
At this point, the machining sequence diagram is drawn including all previous information, as shown in Figure
8.14. Note that in the first columns, the raw surfaces are indicated (R1, R2, R3, and R4) together with any other
surface that may be of interest, for instance, surface R9, which refers to surface 9 prior to machining, that is, in its
raw state.
Given the machining sequence diagram, the columns are exchanged to analyze possible alternatives ensuring that
hard precedence constraints are not violated and critical relationships are kept in the same setup. For this case
study, the order of the jobs is defined by the hard constraints. In relation to the subjobs order, at the machining
center job the order is also defined by the hard constraints. However, at the lathe job, it is possible to exchange the
order of both subjobs without violating any hard constraints. Thus, two alternatives in the sequence of subjobs are
found. However, it must be remembered that, as a general rule, if there are no constraints, jobs and subjobs with
higher material removal are recommended to be conducted first. Furthermore, looking at the diagram it can be seen
that a parallelism between surface 9 and surface 1 of 0.2 mm should be ensured, and surface 1 (datum A in the
reference frame) is larger than surface 9 and it would be preferrable to be machined first. As a conclusion, the
diagram shown in Figure 8.14 gives the correct machining sequence. Any other exchange of columns to define an
alternative machining sequence is not possible without violating precedence constraints or critical relationships.

Figure 8.14 Machining sequence diagram of the case study.
Thus, the sequence of operations is as follows (refer to Figure 8.14):
 
Job 1. Lathe
 
Subjob 1: machining operations 1f, 2–3–4f and 6f.
Subjob 2: machining operations 9f, 7–8f.
Job 2. Machining center
 
Subjob 1: machining operation 10f.
Subjob 2: machining operation 5d and 5b.
Note that, if the coaxiality of surface 6, Ø0.06 mm, were higher than the expected setup error (e.g., higher than
0.05–0.1 mm), then surface 6 would not be considered critical surface with surface 2, and it would be preferred to
be machined in subjob 2 since the boring tool would require less overhang.
d) Locating datum and workholding

Subjob 1 in lathe
The first step is to determine the setup datum. For this purpose, the liaisons involved in this subjob and the
precedence surfaces are analyzed. Figure 8.15 highlights these liaisons, which are: the distance 20 ± 0.2 mm
between R2 and 1f, the distance 55 ± 0.5 mm between R3 and 1f, and the coaxiality Ø2 mm between R1 and 2–3–
4f. From these relationships, the raw surfaces R1, R2, and R3 should be analyzed to be considered as setup
datums.
The specifications related to R2 and R3 constrain the position of the workpiece on the Z‐axis, and thus, they lock
the same part movements, −Tz, ±Rx, and ±Ry. The specification related to R1 is a coaxiality tolerance and
constraints the orientation of the part and locks the movements ±Tx, ±Ty, ±Rx, and ±Ry. It should be noted that the
R3 specification refers to the end of the conical shape, and the R2 specification refers to a plane, therefore R2 is
easier to be used as a datum surface. Hence, the possible datum scheme for subjob 1 may be R1 to orient the part
and lock eight possible part movements and R2 to lock the remaining two potential movements, that is, the ±Tz.
Note that since these are turning operations, the movements ±Rz are not locked.
Although this alternative may work, it should be noted that the coaxiality tolerance specification, Ø2 mm, is less
restrictive than the dimensional tolerance between 1f and R2, ±0.2 mm. Thus, a better approach is to use R2 to lock
the five movements ±Rx, ±Ry, and −Tz, and the R1 surface to lock the remaining four part movements (±Tx and
±Ty). Therefore, the resulting locating surfaces would be R2 and R1 in this order.
Next, the clamping surfaces and the fixturing device are selected. To facilitate the clamping process, instead of
using R2 as the datum surface, the use of surface R9 (surface 9 before machining) may be an option. However,
although this datum surface facilitates the clamping process from the right side of the part, the distance controlled
during machining would be the distance between surface R9 and surface 1, not the distance between R2 and 1.
Therefore, a stackup tolerance arises and this phenomenon should be taken into account if this option is selected.
The stackup is shown Figure 8.16 where the resulting distance between surface 1 and surface R2 is obtained as the
result of dimension R9‐1f minus dimension R9‐R2, since the machining operations are being referenced from
surface R9. Assuming as manufacturing errors a machining error of ±0.01 mm, a fixturing error of ±0.05 mm (a
three‐jaw chuck with soft jaws), and a casting tolerance of ±0.5 mm, the tolerance stackup for R2‐1f is ±0.56 mm
whereas the admissible design tolerance is ±0.2 mm. Therefore, the possible use of surface R9 as the locating
surface is discarded and the final locating surfaces are R2 and R1. It can be seen that if the datum surface used is
R2, the distance R2‐1f is directly the machining error plus the fixturing error, that is, ±0.06 mm, lower than the
design tolerance ±0.2 mm.

Figure 8.15 Liaisons between currently analyzed subjob and previous subjobs/raw surfaces.

Figure 8.16 Tolerance stackup if surface R9 is used as datum surface. Design specification R2‐1f is 20 ± 0.2 mm,
but tolerance stackup results in the summation of machining/fixturing error and casting error (±0.56 mm).
Note that the specification related to the distance between R3 and 1f is obtained through a tolerance stackup, since
the machining distance is R2‐1f, and the distance R2‐R3 comes from casting. However, since the tolerance in this
specification is high (±0.8 mm), the resulting stackup is within design specifications.
The workholding device to be used must lock five movements on R2 (±Rx, ±Ry, and −Tz), so a planar locating
surface is required. Additionally, four additional movements should be locked on R1 (±Tx and ±Ty). A possible
workholding system is a three‐jaw chuck, using the jaws to support the R2 plane and closing the jaws to lock the
R1 movement. The clamping pressure will lock the remaining three potential part movements (Tz and ±Rz). The
chuck may have hard or soft jaws since part tolerances (±0.2 and ±0.5 mm) are high. In this case, hard jaws are
finally selected.
As a final step, the fixturing scheme is graphically represented (Figure 8.17) and the diagram is updated by
indicating the setup datum for each subjob and the number of part movements constrained (Figure 8.18).
Subjob 2 in lathe
In this case, the following relationships will give relevant information about the setup datum definition:
 
Distance between 1f and 9f is 75 ± 0.3 mm.
Parallelism between 1f and 9f is 0.2 mm.
Coaxiality between 6f and 7–8f is Ø0.2 mm.

Figure 8.17 Graphical representation of the location and clamping method in subjob 1, job 1. Note that holes
(surface 10) are not included since these holes are not obtained in the casting process.

Figure 8.18 Diagram updated with the setup datum in subjob 1, job 1.
Therefore, there are liaisons that compromise the same part movements, and the most restrictive should be
selected. The most restrictive tolerances are the coaxiality and parallelism, both 0.2 mm, but coaxiality is more
restrictive since involves orientation and position whereas parallelism only involves orientation. However, surface
6 is difficult if not impossible to be used as locating surface. At this point, the following alternatives are identified:
 
Alternative 1. Use as locating datum surface 1, which locks ±Rx, ±Ry, and −Tz, and surface R1 to lock ±Tx
and ±Ty.
Alternative 2. Use as locating datum surface 2, which locks ±Tx, ±Ty, ±Rx, and ±Ry, and surface 1 to lock
−Tz.
Alternative 3. Use as locating datum surface R1, which locks ±Tx, ±Ty, ±Rx, and ±Ry, and surface 1 to lock
−Tz. This is similar to alternative 2 but using surface R1 instead of surface 2.
Alternative 1 ensures the parallelism tolerance since surface 9 is machined using surface 1 as the datum. However,
the coaxiality will depend on a tolerance stackup where a rough cast surface is involved since R1 is locking the
movements ±Tx and ±Ty. Then, this alternative is discarded due to the impossibility of ensuring coaxiality.

The alternative 2 orients the part through surface 2 (locks ±Rx, ±Ry, ±Tx, and ±Ty) which has been previously
produced using the same subjob as for machining surface 6. Thus, the coaxiality between 2 and 6 is high (only
machining errors may influence). Since surfaces 2 and 6 present a high coaxiality, machining surface 8 using
surface 2 as the locating surface will also ensure a high coaxiality between surfaces 6 and 8. On the contrary, the
parallelism of surface 1 is also ensured since surfaces 1 and 2 are also machined in the same previous subjob and
thus, the possible orientation error between both surfaces may be only caused by machining errors, not by the
fixturing error. Therefore, in both parallelism and coaxiality tolerances there is a tolerance stackup, but since the
tolerances are not too tight (0.2 mm), it can be expected that both tolerances will be reached. Finally, alternative 3
may be more appropriate to keep the tooling similar to subjob 1, but it is discarded by the same reason than
alternative 1, that is, the use of a rough cast surface as an intermediate surface to ensure coaxiality. Figure 8.19
shows the tolerance stackups identified in the diagram for alternatives 2 and 3.
Therefore, alternative 2 is chosen. It should be noted that the distance tolerance between 1f and 9f is ensured since
surface 1 locks the movement −Tz. Figure 8.20 shows the machining sequence diagram adding the setup datums
and the part movements constrained.
A possible physical realization of this fixturing scheme is based on an internal gripping device that will lock eight‐
part movements by acting on surface 2. Considering that surface 2 has a dimension of Ø62 mm, a three‐jaw chuck
using internal jaws can be used. Additionally, since surface 1 locks the Z‐axis movement, a locator or the internal
jaw itself placed on surface 1 can be used for this purpose. The accuracy of the three‐jaw chuck depends on the
type of jaws used (Table 8.3). In this case, since there is a coaxiality and parallelism tolerance of 0.2 mm and a
tolerance stackup arises, soft jaws are selected to increase the location accuracy. The graphical representation of
the fixturing scheme applied is illustrated in Figure 8.21.

Subjob 1 in machining center
Similar to previous subjobs, analyzing the relationships between the holes to be machined and the previously
obtained surfaces is the first step to define the setup datums. As shown in the diagram (Figure 8.22), the holes are
related to surfaces obtained in operations 1f and 2‐3‐4f by a position tolerance. Since surface 1 is the primary
datum in the position tolerance and surface 2 is the secondary one, surface 1 is used as a plane–plane contact to
lock five‐part movements (−Tz, ±Rx, and ±Ry), and surface 2 is used to lock the remaining four potential
movements (±Tx and ±Ty). Note that since the part at this stage is symmetrical, the position of the part around its
axis does not need to be controlled.
To constrain the explained part movements, a planar surface (e.g., a plate) can be used in surface 1 and a
concentric pin in surface 2. To clamp the part, two options can be easily devised. As the first option, a strap clamp
can be used to exert a clamping force over surface R2. As a second option, instead of using a basic concentric pin,
a mandril can be used for clamping the part exerting force over surface 2. A variant of this option could be the use
of a three‐jaw chuck for clamping the part over surface 2 with internal jaws. For this example, option 1 is selected
and the final fixturing scheme is represented graphically, as shown in Figure 8.23.
Subjob 2 in machining center
Similar to previous subjobs, the specifications to be met in this subjob are reviewed. In this case, this subjob
machines surface 5 (drilling and boring) and requires the positioning of this feature with respect to references A, C,
and D, which means surfaces 1, 2, and 10. As the position tolerance includes a primary, a secondary, and a tertiary
datum surface, the locating scheme to hold the part must keep this datum scheme to avoid a stackup tolerance. All
three surfaces are accessible during machining, and thus, the following scheme is proposed: surface 1, a plane‐to‐
plane contact, locks five‐part movements (primary datum); surface 2 locks the position of the part with respect to
the axis of this cylindrical geometry and locks four movements (secondary datum); and finally, the holes of surface
10 lock the two remaining part movements related to part rotation (tertiary datum). Figure 8.24 shows the diagram
of the machining sequence with the datum surfaces selected.

Figure 8.22 Updated diagram, including the datum surfaces for subjob 1, job 2.

Figure 8.23 Graphical representation of subjob 1, job 2.
To hold the part using as primary datum surface 1, surface R2 could be the first option to be used as a clamping
surface. Since R2 is accessible, this surface will be used for locating strap clamps or similar clamps and exerting a
clamping force toward the primary datum surface. Other options similar to previous subjob 1 can be studied, but
R2 may be the most straightforward one. Therefore, the workholding system used in this subjob is similar to the
previous one. A plane to lock five movements and a concentric pin to locate the part on the axis of surface 2.
Additionally, a diamond pin is used on hole 10 to lock the rotation of the part around its axis. Finally, two strap
clamps or similar devices are used to hold the part. Figure 8.25 shows graphically the proposed workholding
system.

Machine Tool/Cutting Tool Selection
9.1 Introduction
Machine tool and cutting tool selection are important activities that process planners must conduct when
machining processes are planned. Factors such as productivity, machine tool accuracy, power requirements,
workpiece material, and part geometry should be considered at this stage. This chapter details some of these
factors and how to conduct an efficient machine tool and cutting tool selection. For this purpose, the chapter
briefly reviews the cutting tool materials and the most common cutting tools employed in milling, turning, and
drilling. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard that describes the characteristics of tool
holders and cutting inserts is also presented, and the influence of cutting tool parameters on cutting performance,
such as lead angles, rake angles, nose radius, etc., is analyzed. The chapter also provides practical examples to
reinforce the theoretical explanations related to machine tool and cutting tool selection.
9.2 Machine Tool Selection
9.2.1 Factors in Machine Tool Selection
Machine tool selection is conducted considering several factors that can be categorized as either technical or
operational factors. In terms of technical considerations, the primary focus lies in ensuring that the chosen machine
tool possesses the capacity to produce the desired part in accordance with the specified requirements. The key
aspects to take into account are as follows:
 
Physical dimensions and robustness. The machine tool should be able to accommodate the workpiece’s
dimensions and, at the same time, must be robust enough to support the weight of the workpiece and the
dynamic load during cutting.
Power requirements. The machine tool should be able to provide the required cutting power to conduct all
machining operations efficiently. For this purpose, calculations must be performed to estimate the power
requirements for critical operations given workpiece/tool materials and proper ranges for cutting parameters
(i.e., feed rates, cutting speed, and depth of cut). Chapter 10 provides the technical background to conduct a
proper power consumption calculation in machining operations.
Machine tool capability. The machine tool should be able to machine the parts within the prescribed
dimensional/geometric tolerance limits and surface roughness requirements. In other words, the
manufacturing variability should be lower than these tolerance limits, otherwise, additional machining or
finishing operations will be required, increasing the total manufacturing cost.
Unlike technical factors that are centered on ensuring that the chosen machine tool can meet the required part
specifications, operational factors are more focused on considering an efficient utilization of available resources to
fulfill the master production schedule. The key aspects of operational considerations encompass (Scallan 2003):
 
Batch size. Similar to how each manufacturing process has an economic batch quantity (EBQ) that must be
reached for it to be economically viable, specific machinery also has its own batch size requirements. A
common approach involves comparing different machines for a given batch size using break‐even analysis to
determine the most cost‐effective choice.
Capacity. Equally significant as the EBQ is the production rate achievable by the machines under evaluation.
Every machine has the capacity to produce a certain output per unit of time. Consequently, it is crucial to
assign parts to machines with output capabilities that align with the requirements of the master production
schedule for a given period.
Availability. This refers to whether the required machine is currently in use or not, in other words, whether it
is available or unavailable.

While all these factors are equally important, the primary process planner's concern is typically the batch size
analysis. According to the batch size, the selection of the optimal machine tool can be done for the most
economical production or for the maximum production.
To select the machinery for the most economical production, the cost of using a machine tool for machining a part
can be mathematically derived as follows:
where CT is the cost incurred only once in the manufacturing of the part (for example, process planning cost,
computer numerical control (CNC) programming cost, fixture design cost, etc.); CL is the cost incurred every batch
is manufactured (for instance, machine tool and fixtures setups); L is the number of batches to be manufactured; n
is the number of parts per batch; and Cu is the unitary manufacturing cost per part (e.g., labor cost, tooling cost,
etc.).
On the contrary, to select the machinery for maximum production, the goal is to minimize the manufacturing time
of the parts. Thus, the equation to be evaluated is the manufacturing time that is described as:
where the variables refer to the time required for each of the items expressed above in the manufacturing cost
function.
9.2.2 Machine Tool Selection Method
The procedure to select the most adequate machine tool is based on the following steps:
 
Discard the machine tools that do not meet the technical factors.
From the remaining machine tools, choose the one that minimizes the cost/time according to the desired
production approach (maximum production or economical production). If batch size is not known or is still
under consideration, evaluate the break‐even for all machine tools.
9.2.3 Practical Example
Consider a CNC machine tool A with a setup cost of $500 per batch and an operation cost of $3 per part, and a
CNC machine tool B with a setup cost of $1,500 and an operation cost of $1. Select the machine tool for the most
economical production as a function of the number of parts per batch.
Under the assumption that the CT cost is the same for any machine tool (process planning cost, CNC programming,
etc.), the cost expression has a fixed cost (CL/n) and a variable cost (Cu, which is the machining cost per part), a
break‐even analysis as in the following can be conducted to evaluate the quantity at which the same cost is given
for each machine tool:
Thus, for a production with more than 500 parts per batch, the machine tool B will be used. If the quantity is lower
than 500, machine tool A will be used. Figure 9.1 shows graphically the break‐even analysis.

Figure 9.1 Example of break‐even point between two CNC machines with different fixed and operating costs.
9.3 Cutting Tool Selection
9.3.1 Factors in Cutting Tool Selection
In machining, using a single tool to complete all cutting processes is quite uncommon. As a result, several tools are
frequently needed for machining a part. For instance, different tools are used for roughing and finishing.
Additionally, specific tools are needed for tasks such as thread cutting, drilling, and slot machining. Therefore, it is
crucial to choose the appropriate tool for the specific task that is needed.
Numerous factors influence the tool selection decision but the most important can be summarized as follows:
 
Workpiece material. The type of material to be machined will influence on the selection of cutting tool
geometry and cutting tool material. Some aspects to consider on tool material and tool geometry selection are
briefly explained in the following.
 
Influence on cutting tool materials. The main cutting tool materials are high‐speed steels (HSS),
carbides, cermets, ceramics, cubic boron nitrides (cBN), and polycrystalline diamond (PCD). PCD is a
costly material that cannot be used in machining ferrous alloys nor titanium or Ni–Co alloys due to their
chemical affinity. Despite their high cost, for nonferreous and nonmetallic materials, the use of PCD
tools can produce excellent surface finish and exceptionally long tool life. cBN is another costly material

that can increase productivity (up to 100 times better than carbides or ceramics in terms of longer tool
life and/or higher removal rates) in many difficult metal cutting operations such as machining hardened
steels and heat‐resistant materials. Cermets and ceramics present high wear resistance and work well at
high cutting temperatures, but they are not tough enough to be used in noncontinuous operations such as
milling or interrupted turning operations. HSS and carbides are more generally used; HSS for low
cutting speeds and light or medium‐duty applications whereas carbides are more appropriate for higher
cutting speeds and heavy‐duty applications. Carbides are more expensive but they can work 2.5 times
faster than their equivalent HSS tools. Carbide inserts are usually coated (titanium nitride [TiN], titanium
carbonitride [TiCN], etc.), which increases tool life, cutting speeds, and feeds allowable by 15–25%. The
ISO 513: 2012 “Classification and application of hard cutting materials for metal removal with defined
cutting edges – Designation of the main groups and groups of application,” defines six main application
groups for hard cutting materials which correspond to six classes of workpiece materials, classified by
letters and colors. The six classes are steels, code P (blue color); stainless steel, code M (yellow color);
cast iron, code K (red color); nonferrous metals, code N (green color); hard materials (hardened steels),
code H (gray color); and exotic materials (titanium and heat resistance alloys), code S (brown color). For
each application group, different subgroups are defined by using the same code and a number (e.g., P10,
P20, …). The higher the number within each application group, the lower is the material's wear
resistance but the higher the toughness. To properly select the application group and subgroup, besides
workpiece material, it is considered the type of operation (roughing, medium, or finishing) and the
stability of the cutting operation (good, average, or difficult). In general, the subgroup is selected for
high wear resistance in finishing and stable cutting operations, and for more demanding operations in
terms of forces (roughing) or interrupted cutting, the subgroup is selected for higher toughness but with
less wear resistance. Figure 9.2 summarizes the types of cutting tool materials, their properties, and
applications. Table 9.1 shows the application groups and subgroups according to ISO 513 that are
commonly found in catalogs for cutting tool selection. For instance, grade GC4305 from Sandvik
Coromant manufacturer is recommended for P05 and P10 applications; thus, it is applied for steels
where wear resistance wants to be maximized and high toughness is not necessary (continuous cutting or
finishing operations).

Influence on cutting tool geometry. The tool angles, rake angles, cutting‐edge angles, and tool nose
radius all affect the metal‐cutting process. They influence on aspects such as chip generation, thermal
dissipation, cutting forces, or built‐up formation, and thus, they should be properly selected. For
example, when machining low‐strength and ductile materials, a large rake angle is applied to reduce
cutting forces and improve surface roughness. On the contrary, high‐strength materials are cut with low
rake angles to provide adequate tool strength and better heat dissipation.
Part geometry. The geometry of the part has a significant impact on the choice of cutting tools. For instance,
geometric features such as T‐slots required the specific use of T‐slot cutting tools, pockets with corner radii at
the bottom require specific bull nose end mills, or areas with low accessibility may require specific cutting
tools to avoid collisions. The compatibility of cutting tool geometry and part geometry should always be
studied in detail.
Capability. Cutting tools should be selected to ensure that dimension/geometrical tolerances together with
roughness specifications are met. For instance, holes with dimensional quality IT8‐12 can be produced with
conventional drills but for holes with dimensional quality IT6‐7, reamers or boring tools must be used.
9.3.2 Cutting Tools and Selection Recommendations
9.3.2.1 Cutting Tools in Turning
The cutting tool selection in turning depends on the type of operation to be conducted, as shown in Figure 9.3. The
cutting tools for external cutting differ notably from similar operations that are conducted internally, and grooving,
threading, or cutting‐off operations require specific tools.

Figure 9.3 External and internal turning operations.

Although HSS tools can be found, the most common cutting tools applied in turning are those based on cutting
inserts, usually carbide inserts. To hold the turning insert, a turning tool holder must be used which should be
selected in accordance with the cutting insert as they both consist of one working tool. The main parameters that
define cutting inserts and turning holders are shown in the following together with some practical
recommendations.
9.3.2.2 Turning Holders and Cutting Inserts
The ISO standard “ISO 5608: 2012. Turning and copying tool holders and cartridges for indexable inserts –
Designation” describes the shape and size of turning holders using a specific code based on numbers and letters.
An example of the use of this ISO standard is given in Figure 9.4 where a tool holder code PCLNL2525M12 with
each parameter description is presented. The meaning of each parameter in this ISO standard is briefly described in
the following.
 

Parameter 1. Insert clamping method. This parameter is commonly selected according to the expected cutting
forces of the operation and its intermittent nature. Top clamping is the sturdiest and screw clamping is the
weakest. Some clamping methods are shown in Figure 9.5.
Parameter 2. Insert shape. Many insert shapes are available as shown in Figure 9.6. Note that the insert
geometry is selected based on the type of operation and the accessibility of the cutting tool required (see
Figures 9.7 and 9.8). Additionally, it should be taken into account that large point angle inserts present higher
edge strength but tend to produce higher vibrations.

Parameter 3. Holder style. The holder style defines the entering angle (K) as shown in Figure 9.9. The
entering angle together with the insert shape defines the end cutting‐edge angle, and thus, the accessibility of
the insert for contour turning operations. As a general guide, a free cutting angle of at least 2° between the
workpiece and the insert has to be maintained (Figure 9.10).
Large entering angles (small lead angles) produce cutting forces that are aimed at the chuck, which reduces the
likelihood of vibrations. With small entering angles the radial forces increase, resulting in a clear impact on
vibration tendencies and workpiece deflection. However, small entering angles provide the cutting‐edge with a
larger corner and can add cutting‐edge strength by distributing machining pressure along a greater length of the
cutting edge (Figure 9.11). Note that the preceding definition of the lead angle is based on the ISO standard
whereas the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard defines the lead angle similar to the entering
angle.

consumption.

and radial forces.

Figure 9.12 Insert clearance angle.
Source: Seco Tools AB (2023a).
 
Parameter 4. Insert clearance angle. Different clearances are defined in Figure 9.12. To increase edge strength,
the clearance should be as low as possible. However, low clearance angles may produce rubbing and an
increase of tool wear. As a general rule, machining ductile materials require larger clearance angles. When the
insert clearance angle is 0, the insert is reversible and can be mounted in two sides, which results in lower
cutting tool costs. However, this kind of inserts should be only used in negative tool holder configurations to
avoid rubbing.
Parameter 5. Hand of the holder. “R” denotes right‐handed tool, “L” denotes left‐handed tool, and “N”
denotes neutral tool. A left‐handed tool can remove material while moving rightward (top view keeping rake
surface visible). The name is derived from its analogy with the human left hand as the left‐hand thumb
direction indicates the tool feed direction. Figure 9.13 illustrates the left‐ and right‐handed tools and the
neutral tools that can move in both directions.

Source: Seco Tools AB (2023a).
Figure 9.15 Length of holder, LF, and length of insert cutting edge, L.
Source: Seco Tools AB (2023a).
Parameters 6 and 7. Shank height and shank width are defined according to the holder size of the machine
tool (Figure 9.14).
Parameters 8 and 9. These parameters define the length of the holder and the length of the cutting insert
(Figure 9.15). The holder length, LF, is defined according to the machine tool and the operation itself. For
external turning operations, it is recommended to use the largest tool holder shank for maximum stability. For
internal turning operations, the tool holder used is a boring bar, and to minimize vibrations and deflections, a
tool holder with L/D < 4 should be used. The length of the insert cutting edge, L, is defined according to the
type of insert geometry and it depends on the required or desired depth of cut during machining.
For internal turning (boring bars), three additional parameters are added into the code to refer to the bar
dimensions as shown in the ISO standard “ISO 5609‐1:2012. Tool holders for internal turning with cylindrical
shank for indexable inserts.” These parameters are tool holder type, shank diameter, and tool length, and they refer
to parameters 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Figure 9.16 shows a general ISO designation for internal tool holder bars
according to ISO 5609.
According to the ISO standard “ISO 1832: 2017. Indexable inserts for cutting tools – Designation,” the cutting
inserts follow the nomenclature shown in Figure 9.17.
From the selection of the turning holder, some characteristics of the cutting insert are already defined such as insert
shape, insert clearance, and size (cutting‐edge length). Other parameters such as insert tolerance, thickness, nose
radius, etc., are defined during the selection of the cutting insert. Figures 9.18–9.20 show the meaning of the insert
parameters not defined yet by the tool holder according to ISO 1832.
In the selection of the cutting insert, nose radius is a critical property. Higher nose radius leads to more robust
inserts and can be applied for heavy feed rates and large depths of cut. A smaller nose radius is ideal for small
cutting depths and low vibrations although it presents a weaker cutting edge. Table 9.2 shows common feed rate
ranges according to nose radius values.

similar to external tool holders. Parameter 4: insert clamping; parameter 5: insert shape; parameter 6: holder style;

For finishing operations, special inserts named “wiper” inserts are also available. The nose on a wiper insert is a
combination of radii instead of a single radius which makes the nose flatter and more adequate for high‐quality
surface finish although increases the vibration tendency (Figure 9.21).
9.3.2.3 Cutting Tools in Milling
Milling is a versatile machining process in part because of the diversity of milling cutters that are available. HSS
are used to make certain milling cutters, while others use carbide tips and many have replaceable or indexable
inserts made of cBN, cermets, ceramics, PCD, and more commonly, coated carbides.

Cutting tool selection depends on the type of operation to be conducted, as shown in Figures 9.22 and 9.23.
Once the type of cutting tool is chosen, the specific characteristics of the cutting tool must be defined. At this step,
the following good practices can be followed:
 
Tool size. As a general rule, productivity should be the main goal in machining, and thus, bigger tools with
higher removal rates are recommended for any operation. Workpiece dimensions and power limitations may
limit the final cutting tool dimension.
Entering angle. Cutter entering angles also affect the machining performance. A 45° entering tool reduces
chip thickness by about 30% as compared to a 90° entering angle. Since smaller entering angles result in
smaller chip thickness, cutting tool vendors recommend higher feed rates when smaller entering angles are
applied to maintain a proper chip load. High feed cutters usually present very small entering angles (e.g., 10–
15°) which lead to very fast feed rates although the maximum depth of cut is highly limited by the entering
angle itself. Additionally, increasing the entering angle reduces the axial component of the cutting force as the
radial component increases (Figure 9.24). This can cause deflection of the machined surface when the

workpiece has a thin cross‐section. As recommended, use 90° only for operations that require a final 90°
geometry, 45° for heavy machining such as face milling or roughing operations, and 60–75° for general and
frontal milling operations.

Figure 9.24 Entering angle and its relationship with normal cutting force direction and chip‐
thinning phenomena.
Cutter geometry. Insert cutting edges can be positioned in positive, neutral, or negative rakes with respect to
both radial and axial planes. There are three standard combinations available (see Table 9.3):
1. Double negative (negative radial and axial rake angles). When horsepower and stiffness are sufficient,
double negative geometry is the conventional starting point for rough milling cast iron, steels, and hard
materials. The double negative insert design offers the strongest cutting edge available and can withstand
greater cutting pressures as well as higher chip loads. Additionally, double‐negative cutters call for
increased rigidity in the machine, workpiece, and fixture. The employment of reversible inserts is the
natural result of this configuration which reduces cutting tool costs.
2. Double positive (positive radial and axial rake angles). The power consumption is lower and facilitates
chip extraction. However, the tool impact is higher and it should not be used in machining hard
materials. Due to this limitation, it works best with nonferrous and soft materials.
3. Positive/negative (negative radial rake and positive axial rake angles). Some of the benefits of both
double negative and double positive are combined in this setup. It is commonly used in steels and cast
irons.
Cutter density. Different cutter densities can be found in tool holders and very often three categories are
distinguished: coarse pitch, normal pitch, and close pitch (Figure 9.25). Chips must be able to correctly form
and pass through the cut due to the cutter density. Insufficient chip room can result in chips clogging the
gullet, harming the workpiece, and damaging the cutting edge. For soft materials that create continuous chips,
in large cuts with a long insert engagement, and when stability and power are constrained (small machines),
coarse pitch tools are advised since they provide more chip gullet area. On the contrary, close‐pitch (high
cutter density) tools are better for shallow or narrow cuts where light chip loads are taken. Smaller chips need
less gullet space, enabling higher cutter densities. As a general recommendation, a close pitch is preferred for
best productivity as long as chip flow is guaranteed.

Rigidity. Use the most rigid cutter possible, that is, tools with larger diameters and shorter lengths.
A special remark should be made about milling aluminum alloys and other soft materials. The main problem with
these alloys is that the chip tends to clog the cutter. To overcome this problem, it is required the use of a cutter that
has few teeth (coarse pitch) and larger positive rake angles than cutters for milling steels. Sharp cutting edges are

employed to generate good surface roughness and enough clearance is required to prevent heeling. For instance,
clearances around 10° are recommended with axial rake angles between 15° and 45°.
HSS mills and indexable carbide mills are the most common type of tools applied in milling. For the case of
indexable carbide mills, the milling holder and the type of carbide inserts should be defined at the same time. The
main characteristics of holders and carbide inserts for milling are defined in the following.
9.3.2.4 Milling Holders and Cutting Inserts
There is no ISO standard for milling tool holders and thus, tool holders' nomenclature depends on cutting tool
vendors although they usually present similar information as those from turning tools. For instance, Figure 9.26
shows the specific designation system used by a tool vendor for milling holders' designation.
The cutting inserts used in milling follow the standard ISO 1832: 2017. To select the proper cutting insert, the
main characteristics of cutting insert geometry defined in Figures 9.27–9.30 can be followed.
9.3.2.5 Cutting Tools in Drilling
A general overview of cutting tools in drilling according to the drill diameter and the length‐to‐diameter ratio is
shown in Figure 9.31. The most common tools for drilling are solid drills such as twist drills or solid carbide drills.
When closer hole tolerance is required, solid carbides are the first choice, especially for smaller diameters and
short to relatively deep holes. Exchangeable tip drills are the first choice for medium‐diameter holes as an
economical solution. For medium to large diameter holes and medium tolerance demands, indexable insert drills
are the first option. In this case, blind holes require a flat bottom. Trepanning drills are used for larger through‐hole
diameters and where machine power is limited. Gun drills are applied for very large length‐to‐diameter ratios, for
instance, for drilling cooling channels in injection molds.

From the preceding types of drills, twist drills are the most common tools employed. Figure 9.32 shows the main
characteristics of a twist drill. For a correct selection of the drill geometry, the following recommendations are
given:
 
Drill angle (point angle). To drill soft materials (magnesium, aluminum), drill angles are usually 80–110°. For
steels and cast irons the drill angle is 118°, whereas for hard materials such as tool steels or stainless steels the
drill angle is usually 118–135°.
Helix angle. Small helix angles are used for drilling hardened materials (Inconel, titanium, etc.) whereas large
angles are applied for soft materials (aluminum, copper, etc.).
Flute length. Flute length is determined by the cutting depth; however, the length must be as short as possible
due to tool life issues.
Internal coolant. Internal coolant is usually recommended to facilitate the chip extraction. This is a key issue
in holes deeper than three times the tool diameter, where internal coolant is highly recommended.

Drilling accuracy ranges from IT12 to IT8, and the type of drill, the type of drill holder, and cutting conditions
have a clear influence on the resulting hole quality. For instance, a drill clamped using a collet chuck has a good
run‐out accuracy (usually lower than 5–10 μm), but a standard drill chuck may present a lower run‐out accuracy
(usually lower than 50 μm).
When drilling with HSS drills, the irregularity of the surface and the unbalanced contact of drilling edges may
deflect the entrance of the drill, producing a nonperpendicular hole. If perpendicularity of the hole, position
accuracy, or run‐out is an issue, a spot drill can be firstly used to guide and limit the drill deflection. Center drills
can be also used to guide the drilling operation but they are mainly applied to create a hole to act as a
guide/support for a live and dead center in turning operations. Note that if carbide drills are used, spot drilling is
not required due to its rigidity compared with HSS drills. Spot drill diameters are chosen to be 50–70% of the
ultimate drill diameter.
For drilling holes larger than 8–10 mm in diameter, a sequence of drilling operations is recommended. For this
purpose, the rule 1/2‐1/3 is applied, which means that a previous hole between 1/2 and 1/3 of the desired drill must
be machined. For instance, to drill a hole of Ø36 mm, it is required a drilling operation of Ø15 mm (1/2 × 36 = 18 
mm; 1/3 × 36 = 12 mm), a drilling operation of Ø7 mm (1/2 × 15 = 7.5 mm; 1/3 × 15 = 5 mm) and a spot drilling,
obviously in the inverse order.
For large holes, indexable insert drills are usually the most common tool employed. However, when limited
machine power is available, the following methods are recommended:
 
Use a trepanning tool, only for through‐hole applications.
Enlarge the hole with a boring tool.
Use helical interpolation with milling tools.

Drilling tools are a better option from a productivity standpoint than milling. However, milling is recommended
when chip breakage is an issue or when torque and power should be limited since milling a hole requires less of
both.
For machining the entrance of a hole, counterboring, and countersinking operations are conducted (Figure 9.33).
They are always conducted before threading or reaming operations.
9.3.2.6 Cutting Tools in Reaming and Boring

Reaming and boring operations require premachined holes that are finished with special tools named reamers and
boring tools to increase dimensional/geometrical tolerances and surface quality. For reaming operations, reamers
are designed to work with very small depth of cut values, which means that the previous hole should be machined
with a slightly smaller diameter than the final reamed hole. Table 9.4 shows the depth of cut recommended for
reaming operations according to the final hole diameter. For example, to obtain a final hole with specifications
18H7, a previous hole of 17.75 mm should be drilled, and later, a reamer 18H7 should be used.
Reamers are usually employed to produce holes with IT7‐8 since holes drilled usually present a quality of IT9‐12.
Although adjustable reamers can be used, reamers are usually applied for small holes. When machining medium to
large holes with high quality, boring operations are more commonly applied. Boring operations can reach up to
IT6, and tools such as single‐edge or two‐edge tools can be used (Figure 9.34).

9.3.2.7 Cutting Tools in Threading
For threading holes, different machining operations can be conducted: tapping, thread turning, and thread milling
(Figure 9.35). In tapping, a tool named tap is used and its selection depends on the thread metric required. When
threading counterbored holes, threading is conducted last (Figure 9.36).
The diameter of the previous hole required before tapping is defined as
where dext is the nominal diameter and p is the pitch of the threaded hole. For instance, to obtain a threaded hole
with the specification M10 × 1.50, a previous hole of 10 − 1.50 = 8.50 mm diameter is required.
For internal and external threading operations in turning and milling operations, special cutter inserts are used.
Special care should be paid depending on the type of thread (right‐ or left‐hand thread) and the type of hand tool
(right or left), as it can be seen in Figures 9.37 and 9.38.

For external operations, the diameter required previous to the threading operation is defined as
For instance, threading a bar with the specification M8 × 1.25 requires an initial bar diameter of 8 − 1.25 × 0.1 =
7.875 mm.

9.3.3 Practical Example
In this section, cutting tool selection is conducted for the example studied in Chapter 8. To remind the example,
Figure 9.39 and Table 9.5 show the engineering drawing and the resulting machining sequence of the example,
respectively. After determining the machining sequence, the next step is the selection of machine tools and cutting
tools. For this practical example, it is assumed that the machine tools are predefined (i.e., only one CNC lathe and
one CNC machining center is available), and the cutting tools available are assumed to be those shown in Section
9.4.
The cutting tool selection is mainly done by analyzing the operation to be conducted, accessibility issues, and the
compatibility with the workpiece material, aluminum AISI SC64D (SAE 326), which corresponds to the N code
according to ISO 513. The selected cutting tools and a brief explanation of their choice are shown below.

Process Parameter Selection
10.1 Introduction
In machining operations, process parameters should be carefully selected for achieving high‐quality, efficient, and
cost‐effective machining processes. Machining costs due to cutting tool costs and power consumption are directly
related to cutting parameter optimization. At the same time, cutting parameters have a direct impact on surface
roughness and dimensional accuracy on machined parts, so process parameter selection may be not a
straightforward operation.
In this chapter, it is explained how to select the cutting conditions for machining processes such as turning,
milling, or drilling. Cutting conditions usually refer to cutting speed, feed rate, and depth of cut, and their selection
mainly depends on the employed cutting tool and workpiece material, the limitations of the machine tool, and the
dimensional and geometrical specifications of the part. For instance, surface roughness may limit feed rates, and
geometrical errors due to cutting tool deflection may limit the depth of cut and feed rates.
This chapter shows a stepwise procedure to determine the cutting conditions for machining operations and it also
describes some specific guidelines and good practices. A brief explanation about which type of cutting fluids
should be employed is also provided since they are also considered part of cutting conditions.
10.2 Methodology
10.2.1 Stepwise Procedure
Typically, the cutting parameters are determined and optimized by adopting a stepwise procedure. The first group
of parameters to be set up is the cutting speed (Vc) and the feed rate (fn) or feed per tooth (fz). These two
parameters are defined according to the type of cutting tool and workpiece material. Cutting tool vendors provide
tables and cutting data for the correct selection of their values. For the reader's convenience, Appendix 2 shows
some generic tables for cutting speed and feed rate selection for different types of tools, workpiece materials, and
operations.
Although ranges of cutting speed and feed rate are defined according to the tool vendor's recommendations, the
optimal parameters from the recommended ranges can be obtained in terms of costs or productivity. If cutting is
conducted at high‐speed ranges, tool life is determined by the temperature‐dependent wear processes involving
deformation and diffusion. Under these conditions, the relationship between cutting speed, Vc, and tool life, T, can
be expressed using Taylor's equation (Stephenson and Agapiou 2016, Chapter 9):
where C and n are constants for the material and conditions used. Typical values of n are 0.1–0.17 for HSS tools,
0.2–0.25 for uncoated WC tools, 0.3 for TiC or TiN‐coated WC tools, and 0.4 for Al2O3‐coated WC tools. This
empirical equation shows that when cutting speed Vc increases, the feasible tool life T decreases and vice versa. A
greater value of Vc will decrease the machining time and hence lower the cost of machining time per workpiece,
but it will also shorten tool life, increasing the cost of the tool per workpiece. At a specific cutting speed Vcc, when
these two expenses move in opposite directions, their combined sum per workpiece crosses a minimum. The
position of the cost‐optimized cutting speed Vcc is shown in Figure 10.1, along with how the various cost
components change as a function of cutting speed. Any deviation from this cost‐optimized cutting speed Vcc will
increase the unit cost of production as either the machining time or the tool costs will rise. A similar reasoning can
be conducted considering the time per piece required for machining. A higher cutting speed increases production
so that the time required per piece is reduced, but the wear rate increases so the tool replacement time increases. It
can be seen that Vcp is the cutting speed that maximizes the production since the time required for machining a part
is minimal.

Furthermore, for roughing operations a higher value of feed rate within the recommended range is used to increase
productivity since tolerance requirements apply to finishing operations. In case of finishing operations, the feed
rate is constrained by the required surface roughness or geometrical quality and therefore will be fixed by these
requirements.

production cost (Vcc) and maximum production rate (Vcp).

A second group of parameters define the depth of cut, which is defined by two parameters in milling operations:
the radial depth of cut (ae) and the axial depth of cut (ap). These parameters define the material removal rate, and
therefore, the power requirement to conduct the operation. For the sake of simplicity, only the axial depth of cut is
considered since the radial depth of cut is usually defined by the operation itself, for example, face milling is
usually conducted under an ae of 70–80% cutting diameter, or slot operations are conducted with ae equal to tool
diameter. The axial depth of cut is then limited by the stock allowance of the workpiece. For roughing operations,
the depth of cut should initially be chosen to be as large as possible, to reduce the number of cuts required. For
finishing operations, it can be considered a fixed value that corresponds to the remaining material from the last
roughing operation.

The stepwise procedure for defining the cutting parameters is defined as follows:
 
1. Select the cutting speed according to the vendor's recommendations and the desired production requirement,
that is, maximum production or minimum cost as shown in Figure 10.1. The cutting speed for each
production strategy is defined as (DeVries 1991, Chapter 7):
1. Minimum production cost. 
2. Maximum production rate. 
where Tr denotes the tool life (minute) for the reference cutting speed Vr (m/min); n is Taylor's tool‐
life exponent; tc is the tool changing time (minute); Ct is the tool cost ($), and Co is the total
machine and operator's rate ($/min). In relation to the tool cost, regrindable and disposable tools can
be distinguished. Depending on the case, the tool cost is defined as:
 
Disposable inserts. 
, where Pt is the cost of the insert and ne is the number of cutting edges per
insert.
Regrindable tools. 
, where Pt is the cost of the tool, ne is the number of times the tool can
be ground, Tg is the time required for grinding the tool (minute), and Cg is the grinder's rate ($/min).
In industry, the term economic tool life (Te) refers to the tool life's time when the minimum cost
approach is applied, and the term optimum tool life (Tp) when applying the maximum production
rate strategy. The values of 20 and 15 minutes for Te and Tp, respectively (Grzesik 2008), are
usually accepted. Using Taylor's expression, the cutting tool speed is straightforwardly obtained for
each scenario.
To illustrate the evaluation of the cutting speed for maximum production or minimum cost, consider
a turning operation with the following information: tool cost $12, 2 cutting edges per insert, tool
change time 1 minute, $84/hour machine/labor rate ($1.4/min), Taylor’s coefficient 0.25, and tool’s
life is 20 minutes at 150 m/min. Therefore, we have the following:
 
1. Minimum production cost. 
2. Maximum production rate.

Very often, the cutting speed is straightforwardly selected from the vendor's recommendations. The
tables provided by tool manufacturers usually define the cutting speed for a tool life of 15 minutes
of continuous machining operation. The cutting speed is selected as a function of the type of
workpiece material and its hardness. For cutting the same material with different hardness, a
corrector factor is applied to proper adjust the cutting speed. Similarly, to adjust the cutting tool life
for other values such as 20 minutes, 25 minutes, etc., instead of applying Taylor's equation, a
coefficient can be applied to tune the cutting speed. Tables 10.1 and 10.2 show the corrector factors
for both tool life and material hardness according to Sandvik Coromant vendor (Sandvik Coromant
2017). Note that Table 10.2 shows some correction factors on specific materials within the
workpiece group material defined by the letter code (e.g., P, N, etc.) according to ISO 513.
As an example of application, consider as cutting conditions from the catalog a cutting speed of
225 m/min for 15 minutes of tool life when machining low‐alloy steel with HB 180. If the
workpiece to be machined is a similar low‐alloy steel with hardness HB 200 and the desired tool life
is 20 minutes, the correctors to be applied are 0.93 for tool life and 0.91 due to hardness change.
Therefore, the cutting speed required is 225 × 0.93 × 0.91 = 190.4 m/min.
2. Select the feed rate according to the vendor's recommendations. For rough operations, a feed rate to
maximize material removal rates is the most economical approach. For finishing operations, constraints on
surface roughness will limit the feed rate. It should be noted that too low feed rates may make the cutting
process unfeasible and, instead of shearing the material, a rubbing effect may be produced, which leads to
worse surface roughness and larger tool wear rates. In both roughing and finishing operations, feed rates
should be chosen according to tool nose radius and chip‐breaking diagrams of the cutting inserts used.
3. Select the depth of cut to minimize the number of passes. This increases productivity and reduces the cutting
tool wear in comparison with a higher number of passes. The main constraint here is the power consumption
and cutting forces that should be compared with the machine tool and tool holder capabilities, and the
maximum depth of cut limited by the size of the insert.
This stepwise procedure requires checking, at each step, that the constraints that apply to each cutting parameter
are taken into consideration. In case of doubt or for a straightforward parameter selection in machining tests,
middle cutting speeds, lower feed rates, and lighter depth of cuts within the vendor’s recommended ranges are
considered the general practice on the shop floor.
The next subsection shows the constraints that should be considered during the selection of cutting parameters.
10.2.2 General Constraints
10.2.2.1 Constraints on Cutting Speed
 
Limitations due to the maximum spindle speed of the machine tool. The machine tool presents a maximum
spindle speed that cannot be exceeded.
Limitations due to maximum spindle speed allowed by the tool holder/workholding device. Tool holders in
milling/drilling operations and workholding devices in turning operations may present a maximum spindle
speed that must be not exceeded.
As a result from previous constraints, the allowable cutting speed will be limited in the form of:

Note that these are constraints related to maximum cutting speed. Although initially there is no limit to minimum
cutting speed, the vendor's recommendations provide a range since too low cutting speeds produce built‐up edge,
vibration, and low tool‐life values. Thus, cutting speed constraints are defined as follows:
10.2.2.2 Constraints on Feed Rate
 
Limitations due to nose radius (re). The following expressions are commonly applied to limit the maximum
feed rate in turning operations:
Roughing operations: fn ≤ 0.5 × re
Finishing operations: 
 where Ra is the desired surface roughness.
For finishing operations, the theoretical surface roughness value can be estimated as (Stephenson
and Agapiou 2016, Chapter 10):
However, it should be noted that the actual surface finish after machining is usually around 1.5–3
times higher than the theoretical ones. Table 10.3 shows the relationships among nose radius, feed
rate, and surface roughness requirements.

Figure 10.2 Frontal milling and surface roughness
For milling operations, similar equations apply but fz replaces fn values. However, the final
roughness in milling is usually higher due to run‐out errors when mounting the cutting inserts in the
cutter. When the nose radius is negligible, insert angles define the theoretical surface roughness as
follows (DeVries 1991, Chapter 5):
where κ′ is the face cutting‐edge angle and κ is the principal cutting‐edge angle, that is, the entering
angle (see Figure 10.2).
Similarly, in peripheral milling (Figure 10.3), the surface roughness is estimated as
The estimations for peripheral milling are usually modified to include the well‐known effect of
conventional and climb milling. Some authors (DeVries 1991, Chapter 5) correct them by including
an additional term as shown in the following:

Figure 10.3 Peripheral milling and surface roughness.
where z is the number of teeth in the cutter. As it can be seen by the above expression, climb milling
presents lower surface roughness values than conventional milling.
Limitations due to chip‐breaking diagram. Both feed rate and depth of cut should be properly selected to
make the chip‐breaking features of the insert work. Diagrams are provided by insert vendors to show ranges
of operations where the chip breakers work correctly facilitating the chip removal (Figures 10.4 and 10.5).
As a result of previous constraints, the allowable feed rate will be limited by a minimum and maximum value in
the form of

10.2.2.3 Constraints on Depth of Cut
 
Limitations due to cutting‐edge length. The allowable cutting edge in a cutting tool is indicated by the vendor.
For indexable cutting inserts, the allowable cutting edge is around 2/3–1/4 the cutting edge according to the
geometry of the insert. Figure 10.6 shows some effective cut lengths according of to different insert shapes.
Limitations due to chip‐breaking diagram. As shown previously, the depth of cut together with the feed rate
should be selected to ensure that chip breakers work correctly providing a good chip release.

Figure 10.7 Chip formation issues. (a) Problematic long chips due to low depth of cut. (b) Correct
chip formation.

Limitations due to nose radius. A depth of cut too small may produce vibrations, excessive heat, and
difficulties in shearing the workpiece material. As a rule of thumb, the depth of cut should be greater than or
equal to 2/3 of the nose radius. Figure 10.7a, b illustrates the problem of chip formation for low‐depth of cuts.
As a result from previous constraints, the allowable depth of cut will be limited by a minimum and maximum
value in the form of
10.2.2.4 Constraints on Cutting Forces and Power Consumption
 
Maximum cutting forces due to the following features:
 
Tool deformation (Figure 10.8). Deflection produces higher tool wear rates due to runout effects and
quality errors in finishing operations. In general, it is recommended to keep tool deflection below 0.025 
mm, and much less for small tools. Cutting tool deflection can be estimated as (Goodno and Gere 2020)
follows:
where δ is the deflection value (mm); Fc is the cutting force (N); L is the overhang
length of the cutting tool (mm); E is the Young’s modulus of the cutting tool shank
(E = 210,000 N/mm2 for steel); and I is the inertial moment of the shank cross‐

section (mm4). Some common I values are: I = π × D4/64 (round section); I = 1/12 × 
B × H3 (rectangular section).
Workpiece deformation. Similar to tool deflection, the workpiece may deform due to the cutting forces.
Milling thin‐walled parts or turning slender parts may require limiting cutting forces to avoid excessive
deflection and geometrical quality issues.
Tool breakage. If cutting forces are too high, a breakage may occur. Keeping the depth of cuts and feed
rates within the vendor's recommendations according to insert geometry will avoid premature failure.
Appropriate reduced feed rates when entering to cut also avoid potential early breakages.
Maximum machine tool power consumption. This constraint should be considered in roughing operations
where the power demand is higher. This limitation may keep the cutting speed, feed rate, and depth of cut to
be lower than the initial ones. To calculate machine tool power consumption, machine tool efficiency is
usually considered in the range of 0.5–0.8.
Figure 10.8 Cutting tool deflection in milling and turning.
10.2.3 Cutting Force and Power Calculation
The estimation of cutting forces and power consumption is necessary to conduct efficient process planning in
machining. For instance, maximizing the material removal rate in roughing operations requires the estimation of
the cutting force and power consumption to avoid tool breakage or machine tool failures.
Most of cutting tool vendors provide tables, equations, and online calculators for estimating cutting forces and
power requirements. Tables 10.4 and 10.5 show the expressions that can be applied for this purpose in turning,
milling, and drilling operations. Cutting data such as kc1 and mc coefficients can be found in cutting tool vendors'
catalogs and they are also reported in Appendix 2, A2.2 Specific Cutting Force.
Besides previous expressions, it should be noted that tool wear and machining efficiency can have an important
impact on the final machine tool power consumption. For instance, common machine tool efficiency values are
0.5–0.8, and cutting forces and power consumption may increase up to 10–30% due to tool wear.

To illustrate the calculus of cutting forces and power requirements, consider as an example, a face milling
operation conducted with a face cutter of Ø200 mm, 12 inserts, an axial depth of cut 4 mm, and an entering angle
60°. The inserts present a square geometry with a rake angle of –1°. The cutting speed is 150 m/min, the feed rate
is 0.25 mm/tooth, the workpiece material is AISI 1020 steel (nonalloyed steel) and the width of the workpiece is
140 mm. For this operation, the cutting force and cutting power can be obtained as follows.
First, the operation is graphically represented to identify the main cutting parameters, as shown in Figure 10.9.
Then, according to Appendix 2, the material AISI 1020 corresponds to the ISO group P (nonalloyed steels, with
carbon content around 0.2%), and thus, the specific cutting force kc1 and mc coefficient are as follows:
k c1 = 1,500 N/mm2, mc = 0.25
The average chip thickness is found as follows:

Finally, the feed rate and the cutting power are expressed as follows:

The preceding example shows how to calculate cutting forces and power consumption in machining operations.
These values should be then analyzed in terms of machine tool capabilities, potential cutting tool deflections, etc.
Readers may refer to Abellán‐Nebot et al. (2024) for additional examples related to cutting forces and power
consumption in milling, turning, and drilling.
10.3 Specific Guidelines for Turning
In turning operations, the following aspects should be considered:
 
Minimum chip thickness is 5–20% of the cutting‐edge radius. Below that level, chips may not form properly,
and the cutter will “plow” across the workpiece causing plastic deformation and considerable heat. As a
general recommendation, keep the feed rate higher than 0.025 mm/rev to ensure a minimum chip thickness.
Workpiece/tool holder deflections due to cutting forces. The deflection of the workpiece will depend on the
way it is held and the cutting force value. Table 10.6 shows some common workholding systems and
estimated workpiece/tool holder deflections.
Required clamping torque. The maximum torque generated by the cutting force should be supported by the
clamping system during cutting. The cutting torque is calculated as follows:
where Fc is the cutting force calculated as explained previously and d is the distance between the cross‐section cut
and the spindle axis. The clamping torque that the fixturing system can generate should be higher than this cutting
torque. A safety factor is usually added, and a value of 2 or 2.5 is used for new or old workholding devices,
respectively. Fixture vendors usually provide technical information about maximum clamping torques. Figure
10.10 shows an example of the maximum clamping torque for three‐jaw chucks from Röhm GmbH.
10.4 Specific Guidelines in Milling
In milling operations, the following aspects should be considered:
 
Depth of cut recommendations:
 
Slot milling.
 
Flat mills. The maximum axial depth of cut is the tool diameter.
Ball mills. The maximum axial depth of cut is half the tool diameter.

= 1/12 × B × H3 for rectangular cross‐section.

In both cases, the maximum radial depth of cut is the tool diameter.
Square shoulder milling. The maximum axial depth of cut is 1.5 times the tool diameter when the radial
depth of cut is lower than 50% of the tool diameter.
Profile milling. In roughing operations, the radial depth of cut should be less than 0.7 times the tool
diameter, and the axial depth of cut lower than 0.3–0.5 times the tool diameter. For finishing operations,
although it depends on surface roughness, it is recommended axial depth of cuts of 0.025–0.05 times the
tool diameter and radial depths of cut of 0.1 times the tool diameter.
Feed rate correction factors due to chip thinning in side milling. For side milling or low working engagement
with cutter positioned off center, a feed rate corrector should be applied. This is done to keep chip thickness
similar to cutting operations with large engagement. As an example, consider an end milling operation with a
cutter diameter of 40 mm, radial depth of cut 2 mm, and feed rate of 0.11 mm/tooth. The cutter diameter –
radial depth of cut ratio is 40/2 = 20. According to Figure 10.11, the correction factor is 2.8, and thus, the
correct feed rate to generate a proper chip thickness is 0.11 × 2.8 = 0.31 mm/tooth.
Feed rate correction factors due to chip thinning in profile milling. The correction factor of the feed rate
depends on the axial depth of cut according to Table 10.7. Note that profile milling employs ball end mills or
round inserts with indexable tools.
Surface roughness in profile milling. In profile milling, the radial depth of cut defines the resulting surface
roughness (Figure 10.12). As a general practice, a sequence of roughing, semi‐finishing, and finishing
operations is conducted. In the finishing operation, the theoretical surface roughness value can be estimated as
follows:

where R is the tool radius. From this equation, the radial depth of cut to achieve a specific
theoretical surface roughness value is calculated as follows:
Vibrations. Vibrations are always present during machining although they do not suppose a critical problem.
However, in some operations, the frequency of vibrations may be close to the natural frequencies of machine
tools or workpiece–fixture assemblies producing a severe problem in the resulting part quality. This
phenomenon, called chatter, may be avoided by tuning the cutting speed and the depth of the cut. Other
practices are to reduce cutting forces by reducing number of teeth, increase rake angle, and decrease tool
overhang.

10.5 Specific Guidelines in Drilling
In drilling operations, the following aspects should be considered:
 
Buckling. An excessive thrust on a drill may bend the tool leading to buckling and producing an unsafe
condition for anyone in the immediate area. The critical thrust force that should not be exceeded is the critical
buckling Euler force, defined as (Stephenson and Agapiou 2016, Chapter 4) follows:

Figure 10.13 Gripping force for shrinking and hydraulic chucks. Elaborated from technical data.
Source: TaeguTec LTD (2023) and Albrecht Präzision GmbH (2023).
where k defines the drill entry condition; k is 0.2–0.25 for drill‐free point and k is 1–2 if a starting
bushing or pilot hole is used. To avoid the buckling effect, long drills may require either a bushing
or pilot hole. Note that buckling may be a severe issue when long HSS drills are used. On the
contrary, carbide drills are tools three times stiffer than HSS drills of identical design (E = 650 GPa
instead of E = 220 GPa), which make them more appropriate to avoid buckling when thrust forces
are high.
Limitations due to cutting torque on drills. The cutting torque can be estimated by knowing the cutting force
and the distance of the geometric central point on the chip area from the drill axis. The drill holder has a limit
cutting torque so the drilling operation should ensure that this maximum admissible cutting torque is not
exceeded. Drill chucks present higher clamping torque than collet chucks, and thus, drill chucks are preferred
when drilling higher diameters with larger cutting forces. Although it depends on the size and type of the drill
holder, common maximum torque values are 10–20 N·m for drill chucks with a clamping range <Ø15 mm.
For larger drills and more advanced chucks such as hydraulic or shrinking chucks, the admissible cutting
torque can increase notably (Figure 10.13).
10.6 Use of Cutting Fluids
One of the primary methods for maintaining and often improving the performance of cutting tools involves the
utilization of cutting fluids. These cutting fluids serve two essential functions during machining. First, they serve
to cool both the workpiece and the cutting tool, effectively lowering the operating temperature of the tools. This
cooling process aids in preserving the hardness of the tools and prevents the potential distortion of the workpiece

due to excessive heat. Second, cutting fluids function as lubricants between the tool and the workpiece, reducing
friction and contributing to the tool's resistance to wear. This lubrication also helps prevent the accumulation of
chips on the cutting edge of the tool, particularly when machining materials like aluminum and its alloys.
Additionally, cutting fluids offers supplementary benefits such as enhancing the surface finish and facilitating the
removal of chips.
Practically all cutting fluids currently in use can be categorized into one of the following groups: neat cutting oils
(often referred to as straight oils), soluble oils, synthetic oils, and semi‐synthetic oils. Neat oils, which do not
emulsify, are typically employed in an undiluted form for machining. In contrast, soluble oils, the most cost‐
effective among cutting fluids, are commonly diluted before use at typical concentrations of 5–10% oil in water to
form an emulsion. Synthetic oils, known for their superior cooling properties, are composed of alkaline
compounds and additives and are also generally employed in diluted form. Semi‐synthetic oils combine
characteristics from both synthetic and soluble oils, offering a balance between the two in terms of cost and heat
dissipation properties.
The selection of cutting fluids is carried out according to the type of machining process, workpiece material, and
cutting tool material. The following recommendations can be considered when choosing the proper cutting fluid in
machining (Çakīr et al. 2007; Oberg et al. 2004):
 
Cutting fluids and machining processes.
 
Heavy machining processes (e.g., broaching, tapping, reaming, and gear cutting) generally require neat
cutting oils. These processes are conducted at low cutting speeds with high pressure in the cutting area
which require more of lubrication than cooling to reduce friction at the tool and chip contacts to avoid
built‐up edge formation.
In turning, milling, and grinding machining processes, water‐based cutting fluids are more suitable due
to their cooling capabilities. At higher cutting speeds, temperatures are higher between the tool and the
workpiece which may produce welds, so the cooling effect of the cutting fluid is mandatory.
In drilling operations, coolant supply can be internal or external. Internal coolant supply is preferred in
long‐chipping materials and when drilling deeper holes (higher than three times tool diameter) whereas
the external coolant supply can be used when chip formation is good and when hole depth is shallow.
Cutting fluids and workpiece material (carbide tools applied).
 
Gray cast iron is commonly machined dry since graphite content acts as a natural lubricant. A soluble oil
or low‐viscosity mineral oil may be used to prevent excessive metal dust.
Copper alloys are chemically attacked by sulfurs and chlorides, so cutting oils without these additives
are required. Similar to cast iron, they lubricate well by themselves so very little extra lubrication is
needed. If needed, soluble oil mixed to 1 part oil and 20–25 parts water may be satisfactory.
Aluminum alloys may be machined dry, although cutting fluids with high ability to act as coolant, for
example, soluble oils, are preferred. Furthermore, aluminum alloys may require cutting fluids for a good
chip formation and evacuation to avoid smearing on the insert edges and to improve surface finish.
Magnesium alloys require neat cutting oils of low viscosity. Water‐based fluids should not be used
because of the fire danger when magnesium chips react with water forming hydrogen gas.
Heat‐resistant and difficult‐to‐cut steel alloys put significant thermal and mechanical strains on tools
producing extremely high abrasive wear. Cutting fluids are mandatory in these applications using
specific formulations with extreme pressure additives. Water‐based cutting fluids are preferred because
of the high temperature reached at the cutting area.
Low‐carbon and hardened steels may be machined dry‐ or air‐cooled assisted, especially in milling
operations with carbide inserts to minimize thermal shock issues which could chip, crack, and eventually
break the insert. To improve surface roughness, soluble oils are also typically applied.
Stainless steels. Present lower heat conductivity and the cutting fluids usually applied here are water‐
soluble oils, usually in proportions of one part oil to 12–20 parts water and sulfochlorinated cutting oils.
Cutting fluids and cutting tool material.
 

Ceramic cutting tools are generally used in finish machining operations with the use of sprayed air to
facilitate chip removal. Oil‐based cutting oil can be also employed but water‐soluble cutting oil should
be avoided.
Cubic boron nitrate (CBN) and polycrystalline diamonds (PCD) cutting tools can resist high‐temperature
machining conditions, and thus, cutting fluids are typically not required. They are typically employed in
finish machining operations to provide high dimensional accuracy and great surface finish quality.

To illustrate the methodology of setting the process parameters, operations 1f (face turning) and 10d (drilling) are
detailed in the following. Note that to select the cutting parameters for the rest of machining operations the same
procedure can be followed.
a) Face turning, operation 1f
 
Tool T11 D3. Tool holder PCLNL 2020K12, insert CNMG 120408 Iscar IC20.
The workpiece material is aluminum AISI SC64D, which corresponds to the N group according to ISO 513.
Cutting data according to vendor's recommendations for straight and face turning operations assuming an
insert grade with less wear resistance than toughness are (Appendix 2):
The machining allowance is 3 ± 0.5 mm from the casting process. Only a finishing operation to remove 3 mm is
the option considered in Chapter 8. The cutting speed selected is 770 m/min. The feed rate depends on the surface
roughness specification. Since Ra should be 1.6 μm or lower, the theoretical maximum feed is expressed as
since re is 0.8 mm according to the insert ISO code. However, Table 10.3 indicates for these cutting conditions an
actual feed rate of 0.15 mm/rev; thus, a feed rate of 0.15 mm/rev is selected, which is within the recommended
vendor’s range of [0.15 – 0.8] mm/rev.
 
Spindle speed (N) and feed rate (Vf). Note that the machining operation is a face turning, so the spindle speed
should vary to keep the same cutting speed (Vc) during turning. Thus, the maximum spindle speed and feed
rate are given at the minimum workpiece diameter.

 
Depth of cut (ap).
The maximum depth of cut is predefined from the machining allowance, 3 mm, and casting tolerance, ±0.5 mm.
Then,
The maximum depth of cut due to the limitation of the length of the cutting edge is
where L is the length of cut, 12 mm according to the tool insert code. Then, the tool insert can be used for
machining 3.5 mm depth. However, the feasibility of this operation depends on the machine tool and workholding
constraints related to power consumption and clamping torque limitations. Therefore, the cutting force and power
consumption should be estimated as follows.
First, a drawing with the main parameters of the operation studied is elaborated, as shown in Figure 10.15.
Then, the specific cutting force is estimated as
Figure 10.15 Face turning operation analyzed. Main parameters for cutting force calculation.
where the workpiece material is aluminum AISI SC64D which means kc1 and mc are 600 N/mm2 and 0.25 (ISO N
and “cast, nonaging” subgroup), respectively (Appendix 2), and the chip thickness is calculated as

Next, the cutting force is estimated as
Thus, the cutting power is:
and considering the machining efficiency, the power consumption is calculated as
The lathe machine has a power consumption limitation of 10 kW, so the operation is feasible. On the contrary, the
maximum cutting torque is given at the outer diameter, thus
Considering that the maximum torque due to the clamping system is 40 N·m, the operation is feasible.

Tool T132. Drill holder with spot drill TR‐BR‐2F‐6‐HSS and Tool T140: Drill holder with twist drill TR‐BR‐
2F‐10‐HSS uncoated.
Cutting data according to vendor's recommendations. The workpiece material is aluminum AISI SC64D with
a Si content of 5.5–6.5%, therefore, the following parameters are defined (see Appendix 2):
 
Spot drilling:
:
It is chosen to be Vc = 50 m/min.
Drilling:
It is chosen to be Vc = 30 m/min.
Spindle speed (N) and feed rate (Vf).
 
Spot drilling:
; Vf = N × fn = 769 mm/min
Drilling:
; Vf = N × fn = 301 mm/min
Depth of cut.
The depth of cut is predefined by the size of the hole to be machined. However, it is necessary to ensure that there
is no problem with the machine tool's power consumption, the buckle effect of the drill, and the maximum
permissible cutting torque applied to the drill holder.

The study for the spot drilling operation is skipped since is not a critical operation. For the drilling operation, a
drawing to illustrate the main cutting parameters is shown in Figure 10.16. For this operation, the specific cutting
force is found as follows:
since the workpiece material aluminum AISI SC64D has kc1 = 600N/mm2 and mc = 0.25, and the chip thickness is
Figure 10.16 Drilling operation analyzed. Main parameters for cutting force calculation.
Assuming negligible the chisel edge, the cutting force per tooth is
Note that as the drill has two teeth, the total cutting force is
Thus, the cutting power is

and considering the machining efficiency, the power consumption is
which is lower than the machining center limitation, 20 kW.
The thrust force is estimated as
The critical thrust force to prevent the buckling effect is
where k is 0.2–0.25, E = 220 GPa, L = 70 mm (overhang of the drill where the total length of the drill is 90 mm), I
= π·D4/64. Thus, there is no buckling effect in this drilling operation.
Finally, the cutting torque applied to the drill holder is
which is lower than the drill holder's torque limitation of 10 N·m. As a conclusion, the drilling operation is
feasible.

Geometric Validation: Tolerance Charting
11.1 Introduction
The primary aim of process planning is to create a cost‐effective process plan that ensures the production of
components within design specifications. The geometric validation of process plans is based on tolerance analysis
where it is evaluated the impact of the natural variations of manufacturing processes and raw materials on the
resulting machined dimensions. For uncomplicated parts that can be machined directly with most or all of their
design dimensions, there is little need for tolerance analysis. In those cases, the design dimensions are obtained
using as datum (i.e., locating surface) the surface itself that defines the design dimensions. Consequently, the
tolerance of the dimension matches the tolerance of the manufacturing process, and there is no accumulation of
tolerances stemming from datum changes. Under these scenarios, geometric validation is ensured while the
selected processes and machinery are capable of producing parts within the specified design tolerances.
However, tolerance analysis becomes significantly more challenging when dealing with complex parts, tight
design tolerances, frequent datum changes, and a large number of operations required. Under these conditions,
tolerances from various operations accumulate, leading to stackups on the design dimensions. Thus, to validate the
process plan, both design dimensions and stock removals should be analyzed to ensure machining feasibility and
part tolerances. To address this issue, a formal technique called tolerance charting has been applied for decades.
Tolerance charting is widely utilized in the aerospace and automotive industries, particularly for parts with tight
tolerances produced through machining processes like turning, milling, and grinding. In these industries, tolerance
charting is typically carried out either manually or with the assistance of computer programs. Despite the
significant advantages it offers, tolerance charting remains relatively unpopular outside of the automotive and
aerospace sectors due to be considered a complex tool.
This chapter presents a methodology for 1D tolerance charting from references Whybrew and Britton (1997),
Jeang (1996), and Thumm et al. (2002) based on traditional tolerance charting with a rooted (datum hierarchy) tree
technique. Although there are commercial tools for 3D tolerance analysis to ensure geometric product validation
within computer‐aided (CAD) environments (CETOL 6σ is one of these popular software), these tools are mainly
focused on assembly validation. 1D tolerance charting techniques may provide sufficient insights for geometric
validation in simple machined products considering machining and fixture tolerances. Tolerance charting is
commonly applied after machining sequencing to validate the geometrical product specifications, and, if
specifications are not met, re‐sequencing of the machining operations is conducted. Alternatively, tolerance
charting can be also applied to calculate the efficiency of different process plans to facilitate process plan selection
(Britton et al. 2001).
11.2 Definition of Terms
To construct tolerance charts, the following terms should be defined: design dimensions, preform dimensions,
working dimensions, balancing dimensions, resultant dimensions, and stock removal allowances. These terms are
defined in the following and – for illustrative purposes – their definition is applied to the example shown in Figure
11.1a, b.
 
Design dimensions. The workpiece dimensions indicated in the design drawing or CAD model are known as
design dimensions (Figure 11.1a). They may also be referred to as blueprint dimensions. They consist of two
parts, a nominal value and a tolerance, which is the allowed deviation from the nominal dimension. It is
important to convert dimensions so that the tolerances are in evenly disposed bilateral form to make the
calculation easier. For instance, a dimension like 
 must be transformed into 20.2 ± 0.1 mm.
Preform dimensions. The dimensions of the raw material, such as a sawn bar, forging, or casting, are known
as preform dimensions. Additionally, they include nominal and tolerance elements. In Figure 11.1a, the
preform dimensions are 87 ± 0.8 mm.

Working dimensions. Working dimensions are those assigned to each machining operation. A nominal
dimension and a tolerance are both components of a working dimension. The tolerance is the process
tolerance, that is, the variability of the machining operation due to accuracy limitations. As shown in Figure
11.1b, the working dimensions are the dimensions cut at each operation with the corresponding variability. At
the first subjob, the nominal working dimensions for face turning and internal face turning are 86 and 71 mm,
respectively. Assuming a machining tolerance of 0.02 mm, the working dimensions are 86 ± 0.02 and 71 ± 
0.02 mm.
Balancing dimensions. Working dimensions can be used to derive balancing dimensions, which are distances
between workpiece surfaces. The balancing dimension is an intermediate outcome dimension if additional
processing is to be performed on either one of the two surfaces constituting the dimension. Because balancing
dimensions are derived from working dimensions, they also include nominal and tolerance components. For
instance, the distance between the two machined surfaces at the first subjob is a balancing dimension with a
value of 15 ± 0.04 mm. As can be seen, the result of 0.04 mm comes from a tolerance stackup since the
process tolerance is accumulated within the two operations, each one with a process tolerance of ±0.02 mm.
Figure 11.1 (a) Design and preform dimensions for a given part. (b) Subjobs, working dimensions,
and stock removal.
Resultant dimensions. A resultant dimension is a special case of a balancing dimension when it results in a
design dimension. To ensure that the design dimensions can be met, nominal and tolerance stackups of the
resultant dimensions must be evaluated and they should fall within the range of design dimensions.
Otherwise, a percentage of the manufactured products would be out of specification. For instance, the
distance between the two working dimensions from subjob 2 results in the design dimension that, according
to the initial specifications, should be within the value 20.2 ± 0.1 mm. The working dimensions are 64.8 and
85 mm with a process tolerance of ±0.02 mm, and thus, the resultant dimension from these two working
dimensions is 85 ± 0.02 – (64.8 ± 0.02) = 20.2 ± 0.04 mm, where a tolerance stackup of 0.04 mm arises. The
upper and lower limits of the resultant dimension must fall within the range of the design dimensions to be
considered acceptable, as occurs in this example.

Stock removal allowance. The stock removal allowance is the difference between the dimensions before and
after machining. In other words, it is the quantity of material left on a surface for that surface's subsequent
machining operation and it depends on the type of operation to be conducted, the precision of previous
manufacturing operations, etc. As it has been explained, a working dimension has a process tolerance due to
machining variability. Therefore, the stock removed in a machining operation will present a tolerance value.
Additionally, the machining allowance from previous manufacturing processes (e.g., forming, casting)
presents some degree of variability. To define a correct process plan, the stock removal allowance must be
checked to be positive (i.e., enough material should exist to conduct machining) to ensure machining
feasibility. Otherwise, there might be insufficient stock material to be removed and surface cutting may be not
produced, leaving the dimensions out of specifications. Note that the stock removal may present a tolerance
stackup depending on the sequence of machining. An example of tolerance stackup in stock removal is shown
in Figure 11.1. The raw material has a preform dimension of 87 ± 0.8 mm, and the final length of the part is
85 mm. The machining process is carried out in a lathe, with two subjobs. At the first subjob, a face turning
operation is conducted with a working dimension of 86 mm. The process tolerance is ±0.02 mm; thus, the
stock removal is (87 − 86) ± 0.8 ± 0.02 = 1 ± 0.82 mm. In the worst‐case scenarios, the machining operation
would remove a maximum value of 1.82 mm or a minimum value of 0.18 mm. As can be seen, even in these
worst‐case scenarios, the machining operation is feasible (nonnegative values). At the second subjob, the left
side of the part is machined. Initially, there is a machining allowance of 1 mm (86 – 85 mm = 1 mm). Since
the right surface has been previously machined to 86 ± 0.02 mm, the stock removal is (86 – 85) ± 0.02 ± 0.02
= 1 ± 0.04 mm. At this subjob, the worst‐case scenario is 1.04 and 0.96 mm since there is no effect of the
preform dimensional tolerance.
11.3 Steps for Tolerance Charting
A tolerance chart is a combined graphical and tabular record of a machining sequence that facilitates checking of
1D tolerance stacks (Thimm et al. 2002). Its purpose is to assess whether a specific machining sequence is suitable
for producing the part with the desired dimensions and tolerances and to ensure that material removal operations
are appropriately assigned during the machining process. In simpler terms, the chart is employed to geometrically
validate the process plan (Kim and Dong 2005).
Figure 11.2 illustrates the key components of a tolerance chart. At the top center, a depiction of the part is
provided. Leader lines, also known as face lines, extend from this depiction to indicate the surfaces, points, and
centerlines on the part that will define the locating surface and the machined surfaces. These lines are numbered
sequentially from left to right using two‐digit numbers (e.g., 01, 02, etc.) and serve as start and end points for
tolerance chart symbols (Figure 11.3). The tail of the arrows defined in these chart symbols indicates the locating
surface for the operation and the head indicates the machined surface. Within the middle section of the chart, data
pertaining to operations, working dimensions, operation symbols, and tolerances related to stock removal are
recorded. The chart shows the sequence of machining operations, from top to bottom. At the bottom of the chart,
the resultant dimensions are calculated and compared to the design data.
In addition to the tolerance chart, the rooted tree and the stock removal set table are also drawn (Figure 11.4). The
rooted tree is a directed graph of working dimensions (i.e., machining operations) with no loops that indicates the
datum hierarchy for a machining sequence (Thimm et al. 2002; Whybrew et al. 1990). The nodes represent
surfaces and the arcs represent operations. The nodes and arcs can include tolerance information about fixturing
tolerance and machining tolerance, respectively. The stock removal set defines a table with dimensional
information with respect to a surface reference that is used to calculate the nominal dimensions between surfaces.

Figure 11.2 Basic features of a tolerance chart.
Figure 11.3 Tolerance chart symbols.

Figure 11.4 Additional features to build the tolerance chart. Rooted tree and stock removal set.
Tolerance charting can be conducted in the following six main steps:
 
1. Create the rooted tree and start chart preparation.
2. Write design dimensions, process tolerances, and raw surface tolerances.
3. Define a surface reference and write the stock removal set table.
4. Calculate the resultant dimensions and verify that they are within design tolerances.
5. Calculate the stock removal for critical surfaces and verify its positive value.
6. Calculate working dimensions.
To understand the tolerance charting procedure, the process of drawing the chart for the previous example (Figure
11.1) is discussed step by step in the following sections.
11.3.1 Step 1: Create the Rooted Tree and Start Chart Preparation
The initial step in creating the chart involves starting with a blank template chart. Then, the outline of the finished
part is drawn at the top of the chart and the face lines are added. Subsequently, the sequence of machining
operations is analyzed and the rooted tree graph is created. To draw the rooted tree, the surfaces should be
numerated distinguishing the surface state before and after machining. Each surface is assigned a unique four‐digit
number where the initial two digits designate the stock removal set and the last two digits are related to the number
of cuts made on a surface.
From previous example, four workpiece surfaces are identified together with four stock removal sets numbered 01,
02, 03, and 04. The first state of each surface, i.e., the first creation of the surface, adds the digits 00 to its removal
set. If the surface is generated after cutting a surface that was previously created, then, the digits 01 are added.
Consequently, 0200 means the creation of surface 02, while 0101 denotes the first cut on surface 01, which existed
from a prior operation. From the example, it can be seen that surfaces 0100 and 0101 refers to surface 01 from
casting and to surface 01 after machining the casting surface, respectively. However, surface 0200 refers to surface

02 after machining because there is no previous casting surface. Therefore, surfaces before and after machining
form part of the same stock removal set.
After numeration, the tree graph is built to represent the sequence of machining and the hierarchy of datums. In the
rooted tree, each node on the graph denotes either a processed surface, a reference surface, or both, and each link
connecting two immediate nodes corresponds to a single machining operation with the corresponding machining
tolerance. The tree starts with the preform surfaces drawn at the top. For example, the surfaces 0100 and 0400 are
drawn first since they are the casting surfaces available before machining. The relation between preform surfaces
is shown in dashed lines, and the tolerance of the preform surfaces is stated in the diagram. For this example, a
casting tolerance is indicated as tp = ±0.8 mm.
Then, below the preform surfaces, the surfaces that are created in the first subjob are drawn. A link is added
between the datum surface from subjob 1 and the surfaces generated. The links are solid lines to differentiate from
those related to the preform dimensions with an arrowhead pointing toward the machined surface. Each link in the
rooted tree is numbered following the manufacturing sequence and numbering first the preform links. The
construction of the tree proceeds from top to bottom, and when a new job/subjob is identified (i.e., a different setup
for part location), the rooted tree is extended downward.
After the creation of the rooted tree (Figure 11.5), the left part of the chart shown in Figure 11.2 can be completed.
The column “Line” refers to the number of each link of the rooted tree whereas the column “Op. N” refers to the
number of the machining operation according to the established machining sequence. The center of the chart is
also completed with the same information of the rooted tree, relating with solid or dashed lines the surfaces of the
workpiece that is represented at the top of the chart. The chart symbols from Figure 11.3 are used to indicate if the
line refers to a preform, working, or design dimensions.
11.3.2 Step 2: Write Design Dimensions, Process Tolerances, and Raw Surface Tolerances
Next, the part drawing or CAD model's part dimensions and tolerances are retrieved, and these values are put at
the bottom of the chart. Tolerances related to processes and raw surfaces are known and are explicitly listed in the
tolerance chart under column ± Tol.
After steps 1 and 2, the resulting tolerance chart is shown in Figure 11.6.

Figure 11.5 Rooted tree for the previous example.

Figure 11.6 Tolerance chart for the example. Steps 1 and 2. Units in mm.
11.3.3 Step 3: Define a Surface Reference and Write the Stock Removal Set Table
The stock removal set table is a useful tool to obtain the working and resultant dimensions in a straightforward
way. In this table, the columns indicate the stock removal sets and the rows are the cut number (positions) in the
sets. To construct the table, a surface reference is first defined. In this example, the left surface of the machined
part, named 0101, is considered the reference, and thus, its value is 0. The raw state of this surface is named 0100
and its value is −1 mm since there is a 1‐mm machining allowance from the raw surface. The rest of the
dimensions can be obtained knowing that surface 0101 is the reference (i.e., origin for dimensions), the dimensions
of all surfaces are known from the design drawing and the machining allowance is 1 mm. Following this approach,
the stock removal set is defined as shown in Figure 11.7.

Figure 11.7 Stock removal set table for the example. Units in mm.
11.3.4 Step 4: Calculate the Resultant Dimensions and Verify
To calculate the nominal value of a resultant dimension, identify the two surfaces involved. Extract their surface
positions from the stock removal set table and take the absolute difference between them. For instance, the
resultant dimension to verify if the first design dimension is reached (85 ± 0.4 mm) involves surfaces 0101 and
0401. From the stock removal set (Figure 11.7), the nominal values of 0101 and 0401 are 0 and 85 mm,
respectively, which results in a nominal value of 85 – 0 = 85 mm.
After calculating the nominal value of the resultant dimension directly from the stock removal set, the tolerance of
the resultant dimension is evaluated. The following calculation method is used to easily calculate the tolerance
stackup for the resultant dimensions (Britton 2000; Whybrew and Britton 1997):
 
1. Identify one of the two surfaces that define the resultant dimension.
2. Find the path on the rooted tree between this surface and the other surface of the resultant dimension.
3. Add the tolerances of all the operations that contribute to the path to determine the tolerance stacks for the
resulting dimension.
This process is repeated for all resultant dimensions. After the tolerance stackup has been calculated, its value
should be lower than or equal to the corresponding design tolerance to ensure this specification. Otherwise, the
process planner should consider other alternative machining sequences to reduce the tolerance stackup and ensure
part quality.
Applying this procedure for the first resultant dimension, the path on the tree is 0401 – 0101. In this case, the
tolerance of the resultant dimension is just defined by the tolerance of a machining operation (i.e., there is no
stackup) and it is equal to ±0.02 mm. Thus, the resultant dimension is 85 ± 0.02 mm, which is within the design
dimensions, of 85.0 ± 0.4 mm.
However, the second resulting dimension defined by surfaces 0101 and 0200 determines the path 0101‐0401‐0200
from the rooted tree. The path shows two machining operations, thus, a stackup tolerance of ±0.02 ± 0.02 = ±0.04 
mm is generated. Since design tolerance is ±0.1 mm for this specification, the sequence is validated.
Surfaces 0200 and 0300 define the third design dimension. Following the path from the rooted tree (see Figure
11.8), lines 2, 3, and 5 yield the resultant tolerance, which is ±0.02 ± 0.02 ± 0.02 = ±0.06 mm. This value is entered
in the chart, and it is again compared with the tolerance of the design dimension to verify if the specification is
met.

11.3.5 Step 5: Calculate the Stock Removal and Verify
The nominal and tolerance of the stock removal values are calculated similar to the resultant dimensions. First, the
stock removal set is used to calculate the nominal values, and then, the tolerance stackup is obtained by adding the
tolerances identified in the path of the rooted tree. The calculations are listed below:
 
Stock removal set 01
The stock removal set 01 refers to the difference between the raw state and the machined state of surface 01 and it
is defined by the dimension between 0100 and 0101. The nominal value is 1 mm according to the stock removal
set table (Figure 11.7, absolute difference between 0100 and 0101). The tolerance of the stock removal set is
obtained by analyzing the path 0100‐0101 from the rooted tree. As shown in the rooted tree, the path is 0100‐0401‐
0101 and the tolerance stackup is ±0.02 ± 0.02 = ±0.04 mm. This value is added to the chart below the ±tol column
for stock removals.
Figure 11.8 Path between 0200 and 0300 surfaces and resulting stackup. Units in mm.
 
Stock removal set 04
The nominal value is 1 mm since this stock removal set is obtained from 0400‐0401. The path from the rooted tree
is 0400‐0100‐0401 and lines 1 and 2 contribute to the tolerance stackup. The stackup tolerance is ±0.8 ± 0.02 =
±0.82 mm since the tolerance of the preform dimension is included in the path.

Finally, sets 02 and 03 contain only one surface state, and thus, there is no stock removal to check. In these cases,
the stock removal allowance is set to “solid” in the chart.
At this step, the tolerance stackup values are compared with the stock removal allowances to verify that, even in
the worst‐case scenario, enough stock material is available to conduct the machining operation. For this example,
in both cases, the allowances are greater than the stackups since the nominal stock allowance is 1 mm, and the
tolerance stackups are ±0.04 and ±0.82 mm.
11.3.6 Step 6: Calculate Working Dimensions
The nominal values of the working dimensions can be computed once the machining sequence has been validated
by verifying the design specifications and the stock removals. Following the same procedure, the following
working dimensions are defined:
 
Operation 1, line 2 of the chart. Surface 0100‐0401. Nominal value from the stock removal set: 85 − (−1) =
86 mm.
Operation 2, line 3 of the chart. Surface 0100‐0300. Nominal value from the stock removal set: 70 − (−1) =
71 mm.
Operation 3, line 4 of the chart. Surface 0401‐0101. Nominal value from the stock removal set: 85 − 0 = 85 
mm.
Operation 4, line 5 of the chart. Surface 0401‐0200. Nominal value from the stock removal set: 85 − 20.2 =
64.8 mm.
After this step‐by‐step methodology, the final tolerance chart is shown in Figure 11.9.

Figure 11.9 Resulting tolerance chart for the example. Units in mm.
11.3.7 Adding Fixturing Tolerances
The methodology previously presented has been reported in several technical documents (Britton 2000; Jeang
1996) and illustrates how to add the machining and preform tolerances (e.g., casting tolerances) for process
planning validation. The methodology can also include the fixturing tolerance, which is one of the main factors in
tolerance stackup. This tolerance is added to the rooted tree below each surface that is used as a locating surface.
To understand the stackup mechanism for fixturing tolerances, consider the dimension 0101‐0200 from the
previous example. As can be seen, this dimension is obtained under the same subjob, by clamping surface 0401
and machining both 0101 and 0200. If a fixturing error exists, its effect will show up on both machined surfaces,
but the dimension defined by the distance between both surfaces will remain unaffected. In other words, fixturing
errors do not affect when the resultant distance looked for in the rooted tree is in the same subjob.
Now consider the dimension 0300‐0101. In this case, the dimension is between two features machined in different
subjobs, and the fixture error will have an impact. According to the rooted tree, the path is 0300‐0100‐0401‐0101.
The fixturing error in the first subjob (i.e., when the locating surface is 0100) does not affect the path since the
error in the dimension 0300‐0100 and the error 0100‐0401 is compensated, and only machining errors will
influence the path 0300‐0100‐0401. However, at the second subjob the fixturing error will affect the final tolerance

additionally to the machining error. Therefore, the dimension 0300‐0101 will present a stackup of three machining
tolerances (lines 2, 3, and 4), and the fixturing tolerance at the second subjob (0401) while the fixturing tolerance
at the first subjob (0100) is not included. Assuming a fixture tolerance of ±0.1 mm, the resulting tolerance stackup
is ±0.02 ± 0.02 ± 0.02 ± 0.1 = ±0.16 mm. Figure 11.10 illustrates the path studied in the rooted tree and the resulting
tolerance stackup extracted from the diagram.
Following this reasoning, the resulting tolerance chart from the previous example is shown in Figure 11.11.
Figure 11.10 Path between 0101 and 0300 surfaces and resulting stackup considering fixturing tolerances added
below each locating surface. Note that the fixture tolerance in 0100 is not considered since 0401 and 0300 share
the same fixture tolerance. Units in mm.

CNC Programming
12.1 Introduction
There is a wide variety of industrial equipment that works with computer numerical control (CNC), such as
bending machines, punching machines, lathes, milling machines, machining centers, electrical discharge
machining equipment, welding machines, robots, laser cutters, 3D printing machines, etc. Among all these
equipment, machine tools and machining operations are the most common CNC applications.
The main advantages of CNC applied to small and medium production batches in machining are the reduction of
total machining time, the increase of manufacturing flexibility (simple changes in the CNC code result in different
machining operations), and more accurate movements (i.e., higher precision and accuracy) with respect to
manually operated machine tools. Considering that almost all metal components require, at some point, a
machining operation, it is easy to understand that CNC machine tools are commonly available in almost all
manufacturing companies.
When dealing with process planning in machining, CNC programs should be elaborated and checked using CNC
code simulators or computer‐aided manufacturing (CAM) programs. In this chapter, the fundamentals of CNC
programming to create machining programs are presented. The chapter describes the different coordinate systems
that are defined in common machine tools and the basic commands for manual CNC programming according to
the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard. Basic functions for linear and circular
movements, cutting tool compensations, feed and speed programming, or other auxiliary functions are presented
employing some examples. The explanation of CNC canned cycles completes the overview of CNC programming.
Finally, some guidelines for proper cutting tool trajectories are presented and illustrated with practical examples in
milling, turning, drilling, and threading operations. Readers interested in a more detailed explanation of CNC
programming may refer to Smid (2003) and Kumar et al. (2020).
12.2 CNC Machine Tools
12.2.1 Nomenclature of Machine Tool Axes
All movements programmed numerically in a machine tool numerical control are referred to as a system of
Cartesian axes. The denomination, placement, and orientation of each axis are standardized according to the “ISO
841: 2001 Industrial automation systems and integration, numerical control of machines, coordinate systems and
motion nomenclature” (ISO 2001). The main axes of a machine tool are called X, Y, and Z. These axes are defined
as follows:
 
Z‐axis. In machine tools where the workpiece has the rotary cutting motion (for example, on a lathe), the Z‐
axis is parallel to the machine spindle, and a positive movement moves the tool away from the workpiece. In
machines where the cutting tool has the rotary cutting motion (such as a machining center), the Z‐axis is
parallel to the tool axis.
X‐axis.
 
In lathes, the X‐axis leads the direction of movement of the tool, and a positive movement moves the tool
away from the workpiece.
In vertical machining centers, the positive X‐axis direction is to the right of the programmer when it is in
front looking at the machine.
In horizontal machining centers, the X‐axis is parallel to the workbench.
In all cases, the X‐axis is perpendicular to the Z‐axis defined above.
 

Y‐axis. The Y‐axis is determined from the X‐axis and the Z‐axis so that the three form a coordinate system
(right‐hand rule).
Figure 12.1 shows graphically the definitions of the axes in a CNC lathe and a vertical machining center.
12.2.2 Coordinate Systems in Machine Tools: Reference Systems
Machine tools are systems where the position of cutting tools is defined by CNC programs to create specific
trajectories. The CNC programs specify the coordinates of the cutting tool in X, Y, and Z directions with respect to
a coordinate system. To understand the definition of the coordinate system in CNC programs, it is important to
understand the different coordinate systems that are defined in machine tools and their interrelation. The following
coordinate systems can be used to define the reference system in the CNC program: machine coordinate system
(MCS), fixture coordinate system (FCS), and workpiece/part coordinate system (WCS) (Fagor Automation 2024a).
 
Machine coordinate system (MCS).
Figure 12.1 Definition of axes X, Y, and Z in a CNC lathe and a vertical machining center.
The MCS is defined by the vendor and specifies the physical movement of the axis of the machine tool following
the standard ISO 841: 2001. The origin of this coordinate system is named as machine zero, and at this position,
the value of all axes is 0. The physical location of the machine zero depends on the type of machine tool and it is
defined by the machine tool manufacturer. In lathes, machine zero is usually placed at the frontal face of the
spindle and over the Z‐axis. In milling machines, the machine zero is usually placed at one extreme point of its
machining volume.
 
Fixture coordinate system (FCS).

The FCS is defined by the fixture used, and it is defined with respect to the MCS as the “fixture offset.” To use the
FCS, it must be set in the CNC program to activate it or should be previously defined from the CNC's front panel.
When the machine has several fixtures, each one may have its own reference system associated with it. Similar to
the previous coordinate system, the origin of this coordinate system is named as fixture zero.
 
Workpiece/Part coordinate system (WCS).
To facilitate the programming task, the CNC programmer may define a WCS to which the cutting tool movements
are referred. The origin point of this coordinate system is named as part zero, and it should be clearly defined in
the machining operation sheet so that the machinist can define the workpiece zero in relationship with the machine
zero as the “part offset.” Similar to the FCS, to use the WCS, it must be set in the CNC program to activate it or
should be previously defined from the CNC's front panel.
Figure 12.2 illustrates the different coordinate systems in CNC lathes and machining centers.
In addition to these coordinate systems, two other reference coordinate systems are defined: the tool coordinate
system and the reference or home coordinate system.
 
Tool coordinate system (TCS).
The TCS is used to calibrate cutting tools since it defines the position of the cutting tool tip with respect to the
MCS. When calibrating the cutting tools, the position of the cutting tool tip with respect to this coordinate system
is set. Thus, a proper radius and length compensation during machining can be done (Figure 12.3a, b).
 
Reference or home coordinate system (RCS).

system (WCS) in a lathe and a milling machine.

When initializing the machine tool, the controller starts to perform a “home search” and the axes move to the
machine reference point that the machine manufacturer has previously set with respect to the MCS. When reaching
this reference point, the CNC assumes the coordinate values assigned to that point, and the machine tool is ready to
operate. The RCS is commonly set to a corner of the working volume to avoid any type of collision when
powering up the machine tool and start searching home.
12.3 Programming CNC Machine Tools
A CNC program can be generated in three different ways: manual programming, computer‐aided programming,
and conversational programming.
12.3.1 Manual Programming
The code is created directly by the programmer, line by line. The program can be done using ISO codes (G‐codes)
or a specific language compatible with the CNC controller. The manual programming is conducted using specific
software to simulate CNC code, where the programmer can check the cutting tool trajectories before launching the
program. Figure 12.4 shows an example of G‐code simulation using the software CNC simulator.
12.3.2 Computer‐Aided Programming
CAM software, such as SolidCam, MasterCam, NX CAM, ProEngineer, etc., is used to generate the CNC
program. In this case, each machining operation is defined by the user with its appropriate cutting tool and cutting
conditions using the software. When all the required inputs are provided, the software generates a high‐level
program with the cutting tool trajectories that need to be postprocessed in the specific machine tool language or
ISO format.
The main benefit of this procedure is that the programmer does not have to define line by line the cutting tool
trajectories since this is now the computer task. Furthermore, the computer‐aided approach detects cutting tool
collisions, quality defects, etc. Figure 12.5 shows an example of CNC simulation and rapid collision detection in
SolidWorks CAM. Figure 12.6 shows an example of postprocessing the CNC program for a FANUC controller in
SolidWorks CAM.

Figure 12.7 Example of conversational programming. (a) FAGOR 8055‐T panel and thread cycle. (b) Sinutrain
v4.8 programming software.
12.3.3 Conversational Programming
This programming procedure is conducted directly on the machine tool. The machine tool gives the operator the
possibility of creating a CNC program using a series of menus and pop‐ups that the operator has to fill in according
to the desired cutting tool trajectories. Figure 12.7a shows an example of conversational programming of a CNC
lathe with a FAGOR 8055‐T controller. Additionally, most of CNC controller manufacturers provide software to
simulate the panel and controller functionalities at a computer workstation instead of working on the shop floor.
Then, conversational programming is conducted in the technical office and, after simulation, the program is
uploaded into the machine tool. Figure 12.7b shows an example of the use of Sinutrain v4.8, a simulation software,
from SIEMENS to simulate SINUMERIK controllers.
12.4 Basic Concepts of CNC Programming. G‐Code
To program CNC machine tools, different programming languages can be applied depending on the type of
controller installed in the machine tool. However, almost all controllers can interpret a standard language named
G‐code defined by the “ISO 6983‐1: 2009 Automation systems and integration. Numerical control of machines.
Program format and definitions of address words” (ISO 2009). In general, the languages of the controllers follow
the G‐code with some functions defined specifically for them, especially those related to canned cycles. In some
cases, the language may be different from the G‐code to make it easier to understand and use in conversational
mode. For instance, Heidenhain controllers use a native language where a linear movement is defined by the
command L or a circular interpolation is defined by circle center (CC) and DR (direction of rotation). In other
cases, programs can also be written in high‐level languages with a terminology similar to the one used by other
languages, such as $IF, $GOTO, etc. Although the programming languages may differ between CNC controllers,
almost all of them can execute standard G‐codes.

The following section refers to basic G‐codes that are commonly interpretable by all controllers and can be applied
to elaborate simple programs. However, it should be noted that more complex parts are typically programmed
using canned cycles that require specific codes and parameters depending on the controller or CAM programs,
where postprocessing using the correct controller language should be selected.
12.4.1 Program Structure
The CNC program is defined by a sequence of blocks. Each block may contain the following characters:
 
N. Block number.
G. Preparatory function.
X, Y, and Z. Axis values.
F. Feed speed.
S. Spindle speed.
T. Tool number.
D. Tool offset number.
M. Auxiliary function.
The block number is defined by the letter N with a number. Usually, the blocks are numbered in steps of 10 (N10,
N20, N30, …). A general CNC block may have the following structure:
N… G… X±… Y±‐… Z±‐… F… S… T… D… M…
The data has no set order; it may be programmed anywhere in the block except the block number, N, which must
always be programmed at the beginning. At any moment, comments can be added to facilitate program
interpretation. Although the way of adding comments may depend on the controller, usually the text within
parentheses at the end of a block or the text after the symbols “#” or “;” are accepted by CNC controllers as
comments.
It should be noted that, for some functions, the data do not have to be repeatedly written every sentence. These
functions are named modal functions, and they are kept active until it is called another function that is
incompatible with them or until a stop instruction or reset is reached. In general, when it is called a G or M
function this is activated until another G or M function that modifies the previous one is called. In other words, it is
not necessary to rewrite at every CNC block the same G or M function. Once that function has been called, it is
active in all the following blocks. The same occurs with the words F, S, and T, which are, by definition, modal
functions.
12.4.2 List of Preparatory Functions
Preparatory functions are the G‐codes that identify the type of activities the machine will execute. A program block
may contain one or more G‐codes. Preparatory functions are programmed using the letter G with two digits. These
functions are usually placed following the block number and are used to determine the geometry of the part and
working conditions such as units, planes of work, etc. If, in the same CNC block, two incompatible G functions are
called, the CNC keeps the last one. Some general preparatory functions are defined in Table 12.1.
Note that the previous list is common to any type of controller (FAGOR, FANUC, SIEMENS etc.), but G‐codes
about cycles or subroutines may differ among controllers.
12.4.3 Programming Modes
12.4.3.1 Measurement Units. G20/G21 or G70/G71
The coordinates can be indicated in mm or inches. The use of G20/G70 indicates that coordinates are in inches
whereas G21/G71 means in millimeters.
12.4.3.2 Absolute and Incremental Programming: G90/G91

Coordinates can be programmed in absolute values (G90) or by incremental steps (G91). Using G90, the
coordinates of the point programmed refers to the zero workpiece or, alternatively, to the zero fixture. Using G91,
the coordinates of a point programmed refer to the previous programmed point.

The format of Cartesian coordinates for turning and milling operations is as follows:
 
Lathe: X±… Z±…
Milling: X±… Y±… Z±…
Note that polar coordinates can also be used in CNC programs, but they are omitted here for simplicity.
12.4.4 Changes in Reference Systems
A CNC program could be written using the MCS. However, this is not practical since the MCS has an origin that is
nowhere near the workpiece. As previously indicated, a workpiece coordinate system (WCS) is defined to facilitate
the programming task. Thus, the CNC programs should refer to this change of reference system to make the
movements be referred to the WCS and not to the MCS.
This change in the reference system is mainly done by defining the desired WCS and calling it by the
corresponding G‐code, from G54 to G59, which are codes to call up to six different WCSs. The WCSs are defined
with respect to the MCS, and their coordinates are stored in the work offset register, a table defined in the CNC
controller, and each register is associated with a G‐code (G54, G55, etc., …). To illustrate the process, Figure 12.8
shows the work offset register previously defined by the operator to define the WCS and a CNC program where
the first WCS is loaded when calling G54.
In some controllers, it is also possible to define a fixture offset register that defines the FCS with respect to the
MCS. This is useful since – for large production volumes – the FCS is a permanent position that is not changed,
and the dimensions of the resulting parts are with respect to the fixture. However, when dealing with prototypes or
single production parts, the WCS can be directly set by touching with a probe several surfaces from the raw part.
12.4.5 Programming of Movements
12.4.5.1 Rapid Movement: G00
Rapid movements are used for initial movements or cutting tool replacement movements where there is no cutting
engagement. This is done in a high‐speed movement.
When the CNC is turned on, after M02/M30, or after an emergency or reset command, the CNC assumes the G00
code. G00 is modal and incompatible with G01, G02, and G03. After using G00, the last feed speed programmed
is not erased, so when programming G01, G02, or G03, if the feed speed is not provided, the previous value is
used again.

Figure 12.8 Example of changing a reference system in a CNC program and work offset register. Codes G54‐G59.
12.4.5.2 Linear Interpolation: G01
G01 moves the cutting tool in a linear trajectory with the feed speed indicated by the code F. G01 is modal and
incompatible with G00, G02, and G03.
Example: Generate the CNC program in Cartesian and absolute coordinates that define the turning trajectory of
Figure 12.9. Consider the program in diameter for X coordinates.
Solution:
N40    G90 G00 X18 Z0 (rapid movement from the origin)
N45    G01 G95 X0 F0.2 (face turning, feed speed of 0.2 mm/rev)
N50    G00 Z2 (withdrawal in rapid movement)
N55    X15 (tool positioned for turning)
N60    G01 Z‐15 (turning Ø15 × 15)
N65    X38.1 Z‐35 (contour turning)
N70    X47 (face turning)
N75    G00 X200 Z200 (withdrawal to the origin)

Note that the text added within the parentheses can be kept in the program as comments.
12.4.5.3 Circular Interpolation: G02/G03
Functions G02/G03 allow circular trajectories with the feed speed defined in the F parameter. To program a
circular trajectory, it is necessary to define the rotation direction (clockwise or counterclockwise), the last point of
the circular trajectory, and the position of the center of the trajectory or its radius. For a clockwise trajectory, the
G02 code is applied; for a counterclockwise movement, the code to be applied is G03. Figure 12.10 shows the
rotation direction according to the working plane (G17, G18, or G19).
The format of a CNC block for a circular movement is as follows:
 
Lathe. G02 (G03) X±… Z±… I±… K±… F…
Figure 12.9 Example of linear movements in a lathe. Units in mm.

Figure 12.10 Meaning of codes G02 and G03 according to the use of G17, G18, or G19.
In a milling machine, the format depends on the reference plane from which the circular movement is conducted.
Thus, the format would be as follows:
 
Plane XY.G17 G02/G03 X±‐… Y±… I±… J±… F…
Plane XZ.G18 G02/G03 X±‐… Z±… I±… K±… F…
Plane YZ.G19 G02/G03 Y±‐… Z±… J±… K±… F…
If G17‐G19 is not specified, the default value is G17 (plane XY). The values of I, J, and K define the center of the
circular trajectory, where:
 
I. Distance from the initial point to the center along the X‐axis.
J. Distance from the initial point to the center along the Y‐axis.
K. Distance from the initial point to the center along the Z‐axis.
The values of I, J, and K are programmed with signs, and they should be included even if their value is 0. In a
lathe, though the X‐axis is programmed in diameter, the I value is always defined in radius.
Additionally, the circular movement can be programmed using radius instead of the position of the center of the
movement. Using this format, the circular movement is defined as:
 
Lathe. G02/G03 X±… Z±… R±… F…
Milling machine (XY plane). G02/G03 X±… Y±… R±… F…
As can be noted, instead of using I, J, and K, the value of the radius of the circular movement is used. If the
circular movement is less than 180°, the radius is programmed with a positive sign; if it is higher than 180°, it is
programmed with a negative sign. This format is not allowed to program a complete circle since infinite solutions
exist.

Example. Generate the CNC program in a milling machine to define the trajectory shown in Figure 12.11. The
cutting tool is initially at the point X10 Y30.
Solution:
 
Absolute coordinates:
N20 G90 G02 X40 Y30 I15 J0 (arc P0‐P1) or N20 G90 G02 X40 Y30 R15
N25 G03 X80 Y30 I20 J0 (arc P1‐P2) or N25 G03 X80 Y30 R20
Incremental coordinates:
N30 G91 G02 X30 Y0 I15 J0 (arc P0‐P1) or N30 G91 G02 X30 Y0 R15
N35 G03 X40 Y0 I20 J0 (arc P1‐P2) or N35 G03 X40 Y0 R20
12.4.6 Programming of Cutting and Feed Speeds
12.4.6.1 Feed Speed (F): G94/G95
The feed speed defined by the letter F can be programmed in mm/rev (G95) or in mm/min (G94). Usually, the feed
speed is programmed in mm/rev in a lathe and in mm/min in a machining center.
The feed speed is used for linear and circular interpolations (G01, G02, and G03). In rapid movements (G00), the
feed speed is the one defined in the machine tool for rapid movements.
12.4.6.2 Spindle Speed (S). G96/G97
The spindle speed is defined in rev/min (rpm), and it is denoted by the letter S. Unlike milling operations where the
spindle speed is programmed in rev/min, turning operations can be programmed in m/min (G96) or in rev/min
(G97). With the exception of threading or drilling, the constant cutting speed is recommended, so the G96 is used.

Example. N30 G96 S150 M03 (constant cutting speed value of 150 m/min, spindle rotation clockwise).
12.4.6.3 Formulae
The common procedure in programming cutting conditions is to define the cutting speed and the feed per tooth of
the cutting tool, given the cutting tool material and the workpiece material. Knowing the cutting speed, the spindle
speed can be obtained as follows:
where D is the cutting tool diameter or the workpiece diameter if it is a turning operation.
Example. Calculate the spindle speed of a drilling of 15‐mm diameter if the cutting tool vendor recommends a
cutting speed of 80 m/min.
From cutting data handbooks, the feed rate in mm/rev (fn) or in mm/tooth (fz) is given. However, in the CNC
program, the feed rate is usually given in mm/min, so the following expression is required.
Example. Calculate the feed rate of an end mill with four teeth, knowing that the recommended feed rate in
mm/tooth is 0.023 and the spindle speed is 500 rpm.
12.4.7 Cutting Tool Change
In machine tools with an automatic tool changer, a CNC command can change the cutting tool automatically.
Although it may depend on the type of controller, the tool change is usually done by applying two codes: the
number of the tool to be prepared, the T code, and the execution of the tool change, the M06 code.
The number of the tool is indicated by the code T, and the numbers that follow the code refer to the position of the
tool in the physical turret or carousel tool changer. An example of a machining center with an automatic tool
changer is as follows:
 
1. N10 T01 (the tool changer moves to place the tool 1 ready for the change)
2. N20 M06 (execution of tool change)
Depending on the CNC controller, the T code may indicate the tool number (position on the tool changer) and the
tool offset where the dimensions of the tool after tool calibration are stored. For instance, in FANUC series 0‐TC
controllers for CNC lathes, the T code is represented as TXXYY, where XX are the digits for the tool number and
YY are the digits for tool offset. However, in FAGOR 8060 controllers for CNC lathes, the tool number is
indicated by the code TXX (XX, the position on the tool changer) followed by a code DYY where YY represents
the tool offset. In both cases, when applied to CNC lathes, the M06 is not needed, and the T code directly executes
the tool change. Following is an example from both controllers:
 
1. FANUC Series 0‐TC. N10 T0101 (tool 01 with offset in register 01 is loaded)
2. FAGOR 8060. N10 T01 D01 (tool 01 with offset in register 01 is loaded)
12.4.8 Tool Offsets
As shown previously, to identify a tool, the position of the tool in the turret/carousel tool changer (Figure 12.12a),
and the register number of the tool offset is needed. The operator may manually add the information presented in
this register, or it may be automatically filled by the CNC after executing a tool calibration program where the

tool's dimensions are measured and stored in the corresponding register. In a lathe, the register for the tool offsets
(correctors) typically has the following information:
Figure 12.12 (a) Positions of the cutting tools in a lathe turret; (b) X, Z values used to compensate the position of
the cutting tool; and (c) Shape factor of cutting tools in a lathe.
 
X. Length of the cutting tool along X‐axis (Figure 12.12b).
Z. Length of the cutting tool along Z‐axis (Figure 12.12b).
R. Tool nose radius.
L. Code related to the tool tip orientation (Figure 12.12c).
Other values related to compensate the tool wear of the cutting tool.
In a milling machine, the register has the following information:
 
R: Cutting tool radius.
L: Length of the cutting tool.
Other values related to compensate the tool wear of the cutting tool.
12.4.9 Radius Compensations (G40, G41, and G42)
12.4.9.1 Compensation in Turning
When programming nonparallel lines to the lathe axis, the radius of the tool nose prevents the machined part from
having the same profile as the design part (Figure 12.13). To overcome this problem, the programmer can use the

functions G41/G42 that make the controller compensate for the radius of the tool nose and, therefore, keep the
machined profile as the one programmed.
To use the G‐codes G41 and G42, it is mandatory to have previously defined the cutting tool geometry, such as the
shape of the cutting tool and the value of the tool nose radius, in the corresponding register of tool offsets. G41
corresponds to a left compensation, whereas G42 refers to a right compensation, as shown in Figure 12.14. To
deactivate the compensation, the G‐code G40 should be used.
12.4.9.2 Compensation in Milling
When programming cutting tool movements in milling, the coordinates programmed refer to the center of the
cutting tool. When milling the contour of a part, the CNC coordinates of the center of the cutting tool do not
correspond to the part coordinates since there is an offset with the value of the cutting tool radius. In milling, the
cutting tool radius compensation is conducted using the codes G41 or G42 according to the position of the cutter
with respect to the direction of the machining operation. Figure 12.15 shows an example of left and right radius
compensation in milling. The G40 code deactivates the compensation. Similar to lathe operations, to compensate
for the radius, the cutting tool geometry should be defined in the corresponding register of the cutting tool table of
the CNC.
Figure 12.13 Machining error due to tool nose radius in contour turning operations.

Figure 12.14 Compensation functions in a lathe. G41 and G42.
Figure 12.15 Compensation of cutting tool radius on (a) G41 or (b) G42.
Figure 12.16 shows an end milling operation with radius compensation. At the last movement, before deactivating
the compensation, the cutting tool is perpendicular to the last point defined in the trajectory. When deactivating the
radius compensation (G40), the cutting tool moves horizontally, and part of the machined profile may be spoiled.
To avoid this kind of problem, the activation and deactivation of the compensations should be done at a safe

distance from the final geometry of the part. An example of a correct deactivation of radius compensation is shown
in Figure 12.17.
Figure 12.16 Special caution should be paid when the radius compensation is removed.
Figure 12.17 Example of cutting tool radius compensation in milling. Note that the same program can be used for
different tool diameters thanks to radius compensation G‐codes.
12.4.10 Length Compensations (G43, G44, and G49)

In some controllers (e.g., FAGOR 8060), tool length compensation is activated when selecting a tool offset DXX,
where XX is the tool offset number, and there is no specific command for height compensation. To cancel this
compensation, a D0 value is added to the program. An example of length compensation is given in the following:
FAGOR 8060. N10 T05 D04 M06 (tool 5 is loaded with the height compensation indicated in register 4)
…
N50 T04 D0 M06 (the height compensation from register 4 is canceled. The CNC assumes D1 as height
compensation.)
In other controllers (e.g., FANUC 0‐TC), the codes G43 and G44, followed by a Z movement and an HXX code,
which indicates the tool height offset to be loaded from the register, activate the tool length compensation. In these
cases, G43 is a positive compensation (the offset is added), and G44 is a negative compensation (the offset is
subtracted). The code G49 cancels the tool length compensation.
FANUC controller. N80 G43 Z1 H1 (tool length offset number 1 is added, and the tool moves to Z + 1)
….
N200 G49 Z100 (height compensation is canceled)

12.4.11 Auxiliary Functions
The auxiliary functions are related to the operation of the machine tool. Some of these operations are spindle
rotation activation, coolant activation, tool change, etc. Similar to G functions, more than one auxiliary function
can be called in the same program block. Some of the auxiliary functions are:
 
M00. Program stop. When the CNC reads block M00, the program code is paused. It also turns off the
coolant. If the run button is pressed, the program continues to the next block of the program.

M02. End of program. This code indicates the end of the program and performs a function of “general reset”
of the CNC (initial conditions).
M03. Start the spindle clockwise (clockwise, Figure 12.18).
M04. Start the spindle counterclockwise (counterclockwise, Figure 12.18).
M05. Spindle stop.
M06. Tool change.
M08. Coolant on.
M09. Coolant off.
M30. End of the program and back to the beginning of the program. Identical to M02 except that the CNC
returns to the starting block program.
12.5 CNC Canned Cycles
CNC programs can be created by using the ISO codes shown earlier. However, even a simple part may require a
large number of CNC blocks when using simple G‐codes such as G00, G01, G02, and G03. For instance, a part
with a rectangular pocket may require several tens of lines of code. To simplify this tedious job, all CNC
controllers have predefined CNC programs that can be easily configured to create common machining operations
such as rough straight turning, pocket milling, drilling, etc. These predefined programs are named CNC canned
cycles and are usually defined in the G‐codes G7X‐G8X or higher, and their definition depends on each CNC
controller.
To illustrate the use of CNC canned cycles, following are two cycles from the controller CNC FAGOR 8065 T/M
for turning and milling extracted from FAGOR programming manuals (Fagor Automation 2024b; Fagor
Automation 2024c).

Figure 12.19 Turning canned cycle with straight sections.
Source: Fagor Automation (2024b)/Fagor Automation.
12.5.1 G81 Turning Canned Cycle with Straight Sections
This canned cycle turns the programmed section, maintaining the indicated pass between the successive turning
passes. The canned cycle is called in the CNC program in Cartesian coordinates as follows:
where the parameters required are (Figure 12.19) listed as follows:
 
X. This defines the X coordinate of the initial point of the profile. It must be programmed in absolute values
and in the active units (radius or diameter).
Z. This defines the Z coordinate of the initial point of the profile. It must be programmed in absolute values.
Q. This defines the X coordinate of the final point of the profile. It must be programmed in absolute values
and the active units (radius or diameter).
R. This defines the Z coordinate of the final point of the profile.
C. This defines the turning pass, which is given by a positive radius value. The whole turning operation is
carried out with the same pass, which is the same or smaller than the programmed one “C.”
D. This defines the safety distance to withdraw the tool after each pass.
L. This defines the finishing stock along X, and it is given in radius. If not programmed, a value of 0 is
assumed.

M. This defines the finishing stock along Z. If not programmed, a value of 0 is assumed.
F. This defines the feed rate for the final roughing pass. If it is not programmed or programmed with a value
of 0, there is no final roughing pass.
H. This defines the feed rate for the finishing pass. If not programmed or programmed with a value of 0, it is
considered that no finishing pass is desired.
Table 12.2 shows an example of this canned cycle, with the final part and the corresponding CNC program.
12.5.2 G87. Rectangular Pocket Canned Cycle
This canned cycle mills the programmed section, maintaining the indicated pass between the successive milling
passes. The canned cycle is called in the CNC program in Cartesian coordinates as follows:

12.6 Machining Methods/Cutting Strategies
The following considerations should be taken into account when defining cutting tool trajectories in general
machining operations.
12.6.1 Milling
 
1. Cutter engagement. If multiple passes are necessary, the radial depth of cut should be approximately 3/4 the
cutter diameter rather than the full diameter at each pass, as this helps to ensure good chip formation and an
appropriate cutting‐edge load (Figure 12.21a). Additionally, steer clear of centering cutter placement, which
could cause vibrations (Figure 12.21b).

Figure 12.21 (a) Radial passes should be approximately ¾ the cutter diameter in milling operations.
(b) Avoid positioning cutters centered on the workpiece.
Source: Sandvik Coromant (2017).
2. Tool path entries/exits. Avoid entries and exits through tool path programming (Figure 12.22). Keeping the
cutter constantly engaged is a better strategy to avoid frequently entering and leaving the workpiece, which
might result in chatter tendencies or adverse pressures on the cutting edge.
3. Climb versus conventional milling. In climb milling (Figure 12.23a), also known as down milling, the
workpiece is fed in the same direction as the cutter's rotation within the cutting area. This causes the chip
thickness to gradually decrease from the beginning of the cut until it reaches zero at the end of the cut.
Conversely, in conventional milling (Figure 12.23b), also referred to as up milling, the workpiece is fed in the
opposite direction to the cutter's rotation within the cutting area. In this case, the chip thickness begins at zero
and increases as the cut progresses. This necessitates the insertion of the cutter into the material, leading to
friction, elevated temperatures, and often contact with a work‐hardened surface left behind by the previous
insert. Additionally, these forces can cause the workpiece to lift from the machine tool table. In contrast, in
climb milling, the insert initiates the cut with a substantial chip thickness, which prevents the burnishing
effect, reduces heat generation, and minimizes work‐hardening tendencies. The significant chip thickness is
advantageous, as it causes the cutting forces to pull the workpiece into the cutter, maintaining the insert's
position within the cut.
Therefore, climb milling is the preferred method whenever the machine tool, fixturing, and
workpiece permit it.
4. Cutting entry from outside. Whenever possible, the cutting operation should enter the workpiece from one
side and not with a vertical entry. In cases where this is not possible, such as pocketing operations, the cutter
should enter the workpiece following a ramp or a helicoidal trajectory, and the feed rate should be reduced to
1/3 of the normal feed rate. If the cutter presents a central edge, the entry can be conducted vertically but
applying the same feed rate reduction.
5. Minimum one‐tooth engagement. The cutter must have sufficient teeth density to keep at least one cutting
tooth engaged during machining. Failure to do this could cause severe pounding, which can lead to chipped

cutting edges, a damaged cutter, and excess wear on the machine. Thus, the radial depth of cut and cutter
pitch should be chosen always to maintain more than one insert in the cut.
6. Roughing/semi‐finishing/finishing. Large cavity surfaces (e.g., mold cavities) are sequentially machined
through three operation types: roughing, semi‐roughing/semi‐finishing, and finishing (Figure 12.24).
Roughing operations seek to maximize material removal rate and reduce machining time. Semi‐finishing
operations seek to keep a constant machining stock allowance for finishing operations to ensure that finishing
operations can be conducted without important depth of cut changes increasing geometrical part quality.

Figure 12.24 Profile milling for mold cavities. Example of roughing and semi‐finishing operations.
Using flat‐end mills generates more pronounced staircase stocks.
7. Round insert cutters. In roughing and semi‐finishing operations for profile milling, long edge cutters or
shoulder face/end mills will leave a staircase stock that needs to be removed. As a result, cutting forces and
tool deflections vary. The result is an uneven stock for finishing, which will affect the final shape's geometric
precision. Utilizing round insert cutters or ball‐end mills is a preferable strategy because they produce smooth

transitions between passes, leave less stock for the profiling operation, and produce components of higher
quality.
12.6.2 Turning
When vertical cuts are required, the cut should be from outer diameter toward inner diameter to avoid damage of
the insert edge and problems with wrap chips. If face turning is required in a workpiece, this is conducted at the
end after the straight turning cuts are done (Figure 12.25).
12.6.3 Drilling
When drilling nonflat surfaces (Figure 12.26), the following rules should be considered:
 
Convex surfaces. They are possible to drill if the radius is larger than four times the drill diameter and the
hole is perpendicular to the radius. The feed should be reduced to half the normal rate when entering.
Concave surfaces. They can be drilled if the radius is larger than 15 times the drill diameter. When entering,
the feed should be reduced to a third of the normal rate.
Inclined surface. If inclination is within the range 5–10°, start by performing a centering operation. If
inclination is larger than 10°, drilling is not possible unless the entry surface is prepared. In any case, the feed
should be reduced to 1/3 of normal feed rate until cutting full diameter.

diameter to avoid damage to the insert edge and problems with wrap chips.

Figure 12.26 Specific strategies should be applied when drilling nonflat surfaces. At least, the feed rate should be
reduced to a third of the normal rate.

When drilling holes larger than three times the diameter, a peck drilling strategy is recommended. Peck drilling
(i.e., drill a short distance, withdraw the tool, and then drill again) reduces chip packing and prevents drilling
problems. The deeper the hole, the more frequently the drill must be retracted to be effective. The depth for each
pecking is usually one or two times the drill diameter. Figure 12.27 shows a peck drilling example with four
retractions.
For steeped holes that are machined by drilling two holes, the first drilling operation should be the larger diameter
and then the smaller one. Under this strategy, the large diameter assures the centering of the drill point and avoids
the chipping of cutting edges. The smaller drill should have a drill point angle equal to or smaller than the large
drill to ensure that the point hits the workpiece first (Figure 12.28).
In deep‐hole applications where coolant cannot be effectively applied, feeds and speeds should be reduced up to
50% to reduce the excessive heat generated. Finally, when drilling through holes, an additional depth is provided.
It is recommended that an additional depth of 1.27 mm (0.05 inches) be provided for general through holes.
12.6.4 Threading
In turning threading, the thread is machined after threading the workpiece several times. By dividing the full
cutting depth of the thread into smaller cuts, the sensitive nose radius of the insert is not overloaded. The number
of passes required depends on the pitch of the thread. Vendors provide tables to calculate the number of passes and
the depth of cut at each pass to set up the threading operation. For illustrative purposes, consider an external thread
M60 × 1.5 to be machined. According to Figure 12.29, the profile depth of the thread for a 1.5‐pitch metric thread
is 0.94 mm, which is machined by 6 passes. The first cutting passes threads 0.22 mm, the second one 0.21 mm,
etc., and the sixth one 0.08 mm to reach the total depth of cut of 0.94 mm.

A general strategy for threading with machine taps is shown in Figure 12.30 and is as follows:
 
Enter feed rate according to thread pitch (or 1–2% lower) and set spindle to starting point with 0.08‐mm
clearance.
Start spindle forward with right‐hand rotation until reaching desired depth.
Stop feed and rotation and reverse to the starting point.

Process Planning in Inspection and Costing

Inspection Process Planning
13.1 Introduction
An inspection plan is required prior to the production process to study the manufacturing process capability and
validate the current manufacturing process plan. In many contracts between customers and manufacturers, the
manufacturer is demanded to provide documentation related to a complete characterization of the first produced
parts to ensure process capabilities and to deliver the first units to the customer after a complete inspection.
Furthermore, at the production level, statistical process control (SPC) is usually implemented based on inspection
plans to find when the process is statistically out of control and rapidly act on the process to avoid
nonconformities. Additionally, inspection plans based on acceptable quality level (AQL) sampling are also
required to accept or reject incoming raw materials lots or manufactured batches after sampling procedures and
according to pre‐established customer–manufacturer agreements.
Although quality engineering departments may conduct inspection planning, process planners may have an active
role in it. For instance, process planners may aid in defining inspection locations, identifying corrective actions for
nonconforming parts, defining process capabilities, and proposing inspection methods.
In this chapter, different inspection plans are presented, distinguishing inspection plans related to the part and
process approval stage when new products are being produced, plans for process control, or plans for decisions
related to accepting or rejecting a batch of goods. In all cases, the inspection plan requires the proper selection of
gauges and inspection instruments, the procedure for each measurement, the acceptable limits for product
conformity, etc.
13.2 Inspection Plans for Product and Process Validation
In the world of regulated industries, engineers are required to provide evidence that the manufacturing processes
are in control and capable of meeting design requirements. In the automotive, aerospace, or defense industry, a so‐
called production part approval process (PPAP) is a mandatory process to assess the manufacturability of the
supplier to fulfill customer quality requirements. The PPAP is included in the advanced product quality planning
(APQP) process initially developed for the automotive industry to introduce a new product in the market or
incorporate changes in the product after its release. Other industries also require similar processes to validate their
manufacturing procedures prior to production.

Figure 13.1 Phases of APQP and some activities at the PPAP phase.
Although the details of APQP and PPAP are out of the scope of this chapter, Figure 13.1 shows an overview of the
phases in the APQP process and some key activities related to the PPAP phase. Two of these activities are related
to initial inspection reports and initial process studies, critical tasks to ensure product and process validation. As
can be seen, the main idea of these processes is to prove that engineering designs and specifications are ensured
during the manufacturing process prior to production. For this purpose, inspection plans are deployed at the first
runs of the manufacturing process prior to production when the product and process validation phase is carried out.
Product validation is conducted through a complete inspection during the first produced units, reporting documents
such as first article inspection (FAI) reports that should prove product specifications. Process validation is
conducted through process capability studies to demonstrate and document that the manufacturing process
consistently produces products of the desired quality.
13.2.1 Product Validation. First Article Inspection (FAI)
The FAI is a comprehensive verification process of a product before mass production. By an FAI, manufacturers
can assure, prior to volume production, that product specifications are being met, and reengineering will not be
necessary at an inconvenient point of time in the future. Therefore, FAI is particularly important for new product
developments or changes in the production process, where the parts are being made under this manufacturing
process for the first time.
A basic FAI typically includes an annotated drawing that identifies all the part's characteristics, along with a listing
of the characteristic requirements and actual results. Therefore, the creation of the FAI involves identifying the
characteristics (often called ballooning) and documenting the requirements. Figures 13.2 and 13.3 show an
example of an FAI report.
For industries such as aerospace, the AS9102 standard establishes the baseline requirements for performing and
documenting the FAI (SAE 2000). This standard is based on the following three distinct forms (Luke 2021):
 
AS9102 Form 1. Part Number Accountability: Form 1 specifies the part for the FAI, including any associated
subassemblies or detailed parts.

Figure 13.2 First article inspection (FAI). Example. Balloons. Units in mm.

Figure 13.3 Example of first article inspection (FAI) report. Units in mm.
AS9102 Form 2. Product Accountability: Form 2 is dedicated to documenting all material and process
specifications, as well as any special processes and functional testing defined as design requirements.
AS9102 Form 3. Characteristic Accountability: Form 3 focuses on capturing all product characteristics, such
as dimensions, tolerances, and notes. An inspection drawing or model is required, with all inspection
characteristics (defined using CAD annotations) clearly marked with unique inspection balloon numbers.
To perform an FAI in accordance with AS9102, the following steps are followed (Luke 2021):
Step 1. Preplan the FAI. Gather the necessary documentation for the FAI, including engineering drawings, digital
product definition datasets, bill of materials/raw materials list, specifications, etc.
Step 2. Create an inspection plan. Balloon the part drawing to identify the requirements to be inspected with
balloon numbers. Complete AS9102 Form 1 (Part Number Accountability) and Form 2 (Product Accountability)
using information from the bill of materials and the specifications list. Complete AS9102 Form 3 (Characteristic
Accountability) with dimensions, tolerances, notes, and inspection tools.
Step 3. Manufacture the part. Fabricate the part while comprehensive documentation of processing and inspection
results to meet the specified requirements.
Step 4. Collect data. Inspect the part in accordance with the inspection plan established in Step 2. Data are
collected from a random selection of products from the first production batch. A sample size of 1–10 is typically

applied.
Step 5. Finalize reporting. Record measurement result data in AS9102 Form 3.
It is worth noting that during the FAI, any out‐of‐specification conditions encountered must be assessed for their
significance, followed by implementing corrective actions. Typically, this involves making dimensional changes to
the part print or modifying the tooling. Once the FAI is approved by the customer, the process validation phase
starts.
An FAI may be required under the following scenarios:
 
When the part is manufactured for the first time.
When a design or manufacturing process change takes place.
After a customer request.
When the factory changes the location.
When restarting a production line that has not been used for a long period of time.
13.2.2 Process Validation. Process Capability Studies
Process validation shows that the process is reliable, capable of producing parts with the desired dimensions, and
stable. Process validation is typically carried out by performing three successive runs of the manufacturing
process. Throughout each run, samples should be taken at regular intervals, sequentially labeled, and submitted to
metrology for measurement and compliance. If all measurements are within the conformity zone, previously
defined by the upper specification limit (USL) and the lower specification limit (LSL), the process is said to be
capable. Before analyzing process capability, the process should be checked to be stable. A process is stable or in
control when the process behaves consistently over time, that is, the process variation is random and is not
influenced by special circumstances.
Both process capability and process stability can be demonstrated using statistical tools such as control charts
(Khlebnikova 2012). Control charts are used to detect process variation, and they can show if the process is
capable and if it is in statistical control (stable). Figure 13.4 shows four different types of processes according to
their stability and capability. Each graph represents the normal distribution of a specific dimension and its
evolution over time within the manufacturing process.
To check process stability, different samples are inspected. All samples should be within the control limits of a
control chart, which means that process variation is random and there is no special cause of variation. To check the
stability of the process, all measured data should follow a normal distribution. A graphical way to prove it is to
build a control chart with the upper control limit (UCL) and the lower control limit (LCL) to cover 99.73% of the
normal distribution (i.e., ±3σ, where σ is the standard deviation of the data). If all the samples are within the
control limits, the process can be assumed to be stable, as shown in Figure 13.5. Otherwise, the process is unstable
or out of control and a search of the special variation sources should be conducted. It should be noted that for a
better analysis of process stability, data trends, and other issues may be checked in the measured data. Specific
details about process stability analysis can be found in Oakland and Oakland (2007), Qiu (2013) and Stamatis
(2002).

Figure 13.4 Example of four types of processes according to their stability and capability characteristics.

Figure 13.5 Example of process stability analysis under a control chart.
To quantify process capability, several indices are defined. Essentially, these indices measure the degree of
variation within the process in comparison to the specified requirements. Typically, short‐term indices such as Cp
and Cpk or long‐term indices such as Pp and Ppk are employed to assess process performance. Cpk aims to answer
whether the current production sample complies with the specifications, while Ppk addresses the question of
whether the process can consistently meet specifications over the long term. Mathematically, these indices are
obtained as follows (Arcidiacono and Nuzzi 2017):
where μ is the mean value of the samples, and σST and σLT are the short‐term and long‐term standard deviations of
the process. As can be seen, the main difference between Cp and Cpk with respect to Pp and Ppk is the type of
standard deviation used in the equation. In the equation for Pp and Ppk, it is used the standard deviation based on
studied data (whole population). However, the equation for calculating Cp and Cpk uses the standard deviation
within sampling subgroups. It is known that when the process has a normal distribution and is under statistical
control, Pp is essentially close to Cp and Ppk to Cpk because the short‐term and long‐term standard deviations are

more or less similar. It is important to emphasize that evaluating process capability can only be carried out once
the process is under statistical control.
As per the definition, a Cpk value of 1.0 signifies that approximately 99.73% of the produced parts fall within the
specified limits. Practically, only about 3 out of every 1,000 parts deviate from the specified requirements. A Cpk of
1.33 corresponds to 99.994% of the products meeting the specifications. At the same time, a Cpk of 2.0, known as a
6σ process, indicates that 99.99966% of the products conform to the specifications, resulting in just 3.4 defective
parts out of 1 million. It should be remarked that many companies nowadays require their suppliers to achieve Cpk
indices of 1.33 or even 2.0 for production approval, otherwise they may ask for 100% inspection.
13.3 Inspection Plans in Production
Inspection plans are commonly deployed at three stages in manufacturing companies:
 
Incoming parts. Raw materials and outsourced components are inspected to confirm that they are conformed
to specifications.
During production. Inspection is conducted while production is underway.
Preshipment inspection. Manufactured goods may be inspected to detect defects before shipping.
At these stages, different strategies to inspect and control the process can be conducted, such as SPC and
acceptance sampling. The SPC can be defined as the application of statistical techniques to monitor and control a
manufacturing process. Unlike SPC, the purpose of acceptance sampling is to determine the decision related to a
lot of goods in terms of accept, reject, or screen. Therefore, the focus is the decision of accepting or rejecting a
manufactured or purchased lot and letting it be shipped or to returning the lot to the supplier.
13.3.1 Statistical Process Control
To monitor and control the manufacturing process, SPC techniques are commonly used. The manufacturing
process is monitored by sampling the resulting part and representing the result of the inspection in a chart named
the control chart (Figure 13.5). This chart presents UCL and LCL that, if the resulting inspection is outside these
limits, means that the process is statistically out of control and a significant cause of variation exists. Under SPC,
the inspection plan indicates the characteristics to be inspected, the number of subsamples to average each
inspection point in the chart, the frequency of inspection, and the limits and patterns that, if reached, may indicate
the existence of significant causes of variations. Depending on the process capability (Cpk and Ppk values) and how
critical are the inspected features, the features to be inspected will present different subsample sizes and inspection
frequencies. The details of how to build a control chart are more related to quality engineering, and it is out of the
scope of this chapter. Interesting books about SPC and how to define the sampling frequency, number of samples,
etc., can be found in Oakland and Oakland (2007), Qiu (2013) and Stamatis (2002).
13.3.2 Inspection Sampling for Reception/Shipment. Acceptance Sampling
Three main inspection strategies can be found to accept or reject a lot of goods: 100% inspection, acceptance
sampling, and no inspection. The inspection of 100% of the production that is produced in massive quantities at
low cost can be too costly and unrealistic (products such as bolts, nuts, etc.). However, 100% may be the correct
strategy for expensive products such as life‐supporting products. In general, costs are the major factor to consider
while deciding the inspection strategy. A measure used is the break‐even point (BEP). The BEP, also known as
break‐even quality, is the percentage of defects at which the benefits gained from fewer defects being released are
on the same level as the costs associated with performing a number of 100% inspections. The break‐even point is
calculated as (Taylor 1993):
The unit cost of executing the 100% inspection is denoted by k1, and the loss suffered by the customer and others
as a result of the release of a single defective item is denoted by k2. It is better to release lots that have no faults
(zero defects), as 100% examining such lots is a waste of time and resources. The expense of a 100% inspection,

however, is minimal compared to the effects of the defects it eliminates. Thus, lots with high levels of defects
should undergo it.
Example.
A new supplier delivers subassemblies of electronic panels to a car assembly company in quantities of 1,000
pieces. At receiving, testing an electronic panel subassembly costs $0.10, and the correct assembly operation
results in a $1.5 added value. The cost of stopping the assembly line to replace a damaged electronic panel that has
been assembled on a car is $100. Only 0.05–0.1% of the electronic panel subassemblies are anticipated to be
faulty. Determine the process's break‐even point.
Solution:
To graphically represent the value if the lot is inspected 100% and the value of the lot if no inspection is
conducted, two points per each inspection strategy are calculated considering a different percentage of defects,
which is denoted as d.
Value if inspected 100%:
 
If d = 0%: value = 1,000 × 1.5 – 1000 × 0.1 = $1,400
If d = 2%: value = (1,000 × 0.98) × 1.5 − 1,000 × 0.1 = $1,370
Value if no inspection:
 
If d = 0%: value = 1000 × 1.5 = $1,500
If d = 2%: value = (1000 × 0.98) × 1.5 − (1,000 × 0.02) × 100 = −$530

Figure 13.6 Break‐even quality of the example.
Figure 13.6 graphically shows the values according to the different percentages of defects in a lot. According to the
figure, the BEP is in 0.1% of defects. For a percentage of defects higher than this value, a 100% inspection may
provide higher customer value.
Mathematically, the BEP is straightforwardly calculated by the expression shown above, which results in the
following:
Instead of conducting either 100% inspection or no inspection at all, an alternative approach is the utilization of the
acceptance sampling strategy, which involves inspecting a specific number of parts and making a decision based
on the number of defects detected within the sample. Acceptance sampling is a method of inspection applied to
lots/batches of items produced in large quantities, and it can be used for both attribute‐based (count‐based) and
variable‐based (measurement‐based) inspections. Typically, these lots represent incoming purchased items or
finished products awaiting shipment to warehouses or customers. The primary objective of acceptance sampling is
to determine whether a lot meets preestablished standards or specifications for critical characteristics of the item. If
a lot meets these standards, it is considered passed or accepted; if not, it is rejected. Rejected lots may undergo
100% inspection, or if they were purchased, they may be returned to the supplier for credit or replacement,
particularly when destructive testing is involved.

Buyers or consumers may deem lots containing a small percentage of defective items as “acceptable,” especially
when the cost associated with a few defects is minimal. Typically, this percentage falls within the range of 0.01–
2%, which is referred to as the acceptable quality level (AQL). The choice of the AQL should be determined based
on the criticality of the characteristic being inspected. For example, critical part specifications that impact product
functionality would warrant a lower AQL value compared to minor defects that only affect the appearance of the
part.
If AQLs for a product are seen as the point at which the quality is considered acceptable, the formula previously
mentioned can be employed to establish AQLs, with the value of k2 depending on the severity of the defect. As a
general rule, being d the estimated proportion of defectives in the lot, the inspection strategy to be conducted is
defined as (Krajewski et al. 2010, Supplement G):
 
If d ≈ BEP, use acceptance sampling.
If d > BEP, use 100% inspection.
If d < BEP but d is variable, use acceptance sampling.
If d < BEP but d is stable, do not inspect.
The sample plan is a crucial component of acceptance sampling. Given the lot size, N, the sampling plan defines
the sample size, n, and the acceptance/rejection criteria based on the number of defects in the samples. To
understand the procedure for building sampling plans, the following terms should be defined: the operating
characteristic (OC) curve, the AQL, the lot tolerance percent defective (LTPD), the consumer risk, and the
producer risk.
13.3.2.1 Operating Characteristic Curve
The OC curve, which is depicted in Figure 13.7, displays the probabilities of accepting lots based on their
proportion of defectives. In this case, a lot containing 0.5% defectives would have an acceptance chance of 0.86.
Because some low‐quality lots will inevitably be accepted and some high‐quality lots will inevitably be rejected, a
sampling plan cannot completely distinguish between good and bad lots. Only 100% examination of each lot
would lead to perfect discrimination, so the lot will only be accepted if the proportion of defects is below the value
unambiguously agreed upon by the customer and supplier. The OC curve's shape influences sampling plan's
capacity to discriminate; the steeper the curve, the more discriminating the sampling plan is (see Figure 13.8). As a
general rule, the curve is steeper, and the discrimination performance is better when larger sample sizes are
applied.
13.3.2.2 Acceptable Quality Level
When the cost of flaws is minimal, buyers (or customers) are typically ready to accept lots that contain tiny
percentages of defectives as “good.” The AQL is a percentage that is typically set between 0.01% and 2%. Based
on how crucial the feature under inspection is, the AQL should be set. The features to be inspected are divided into
three categories depending on their criticality, that is critical faults, major defects, and minor defects. The type of
feature determines the AQL values, resulting in higher AQL values when less critical characteristics are inspected.
For instance, an airhead with Bluetooth connectivity may have 0.01% critical flaws (e.g., Bluetooth
communication problems), 0.05% major defects (e.g., defects on wire welds), and 2% minor defects (e.g., surface
scratches).

Figure 13.7 A typical OC curve for a specific sampling plan.

Figure 13.8 The steeper the OC curve, the more discriminating the sampling plan.
13.3.2.3 Lot Tolerance Percent Defective
Certain lots that include more defects than the AQL will be accepted due to the inherent uncertainty of sampling.
The consumer's tolerance for the proportion of defective items in acceptable lots is named the LTPD. Similar to
AQL, LTPD should be determined by the degree of criticality of the characteristic under inspection; the greater the
degree of criticality, the lower the LTPD.
13.3.2.4 Consumer's and Producer's Risk
As previously mentioned, sampling plans do not accurately distinguish between excellent and bad lots. The
consumer's risk, also known as beta (β) error or Type II error, is the likelihood that a bad lot with flaws equal to the
LTPD will be accepted. The producer's risk sometimes referred to as the alpha (α) error or Type I error, is the
likelihood that a good lot with defects equivalent to the AQL will be rejected. An example of the OC curve with
the AQL, LTPD, producer's risk, and consumer's risk is shown in Figure 13.9. Keep in mind that the likelihood of
accepting a lot with AQL quality is 1 – α, and the likelihood of accepting a lot with LTPD quality is β.
13.3.2.5 Determining the Sampling Plan
Various types of sampling plans can be outlined (Heizer and Render 2005):
 
Single sampling. A single sampling plan is defined by two parameters: the number of items to be sampled (n)
and a predetermined acceptable threshold for the number of defects (c). If the number of defects in the lot is
equal to or lower than the acceptance threshold, the entire batch is accepted. If the number of defects exceeds
this threshold, the entire lot is rejected or subjected to 100% inspection.

Double sampling. In cases where a lot of items may be exceptionally good or bad, it is possible to reach a
quality conclusion by taking a smaller sample compared to what would be used in a single sampling plan. If
the number of defects in this smaller sample (with size n1) is equal to or below a specified lower limit (c1), the
lot can be accepted. Conversely, if the number of defects surpasses an upper limit (c2), the entire lot is
rejected. However, if the number of defects in the n1 sample falls between c1 and c2, a second sample (with
size n2) is drawn. The combined results of both samples determine whether the lot should be accepted or
rejected.
Figure 13.9 An OC curve with the AQL, LTPD, producer's risk α, and consumer's risk β.
Sequential sampling. Another approach involves inspecting smaller samples sequentially until a definitive
decision can be reached. In sequential sampling, units are randomly selected from a lot and tested one by one,
with the cumulative count of inspected items and defects recorded over time.
For single sampling plans, determining the sample size n and acceptance number c is equivalent to determining the
sampling plan's OC curve. One method to define the single sampling plan is by using the US military standard
MIL‐STD‐105E, currently obsolete and transferred to ANSI/ASQ Z1.4 and ISO 2859 (ANSI 2003, ISO 1999).
Although replaced by ASQ Z1.4, many companies still use the notation 105E in their inspection documents. ASQ
Z1.4 can be used to inspect AQLs around 0.01% or higher and is not intended to inspect products with quality
levels in the parts per million range. ASQ Z1.4 uses the AQL point, the lot size N, the level of inspection desired,
and the type of inspection required (which in turn depends on the history of the inspection results) to determine n
and c.

There are three primary or general inspection levels (I, II, and III) and four special inspection levels (S‐1 to S‐4).
These general inspection levels are defined as follows (ANSI 2003):
 
Level I. Suitable for evaluating features of minor significance. Minor defects are unlikely to render the part
unusable for its intended purpose. This level offers lower customer protection but comes with reduced
inspection costs.
Level II. Appropriate for assessing features of major importance. Major defects may lead to part failure when
used but do not pose a hazardous condition. Level II involves normal inspection costs and offers standard
customer protection. It is the most commonly used default inspection level.
Level III. Employed when inspecting features that could potentially result in critical defects. Critical defects
can lead to hazardous conditions. This inspection level provides the highest level of customer protection but
comes with higher inspection costs.
In contrast to the general inspection levels, special inspection levels (S‐1 to S‐4) are applied when the inspection
may damage the item being examined, prove costly, or consume a significant amount of time. The key distinction
among the four special inspection levels is the sample size they generate. S‐1 yields the smallest sample size, while
S‐4 yields the largest among the special levels. However, all four levels result in smaller sample sizes compared to
primary levels.
Regarding the type of inspection, three categories are recognized:
 
Normal inspection. This is employed to ensure a high likelihood of acceptance when the process quality
exceeds the AQL and there are no indications that the process's quality is unacceptable.
Reduced inspection. Reduced inspection means sampling fewer parts during the inspection. To initiate a
reduced inspection, ten or more consecutive lots must pass inspection, with the total number of defects from
those ten lots falling below a specified threshold in the standard. Additionally, production must be consistent.
Tightened inspection. If two out of five lots are rejected, a tightened inspection is necessary. Tightened
inspection involves sampling more parts during the inspection. To revert to normal inspection, five
consecutive lots with tightened inspection sample sizes must pass inspection.
The values of n (sample size) and c (acceptance number) required to construct the sampling plan's OC curve are
derived from tables provided in ASQ Z1.4 and ISO 2859 (see Appendix 3). Alternatively, online resources, such as
http://www.sqconline.com/mil‐std‐105.html, can be utilized to define the sampling plan according to the lot size,
the AQL, the chosen inspection level, and the type of inspection.
The sampling plan must be presented together with the engineering drawing or as a note on the drawing itself, as
shown in the example given in Figure 13.10. In the last case, a simple coding can be used. For instance, the
symbols 
, 
, and 
 can be used to define critical, major, and minor dimensions, respectively. A chart
explaining the sampling procedure should answer any additional questions.

Figure 13.10 AQL is shown on a drawing in the form of a note. Units in mm.
Given the values of n and c, the sampling plan's OC curve can be obtained. The graph is commonly obtained using
statistical software or the same online tools described above. If the lot size N is very large as compared to the
sample size n, then the distribution of the number of defectives, d, in a random sample of n items approximately
follows a binomial distribution with parameters n and p, where p is the fraction of defectives per lot.
Mathematically, the probability of acceptance of a lot with a number of defectives less or equal to c for a process
with p fraction of defectives per lot is (NIST/SEMATECH 2014, Chapter 6):
Practical Example
Assume the lot size N is 400 and the AQL is 1%. The inspection type is considered normal with an inspection level
II. Find the acceptance number c and the sample size n for a single sampling plan. What is the likelihood of
accepting the lot if there are 5% defects?
Solution 1: using online tools

In http://www.sqconline.com/mil‐std‐105.html it is chosen the right range for N, AQL, inspection level, and type of
inspection. Then, the “Submit” button is clicked (Figure 13.11).
Figure 13.12 gives the results for the single and double sampling procedures. As it is shown, the acceptance
number of defects, c, is equal to 1, and the sample size, n, is equal to 50. Furthermore, according to the OC curve,
the probability of accepting the lot if the number of defects is 5% (p = 0.05) is around 0.3 (30%).
Solution 2: using AQL Tables (Appendix 3)
The same solution is reached using the AQL Tables from Appendix 3. Using the tables in this appendix, the sample
size code is H for a lot size of 400 (range between 281 and 500) and an Inspection Level II. According to the
sample size code H, the sample size is defined as 50 and the decision for an AQL 1% is Accept if defects are 1 or
less, and Reject if defects are 2 or more.
The probability of accepting the lot (i.e., the number of defects in the sample is 1 or 0) if the number of defects is
5% is defined as

13.4 Features to be Inspected
As previously shown, when a new product is launched, the first units produced may require a total inspection
through an FAI to validate the product. Process validation may also be required to validate the process by
estimating the Cpk and Ppk values. When dealing with product inspection, the features to be included in the
inspection plans must be defined. If there exists a prior inspection plan for a similar part, it can serve as a reference
for adapting it into the new plan. If this is not the case, process planners or quality engineers should evaluate the
functioning of the part and carefully analyze which characteristics of its features need inspection to ensure the part
operates as intended. It is important to note that in certain cases, measuring a feature may not be necessary. For
instance:
 
1. When the dimension is under the control of a proven die or mold.
2. When an attribute can be confirmed using methods other than measurement, such as comparing strength to
diameter or water leak tests.
3. When a dimension holds no significance for the functionality of the workpiece and is known to be
inconsequential in the batch or part being tested.
4. When a feature can be accepted or rejected at a lower cost.

Note that depending on the criticality of the feature to be inspected and the corresponding manufacturing process
capability, the sampling size and frequency adopted in the inspection plans may vary notably.
13.5 Selection of Measurement Instruments for Inspection
The main goal of inspection is to inspect the required features with the highest possible level of accuracy while
ensuring that it is not consumed more inspector time and machine resources than the part justifies. To achieve this,
the inspection plan should consider the following:
 
1. The total quantity of parts being produced.
2. The availability of appropriate measurement instruments.
3. The time required for setups using the available metrology equipment.
4. The significance of time required for inspecting a particular part in relation to its importance.
5. The investment cost associated with acquiring and using measurement instruments that are currently
unavailable.
6. Whether personnel training is a factor in implementing this inspection plan.
7. The potential sources of measurement uncertainties.
8. The acceptable probabilities of accepting a defective feature or rejecting a conforming one.
As it can be seen, a detailed study of the cost of the inspection equipment and procedure should be conducted for
an optimal inspection process plan. However, if data about measurement time or equipment cost are not available,
a simple procedure for a cost‐effective inspection plan can be obtained by selecting the measurement instruments
with low precision while still ensuring a good conformity zone. The main reason behind this idea is that a more
precise instrument means, generally, a more expensive one. For these cases, the methodology shown below for
selection of inspection equipment can be followed:
 
Step 1. From the equipment available, select the ones that are adequate for the type of measurement to be
conducted, that is, select the instruments according to the measurement to be done, such as internal length,
external length, depths, weight, etc.
Step 2. From the previous selection, select the instruments that are adequate according to the range of
measurement.
Step 3. From the previous selection, select the instruments with a ratio T/2U between 3 and 10, where T is the
tolerance of the dimension to be measured and U is the uncertainty of the instrument used. The number 3 is
used to avoid rejecting too many good parts due to an excessive uncertainty measurement, and the number 10
is used to avoid the use of too precise instruments (i.e., too expensive instruments), although many times
instead of 10, the use of 20 or more is applied.
Since the measurement instrument is not perfect and has some uncertainty during its use, the decision to consider a
good or bad part according to the measurements is made based on the conformity zone. Figure 13.13 shows the
conformity zone for a part with USL and LSL, depending on the inspection uncertainty U. Mathematically, the
conformity zone is defined as (LSL + U, USL − U).

The uncertainty of an instrument is usually referred to as the expanded uncertainty, which is obtained by
multiplying the combined standard uncertainty by a coverage factor, k (JCGM 2008). A value of coverage factor of
2 (k = 2) means a 95.4% confidence in the reported conformity zone.
Practical Example
A precision hole with specification Ø
 should be inspected in the quality department. Table 13.1 shows the
available measurement instruments. Select the most adequate instrument.
Solution: The most adequate instrument is selected following the previous methodology:
 
Step 1. Discard instruments that do not fit the type of measurement. Instrument #4 is discarded since the
vernier depth gauge is only used for measuring depth.
Step 2. Discard instruments that do not fit the range of the measurement. Instrument #5 is discarded since the
specification to be inspected, Ø
, is not in the range of the instrument, 50 − 100 mm.
Step 3. Discard instruments that do not fit the ratio tolerance/uncertainty. The range considered as adequate is

Therefore, the uncertainty limits for this example are
From the remaining instruments, #1, #2, and #3, only the 3‐point internal micrometer presents an uncertainty that
is within these limits. The CMM has an uncertainty of 0.001 mm, which means that the precision is too high for
this inspection, and thus, it is considered too expensive. The digital vernier, with an uncertainty of 0.02 mm,
presents a too‐low precision for the application. A complete guide for instrument selection and practical examples
can be found in Vila et al. (2023).

Product Cost Estimation
14.1 Introduction
Almost any industrial inquiry related to the manufacturing process, such as floor space, delivery deadlines, lead
time, work in progress, and more relies on process planning as a fundamental source of data. For instance, consider
the introduction of a new product within a company. The finance department seeks to determine its manufacturing
cost, and subsequently, the selling price. To provide a reasonably accurate answer, the bill of materials (product
structure) for the product must be studied, listing all the necessary components and their quantities for a single
product. Based on the components to be made and bought, manufacturing cost estimation is then conducted to
analyze the economic feasibility of a product. It typically requires considering costs related to material, tooling,
equipment operation, labor costs, etc. Given a fair manufacturing cost estimation, finance personnel can translate
all this data into cost figures for a final customer quotation or selling price definition.
Additionally, to determine the selling price of a product, product cost estimation can also be conducted to
determine how much can be invested in equipment, evaluate alternative designs of a product, conduct make‐or‐buy
decisions, etc. It should be noted that product cost estimating is generally carried out by engineers or technical
personnel before the actual production of a product. Cost estimation should be differentiated from cost accounting,
which is usually carried out by accounting personnel with the issue of the order for production of a product, and it
gives the actual cost of the product based on the data related to actual expenditures of a product.
In this chapter, a global view of different costs that can be found in process planning is reviewed. Standard terms
such as direct and indirect costs, prime costs, and profits are defined, and general figures are provided to facilitate
a straightforward cost estimation. Given the definition of all different costs in a manufacturing company, the
chapter reviews the cost terms to estimate the manufacturing cost of three manufacturing processes: sand casting,
machining, and three‐dimensional (3D) printing. For the first two processes, the methodology followed is mainly
based on reference handbooks about costing (Boothroyd et al. 2002). The figures related to specific costs, such as
labor rates, materials' price, etc., have been obtained from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, Occupational
Employment and Wage Statistics (US Bureau of Labor Statistics 2023a), and other websites. In some cases, the
costs have been kept from reference (Boothroyd et al. 2002) but adding a cost increase of 71% with respect to the
given values, which is the average price rise from 2002 to 2023 reported by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (US
Bureau of Labor Statistics 2023b). The chapter also includes some computer‐aided cost estimators and web‐based
tools useful for early cost estimations in process planning.
14.2 Elements of Costs
Different costs throughout the company influence a finished product's selling price. These include the cost of
production, cost of design, research and development, and overheads, the latter usually including the cost of
marketing, sales, customer support, and administration. Figure 14.1 depicts them, illustrating how much each
contributes to the ultimate selling price using common figures in the industry (Scallan 2003). The specific numbers
may vary significantly between different organizations, depending on the product and its market context. For
instance, companies producing highly intricate or cutting‐edge products are more likely to allocate a larger
proportion of their expenses to research, development, and product design.
However, the primary focus here lies in the costs related to manufacturing, which typically constitute the most
substantial portion of the final selling price. These manufacturing costs can be broken down into four primary
components: direct labor, indirect labor, parts and material, and energy, equipment, and depreciation. Figure 14.1
shows these four primary components along with their typical percentage allocations. According to this figure,
approximately 20% of the overall cost can be attributed to parts and materials (Scallan 2003). The remaining costs
are primarily associated with labor and machinery.
These elements of cost can be grouped into different categories to define the final cost of the part. Given the final
cost of the part and adding the corresponding profit, the selling price is derived. The first category that is defined is
the prime cost, which is composed of the direct costs. Direct costs refer to the expenses incurred by the
organization that can be directly linked to the production of a particular item. These direct costs encompass three

key elements: direct labor costs (e.g., welders, machinists, etc.), direct material costs, and any other expenses
directly associated with the production of a product (e.g., hiring special tools and equipment). Therefore, the prime
cost is derived from the direct costs, and it can be defined as follows:
Figure 14.1 Typical contribution of cost elements to the final selling price.
Source: Adapted from Scallan (2003).

Figure 14.2 Definition of the selling price based on different cost terms and common figures in manufacturing
companies.
Source: Adapted from Scallan (2003).
On the contrary, indirect manufacturing costs are those that can only indirectly be attributed to the production of a
specific item. In general, these costs include expenses other than the direct costs related to the manufacturing
process. They may encompass indirect materials, indirect labor (e.g., supervisors, maintenance operators, etc.), and
indirect overhead expenses. All these costs are also referred to as production overheads.
The second category of cost is the production costs, which include both prime costs and indirect manufacturing
costs (i.e., production overheads). Thus, the production cost is defined as follows:
Other overhead expenses, such as those related to marketing, management, administrative expenses, selling and
distribution expenses, and research and development, should also be included to determine the overall cost of
creating a particular product. Therefore, the last category is the total cost, which includes these additional
overheads, and it is defined as follows:
Given the total cost and the profit of the company, the final selling price of the product can be defined. The final
difference between the selling price and the total cost is the profit; hence,
Figure 14.2 shows the different types of cost in a product and its tentative selling price. Common percentages
related to industrial practices are shown to understand the importance of each cost category (Scallan 2003).
14.3 Make‐or‐Buy Decision

When a company deals with the production of a new product, various components listed in the bill of materials
necessitate a decision: should they be manufactured in‐house or outsourced? To facilitate this decision, popularly
known as a “make‐or‐buy decision,” a cost estimate may be required for comparison purposes, although other
factors such as company strategy, vendor quality, and vendor delivery reliability come into play.
A make decision entails securing suitable production equipment, qualified personnel, raw materials, sufficient
workspace, oversight, adherence to design standards, and the management of indirect and hidden costs such as
maintenance, taxes, insurance, and managerial attention. Conversely, a buy decision involves lower initial
investments, a smaller labor force, reduced handling, lower building costs for facilities, diminished overhead
expenses, lower taxes and insurance, less supervision, and fewer challenges related to employee‐management
relationships. However, a make decision brings control of the production and generally lowers the cost per part.
Companies may opt to procure parts, subassemblies, or assemblies for various reasons, and the rationale behind
these decisions varies depending on the organizational level where the decision is made. Two levels may be
distinguished, the tactical level and the operational level. The tactical level is given when the make‐or‐buy decision
is due to a strategic position of the company in the market, control of the manufacturing knowledge behind the
product, control of delivery deadlines to reduce risks in the supply chain, safeguarding intellectual property,
reduction of the labor force, etc. On the contrary, the operational level is given when the make‐or‐buy decision is
based solely on existing equipment, resources, skills, and capacity, and the cost is the main decision driver. Figure
14.3 shows common buy‐and‐make decisions in terms of economic factors and risks. Strengthening relationships
with reliable suppliers as partnerships is also another strategy to mitigate the risks and take advantage of supplier's
lower costs.
At the operational level, the items evaluated for a make‐or‐buy decision can be categorized into one of three
groups:
 
Must‐buy items. These items cannot be feasibly manufactured based on current capabilities.
Must‐make items. These items involve processes and operations critical for ensuring product integrity and
quality. For instance, a product that is prone to frequent design changes may complicate third‐party
manufacturing.
Items that can be either make or buy. These items require thorough analysis to reach a decision, often hinging
on cost considerations.

Figure 14.3 Overview of buy‐and‐make decision according to economic factors and risk.

Figure 14.4 Flow chart for “make‐or‐buy” decision process at operational level.
Source: Adapted from Scallan (2003).
As a general guideline, a flow chart adapted from Scallan (2003) with the steps for a make‐or‐buy decision is
presented in Figure 14.4. Four fundamental questions guide the make‐or‐buy decision. The initial inquiry focuses
on whether the item can be procured externally. If so, the subsequent question is, “Can the item be produced
internally?” Typically, if the answer is negative, the part will be procured unless the decision is being made at the
tactical level. If in‐house production is feasible, the next step is to compare the costs of making versus buying.
Assumptions are often required regarding factors such as expected volume, demand patterns, waste, inventory
levels, and fluctuations in material prices. If making is more cost‐effective, it is analyzed if the required investment
in equipment and resources is affordable, considering the potential alternative uses of capital and the cost of
external funding if necessary.
14.4 Pricing
The pricing activity of a company may be conducted under two different approaches:
 

Top–down approach. The price is defined according to similar products in the market. In other words, the
price is what the customers are ready to pay, and it is not related to the actual manufacturing costs. Therefore,
the price is defined by the market, and the profit is calculated depending on the total manufacturing cost. In
this case, the price may also allocate the maximum costs to make the product economically viable. This
situation may be common in exclusive or traditionally high‐priced markets.
Bottom–up approach. The price is defined based on the total manufacturing cost of the product. After
estimating the total cost of the product, a percentage of profit is added to set the final price of the product.
This profit percentage depends on the type of product, market characteristics, etc., but a good profit margin
for manufacturing companies is usually within the range of 10–20%.
The final price in the market will also depend on the distributors/resellers. If the company relies on
distributors/resellers, they often make a typical 60% markup, which increases notably the final price of the product
to the consumer. The markup value depends on the type of product. Some consumer products go through long,
complex, and expensive sales chains to get to the end user, leading to high markup values.
To illustrate the company's profit and final price of the product, consider a company with a total cost of $50 per
product and a final price of the product of $65. In this case, the gross margin (profit) obtained is as follows:
However, if the same company applies the same gross margin percentage and uses a distributor/reseller to sell its
products with a 60% markup, the final price of the product is:
Despite the large margins applied by distributors/resellers, they make it easier for products to sell since they handle
shipping, orders and returns, and have direct contact with customers.
Pricing is critical when evaluating a new product development. At this point, it is necessary to consider the capital
investment for new equipment or other requirements must be considered in setting the final product price. In these
cases, the analysis of the return on investment (ROI) is needed to estimate the profitability of the new product.
A basic calculation of ROI is given as follows:
which depends on the final price since it establishes the company's profit. ROIs higher than 7–10% are considered
adequate for continuing the product development process. Note that more complex ROI expressions to consider
the multi‐year effect can be applied, but previous expressions can give a fast overview of the profitability of the
investment for a new product release.
14.5 Sand‐Casting Cost Estimation (Ctsc)
Sand‐casting cost estimation can be conducted by analyzing three main cost factors: tooling cost (Ctooling),
processing cost (Cproc), and metal cost (Cmat). These three cost terms can be fairly estimated for a sand‐casting
process given the material, the equipment to be used, pattern characteristics, production rate, labor cost, etc. The
following equation is used for a generic sand‐casting cost estimation (Ctsc):
Each cost term is described in detail in the following sections and some cost tables are provided for a
straightforward cost estimation.
14.5.1 Tooling Cost (Ctooling)

Tooling cost takes into account tooling cost for both molds and cores. Tooling cost related to molds refers to the
cost of mold sand (Cmsd) and the cost of the pattern (Cpm) that is needed to create the molds. Tooling cost related to
cores refers to the cost of core sand (Ccsd) which is usually more expensive than the ones needed for molds, and
the cost of the core boxes (Cbox) to fabricate the cores. Therefore, assuming that cores are needed, the tooling cost
is defined as:
Note that tooling costs related to pattern and core box fabrication are shared by all parts made under this tooling
(Ntooling). Each cost previously shown can be estimated as discussed in the following sections.
14.5.1.1 Mold Sand and Core Sand Cost (Cmsd, Ccsd)
To estimate the cost of the molding sand required for building the mold, the volumes of the mold (cope and drag)
and their cavities (i.e., sprue, runner, risers, and pattern cavity) should be calculated. Since the mold sand cost has
a relatively small impact on the cost of producing a casting (often less than 3% of the total cost), a rough
estimation can be straightforwardly applied where the cost of mold sand is estimated as $0.03/kg of metal poured.
This empirical relationship was presented in a survey of American foundries considering recycling and other
factors and it is usually employed in some reference books (Boothroyd et al. 2002). Thus, the cost of mold sand
per part can be evaluated as follows:
where Wp is the weight of the poured casting. At early stages, the sprue, runners, risers, etc., may be not defined, so
the estimation of Wp can be roughly done by increasing the weight of the final cast part by 20–40%.
To estimate the cost of core sand, the total weight of the sand needed is straightforwardly obtained since the
geometry of the cores is known. Depending on how delicate the core configuration is, and the sort of core‐making
technique being employed, scrap rates for cores can range from 4% to 20% throughout processing. A scrap rate of
8% will give a reliable estimate in most situations. Therefore, the cost of the core sand for producing a casting can
be estimated as:
where ρcs is the density of core sand (approximately 1,387 kg/m3); Vc is the volume of core (m3); Sc is the core
scrap rate (%); and Ccs is the cost of core sand (approximately $0.15/kg). Note that sand for core fabrication is
more expensive than mold sand because stronger cores must be produced using finer sand.
14.5.1.2 Pattern and Core Box Cost (Cpm, Cbox)
The plates with the pattern impressions are often made of iron castings for higher volume production. If the mold's
parting surface is flat, the top and bottom plate surfaces are machined in accordance with that shape, and flask pins
and bushings are then inserted. Cast parts that do not have a level parting line require more intricate mounting
plate castings. These, in turn, necessitate more involved machining, which can substantially raise tooling costs.
The pattern and core box costs depend on the material cost and the machining cost to generate the required
imprints. The material cost is straightforwardly evaluated, knowing the volume of the pattern plate or the core box
and the material cost per kg. Thus, the material cost for the pattern plate is expressed as follows:
where Crpm is the raw material cost per kg, ρpm is the density of the material used for the pattern plate and Vpm is
the volume of the plate. Table 14.1 shows some reference values for typical materials used in pattern plates. A
similar equation is applied when dealing with the cost of the core box:

where the terms refer to the core box characteristics.
Calculating the cost of machining is the next step after determining the material cost of the pattern plate or the core
box. Machining cost depends on the complexity of the surface to be generated and the surface roughness
requirement that applies. For sand‐casting processes, the surface roughness requirements are not critical, and
common machining capabilities are enough without any increase in cost. To evaluate surface complexity, the
number of surface patches is counted. A surface patch refers to a region with a constant or smoothly varying
curvature that can be machined under the same machining operation without lifting the tool. Two surface patches
coming together create an abrupt shift in slope or curvature. The machining cost will be a function of the number
of different patches identified. In Boothroyd et al. (2002), the machining cost for a set of pattern impressions is
estimated as:

where Rt is the toolmaking cost rate ($/hour, typical values are $70–80/hour); Nsp is the number of different surface
patches; Npi is the number of identical impressions; and Ap the projected area of the impressions (cm2).
The previous cost applies when patterns or core boxes are made of cast iron, a material that is commonly applied
to make high‐production tools. For different materials, such as wood or plastic for low‐volume production or
stainless steel for high production volumes, a relative cost factor, Rtf, can be used to adjust the cost. Table 14.1
shows relative machining cost factors for different tooling materials and a typical number of cycles that a tooling
can be used before needing to be replaced.
Given the material cost and the machining cost, the cost for both pattern plates and core boxes are obtained as
follows:
Other references present alternative methods to estimate tooling costs in sand casting. For instance, in Chougule
and Ravi (2006), the tooling cost is obtained based on a regression equation where the casting volume and factors
related to complexity and accuracy are considered.

Machinery Co. Ltd.
14.5.2 Processing Cost (Cproc)
The cost of creating the cores (Ccore), the cost of mold processing (Cmp), and the cost of cleaning the castings (Ccl)
make up the three primary categories of processing cost. Thus, the processing cost is evaluated as:
Each cost previously shown can be estimated as follows.

14.5.2.1 Cost of Producing Cores (Ccore)
The cost of producing a core depends on a wide range of factors. For instance, some cores need to be coated with
refractory material, which requires special tools and labor to coat the cores and bake them to dry the coating. To
facilitate and get a rough estimation of core cost, it is evaluated the weight of cores that are expected to be
produced at the shop floor every hour and divided this value by the total number of workers that work on it. This
gives the production rate for the shop floor that is expressed in core kilograms per worker‐hour. An example of this
rate is given in Boothroyd et al. (2002), where the production rate for cores was determined to be around 53 
kg/worker‐hour from a survey of several big foundries. Therefore, the cost of processing a particular core is given
(Boothroyd et al. 2002) as follows:
where ρcs is the density of core sand (kg/m3); Vc is the volume of core (m3); Pff is the plant efficiency ([actual
production time/total available time] × 100); Rcm is the worker rate for core making ($/hour, typical values are
$20–40/hour); Sc is the core scrap rate; and Pcm is the core production rate (kg/hour). The scrap rate depends on the
type of core‐making method and the core's design, and it usually ranges from 4% for a straightforward core to 20%
for a delicate one, and a scrap rate of 8% is suitable for early costing situations. Plant efficiency depends on the
plant itself, but efficiencies of 60–85% can be reasonable.
14.5.2.2 Cost of Producing Molds (Cmp)
The cost of producing molds is determined by the number of castings produced per hour, the number of workers
needed to support the line, and the labor rate per worker. The cost per casting related to mold production is
determined by (Boothroyd et al. 2002) the following equation:
where Nmw is the number of line workers; Rmp is the labor rate for molding line production ($/h, reasonable values
are $130–200/hour); Nc is the number of mold cavities (castings per mold); Pmp is the molding line production rate
(molds/hour); Sm is the casting scrap rate (%); and Pff is the plant efficiency (%). The scrap rate may depend on the
geometry of the item and the type of metal being poured. As presented in Boothroyd et al. (2002), a figure of 2%
may be appropriate for early cost estimation.
14.5.2.3 Cost of Cleaning Castings (Ccl)
The castings' removal from the mold is the last process on the mold line. Typically, a ram is used to drive the sand
mold out of the flask and shatter the mold. The castings are brought to the cleaning section while the mold sand is
recycled.

The size and geometry of the part play a major role in how much it will cost to clean a casting. From the literature,
the overall labor time required to clean castings – including the removal of sand, the removal of runner systems
and flash, and shot blasting – has been proven to be roughly equal to the square root of the casting weight
(Boothroyd et al. 2002). Thus, the following empirical expression is used for estimating the cleaning time per
casting:
and the cleaning cost is then given by
where Tcl is the total cleaning time (hour) and Rcl is the worker labor rate ($/hour). Labor rates of $20–30/hour are
reasonable values for small automated foundries in cleaning operations.
14.5.3 Metal Cost (Cmat)
The metal cost must consider the following terms: raw material (Crm), energy cost related to melting (Cen),
amortization cost of furnace equipment (Cfk), and the labor cost for activities related to furnace and pouring (Clk).
The total of these expenses is frequently referred to as “at the spout” metal cost and can be expressed in $/kg as
(Boothroyd et al. 2002) follows:
To consider the metal loss in melting and pouring, the total weight to be cast is increased by a generic factor of
loss. Additionally, the wasted metal in the feed system and risers is reutilized, and thus, the material cost is
adjusted considering its scrap value. Therefore, the final metal cost is estimated as follows:
where Wp is the weight of poured metal (kg); Wfc is the weight of the finished casting without feeder and risers
(kg); Ccv is the metal scrap value ($/kg); and floss is the metal loss factor in melting and pouring that typical ranges
from 1.02 to 1.14. The weight of metal poured at early stages may be hard to estimate since the sprue, runners,
risers, etc., may be not defined. If this information is not provided, a rough estimation for raw material weight can
be done by increasing the weight of the final cast part by 20–40%.
The different cost terms associated with the metal cost is discussed in the following.
14.5.3.1 Cost of Raw Material (Crm)
The cost of raw material in $/kg is straightforwardly obtained from databases and vendors' quotations. Table 14.3
shows common raw material costs and their scrap values for casting.
14.5.3.2 Cost of Melting Energy (Cen)
The raw material should be heated to reach the required pouring temperature. The furnace energy cost is estimated
(Boothroyd et al. 2002) as follows:
where Ect is the cost of energy [$/(kWh)]; Mme is the minimum melt energy of the material (kWh/kg); Fff is the
furnace efficiency. Values of 0.16 $/kWh for Ect and 45–75% for Fff can be used for typical foundry operations
with electric arc furnaces. Mme values for a range of typical casting metals are given in Table 14.3.

14.5.3.3 Cost of Equipment (Cfk)
A fixed furnace cost is typically added to consider the cost of the equipment, that is, the amortization cost. This
cost is related to the shop‐floor equipment and can be estimated as follows:
where Pfc is the price of the furnace equipment ($), Ay is the expected amount of kg heated per year (kg/year), and
nlife is the effective life of the equipment (years). Alternative, common depreciation rates in casting machinery are
5–10%, and the cost of equipment can be rewritten as follows:
where dr is the depreciation rate. For instance, an electric arc furnace with a 500‐kg capacity may cost around
$230,000. Assuming a depreciation cost of 10%, 100 days of work per year, and 2 castings per day, the resulting
cost is $0.23/kg.
14.5.3.4 Cost of Labor (Clk)
The labor expense for running the furnace, expressed as a labor cost per kilogram of metal poured (Clk), must also
be included in the metal cost. A foundry can estimate this on a shift‐by‐shift basis by dividing the cost of furnace
workers for one shift by the weight of metal poured during that shift. For a medium‐sized automated foundry, the
furnace labor cost is typically calculated at $0.034/kg (Boothroyd et al. 2002).
14.5.4 Practical Example
Analyze the sand‐casting cost for casting 2,500 disks of ductile iron with dimensions of Ø200 mm and a width of
40 mm with a hole of Ø50 mm. Assume: 5‐mm machining allowance; manual casting process; a production rate of
20 molds/hour with 2 workers in the molding line; pattern plate dimensions 30 × 30 × 4 cm. Assume any reasonable
value for other required data.
The sand‐casting cost is estimated as follows:
The three terms of cost are individually calculated as follows:
 

Tooling cost (Ctooling):

where Wp is the weight of the poured casting, which is estimated as 1.3 times the
final cast weight to include approximately the weight of feeders, runners, and sprue.
The volume of the finished casting (Vfc) and its weight (Wfc) are as follows:
Therefore, the mold sand cost is
Core sand cost:
Assuming a core print of 10 mm per side, the core volume is
Therefore, the core sand cost is
Pattern plate cost:
Since the number of parts to be cast is 2,500, a pattern plate made of wood may be
reasonable. A plate of dimensions 300 × 300 mm with a thickness of 40 mm can fit
the imprints for the required pattern. Assuming a cost of $5/kg and a density of 600 
kg/m3, the material cost of the pattern plate is calculated as follows:
The cost of machining the pattern is
where Rt is assumed as $70/h; Nsp is the number of surface patches which is four
(Figure 14.5); and Ap is the projected area or the pattern imprints. Note that Npi is not
included in the above expression since there are no identical impressions.
Thus, the pattern plate cost is

where Rtf is 0.25 (Table 14.1) since the material of the plate is wood.
Core box cost:
For the core box, the dimensions of the cores are Ø40 mm and length 70 mm. A core
box of dimensions 90 × 60 × 60 mm can be enough. Assuming cast iron material, the
cost of the core box is:
The machining cost is:
since the number of patches is 3 (Figure 14.5) and the projected area is 7 × 4 cm. The
total cost of the core box is
Figure 14.5 Number of patches of the casting part and the core for pattern and core
box machining cost estimation.
As a result, the final tooling cost is computed as follows:
Note that Ntooling varies for pattern plates (wood material) and core boxes (cast iron
material).

Processing cost (Cproc):
The processing cost is expressed as
where
 
Processing cost of cores:
The cost of processing a particular core is
Assuming Rcm to be $60/h; Sc of 8%; Pff of 85%; and Pcm of 10 kg/worker‐hour.
Processing cost of molds:
The mold line processing cost per casting is
Assuming Rmp to be 130 $/h; Sm of 2%, Pff of 85%; one mold cavity per mold (Nc).
Processing cost of cleaning:
The cleaning labor time is
and the cleaning cost is then given by
where the worker rate for cleaning the room is assumed to be $25/hour.
As a conclusion, the total processing cost per casting is
Metal cost (Cmat).
The metal cost is given by the equation:
where the metal cost in $/kg, Cms, is defined as

These four terms are estimated as follows:
 
Raw material cost:
The material is ductile iron, then
Melting energy:
The cost related to the energy for melting the metal is
assuming Ect to be $0.16/kWh and Fff to be 60%.
Equipment cost:
To consider the machinery amortization, a depreciation value of 5% is assumed. The
price of the furnace is assumed to be $200,000 with an average production volume
per year of 25,000 kg.
Labor cost:
It is assumed a labor cost of $0.034/kg.
As a result, the total metal cost per kg is
Considering a metal loss factor of 1.1, the weight of the final cast part, the weight of
the metal poured and the scrap value of ductile iron (assumed to be $0.8/kg), the
total metal cost is
Finally, adding all three cost terms, the final sand‐casting cost per part is
14.6 Machining Cost Estimation (Ctmach)
The total machining cost of a part can be estimated (Boothroyd et al. 2002) as follows:
where Cmat is the material cost, Csetup is the setup cost, Cnon‐pr is the nonproductive cost, Cmach is the machining
cost, and Ctooling is the cost related to tooling considering both cutting tools and fixtures. How to estimate all these
cost terms is explained in detail in the following sections.
14.6.1 Material Cost (Cmat)
The material cost is frequently the most crucial element in the overall cost of a machined component, and it
frequently implies more than half of the overall cost. Material cost is straightforwardly calculated as

where Crm is the raw material cost in $/kg, and Wp is the weight of the preform to be machined. Table 14.4 lists
several materials' densities and typical costs in dollars per kilogram in their most common basic shapes. The
statistics in Table 14.4 can be used as a general reference, but process planners can get more precise quotations
from material suppliers.
14.6.2 Setup Cost (Csetup)
In machining, the main setup cost is related to the preparation time of machine tools and cutting tools (e.g.,
computer numerical control [CNC] programming, definition of coordinate systems, checking CNC programs, tools
and fixture calibrations, etc.). Table 14.5 shows typical setup times for basic machine tools and cutting tool
preparation (Boothroyd et al. 2002). To get the setup time per machined part, the overall setup time must be
divided by the batch size. Therefore, the setup cost is defined as follows:

where Nbatch is the number of parts per batch, Rsetup the worker labor rate in setup operations ($/hour), and tsetup the
time required for each setup operation (hour). Labor rates of $20–30/h can be considered as a reference value.
For CNC machines, CNC programs should be created and checked in the technical office with CNC simulators or
computer‐aided manufacturing (CAM) software. Although the time spent to create these programs highly depends
on many factors (complexity of the part, production volume to optimize tool paths, etc.), a typical programming
time of 2–5 hours can be a reasonable estimate. This cost is shared among all the parts produced under the same
CNC program. Note that the worker labor rate can be notably increased for CAM operations in order to amortize
the cost of software licenses.
14.6.3 Nonproductive Cost (Cnon‐pr)

Nonproductive costs are related to machine loading and unloading (Cld‐uld), handling parts between machines
(Chn), and nonmachining costs (Cnon‐mach). The nonproductive costs are estimated as
Some guidelines to estimate these types of nonproductive costs are presented in the following.
14.6.3.1 Machine Loading and Unloading (Cld‐uld)
Every time a workpiece is inserted into (and then removed from) a machine tool, nonproductive costs are incurred.
The cost associated with this activity depends on the time required and the labor cost, and it can be calculated as

where tld‐uld is the time of loading and unloading per part (hour), and Rld‐uld is the labor rate for these activities
($/hour). Table 14.6 shows common loading and unloading times depending on the weight of the workpiece and
the workholding system applied (Boothroyd et al. 2002).
14.6.3.2 Handling between Machines (Chn)
The cost of transporting batches of partially machined workpieces between machines should also be considered. At
the shop floor, forklift trucks are usually employed to transfer stacks of pallets of workpieces across the facility.
Depending on the type of forklift and its use, common cost rates are $2–5/h (Rhn). Knowing the distance (ltravel)
and the speed of the truck (vtravel, common speeds during transportation are 8–10 km/h), the travel time and its
associated cost are estimated. Thus, the cost of handling between machines is defined as
14.6.3.3 Nonmachining Movements (Cnon‐mach)
Machining and nonmachining movements should be estimated for cost purposes. Nonmachining movements are
included in the nonproductive cost. These movements are related to cutting engagement, tool position, withdrawal
movements, etc. The nonmachining costs can be estimated as
where Tnon‐mach is the time related to nonmachining movements during cutting tool trajectory (hour), and Cmr is the
machine's shop rate ($/hour). Table 14.7 lists some time components for these nonmachining movements. For most
machining shop floors, the machine's shop rate ranges $60–90/h.

14.6.4 Machining Cost (Cmach)
The machining cost depends on the time the machine tool is working and the machine's shop rate. Machining time
per part is evaluated as
where L is the length to be machined (mm), fn is the feed rate (mm/rev), and N is the spindle speed (rpm). The
spindle speed and the cutting speed are related through the equation:
where Vc is the cutting speed (m/min) and D refers to the diameter of the cutting tool (mm) in milling/drilling
operations or to the workpiece cutting diameter in turning operations. Knowing the machining time, the machining
cost is defined as
where Cmr is the machine's shop rate ($/hour). Typical rates are $60–90/h.
14.6.5 Tooling Costs (Ctooling)
In machining, tooling cost is related to both cutting tools and workholding/fixturing equipment. Considering both
terms, the tooling costs are defined as follows:
The specific expressions to estimate both terms are discussed in the following.
14.6.5.1 Cutting Tool Costs (Ccutting‐tools)
Cutting tool costs include the costs of the cutters due to the natural wearing out process (Ccutter), and the cost of
tool setting every time a cutting tool replacement is required (Csetting). Therefore, the cost related to cutting tools
per machined part is calculated as follows:
The cutter cost depends on the type of tool. On the one hand, for cutting tools based on cutting inserts, the insert
costs are calculated as follows:

where Cinsert‐edge is the cost per cutting edge of the tool, zinserts is the number of inserts in the indexable cutter, Tm
is the machining time to machine a part, and Tlife is the tool's life (15 and 20 minutes are common tool life values
for cutting tools). The cost per cutting edge of the tool is defined as follows:
where Cinsert is the total cost of the insert, and nedges is the number of available cutting edges, which depends on
the geometry of the insert and whether the insert is reversible or not. Table 14.8 shows common insert geometries
and their corresponding number of cutting edges.
On the other hand, for regrindable tools such as high‐speed steel (HSS) tools (Figure 14.6), the cost of regrinding
and their uses must also be included. In those cases, the cost per cutter is calculated as (Juneja 2003):
where Csolid is the cost of the solid cutter, nreground is the number of times the tool can be reground, and Cregrinding
is the cost of regrinding. Typically, most of the tools can be reground at different times (e.g., most of the end mills
can be reground at least three times), and the cost of re‐sharpening a tool is about 30% of the cost of the new one.
The cost of the insert or the solid cutter depends on the cutting tool material, shape, type of coating, etc. Table 14.9
shows different cutting tools and purchase prices from Hoffmann GmbH Quality Tools, a worldwide supplier of
tools and manufacturing equipment.
Another important cost related to the cutting tools is the setting cost. For instance, cutting inserts have to be
loosened, repositioned by bringing another cutting edge into the cutting position, and then clamping the screw
tight. This is conducted by a machining operator, and its associated cost is referred to as setting cost. The tool
setting cost is estimated (Sandvik Coromant 2017) as follows:
where Rsetting is the machine's shop rate ($/hour) for this operation, Tm is the machining cutting time (minutes), Tlife
is the cutting tool's life (minutes), and Tsetting is the time required for setting the tool (hour). Setting time can range
from 5 minutes for manual machine tools to 1 minute for CNC lathes and machining centers.

14.6.5.2 Fixturing Cost (Cfixturing)
Workholding devices were reviewed in Chapter 7, and they can be basically grouped into three main categories:
permanent fixturing, modular fixturing, and general‐purpose workholding devices. The estimation of fixturing cost
is based on the following expression:

The initial fixturing cost (Cini) is estimated by calculating the design expenses and the cost of all fixture
components, including the cost of assembling. This cost is shared among all the expected parts produced under this
workholding/fixturing device (Nlife). Additional costs are related to the setup process (Csetup) for every batch
operation such as inspection, calibration, cleaning, and greasing operations. This cost is shared among the parts
expected to be produced in a batch (Nbatch). Finally, the workholding/fixturing device may present a running cost
(Crun) related to loading and unloading activities (previously included in nonproductive costs, but they can instead
be added here), power actuators, etc. Very often, the running cost includes the machining and nonproductive costs
since the workholding selection may influence cutting tool trajectories, cutting parameters, etc.
14.6.6 Practical Example
Analyze the machining cost per part to manufacture a batch of 500 cylindrical parts in a CNC lathe. The operations
required are a face turning (cutting length of 15 mm) and a straight turning operation (cutting length of 40 mm).
The part is loaded onto a 3‐jaw chuck, and the same cutting tool is used for both turning operations. The workpiece
is a low carbon steel cylindrical bar of Ø30‐ and 60‐mm in length. Assume a cutting speed of 150 m/min, a feed
rate of 0.2 mm/rev for straight turning, and a feed rate of 100 mm/min for face turning. The cutting tool is a square,
nonreversible plain carbide insert. Assume any reasonable value for any additional information needed for cost
estimation.
The final machining cost is estimated by the following expression:
Each of the cost terms shown above is calculated as follows:
 
Material cost (Cmat).
The material cost is
Assuming the low carbon steel price of $2/kg. The weight of the part is calculated as follows:
Setup cost (Csetup).
According to Table 14.5, machine tool and cutting tool setup times are estimated as 0.5 and 0.15 
hours, respectively. Additionally, the part is very simple, so a CNC programming of 15 minutes is
added as a reasonable setup time. Assuming a working labor rate (Rsetup) of $40/h, the setup cost is
as follows:
Nonproductive cost (Cnon‐pr).
The nonproductive cost is estimated as
where
 
Machine loading and unloading:

According to Table 14.6, the loading and unloading time for a part weight of 0.33 kg
and a 3‐jaw chuck workholding is 23 seconds. Thus, the cost of handling the part in
the CNC lathe is
assuming a labor rate of $30/hour.
Handling between machines:
There is no other machining station, so this cost is 0.
Nonmachining movements:
The nonmachining time is assumed to be 1.5 seconds to engage the tool per
operation (Table 14.7). Thus, the nonmachining cost is
assuming machine's shop rate of $70/hour and 1.5 seconds for the engage time in
both machining operations.
As a result, the nonproductive cost is
Machining cost (Cmach)
The machining time per part for straight turning is
since the spindle speed is
For the face turning operation, the machining time is
Thus, the machining cost is
assuming a shop‐floor rate of $70/hour.
Tooling cost (Ctooling)
The tooling cost is estimated as
where
 
Cutting tool costs:

Cutting tool costs include cutter and setting costs:
The cutting tool is a square nonreversible plain carbide insert; thus, the cutter cost is
assuming 15‐minutes tool's life and the insert cost per edge is
Note that the inserts are square and nonreversible (four cutting edges), and the cost
of each insert is assumed to be $6 (Table 14.9).
The tool setting cost is
assuming $20/hour rate for setting and 2 minutes time for cutting tool setting.
As a result, the cutting tool cost per part is
Fixturing costs:
In relation to fixturing cost, the setup is assumed to be already included in the
machine tool setup cost (Csetup), so only the depreciation of the chuck during
machining is included. Although hard to estimate, it is assumed that 50,000 parts can
be manufactured within the chuck's working life, and a 3‐jaw chuck cost is assumed
to be $1,100. Therefore,
As a result, the total tooling cost is
Finally, the total machining cost per part is obtained by adding all previous terms
14.7 3D Printing Cost Estimation (C3Dpr)
To estimate the cost of 3D printed parts, three main terms should be evaluated: material cost (Cmat), operating cost
(Cop), and postprocessing cost (Cpost). Therefore, the 3D printing cost is estimated as
Each cost from the previous equation can be estimated as discussed in the following.
14.7.1 Material Cost (Cmat)

The material cost highly depends on the 3D printing technique applied. For instance, in fused deposition modeling
(FDM), also named as fused filament fabrication (FFF), the cost of common materials such as Polylactic acid
(PLA), Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), and Polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) is around $20–35/kg.
However, for metallic filaments composed of 90% by weight of sinterable metallic powders and 10% binder
polymers, the cost may range $150–400/kg. When selective laser sintering (SLS) technology is applied, materials
are in the form of powder, which notably increases their cost with respect to their filament equivalents. A sintered
powder of polyamide (PA12) costs around $120/kg to $170/kg, which means 20–30 times higher than the same
material in the form of pellets for plastic injection molding and 2.5 times higher than the material in filament form
for FDM. Other technologies, such as stereolithography (SLA), use photopolymer resins with a cost of around
$50–200/kg or higher, depending on the type of resins. More advanced technologies, such as direct melting laser
sintering (DMLS), uses metal powders that may cost $100–500/kg, depending on the metal alloy.
The material cost in 3D printing is straightforwardly estimated given the 3D part design. The software used for
slicing and creating the 3D printing layers provides information about the kilograms of material needed to build
the part, including supports if required. Therefore, the material cost is calculated as follows:

where Crm is the raw material cost of the filament per kilogram (Table 14.10), and Wp is the weight of the printed
part. If the weight of the printed part is not obtained from the software that creates the layers for printing, it can be
estimated considering the volume of the part and the density of the material. However, in this case, it should be
noted that 3D printing parts are printed under an infill parameter that will define the resulting density of the part.
The required infill for the part should be estimated to determine the total weight of the part after printing. Common
infill values are 15–30% for parts that do not require mechanical strength.
14.7.2 Operating Cost (Cop)
The operating cost is the result of adding the costs related to manpower (Cman), electricity (Celec), and the cost of
the equipment (Ceq). The operating cost is then defined as follows:
Each of these costs is estimated as discussed in the following.
14.7.2.1 Cost of manpower (Cman)
The use of software for slicing the part and the cost of preparing the printer and setting the correct printing values
should be considered here. The time required for preparing the 3D printer and the slicing process may vary
depending on the technology used, but in general the time is not high, and 0.5–2 hours may be reasonable. The 3D
printing process is automated, so the time of printing does not require the operator's action. The cost of manpower
can be defined as follows:

where Tsetup is the time for preparing the 3D printer and the slicing process (hour), and R3Dpr is the labor rate
($/hour). A labor rate of $20–30/h can be assumed for personnel working on the 3D printers, although these figures
can increase notably depending on the 3D printer type and technology used. Note that this cost related to setup is
shared within the production volume if more than one part is printed.
14.7.2.2 Electricity Cost (Celec)
The electrical power consumption for most 3D printers of FDM technology ranges from 0.1 to 0.5 kW. Other
technologies based on power lasers, such as SLS technologies, can range from 1 to 5 kW, especially for large
industrial printers (Gebhardt and Hötter 2016). When dealing with metal additive manufacturing, technologies
such as DMLS can reach up to 20 kW of power consumption in the case of large‐scale printers.
In general, the electricity cost is very low in 3D printing technologies based on polymers, and it is often
overlooked. For instance, given a common electricity cost of $0.16/kWh with a printer of 500 W, the cost per hour
is $0.08. The electricity cost for any technology can be derived as follows:
where Relec is the electricity cost per kWh (e.g., $0.16/kWh), Pprint is the power consumption of the 3D printer in
kW, and Tprint is the printing time (hour).
14.7.2.3 Cost of the equipment (Ceq)
When calculating the cost of using any equipment, the most common practice is to use amortization or
depreciation costs. The way to calculate amortization is to divide the price of the equipment (i.e., the 3D printer)
by the number of hours that the machine is going to be used until it is amortized. This amortization cost is then
added to the total manufacturing cost to consider the equipment cost due to the natural “wearing out” process.
Therefore, the cost of the equipment as the amortization cost can be written as follows:
where P3Dpr is the purchase cost of the 3D printing equipment, Ttotal is the total time (hour) that the equipment is
expected to be used along its lifecycle, and Tprint is the printing time (hour) required for the 3D printing part under
evaluation.
14.7.3 Postprocessing Cost (Cpost)
Postprocessing of 3D printed parts is a labor‐intensive operation, and it is almost required for any 3D printed part.
Costs related to polishing, painting, removal of supports or excess powder, ultraviolet (UV) curing, etc., are
included here. In many cases the cost of postprocessing may be higher than the rest of the total costs. A National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) study found that postprocessing expenditures account for 4–13% of
overall production costs in 3D printing parts (Thomas and Gilbert 2014). To estimate this cost, consider the hourly
rate and the time required for postprocessing:
where Tpost is the total postprocessing time (hour) and Rpost the worker labor rate ($/hour). In an early estimation
cost, a 10% increase in the overall production cost is reasonable.
Note that additional costs may be included if metal 3D printing parts are considered. For instance, metal FDM
parts require a debinding and sintering process after printing, which increases the cost notably. Metallic filament
vendors offer these services at approximately $80–100/kg.
14.7.4 Practical Example

Analyze the 3D printing cost for a part made of an ABS part printed using the FDM technology. The information
from the slicing system gives a material weight of 150 g and a printing time of 16 hours 30 minutes. After printing,
a postprocessing operation is required to remove supports and improve surface roughness, which is estimated to
last 1 hour. Estimate the manufacturing cost and assume reasonable values for labor rates and other needed terms.
The 3D printing cost of the part is estimated by the following equation:
where the three cost terms are calculated as follows:
 
Material cost.
The material cost of ABS filament, according to Table 14.10, is $22/kg. Then, the material cost is
Operating cost.
The operating cost is estimated as
where these three terms are calculated as follows.
 
Cost of manpower.
The manpower cost related to the setup process is estimated. A fixed 30‐minute setup
time (printer setup and slicing process) and a labor rate of $20/hour are assumed
reasonable for polymer FDM printers. Therefore,
Electricity cost.
The electricity cost is evaluated knowing the printing time, the 3D printing power
consumption and the electricity cost. Assuming a middle‐range printer for polymer
FDM technology, 400 W can be a reasonable power consumption with an electricity
cost of $0.15/kWh. Therefore,
Equipment cost.
The equipment cost is estimated as:
If a middle‐range printer for polymer FDM technology is assumed, a purchase cost
of around $5,000 can be reasonable. Assuming a useful lifespan of 7 years and an
operating time per year of around 1,000 hours, the amortization cost is
As a result, the operation cost is
Postprocessing cost.
As postprocessing cost, 1 hour of postprocessing at a labor rate of $20/hour is considered.
Therefore,

Finally, the total 3D printing cost is estimated as:
14.8 Computer‐Aided Cost Estimators
Many different software can help designers with an early estimation of manufacturing costs. These tools let
designers modify and check product designs in a very efficient way. For instance, most of CAD software have
integrated tools to estimate machining costs, casting costs, sheet metal costs, 3D printing costs, etc. The estimation
is based on templates that can be easily edited to include shop‐floor characteristics, including labor rates, overhead
rates, plant efficiency, etc. Figure 14.7 shows an example of cost estimation using SolidWorks Costing for
machining parts. There are other specialized cost‐estimating software packages designed to handle comprehensive
manufacturing cost calculations. Examples include aPriori, Costimator, DFM Concurrent Costing, CostWorks, etc.
14.9 Web‐Based Tools for Cost Estimation
Nowadays, many websites from the industry obtain good manufacturing cost estimations using some basic
geometry data, labor cost, and some other information from the shop floor. Although many of the equations that
evaluate the final cost are not visible to the user, their results can be used as a good starting point for early cost
estimations in different product designs and process plans. In fact, many of these websites use similar
mathematical relationships to the ones shown in this chapter. Figure 14.8 shows an example of a popular website
for rapid cost estimation in plastic injection molding, die casting, sand‐casting, and machining processes. Other
popular websites are listed in the following:

14.10 Product Costing Sheets
It is common to use costing templates or costing sheets to estimate the cost and the profit of a product within the
process planning. Decisions about make‐or‐buy, source of bought material, manufacturing cost for the parts
manufactured, overhead cost, etc., are indicated in these costing sheets to show the economic feasibility of the
product. Figures 14.9 and 14.10 show simple templates for this purpose.

Appendix 2: Cutting Data
This appendix provides information about cutting data in turning, milling, and drilling operations. The following
information is given along with the appendix:
 
Recommended cutting data for milling/turning/drilling. Ranges for cutting speed (Vc) and feed rate (fz or fn).
Source: different cutting tool vendors (Walter Titex, Fette, Sandvik, Kennametal).
Specific cutting force to estimate cutting forces according to Chapter 10.
Cross‐reference material table and ISO codes to identify a specific workpiece material according to the
standards DIN, AISI/SAE, UNE, AFNOR, UNI and JIS.
The data provided in this appendix should be used as a starting point for machining. A more adequate cutting data
can be obtained considering the information provided by the cutting tool vendor of the specific cutting tools
employed and even after conducting some experimental tests.
