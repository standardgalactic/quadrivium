About the Author
Rik DeGunther attended the University of Illinois as an undergraduate and 
Stanford University as a graduate student, studying both applied physics and 
engineering economics (some of this education actually stuck). He holds several 
United States Patents and has designed a wide range of technical equipment 
including solar energy platforms, military grade radar jammers, weather 
measurement equipment, high-powered radar vacuum tubes, computerized 
production hardware, golf practice devices, digital and analog electronic 
circuits, unmanned aerial vehicles, guitars and amplifiers, microwave filters 
and mixers, automatic cabinet openers, strobe light communications systems, 
explosive devices (strictly on accident), cloud height sensors, fog sensors, 
furniture, houses, barns, rocket ships, dart throwers, flame throwers, eaves-
dropping devices, escape routes, and you name it. He’s one of those nerdy 
guys who likes to take things apart to see how they work and then put them 
back together and try to figure out what the left over parts are for.
Rik is CEO of Efficient Homes, an energy efficiency auditing firm in Northern 
California. He is actively engaged in designing and developing new solar equip-
ment, including off-grid lighting systems and off-grid swimming pool heaters. He 
writes weekly op-ed columns for the Mountain Democrat, California’s oldest and 
most venerable newspaper. He has also written a highly acclaimed golf book (on 
putting) and spends most of his free time attempting to improve his relatively 
impressive but objectively droll golf handicap, usually to no avail. Sometimes the 
urge strikes him to play a very loud guitar, of which he owns a collection with far 
more intrinsic quality than the playing they receive. His hearing has been falter-
ing the last few years, so he rebuilt his amplifier to go up to eleven. 


Dedication
Of course this book is dedicated to Katie, Erik, and Ally. Without them, the 
world would wobble inefficiently on its axis, and this work of art wouldn’t exist.

Introduction
A
 well-maintained home is integral to a comfortable, secure lifestyle. As 
long as you maintain your home’s integrity and promote its efficiency 
and harmony, it will nurture and comfort you in return.
Energy Efficient Homes For Dummies can help you make changes in your 
household lifestyle to save money and energy and reduce pollution. Every 
single home can use this book. It doesn’t matter what kind of dwelling you live 
in (apartment, house, condo, geodesic dome, tent, you name it); nor does it 
matter whether you’re a renter or an owner. It doesn’t matter where you live 
or what your climate is. Everybody can benefit from seeking better efficiency. 
Regardless of whether you want to make small, incremental improvements, or 
grandiose, world-shaking changes, this book points you in the right direction.
You don’t need to sacrifice your quality of life. Many of the tips and projects 
I show you in this book are easy and inexpensive. Many projects even make 
your lifestyle more comfortable and enjoyable.
A theme you see running through this book is the idea of payback — how 
long it takes for an efficiency investment to begin saving you money. Well, 
here’s good news about the payback of this book: You can easily save ten 
times more money in your annual operating costs than the price you paid 
for this book (unless you stole it, which is about as efficient as you can get, 
although not recommended by either me or law enforcement).
About This Book
A number of energy-efficiency books are on the market, as you undoubtedly 
know already. So a lot of information is available: some of it scientific, some 
anecdotal, and some of it just plain wrong. In this book, I offer my years of 
experience in the subject of energy efficiency, but perhaps even more important, 
I condense all the myriad ideas, beliefs, and notions about energy efficiency 
into that which is the best and most helpful. You can find a lot more ways to 
make your home energy-efficient than what’s in this book, but in keeping with 
the For Dummies modus operandi, I give you the best ones.
This book provides you with ample knowledge of energy- and cost-efficiency 
concepts to turn your home into a marvel of efficiency. You can do most of 
the projects and improvements I describe yourself. And when you need to 
hire a contractor, I tell you how best to go about the process.

Energy Efficient Homes For Dummies 
People have their own fundamental reasons for wanting to achieve efficiency. 
Some people simply want to lower their operating costs, particularly with 
regard to energy consumption. Some people want to minimize their pollution 
footprint on the environment and will pay extra money to do so. Others just 
want to simplify their complicated lifestyles. In this book, I present you with 
the tradeoffs. I make no judgments about how you should order your priorities. 
I simply tell you how best to proceed, given the various alternatives. In other 
words, in this book I present the pros and cons of every issue and let you 
decide what’s best for you. I leave the nagging to somebody else.
In this book, you find information like
 
 What efficiency means and how you can put together your own efficiency plan
 
 What a home energy audit reveals about your household energy use and 
how you can perform an audit yourself
 
 How to seal your home against the weather, get better performance 
from your heating and air-conditioning systems for less cost, and other 
helpful suggestions and advice
 
 How to take advantage of Mother Nature and a few key tricks to maintain 
comfortable temperatures in your home
 
 How to reduce your waste by reusing and recycling
 
 The advantages and disadvantages of different energy alternatives — 
such as wood stoves, gas stoves, solar power, geothermal systems, and 
so on — which are becoming more common as the price of energy rises
 
 Your options for financing efficiency improvements
Some readers look at the table of contents and skip straight to a particular 
section that addresses an immediate need. Others start in Chapter 1 and 
work their way diligently to Chapter 25. And either approach is just fine and 
dandy because all For Dummies books are structured so that you can jump in 
and out or read them straight through to get the information you need.
Conventions Used in This Book
For simplicity’s sake, this book follows a few conventions:
 
 Italicized terms are immediately followed by definitions.
 
 Bold indicates the action parts in numbered steps. It also emphasizes 
the keywords in a bulleted list.

 Introduction
 
 Web site addresses show up in monofont.
 
 When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have needed to 
break across two lines of text. Rest assured that I haven’t put in any extra 
characters (such as hyphens) to indicate the break. Just type in exactly 
what you see in this book, pretending as though the line break didn’t exist.
What You’re Not to Read
I don’t flatter myself into thinking that you are interested in reading this 
entire book, although I do have to admit that it’s excellent reading, full of wit 
and humor which nicely complements the robust, energy-saving information. 
In the name of efficiency — in this regard, saving you time — let me tell you 
what you can safely skip:
 
 Material in sidebars: Sure, these are interesting. Some are fun. I like to 
think that all are helpful. But they contain info that you don’t absolutely, 
positively, without-a-doubt need to have to become more energy-efficient.
 
 Paragraphs marked with the Technical Stuff icon: Some people like details: 
the nuts and bolts of why or how things work; the statistics that back up a 
point; the nitty-gritty, down-and-dirty esoterica that every topic — especially 
one like this — has. If you’re not one of these people, you can safely skip 
these paragraphs without missing any need-to-know info.
Foolish Assumptions
In writing this book, I made a few assumptions about you:
 
 You want to make your home more efficient, in a number of different 
ways. You have already decided to move forward, but aren’t sure which 
direction is the right one, or what speed to move at. You want to make 
the best decisions, and understand that those decisions are entirely 
yours to make.
 
 You have some handiwork skills. You can handle a screwdriver and per-
haps a power drill, although this isn’t strictly necessary. You know a few 
basics about how to get things done, and you understand that with every 
project there are safety rules (I’ll help you out here, when appropriate).

Energy Efficient Homes For Dummies 
 
 You want to get to the end product as sensibly and efficiently as 
possible. (Note I didn’t say quickly, because that inevitably leads to 
errors in both judgment and facilitation.) You don’t have an engineering 
degree, and you don’t want to know every technical detail concerning 
the various technologies. You simply want to get the job done, once 
you’ve made up your mind which job you want to do.
 
 You need working knowledge of a project so that you can hire 
professionals and discuss matters with them. You don’t plan on 
handling a major project yourself, but you want enough information 
to make informed decisions sensibly and efficiently.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into parts, each one dealing with a particular topic related 
to energy efficiency. Each part contains chapters relating to the part topic. The 
following sections give you an overview of the content within each part.
Part I: Solving the World’s Problems 
from Your Front Porch
The place to start when you want to become more energy efficient is to 
understand the very basics about energy — namely, where it comes from and 
where and how it’s used. The next step is to take a look at your own energy 
consumption so that you can decide where best to invest your time and 
efforts to improve the efficiency of your home. In addition to covering this 
information, Part I also reviews some financial options to make your invest-
ments more affordable and provides practical information on how to make 
the decisions that are best for you from a financial point of view.
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies 
throughout Your Home
You’ll probably find this part one of the most productive because it deals 
with the biggest energy consumers in your home. Here you can find details 
on how to change your consumption habits as well as how to invest in new 
equipment to achieve better efficiency. If you’re interested only in getting 
moving, right now, go to this part first.

 Introduction
Part III: Putting Alternative Energy 
Sources to Work for You
As energy costs rise, the need for alternatives to the standard oil/utility energy 
sources grows. You can cut yourself loose from the utilities by employing 
stoves or geothermal, solar, and other alternative sources in your home. This 
part lists the alternative energy options that are available and tells you about 
both their advantages and disadvantages.
Part IV: Considering Efficiency When 
You Buy, Build, or Sell a Home
If you’re in the market for a house or selling one, you can make energy effi-
ciency one of the key features to look for or promote. If you’re a buyer, what 
do you look for? And if you’re a seller, what do you emphasize? This part has 
the answers. And because many folks have their homes built, this part also 
explains how to build your own energy-efficient home from the ground up. 
Finally, because your environment dictates your options to a large degree, I 
tell you what to keep in mind as you pick a community to live in.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Like every For Dummies book, this part includes quick resources that provide 
plenty of information and sage advice compacted into few words. Want a list 
of the best efficiency investments? How about efficiency projects you can do 
in an hour or less? This part offers this information and more.
Icons Used in This Book
This book uses several icons that make it easy for you to identify particular 
types of information:
 
This icon highlights important information to store in your brain for quick 
recall at a later time.
 
This icon indicates a nifty little shortcut or time-saver.

Energy Efficient Homes For Dummies 
 
Look out! Quicksand is afoot. You don’t want to skip over the warnings. They point 
out dangers to your health and well-being, your property, or your bank account.
 
The Technical Stuff icon lets you know that some particularly nerdy informa-
tion is coming up so that you can skip it if you want. (On the other hand, you 
may want to read it, and you don’t actually have to be a nerd. You only have 
to be able to read.)
Where to Go from Here
On your mark, get set, GO! “Where?” you ask. Any where you want. If you’re 
not sure where to begin, I suggest starting in Chapter 1 or glancing through 
the Table of Contents for a topic that interests you. Or you can go to the 
index to find a specific topic that you want to know more about.
After that, get your tools out, tear open the boxes of stuff you delightedly 
bought, don your coveralls and safety glasses, and get to work. And have fun 
while you’re at it.
 
Attitude is the one and only thing you have complete control over in your life. 
Projects rarely, if ever, go the way you envisioned as you were drawing up the 
plans. As a lifelong practitioner of projects big and small, I have learned to be 
patient and enjoy the road every bit as much as the destination. When you run 
into problems — which you will — smile, take a step back, and come up with a 
witty joke. The one thing I have learned over and over again (I always have to 
learn things more than once before they sink in) is that the harder a project is, 
the more rewarding it will be when it’s finished. I can pretty much guarantee 
that you’re going to find out precisely what I’m talking about. Above all else, 
remember this: Measure twice, cut once.

Part I
Solving the 
World’s Problems 
from Your 
Front Porch

In this part . . .
E
nergy usage is becoming an increasingly important 
aspect of our personal lives. Energy costs are rising, 
a trend that will surely continue. Because of the political 
ramifications of obtaining the energy we need, we all can 
help mitigate the huge problems that our energy consump-
tion creates. The easiest, and often the cheapest, way for 
each and every one of us to reduce energy consumption is 
by being more efficient with the energy that we use. 
In this part I explain general concepts about energy so 
that you can make the decisions that let you reach your 
own energy efficiency goals. I show you how to accurately 
assess and measure how you use energy in your home so 
that you can decide how to invest your own personal 
energy and time in making improvements. I also give you 
a simple way to analyze financial investments so that you 
can get the most bang for your hard earned bucks.

Chapter 1
Defining Efficiency
In This Chapter
 Looking at four types of efficiencies
 Recognizing inefficiencies
 Finding ways to increase efficiency
E
fficiency is the production of a desired effect with a minimum amount of 
effort or waste. That’s the official definition, but you probably already 
have an intuitive sense of what energy efficiency means. Maybe to you it means 
using less. Maybe it means saving more. Believe it or not, those two goals don’t 
always mean the same thing. That’s because there are different kinds of effi-
ciencies — energy, financial, pollution, and labor. (Yes, I know that the title of 
this book is Energy Efficiency Homes For Dummies, and that angle takes front 
and center, but it’s not the whole picture. I think it’s important to understand 
some of the tradeoffs that are inherent in most of your decisions.)
To set and achieve your own efficiency goals, you need to be familiar with 
the different kinds of efficiencies, understand how these can be at cross-pur-
poses, and get an idea of how you can begin to pursue your energy-efficiency 
goals. This chapter gives you the lowdown.
Examining the Four Main Spokes 
of the Efficiency Wheel
There are four different aspects of efficiency:
 
 Energy efficiency: Getting the most useful output from energy sources
 
 Financial efficiency: Getting the most for the least amount of money
 
 Pollution efficiency: Polluting as little as possible
 
 Labor efficiency: Spending the most time relaxing on the couch

10
Part I: Solving the World’s Problems from Your Front Porch 
 
To find the right balance among these different types of efficiencies, you need 
to ask yourself what you value the most. If you’re only interested in lowering 
your costs, financial efficiency is your sole criterion. If you’re interested in 
going green, living an efficient, energy-conserving lifestyle, you want to con-
sider pollution and energy efficiency. An ultra-green lifestyle implies pollution 
efficiency more than energy efficiency or financial efficiency. And going green 
also requires more labor than a conventional lifestyle. But perhaps your only 
goal in life is to maximize the amount of time you spend at leisure (believe me, 
I’m empathetic). In this case, labor efficiency is your most important goal.
In this section, I present some detailed examples of these different types of 
efficiencies, and in the process, set up the basic premise of this book: Making 
investment decisions for efficiency improvements in your home always 
involves tradeoffs. To determine where the energy inefficiencies are in your 
home, head to Chapter 3. Chapter 5 gives you advice on how to decide which 
tradeoffs are best for you.
Energy efficiency
The energy efficiency of a device is a comparison, or ratio, of the useful 
energy output to the total energy input. This ratio is always related to the 
particular situation (the season, timing, desired end result, and so on).
For example, we want a light bulb to produce light. But we all know that a 
light bulb also produces heat — sometimes a great deal. In the summertime 
we don’t want the heat, so the process is inefficient. A typical incandescent 
bulb converts only 10 percent of input electrical energy into light energy; the 
rest goes into heat. Therefore, the efficiency is 10 percent, or very poor. If 
enough light bulbs are turned on at the same time, the air conditioner may 
have to be turned on, which means even more inefficiency.
However, in the wintertime you can readily use that “inefficient” heat 
because it essentially decreases the load on your heating system. In this 
case, the efficiency may be close to 100 percent. You don’t have to turn on 
your inefficient heating system nearly as much, so using incandescent light 
bulbs in the winter is a highly energy-efficient process.
Of course, outdoor incandescent light bulbs are just as inefficient in the winter 
as in the summer. And light bulbs in an unoccupied room are inefficient as well.
 
As you evaluate where inefficiencies exist in your own home, consider all the 
factors that the come into play: the season, the desired outcome, and so on.

11
 Chapter 1: Defining Efficiency
Financial efficiency
The financial efficiency of an appliance is the comparison, or ratio, of cost 
savings to the cost of the appliance (which includes the original equipment 
cost plus installation costs and maintenance costs, including energy). The 
better the ratio of cost savings to price, the more financially efficient an 
investment is. Another term for “financially efficient” is “cost effective.” I use 
these terms interchangeably.
Solar photovoltaic (PV) panels, for example, are capable of saving costs on 
a power bill, and they have a well-defined initial price. Similarly, the cost of 
a new, more efficient appliance can, over a relatively short time period, be 
earned back by the energy savings.
Pollution efficiency
The pollution efficiency of an appliance is a comparison, or ratio, of the 
useful output work (the job that is being done) to the amount of pollution that 
is generated in the process. Solar PV panels create impressive output power 
while generating essentially zero pollution. Coal stoves create a lot of output 
power but also generate a lot of pollution. In evaluating pollution efficiency, 
you need to consider more than just how much pollution the appliance or 
system outputs. Solar panels, for example, create no pollution while they are 
operating, but pollution is created in the process of manufacturing a solar 
panel.
 
As you weigh the costs and benefits of pollution efficiency, keep in mind that 
there are usually no easy answers because the values being compared aren’t 
always mathematically measurable. How much value, for example, do you 
attribute to helping the environment? Acceptable costs differ depending on 
your viewpoint. Some people, for example, want only to go green, in which 
case they will accept poor financial efficiency in favor of good pollution 
efficiency. Others try to balance financial and pollution efficiencies.
Conservation versus efficiency
Conserving energy simply means using less. 
Turning all the lights off in your house is con-
servation. Efficiency, on the other hand, is using 
less energy to achieve the same result. Plugging 
in fluorescents is practicing energy efficiency. 
Turning off the light and stumbling around in the 
dark is conservation. The meanings overlap, but 
the distinction is useful. For instance, if you use 
a programmable thermostat to turn your heater 
off during the day while you’re at work and then 
turn it back on right before you get home, you’re 
achieving better efficiency by conserving.

12
Part I: Solving the World’s Problems from Your Front Porch 
Labor efficiency
Labor efficiency is a comparison, or ratio, of how much work an appliance 
does to the amount of personal labor required to run and maintain it. A wood 
stove, for example, is labor inefficient because you have to stack wood, haul 
it inside, set it in the burn chamber, watch and stoke the fire as necessary, 
and then clean ashes. A gas stove, on the other hand, is very labor efficient 
— you only need to turn it off and on. Labor also includes pre-buy research, 
purchase hassles (like financing or delivery truck rental), installation 
(including cost of tools and hourly labor), and the maintenance and 
operational burdens over time.
Analyzing efficiencies
When analyzing efficiencies, be sure to consider the life expectancy of a particular 
investment. Answer these questions for every option you’re considering:
 
 How long will an appliance last?
 
 How does the pollution output vary over time?
 
 Will the energy efficiency decrease over time (the answer is almost 
always yes because parts wear out, friction increases, and so on) and if 
so how by how much?
 
 How much maintenance will be required over time, and will you be able 
to do the labor and maintenance, in years hence?
 
 How long is the warranty, and how much will unwarranted repairs cost?
 
 Who will be doing the service and where do parts come from?
 
 How will the future costs of energy affect the financial efficiencies?
 
 What are the financing costs and are there tax advantages now? Will 
there be tax advantages in the future that aren’t available now?
To find out how to determine the payback of energy-efficient improvements 
you’re thinking about, go to Chapter 5.

13
 Chapter 1: Defining Efficiency
Opening Your Eyes to Inefficiency
Most people don’t understand just how inefficient energy-consuming 
processes are. If you’re only interested in cost effectiveness, you don’t really 
need to know how inefficient processes are because, for you, saving money is 
the bottom line. But if you’re interested in energy efficiency, and particularly 
pollution efficiency, you should understand just how utterly inefficient most 
energy consuming processes are. It would be impossible to define all the 
ways energy consumption processes are inefficient in a single book, much 
less a short introductory chapter, but it is important that you get a feel for 
the scope of the problem. The following sections offer two examples to 
illustrate.
Electrical grid inefficiencies
Most household appliances are powered by electricity, which is the least 
efficient method of consuming energy (more on this in Chapter 2). In many 
cases, it’s also the most polluting alternative, because a majority of electrical 
energy comes from coal-fired furnaces. In addition, electrical energy is trans-
mitted via the power grid, which uses power lines and transformers to deliver 
the AC voltages to your home. There are line losses (lines heat up and lose 
energy in the process) in the power wires, sometimes as much as 50 percent if 
the distances are great. Every transformer and substation is inefficient as well.
Looking at energy storage and efficiency
Some forms of energy are easy to store. 
Gasoline is a liquid that pours easily and can be 
transported readily. It can sit in a sealed con-
tainer for years. Wood pellets can be stored 
for years with little loss in potential. Corn, on 
the other hand, attracts rodents and can very 
quickly go from being fuel in your storage bin 
to “food” that attracts large, furry assaults in 
the middle of the night. The heat from a fire 
can be stored in the materials in a room, but it 
doesn’t last very long after the fire goes out. It’s 
beneficial to consider energy not as a go/no-go 
proposition, but as a continuum.
Solar energy, on the other hand, can’t be stored, 
so it must be converted into a different form in 
order to be stored. Solar power can be stored 
as heat, which is how a solar domestic hot 
water heater works. Or it can be converted into 
electricity and fed into a battery, which then 
converts the electrical energy into chemical 
energy. When the energy is to be used, later that 
night or the next morning, the chemical energy 
is then converted back into electrical energy, 
which is fed into an appliance. This whole chain 
process is extremely inefficient because each 
step in the process is inefficient and the inef-
ficiencies only multiply.

14
Part I: Solving the World’s Problems from Your Front Porch 
As a general rule, electrical systems are only around 30 percent efficient. This 
means that the electricity that comes into your home is mostly wasted before 
you use it. And when you use it — even if you use it wisely — you’re wasting 
a good deal of it as well.
Consider a vacuum cleaner. How much energy does it take to move a small 
pile of dust from your floor to the vacuum bag? Very little. But by the time 
you get done plugging your vacuum cleaner into the wall socket and turn-
ing on a big, noisy electrical motor and swishing the wand across the floor, 
you’ve used hordes of energy. So vacuuming is maybe around 5 percent 
efficient. Compound this with the electrical inefficiencies from the utility grid 
and you come up with a net efficiency of less than 2 percent! This means that 
you’ve used 50 times more energy than you really needed to clean that dust 
up off your floor. At the same time, you’ve released 50 times more carbon 
dioxide into the atmosphere. An alternative? Get out the broom and dustpan.
Transportation inefficiencies
Autos take a lot of energy to produce. Factories consume copious amounts 
of electrical power, and most factories have their own power substations 
with transformers and high-voltage lines. So before you even drive your new 
car off the lot, you’ve consumed nearly as much energy as your car will con-
sume to transport you the first 30,000 miles. This is true for even the most 
fuel-efficient autos and trucks. And it’s certainly true for a hybrid auto, which 
consumes even more energy to produce than a conventional auto.
Your car weighs around 30 times more than you, so the vast majority of 
energy it expends to transport you to work and back is actually dedicated to 
transporting itself back and forth. You represent just a small fraction of the 
total work expended. Now that’s inefficient!
The big oil companies burn around two gallons of gasoline to get you a gallon 
at the pump. Energy is required for drilling the crude from the ground, and 
then transporting the raw crude to a refinery some distance away. The 
process of cracking (breaking down raw components so as to output refined 
products such as gasoline, heating oil, and so on) requires a great deal 
of energy. Then the refined products need to be transported, first to the 
regional hubs and from there to the local gas stations. Gas stations consume 
energy and resources so that they can operate and sell you the gas.
All in all, your auto represents about 1 percent efficiency compared to a 
bicycle.

15
 Chapter 1: Defining Efficiency
Becoming More Efficient
Efficiency is the cheapest and easiest way to save the world from the run-
away effects of human consumption. A wide number of new technologies 
are coming onto the market with the express goal of reducing the amount of 
energy it takes to perform a particular task. A myriad of new devices purport 
to reduce pollution while doing the same essential work. But it’s a simple fact 
that the easiest, fastest, and cheapest way to reduce pollution and energy 
usage is simply by using less energy with the equipment you already have.
 
When you recycle, you are saving resources, energy, and landfill space. Go 
to Chapter 14 to find out how simply using less, reusing more, and recycling 
what’s left over can yield big efficiency benefits.
Getting greater efficiency from 
your current systems
You don’t need to invest in new equipment to achieve impressive results. For 
example, when you drive less, you use less gas. Two people in a large SUV 
use less gas per person than two people each in their own separate hybrids, 
so carpooling is much more effective than fuel-efficient autos.
Similarly, when you turn your thermostat down in the winter and put on a 
sweater, you are immediately using less energy, and this is just one simple 
example.
There are myriad other ways to reduce inefficiencies in nearly every aspect 
of your home: sealing leaks and beefing up your insulation, taking advantage 
of natural air movement, using your appliance more efficiently, and so on. 
Head to Part II for system-by-system solutions.
Supplementing or replacing 
existing systems
Sometimes the way to greater efficiency is to replace or supplement your 
existing systems with more-energy-efficient systems. When you replace an 
open fireplace with a high-efficiency wood or gas stove, for example, you 
not only eliminate the unbelievable amount of energy waste associated with 
open hearths, but you supplement your existing HVAC system, meaning you 
can use it less. Part III explains how these alternative energy sources and 
others — solar power, radiant heat, geothermal heating systems and so on — 
can enhance efficiency.

Every contribution you make adds up. There are no “little” contributions. The 
U.S. Department of Energy has estimated that if everybody were to pitch in, 
energy consumption could be reduced by up to 20 percent. That’s a major 
and immediate change in not only our dependence on foreign oil, but our 
contribution to greenhouse gases. If everybody were willing to pitch in not 
only by being more energy-efficient, but also by investing a few hundred 
dollars for improvements, energy consumption could be reduced by up to 30 
percent. This would drop the cost of energy because demand would decrease, 
and the net effect would be more like a 40 percent reduction in cost for all of us.

R
ichard Feynman, one of the most famous physics lecturers of all time, 
began his courses on energy by stating that nobody really understands 
what energy is. That being said, we all have an intuitive idea of what energy 
does, namely perform work. It takes energy to make something happen. This 
book is interested in making do with less energy consumption. If you are 
interested in jumping right in and saving energy, you may want to skip this 
chapter. But if you truly want to do the best you can, you need to understand 
a few basic ideas. When it comes to energy, it’s important to know the cur-
rency as much as how to spend it.
In this chapter, I present data on where energy comes from, and how and 
where it’s used on both a national and household level. Understanding the 
course that energy follows puts you in a better position to make good deci-
sions on how to increase your own efficiencies. I present data on the typical 
household energy use in North America so that you can compare your own 
usage to see how it stacks up. (In Chapter 3, I get into a lot of detail on this 
subject, but I give you a rough idea here). I also discuss a number of ways 
that your own energy usage varies depending on where you live and what 
kind of home you occupy.

Energizing North America
A variety of energy sources are used in North America. You’ve probably 
already heard of many of them; others may be unfamiliar. The most common 
energy sources are
 
 Petroleum products: Petroleum products, which account for 39 percent 
of all the energy used in North America, are gasoline, propane and heat-
ing oil.
 
 Natural gas: Natural gas is drilled from beneath the surface of the earth, 
just like petroleum, but it comes in gaseous form instead of liquid or 
solid, and it makes up 24 percent of total energy consumption. It burns 
cleaner than petroleum products and coal, and is generally favored by 
environmentalists. Transport is problematic; so is storage.
 
 Coal: Coal is mined from the ground and comes in a solid, blackish, oily 
form that’s easy to burn but very difficult to burn cleanly. Coal is the 
most common form of energy in North America because there’s so much 
of it, and compared to petroleum, it’s easy to extract from the ground. 
Around 23 percent of residential and commercial energy consumption is 
provided by coal.
 
 Nuclear: The same atom-splitting physics that provides us those won-
derful nuclear weapons is used to heat water, which is then used to turn 
large electrical generating turbines. Nuclear energy is controversial, as 
the waste products are very difficult to deal with. But nuclear is coming 
back into favor because it doesn’t generate the carbon pollution blamed 
for global warming and other problems. Nuclear only comprises 8 per-
cent of North American energy consumption. Look for this percentage to 
increase dramatically in the next couple decades.
 
 Hydropower (dams): Tremendous water pressure is built up at the 
bottom of large dams built on riverways, and this pressure is harnessed 
to turn turbines that generate electricity. The power is very clean, but 
the problem is that the river’s ecosystem is affected. Salmon runs are 
obliterated, and the natural beauty of the river is permanently altered, 
almost always for the worst (unless you like to water ski). Hydropower 
accounts for 3 percent of North American energy consumption, particu-
larly in the American Pacific Northwest.
 
 Biomass (firewood and other stuff): Leaves falling from the trees in 
autumn are biomass, so are cow manure, horse manure, hay, weeds, 
corn husks, and so on. Firewood is the most common form of biomass 
used for energy. Total biomass energy production accounts for only 3 
percent of North American energy usage. Because of its wide availabil-
ity, biomass is seen as an excellent sustainable energy source.

19
 Chapter 2: Energy Sources and Sinks
 
 Geothermal: The air you breathe and the ground beneath your feet 
provide the source for geothermal energy. The physics is complicated, 
but suffice to say that you can generate heating and cooling by using 
heat exchange mechanisms that move temperature differences from one 
place to another. If you want heat in your home, you take some from 
the air or the ground. Geothermal energy provides 0.3 percent of North 
American energy needs.
 
 Wind: Traditionally windmills have been used to pump water from the 
ground (you see them on old western movies at nearly every ranch and 
nearly every poster from Holland), but modern embodiments produce 
electrical power as well. Wind power is a form of solar power because 
wind is caused by thermal temperature differences between regions of 
the globe. Wind power only provides 0.11 percent of energy needs, but 
this is changing fast since wind is a very clean source. The problems are 
that windmills are unsightly, and they make noise. They also may kill 
wildlife, particularly birds.
 
 Import electricity: Our electrical grid is an extensive matrix of intercon-
nected power wires that span borders. North America imports from 
nearby countries around 0.1 percent of its energy needs.
 
 Solar: The sun radiates a tremendous amount of energy — 37,000 
times as much energy as humans use — onto the surface of the earth, 
pollution free. Unfortunately, tapping into this energy isn’t simple. 
Nevertheless, people have figured out ways to use solar energy to 
heat water and to produce electricity. There is a tremendous push 
to increase solar production, and many governments are subsidizing 
solar equipment in both residential and commercial settings. Right now 
solar power accounts for only 0.06 percent of energy production (if you 
don’t include all the natural light and heat the sun produces), but that’s 
changing fast.
A word about global warming
I don’t take a position on global warming one 
way or another in this book. My opinion is that 
it’s not really relevant in encouraging people 
to conserve and practice efficiency. The fact 
is, we use too many resources, and in the pro-
cess we end up altering the planet in material 
ways that will affect future generations in one 
manner or another. Global warming is just one 
way that we might be affecting the planet, and 
in my view the overwhelming attention placed 
on this one aspect of our environmental defa-
mation does a disservice to the other aspects, 
and the overall balance and harmony that we 
should be striving for. What if it turns out that 
there is no global warming? Should we then go 
right back to the old days of unlimited exploita-
tion of resources? Of course not.

20
Part I: Solving the World’s Problems from Your Front Porch 
The majority of our energy sources produce power through combustion 
processes (burning) that require a burning chamber, oxygen, and exhaus-
tion capacities. From time immemorial, humans have burned wood for fires, 
and the process was simple; pile some wood, light it, hang around close to it. 
Modern combustion processes are engineered to be more efficient (modern 
wood burning stoves are around 100 times more efficient than open fires, for 
example), but the combustion processes, regardless of how efficient they are, 
are notorious pollution sources.
Non-combustion processes, such as solar power and nuclear, don’t exhaust 
pollutants the same way that combustion processes do, but they have their 
own problems. For instance, solar photovoltaic (PV) panels require a lot of 
energy to manufacture, and most of this energy comes from electrical power 
which itself often comes from coal and combustion. So while solar is pollu-
tion free in its implementation, it entails a lot of pollution in its manufacture.
The point is there is no such thing as a free lunch. Every energy source 
has pros and cons, and trying to decide how best to provide the power an 
economy needs is a complex problem. Many believe that the current energy 
predicament will be solved when we wean ourselves away from petroleum 
consumption, but even as people develop new alternative sources, the prob-
lems don’t go away; they simply change in nature.
Energy use around the world
To put the energy consumption of the United 
States in perspective, take a look at how much 
energy is used (per capita) in different countries 
around the world:
Country 
Btu per person 
 
per year
Canada 
418
United States 
339
Western Europe 
149
Japan 
172
China 
 33
Canada is cold, so its citizens require a lot of 
heat. But their high consumption also reflects 
the fact that energy is relatively inexpensive 
in Canada. When this is the case, regardless 
of where in the world it may be, there is little 
incentive to conserve or practice efficiency.
What’s more interesting is to compare American 
consumption with that of Western Europe. It 
would be very difficult to argue, as one can do 
when comparing the United States to China, 
that the large difference reflects quality of life-
style. Western Europeans, in many ways, enjoy 
better lifestyles than Americans. So why is 
their per capita consumption so low? Because 
they’ve been inculcated by high energy prices 
for so long that energy conservation and effi-
ciency are ingrained into the very fabric of their 
societies.

 Chapter 2: Energy Sources and Sinks
Looking at Energy Costs: Raw and Otherwise
Not all energy costs the same. Some types of energy are more expensive than 
others. How costly an energy source is depends on what it takes to deliver 
the energy to your home (raw energy costs) and what it takes to convert the 
raw energy into fuel you can use (conversion costs). By understanding where 
a particular energy source falls on the cheap-to-dear scale in both of these 
areas, you can gain a better understanding of how you can plan and control 
your energy usage to attain better efficiency.
Recognizing raw energy costs
Taking a look at the relative costs of different types of raw energy is illumi-
nating. (By raw, I mean the cost at delivery to your home; this doesn’t take 
into account how you may actually use the energy within your home, or 
how much the equipment costs to convert the raw energy into usable form). 
Relatively speaking, electricity is the most costly, nuclear energy is the 
cheapest, and a bunch of other types of energy fall somewhere in between 
(see Table 2-1).

Btu stands for British thermal unit, a standard unit of energy equal to 754 
kWh, or kilowatt hours (one thousand watt hours). To put this into perspec-
tive, a typical incandescent light bulb consumes around 75 watts, and so in 
a ten-hour evening consumes 750 Wh. Typically, large appliances like heat-
ers and air-conditioners are rated in Btu, while smaller devices are rated in 
watts. No technical abracadabra here, just tradition.

22
Part I: Solving the World’s Problems from Your Front Porch 
As Table 2-1 shows, electricity is by far the costliest energy source. This is 
because the power transmission grid, the huge matrix of power wires and 
transformers used to get the power from the utility generators to your home, 
is so big and unwieldy. Think of it this way: When you generate solar power 
on your roof, it’s created and used within a space of a hundred feet, maybe 
less. But when you use electricity from the grid, the production chain begins 
in a coal mine, then the coal must be transported to a power plant, and then 
power is generated in huge, expensive machines. This electrical power gets 
transmitted over long lengths of wire until it finally reaches your home. 
Several companies are involved — a coal mining company, a transport com-
pany, and a utility company with linesmen, managers, secretaries, lobbyists, 
and lawyers — not to mention that a whole host of governmental regulations 
have to be met, and taxes and tariffs need to be paid.
Even though electricity is the most expensive, it’s used almost exclusively 
in a majority of homes. Why? Because it’s the most convenient way to use 
power. All you have to do is plug in to a wall socket and voilà! You don’t 
need a storage tank (like you do with propane or fuel oil), and you don’t have 
to worry about the danger of explosions or flames (although you can get a 
shock without even trying too hard). You don’t need to go into the woods 
with a chainsaw and cut it down, and you don’t need to stack it on the side of 
your house and keep the spiders out of it. Best of all, the utility company is 
responsible for maintaining a continual flow into your home.
Looking at actual energy costs
Raw energy cost, explained in the preceding section, is only part of the pic-
ture. Most energy sources need to be burned or combusted on-site in order 
to extract their potential energy. Some conversion methods are more efficient 
than others. The list in Table 2-2 shows the same fuels as those listed in Table 
2-1, but this time with all the various production factors that come into play.
The link between coal and electricity
Due to its high carbon and sulfur content, burn-
ing coal is extremely dirty. Coal byproducts are 
the leading contributor to global warming (nearly 
1 billion tons of carbon dioxide are produced 
each year in the United States alone; China has 
surpassed this). Mercury is another byproduct; 
it pollutes air, land, and water. Because about 
90 percent of the coal produced in this coun-
try is used to produce over 50 percent of our 
electricity, electrical power is generally a very 
polluting source of energy. Reducing electri-
cal usage is always a good idea, especially if 
you’re concerned about pollution and global 
warming.

Using It Up: Where Energy Goes
Different sources of energy may be used to provide different functions within 
a single home — for example, natural gas may be used for heating, electric-
ity provides energy for lighting and the appliances, and fireplace wood pro-
vides supplemental heating. So how does a typical North American home use 
energy? The following table shows you. (Note: These percentages are aver-
aged over the course of a year; month-to-month breakdowns vary quite a bit.)

Of course this breakdown varies widely from home to home and region to 
region. For a clearer picture of how your own home uses energy, you can 
adapt these percentages to your specific scenario. Here are some things to 
consider:
 
 If you’re in a hot climate, you spend a lot more on cooling than heating. 
If you’re in a cold climate, you spend a lot more on heating than cool-
ing. In Chapter 3, I show you ways to calculate your heating and cooling 
costs in detail, and I give you some pointers on how to do something 
about those costs in Chapter 8.
 
 The most productive way to improve household efficiency usually is to 
consider your heating and cooling systems first and foremost. If heating 
is your greatest expense, you can save the most money by reducing your 
heating bill. Then you want to take a look at how you use hot water, and 
so on down the line. Another factor to consider is how much equipment 
costs. In a home, HVAC equipment is usually the most expensive, closely 
followed by major appliances like washers, dryers, and refrigerators. In 
making decisions on how to become more efficient, both the cost of the 
energy being consumed and the cost of the equipment come into play. 
Head to the section “Turning Your Eye to Improved Energy Efficiency” 
for advice on how to approach this topic.
 
 If you’re in a moderate climate, you may not spend anywhere near as 
much on heating or cooling as somebody in Illinois, where the weather 
tends to all extremes. Your month-to-month fluctuations also vary less.
 
 If you have a well for water, you need to include that category in the 
list and figure the percentage based on how much water you use. Small 
working ranches with electrically pumped wells may spend up to 20 per-
cent of their utility bill on pumping.
 
 If you use a wood stove and chop the wood yourself, your energy use 
percentages may be close to those in the preceding chart, but your 
costs will be skewed because you’re not paying for your heat at all.
 
 If you’re in an apartment, with common walls, your heating and cooling 
percentages will be lower because there will be less loss. If your neigh-
bors set their thermostat high and you set yours low, you’re essentially 
using their heat because it migrates into your apartment.
 
 If you don’t have an air-conditioner, your cooling costs will be zero, or 
minimal if you use fans.
 
 If you take a lot of hot showers, your water heating percentage will be 
higher; take fewer (or cold) showers, and it will be lower.

25
 Chapter 2: Energy Sources and Sinks
 
 If you use energy to charge a golf cart, power a motor home sitting in 
your driveway, or power a workshop with heavy-duty tools, adjust your 
figures accordingly. These types of things take a lot of energy and may 
overshadow even the heating component.
 
 If you never open a single window in your home and your HVAC is on all 
the time, even when the weather is nice, heating and cooling will com-
prise a larger percentage of the total.
 
 If you rarely use your HVAC at all, instead favoring thick sweaters in the 
winter and a lot of sweating in the summer, your heating and cooling will 
comprise a smaller percentage of the total.
Turning Your Eye to Improved Energy 
Efficiency
The preceding sections are devoted to background information, but this 
book is about achieving tangible results. In this section, I present some gen-
eralities that you should keep in mind — like how to reduce the amount of 
electricity you use, how to maximize your sustainable energy sources, and 
more — regardless of the details of your energy efficiency program.
The big Kahuna: Electrical energy
As stated earlier, a typical household uses more than one energy source. Of 
all the energy sources folks use in their homes, however, electrical energy is 
the most widely used, as well as the most convenient. And that’s why it’s the 
most important to think about when you think about energy efficiency.
Electrical energy holds the most potential for efficiency improvements 
because the methods of making improvements are the most easily accessible 
and understood.
Where electricity comes from
Ben Franklin and his kite experiment aside, electrical energy doesn’t just 
drop from the sky. It’s generated through processes powered by other 
energy sources. For instance, coal is burned and water is boiled and the pres-
sure is used to turn huge turbines that generate electrical power. In North 
America, electrical energy comes from these sources:

The problems with electrical energy
Although electricity is typically considered clean and environmentally 
friendly, it is often generated through processes that rely on “dirty” energy 
sources. Even those processes that use renewable energy sources have their 
own problems. Bottom line: Electrical energy is subject to many common 
inefficiencies and problems. Here are some of the biggest ones:
 
 Electrical energy, while clean once it reaches your home, has most likely 
been generated by a combustion process, so don’t kid yourself into 
thinking that electricity is environmentally benign. Many people believe 
that electrical cars that you charge up at home are the key to a green 
future, but if you consider just how inefficient the electrical system is, 
and how most electricity is generated by coal-fired plants, you come to a 
different conclusion.
 
 In the process of generating and using electricity, a lot of hot water is 
discharged — first into the river system and then into the ocean. This 
affects the ecosystem. For instance, some biological lifeforms require 
very specific water temperatures for breeding purposes; by warming the 
average river temperature, these species die out.
 
 Wind generators cover open hillsides with noisy, ugly windmills. Birds 
and bats get killed, sometimes in large numbers. Compared to the alter-
natives, though, windmills are practically pristine.
 
 Hydroelectric generators dam up rivers and affect such diverse phenom-
ena as salmon runs and the plants and animals that live along the river-
side. Dams also create a lot of underwater decay in the upper reservoirs 
that doesn’t exist when water runs naturally; this decay releases carbon 
dioxide into the atmosphere, and we all know what that means (global 
warming).
 
 Geothermal wells release arsenic into the environment.
 
 Power lines emit radiation, heat the air, buzz, and catch birds and 
planes. Their potential for danger is even greater when they’re downed.
 
 Nuclear power plants produce horrendous wastes, and people have yet 
to figure out a good way to get rid of these byproducts.

27
 Chapter 2: Energy Sources and Sinks
Renewable and sustainable energy sources
The words renewable and sustainable are being knocked around quite a bit. 
Both are inherently associated with energy conservation:
 
 Renewable forms of energy constantly replenish themselves with little 
or no human effort. Solar energy is just one example — no matter how 
much you use, the supply will never end (okay, it may end after bil-
lions of years, but your using solar power won’t make the sun burn out 
any faster). Other examples of renewables include firewood, water (via 
hydroelectric dams), and wind power.
 
 The term renewable does not necessarily imply good environmentalism. 
Firewood, a renewable energy source, is notoriously polluting, and it 
has another potentially severe drawback: People go out into forests and 
cut down trees, often without much thought to the overall health of the 
forest (a good example of not seeing the forest for the trees).
 
 Sustainable forms of energy are not only renewable, but they also have 
the ability to keep the Earth’s ecosystem up and running in perpetuity. The 
basic notion behind sustainable energy sources is that by their use, society 
is not compromising future generations’ health and well-being, or their abil-
ity to use their own sustainable resources to the same extent that we do 
now. Who can argue with this very fundamental version of the Golden Rule?
To make sure that resources last, humans need to focus on renewable and 
sustainable energy sources. Energy sources that fail to meet these criteria 
could eventually be depleted and thus cease to exist.
Invested energy and recycling
Invested energy is the energy that’s used to manufacture a product (in the lit-
erature, you may see this referred to as embodied energy, but it means essen-
tially the same thing). Take solar panels, for example. When solar energy was 
first conceived back in the 1960s as part of the space program, a solar panel 
took over three times more energy to produce than it would ever generate 
in its lifetime. Bad economics, but satellites need energy sources, and solar 
panels are the only practical source. Nowadays panels are far better, and the 
disparity between the energy invested to make solar panels and the energy 
that the solar panels generate no longer exists.
If you’re truly interested in reducing your energy consumption, you need to 
consider invested energy when choosing products. Unfortunately, because 
the concept of invested energy has just begun to take root, the information 
is not widely available (although an entire industry is dedicated to meeting 
the burgeoning demand of “green” customers who want this information). In 
the future it will be more and more common for products to list their total 
invested energies alongside the current energy efficiency information.

28
Part I: Solving the World’s Problems from Your Front Porch 
 
If you’re intent on finding out invested energy levels, contact manufacturers 
and be prepared to exhibit robust patience. In many cases, manufacturers 
haven’t even considered invested energy and won’t even know how to answer 
your query. The best bet is to patronize manufacturers that publish their num-
bers, for these will most likely be the ones trying to minimize those numbers.
 
The point is, everything takes energy to manufacture, and when considering 
how much energy is used in your household, you need to consider invested 
energy as well as the energy you gobble up in your home.
In fact, invested energy is a big force in favor of recycling. From an economic 
standpoint, recycling may not seem like such a great idea. It takes time on 
your part and requires you to set up systems and stick with them. But you’re 
not just saving money when you recycle; you’re saving invested energy, and 
all the pollution and environmental costs that go with it.
Green homes are becoming more common, and one of the more important 
aspects of choosing materials is invested energy. Although recycled prod-
ucts are popular, new materials that may cost a little more but use far less 
energy to produce and bring to the building site are also a good choice.
Musing over manpower
Some people have asked me about connecting 
a turbine to their exercise equipment so that 
they can turn their efforts into usable household 
energy. It’s not worth it — not by a long shot. If 
you’re watching a TV while you’re working out, 
the TV is probably consuming more power than 
you’re generating.
A male human being, in good condition, can 
generate only 200 watts of power. One horse-
power is equal to 746 watts, so it would take 
around four strong men to equal the power of 
a single horse. It would take one physically fit 
man five hours on a treadmill to generate 1 kilo-
watt-hour, which is the same amount of energy 
the sun radiates onto a one square meter area 
in only one hour. 
Humans may not be able to generate enough 
power to produce the amount of energy that 
U.S. society is accustomed to, but that’s not to 
say that man is powerless to make a difference. 
Here’s some food for thought: Think of how 
much more energy the average American uses 
than do those in countries where electricity is 
common and people make do without it. Our 
lives here in North America are surely much 
easier. But is the difference in the quality of our 
lives equal to the difference in the amount of 
energy we consume? Personally, I think not.
In fact, one could make a compelling argument 
in the other direction. Complexity is inefficient, 
and not just physically. Complexity inhibits aes-
thetic harmony, which may be the real reason 
for living. How many of you would like to trade 
in your hyper-driven lifestyles for something 
simpler? In this book, I help you simplify.

f you want to improve the energy efficiency of your home in an efficient 
manner, you need to first understand the economics of your overall con-
sumption. When you make investments in either time or money, they should 
be focused and deliberate in order to ensure good payback (I get into pay-
back in Chapter 5). Unfortunately, most people don’t have a good handle on 
the specifics of how and where they’re using energy and other resources in 
their homes. As the saying goes, “The devil is in the details.” In this chapter, 
I present a detailed system for analyzing your resource use (I leave the devil 
out of it, however).
Getting a Handle on Your Energy Usage
The ultimate goal is to deduce how much you’re paying for different sources 
of energy and then tackle those costs based on what your main objective 
is. For example, your primary goal may be cost reduction as you strive for 
efficiencies, or your main objective may be pollution mitigation or energy 
conservation. In any case, you need to first consider the total resource con-
sumption in your home.

Energy use in a typical North 
American home
Looking at nationwide statistics gives you a baseline to which you can com-
pare your energy usage. Does your own usage make sense, or can you make 
easy changes? Do you need to simply change your habits, or are you going to 
have to invest time and money in equipment improvements? Table 3-1 shows 
how a typical North American home uses energy (averaged over the course 
of a year). For the purposes of this data, a typical home has 1,600 square feet, 
two baths, three bedrooms, and 2.3 occupants in a region with moderate 
weather patterns.

These values represent total energy used, not how much that energy costs. 
The cost of different energy sources varies widely. For instance, if you heat 
your home by chopping wood yourself and burning it in a wood stove, your 
heating costs may be near zero, but that obviously doesn’t mean you are con-
suming zero energy to heat your home. If you have a solar water heater on 
your roof, your water heating cost may be zero, but 21 percent of your energy 
consumption can still be attributed to heating water. The cost of equipment 
also factors into the equation. For instance, you had to buy that solar heater, 
and that’s not cheap. Refer to Chapter 2 for details on the costs associated 
with different types of energy.

 Chapter 3: Eliminating the Guesswork with Home Energy Audits
Focusing on your own home-sweet-home
Obviously, if you don’t fit the typical profile described in the preceding section, 
your energy consumption will be different. To a large degree, personal lifestyle 
dictates energy consumption. If you’re gone all day and the home is empty, for 
example, you can lower your thermostat and save. If you’re diligent about turn-
ing off unused lights, your lighting component will be less. If you tolerate heat 
and cold better than most, you can save on heating and cooling. And so on.
As you evaluate how your home varies from the typical energy consumption 
numbers, spend some time going around your house, looking at all the 
different ways you consume energy and resources. Just by paying more 
attention, you can learn a lot.
Where you live and the type of house you live in
Where you live has a big impact on how much energy you use. Folks sweating 
through summers in the sunny Southwest don’t have the same heating and 
cooling needs as those shivering through winters in the Upper Peninsula of 
Michigan. If you’re in a hot climate, you may need very little heat, but your 
cooling bill is higher. If you’re in Alaska, your heating bill is much higher.
Different home styles — whether you live in an apartment, a house, or a 
condo, for example — also make a difference. Apartments and many condos 
have common walls, and the heat and cooling losses are less. Homes with a 
lot of windows have poorer insulation, while those that are surrounded by 
trees and natural windbreaks suffer less heat loss. And so on.
The type of HVAC you have
HVAC stands for heating, ventilation and air conditioning. Most homes have 
forced air systems, which means ducts and fans push air through the home. 
Some homes have radiant heat, and many homes have wood stoves or other 
combustion appliances. Heating is the biggest single component of the utility 
budget in most homes, and it’s subject to the most variation in energy 
consumption. Thus, it pays to know as much as you can about your home’s 
heating resources. Ask yourself these questions:
 
 What kind of heating source(s) do you use? A wood-burning stove, gas 
fireplace, electric heat pump, baseboard heater, free-standing heater, radi-
ator, and so on? Figure out how much you spend on each source of heat.
 
 How old is your system, and what’s its expected lifetime? In general, the 
older the system, the less efficient it is — not because old technology is 
inferior, but because back in the day, people didn’t worry about energy 
efficiency as much as we do now, and paying more for an efficient system 
just wasn’t worth it.

32
Part I: Solving the World’s Problems from Your Front Porch 
 
 Do you have a central air conditioner or window units? Do you use 
fans, an evaporative cooler, dehumidifiers, and so on? Include them in 
your assessment of your energy consumption.
 
As you think about your own energy consumption, look at your neighbors and 
see how their consumption differs from yours. What is the most popular HVAC 
system in your area, for example, and what are new homes in your area being 
equipped with? The answers to these types of questions can give you valuable 
information about the kind of technologies that work best in your region. Heat 
pumps, for example, work well in moderate climates but not in extremely cold 
climates. If nobody in your area uses a heat pump, there’s probably a good 
reason. And if everybody is burning wood in a stove, it’s probably because the 
availability and cost of wood is advantageous.
The people who live in your home
Heating and cooling don’t depend on how large your family is, but on the ways 
that people in your family use energy. You may have to turn the thermostat 
lower in the summer and higher in the winter because of personal preference 
and potential health issues. If a member of your family has special needs, such 
as air filtration for asthma, you should factor that in. If your family is very sen-
sitive to exposure to contaminants, you’re probably paying more for filters and 
cleaning services.
Your water usage
Where do you get your water from and how much do you use? If a well 
supplies your water, your electric bill will be larger, but your water bill will 
be nonexistent. If you take long, hot showers or if your family is large, your 
water heating component will be higher. If you have a solar water heater, this 
component may be costing you next to nothing on a monthly basis. And if 
you have kids, as any parent can tell you, you probably wash a lot of clothes.
The type of amenities you have
Be sure not to leave life’s little extras off your radar as you scope out things 
that consume energy around your home. For example, do you have a 
swimming pool or spa? Pool pumps consume a lot of electricity, especially 
in the summer. Spas consume a lot of power, especially in the winter. What 
about a massive home entertainment center? These can easily consume 
more energy than an old refrigerator, which is about the most inefficient 
appliance ever made. And if you’re charging a golf cart or powering a motor 
home in your driveway, keep in mind that they take a lot of power, too. 
Room full of aquariums? Giant gym? You get the point.
Special situations
If you’re running a business in your home, your lighting, heating, and cool-
ing costs will be higher. Your power bill may also be higher if you’re running 
heavy equipment.

33
 Chapter 3: Eliminating the Guesswork with Home Energy Audits
Other things to think about
Many people who want to become more energy efficient do it for two 
reasons: to save money and to save the planet. If you’re one of the many 
people interested in polluting less, add the following to your list of possible 
areas for improvement:
 
 What kind of garbage service do you have? Are there alternatives? 
Does your trash collection agency offer recycling, for example, and if so, 
what kind of recycling? You can call the customer service number for 
answers.
 
 Do you have sewer service or are you using a septic tank? If you’re 
using a septic tank, how old is it and how long has it been since it was 
serviced? If you don’t stay on top of your septic system, you may incur 
extra costs when problems arise.
 
 How much carbon and other pollutions are you producing in the 
process of consuming energy in your home? If you have a cheap wood 
stove, your cost may be very low (if you cut your own wood), but your 
carbon footprint astronomical. Is this important to you? (See the 
section “Calculating Your Own Carbon Footprint,” later in this chapter, 
for details on how to do this.)
 
Do you have equipment that you know is going to need replacement? Are you 
paying a lot of repair bills for a particular piece of equipment? Would you like 
to invest in improvement? Check to see whether government agencies in your 
area are offering subsidies for certain types of equipment. Your utility may 
offer subsidies, too. See Chapter 4 for more details.
Paying Up: The Various Rate Structures
To figure out what you spend on energy consumption, you need to know not 
only how much energy you use, but how you pay. Find out the answers to 
these questions:
 
 What, if any, utilities are bundled together? Are you charged separately 
for your sewer and the water you use, for example, or is your sewage bill 
part of your water bill?
 
 Do you pay flat rates for your utilities or are they metered? Municipalities 
that don’t use meters have very high rates of consumption, and some are 
experiencing political pressure to change to meters. If you’re on a flat rate 
for water or electricity, is your municipality one that’s considering the 
change to meters? If so, try to anticipate how such a change may affect 
what you pay. If you’re frugal (which you probably are because you’re 
reading this book), you could end up paying less with a meter.

34
Part I: Solving the World’s Problems from Your Front Porch 
 
 When do you pay each of your utility bills? Most likely you write a 
monthly check, but you may be on a different program. If you use 
propane or oil, do you pay each time the tank is filled? How often is this, 
and what are the annual and seasonal totals? Most trash bills are fixed 
monthly, but you may have another structure.
 
 Have unit costs changed over the last few years for each of your 
resources? What’s the trend? (Natural gas fluctuates a lot in price, 
whereas solar never varies.) Ask yourself what you expect prices to do in 
the future, and evaluate how this would affect your household economy.
This type of information is important because you can find ways to save 
money by simply changing a habit or two. For instance, if you’re on a TOU 
(time of use) rate structure, you can take showers in the morning or evening 
instead of the afternoon, when rates are at their peak.
Utilities charge you in a wide range of ways, particularly for electric service. 
You should study your utility bills and determine which structures you’re 
operating under. The answer makes a big difference in terms of how you can 
best invest your money and time to make your home more efficient. The 
following sections outline the main rate structure options.
 
Averaging, or amortizing, is common on power bills and sometimes on water 
bills. It’s a way the utility company allows you to even out the severe ups and 
downs in your bill. Some utilities average by simply reading your meter every 
three or four months and then charging you proportionally for those months. 
Another way is to average over an entire year, say the previous year’s 
consumption, and charge you the same amount for all 12 months. At the end 
of the year, you’re charged for any net surplus or shortage, and that amount 
gets amortized into the next year’s billing.
Simple rate structure
Under a simple rate structure, the same rate applies to every unit of energy 
you use, regardless of the amount of energy you use, when you use it, or any 
other factor. This type of rate structure is rare because it doesn’t discourage 
overconsumption. If your bill simply lists a single price for electricity, this is 
the type of structure you are on.
Tiered structure
A tiered structure is the most common. For example, an electric utility may 
charge 15 cents each for the first 300 kWh of electric energy you use in a 
given month. The next 300 kWh may cost 30 cents each. The next 300 kWh 
cost 45 cents each, and so on. By its progressively penal nature, this 
structure encourages efficiency and conservation.

35
 Chapter 3: Eliminating the Guesswork with Home Energy Audits
Time of use (TOU) structure
A time of use (TOU) structure charges depending on what time of day you use 
power (it requires a special meter with a clock function). The most difficult time 
for a utility to provide its customers with all the power they need is in the after-
noon, when businesses are using the greatest amount of power. Utilities often 
have to buy power from other utilities in order to meet this peak demand, and 
this costs the utilities quite a bit more than the power they generate themselves. 
So they charge you more for it — usually a lot more. Generally, prices are at their 
highest between noon and 6 p.m. (referred to as peak time), although the hours 
may vary. This is a difficult rate schedule to work with if you need a lot of air 
conditioning in the summer, because it’s during this peak time that you want 
your air conditioner on.
 
You probably won’t be able to ascertain whether you’re on this schedule by 
looking at a single power bill because seasonal variations in pricing are very 
common. You need to look at a power bill from the winter and compare it to 
one from the summer (summer is almost always more expensive, because of 
air-conditioning issues). Summer rates generally start in May and go through 
September or October.
Combination structures
Combination structures are the most common. In Northern California where 
I live, we have tiered, TOU, seasonal rate structures. Very difficult to under-
stand, and it doesn’t help that most utility bills are virtually indecipherable. 
Your best bet is to take it one piece at a time. Understand the tiered nature 
on its own merits, then tackle the TOU structure, and so on. You can also call 
the customer service number and talk to a representative; in my experience, 
these people are very good, and patient, in explaining the details.
Figuring Out What You Spend
The best way to figure out what you spend — and where you potentially can 
cut back — is to dissect your utility bills. By doing this, you get good data on 
specifically where to look for the most rewarding investments in efficiency. 
This is basically a three-step process: Gather all your data, plot it month by 
month, and then analyze your results. The following sections give you the 
details.

36
Part I: Solving the World’s Problems from Your Front Porch 
Collecting the data
The first thing you need to do is collect a stack of utility bills. If you don’t 
already have them, call your utility companies (customer-service numbers 
are always listed on the bills) and have them send you copies of your bills for 
the past few years. Most utilities don’t charge for this service, and some even 
do data analysis for you (they graph the data, which is much nicer than a 
load of raw numbers; ask when you call). They may even offer other services, 
like a free home energy audit.
In addition to your utility bills (water, electric, gas, trash, and sewer), you 
need to compile a list of all the expenses associated with the resources you 
use. Here’s a sampling of what you need, but you may have other items not 
on this list:
 
 Trash runs to the dump: If you take trash to the dump yourself, estimate 
the cost by including everything: gasoline for your truck, other transport 
expenses, costs at the landfill, and so on.
 
 Manufactured logs: If you use manufactured logs, you don’t need to 
come up with receipts; just estimate how many you use and how much 
they cost. Transport and storage may also be significant.
 
 Power generator: If you bought one, how much did it cost? If you rent 
one, include the rental cost. Also include the cost of the gasoline you 
use to run it.
 
 Firewood: If you use firewood, include costs for the chainsaw, saw 
blades, transportation for firewood, and rental (or purchase price) of a 
wood splitter. And if you broke your arm while cutting firewood, include 
the associated medical expenses, too.
 
 Wood pellets and bio-energy products of any kind: Include all costs 
associated with these.
 
 Propane or natural gas: If you use either of these, include not only the 
cost of the product, but also rental agreements, maintenance, and so on. 
A lot of people pay a yearly rental for their propane tank.
 
 Barbecue grill: Calculate how much you spend for charcoal, the pro-
pane, and the tanks. How much did the grill itself cost?
 
 Lawn tools: Include any gasoline you buy for them, as well as the gas 
canister if you bought one. If you buy gas (and/or a gas canister) for a 
generator, include those costs, too.
 
 Kerosene: If you use kerosene for lanterns, cooking, or heating, include 
those costs.
 
 Space heaters, portable air conditioners, dehumidifiers, swamp coolers, 
and so on: If you bought any of these, include how much they cost and 
estimate how much they cost to run. Check their labels for power 
consumption; then estimate how much time they’re on, and when.

37
 Chapter 3: Eliminating the Guesswork with Home Energy Audits
 
 Candles and light bulbs: If you use them, add them to your list.
 
 Batteries and chargers: Batteries can be very expensive, and most 
people don’t consider them a part of their power consumption, but they 
definitely are.
 
 Maintenance and repair costs: These apply to energy equipment, such 
as a woodstove, HVAC filters, appliances, and so on.
 
 New equipment: If you bought a new water heater, new HVAC, or 
anything else along these lines, add the replacement costs to your list, 
as well as any delivery and installation charges.
 
 Insulation: If you insulated your pipes, the cost is directly related to 
your energy consumption.
 
 Loans to buy energy-creating equipment: If you took out a loan to buy 
something like a generator or woodstove, be sure to include the interest 
on the loan as you calculate your energy costs.
 
 Permits, fees, and taxes: Some additions require permits; some up your 
taxes. You may have to obtain a county permit for installing a wood or 
gas stove, for example. Or you may pay higher property taxes because 
of a sunroom addition.
 
 Bottled water: If you drink it, estimate how much and the cost.
As you compile your list, you’re likely to find that you’re spending a lot more 
for resources than you thought, and you may be surprised by some of the 
details. You’re already moving forward!
Plotting the details, month by month
Ultimately, you need to do some month-by-month estimations. The power 
company bill is the easiest, along with water and trash. Here are some rules 
for allocating other resource costs by month:
 
 If you have a propane tank that’s filled periodically by the propane 
company, you’ll have a tough time figuring out the monthly usage. Just 
get the yearly total and divide that up on a monthly basis. If you only 
use the propane for heat, allocate the cost to those months when you 
use heat. If you use some for hot water and some for heat, divvy it up as 
best you can. Make sure the total is right.
 
 Ditto with firewood and all the associated expenses. Most people buy a 
big stack once a year. How much did you use each month? Divvy up the 
costs as best you can and make sure the total is right.
 
 Servicing for equipment should be allocated according to the use of 
that equipment. If you serviced a heater, allocate the cost only to those 
months when you use heat.

38
Part I: Solving the World’s Problems from Your Front Porch 
 
 Even if your water bill is fixed, estimate how much water you used on 
a monthly basis. If possible, you should try to divide your water usage 
according to the various functions for which you use it, such as sewer, 
laundry, dishwasher, and so on. Landscaping may be the biggest water 
consumer in your household, and this is important to know.
To determine monthly costs of a piece of equipment, follow these steps:
 
1. Determine what you paid.
 
 Example: A gas fireplace costs $4,000 plus tax, plus another $200 for 
permits and inspection. The total is $4,480.
 
2. Estimate how much that equipment increased the value of your home.
 
 A gas fireplace may increase the value by $2,500.
 
3. Subtract how much the equipment increased the value of your home 
from its total cost to get the net cost.
 
 Subtract $2,500 from $4,480. The net cost of the fireplace is $1,980.
 
4. Estimate the lifetime of the equipment, in months.
 
 The fireplace should be usable for ten years, or 120 months.
 
5. Calculate the monthly depreciation (loss of value) by dividing the net 
value by the number of months in the equipment’s lifetime.
 
 Divide $1,980 by 120. The fireplace costs $16.50 per month.
You can get fancy, if you want. Say the cost of the fireplace in the preceding 
example is better allocated to only the winter months. The cost would then 
be $33 over the six months from October through March.
 
You may want to plot several years’ worth of graphs to get a comprehensive 
idea of your energy consumption. Individual years may be subject to strange 
weather patterns or one-time-only events, like a big wedding or a lot of 
relatives visiting at Christmas. You also want to watch out for isolated events 
on your bills. If, for instance, one of your monthly statements includes a 
one-time deduction as a result of your electric company settling a lawsuit with 
energy providers who charged too much, you need to factor this sort of thing 
out because it has no bearing on your habits.

39
 Chapter 3: Eliminating the Guesswork with Home Energy Audits
Keeping Up With the Joneses: 
A Real-Life Scenario
The best way to illustrate how to put all your data together is to use Bill 
Toomuch as an example. Bill and his small family live on a five-acre ranch in 
California in a 2,700-square-foot house. With the exception of a small gas 
fireplace in their great room, all their energy comes from the electric 
company. They have an above-ground swimming pool and a hot tub. Water 
is supplied by a well. Analyzing Bill’s energy consumption demonstrates by 
example how to go about systematically analyzing your own situation.
Looking at Bill’s resource costs
Bill lists his resource costs as follows:
 
 Bill called PG&E and got four years’ worth of history, broken down by 
month. Figure 3-1 shows one of Bill’s typical electric utility bills. The bill is 
for the period from 1/12/2007 to 2/12/2007. The total for the bill is $403.30.
 
 Because they have a well, Bill doesn’t have a water bill, but the cost of 
his water supply shows up on his electric bill because the well is 
powered by an electric pump.
Big reasons for high energy bills
Do you have a really high bill? One that sticks 
out like a sore thumb? Here are the most likely 
reasons:
  The addition of occupants in your home
  The addition of appliances, like a freezer in 
the garage
  Faulty appliances
  High rates of outdoor air infiltration into 
your home (You may have a faulty weather 
seal on a door that needs fixing, or you may 
have a bad attic trap door.)
  The use of too much electrical resistance 
heating
  Hot water leaks
  Use of appliances with large motors (pumps, 
compressors, air conditioners)
  Seasonal appliances — electric blankets, 
a dehumidifier, lots of shop lighting, power 
tools
  An estimated bill or one that reflects a 
higher time period
  A wedding or a big party
  Uncle Bill’s motor home parked in the drive-
way

40
Part I: Solving the World’s Problems from Your Front Porch 
 
 The household fills a 64-gallon trash container every week. They also fill 
a 64-gallon container for recyclables every other week. Paper, 
cardboard, bottles, cans, and plastics are all placed into a single 
recycling bin. The cost is $32 per month.
 
 Bill uses three gallons of gasoline a month in lawn mowers, leaf blowers, 
and so on. That’s around $8 per month.
 
 Bill spends $15 per month in propane for a barbecue.
 
 The HVAC system broke down and cost $267 to fix, for a monthly total of 
$22.25.
 
 In the colder months, Bill burns liquid propane in the gas fireplace in the 
great room. His costs by month are

 Bill’s wife loves candles; they cost around $28 per month.
 
 Bill spends $23 per month in batteries for remotes, flashlights, sprinkler 
controllers, and so forth.
 
 The house is on a septic tank, so there is no sewer. Every three years 
the tank must be pumped out (yuck. . . ) at a cost of $300, which is $100 
per year, or $8 per month. Last year a repair was made (double yuck!) at 
a cost of $480, which is amortized over ten years at $48 per year.
Bill Toomuch has a tiered, seasonal rate structure. The baseline usage rate 
for the first 1,033 kWh is $0.11430. (I didn’t even know a thousandth of a 
penny existed.) For 101 to 130 percent of that baseline, the rate goes up to 
$0.12989, not much of an increase. For 131 to 200 percent of the baseline, 
usage costs $0.22944, and for 201 to 300 percent, the cost is $0.32146. This 
latter rate is nearly three times the base rate — quite a penalty! From a 
conservation standpoint, this means that if Bill can reduce his energy 
consumption by a few kWh, he’ll save 32 cents per kWh because the upper 
tiers will be erased from the bill first.

To get some meaning out of all this gobbledygook, Bill simply divides the 
total of his bill by the number of kWh used. The result: 17.5 cents per kWh. 
(Comparing this to some other parts of the country is instructive. In 
central Florida, the overall rate is around 11.6 cents per kWh. In Milwaukee 
it’s around 10.4 cents. As usual, California is leading the way into the future, 
which in this case is higher energy prices.)

a month. For all his energe needs, he spends about $604 a month, $361 of 
which is for electric only. 
Analyzing Bill’s energy costs
If you take a close look at Bill’s data, you’ll notice a few interesting — and 
enlightening — details:
 
 The heater is on a lot in the winter, and the air-conditioner is on a lot 
in the summer. The rates are higher in the summer than they are in the 
winter. Your data should look similar, unless you have unusual climate 
conditions. If you’re in a cold climate, the magnitudes of the data may be 
different, but the overall shape will be similar.

 Chapter 3: Eliminating the Guesswork with Home Energy Audits
 
 You can establish your baseline usage by looking at the months in which 
no heating or air-conditioning is used at all. April and October are the 
usual candidates. In the example, Bill’s approximate baseline electric 
usage is around 1,600 kWh. By subtracting each month’s total from the 
baseline, it’s possible to determine approximately how much Bill is 
spending on heating and air-conditioning:
Month

$368
Feb 
$345
Mar 
$183
Apr

$34
July 
$94
Aug 
$105
Sep

Oct

Nov

Dec 
$485
 
 The average American consumes around 20 kWh per day. Bill uses over 
three times that amount. His house is bigger, with a lot of extra goodies, 
but there still seems to be room for a lot of improvement.
 
 You can see how the kWh charge is higher in the summer on the sea-
sonal rate structure.
Calculating Your Own Carbon Footprint
In addition to auditing your personal costs, taking a look at how much 
pollution you’re generating in your home is worthwhile, particularly if your 
main goal is pollution efficiency. A very common term these days is carbon 
footprint, which just means how much carbon you’re emitting into the atmo-
sphere through your various energy consuming activities. Carbon (or more 
precisely, carbon dioxide) is important because it’s the main cause of global 
warming.
 
Here’s a fact of physics: When you consume energy, it doesn’t simply go away; 
rather, it changes into some other form. Burning gasoline creates carbon 
dioxide and a thousand other pollutants. The chemical and atomic bonds 
between the molecules and atoms in the gasoline are broken down, and heat 

44
Part I: Solving the World’s Problems from Your Front Porch 
is released in the process. To put things into perspective, consider that a 
gallon of gasoline weighs only 6 pounds, but in the process of burning it in 
your auto engine, 20 pounds of carbon dioxide is released. This is a higher 
weight than the original fuel because oxygen from the air is combined with 
the liquid gasoline in the auto’s carburetor. So the pollution that comes from 
burning gasoline weighs more than the original gasoline, and valuable oxygen 
is taken from the air and replaced with polluting CO2.
Table 3-3 lists how much carbon pollution is released into the atmosphere 
due to the consumption of common energy sources.

Greenhouse effect and global warming
The best way to understand the phenomenon 
of global warming is to consider your own car 
sitting in the hot sun. Window glass transmits 
sunlight so that it enters the interior of your 
car. The sunlight then hits the seats, the floor, 
and so on and is converted into heat. The heat 
begins to build up inside the car because the 
same window glass that let the sunlight into the 
car resists letting the heat back out. Windows 
are excellent transmitters of light, but very poor 
transmitters of heat (good insulators, in other 
words).
The earth’s atmosphere operates like a window. 
It lets in sunlight very nicely, but it also has 
insulation properties. When increased carbon 
dioxide is trapped in the atmosphere, sunlight 
transmission is basically unaffected, but the 
insulation properties are increased, so more 
heat is trapped. Hence, our planet is getting 
warmer for the same reason that your car gets 
warmer when it’s sitting in the sun. The phenom-
enon is called the greenhouse effect; it explains 
why greenhouses work so well in the winter-
time (and may get too hot in the summer).

45
 Chapter 3: Eliminating the Guesswork with Home Energy Audits
As you digest the info from Table 3-3, keep these points in mind:
 
 The amount of carbon pollution generated by the production of 
electricity varies quite a bit depending on the type of generators 
being used. States with nuclear power can generate as little as 0.03 
lb/kWh, while regions with coal plants may produce as much as 
2.24. The national average is 1.75.
 
 Wood that is left on the forest floor emits the same amount of CO2 as it 
rots away as it does when it’s burned, so whether burning wood is really 
polluting the atmosphere is an interesting question. The same cannot 
be said for the other combustion sources, because if they’re left alone, 
there is no pollution at all. (Of course, it should also be mentioned that if 
you’re out in the woods working your tail off, you’re a lot healthier than 
the average couch potato, and that has its advantages.)
Did you know that your home is probably emitting more CO2 than your car? 
Just because you can’t see it with your naked eye doesn’t mean it’s not there. 
Consider these tidbits:
 
 A typical midsized automobile that travels 12,000 miles annually emits 
around 13,000 pounds of CO2 per year.
 
 A typical home that uses 600 gallons of home heating oil emits around 
13,500 pounds of CO2 per year.
 
 A typical North American home consumes around 700 kWh per month in 
electricity, for an emission of 14,700 pounds of CO2 per year.
 
 If you burn a cord of firewood for heat, you’re emitting around 3,814 
pounds of CO2.
Auditing Your Home to Find 
Areas for Improvement
Once you’ve finished crunching the numbers, you’re ready for the next phase 
of your home audit. Now you need to go around and carefully inspect both 
the interior and exterior of your home and identify areas where you can make 
improvements. Most people find that a majority of improvements are simple 
and can be done by a do-it-yourselfer for less than a hundred dollars. Some 
projects, however, are big, and in Part II, I help you determine how to handle 
these.
An audit of your home helps you accomplish five key objectives, listed here 
in order of importance:

46
Part I: Solving the World’s Problems from Your Front Porch 
 
 Ensuring safety. Safety is the most important aspect of any home. If 
your home is not safe and free of contaminants, it doesn’t matter how 
efficient it is in other regards.
 
 Maximizing your house’s longevity and durability. The biggest 
detriment to a home’s lifetime is moisture problems, which only get 
worse when ignored.
 
 Enhancing your home’s livability. Air leaks affect both the livability of a 
home and the amount of energy it takes to heat and cool a home.
 
 Analyzing the costs and benefits of making improvements. The more 
you know, the better the decisions you make.
 
 Creating a game plan that enables you to make your home more 
efficient. Having a plan can save time and money and help you target 
the most important areas. 
 
If you have gas-burning equipment and, like most people, are not well-versed 
in the technology, hiring a professional auditor to inspect it is usually best. I 
do not give you instructions in this book on how to inspect or adjust gas-fired 
machinery because there are too many different kinds, and they’re too 
dangerous to be messing around with.
Grunting it out: The inspection
In this section, I explain how to systematically inspect your home. I get into a 
lot of detail in the bulk of this book on how to address problems when you find 
them. In this section, I just tell you where to look for problems. If you find one, 
look at the chapter that addresses that specific issue. For instance, if you find 
moisture under your washing machine, go to Chapter 11 on appliances. If you 
find an air leak, go to Chapter 7, which tells you how to seal your home.
So put on your grungiest clothes, because you’re going to be climbing around 
in your basement and attic. First up: Go around your home and carefully look 
at everything. You’ve probably glanced around before, but now you’re going 
to sharpen your focus. The following sections take you through the various 
areas of your home and explain what to pay attention to.
Foundation and structural elements
The place to begin your inspection is outside and beneath your home. 
Although you live inside, what happens outside is of critical importance:
 
 Look up into all your eaves. Are there vents? Are they dirty? Are there 
bug nests? Moisture damage (look for spots and mildew)? Is wood 
rotting anywhere? How’s the paint job?

47
 Chapter 3: Eliminating the Guesswork with Home Energy Audits
 
 Inspect the foundation. Are there openings or gaps? Why? Are the gaps 
sealed where pipes feed through? Are there vents? Are they dirty? Are 
there cracks in concrete or masonry walls? Are pads secure and dry?
 
 Underneath your house, look for moisture issues. Where is the water 
coming from? Why? Does it stink?
 
 If you have a basement, go down there and look for water leaks and air 
leaks. Check to see if the pipes are insulated. Check for signs of pesky 
little rodents.
 
 Check out your roof (be very careful; falling off the roof is more common 
than you may think). Is it leaking anywhere that you know of? What’s the 
condition? At what point are you going to have to get a new roof?
 
 On the outside of your house, inspect wherever two different types of build-
ing materials come together. Are these joints sealed? Is there leakage?
Attic
Checking for water leaks is your first order of business in the attic. Finding 
evidence of these may be difficult. If you do find evidence of a leak, you may 
have trouble tracing it up to the roof where it’s coming in, but it pays to try.
You also want to pay attention to the insulation in your attic. Are there 
gaps in it? Are there voids around ceiling light fixtures? Is there evidence of 
rodents or pests? Do you see a lot of spider webs? Are there vents to the out-
side world? Are they dirty so that air has a difficult time passing through?
Also check out your attic vent system (see Chapter 13 for more details).
Plumbing
If you can, make a sketch of your plumbing system, including both hot and 
cold water pipes. Where do they go? Where are the feed-throughs? After you 
complete this schematic, look at the following things:
 
 Are there any leaks? Are the hot water pipes covered with insulation? 
Are the pipes adequately tacked down, or are they flopping around? Is 
the system old? Rusty?
 
 Are there any dripping faucets? Check both inside and out. Do the 
faucets work the way they should?
 
 Check for clogged drains (especially in a basement floor; these are 
incredible sources of microbes).
 
 Are you aware of any plumbing problems? Toilets that don’t work the 
way they should? Shower drains that are too slow? Unpleasant odors in 
bathrooms, kitchens, laundry rooms, garages?
 
 Check under all your sinks for leaks. They’ll usually stink, and the particle-
board will be moldering and warped. Where’s the leak coming from? Maybe 
the disposal is leaking. You may have to turn the water on to find out.

48
Part I: Solving the World’s Problems from Your Front Porch 
Heating and cooling
Since heating and cooling costs are the biggest factor in most home’s energy 
use, it pays to check out heating and cooling systems on a periodic basis.
 
 Do certain parts of your house always seem too warm or too cold? Find out 
why; if you poke around, you may be able to unearth the cause. Is there a 
draft somewhere? If you have a difficult time, consult an HVAC professional.
 
 Is one heater vent always too hot compared to the others? Too cold? Check 
out the ductwork to find potential problems. In my experience, a majority 
of homes have gaps in the ductwork and don’t know it. These are easy and 
inexpensive to fix. (See Chapter 7 for instructions and suggestions.)
 
 To find leaks in a forced-air HVAC’s ductwork, turn your HVAC system 
on and get access to the ducts (this may be a real hassle in your attic or 
basement, requiring you to twist into odd pretzel shapes, but forge on for 
the good of humanity!). Dip your hand into a bowl of water (a wet hand 
makes air movement much easier to feel) and move your hand around 
the ducts, particularly where the joints are, and check for air leaks. Check 
where the ducts join up to the registers leading into your home.
Insulation
Can you find out what kind of insulation is in the walls and ceilings? How 
thick is it? You don’t need a numerical measurement, but you want to try to 
see whether it fills the voids. If you’re in an old house, you probably don’t 
have very good insulation. Also find out whether there’s insulation beneath 
your floors, particularly below the area where you spend the greatest amount 
of time (probably the family room).
Windows
Are your windows single-pane or double-pane? Do you have storm windows? 
Do you use them? Do you have blinds? Do you use them? How about solar 
screens for the summertime?
If you have a window that gets condensation between the two panes of glass, 
you have a leak in the seal. It won’t affect the window’s net insulation very 
much, but the windows will sooner or later become permanently obscured.
Filters
Check out all the filters in your home. Furnace filters are located at the 
input vent; you should replace these regularly. If you don’t, they’ll become 
extremely dirty. Exhaust fans sometimes have filters that you may not even 
know about. Look up inside; take off the cover cowling if you need to. Dryers 
have lint filters. Faucets have filters that regularly collect crud. If your faucet 
is squirting around erratically, change the filter.

49
 Chapter 3: Eliminating the Guesswork with Home Energy Audits
Other places to investigate
In addition to the obvious places to look, here are some more candidates.
 
 Check out your fireplace. Is the damper working properly? (It should 
move so that it opens and closes easily.) Have you been operating it 
properly? Are any seals old and frayed?
 
 Check out your fuse box. Do you have problems with blown fuses for 
which you can’t seem to identify a reason? Are wires frayed? Is the box 
covered well? Trace some wires and try to get the gist of the overall 
layout of your home’s electrical system.
 
 Check under all appliances and sinks for moisture. Where is it coming 
from?
 
 Go through your home and check out the wattage of each light bulb. 
Note what type of bulb each is. You can probably get by with a lot less 
wattage, and in a lot of spots you could change to a fluorescent (see 
Chapter 9 for more details).
 
 Look for air leaks. In Chapter 7, I describe a method for finding air leaks 
in your home.
Hiring professional auditors
If you’re not up to the challenge of auditing your own home, simply don’t 
want to, or have gas-burning equipment, you may decide to go with a 
professional. Several sources are available.
You can call your power company, which will probably do an audit for you. 
It may be a mail-in type of deal, in which case you may as well just struggle 
through it yourself because by the time you’re done compiling enough 
information to make the mail-in audit worthwhile, you basically will have 
done the job yourself. The same applies to Internet audits. Plus, online 
resources that offer energy audits will probably try to sell you something you 
don’t need.
Professional audit companies will impress you with all their cool stuff. They 
have fancy gizmos that use invisible infrared light to measure the tempera-
ture of your interior surfaces, and they use them to pinpoint leaks. They’ll 
check out your furnace, which is worthwhile. They’ll inspect your ductwork 
and look for cracks in your foundation. They can tell you in precise math-
ematical terms just how leaky your house is.
But the fact is, the biggest inefficiencies are usually easy to detect, especially 
if you’ve never even tried before. I can tell you from experience doing audits 
that most houses have glaring problems that can usually be fixed for less 
than a few hundred dollars. The biggest culprit? Loose joints in the ductwork, 

50
Part I: Solving the World’s Problems from Your Front Porch 
which result in untold hundreds of dollars of wasted energy costs per year. 
And you can fix them up with aluminum or duct tape for less than $10.
If you do decide to hire an auditor, look here:
 
 Consult NAESCO (National Association of Energy Service Companies) at 
202-822-0950 or www. naesco.org.
 
 In the phone book, look under “energy conservation services and 
products.” Locate utility companies under “electric service,” “utility 
providers,” or “gas utility companies.”
 
 Check out hes.lbl.gov for a free home energy audit and carbon 
footprint estimates.
 
 For a sample of an energy audit, look at www.pge.com/energysurvey/.
As you check out different auditors, consider the following:
 
 Do you want to make a change or improvement in your home? Ask how 
this would fit in with the results of your audit and ask for some advice. 
Auditors have tons of experience, and they’re usually proud to expound.
 
 Ask about financing programs the company has for improvements the 
auditor suggests.
 
 Ask about guarantees for their work. If they tell you that you can achieve 
a certain cost reduction, how accurate do they warrant that claim to be?
 
Tell the auditors before they come out to your home that you want them to 
tell you which jobs you can do yourself. If they balk, find somebody else.
After you hire a professional auditor, you still need to do a bit of work your-
self, which essentially requires amassing some info:
 
 Assemble all your electric and utility bills. Go back two or three years.
 
 Make a list of occupants’ habits regarding energy usage. Are you home 
all day every day (is anyone?), or are you home mainly during the eve-
nings, for example?
 
 Note the thermostat setting in your house. Do you change it depending 
on the season or other factors?
 
 Make a list of questions you have. If something seems wrong with your 
house, write that down, too.

Chapter 4
Financing Efficiency Improvements
In This Chapter
 Looking into the various incentives and assistance programs available
 Using loans to finance your energy-efficiency projects
 Working with banks and financial institutions
A
 lot of government programs are geared toward helping consumers 
make efficiency improvements. These range from solar subsidies to 
Department of Energy programs designed to help you decide which appliances 
are the most energy-efficient. Not only can you get information, but you can 
also get free money in the form of subsidies, tax breaks, and rebates. I’d rather 
have free money, so I focus more on that aspect in this chapter.
Utility companies also offer a range of programs, including free information as 
well as free money. The programs available are too numerous for me to list in 
detail, and they’re constantly changing, so I tell you how to research the ben-
efits they offer on your own.
Last but not least, you may want to consider financing your energy-efficiency 
improvements via a loan. I tell you the best way to go about doing so, and I give 
you some tips on how to work with banks.
Understanding the Different 
Types of Assistance
Many different types of government assistance are available, and it pays to 
understand exactly how the various programs differ from each other.
For those skeptics out there who are howling, “There’s no such thing as a free 
lunch,” I’m with you 100 percent. But if you take into account how much money 
you pay in taxes and utility bills, all you’re really doing here is getting some of it 
back, and that’s hardly a free lunch. It’s more like paying for somebody else’s lunch 
for three days in a row, and then having them pay for part of yours one day.

52
Part I: Solving the World’s Problems from Your Front Porch 
Rebates
Rebates are money that’s given back to a customer after a purchase is made. 
You’re probably familiar with rebates for consumer goods like appliances, 
and energy-efficiency rebates operate basically the same way. But being born 
of government, the latter are laden with details generally incomprehensible 
to the average layperson.
The way solar rebates work in California serves as an example of the 
complexity involved. For a PV system, you can get up to 25 percent of the 
system’s cost in rebates, but the actual amount depends on the system’s 
productivity. (PV stands for photovoltaic, which is a solar electrical generat-
ing apparatus.) The state has a very specific computer program that pre-
dicts system performance. Inputs are
 
 Your geographical location: Data banks have been created with the 
statistical weather patterns in your area.
 
 The size and orientation of your solar collectors: The greatest solar 
exposure comes from a specific roof angle (depending on your latitude) 
and a specific azimuth angle — namely, true south.
 
 Whether your solar collectors are in full sunshine or not: If a tree or 
building shades your solar collectors, they collect less sunlight energy, 
which is a form of inefficiency.
 
 The efficiency of your system: This is also related to a system’s 
productivity.
For a perfect solar location, the state will rebate 25 percent of the cost of 
your solar system. Most rebates come in at around 20 to 24 percent. When 
they come in much lower than that, your solar investment quickly loses 
allure and cost effectiveness declines.
The rebate is paid directly to the professional solar contractor, so the customer 
does not need to finance the entire investment and then wait to get the rebate 
back. This is a good facet because it means you don’t have to front the money.
A buy-down caveat complicates the matter even further. As time progresses, 
the rebates are scheduled to decrease, which encourages solar customers to 
buy now rather than later. Ideally, as the rebates diminish, prices will come 
down due to market forces so the net cost of a system won’t change over 
time. (Well, okay. But when do government programs ever work the way 
they’re supposed to? On the other hand, just be glad you don’t get all the 
government that you pay for.)
As you can see, free government money comes with some complexity and 
many strings attached, and it pays to understand the details. But it’s free 
money, so what’s the beef?

53
 Chapter 4: Financing Efficiency Improvements
Tax credits
Tax credits are an increasingly common form of subsidy. You must buy 
a certain type of system to qualify, and the credit is taken on either your 
state or federal tax return. This means you must carry the cost until your 
return is filed, and any refund comes back to you. This can take over a 
year, depending on when you buy a system. Still, a tax credit is far better 
than a tax deduction, and here’s why: A tax deduction is subtracted from 
your income so that your tax burden is less. If you’re paying a marginal tax 
rate of 28 percent and you get a deduction for $1,000, you save $280. A tax 
credit, on the other hand, is subtracted from your taxes. A $1,000 tax credit 
saves you $1,000! Yee-ha!
For example, the federal government allows a 30 percent tax credit for both 
hydro turbine systems and solar water-heating systems, up to a maximum of 
$2,000 per year. If your solar water-heater costs $6,000 to install, you get $2,000 
off the price. If your hydro turbine costs $30,000, you only get $2,000 off the 
price. This encourages smaller investments because you save a greater 
percentage. The way to game this strategy is to spread your investments out 
over time. Install a solar water heater this year, and a hydro turbine next. And 
if possible, install two small systems instead of one big one.
By understanding the precise details, you can achieve more benefit from the 
programs.
Protection from property tax increases
Many states have laws that prevent your property taxes from rising due to 
the increase in value of your home from an efficiency investment. So if you 
install a $40,000 solar PV system, your county cannot reassess your property 
and charge you extra taxes for having a home that’s worth $40,000 more.
Home-operated business advantages
If you have a home business or office, you may qualify for the higher tax 
credits and rebates that are offered as incentives for businesses to become 
more energy efficient. Businesses can also take advantage of accelerated 
depreciation schedules for most energy-efficiency equipment.
Why do businesses get bigger tax breaks and rebates? One reason is that 
businesses use most of their energy in the middle of the afternoon when the 
greatest burden is being shouldered by the utilities. Another is that the green 
spirit that motivates many energy-efficiency investments does not exist for 
businesses.

54
Part I: Solving the World’s Problems from Your Front Porch 
 
Taking advantage of these incentives can get complex; ask your tax preparer 
for the details.
Net metering
Net metering means that you can sell your solar generated power to the 
utilities by hooking up special equipment to your household electrical system. 
Utilities are not particularly enthusiastic about offering rebates, nor do they 
really want residential customers to hook solar equipment up to the grid (not 
because they’re grouchy, but because it diminishes their business base). 
Recognizing this, the 1978 federal Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act (PURPA) 
mandates local utilities to pay “avoided” or wholesale costs to entities that 
wish to sell it. In other words, the utilities must pay you exactly what it costs 
them to produce the power they would be providing; they can’t profit from 
your being hooked up to the grid. They may not pay you exactly what they sell 
you the power for, but they have to pay you exactly what it costs them.
This is the basis for net metering, which makes solar PV investment viable (see 
Chapter 16 for details of the whys and wherefores). Without net metering, solar 
PV would be no more than a rare novelty (like good pop music).
States often have even more stringent net metering rules. In California, the 
utilities must pay you the same rate that they charge for power (rather than 
the “avoided cost”). For instance, if you’re on a time of use (TOU) rate 
schedule, the utility must pay you the same rates it charges customers at 
different times of the day. This is a very strong incentive for installing solar 
systems because the highest power rates are always in the middle of the 
afternoon, which is also the time when solar PV systems are outputting at 
the maximum rate. So if you have a PV intertie system (intertie means you’re 
hooked up to the power grid), you can game your power consumption to 
leverage the exchange of energy (see Chapter 16 for the technical details).
Manufacturers’ rebates
Manufacturers’ rebates work the same for energy-efficiency improvements as 
they do for other products. You buy a system or component, and the manu-
facturer either gives you an instant rebate or one that you send away for by 
mailing in proof of your purchase. These rebates are very common these days, 
especially for products that feature the Energy Star label (see Chapter 11
 for more details on Energy Star).

55
 Chapter 4: Financing Efficiency Improvements
Tax-deductible home-equity loans
Although they may not be a direct subsidy of energy-efficiency improvements, 
tax-deductible home-equity loans are akin to government subsidies because 
you can write off the interest on such loans (writing it off means subtracting it 
from your taxable income, resulting in a smaller net tax burden).
If you take out a second mortgage to pay for your energy-efficiency equipment, 
the government lets you deduct the interest on that loan. So if you’re making 
a monthly payment of, say, $300 for a second mortgage, your net cost may be 
only $200. It works exactly like a subsidy.
Researching Your Subsidy Options
Things are changing so fast, keeping up with all the different government 
programs is impossible. I can only point you in the right direction and give 
you a nudge. It’s up to you to poke around and get all the details for yourself. 
Here’s how to research the subject further:
 
 Talk to your tax preparer. This person should be well-versed in the 
details of tax credits and deductions. If not, he’ll be able to access the 
information sources that will be needed to process your rebates and tax 
credits. Many of these programs are relatively new; give your preparer a 
break if he doesn’t know the details upfront, but keep at him to find out. 
Expect to pay more for your tax preparation because more forms will be 
required (indecipherable to the average layperson, so if you’re thinking 
about preparing your own, be forewarned).
 
 Talk to energy-efficiency contractors. These people know all the 
subsidies because this knowledge helps them sell systems. PV 
contractors are experts at tax credits and rebates, and they will usually 
help you process them as well. Most stove stores know the ins and outs 
of local ordinances and whether utility rebates are available.
 
 Ask your utility company. Utilities don’t necessarily want to give you 
information, but they have to. So if you push a little, you can get all 
kinds of information, and it’s almost always free. Call the customer 
service number on your utility bill and go from there. Ask too many 
questions, even if they don’t seem appropriate. You’ll be surprised at 
how much you can find out this way. And be very nice; they’re not used 
to that, being what they are. If you’re nice, they may even go out of their 
way to be nice right back. Just don’t expect it.

When doing research, keep in mind that subsidies may be available for all 
kinds of systems. For instance, if you install an energy-efficient front door, you 
may qualify for a 10-percent tax credit. Gas fireplaces may get you a credit. Be 
expansive in your search, and you can find all sorts of little goodies.
Financing through Loans
Many energy-efficiency investments are large enough that you may need to 
take out a loan to implement them. There are several different types of loans 
you can pursue. This section gives you the lowdown. (For advice on securing 
your loan from a bank, see the section “Working with Banks: Their Way or the 
Highway” later in this chapter.)
Consumer loans
Consumer loans don’t require any collateral, so the risk is high. You can get 
a credit card with a $30,000 credit limit far easier than should ever be pos-
sible. The reason it’s so easy? The interest rate is sky high; the bank expects 
a number of defaults, and lets the customers who don’t default cover the 
losses from the ones who do. Plus, you don’t get any sort of tax deduction 
on the interest, so the net result is that these loans are even costlier. These 
creditors are the modern version of loan sharks, although they no longer 
break your fingers when you default. If you’re a good credit risk, avoid con-
sumer loans like the plague and get a loan that’s more beneficial to you.

 Chapter 4: Financing Efficiency Improvements
Supplier loans
Supplier loans are available from manufacturers and suppliers who provide 
energy-efficiency equipment. They use the equipment itself as collateral. 
These loans are somewhat akin to automobile loans that are offered by car 
dealers to buyers who purchase a vehicle. The car is collateral, so if you 
don’t make your loan payment, they come to your house late at night and 
take back the car — perfectly legal. If you default on one of these loans for 
your solar equipment, they may come in the middle of the night and grab the 
collectors off your roof. You probably won’t mistake them for Santa Claus.
Equity loans
Equity loans are the most common option, and they’re also the best. In those 
parts of the country where real estate values are rising, homeowners enjoy 
equity, which is the difference between what is owed in mortgages on the 
home and the home’s market value (or appraised value, which should be the 
same but rarely is).
 
You can use your equity to get a loan at a much lower interest rate because 
the bank’s risk is greatly reduced by using real estate as collateral. They don’t 
need to come after the equipment you have financed (they generally don’t 
care what you do with the money, so they may not even know about your new 
energy-efficiency equipment) because they can go after the house itself. They 
know that homeowners are going to pay off their debts long before they let a 
bank take their home away.
Furthermore, home-equity loans are generally tax deductible (consult your 
tax preparer blah, blah, blah). If your combined state and federal marginal 
tax rate is 35 percent, $100 per month in interest payments only costs you 
$65.
Government-subsidized, 
energy-efficiency loans
The government is interested in promoting energy efficiency, so it makes a 
wide range of loan subsidies available. In essence, the government accepts part 
of the risk of the loan, and a bank therefore can offer you a lower interest rate. 
Looking into the various government programs is worth your while because 
you can often get a loan for better terms.

Part I: Solving the World’s Problems from Your Front Porch 
Home energy ratings
A number of financing programs are available for energy-efficiency 
improvements (solar, in particular) to homes that qualify. In order to 
qualify, you need to have your home audited and rated by a licensed 
expert, who writes a report estimating annual energy use and costs. 
You can also expect some recommendations for improvements that may 
have to be implemented as a condition of loan approval. To get the best 
loan terms, you have to convince the financing institution that the 
improvements you intend to fund with the loan make sense in the grand 
scheme of things. That’s reasonable.
 
If things look good, you can take advantage of special energy-efficient financing 
programs that offer lower interest rates than conventional loans. Keep in mind, 
however, that with these loans you’re required to pay for the energy audit and 
interface with government agencies.
Energy Efficient Mortgages (EEMs)
There are two types of Energy Efficient Mortgages (EEMs): one for existing 
homes and another for new ones. Here’s a quick breakdown of who’s providing 
what, but keep in mind that we’re talking about the government here, so terms 
and programs are subject to change at the whim of a congressperson from the 
boondocks:
 
 Fannie Mae, the Federal National Mortgage Association, encourages 
lenders to provide EEMs by establishing guidelines and certain types of 
incentives. Check out what’s available at www.fanniemae.com.
 
 Freddie Mac, the Federal Home Mortgage Loan Corporation, is basically 
the same as Fannie Mae, but is generally more interested in long-term 
loans. Check it out at www.freddiemac.com.
 
 Farmer Mac (part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture) is for those of 
you who are down on the farm. Go to www.usda.gov.
Here are some other potentially useful government agencies (I said potentially):
 
 Department of Energy (DOE): www.doe.gov.
 
 Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD): www.hud.
gov.
 
 State agencies: Often providers of subsidized loans in addition 
to federal agencies. Check out the prospects at www.naseo.org 
(National Association of State Energy Officials).
 
 Residential Energy Services Network (RESNET): A network of mortgage 
bankers, builders, and so forth. Check them out at www.natresnet.org.

 Chapter 4: Financing Efficiency Improvements
Other sources of subsidized financing
Utilities may provide subsidized financing as well. Not because they want 
to, but because they’re required to by law. You can find a customer-
service number on your utility bill, and there may even be a particular 
branch dedicated to subsidized loans.
Equipment vendors sometimes provide loans, just like car dealers. 
However, they generally sign up with an equity loan broker and simply act 
as a sales outlet for that broker’s loans. You could probably find slightly 
better interest rates by going directly to a bank, but the convenience may 
offset the cost. Or, a vendor may actually offer better terms because they 
have a strong incentive to close the sale, and making inexpensive financing 
available helps considerably.
Leasing Energy-Efficient Equipment
Here’s a new financing idea that’s taking hold: Companies install solar 
equipment on your roof, but they retain ownership of the equipment. You 
basically lease it from them for either a fixed monthly cost or a percentage of 
the system’s production. This works nicely if you save more on your power 
bill than the monthly cost of the lease. You don’t have to maintain the 
equipment because it’s not yours.
Alternatively, you can use these programs to lock in the cost of your energy 
so that when it rises, you are securely hedged. You don’t have to have any 
cash up front, and this is a very popular way to finance a big purchase, 
as evidenced by how many autos are leased on the same basic principle. 
Ultimately, financing the equipment yourself — actually purchasing it rather 
than leasing it — is almost always a better investment from a return standpoint. 
But many people simply don’t have the cash, prefer to spend their money on 
something else, or don’t want to sign up for a loan because it will appear on a 
credit application.
 
Be aware that, just as with cars, there is a residual value at the end of the 
lease, and if your equipment has decreased in value for some reason, you may 
have to pay a big chunk to get out of the lease.

Working with Banks: Their 
Way or the Highway
In my view, banks rank (and rank they are) right up there with governmental 
institutions for charm and affability. Regardless of which financial institution 
or bank you decide to work with, you’re better prepared if you know how 
banks work and what rules you need to (or should) follow.
The reason people get so frustrated at bankers is that they have hordes of 
rules and regulations that come from above. This may seem onerous to you, 
the consumer, but it makes perfect sense from the bank’s standpoint because 
mistakes cost a lot of money and need to be avoided. When you approach a 
bank for a loan, keep these things in mind:
 
 Banks have very rigid rules and procedures. The people you will be 
talking to have absolutely no power to alter these. If you don’t package 
your programs, proposals, and ideas in the bank’s format, you’re wasting 
your time.
 
 You, the borrower, are not the bank’s customer. A bank’s customers are 
the people who give them money, not the people who borrow it. Banks 
make profits (capitalism’s central objective) by lending you money at 
higher rates than they have to pay their customers for their money.
 
 Banks are concerned with risk. They constantly strive to make loans 
at the lowest risk possible. When somebody defaults on a mortgage, 
especially a second one, it’s very costly for the bank. If you want to do 
business with a bank, your goal should be to present yourself as a 
low-risk proposition.

Making Tradeoffs That 
Work for You
In This Chapter
 Choosing investments wisely
 Using a system for analyzing the options
 Real-life scenarios you can compare with your own investment decisions
N
ot all investments in efficiency improvement take cash. You can do 
many things around your home that involve simply changing your 
consumption habits or changing the way you set your thermostat. But 
almost all investments require you to choose from among several alterna-
tives. Having only a single choice on your hands is rare. Choosing wisely 
requires a system of balancing energy efficiency, financial efficiency, pollu-
tion efficiency, and labor efficiency, and everybody prioritizes these criteria 
in their own way. In this chapter, I show you how to account for the various 
factors that come into play in your decision-making process.
Setting Efficiency Investment Goals
When you make investments — in time, money, or just sheer effort — to 
become more energy-efficient, the trick is to put together a strategy that 
works for you and helps you meet your own goals. Whereas one person’s 
goal may be solely to become more “green,” another person’s goal may be 
to reduce consumptions simply to save money. And quite a few people, no 
doubt, want to make gains in both areas: saving money and doing more to 
help the environment.

62
Part I: Solving the World’s Problems from Your Front Porch 
Think of investments in energy efficiency as you would financial investments. 
There are more similarities than you may realize:
 
 Choosing options that work for you. Financial investment pros help 
their clients assemble a portfolio, or mixture, of investments from the 
many options available. You also have myriad options in investments for 
energy efficiency. One option is not to invest in energy efficiency at all. 
You can just leave your house the way it is. When something breaks, you 
don’t have to replace it with a new, improved version; you can just put 
the same thing back in.
 
 Alternatively, you can make small investments that garner small, but 
real, rewards. Examples include replacing incandescent light bulbs with 
energy-efficient bulbs, caulking around your window frames to keep 
the draft out, or wrapping your furnace ducts in insulation to keep the 
warmth in. Maybe you’re into big changes: replacing the old double-
furnace in your basement with a brand new energy-efficient model, or 
scrapping traditional heating systems altogether and going solar. The 
point is that you can take big steps or little steps, but all steps lead you 
in the right direction.
 
 Dealing with risk. An important factor to consider in building a financial 
portfolio is the risk profile. Some investments entail more risk than 
others and need to offer more of a chance for gain to offset the 
increased risk. The same is true with energy-efficiency investments: To 
justify the expense of a big-ticket item, you need to see a big return — 
whether in cost savings, energy efficiency, or feel-good factor.
 
 Shielding yourself from future price fluctuations. Hedging, paying a 
certain amount now to lock in prices in the future, reduces financial risk. 
If you invest in energy efficiency, you shield your utility bill from energy 
price fluctuations because when rates rise, you don’t feel the pinch 
nearly as much. If you put a solar system on your roof that reduces your 
energy bills to zero, that’s exactly where they will stay, even if the cost 
of energy quadruples. That’s a powerful form of hedging.
Analyzing Investments
In this section I present a system for analyzing investments. The goal is to 
compare different options and choose the best one. The idea is to compare 
costs to gains, with risk and other non-numerical factors moderating the 
results.
Basically, you need to look at two things:

63
 Chapter 5: Making Tradeoffs That Work for You
 
 How long it’ll take to earn back the money invested, or payback. In 
the case of most energy-efficiency improvements, you have to invest 
cash before you see a single dime of savings. Payback is measured 
in months, or even years. Here’s an example. You invest $2,000 in an 
on-demand water heater, which saves $30 a month in electric costs. 
Dividing 2,000 by 30 equals 67 months, or about 5
1⁄2 years.
 
 As you think about payback, remember that good decisions aren’t just 
predicated on dollars and cents. You also need to consider the intangibles, 
like aesthetic beauty and pollution mitigation, among others.
 
 How energy-efficiency investments compare to other investments. 
This is a key issue for those who see the money savings as the key 
reason for becoming more energy efficient.
Considering the costs, financial 
and otherwise
So how much is any particular energy-efficiency investment going to cost 
you? You need to know before you can determine whether you can afford 
to implement it or, for that matter, given the potential savings that such an 
investment can bring, whether you can afford not to. When you think about 
any energy-efficiency investment, consider these potential costs:
 
 Equipment: How much will equipment cost, and when will you pay for 
it? Sometimes equipment costs are spread out over time. You need to 
specify the time line. For instance, if you are purchasing a new HVAC 
system on a credit card, the payments will be monthly until the balance 
is paid off. Chapter 3 tells you how to determine the annual costs 
associated with a big purchase.
 
 Installation costs: If you’re hiring a pro, how much will it cost and when 
are these funds due? If you’re going to do it yourself, figure in the cost of 
any tools or other equipment you need to buy.
 
 Refuse cost: Will you pay to have project trash hauled away?
 
 Lifetime and warranty: What is the likelihood that you will have to pay 
for servicing? How often? How much will it cost? Warranties are very 
important for big ticket items because they usually have big ticket costs 
associated with repairs. And some manufacturers are better at taking 
care of warranty issues than others.
 
 Taxes, permits, and fees: How much are they and when are they due? 
Will your property taxes go up as a result of an efficiency investment? 
This is rare, but you should find out whether it applies to you.
 
 Interest: Will you finance your equipment? If so, the interest is a cost.

64
Part I: Solving the World’s Problems from Your Front Porch 
 
 Maintenance: The type of energy-efficiency equipment that’s designed 
to handle big jobs tends to be pretty complex. You need to understand 
how it works and perform periodic maintenance tasks to keep it working up 
to snuff. You won’t usually know when something’s gong to need fixing 
or how much it’s going to cost.
 
 Safety: When you install complex technical equipment, you’re introduc-
ing dangers into your home. Electrical shocks. Scalding water. Falling 
off a roof. Discovering stepladder malfunctions. Smoke and ventilation 
issues. You get the point.
 
 Inexperience: If you design and install a system yourself, it may not 
perform as well as you thought it would. The experts know all the little 
tricks that you don’t. Savings can suffer, and you may have to pay an 
expert to come in and set things straight.
Of course, financial costs aren’t the only ones you should consider. Most 
changes require readjustments. As you count costs, determine which of the 
following apply to the change you want to make and how willing you are to 
either accept them or make the necessary accommodations:
 
 Changing habits: With some energy-efficiency equipment, you have to 
change your consumption habits to take best advantage of the potential. 
For instance, if you install a solar hot water heater, taking showers in the 
late afternoon is better than taking them early in the morning. How willing 
are you to make the changes? Furthermore, with some energy-efficiency 
investments, the only requirement is to change habits; no cash is 
invested at all. An example of this is taking shorter showers.
 
 Inconvenience: Is your system going to require more work on your 
part? Wood stoves take a lot of maintenance and cleaning. Are you going 
to do it? How much is your time worth? Are some jobs more or less 
repulsive than others?
 
 The clutter factor: Do you sometimes feel as though your life is spinning 
out of control? There’s too much of this, too much of that, and too much 
clutter (not just physical, but emotional as well). Do you want to bite off 
even more?
 
 The how-it-looks factor: Sometimes equipment can be ugly. Do the pipes 
running up the side of your house look industrial? Do PV panels make 
your house look unearthly? Conversely, many projects make your home 
look much nicer. Given two projects with equal numbers, you’re more 
apt to choose the one that offers aesthetic beauty or pride in ownership. 
In fact, you may favor these types of projects enough to choose them 
even when the payback isn’t all that terrific.
 
 The how-it-smells factor: Yes, some energy-efficiency devices tend to 
stink, like biomass generators or compost toilets.

65
 Chapter 5: Making Tradeoffs That Work for You
Estimating gains
After you think about all the costs — financial, aesthetic, and otherwise — of 
your potential efficiency investment, you need to think about the ways the 
investment pays you back. So how can you make money from your investments? 
Let me count the ways.
Lower monthly utility bills
With most energy-efficiency investments, saving money is the ultimate goal. 
You need to take a look at how much you’re paying now versus how much 
you’ll be paying after the investment. This may be very difficult to estimate, 
but it’s worth a try.
 
When estimating cost reductions, always use the rate structures that apply 
both before and after you finish the project. For instance, when you install 
a solar PV system, you’ll likely be getting a new power meter and a new rate 
structure. You may be going from a tiered structure to a time-of-day structure, 
in which case you should estimate the new cost savings by the time-of-day 
structure. (See Chapter 3 for more details on rate structures.)
 
Sometimes you can save money by doing nothing more than changing rate 
structures. For instance, if you’re away from home all afternoon and you 
change your electric rate structure from simple (which just charges you the 
same rate regardless of when you use the power) to TOU (time of use, which 
charges different rates at different times of day, you will probably save money 
without doing anything else. Talk to your utility company to see whether this 
is an option for you.
Appreciation
The value of your home goes up when you make most improvements. The 
amount of the appreciation depends on the following factors:
 
 How much it would cost a buyer to put in new equipment himself. 
Don’t expect to get much more than that. But if the cost of new equip-
ment increases, the value of your equipment can also go up. For the 
most part, your home only increases in value by a percentage of what 
you put into investments. A kitchen remodel, for instance, nominally 
increases the value of your home by about 70 percent of what you 
spend (if you contract out the entire job). Installing a gas fireplace insert 
returns around 65 percent.
 
 How much documentation you can provide to verify the energy savings 
that are achieved with the equipment. If you can show (with 
documentation) that you’ve saved a certain amount of money, you’re in 
a stronger position to recoup your investment when you sell your home.

66
Part I: Solving the World’s Problems from Your Front Porch 
 
 How much the cost of energy goes up. The more energy costs rise, the 
more your equipment is worth. This should be intuitive. The higher energy 
costs are, the more money you save from your efficiency investments. Plus, 
people get warier about future increases and will pay more to hedge against 
them.
 
 How trendy the improvement is in your neck of the woods. Some 
things sell because they’re a fad. This is very true of green products 
these days (the term for hyped environmental products is greenwashing), 
and in some parts of the country, an energy-efficient home is worth a lot 
more than the same model with conventional energy. Look for this trend 
to expand, especially if energy costs spike upward.
Other plusses
Appreciation and cheaper utility bills aren’t the only ways to recoup the cost 
of your investment. Following are other ways that efficiency changes can 
bolster your bottom line and/or your feel-good factor:
 
 Deductions: If you’re installing equipment for your business or office, 
you may be able to depreciate certain items and gain some tax 
deductions.
 
 Rebates and subsidies: These come from utilities, state and federal 
governments, manufacturers, and so on. See Chapter 4 for details.
 
 Aesthetics: If you invest in a maple tree, you’ll get shade performance, 
but the greater pleasure is having a nice tree near your house. When you 
invest in window coverings, you enjoy better insulation, but the greater 
gain is probably in the increased enjoyment you get from the improved 
appearance of your home.
 
 Footprints: When you invest in efficiency improvements, you’re saving 
a lot of carbon dioxide. In Chapter 3, I give a brief outline for calculating 
how much this might be.
 
 Money made from salvage: You may be able to sell some of the old 
equipment you will be taking out.
Setting a baseline for comparison: Bank 
accounts and stock market yields
You can always put your hard-earned cash into a bank account and draw 
simple interest. It’s the safest bet, one the Federal Government guarantees. 
Whenever you consider an investment, the proper starting point is always to 
consider how it compares to a bank account, so this is where I begin.

67
 Chapter 5: Making Tradeoffs That Work for You
Say you put $1,000 in a savings account that earns 6 percent compounded 
interest. Twelve years after you make your original investment, you’ll have 
$1,000 in interest, so this is the payback period. At any point in time you can 
pull your money out of the bank with zero risk. So you’ve done nothing but 
make money, right? Not exactly.
You pay income tax on interest income, so your net gain is going to be less 
than 6 percent. If you make $100 in interest and you’re paying a 35 percent 
marginal tax rate (combined state and fed), you’ll only net $65.
When you save money by investing in energy efficiency, you rarely, if ever, 
will be called upon to pay taxes on the money you save. This could make a 
significant difference in your investment decision, so you must always take 
taxes into account.
If you invest your money in the stock market and get a return of 12 percent, 
the payback period is only six years. Sounds good, but once again, you’ll 
probably be paying income taxes on the gains. In addition, depending on the 
type of stocks you buy, the value of your stock could go down rather than up, 
maybe all the way to zero.
Value today versus value tomorrow
Strictly speaking, when doing payback calcula-
tions, changes in the value of money over time 
must be taken into account, which basically 
means that you should discount the value today 
of a dollar you expect to receive in the future.
Suppose you have a choice between two 
alternatives: $1 today or $1 a year from now. 
You take the $1 today, of course. But how 
much would you take today for a dollar in the 
future? To determine its future worth, you need 
to factor in the current interest rate or, even 
more precisely, what the interest rate is going 
to be over the course of the next year. Say the 
interest rate is 6 percent. You would then be 
trading $1.06 a year from now for $1 today.
In calculating payback, it works the other way 
around. For example, if you’re going to save 
$100 a year from today, at 6 percent interest that 
$100 is worth only $94 right now. Saving $100 in 
ten years is worth only $54 today.
For the most part, I ignore this effect in the 
calculations, and there will be technical 
purists out there who cry out in indignation. But 
I’m trying to keep things simple. A good way to 
factor in the value of money over time without 
getting into weird math is simply to be liberally 
conservative (not conservatively liberal) in your 
estimates. The net effect will be the same.

68
Part I: Solving the World’s Problems from Your Front Porch 
Looking at Real-World 
Investment Scenarios
The following examples give you a good idea of how to analyze your own 
investments. In some cases, you can just substitute your own numbers for 
the ones given. Other times, you may have to adjust the model to fit your 
exact situation. But the approach to each situation should be the same 
because the ultimate goal is to compare different investment scenarios; in 
order to do this, you have to analyze them under the same rules.
Supplementing an existing water 
heater with a solar system
Suppose you use 1,000 kWh of electricity per month. At 15 cents per kWh, 
your monthly cost is $150. An energy audit determines that water heating 
comprises 18 percent of your total electric bill, at a cost of $27 per month. 
Interested in saving money and reducing your carbon footprint, you look into 
a solar water heating system (one that works with your existing equipment).
You do your research and discover that the solar water heating system costs 
$2,000, including parts and installation. A federal government tax credit of 
30 percent is available, for a total of $600, making the net cost of the system 
$1,400. The system comes with a five-year warranty.
Is this a good investment? The following sections take you through various 
scenarios that are tied to different goals so you can see how to determine the 
value of the investment in each instance.
Goal: To lower your utility payment and save money
In considering the solar water heating system, you do the calculations and 
realize that, using the data presented in the earlier example, it will take 52 
months (the $1,400 net cost of the system divided by $27 in monthly savings) 
to recover your initial investment. The 60-month warranty ensures no 
maintenance costs in this time frame. However, say you live in the north, 
where there isn’t as much sunshine and the winters are colder. You might find 
that your cost savings in this case would be $13.50 per month, or half as much 
as those of your counterpart in the sunnier, warmer region, and the payback 
period would be twice as long — 104 months. This isn’t much different than 
what you’d get if you invested the money with a bank, where the risk would be 
nil. If you were making your decision solely on cost effectiveness, you’d decide 
this is a bad investment, and you’d look elsewhere (like maybe at a new gas 
fireplace).

69
 Chapter 5: Making Tradeoffs That Work for You
Goal: To reduce your carbon footprint
How much is reducing pollution worth to you? Ten dollars a month? Twenty? 
How much would you pay to completely eliminate your carbon footprint 
altogether? $1,000 a year? This is difficult to estimate, but it gets to the very 
core of the issue. It’s a fact that reducing pollution is going to cost everybody 
money; who will pay for it is subject to politics, and beyond the scope of this 
book. But in making everyday decisions, you must answer the question for 
yourself.
Here’s how to proceed. The typical carbon footprint (for a 3-bedroom, 2-bath 
home with 2.3 occupants — and don’t ask me how you get 2.3 occupants) is 
around 40,000 pounds per year. The typical footprint from a water heater is 
3,000 pounds per year, or 7.5 percent of the total footprint. If you are willing to 
spend $1,000 a year on erasing your carbon footprint, you’ll spend 7.5 percent 
of this on heating water. That’s $75 per year, or $6.25 per month. Add this to 
the savings column in the calculations and instead of only $13.50 per month, 
you’re really saving $19.75. This makes the payback 70 months, which is a 
better proposition. If you’re willing to spend $2,000 a year eliminating pollu-
tion, your total cost savings will be $26 per month, which leaves you with a 
payback of 53 months, almost identical to that in the original example. Now 
this is a good investment.
Note that if you’re willing to spend $2,000 per year mitigating pollution, you 
don’t actually end up spending this amount when you put the solar water 
heater in. You only spend 7.5 percent of it. But the rationale remains useful in 
comparing alternatives, some of which will save more pollution than others.
Goal: To offset the higher charges in a tiered rate billing system
In a tiered rate structure, not all watts are created equal. Your energy usage 
in kWh is structured into tiers (not unlike income tax brackets), and the rate 
charged per kWh increases from one tier to the next. So the more energy you 
use, the more you pay. Energy efficiency savings come from the highest tier 
first, and therefore offer the greatest cost savings. Some tiered rate structures 
are very punitive, with the highest rates three or four times the base rate. 
This strongly encourages efficiency investments.
If your energy utility uses a tiered rate structure and you put in the solar 
water heater, your cost savings can easily be twice as much. Payback is 
therefore half as long. The solar water heater example offsets 18 percent of 
the household energy use, but in a typical tiered rate system, this accounts 
for closer to 35 percent of the total dollar cost in the utility bill.
 
In a tiered rate structure, small- and medium-sized energy efficiency investments 
are more worthwhile — that’s the entire point. As the size of your investment 
grows, the payback gets worse because you get less and less return on your 
investment. You may still want to make a large investment, if your main goal is 
pollution mitigation.

Part I: Solving the World’s Problems from Your Front Porch 
Goal: To hedge against rising energy costs
Suppose that energy costs rise 12 percent per year instead of staying flat. If 
you put in the solar water heater, each year your savings grow. If you save 
$26 per month the first year, as in the earlier example, the next year your 
savings will grow to $30.24 per month ($27 × 1.12). Then $33.87 ($30.24 × 
1.12), then $37.93, then $42.48, and so on. In this case, the payback is 44 
months, down from 52 months.
Regardless of how high energy costs go, the amount that you’ll spend on 
heating water is locked in at zero. This is a form of hedging. Here’s another 
form, not quite as tangible but still very real: You won’t have to take shorter 
showers or skimp on that bath, no matter how high energy costs may go. 
This may be translated into peace of mind.
Goal: To increase your home’s value
Suppose you’re planning to sell your house five years down the road. If you 
put in a solar water heating system, at that point in time the savings from the 
new system will be $48 per month, or $600 per year. A home buyer will pay 
more for the home when you sell it because of this built-in cost reduction. 
How much more? The following factors come into play:
 
 A lot of work is involved in installing a new system, and most buyers 
don’t want to do it themselves.
 
 Most home buyers take out a mortgage, and balancing monthly 
payments with a fixed income is the game. Energy cost savings of $48 
per month translate into $48 that can be spent elsewhere. A buyer could 
get a larger mortgage, for instance. For $50 a month, after taxes, he may 
be able to borrow an additional $14,000. Look at it this way: A potential 
buyer looks at your energy-efficient home and the same home, minus 
the energy-efficient system, next door. Your home costs them $48 per 
month less. If you charge $5,000 more for your home, the buyer is still 
ahead of the game if he is using a mortgage.
Giving a ballpark figure for how much appreciation you can expect is 
impossible. In the best case, you may double your original investment after 
five years. In the worst case, you may not get anything at all if the equipment 
is old and obsolete. The most likely case is you’ll get around the same as new 
equipment costs.
Replacing broken equipment
Doing nothing is not an option because now you have a broken washing 
machine, dryer, gas fireplace, you name it. Now you must spend money, and 
probably a good chunk of it. How much more do you have to spend for a new 
energy-efficient system? Probably not much. Now is really the time to go for it.

 Chapter 5: Making Tradeoffs That Work for You
Blowing hot air: A whole-house fan
The investment: a whole-house fan. Equipment costs $350; installation takes 
three hours and requires brains, ladders, and decent tools.
An energy audit determines that the fan will save $25 per month in air-
conditioning (AC) costs over a four-month summer period, while costing 
only $10 per month to run. At $60 per year, the payback is around six years.
A whole-house fan offers other benefits, too: The house is a lot more 
comfortable on the days when it isn’t hot enough to turn the AC on. And 
there are more of these days, so the home is more comfortable most of the 
summer. Plus the house smells better because whole-house fans ventilate 
so well.
Investing in a full-scale solar PV system
Say you live in a 3-bedroom, 2-bath house with good roof exposure for solar 
equipment. Your home is all electric and your average monthly electric bill 
is $260. Energy consumption is 1,600 kWh per month. You had your home 
audited and, through making smaller changes, you decreased the bill 15 
percent to 1,360 kWh per month, or $221.
Now you decide to completely eliminate your electric utility bill and, in the 
process, reduce your home’s carbon footprint to nearly zero. You find a 5kW 
system that will do the job and costs $40,000 — a lot of money, for sure, but 
you take into account the following:
Financing investments with a home equity loan
If you play your cards right, saving more on 
energy costs than the payment on a mortgage 
equity loan used to purchase energy-efficiency 
equipment is common. You have no upfront cost 
when you finance an investment because you 
pay for the investment with the loan proceeds. 
From day one, you can often save more than 
you pay. Your cash flow is in the black.
Suppose you borrow for the solar water heating 
system that promises $27 per month in savings. 
An interest-only home-equity line of credit at 6 
percent tax-deductible interest for $1,400 is only 
$8 per month. That’s a net gain of $19 per month, 
making the payback period for this scenario 74 
months (1,400 / 19 = 74).
At some point the loan must be repaid; most 
likely this will happen when the house is sold 
or refinanced.

72
Part I: Solving the World’s Problems from Your Front Porch 
 
 Once the system is in place, a TOU (time of use) rate structure will 
apply. Plus, you believe you can use 90 percent of your electricity in 
off-peak, lower-rate hours, and will therefore be selling most of your 
solar production back to the utility at the top rate.
 
 The warranty on the panels is 20 years, less for some of the other 
equipment. Reliability is good on the brand chosen, which was not the 
cheapest.
 
 The state will give a rebate of $10,000 directly to the PV system contractor 
so it’s not even billed to you, the homeowner.
All this brings your total out-of-pocket cost to $30,000. But you also qualify 
for these credits and deductions:
 
 The feds will give a $2,000 tax credit for the system, bringing the cost 
down further to only $28,000.
 
 You finance this with a tax-deductible equity loan at $140 per month. 
This means that you’re immediately saving the difference between the 
power bill you eliminated ($221) and the cost for the loan. In this case, 
that’s $141 per month after taxes.
From day one, this deal is in the black.
Using 7 percent as the energy inflation rate, the payback is 11 years, but this 
does not account for the fact that the value of the equipment is also rising. 
With this factor included in the equation, the payback goes down to 7 years.
The potential savings in carbon footprint are 13,000 pounds per year.

O
f course you want to keep your environment clean as efficiently as 
possible, and the best way to do that is to avoid pollution and toxins 
in the first place. You can control toxins and contaminants in your home by 
keeping them out whenever possible and by preventing them from multiply-
ing when they do manage to invade. Fortunately, you can do this easily and 
effectively, but you must be armed with the necessary know-how.
In this chapter, I review a number of the most common sources of home 
problems. I tell you how to detect them and what to do when trouble strikes.
Know your enemy and it shall be vanquished.
Getting Started with General Guidelines
As the other sections in this chapter explain, maintaining a healthy environ-
ment encompasses a lot of details, but some general rules are worth knowing 
for starters, and most of them are easy enough to follow:
 
 Get wise. Find out what kinds of things to avoid. Understand where 
nasty little critters like to live and breed (carpets, anyone?). Pay 
attention to things you can’t see with the naked eye. In particular, read 
the warnings on labels that spell out precisely what the dangers are.

76
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
 
 Ensure proper ventilation. Ventilation is essential to health. Getting it 
can be tough sometimes, especially in the winter. But you don’t 
necessarily need to open windows to ventilate your home. Chapter 13 
gives you the details.
 
 Store toxic materials away from the living quarters in your home. 
The best place to keep them is in your garage. Many people store toxins 
underneath the kitchen sink, but this is asking for trouble. Of course, the 
best bet is not to store toxic materials at all. Buy small containers and 
toss the empties out. This may be a little more expensive, but it makes 
sense, especially if you have kids.
 
 Pay attention to your cleaning products. A surprising number of 
household cleaners are unhealthy. When possible, use environmentally 
friendly cleaning supplies. Check out the following sources of green 
cleaning information and products:
 
• Eco-Source: www.eco-source.com
 
• Household Products Database: www.householdproducts.nlm.

Avoiding Some of the Worst Offenders
We are surrounded by manmade chemicals, and most of them are quite 
benign. Pesticides and food additives have helped people tremendously 
(although insects and molds have a different opinion about this). Humans 
live longer than ever before, and it’s largely because of the profusion of 
modern chemicals in our diets and our medications.
 
If you want to know just how prevalent chemicals are, read some food 
labels. They list things like butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) or butylated 
hydroxytoluene (BHT). The thought of consuming both of these chemicals 
every single day may make you a little leery, but they’re actually making 
you healthier.
On the other hand, a myriad of hazardous chemicals and contaminants can 
cause diseases, rashes, coughs, colds, and a long list of other maladies. The 
trick is to be efficient at sorting out the good from the bad. In this section, I 
review some of the worst home contaminants, and what to do about them.

77
 Chapter 6: Keeping Your Home Free from Contaminants
Fighting off formaldehyde
Around 10 to 20 percent of the population is highly sensitive to formaldehyde 
gas, which evaporates (technically referred to as outgassing) from a wide 
range of common household materials, such as
 
 Particleboard used as subflooring and in shelving, cabinetry, and 
furniture
 
 Hardwood plywood paneling and decorative wall coverings
 
 Carpets, draperies, furniture fabrics, and permanent press clothes 
treated to resist mold and fire
 
 Paints, shellacs, waxes, polishes, oils, and other coating materials
 
 Glues and adhesives
 
 Molded plastics
 
 Insecticides, fumigants, disinfectants, deodorants, germicidal soaps, 
and embalming fluids
 
 Cosmetics, shampoos, nail hardeners, mouthwashes, and 
antiperspirants
 
 Household cleaning products
 
 Water heaters and gas ranges
 
 Old mobile homes and prefab-style houses
 
Exposure to formaldehyde results in cold-like symptoms: coughing, runny 
nose, sore throat, fatigue, vomiting, and nosebleeds. It can also cause 
menstrual disorders, chronic headaches, and periodic memory lapses. To test 
for formaldehyde, obtain a simple testing monitor (they cost between $25 and 
$50; search for “formaldehyde monitor” on the Internet). You leave a vial open 
to your home’s interior air for a specified period of time, and then cap the vial 
and send it to a lab. The lab makes the appropriate measurements and then 
mails you the results.
To avoid formaldehyde:
 
 Paint over old plywood surfaces with a water-based sealant or 
polyurethane varnish. Old kitchen cabinets are good candidates for 
repainting, as are old paneling and particleboard.
 
 Check before you buy. You can usually find out how much 
formaldehyde a produce contains by consulting with the manufacturer, 
who is required to supply this information.
 
 Keep the air flowing. Formaldehyde is an airborne gas, so good 
ventilation can alleviate the problem to a great extent. Dangers are more 
acute in the winter months when homes are closed off.

78
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
 
 If you’re buying composite wood or agrifiber products, get them with no 
added urea formaldehyde (look on the label, or call the manufacturer).
Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)
Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) is the name given to a class of carbon-
based gaseous contaminants emitted from a wide range of home products:
 
 Solvents used in lacquers, adhesives, waxes, cleaning agents, cosmetics, 
paints and paint removers, and leather finishes. Common names are 
benzene, xylene, methyl collosolve, ethyl collosolve, methyl ethyl 
ketone, and trichloroethylene (TCE).
 
 Phenols found in household disinfectants, antiseptics, perfumes, mouth-
washes, polishes, waxes, glues and, ironically, air fresheners. Phenols 
are also a byproduct of combustion, so they’re more prevalent in winter, 
when the windows are closed.
 
 Aerosol sprays propelled by propane, butane, and nitrous oxide gases.
 
 Permanent press fabrics, polyesters, and most synthetic materials.
 
 Pesticides, disinfectants, pet collars, and plant food. Pesticides are by 
far the worst source of contaminants in a home, and the chemicals last 
for years. Particularly noxious are the chemicals used by pest control 
companies, which spray heavy concentrations all around the outside of 
a house and often right inside. These companies have an incentive to 
make sure that insects don’t appear, and the best way to do this is to 
use more than enough chemicals.
 
 Electrical equipment containing PCBs. This material is used because it is 
particularly fire-resistant. The problem is that when it’s exposed to fire, 
some of it burns off. That’s why whenever an electrical fire involves a 
utility company transformer, a special unit of the fire department is 
dispatched with high-tech equipment to protect the firemen. The same 
sort of contamination occurs in your home.
Avoiding VOCs
One of the easiest ways to avoid these chemicals is by not bringing them into 
your home. To do that, read the labels on the materials you buy. By law, 
manufacturers must list the contents of their products, particularly if 
potentially noxious chemicals are in the mix. Some prime culprits that you 
may want to include on your do-not-buy or be-careful-if-you-use list include
 
 Chlorine bleach: A component of most household cleansers. Many 
people use chlorine all the time without realizing it’s unhealthy. If you 
must use it, make sure to allow for ventilation.

79
 Chapter 6: Keeping Your Home Free from Contaminants
 
 Oven cleaners: Particularly bad news as they outgas for a long time. Buy 
an oven with a built-in cleaning feature, and when you’re using it, make 
sure the ventilation is adequate. If you do need to clean your oven, use a 
mixture of baking soda and water and spread it around the dirty spots. 
Wait until it dries; then wipe it away.
 
 Air fresheners: These don’t freshen air. They fool your nose into think-
ing the room is fresher. They don’t remove the odor-causing problem; 
they simply overwhelm it with superior force. So now your room is com-
pletely full of swirling chemicals. Use an air-filter instead, or, better yet, 
find out what’s causing the stink and get rid of it. Unless, of course, it’s 
Uncle Albert.
 
 Carpet: Particularly risky, especially if it’s old and dirty. In fact, carpet in 
general is a bad idea for people who are sensitive to chemical exposures 
of any kind.
 
 Aerosol sprays: Avoid these like the plague. Most household products 
that used to come in aerosol cans now come in misters, which are not 
quite as convenient and fun, but are much better for your family.
 
 Oil-based paints: Use latex paints instead. This makes life easier in a 
number of ways, in addition to health-wise.
 
 Art supplies: If you love to paint seascapes and gorgeous landscapes, 
find out what sorts of chemicals you’re breathing. You’re right over the 
work for extended periods, so even if the chemicals aren’t particularly 
strong, you’re dosing yourself up more than you would with just about 
any other hobby you can find. Make sure the area you work in is well 
ventilated.
 
 Ceramics: Especially ripe for airborne abuses. If you insist on making 
ceramic artwork, do a lot of research before you partake.
 
 Pesticides: Come on now, do you really need pesticides? Insects are 
ugly — some have thousands of legs and eyes and furry little tentacles. 
Many of them can sting and cause other problems, plus they fly around 
and distract you when you’re watching television. But the fact is, when 
you use pesticides you’re exposing yourself to the same chemicals that 
kill the insects. Do you think you’re any more immune to the assault 
than a bug? In fact, statistical studies have shown that the only differ-
ence between you and a bug is that you are bigger, although this may 
not be true in Florida.
 
 Any product that doesn’t list its contents on the label: Products made  
outside the United States, for instance. Manufacturers in the United 
States are required by law to list the contents of their products, but 
manufacturers elsewhere may not have to follow the same rules.
Minimizing the risk
Despite your best efforts, chances are you won’t be able to purge your home 
of all VOCs. In that case, you need to minimize the risk:

80
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
 
 Ventilation is imperative. Many noxious chemicals evaporate quickly, 
so exposure is only temporary. Always use glues and solvents in 
adequate ventilation. If possible, paint outdoors and leave whatever 
you’re painting there until the paint is very dry.
 
 Store paint, fuel, and pesticides well away from human habitats. Or 
better yet, don’t store them at all. Buy what you need and no more. Even 
containers that are sealed can still leak poisons. And admit it; when you 
seal a paint can and store it, you rarely, if ever, end up using the 
remainder. Most likely it just sits on the shelf until you move.
 
 Wear protective clothing, safety goggles, and masks with appropriate 
filters when necessary. Most of the stores where you purchase 
potentially toxic chemicals carry the appropriate equipment and can 
advise you accordingly. Work outside whenever possible.
 
 Trust your nose; it’s smarter than your brain. In general, your nose 
will tell you when something is noxious. Trust your senses, and when in 
doubt, back off, read the label, open some windows, and start up some 
fans. You can also do the following:
 
• If you have some item of indoor furniture that has a chemical 
smell, seal it with polyurethane varnish.
 
• If your clothes smell really strong when you get them back from 
the cleaners, find a different cleaner.
Alternatives to pesticides
To avoid pesticides, find other solutions. 
Following are some suggestions:
  Use steel wool to seal holes where insects 
come into your home. You can also use 
wood screws to cover holes.
  Screen off openings and keep your doors 
closed.
  Get used to the little buggers crawling 
around all over the place.
  Traps work well for mice, and you can get 
humane ones that don’t even harm the little 
beasts. Or you can use the standard type, 
which propel them into the next life lickety 
split.
  Houseplants are prime culprits for the 
growth of insect colonies. Banishing plants 
from your home is tough because they 
create such a nice ambience, so take good 
care of them and pay attention. I’ve been 
in homes where the plants were literally 
crawling away, and the owners didn’t even 
have a clue.
  Termiticides are the worst chemicals of all 
(probably because termites are the worst 
bugs of all, except for spiders that suspend 
themselves down from the ceiling right onto 
your forehead when you’re sleeping). Keep 
those inviting wood scraps away from your 
house, especially underneath, near the 
foundation. Keep firewood away from your 
house. Hire professionals to get rid of the 
termites, and take a vacation while they’re 
at it.

81
 Chapter 6: Keeping Your Home Free from Contaminants
 
 Never eat food while working with chemicals. This just makes the 
ingestion ten times worse. Also, never eat chemicals while working with 
food — this is somewhat intuitive.
 
 Never use paint stripper indoors without ventilation. Never. You may 
just as well drink a gallon of gasoline while playing with matches to 
accomplish the same end.
Asbestos
Asbestos has been used to provide heating and acoustical insulation and 
fireproofing, to strengthen building materials and make them more durable, 
to enhance the aesthetic value of a product, and even to make it easier to 
clean. Unfortunately, it’s very toxic.
Finding asbestos
Around the home, asbestos fibers can be found
 
 In gypsum wallboard, textured paint, joint compounds, and spackling 
compounds in older homes (pre-1970).
 
 In older homes in insulation used around pipes, as well as in the paper 
wrapped around the pipe insulation.
 
 In a lot of old appliances, which use asbestos for insulation. In par-
ticular, the seals around doors in old wood-burning stoves are almost 
always made of asbestos. As they get old and crumbly, they’re almost 
guaranteed to release fibers into the air.
 
 In siding shingles and sheet flooring, especially in older homes.
 
 In some kinds of floor tiles, particularly linoleum, which have asbestos 
backing. This is not a problem until you decide to remodel and remove 
the tiles.
 
 Sprayed onto walls and ceilings for both decoration and insulation.
 
 Spun or woven into textiles, blankets, curtains, ropes, and lamp wicks.
How can you tell whether you have an asbestos issue? It’s not easy, but if 
you’re suspicious, finding out for sure may be worth the trouble. Consult 
an expert (look up “asbestos” in the phone book). Or check with the U.S. 
Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Center for Science in the 
Public Interest.

82
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
Solving your asbestos problem
In the 1970s, asbestos was largely banned due to its correlation with certain 
types of cancer and other diseases. But fortunately, asbestos is only harmful 
when the fibers become airborne. Here’s what to do to make sure your 
asbestos stays grounded:
 
 Simply leave asbestos products alone. In particular, don’t gouge them 
or tear them apart. It’s the same as with mountain lions: Leave them 
alone and they’ll leave you alone.
 
 Cover them. This is often better than tearing them out and installing 
new materials. For instance, if you have a floor with asbestos, simply 
install a new floor over that. If you have asbestos siding, install new 
siding over it or paint it with a sealant type of paint (ask at your paint 
store; a number of options are available). If you have asbestos insulation 
on pipes and it’s starting to crumble, wrap it with a new coat of insula-
tion and then paint that with latex. You’ll have much better insulation, 
and you’ll have squelched the problem.
Removing asbestos
If you have to remove old asbestos products, the best bet is to hire a pro. 
Find one from a local environmental protection agency. If you do the job 
yourself:
 
 Dress appropriately. Absolutely get an approved asbestos mask from 
your hardware store. Wear it more than you think you should. A hat is a 
good idea, as well as clothes that cover all your skin. Plan on throwing 
the clothes away when you’re finished. And use rubber gloves — this is 
a real hassle, as your hands will sweat and you’ll lose most of your sense 
of touch. Too bad; you just have to suck it up for safety’s sake.
 
 Don’t forget your shoes. If you step on asbestos dust and then walk into 
other parts of your house, you’ll spread contaminants for sure. Dedicate 
a pair of old, throw-away shoes for the job and take them off when you 
leave the work area. Once you’re done, throw them away.
 
 Seal off the entire area and make sure it’s well ventilated. Before you 
do anything with the asbestos, seal the area with a floor-to-ceiling plas-
tic tarp and close the area off to other parts of your house. For ventila-
tion in the work area, your best bet is to have a fan operating, which 
refreshes the area with new air as well as carrying the dust-laden air out, 
where it disperses and doesn’t present a problem.
 
 Dampen the surfaces. Get a good plant mister and spray asbestos 
surfaces down with water before you work. This prevents most of the 
fibers from flying up into the air. Add some dish or laundry soap to the 
water for an even more effective solution.
 
 Don’t tear materials, and do not use a power saw. Use tin snips and be 
gentle.

83
 Chapter 6: Keeping Your Home Free from Contaminants
 
 Clean up asbestos dust by using a mop and throwing the mop away 
when you’re done. An alternative is to use a vacuum with a special 
asbestos filter. Don’t sweep with a broom.
 
 Store discarded asbestos items in plastic bags and take it to a recycling 
center. Don’t discard them in your normal trash. You’ll have to pay 
extra to take it to a recycling center, but you should do it to avoid 
exposing the sanitation workers to the very materials that you’re so 
deathly afraid of.
Cigarette smoke
Cigarette smoke is full of hostile chemicals. If you smoke, you know exactly 
what you’re doing to yourself and everybody around you, and I am not going 
to nag like everybody else is doing these days.
But consider this new angle (okay, so I’m nagging a little, but not like every-
body else): From an efficiency standpoint, smoking is about the worst thing 
you can possibly do because not only are you introducing health hazards 
into your home and everywhere else you go, you’re paying a hefty price for 
cigarettes at the same time. What do you get out of smoking? (Okay, I used to 
smoke; it was cool, and that first buzz is kind of dreamy. But this doesn’t last 
long. And then it quickly turns into little more than an addiction.)
At the very least, go outside and hide behind the garage or something.
Burning Up with Combustion Products
If you have a gas-burning furnace, a wood-burning fireplace or stove, a gas 
cooking stove, or gas water heaters (in other words, any type of combustion 
device) in your home, you need to take extra precautions. This is also true if 
you have an attached garage, where exhaust fumes may enter your home.
Carbon monoxide (CO) is an invisible, odorless gas that’s created by 
combustion (like carbon dioxide [CO2], its more newsworthy cousin). In a 
well-designed home, chimneys and vents carry these gases away.
CO alarms are simple, inexpensive insurance policies to warn you if CO gas is 
building up in your home. They cost between $20 and $45, and work 
essentially the same as a smoke detector: They emit a high, shrill squeal 
when they detect high levels of the gas.

84
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
Buy an alarm, or alarms, that are UL-approved. You can get a digital type 
that plugs into your home’s electrical outlet system and has a display that 
tells you what the concentrations are in your home. Even though the level in 
your home may be low enough for safety, you can see how the levels vary, 
and many times you can use this information to solve problems before they 
become extreme.
The best locations for CO alarms are near sleeping rooms on each level of 
your home. Position them away from drafts and solvents, which can 
inadvertently trigger a response.
If an alarm triggers, get everybody out of the house. Call your fire department 
and tell them what happened; then do what they tell you. Don’t ignore an 
alarm. Always find out why it went off, and solve the problem.
Natural Hazards
Unfortunately, manmade chemicals are not the only noxious chemicals you need 
to contend with in your home. Mother Nature has a few of her own dirty tricks. 
Slipping through the cracks: Radon
Radon can penetrate into a home when uranium is present in nearby soil or 
rock, thereby introducing radioactivity into your home. Granite, shale, and 
phosphate bedrock are the prime culprits, as well as gravel derived from 
these materials. The hazards of radon are the same as with exposure to any 
radioactive materials. Cancer is the worst.
Radon concentrates in basements where leaks through the foundation are 
common. The EPA did random tests across the entire country and found that 
up to 25 percent of all homes with basements are susceptible to radon 
poisons in potentially dangerous levels. Many states require radon tests to 
be performed when a home changes ownership.
The only way to know if a home is contaminated is to test, and a number 
of inexpensive means are available, the two most common being charcoal 
detectors and alpha-track devices.
 
 Charcoal detectors: You can find these on the Internet by entering 
“radon testing” into your browser. You place a charcoal detector in a 
cool, dry spot in your basement for no more than a week. Then you seal 
the container and send it to a lab. You need to repeat the test twice to 
get a good result. The cost is around $10 to $25 apiece.

85
 Chapter 6: Keeping Your Home Free from Contaminants
 
 Alpha-track devices: These give better results than charcoal detectors, 
and are recommended if your home fails the charcoal test. A strip of 
special plastic material is exposed to the air in your basement; then you 
send the plastic to a lab for analysis. Alpha-track devices require a 
minimum of four weeks of exposure but cost little more than the 
charcoal devices.
The good news is that, most of the time, radon infiltration can be contained 
rather easily. Two solutions exist: You can stop it from getting into the house, 
or you can dilute it once it gets in. When fresh air is imposed into a radon-
contaminated region, the levels go down immediately. For ways to restrict 
radon entry, consult a professional or see Chapter 7 on sealing your home. You 
can also search the Internet for solutions. Enter “radon contamination” into 
your search engine. At the very least, if you have a radon-contaminated 
basement, seal the doorway between the basement and the ground floor of 
your home. This is a good idea in general, as you will also be preventing other 
airborne biological agents (keep reading) from entering your living area.
Operating in secret: Biological agents
Natural microscopic organisms include bacteria, viruses, fungi, molds, 
mildews, and mites. Pollen is a collector of spores from seed-bearing plants. 
All these can be either tracked in on shoes and clothing from the outdoors, 
or simply fly in on the wings of chance. And all multiply indoors and can 
cause irritations and illnesses.
 
The greatest source of nutrition for indoor microbes is the three or four grams 
of skin that flake off of the average human body once every day. (Did you 
know that most of the dust in your home comes from human skin?)
Symptoms of sensitivity include the usual retinue of allergic reactions: runny 
nose, sneezing, watery eyes, sore throat, coughing, and upper respiratory 
discomfort. Hives and rashes are also common. Flu-like symptoms can result, 
including fever, chills, malaise, muscle aches, and chest tightness.
No easy-to-use kits are available to measure for microbe contamination. If 
your family seems to suffer from any of the above ailments more commonly 
when the house is closed up (and wet or humid), you should do a bit of 
investigating.
The first place to look? Wherever there’s water. Face it, water can be a big 
problem. Especially when left standing or combined with just enough warmth 
to create an oozy stew. Microbes love damp places. That’s why the biggest 
front in your war on biological agents is in the marshes — wherever there’s 
water. The following list tells you where to look and what to do to fix the 
problems you may find:

 Wet carpeting is a virtual breeding ground for all kinds of nasty little crit-
ters. If you have carpet in your bathroom, replace it with vinyl or tile, and 
make sure to seal the joints and edges extremely well. No carpet in the 
laundry room or kitchen, either. If you have area rugs, wash them in hot 
water occasionally or take them to the cleaners for thorough cleaning.
 
 Clothes dryers are hot and wet, perfect for microbe propagation. Make 
sure your dryer is vented well to the outdoors. If you have a leaky 
washing machine, especially if it’s in your basement and it is perpetually 
wet underneath, you have a microbe farm.
 
 Clean all drains once a week with a strong disinfectant. Microbes love 
the filthy, wet environment down in a drain. If you have a drain in the 
basement that seldom sees water flushed into it, it’s a prime candidate 
for a science-fiction movie.
 
 Repair all leaks in the roof or plumbing system. Leaks generally result in 
rotting wood or sheetrock. Not only does this cause contamination, but 
it also depreciates the value of your home.
 
 Repair leaky faucets. Every drop splashes and humidifies far more than 
you’d guess.
 
 Wet insulation materials are very fertile. If you have a leak in your roof 
or siding, you probably have wet insulation, which doesn’t work very 
well and encourages rot, mold and infestations.
 
 If you have leaks in your grout, you have wet, oozing sheetrock 
somewhere beneath. You can fix leaks in grout very easily with silicon 
caulking. The clear stuff matches any decor.
 
 Never allow water to pool, especially in your basement. Find and fix 
whatever problem is causing the water to pool.
 
 Fix leaky toilets. These are just asking for it. Not to mention the fact that 
you’re going to pay a lot more than you need to when you have to fix 
the rotted subflooring. And fuzzy toilet seat covers are simply nuts, if 
you value your health. (I could make a number of good jokes here, but I 
better not.)
 
 Install a vent (See Chapter 13) or a window in your bathroom. An 
enclosed bathroom with no ventilation equals microbe nirvana. You 
need to let your bathroom dry out thoroughly. Failing a vent or window, 
use a fan and keep the bathroom door open when not in use. Make sure 
the joints and cracks are sealed well.
 
Moisture is essential for microbe propagation. Reducing the humidity in your 
home is always a good idea if your family is sensitive to skin irritations. See 
Chapter 8 for more details on how to keep the humidity low in your house.

 Chapter 6: Keeping Your Home Free from Contaminants
Final Decluttering Tips
In an efficient home, there’s a place for everything, and everything is in its 
place. Keeping a home neat and trim is not too different from keeping your 
body neat and trim. The best results come from cutting down on excess 
consumption. Here are sundry tips to get you going in the right direction:
 
 Use the sun to clean and sanitize. Put cushions, sheets, rugs, clothes, 
and so forth out into the hot sun. To find out just how well this works, 
try putting a sweaty shirt in direct sunlight for a couple of hours. It’ll 
smell like new.
 
 Use stove vent fans. When grease mixes with dust in the air, it wafts 
around your kitchen and sticks. Over time, it makes a big mess.
 
 Avoid humidifiers, if possible. They encourage bugs and mildew.
 
 Make sure to keep a good-sized, rough mat at each door. When you 
come in, shed your shoes; put slippers by the door and change into 
them.
 
 Keep your plants healthy. Healthy plants clean the air. Fake plants are 
dust magnets, and they launch colonies.
 
 Seal the garage floor. This makes for a cleaner garage, with less dust 
buildup that would eventually make it into your home.
 
 Wax wood. Doing so keeps moisture from permeating into the grain and 
keeps the dust down.
 
 Use a battery-operated vacuum. It’s easy, lightweight, low-power, and 
you’ll use it more often because it’s less cumbersome. And make sure to 
change your vacuum cleaner bag. Full bags leak like crazy and waste a 
lot of energy to boot.
 
 Clean curtains without washing. Curtains don’t need to be washed. 
Instead, put them in a clothes dryer, turn the setting to no-heat, and 
tumble the dust out of them in a matter of minutes.
 
 Rent a high-pressure washer for exterior grime and dust. Your entire 
house, inside and out, will be cleaner.

ou probably spend more energy on heating and cooling than you do on 
all the other energy-consuming functions combined. This means the 
greatest potential for energy savings lies in finding ways to make your heating 
and cooling efforts more efficient. In Chapter 8, I get into details about how 
to make your heating and cooling equipment run better and how to choose 
better equipment if you’re in the mind-set to invest. But in this chapter, I 
show you how to seal and insulate your home.
Here is where you can find the biggest energy-efficiency improvements for 
the least amount of cash and labor on your part. Most homes have problems 
that can be fixed for $100 or less — in fact, sometimes all you need to invest 
is a little time and labor.
Finding Leaks
By knowing where to look for heat loss, you can get a pretty good idea of 
where to find the problem spots in your own home. Table 7-1 lists the energy 
losses from heating and cooling equipment in a typical North American 
home. (Note: The first table entry refers to heat escaping or coming in 
through gaps. The other entries refer to heat moving through solid masses, 
like doors, walls, and so on.)

Table 7-1 gives you a rough idea of where to look for problems and the order 
in which you should look for them. You can perform a leak test (as I describe 
shortly) to find the biggest and worst offenders: air leaks through holes in 
sheetrock and through hatches or trapdoors that lead into your attic or 
basement. The next logical place to look for leaks is in your doors and 
windows, and so on down the list.
Looking for cracks in your home
You can find a majority of leaks by simply taking a flashlight around your 
home and looking with a keen eye. Here are some details:
 
 Look at faucets, pipes, electrical wiring, and electric outlets. Cracks 
often exist around the junctions where pipes fit through foundations and 
siding. You can fix these with caulk (see the later section “Caulking your 
way to Nirvana” for advice on caulking).
 
 Check all interfaces between two different building materials. For 
example, check where brick or siding meets the roof and the foundation. 
Check where all corners meet and around the molding strips that are 
commonly used in corners of walls and between walls and floors. And so 
on. Plug all holes and voids with caulk.
 
 Pay attention to where icicles develop. If they cluster around a particu-
lar location at your house, you have a leak somewhere above that’s 
melting snow. It warms, drips down, then refreezes into icicles. These 
are usually pretty good-sized leaks.
 
 Look for cracks in mortar, foundations, siding, and so on.
 
 Check for cracks and voids around exterior doors and windows.
 
 Check storm windows for seal integrity. The interior window may be 
well-sealed, but the storm window will work better if it’s also sealed 
just as well. To work properly, storm windows must fit tightly into the 
brackets. The way to ensure a tight seal is to check the weather 
stripping materials commonly fit into the gaps.

 Chapter 7: Sealing and Insulating Your Home
How heat moves
Heat is a form of energy. When a substance 
gets hotter, the molecules in that substance 
are moving faster, with more energy. When a 
substance gets cooler, heat is moving out of 
it into other nearby substances. The reason a 
hot substance can burn your skin is that heat 
moves very quickly in some cases.
Heat moves out of your home in the winter and 
into it in the summer — exactly what you don’t 
want. That’s why sealing your home is a good 
way to improve your energy efficiency. So how 
does heat move from one spot to another? Via 
the mechanisms explained in the following 
sections.
  Convection: In convection, heat is either 
transferred between a surface and a 
moving fluid (be it liquid, gas, or even the air 
itself), or it’s transferred by the movement 
of molecules from one point to another. 
As opposed to conduction (see the next 
item), the hot molecules themselves move. 
Convection causes hot air to rise while cold 
air gravitates downward. Most people have 
heard of convection ovens; these work 
by using a fan inside the oven cavity to 
move the air and cook food faster. Cold air 
passing over a window removes heat from a 
home through convection. Wind in general 
causes a lot of convection loss. But all air is 
moving because the molecules are always 
moving, so even air that seems to be still is 
capable of a lot of convection. That’s why 
convection is the most common culprit of 
heat loss in your home.
  Conduction: In conduction, only the heat 
moves, not the molecules. The material 
remains static while the energy moves 
through it. This is the analogous to billiard 
balls, where kinetic energy is transferred 
from one ball to another, without moving the 
balls themselves. Heat can move through 
window glass via conduction. Window 
frames are also prone to conduction 
heat loss (particularly aluminum or metal 
frames), as are metal doors. And metal 
pipes are great heat conductors, too.
  Radiation: A hot object emits infrared 
radiation, any form of light energy, 
whether visible or not. The sun is a perfect 
radiator. Fires radiate heat, some of which 
you can see (a very hot fire glows white, for 
example, and as it cools down the color 
changes to orange, and then red) and most 
of which is invisible. When you can’t see 
the embers anymore but can still feel the 
heat, the radiation is entirely infrared. In 
fact, there is far more invisible radiation 
than visible, but both versions are capable 
of heating. When you put blinds over your 
windows, you are keeping radiant heat from 
entering your home. On the other hand, 
when you raise the blinds to let in winter 
sunshine, you’re inviting radiant heat.
 
 Radiation is more of a problem in the 
summer, when you want to keep your 
home cool by keeping sunshine out than in 
the winter when you’re trying to retain hot 
air (assuming you live in a climate where 
the temperature varies with the seasons). 
In the winter, you generally seek as much 
radiation heating as you can get.

Performing a pressure test to find air leaks
You can perform a pressure test on your home in rudimentary fashion. As I 
state in Chapter 3, you can hire a pro to do an audit that includes a detailed 
leak test, but you can do an easy one that’s 80 percent as effective. The best 
time to do this test is when it’s cold outside and warm inside, although it will 
work under any conditions if you have patience and tenacity.
To conduct a leak test, follow these steps:
 
1. Completely extinguish any fireplace fires.
 
 Close the fireplace damper as much as possible.
 
2. Turn off your HVAC system and any furnaces.
 
 If you have a gas water heater, turn that off, too.
 
3. Close all the windows and doors in your home.
 
 Also make sure to close any skylights or vents.
 
4. Turn on all the exhaust fans in your home.
 
 These are normally located in kitchens, bathrooms, and laundry rooms. 
If you don’t have any exhaust fans, aim a portable fan out a single open 
window and turn it on. With the fans on, your house is depressurized, so 
any leaks will be readily apparent.
 
5. Go around the house with a bowl of water, dip your hand in the 
water, and move your wet hand around the area you’re testing.
 
 You’ll be able to feel a leak, especially if it’s cold outside. Another way 
to do this is with a stick of incense — when the smoke fluctuates, you’ve 
found a leak. Or you can use a candle — in this case, flickering of the 
flame indicates a leak.
 
 Test the following areas and make a list of all the areas where you find leaks:
 
• Test your fireplace. If it’s leaky, you’ll be drawing in some stink. If 
so, turn the fans off and inspect your fireplace to find out why it’s 
so leaky. If you can, fix it. If not, forge ahead if the smell isn’t too 
bad. If the smell is really bad, call a fireplace specialist.
 
 Fixing air leaks around your fireplace is vitally important. You don’t 
want to pull in air from your fireplace because it contains a number 
of pollutants and volatile chemical compounds (see Chapter 6).
 
• Test windows, doors, molding interfaces, attic hatches, basement 
hatches, and so forth.
 
• Get a ladder or a chair and check for leaks in overhead lights. 
These are very common, but unfortunately a little more difficult to 
fix if you don’t have good attic access.
 
• Check AC outlets and switch plates.

93
 Chapter 7: Sealing and Insulating Your Home
 
6. After you’ve tested all the areas of your house, turn the fans off, and 
then fix the leaks.
 
 I get into details on how to fix leaks in the section “Fixing the Leaks You 
Find” later in this chapter, but here’s an important safety tip that bears 
repeating: If you find a leak in an outlet or switch, flip the main circuit 
breaker off to turn the electricity off in the entire house before you fix 
it. You’ll have to reset your clocks, but you’ll be alive to do it, so don’t 
complain.
 
7. Once you’ve finished fixing leaks, turn the exhaust fans back on and 
repeat the wet-hand routine.
 
 Your house will be tighter now, and any remaining leaks will be even 
more obvious.
 
8. Repeat the whole process until you’re satisfied.
Finding attic air leaks
Attic air leaks are quite common. Following is a simple pressurization test 
that helps you locate air leaks in your attic as well as other air leaks through 
your ceiling:
 
1. Completely extinguish any fireplace fires.
 
 Close the fireplace damper as much as possible.
 
2. Turn off your HVAC system, any furnaces, and if you have one, your 
gas water heater.
 
3. Close all the windows, doors, and any skylights or vents in your home.
 
4. Position a portable fan so that it aims into the house through an open 
window.
 
 Now your house is pressurized (as opposed to depressurized).
 
5. Go into the attic with a bowl of water, dip your hand in the water, and 
then move your hand around potential leak sites.
 
 With a wet hand, you’ll be able to easily feel the air pushing through 
from the inside of your house. Pay particular attention to these areas:
 
• The hatch you climbed through to get to the attic. See the later 
section, “Weatherstripping,” for details on how to fix this.
 
• Recessed lights in the rooms below. Simply turn the lights on and, 
from up in the attic space, look to see whether light is visible. If so, 
you have a leak. You can fix it by buying a special kit at your hardware 
store that fits over the light from the top and seals the space.
 
• Around chimneys. If your chimney flue is not sealed, you likely 
have a leak here.

94
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
The good news is that most attic leaks are straightforward, if not easy, to fix. 
On the down side, most attics are a hassle to move around in, and some are 
just plain dangerous.
 
If you climb into the attic to check for leaks or to fix things like leaks in your 
overhead light fixtures, you’ll find out what it’s like to be a human pretzel. 
Although you may not be able to avoid contorting yourself into all sorts of odd 
positions, you can take these steps to keep the mess down and make your trek 
up there more bearable and safe (attics are notoriously cold in winter and hot 
in summer):
 
 Do it in the morning when it’s cool.
 
 Wear a lightweight, disposable coverall (from the paint department).
 
 Wear a dust mask or particulate respirator.
 
 Wear knee pads, which you can get at any hardware store.
 
 Use a flashlight that clamps around your head and shines down onto 
your work.
 
 Plan ahead. Stage the job before you try it so you’ll know which tools 
you need, and take the right tools up with you.
 
 Be careful where you step. Otherwise, you may fall through the ceiling.
Fixing the Leaks You Find
When your windows are all open, your home is basically a part of Mother 
Nature’s fantastic domain. When you shut your windows and doors, it’s 
another matter entirely — unless your house isn’t well sealed. Some 
windows, for example, let in a lot of air, even when they’re closed. Same with 
doors. And electrical outlets can leak air as well, just as can the light fixtures 
in your ceiling. Therefore, you can improve energy efficiency just by closing 
up these gaps. In this section, I present some valuable tips on how best to fix 
leaks. There are basically three kinds of fixes: weatherstripping, caulking, and 
expandable foam. All three have their time and place.
 
When sealing any home, be careful about indoor air pollution and combustion 
appliance back drafts. Back drafting occurs when the various combustion appli-
ances and exhaust fans in a home have to compete for air because there simply 
isn’t enough to go around. An exhaust fan may pull combustion gases back 
into the living space, for example, in which case you want to make sure you are 
ventilating combustion gases into the great outdoors rather than your home’s 
interior. If your home burns fuel, you can avoid back drafts by making sure that 
the combustion system has an adequate air supply. (One way to tell whether 
your home is sealed too tightly is to note whether you get condensation on your 
windows during the winter. If so, you don’t have adequate ventilation.) Go to 
Chapter 13 for more information about how to adequately ventilate your home.

95
 Chapter 7: Sealing and Insulating Your Home
Weatherstripping
Weatherstripping works great around doors and windows and where seals 
can’t be made permanent (as with caulking). The trick is to get the right stuff, 
and the best way to do this is to take a sample of the existing seal (if there 
is one) to your local hardware store, where the salespeople will be able to 
sell you the appropriate new material. Foam and wrapped foam (a layer of 
vinyl or plastic wrapped around a foam core) are usually best and cheapest. 
Whatever weatherstripping you buy, be sure to follow the directions on the 
label. Here are a few other suggestions to make weatherstripping a breeze:
 
 Make sure to measure how much length you need before you buy. And if 
you end up with too little, don’t stretch the material: It’ll pull back over 
time and come loose.
 
 If you can, buy a kit to seal a door or window straight from the 
manufacturer of that door or window.
 
 The biggest culprits for air leaks are double-wide sliding doors, and the 
seals for these usually are best purchased straight from the manufacturers 
because they’re very specific to a particular style of door.
 
 If you can’t buy the same type of weatherstripping (because it’s no 
longer available, for example), have no fear. Weatherstripping is pretty 
versatile stuff. You may need to use your imagination to figure out ways 
to cut it to fit into strange spaces, in which case you’ll find that a good, 
sharp box-cutting knife is just the thing.
 
 Sometimes shutting a door or window right after weatherstripping has 
been applied is difficult, but this usually tapers off in a week or two. If it 
doesn’t, give it another week or two. If that doesn’t do the trick, get out 
the ubiquitous box-cutter and hack away.
 
 Most garage doors have a rubber seal on the bottom called an astragal. 
These are expensive, but in some cases they can make a big difference 
in your home’s comfort. If your garage is well sealed from the home, you 
probably don’t have to worry about this seal. But if you get drafts or 
your garage is perpetually cold, changing the seal may be worth it.
Expandable foam sealant
Expandable foam sealant is great stuff and horrid stuff, all at once. Via a long, 
straw-like wand, you squirt a yellowish foamy liquid into tight spots where 
there are air and insulation gaps. The foam expands and fills in the gap, and 
then it dries, hardens, and solidifies. Very effective. The problem is that 
expandable foam sealant sticks to everything, and nothing works very well to 
get it off. So a bit of a mess can easily turn into a big mess, accompanied by 
a lot of swearing and remorse (two things you want to avoid in the name of 
efficiency).

96
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
 
If you’re going to use an expandable foam sealant, practice first out in your 
garage, a barn, or an outbuilding before you try to fix anything inside your 
house. You’ll quickly figure out how to work with it and how not to work, and 
you can also get the swearing part out of the way, which is especially wise if 
you have kids around.
Foam sealant works best for:
 
 Leaks between jambs and wood: Remove the trim molding from around 
leaking windows and doors, and you’ll often find an air gap between the 
jamb and the frame wood. Squirt foam sealant in the gaps, wait until it 
dries, cut off the excess with a sharp knife, and then replace the trim 
molding. Many old houses benefit greatly from this simple, cheap fix.
 
 Plumbing feed-throughs: Squirt foam in the gaps around plumbing feed-
throughs (where the plumbing goes through exterior walls to the outside 
world).
 
 Plumbing vent pipes: Squirt foam around plumbing vent pipes that pass 
through your attic.
 
 Small gaps in insulation: Squirt foam into any small gaps in insulation to 
stop air leaks.
In general, if you can, use foam sealant instead of caulking because it pro-
vides both a seal and insulation.
Caulking your way to Nirvana
Caulking is fun. Squirting beads of thick, sticky goo just seems to resonate 
with the human spirit. So get out your caulking gun, because caulk can be 
used in a lot of places:
 
 Around all exterior joints that may be in contact with water.
 
 Around doors, windows, decks, frames, and anywhere wind can push 
water in.
 
 On horizontal surfaces where water may pool and seep in over time.
 
 Wherever you think water can’t get in (because it can, and it will).
 
 Around your teenager’s bedroom door (because heaven knows the trouble 
a teen can get into when out of your sight).
 
 When in doubt, caulk. Why not?
As fun as caulking may be, you still need to know a few fundamentals to make 
the job easier. I explain these in the following sections.

97
 Chapter 7: Sealing and Insulating Your Home
Getting the right tools
Buy a good caulking gun. A pro-style gun may cost $20, but it’s worth it, 
especially if you’re doing a lot of caulking. Look for larger handles, a smooth 
ratcheting action, pressure relief, and a hook on the end to hang on ladder 
rungs or rafters. An attached wire that pokes a hole in the tube’s seal is 
especially convenient.
Use good-quality caulk. Three types are available:
 
 Acrylic (latex): Water-based and by far the most common. It skins over 
(dries on the surface) almost immediately, so you can paint it within 
minutes of applying (with latex paint, not oil-based).
 
 Silicon acrylic: More flexible (and expensive). Use this type if you’re 
caulking between two surfaces that may expand and contract with weather. 
Make sure to get the kind that you can paint, if that’s what you intend to do.
 
 Polyurethane: Performs better than latex but is much more difficult to 
work with and clean up. Use it between concrete, masonry, bricks, or on 
a surface that’s been painted by oil-based paints or varnish. Because it 
has better adhesion, you may also want to use it on surfaces, such as on 
roof lines, where a leak could be potentially costly.
 
All caulk is rated by years, but don’t use the amount of time you want it to last 
as a guide; instead, buy the best stuff you can afford. Fifty-year caulk works 
better than 20-year over the course of its entire lifetime. If you must use the 
cheap stuff, use it where nobody will ever see it and where you need to simply 
build up mass to fill a space or void.
Applying the caulk
The key to success is in the application. The idea is not to squirt as much 
material into a joint as possible, but to lay a nice smooth bead across a joint. 
Follow these steps:
 
1.  Prepare the base by cleaning the surface to be caulked.
 
 Dig out any old caulk with a putty knife or a 5-in-1 tool (you can get these 
at a hardware store; ask the clerk in the paint department). If possible, 
work some paint primer (latex) into the groove where you’re going to 
squirt caulk. However, if you’re caulking surfaces such as concrete, brick, 
or any other masonries, use “self-priming” caulk instead.
 
2. Run a smooth ribbon of caulk along the joint you want to seal.
 
 Try to avoid laying down thick blobs of caulk, which tend to crack when 
they dry.
 
3. Run your finger along the caulk and press it gently down and into the 
joint; then wipe away the excess with a damp cloth.
 
 Don’t use paper towels because they tear and fray, and watch out for 
sharp little shards of paint or cracked materials that can cut your fingers.

98
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
Here are some suggestions for getting a nice, smooth bead:
 
 If you’re a first-time caulker, practice in a place where mistakes can be 
tolerated.
 
 Cut the caulk tube ends at an angle to get a better beading action. You can 
also cut the tube ends of several tubes to squirt out different diameters of 
material, and then use the diameter which best suits the particular joint 
you’re working on.
 
 Don’t squirt a bunch of caulk into a wide gap because it simply won’t stick 
in there when it dries (caulk inevitably shrinks and cracks when it dries). 
Use foam backer rods (ask for these in your hardware store), which you 
can jam into wide gaps between materials. Then caulk over the backer rods.
 
 You can use painters’ masking tape to block off surfaces you don’t want 
to get any caulk on, as well as to make nice, crisp, even lines.
 
 To get into hard-to-reach corners and tight spots, tape a flexible drinking 
straw onto the tip of your caulking gun.
Inspecting and Repairing HVAC Ducts
Most of the HVAC ducts in your home send heated or cooled air into the 
house; one large duct is the return to the HVAC machine itself. All these ducts 
need to be tightly sealed. Yet in almost every home I’ve been in, especially 
older ones, the HVAC duct system has some big problems: shredded 
insulation, broken junctions, holes chewed through insulation and ducts by 
rats and mice, and so on.
 
Leaks in the ductwork are worse than air leaks in your house because the 
ducts are pressurized, which magnifies the amount of air escaping through 
cracks and openings.
Fortunately, duct problems are usually easy to find and fix (although gaining 
access may be tricky). It’s amazing how many problems you can find with 
just a flashlight and a quick glance. You can also turn the HVAC on, so that 
the ducts are pressurized, and find leaks with a wet hand (refer to the earlier 
section “Performing a pressure test to find leaks” for instructions). Follow 
these bits of advice:
 
 If the ducts aren’t well insulated, you can get a number of different kinds 
of insulation sealing kits at hardware stores to do the job. Tell your 
hardware clerk what kind of ducts you have (what they’re made of, how 
they’re suspended, and so on) and he’ll help you find the right kit.
 
 If the insulation around the ducts has any rips or tears, fix it. For this, 
duct tape works well but may be a real hassle. Once again, ask your 
hardware clerk what will work best.

 Chapter 7: Sealing and Insulating Your Home
 
 If the insulation is thin, you may want to build it up. You can add a new 
layer directly over the old.
 
 Many leaks occur at the junction between the ducts and the registers 
that feed the air into your home. You can seal these with caulk.
When working with dusty ducts, wearing a good-quality dust mask is highly 
recommended. You can get one at your hardware store.
 
Duct tape works wonders, but it doesn’t stick to dusty surfaces very well. If 
you’ve got a dust problem, wrap the duct tape around and around and just 
cover up the dust. It’s easier than trying to clean it off.
Insulating Your Home (Not Insulting It)
The previous sections in this chapter deal with things that are responsible 
for convection losses, where warm (or cool) air escapes from your home. 
The other way to experience unwanted heat loss is through conduction, and 
that’s where insulation comes into play. A well insulated house is 
comfortable and efficient, with just enough moisture in the air.
If your insulation is less than three inches thick, it’s probably worth spending 
money to increase the R-value. If your insulation is over three inches, you 
should probably spend your money on some other efficiency improvement.
 
Capacity to resist heat flow is called R-value. County building codes have 
minimum R-values for homes, and you can check with them to find out what’s 
right for your area. You can also get more information on insulation levels 
from your local utility, who may come out and do a home energy audit for you 
and check your insulation so that you don’t have to (they’ll usually do these 
audits for free, and they know what they’re doing).
 
Insulation is generally an expensive fix that you should address only after 
you’ve taken care of air leaks. So if you haven’t tested your house for air leaks, 
refer to the earlier sections “Finding Air Leaks” and “Fixing the Leaks Your 
Find”; then come back to this section.
Types of insulation
There are dozens of different types of insulation schemes, but for most 
homes only a few are practical. The vast majority of homes use fiberglass 
insulation, and most people have a good idea of what this stuff looks like 
(cotton candy). In a distant second comes foam board, a type of insulation 
that is generally used when a home is being constructed. If you’re remodeling 
or improving existing insulation, you’ll probably use some form of fiberglass.

100
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
The best bet is to discuss your plans with the salespeople at your favorite 
hardware store and ask them what type of insulation is best for your application.
 
Owens Corning is the leading manufacturer of insulation. Visit its Web site at 
www.owenscorning.com to determine the number of square feet of material 
you’ll need to insulate an attic or a wall in your home. Also check out www.
certainteed.com.
The following sections describe the most common types of insulation, along 
with the pros and cons of each.
Fiberglass
Fiberglass, which is made of glass fibers, comes in at an R-rating of R-3 to 3.8 
per inch (thickness). Fiberglass is by far the most common type of insulation, 
and it is what you should use if you can. It’s readily available and comes in 
spun rolls which you can easily cut and lay into place.
 
 Pros: It’s low-cost, easy to install (once you get the hang of cutting and 
placing it into the gaps), and can be pressed into place without the use 
of glues or chemicals. It comes in standard widths and is available with 
kraft paper backing, which also provides a moisture seal.
 
 Cons: It’s very irritating to your skin and lungs and is susceptible to air 
gaps. When you get big plastic bags full of it, and cut the plastic packaging 
off, it expands to three or four times the size and is difficult to move around 
and place.
Loose-fill insulation
Loose fill insulation is chopped fiberglass material that is “blown” into place, 
as opposed to cut and fitted. It comes in at an R-rating of R-2.2 to R-4 per inch.
 
 Pros: It’s low-cost and gives much better coverage in irregular spaces 
where the one-piece fiberglass format doesn’t fit well. It can be poured 
or blown into walls and odd spaces, which makes working with it much 
easier than fiberglass.
 
 Cons: It’s messy, and the quality varies even within the same lot. It can 
shift or settle over time so that gaps may grow rather large. You can’t 
use it for under floors without a complex web of nets, which are not 
worth the hassle. Depending on the size of the job, you may need to rent 
a special blower.
Extruded foam insulation
Extruded foam insulation is solid, rigid material made of the same type of 
foam as a drinking cup. It comes in flat sheets, with an R-rating around R-5.2 
per inch.

101
 Chapter 7: Sealing and Insulating Your Home
 
 Pros: It’s high-strength, easy to tack up, covers well, and works underground 
and in wet basements. It’s good for covering a house, then tacking up siding 
over it.
 
 Cons: It’s very expensive and needs to be covered up with siding.
Sprayed urethane foam
Sprayed urethane foam is held in a metal container, under pressure, and then 
force sprayed onto walls where it sticks. It comes in at an R-value between 
R-6 and R-7.3 per inch.
 
 Pros: It forms a tough, seamless barrier that seals well over all types of 
surfaces, especially irregular ones.
 
 Cons: It must be professionally installed, and it needs to be covered up.
Checking and fixing your 
home’s insulation
Visually check insulation wherever you can. Most gaps will be readily evident. 
Also look for spots where water has damaged insulation or spots where the 
insulation is very thin. Small problems, like gaps or voids in your insulation, 
usually occur around light fixtures and where somebody (like an electrician 
or plumber) has been working and pushed it aside. You can fix these voids by 
hand tucking some loose insulation into the gaps.
 
If you find your insulation wholly inadequate, you’ve got a big decision on 
your hands. Putting in new insulation is expensive — the payback time is 
going to be way out there. But if you don’t, you’ll continue to waste money and 
leave a big carbon footprint.
 
If you’re on a limited budget and want to make the biggest difference for the 
least cost, insulate your family room (or the room you spend the most time 
in) first. In particular, if you don’t have any insulation under your family room 
floor, adding insulation there is usually easy to do and doesn’t cost that much. 
You’ll get the biggest bang for your buck.
The following sections outline the different areas to check and explain how to 
remedy the problems you may find.
Attic
Insulation makes the most difference in the attic simply because heat rises. If 
no heat can leak out of your home through the attic, your home will be very 
well sealed.

102
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
The easiest thing to do is have the insulation in the attic thickened. You can 
do this yourself (use a dust mask at all times), or you can find a company to 
come in and spray loose fill insulation. Unfortunately, when the insulation in 
your attic is substandard, it’s most likely also substandard in the walls. See 
the next section.
 
Completely seal up the attic for air leaks from the home before you apply 
insulation because once the insulation is in place, taking care of attic leaks is 
much more difficult.
Walls
Substandard insulation in your walls is not as easy to remedy as substandard 
insulation in your attic. The best bet may be to simply put new siding on the 
outside of your house. You can get good-looking siding with great insulation 
properties, and at least when you spend money like this, you can accomplish 
a visual remodel as well.
Basement
If you have a basement, check to see whether the ceiling is insulated. If 
not, putting insulation in is a relatively easy job, probably even easier than 
working in your attic.
If you need to insulate a basement, it’s usually best to use foam sheets and 
then cover them with sheetrock. You can either glue the sheets directly onto 
the concrete basement walls, or build a wall up with 2 × 4s, which will make 
the room smaller.
Insulating old homes
In some old homes, it pays to blow loose fill 
insulation into the walls. Normally this works 
when the existing insulation is so poor that air 
gaps are more common than insulation. Sound 
absurd? It’s a lot more common than you think. 
Some homes have no insulation at all, like the 
old homes back east. Energy was so cheap (ah, 
the good old days) that insulation was not cost-
effective.
Having a pro do an energy audit of your home to 
get a second opinion is a good idea. If you decide 
to go ahead, you’ll need to rent a blower, which 
will come with detailed instructions. You’ll need 
to cut a number of two- or three-inch-diameter 
holes through your exterior siding so that the 
blower head can get into each individual cavity 
between the beams.
A better way may be to simply cover your home 
with insulation sheets, and then cover that with 
new siding. This way, not only do you get the 
added insulation, but your home also gets a 
nice facelift.

103
 Chapter 7: Sealing and Insulating Your Home
Pipes
Hot water pipes should be well insulated. It’s easy to see when they’re not. 
You can also feel the pipes (after you’ve turned the hot water on in the house 
for a minute or two) to determine which pipes are for hot water and which 
ones are for cold. A number of easy options work well for insulating pipes, 
the easiest being a three-foot-long foam section with a longitudinal slit. You 
simply slide the piece over the pipe, and you’re in business. Ask about your 
options at the hardware store.
Tips for applying insulation
Putting in insulation isn’t particularly difficult, but it can go more easily if you 
keep a few things in mind.
 
 With fiberglass insulation, wear a one-piece jumpsuit, along with a 
face mask and gloves, and make sure ventilation is adequate before 
you begin. You don’t want to breathe a lot of fiberglass dust, and you 
don’t want to get it on your skin because you’ll be scratching up a 
storm. Also, in old attics, the dust that collects on insulation can be very 
nasty. Try not to disturb it, if possible.
 
 Fiberglass insulation is itchy. Some versions come with plastic covers 
to reduce the risk of itch – if you’re really sensitive, look for these.
 
 Apply insulation carefully and evenly. Fill entire cavities, but be careful 
not to cover up vents or other means for attics and basements to breathe.
 
 When you come across electrical wires, arrange half of the insulation 
in front of them, and half behind. You will have to tear the insulation 
open, but this works much better than leaving big air gaps without any 
material at all.
 
 If you leave a gap unfilled, you’re wasting money. Filling only 80 percent 
of a cavity prevents only 20 percent of the heat loss.
 
 Always buy the right width and thickness to fill spaces. You don’t want 
to piece insulation together to fit a space if you don’t have to, because 
you risk creating air gaps. Still, you can press fiberglass insulation tight 
into narrow gaps and cracks, and it will perform better than nothing at 
all even though it’s compressed a bit. (Using expandable foam is best, 
but this may not always be practical, and it’s not worth a lot of extra 
hassle.)
 
 Compressing insulation reduces its R-value. When you squeeze it down 
to make it fit into gaps, you’re accomplishing the opposite of what you 
intend. You’re actually reducing the effectiveness of the insulation. So 
press it down only when necessary.

104
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
 
 You can get one-piece seals for plugs and switch outlets for about $4 a 
dozen at your hardware store. Simply remove the plastic cover, set a 
seal into place, and replace the cover.
 
 If you have moisture problems in your home, you may want vapor 
barrier facing on the insulation (it comes prefaced on some versions, 
so look for that type when you buy). It doesn’t cost much more, and it 
makes the insulation easier to work with to boot.
 
Use hedge shears to cut insulation, not a knife.
Working with Windows
Of all the investments you can make in your home, windows have the 
potential to make the most impact. Not only do they provide insulation (and 
sealing), but they also affect the aesthetic ambient like nothing else in your 
home. But installing new windows is very expensive, maybe one of the most 
expensive projects you’ll ever take on. A typical residential window costs 
anywhere from $150 to $400, plus another $100 to $300 for professional 
installation. And you can easily spend a lot more than this.
 
If you have very poor insulation in your home and you’re looking for the 
biggest bang for your buck, you’re better off improving the insulation before 
buying new windows. See the earlier section “Insulating Your Home (Not 
Insulting It)” for details on insulation.
Do you really need to replace your windows? Answer these questions:
 
 Are your windows single pane? This may not matter, or it may be a 
huge factor in your energy bill. With homes in mild climates, the number 
of panes doesn’t matter much. However, if you’re living in extreme 
climates, single pane windows are almost always worth upgrading. 
Besides, single pane windows are always old, and you can buy some-
thing better looking.
 
 Are your windows old? Old windows can be especially problematic. If 
they’re difficult to maneuver, you’re less apt to open and close them, 
and you lose out on some of the ventilation tricks I detail in Chapter 13.
Simple, inexpensive solutions 
for problem windows
If you have substandard windows (basically, any windows you don’t like or 
aren’t performing well for you), you can always use blinds to help solve the 

105
 Chapter 7: Sealing and Insulating Your Home
problem. In this way, you also get a nice aesthetic effect as well. See Chapter 
12 for more details on how to use sunlight to warm up a room.
 
You don’t need to change all the windows in your house to make a significant 
improvement. One single, large window in a family or living room may make 
a big difference in both energy efficiency and aesthetic beauty. Or maybe a 
couple rooms’ worth of windows, like the breakfast nook, the living room, and 
the family room, will do the trick. You can also put up heat-sealing cloth 
barriers in the summer or storm windows in the winter, and both of these 
solutions are much cheaper than changing windows. 
Replacing windows
Before you replace windows, take your time researching all the options. Visit 
some window stores and check out the different types, like wood, plastic, 
fiber, and so forth (you’ll probably be confounded by the variety), and get a 
number of bids. In particular, pay attention to the following:
 
 Glass: Ask about different types. Some glass selectively filters sunlight 
for UV; some has low-E coating and argon gas between panes.
 
 Appearance: Does the style blend in well with your existing home 
decor? Do the colors match your home, or are you going to be painting?
 
 You can get windows that require paint so that they’ll match anything, 
but you don’t want to because every five years you’ll have a big, tedious 
job. (Painting windows is very time-consuming. You can’t just roller — 
or even spray — it on).
 
 Cleaning: Are they easy to maneuver so that you can clean them? A lot 
of new window designs enable you to clean from the inside. This is par-
ticularly handy for second-story windows.
 
 Operation: Are the windows smooth and easy to open and close? It pays 
to invest in quality bearings and movements. No one wants to have to 
remember a complicated schematic just to let in a little summer breeze.
 
 Maintenance: Where are you going to get parts when you need them?
 
 Warranties: The seal between double-pane glass inevitably gives out, so 
make sure you understand who is going to pay for this expensive repair.

M
ost homes have both heating and cooling systems. Together, these 
account for a large portion of your total energy use. (To find out just 
how much of your energy consumption is devoted to heating and cooling your 
home, do a home energy audit. Refer to Chapter 3 for details.) In Chapter 7, 
I show how to seal and insulate your house so that when you turn on your 
heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system, you can maintain a 
comfortable environment with less energy. In this chapter, I give you general 
advice about how to use your equipment more efficiently.
Note: This chapter doesn’t present specific details on how to tune up your 
existing equipment for several reasons:
 
 Far too many different types of systems are available — so many that 
this book doesn’t have enough room to include even the most common 
ones.
 
 Many adjustments involve quite a bit of technology and require the 
expertise of a pro.
 
 Combustion systems are inherently dangerous, and you don’t want to 
mess around with them. Call a pro instead.

Understanding Human Comfort
Human comfort is not simply determined by room temperature, but by a 
variety of other factors as well, such as air movement, humidity level, and so 
on. Yet most people still erroneously think that the best way to make a room 
more livable is to set the desired room temperature on the thermostat. You 
can do much better than this, of course, if you’re willing to learn some tricks 
and change a few habits. This section explains the factors that affect how 
comfortable a room feels and offers a few pointers on how to exploit these 
factors so that you can use your HVAC less frequently and still maintain — or 
even enhance — the comfort level in your home.
Getting air moving
In the summer, people like the feel of air moving over their skin. Just the 
phrase “summer breeze” generates a cool sensation. Even a warm breeze on 
a hot day can cool things down. That’s because it’s not air temperature that’s 
important, but the actual temperature of your skin. Moving air removes heat, 
so skin temperature goes down. Essentially, a breeze cools you by convec-
tion (see Chapter 7).
Fans move air and, in the process, cool you down. They don’t change the air 
temperature (if anything, they make the air hotter), but their effect is still 
pronounced. Fans, like breezes, cool by convection. You can make a room 
more comfortable just by installing fans to improve the ventilation (see 
Chapter 13 for details).
 
Don’t use fans when no humans are present, because all fans do then is heat up 
the air. Fans do not cool a room; they just make the people in it feel cooler — 
there’s a difference.
Helping or hindering: Humidity
On humid days, people feel much hotter than they do on less humid days, 
even if the temperature is the same on both days. Why? Because humid air 
doesn’t carry heat away from your skin nearly as well as dry air does.
For this reason, equipping your home with a dehumidifier that you use in the 
summer can make the air feel much cooler. As an added bonus — and one 
that’s particularly relevant to this book — dehumidifiers are much cheaper 
to operate than air conditioners, so they save money. Conversely, in the 
winter you want humid air because your skin can draw heat more readily 
from it than from dry air. In the winter, people don’t want to feel moving air 
from fans because that removes heat.

109
 Chapter 8: Getting the Most Out of Your Heating and Air-Conditioning System
 
Sweating is your body’s way of eliminating heat and cooling itself down. Many 
people think the evaporation of sweat is the key, but that’s only a small part 
of it. The truth is, water holds much more heat than air does; sweating is your 
body’s way of expelling this hot water. In other words, the sweat itself cools 
you down — if you can get it off your body (otherwise, sweating just moves 
the hot water from in you to on you). That’s where evaporation comes in and 
why humid days feel hotter than dry ones. When it’s humid, the air is already 
full of water and simply can’t hold any more, so sweat doesn’t evaporate. It 
just hangs around, making you feel sticky and hot. Contrary to the way it may 
feel, you don’t actually sweat more on humid days.
The following sections tell you how to keep humidity levels comfortable 
throughout the year.
In the summer
Use a dehumidifier in the summer. Keep the filter clean and try placing it in 
different rooms to get the maximum effect. The best bet is to place it in your 
family room (or wherever your family congregates the most). Other things to 
keep in mind include:
 
 Clothes dryers absolutely must be vented to the outside world. This is 
the single biggest source of humidity in a home. If you use a clothesline 
to dry things (like delicate garments) and you can’t put it outdoors for 
some reason, put it in the garage, not inside the house.
The lowdown on portable heaters
Portable heaters are heaters you can move 
around to wherever you like. You see them 
underneath people’s desks at work when 
the boss is a miser. If your HVAC system isn’t 
working consistently from room to room, a 
portable heater may be just the thing.
But here’s what’s quirky about most of them: 
They come with fans that move air over a 
resistance coil. If the fan wasn’t moving the air, 
the coil would get really, truly hot and probably 
burn up, which is clearly not something you 
want in your home (unless you want to collect 
on your fire insurance). The fan also tends to 
make you feel a lot cooler. So with traditional 
portable heaters, a conflict exists between their 
purpose (to generate warmth) and their design 
(the inclusion of the fan, which cools you down).
The best bet is to use a radiative type of heater, 
which uses parabolic reflectors with a heating 
element at the focal point, or something akin 
to this. These heaters spread heat by radiating 
it rather than by convection, which is the way 
a portable heater with a fan works. Radiation 
heaters are also more efficient, and they feel 
more natural because they’re supplying heat 
the same way the sun does; through radiation.
Remember, though: Either type of heater is dan-
gerous if used incorrectly, and in no case should 
a portable heater be used around children.

110
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
 
 Install exhaust fans vented to the outside in all bathrooms, the 
kitchen, and the laundry room. Use them when you’re showering or 
cooking to get rid of humidity in the summer. You can even install a 
humidistat to turn the vent fans on when humidity levels exceed a 
certain threshold.
 
 When you use a vent fan with the whole-house air conditioner on, crack 
a window near the vent fan. The fan will draw its air from that location 
instead of the cool air from the house.
 
 Don’t put carpet in the bathrooms. It sucks up moisture and then 
releases it all day long, producing a musty smell through the entire 
house — which may be a good thing if you want fewer houseguests.
 
 Don’t allow water to pool in your basement. Use a sump pump or find 
another way to get rid of it.
 
 Ventilate your attic and basement. This lets fresh air in and reduces 
humidity.
In the winter
Use a humidifier in the winter. This lets you decrease the load on your heat-
ing system (you don’t need to turn the heat on nearly as much to maintain 
comfort levels). You can make a humidifier by simply hanging clothes to dry 
in your bathroom (keep the door open).
 
In the winter, don’t use vent fans in the kitchen. You want both the humidity 
and the heat that you generate when you cook.
Capitalizing on the chimney effect
Heat rises. That’s why your house doesn’t fill with smoke when you’re burn-
ing wood in the fireplace. When a fire is burning in your fireplace, cool air 
from the room is drawn in and the oxygen combines with the biomass in the 
firewood to create a flame. The heat from the flame moves up into the flue 
and out the chimney (unless something is preventing it, like a home that is 
too tightly sealed or a closed damper). Hence, the term chimney effect.
In the same way, hot air rises within the confines of a single room. The tem-
perature of the air near the ceiling is always higher than that at the floor. If 
you live in a two-story house, you may notice that the upstairs gets hotter 
than the downstairs — that’s due to the chimney effect.
 
Heat rising is a passive effect; you don’t need a fan to make this air move. 
Passive effects are the absolute best when you’re looking to maximize effi-
ciency because they’re essentially free. To take advantage of them, you just 
need to exploit physics. So how do you take advantage of the chimney effect? 
In any of these ways:

111
 Chapter 8: Getting the Most Out of Your Heating and Air-Conditioning System
 
 Install ceiling fans. Depending on whether the blades push air up or 
down, ceiling fans can move heat either up into the ceiling, thereby 
making the ground level cooler, or move heat down (in the winter). By 
using them to move the air in a room around, you can maximize the 
comfort level (see Chapter 13 for more details on fans and ventilation).
 
 Adjust your registers. During the winter, adjust the registers in your 
home so that much more heat enters the downstairs than the upstairs. 
Due to the chimney effect, the home will even out very nicely. During the 
summer, do just the opposite: Open the upstairs registers and let the 
majority of cool air enter there. Over the course of the day it will 
gravitate down to the lower floors.
Going for the greenhouse effect
Why does a greenhouse get so hot when the sun is shining? The answer is 
found in the greenhouse effect. Essentially, sunlight transmits through the 
greenhouse’s glass walls and is converted into heat on the interior surfaces 
of the greenhouse. The same glass that transmitted the radiation into the 
greenhouse now serves to insulate that heat from getting back out into the 
great outdoors. The same effect causes cars to get hot when they’re sitting 
in harsh summertime sunshine. To take advantage of the greenhouse affect, 
follow these suggestions:
 
 Open all your blinds when you want to heat your home and the sun is 
shining. Blinds prevent sunlight from entering, so you can’t exploit the 
greenhouse effect when they’re drawn.
 
 Blinds work very well for insulating, so close them whenever you 
need to retain heat or cool air. In general, closing your blinds at night 
is always a good idea. Close them on cold winter days, when the sun is 
dull, to make your heater work more efficiently (by increasing the 
insulation of your home).
Making more small changes 
for even bigger benefits
One of the best ways to reduce your energy costs is with a programmable 
thermostat. This is a great do-it-yourself project, and it costs less than $100, 
in most cases. Find a unit compatible with the equipment you have in your 
house. Consult your owner’s manual to find out what types are compatible, 
call a heating and air specialist, or ask at your hardware store. Make sure to 
get one with easy-to-understand instructions. Avoid thermostats that seem 
complex to operate because that’s an indicator that the design just isn’t a 
good one.

112
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
Available options on programmable thermostats include the following:
 
 A reminder when it’s time to change the filter
 
 The ability to automatically change programs between heating and 
cooling seasons
 
 A low-battery indicator
You can get as complex as you want, but in my book simplicity is always a 
premium.
 
Most homes don’t need every room to be maintained at the same temperature. 
In general, rooms where you don’t spend a lot of time or that tend to warm 
up or cool down quickly (because of size or design) are good candidates for 
blocking off. Bathrooms, for example, don’t need HVAC very much at all, nor 
do laundry rooms. The following list shares advice on how to vary the tem-
perature of different rooms:
 
 To block off rooms, close the registers and the door. You can further 
seal the room off from the rest of the house by laying an old towel 
across the threshold at the bottom of the door. (Note, however, that the 
thermostat that controls your system needs to be in a room that isn’t 
blocked off!)
 
 Use window air conditioners to cool rooms individually. A portable 
air conditioner is much cheaper to run than a big, whole-house unit. 
Perhaps you only need to cool your family room or a single bedroom 
upstairs so that your sleep will be more comfortable. 
 
 You can easily heat a single room using portable heaters. If you set up 
a couple portable heaters in your family room, for example, you may not 
need to turn your whole-house system on at all.
Here are a couple other ways you can reduce your energy costs while maxi-
mizing your comfort:
 
 Use your grill more. If possible, do all your summertime cooking outdoors. 
Gas barbecues are the most efficient and convenient, which may motivate 
you to cook outdoors more often.
 
 Adjust the lighting. The human mind is subliminally sensitive to certain 
sensory effects, one of which is lighting tone. A harshly lit room (bright, 
silver, or yellow light) makes people feel hotter. A shady, dull room 
makes people feel cooler. Candlelight makes people feel warmer. And so

 Chapter 8: Getting the Most Out of Your Heating and Air-Conditioning System
Solving Some of the Most Common 
Inefficiency Problems
In order for any system to be efficient, it needs to be running well and 
smoothly. Sometimes, though, problems creep up that can decrease the 
performance of the system. This is certainly true of HVAC systems. If your 
existing HVAC equipment isn’t working the way you think it should, here are 
some of the most common problems that you can solve yourself.
 
If you have a combustion system, I recommend you have an HVAC pro inspect 
and tune your equipment every few years. It pays, believe me, as these systems 
are prone to carbon buildups and other soot issues that can drastically affect 
their performance. Heat pumps can work nicely for a decade without being 
serviced, as can solar water heaters, space heaters, and so on.
Window air conditioners for a single room
If you’re buying a window air conditioner, get 
one with a Seasonal Energy Efficiency Rating 
(SEER) between 10 and 17. The higher the rating, 
the more efficient the air conditioner is. Check 
with your utility company to see whether they 
offer rebates for units with high SEER numbers. 
They may have a list of recommended units you 
can get at a discount.
You can also buy a stand-alone unit that sits on 
wheels and move it around your home as you 
see fit. You can use it in the family room during 
the evening hours, and then push it into your 
bedroom when you sleep.
When you install your air conditioner, put it in 
the shade. The cooler it is, the more efficiently 
it will run.
Fortunately, you can easily do the maintenance 
yourself:
  Clean the fins, evaporator coil, fan, 
condenser fins, and tubes. Be sure to unplug 
it first, and don’t make a big mess. You can 
use a jet spray to clean out the fins.
  Air conditioners also have filters that 
get clogged. You can replace these 
inexpensively, or you may be able to 
vacuum the dust and debris from the filter 
material.
  Buy a cheap fan comb to straighten bent 
fins. Using the comb to straighten the fins 
out can make a big difference in the unit’s 
efficiency.

Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
Restoring air flow
To work at their peak efficiency, HVACs need adequate air flow. That means 
that the filters must be clean, and the airflow path must be unobstructed. 
When air flow is obstructed, the machine basically uses up the same amount 
of power but does less work for that power, and so it has to be on longer to 
get the same job done. You waste energy, and your house is noisier to boot. 
Following are some of the most common problems impeding air flow:
 
 Blockage in the air ducts: Construction debris sometimes falls into the 
ducts, as do kids’ toys, carpet segments or pads, and so on. Small items 
are easy to remove (perhaps with the help of a small hand — the  same 
one that’s responsible for that Barbie doll being in there in the first 
place). Larger items can be more of a problem; you may need to pull 
the duct from the register either from underneath the floor, or from the 
other side of the wall.
 
 Blocked registers: Something may be sitting over a register, like 
curtains, drapes, furniture, or decorations. You may not even realize 
that the register is closed off. Or maybe the air is flowing freely, but it’s 
headed in the wrong direction. You may be able to add a plastic 
reflector to aim the air better into the living quarters.
 
 Loose joints: To repair joints, use aluminum tape rather than duct tape. 
Wear a face mask to protect you from the dust, or you’ll be sorry about 
an hour later.
 
 Dirty coils, fins, and filters: You can take the outer cover off of your 
condenser unit and jet spray the fins to remove debris and crud buildup. 
If you’re still not sure whether enough air is passing through, get your 
system inspected.
 
 A blocked return air path. A forced-air system can’t heat a closed-
off room. You must crack the door open or cut an inch or two off the 
bottom of the door so the air has a gap to move through. Louvers work, 
but they’re difficult to use and neither cheap nor easy to install. If you 
absolutely need to close off a room, look into a portable heating or 
air-conditioning unit for that room.
 
 Too many bends in the ductwork. When this is the case, air has a 
difficult time passing through. Not only are you not getting much air 
through the maze-like ductwork, but the air you are getting is expensive 
(because the machine has to work harder to push the air through all the 
turns). If you can’t change the ductwork, consider installing a portable 
heater or air conditioner and simply closing off the inefficient ductwork 
entirely.

115
 Chapter 8: Getting the Most Out of Your Heating and Air-Conditioning System
Repositioning the thermostat
Your system’s performance is governed by the location of the thermostat. 
The temperature you set is maintained wherever the thermostat is located. 
Sometimes systems work poorly because direct sunshine hits the thermostat, 
resulting in a temperature reading that doesn’t accurately reflect the actual 
temperature of the room. If the thermostat is located directly over a heating 
duct or in a remote corner of the house, its temperature is not indicative of 
the house in general. A well-designed system will have the thermostat near 
the center of the home, usually near the air intake vent.
 
You can have your controller moved, and sometimes doing so is cheap and 
easy. Or you may be able to find one that uses a remotely located temperature 
sensor. This works well unless your kid takes it to school for show-and-tell.
When Your HVAC’s on the Blink
Something’s wrong. Your house isn’t staying as warm or as cool as it should, 
even though you’ve taken steps to maximize your HVAC system’s efficiency. 
What do you do? Well, if you’re like many people, you curse the Fates 
(because these things tend to break down on either the coldest day of the 
winter or the most searing day of the summer) and then call in the HVAC 
repair pros. But before you do, make sure you really need their expertise. 
Although some problems definitely need the attention of an HVAC expert, 
other problems are relatively easy to fix yourself.
What to check before you call a repairman
You know that your wallet is going to take a hit as soon as you call in a pro. 
So when your system is down, check out these things first. If you’re lucky, 
you may just solve your own HVAC problem:
 
 Check the thermostat and make sure it’s on. Fiddle with it, moving the 
temperature up and down. Give it a little time, like an hour or so, because 
sometimes there are fail-safes (timers, clocks, and so on) that go off.
 
 Check breakers at your main panel. Often when servicemen are called 
out, it’s not the HVAC that’s down, but the circuit panel, in which case 
you’ve wasted money on a call. Many furnaces also have an on-off switch 
somewhere on the chassis. Somebody (kids . . . ) may have flipped it off, 
so check to make sure it’s on.

116
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
 
 Change the filter. HVACs need flowing air to work properly. It’s 
amazing how many times servicemen are called out only to discover 
that the filter is totally clogged up. They don’t mind; they love to charge 
$80 to change your filter. But you can do it for much less.
 
 Make sure the gas is on. (Or if you have a tank, make sure it’s not 
empty). Check all the valves by closing them and opening them back up. 
This may not seem like it makes any sense, but valves can stick and by 
opening and closing them you may be able to get the fuel flowing again.
 
 Check to see whether the chimney exhaust flue is clear. This may or 
may not be an easy thing to ascertain because many chimneys meander 
back and forth, like an accordion. In other cases, you just plain can’t see 
up into that dirty, black hole. If in doubt, call for service.
 
 Make sure the line that drains water isn’t clogged. Many furnaces 
drain off several gallons of water per day in heating season. If the line 
becomes clogged and the water can’t drain properly, the furnace shuts 
down due to a fail-safe switch. If the drain hose looks dirty, remove it, fill 
it with a mixture of bleach and water (30 percent bleach to 70 percent 
water), wait 15 minutes, and flush it.
 
 Look for blocked or leaking ducts. The big ones going into the furnace 
from the house/filter port are especially problematic. If you can get to 
the ducts, you can usually fix them yourselves (see Chapter 7). Or you 
may need to contact an HVAC pro (if you do, have them do a complete 
inspection).
 
 Clean the outdoor equipment. Remove debris like leaves and twigs 
from fins or intake and exhaust ports.
Symptoms that call for a pro
If your HVAC is exhibiting any of the following symptoms, you need the help 
of a professional HVAC repairperson:
 
 Short cycling, or going off and on a lot: When the thermostat is out 
of adjustment or the internals are out of balance, a fail-safe shuts the 
system off. Turn it off and get it repaired.
 
 Irregular flame from the burners: This indicates a problem with dirty 
burners or a cracked heat exchanger. The flame should be nice and 
even over the entire burner surface. Many times you can tell at a glance 
whether your burners are running optimally.

117
 Chapter 8: Getting the Most Out of Your Heating and Air-Conditioning System
 
 Strange sounds like rumbling, clicking, and so on: These are okay in 
hot-water or steam-heating systems, but in a furnace with a forced-air 
system, they’re a sign of trouble.
 
 Inexplicable illness in your family: You may have a combustion leak 
somewhere in the system. Call a pro right away. Get a carbon monoxide 
alarm right now and use it. Check out Chapter 6 for more on carbon 
monoxide poisoning, or better yet, check with your doctor.
 
 Sooty accumulations: Deposits usually appear near where the flame 
is burning. A good clean burn leaves very little residue, and it appears 
more brown than black. Sooty black grunge, on the other hand, is a sign 
of incomplete burning — you’re not getting all the heat you could be out 
of your fuel — and you’re paying for the inefficiency. Plus, you’re going 
to have to clean the soot out of the system, which can be costly.
Different kinds of HVAC filters
The most expensive problem you can encounter 
with your HVAC system happens when either 
the filter or the fins get clogged up, in which 
case your machine runs, but little or no air 
passes through. Changing filters prevents both 
filter and fins from clogging. When buying filters, 
keep these things in mind:
  Fiberglass filters are woven and often blue, 
and they’re the cheapest filters you can 
get. If you buy them in bulk, they’re even 
cheaper, and you’ll change them more 
often as a result. These only screen out 
debris that could damage your unit. Large 
dust gets through, as well as mold, mildew, 
toxins, and so forth. This may or may not 
matter to you. If you open your windows 
a lot, a high-tech filter on your HVAC input 
isn’t going to change the average air quality 
in your home enough to merit the extra cost.
  Pleated paper filters have smaller porosity 
(so they filter smaller particles), as well as 
much greater surface area so they don’t get 
clogged as fast. Use these if you only want 
to change the filter every three months or 
so. They’re worth twice the cost, if you 
change them one third as often.
  Electrostatic filters get rid of smoke 
residues, allergens, and asthma-causing 
agents ($20 to $45 and up). Be aware, 
however, that simply installing these 
does not remove all particles from the air. 
You need to use your system a lot to get 
the effect. You also need supplementary 
systems like air purifiers (see Chapter 13 for 
more on ventilation).

118
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
Buying a New System or Supplementing 
the One You Have
If your HVAC system is old, it’s probably inefficient compared to newer 
technology. You’re likely to be disappointed with your system’s performance. 
Maybe it doesn’t cool the house well enough in the summer, or it’s on all the 
time in the winter and the air isn’t hot enough when it comes out. Or perhaps 
you’re getting tired of the twice-a-year service call, in which case you need 
to add these costs to the payback analysis. Either way, if you’re like most 
people, you may be considering changing your HVAC equipment.
If you’re thinking about replacing your current HVAC system, your best bet is 
to call an HVAC service company and have them come out and analyze your 
equipment. They can tell you how much better new equipment will perform 
(although you should keep in mind that their motive is to sell new equipment). 
Armed with this information, you’ll have a payback decision on your hands. 
You’ll be saving a certain amount of energy per year, which you can translate 
into cost by using your rate structure (see Chapter 3). What you’ll probably 
discover is that, because HVAC equipment is expensive, you’re not likely to 
get a payback in less than 20 years, which is a dubious investment.
Before you spend the big bucks, first try all the little things I present in this 
chapter and in Chapter 7. If you still decide to change, take your time. Do 
your research, and get at least three quotes. 
Rather than replacing your existing HVAC, you can install supplemental 
heating and cooling equipment. You can do this in all sorts of ways:
 
 Take advantage of the sun. You can use the sun to heat your home, 
and prevent it from doing so when you want to stay cool. Details are in 
Chapter 12.
 
 Improve ventilation: This chapter has all sorts of little tips about 
getting the air moving in your house, and Chapter 13 offers much more 
detail.
 
 Incorporate alternative energy sources: A number of energy sources — 
solar, stoves, biomass, and others — can supplement your current HVAC 
system. All these are explained in detail in Part III. Before deciding that 
you want to change your existing equipment, take a quick stroll through 
this information. You may decide that you can solve your problem one 
step at a time and save a lot of money.

119
 Chapter 8: Getting the Most Out of Your Heating and Air-Conditioning System
 
One of the best bets is to install a stove in your family room or living room. 
You can use the stove to heat the room locally, which means you won’t be 
heating your entire home. This is inevitably cheaper, as long as you install the 
right type of stove and use it appropriately. I did this in my home: I installed a 
gas fireplace in the family room and it actually heats the entire home so well 
that most of the time I don’t have to turn the whole-house system on at all. To 
be honest, I can’t say that I saved a whole lot of money considering how much 
the equipment and installation cost, but the home is a lot friendlier because 
a fireplace flame is burning almost constantly in the most-used room in the 
house. The aesthetics are much better, and the gas fireplace is a cinch to 
operate. All it takes is the press of a button on the remote controller.
Hiring an HVAC Contractor
Whether you decide to replace your existing HVAC system with a brand-new 
one or supplement the one you have with additional heating and cooling 
equipment, you need to hire a contractor. Every contractor uses a standard 
contract and follows approved practices. Contractors can
 
 Obtain permits
 
 Manage the schedule and get the parts when they’re needed
 
 Deal with all the inspections, and assume responsibility for a failed 
inspection
 
 Solve problems quickly and efficiently
To find potential contractors, your best bet is to ask friends who have the 
same kind of system you want to install for referrals (or warnings to stay 
away, as the case may be). You can look contractors up with the Better 
Business Bureau, or you can get information from state regulatory agencies. 
The Internet contains a lot of referral sites, but beware — these may be paid 
for by the contractors themselves. Enter the name of your city or county and 
the kind of project you want to do.
 
Never use a family member or friend. You may think they’ll give you a better 
price (they’ll probably be thinking they can charge you more since there won’t 
be competitive bids) and better service (they’ll be thinking they can work 
your job when it’s convenient because you won’t fire them), but the reality is 
you’ll (both) probably regret it.

120
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
Getting bids
When hiring an HVAC contractor, always, always, always get multiple bids. 
There’s a possibility that you may only be able to find a single contractor 
who can do the job you have in mind. In this case, try to get some information 
about how much the job costs in other areas so you’ll have something to 
compare your bids against.
 
Always let contractors know you’re going out for competitive bids. Never 
make a commitment of any kind when they first visit.
Comparing bids
After you get the bids, the problem becomes one of comparing apples to 
apples. Choosing the contractor comes down to three things:
 
 Cost: This may seem very important, but ultimately it may be the least 
significant factor. Why? Many things can go wrong, and problems 
generally add up to more cost. If you get a bid that’s much lower than 
the other ones, beware. Your contractor probably doesn’t understand 
what he’s doing, either technically or competitively. Or maybe you’re 
getting a contractor with a much lower overhead rate. Why? Does he not 
carry insurance? Is he working out of his truck, or off of his bicycle? Will 
he be around in three months to provide warranty coverage?
 
 Craftsmanship: Get referrals. Although this may not seem important, it 
reveals experience and efficiency. How long has the contractor been in 
the business?
 
 Compatibility: Let’s face it. Some contractors are just dubious characters, 
and some are living in a different universe than you and I. Having a good 
relationship matters — a lot. Not only does it foster cooperation and 
increase the likelihood that problems will be ironed out quickly and 
effectively, but a contractor who doesn’t like you is simply not going to 
go the extra mile for you (that’s right — it can go both ways). You may 
get the work done as per spec, but extra time won’t be spent to get the 
pipe joints just right. Or your phone calls won’t be returned until it can’t 
be put off any longer. The bottom line is that you want a contractor who 
is happy to answer the phone when he sees your phone number on his 
Caller ID.
 
Make sure to ask about workmanship warranties. If the contractor is only 
offering the warranty that comes from the manufacturer, beware. Ask about 
bonding, insurance, licenses, and so forth too. If your contractor doesn’t like 
these questions, beware. Good contractors are glad to hear these questions — 
it means their shady competitors are being weeded out.

121
 Chapter 8: Getting the Most Out of Your Heating and Air-Conditioning System
Interviewing a contractor
All the contractors you contact want the job, for the most money they can 
get. Here’s how to wade through the quicksand:
 
 Let the contractors do the talking during the interviews. If you’re talking, 
you’re not getting information.
 
 Ask the same questions of each contractor.
 
 Ask them what problems they foresee.
 
 Ask them whether they get their supplies from multiple sources. If 
they’re stuck on a single system supplier, ask them why.
 
 Ask them what conditions would merit the contract being tossed out.
 
You always have the right to negotiate, and they always have the right to refuse.
Sealing the deal
A contract should include prices as well as a schedule of events that can be 
easily established and approved between the two of you. You also need to 
specify the cash flow: when payment is due and how much it will be.
 
Never pay a contractor until the work is finished. The best bet is not to make 
any payments at all until the entire job is finished.
 
Get everything in writing. Make it clear that throughout the entire project you 
expect everything to be in writing. Any decisions or changes made will be in 
writing only. E-mails are okay, but print them out and keep them in a file folder. 
I shall repeat: Get everything in writing. It’s not that people are to be dis-
trusted; it’s that verbal communication is like that children’s game Telephone, 
where the message gets garbled each time it’s spoken. Writing forces clear 
articulation (although some readers of this book might argue that point).
Working with a contractor 
once the job begins
Once you’re on the go, you need to work with your contractor as effectively 
as possible. Now is not the time to express doubt about your contractor’s 
abilities. Now is the time to follow the Golden Rule: Do unto others as you 
would have them do unto you.

122
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
 
 Always be completely square and decisive. You may not want to 
express disappointment about how a job is turning out, but you should 
do so if that’s what you’re feeling.
 
 Be friendly no matter what. Don’t get emotional. Problems happen. Be 
cool when they do, and your contractor will be more honest with you 
about everything.
 
 Offer cold drinks. Make a cooler available. Go the extra mile.
 
 Don’t forget the need for a restroom. Make it nice and easy, and keep it 
clean.

Lighting Your Home 
More Efficiently
In This Chapter

 Considering the aesthetics of your lighting schemes
 Calculating cost savings that you can achieve
 Maximizing your efficiency with special light switches
T
he typical North American home spends between 8 and 10 percent of 
its energy budget on lighting (not including the bulbs and equipment). 
In any given night, the average home uses 32 light bulbs, including not only 
lighting for rooms, but lighting inside refrigerators, ovens, and microwaves. 
Most of these light bulbs are the standard, 50-cent, screw-base style using 
a technology that has been around for over a hundred years. People have 
spent the vast majority of their lives with Thomas Edison’s original brain-
storm. But things are changing. A number of choices are available now that, 
while more expensive, provide much better economics and performance 
over the lifetime of the product. They also offer lower pollution, which is very 
important to many people.
In this chapter, I show you how to review your lighting arrangements and make 
sensible changes geared toward realizing payback. New lighting technologies 
can be very expensive, and you may be better off spending the money on other 
efficiency improvements. I show you how to make the right decisions. If you’re 
interested in exploiting the sun for some of your home-lighting needs, head to 
Chapter 12, where I tell you how to let the sun shine in!

Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
Picking the Right Light: Your Options
When you think of lighting, you may automatically think of Thomas Edison 
and his incandescent bulb. In fact, you may be reading this very book by the 
light of a bulb not too different from the one Edison first invented. But lighting 
options have evolved over time, from natural light to firelight to candles to 
incandescent bulbs to the energy-efficient products of today. Each has its 
plusses and minuses when it comes to ambience and energy efficiency. In 
this section, I review the most common light alternatives in use today.
 
The prevailing question is whether, by reducing the lighting component of 
your utility bill, you can actually achieve better overall efficiencies. This 
depends largely on why you’re using lighting and what sort of climate you 
live in. There’s a fundamental notion that lighting is inherently inefficient, but 
the story is not so simple. If your main energy issue is heating your home, for 
example, burning inefficient light bulbs will simply mean that your furnace is 
on less, so the process is not really as inefficient as it may first appear. In fact, 
you could conceivably heat your entire home exclusively with old-fashioned, 
inexpensive light bulbs. Plus, incandescent bulbs shed a nice, warm color that 
has the psychological effect of making you feel warmer. The point is, you need 
to understand how and when the new technologies should be used because 
they’re not universal solutions, as some would have you believe.
 
Visit a good-quality lighting store to see all kinds of lighting options. Stores 
dedicated to lighting have better displays and a broader range of products 
than big hardware stores. The sales staff is also able to explain energy-efficient 
products better.
Natural light
Natural light includes sunlight, firelight, and candlelight. Sunlight has been 
around a lot longer than humanity, and it provides the overwhelming bulk of 
our lighting needs. Sunlight has a very broad spectrum, or many wavelengths 
of light — what most people think of as “color” (think of the colors of the 
rainbow and you get the idea). Sunlight’s spectrum goes from ultra-violet, 
which we can’t see, through the visible range (the rainbow colors), and on 
into the infrared and far infrared, which are also invisible to the human eye. 
Sunlight gets filtered as it transmits through the atmosphere, and that’s why 
it can look very red in the morning and evenings. But mostly sunlight is white 
and bright, creating a jaunty mood that people associate with the best of 
Mother Nature.
Candlelight and firelight preceded all our fancy, electrical light bulb schemes. 
Flames cast a rich tone of reddish hues and make people’s skin tone appear 
deep and attractive. Candles are popular because of the benign, tawny tint 
they cast on a room.

125
 Chapter 9: Lighting Your Home More Efficiently
You can increase the lighting efficiency in your home by taking advantage of 
these natural light sources. Following are some ideas:
 
 Sunlight is the most efficient way to light your home because it’s free 
and creates zero pollution. Sunlight also creates a specific mood, which 
can’t be beat by manmade artifices. I go into a lot of detail on how to get 
sunlight into your home in Chapter 12.
 
 Candles don’t require any utility power. If you want to light your whole 
house with candlelight, use natural beeswax candles with minimal 
scent and lead-free wicks, and try to find the long-burning style, which 
translates into less crud outgassed into the air in your home. Candles of 
this type can light your house very nicely and save a lot of money. (You 
don’t want to use regular candles to light your whole house. Doing so 
can become very expensive, not to mention polluting.)
 
 Don’t blow your candles out when you’re finished with them; use a 
snuffer (a long handle with a cone shape on one end) unless, of course, 
you like the look of wax-spray on your walls. Blowing out candles also 
causes more pollution in the air than a snuffer because you’re blasting 
the wick with oxygen (the snuffer is much gentler). Notice how much 
less smoke a snuffer creates and you’ll get the picture.
 
 If you want to light your home with firelight, let the kids play with 
matches in the living room. Be sure to have the fire department, your 
insurance company, Child Protective Services, and a good lawyer on 
stand-by.
Old-fashioned incandescent bulbs
Standard-style (incandescent) light bulbs work by using electricity to heat 
up a narrow, high-resistance filament until it glows very bright. The filament 
is enclosed in a vacuum-drawn envelope (called the bulb) so that when 
the filament glows, it doesn’t burn up from being combined with oxygen. 
Incandescent bulbs cast a warm, reddish tint, especially when a dimmer is 
used. You can get them in a thousand different configurations, and they’re 
inexpensive and widely available. Their widespread use is not going to 
diminish anytime soon, but the trend is toward other lighting sources simply 
because incandescent bulbs are so inefficient (at least in terms of lighting; 
they do make great heaters).
An important specification for a light bulb is how much light it puts out 
divided by the amount of energy it consumes (an efficiency standard). 
Incandescent bulbs are the worst of all lighting options in this regard: Most of 
the energy an incandescent bulb gobbles up is converted into heat — nearly 
90 percent. That doesn’t mean, however, that you can’t use incandescent 
bulbs more efficiently.

126
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
 
When considering light bulb efficiency, pay attention to the bulb’s intensity 
and spatial focus. A round light bulb emits its spectrum pretty much in all 
directions at once, while a laser beam, for example, is extremely focused on 
a specific spot. A 10-watt gooseneck lamp with a highly focused reflector can 
cast enough light onto the page of a book to make reading easy and comfortable 
on the eyes. A 100-watt light bulb in a broadly emitting lamp, on the other 
hand, may be so diffuse that nothing shows up clearly. So when you choose 
incandescent bulbs, remember that higher wattage doesn’t necessarily mean 
brighter light. Rather than buy the highest wattage you can find, buy the bulb 
that’s labeled a floodlight. These are usually conically shaped and have some 
reflective material on the inside of the glass envelope.
Halogen bulbs
Halogen light bulbs operate almost the same as incandescent bulbs, but with 
a few small differences. Inside a halogen bulb is a peanut-sized glass envelope 
that contains a tungsten filament and halogen gas (essentially, it’s a light 
bulb inside of a light bulb). As the tungsten filament burns (the same way 
an incandescent does), the halogen gas catches the tungsten molecules and 
redeposits them back onto the filament, yielding a longer lifetime and better 
lighting uniformity. Halogen bulbs also emit a whiter, brighter, and more 
easily focused light, comparable to sunshine itself (this may or may not be a 
goal you have in mind, but in my book it sounds like a good idea).
Halogen bulbs are good for reading because they’re easier on your eyes (due 
to color, intensity, and so on). They’re also good for store displays or for art-
work illumination where you want the light to have a color-neutral affect (and 
let the artwork do its own talking). They work well outdoors because the 
light is more noticeable. Although they may yield the same lumen output (a 
measure of how much light a bulb emits) as an incandescent, the light works 
better with the human eye, so the spectrum is more efficient.
 
Halogen bulbs burn hotter than regular incandescent bulbs, so you need to be 
more careful how you handle them. If you use one for a reading light, you may 
not like having the intense heat source next to your head. Or you may love the 
heat source, if it’s a cold, winter night. Like incandescent bulbs, the overall 
efficiency of halogen bulbs depends on whether you want heat.
Halogen bulbs can be much more efficient than incandescent bulbs because 
they last twice as long. Use them in locations that are hard to reach, and 
you won’t have to reach so far so often. You can also use them in locations 
where you’re looking for more heat. Perhaps the most important advantage 
of halogen bulbs, however, is their benign appearance, particularly when 
dimmed. Having each bulb appear exactly the same may also be important in 
track lighting. Incandescent bulbs tend to change over their lifetimes, while 
halogen bulbs are very uniform (unlike you and me).

Flickering fluorescent bulbs
The wave of the future, fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) use a gas-filled tube 
and a ballast with electronics. A high-voltage signal excites phosphors on 
the inside surface of the bulb, which, in turn, emit light. The main difference 
between CFLs and incandescent or halogen bulbs is that CFLs are far more 
efficient because they don’t put out a lot of heat. A typical 15-watt CFL puts 
out as much light as a 60-watt incandescent light bulb, meaning CFLs are four 
times as efficient.
 
If you plan to replace an incandescent bulb with an equivalent fluorescent 
bulb, in general, you can divide the wattage of an incandescent by four to get 
the wattage needed for an equivalent CFL. But the best bet is to compare the 
lumens, an actual measure of the light output (wattage is simply the input 
power the bulb will take). Almost all light-bulb packages now include lumens 
in addition to wattages.
CFLs are more expensive, although the gap is closing due to the fact that so 
many more fluorescent bulbs are now being manufactured. The typical lifetime 
of a CFL is around four times that of an incandescent bulb, and herein lies their 
real benefit: They don’t need to be changed nearly as often, so the lifetime 
costs are actually less than incandescent bulbs, making them cheaper in the 
long term. One caveat: You should only use CFLs in fixtures that you use at 
least two hours per day; otherwise, the extra cost and diminished appearance 
probably isn’t worth it.
 
The fact that CFLs have much longer lifetimes makes them useful in hard-to-
reach places because you don’t have to change them nearly as often. If you 
have a bulb that’s on a  lot and hard to get to, use a fluorescent bulb.
CFLs aren’t without drawbacks. The chief one is that they tend to flicker like 
a strobe light (this may or may not be noticeable). Plus, their light spectrum 
(the color they broadcast) is often a bluish tint, which does not tend to 
flatter skin tone or food appearance. However, new technologies that solve 
these problems are becoming more common. Here are some other things to 
be aware of about CFLs:
 
 They can be dimmed, but only if you buy the right dimmers, and these 
are not cheap. Plus, some people don’t like the pronounced flickering 
that dimmers create.
 
 CFLs don’t like very hot environments, where their lifetimes are drasti-
cally reduced. Don’t use them in enclosed spaces without ventilation 
because they’ll heat up and grow old quickly, thereby negating the 
longevity advantage.
 
 CFLs often take a few minutes to reach maximum brightness. If you’re 
shopping for a bulb and sampling the possibilities, allow some time for it 
to warm up before you decide whether you like it or not.

Around 5 milligrams of mercury are contained in each CFL light bulb (big 
bulbs have more, of course). Mercury is a very poisonous substance, although 
5 milligrams isn’t much at all (about as much as the tip of a fine-point pencil). 
The fact that CFLs contain mercury means you have to be particularly careful 
when disposing of and handling these bulbs:
 
 In most municipalities, you can’t simply throw a CFL into the trash; you 
must handle it with special care. This boils down to an even higher cost, 
which must be weighed against the efficiency gains you may realize. 
Some options for disposing of CFLs include hazardous waste sites (most 
accept CFLs, but some don’t) and stores that sell CFLs (many take back 
old, used ones; IKEA, in particular, has gone out of its way to be 
environmentally friendly). To find a suitable disposal option, contact 
the U.S. Environmental Recycling Hotline (877-327-8491) or check out 
www.lamprecycle.org.
 
 Never send a CFL product to an incinerator, as the mercury becomes 
airborne when the bulb burns.
 
 Never use a vacuum to clean up a broken bulb; the mercury is aerated 
into your home environment through the vacuum filter, which is too 
porous to catch the molecules. Use a wet paper towel, and stick both 
the bulb parts and the paper towel in a sealed, plastic bag.
Light-emitting diodes
Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are extremely efficient — even more so than 
CFLS — and they have incredibly long lifetimes. However, they’re much 
more expensive than other lighting sources. At present, LEDs are used 
where ultra-high efficiency or ultra-long lifetime are required, for instance, 
in off-grid homes that run off of batteries or remote cabins that run off of 
generators. In these applications, LEDs are actually cheaper in the long run, 
despite their high cost, because they enable smaller batteries. (In off-grid 
homes, the battery banks are the fundamental power source. Batteries are 
very expensive, so smaller batteries are economically desirable). LEDs are 
also used in stoplights (due to their ultra-high reliability) and in auto 
taillights.
Portable devices that use batteries also benefit from using LEDs. The 
availability of LED flashlights and camping lanterns, as well as boat and RV 
lighting systems, is increasing. You can buy LED-based light modules that 
interchangeably plug right into existing screw-type light fixtures, but they 
cost over $25. Furthermore, the light is thin and silvery, which is not the 
friendliest hue. Before you buy LEDs, check them out at a lighting store 
because light bulbs, like kids, are not returnable items if you’re not happy 
with their performance.

 Chapter 9: Lighting Your Home More Efficiently
Going for Efficiency without 
Sacrificing Aesthetics
Lighting does more than illuminate. It also creates mood, or ambience. While 
one type of light produces a warm, cozy glow, another type produces a harsh 
glare. Either can be just the type of light you need or want, depending on 
your lighting needs, the area you want to illuminate, and the mood you want 
to create.
Most lighting is not for “seeing,” but for mood and for making your home 
feel homier. By being imaginative — moving your lights around in different 
setups and trying different light bulbs — you can probably find an optimum 
configuration that takes less energy than you’re using right now without 
sacrificing a thing. Here are some ideas for your consideration:
 
 Find a style of lamp that creates the mood you want. The lamp is 
usually more influential than the type of light bulb in creating a mood. 
Lamps with dimmers are always good, and a lamp that focuses light lets 
you use a smaller light bulb and attain the same effect.
 
 You can find a lot of very interesting lamps at garage sales, often for less 
than a dollar apiece. Be on the lookout for such a find. It can save you 
money twice: on the purchase price and on the energy costs. The best 
finds are gooseneck lamps with dimmers so you can focus the light on 
your work and turn the intensity up and down as desired.
 
 Avoid metal or heavy paper lampshades. Lampshades are very important 
in terms of focusing and directing light. Many of them cut off most of the 
light from a bulb. Look for ones that have the effect you want, but allow 
most of the light through. Diaphanous films are best.
 
 Vary the intensity of lighting as much as you can. Vary light bulb 
intensities to create texture and depth in a room. Disperse the lights 
around your house to highlight the good and ignore the not-so-good.
 
 Vary wattage where you can: The higher the wattage, the colder the 
light (bluish light “feels” colder than red; it’s a human perception thing); 
the lower the wattage, the redder the light, and the friendlier the tone. 
The wattage you choose depends on what you’re trying to achieve. A 
number of smaller light bulbs distributed around a room makes for a 
soft color and even lighting. Plus, lower-wattage bulbs have longer 
lifetimes simply because they’re not being so stressed by heat.
 
 Always use the smallest wattage possible. Experiment instead of just 
plugging in what you have on hand. You’ll probably find that you can 
use smaller bulbs in most instances. For example, a gooseneck lamp in 
the bathroom that focuses in on your face gives you the lighting you 
need and keeps wattage down.

130
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
 
 Use lights creatively. For example, vary the lights on tracks; they don’t 
all have to be the same type or wattage, nor do they all have to be 
focused on the fireplace. A small spotlight on your favorite picture will 
bring those colors into play in the room. A small, 10-watt picture light 
can completely change a room for the better.
 
 Try candles. Use them alone or in combination with electric lights. 
You’ll get hooked, and you’ll save money if you do it right (see the 
earlier section “Natural light” for details on what makes candles energy 
efficient).
 
 Lower the lights before bed. Too much light right before bed creates a 
bad sleeping mood. Start to dim the lights or turn them off well before 
you retire. You’ll find yourself gently relaxing into sleep mode.
 
 Use night lights. Having strategically placed night lights relieves you of 
the need to flip every light switch on when you get up in the middle of 
the night to go to the bathroom or nursery. Besides, blasting yourself 
with light in the bathroom in the middle of the night wakes you up, and 
it’s a proven fact that it takes you longer to get back to sleep than if you 
simply use a very dim night light.
 
 Make your lights do double duty where (and when) possible. CFLs have 
a reputation for being more efficient than incandescent bulbs, but in certain 
situations that’s not the case. In the winter, for example, incandescent 
bulbs are more efficient than CFLs because they’re cheap and they help 
heat your home (because of the heat they emit). In fact, they heat more 
uniformly and also cast a warmer mood. They may be more efficient at 
heating your home than your central heater or your stove.
Creating an outdoor “room” with light
Here’s a great way to leverage your lighting 
investment to the hilt. Create a “room” in your 
yard by strategically placing outdoor lights. 
You can use solar lights, which can be moved 
wherever you want, or you can use low-volt-
age lighting systems available at any hardware 
store. (Low-voltages are safe, so anybody can 
do the project without the need for an electri-
cian.) You can also use torchlights, which are 
like big candles.
Establish the room’s boundaries with lights: 
Shine them on bushes or trees and that’s where 
your eye will subliminally see a “wall.” Highlight 
features like fountains, flower beds, furniture, 
and so on. Use colored lights to vary the texture 
and create moods and aesthetic spaces.
By doing this, you can achieve an effect that 
makes your home seem larger, more spacious, 
and certainly more in tune with Mother Nature.

131
 Chapter 9: Lighting Your Home More Efficiently
Calculating How Much You Can Save
To make a long story short, your potential cost savings (and the payback of 
installing a more expensive technology) are entirely dependent on how much 
you use a light (the average number of hours per day). Obviously, the easiest 
way to save money is to simply use less lighting; you don’t need to invest 
in new bulbs. The minimum lighting you need to function is one light bulb 
turned on per person in your home at any given time. (I don’t mean this to be 
a lifestyle guide; I simply want to make a point.)
Of course, most people don’t restrict themselves to turning on one light 
per person. In most homes, some light bulbs are literally on all the time, 
particularly outside lights or garage lights. And someone who likes a bright 
room may have every table lamp on as well as the book light he’s reading by.
Consider the lights you use. Do you really need all of them? You’d probably 
answer no if you knew how much each one costs. Fortunately, lighting costs 
are easy to calculate. Here’s how to determine how much you’re spending on 
a particular light each month:
 
1. Figure out how many watt hours (Wh) the bulb is on per day by 
multiplying the wattage by the number of hours the light’s on daily.
 
 You can read the wattage from the light bulb. The value is expressed in 
watts; 60-watts is very common. Then ask yourself how many hours you 
typically use that light per day. Two hours? All day (24 hours)?
 
2. Multiply the total daily Wh by 30 to get the total Wh per month.
 
3. Divide the total Wh per month by 1,000 to get the total kWh.
 
 Why are kWh important? Because your utility bill is calculated based on kWh.
 
4. To get your monthly cost, multiply your kWh by the amount the electric 
company charges you per kWh.
 
 Look at your electric bill to find out how much you’re being charged for 
electricity. Fifteen cents per kWh is typical, but your rate may be a lot 
higher. (See Chapter 3 for more details. In particular, if you’re on a tiered 
rate structure, use the highest rate.)

132
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
Here are some examples of calculations and the cost savings you may be able 
to achieve by changing your lighting schemes.
 
 A 60-watt bulb left on for an hour consumes 60 Wh, or .06 kWh per day. 
Ten 60-watt bulbs in recessed lighting in your ceiling turned on for four 
hours consume 2.4 kWh per day. At a rate of 15 cents per kWh, this 
costs 36 cents a day. For a month, the total comes to $10.80, or $130 per 
year. Add to that the cost of new bulbs, and you may be spending over 
$150 a year to leave those overhead lights on every night. Is it worth it? 
Calculations like this can be surprising.
 
 A 15-watt CFL costs around $4, while a comparable 60-watt incandescent 
bulb costs around 75 cents. For a light fixture that is turned on four 
hours per day, at a cost of 15 cents per kWh, the CFL costs $3.24 per 
year to operate. The incandescent costs $12.96 per year, for a difference 
of $9.72. Going with the initially more expensive CFL is actually more 
cost-efficient, easily paying you back the difference in original equipment 
cost and saving around 130 pounds of carbon dioxide pollution.
 
 Do you have an outside light that burns all night? If it’s 600 watts, it’s 
costing you: 0.600 kW ×10 hours/day × 30 days/month × $.15/kWh = $9 
per month, or $108 per year. You could add a motion detector, which 
turns the light on only when something moves through the viewing area, 
and save $100 per year while still having light whenever you really need 
it. (See the next section for more on motion detectors.)
 
 A 15-watt CFL bulb costs $3.00, whereas a 60-watt incandescent bulb 
costs 50 cents. In a garage where the light is on all the time, a CFL costs 
around $20 per year to operate, whereas an incandescent bulb costs 
$80. However, if the CFL is put into a bathroom light socket that’s only 
used for an hour a day, the annual cost difference is only $2.50, which is 
the difference in the prices of the bulbs. (Plus, in the bathroom, the hue 
of the CFL light is not very flattering.)
To calculate the savings you can achieve by installing a smaller bulb or a 
different type of bulb, do this:
 
1. Figure out the wattage difference between the replaced bulb and the 
new bulb.
 
 Simply subtract the wattages: If you replace a 60-watt bulb with a 40-watt 
bulb, take 40 away from 60.
 
 Keep in mind that you may not be getting the same amount of light, or 
lumens, when you change bulbs, but the cost on your utility bill depends 
only on the wattage.
 
2. Figure out how many hours per year the light is on.
 
 Multiply the number of hours the light’s on daily by 365.

133
 Chapter 9: Lighting Your Home More Efficiently
 
3. Multiply the yearly value (Step 2) by the wattage difference (Step 1) 
and then divide by 1,000 to get the annual kWh.
 
4. Multiply what you got in Step 3 by your electricity cost, in $ per kWh.
 
5. Compare this to the difference in cost of the bulbs. Also take into 
account the expected lifetime of the bulb.

types of light bulbs, go to www.getenergysmart.com. For an online catalog

Using Clever Switches to 
Reduce Your Bill
As earlier sections explain, you can use different types of light bulbs to 
increase your energy efficiency, but a better option may be to use clever 
switching systems that simply and automatically turn your lights off when 
you don’t need them.
Motion detectors
Motion detectors are devices that switch light bulbs off and on when they 
detect something moving in their field-of-view, basically the area where the 
motion detector is set up to “look.” Motion detectors are the exact same 
technology used in burglar alarms, except that they don’t trigger an alarm; 
they simply turn on the light. Most motion detectors are integrated with a 
timing switch, so when motion is detected and a light is switched on, it goes 
off after a set amount of time (a couple minutes is typical — most devices are 
adjustable for time delay).
Motion detectors offer all sorts of benefits, some relating to efficiency and 
some relating to safety, but all relating to convenience. Burglars, for example, 
hate being suddenly illuminated while they’re sneaking around. When a light 
is simply left on, a burglar doesn’t mind so much; it’s when things suddenly 
change that they get nervous and decide to vamoose. Mount a motion 
detector light over a porch or on the side of your house where a burglar 
is most apt to approach (like a dark garage side). Motion detectors aren’t 
valuable just for their “gotcha!” effect, though. They turn on when anyone is 
there, which can be helpful when a neighbor comes up to your porch for a 
friendly visit, you pull into the driveway at night, and so on.

134
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
You get the best return on investment when you combine motion detectors 
with high-wattage lights, which are usually the kind employed outdoors. Here 
are some options to consider:
 
 Solar-powered outdoor floodlights with motion detectors: You can 
mount them anywhere so you get light exactly where you want it, and 
you don’t need an electrical outlet so you avoid the cost of outlet 
installation. The unit includes a battery that is charged during high 
intensity solar hours, and so the amount of available energy is limited. 
At around $65, the potential exists for huge cost savings if you need light 
in a remote location. Plus, you can move the lights around at will, which 
you can’t do with a standard hard-wired light fixture.
 
 One-piece outdoor systems: These include one or more motion 
detectors along with light fixtures in one complete package. These come 
in flood, decorative, and remote arrangements.
 
 Motion detector switches: These fit right into the standard switch 
socket you already have in your home. Whenever somebody walks into 
the field of view, the light goes on for about 30 seconds. These are great 
for utility rooms where your hands may be full of clothes or groceries, 
and flipping a switch is inconvenient. They’re also good for basements 
and attics.
 
 Screw-base-style motion detectors. You install these between a light 
bulb and the socket that the bulb would normally be screwed into. At 
around $40 they’re not cheap and the payback isn’t very good, but they 
may be just the ticket for a utility room or laundry room where your 
arms are full of groceries or clothes and you can’t grapple around for 
the switch. Go to www.sportys.com/shoptool to see a number of 
popular arrangements.
 
Before you buy a motion detector, pay attention to the field of view, which is 
the area over which the motion detector operates. With some units, you can 
adjust the field of view; with others, it’s fixed. Getting one with an adjustable 
sensitivity is best; you don’t necessarily want your lights to go on when a cat 
crosses your yard (then again, maybe you do). When in doubt, save the 
packing materials and receipt, and be prepared to buy something else.
Dimmer switches
Light dimmers are used for decreasing and increasing a light’s intensity. 
Although they aren’t particularly efficient, the net effect of using them is that 
you do use less energy. There’s another benefit as well: The bulbs on dimmer 
switches last longer because they’re operating at lower temperatures. In 
general, you get a friendlier, richer color, and you can vary the mood in a 
room like nothing else.

135
 Chapter 9: Lighting Your Home More Efficiently
 
You can change almost any light switch in your house to a dimmer switch, but 
beware: You need to know a few basic rudiments about electricity before you 
start poking around inside your electrical junction boxes. You need to under-
stand the difference between the white wire, the black wire, and the green (or 
bare) wire. The task isn’t difficult, but explaining everything you need to know 
about electrical wiring is beyond the scope of this book. If you’re motivated 
and want to give it a go yourself, keep the following advice in mind:
 
 Before you do anything, the safest bet is to simply turn the main 
breaker switch off in your house. You’ll have to do your work during 
daylight hours or with a flashlight, but you won’t be able to shock your-
self. After you do the work, make sure you cover the dimmer switch with 
the faceplate. If you turn the main breaker back on and a circuit breaker 
trips, you’ve messed up somewhere, at which point I recommend you 
call in an electrician to find out what’s wrong and do the job right.
 
 Ask for instructions and guidelines at your hardware store. Someone 
there can probably tell you how to install a switch and show you the 
actual hardware to use. When you’re getting instructions, make sure 
you understand how to maintain the proper grounding scheme, which is 
very important. You may need to be aware of local electrical codes, so 
ask your hardware store clerk about those as well.
 
 Another option is to refer to How To Fix Everything For Dummies by Gary 
Hedstrom, Peg Hedstrom, and Judy Ondria Tremore (Wiley) for general 
information and instructions on common electrical wiring jobs.
 
If you have aluminum wiring in your house (it’s shiny or dull gray, instead of 
the usual coppery or orange color), don’t wire a dimmer yourself because 
there are technical problems you don’t want to deal with. (Specifically, when 
two dissimilar metals come into contact, the potential for corrosion exists.) So 
when working with aluminum wires, call in a pro.
Whole-house lighting controllers
Whole-house lighting control systems basically switch all your home lights 
off and on from a central console. For instance, you can turn off all your 
lights from one location when you go to bed. Or when you enter your house, 
you can turn on a certain preset number of lights so you don’t have to go 
around and individually activate each light. Some can be turned off and on by 
a timer. You can even get a system that you can call from a remote location 
(though why you’d want to, I haven’t figured out).
If you program one of these contraptions for efficiency, you can achieve some 
significant cost savings. For instance, you could turn all your lights off at a cer-
tain time of night. You could also turn lights on and off according to a clock so 
that you capture exactly the right mood at different times of the evening.

Water Consumption

 Using less water in the bathroom
 Landscaping your way to savings
T
he minimum human requirement for water is only around four gallons 
per day, and that’s for both consumption and cleaning. So how much 
does a typical family (2 adults, 2 kids) use? Between 200 and 350 gallons of 
water a day. That’s 73,000 to 128,000 gallons per year. Landscaping, swimming 
pools, and spas take even more water. A small, working ranch may use over 
270,000 gallons per year. Bluntly put, that’s a well of a lot of water.
In most homes, water has four main destinations: faucets, showers (baths), 
dishwashers, and washing machines. In each case, water heating may be 
required, which consumes around 20 percent of a typical home’s energy 
costs. Other uses of water include outdoor irrigation, pools, spas, fountains, 
and so on. This chapter tells you how to save in these areas.
 
The vast majority of homes get their water from the local utility, some with 
metered rate structures, some not. If you’re not operating off of a water meter, 
your water utility may give you a better monthly rate if you voluntarily go to 
a metered rate structure. The utility will come out and install a meter, usually 
free of charge. If you’re frugal, you can save money, and by having a meter 
you’ll be more conscious of how much water you’re using.

Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
Drinking to Your Health
Most of the water used in a home isn’t consumed. Instead, it’s used for tasks 
like cleaning, watering, and so on. Yet many people today spend much more 
money for water they drink than on water they use for these other purposes. 
Why? Because our society is fixated on bottled and/or purified drinking 
water, which is almost always a waste of money and resources, and generates 
far more pollution than is necessary. In fact, evidence increasingly indicates 
that drinking purified water may lead to health problems. So what’s the deal?
To help you sort out what you need to know about your water supply and 
to give you ideas for reducing the amount of money you spend on drinking 
water, I offer the following sections.
Wading through a flood of choices: Tap, 
well, bottled, and purified
Most homes have a number of choices for their water sources. In this section, 
I review the most common choices. Your best bet is to use the cheapest 
source for each of your various applications. Most of the time, this is very 
easy; simply use tap water.
Tap water
Most homes get their water from local utilities, which have stringent quality 
requirements. In fact, federal standards for tap water are actually higher than 
those for bottled water. In addition, most tap water already contains minerals 
important to your health — minerals that some purveyors of purifier systems 
and bottled water deliberately add to their products and charge you more 
for. Bottom line: The government provides you with safe, healthy water, 
without the hassle and expense of bottled water.
 
Local utilities are required to make public their testing process and results. 
If you want to know exactly what’s in your water, call the customer-service 
number on your utility bill and ask to be sent the data. There shouldn’t be a 
charge for this.

139
 Chapter 10: Watering Down Your Water Consumption
Well water
Some homes get their water from wells. Although these sources are 
generally very good, they may not be the best source for drinking water 
because contaminants do make their way into wells, and you may have 
to pay for testing. Well water is especially prone to change over time. If 
you have a well, you’re very likely getting the requisite minerals and other 
natural components. But you may also be getting pollution and other 
contaminants like dumped pesticides or other chemicals.
 
If you have a well, test it at least once a year; if your well fails a test, test more 
often. Look in the yellow pages under “Water Well Drilling.”
Bottled water
Bottled water costs 240 to 10,000 times more than tap water. The costs 
show up in bottling, packaging, shipping, retail, sales, advertising, and so 
on. If you’re paying this price for bottled water simply because you think it’s 
cleaner, you may want to consider these facts:
 
 Quality isn’t guaranteed. Unlike the water provided by utilities, the 
quality of bottled water isn’t regulated by the federal government. That 
means when you buy bottled water you have no guarantee that you’re 
even getting water that’s as good as your home supply.
 
 “Enriched” may not provide enrichment. Some bottled water is 
advertised as “oxygen enriched.” Absolutely no evidence exists to 
support the notion that this does anything whatsoever to help you.
 
 Transporting water is costly. Bottled water takes a great deal of energy 
to transport to your store shelf. Think how far that water from the Italian 
mountain lake has come, and then think of the pollution generated in the 
process. It doesn’t matter that the water is cheap; the cost of pollution is 
not reflected in the cost of a product (although this is rapidly changing).
 
 America’s appetite for bottled water gobbles up more than 47 million 
gallons of oil and produces one billion pounds of carbon dioxide per 
year (that’s right — billion!).
 
 Plastic bottles stick around for a very long time. It takes 1,000 years for 
a plastic bottle to degrade in a landfill. You can recycle the bottles (see 
Chapter 14), but if you don’t need them in the first place, recycling isn’t 
the best answer. Not using them is.
 
 If you want to use bottles of water because they’re convenient, use 
reusable bottles. You can fill these up with tap water. Alternatively, 
buy purified water at a grocery store that lets you bring in and fill up 
your own bottles and charges you by the gallon.

140
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
Purified water
Many people use water purifiers, systems that in most cases remove 
impurities but in some cases add minerals and other positive substances.
We humans don’t necessarily need perfect water. In fact, evidence suggests 
that a pristine lifestyle leads to increased immune deficiency. Certain types 
of minerals and bacteria are required by the human body to enable digestion. 
And recent studies indicate that children raised on purified water are 
statistically more likely to suffer from childhood diseases than those 
brought up on tap water. The reason? The immune system needs to be 
constantly exercised in order to achieve optimum conditioning (just like 
muscles). Humans that live in sanitized, pristine environments don’t get the 
necessary exposure.
Having said that, sometimes having a water purifying system is a good idea. 
The next section explains how to tell when your water supply is problematic 
and what you can do about it.
Getting the goods on suspicious water
In rare cases, you may actually have good reason to be suspicious of your 
water source. Potential contaminants include pernicious bacteria, cysts 
(parasites with protective coverings that make them very tenacious), heavy 
metals, chlorine, sediment, poisons, and many more.
Signs of a potential problems
Signs that your water supply may be contaminated include
 
 Age of your pipes: In old plumbing systems, some contaminants reside 
right in the pipes and are very difficult to get out. If your city water 
supply is pristine but you have an old home, you may still have a problem 
because you’re running clear water through contaminated pipes.
 
 Clarity: Although unclear water is not a sure indicator of contamination, 
you should find out what the cause is. Most of the time it’s only minerals, 
which isn’t a problem.
 
 Poor taste: Bad tasting water may be a sign of a contaminant. But 
determining whether the bad taste indicates a real problem or just 
tastes different than you’re used to is difficult (it’s very common to go 
into other cities and find that the water tastes poor, even though it’s 
just fine). If in doubt, get your water tested.
 
 Smell: The human nose is very sensitive. If your water smells bad, get it 
tested (although a bad smell isn’t necessarily an indicator that it’s unhealthy).

 Chapter 10: Watering Down Your Water Consumption
Testing options
If you’re suspicious about the quality of your water, the best bet is to get 
your water tested. Here are your options:
 
 Have your water tested by an independent company. Check the 
Internet or your phone book for “Water Testing.” For around $100, you 
can get a detailed analysis. (They send you a sterilized container; you fill 
it and send it back.) You need to do every testing sequence twice, at 
different times of the year, to get reliable results.
 
 Have your water tested by a not-so-objective company. You can get tests 
done by water purification companies (probably for free). But beware: 
Their goal is to sell you water purification equipment or services. They 
probably won’t tell you that humans do better with impurities in their 
water supply. And — surprise, surprise — every water company that I’ve 
ever talked to has assured me that their water is the best.
 
 Test your water yourself. Although you can buy your own equipment 
and test your water yourself, I don’t recommend it. First, it’s expensive. 
Second, and more importantly, you probably don’t have the expertise to 
interpret the results sufficiently. It’s best to trust the experts.
Purifying your drinking water
So you’ve decided to improve your drinking water. Two types of home-based 
equipment are widely available:
 
 Distilleries: Distilled water is boiled, and, in the process, the water 
separates from the impurities. This type of purification is expensive and 
energy-intensive, but it’s very thorough.
 
 Filtration systems: Filtering involves forcing the water through some 
kind of porous device that removes the impurities. Aerator filters that 
attach to faucets are the simplest type of filter.
As you consider your water purifying options, look for a system that only 
treats the water you plan to consume. After all, it makes no sense to filter 
water for your shower or your dishwasher. In addition, make sure the system 
targets the impurities you want targeted. Some systems only improve the 
water’s taste and color. Others get rid of contaminants. Make sure you know 
what your system does.

142
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
 
It makes no sense to invest in purification equipment if you haven’t had your 
water tested. Simply buying a filter because it sounds good is a waste of 
money, although most filters are purchased for this very reason. Purification 
equipment targets very specific types of contamination. Before you make an 
investment, make sure the equipment you’re getting is designed to remove the 
contaminant you’re interested in removing.
 
All systems take effort and maintenance. If you don’t want to hassle with water 
purification, consider one of these alternatives:
 
 Contract with a bottled water company. A bottled water company will 
rent you a dispenser and come out twice a month to refill it with a big 
jug of distilled or filtered water and do the regular maintenance. The 
cost is around $8 per month. You can get dispensers that will heat the 
water, which is more efficient than using your water heater but less 
efficient than using your microwave.
 
 Get a bottle with a built-in filter. This is the cheapest way to go, and you 
only use this system when you need it. Fill the bottle with water from 
your tap, screw the filter/lid on, and, when you drink, the water is filtered. 
Three micron porosity is good for removing bacteria and giardiasis. This 
simple scheme will satisfy most people’s desire to filter their water.
Mechanical filtration
Mechanical filtration occurs when water is forced through a porous medium, 
like a screen or a chunk of carbon. These strainers use mesh with particular 
hole sizes. The size of the holes determines the strainer’s porosity, which 
is usually specified in terms of microns (a micron is one millionth of a liter, 
on the order of size of mineral chunks). As you would expect, strainers with 
finer porosity remove smaller-sized contaminants than strainers with higher 
porosity.
To get an idea about what type of porosity you need, you have to determine 
what type of contaminant you’re trying to remove. Sediment filters, for 
example, remove smaller particles like suspended dirt, sand, rust, and scale 
(known as turbidity). Once again, filters are always very specific to the type 
of material you are attempting to filter. Look on the filter label (or get on the 
Internet and research a particular filter’s specifications) to see which types 
of contaminants it’s good at filtering.
 
If you need a filter with a very fine porosity, it’s generally a good idea to 
remove the biggest impurities by using a higher porosity filter first. Larger 
porosity filters are generally much cheaper than smaller porosity filters (and 
easier to clean), so by catching the big stuff first, your overall filter expenses 
will be less.

143
 Chapter 10: Watering Down Your Water Consumption
Activated carbon filtration
Carbon absorption filters are the most widely used because they offer high 
performance at a low price. They remove many types of contaminants as 
well as chlorine, but they don’t affect water hardness. Few carbon systems 
work with lead, asbestos, VOCs (dissolved organics), cysts, and coliform, so 
if these are your issues, carbon filters aren’t recommended. In fact, most of 
the impurities that carbon filters remove are not the impurities that you are 
targeting. In addition, carbon filters need to be changed frequently, and this 
can be very costly.
Making your own solar water purifier
Here’s a great project for the do-it-yourselfer. 
If salty or contaminated water is left in an open 
container, the water evaporates, leaving the 
contaminants behind. If the water is heated, 
the process speeds up considerably (this is 
the basis for a distillery). Here’s a simple solar 
water purifier you can build for next to nothing, 
if you’re clever and good with tools.
Reflective
Surface
Transparent
Glazing
Tray with
contaminated
water; black
or other
absorptive
quality
Insulation
Catch
Trough
Sunlight
South
When the water evaporates, it condenses on 
the glass window and drips down into the catch 
trough. Tilt the catch trough just slightly and put 
a bottle or other container underneath the low 
end, and voilà! Purified water. (Large, efficient 
versions of this device capable of purifying 
hundreds of gallons a day are used in third-
world countries.)
  You can make your system as cheap or 
as expensive as you want. You don’t need 
glazed glass; you can use plain old window 
glass. You can get pieces of discarded glass 
from window shops for nothing but a smile.
  Reflection is easily accomplished with 
aluminum foil, shiny side out.
  Use sheet metal (the best option) or 
wood for the enclosure. If you want to get 
imaginative, find a good metal box and cut 
a hole for the glaze cover.
  Paint the box black to enhance absorption.
  A system the size of a small stove can yield 
up to three gallons of purified water on a 
sunny day.
The first few times you use this device the water 
may taste a little odd. Let the system “sweat” for 
a few weeks and the bad taste will go away.
Here’s a little tip: When designing your unit, 
make it convenient to fill the inner tray with 
water. Position it by a hose, for instance. Then 
you won’t have to carry water to your system. 
Configure some kind of funnel through the 
sidewall so you can pour the water right into the 
tray without spilling. Make it so you can remove 
the glazing top and clean out the tray, because 
the contaminants are going to remain behind. 
You’ll get a good idea of how mineralized your 
tap water is when you see what’s left in the tray 
over a period of time.

144
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
Reverse osmosis (ultrafiltration)
This method uses pressure to force water through a selective, semipermeable 
membrane that separates contaminants from the water. Reverse osmosis 
systems are very good at removing turbidity, asbestos, lead and other heavy 
metals, radium and VOCs. But keep these things in mind:
 
 Membranes are costly to replace. Most are capable of having the 
membrane washed out (backwashing), but the membranes do 
eventually need to be replaced, and this isn’t cheap.
 
 They waste a lot of water. They use 3 to 9 gallons of water to get one 
pure gallon. This is a dubious way to achieve efficiency.
Virustat filters
Virustat filters eliminate viruses from water sources in foreign cities or wild 
streams. For the most part, these viruses don’t affect local folks because they 
are used to them and have built up a tolerance.
Weighing in on water softeners
Some water is very high in mineral content. 
This is termed hard water. Minerals can cause 
scaling and buildups of white crud within 
plumbing systems. Some people are also 
sensitive to hard water. In particular, you can 
feel the sediments in your hair when you’re 
done with a shower. With hard water, you 
get a sense that you’re never really all that 
clean. But hard water doesn’t pose any health 
problems, so installing a water softener is 
always discretionary. People generally do 
it only when the scaly buildup gets out of 
hand — for instance, when valves begin to 
fail and kitchen equipment gets so scaly that 
nothing shines anymore.
Water softening systems simply remove mineral 
deposits from the water by passing it through a 
filtering mechanism. The vast majority of water 
softeners incorporate a filter self-cleaning 
cycle that uses salt pellets that you refill on a 
periodic basis. (Bags of salt pellets cost around 
$5 apiece and are widely available in grocery 
stores. You’ll need a strong back to dump the 45 
pound bags into your water softener — teenage 
boys are excellent sources for strong backs.)
Water softeners are expensive. Plus the back-
washing of water softeners wastes a lot of 
water, and you need to have some means of 
getting the backwashed liquid to go to a drain 
(this results in salt buildup there, which can be 
a problem in its own right).
You can install a water softener yourself, but 
only if you’re competent with tools. Look for 
features that make the periodic maintenance 
easier, like a low hopper for feeding salt and 
easy-to-understand digital programming 
instructions. Also consider connecting the 
softener to certain faucets only, such as those 
in the kitchen and bath. You certainly don’t need 
softened water outdoors or in your garage.

 Chapter 10: Watering Down Your Water Consumption
Caring for your filters
As the filter cruds up, its effectiveness diminishes, so when reading specs, 
always remember that you need to change filters as often as the manufacturer 
recommends or you may not achieve the required performance.
Also, as the filter gets older it traps impurities of all kinds, so it may actually 
become a breeding ground for nasty little critters invisible to the naked eye, 
making the problem worse, not better.
Directing the Flow of Traffic with 
Faucets
The typical home has six indoor faucets, and another four or five outdoors. 
That gives you a lot of opportunities for improved efficiency. Just by making 
a few changes in your faucets, you can use water more efficiently.
Some relatively easy changes you can make include
 
 Using a two-valve faucet. A two-valve faucet is more efficient than a 
single-valve type (where you move the lever around until you get the 
right temperature). The latter inevitably wastes hot water.
 
 Using aerator filters in the faucets. These filters add air and keep up 
the pressure while reducing flow volume. Most of the time, people are 
looking for greater pressure, not flow volume, from a faucet. In fact, 
many building codes now require low-flow faucets because they make so 
much sense (they save water without being inconvenient).
Of course, dealing with leaks is a great way to not only increase how efficiently 
you use water but also to offset some other problems as well. Read on to find 
out more.
Leaks: Money and energy down the drain
Leaky faucets waste water. A faucet dripping once per second can waste 
2,000 gallons per year. Beyond just the waste factor, leaking faucets can also 
cause increased health issues because mold and mildew just love damp 
environments (see Chapter 6 for details).

146
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
In addition, a dripping faucet can humidify your entire house. In the summer, 
higher humidity means less comfort. Do not underestimate this effect — it’s 
much more pronounced than you may think (see Chapter 8 for more on how 
to control the humidity in your home). So not only are you wasting water, but 
also your house is uncomfortable and your air-conditioner is running more 
(which means wasted utility costs).
The largest cost is the heat being wasted when hot water is drawn from your 
water heater. If a faucet is dripping, it may be drawing hot water. If it’s 
dripping very slowly, you may not even know it’s dripping hot water because 
by the time that water has come all the way from your water heater through 
the pipes to your faucet, it has cooled down. But heat is still being wasted.
If your water pressure is high, you probably experience dripping faucets, 
especially outdoors where leaks are more likely to go unnoticed. High 
pressure basically means higher force, which can push through questionable 
seals. You can have a pressure regulator installed on your water system, but 
it’s probably not worth the hassle. If you have high water pressure, you need 
to be sure to provide adequate maintenance for your seals and gaskets.
 
Outdoor faucets are more prone to leakage than indoor ones because they’re 
generally cheaper, plus they get beat up by the weather (constantly changing 
temperature is hard on metals). Replace outdoor faucets that leak. This is 
much easier than replacing indoor faucets, and anybody can do it with the 
right wrench and patience level.
Obviously, the only way to deal with a leaking faucet is to fix it. Before you 
tackle the job, though, keep these suggestions in mind:
 
 Shut off all the water. Shut-off valves are generally found below sinks 
and the like, but simply shutting the water off in your entire home when 
doing plumbing jobs is a good idea. You can find a whole house shutoff 
valve in the utility box either in front of your home or in your basement 
(most of the time it’ll be right next to your water meter, if you have one). 
Many homes also have an underground container near the roadway 
(watch out for spiders when you stick your hand in).
 
 Be careful to get it right. Make sure you understand what you’re doing 
before you start, and make sure you have the right tools (and good 
ones). To find out how to fix leaky faucets, ask at your local hardware 
store. They have tons of experience with dripping faucets and usually 
know the types used in your community. You can also find instructions 
for fixing dripping faucets in How to Fix Everything For Dummies by Gary 
and Pam Hedstrom and Judy Ondrla Tremore (Wiley).
 
 Almost anybody can do plumbing, but if you don’t do it exactly right, 
you have to do it over until you do get it exactly right.

147
 Chapter 10: Watering Down Your Water Consumption
 
 Take a picture before you start. Whenever you take a plumbing system 
apart for repairs or maintenance, use a digital camera to snap shots 
once in awhile so that if you forget where things go, you can look back at 
the pictures. Once the job is done, delete the pictures (unless you want 
to add them to your family collection).
 
Don’t feel up to the job? Then hire a plumber and watch him fix the leak. Then 
next time you encounter a leaky tap, you can do the job yourself. (Of course, 
watching a plumber work, you may decide you never, ever want to do 
plumbing. Either lesson is worth the money.)
A few more tips for using water wisely
Beyond fiddling with the faucets and fixing leaks, you can do a few other 
things to use water more efficiently:
 
 Avoid using your garbage disposal. It requires a lot of water to run and 
ends up filling the septic or sewer system far more than is needed. Get a 
composter and start a little garden, or toss the waste into your garbage. 
See Chapter 14 for more details.
 
 Don’t waste cold water waiting for the hot. When you need hot water, 
you generally run water down the drain until it shows up. Instead, put a 
pot, bowl, or other container under the faucet while you’re waiting for 
the water to get hot, and then use the cold water you collect for cooking, 
ice cubes, or whatever. Just don’t waste it.
 
 Don’t leave the tap running while you’re doing something else. 
Whether you’re brushing your teeth or cleaning off the countertop, turn 
the water off. It’s an easy habit to break, and you’d be surprised how 
much difference it can make.
Savings in Showers and Baths
When you’re thinking about water consumption, you need to factor in two 
things: heat and water. Heating water accounts for around 20 percent of the 
power bill in a home, and showers and baths use 37 percent of that. That 
means that around 6 percent of your power bill is dedicated to heating water 
for your shower and baths. You can save in both areas.

148
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
 
 Forget baths. They’ll become a thing of the past when energy rates get 
high enough. You simply can’t take an economical bath.
 
 Double up. Put the kids (appropriately aged, of course) into the shower 
together. Or take a shower with your partner (I could make some wise 
comments here, but I suspect I don’t really need to).
 
 Use handheld showerheads. These focus better, allowing much less 
water to do the job (if you think about it, most of the water flowing from 
a showerhead is wasted). The downside is you have to hold them.
 
 Avoid showerheads that “mist” the water. They humidify your home 
more than anything, and the mist does no good at all. This is especially 
inefficient in the summer.
 
 Take shorter showers. Lingering in the heat is nice, but it wastes energy 
because all you get out of it is, well, lingering in the heat. Find something 
else to linger in.
 
 Avoid things that make your shower a pleasant living quarters, like 
radios, TVs, nice views, and so on. In order to be truly efficient, a shower 
should be strictly functional.
 
 Install a “greywater” recycle system on your shower and bath drain. 
These systems basically recycle your home’s water. A tank is connected 
to certain drains (usually everything but the toilet) and then a chemical 
sanitizing process is performed that brings the water up to cleanliness 
standards suitable for landscaping and even washing. The best systems can 
clean water well enough to be consumed. Not only does greywater offset 
the demand for treating water to the highest potable standard, but it also 
may actually be beneficial to plants as it’s likely to contain nitrogen and 
phosphorous. Installing one of these systems when building a new house is 
a lot more economically efficient than retrofitting an existing house.
 
Water-wise, baths take 20 gallons or more of water, but a five-minute shower 
takes around 10 gallons, making baths about twice as expensive as showers. 
On the other hand, a shower can consume more water if you have an old-style 
showerhead, which typically delivers 4 to 5 gallons per minute — quite a rich 
and wasteful flow of water. To address this issue, the Energy Policy Act of 
1992 set maximum water flow rates at 2.5 gallons per minute, so new houses 
and new showerheads are almost always at or below this number. New 
showerheads are designed to use less water and create more water pressure 
so you aren’t aware that you’re getting less.
 
You can easily measure the flow of your showerhead. Simply get a pitcher 
with gallons marked on the side. While you count one-Mississippi, two-
Mississippi, and so on, run your showerhead into the pitcher until you’ve got 
one gallon. Divide 60 by your Mississippi count and you have your flow rate in 
gallons per minute. As mentioned previously, 2.5 is the current standard, but 
you can do better than this without sacrificing much quality.

149
 Chapter 10: Watering Down Your Water Consumption
Wasting Water in the Toilet
Toilets consume (a bad word, I agree) 45 percent of indoor water use, or 
around 32,000 gallons per year for a family of four. A running toilet (one that 
makes a constant hissing noise — you know what I mean), can waste up to 
4,000 gallons of water per year. Fortunately, you can solve these problems, if 
you’re willing to do a little dirty work.
Parts is parts
Many people hate the idea of working on a toilet because, well, it’s a toilet. 
But if you’re going to work on your toilet, you need to know the difference 
between one part and another. Trust me. Here’s how it all breaks down:
 
 The tank: This is the part above the throne (uh yes, it’s called the 
throne). The tank is perfectly clean. (In fact, the water in the toilet tank 
is as clean as the tap water that’s filling it.) Fortunately, that’s where the 
working parts are.
 
 The water pipes that feed the tank: These come from the wall and 
there’s always a valve which will shut off the water flow to the toilet.
 
 The toilet bowl thingee: The throne itself, fit for a king, queen, prince, 
princess, or toilet-trained house cat, as the case may be.
 
 The plumbing system: This is the part that takes away whatever gets 
flushed down. Obviously, this is the part that you don’t want to work on.
Solar showering
For fifteen bucks you can get a solar shower 
that works great. You fill a dark-colored plastic 
bag with water, hang it in the sun for an hour or 
so, and then hang it up in a tree or whatever’s 
convenient. You open the little valve and get a 
nice, gentle flow of hot water, au naturel.
Of course, these are for particular locations 
(outdoors mostly, although not necessarily — 
you can heat one up outside and bring it inside), 
and you also need good weather, with plenty of 
sunshine. But they work great after workouts 
or by the swimming pool or spa. Once you try 
it a few times you can easily get hooked just 
because they’re so natural. If you’re into green, 
this is a great option.
And you can use one as a giant water bottle. 
Very soothing.

Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
Easy ways to cut down on water usage
Following are a few tips for saving on toilet water:
 
 At least for number one (man, I love euphemisms), don’t use the toilet at 
all — go outside instead. You think I’m jesting? The birds and the bees 
do it; are you better than them? (I remember a bumper sticker that was 
common in California back in the 1980s during a particularly tenacious 
water shortage: “If it’s yellow, be mellow; if it’s brown, flush it down.”) 
 
 Don’t use the toilet as a trash can; it’s very expensive compared to a 
waste basket. Toilets are for butts, not cigarette butts.
 
 If you put a couple quart bottles filled with water in the tank, each flush 
will use that much less water. Bricks or rocks also work.
What to do when your toilet runs
If you’re toilet is running, you need to chase, er . . . I mean fix it. Fortunately, 
finding the problem is almost always simple. The most common problem in 
a running toilet is the flapper, which is a rubber disk that covers the hole 
where the water enters the toilet bowl. These are so ridiculously easy to 
change that anybody can do it. Go to your hardware store and ask the clerk 
to show you how (they must sell a thousand of these things a day).
Every single hardware store on the face of the earth has toilet parts because, 
well, every single home has a toilet or two. Some homes even have ten toilets. 
Your hardware store clerk will be more than happy to explain in great detail 
exactly how your toilet works and show you the parts. You can touch them 
and play with them to your heart’s content. There are even clubs you can 
join.
 
You can completely rebuild the workings of most toilets with new parts that 
will probably work better than the old for less than $60. A plumber will charge 
a lot more than that, maybe on the order of hundreds of dollars.
 
If you have to work on the mechanisms in the toilet tank, first drain the tank 
by turning off the shut-off valve (all toilets have a shut-off valve where the 
water source comes out of the wall) and flushing. The tank will empty down to 
an inch or two. Now you can work on the working parts.

151
 Chapter 10: Watering Down Your Water Consumption
Updated toilet designs
Nothing is worse than flushing a toilet and looking back down to find that 
it wasn’t 100 percent effective. (Okay, one thing is worse — when the toilet 
clogs up and overflows all over the bathroom floor, especially when you’re in 
somebody else’s house.)
The old standard technology in toilets simply uses gravity feed to rush the 
water down into the bowl and carry away the waste products and any residue 
left clinging to the toilet walls. This works well enough most of the time, but it 
uses a lot of water, so less wasteful designs that accomplished the same thing 
came into being.
Pressure-assist toilets
Pressure-assist toilets use much less water per flush and actually work better. 
The water is held in the tank under pressure, and when you trigger the flush 
lever it explodes down into the toilet bowl, thereby removing residue that may 
otherwise cling. These toilets are costly ($250 apiece) and hard to fix, plus 
they’re very loud so everybody in the house is going to know what you just did.
 
Most public facilities use pressure-assist toilets. If you’re considering a pressure 
assist toilet, you can decide firsthand if you want this loud noise in your own 
home by going into almost any public facility and sampling the wares.
Vacuum-assist toilets
Vacuum assist toilets suck waste right out of the bowl (which is sort of the 
opposite of the pressure-assist method of blasting it out). They’re cheaper 
than their pressure-assist counterparts and easier to fix. But the very idea is 
also much ickier! Imagine being a vacuum-assist toilet.
Compost toilets
Compost toilets don’t flush at all. Hmm. You need to be a hearty soul to 
consider these devices, but they’re very earth-friendly. They basically allow 
the waste products to decompose in a specially designed chamber. At some 
point, you can take the “materials” out of the “finishing drawer” and to 
your landscaping (probably not your vegetable garden, unless you’re really 
hearty).

Watering Your Landscaping
Ah, the great outdoors. Most people have some form of landscaping, and 
many people have extensive landscaping, including a lawn, which is the most 
water- and energy-intense form of landscaping you can imagine. In a yard, 
you can conserve water through your landscaping choices and through your 
choice of sprinkler. The following sections tell you how to use less water and 
energy in your yard.
For green landscaping supplies, check out the following sources:
 
 Composters.com (www.composters.com)
 
 Hobbs and Hopkins, Ltd. (www.protimelawnseed.com)
 
 No Mow Grass (www.nomowgrass.com)
 
 TerraCycle (www.terracycle.net)
Considering lawn alternatives
The one thing you can do to conserve the most water and energy is to get rid of 
your lawn. Replace it with drought-resistant plants, and don’t water them much 
(create a drought of your own!). You can also replace your lawn with native 
plants that grow and thrive in your climate without need for additional watering 
(above and beyond what Mother Nature provides). Barring that, you can
 
 Set the height levers on your lawn mower an inch higher. Less heat will 
hit the dirt beneath the grass, thereby allowing you to water less. And 
longer grass chokes out the weeds much better than short grass, so you 
won’t have to use herbicides.
 
 Use a mulching mower, which helps fertilize the grass.
Taking energy efficiency to the limit
A toilet style finding widespread use in coun-
tries where water is scarce features a little 
sink on top of the toilet tank. You wash your 
hands and other sundry items in the sink, and 
that water then drains down into the toilet tank. 
When you flush the toilet, it’s not clean, pristine 
water, but it hardly matters. This makes a lot 
of sense because it’s so simple and effective. 
Look to see more of these in the future.

 Chapter 10: Watering Down Your Water Consumption
Picking the right sprinkler and watering 
at the right time
If you need to water your lawn, all sprinklers are not created equal. Some 
waste more water than they apply to the plants. And you can also control the 
time of day or night you do your watering to gain better efficiency.
 
 If you need to water an large area, use rotary sprinklers, which work 
the best. Avoid misting sprinklers because all they do is mist water 
into the air where it blows away into the neighbor’s yard. That may be 
efficient for them, but that’s not really what this book is about.
 
 Use drippers instead of broadcast sprinklers for isolated plants, 
particularly when they’re surrounded by bark or other ground 
cover that doesn’t need any watering at all. You may have to spend 
more money up front on hardware, but you’ll save a lot of water and 
your plants will be much healthier because they’re getting water right 
where they want it — in their root systems. Plus, they’re fun do-it-
yourself projects because you get to play with all these little parts 
that go very well together — at least in theory.
 
 A drip system needs to be maintained. Check it once in awhile by turning 
it on manually and making sure all the drippers are working.
 
 Water at night or early in the morning. The sunshine will be less likely 
to evaporate most of the water before it gets to where it’s used.
 
 Use battery-operated valves. They save water by regulating the amount 
that’s delivered. If you turn your system off and on manually, you’ll 
forget about it. Battery valves can be set to open for a predetermined 
period of time. These generally fit right onto the faucet for a good 
mechanically rigid mount.
 
 You can get small, cheap valves that you set for a number of gallons 
instead of time. These work very well for gardens and when your water 
pressure varies.
 
 Use barrels under downspouts to catch rainwater. You can then use 
the rainwater for other purposes. If you can, position the barrel in an 
elevated position (for instance, set it up on some concrete blocks); then 
simply use gravity feed when you need water.

ncluding your domestic water heater, around 40 percent of your power 
bill is consumed by your appliances, big and small. And just because an 
appliance is small in stature doesn’t mean it’s small in energy consumption.
Understanding how much power your appliances consume is the first step 
toward recovering from the rampant disease of appliancism. You can lower 
your power bills by using your appliances more sensibly — or even better, 
by not using your appliances at all. For instance, a great way to lower your 
power bill is to set up a clothesline. As with all energy efficiency investments, 
you need to take the bull by the horns.
Looking at Typical Appliance 
Consumption Numbers
Aside from your HVAC system (which I cover in detail in Chapter 8), appliances 
consume the lion’s share of power in your home. Some of the biggest culprits 
in most homes are water heaters, washers and dryers, and refrigerators, which 
are on all the time. There are exceptions, of course. Some homes have aquariums 
that collectively steal the spotlight. Other homes have an old freezer in the 
garage that cranks the kilowatts 24/7. Increasingly common are homes with 
large entertainment centers, and these can gobble kilowatts with the biggest 
and baddest of energy pigs.

156
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
So what does the typical home spend per year on various electrical appliances? 
Table 11-1 shows you how many kilowatts per hour (kWh) the average home 
uses in a year and the annual cost (based on an electric rate of 15 cents per 
kWh, which is pretty typical).
You can determine your own annual usage and cost by gathering your 
electric bills, which show kWh used and your rate (see the next section for 
details). If your rate is higher or lower than 15 cents, adjust it accordingly. 
If you use gas or propane for your dryer, water heater, or stove, the annual 
cost will be around the same as for electric.

 Chapter 11: Pigging Out on Power with Appliances 
Analyzing Appliance Consumption 
in Your Home
To find out how much an appliance costs per month to run, first estimate 
how much time it’s on per day. Then determine how much power it consumes. 
You can usually find this information on the label, but you may have to consult 
the instruction manual or go to the manufacturer’s Web site.
Use this formula to estimate your monthly cost to run an appliance:
Wattage ÷ 1,000 × hours on per day × cost per kWh × 30days = total cost 
per month
Say you want to know how much it costs you to run your washer, dryer, and 
iron (assume that your rate is 15 cents per kWh):
Washer: You run your 900-watt washing machine for six hours a week. 
(Figure your daily usage by dividing the number of hours the washer is on by 
the number of days in a week: 6 ÷ 7 = .86). Here’s what you spend:
900 ÷ 1,000 × .86 × .15 × 30 = $3.48 per month
Dryer: Your clothes dryer uses 5,570 watts (that’s a whole lot). If you dry 
clothes for six hours a week, you spend this much to dry your clothes:
5,570 ÷ 1,000 × .86 × .15 × 30 = $21.56 per month
Kill-A-Watt
The best way to determine an appliance’s 
energy consumption is to make a precise 
measurement, and the best device I’ve seen 
for measuring appliance power usage is the 
Kill-A-Watt, made by the P3 Company (www.
realgoodscatalog.com; around $30).
Simply plug it into your wall outlet and plug an 
appliance into it, and it will digitally monitor the 
appliance’s power usage. It outputs the number 
of kWh used in a given number of hours.
Unfortunately, the device doesn’t work for 
220VAC appliances or for hard-wired appliances 
like water heaters.

158
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
Iron: If you iron clothes with a 1,200-watt iron each morning for 15 minutes, 
it’s costing you:
1,200 ÷ 1,000 × .25 × .15 × 30 = $1.35 per month
Add up these numbers and you can see that for the appliances you use to 
keep your clothing clean and pressed, you spend a total of $26.40 per month.
If you put up a clothesline, you would save $21.56 per month (and around 
1,748 pounds per year of carbon dioxide emissions). Plus, your clothes would 
smell better and you could pat yourself on the back for doing your part to 
save the planet Earth.
 
You can work this number stuff to death, but what you really want to do is 
simply make sensible improvements in your efficiency. Start with your biggest 
appliances and work your way down. Some appliances are easy to use less 
often; others are harder to do without. It also makes sense to start with the 
appliances you use the most. Just do your part where you can, and you’ll be 
surprised at the difference it makes.
 
You can find out how much your old appliances are costing by visiting www.
energystar.gov. Click on Home Appliances and enter the year, size, and 
other data for your old appliance. A calculator tells you how much your 
current unit is costing, as well as how much you could save if you switched to 
a new, energy-efficient model.
Keeping Water Heaters in Check
The water heater accounts for about 20 percent of the typical home’s power 
budget. Dishwashers and washing machines use up to 80 percent of their 
energy on heating water, and only 20 percent running the mechanical 
equipment. The cost of taking showers and baths is almost entirely in the 
cost of heating water.
Unfortunately, the typical domestic water heater is wasteful. It holds a 
considerable amount of hot water, and when it’s not being used, heat seeps 
out of the tank, which is sheer inefficiency. The best water heaters have thick 
insulation, but some heat is still lost.
So what can you do to save on water heating costs? Follow the advice in the 
following sections.

159
 Chapter 11: Pigging Out on Power with Appliances 
Paying attention to pipes
When you use hot water, not only do you drain the water you use from the 
hot water tank, but all the intervening plumbing fills with hot water as well. 
The amount of hot water trapped in your pipes can be significant, depending 
on how you’re using the water and how far away the faucet or tap is from the 
tank.
If you’re taking a bath, the amount of water in the pipes is small compared 
to the amount in the tub, so you’re not wasting a lot of hot water (aside from 
the fact that taking a bath is inherently wasteful compared to a shower). But 
if you’re simply filling a cup with hot water, you’re leaving a heck of a lot 
more hot water in the pipes than you’re actually using. You’re almost always 
better off heating water in the microwave oven than drawing it from a tap.
Making time stand still
Here’s an educational project. Try to get your 
power meter to stand still. Find your meter 
and note the spinning wheel and the numbers. 
(These are kWh. When the utility people come 
to read your meter, they read this number, then 
subtract the number they read last month to get 
your monthly consumption).
First, turn off the main breaker on your circuit 
panel. If your meter is still spinning, you have 
a ground fault, and you’re paying for electricity 
that’s basically going through the earth beneath 
your feet. This should not to be misconstrued as 
generosity; have your utility company come out 
and fix this right away.
If that checks out, turn the main breaker back 
on and check to see how fast it’s spinning. Now 
switch off every one of the individual breakers 
in your box; the spinning should stop, once 
again.
Now start switching the individual breakers 
back on, one at a time, and see what happens. 
The panel should have a well-articulated legend 
that tells you what each breaker is for: HVAC, 
laundry room, upstairs lights, and so on. The 
biggest switches (those with the biggest 
numbers, such as 30 or 50) are for your HVAC 
system and your clothes dryer. You may also 
have a swimming pool pump or spa that’s on 
a large circuit.
As you switch the individual breakers on, 
you can see how much power each of the 
individual circuits consumes. (Make sure each 
appliance you check is turned on so that it’s 
drawing current).
Here’s where things get interesting. You’ll 
probably find a circuit that draws current even 
when nothing is turned on in that room. In 
particular, note that TVs, computers, DVDs, and 
other digital devices draw current even when 
they’re turned off.
You can take this a step further by plugging 
in various small appliances like hair dryers, 
portable fans and heaters, electronic games, 
and so forth. You can see how fast the meter 
spins for each of these. Some of these little 
gadgets can make the meter look like the 
Tasmanian Devil.

160
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
Staying on top of maintenance
Regular maintenance goes a long way toward maximizing the efficiency 
of your hot water heater. Like your HVAC system, you should have your 
domestic water heater tuned up periodically (the gas version gets especially 
gummed up). The following sections outline areas to pay attention to.
Draining the tank
Every four months or so, drain a quart of water from your tank. There’s a 
valve near the bottom of the unit for this very purpose. Before you begin, 
consider where the drained water is going to go. If the heater is in your 
garage, you can broom the water outdoors. Otherwise, you may need a drain 
bucket. Be sure the bucket is shallow enough to accommodate the valve.
 
The water you drain from your water heater’s tank can be very hot, so be 
careful.
Draining a quart of water directly from your water heater’s tank prevents 
sediment buildup, which affects efficiency. If you haven’t tackled this task in 
years, you’ll be shocked at how much crud comes out.
Changing the heating elements
Change the heating elements in your electric water heater every few years 
(most of them have two elements, one on top and one on bottom). Use a 
stainless steel heater element if your old one is corroded. This makes the unit 
operate more efficiently and avoids untimely failures.
How much hot water are you wasting?
Here’s a little experiment you can easily perform 
to demonstrate just how much hot water you 
waste when you turn on your hot water faucet. 
Get a large pitcher with measurement grada-
tions. Hold it below your faucet and turn the hot 
water on. Now measure how much water fills 
the pitcher before you start getting hot water 
from the tap. You may be surprised to find up to 
two gallons or more have flowed through. This 
means that there are now two gallons of hot 
water sitting in your pipes, which is a big waste 
because all it will do is cool down and release 
the heat into your home’s environment.
A number of high-efficiency dishwashers heat 
their own water for this very reason. Heating 
locally is almost always more efficient. In addi-
tion, machines that heat their own water work 
better because they can maintain the specific 
temperature that they need.

161
 Chapter 11: Pigging Out on Power with Appliances 
When you buy the heater element, be sure to buy a special wrench head 
that fits the element; ask the hardware store clerk to help you find the right 
wrench. (You may be able to borrow one from a friend and save some money. 
And if you don’t return it, you can save even more.) Note that sometimes 
very old heating elements get stuck into place, in which case you can use 
WD-40: just spray it on, wait a day and then give it another try.
Finding more ways to save
Beyond regular maintenance, you can do several things to make your water 
heater more efficient. Temperature, timing, and insulation are all factors that 
come into play.
Setting the water temperature lower
Most domestic water heaters are set at too high a temperature. Scalding 
water is too hot. For each 10°F reduction in water heater temperature, you 
can expect to lower your heating cost by 3 to 5 percent. You may find your-
self dialing more hot water in your shower to get to the same comfort level, 
but so what? The most common problem you may encounter if you lower the 
temperature is that your dishwasher may not clean as well. You can usually 
remedy this by changing to a detergent that requires a lower temperature 
(read the label). See the section “Lessening the Load on Your Dishwasher” 
for more information.
Using timers
Hot water heaters consume a lot of energy when they’re on. Most of them 
aren’t on all that much, but when they are, they gobble power up. Use a timer 
to turn off your hot water heater at night and during the day when you’re 
gone. Specialty hardware stores sell special units for this purpose. The 
salespeople can tell you how to install them.
 
When you’re away from home for extended periods, turn the hot water heater 
off before you go. Either flip off the appropriate circuit breaker in your fuse 
box or turn off the gas valve (in which case you’ll have to relight the pilot). 
You may also be able to turn the temperature all the way down to minimum 
and then turn it back up when you return.
Adding insulation
Insulate the storage tank with a specially-made blanket. Your utility company 
may give you one free (call the customer-service number and ask). Or you 
can buy one for $10 to $20 at most hardware stores. A tank that’s warm to the 
touch is a clear sign that you’re losing heat and can save money and increase 
efficiency by adding insulation.

162
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
Insulating your hot water pipes is easy, and a number of options are available. 
The best is a long, cylindrical piece of foam with a slit lengthwise — you just 
slide it over a pipe and you’re done. Don’t worry about corners and inaccessible 
pipes — whatever you can cover helps increase efficiency. Another option is a 
fiberglass wrap that you roll around and around the pipe and then cover with a 
plastic tape material. This covers the pipe more completely than the slit foam, 
but it’s a lot harder to install, especially if the pipe is close to a wall.
Considering a solar or tankless 
water heater
Most North Americans (almost 55 percent) heat their water with natural gas. 
About 38 percent heat water with electricity. (The few others heat with oil 
and liquid petro gas.) However, two types of water heaters are increasingly 
being used for their energy efficiency: solar and tankless water heaters.
 
 Solar water heaters are the best from an energy-efficiency standpoint, 
but the economics vary greatly from region to region and depend on 
your power rates and rate structure. From a pollution perspective, you 
can’t do better than solar. See Chapter 16 for details.
 
 Tankless water heaters have no storage tank; they heat water as it is 
being used. They are generally gas-powered because of the need for very 
high, instantaneous power. They’re more expensive than conventional 
water heaters, but if you don’t use much hot water, you can save big in 
the long run.
 
 Smaller units only work with a single tap or faucet at one time, so if 
you’re interested in taking a bath while you’re doing the dishes, forget it. 
Large-capacity units cost around $1,000 (a conventional unit costs only 
$300). Units can save the typical family $100 per year, so the payback in 
extra investment cost is around 7 years.
 
 Tankless water heaters are especially good if you have a cabin or second 
home that you don’t use that often. In this case, you won’t be continu-
ously heating a big tank full of water while you’re gone. (And although 
you could turn your water heater off if you’re going away for a long time, 
if you’re like most people, you’ll forget. With a tankless water heater, 
you don’t  have to remember.)
Making the Most of Pools and Spas
Pools and spas can be very big expenses. They both require chemicals and 
filters. By definition, a spa — a hot tub with a whirlpool device — requires a 
heater. Many pool owners like to heat their pools, too. The following sections 
tell you how to save money on these energy hogs.

163
 Chapter 11: Pigging Out on Power with Appliances 
Making your pool energy-efficient
If you own either an above ground or an in-ground pool, there are a variety of 
ways to you can achieve the same performance at far less cost in energy as 
well as chemical consumption. In my experience, most pool owners can do a 
few very simple things and save big.
Optimizing operations
One way to increase how efficiently your pool runs is to do routine maintenance 
and make a few changes for optimal operation:
 
 Make sure all valves are working properly. If you have gate valves (the 
kind that lets you dial in the amount of water flow you want), replace 
them with ball valves, which are more efficient (ball valves are either 
on or off, and when they’re on they impede water flow much less than a 
gate valve). Make sure all ball valves are completely open or closed; it 
doesn’t make any sense to adjust one to half open.
 
 Keep the filter clean. A dirty filter loads the pump, which costs a lot more 
in terms of power. If your filter is old, replace it. Cartridge filters are much 
better than diatomaceious earth, which use a big cartridge full of loose 
sediment filter material that’s difficult to work with and expensive as well.
 
 Run your filter pump less. Most people run their pool pumps much 
longer than necessary. Try running yours half as long as you do now and 
see what happens. If you calculate how much it costs to run the average 
pool pump, the hair on the back of your neck will stand on end.
 
 Drain your pool in the off-season, and turn your pump off. If you can’t 
drain your pool, you’ll have to leave the pump on because the water will 
get so filthy you’ll need to drain it and change it. But you can’t drain it.
 
 Install windbreaks around your pool. Convection losses from wind can 
increase water evaporation 300 percent or more, which wastes not only 
water, but heat as well. Windbreaks keep your pool warmer with less 
evaporation.
Sealing in the heat: Solar pool covers
Despite the fact that the surface area of most swimming pools is large, very 
little sunlight is converted into heat. Pool water is transparent (hopefully), 
so sunlight simply passes right through. In addition, during the night, a pool 
loses a lot of whatever heat it manages to store up during the day.
The cheapest and most effective solar heating system for your swimming pool 
is a solar cover. A cover converts sunlight into heat, which then transfers into 
water. Some covers are black for this very reason. But the most widely used 
are made of inexpensive clear plastic that looks like bubble wrap. The air bubbles 
work as insulation: Heat that goes in can’t get out. You can get a cover for 
around 30 cents a square foot ($130 for an average-size pool).

164
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
Why do these covers work so well? Because they do the following:
 
 Prevent heat from escaping from your pool at night, when the air is 
cooler than the swimming pool. You can easily lose four or five degrees 
in temperature over the course of a cool night. If you use a heater to 
heat you water, it doesn’t need to work as hard to maintain (or return 
to) the set temperature. If you don’t use a heater, the retained heat just 
make the water that much warmer.
 
 Limit evaporation and retain heat. Each gallon of evaporated 80°F water 
removes about 8,000 Btu (2.34 kWh) from the pool.
 
 Reduce chemical depletion, which reduces cost and may be considered 
a form of energy conservation.
 
 Increase the temperature of an in-ground pool by 5°F for each 12 hours 
of coverage.
 
 You can extend your swim season a couple months just by using a 
plastic cover. For example, in the Midwest you may be able to swim in 
a covered pool from mid-April until mid-October, whereas a completely 
unheated pool would only be usable from mid-May until mid-September. 
You don’t need to cover your pool during the hottest months, which is 
when people want to swim the most. Just fold the cover up and store it 
whenever it’s not in use.
You don’t need to cover your entire pool to reap the benefits. If you have a 
kidney-shaped pool, floating a rectangular cover over the pool will still help 
considerably.
Covers have to be placed on and removed from the water. Many kinds of sys-
tems are available to assist you in this process, some manual, some automatic:
 
 Manual systems cost around $300. These roll up the cover, much like a 
window blind. But you still have to pull the cover back out over the pool, 
and you may have to get into the water first. In either case, cranking the 
handle is not easy; women and children may have a hard time.
 
 Automatic systems can cost over $1,000, and the installation is a bear. 
But all you have to do is press a switch and voilà! The cover moves back 
and forth of its own volition — at least in theory — all mechanical systems 
are prone to failures.
 
As beneficial as pool covers are, they do pose certain problems:
 
 Plastic pool covers: When plastic bubble wrap covers get old, they fray. 
Plastic shards can get into the filter and may even cut the filter paper, 
necessitating a new, expensive filter. Storing these covers in the sunlight 
(when they’re not wet) also causes the plastic to degrade.

165
 Chapter 11: Pigging Out on Power with Appliances 
 
 Any pool cover: Any pool cover can be dangerous! Anyone (particularly 
a child) who falls into a plastic pool cover will get “wrapped” by the 
cover, and getting out of this situation can be very difficult. Even automatic 
covers, which extend across the water surface and are secured by 
tracks, don’t entirely eliminate the risk of drowning. These fill with water 
when it rains, and children have been known to fall onto the cover and 
drown in the standing water.
Using a solar swimming pool heater
Certain energy expenditures, like driving, heating in the winter, lighting and so 
on, are just plain necessary (although you can still reduce them). Other energy 
expenditures — like heating a swimming pool — are entirely discretionary. 
Strictly speaking, you don’t need to heat your pool — at least not in the summer. 
You can even swim in the middle of winter without heat (talk about putting hair 
on your chest!).
If you want to become more energy efficient, not only to reduce your costs 
but also to reduce greenhouse gases, one of the best solutions is to use solar 
energy to heat your pool. It’s the only solution that is completely free of 
pollution. See Chapter 16 for details on solar swimming pool heaters.
There are other options for heating your pool, like natural gas heaters (these 
are common) or electric. But these are so expensive that they shouldn’t even 
be mentioned in a book on energy efficiency. You can save up-front money 
on an electric or gas heater, granted. But the steroid-bound utility bills they 
guarantee will quickly make your initial frugality seem foolish.
Getting into hot water with a spa
Spas are energy pigs, and you can’t do much about it. Old spas are far worse 
than the new versions, which have excellent insulation and good covers. If 
you’ve got an old redwood spa without a cover, throw it away now and buy 
a new spa. Other than that, here are some tips for making your current spa 
more efficient:
 
 Always use a cover. You can waste 80 percent of the heat without a 
cover. Covers are cheap if you buy an off-the-shelf size — you just have 
to tolerate a little slop over the edges.
 
 Insulate your spa. You can use a box of expandable foam insulation or 
you can stuff batt insulation into the crevices. Either one makes a big 
difference.
 
 You can often get old insulation for free. Contractors who remodel 
houses may let you scavenge their work sites to your heart’s content. 
Who cares if it’s cruddy old stuff? It’s going outdoors, and nobody’s 
going to see it anyway.

166
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
 
 Run your filter less. You can probably run your filter cycle less often 
than you think without sacrificing much quality. The vast majority of 
pool owners could halve their filter on time, without apparent loss of 
water quality. Give it a try. You may even be able to reduce it more.
 
 Turn it off when you’re away. When you’re on vacation, empty your spa 
and turn it off. If you time it right, you can make your vacation coincide 
with water-changing time.
 
 Turn the temperature down in the summer. Better yet, turn the heater 
off entirely.
Washing and Drying without the Crying
The average washing machine wastes more energy than any other appliance 
in the home. With due diligence, most households can save 50 percent on 
operating costs and use 50 percent less water (including hot water, which 
costs a lot more than cold) just by changing the way they do laundry. 
Following are some practical tips.
Running hot or cold: Changing 
water temperature
A great way to save energy doing laundry is to use hot water only when you 
need to. Eighty-five percent of the energy used in washing is consumed by 
heating the water. A lot of people simply run their machines on hot all the 
time. You can easily save 25 percent on your washing costs by using cold 
water most of the time — in particular, for the rinse cycle. Look on the label 
of your detergent for the best ways to use cold water. You can also effectively 
wash in cold water if you use detergent made for cold water. Check your 
detergent label to find its temperature requirement.
 
Another way to save energy is to make every member of the household 
responsible for cleaning his or her own clothes. You’ll see an instant decrease 
in wash-load quantity, especially if you have kids.
Adjusting load size, water level, and cycle
When you wash clothes, use as little water as necessary to get the job done. 
To that end, only wash full loads — it’s much more efficient, per item of 
clothing, than partial loads. Always adjust the water level to the lowest 
possible setting for the load size. For the smallest loads, use a mini-basket 
insert that fits over the agitator.

167
 Chapter 11: Pigging Out on Power with Appliances 
You can also take advantage of the cycles your washer offers. If yours has a 
pre-soak cycle, use it. Presoaking cycles save energy. They take more time, 
but so what? Some washers also let you choose the speed of the spin cycle. 
Faster spin speeds remove more water, resulting in less dryer time. If you’re 
using a clothesline, faster, longer spins make your life much easier because 
the clothes weigh less and pull the line down less.
Don’t use too much detergent. Contrary to what you may think, more is not 
necessarily better, especially if it doesn’t get completely rinsed out. The 
more detergent you use, the more you have to rinse.
Saving drying costs
Dryers use more power than every appliance save the washing machine and 
refrigerator. Saving money with your dryer is easy.
Avoiding the dryer altogether
The best way to save money on drying costs is to use a clothesline — you 
know, that thing in the backyard that your mother used when you were 
growing up so long ago. Clothes dried outdoors smell much better, particularly 
if they’re in direct sunlight.
The best clothesline style for most users is an “umbrella” arrangement (true 
to its name, it folds up like an umbrella). You mount it into the ground and it 
rotates, so you can set your laundry basket down and move the line around 
as you pin clothes up. It features the most length of line for the least amount 
of space, due to its spiraling structure. Retractable mechanisms are great. 
I have a clothesline on my back porch, and when it’s not in use, the line 
retracts so you can’t even see it.
To determine the best location for your clothesline, consider the following:
 
 Convenience counts. If getting to the clothesline is a hassle, you’ll be 
less apt to use it. Garages work well, and they’re usually right next to the 
laundry. Open the garage door if you can. Otherwise, your garage will 
get humid.
 
 Air movement is helpful. A breezy spot with direct sunshine is ideal.
 
Not convinced fresh air can freshen clothes? Try this experiment: Take some 
sweaty, smelly workout clothes and simply hang them up in direct sunshine. 
Check them out a couple hours later — they may feel and smell better than 
clothes you run through the washing machine.

Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
Another way to avoid using the dryer is to hang clothes to dry indoors. A 
quick, easy way to dry small loads is to simply hang them over your shower 
curtain rod while you’re at work. You need some ventilation in your bathroom 
or you’ll humidify your home, but maybe that’s what you want to do.
Timing is everything
If you time the use of your dryer just right, you can take the best possible 
advantage of the heat it puts out. Consider the following tips to decrease 
your drying costs:
 
 Over-drying is hard on clothes, and it wastes energy. Like pasta, clothes 
should be dried al dente (just enough).
 
 Moisture sensors are much better than timed drying cycles (using a 
timer makes no sense at all, if you think about it).
 
 Cool-down cycles are the most efficient because the dryer heater 
gradually shuts off and the residual heat finishes the cycle.
 
 Dry two or more loads in a row, thereby taking advantage of the dryer’s 
retained heat.
Taking care of your dryer’s ductwork
Dryers have vented pipes (around 4 inches in diameter) that lead outdoors. 
The purpose of these pipes is to vent the hot air to the outside environment 
(take that, Mother Nature!). To work most efficiently, this vent pipe needs to 
be free of obstruction.
 
 Clean the removable filter every time you use the dryer. Keep a small 
waste bin by the machine so you can toss the coagulated lint into it.
 
 Check your dryer ductwork. It may be clogged with years’ worth of 
accreted crud, which causes inefficiency. New ductwork is cheap. You 
can find it at any hardware store; ask the clerk for help.
 
 Where your ductwork ends outside you’ll find a vent, often with a 
flapping door that opens and closes when the dryer is on and off (to 
keep birds and rodents out of the line). These often get dented and 
smashed, thereby restricting flow and wasting money. If possible, just 
get rid of the vent. Or replace the one you have with a better-working 
model.
 
 You can buy a duct cleaner — a long, snaking wand with a big, bushy 
brush head that you cram down the duct line — but for the cost, you’re 
probably better off simply rebuilding the ductwork, assuming you have 
easy access. Many ducts are built into walls, in which case you’re stuck 
with cleaning.
 
 Use the straightest, shortest duct possible. Ninety-degree bends cause 
your dryer to work harder and longer to accomplish the same task. In 
fact, most ductwork can be rebuilt to good advantage.

 Chapter 11: Pigging Out on Power with Appliances 
Keeping Your Cool with Refrigerators
The number-one way to save money with your refrigerator is to keep the 
coils clean. On either the bottom or the back of your unit is a meandering line 
of narrow tubing. Air is drawn over this tubing, and, over time, dust accumu-
lates and clogs the flow, decreasing your refrigerator’s efficiency. You can get 
special brushes that enable you to brush the collected dust off the tubes, or 
you can simply use your vacuum cleaner.
Coils on the bottom of a refrigerator are harder to get to than those on the 
back, although for the latter, you have to move your refrigerator out. You’re 
likely to be shocked at how much dirt and crud accumulate behind your 
refrigerator. This stuff causes health problems.
If your refrigerator is 15 years old or more, buying a new one is undoubtedly 
cost-effective. Look for a top-bottom model rather than a side-by-side. The 
top-bottom refrigerator arrangements use around 10 percent less energy 
than their side-by-side counterparts. The payback on a new energy-efficient 
refrigerator is less than five years.
Beyond buying a new refrigerator, you can do other things to make the 
refrigerator you have run more efficiently. The following sections explain.
It’s what’s on the inside that counts
How you arrange your food, the temperature settings you select, and how 
much ice buildup you have in the freezer all contribute to how well or poorly 
your refrigerator works. Some advice:
 
 Check the temperature. If your refrigerator allows different tempera-
ture settings for different zones, adjust the temperatures accordingly. 
Recommended temperatures are 37–40°F for the refrigerator, and 5°F for 
the freezer. Long-term freezer storage (deep freezers) should be set at 0°F.
 
 Place a cheap thermometer in a glass of water in the center of the 
refrigerator. In the freezer, place the thermometer between a couple 
frozen packages. You can then check temperatures in different 
locations and see how they compare.
 
 Defrost the freezer. Ice buildup makes for inefficiency.
 
 Eliminate overcrowding. When the air inside a compartment can’t 
move, the machinery has to work harder.
 
 Cover all foods in the compartments. Uncovered foods release a lot of 
moisture and make the compressor work harder. Besides, if you don’t 
cover the food, it’ll taste weird.

170
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
Close the door!
Keep your refrigerator’s doors closed as much as possible — an obvious 
piece of advice, perhaps, but worth stating anyway. Of course, if you have 
kids like mine, this admonition goes in one ear and out the other.
 
Tight seals are a must. If they’re tattered and leaking, you’re wasting up to 25 
percent of the refrigerator’s energy (even more if your home is hot). If you 
can’t change the seal, use some silicon sealant instead (the same kind you buy 
for bathtubs and sinks works just fine). Follow these steps:
 
1. Spray Pam over the metal frame surface of the refrigerator where the 
seal should be located.
 
2. Squirt the silicon over the seal.
 
3. Close the door and let the material dry.
One or two?
Operating one large refrigerator is much more efficient than operating two 
smaller units. A lot of people have a refrigerator in their garage — usually the 
one that used to be in the kitchen. You may not want to throw it away, but old 
reefers cost a lot of money. That unit in your garage is costing you a lot more 
than the new one. Is it worth it? What do you have in there, anyway? Drinks for 
the kids? A whole pig? You can surely live without two refrigerators.
Lessening the Load on Your Dishwasher
Dishwashers use as much energy as clothes washers and dryers. Around 80 
percent of this energy is consumed by heating the water — which means that 
one way to maximize your energy efficiency is to reduce the amount of hot 
water your dishwasher uses. Another way to save energy is to modify the 
way you rinse your dishes and load the dishwasher. The following sections 
explain.
Using less hot water
New dishwashers heat their own water, which is far more efficient than drawing 
hot water from the water heater the way older models do. Keep this feature in 
mind if you’re in the market for a new dishwasher.

171
 Chapter 11: Pigging Out on Power with Appliances 
In addition, dishwashers get warm and heat your kitchen. In the winter, this 
is fine. In the summer, it makes your air conditioner work harder. During 
warm months, use the no-heat dry option. If your machine doesn’t have a 
no-heat option, simply stop it after the rinse cycle, open the door, and let the 
dishes dry that way.
 
In the summer, the dishwasher humidifies your house quite a bit. Get some 
ventilation going to get that humidity out of the house, and you’ll feel cooler.
 
The temperature of the water from your domestic heater may affect the quality 
of your dishwasher’s performance. If the water isn’t hot enough, your machine 
will have a hard time doing the job. However, some detergents are rated for a 
lower water temperature. (For more information on water heaters, refer to the 
earlier section “Keeping Water Heaters in Check.”)
Changing the way you rinse and load
The key here is to minimize how much water you use. Here are some suggestions 
to help you do that:
 
 Rinse dishes as little as possible. In fact, just scraping off large chunks 
of food without rinsing at all is often sufficient. Most dishwashers do a 
good job of getting rid of caked-on, hard stuff. New models have special 
cycles that steam-heat the crud and loosen it up.
 
 Always run a full load. Your dishwasher uses just as much water to 
wash a few dishes as a full load, so make the most of the water you use.
 
 Try skipping the pre-rinse cycle on your dishwasher and using the 
economy wash cycle. You probably won’t be able to tell the difference.
Washing dishes by hand?
Believe it or not, a detailed scientific study was 
performed to determine whether hand washing 
or machine washing dishes is more efficient. 
Hand washing a complete 12-piece setting of 
dishes in a sink used around 30 gallons of water 
and 2.5 kWh of electricity for water heating. An 
automatic dishwasher used only 4 gallons and 
1.5kWh of electricity. Not only that, but impartial 
judges determined the dishes from the machine 
were much cleaner. Hmm. Sounds like my kids 
were doing the hand washing.

172
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
Eating Up Power with Stoves 
and Microwaves
Depending on how much you cook in your home, energy costs for your stove 
and microwave can be significant. There are a number of easy things you can 
do to save costs, and in this section, I describe the best and easiest candidates.
Checking out efficient ovens
Some ovens (both microwave and conventional) are just plain more efficient 
than others. Some have features that offer extra efficiency, and some are 
more efficient even without the extra features.
 
 Self-cleaning ovens: These ovens are more efficient because they have 
higher insulation levels. What this means is that less heat is lost to the 
outside ambient while you’re cooking.
 
 Gas ovens with pilotless ignition: One of these ovens saves you 30 percent 
over its lifetime, and the air in your home will be cleaner. With pilot lights, 
some gas is always being burned (you can usually see the little blue flame 
wavering near the burner). With a pilotless gas stove, a spark plug type 
device ignites the gas each time the burner is turned on.
 
 Convection ovens: Convection ovens incorporate a small, high-temperature 
fan that moves the internal air in the oven compartment thereby bringing 
more heat into contact with the food being baked. Convection ovens are 
very efficient because they allow you to bake in less time, with less energy. 
Use your convection feature if you have one.
Altering your cooking techniques
You don’t have to use a conventional oven to cook a hot meal. Sometimes the 
following appliances can do the job more efficiently:
 
 Toaster ovens: Use a toaster oven for small jobs. Small toaster ovens 
(the kind that sit on your countertop) take much less energy than big 
conventional ovens. And if you know how to use them properly, you can 
get great browning effects. They don’t cost much, but you’re better off 
getting a good one with an automatic timer and temperature controls.

173
 Chapter 11: Pigging Out on Power with Appliances 
 
 Barbeque grills: Use your barbecue as much as possible in the summer. 
From an efficiency standpoint, gas models are the best. Charcoal grills 
waste a lot of energy (you can’t turn them off and on, as needed), plus 
they put out far more pollution. Small propane barbecues work very 
well and, contrary to what some people claim, they don’t make the food 
stink. Burning petro-based charcoal is no different than burning petro-
based natural gas.
 
 Crock pots and portable pressure cookers: In the summer, put them 
outdoors to save air-conditioning costs and lower humidity.
Even when nothing but a conventional oven will do, you can employ energy-
saving strategies like the following:
 
 Bake dishes simultaneously. Try to fill your oven with a number of dishes 
at the same time. This will lower the per-item cooking cost. If different 
items call for different temperatures, relax; there’s wiggle room. Put the 
items that need higher temperatures on the top rack, and items that need 
lower temperatures on the lower rack (that’s easy to remember).
 
 Don’t preheat. Let your food warm up with the oven. And turn your 
stove off a few minutes before the allotted cooking time — the residual 
heat will finish the process.
 
 Don’t lay foil on racks. Foil obstructs the natural flow of heat.
 
 Use glass or ceramic pans in the oven. The food cooks more efficiently, 
and the texture is better.
 
 Match the pan to the size of the heating element. This way, no heat 
escapes around the edges.
 
 Contain heat in the summer. Putting a lid on that boiling pot reduces 
the amount of heat and humidity that’s released into the air. Rinse pans 
out as soon as practical to cool them down.
 
 Release heat in the winter. In cold weather, let hot pots and pans 
release their heat into your home. Don’t rinse them out because that 
washes the heat right down the drain.
Enjoying the Fine Life with 
TVs and Computers
Although the new flat-screen televisions reduce power consumption, the 
trend toward gigantic screens drives consumption right back up. Combine 
a big screen with a big sound system, and your entertainment center may 
be costing you an arm and a leg. Computers and their various components 
and accessories constitute a similar category of common household energy-
eaters. What’s a modern man to do?

174
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
For starters, be aware that “off” doesn’t always mean what it implies. Even 
when your TV, entertainment system, computer, monitor, DVD player, and so 
on are sitting idle, they’re still drawing power. (Check out the earlier sidebar 
“Making time stand still” to see this for yourself.) You can put a halt to this 
energy drain by plugging these appliances into a power strip and turning the 
power strip off when you’re not using them.
In the same vein, always use the power down feature on your computer, and 
turn your computer off at night and on weekends. Remember, even in the 
sleep mode, power is being wasted. Don’t forget to turn your printer off when 
it’s not in use, too.
Some processors use a lot more juice than others. Do you really need all that 
speed and power? Probably not, although computers have now taken over 
the role that big muscle cars used to play for macho hard guys. Laptop com-
puters use a lot less power than desktops, so if you can, opt for a laptop.
Old CRT monitors draw considerably more power than the new, flat-screen ver-
sions. They also put out a lot of extra heat, requiring more air conditioning in 
the summer. So you may want to update (unless, of course, you’re looking for 
heat in your home office, in which case you may want to keep your old CRT).
Buying New Appliances
Most of the time you don’t have a choice over whether to buy a new appliance. 
The old one breaks, it can’t be repaired, and you come to the difficult conclusion 
that it’s time for a funeral. Many people also decide that upgrading to a more 
energy-efficient model is worth the investment.
Fortunately, the government has made your decision process easy for you 
with the Energy Star program (yes, a government program that actually 
works the way it’s supposed to — take advantage of this rare opportunity!). 
The Energy Star is only awarded to appliances that significantly exceed the 
minimum national efficiency standards, typically by 20 percent, and by as 
much as 110 percent. Energy Star ratings apply to all major appliances, plus 
HVAC systems, natural gas and oil systems, programmable thermostats, 
and so on. Even windows are certified with Energy Star. You can easily find 
the Energy Star Label on those products to which the standard applies (see 
Figure 11-1).

The Energy Star label shows the product’s annual power consumption. Even 
better, note the annual cost estimates based on different utility rates. On 
these labels, the highest rate is 12 cents, which is somewhat anachronistic in 
light of rising energy rates. But multiplying the costs based on your own rates 
is easy enough. For instance, if you’re paying 16 cents, simply multiply the 
result based on 8 cents by two.
You can easily compare different models of appliances using the Energy Star 
labels. Simply compare the estimated annual costs. You can then compare 
the difference in price with the difference in costs.
 
If you want to buy an energy-efficient appliance, buy one with an Energy Star 
certification; it’s that simple. You can get super-duper-efficient models, but 
they tend to cost a lot more than they’re worth. These are generally for the 
off-grid crowd or those willing to pay any price to go green. For the most part, 
if you buy an Energy Star model and use it efficiently, you’re doing very well.
Now if only the government would come out with an income tax form that 
made as much sense as Energy Star. . . .
Playing it safe with combustion appliances
Nearly a third of water heaters and stoves (and 
many refrigerators) use natural gas. These units 
require a few extra precautions that are worth 
noting:
  All combustion equipment should be 
installed and maintained by knowledge-
able personnel. Electrical equipment 
is inherently safer, and, as a result, it’s 
cheaper because you can do most of the 
maintenance yourself. With combustion 
equipment, you assume some extra risks.
  Install a carbon monoxide detector near the 
equipment.
  Make sure your smoke detectors are working 
correctly.
  Yellow flames always indicate that the gas 
is being burned inefficiently, which causes 
soot buildup, as well as wasted money. 
If you see yellow flames, get a service 
technician to tune up your system.
  Combustion equipment always requires 
appropriate ventilation (the reasons are 
too complex for the scope of this book, but 
trust me on this one). Read the instruction 
manuals, and make sure that a qualified 
service person not only installs the equip-
ment, but also maintains it. If in doubt, opt 
for the service call — your family’s life may 
be on the line.

S
unshine is free (at least until the government comes up with a way to tax 
it). And sunshine is natural and amiable, so it should be used as much as 
possible. In fact, most people do use sunshine, but not nearly as effectively 
as they could.
Using sunshine effectively isn’t as simple as just letting the sun shine in. 
Obviously, in the winter, you want both the sunshine and its heat in your 
home as much as possible. In the summer, you want the sun’s light but not 
the heat — two goals that are almost always at odds.
In this chapter, I show you how to heat your home in the winter and avoid 
doing so in the summer. I show you how to light your home with sunshine, 
and how to plan and build sunrooms that increase the value of your home 
and provide increased living area at an efficient cost. (For much greater 
detail on this subject, check out Solar Power Your Home For Dummies, also 
authored by yours truly and published by Wiley.)
Lighting Your Home with Sunshine
The more you use sunshine to light your home, the less you need to rely on 
artificial lighting. Using sunshine to your advantage also creates a kinder, 
more inviting atmosphere. The following sections outline a variety of ways 
to manipulate sunlight and reap all the benefits it has to offer. (For details 
on how to deal with the heat factor, head to the later section “Heating Your 
Home with Sunlight — Or Not.”)

178
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
Planting a tree
By far the best way to control sunlight in your home is to strategically locate 
deciduous trees (those that lose their leaves in the winter) around your 
home’s exterior. If you plant a single deciduous tree outside a southern-
exposed window, particularly a large window, you benefit in many ways.
In the summer, the leaves block most of the sunlight, leaving the room with 
diffused, subtle, cool light. On a hot summer day, harsh sunlight makes you 
feel even hotter, but shade creates a sense of calm and well-being, not to 
mention relief. In the winter, with the leaves gone, direct sunlight enters the 
room, casting the interior with warmth (due to the greenhouse effect), as well 
as a bright, yellow tint that feels warm.
Making natural light more effective
You can make the most of whatever natural light is available to you. Here 
are a number of clever ways to increase the effectiveness of sunlight in your 
home’s interior spaces.
Putting up mirrors to enhance existing light
Position your mirrors in corners to broadcast light around the entire room. 
In essence, mirrors magnify light. Two mirrors positioned catty-corner on 
opposing walls work even better and make the room seem much larger.
 
Before you nail a mirror up permanently, try it out at different times of the day 
to gauge its effect. If you want more effect in the morning than the evening, put 
the mirror on an eastern-facing wall. Also keep in mind that mirrored closet 
doors often work wonders to light a bedroom and increase its perceived size.
Using glass bricks to let light in
Cut some high holes through the solid walls of a dark hallway (it doesn’t 
matter whether the walls lead to other rooms or outdoors) and put glass 
bricks into the spaces so that light enters the hallway. Doing so not only 
spreads light but also makes the hallway seem larger and less restrictive. 
In fact, your entire home will feel friendlier and more open. Installing glass 
bricks is a relatively straightforward and inexpensive do-it-yourself project 
(ask for more details at your hardware store).
Using windowed doors
Instead of the usual solid wood doors, install French doors between rooms. 
You can get French doors from most any building supply stores. Even if you 
use curtains for privacy, the light will still shine through, and your home will 
seem more spacious. You’re likely to find one location in your home that’s a 
perfect candidate for a French door.

179
 Chapter 12: Controlling Solar Exposures in Your Home
Don’t forget the front door. Glass panels can lighten up your entryway, and 
guests will find them more inviting than a solid, impersonal mass of heavy 
wood staring them in the face. Then again, maybe you don’t want to 
encourage guests.
Getting rid of overgrowth
If vegetation is crowding the light through one of your windows, cut it back. 
This is especially important with windows facing east, because morning 
sunlight works much better than coffee, and it’s not a laxative.
Cleaning or tinting your windows
Spotless windows make a huge difference in the way a room feels. Cleaning 
may not matter much in terms of the quantity of light coming in, but it 
definitely enhances the quality, which may be even more important.
If your problem is that a room gets too much sunshine (or you want to 
obscure a view to the outside without using blinds), apply window tinting. 
Tinting comes in sheet tape form, and anybody can put it up (well, pretty 
much anybody — it helps if you don’t have ten thumbs).
Decorating to make the 
most of natural light
Decorating a room with light-colored carpeting and walls makes it seem like 
there’s a lot more sunshine. Placing the right kinds of trinkets in the right 
spots can also make a difference. Here are a few tips:
 
 Hang stained-glass window decorations to create a splashy mood. The 
decorations dominate the room when the sun shines in directly, adding 
color, verve, and even some dynamics for a very low cost. You can also 
use sparkling crystals and ceramic art pieces for the same effect. Sunny 
breakfast nooks are ideal for spectral trinkets.
 
 Whitewash dark trim molding. This simple trick makes a big difference. 
Even in a room painted all white, dark molding can dominate.
 
 Mount glass shelves on sunny windows and fill them with knick-
knacks. This has the subtle effect of making the room seem much 
lighter. Glass shelves in a window can also block an undesirable view so 
you don’t have to close the blinds. Your eye stops at the glass shelves 
instead of the view beyond.

Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
Installing skylights and solar tubes
For those of you with more advanced ambitions, skylights and solar tubes 
can make a big difference in your home’s lighting for a relatively small 
investment.
Traditional skylights are big, expansive channelers of sunlight, and the large 
openings in your home’s ceiling will make a room bigger and airier, both 
literally and figuratively. If you’re interested in skylights, consult with a 
contractor unless you’re really good with tools and projects. You can find 
remodel books that detail the tasks, as well as the parts, tools, and skills 
required.
 
Skylights are very expensive to install. If you want multiple skylights, consider 
doing them all at the same time. Installing three or four skylights at one time 
takes around twice as much time and money (rather than three or four times 
as much) — food for thought when you’re deciding how many skylights to 
install.
Solar light tubes, also known as tubular skylights, are a less expensive 
alternative. These let in natural light that varies with the clouds and the 
weather. Solar tubes, which can be installed by just about anybody in half 
a day for around $250, can have just as much effect as a traditional skylight 
for around one tenth of the cost. (The typical price, uninstalled, is $200 for a 
four-foot-long pipe. Extensions cost an additional $20 per foot.)
Here’s how a solar light tube system works: Sunlight is collected up on the 
roof and transmitted down a shiny, silver pipe into a diffuser, which 
broadcasts the light into the room below (see Figure 12-1).

 Chapter 12: Controlling Solar Exposures in Your Home
If you’re interested in solar tubes, keep these points in mind:
 
 You can make most rooms bright enough to work in during daylight 
hours, even in the winter. Large-diameter units (12 inches and more) 
can output as much light as a dozen 100-watt light bulbs, at one tenth 
the heat. Because they don’t produce as much heat you can use your 
air-conditioner much less.
 
 One of the best locations for a solar tube is a dark corner in the family 
room, where the light will be well-used and have a dramatic effect. Solar 
light tubes are also good for dark, isolated bathrooms. The natural light 
is comforting, and you never have to flip a light switch during the day. 
If you have a dark kitchen, a solar tube may be the perfect solution, 
especially if a lot of people come and go during the day. The light switch 
won’t be constantly flipped off and on.
 
 The intensity of light changes quite a bit because solar light varies 
with the clouds and weather. On a partly cloudy day, you can get a lot 
of fluctuation as clouds move across the sun, making you much more 
conscious of the outdoors.
 
 The tubes themselves can drastically change the way decor looks. Be 
prepared for a drastically different room because lighting is very 
influential in terms of how a room “feels.” (I installed one in a bathroom 
and had to start a big remodel the next week because the change in tone 
simply made the old paint and tile colors look old and drab — okay, I 
didn’t really have to, but my wife made me and she wears the pants.) 
Also, the silver color imparts a certain “cool” mood. Some types of solar 
light tubes come with filters for creating moods, but the filters cut out 
light as well.
 
 Installation isn’t easy (you have to go up into your attic space), but it’s 
doable. When deciding where to install solar light tubes, always keep 
the installation itself in mind. Just forget about installing these tubes in 
locations where you can’t easily go: like shallow attic spaces or near the 
edges of the attic. If you plan to install solar tubes yourself, heed this 
advice:
 
• Don’t try to buy separate parts. Get a complete kit, with however 
many extension tubes you think you need. Get an extra extension, 
and leave it in the box for return if you don’t use it.
 
• The hardest part of the job is working in the attic space. Plan your 
route up and over to where the work is going to be done, and 
figure out how you’ll sit and stand once you get there. Also 
determine what tools you’ll need.
 
• Cutting through a typical roof takes more than a toy saw. 
Composite shingles eat jigsaw blades, so get extras. And take 
precautions to seal against the weather on the rooftop. Solar 
tubes come with detailed instructions for sealing; follow these 
instructions carefully or you’ll be sorry. If there’s any possible 
way for water to get in, it will.

Heating Your Home with 
Sunlight — or Not
In addition to being a great light source, sunlight is a great source of heat — 
which is wonderful when you want heat, but not so wonderful when you want 
to stay cool. Fortunately, you can regulate how much heat the sun generates 
in your home.
First, you need to understand the greenhouse effect. The best way to 
describe how sunshine heats a home is to explain how a greenhouse works. 
Sunlight enters the enclosed space through the glazing, or window material, 
and then gets absorbed and turned into heat. The heat stays in the enclosed 
space thanks to the glazing’s insulation properties (see Figure 12-2).

You can enhance the greenhouse effect — and make your home warmer — by 
increasing the transmissibility of the window and maximizing its insulation. 
Double-pane glass works well for this, and a number of window coatings and 
other optical tricks can also be used to good effect. Inexpensive plastic 
materials that work well are available, although they tend to blur the view.
To maximize the heat generated, the space must be well-sealed to prevent 
air leakage, although the greenhouse effect is often powerful enough to work 
well even in relatively leaky environments. In fact, sometimes it works so well 
that the heat is intolerable. (The greenhouse effect explains why your car 
gets so hot when it sits out in the summer sunshine.)

183
 Chapter 12: Controlling Solar Exposures in Your Home
So how do you reduce the greenhouse effect when you don’t want all that 
heat? Easy. By controlling the amount of sunshine that enters your home.
Installing blinds and sunscreens
When you install blinds or shades, you control the amount of sunlight that enters 
your home. An added benefit is that these things can also increase the beauty of 
your home and, if you’re really smart (of course you are — you’re reading this 
book), you can use blinds and shades to insulate, or maintain heat storage, as well.
Bare glass lets the sun enter freely. Using blinds or sunshades (and even 
curtains) restricts the amount of sunlight that enters and, depending on how 
they’re hung (whether on the inside or outside of the window, and how far 
from the window), affects the insulation properties, as Table 12-1 outlines. 
You can see your hanging options in Figure 12-3.

Hanging blinds: Inside or out?
When you hang blinds on the inside of windows, the sunshine comes in 
through the window, strikes the blind, and gets converted into heat. The heat 
is trapped in the air gap between the blind and the window and can get very 
hot because of the greenhouse effect. Of course, heat is only desirable in 
the winter. In the summer, you may have a cooler room if you just leave the 
window uncovered and let the sun and air in.
 
 To warm a room in winter: Contrary to what you may think, the best 
way to heat a room with sunshine in the winter is not to open the blinds, 
but to use special blinds that capture sunlight and insulate at the same 
time. You can get interior blinds made to do just that.
 
 To keep a room cool in summer: Interior blinds made for summer 
reflect a lot of light back out the window. They are usually shiny and 
white, at least on the exterior-facing surface.

185
 Chapter 12: Controlling Solar Exposures in Your Home
 
To get the best cooling effect, allow for some ventilation between an 
outside blind and the open window it covers. If you can’t do that, use 
an outside blind that has a shiny, metallic exterior surface that simply 
reflects all sunlight and doesn’t let any heat into the room at all. The 
room will be completely dark, but this is desirable on a burning hot day.
 
 To maximize the efficiency of an air conditioner: When your air 
conditioner is on, it’s best to hang blinds so that they create as much 
insulation as possible and banish sunlight. You can achieve this by 
closing your interior blinds all the way. If you have outside shades, 
all the better. The best scheme for a sunny home that uses a lot of air 
conditioning is both solar screens (see the next section, “Putting up 
sunscreens”) and interior blinds. The home will be very dark, but it 
will also be much cooler.
Putting up sunscreens
Sunscreens, also called solar screens, are an inexpensive and effective way to 
cool your home in the summer. They reflect a lot of sunlight — up to 90 
percent — plus they create an insulation barrier on the outside. Most are 
dark, heavy-duty, fabric screens with a tacky surface. Some are a flexible, 
tinted plastic film. You can get sunscreens up to 8 feet wide, with unlimited 
length.
 
Only windows that get more than a few hours of direct sunlight a day are 
worth sun screening. The best candidates are tall windows facing south, but 
east and west exposures can also get very hot. With a solar screen tacked up 
on the outside of a window, most of the sunlight is reflected before it even 
gets to the window. The screen gets hot and an insulation barrier keeps that 
heat trapped, but it’s all outside the window.
Infrared filtering glass
You can get special glass that filters infra-
red light out before it gets into your home. In 
fact, most of the sunlight’s heat comes from 
light that is invisible to the human eye. Some 
animals can see infrared light (like owls and 
nocturnal hunters) but humans can’t see 
it. Infrared filtering glass rejects up to 70 
percent of the heat of sunlight, yet you can’t tell 
the difference in the view because it transmits 
visible light as well as a conventional window. 
Solar screens and other sunlight-inhibiting 
processes inhibit the view, and you may not 
want this if your window is a centerpiece to a 
home that features lavish views.
You’ll pay more for infrared glass, but it may be 
just the thing.

186
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
You don’t want sunscreens in the winter, which means you need to mount 
them in such a way that you can bring them down in the winter. Your 
options:
 
 Use removable frames: You can buy frames for sun screens. Most are 
aluminum. You can get them either preloaded with screens, or you can 
load them yourself. They come in a range of colors.
 
 Tack them up. The fastest and cheapest way to cover a window is to 
tack the screen right onto the window frame. You don’t need anything 
more than tacks, a hammer or a stapler, and scissors or a box cutter. 
Just cut the screen down to a few inches bigger than what you need, 
tack it up, and then trim it with scissors or a box cutter. In the winter, 
just pull the screen down.
 
 Roll them up like blinds. You can get automatic, electric controllers 
so that, with the push of a single button, you can command every solar 
screen in your home.
Sunscreens are easy to put up, and most people can do it themselves. Call a 
screen shop direct for tools, materials, and installation advice. Easy-to-use 
mounting hardware is essential. (For automatic sunscreens, you’ll need a 
professional installation.)
 
Before you go the do-it-yourself route, ask the shop what they would charge to 
install sunscreens for you. They can do a window in a few minutes, and their 
bid for the entire job may not be much more than what you’ll pay for the 
material alone.
You can expect at least a three-year lifetime with quality sunscreen, at 
around 75 cents per square foot. For a 3-foot × 6-foot window, if a screen 
lasts five years, the cost is only $2 per year (with the cheapest installation 
method). If your climate is hot and sunny, there’s no question you’ll get good 
payback on this small investment. Cheap screen bleaches out and looks 
perpetually dirty — avoid it unless you like cheap and perpetually dirty.
Covering your windows 
with exterior awnings
Awnings are great light shades because you can configure them in different 
geometrical relationships and control the light over the course of a day. They 
also drastically change the appearance of your home for the better. They add 
shape and break up monotonous flat surfaces, and complement the color 
scheme of your home’s exterior. Two common awning styles are the Venetian 
awning and the hood awning (see Figure 12-4):

187
 Chapter 12: Controlling Solar Exposures in Your Home
 
 Venetian awnings allow sunlight in the winter, when the sun is low 
in the sky, and block sunlight in the summer, when the sun is high. 
Venetians also allow you to see out of the top of your window, and the 
effect is much more open than that of hood awnings.
 
 Hood awnings are more decorative. They can be made of nice fabrics 
that match or complement the house. They work better in rainy climates 
because they keep cold water off your windows. (You can lose a lot of 
heat by water-based convection from rain.)
 
Figure 12-4:

and hood 
awnings.

Do-it-yourselfers can build very nice-looking wood slat awnings that can be 
attached to most surfaces. You can buy designs over the Internet, but designing 
them yourself is even more fun. You can paint them to match your house, and 
you can use materials that last a long time. You can even devise an adjustment 
scheme that allows you to raise or lower the pitch, depending on conditions.

188
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
Installing outdoor window blinds
Outdoor blinds, which are designed to cover windows from the outside, stop 
the heat on the outside of the home. Plus in the winter, these blinds can act 
as insulators. Outdoor blinds are usually made of vinyl. Some are prettier 
than others, which may or may not matter to you. Import shops stock 
different sizes of roll-up bamboo shades, often priced as low as $5 apiece. 
You’ll probably have to throw these cheapies out after a single season, but so 
what — they’re cheapies.
These blinds are also commonly used overhead for patios and porches 
where late afternoon and evening sunlight can prevent you from using the 
area. In this case, leave them up all day or your floor will heat up (concrete 
or tile floors hold heat for a long time).
Most outdoor blinds have cords that you pull different ways, but if you don’t 
want to raise and lower the blinds manually, you can find outdoor blinds that 
retract automatically. Automatic retractable shades are available from 
specialty suppliers. You can even find solar-powered retractors that work 
with a hand-held remote controller.
Putting up radiant barriers
A radiant barrier is a sheet of thin material that looks like reinforced 
aluminum foil. It’s tacked up beneath your roof joists or simply laid over 
the insulation on your attic floor. It keeps a lot of heat out of your home, 
but it doesn’t prevent your attic from getting warm in the winter (in the 
wintertime, heat rises from your home, and it’s composed mostly of 
convective heat so radiant barriers don’t have any affect at all).
The material itself costs around 20 cents per square foot. For a 2,000-square-
foot house, the material costs $400, and the payback can be very impressive. 
In hot climates, radiant barriers cool the home down more than enough to 
pay for themselves in less than a couple years.
To install a radiant barrier, you simply staple it into place, regardless of whether 
you mount it overhead or lay it on the floor. (Make sure you have a good quality 
stapler.) The design of your roof impacts how easy installation will be. Open 
rafters are the best candidates; if you have complex trusses, forget it. Installation 
is also a snap if your attic floor is open and easily accessible.
 
Even if you can only cover a portion of the rafters or floor, it’s worth it. Try to 
cover an entire small area, rather than isolated spots in a number of different 
areas.

189
 Chapter 12: Controlling Solar Exposures in Your Home
 
Attics can roast you fast. They’ll heat to over 130°F, easy. Don’t kid yourself; 
if it feels real hot, it can be dangerous. One way to stay safe is to work in the 
morning, when things are cooler.
Cutting out summertime 
sunlight with overhangs
Overhangs, which are solid constructions built over windows, can provide 
both financial gain and aesthetic beauty. You can design an overhang to 
visually complement your home’s roofline.
Here’s how overhangs work (see Figure 12-5): In the winter, sunlight can 
enter the home because the sun is lower in the sky. If you have high thermal 
mass floors (like concrete or tile), your home will heat up nicely. In the 
summertime, when the sun is higher in the sky, the overhang stops any 
direct sunlight from entering the home.

Be sure the overhang you install changes your home’s appearance for the 
better (the best looking overhangs mimic the pitch of your roof and use the 
same materials). Before you nail an overhang up and make it permanent, try to 
arrange it where it’s going to go and see what it looks like. Alternatively, take a 
digital photo of the window and use a computer program to play around with 
different ideas. You can find overhang designs in home plan books.
Garnering Sunlight with Greenhouses 
and Sunrooms
There are two types of solar rooms: greenhouses and sunrooms. Green-
houses, which are either connected to your home or separate from it, can 
help warm your home as well as provide inexpensive, delicious, highly nutri-
tious food or beautiful and soothing decorative plants. Sunrooms, which are 
always part of your home, add living space and square footage for a 
relatively low cost, increase the efficiency of your heating and cooling efforts, 
and brighten up your home’s ambience and decor.
A well-designed solar room can provide up to 60 percent of a home’s heating 
in the winter, depending on the amount of sunlight available. Even in very 
cold climates, a solar room can work efficiently. And particularly in a cold 
climate, a sunroom can provide needed relief from the gray doldrums of 
winter.
Most home additions cost more than your property value increases due 
to the improvement. But with solar rooms, the variety of designs and the 
reduced building restrictions make it possible to enjoy profitable 
appreciations, especially if you do it yourself.
Deciding between the different 
types of solar rooms
So which type of solar room is better: greenhouse or sunroom? That depends 
on what you want to achieve and which type of room you prefer.
Greenhouses invite the maximum amount of sunlight and generally require 
a glass ceiling or sloping glass walls. They are also very functional. They 
need a water supply, their temperatures need to be regulated (the difference 
between the hottest and coldest temperatures needs to be kept to a mini-
mum, as dictated by the type of plants), they need adequate ventilation to 
provide oxygen for the plants, and they need floors that can withstand water 
leaks and mud spillage.

191
 Chapter 12: Controlling Solar Exposures in Your Home
Sunrooms, on the other hand, are designed as extensions of your home’s 
living space. You can leave them partially open to the outdoors, or you can 
completely enclose them and put in carpeting and fine furniture. Because too 
much sunlight is uncomfortable and sunrooms are meant to be inviting, they 
generally have water-tight, solid roofs. They may or may not contain 
skylights and vents, but both increase the livability factor.
In both types of solar rooms, most of the southern wall space is taken up by 
windows or some other suitable glazing material. In addition, both green-
houses and sunrooms can increase a home’s privacy by providing a buffer 
between the outside world and the interior spaces.
Building a solar room yourself
A do-it-yourselfer can design and build a sunroom or greenhouse at a 
relatively low cost with relatively low risk. These rooms can be separate from 
the house and, as such, don’t need electrical wiring or plumbing and don’t 
require that you obey all the building code requirements that are unavoidable 
inside of a home.
 
If you don’t want to have to apply for building permits or have the property 
value reappraised (with the commensurate increase in property taxes), build 
the sunroom against a house, but don’t actually nail the frame elements to the 
home — in this case, it’s just a free-standing porch. (Keep in mind, though, 
that if you ever sell your house, you can’t advertise your solar room as part of 
your house’s square footage.)
If you plan to add a solar room to your home, kits are the best bets for do-it-
yourselfers. (Greenhouse kits made of plastic sheets instead of windows are 
easy, cheap, and effective.) Fortunately, an entire industry is dedicated to 
manufacturing and selling prefab kits that cost anywhere from a few hundred 
dollars to hundreds of thousands of dollars. You can see samples in show-
rooms. It’s always best to touch things before you buy; photos are often 
misleading and rarely reflect reality the way you expect them to.
Alternatively you can build your own custom design and use the same 
materials (windows, framing, trim) as the rest of your house. If you have a 
good imagination, you can find very cheap materials, particularly glass 
windows and heavy beams. As much as a well-designed solar room can 
enhance your home’s aesthetics, a poorly designed one can make your house 
look awkward and uninviting. The following sections offer some practical tips 
for creating a solar room you can be proud of and happy with.

192
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
 
 Make very good drawings done to scale before you begin building (use 
gridded paper and let one square foot equal one grid). Consider all the 
angles and, if you can, draw some perspectives (from the street, for 
instance). The more thought you give to the room’s appearance before 
you start, the better the odds that your solar room will increase the 
value of your home.
 
 In cold climates, use between 0.65 and 1.5 square feet of double-pane 
glass for each square foot of building floor area. In temperate climates, 
use between 0.3 to 0.9 square feet for each square foot of building floor 
area. Even if you can’t achieve these ratios, any amount of glass will 
work to your advantage. Solar rooms are usually compromises between 
the best physics and the best aesthetics and cost. In general, aesthetics 
should win for sunrooms, while physics should win for greenhouses.
 
 Always build your sunroom on a southern front. Put the absorbers and 
thermal mass on the north side. Otherwise, your room won’t work to 
maximum advantage. Also, try to use as many of your home’s existing 
walls as possible, preferably on both the east and west ends of the 
sunroom. These walls are already insulated, and they match the house.
 
 The best location in your house is adjacent to the kitchen for attached 
greenhouses, and adjacent to the living room or family room for solar 
rooms. These locations afford not only the most efficient use, but also 
the most use in general. Leaving the doors and windows open between 
your house and sunroom lends a sense of increased floor space and size 
to your home. (Building a solar room off your family room is the 
cheapest way to increase the square footage of your home.)
 
 Plant deciduous trees at the same time you build of your solar room. 
They’ll cut back the sun in the summer and allow it all in during the 
winter. Plus, the room will be much prettier with a view of some nice 
trees. Partnering with Mother Nature brings a benign continuity to the 
entire project.
 
 Use the same materials that your home is made of, if you can. Otherwise, 
don’t try to match at all — just do something that’s complementary but 
totally disparate. Nothing mismatches more than an attempt at matching 
that doesn’t quite cut it. For example, blue and orange match up much 
better than orange and a slightly different shade of orange, which just 
ends up looking cheap and classless.
 
Easy and straightforward candidates for solar rooms are existing porches and 
decks that already have the basic support structures and flooring in place. All 
you need to do is build up and around them.

 Cleaning up the air you breathe
U
nless you live in a perfect climate where it’s never too hot or too cold, 
heating and air conditioning make up the largest component of your 
power bill. If you rely solely on your heater and your air conditioner to keep 
you comfortable, then you’re missing a big opportunity for energy efficiency. 
The key to comfort is air movement. By moving air appropriately through 
your home, you can achieve a much higher level of comfort and save money 
by using your HVAC system less, particularly in the summer. This chapter 
tells you how.
Taking Advantage of Natural 
Air Movement
A small amount of air movement increases convective cooling quite a bit, 
which is why people like fans blowing when it’s hot in the summer. A fan can 
make a room feel 5°F cooler, even though the temperature has not changed. 
In the winter, winds make air seem much colder, an effect known as the wind 
chill factor. People seek breezes in the summer and avoid it in the winter, 
not because air movement changes the actual temperature, but because it 
increases the rate of convective cooling. (Refer to Chapter 7 for a discussion 
on how convection heating and cooling works.) That’s why ventilation is so 
important to your comfort.

194
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
Each house has a natural ventilation scheme, which is influenced by the 
following factors:
 
 The prevailing winds, as determined by the weather patterns in the 
climate in which you live
 
 The chimney effect, which dictates that hot air naturally rises while 
cool air settles
 
 The vent patterns of your home, as determined by the location of 
windows, doors, vents, and other openings in your home
Methods of heating and cooling that take advantage of these factors to 
increase energy efficiency are known as passive methods. The most efficient 
ways to move air always complement the natural ventilation scheme rather 
than work against it. By understanding your house’s ventilation scheme, 
you can exploit the prevailing winds and the chimney effect and optimize air 
movement through your home’s vents. You can passively cool your house 
well enough to avoid using your air conditioner on all but the hottest days.
Which way is the wind blowing?
Prevailing winds are the winds that are most common in your area. Wind has 
both a speed and a direction, and both are important. Some areas have very 
consistent prevailing winds, while other areas experience changes almost 
daily. You probably already have a good idea what the prevailing winds are 
where you live, but you can refine your understanding by paying more 
attention. In particular, how do the winds change over the course of a day? 
Over the seasons? (Typically, prevailing winds come from the southwest in 
the summer, and the northwest in the winter.)
Prevailing winds dictate the arrangement of fans and window openings that 
will work best in your house. Basically, you want to create a situation in 
which you take most advantage of natural air movement as possible because 
this comes entirely free of charge.
Figure 13-1 shows a typical situation. If all four windows are closed, there’s 
no breeze in the house. If only one of the windows is opened, there’s very 
little air movement in the house because air can neither enter nor leave. If 
only windows 2 and 4 are opened, there is very little air movement because 
the two open windows are at the same air pressure; the movement of the 

195
 Chapter 13: Breathing Homes: Ventilation, Fans, and Air Filters
breeze is precisely the same at each window. However, if windows 1 and 3 
are both open, a good breeze moves through the house, entering window 1 
and exiting window 3. If all four windows are open, you’ll get much the same 
breeze as you do when only 1 and 3 are open.

Prevailing Wind
You can use a fan to work with or against the prevailing winds, as Figure 
13-2 shows. A window fan aiming into the house at window 3 works directly 
against the natural ventilation scheme, and you may end up with no air 
movement at all. But aim the fan out at window 3, and you enhance the 
natural scheme. The same results can be achieved by mounting a fan in 
window 1 and aiming it either inward or outward. If you set a fan in the 
middle of the room with windows 1 and 3 open and with the fan facing 
window 3, you enhance the natural scheme somewhat, but you can enhance 
it even more by placing the fan right in the window.
 
The environment outside of the windows can affect the temperature of the air. 
If a particular window has a nice big tree overhead and lawn beneath it, the 
air being drawn into the house through that window will be cooler than that 
which comes through a window situated over concrete in the direct sunshine. 
In Figure 13-2, for example, a big tree over window 1 would have a cooling 
impact on the breeze entering the house.

Up, up, and away: Chimney effect
The chimney effect accounts for the way hot air rises. In a closed room, the 
temperature at the ceiling is always higher than that on the floor. The 
differential in air temperature between the two areas can be over 15°F. You 
can achieve cooling, without any prevailing breezes at all, by arranging vents 
in your house to take advantage of the chimney effect (see Figure 13-3).

197
 Chapter 13: Breathing Homes: Ventilation, Fans, and Air Filters
Many different types of vents are used in houses, as shown in Figure 13-4. 
Your home may or may not have these types of vents, but you can probably 
add them if you see the need:
 
 Ridge vent: Ridge vents work very well to ventilate your attic space 
because they make maximum use of the chimney effect while also 
exploiting prevailing winds. If you’re in a hot climate, these types of 
vents are very efficient.
 
 Roof vent: Whether roof vents are efficient or not depends entirely on 
where you locate them on your roof. In general, you want to place a roof 
vent on the downwind side of your home’s roof, as near the apex as 
possible to exploit the chimney effect. These vents are easy to install 
(ask a clerk at a large hardware store or building supply store about 
your options), but you do need to rain-proof them.
 
 Gable vent: Gable vents are simple to install. You can mount a big fan 
inside the gable vent and push a lot of air (make sure to work in 
conjunction with the natural air ventilation scheme, not against it). 
These vents are usually much better than roof vents when it comes to 
keeping rain out of your attic space. Plus you don’t need to leak seal 
them with anywhere near the same integrity as a roof vent.
 
 Soffit vent: These vents are common in almost all residential 
constructions. The best way to ventilate your attic space using only 
passive (non-powered) means is with a number of soffit vents with a few 
strategically placed roof vents (or a ridge vent). Soffit vents don’t need 
to be waterproofed because rain doesn’t get to them.
 
 Whole house vent (with fan): These are the best way to ventilate a 
house, providing the HVAC system isn’t on. Not only do you ventilate 
your entire home, but you also ventilate your attic space with a whole 
house vent. They make a lot of noise, but for the energy dollar you easily 
get the most bang for the buck. If you’re reasonably skilled with tools 
and projects, you can install one yourself (aside from electrical 
connections, which may need to be done by a licensed contractor).
 
 Kitchen and bathroom exhaust vents: These vents get rid of humidity 
right at the worst sources in your home. In the summer, when you’re 
cooking, always use a kitchen exhaust fan with a nearby window opened 
(even if you’re running an air conditioner). If you take a shower in the 
summer, always use a bathroom exhaust fan to get rid of the humidity; 
otherwise, you’ll feel hotter and run your air conditioner more.

Getting Mother Nature on your side
Here are some tips on how to open and close your doors and windows in 
order to optimize the use of breezes to cool your home:
 
 Leave interior doors open whenever possible. This allows for better 
air circulation in your home. Even if you don’t end up increasing air 
circulation, you still benefit because closed-off rooms are much more 
prone to wet spots and microorganism breeding.
 
 Whenever possible, open your windows. Surprisingly, many people 
simply don’t think to open their windows. If you have multiple stories, 
opening windows on different floors can increase the flow of breezes. 
Experiment to see what works best. Unfortunately, what works best for 
one wind direction won’t necessarily work for a different direction. But 
most locales have prevailing winds that don’t often deviate.
 
 When you want breezes through your home, open windows and doors 
only on the windward and leeward sides of the house, and try to balance 
the openings. Don’t just open every window you can. Experiment a little.
 
 Add screen doors whenever possible. Then open your doors, just like 
your windows.
 
 Whenever you remodel, add some ventilation ports. Remove interior 
walls whenever possible. Add skylights. Provide adequate clearance 
beneath doors so that air can move out of a room.
 
To gain the most advantage in moving air, you need to manage solar radiation 
entry into your home by using blinds and window coverings in conjunction 
with opening and closing windows. Chapter 12 addresses sunscreens, window 
blinds, awnings, and other shading methods.
Getting the Air Moving with Fans
Most homes don’t do a great job when it comes to ventilation. Most people 
simply open windows and aim fans without rhyme or reason. A better idea 
is to strategically place fans so that you achieve the desired effect in both 
summer and winter. Some fans are better than others. What you want is to 
achieve the highest efficiency at the lowest cost (including both operating 
and equipment costs).
Unfortunately, achieving optimal ventilation year-round is a little tricky because 
requirements in winter are usually diametrically opposed to those in the summer. 
In the winter, you want to invite heat in and retain it as much as possible, whereas 
in the summer you seek to banish heat. Most homes are designed to optimize one 
season only, which creates problems in the other seasons.

200
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
A wide range of methods are available for moving air. Passive methods, such 
as exploiting prevailing winds and the chimney effect to cool your home, 
are the subject of the earlier section, “Taking Advantage of Natural Air 
Movement.” In this section, I look at active methods, including ceiling fans, 
whole-house fans, and more. The next section, “I Need to Vent! Moving Air in 
Your Attic,” delves into how improving ventilation in your attic can improve 
air movement throughout your house.
 
If you operate a fan without sufficient outside ventilation, you may draw 
combustion products, like smoke and carbon monoxide, into the living space 
of your home. Gas heaters and water heaters put out carbon monoxide. 
Always pay attention to where that gas is going. You may want to invest in a 
carbon monoxide alarm.
Fan efficiency and operation
The efficiency of a fan is determined by calculating the amount of air it moves 
divided by the power it consumes. Fans are rated for how much air they can 
move in a given amount of time. The most common spec is cubic feet per 
minute (cf/min). To find the proper size fan, calculate how many cubic feet 
are in the area you want to cool (just multiply length × width × height), be it 
your entire house, a room or the attic. Then buy a fan that’s about 20 percent 
bigger than your calculations suggest.
To maximize a fan’s efficiency, you must set it up properly. Consider the 
following:
 
 The air route: You need to consider the entirety of the airflow path, and 
make it as straight and clear as possible. Long, meandering hallways 
impede air flow much more than it may seem. Other efficiency-busters 
include the following: aiming a fan directly at a wall, setting a fan near a 
window that is only cracked open, and aiming a fan through a grate that 
is coated with dust (but I didn’t really need to tell you that, right?)
 
 A cowling: The most efficient movement of air occurs when a fan has 
a cowling because a cowling, the metal ring around the outer diameter 
of the fan blades, directs airflow (see Figure 13-5). If all you’re after is 
some air movement in a closed room, a cowling isn’t so important. But 
if you’re interested in moving a large quantity of air through your house, 
it’s very important. Most heavy-duty work fans come with cowlings.
 
All fans are heaters. They dissipate power, which is given off as heat. If you 
put a fan in a closed room, the air temperature rises — it’s a fact of physics. 
The room may feel cooler because of convective cooling, but the temperature 
goes up nevertheless. Fans used solely to stir air for convective cooling should 
never be turned on when no humans are present. Leaving an oscillating fan on 
all day long while you’re at work only heats your house.

Thermostats are switches that open or close at a set temperature. They come 
in handy when you set up a fan in a remote location, such as an attic. When 
the attic reaches a certain temperature, the fan activates. When it’s hot in the 
summer, you get ventilation. In the winter, the fan doesn’t turn on.

202
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
Choosing the right kind of fan
A wide range of fans are available at a wide range of prices. Choosing the right 
unit for your needs will ensure you get the proper effect you’re looking for.
The most effective fans in your entire house are your bathroom and kitchen 
vent fans. They remove tons of humidity, if used properly. Use them when-
ever you’re cooking or taking a shower in the summer. Crack open a small 
window nearby and the fans will be very efficient, even if you’re running an 
air conditioner. (Humidity in the summer is a back-breaker. It causes you to 
turn the air conditioner on, and when that doesn’t feel like it’s working, you 
run it even more. See Chapter 8 for details.) Following are the most common 
types of household fans.
Box fans
Box fans are portable units you can move around as needed. Most have some 
kind of cowling. Blade design also determines efficiency of air flow. You can 
find fans that are impressively efficient, but keep in mind that paying extra 
for a good fan may not be as worthwhile as simply using a smaller, cheaper 
fan the right way in the first place.
 
The noise a fan makes is an important consideration. Cheap fans are loud and 
clunky. Good ones make a smooth, even sound that may even be pleasing. The 
larger the blades (not power, blade size) the slower the blades can move to 
produce the same amount of air. If you have room, a large, lower-powered fan 
is better than a small brutish one.
Window fans
Window fans come with a sheet metal mounting arrangement that fits right 
into an open window and seals around the edges (a perfect cowling). Most of 
these are very efficient.
 
The best way to move air in your house is by using a good window fan 
mounted into the most appropriate window, probably upstairs on the down-
wind side of your house (aim the fan out the window). One small window fan 
mounted properly can do the same work as a number of large fans scattered 
about the house.
Exhaust fans
Exhaust fans in bathrooms and kitchens are important, but to ensure 
efficiency you need to make sure you use them correctly. If you turn on a 
bathroom fan without a bathroom window open, the exhausted air will be 
drawn from the house, and outside air will be drawn into the house through 
whatever openings are available (leaks in the insulation, open windows, and 
so on). Also, you shouldn’t use exhaust fans when the HVAC system is 
running, but if you do, open a small window nearby to control air movement.

203
 Chapter 13: Breathing Homes: Ventilation, Fans, and Air Filters
Oscillating fans
Oscillating fans move back and forth and are used for convective cooling 
only, a job they don’t do very well. To get the most convective cooling for the 
least cost, get a small, stationary fan and aim it directly onto your uncovered 
body. Position it close, so you get the most benefit from the air movement. 
A big oscillating fan on the other side of the room is inefficient and may even 
make things worse by stirring up hot air near the ceiling.
Ceiling fans
Ceiling fans can accomplish two things: convective cooling and reversing or 
enhancing the chimney effect (see Figure 13-6). They may or may not bring 
outside air into the house, depending on how your vents are set up.

204
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
Ceiling fans work best when the fan blades are 7 to 9 feet above the floor 
and 10 to 12 inches below the ceiling. You may need several in a large room. 
Aesthetics are likely to dictate the size you choose, but keep in mind that the 
bigger blades are quieter because they move more slowly and achieve the 
same airflow. The maxim “You get what you pay for” is especially true for 
ceiling fans. Cheap ones make noise, are inefficient, and don’t last long because 
they have shoddy bearings. In other words, cheap ceiling fans are very 
expensive, particularly if you factor in the time and effort it takes to install one.
Whole-house fans
Whole-house fans are mounted in the ceiling between a high point in your 
house and the attic. They draw air through open windows, exhaust it up 
through the roof, and cool the attic space at the same time. Whole-house fans 
are never run with the HVAC on at the same time, and they’re rarely run in 
the wintertime. But in the summer, when the outside air temperature cools 
down at night, a whole-house fan works better than any other air movement 
scheme. With a whole-house fan, you can open any window in the house and 
get air movement in that room. Before you run out and buy one, here are a 
few tidbits to consider:
 
 In the winter, you need to cover a whole-house fan with some kind of 
insulation or you’ll lose a lot of heat up into the attic. Some house fans 
come with metal vents that automatically open or close when the fan is 
on or off, but the insulation properties of these are very poor, and they 
generally leak a lot as well. You can buy covers over the Internet, or 
you can make a very effective cover yourself. (Cover your fan from the 
attic side rather than the house side, where aesthetics are important.) 
Alternatively, unplug your whole-house fan in the off season and simply 
cover the whole unit (on top) with a thick, old blanket from a thrift 
store.
 
 In the summer, turn the fan on when the sun goes down and leave it 
on all night. When the sun comes up, turn the fan off and close all the 
windows and drapes in the house to keep as much heat out as possible. 
Rule of thumb: Use a whole-house fan only when the outside air is below 
85°F.
 
 Whole-house fans make a lot of noise because they’re big and powerful; 
because they’re mounted in a central location, you can hear the noise 
throughout the house. To reduce the noise, mount your whole-house fan 
on rubber gaskets noise. They also bring in a lot of dust and humidity.
 
 If your attic is not vented well, a whole house fan will move very little air 
for the amount of power it consumes. Go up into your attic and check 
to make sure there are plenty of vents. If not, either make some or don’t 
use a whole-house fan because it won’t be worth it.

205
 Chapter 13: Breathing Homes: Ventilation, Fans, and Air Filters
I Need to Vent! Moving Air in Your Attic
Attics can get to be over 160°F in the hot summer sun. This heat migrates 
down through your ceiling into your house. Even in the middle of the night, a 
poorly ventilated attic stays very hot. If you can somehow manage to 
continuously purge the air in your attic with outside air, your entire house 
will be much cooler. This is especially true of old houses with poor 
insulation. The following sections give you ways to move air out of your attic. 
(You can also purge the hot air out the attic with a whole-house fan; see the 
preceding section for details.)
Adding attic vents for greater comfort
Attics need to breathe properly. They’re usually built with vent systems 
either right through the roof or up in the walls below the eaves. When 
working properly, these vents let the hot air inside your attic escape. The 
most efficient of the attic vents is the rooftop vent (refer to Figure 13-4). It 
can be located right at the apex of the roof where the most heat collects due 
to the chimney effect. Unfortunately, attic vents can get completely clogged 
with dust. Dirty vents cause your attic to get much hotter in the summer. The 
solution? Clean them out periodically.
If you only have a few vents and they’re in spots that don’t enhance prevailing 
winds or the chimney effect, putting in a few more vents may be the answer. 
Most houses, in fact, could use a vent or two near the top of the roof to 
enhance the chimney effect. You can get inexpensive ones from most hard-
ware stores, and they’re relatively easy to install.
 
Consider what the vents will look like from the street. You may want to locate 
roof vents so they won’t be visible from the street level.
Using attic vent fans
Attic vent fans move air in your attic space only (as opposed to a whole house 
fan, which moves air through both your home’s interior and the attic). You can 
install an attic vent fan in a roof vent and move air through that vent. Or you can 
install one in a gable vent, which is the most common configuration. Many attic 
vent fans are activated via a thermostat switch. When the attic gets hot enough, 
the fan comes on. In addition, most attic vent fans are covered up in the winter 
to prevent natural ventilation and keep heat trapped in the attic space.
Installing an attic vent fan can be very expensive because you have to hire an 
electrician to provide the requisite 120VAC power to the fan’s location and 
install a switch where it can be easily accessed. Additionally, accessing the attic 

206
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
space where the fan should be installed may be very difficult. Most electricians 
are not monkeys, so you’ll pay if your attic space is a tough nut to crack.
A solar attic vent fan, on the other hand, can be installed anywhere and 
requires no county permits or electrician labor. The fan will run whenever 
the sun shines on the PV modules; this makes perfect sense because you 
want the most air pumping when the sun is the brightest.
To determine where to put an attic vent fan if you decide you need one, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Figure out your attic’s natural ventilation scheme.
 
 Go up into your attic. Make a rough drawing of the attic’s layout, 
including all vents and openings designed for ventilation vents.
 
2. Pick the best location for the fan.
 
 In keeping with the rule to always enhance the natural ventilation 
scheme, the most logical spot to put a vent fan is in the roof, with a 
cowling around the fan. Also, always try to locate a fan downwind in 
order to equalize ventilation throughout the attic.
 
3. Select the type of fan and size for your application.
 
 Attic vent fans come in two forms, one-piece units and distributed units, 
as described in the following sections.
One-piece unit
A one-piece unit (see Figure 13-7) costs around $270. Installation is very 
simple; you don’t even need to go into the attic space. Simply cut a round 
hole in your roof, pull the shingles back, slide the unit up under the shingles 
and drop it into the hole. Seal for weatherproofing and you’re done.

The unit will only come on when the set temperature is reached. However, in the 
winter, air will escape through the unit and cool the attic space. It’s best to cover 
the unit with a plastic tarp or something similar over the course of the winter.

207
 Chapter 13: Breathing Homes: Ventilation, Fans, and Air Filters
A potential problem: The solar modules are fixed in place on the unit, and it 
may be that the best location for your vent fan is not the best location for 
collecting sunlight (if your solar modules aren’t getting good sun, the fan 
won’t pump good air quantities). In this case, you need to go with a 
distributed system.
A distributed unit
Buying separate components for a distributed unit, as shown in Figure 13-8, 
costs much less than a one-piece unit — you can buy a separate 12VDC fan 
powerful enough to do the job for around $100, and a PV module to run it for 
another $130 — but the installation is more expensive and difficult. You will 
need a hood of some kind over the fan to prevent rain from getting into the 
attic or soaking the fan itself. You could potentially install the fan on a 
horizontal surface, behind a grate, and avoid a lot of installation problems, 
like cutting through a roof (which always entails the risk of leaks).

You can get better performance by tilting the modules to the west, because 
you want the most air movement in the afternoon. Tilt the modules to peak at 
around 2 p.m.
Strategizing Your Ventilation Plan
When opening windows, directing and installing fans, and installing or opening and 
closing vents, always work with the natural ventilation scheme, never against it. 
For instance, if you install a whole-house fan in the attic (refer to Figure 13-4), you 
need to direct the air up into the attic, never back into the house.

208
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
Making the plan
To determine the best way to direct air through your house, follow these steps:
 
1. Draw a rough floor plan of your house.
 
 Be sure to include all the windows, doors, sunlights, vents, fans, and so 
forth. Draw your attic, with all the vents and openings.
 
2. Figure out what the natural ventilation scheme is for both inside the 
house and the attic.
 
 Use what you know about prevailing winds in your area and the 
chimney effect. See the earlier section “Taking Advantage of Natural Air 
Movement” for details.
 
3. On paper, note different combinations of doors, windows, and vents. 
Determine how best to complement the natural ventilation to achieve 
comfort without the use of active devices.
 
 As you devise your plan, keep these tips in mind (see the earlier 
section “Getting Mother Nature on your side” for more advice on how to 
enhance airflow):
 
• Use smaller openings for the inlets and larger openings for the 
outlets; this increases the speed of the breezes.
 
• Make the air move over as long a path as possible. Windows a few 
feet apart don’t do much, nor does opening all the windows at the 
same time.
 
• Air from cooler outside areas is best, but may not be practical due 
to prevailing winds. Try to get air intake on the north side of your 
home. If possible, get air intake from a shaded area — under a tree, 
for instance.
 
• Not all windows should be opened or closed concurrently; 
determining the best strategy ultimately boils down to trial and 
error.
 
• Determine a daily routine. What works best in the morning is rarely 
what works best in the afternoon or at night.
 
4. Add fans to your plan to forcibly move air.
 
 Imagine where one single fan would work the best, in conjunction with 
windows and doors. How big does that one fan need to be? One small 
fan in the right location can easily produce more comfort than a huge 
fan in the wrong spot.
 
5. Put your plan into action.

209
 Chapter 13: Breathing Homes: Ventilation, Fans, and Air Filters
Accommodating seasonal variations
What works in the summer for cooling is almost always diametrically 
opposed to what works in the winter for warming. In the summer you want 
your attic vented as much as possible. But in the winter, you want your attic 
to retain as much heat as possible. Some means of opening or closing vents is 
needed to optimize for both seasons.
For instance, you may have a roof vent for purging hot air in the summer. But 
in the winter, you’ll want to cover this vent up. Using a heavy plastic garbage 
bag with duct tape works well, but the neighbors may start a petition, so use 
your common sense.
 
Look into installing a thermofor. A thermofor is a compact, mechanical, heat-
activated device that opens windows, skylights, greenhouse vents, and so on 
at a certain temperature, adjustable by the user. No electricity or power is 
required, so it can be mounted anywhere. Multiple units can be configured 
to open heavy windows and vents. These are very handy for attic vents and 
windows where one single opening makes a big difference in the entire house. 
And you don’t have to make special arrangements for winter versus summer 
because it’s all automatic.
Venting in summer
In the summer, without the AC on, windows and vents can be opened and 
closed at will. You want maximum, cool breeze through the house, hopefully 
from a window that’s under a big tree so that the air is cooler. You also want to 
maximize the breeze in your attic, which is usually accomplished by locating a 
vent at the highest point in the attic (to capitalize on the chimney effect).
In the summer, when the AC is on, you must close all windows. The best bet 
is to close all window coverings as well, to increase insulation and prevent 
solar heat from entering the house. But you also want to consider how heat 
will move in your house when the air conditioner is on. If you can arrange a 
fan to blow air over your body while the AC is on, you can turn the temperature 
of the AC down and get the same comfort effect, so small fans are always a 
good idea in an air-conditioned house.
Holding heat in during winter
In the winter, close all windows. Prevailing wind is not a factor inside the 
home, although it still is in the attic. You want to direct the heat to where you 
live in the house the most, probably the kitchen and family room. You also 
want to close off the attic space in order to retain heat up there.

210
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
Improving the Quality of 
Your Home’s Air
Getting the air going in the right direction isn’t the only goal. You also want 
to make sure that the air your family breathes is clean and healthy. For the 
most part, Mother Nature will take care of the details for you. But in some 
rare cases, you may need to filter your air. You need to understand exactly 
what you’re trying to accomplish in order to filter your air efficiently.
See Chapter 6 on indoor pollution sources. Many of these relate to air quality. If 
your family is having health issues, you may find the culprit and a solution there.
Air filters
The notion that the way to clean indoor air is to close windows and use an 
air filter is wholly mistaken. Once again, Mother Nature is far wiser than man 
and his meager inventions. The best way to condition your home’s air is to 
keep a fresh supply of outside air moving through. But if you can’t open your 
windows, or if it’s simply too cold or too hot for good ventilation, an air filter 
is the only solution.
Active air filters work on much the same principle as water filters: they filter 
the air as it comes into your home. They are also very specific to the type of 
substances that you need to filter. For instance, if you need to eliminate 
pollens, you use a filter specifically designed to filter pollen. If you need to 
eliminate cigarette smoke, there are filters made for this specific purpose.
Evaporative coolers
In the western United States where humidity 
levels are low, evaporative coolers offer very 
economical performance. They use around 
one-fourth the energy of a conventional air-
conditioning unit, and don’t require toxic chlo-
rofluorocarbons (CFCs) or other refrigerants. 
They cool air by drawing warm outside air over 
a wet filter pad (they need a source of water). 
The water evaporates from the pad to reduce 
the air’s temperature. A fan circulates the 
moist, cool air into the room and pushes warm 
air out through open windows. Portable room-
sized units start at $100.
Perhaps the best bet is to buy a PV-powered 
unit that operates only when the sun is hottest in 
the sky. These don’t cost a dime of utility power 
(nor emit an ounce of pollution), and they’re 
easy to connect because you don’t need to tap 
into your home’s electrical system. They work 
hardest when you need them to work hardest 
(there’s a certain poetic justice in this).

211
 Chapter 13: Breathing Homes: Ventilation, Fans, and Air Filters
Filtering through the options
There are three types of active filters in use:
 
 Mechanical filtration methods use filters and move air by means of 
fans. Very simple. Filters can be made of anything from paper to tightly-
packed fibers. You can put different types of filters on your HVAC input 
port.
 
 Electrostatic precipitation transfer filters (whew) impart an electrical 
charge to particles in the air. The air then passes over an electrically-
charged plate that works somewhat like a magnet to pull pollution from 
the air. Hmm. Sounds good, but unfortunately it doesn’t work as well as 
it sounds. At the risk of sounding politically incorrect, the problem here 
is discrimination. Some particles simply don’t want to be charged up.
 
 Negative ion generators form a high voltage field across air, thereby 
ionizing it (I could write an entire book on this, but let’s just leave it at 
that). Charged particles then attract airborne particulates. In theory this 
sounds viable because of all the big words, but in practice, these 
generators don’t work very well, so don’t waste your money unless you 
like science fiction movies an awful lot. Negative Ion Generators Run 
Amok!
Consumer Reports (a very reliable information source in print and online at 
www.consumerreports.org) recommends mechanical filtration with HEPA 
(high efficiency particle arresting) filters. No, these don’t pull particles over, 
read them their rights, and then haul them off to jail. They punch them in the 
gut and leave them to rot.
 
Pollen, which causes hay fever, is the most common airborne irritant. 
Unfortunately, active air filters do very little to prevent pollen in a home (not-
withstanding the elaborate claims you hear on infomercials). So don’t waste 
your money on filters for pollen. Take hay fever medicine instead.
A word about size
In general, the larger devices are more effective because they move more air 
and have larger filter surfaces. If air doesn’t enter the filter, it isn’t filtered.
Puny little things like ionizers and plug-in style electric devices should be left 
on the store shelves where they will do just as much good, without 
consuming energy in the process. And those little devices sold in grocery 
stores called air fresheners? They do just the opposite; they load your air 
with synthesized chemicals that make your air smell a certain way.
Getting the most from your air filter
If you find yourself in the market for an air filter, keep these tips in mind:

212
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home 
 
 Get a filter that’s quiet. No matter how good it may be, if it sounds like a 
garbage truck coming up the street, it won’t get turned on.
 
 You absolutely have to change filters, and they generally aren’t cheap. 
Old filters may even make your air worse because they can serve as 
breeding grounds for all kinds of insidious microbes. Imagine what an air 
filter is holding after it has been on for awhile — it catches everything 
in a room’s air. Not only does it capture microbes, but it also captures 
microbe food.
 
 Air filters are often hard to find. Look for them at a surgical supply 
house or medical supply store.
 
 If your doctor prescribes a filter for you, you may be able to get your 
insurance company to pony up. Good luck with that.
Natural ways to improve air quality
You can do a number of things to keep the air in your home clean. Most of 
them don’t require much, if any, effort at all.
Grow houseplants
Houseplants are by far and away the best way to filter indoor air. Spider 
plants, for example, love to gobble up carbon monoxide and dioxide, and 
they’re easy to grow. In fact, they’re so prolific you’ll have a thousand little 
baby spider plants in no time, whether you like it or not. And elephant ears 
and heartleaf philodendrons absorb formaldehyde, benzene, and carbon 
monoxide. Not only can some types of plants reduce certain forms of 
airborne contaminants, but they can also convert carbon dioxide back into 
oxygen.
 
Be aware, however, that poorly maintained plants can provide excellent 
breeding grounds for bugs and nasty little critters so small you can’t even see 
them. If you want plants, be prepared to take care of them.
Change vacuum cleaner bags
Change your vacuum bags often; old ones leak, making a real mess of your 
air. You may be sucking up crap from the floor, but a leaky or full bag just 
redistributes it around your home. The best vacuum is a whole-house unit 
where the filter is located in your garage. Keep in mind, though, that these 
things are energy pigs, so you need to decide which goal — energy efficiency 
or clean air — is more important to you.

 Using less of everything
 Reusing materials and containers
 Recycling when all else fails
R
eusing and recycling may not be strictly cost effective because both 
require extra labor and time on your part, and you don’t often get 
anything in return aside from the knowledge that you’ve helped the environ-
ment. Nevertheless, recycling makes sense for our society as a whole, and 
that should be enough motivation.
For the most part, your recycling regimen will be dictated by what’s available 
in your community. Some cities have no recycling at all. Some have extensive 
programs that include free containers (often these are different colors for 
different materials, like cans, bottles, newspapers, and so on.) You’ll need to 
do some research to find out what kind of recycling your utility system offers.
But regardless of your community’s standards, you can make an impact on 
your own, and that’s what I get into in this chapter.
Keeping a Record of What 
You Throw Away
If you haven’t already done it, the best way to begin your endeavor is to keep 
a detailed record of exactly what you throw away. You don’t need to do this 
for more than a week or two, because it’s not the details that you’re inter-
ested in as much as a general idea of how much, and what, you throw away. 
Most people are surprised and somewhat dismayed at the results.

Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home
Get a few sheets of paper or a binder, and keep records in the following 
categories:
 
 Aluminum cans
 
 Glass bottles
 
 Plastic bottles
 
 Food and scraps
 
 Mail
 
 Newspapers
 
 Grocery bags and other store bags
 
 Plastic bags and wrapping materials
 
 Everything else, including the kitchen sink
You don’t need to weigh these items, and you don’t need to be precise in 
terms of quantities. The point is to simply pay critical attention to what 
you’re tossing out. You want the big picture, not the details of each paint 
color.
After you’re done, consider how much of this stuff you really needed to 
throw out. How much could have been reused or recycled? Even more to the 
point, why did you buy it in the first place? Do you like garbage?
As you put together your waste-reduction game plan, remember that the 
most effective solution is three-fold. You want to tackle things in this order:
 
 Reduce the amount of “future” trash you bring in or buy.
 
 Reuse as much as you possibly can.
 
 Recycle whatever is left over.
The following sections examine each of these strategies in more detail.
Using Less of Everything
When you’re trying to cut down on waste, the first order of business is simply 
to use less of everything from the get-go. If you don’t buy those popular kids’ 
lunches of prepackaged crackers-bologna-cheese-and-snack, for example, 
you won’t have all that packaging to throw away. The most important way to 
decrease the amount of trash you throw away is not to bring it into your home 
in the first place. You can decrease the amount of trash you generate by

215
 Chapter 14: Reusing and Recycling: Play It Again, Sam
 
 Being aware of the packaging of the things you buy. Less is more.
 
 Stopping trash — read, junk mail — from finding you.
 
 Opting for non-paper items when possible
The following sections offer some practical tips on how to use less of every-
thing around your home.
 
When you recycle and reuse, you’ve already conceded. After all, you have 
trash you have to get rid of. When you don’t use at all, you’ve won the game.
Avoiding over-packaged products
We live in a world where packaging is, unfortunately, largely dictated by a need 
to prevent shoplifting. How exasperating when it takes five minutes to remove 
a simple little gadget from layers and layers of protective wear. You can insist 
on buying products that are minimally packaged. If enough people did that, 
market forces would work to convince manufacturers to hold things down.
You can also buy in bulk, and bring your own packaging materials with you. 
When you go to the grocery store, take along the bags that you took home 
last time. When you buy vegetables, get them from roadside stands and use 
your own bags, or don’t use any bag at all.
Eliminating junk mail
If you’re like most people, nearly every day you receive junk mail: solicita-
tions and flyers for products and services you have no interest in. You toss 
them into the trash immediately after opening them, if you open them at all. If 
you want to minimize the junk mail you get, you can stop it by writing a letter 
to the following address, stating that you don’t want to receive any junk mail:
Mail Preference Service
Direct Marketing Association
P.O. Box 643
Carmel, NY 10512
212-768-7277
Or, for a few bucks, you can take care of the matter online at www.the-dma.org.
This service is similar to the “Don’t call” registry that prevents phone solici-
tors from bothering you at home, only it affects junk mailers. After you con-
tact the registry, your mailbox will be much lonelier, and you’ll be tossing out 
a lot less junk.

216
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home
Here are other ways to reduce the amount of junk mail you receive:
 
 Don’t list your address in the telephone book. A lot of junk mailers get 
their data from this source.
 
 Don’t deal with book, DVD, CD, or similar clubs. They send way too 
much junk mail. If you find a particular mailer loading you down, write to 
them and tell them to stop.
Trimming the paper mountain
Junk mail, discussed in the preceding section, is only a part (albeit a large one) 
of the paper problem most people have. Newspapers, bills, grocery bags — 
you can reduce the amount of trash by cutting down on these things, too.
 
 Read the newspaper online. All you have to do is look at how much 
newspaper you discard each week to see how much paper waste you 
can eliminate simply by adapting this habit.
 
 If you need a paper version of your newspaper (I admit it: I don’t want to 
read my newspaper online; I want to spread it out over the kitchen table 
in the morning and sip a cup of coffee while I wince at all the bad news), 
then share it with a like-minded neighbor or two. Whoever gets it last 
tosses it into the recycle bin.
 
 Pay your bills online. If your bills still come in the regular mail, pay 
online to save envelopes and stamps. Even better, request that your 
bills be sent to you online. Many companies offer this service, and it 
eliminates the paper waste entirely.
 
 Use only one credit card instead of many. You’ll save paper (think of all 
the bills and offers you can avoid), and you’ll also keep yourself out of 
trouble.
Bugzooka
To set the tone for this section and demonstrate 
how to think outside of the box, here’s a curve-
ball for you. The Bugzooka is a humane way to 
get rid of pesky bugs in your home. It looks and 
sounds like a kid’s toy, but it’s very efficient, and 
fun to boot. You push a big plunger into a plastic 
tube and a spring is activated. You aim the end 
of the plastic tube near an insect, and when 
you pull the trigger, the offending pest is gently 
sucked (well, okay — I wouldn’t want to be 
sucked into a plastic chamber like this, but I’m 
not a bug) into an enclosed chamber. You can 
study his feelers and thousand little eyes once 
he’s in there, although you probably won’t want 
to. Then you free the lucky little bugger outside 
where he can mingle and breed with like kind. 
Let this be a metaphor. (Get a Bugzooka from 
www.realgoods.com).

217
 Chapter 14: Reusing and Recycling: Play It Again, Sam
 
 Use fabric grocery bags and bring them with you to the store. No more 
tossed out grocery bags. Look for them at www.realgoods.com, or 
many grocery stores now sell them at the checkout lanes.
 
 If you do need to use the bags from the grocery store, ask for paper, 
because plastic bags take a hundred years to degrade in a landfill. Some 
communities are banning plastic bags outright for this reason.
 
 Use a digital camera, store your photos on disk, and view them online. 
Save the prints for those that you want to display or put in a scrapbook. 
(The photo process uses a lot of chemicals, not to mention paper.)
 
 Don’t use disposable diapers. The number of diapers in landfills is truly 
amazing. Buy cloth. You can clean and reuse them yourself (parents 
have been doing it for thousands of years), or you can hire a service 
that will come to your home to pick up “used” diapers and drop off 
fresh ones. Either option is cheaper than buying disposables; both 
are also a lot better for the environment. (And, yes, it’s also a lot ickier, 
but take my word for it: Things are going to get a lot worse when the 
kids hit 13.)
 
 Use cloth towels instead of paper ones and durable plastic containers 
instead of plastic wrap, aluminum foil, or other disposable sealants. A 
lot of trash comes from meal prep and storage.
Reusing Saves More Energy 
than Recycling
Okay, you can’t always avoid using something in the first place, so the next 
best thing is to reuse whatever you can. If you can’t reuse it, making it avail-
able to others is just as good. The following sections list some helpful guide-
lines on how to extend the usefulness of items.
Making use of old stuff
Who says something has to be new to be good or useful? A lot of items can be 
reused, either for the same purpose for which they were originally intended 
or a slightly (or drastically) different purpose. Here are some examples:
 
 Glass jars: The glass jars you get food in can be reused to store other 
foods in place of plastic containers. You don’t throw the jars away, and 
you don’t have to buy containers at all; it’s a twofer deal. Make sure to 
save the lids.

218
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home
 
 Packing pellets: You know those really irritating little peanut-shaped pack-
ing pellets that you get whenever the UPS truck comes by? Store them 
somewhere, and then when you send a package, reuse them. They don’t 
weigh much, but they last a million years in a landfill. Whoever invented 
these things should have to eat some for lunch.
 
 Paint: Nobody ever uses all the paint for a project. When you have four 
or five odd gallon containers that are half full, mix them together and 
use the result to paint closets, garages, basements, barns, kids’ rooms, 
and so forth. Paint is a real landfill nightmare, so why not use it up this 
way instead? Think of it as an adventure.
 
 Old towels: Cut old bath towels into smaller towels for use with messes 
in the kitchen and elsewhere. These are good for lots of cleaning tasks 
and dirty jobs: polishing shoes, drying off pets, washing cars, and so on. 
You can do the same with old T-shirts and old cloth diapers, too.
 
 Table scraps: By composting the food you didn’t eat, you eliminate the 
need for fertilizers and expensive soil treatments, and you save a lot 
of unnecessary landfill. You can buy composters which work very well 
and make the job clean. Or you can compost in a hole in your backyard, 
which is the best way to go for sheer quality. Dig a hole, and toss your 
food scraps into the hole (avoid fats, but most everything else is fine). 
Get some slack lime and toss in a cup once in awhile. Stir occasionally. 
Within a couple months, you’ll have good, loamy potting soil for your 
landscaping needs.
Finally, one incredibly cost-effective way to reuse most anything is to 
“borrow” it from your neighbors. This is best done at night, and you should 
probably wear a mask or something in case they wake up and catch you in 
the act. Run away, but don’t let them see you going back into your own home.
Composting toilets — for the die-hard composter
Composting toilets don’t flush. They use a 
process called “rapid aerobic decomposi-
tion.” They feature a “holding” tank where the 
wastes go to decompose. Around 95 percent of 
the “material” that goes into a compost toilet 
ends up venting out as water vapor or gases. 
That’s good to know, isn’t it? But relax; these 
toilets don’t smell, or they shouldn’t if they’re 
working right.
After the process is complete, you’re left with 
a dry, fluffy, odorless material in the “finishing 
drawer.” You can put this stuff on your fruit trees 
or ornamental plants (to be perfectly honest, if I 
found out somebody was using this on their fruit 
trees, I would politely refuse a dinner invitation, 
but that’s just me).
If you’re in an apartment, forget it. If you’re 
squeamish, forget it. In fact, you must be a dedi-
cated advocate of the green philosophy or you 
can just forget it. For some reason, once I have 
produced “waste products,” I wish for them 
to exit the premises as quickly as possible. I’m 
sure I’m not alone in this irrational phobia.

219
 Chapter 14: Reusing and Recycling: Play It Again, Sam
Buying used
You can find a lot of good deals — and a few steals — by shopping for used 
goods. Consider these things:
 
 Clothing: Buy your clothes used. You can find a lot of new clothes in 
used clothing stores. Many people buy clothes that they fully intend to 
wear, but never do. Eventually these clothes find their way to a charity 
because the owners simply can’t throw away new clothing. And even 
if the clothes have been worn a few times, so what? In the same vein, 
donate your obsolete clothes to charities or sell them to resale stores so 
that somebody else can benefit.
 
 Building materials: You can reuse a lot of old building materials. Look 
at places like demolition sites and old dumps. Ask a remodeler for bath-
tubs, sinks, and such. Some contractors are delighted to have you come 
and haul this stuff away for them. I once found a guy who was about to 
pay $500 dollars to have a big, demolished redwood porch hauled away. 
I took $200, and for the next couple years, I had more wood to build out-
buildings than I knew what to do with. I saved thousands of dollars, not 
to mention some nice, healthy trees.
 
 Sports equipment: Play It Again Sports has over 300 stores across the coun-
try. They’ve been very successful selling used sports equipment for a lot 
less than the new stuff, and most people don’t even notice the difference. 
Face it; that new set of golf clubs you paid $1,000 for turned into a used set 
after your first round of golf. And it didn’t even improve your game like you 
told your wife it would when you were trying to justify the big bucks.
 
Great places to find used but useable items are garage sales and swap meets 
(otherwise known as flea markets, where hundreds of vendors gather to sell 
used stuff). Many times you can find new stuff that sat on somebody’s shelf for 
years before they decided to sell it for $5. You can find good household appli-
ances, tools that are usually in great shape, clothing, kids’ toys, books, and more.
Avoiding disposable products
Many things are manufactured to be disposable: razors, batteries, cleaning 
brushes, dinnerware, and more. A great way to eliminate all the waste pro-
duced by using something only once or a few times before tossing it in the 
trash is to use things that are meant to be reusable. Many items fall into this 
category (regular dinnerware, for example, instead of paper plates, and cloth 
dishrags rather than paper towels), but a few things deserve special mention:
 
 Rechargeable batteries: They may cost more initially, but they save you 
(and the environment) in the long run. Here are the economics: Alkaline 
batteries cost around $1.00 apiece (for good ones) and they produce 
around 2,000 mAh (milliamp hours) apiece. Then you toss them out. 

220
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home
Rechargeable batteries cost around $12 apiece, and a good charger 
costs around $35, but you can charge a battery 2,000 times. The conclu-
sion: non-rechargeables cost around 22 times as much. And this doesn’t 
even take into account the environmental impact of discarded batteries. 
The best bet of all is to get a solar recharger, in which case you’re get-
ting all your battery power from the sun.
 
 Reusable coffee filters: You can get reusable coffee filters that are easy 
to use. (An added bonus? Coffee grinds are perfect for composting.)
 
 Reusable furnace filters: You simply wash them out when they get filled 
with dust. They cost more upfront, but they’re a lot cheaper in the long run.
 
 Christmas trees: Here’s one of my favorites. Don’t kill a tree this holiday 
season. If you buy a live tree, plant it when the season ends — in your 
yard, or maybe even in a public park so everybody can benefit. Or buy 
an artificial tree — no sap, no danger of burning the house down, and no 
cost (after the first year). They’re better than you may think.
Donating to others
If you no longer need something and can’t think of a creative way to reuse it, 
pass it along to someone who can.
Donate old furniture to charities. Most will come to your home and pick it 
up. You can probably save some tax dollars if you write this stuff off, but 
get a receipt and don’t push it too far, or you’ll get audited and indicted (in 
America, these are often one and the same in the finest tradition of capital-
ism). Your best bet is to take some digital photos of your donations and 
store them on your computer, just in case the IRS questions your magnificent 
sense of benevolence.
Lions Club International collects old prescription glasses and distributes 
them in third-world countries. Imagine if you didn’t have your glasses at all; 
now imagine how somebody in a third-world country will feel if they’re given 
a pair. Let there be light!
Fixing rather than throwing away
When something goes on the blink, don’t toss it and buy new. Instead, fix 
it whenever possible to cut down on your consumption and reduce waste. 
Check out How To Fix Everything For Dummies by Gary and Pam Hedstrom 
and Judy Ondrla Tremore (Wiley).  If you can’t fix it yourself, take it to a 
repair shop or hire a professional. Better yet, keep your equipment in good 
shape and you won’t have to fix it as often.

221
 Chapter 14: Reusing and Recycling: Play It Again, Sam
Household surfaces that have seen better days can be given a new life, too. 
You can resurface bathtubs, old stoves, and countertops so that they look 
brand new.
Recycling the Right Way Saves 
Everybody Energy
In 2005, over 80 million tons of paper were recycled, but that’s only a small 
fraction of all the paper that gets used. Americans also go through 4 million 
single-use plastic bottles every hour, yet only one in four gets recycled. So 
what stops folks from recycling? Mainly inconvenience. Thus, the best way to 
make recycling a reality is to set up a system that’s convenient and easy 
to use.
For everyday recyclables (paper, plastics, glass, and so on), put bins in the 
kitchen, if you can. You’re more likely to use a handy receptacle than an out-
of-the-way one.
 
Break down boxes and crush aluminum cans so that you don’t build up a pile 
that takes a lot of room. You can get a can crusher that makes the job a lot 
easier than squashing them under your boots (or on your forehead), although 
the latter may be more fun.
 
Aside from the more obvious candidates for recycling, here are some impor-
tant items to recycle:
 
 Laser toner cartridges: These are full of resins and poisons, plus they 
take a lot of energy to manufacture. Insist on recharged cartridges when 
you buy, and hand your old ones in at the same time. Look in the yellow 
pages under “Computer Supplies” to find a store that sells recycled car-
tridges and takes in old ones.
 
 Appliances: These can almost always be recycled. Call your trash collec-
tors and they may pick them up right at your door. Or you can donate 
them when the new equipment is delivered (most appliance stores have 
active recycling programs — they get some money for the old stuff, but 
more power to them).
 
 Old batteries: Even the rechargeable ones can be recycled, which makes 
a lot of sense. For information on recycling batteries, including those 
from laptops, cellphones, camcorders, and the like, visit Rechargeable 
Battery Recycling Corporation at www.rbrc.org. A number of large 
national stores serve as battery drop-off sites, including Lowe’s, Sears, 
Best Buy, Home Depot, Radio Shack, Office Depot, Target, and Wal-Mart.

222
Part II: Reducing Inefficiencies throughout Your Home
 
 Books: You can recycle old books, especially the trashy novels without 
any redeeming literary features (these are the ones that people want, 
which gives you a good indication of where our society is headed). You 
can also recycle For Dummies books, but in my view, people should 
always buy brand-new ones. In fact, people should buy five or six, just in 
case they run out.
For more information on recycling options, check out The Freecycle Network 
at www.freecycle.org.

Part III
Putting Alternative 
Energy Sources to 
Work for You

In this part . . .
M
ost people use utility-provided power for their 
homes. This includes electrical as well as gas 
(such as propane, natural gas, methane, and so on). Yet 
there are a lot of alternative energy sources that you can 
take advantage of. Do it right and you can save money and 
make your home more comfortable at the same time. 
In this part, I show you how to choose a wood stove, help 
you decide what types of wood to burn, and tell you how 
to burn them. I tell you all about solar power, which is a 
very good alternative energy source that’s becoming more 
and more common as the costs come down. Radiant heat-
ing systems, biomass heating systems, and geothermal 
also provide excellent opportunities that you may want to 
consider. They’re covered here, too.

Chapter 15
Burning Desires: 
Wood and Gas Stoves
In This Chapter
 Looking at the various types of stoves
 Maximizing heat circulation
 Maintaining a safe environment when using stoves
Your HVAC system is your home’s biggest consumer of energy. Most 
HVAC systems don’t operate very efficiently, even if their workload is 
minimized. HVACs are big machines, and they take a lot of power. All is not 
lost, however. By using a stove, you can minimize the HVAC system’s “on” 
time and utilize energy in your home more efficiently. (Because of the energy 
drain of most HVAC systems, however, remember that a 50 percent efficiency 
improvement is about the best you can expect.)
Some stoves are better than others, of course, in terms of energy efficiency 
and/or pollution. In this chapter, I take you through the various stove options 
and present their pros and cons.
 
Most of the heat that you generate with a whole-house furnace is wasted on 
empty rooms and spaces. Which means that heating just the part of your 
home that you and your family spend the most time in is more efficient than 
whole-house heating. If you heat without using electric utility power for blow-
ers and air movement, you’re operating even more efficiently. Stoves provide 
for localized heating, and if you design your system the right way and use it 
properly, a good stove can heat an entire home as well.
Open Fireplaces: The Granddaddy 
of Them All
When many people think of heating with fireplaces, they picture a fire crack-
ling in an open hearth. They should also be picturing a huge waste of energy 

226
Part III: Putting Alternative Energy Sources to Work for You 
and money. Open fireplaces are absolutely the worst choice for efficient 
heating. Why? Because they draw cold air into the home to feed themselves 
and, due to the chimney effect (refer to Chapter 8), most of the hot air they 
generate goes right out the chimney. Here’s how, in a grim nutshell, these 
fireplaces work (see Figure 15-1):
 
1. You start the fire. This process usually entails kindling, matches, and 
some “blowing” to get things going.
 
2. You open the damper. If a cooking vent or bathroom vent is on in your 
home, or if the HVAC system is on, cold air may rush down the chimney, 
creating a backdraft and causing smoke to waft out into your living space.
 
3. As the chimney effect kicks in, the smoke begins to rise up the chimney, 
and the fire grows hotter and brighter. Orange flames, the norm, mean 
the wood isn’t burning very efficiently. In fact, flames of any kind are inef-
ficient because the wood is not burning very thoroughly. (Efficiency is in 
direct contradiction to romantic ambient, when it comes to a fireplace.)
 
4. Because fire needs fresh oxygen, the fire in your fireplace is now pull-
ing up to 500 cubic feet per minute through windows and air leaks in 
your home. If somebody opens a door to the outside, cold air will rush 
in because the pressure in your home is less than it is outside (if not, 
the chimney effect wouldn’t be working). This air ends up going up the 
chimney once it’s heated in the fire.

227
 Chapter 15: Burning Desires: Wood and Gas Stoves
The end result is that your home is actually getting colder, not hotter. The 
only part of the home that’s getting hotter is right in front of the fire, and this 
is exactly why people like fires so much. There’s no denying the romantic ele-
ment. But at what price?
If you just can’t live without the romantic open flames or you’re stuck with 
what you’ve got, you can achieve better efficiency with these tips:
 
 When lighting your fireplace, open a door or window nearby so that the 
rush of air a fire takes before it settles down to a more static state will 
only move through a small portion of your home. Once the fire settles 
down, close the door or window.
 
 Burn hot, blazing fires because the combustion is more thorough. Don’t 
burn little fires (although at some point your fire will need to burn out, 
so you’ll end up with a little fire anyway).
 
 Use andirons to lift the logs above the floor so that during the burn cycle 
the hot cinders fall down onto a bed of coals and burn better and more 
thoroughly.
 
 Glass doors limit the amount of air being pulled through the home, 
but they also limit the amount of heat radiating back into the room, so 
they’re pretty much a wash in terms of efficiency.
 
 Close the damper as much as possible. When you’re not burning a fire, 
close it completely. This is a hassle, granted, but it makes a big difference. 
When the damper is open, air will be drawn down the chimney whenever 
a vent fan or the HVAC system in your home is turned on. Not only does 
this result in cold air, but it could also mean a big stink and unhealthy air.
Surveying General Categories of Stoves
In this section, I move from open fireplaces to what is referred to as a 
“stove.” These differ by being enclosed in a specially designed burn chamber 
so that you can achieve much more efficient combustion (by controlling the 
burn temperature) plus much more efficient dispersion of the heat into your 
living space. Stoves are made to burn a wide variety of fuels, and the type 
that homeowners choose depends mostly on availability and cost.
Free-standing stoves simply sit in a corner of your room, without walls or 
bricks surrounding them. An insert fits into an existing open fireplace slot (a 
very good way to go from poor efficiency to good efficiency while still using 
the expensive decorative elements of your existing fireplace).

228
Part III: Putting Alternative Energy Sources to Work for You 
 
Before deciding what type of stove you want to install in your home, check 
with your county building department for requirements, specifications, and so 
forth. These may make a big difference in your decision on which type is best 
for your particular application. Also, check with your insurance company; 
they probably have some dictates you need to follow as well.
Comparing open- and closed-vent systems
There are two important types of venting systems: closed vents and open 
vents.
With an open-vent system, shown in Figure 15-2, air is drawn from the room 
and used for combustion, and then the exhaust is vented up the chimney. 
An open-vent system (see Figure 15-3) is always less efficient than a closed-
vent system, because the air used in combustion is inevitably drawn from the 
great outdoors through cracks and leaks in your home’s envelope (thereby 
making the home colder). In a closed-vent system, air is drawn from the out-
side and vented back to the outside.

Closed-vent systems are safer than open ones. Naturally, you want to seal 
your home to a high degree in order to make your heating efforts more effi-
cient (see Chapter 7). However, in doing so, you may cause a carbon monox-
ide or carbon dioxide hazard with an open-vent system. Or you may cause 
oxygen depletion, because the fire is competing with the human inhabitants 
for oxygen, and the fire is generally greedier. This problem is particularly 
dangerous because people don’t know when they’re being starved of oxygen; 
they just pass out.
 
If you have a stove that draws room air for combustion, crack open a window 
nearby. Instead of having cold air drawn through your entire home, the com-
bustion air will come from that open window. Radiant heat will still work its 
way throughout the room in which the stove is located.
Looking at free-standing 
stoves and inserts
Aside from open- and closed-vent systems (see the preceding section), stove 
types sport another distinction: They can be either free-standing or inserts. 
A free-standing stove sits in the room proper, whereas an insert is made to fit 
into an existing fireplace slot.

230
Part III: Putting Alternative Energy Sources to Work for You 
Free-standing stoves are inherently more efficient than inserts because, all else 
being equal, more of the generated heat makes it into the living space. Depending 
on the space they are mounted into, some inserts are completely surrounded 
by brick and mortar and do a very poor job of getting heat into the living space. 
Most of it goes up the chimney. Still, an insert is much more efficient than an 
open fireplace, and if you have an open fireplace, you’re not likely to be installing 
a free-standing stove because then you’ll have a big, unused fireplace.
If you’re starting from scratch, installing a free-standing stove with a vent system 
is a lot cheaper than building a fireplace, not to mention the efficiency advan-
tages. On the other hand, free-standing stoves take up more of your home’s 
square footage, are an eyesore, and are more likely to cause burns. In the 
summer, they’re just plain superfluous sitting there looking black and bulky.
Using a Wood-Burning Stove
Wood-burning stoves are the most common stove simply because wood is 
available virtually everywhere. Because the supply of wood is self-replenishing, 
it has the further advantage of being renewable. Wood-burning certainly has 
the most tradition on its side, so more equipment is available, as well as a 
wider range of raw wood resources to choose from.
Burning wood to heat your home has several pros:
 
 The operating costs are fairly low if you have a ready source of fire-
wood. In fact, the out-of-pocket expense can be zero, aside from the 
expense of whatever you use to chop down trees. With little more than 
an axe and some elbow grease, you’re in business.
 
 A wide variety of heating appliances are available at literally any price 
you can pay. You can find old stoves for next to nothing, and they work 
well enough.
 
 No electricity is required. Fans are an exception, but they’re always 
optional.
 
 The fuel supply is sustainable. And if burned properly, the impact on the 
environment is very low.
 
Trees convert carbon dioxide into oxygen, so a live tree actually mitigates 
global warming. But a dead tree left to rot on the forest floor releases as much 
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as a wood stove that burns the same 
amount of wood. (The difference is that wood left to rot on the forest floor 
does so slowly, releasing its carbon over a period of years, and from day to 
day the outgas level doesn’t change much.) The upshot is that if you burn 
wood from a downed tree, you’re not contributing to global warming at all. 
Still, burning wood does cause a lot of smoke, and some communities ban 
wood-burning altogether, particularly when pollution levels are high.

231
 Chapter 15: Burning Desires: Wood and Gas Stoves
 
If pollution is your concern, insist on burning either dead trees or doomed 
trees (those that have been removed for building developments or other simi-
lar reasons). Don’t use trees that have simply been cut down for burning. If 
you do, insist that a new tree be planted in its place.
Of course, using a wood stove to heat your home has cons as well as pros. 
On the downside are the following considerations:
 
 Wood-burning stoves can be very dangerous if they’re not installed 
properly.
 
 You need a lot of dedicated storage space to store the wood you intend 
to burn.
 
 Heavy physical labor is required in chopping, transporting, and stacking 
wood. And whenever you need wood indoors, you have to tote it in and 
place it very carefully into the burn chamber.
 
 Wood stoves create a dirty home environment, with dust and stink. 
There are a lot of ashes to clean up, and this is a dirty, stinky process 
that inevitably makes a mess of your home.
 
 Burning wood properly (to get the most efficiency) requires you to pay 
attention to the process and continually manipulate the wood stack as 
well as the damping levels.
 
 Wood stoves require chimney maintenance. Burning wood creates 
creosote gunk on your vent or chimney liner, and this can catch on fire 
if you’re not diligent. Softwoods are much worse in this regard than 
hardwoods.
 
 The potential for pollution is high if you don’t use your wood stove 
properly (you don’t maintain the proper burning temperatures, for 
example, or you don’t keep the stove cleaned out).
 
 Use of a wood stove may increase your fire insurance premiums. You 
must tell your homeowner’s insurance agent that you have a stove (they’ll 
probably ask). In many cases, they’ll come to your home to inspect the 
installation. If things aren’t as they should be, your insurance company 
may refuse you or give you a set amount of time to get it up to code.
 
Wood-burning stoves are banned in some areas. In other areas, burning is 
banned on particularly dirty air days. In these areas, utilities generally offer 
rebates and subsidies to convert to cleaner systems. Check with your local air 
resources board.
Types of wood stoves
In producing new clean-burning stoves, manufacturers have taken one of two 
routes: one that uses a catalytic combustor and one that causes more com-
plete combustion.

232
Part III: Putting Alternative Energy Sources to Work for You 
Older wood stoves had efficiency ratings of 40 to 50 percent, but today’s cer-
tified stoves boast efficiencies of 70 to 80 percent. As the efficiency goes up, 
the pollution a stove creates generally goes down (for one thing, when effi-
ciency is high you burn less fuel; for another, when you burn fuel much more 
completely, there are fewer pollution byproducts). If you’ve got a leaky, old 
stove, it’s always a good investment to upgrade.
 
Check the efficiency ratings of the stoves you’re considering, because they 
may vary quite a bit.
Some wood stoves incorporate a catalytic converter (see Figure 15-4), which 
burns off smoke and fumes that would otherwise exhaust or drift up a chimney. 
The catalytic converter consists of a honeycomb-shaped substrate coated with 
a catalyst, usually a precious metal such as platinum or palladium. When the 
smoke passes through the honeycomb, the catalyst lowers the smoke’s burning 
temperature, causing it to ignite. The result is a more efficient burn, less smoke 
up the chimney, and less pollution. Most stove manufacturers now offer catalytic 
models in which the combustor is an integral part of the stove. It is also possible 
to retrofit some older stoves with converters.

233
 Chapter 15: Burning Desires: Wood and Gas Stoves
Starting a fire in a catalytic stove is more involved than doing so with a con-
ventional stove. You have to open a bypass damper when you either start or 
reload a fire. The damper directs the combustion gases directly up the flue 
(bypassing the catalytic element) until the temperature is high enough (350°F 
to 600°F) to get the combustor kicked into gear. This process is referred to 
as lighting off. A catalyst temperature monitor is normally included to let you 
know when to move the damper.
Catalytic stoves require a lot more maintenance than their conventional 
counterparts. The catalytic convertor needs to be changed periodically. 
Otherwise, you could actually end up with a very inefficient fire. These types 
of stoves are more expensive, and probably not worth the cost unless you 
put a very high premium on pollution.
Burning the right wood
The efficient use of a woodstove is almost always predicated on your source 
of wood. If you have your own trees that you can cut down and process, 
great. Or maybe you live in a wooded area and a ready supply of cut firewood 
is available from local vendors. Very rarely is transporting wood a long dis-
tance cost effective, which means you’re limited to the types of wood that 
are indigenous to the area you live in.
Some types of woods are better than others for burning. Two factors deter-
mine the suitability of a given wood: whether it burns well and generates 
heat, and what kind of mess it makes in the process.
Hardwoods are almost always better than softwoods for burning because you 
get a lot more Btu per unit weight and volume, which means a lot less work 
on your part per Btu generated. Hardwoods also deposit less creosote in your 
chimney and vent system, making them safer and cleaner for the environment. 
Some people are suckers for the fact that softwoods are so much cheaper than 
hardwoods, but in fact, hardwoods are much more cost effective. Check out 
www.hearth.com/fuelcalc/woodvalues.html for a calculator on differ-
ent types of firewood and the Btu you can expect from them.
 
Any wood you burn must be properly seasoned, or dried out (wet wood 
smokes a lot, won’t burn at a hot temperature, hisses and pops and may be 
dangerous, and puts a lot of crud into your vent system). To season wood, 
split logs as soon as possible into the size that will fit into your stove and 
stack them in a dry spot for 6 to 18 months. Pile the wood so that air can cir-
culate. Hardwoods take longer to dry than softwoods do. Humidity and tem-
perature also affect drying times.

234
Part III: Putting Alternative Energy Sources to Work for You 
 
Although burning hardwood is better than burning softwood, the latter isn’t 
out of the question. Some things, on the other hand, should never be burned 
in a wood stove:
 
 Green wood: Green wood is freshly cut from a live tree. It will smoke 
like crazy and stink and probably won’t burn very thoroughly. Plus, a 
lot of water will steam out of it, resulting in sparks when you open the 
door to the burn chamber. How can you tell whether wood is green? See 
whether it’s brittle — if so, it’s not green.
 
 Although you shouldn’t burn green wood, you can buy green wood in 
late spring, when prices are very low because demand is down. It will 
dry over the hot summer months and you’ll save money. In fact, if you 
can, buy a whole gob of green firewood at the same time and you’ll get a 
great discount.
 
 Garbage, plastic, foil, or any kind of chemically treated or painted 
wood: They all produce noxious fumes, which are dangerous and pollut-
ing. If you have a catalytic stove, the residue from burning plastics may 
clog the catalytic combustor.
 
 Trash (paper or plastic): Paper wastes tend to make a very hot fire for a 
short period of time, encouraging the ignition of any creosote deposits 
in your stovepipe. And synthetic wastes, such as plastic wrappers, pro-
duce acids when they burn. Acids make for a very short stove lifetime.
 
 Manufactured logs (like Duraflame): This is extremely dangerous. 
They burn too hot and can cause a fire when you open the door. I am an 
expert on this warning; one of the most startling things I’ve ever expe-
rienced in my life occurred when I opened a woodstove door while a 
manufactured log was burning, and the flames literally shot out into the 
room. I feel lucky to have only paid for this stupidity with my eyebrows.
Burning the wood right
The actual burning process inside your stove represents the biggest factor in 
safety, efficiency, and convenience.
 
 In the firebox, avoid placing pieces of wood in parallel directions, 
where they may stack too closely. Always try to get some air movement 
between pieces of wood.
 
 Adjust the burning embers periodically with a poker to keep your fire 
burning properly. Unfortunately, there are no rigid guidelines; learning 
to use your stove optimally takes practice. Just play around with it.
 
 If you’re looking for the most heat fast, vary the position of the wood to 
maximize the exposed surface area of each piece of wood. If you’re after 
a long-term burn (overnight, unattended) minimize the space between 
the pieces.

235
 Chapter 15: Burning Desires: Wood and Gas Stoves
Buying wood
If you don’t have your own supply of wood, either 
from your own trees or a friend or relative who’s 
happy to let you have firewood in exchange for 
clearing the dead trees from their land, you’ll 
need to buy your firewood. Fortunately, you can 
find it just about anywhere. Unfortunately, you 
have to watch out for a few things:
  Firewood is usually sold in cords. A cord is a 
nice, even stack 8’ high x 4’ wide x 4’ deep, 
or a volume of 128 cubic feet. Only thing is, 
it’s never stacked nice and neat so you can 
rarely tell just how much firewood you’re 
actually getting. You often see filled pickup 
trucks sitting in grocery store parking lots 
with a sign advertising the cord price. You 
agree to buy, they follow you home and dump 
the wood in your yard, and you stack it and 
find it’s not really a cord at all. So now what? 
You want to pick a fight with Paul Bunyan? 
The best bet is to buy from a reputable sup-
plier; get a reference, if possible.
  The length of the wood is important. Many 
people make the mistake of measuring the 
opening of their wood stove’s door and then 
ordering the wood cut slightly smaller. This 
doesn’t work because the workers cutting the 
wood don’t measure it (they aren’t making a 
whole lot of money off this deal, and it’s hard 
work, so cut them some slack). You’ll get 
pieces that are too big, and then what are you 
going to do with those? So allow a margin of 
about 20 percent when you order the wood.
  Don’t buy firewood that’s been sitting on the 
bottom of a huge pile for a couple months 
or more (especially in bad weather). It’ll be 
covered in mud because the rain washes all 
the dirt and dust off the wood piled above it. 
Your burn chamber will then fill with dirt and 
mud, in addition to the usual ashes. This is 
heavy, stinky, and inefficient.
Here’s a little tip: A good way to save money in 
what you spend on firewood is to split the logs 
yourself. Then you can buy about any size logs 
you want (and save a lot of money to boot). You 
can get special splitting tools (most tool rental 
places have them available), or you can work 
your butt off with an old-fashioned axe.
 
 Only use wood properly sized for your stove’s fire chamber. Smaller 
pieces burn faster and hotter.
 
 Always keep the door closed when attending to the fire — when the 
door is open, too much oxygen enters the burn chamber.
 
A good technique for producing a relatively clean, long burn (overnight) is 
to load your stove with a mixture of partially seasoned and well-dried wood 
about half an hour before bedtime. Leave the damper open to give the fire a 
good start; then damp the strongly burning blaze down for the night.
Maintaining your wood stove
Maintaining a wood stove means having the chimney swept. This entails 
going up onto the roof (or wherever the vent terminates at the top) and forc-
ing special brushes down that clean away the built up creosote and tar.

236
Part III: Putting Alternative Energy Sources to Work for You 
A stove that is not damped excessively (and that has a well-designed chimney of 
factory-built, insulated pipe) may not need a sweep for an entire season. On the 
other hand, even a comparatively well-installed system could need cleaning as 
often as every two weeks. Your stove’s instruction manual will provide explicit 
instructions on how to tell when cleaning is needed and the best way to go about 
it. After installing a new stove, be sure to check the stovepipe for creosoting 
every two weeks until you become accustomed to the heater’s behavior. (Any 
deposits over 1/4-inch thick indicate that the pipe needs attention.)
 
You can monitor the accumulation of creosote and other deposits in your 
stovepipe by tapping on the sections with a metal object. Once you’re used to 
the ringing sound that a clean pipe makes, the dull thud of a dirty one will be 
distinctive.
It’s a good idea to have your stove system inspected by a pro at the begin-
ning of each burn season.
 
To monitor the operation of your wood stove, check the exhaust coming out 
of the chimney. You should see the transparent white steam of evaporating 
water only — darker, opaque smoke will be just slightly visible. The darker the 
color of the exhaust, the less efficiently your stove is operating.
Heating with a Gas Stove
Many homes have propane or natural gas supplies for cooking and heat-
ing both ambient air and domestic water. This is a safe and consistent form 
of energy, and it’s cheaper than electricity, though not nearly as cheap as 
wood-burning. You can use propane or natural gas to power a stove, and the 
results can be very rewarding.
For the most part, the safety, installation, and chimney/vent maintenance 
details are the same as with wood stoves. You don’t need to worry about 
creosote buildup nearly as much, because gas burns more efficiently and 
consistently than wood. When your gas stove is installed, it will be fine-tuned 
to burn according to the manufacturer’s specifications.
Here are the pros of using natural gas stoves. Many people are switching 
from wood to gas for all these reasons:
 
 All you do is flip a switch and you’re generating heat. No logs to tote, no 
fires to start.
 
 You can maintain temperature with a thermostat-controlled switching 
system, so you can achieve much better consistency than you can with 
a wood stove. In addition, gas stoves usually come with very effective 
blower systems for distributing hot air.

237
 Chapter 15: Burning Desires: Wood and Gas Stoves
 
 The gas company (or utility) delivers the gas to your home. In most 
cases, you contract with a supply company and they come to your home 
periodically and fill up your tank. You don’t worry about a thing (except 
paying the bill).
 
 Cleanup is much easier: You don’t have any ashes to sweep up and 
hardly any creosote builds up in the vent system.
 
 The pollution numbers are very good compared to wood stoves. In 
regions where wood stoves are banned, gas stoves are almost always 
acceptable.
 
 You can get either open flame style units, which look quite a bit like a real 
fire with the new aesthetic improvements in logs and ashes, or you can get 
completely enclosed units that offer better efficiencies and more utility.
 
 Most units can be used without electricity, which means that, if you lose 
power, your stove is still good to go.
Of course, as with anything, using a gas stove also has some cons:
 
 Some units need electricity. Blowers always do.
 
 Gas stoves aren’t cheap compared to other alternatives in terms of both 
fuel expense and installation costs (in fact, they’re usually more costly 
to install), and gas may go way up in price, making this option even 
more expensive.
 
 The flame, although real, doesn’t seem as real as that of a wood stove. 
If you feel a fire just isn’t a fire without the smell, sound, and changing 
flames, then you’ll probably be disappointed with a gas.
 
 Enclosed units prevent roasting marshmallows.
Looking at Electric Fireplaces
Electric fireplaces and inserts are mostly for show, and they can do a pretty 
good job of that, if you can buy into the concept and suspend your disbelief. 
They’re inexpensive (no plumbing, no vents, no hassles — just plug and play), 
and you can get a complete unit that you simply set against a wall, plug in, and 
voilà. Who’s to begrudge a little romance to those in apartments and condos?
Most electric fireplaces come with heaters and a fan so that you can also get 
them to heat a room for about the same price as an electric space heater. But 
keep in mind that you’re using a lot of electricity to do little more than put on 
a show, and if your utility is providing you with coal-fired electricity, you’re 
also creating pollution.

238
Part III: Putting Alternative Energy Sources to Work for You 
Although many people truly like their units, you may get tired of yours long 
before its lifetime has expired. So before you talk yourself into an electric fire-
place as a substitute for the real thing, visit somebody who already has one 
and check out the way it looks and works.
Electric fireplaces offer the following plusses:
 
 They have zero emissions (at least locally; the power company is still 
spewing forth to provide your electricity).
 
 They can be installed anywhere.
 
 New technologies make the fire look somewhat real.
 
 They’re movable. You can move one from room to room, and take it with 
you if you move to a new home. You can even sell it in a garage sale.
On the negative side, you have the following:
 
 Fake-looking fires.
 
 No electricity, no bananas; when utility power is out, you’re shivering.
 
 Fuel costs are very high — $45 per M/Btu.
Deciding Which Stove Is Right for You
As the earlier sections make clear, when you make the decision to supplement 
or replace your home’s heating with a stove, you have these choices: a wood 
stove, a gas stove, or an electric fireplace. Each has its advantages and disad-
vantages. Before you make your decision, however, you should consider what 
factors determine the efficiency of any stove: things like how the stove gener-
ates heat, the amount of space it’s capable of heating (and how you can extend 
that if necessary), and how you can use your existing chimney or vent system, 
if you have one, with your new stove or, if you don’t have an existing chimney, 
what it would take to build the necessary venting apparatus.
How does the stove burn and heat?
In gas stoves, combustion can be tuned to a high degree, and the stove will 
always work the same way because it’s a closed process that doesn’t require 
intervention (plus the fuel is very consistent). On the opposite extreme are 
wood stoves, which vary in performance for a number of reasons:
 
 The wood composition and quality varies quite a bit. Even if you buy the 
same species, such as oak, and the wood is cut from trees in the same 
forest, the variations are tremendous.

239
 Chapter 15: Burning Desires: Wood and Gas Stoves
 
 Wood is often piled high, and the stuff on the bottom gets muddy. This 
affects combustion quite a bit, not to mention the mess it makes.
 
 Stoves vary. The same wood burned in different stoves will combust 
differently.
 
 Over the course of the burn cycle, raw wood turns to ashes. Ashes build 
up and change the dynamics of the combustion process.
 
 Weather can affect how a stove burns by changing the way the chimney 
draws. If your home is oriented just right, you may experience severe 
back drafts on windy days.
Once the heat is generated in the stove, the next issue to contend with is how 
the stove gets the heat into the room. With some stoves, most of the heat is 
lost up the chimney. Other types of stoves are very efficient at channeling the 
heat into a room.
 
After the heat is in the room, how that heat is utilized makes a big difference 
in your comfort (Chapter 8 has more details on comfort). Heat rises, so in 
a large, open room the ceiling will be much warmer than the floor. This is a 
waste, unless the occupants are living near the ceiling (for instance, if you are 
living in an inverted gravity zone where things fall up instead of down).
How much area does the stove cover?
In deciding which type of stove is best for your needs, your first order of  busi-
ness is to decide how much of your home you want to heat with a stove. If all 
you want to heat is a single room, your options are simple because you don’t 
need to move air in a complicated fashion and you can buy a small stove. If 
you’re planning on heating a number of rooms or an entire home, you need to 
figure out how you’re going to move the warm air from the stove to the adjoin-
ing rooms. When it comes to moving air, you have several options:
 
 Ceiling fans: These are a cost-effective way to reduce fuel bills and even 
out temperature variations. If your home has high ceilings or an open 
loft, most of the heat will rise to those areas and eventually migrate out 
through the roof. A well-placed fan will move this hot air back down into 
your living spaces (Chapter 13 offers more suggestions on how to move 
air through your home).
 
 Ecofans: Ecofans offer a very efficient and effective way to move the hot 
air your stove is generating. An Ecofan (check out www.realgoods.com 
or enter “Ecofan” in your search engine) exploits the simple laws of ther-
modynamics to move a fan blade without the use of electricity or exter-
nal power. You set the fan on top of your stove and after it gets hot, the 
blade spins and moves up to 150 cubic feet minute (cfm) of air. Ecofans 
cost over $100, but over the long term they’re a lot cheaper than using 
ceiling fans, and they can make your wood stove up to 30 percent more 
effective (I said effective, not efficient) by distributing the hot air.

240
Part III: Putting Alternative Energy Sources to Work for You 
 
 Your HVAC fan system: Most HVAC furnaces (the kind that use forced 
air) have a switch setting that allows the blower to run without having 
the heat on (Fan Only is a common label). If you run your HVAC system 
in this mode, it will distribute the heat generated by your stove through-
out your entire home.
Smoking out vents and chimneys
You may or may not have a fireplace in your home. If you don’t, you’ll have 
to install a chimney or vent system from scratch. If you have an existing fire-
place, it may or may not be suitable for the stove option you want to install. 
The best bet, of course, is to alter the existing infrastructure as little as pos-
sible, but this may not be practical or safe.
A properly designed chimney (or vent system) is a prerequisite for any safe 
stove installation. For example, the flue must be made of a suitable heat-
resistant material and it must be separated from combustibles by a specified 
distance (see county codes and installation specifications for a particular 
stove).
Rules regarding masonry chimneys used to vent a stove state that they must 
be lined — usually with clay flue tiles, which should be mortared at the joints 
with refractory cement and separated from the stone, brick, or block work. 
The interior surface shouldn’t show signs of chipping. Likewise, the exterior 
masonry and joints should be sound. Unfortunately, the likelihood of an exist-
ing chimney meeting all these criteria is not very good (if you’re in doubt, 
have an expert come in and take a look). If the chimney is deficient because 
it’s too large, lacks a liner, or is in poor repair, you have these options:
 
 Bring it up to snuff (relining and so forth). If you choose this option, 
letting a pro do the job is highly recommended.
 
 Abandon it. For about the same cost as relining, you can install a fac-
tory-built, insulated metal chimney. This is a good idea because technol-
ogy has improved quite a bit, and you’ll be getting better performance 
along with better safety.
 
 Install a new stovepipe in an existing chimney. This is probably the 
best option of all because not only does it eliminate the problem of the 
deficient chimney, but it also gives you the option to look into a closed 
system (a stove, in other words).
 
 When using a fireplace chimney for stove exhaust, the entry to the 
fireplace must be sealed, or, if the connector joins the flue above the 
fireplace, the chimney must be plugged below the point of junction. This 
precaution not only prevents burning embers from cascading down into 
your fireplace (and onto your floor), but also maintains the proper draft.

241
 Chapter 15: Burning Desires: Wood and Gas Stoves
Most county regulations prohibit the passage of stovepipe through any floor, 
ceiling, or fire wall without special feed-throughs. You may, however, pass 
your pipe through either a wall or a floor/ceiling if you use a factory-built 
insulated chimney. If you don’t have a suitable masonry chimney, this expen-
sive venting option is your only choice.
Abiding by Safety Guidelines
Stoves obviously pose a lot of dangers. With any type of stove, you can start 
a fire, create smoke hazards, or get burned badly. To avoid potential danger 
and the legal liabilities that may come with it:
 
 Make sure you know and follow the safety and operation guidelines out-
lined in your stove’s instruction manual. If you don’t have an instruction 
manual, get one online or contact the stove’s manufacturer.
 
 Contact your county building department to find out what the applicable 
codes and guidelines are in your area. If you don’t follow code and 
you cause a fire or other danger, you could have an insurance claim 
denied or even find yourself in legal limbo if there’s collateral damage.
 
 Call your homeowners insurance company and ask them what type of 
requirements they have for stoves. Many insurance companies will insist 
on coming out to your home so they can inspect your stove firsthand. 
(So many stoves have been installed inadequately that they can’t just 
take your word for it.) Sometimes the insurance company’s standards 
are stricter than the county’s, and you may find your insurance canceled 
or your rates increased if you don’t mind your p’s and q’s.
 
 If you’re buying a home with a stove, have it inspected by a pro before 
you take possession of the home (or before you make an offer). If it’s 
substandard, deal with this problem upfront. Ask the sellers to make 
things right. They’ll have a hard time refusing because they’ll take on a 
lot of liability if they do. Have the chimney inspected as well. It may be 
coated with creosote, or it may not be up to standards.
 
 Don’t install any type of stove yourself. A whole host of details go into 
the installation of a stove, and failure to pay attention to any one of 
them can lead to a safety problem. For that reason, I don’t include instal-
lation instructions for stoves in this chapter, and I strongly recommend 
that you hire a pro. Although it’s true that many novices install stoves 
themselves, the reality is that if you do have a problem, the conse-
quences could be huge. You may pay big time, or even worse, somebody 
could die. Nothing is worth that risk. I’m one of the most qualified do-it-
yourselfers on the planet, and when I needed a gas stove installed, I had 
nothing to do with it aside from watching and learning.

 Keep in mind that the fuel you burn in your stove is just as combustible 
while it’s in storage as it is when it’s in the combustion chamber. If you 
have a gas tank, it could literally blow up if abused. If you have a wood 
pile, it’ll burn very hot and fast if you’re not careful. Always consider 
fuel storage while you’re designing your stove system.
 
 Always make sure to have adequate smoke alarm coverage in your 
home, and make sure to keep the batteries fresh in every smoke alarm. 
You should also consider installing a carbon monoxide alarm. It’s always 
better to be safe than sorry.

F
rom a pollution standpoint, solar power is the most energy-efficient invest-
ment you can make, hands down. Sunshine will always be free. Solar power 
equipment, however, can be expensive and isn’t suitable for climates that don’t 
get enough sunshine. Government subsidies play a big role in solar power, but 
they vary with the political winds. The most definitive factor in determining the 
viability of solar power is local utility rates; if yours are high, solar energy may 
be just what you’re looking for because the financial efficiency is good. When 
all the factors are working for you, an investment in solar energy can be much 
better than an investment in the stock market.
In this chapter, I cover the most popular solar investments, and I present some 
guidelines on when and where solar power is a worthwhile investment. For 
more details, consult my book Solar Power Your Home For Dummies (Wiley).
Supplementing Your Domestic Hot Water 
Heater with Solar Energy
Around 20 percent of the typical home’s energy budget goes toward heating 
water. With a solar water heater, you can offset around 70 percent of this 
cost. You can’t offset the entire water heating function, because solar energy 
is unavailable at night and in bad weather conditions. Thus, a backup source 
for heat is a necessity.

244
Part III: Putting Alternative Energy Sources to Work for You 
Over 20 different types of water heating systems are available, but some are just 
too expensive (high-tech evacuated tube systems work well but cost too much, 
although that’s bound to change because they are the best technology), and 
others are too cheap — they don’t offer enough performance to overcome the 
sacrifices. The following sections outline the most common types of systems.
 
Before you invest in any system, make sure you understand the factors that dic-
tate which type of system is best for use in your home. These factors include
 
 Climate, in particular, freezing weather and exceptionally hot 
weather. If you live in a cold climate, you know about water freezing and 
bursting pipes. But did you know that too much heat can be every bit as 
damaging as too much cold? Boiled pipes burst just like frozen ones. If 
you live in a cold climate, make sure the system you get is one that mini-
mizes the potential for freezing pipes. If you live in a very sunny climate, 
make sure the system you pick can deal with the heat.
 
 Desired water temperature. How hot is the water you are looking for and 
what time of day do you need it? Some systems take longer to heat water 
than others (any system without a secondary reservoir takes longer to 
heat). Those that include backup heating (electrical or gas powered) will 
always have hot water on hand, but your utility costs may be more.
 
 Quantity of hot water produced. How much hot water does your family 
use, and when do they use it? To calculate how much hot water you 
need, measure flow and multiply it by the amount of time you and your 
family spend in the shower. If you also use a lot of hot water for laundry 
and dishes, add about ten gallons per load. (See Chapter 2 for details on 
measuring your water flow.)
An ICS batch system
An Integral Collector System (ICS), as shown in Figure 16-1, is the simplest and 
cheapest, although its suitability is limited to mild climates (with very little 
freezing and not too much hot weather). This type of system is passive — it 
doesn’t involve any pumps — and is normally plumbed directly between the 
cold water supply and the water heater, making the plumbing job easy and 
straightforward. An ICS batch system provides a simple and effective way to 
preheat water for your existing domestic water heater. Because you’re putting 
hot water into your standard domestic hot water heater, you hot water heater 
doesn’t have to work so hard. (If the water in the ICS system isn’t heated, the 
domestic heater does what it would normally do.)
A 3' x 8' ICS unit holds 30 gallons of water. Collected Btu (the amount of heat 
that the collector actually captures and converts to heat in the water) are 
22,000 for an average day in North America. (The average household uses 
around 10,000 to 15,000 Btu per person per day.) Larger units are also avail-
able: A 4' x 8' unit holds 50 gallons of water and can collect 30,000 Btu per day.

For the smaller unit, expect to pay around $1,700 for the collector, plus the cost 
of pipes, hardware, and labor for installation — around $2,400 is typical. The 
larger unit costs around $1,900, plus installation. Complete kits are available that 
include all the valves plus the collector and its associated mounting hardware.
If you’re willing to change your habits, the use of an ICS batch system can 
reduce the energy workload on your conventional water heater to around 
ten percent. For instance, if each member of the family showers at a differ-
ent time of day, the batch collector can heat up again between showers. If 
you take your shower in the afternoon, when the midday sun has heated the 
water in the tank, your residential heater will have very little work to do. You 
can run your dishwasher in the late afternoon instead of in the morning, too.
But before you run out and buy an ICS batch system, consider these things:
 
 Freezing is a big problem because the collector holds the water being 
heated (although big batch collectors can withstand longer freezing 
conditions than less bulky systems). The system has manual drain 
valves that you can use to drain the water when freezing is a possibility 
for more than a day or so. You use the bypass valve to bypass the solar 
collector and revert to normal operation.
 
 Too much heat can be a problem. The collector can burst if the water 
gets too hot. It’s best to drain the system when conditions are extremely 
hot and sunny.

246
Part III: Putting Alternative Energy Sources to Work for You 
 
 Drain valves need to be located outside (where there is safe drainage), 
and they may look exactly like hose faucets. You may want to consider 
some kind of locking valve that requires a key to open. Whatever you do, 
make sure children can’t open them and get scalded.
 
 The tempering valve, which prevents scalding water from entering your 
household plumbing system, is critical. It mixes cold water with the 
heated water from the collector when the collector water exceeds a cer-
tain temperature.
 
 You can always find out how hot the water in the collector is by sam-
pling from the downstream drain valve. Another good idea is to install 
an in-line thermometer.
 
 A full collector can weigh upwards of 500 pounds. Even empty, it weighs 
a lot. So give some serious consideration to how you will lift the collec-
tor up onto your roof or wherever you plan on mounting it. (Roofing 
companies have cranes for lifting heavy weights; you may need to 
hire one for an hour.) And make sure your roof can support the weight 
when the collector is full. You don’t want to find out the hard way that 
it can’t.
A drainback system
A drainback system is an indirect, active, closed-loop system. It’s indirect 
in that the liquid being heated in the collector is not the water that you 
actually use in your home; the heat is transferred via a heat exchanger that 
moves the heat from the collector liquid to the household water supply. It’s 
active in that it includes an in-line pump. Figure 16-2 illustrates this type of 
system.
Although much more expensive to install than ICS systems, drainback sys-
tems are an excellent choice for most climates, except those that receive a 
lot of snow and get very cold. They’re the best choice in hot climates. The 
advantage is that the danger of freezing is minimal.
 
Drainback systems are designed so that the fluid drains by force of gravity. 
Sometimes pipes sag and the low points retain some water, which can burst 
the pipes during freezing weather. To avoid such a scenario, make sure to 
adhere to the installation guidelines.
In a drainback system, a controller reads the two temperature sensors and 
then determines when fluid should be pumped through the collector. When 
the pump is turned off, the fluid in the collector and feeder pipes drains back 
into the drainback tank (such a clever name).

Most manufacturers offer complete kits that tell you everything you need to 
know about these systems and that work very well — if you stick with the 
plan. Following are a few facts worth knowing about drainback systems:
 
 You can use fluids other than water in the closed-loop heat exchanger 
circuit, but water is best because it’s cheap and doesn’t degrade when it 
gets hot.
 
 To eliminate the risk of freezing pipes, you must mount the pipes so 
that they all have a slope and mount the collector so that it drains com-
pletely, too.
 
 Copper pipe with a minimum diameter of 3⁄4" works best.
 
 The pumps consume energy, thereby decreasing efficiency. However, 
if you use a PV cell (see the later section “Solar PV Systems: King of the 
Energy-Efficiency Hill” for details), this isn’t an issue.
A closed-loop anti-freeze system
Closed-loop anti-freeze systems, shown in Figure 16-3, are far and away the 
most widely distributed type of system in the world because they work in 
almost any climate. Most new solar homes features closed-loop anti-freeze 
systems because they’re low risk and very effective. I would recommend 
them for most applications. Keep in mind, though, that they’re expensive and 
not entirely problem-free.

A special water heater tank incorporating a heat exchanger is used with one 
or more flat plate, roof-mounted collectors. Glycol, or some equivalent anti-
freeze fluid, fills the collector and routing pipes. A controller measures the 
temperature in the collector fluid, as well as the temperature in the hot water 
tank. When heat is available for transfer, pumps are activated to move the 
collector fluid.
A typical system costs around $5,500 installed (see Chapter 4 for details on 
the type of tax breaks and rebates you may qualify for), and complete kits are 
available. Although installation of the parts is no more difficult than for other 
systems, charging the closed loop can be tricky. If you don’t do it right, you 
can damage the system and get inefficient performance.
If you’re considering a closed-loop system, keep these things in mind:
 
 You can mount the flat plate collectors in almost any configuration. The 
closed loop is always full of fluid, so the pump pressure requirements 
are much less finicky than those of a drainback system (explained in the 
preceding section). In addition, the collector can be mounted at a great 
distance from the exchanger.
 
 The pump can be very small, with very little head pressure, translating 
to lower power and better efficiency. Running these types of pumps off a 
PV panel increases efficiency even more. (At night, when there’s no sun-
light to power the PV panel, there’s no hot water to be pumped anyway.)

249
 Chapter 16: Shining a Light on Solar Power for Your Home
 
 The major limitation is the tendency of the anti-freeze fluid to degrade 
over time, resulting in inefficiency and the buildup of deposits on the 
interior walls of the pipes and collector. Periodic servicing of the fluid is 
a must. Because injecting new fluid into the system has to be done just 
right, it usually needs to be done by a qualified serviceperson.
 
 The best way to prevent the fluid from overheating is to make sure the 
closed loop is circulating at all times when it’s sunny out. You can get 
scalding hot water in your domestic tank, and a tempering valve is critical.
 
 You need to use copper pipe because it’s the only material that can 
withstand very high temperatures.
 
 Make sure the copper pipe is well insulated if there’s a chance that chil-
dren might touch it. The pipe can get extremely hot.
Solar PV Systems: King of the 
Energy-Efficiency Hill
In one fell swoop you can completely offset your electric utility bill and gen-
erate zero pollution. Millions of photovoltaic (PV) systems are being installed 
all over the world, and the costs are decreasing due to economies of scale. 
But PV systems are not for everybody because they require a considerable 
upfront investment.
There are two basic types of systems: intertie, which work in conjunction 
with the utility grid, and stand-alone, which require batteries and other spe-
cial support hardware. Here, I focus on the intertie systems because they 
comprise the vast majority of installations.
Seeing the advantages of a PV system
The two biggest advantages of having a PV system are reducing pollution — 
you can literally erase over 40,000 pounds of carbon dioxide a year by going 
with a solar PV system — and saving money.
Net metering and why it’s sooo good
Net metering means that you can sell your excess power back to the utility 
company. Under most net-metering laws, utility companies must pay you the 
same retail rate they charge their own customers for power.

250
Part III: Putting Alternative Energy Sources to Work for You 
Net metering is great for PV system economics because every solar system, 
whether PV, water heating, or another type, has a certain maximum capacity. 
Maximum capacity depends on a number of things: the size of the system, 
the orientation and location of the solar collectors, and how much sunlight 
is available. On a cloudy day, system capacity is much less than on a sunny 
day. On a hot summer day, the capacity can be very large. The point is, solar 
systems don’t put out consistent power from minute to minute, day to day, 
or season to season. Some days you get way more than you need; other days, 
not so much.
With a PV system tied in to the grid (as opposed to a stand-alone system), 
you can use as much power as you need, and your PV system merely contrib-
utes whenever it can. Picture it like a bank. You put money in during the day, 
when the sun is shining, and then later on you can make withdrawals. What 
you don’t use is all sold back to the utility.
In some regions, solar PV is even more advantageous because the utilities 
have what’s called time-of-use (TOU) rate scheduling, where electricity rates 
are highest during peak usage time (from noon until 6 p.m.). The rate during 
this period can be over three times the rate at off-peak times. The timing is 
perfect for solar PV systems because they generate a majority of their power 
during peak time (remember, by law, the utilities must pay you the same rate 
they charge for power, so at peak time they must pay you peak rates).
 
Solar PV is an investment tool, but you must change your power usage habits 
in order to capitalize on the advantage. The harder you work your investment, 
the better it pays off.
Government subsidies
Government has a vested interest in promoting solar power because of its 
overwhelmingly positive environmental impact, as well as the desirable 
political impact of energy independence. The best way to promote solar 
power is to get more people to invest in it, and the best way to do that is to 
subsidize it. Subsidies, rebates, and tax breaks are widespread and becoming 
more prevalent with each passing day. In some parts of the country, the total 
discount on a system can be over 50 percent.
Protecting yourself against future rate increases
All investments require you to predict the future. If you think energy costs are 
going to rise quite a bit, solar energy is a very wise option. Your power bills 
won’t increase no matter how much energy costs rise. This is a very powerful 
form of portfolio management called hedging, where you not only get a good 
return on your investment but also ensure that regardless of what happens in 
the future, your investment will still pay off. In fact, the more energy costs rise, 
the better your original investment in solar will turn out to be.

251
 Chapter 16: Shining a Light on Solar Power for Your Home
When energy costs rise, those with solar power will still be able to use the 
same amount of energy. Those without will be scrambling to conserve or to 
buy solar equipment (which makes yours more valuable). You ensure not 
only financial security but also lifestyle security when you invest in solar 
energy.
Increasing property values
Your property value can increase by more than the cost of your original solar 
PV investment. Not only will you save on monthly power bills, but you’ll see 
an almost immediate appreciation in your home, in many cases, equal to or 
greater than the cost of your equipment.
Understanding the basic parts 
of every solar PV system
An intertie solar PV system, shown in Figure 16-4, is actually very simple, 
despite its high cost. The collectors collect sunlight and convert it into a raw 
electrical signal. Wires transmit this signal down to the inverter, which con-
verts (why it isn’t called a converter is beyond me) the power to 110VAC that 
is useable in your home. The meter is used so the power company can ding 
you, of course. And switches are there for safety purposes. The following 
sections explain the important parts of a solar PV system.

Ground-mounted systems are more expensive than roof-mounted systems 
because they require concrete posts and special frames. On the other hand, 
you can orient the panels any way you want, so the extra cost may be offset 
by increased production.
 
Install a smaller system than you think you need, and allow for the possibil-
ity of future expansion by buying an inverter big enough to accommodate the 
panels you may add in the future.
PV panels
PV panels, which comprise about 60 percent of the system’s cost, are the 
single biggest expense. They take up the most space as well. For most users, 
finding the space for the panels is the hardest part of the investment because 
it’s critical that they get a lot of sunshine. This depends quite a bit on the ori-
entation of your roof.
Different types of panels are finding their way onto the market. The technolo-
gies aren’t important to you, but the configurations may be. Some panels are 
flexible, and some can be mounted directly over tiled roofs. Some panels are 
being made into roofing shingles. Most of the new technologies are going to 
need some maturation to compete with the tried-and-true flat panels. It’s best 
to avoid new technologies until they’ve proven themselves.
Be sure to check the warranty and the manufacturer’s reputation and longev-
ity. Most PV panel warranties are for 20 years, but beware: Panels degrade 
over time. System warranties specify a percentage of original power output 
over time, say, 80 percent after 20 years. Inevitably, your system will put out 
less and less energy.
Inverters
Inverters are the next biggest expense. Inverters take the low-voltage, high-
current signals from the PV panels and invert them into 120VAC, which is 
directly compatible with grid power. Inverters cost around 50 cents per watt, 
or around $2,500 for a typical installation. Options include monitoring func-
tions, safety features, expandability ports, and so on. The most popular fea-
ture is a digital display that tells you exactly how much power your system 
is producing.
Disconnect switches and more
Disconnect switches are of critical importance and need to be mounted 
within easy reach. Every member of your family should know exactly how 
to turn the PV system off for safety reasons. Power meters are usually pro-
vided by the utility company when they come to your house to inspect 
your system and connect it to the grid. Wiring, conduit, and connections 

253
 Chapter 16: Shining a Light on Solar Power for Your Home
to your household’s main fuse box are minor expenses, but comprise a big 
chunk of the labor for installation. You want the installers to hide the con-
duits, if they can.
Getting the PV system installed
The installation of a PV system involves the following steps:
 
1. Perform an energy audit.
 
 Some states require an energy audit before you can buy a solar system. 
California is making this a requirement if you want to collect their siz-
able rebate. Why? It’s not really in the interest of your contractor to 
help you reduce your power consumption before you buy a PV system 
because that means they’ll be selling you a smaller system. But the pay-
back is much better if you save money by conserving prior to buying a 
big PV system. The cheapest energy is that which you never use. Plus, 
using as little power as possible is in society’s best interest.
 
2. Decide on a PV system and how to finance it.
 
 You must collect cost and performance estimates for PV systems, 
including the following:
 
• PV system costs, lifetimes, expansion potentials, warranty, and 
so on. The best bet is to call contractors and have a preliminary 
conversation about these issues. They’re familiar with all the 
rebates, subsidies, and tax credits available because they help 
them sell systems.
 
• The physical setup. How much roof space will a system take up? 
Do you have a suitable roof, facing approximately south? What 
condition is your roof in? Will any work need to be done before 
you install the system?
 
• Rate structures. Find out which structures you qualify for once 
the equipment is in place. Your current structure may not be appli-
cable anymore, and you may have options to choose from. Can 
you change structures later, if you don’t like the one you’re in? Can 
your utility company change structures on you later? You could 
find yourself in a real bind if you install a system under a certain 
rate structure, only to get a nice letter from your utility informing 
you that they’re changing your status.
 
• What is the payment schedule for the investment? You usually have 
to make a down payment (typically $1,000) at contract signing. Then 
you pay approximately half the remaining balance at the beginning 
of the installation, and the other half after the system is in place.
 
• What are your financing options and costs?

254
Part III: Putting Alternative Energy Sources to Work for You 
 
3. Choose a contractor.
 
 Talk to as many contractors as you can. Get them to come to your home 
and look at your situation in some detail (they can’t give you an accu-
rate quote until they do; any phone quotes are only approximations).
 
4. Review the contract.
 
 After you choose the contractor, a contract will be written up. Be sure to 
pay attention to the following:
 
• What guarantees are included in the contract?
 
• Exactly what are you buying? A pile of installed hardware, or a 
system guarantee?
 
• Under what conditions is the contract voided?
 
• Can you pull out? You usually have three days to change your 
mind — if they don’t tell you this, ask.
 
5. Wait for approvals from the county building department and any sub-
sidizing agencies to begin installation.
 
 Expect this to take up to six weeks or more.
 
6. Have the system installed (and inspected).
 
 Installations typically take a couple of days. The county inspectors will look 
at your system and certify it. The utility company is very concerned with 
your system because you will be feeding potentially dangerous power back 
into their grid. If utility employees are working on the grid nearby and your 
system isn’t working properly, they could get a nasty shock.
 
7. Have the utility company come out with a meter and connect you to 
the grid.
 
 When everything is ready, the utility company will install a new power 
meter and officially hook you up. Now you’re in the power-generating 
business, and you can brag to all your friends.
 
8. Bone up on how to operate your system.
 
 Your contractor needs to walk you through the entire system and 
explain the hazards and proper operation. You should be aware of 
potential problems and how to identify them. At this point, you can 
watch the display on your inverter cranking out numbers. Your contrac-
tor should explain exactly what the numbers mean.
 
9. Submit paperwork for final rebate payments, if necessary.
 
 Rebates are not payable until the system is in place and working properly. 
If your contractor is receiving the rebate directly, you don’t need to do 
anything. If you’re receiving it, you will want to get it as fast as you can.

255
 Chapter 16: Shining a Light on Solar Power for Your Home
Powering Pumps and Motors Directly
PV panels can be used to directly power DC electrical motors (no batteries 
required). If you don’t have access to electricity, this can be very useful. If you 
simply want to cut back on pollution, this is a good way to make a contribution.
Supplying water with a solar pump
Solar water pumps can be located anywhere sunshine is available. All water 
pumping systems include a few basic components (see Figure 16-5):
 
 A reservoir: If you want to run water to your house, the storage reser-
voir should be located above the house so that when a tap is opened, 
gravity provides the water pressure to the faucets.
 
 A faucet: Crank the handle, get water.
 
 A switch: To turn the system off and on. If there is no water to be 
pumped, you don’t want to run the pump dry or it will burn up.
 
 A submersible DC pump: A submersible pump goes down into the water 
supply and has the advantage that it is always primed, that is full of 
water. (Without the water, the pump would burn out.)
 
 A water supply: The water supply can be a well or a creek/river, lake, or 
other body of water.

Part III: Putting Alternative Energy Sources to Work for You 
In order to specify system size, you need to make the following calculations:
 
 Daily water usage, in gallons. Calculate both average and maximum usage.
 
 Available sunshine, in average hours per day. If having water avail-
able at all times isn’t critical (that is, if you can tolerate a few days of 
drought), the reservoir may be smaller. If you need water all the time 
and sunshine is inconsistent, you need a larger reservoir, along with 
larger PV modules so you can fill the reservoir on sunny days.
 
 Difference in vertical height between the top level of the water source 
and the output end of the pump hose. This number is called the pump’s 
head pressure.
Considering a solar pool pump
Swimming pool solar-powered pumps are expensive upfront, but once 
installed, you never have to pay another cent to power your pool pump. 
Conventional pool pumps, on the other hand, are relatively inexpensive 
upfront, but they cost a lot to run. In particular, if you have a solar swim-
ming pool heating system and a large-scale solar PV system on a TOU rate 
structure, running a conventional pump system in the afternoon, when the 
sunlight is available for heat (you have to run a pool heating system in the 
afternoon; otherwise, it won’t provide any heat), is very expensive. In the 
long term, you’re better off with a solar pump system.
The more sunshine you get, the more the pool pump runs. This works nicely 
because pool utilization hours are usually determined by the amount of sun-
shine as well.
Using Wind and Water for Solar Power
Like solar collectors, windmills and hydropower generators are powered by 
the sun, but in an indirect manner. Windmills and hydropower generators 
both generate voltages with spinning turbines. The concept is very simple. 
When you apply a power source to an electric motor, the shaft spins. If you 
manually spin the shaft of an electric motor, on the other hand, its two wires 
will output power. The physics work in either direction. Turbines are simply 
electric motors run backwards. Inverters are required (just as with solar PV 
panels) to convert the raw voltages from the rotors into usable power.
Wind and water may be available at any time of day or night. Wind, however, 
can come and go from minute to minute. Water resources generally don’t 
vary much over the course of a day but they can vary over seasons. They’re 
also subject to droughts when no power may be available at all for extended 

257
 Chapter 16: Shining a Light on Solar Power for Your Home
periods. The good news is that you can get rebates and subsidies for wind 
and water power just as you can for PV systems and water heating systems. 
They’re all solar power and are grouped together in this regard.
Blowing with the wind
A wind turbine, shown in Figure 16-6, looks like a small airplane with a huge

The pros and cons of wind power
Wind power has several advantages. It can be generated anytime, day or night. 
Wind is available almost everywhere, in all climates. In many of the worst cli-
mates, it’s very powerful. In some locations, wind is virtually a constant (magni-
tudes may vary, but output is always available). Because wind speeds vary over 
terrain, you can find locations on your property that provide maximum poten-
tial. Ridge lines, coastlines, and the tops of barren hills are the best candidates.
Wind power has its disadvantages, too:
 
 Extremely high wind conditions may destroy or damage a unit (turbines 
need a minimum amount of wind to begin working, but they don’t need a 
tornado).
 
 Obstructions like trees, houses, barns, and so on all affect wind speed. 
And because wind direction varies, obstructions in one direction may 
or may not be important in other directions. The best bet is to stay 
well away from all obstructions, although this may not be possible. And 
finally, precisely because wind is variable, you definitely need batteries.

 Mounting is a bear. In general, the higher the unit, the more capacity it 
will output. A height of 100' is considered optimum, and that’s a long 
way up there. The mounting must have a tremendous amount of integ-
rity because of the torques that need to be withstood.
 
 The installation is the tricky part. Hire a pro. If you don’t know what 
you’re doing, you could literally be killed trying to install a wind turbine.
 
 Rotors are noisy and obtrusive when they’re spinning. The bigger the 
blades, the more power they generate and the noisier they are. They also 
attract a lot of visual attention and may clutter up a placid environment.
Available sizes and cost
The smallest turbines (6' rotors) sell for around $1,000, not including instal-
lation (tower building and raising, wiring, and so on). They output 400 watts 
of power at 28 mph (this is a pretty good wind) and can withstand winds up 
to 110 mph. You can use these numbers to get an idea of how many kWh per 
day you can expect, on average; then you can devise a battery bank accord-
ingly. A turbine with a 15' rotor produces 3.2 kW at 28 mph for around $8,000, 
including installation.
Tower costs vary depending on height, but a typical tower kit for a small tur-
bine with a height of 50' runs around $700. The higher up, the more effective; 
but the higher up, the more expensive as well.
Using water for your power needs
A hydropower system is basically the same as a wind system, except the tur-
bine is spun by water pressure instead of air movement. There are two basic 
kinds of hydropower systems; submersible systems, which are inserted down 
into moving water such as a river or a creek, and stationary systems, which 
use water pressure. Hydropower dams are all stationary systems; the deeper 
the dam, the higher the pressure and the more power available).
Consider these things if you’re interested in water power:
 
 You don’t need batteries (although they do make the system work 
better). You can assume your hydro generator output will be pretty 
constant, at least from hour to hour. Over the course of a year, you may 
have major variations.
 
 You can install a water system of virtually any size power output if your 
water source is big enough. If your water source is small, power outputs 
will fluctuate quite a bit and may be zero for extended periods or during 
droughts.

259
 Chapter 16: Shining a Light on Solar Power for Your Home
 
 You can generate power day or night, in any weather (freezing may 
cause problems, but the right design can usually prevent this).
 
 Hydro systems have very long lives, are relatively trouble-free, and 
require very little maintenance. But the upfront costs are expensive, par-
ticularly for stationary water systems.
 
 Complex electrical system designs and mounting schemes are difficult 
with water pressures pushing all the time. This is not a trivial system 
design to tackle, although do-it-yourselfers can safely do it if they’re 
patient and willing to make multiple adjustments until the best arrange-
ment is finalized.
Heating Your Swimming Pool 
with a Solar System
Swimming pool heating is one of the most common uses of solar energy. The 
idea is simple: A solar collector is set out in the sunshine and the swimming 
pool filter pump system is used to move water through the collector and into 
the swimming pool. A minimal system can cost less than a few hundred dol-
lars and works reasonably well. The cost for an average full-up system (roof-
mounted) runs around $4,000. That’s a lot of money, but compared to using 
electricity or gas it’s a good investment because the energy is free, not to 
mention environmentally friendly.
Getting started with a simple setup
The simplest system for heating your swimming pool uses a single solar 
panel (see Figure 16-7). If you use a pool cover in conjunction with the solar 
panel, you can raise the pool temperature up to 15 degrees.
Your pool system already includes the pump, controller, and filter, along with 
PVC pipes that route the water flow. You simply break into the PVC line after 
the filter (never before), and run a couple of flex hoses (or PVC, if you prefer) 
to the solar collector panel, which can be laid out on the ground or set against 
a hill (or other support) to achieve some angular tilt toward the sun.
Solar collector panels are sold at most pool supply stores. You can get a 4' x 
20' panel for around $200. Flex hoses cost around $15 apiece. Adaptors are 
sometimes necessary.

Here are some tips to run the system for best results:
 
 Place the solar panel where it will get the most sunlight when the pool 
pump is running. The more sunshine, the more heat into the pool.
 
 Adjust the pump run time to match maximum sunlight conditions. 
Running the pump longer will result in more heat in the pool.
 
 You can use two or more solar panels. The best bet is to configure them 
in parallel, as shown in Figure 16-8. This configuration offers the water 
multiple channels, reducing the overall water pressure while heating the 
same amount of water.

Going the whole nine yards: 
A complete system
The entire system for a typical swimming pool solar system, shown in Figure 
16-9, includes quite a bit more than the simple starter system described in 
the preceding section. In addition to the parts that come standard with tra-
ditional pools (pump, filter, the pool itself, a bunch of screaming kids, and so 
on), it also has collectors to collect sunlight and convert it into heat, valves 
to control the flow of water and determine whether the pool system is using 
the solar heating components or is simply in bypass mode, and a motor valve 
that measures the temperature of the pool water and determines whether 
heat is needed or not (if the day is cloudy and cold, or it’s raining, it’s hardly 
worth expending the extra energy it takes to run the solar heater).

For these systems, the solar collectors are almost always mounted on your 
roof. A slight downward tilt is necessary to facilitate draining during the purge 
cycle. When the controller deactivates the motor valve, the vacuum breaker 
allows the system to purge itself of liquid. This is important for two reasons:
 
 You don’t want water in the collectors at night because it will cool down, 
and when you first activate the collectors the next day, you’ll dump cool 
water into your pool. This is obviously at odds with your goal.
 
 Purging the water ensures it won’t freeze up and burst the pipes or 
collector.
Manual drain valves are used to deactivate the system in off seasons or 
during maintenance. The check valve prevents water from flowing backwards 
through the pump and filter.
You can buy a complete kit if you want to install one of these systems your-
self. (Kits are always highly recommended, even if they cost a little more.)

Radiant Heating Systems
In This Chapter
 Understanding how radiant heat works
 Radiating heat through your floor for maximum comfort
 Working with masonry heaters
R
adiant heating can be much more efficient than conventional heating 
means, like forced air and stoves. Radiant implies not so much a method 
of generating heat as distributing that heat. You can use an electric heater, a 
gas heater, or geothermal or solar methods to equal effect with radiant heat 
systems. In this chapter, I go through the basics of radiant heating methods.
The most prevalent way to use radiant heating is through coils embedded 
into the floor. These can be either electric heating coils or narrow diameter 
tubes for the transmission of water or other liquids. The upfront costs of 
these systems are higher than conventional heating means, but the operating 
efficiency pays back in both increased comfort levels and lower energy costs.
Masonry heaters, which are very similar to stoves, have very high thermal 
masses, and their combustion chambers (usually for wood fuels) are very 
carefully controlled to achieve up to 90 percent efficiency. They work on the 
radiant heating premise, and I touch briefly on the pros and cons of heating 
your home with these heaters in this chapter as well.
Radiating Heat with Radiant 
Heat Systems
Radiant heat works by warming the surfaces in your home, as opposed to 
simply warming the air (as conventional heating systems do). The result is a 
much more stable and comfortable ambient:
 
 Radiant heat doesn’t use moving air, which has a cooling effect (see 
Chapter 8), to warm things up. For that reason, you feel warmer in a 
radiant heated room at the same temperature as a forced air heated 
room. Radiant heat is also more efficient because it doesn’t use big 
blowers (motors always take a lot of energy to run).

264
Part III: Putting Alternative Energy Sources to Work for You 
 
 Radiant heat doesn’t dry out the air. In fact, it doesn’t change the 
humidity of a home’s air. (Humid air feels warmer; dry air feels cooler.)
 
 The chimney effect isn’t as pronounced with radiant heat as it is with 
other forms of heat. A radiant heater generally releases heat near the 
floor (most new systems are actually installed in the floor), so the heat 
naturally rises up to the people in the room.
 
 Radiant heaters tend to heat everything in a room. When they’re 
installed in a floor, you can literally walk barefoot on a tile floor in the 
middle of the coldest winter day and still feel perfectly comfortable. 
Radiant heating is much more comfortable in general. People who have 
lived with radiant heat never want to go back, and they notice the dif-
ference in comfort quite a bit when they visit hotels or other people’s 
homes where forced air systems are operating.
 
 Radiant heat systems can achieve a greater warming effect with less 
energy than forced air heaters because the thermostat can be set 
lower. If you have a forced air heater, you have to offset the cooling 
effect of moving air by setting your thermostat a few degrees higher. 
This effect is real, not just a matter of perceived comfort. A radiant room 
can actually be a few degrees cooler and feel better at the same time. 
Obviously, this means you use less energy.
 
 With a radiant heat system, each room can have its own separate tem-
perature controller. You can shut entire portions of your home off from 
heat or turn unused rooms way down for big savings. And the tempera-
tures that you set in individual rooms will be very well maintained, in 
spite of weather conditions or any other variations.
 
 Radiant systems provide cleaner air quality, and they don’t use filters. 
They don’t blow air around and stir up dust.
The drawback of a radiant system is that it takes much more time to heat a 
room (by the same token, once the room is warmed it takes a lot longer to 
cool off). By contrast, when you come into a cold house and turn on your 
forced air system, you get immediate hot air. If you want, you can stand over 
the vent and warm yourself very quickly. Not so with radiant heat.
Old-Style Radiators
Many old buildings use radiators set up in the corner of each room. These 
are big, bulky, heavy metal grids through which hot water or steam is 
pumped. They get very hot, and they’re very noisy (clicking, sighing, groan-
ing, sizzling, and spitting). A big water boiler is located in the basement, and 
tons of pipes and plumbing components are required. Old time radiators are 
vestiges of the past and inefficient to boot because pipes always leak heat 
into the surrounding air.

265
 Chapter 17: Radiant Heating Systems
A number of outdoor boiler systems are very popular in remote areas that 
work well with these types of radiators, and they’re a cinch to install. I merely 
point out here that these systems are still available, and if you want to use 
them, you can get the equipment very cheaply (used, especially) and they 
work well. Note that I didn’t say great. If you’re really serious about using 
radiant heat, radiant heat floor systems are much better.
Radiant Heat Floor Systems
Radiant heat floor systems are probably the most common form of radiant heat 
used nowadays, for a number of good reasons. The idea is very simple. You heat 
your floor with a grid of coils installed underneath the floor (see Figure 17-1).
Types of radiant floor heaters: 
Electric or hydronic
Radiant heat floor systems can use either electric or hydronic (liquid) heat-
ing elements:
 
 Electric systems: Electric systems are not as efficient as hydronic ones, 
but they’re still more efficient than forced air electrical systems. Plus, a 
radiant heat electric system is much easier to install and maintain.
 
 Hydronic systems: With a hydronic system, you can use any number of 
sources for the heat. The most common source is a water heater that’s 
essentially the same as a domestic water heater. But solar heaters are 
also common, as are geothermal ones.
Thermal mass in the sunshine
You can effect radiant heat with solar power 
by building a sunroom or greenhouse. See 
Chapter 16 for more information, or check out 
Solar Power Your Home For Dummies (another 
Wiley book authored by yours truly) for a lot 
more details.
The idea is simple: Let the sun heat a thermal 
mass (like a concrete floor or a heavy barrel 
filled with water) during the day, and then at 
night let that heat radiate out into your living 
space. The effect can be very dramatic, and if 
you combine this with the fact that you also get 
some aesthetics, it’s worth looking into.
Overhangs (structures built over windows to 
control the amount of sunshine that enters 
at different times of the year) are particularly 
useful for modulating this effect. See Chapter 
12 for more details about overhangs and other 
solar exposure controls.

266

The more thermal mass in the floor, the better these systems work. So tile (or 
a similar product) is the best floor covering material. You can also use vinyl 
(make sure it’s rated for the application) and laminates. If you use wood, you 
need to be careful how it’s installed because the heating and cooling cycles 
will make the wood expand and contract. Float floors are the best bet for 
wood. Carpet also works, but it’s not as efficient at transferring the heat into 
the room, and you need to make sure that the carpet is rated for the applica-
tion (be sure to get the proper backing material).
Installation tips
Basically, a radiant heat floor system goes beneath the floor surface. You can 
build one up on an existing floor and then add a new layer of floor above the 
radiant elements, or you can remove the existing floor surface and start at 
the subfloor level.
 
Not all floor surfaces are conducive to radiant heating, so make sure to check 
at your floor dealer. Tile works the best, and vinyl is a no-no. Wood floors are 
alright, but they tend to expand and contract over time and this may cause 
warping. Most manufacturers will specify whether their floor surface works 
with radiant heating.

267
 Chapter 17: Radiant Heating Systems
 
If you’re a do-it-yourselfer, installing an electric system is much easier than 
installing a hydronic one. Not a lot can go wrong with an electric system, and 
if something does go wrong, it’s pretty easy to fix. With a hydronic system, a 
lot more can go wrong, and it’s often a bear to repair. Also, with a hydronic 
system, if you put the floor covering in place and something goes wrong, 
you’ve got a potential disaster on your hand when the liquid seeps out. This 
can be a real mess. Not so with an electric system.
 
If you’re remodeling and need a heater in a basement or an add-on room, 
using electric radiant heat in the floor can be very inexpensive compared to 
other options. When you’re adding space to your home’s interior that needs 
to be heated, you generally can’t just tap into the existing whole-house HVAC 
system because it was designed with a specific capacity in mind, namely the 
size of your existing home. Tapping in could render the whole-house system 
incapable of doing the job adequately. Your HVAC system may not be able 
to keep up on the coldest winter days, despite being perpetually on. You can 
install a radiant floor system without tapping into your existing HVAC and 
have a more comfortable, efficient room to boot.
Heating Up the Joint 
with Masonry Heaters
Masonry heaters are designed for very hot fires in their combustion chambers 
(typically over 1,300°F). The heat passes through a series of baffled chambers 
called heat exchangers, which draw the heat from the air and transfer it into a 
dense, solid material. The heat is then radiated slowly and passively into the 
living space of your home. The heat is just as slowly absorbed into the walls, 
floors, ceiling, furniture, and, eventually, into the people in the room. The ambi-
ence is very comfortable, and nearly everybody who has ever experienced a 
masonry heater’s effects swears by them.
Masonry heaters have a tremendous amount of mass, which in practical 
terms translates into very consistent, even performance. Even when doors 
are momentarily opened to the outdoors on a cold day, the home does not 
feel much different because it’s not so much the air that’s warm, but the 
entire home.
Although the initial costs of masonry heaters are high — expect a minimum 
of around $8,000, not including what it takes to beef up your foundation or 
chimney work — they’re very efficient. Efficiencies of masonry heaters can be 
up to 90 percent, which is truly impressive.
The following sections explain what you need to know about masonry heaters.

268
Part III: Putting Alternative Energy Sources to Work for You 
Like a conventional wood stove — but not
In some ways, masonry heaters are like wood stoves in that they burn wood 
and radiate heat. But there are important differences:
 
 Masonry heaters need to have their combustion cycle more carefully 
controlled than wood stoves do because the fire is so much hotter. 
Opening and closing doors is more critical. Except during fueling, the 
doors remain closed with most units. Some allow for the door to be 
open, but then the fire is more like a conventional fireplace and the effi-
ciency is diminished.
 
 The amount of heat a masonry heater generates is controlled by the 
amount of wood burned (not the amount of oxygen added to the burn 
chamber, as with conventional stoves). The burn temperature needs to 
be highly controlled, and varying the oxygen varies the temperature.
 
 You can use most any wood to good benefit — and less of it than you’d 
use in conventional stoves — because masonry heaters extract Btu 
extremely efficiently from the wood. (The fuel used in masonry heaters 
is thinner in diameter because more air circulation is needed between 
the pieces of wood).
 
 A masonry heater takes a long time to heat up to its steady state oper-
ating temperature. With conventional stoves, the heating effects take 
hold in just 15 minutes. But with a masonry heater, you need to plan 
ahead. If you come home from a few days away, your home won’t heat 
up for hours. On the other hand, you can go to bed at night when your 
masonry heater is working full bore, and when you wake up in the morn-
ing your home will be nearly the same temperature.
 
 Masonry heaters can be used in many locales where other types of 
stoves are banned due to air pollution. Because they burn wood so thor-
oughly, the pollution impact is minimal.
Despite all the ways masonry stoves differ from conventional stoves, they do 
share a few of the more irksome characteristics:
 
 You need a source of firewood (although some masonry heaters are 
coming onto the market now that use other fuel sources).
 
 Burning wood is labor intensive, regardless of how efficiently you do it.
 
 They tend to be dirty to operate. Around the unit you may notice a coat-
ing of soot (true with all wood stoves!)

269
 Chapter 17: Radiant Heating Systems
Installing masonry heaters
The biggest issue with masonry heater installation is the weight. These heat-
ers are too heavy for a single person to move into place. In fact, the larger 
units may take a forklift, which is why they should be installed while the 
home is being built. Some units come disassembled, which makes installa-
tion much easier (if you know how to assemble things, that is). In general, 
installing masonry heaters is similar to installing a heavy wood stove. Refer 
to Chapter 15 for more details on installing wood stoves, in particular, the 
chimney and venting requirements.
The biggest factor in terms of a masonry heater’s effectiveness is its location. 
It should be in the center of your home, preferably in a large room. If it’s not, 
you’re sacrificing potential efficiency. Masonry heaters work best in homes 
with open floor plans, where the heat can spread throughout the entire living 
space, slowly and evenly. In fact, most masonry heaters are installed in new 
home construction, where the home design is centered on the masonry 
heater.
 
You can’t put one on a floor unless it’s built to support a lot of weight. 
Masonry heaters have a tremendous amount of thermal mass, which trans-
lates into a lot of mass, period. Your existing fireplace pad may not be suitable 
for a masonry heater. Although you can install a masonry heater yourself, I 
wouldn’t advise it. Better to hire a contractor who knows all the ins and outs.
For more information about masonry heaters, go to the Masonry Heater 
Association’s Web site at www.mha-net.org. You can get kits, or you can 
find contractors who will do the whole job for you.

Heating with Biomass Stoves
In This Chapter
 Understanding the pros and cons of burning biomass
 Checking out the various stove and fuel options
 Plunging into the use of animal poop
B
iomass is a generic term for many different types of materials provided 
by Mother Nature. Strictly speaking, wood is biomass, and if you really 
want to get nitpicky, oil is probably biomass. For our purposes, I restrict 
the discussion to corn, wood pellets, leaves, and poop. These are the most 
common biomass products simply because the supply of raw materials are 
the most prevalent. You may find local biomass products that are cost effec-
tive in your own area, and not in others. Don’t despair, however. You can still 
get a good idea of the basic pros and cons of using biomass fuel by reading 
this chapter.
Using Biomass for Fuel
In a nutshell, biomass is organic material (plants and animal waste) used 
for fuel. Examples of commonly used biomass fuels are corn, wood pellets, 
straw, certain types of grasses, and autumn leaves. And, not to put too fine a 
point on it, poop is biomass, too.
Strictly speaking, wood is biomass. But in this book, I separate wood from 
other biomass products because most other sources treat wood and biomass 
as distinct entities, even though they aren’t. To help you avoid any confusion, 
I’m going to stick to that convention.

272
Part III: Putting Alternative Energy Sources to Work for You 
Here’s what you need to know about burning biomass:
 
 Biomass can be a very clean-burning fuel or a very dirty-burning fuel. 
Knowing what you’re doing is the key to success. Do it right, and you 
can burn biomass more cleanly than you can burn wood and most other 
options as well. Do it wrong, and burning biomass can create a lot more 
pollution than most other options.
 
 The market for biomass is completely different than the market for 
firewood. The decision on whether to burn wood or not is predicated 
largely on whether you have access to firewood (and on which types 
of wood supplies are in your area mainly because wood is expensive to 
transport across large distances). Many biomass products, on the other 
hand, are commonly transported long distances, so this same restriction 
doesn’t apply. Wood pellets, for example, come in compact bags that 
can be stacked on pallets and moved easily. Also, because the energy 
density is high, you get more bang for the buck.
 
 Biomass products, like wood pellets, are processed and bagged, and you 
generally take delivery of pallets with a forklift setting them down neatly 
into your storage area (unlike wood, which is usually quite a tangled 
mess; see Chapter 15). As a result of the processing and bagging, the 
energy density of most biomass products is much greater than wood, so 
you need less storage space.
Biomass is generally easier to work with than wood in terms of carrying the 
fuel from storage to the stove and loading your stove’s combustion chamber. 
Wood is usually very dirty to deal with, but biomass rarely is (unless you’re 
dealing with poop, which goes into a dimension beyond dirty).
Compost piles: Biomass at work
A compost pile is an example of biomass at work. 
You throw garbage and any old organics you 
have lying around into a special hopper, and the 
decomposition process creates heat by break-
ing down the materials. You can use the final 
product any number of ways, including fertilizing 
your landscaping and burning in a stove. For 
that matter, burning autumn leaves is a biomass 
combustion process (although it’s probably best 
to just call it “burning leaves” if you don’t want 
people to think you’re a nerd).

273
 Chapter 18: Heating with Biomass Stoves
Getting the Lowdown on Biomass Stoves
Biomass stoves and furnaces are designed to burn biomass fuels. In appear-
ance, biomass stoves are similar to wood stoves, and they transfer heat the 
same way. But biomass stoves are set up to burn at different temperatures 
and may require more or less oxygen in order to gain the highest efficiencies. 
Biomass stoves also come with hoppers that feed the raw materials into the 
fire; you can’t simply stack a pile of wood pellets and burn it the way you’d 
stack wood in a wood stove.
Biomass stoves are generally more efficient than wood-burning stoves 
because they take much less labor, and biomass combustion processes are 
well-controlled (like masonry heaters — see Chapter 17). Very little babysit-
ting is involved. These stoves have automatic augers that feed the fuel into 
the burn chamber. You simply load a very big hopper, and the fuel feeds 
down into the fire only as needed. You can control the feed rate by means 
of a thermostatically-controlled switch, and you can mount the thermostat 
either by the stove or in a remote location.
 
Just as with wood stoves, there are a large variety of biomass stove types, 
too many to cover in a single chapter, in fact. Your best bet is to research 
your local area to see what works best for your particular needs. Ask at stove 
shops, and if possible, find somebody who has a stove and ask about it (you’ll 
probably get a more honest answer this way than at the stove store).
Your decision on which type of biomass to use is generally dependent upon 
which types of biomass are available in your area. The Midwest favorite 
seems to be corn stoves. In the Northwest, you find a lot of pellet stoves (pel-
lets are made of byproducts of lumber processing, like bark, sawdust, twigs, 
and so forth). Economics of both equipment and fuel cost are the deciding 
factors. If you’re concerned with the environment, keep in mind that biomass 
is sustainable and less polluting than both electric power and fossil fuel 
power, so it’s a wise choice even if the cost is the same.
 
At some point, there will be more biomass stoves than wood stoves simply 
because the supply of good wood is going to dwindle, whereas biomass (espe-
cially poop) is literally everywhere. Processed biomass products can be made 
of so many different raw products, in virtually any state of quality, that they 
will overtake wood as the number one means of stove combustion.
You can buy a very cheap biomass-burning stove and get inefficient perfor-
mance, or you can spend a lot and get excellent convenience and efficiency. 
Regardless, burning biomass is almost always safer than burning firewood.

274
Part III: Putting Alternative Energy Sources to Work for You 
You can heat your entire home with a biomass furnace installed in your base-
ment. Or you can heat a single room. How you plan to use your stove deter-
mines the size and operation of your equipment. Well before you buy any 
stove, ask at the stove shop what your options are and then go home and con-
sider the details, as well as how you’ll implement them once you get going.
Burning Up with Pellet Stoves
The main operational advantage of pellet stoves is that they’re very easy to 
use. You fill the hopper with manufactured pellets and the rest of the process 
is largely automatic. A thermostat keeps the temperature at a preset point, 
and an auger feeds material into the combustion chamber so that you don’t 
have to worry about it. You can fill the hopper once a day or even less often 
if it’s not too cold out, and your home will stay at the set temperature. Pellet 
stoves can usually burn different types of materials as well, such as corn, coir 
fiber (from coconut husks), and nutshells. With very little work, you can get 
an even, consistent heat source.
Many types of pellets are made from byproducts of other lumber processing 
ventures, like sawdust and ground wood chips. Some pellets are even made from 
corn stalks (usually wasted since they have no nutritive value) and nut hulls, or 
from other crops like switchgrass. (Too bad they can’t make pellets out of politi-
cians, other purportedly organic entities with little or no intrinsic value.) Pellets 
are like recycled products, and even better for the environment because of it.
Outdoor boilers: The next worst thing
Outdoor boilers are a species of combustor 
appliances. As their name implies, these are 
positioned outside of your home and, as such, 
are exempt from Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) emission standards. When used 
properly, they work well. They’re inherently 
safer than stoves and other heating appliances 
that are located inside because if something 
goes wrong (either a fire or smoke hazard), it’s 
outdoors where it won’t matter (okay, maybe it 
will, but not as much, and maybe it will be the 
neighbor’s problem, not yours).
Outdoor boilers are advertised as capable of 
burning nearly any kind of fuel, and that’s true. 
You can even toss in some poop and it’ll burn, 
although you can only imagine what the smoke 
might smell like. But the real question is how 
efficient outdoor boilers are and how much they 
pollute. The simple fact that they work doesn’t 
mean they’re a good idea.
The efficiency and cleanliness of any combus-
tion process is a function of temperature and 
other controlled parameters, such as oxygen 
supply. Although an outdoor boiler may burn 
just about anything, as advertised, a jack of 
all trades is always a master of none. These 
devices rarely offer any kind of precision com-
bustion, so they take up far more fuel than 
they’re worth. You may save some money on 
upfront costs, but in the long run you’ll pay.

 Chapter 18: Heating with Biomass Stoves
In a nutshell, here are the advantages of burning pellets for heat:
 
 The operating costs are low. Pellets have a high energy density, and the 
stoves take very little power to run.
 
 Pellets are renewable and produce the lowest emissions of any solid 
fuel. Wood pellets, like wood (see Chapter 15), are neutral in terms of 
their effect on global warming because wood left to rot on the forest 
floor creates as much carbon dioxide as wood burned in a stove. And 
pellet combustion in a biomass stove is controlled much more accu-
rately than wood combustion in a wood stove, so the combustion is 
more thorough and the efficiencies are much better. In addition, most 
of the industrial companies that manufacture pellets replenish the trees 
they cut down to make pellets.
 
 If burned properly, pellets can be very clean and efficient. Smoke is 
minimal, and the burn is clean enough with pellet stoves that you often 
don’t need to vent the exhaust all the way up the chimney, so installa-
tion is easier and cheaper. There is also less creosote, which is safer for 
the home and cleaner for the environment. (No matter how cleanly pel-
lets burn, though, cleaning out the ashes is a filthy job.)
 
 Pellets are easy to store and handle. Pellet storage requires only 
around a third of the space that wood requires, so if you’re space is 
limited you may want to consider this option. Bags come in 40-pound 
sizes (and up, but you need to be burly enough to lift them). Another 
plus is stored pellets don’t attract the spiders that firewood does.
 
 Venting is easier with a pellet stove than with most other stove types. 
You need only a stainless steel vent pipe run to the great outdoors.
Growing trees the fast and furious way
Certain species of trees grow very fast, such 
as poplars and mulberries. In the future, there 
will be large farms and cooperatives that plant 
nothing but these types of trees and other fast-
growing biomass sources for use in heating.
This is an interesting environmental issue 
because Mother Nature doesn’t often favor 
the fastest-growing plants. They are not the 
strongest or heartiest, so there’s a certain anti-
Darwinian undertone in all this. Of course, the 
same may be said for the hyper-expansion of 
human presence enabled by vaccines and 
other technological advances. Perhaps when 
Mother Nature decides to eradicate the pesky 
human infestation she’ll also get rid of our bio-
engineered monstrosities as well.

276
Part III: Putting Alternative Energy Sources to Work for You 
Of course, pellet stoves also have a few disadvantages:
 
 Most stoves require electricity, although you can get battery-operated 
versions.
 
 Combustion gases pose a danger, as is the case with any burning process.
 
 Your insurance rates may increase when you install a stove of any 
kind in a preexisting home. Make sure to call and find out.
Burning, Not Popping, Corn
Corn is the second most popular biomass fuel because it’s so readily avail-
able in many parts of the country. To be effective in combustion, corn must 
be very dry (unlike the stuff you eat). Corn can also be very cheap and clean, 
if you have a ready supply of quality product.
Prices fluctuate across the country, and, as you would expect, corn is cheap-
est in the Midwest where it’s grown the most. (I grew up in the middle of 
Illinois, and corn was not only a fact of life, but in the late summer it was 
pretty much all of life.) You can buy dried corn directly from a farmer, or you 
can buy processed sacks of it that are easier and cleaner to handle (and a lot 
more expensive as well). If you’re a corn farmer, you can heat your home for 
nothing at all. And if you like to eat small rodents, you can get plenty of free 
meat in the deal.
Other grains also work in essentially the same fashion as corn. Wheat, barley, 
rye, sorghum, and soybeans can be dried and burned at low cost and with 
low environmental impact. As with corn, this is really a question of access. 
People in cities don’t burn soybeans simply because they can’t store soy-
beans and don’t have a ready supply.
The bright side of burning corn
Like other types of fuel burned in biomass stoves, corn can be a very consis-
tent heating source because the stoves use automatic feeds and large hop-
pers. It’s also very clean burning and low on the pollution scale. Burning corn 
and other grains offers these advantages as well:
 
 It’s the cheapest renewable fuel (at least for the time being). However, 
with the price of ethanol (which is made of corn) increasing, the cost of 
raw corn also increases. 
 
 Its environmental impact is very minimal. Corn grows fast and furious 
and is perhaps the best renewable energy source on the planet.

277
 Chapter 18: Heating with Biomass Stoves
 
 Simple venting requirements allow for inexpensive installations. A short 
stainless steel pipe run is sufficient, and this makes corn burning pos-
sible in many applications where wood burning is impossible.
 
 You can make whiskey out of the same corn that heats your home, and 
that has warming properties all its own.
The downside of burning corn
Burning corn creates some unique problems that non-corn burning home-
owners don’t face. If corn weren’t so cheap, not nearly as many homes would 
use it for heating, all things considered:
 
 Storing corn takes up more room than storing wood pellets because 
the energy content of corn isn’t quite as good as that of wood pellets. 
In other words, you have to burn more corn to get the same amount of 
heat that you’d get from pellets.
 
 Corn has a limited lifetime, unlike other fuels. It may rot, or rats may 
eat it before you can burn it — a problem you have to address proac-
tively or risk being overrun. Talk to somebody who has a corn stove or 
burns corn before you decide to take the leap. What you’ll hear is that, 
although you may be able to control the problem, you can never really 
eliminate it.
 
 Your home will have a sweet smell, not unlike popcorn. Whether this 
sounds like a good thing or a bad thing to you, people with corn stoves 
get used to the smell and seem to like it. (An alternative that avoids this 
olfactory dilemma is a big furnace in the basement, rather than a stove 
in the living space.)
 
 You have to buy a stove entirely dedicated to burning corn. In some 
regions, these stoves are very rare, and servicing can be hard to find.
Other Biomass Uses You Probably Aren’t 
Interested In (For Good Reason)
Horses and cows each produce from 10 to 16 metric tons of manure per year, 
depending upon pasture conditions and the amount of organic litter used for 
bedding. That’s a lot of manure. You can stack it clear up to the sky, if you’re 
so inclined. Compost a delectable stew by tossing in some garbage, waste 
straw, cane stalks, and pretty much any other organic material you can find, 
and what do you have? A rich mixture of dense fuel. In other words: Poop is 
biomass fuel. If you burn it right, you can get a lot of heat (this is not too dif-
ferent from the way English burn peat).

278
Part III: Putting Alternative Energy Sources to Work for You 
I do not include details on burning manure in this book, but I will tell you that 
you need a special burn chamber, and it needs to be stationed outside. You 
need heat exchangers and other equipment to bring the heat (and not the 
potential smell) into your home.
You also need processed poop (although, if push comes to shove, you can 
just toss some poop into an open fireplace and it’ll burn pretty well).
The joy of cooking: Making your own methane
You can convert cow manure into a very 
energy-dense gas by building a special fer-
mentation processor. The malodorous raw 
material is pumped into a digester silo where 
it is heated to 95°F, at which point fermenta-
tion is activated. Anaerobic microorganisms 
break down the organic matter to produce a 
gas that’s two-thirds methane and one-third 
carbon dioxide. The odor is similar to rotten 
eggs. The gas inflates a large plastic stor-
age bellows. Methane is drawn off into a 
combustion-powered generator to produce 
electricity, which can be used to power nearly 
anything. All you need is a big pile of cow poop, 
but that’s not hard if you have a bunch of cows. 
In fact, it’s unavoidable.

from Mother Nature
In This Chapter
 Understanding the pros and cons of geothermal heat pumps
 Evaluating air-source and ground-source heat pumps
O
ne of the cleanest and most efficient heating and cooling solutions 
comes straight from good old Mother Earth herself. You can use air, 
ground, and water as sources of heat rather than burning fuels or using elec-
tricity (which almost always derives from burning fossil fuels). Electricity is, 
in fact, dirtier than other energy sources because it’s so inefficient.
In this chapter, I give you a lowdown on how heat exchangers and heat 
pumps work; then I take you on a brief tour of how and why you may want to 
exploit geothermal sources of energy. In a nutshell, they’re one of the more 
expensive energy options in terms of initial investment, but in the long run, 
they’re cheaper because their operating costs are so low. At the very least, 
they pollute less compared to other options.
The (Very) Basics of Geothermal 
Heating and Cooling
The majority of heating in the modern world is done by means of combus-
tion. Gas heaters are combustion-driven, as are stoves of all kinds. Electrical 
power is used to drive a lot of HVAC systems, but ultimately that power is 
usually derived from fossil fuel combustion (although some electric power 
is nuclear, some is hydro, and so on, a majority is derived from combus-
tion). Geothermal energy, on the other hand, uses pumps and compressors 
to move heat from here to there. No combustion takes place, and no internal 

280
Part III: Putting Alternative Energy Sources to Work for You 
components get really hot, as opposed to electric furnaces, in which very hot 
grids transfer heat to the air moving over the grids. In addition, geothermal 
systems can save you between 30 and 70 percent on your monthly utility bills.
Seeing how geothermal energy works
Here’s how a geothermal system works: The temperatures three to four feet 
below ground stay pretty much the same all year long, unlike outdoor air 
temperatures, which can fluctuate a great deal. The temperature remains 
stable at this depth for a couple of reasons: First, the earth absorbs nearly 
half of all the heat energy that hits it from the sun. Second, heat from the 
earth’s core works its way toward the surface. The good news for you is that 
you can take advantage of this phenomenon with a geothermal ground-based 
system.
Geothermal ground-based systems circulate a water-based solution through a 
loop system that’s buried underground. With one piece of equipment (admit-
tedly complex) you can heat and cool your home and provide some or all 
your home’s hot water, too.
A geothermal air system, on the other hand, takes advantages of the fact that 
air, regardless of its temperature, still contains some heat. A “heat pump” 
simply moves heat from the outside environment into your home, or vice 
versa. This works in both directions; you can both heat and cool a home, 
using a geothermal system.
 
 During a heating cycle: In either ground- or air-based systems, the fluid 
circulates through the loop, extracting heat from the ground or air. Then 
this heat is sent to the geothermal unit, where it’s compressed and deliv-
ered to your home via your normal duct work or through a radiant heat-
ing system.
 
 During a cooling cycle: In a ground-based system, the heating process 
(explained in the preceding bulleted paragraph) is simply reversed: 
The unit removes heat from the home, circulates it through the ground 
where it’s cooled by the ground temperatures. For an air-based geother-
mal system, the unit exchanges the heat in your home for the lack of 
heat in the air, thus cooling things down. The air expelled from an air-
based heat pump can be much hotter than the ambient, outside air.
 
Don’t worry about where the heat comes from in the first place. The answer 
to the question “How do you get heat and cold where there is apparently 
none?” is pretty complicated, and to understand it, you need to know quite a 
bit about thermodynamics, a branch of physics that deals with the interaction 
between energy and work, and the laws associated with them. Even people 

281
 Chapter 19: Geothermal Energy: Straight from Mother Nature
who are really smart in physics and study it in the best colleges in the country 
don’t completely understand it, so don’t feel bad that you don’t either.
Looking at heat pumps
At the heart of geothermal processes are heat pumps, which basically move 
heat from one location to another. When you use a heat pump to generate 
heat, you move heat into the region where you want it (namely your home). 
When you use a heat pump to cool your home, you’re basically just moving 
the heat out of your home, into the great outdoors. Moving heat out is the 
same as cooling.
There are two distinct types of heat pumps: air-source and ground-source. 
They use the same basic equipment, but have different means of effecting the 
heat exchange. As a result, their practical operations are markedly different:
 
 Air-source heat pumps are the kind you see in stand-alone HVAC sys-
tems. They use ambient air to heat or cool a refrigerant contained in a 
compressor system. They are especially suitable in moderate climates, 
as they perform both heating and cooling functions with reasonably 
good efficiency.
 
 Ground-source heat pumps are very similar to air-source heat pumps, 
except they use the earth as their heat exchange medium. They are 
more efficient than air-source pumps because the earth is much more 
consistent in terms of temperature. Note: Geo-exchange is the common 
name for ground-source heat pumps. It’s just a matter of terminology, 
but you’ll see both terms (geo-exchange and ground-source heat pumps) 
in use. Look at the GeoExchange Web site: www.geoexchange.org for 
installers, equipment, and so on.
 
Water (lakes, streams, and so forth) can also be used as the exchange 
medium, but this is rare because water temperature changes more and water 
is harder to access than earth (plus very few people have a ready access to 
a suitable supply). Therefore, I don’t bother including information on water-
source heat pumps here.
The beauty of both air- and ground-source heat pumps is that they can work 
in reverse. They are capable of both heating and cooling because the process 
is essentially the same, except backwards. This makes for a more financially 
efficient investment in equipment.
Advantages of heat pumps
Heat pumps have their share of pros and cons. On the plus side, heat pumps 
tout the following characteristics:

282
Part III: Putting Alternative Energy Sources to Work for You 
 
 They offer steady, even heat and cooling. Fluctuations in temperature 
are fewer compared to traditional combustion equipment, and this 
increases comfort.
 
 They take up less space than traditional combustion equipment 
because of their two-for-one advantage (they can both heat and cool). 
Plus, there’s no need for a chimney or venting system because there’s 
no combustion (they still may use ductwork to distribute the heat, but 
radiant systems are more common because they are a natural partner). 
There aren’t any fuel storage requirements, either.
 
 They’re safer and cleaner than other options. They don’t create on-site 
air pollutants like smoke, carbon monoxide, and so forth. Nor do they 
create ashes or creosote. No combustion occurs, and none of the com-
ponents become extremely hot.
Disadvantages of heat pumps
On the downside, the following cons apply to heat pumps:
 
 They require more maintenance than some other options. Systems 
require a number of parts, and heat pumps are more complex that com-
bustion systems. If you look inside an air-source heat pump, you’ll see 
what looks like the space shuttle.
 
 They require electricity — sometimes a lot. This not only affects energy 
efficiency, depending on how you’re getting your electricity (nuclear 
source, combustion source, and so on) but it also means that in a power 
outage, you’re stuck.
 
 They’re slow to respond. They work best in steady-state conditions. If 
you come into a cold home and turn a heat pump on, it will take awhile 
for the house to heat up.
 
 Absolutely no romantic element is involved. Unless, of course, you 
love the high-tech complexity of the space shuttle.
Considering cost and payback
Heat pumps offer lower operating costs than most other options, and they 
can operate at efficiencies greater than 400 percent. This simply means that 
for each Btu of energy expended on moving heat from either land or air, four 
times more heat energy is extracted. This does not mean that the heat is free, 
however, and cost efficiency is the real question. Nor does it mean that pollu-
tion efficiency is better than it is with most other options.

283
 Chapter 19: Geothermal Energy: Straight from Mother Nature
After running the compressors and pumps and accounting for all the other 
inefficiencies that heat pumps entail, the overall efficiency is better than 
most heating processes, and this is why heat pumps are attractive. But the 
equipment is very expensive. Heat pumps are complex pieces of equipment 
with many more options for Murphy to exploit (unlike, say, fireplaces).
Deciding Whether an Air-Source 
Heat Pump Is Right for You
Air-source heat pumps are widely used in mild climates where the units don’t 
have to work inordinately hard. In very cold climates, you probably want a 
combustion heater that can crank out hordes of Btu in a short time. But if 
you’re in a mild climate, an air-source heat pump is probably one of your 
best choices. They connect to the existing ductwork, like any other heater 
or air-conditioner, and they accomplish both heating and cooling in the 
same package (refer to the earlier section “The (Very) Basics of Geothermal 
Heating and Cooling” for details). It’s rarely the case that an air-source heat 
pump is used with a radiant heating system, but it can be done if you decide 
it’s worth the extra cost (which it may very well be; see Chapter 17 for more 
details on radiant systems).
As you consider an air-source heat pump, keep these things in mind:
 
 The heat source, which is air, is free and limitless. No increase in energy 
costs will ever raise the price of air.
 
 Although air-source heat pumps require an expensive upfront invest-
ment in equipment, they’re the least expensive type of heat pump to 
install. And because installation is relatively easy, you can get a wider 
variety of qualified installers to give you a bid. Competition is always a 
good thing.
 
 Air-source heat pumps for a residential home cost more than other 
options for heating and cooling. The payback comes in terms of lower 
power bills.
 
 The technology is mature and getting better all the time. You can rest 
assured that if you get new equipment, the quality will be good in terms 
of both design and implementation.
 
 Air-source heat pumps are better for some climates than for others. If 
you live in a climate that requires heating and cooling in approximately 
equal amounts, an air-source heat pump is a viable option. If you need a 
lot more heating than cooling, a stove system is a better bet (with porta-
ble air conditioners, if need be). In moist, cold weather, air-source heat 

284
Part III: Putting Alternative Energy Sources to Work for You 
pumps don’t do very well and the efficiency suffers. You may need some 
backup heating means if the temperature is less than 10°F for more than 
eight hours.
 
 The best bet is to use a gas stove in conjunction with an air-source heat 
pump. The heating cycle of a heat pump is less efficient than the cool-
ing cycle, and a gas stove (or other type of stove) has the advantage of 
allowing you to heat locally. This is inherently more efficient than a heat 
pump that powers your entire home.
 
 Air-source heat pumps can be very noisy — fans make noise with most 
HVAC systems, but when you add the compressor you get some real 
rock ’n’ roll.
 
 Air-source heat pumps need abundant electricity. If your power goes off, 
you’re not heating or cooling.
Deciding Whether a Ground-Source 
Heat Pump Is Right for You
The effects of the seasons are nonexistent about six feet underground (I 
suppose this has some interesting implications for cemeteries). In northern 
states the ground stays at a consistent temperature of around 50°F, which 
is a lot warmer than the air aboveground in the winter months. In hotter cli-
mates, the ground can be as warm as 70°F year-round.
Ground-source heat pumps take advantage of the constant temperature 
within the earth to heat and cool your home. But the capability comes at a 
price: Expect your system to cost $8,000 to $15,000, and a lot more if your 
ground situation isn’t conducive. (By comparison, a conventional forced-air 
system costs around $7,000 for a typical home).
Ground-source heat pumps are very expensive because they require exten-
sive piping systems. These systems allow maximum contact with the earth 
that’s used for the heat exchange. You need some land to work with, and you 
need to be able to dig some complex wells or trenches.
The most common options are open- and closed-loop piping systems and ver-
tical and horizontal piping systems:

285
 Chapter 19: Geothermal Energy: Straight from Mother Nature
 
 Open- and closed-loop piping systems: An open-loop system, shown in 
Figure 19-1, uses existing ground water, while a closed-loop system has 
its own dedicated fluids and the heat is moved via exchange. Your con-
tractor can tell you which system is best for your area. In many areas, 
the ground water is pretty crummy (because of mud, minerals, salt, and 
other reasons) and therefore unsuitable for open-loop systems.
 
Figure 19-1: 
Open-loop

Discharge pipe

 Vertical and horizontal piping loop systems (shown in Figures 19-2 
and 19-3): Horizontal systems are easier to install but don’t work as well 
as vertical systems, which require deep holes very similar to those used 
for water wells. Horizontal systems also require a lot more land; if you’re 
pinched for space, you need to go vertical.
 
In general, the economics of using a ground-source heat pump are not good 
unless you use a lot of heating and cooling. If you’re in a climate that requires 
a lot of heating in the winter and a lot of cooling in the summer, then the 
amount you’ll save on your power bills will eventually pay back the very high 
initial cost of installing a system.

 Chapter 19: Geothermal Energy: Straight from Mother Nature
Choosing a design
The design and installation of the ground-source heat pump are very impor-
tant. The ground has to be suitable and the system itself has to conform 
to the availability of heat — you may need a much bigger system if your 
ground is not at the optimum temperature. Your main criterion for selecting 
a manufacturer and specific type of system should be performance. Look 
for the Energy Star seal, in particular. Also look for the Air-Conditioning and 
Refrigeration Institute (ARI) seal of approval.
 
Shy away from a new system that has not proven itself over time. It may sound 
great in theory, but then so did New Coke. There are already too many risks 
inherent in the proposition to bite into another that you don’t have to.
 
Ground-source heat pumps are better for new homes than existing homes. 
The systems are so extensive that retrofits are difficult, and you may end up 
making compromises that you don’t want to make.
Hiring a qualified installer
Not very many contractors are capable of installing these systems. So when it 
comes to hiring a contractor, make sure your contractor knows exactly what 
he or she is doing. If you can, use a contractor certified by the International 
Ground Source Heat Pump Association (IGSHPA — www.igshpa.okstate.
edu). And get references. Let me state this in stronger terms: If you have a 
problem with an air-source heat pump, it’s right there where you can get to 
it to work on; it can be worked on or even exchanged if things go really awry. 
The same can’t be said of an ground-source heat pump. With a ground-source 
system, once it’s in the ground, it’s nearly impossible to get to. If something goes 
wrong with your piping and the contractor who installed it has vamoosed, 
you’re in for a world of hurt. 
 
If you don’t have some competition in your area, watch out because you may 
end up paying not just a lot (the normal amount) but a whole heck of a lot. 
You may also end up with an unreliable source of servicing and maintenance. 
Many ground-source heat pump customers complain that they can’t get 
prompt service. If you don’t have a backup system for heating, this could be 
very problematic.
 
If your climate is very cold in the winter and mild in the summer, using a 
ground-sourced heat pump with a radiant heating system in your floor is 
a great combination because you can simply heat water directly, and this 
heated water is then pumped through the floor grid of the radiant system. You 
can also use that hot water generated by the ground-source heat pump in your 
domestic supply, thereby killing two birds with one stone (although killing 
birds is probably not strictly in sync with the green mantra). Radiant heat is 

288
Part III: Putting Alternative Energy Sources to Work for You 
very quiet, and in combination with the quiet ground-source heat pump, your 
home will be virtually silent and without moving air. (Note: If you use a forced-
air duct system, you need extra equipment — which costs more — to convert 
the hot water into hot air, as well as to move the hot air through the ducts.) Be 
aware, however, that using radiant heat in your floor doesn’t work very well 
for cooling in the summer.
Getting a rundown of pros and cons
While ground-source heat pumps offer some advantages, there are also quite 
a few disadvantages. Keep both in mind as you decide whether investing in 
one is right for you:
 
 The ground is always available as a heat source. It’s even more consis-
tent than air. But — and this is a biggie — ground-source heat pumps 
require specific ground characteristics, including water content, mineral 
content, iron content, and so on. A neighbor may have a ground-source 
heat pump in operation, but that doesn’t automatically mean you can do 
the same.
 
 Ground-source heat pumps are just as good at providing you with 
domestic hot water as providing you with heating and cooling. Most 
installations are a combination of functions, and this is smart efficiency 
planning.
 
 A ground-source heat pump is very expensive upfront, but once the 
system is installed and running, the operating costs are extremely low. In 
fact, ground-source heat pumps offer the lowest life-cycle cost of any heat-
ing system options, and this includes the expensive upfront investment.
 
 Pollution is extremely low, as is environmental impact. An added bonus 
is that ground-source systems make hardly any noise at all.
 
 If you want to completely ignore your system (a viable sentiment, so 
don’t deny it if you feel that way), you may want to look elsewhere. A 
ground-source heat pump needs routine maintenance, and you need to 
keep an eye on how your system is working because problems are usu-
ally subtle rather than catastrophic, at least initially. If you totally ignore 
your foundering system, it’ll get to the catastrophic point, and then you 
may as well just sign over your firstborn.
 
 If something goes wrong with your piping system after it’s in place, find-
ing the problem will be very difficult and very expensive to fix. And at 
the end of its life, the underground piping system basically needs to be 
torn out and redone in its entirety. This ain’t cheap.
 
 Ground-source heat pumps need electricity to operate. No electricity, no 
heating or cooling.

want to, you have a three options: buy one, build one, 
or convert one. Any of these options requires you to make

energy efficiency technologies are unproven.
In this part, I show you how to decide between buying an 
existing energy efficiency home or buying a conventional

inclined to build an energy efficient home from the ground 
up,  I show you what to look for in potential home sites

ifferent types of communities have different attributes that can make 
becoming energy efficient more or less accessible. With the interest in 
green living on the upsurge, many cities and states have taken steps to make 
themselves havens for environmentally conscious citizens. But maybe you 
don’t want to live in a community at all. Perhaps you want to join a commune 
or you’re interested in going off-grid, or back to nature. Each situation has

The best communities are those that dedicate their fundamental philoso-
phies to going green, and more and more of these are cropping up all the 
time. In this chapter, I review the ways that you can benefit from different 
types of community structures.
Checking Out the Characteristics 
of Green Communities
Green cities promote environmental policies geared toward making it easier 
for their citizens to be kind to Mother Nature. Public transportation is readily 
available, in order to reduce pollution, for example. In addition, subsidies and 
tax advantages are easy to get from cooperative city councils, and building 
departments demand certain energy efficiency features to be built into new 
homes and retrofits.

So how can you distinguish between truly green cities and posers? The char-
acteristics outlined in the following sections are indicators of municipalities 
that take energy efficiency and pollution reduction seriously.
 
Most newspapers are now available on the Internet. You can quickly check out 
a community by reviewing the real estate ads in its newspapers. If you find no 
mention whatsoever of parks, rivers, energy efficiency, and the like, you can 
conclude that the community in question doesn’t place much emphasis on 
green living. You can also get a good feel for how much homes are going for 
and how much you’ll have to pay each month to live in the community. Find 
out whether a good number of solar and/or energy-efficient homes exist in the 
community, and check out the difference in prices between these homes and 
conventional ones.
Air quality
In an effort to improve air quality, over 250 cities have committed to con-
forming to the Climate Protection Agreement, which encourages cities to 
reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 7 percent from 1990 levels. (For 
some cities, the reduction would be a lot more than 7 percent from current 
levels because the levels have been rising since 1990.) Some of the best cities 
include the following:
 
 San Francisco, California: California is one of the best states, with more 
conservation measures and actual mandated environmental standards 
than any other state in the country. San Francisco epitomizes how these 
measures can be implemented in a community.
 
 Portland, Oregon: Portland is very green. The city has a tremendous 
number of trees and supports energy-efficiency efforts at the household 
level. Community spirit is active, which helps a lot.
 
 Austin, Texas: The capitol city of Texas, Austin supports heightened 
awareness of green initiatives.
 
 Boulder, Colorado: Boulder has long been a leader in the green move-
ment, and the city’s historically environment-friendly infrastructure 
gives it a head start over most cities. Public transportation is very easy 
to access.
 
 Cincinnati, Ohio: Cincinnati has significant property tax abatements for 
all LEED certified buildings (Leadership in Energy and Environmental 
Design, a very important licensing agency for building design). This 
encourages sustainable development.

293
 Chapter 20: Looking at Community Solutions to Energy Efficiency 
Other cities that have outstanding records for encouraging clean air and 
water and widely available public parks and open areas are Eugene, Oregon; 
Chicago, Illinois; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Honolulu, Hawaii.
 
A list of the top 10 green cities is put out annually by National Geographic’s 
The Green Guide, which affords consumers information about a wide range of 
green issues. Check out www.thegreenguide.com.
The EPA maintains an Air Quality Index (www.airnow.gov) that assigns rela-
tive scores for ozone and particulate matter. Take these scores with a grain 
of salt, not because they don’t matter, but because they don’t give the whole 
story. Some cities with poor scores are endeavoring to improve their air qual-
ity with widespread public programs; focusing only on the score and not the 
direction the city is going can give you an incomplete picture. In fact, cities 
with poor air scores have more incentive to fund and sponsor improvements, 
so you may find that they offer more subsidies and support.
My hometown of Sacramento, California, has some of the worst air quality 
scores in the nation, yet California is the best state (at this writing) for pro-
moting and funding energy-efficiency investments, and Sacramento is home 
to an impressive number of energy-efficiency and solar companies.
Air quality is more important to some people than it is to others, and it varies 
over the course of a year. So use your judgment when reading the Air Quality 
Index numbers.
Public transportation
Commuting is a big factor in finding an energy-efficient community. An auto-
mobile driven 12,000 miles can easily emit more carbon dioxide per year than 
a comfortable home. In general, cities that take green living seriously provide 
good public transportation, which enables citizens to save a lot of energy on 
transport costs. Public transportation is also much less polluting than having 
thousands of cars on the road, so everybody’s air quality benefits.
Some cities, like Chicago, make public transportation easy and convenient 
across the board. You can literally go anywhere in Chicago by way of bus, 
train, or subway. But cities like Los Angeles have relatively nonexistent 
public transportation networks (aside from their world-famous cacophony of 
crowded freeways). You may or may not want to use public transportation, 
but the fact that it exists in a workable state says a lot about a city’s general 
attitude. Check a city’s public transportation by using it — or trying to, as the 
case may be.

294
Part IV: Considering Efficiency When You Buy, Build, or Sell a Home 
Utility structures
When you check a city’s utility structures, take the following into consideration:
 
 Where does the city get its energy? Is it nuclear? Derived from coal 
plants? Driven by hydropower?
 
 How much pollution per kWh does the city’s utility generate? The 
average number of pounds of carbon dioxide per kWh is 2. Anything less 
is good. Any community that gets power from a nuclear reactor will be 
way below the average.
 
 How much does power cost? The fact that power is expensive may be 
a good thing, even though it costs more. Expensive power means that 
efficiency investments are more cost-effective, and efficient homes are 
worth more because they’re cheaper to live in. And when power rates 
are high, the community is likely to be cleaner because less power is 
used.
 
 Is a tiered rate structure utilized? Tiered rate structures allow residents 
to use as much or as little power as they want, but the rates penalize 
profligacy.
At any rate, power rates are going to be rising for everybody, and there’s no 
telling how much. It’s impossible to get information on how utility rates may 
move in the future, but you can find out how much rates have risen in the 
past. If they’ve been consistently going up 10 percent per year, you can safely 
bet that they’ll keep moving the same way. On the other hand, if they haven’t 
risen at all, a massive increase may be in store.
 
Check out a community’s utility rates by going online to the Web sites of the 
various utilities. You can check the online yellow pages under “utilities” to 
find the names — and sometimes even the Web addresses — of a communi-
ty’s utilities. You can also check out www.sustainlane.us and www.eere.
energy.gov/greenpower for lists of cities that promote and subsidize the 
use of alternative energy.
Recycling programs
Check out a community’s recycling programs. Recycling is possible for 
any household, but it helps if your community has set up a formal regimen 
whereby recycling is centralized and encouraged. When this is the case, 
the costs of transportation and processing are borne equally by all citizens 
through utility bills. Recycling that makes financial sense is a much better bet.

295
 Chapter 20: Looking at Community Solutions to Energy Efficiency 
The better communities provide recycling containers that you set out on the 
street with your regular trash. The best provide different containers for dif-
ferent types of recycled materials — for instance, aluminum and metal, plas-
tics, newspapers, and boxes. Some communities even remove lawn clippings 
and organic refuse.
Water supply
A city’s water supply is critically important for a number of reasons. First, it 
must be pristine and clean. Otherwise, you’ll have to buy drinking water or a 
filter system. Some cities have grungy-tasting water, and even though it may 
not be harmful to your health, it still makes you feel grungy.
Second, some cities simply don’t have enough water. You can conserve, but 
if too many hands are reaching into the pie, costs are likely to rise, as is the 
amount of pressure to reduce usage even more. Consider whether a city is a 
candidate for severe droughts (most western cities are). Find out what hap-
pens when a drought occurs. If the city forbids watering lawns, for instance, 
you may have an expensive problem on your hands.
Find out whether the community has installed water meters. If so, home-
 owners are a lot more likely to use less water. In communities where water 
meters don’t exist, the people have absolutely no incentive to use less water.
Unfortunately, politics can enter into the equation. In California’s central 
valley, there is a constant tug of war between farmers and cities over who 
gets water rights. These water wars affect development, and the cost of 
homes rises because supply can’t meet demand.
Housing designs
Home designs in green communities are ultra-efficient, with solar exposures 
and strategically planted deciduous trees. Homes feature thick insulation, 
double-pane windows, window coverings, automatic awnings for hot summer 
days, solar attic vent systems to purge hot air from attic spaces, whole-house 
fans, and solar light tubes in all kitchens. Skylights are used as much as pos-
sible, along with passive solar heating and cooling arrangements.
Some communities specifically demand sustainable housing designs. The U.S. 
Green Building Council (USGBD) runs a program called Leadership in Energy 
and Environmental Design (LEED) that sets criteria for what constitutes 
green building. These criteria include things like

296
Part IV: Considering Efficiency When You Buy, Build, or Sell a Home 
 
 Insulation properties in the walls and ceilings.
 
 The design and placement of windows in a building (called fenestration), 
which affects not only the insulation properties but also the availability 
of solar lighting and heating.
 
 The type and operation of any HVAC systems.
 
 Use of water resources and on-site means for conserving water.
 
 Installation of any solar energy systems.
Visit www.energystar.gov (the ubiquitous Energy Star!) for a list of build-
ers familiar with the LEED tenets.
Miscellaneous factors
Check out a city’s parks by visiting them. Are they well maintained, indicating 
a laudable degree of civic pride? Or are they crime-ridden and dirty? Parks 
may very well be a metaphor for a city’s civic stance.
In Chapter 4, I address government incentives for energy-efficiency invest-
ments, which include rebates, subsidies, and tax deductions. Check state 
and local government’s Web sites for information regarding energy-efficiency 
issues. Most municipalities at least pay lip service to environmental issues, 
and some of them actually mean what they say.
This old house
One of the best ways to practice efficiency is 
to buy an old home and refurbish it. This takes 
far fewer resources than building a new home 
from scratch, and it saves a lot of infrastructure 
costs as well. Many cities are experiencing a 
renaissance in their older neighborhoods as 
younger families move into dilapidated homes 
and invest both time and money in refurbishing. 
Older architecture seems to offer a lot more 
character and charm than the newer, mass-
produced style of buildings. Nothing is as cool 
as an old brick wall in your living room.
The problem with a lot of older homes is that 
they have poor insulation (most have single-
pane glass windows) and failing plumbing 
and electrical systems. You may need to com-
pletely gut an old home in order to make it 
more energy-efficient. On the other hand, most 
older homes have open fireplaces, and you can 
install a newer, energy-efficient insert cheaply 
and easily. See Green Building & Remodeling 
For Dummies by Eric Corey Freed (Wiley) for 
more details.

297
 Chapter 20: Looking at Community Solutions to Energy Efficiency 
Roughing It by Going Off-Grid
Being off-grid means not being connected to a public utility for your electrical 
power. This also usually means that you’re not connected to gas, water, and 
sewer utilities. If you’re thinking about going off-grid, keep these things in 
mind:
 
 The cost of bringing utility power in is prohibitive. If you’re off the 
beaten path, you can usually get the utility company to bring power in, 
but you have to pay for the long line lengths and poles, trenches, and so 
on. This can sometimes cost over $100,000.
 
 You don’t have any utility power available, period. Going off-grid 
seems to be a romantic notion, but it’s not necessarily the most efficient 
way to go. If you don’t get much sunshine or have enough wind or water 
to make alternative energy sources viable, being efficient and pollution-
wise off-grid is very difficult.
Understanding your off-grid options
You have choices when you go off-grid. If you want to rough it, you can use 
propane. It works well for heating, cooking, and refrigeration. Wood stoves 
Urban sprawl: The bugaboo of modern society 
or the answer to mankind’s dreams?
Urban sprawl fragments wildlife and Mother 
Nature’s natural designs. Low-density hous-
ing developments take far more resources per 
dwelling than high-density city habitats. And 
the public transportation options are severely 
limited, meaning most people own cars and 
use them quite a bit. Infrastructure systems such 
as water, sewer, trash, and electricity all have 
to be stretched out, meaning more resources 
are required to deliver these services to 
customers.
Cities easily provide more opportunities for 
energy efficiency. High-rise housing affords 
no opportunity for landscaping and the water 
usage that goes along with it. Community 
housing structures have common walls, so 
the energy used per resident is lower. Water, 
sewer, and trash require fewer resources per 
resident. The list goes on.
The reality, however, is that people are con-
stantly leaving the dense housing of the cities 
for the more spacious lifestyles of the suburbs. 
The quality of life is often much better, and the 
elbow room is essential for certain types of 
mental health.

298
Part IV: Considering Efficiency When You Buy, Build, or Sell a Home 
are popular for remote houses and cabins because a supply of firewood is 
usually readily available. But at some point you’re going to want to plug in 
your television, and then your choices are more limited.
Gasoline- or natural gas-powered generators
Gasoline- or natural gas-powered generators are inexpensive and can put out 
a lot of power, when needed. But they’re noisy, cumbersome, and smelly, and 
they pollute quite a bit. If you’re out in the middle of nowhere, a gas genera-
tor is inherently contradictory to the peaceful coexistence you have chosen.
Off-grid solar power systems
Off-grid solar power systems (including hydropower, wind power, and PV 
systems) provide electrical power, but it’s relatively expensive. Using PV 
electrical generating systems connected to the grid (intertie) enables you 
to sell your excess generating capacity back to the utility and therefore 
use 100 percent of your system’s productive capacity (Chapter 16 has the 
details). Conversely, when you install an off-grid solar PV system, you don’t 
get anywhere near 100 percent utilization, plus you need batteries, charge 
controllers, and more. All this extra equipment is expensive and maintenance 
intensive.
From a pollution standpoint, using an intertie PV system does the world more 
good because more usable power is generated. Each kWh of energy you gen-
erate with an intertie system offsets that much energy from the grid — it’s 
a one-to-one relationship. This is not true of an off-grid system. A lot of the 
potential energy generation is wasted because it’s not used (if you’re on 
vacation, generating capacity is completely wasted). And batteries are inef-
ficient, so you waste energy in that regard as well.
 
Stand-alone systems are generally subject to rebates and subsidies, just like 
intertie PV systems and hot water systems. See Chapter 4 for details on how 
to research this subject.
Realizing the ramifications 
of going off-grid
Going off-grid takes commitment and knowledge. You need to understand 
what you’re doing with an off-grid system; you can’t just plug and play. So 
before you sign on, give careful consideration to the following facts:

299
 Chapter 20: Looking at Community Solutions to Energy Efficiency 
 
 Going off-grid takes work. It means you have to take care of batteries, 
monitor system performance, and adjust your habits on a daily basis, 
depending on how much power your system is generating.
 
 Going off-grid is expensive. In general, off-grid PV systems cost at least 
twice as much per kWh as intertie systems and take ten times more 
attention on your part.
 
 You have to deal with the spent batteries. No big deal, you think? Think 
again. Batteries are disposable waste nightmares because they’re so 
full of nasty chemicals. Carbon dioxide is an important pollution culprit 
these days, but it’s not the only one. Ground water pollution is a grow-
ing problem. Waste management is expensive and increases everybody’s 
tax burden. If you aren’t very savvy with your batteries, their lifetimes 
can be atrocious. So the pollution problem is increased not only by the 
mere use of batteries, but even more so by ignorant use of batteries.
 
 Conservation measures are required with off-grid systems. Although 
conservation is integral to the beginning of any efficient lifestyle, it’s 
even more important with off-grid systems because the economics dic-
tate it. The best way to start is by building an energy-conserving house, 
with maximization of solar potential (see Chapter 21). Efficient appli-
ances and personal habits are also a must.
 
 Most banks will not touch an off-grid home. You may not be able to get 
a first mortgage, and second mortgages are even more prohibitive. If you 
ever want to sell your house, being off-grid will drive away 99 percent of 
potential buyers, and the higher cost of a mortgage, if one is even avail-
able, will be reflected in a lower selling price. If you have a choice, being 
off-grid is not an investment at all — it’s a discretionary luxury.

f you can do it, starting from scratch is the best possible way to go with an 
energy-efficient home. You have the world at your fingertips, and you can 
design your new home to your heart’s content. You can buy energy-efficient 
appliances and light fixtures, and you can install an energy-efficient HVAC 
system, including geothermal or solar power.
If you think you can’t afford it, keep in mind that building an energy-efficient 
home costs no more than building a conventional home. Add the fact that 
your energy bills will be dramatically lower, and a “green” home can actually 
costs less on a monthly cash-flow basis.
But building from scratch is also a demanding process, full of unanticipated 
surprises — some good, some bad. (To get an idea of the difficulties as well 
as the rewards, read Building Your Own Home For Dummies, by Kevin Daum, 
Janice Brewster and Peter Economy [Wiley].) This chapter gives you the basic 
information about building an energy-efficient home from the ground up so 
that you know what to look for, what to think about, and what to expect.
Picking a Spot for Your New Home
Perhaps the most fun part of building your own home is choosing a building 
lot. You probably already know the region or city you’re going to be building 
in. You may even have narrowed it down to a particular neighborhood. As 

302
Part IV: Considering Efficiency When You Buy, Build, or Sell a Home 
you scope out possible home sites for your energy-efficient home, remember 
that location means more than just a nice neighborhood. All the things you’d 
consider if you were building a traditional home still apply — neighborhood, 
landscaping, size of lot, and so on — but you need to be aware of a few other 
factors, too, as the following sections explain.
Evaluating local building 
codes and regulations
As you consider various locations for building an energy-efficient home, you 
need to find out whether the local building codes support such a project in 
the first place. Unfortunately, some communities are behind the times and 
don’t have laws and codes that are accommodating. Here’s how to get the 
information you need.
Contacting the local building department
Contact the local building department at the county headquarters and dis-
cuss your plans with a representative to find out exactly where this com-
munity stands. Some go out of their way to be supportive and charge smaller 
fees for energy-efficient homes; some can supply you with the names of local 
builders that can help you out; and some even subsidize energy-efficient 
homes.
While you’re at it, get a feel for how onerous and expensive the building pro-
cess is going to be:
 
 Ask whether energy-efficient homes have been built in your area and in 
your particular neighborhood.
 
 Ask how much fees and permits will cost — you may be shocked to hear 
the answer. Some communities want to restrict growth, and one of the 
ways they do this is by charging astronomical fees for new homes. If this 
is the case, you may want to consider another community or consider 
buying an existing home and converting it into an energy-efficient home.
Contacting the local homeowners’ association
Contact the local homeowners’ association or read through its charter. Many 
local association bylaws contain bans against solar panels because they’re 
ugly. Even though these restrictions are probably illegal, you may want to 
abide by rules against having solar panels in public view by orienting your 
house so that the panels face south but are not visible from the street. This 
requires the front of your home to face north.

303
 Chapter 21: Building an Energy-Efficient Home from the Ground Up
I know of one installation where the homeowners decided to put the solar 
panels off to the side of their house so that they wouldn’t be able to see 
them, but their neighbors could. A neighbor sued and was joined by the 
homeowners’ association on the general grounds of violating the “visual 
appearance” clause. The association won because the judge found that the 
homeowner himself was declaring the panels visual blights by the mere fact 
that he didn’t want to look at them. Everybody lost a lot of money — even the 
winners — and that’s the bottom line. When it comes to rules, work within 
them, and don’t be stubborn.
Talking to experienced local contractors and other homeowners
Find local contractors with experience building energy-efficient homes. 
They’ll be able to answer a lot of your questions very accurately and may be 
able to show you energy-efficient homes that they’ve built, giving you good 
ideas for your own home. You may also be able to talk to the homeowners. 
Real-life experience is ten times better than anybody’s theory.
Measuring the energy-efficiency 
potential of a lot
A key characteristic of energy-efficient homes is that they use solar power 
(which also encompasses water power, wind power, breezes, landscaping, 
thermal mass, and so on) as much as possible, particularly the passive com-
ponents like lighting and ventilation. You have to be a lot fussier about your 
lot when you build a solar home, not only because you may use domestic hot 
water supplements (refer to Chapter 16), but also because the solar philoso-
phy relies heavily on natural lighting and heating capacities. (See my book 
Solar Power Your Home For Dummies, published by Wiley, for more details.)
With solar power, orientation becomes a critical factor. You want to choose 
a building site that lets you orient your house with a good southern exposure 
for PV panels and water heating collectors, as well as for windows, sunrooms, 
and living spaces. On some lots, this is very difficult because of the street ori-
entation and the location of trees and other shade-makers.
As you scope out building sites, ask yourself the questions posed in the fol-
lowing sections. The answers let you get to the heart of just how appropriate 
a particular lot is for your energy-efficient building plans.
 
Keep notes on how each possible building site stacks up. For each site you 
evaluate, jot down the answers to the questions outlined in the following sec-
tions. If you keep your comparative analyses of the various location options 
consistent, you’ll have an easy reference to help you make your final decision.

304
Part IV: Considering Efficiency When You Buy, Build, or Sell a Home 
What are your solar exposures?
Solar exposure is key to energy-efficient construction. What latitude are you 
in? What is the sun’s path over the course of a year at that latitude?
For each site, stand in the middle of the lot and plot the sun’s course. (You 
may have to do some guesswork about what the situation will be from a roof-
top or a porch that hasn’t been built yet.) Different spots on a lot have differ-
ent solar exposures and different shading issues. Look for deciduous trees 
and try to envision your house with those trees on the southern exposure, 
but not shading solar collectors on the roof. Try to avoid cutting down trees. 
Although you can plant trees, they won’t rival natural, healthy, indigenous 
trees for a long time.
What are the prevailing winds like?
Prevailing winds are critical (see Chapter 13 for ventilation and cooling 
issues). Natural breezes are absolutely free and can make a major difference 
in the comfort of a home. Look for locations where breezes are magnified in 
the summer by hills and terrain. In the winter, you want natural brush and 
landscaping to diminish cold winds from the north.
What’s the water situation?
Water rights and drainage are important. Try to find out whether any water 
problems exist; check with the county building department or the local water 
utility. The last thing you need is to move into your home and discover that 
the water supply is foundering. If city water isn’t available, do you need a 
well? If your neighbors have wells, are they producing? A well can be good or 
bad: You won’t have a water bill, but you’ll need expensive equipment, and 
you may need to filter the water.
You also need to determine the natural drainage of the property. Some loca-
tions for a home simply won’t work unless you radically alter the property’s 
contour (which goes against the green mantra). How much water will your 
property require? Are you going to landscape? How much water will that 
require, and will it affect drainage?
 
Pay attention to the landscaping of the neighbors. If you scrimp on water-
devouring landscaping, your neighbors may frown upon your maverick ways. 
Better to know now than to find out too late.
What are the future plans for the area?
Don’t forget to determine what may happen in the future. Is a shopping mall 
planned next door five years hence? How about a freeway? Or an airport? To 
find out about these kinds of things, ask your realtor and your county build-
ing department. For that matter, hang around the local coffee shop and see 

305
 Chapter 21: Building an Energy-Efficient Home from the Ground Up
what’s what. Make friends with the waitress by giving a nice big tip. Next time 
you go in, ask for some local gossip. It could save you a lot of money and 
aggravation in the long run.
Designing Your Home
When most people build their own homes, they follow these two steps: First, 
they look through books of home designs and find one they like. Second, they 
go out and find a lot. When you build an energy-efficient home, you reverse 
these two steps, finding a lot first and then designing your house. Why? 
Because each lot will support a different style house, with a layout that maxi-
mizes views, breezes, landscaping, and so on. So your house design should 
be a function of the lot. Don’t commit to a particular house design and then 
insist on finding a lot that will bear it out.
 
Design your home on a twelve-month basis. Consider all the different seasons.
Size matters: The littler, the better
The smaller the home, the better the potential for energy efficiency. A 
smaller house uses less building materials, is cheaper to maintain, requires 
less HVAC capacity, and uses less energy.
When you build an efficient house, keep it small and appoint it well. If you 
think bigger is always better, remember that large houses can seem small, 
and small houses can seem large. The key is the design. You can make a 
small house every bit as spacious as a large house by doing the following:
 
 Avoid long, wide hallways.
 
 Combine utility functions like laundry and storage.
 
 Put in less bathroom space (make bathrooms tall rather than wide for a 
spacious effect).
 
 Combine the living room and family room into one central great room.
 
 Add a nice sunroom off the living area.
 
 Place windows where you can get good, unimpeded views to the outdoors.
Orienting the house on the lot
When it comes to plotting out where and how your house will sit on the lot, 
keep these points in mind:

306
Part IV: Considering Efficiency When You Buy, Build, or Sell a Home 
 
 Make sure the long axis of the house runs east to west. This creates the 
greatest southern exposure. The front of the house can face either south 
or north. Up to 20 degrees off true south works well enough.
 
 Ensure that the roof has maximum sun exposure. Roof exposure is 
critical for locating solar collectors, although you can plan on ground 
mounting if you have enough room. Mounting on the roof is usually best 
because it gives you better immunity from shadows. Plus, the panels 
can be hidden more easily by means of clever design. Ground mounting 
requires wire runs (trenches dug where long lengths of thick gauge wire 
will be buried — an expensive component), and hiding the panels usu-
ally entails shading issues, making the process more difficult. You do 
not need to locate all your solar panels on one expanse of roof, although 
visually this is usually more tenable.
 
 Deciduous trees work well on the western and southern exposures. A 
house often feels much nicer in the morning with direct sunshine, so try 
to keep eastern shading to a minimum. Eastern kitchens are more conge-
nial because you avoid hot afternoon exposures, while ensuring a bright 
morning wake-up call. A southeastern breakfast nook is ideal.
 
 Hillsides work very well for providing insulation via earth berms 
and half basements. Hillsides facing south are the best bet because you 
can get two floors’ worth of good sun exposure while enjoying northern 
insulation.
Figuring out a floor plan
The floor plan of a home can impact its energy-efficiency capabilities. Whether 
you build a large or a small house, a few general design principles apply:
 
 Go with a central design. Central designs, in which the home is oriented 
around a central nucleus, work much better than houses with wings, 
which are difficult to heat and cool and require more maintenance.
 
 Design your house with heat movement in mind. Open airways, for 
example, make a house seem more spacious, as well as ensuring natural 
air movement. Avoid long, meandering hallways and rooms with odd 
angles and high, unventilated ceilings. Basically, you want to exploit the 
chimney and greenhouse effects, and optimize the movement of natural 
breezes by venting appropriately (all of which are explained in detail in 
Chapter 13).
 
 Place rooms in such a way as to maximize the positives and camou-
flage the negatives. For example, a western exposure is typically hot 
and uncomfortable in the late afternoons and evenings, so putting the 
garage on that side of the house creates a buffer. Or perhaps the view 
from one side of the house is unattractive, in which case the garage 
should go there. You can also achieve a buffer from cold winter winds 

307
 Chapter 21: Building an Energy-Efficient Home from the Ground Up
by placing the garage on the windward side of the house. Likewise, 
family rooms generally work best on a southern exposure because that’s 
where your family is likely to spend the most time and get the most ben-
efit from solar potential. Use screened-in porches to shade windows on 
the east and west sides of the house.
 
 Consider time of day versus room usage in your layout. Are you in a 
home office all day? Do you want to wake up in the sunshine? A kitchen 
on the eastern front is nice. A master bedroom on the northern front 
stays cooler, quieter, and darker.
 
 Arrange your windows strategically. Sunrooms and windows are 
always best on the south side, where they can take advantage of the sun 
exposure. By contrast, the light on the northern side of the structure is 
cold and dull; windows on that side don’t allow any heat from the sun in 
but do let heat escape out. So put closets, bathrooms, laundry rooms, 
and other such rooms, which can tolerate poor lighting and smaller 
windows, on the north side. By reducing windows on the northern expo-
sure, you can increase insulation.
 
 Use overhangs deliberately. Energy-efficient houses always have well-
designed overhangs over the windows, porches, and doorways, particu-
larly in the family room.
Incorporating energy-efficient technology
When you build a home from the ground up, you have the perfect opportunity 
to incorporate not only building designs that increase your energy efficiency, 
but you can also include energy efficient appliances and other add-ons:
 
 Non-electrical lighting: Use solar tubes, reflectors, orientations of 
windows to maximize sunlight entry, and so on. Celestories (windows 
located high up in a room, generally facing southward) can provide both 
heating and lighting over the course of the year.
 
 PV panels and solar water heaters: Go to Chapter 16 for details on solar 
panels and Chapter 11 for info on solar water heaters.
 
 A gas, wood, or other type of stove: Put it in the family room where 
you can use it to provide the vast majority of your heating needs (par-
ticularly is your home is centrally designed). Most of the time you don’t 
need to heat your entire house. In the same vein, portable room heaters 
and air conditioners are much cheaper to operate than a whole-house 
HVAC system.
 
 Features with more thermal mass. The more thermal mass, the more 
consistent the temperatures in the house. Slab floors are best for this 
reason. Solar rooms with concrete floors and masonry walls work well. 
Big stone fireplaces with winter exposures to sunlight also work well in 
conjunction with overhangs.

308
Part IV: Considering Efficiency When You Buy, Build, or Sell a Home 
Choosing Your Materials
After you define the general design of your house, it’s time to specify par-
ticular materials and equipment. When choosing equipment, always pay 
attention to the lifetime of the product, not just the initial cost and energy 
consumption. Having to replace the equipment in a few years is hardly 
efficient.
Construction materials
In this book, the context of energy efficiency is geared predominantly toward 
the consumption end of things — in other words, the energy it takes to make 
your home work. But energy is also required in the building process and in 
the manufacture of the building materials that go into your home. Consider 
the following ways of minimizing your energy usage:
Going beyond conventional styles
You can use nontraditional home construc-
tion methods. Check out Green Building & 
Remodeling For Dummies by Eric Corey Freed 
(Wiley) for a range of home building styles 
that can offer far greater energy efficiency 
than conventional styles. Here are some of the 
options you may want to consider:
  Straw bales: Just like it sounds, a house 
made of straw bales (like that of the three 
little pigs, although I’m not trying to imply 
anything here). Features excellent insulation 
properties and inexpensive construction. 
You’ll probably have a tough time finding a 
contractor who knows the ins and out.
  Adobe: Sun-dried bricks; inexpensive, low 
energy to make.
  Rammed earth: A technique that uses earth, 
or dirt, to create incredible insulation levels. 
You will probably have a tough time finding 
a contractor; look on the Internet.
  Cob: A method by which you can create odd 
shapes and contours with natural elements. 
Good insulation, inexpensive, kind of zany.
  Pneumatically impacted stabilized earth: A 
method that uses good old Mother Earth for 
insulation and stability.
  Structural insulated panels: Prefab panels 
made of Styrofoam sandwiched between 
plywood. You can build a very solid, well-
insulated home from these panels at low 
cost. Look to see a lot more of these in 
the future because they take less invested 
energy, which is the amount of energy con-
sumed in the manufacturing process.
  Insulated concrete forms: Thick walls 
with incredible insulation levels. The home 
stays very comfortable in both hot and cold 
weather, and the utility bills are low. But 
the cost of construction is high because 
the method is so new.

309
 Chapter 21: Building an Energy-Efficient Home from the Ground Up
 
 Use recycled building materials whenever possible. Many, especially 
recycled wood products, are available.
 
 Use products manufactured near your construction site. Doing so mini-
mizes transportation costs.
 
 Don’t use solid woods. Laminates and veneers save rain forests and 
look like solid woods. The synthetics are made of recycled plastic con-
tainers (like milk containers) and last much longer than real wood. Plus, 
you don’t need to paint them with nasty chemicals, and they won’t warp 
or chip.
 
 Use indigenous materials whenever possible. This includes using rocks 
from your own property for landscaping purposes, if feasible.
 
 Use roofing shingles that are reflective and provide good insulation. 
Unless, of course, you’re looking for a hot attic in the winter more than 
cooling in the summer. In either case, consider how you’re going to vent 
your attic in both the summer and winter. Radiant barriers in the attic 
space, for example, are much easier to put up during a home’s construc-
tion than after the fact. And the material is relatively inexpensive consid-
ering the potential benefit. (For details on these barriers and other ways 
to insulate your attic, head to Chapter 7.)
 
 Avoid aluminum framed windows, which conduct too much heat, and, 
at the very least, specify double-pane windows. You can get triple-pane 
windows, as well as special windows with gas insulation between the 
panes, but the cost goes up markedly.
Making your own lumber
Just like your distant forebears, you can cut 
down your own trees and make your own 
lumber. Fortunately, the process has drastically 
improved since the Paul Bunyan axe technique. 
Now you can buy special rack and rail systems 
that let you fell a tree, set up your equipment 
right there on the ground next to the tree, and 
cut precise depths and widths of lumber. You 
need to dry the wood properly in a kiln, but 
that’s not difficult.
A neighbor of mine cut some oaks down and 
hand-carved them with a chain saw. He used 
them to construct the big frame members for a 
barn. Talk about character! He built not only a 
functional barn but also a lasting legacy.
An alternative is to hire somebody to turn your 
trees into lumber at a cost that’s competitive 
with commodity lumber. If you have a number 
of trees on your lot that you need to fell, this 
may be a very cool option. Imagine living in 
your home knowing that the lumber came from 
that very spot. If you’ve got an old maple or oak 
tree that needs to come down anyway, you can 
have it turned into lumber and make some really 
classy furniture out of it.

310
Part IV: Considering Efficiency When You Buy, Build, or Sell a Home 
 
 The aesthetic quality of your windows determines the value of your 
house to a large degree. Spend some extra money for nice-looking 
frames, grids, and special functional features. At the very least, you want 
windows that are easy to operate because you’ll be opening and closing 
them a lot.
Energy-efficient systems and appliances
Obviously, an energy-efficient home is tricked out with energy-efficient appli-
ances and systems. Following are the highlights of interior appointments of 
an energy-efficient home. You can find out more about these by going to the 
respective chapters within this book:
 
 Window blinds, awnings, and sunscreens: These provide visual appeal 
while providing insulation and preventing sunshine when you don’t want 
it. After all you’ve been through, don’t skimp here because these have 
a huge impact on how efficient your home is. They can literally make or 
break the ambience of a house. See Chapter 12 for the lowdown.
 
 Flooring: Tiles have more thermal mass than wood, which means they 
hold much more heat energy (if left in the sun, they will stay warm long 
after the sunlight is gone). They also cost less, last longer, and require 
less maintenance. Both tile and wood are infinitely better than carpeting 
for a variety of reasons, as explained in Chapter 6.
 
 Insulation: A well-insulated house is a more energy-efficient house. 
That’s why your insulation should be as thick as you can afford.
 
 Heating and cooling: To make your HVAC as efficient as possible, use 
the smallest HVAC system you can and, if necessary, supplement or 
replace it with energy-efficient alternatives. Chapter 8 discusses ways to 
maximize an existing HVAC system; Part III has a whole host of ways to 
supplement it.
 
 Ventilation options: How well air moves through a house has a lot to 
do with how comfortable that home is. Think about installing ceiling 
fans, an attic vent fan controlled by a thermostat switch, and/or a whole-
house fan. You can find information on all of these in Chapter 13.
 
 Appliances: If you’re building a home, chances are you’re buying heat-
ing and cooling equipment, lighting, and at least some new appliances. 
Always opt for the most energy-efficient models you can afford. See 
Chapter 11 for more info.
 
 Plumbing: Use as few sinks as possible, and keep the piping runs as 
short as you can. (Head to Chapter 10 for ways to decrease you water 
consumption.)

311
 Chapter 21: Building an Energy-Efficient Home from the Ground Up
 
 Swimming pool pump: If you’re building a swimming pool, consider a 
solar-powered pump. It’s expensive upfront, but you’ll never have to 
pay a cent for pump power. A solar pump can provide even greater effi-
ciency if your house is in a region with time of use (TOU) metering. See 
Chapter 16 for the lowdown on solar systems for swimming pools.
A word about installing PV systems
When you decide to use a PV system, you have to determine whether to 
install it during construction or after. 
Your initial thought may be to install it during construction, but that may not 
be the smartest move. Why? You can’t know how much energy your house 
requires until you’ve lived in it for a year or so because your energy con-
sumption will depend on your personal habits and how the house interacts 
with weather patterns. 
 
 Installing it during construction: If you install a PV system during con-
struction, you run the risk of getting more power than you use. If your 
system is intertie (connected to the grid, which the vast majority of sys-
tems are), which it definitely should be if you have the option, you won’t 
get anything back from the utility if you provide them more power than 
you use (see Chapter 16 for more details on intertie systems). In other 
words, you’ll be spending more than you need to and getting no benefits 
for the additional expense.
 
 Installing it later: The problem with waiting is that it prevents you from 
financing the PV system as part of your new house. You may be able to 
get an equity loan, but the terms won’t be as favorable as if you simply 
wrap the PV financing into the original home loan.
Your best bet is to wait a year or so before you install your PV system. Design 
the layout so that you can install your system easily when it’s time: Leave 
room near the fuse box for an inverter and switches. Make the roof pitch and 
construction optimum for PV panels.
 
If you decide to install the system during construction, estimate your energy 
needs and install a system that’s smaller than you think you will ultimately 
need. You can buy an oversized inverter (the part that changes the raw elec-
trical signals from the panels on your roof into useable household power) so 
that, after a year or two when you know more precisely how much energy you 
need, you can simply put in a few more solar panels. (Chapter 16 has more 
details on PV systems.)

Pounding Nails: What to Know 
When Construction Begins
So construction is set to begin. You’ll be happy to know that building an 
energy-efficient house isn’t much different from building a conventional one. 
You don’t need a contractor who has built energy-efficient homes before. The 
passive aspects of good energy-efficient design are part of the architectural 
plans, so any contractor should be able to do the job properly. The construc-
tion process is the same, too. Installing energy-efficient equipment isn’t any dif-
ferent from installing other equipment. Any competent contractor can do it.
As you watch  your home grow from the ground up, keep these general 
points in mind:
 
 Be patient. Building a home is a major project, probably the biggest one 
you’ll ever undertake. Expect the whole project to take at least a couple 
years.
 
 Don’t count on your home being completed by a certain date because it 
probably won’t be. It will take on a life of its own, just like your kids. You 
think you can program them the way you want, but they outgrow your 
controls and become their own beings.
 
 Be prepared to compromise. Insisting on perfection is impractical and 
unnecessary. You can make design adjustments to accommodate inevi-
table compromises.
 
 Hire a good general contractor. In most states you can be your own 
general contractor without a license, but going this route isn’t a good 
idea, even if you know what you’re doing and have the time and orga-
nizational skills to pull it off. (Many people who have decided to go it 
alone have regretted it simply because the project takes so much time 
and energy.)
 
 Building homes is the livelihood of contractors and, as a result, they’re 
very conservative about committing to big jobs. They have all, unfor-
tunately, seen potential jobs go away at the drop of a hat, and they’ve 
been left in a lurch. So never treat your new home project casually. 
Your decisions can have major consequences for others, and you have a 
responsibility to proceed with respect for the magnitude of how you are 
influencing other people’s lives.

Energy-Efficient Home
In This Chapter
 Appraising and buying existing energy-efficient homes
 Looking for a conventional home to transform into an efficient home
 Selling your energy-efficient home for the most profit
T
he bulk of this book is dedicated to defining energy-efficiency projects 
you can do in or around your home. But perhaps you’re interested in 
moving into an existing efficient home where everything has already been 
done for you. Or perhaps you want to move into a conventional home suit-
able for energy-efficiency updates that you plan on either installing yourself 
or contracting out for. Maybe you’re looking to sell your energy-efficient 
home.
Whether buying or selling, your goal is always to get the best deal you can. 
With conventional homes, maneuvering for the best deal is a well-defined 
game played by the buyer, the seller, and both agents. But things gets a 
little trickier with an energy-efficient home because the market is relatively 
untested, and things are changing fast. You need to understand how energy-
efficiency technology, like solar technology, the price of homes in your 
area and how different stoves and heating and cooling systems play with 
the market in general. If you’re selling an energy-efficient home, your tasks 
include educating potential sellers. Finally, because energy-efficient homes 
generally cost more than conventional homes, you need to understand how 
to put a number on this difference. In this chapter, I give you all the informa-
tion you need.

314
Part IV: Considering Efficiency When You Buy, Build, or Sell a Home 
Buying an Existing Efficient Home
If you want an energy-efficient home, you can build your own (Chapter 21 
explains how), but that’s a long, arduous task. An easier and generally less 
time-consuming solution is to buy an existing efficient home.
Unfortunately, not a lot of energy-efficient homes are out there — at least not 
today. This situation will change quite a bit in the coming years, but for now, 
if you want an efficient home, you’re going to have to look hard for one, and 
you may be disappointed with what you find. Restricting yourself to buying 
an existing efficient home will probably mean making some big compromises 
on the type and style of home you want.
When looking for existing energy-efficient homes, heed the maxim “Let the 
buyer beware.” If you find an energy-efficient home that you’re interested in, 
you need to make sure the equipment is sound and does what it’s supposed to 
do. The following sections tell you how to evaluate an energy-efficient home.
 
If you live in an area where solar communities are springing up, count your 
lucky stars and head there to take a look. These communities are designed 
for energy efficiency and environmental friendliness. All the homes, designed 
by professionals who know how to make solar systems work to their fullest 
potential, feature both passive and active solar power. Energy-efficient equip-
ment like HVAC, water heating, and so on is standard fare. In addition, most of 
these communities include special recycling centers to ensure minimal envi-
ronmental impact.
 
In most states, real estate law clearly states that if a piece of equipment is 
attached to a house, it’s part of the house. Doors are part of a house, whereas 
refrigerators are not. In theory, all solar equipment is part of the house, but 
this is often misunderstood, particularly with regard to swimming pool sys-
tems, which sometimes end up going with the seller to his new house. If you 
buy a home with energy-efficient equipment already installed, make sure to 
get in writing exactly what equipment is staying or going. Otherwise, you may 
be in for a nasty surprise on moving day.
Evaluating just how energy efficient 
a home is (or isn’t)
In addition to the usual pest, roof, and other inspections normally done for 
a real estate transaction, you need to have energy audits and solar potential 
inspections if you’re thinking about buying an already existing energy-efficient 
home. Specifically, you need to evaluate how energy-efficient the home is, 

315
 Chapter 22: Buying and Selling an Energy-Efficient Home
identify the kind of energy-efficiency (especially solar) equipment it has, and 
determine the condition of that equipment.
 
Energy-efficiency equipment increases the maintenance responsibility of 
any house. You need to know what you’re doing and how to use the equip-
ment, even if it’s all in perfect working order. Unfortunately, because energy-
efficiency concepts are relatively new, most realtors and market professionals 
don’t thoroughly understand the ins and outs. So it’s up to you to arm yourself 
with the information you need to understand exactly what you’re getting into.
Taking a quick look
A relatively quick look-see can tell you quite a bit about how effective the 
energy-efficiency features of a home are:
 
 Look at the home’s orientation and landscaping. Is it situated in such a 
way as to maximize the solar exposure? Are deciduous trees in the right 
spots? Refer to Chapter 21 for information on the importance of orienta-
tion and landscaping.
 
 Check out the home’s electrical, HVAC, and water heating systems. 
What type of HVAC does it have and how old is it? (If it’s old, over fifteen 
years, you’ll probably have to replace it.)
 
 Check the major appliances. A central vacuum (in which the vacuum is 
located in the garage and special PVC pipes run through the house so 
that all you have to do is plug in the wand to vacuum wherever you are 
in the house) is a plus.
 
 Evaluate the home’s layout. Some designs are more conducive to 
energy efficiency than others (refer to Chapter 21 for details). 
 
 Pay attention to the windows. Check for overhangs and awnings 
over windows. Are the blinds strictly decorative, or do they also have 
functionality?
 
 Check for thermal masses. Thermal masses are things like concrete 
floors and walls, tile floors — any mass that holds a lot of heat. Are they 
arranged so that they catch sunlight during the day, which results in 
better heating efficiency at night? Are they being used effectively both 
inside and outside the house?
In addition to your quick look-through, you also may want to conduct an 
energy-efficiency audit — not just for the energy-efficient equipment, but for 
the entire house. (Chapter 3 gives more details on energy audits) You can 
have this done as part of the usual due diligence, or you may want to pay for 
it upfront before you start getting serious about the house.

316
Part IV: Considering Efficiency When You Buy, Build, or Sell a Home 
Perusing the power bills
Ask to see the power bills for the past year. If the seller doesn’t have them, 
he can easily get them from the utility company. If you can’t get any power 
bills, something is wrong. The vast majority of efficient home owners are 
proud to show off their power bills.
 
If, in examining the bills, you notice that some monthly bills are unusually 
high, it could mean that the efficiency equipment was broken at that time. 
Ask why the bill blipped, and take warning if the answer doesn’t jibe with the 
seller’s claims of how often the equipment went down.
Looking closely at the efficiency equipment
Look for energy-efficient technology. For example, are solar tubes showing on 
the roof? Skylights? Solar panels? Do they look new or old? Once you know 
the type of equipment, get the following information:
 
 Where the equipment was purchased and who installed it: Are these 
companies still in business, and if not, why not? If it’s a do-it-yourself 
job, have it checked out by a pro, or, if you’re a do-it-yourselfer and 
know what to look for, check it yourself.
 
 Whether local building department permits were obtained for the 
equipment: If not, why not? A permit implies that a building inspection 
was performed, which ensures that the work was done to code. Without 
a permit, the work may be substandard, although not necessarily. The 
point is, the risk becomes yours. You may want to insist on the seller 
getting the necessary permits, although they’re going to balk because 
it’s a big hassle.
 
 Warranty information and records regarding system performance and 
maintenance: How much time is left on the warranty? Ask whether the 
warranty is transferable (this is important). Have any warranty repairs 
been done? If so, pay attention to what went wrong. If several warranty 
repairs have been done, beware — especially if the warranty is about to 
expire.
 
 Manuals: You want the original manuals that came with the equipment. 
You may be able to get these on the Internet, but a conscientious owner 
(the kind you want) should have them. Read through the manuals, and 
you’ll understand the equipment and what it’s going to need by way of 
maintenance and repair.
 
 System use vs. system capacity: Determine how much equipment is 
being used versus its maximum capacity. If there’s a solar water heater, 
how much of its capacity is being used to offset the current power bill? If 

317
 Chapter 22: Buying and Selling an Energy-Efficient Home
the solar water heater is capable of outputting twice as much energy as 
it currently is, is this important to you? If your family is bigger, you’ll use 
more hot water, and you’ll probably use more energy in general. This 
may or may not be reflected in higher energy bills.
 
 Personal habits enter into these calculations, so temper what you find 
with a consideration of how the seller’s energy usage may differ from 
your own.
 
You can easily check a PV system by looking at the power output on a sunny 
day near solar noon. First, check the panels and see how far off the optimum 
angle they are. Then simply read the digital meter on the face of the inverter. 
This will be the maximum amount of power you can expect to get out of the 
system.
Anticipating changes and repairs
Before you reject or accept an existing energy-efficient home, you need to 
determine what kinds of changes you’d want to make to improve the home’s 
energy efficiency and what kinds of repairs may be just around the corner. 
Then you can decide whether these tasks are ones you’re willing to take on. 
Some questions to ask include:
 
 Can the systems be expanded? For instance, is the inverter larger than 
its current output power? If so, PV panels can be added. A hot water 
system can usually be expanded by adding more collectors.
 
 Could you get more out of the equipment by making a few changes? 
Are there trees shading the collectors that you could cut down to get 
more productivity? Are the collectors dirty and unkept? Are vicious little 
creatures like raccoons nested somewhere, jealously guarding their 
domicile?
 
 Does the roof need to be replaced? You’ll get a roof inspection as a 
matter of routine. If the roof needs to be replaced and it contains solar 
equipment, you’ll have to pay to get the equipment dismantled first, and 
then reassembled after the new roof is in place. Solar power won’t be 
produced during this period, either.
 
 If there’s a net metering agreement, does it carry over? What is the 
rate structure going to be? If it’s not going to be the same as the one in 
place the last few years, the utility bills that you get are going to be dif-
ferent. Can you change the rate structure if you want?

318
Part IV: Considering Efficiency When You Buy, Build, or Sell a Home 
Determining the value of an 
existing efficient home
If you like the home and everything seems to be on the up and up, you’re 
ready to make an offer. An energy-efficient home costs more than a compa-
rable conventional home, most of the time. To determine what’s reasonable, 
you need to know what a comparable conventional home would cost and 
then add the value associated with the energy-efficiency equipment.
You should be able to get an accurate estimate on how much a conventional 
home is worth from your realtor. The tricky part is determining the value of 
the efficiency equipment. Why? Because to do so, you really have to deter-
mine two values: the value to you (what you’re willing to offer for the house) 
and what a bank will value the property at. Some banks are completely igno-
rant of energy efficiency and may not add any value at all for efficiency equip-
ment, while others understand its value (see Chapter 4 for more on financial 
issues). 
Here are some things to do and consider as you try to determine the value of 
an energy-efficient home:
 
 Try to get what realtors call “comps” — the recent sales prices of com-
parable homes in the same local area. Gauging a home’s value this way 
may not be completely accurate, but it’s the best place to start. At the 
very least, you’ll find out how buyers are operating. If no value seems 
to be placed on energy-efficiency equipment, you’re in luck as a buyer 
(though this is bad when you’re selling).
 
 Figure out how much it would cost to have a contractor come in and 
install all the energy-efficiency equipment that is already in place: 
Be sure to include not only the equipment but the installation labor 
and any other costs as well. A solar home’s equipment should never be 
worth more than this amount, although buzz can sometimes send values 
higher. Plus, do-it-yourself projects are more difficult and a lot of people 
simply don’t want to do them, so they’ll pay more for equipment that’s 
already in place.
 
 Compare energy bills for the efficient home versus a comparable 
conventional home. How much less are the energy bills? View this as a 
monthly payment on a second mortgage, and then determine the loan 
balance that would result in that monthly payment. Realize that you can 
buy more house when you don’t have a monthly utility bill. The key to 
an energy-efficient home is having more money each month to do things 
other than pay utility bills.

319
 Chapter 22: Buying and Selling an Energy-Efficient Home
 
 If you think power rates are going to go through the roof in the future, 
an efficient home is worth more. Keep in mind that past records are fine 
and dandy, but it’s the future that counts. Energy-efficient homes not 
only cost you less in energy bills, but they will also see less increase 
when rates go up. When you buy into energy efficiency, you’re insuring 
your future against severe cost jolts. This is worth something, although 
it’s very hard to enumerate.
 
 Determine how much it’s worth to you to mitigate pollution. See 
Chapter 5 for a method of enumerating this rather intangible issue. The 
bottom line is that we’re all going to be paying to accomplish this laud-
able goal.
 
 Call your homeowner’s insurance agent and ask about solar equip-
ment and how it might affect your insurance rates and terms. If the 
equipment has not been inspected and permitted by the local building 
department, bring this up. Ask about any odd construction techniques, 
like rammed earth. Some insurance companies won’t insure this kind of 
dwelling because state law mandates them to build an identical house in 
the event of a claim. It may be impossible to get an identical house if the 
one you’re looking at is an oddball (geodesic domes, watch out!).
 
 As you would with any house, think about how long you anticipate 
living there. If you’re going to be staying for a long time, you don’t need 
to worry about selling a home, only about buying it. If you’re going to 
be living in the area for a short time, you should be as concerned about 
selling as you are about buying.
Maybe the most important question to ask yourself is whether you would buy 
this house if it were exactly the same structure, but without any efficiency 
equipment. How much you would pay for it then? How much you’re willing to 
pay comes down to how much you want the house. That’s the bottom line. 
Your realtor is going to have to help you come up with a competitive offer, 
which is far beyond the scope of this book.
Buying an Existing Home to Upgrade
There are good reasons for buying an existing conventional home and install-
ing energy-efficiency equipment yourself, as opposed to buying a completed 
efficient home:
 
 You have a lot more options. In some areas, efficient homes are a real 
rarity and you may not even be able to find one that’s for sale.
 
 Your equipment will be brand new with a full warranty. Because hom-
eowners rarely install expensive equipment right before they sell, the 

320
Part IV: Considering Efficiency When You Buy, Build, or Sell a Home 
equipment on existing efficient homes is usually older, which can mean 
more maintenance and less efficiency.
 
 New equipment is always better than old because technology is always 
improving. Plus, your improvements may qualify for subsidies or tax 
incentives; see Chapter 4 for details.
 
 If you’re a do-it-yourselfer, you can install equipment for much less 
than a professional contractor. That means the value you place on 
some types of efficiency equipment will be less than what a seller is 
probably going to demand for a completed home. You will know the 
equipment better, and you won’t have to trust a seller’s claims of perfor-
mance. Keep in mind, though, that you may be able to get a guarantee of 
performance when you buy an efficient home. When you do the installs 
yourself, there are no guarantees of any kind, or at the very least, they 
are hazy.
 
 You can install equipment as the need arises, timing your efficiency 
improvements in ways that most benefit you. This is especially impor-
tant if you finance the purchase of your home with a first mortgage, 
which won’t include your equipment improvements. This means you’ll 
have to find another way to pay for your upgrades. Doing them a little 
at a time is one option. Another is getting an equity loan, but ultimately 
this will cost you more (in monthly payments) than simply buying a 
completed energy-efficient home and wrapping all the extra value into 
one first mortgage.
 
You may be able to demand that some improvements be done before you buy 
an existing home. Perhaps you can get a seller to install some solar or other 
energy-efficiency equipment as a condition of sale. If a water heater is shot, 
perhaps you can demand a solar water heating system be put in its place, for 
example.
If you’re going to buy an existing conventional home and install your own 
efficiency equipment, you need to carefully and accurately evaluate its suit-
ability. Here’s a checklist:
 
 Read Chapter 21 on designing and building an efficient home from 
scratch. When you’re looking at a prospective home, compare its fea-
tures with the ideals expressed in Chapter 21.
 
 Make a list of all the efficiency investments that will work in your 
new home; then estimate the costs for doing each project, based on 
the construction and layout of the house. This is relatively easy for 
active solar energy, like PV and hot water, and for installing things like 
fireplaces and stoves, where you can get a good idea of the cost by 
simply talking to a local retailer. But it’s going to be tougher for passive 
features, those built right into the home’s design, such as skylights and 

321
 Chapter 22: Buying and Selling an Energy-Efficient Home
window orientation. You’ll probably find that moving walls and cutting 
into ceilings isn’t really worth the cost, given the potential savings on 
your power bills. Passive solar is much easier to design and build into a 
home than it is to modify a home for.
 
 To figure out where the most egregious energy sinks are so that you 
know what you’re facing and can prioritize your improvements, get a 
professional energy audit, if possible. A seller may let you do one, but 
it’s a tough request to make before an offer is on the table. Inspections 
are normally done once an offer is made and accepted.
 
 Evaluate existing energy equipment for potential improvements. Is the 
HVAC old? Perhaps you can demand that a new one be installed. How 
about wood stoves or gas stoves? Attic vents?
 
Installing energy-efficient equipment on any home usually entails tearing out 
some existing equipment and forking over the money for new equipment. You 
should have a good idea of what you want to do in your new home, and some 
idea of the price of the upgrades.
Selling Your Efficient 
Home for Big Bucks
You want the most you can get for your efficient home, of course. To get top 
dollar, you need to know what buyers look for when they’re in the market for 
an existing energy-efficient home. The first section in this chapter, “Buying an 
Existing Efficient Home,” goes into detail on what buyers should look for. As a 
seller, here’s what you need to know:
 
 Keep good records of everything. If you can’t validate your energy-
efficiency claims, your systems may be worthless. Or even more 
detrimental to your cause, you may cast yourself as untrustworthy in 
general — why else would you be making claims that you can’t back up?
 
 Find a realtor who knows efficient houses, and how best to offer 
them for sale to the market. You want to capitalize on “buzz” — in this 
regard, some market strategies work and some don’t. The right realtor 
will let the right buyers know you’ve got an efficient home for sale.
 
 Target the right market. At present, most people have no clear idea 
what energy efficiency means, beyond the fact that utility bills will (or 
should) be lower. These people are not likely to pay you more for your 
energy-efficient home than they would pay for a conventional home. 
As energy rates rise, this will change, out of necessity. But one thing is 

322
Part IV: Considering Efficiency When You Buy, Build, or Sell a Home 
always true of marketing: You need to reach the right buyers to get the 
best price. Shotgun approaches (blasting at the whole world and hoping 
you’ll hit something) is almost always unproductive.
 
 Price the house correctly. You’re going to price your energy-efficient 
home higher than a conventional home, and rightly so. But if you don’t 
reach the right market, your home won’t sell, and then you’ll have a 
reputation in local realtor circles for trying to sell an overpriced home.
 
 Realtors see overpriced homes as a waste of time, and they don’t bother 
showing them. The initial entry of a home onto a market is the most 
important time because realtors lose interest in a house that doesn’t 
sell. Even if you subsequently lower your price, they still won’t get as 
enthused as they will with a house that’s new on the market and priced 
correctly.
The bottom line: Always be square with everybody all the time. People know 
when you’re playing games.

T
hese twin sentiments pretty much sum up this chapter. The best energy-
efficiency tips are those that are easy to do and give you the best pay-
back. The crème de la crème is achieving both.
Installing a Programmable Thermostat
For $40 to $150, you can install a programmable thermostat to automatically 
control the temperature of your home. (Some thermostats can also control 
the humidity — a good option if you want to ensure a comfortable environ-
ment.) The trick with a programmable thermostat is to minimize the amount 
of time the system is turned on when you’re not home. If you’re at work all 
day, you can turn off your HVAC system, or at least raise the temperature in 
the summer and lower it in the winter, while you’re away and then program it 
to turn back on a short time before you’re due home.
 
If you’re on a peak rate schedule, a programmable thermostat can save you 
even more because you can avoid using your HVAC during peak hours.

326
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Payback of your original investment only takes six months to two years. You 
would be hard-pressed to find any other type of energy-efficient investment 
that works so well.
Chapter 8 has lots more information on what you can do to save money on 
your HVAC system.
Sealing Your Home’s Envelope
Most leaks in ductwork and heating and cooling vents are very easy to fix and 
take little more than a few twists of your wrists. Some, like the ones in your 
attic or basement, are very difficult to get at. The worst culprits are leaks 
around windows. But every leak costs a lot because it allows cold air to enter 
your home in the winter and hot air to enter in the summer.
To fix leaks, you generally need nothing more than caulk and weatherstrip-
ping, two of the least expensive fix-it products made. Some window leaks may 
require that you buy special seals, but these are generally harder to find than 
they are expensive.
If you spend less than $100 on materials like caulk and weatherstripping, you 
can easily save this much in one year’s time. Plus your home will be more 
comfortable, with fewer drafts and temperature fluctuations from room to 
room.
Another way to seal your home’s envelope is fill in the gaps in your insula-
tion. This investment takes an initial cash outlay, but you’ll unquestionably 
save on heating and cooling bills, and your home will be more comfortable 
to boot. Most insulation investments pay back in around two years. Your 
home will also be worth more because you can show a prospective buyer 
your smaller utility bills, and they’ll factor this into their offering price. Go to 
Chapter 7 for more on insulating your home against drafts.
Sealing the Ducts in Your HVAC System
If the ducts in your HVAC system aren’t properly sealed, you’re wasting a lot 
of hot or cold air that could be better spent warming or cooling your home. 
Although sealing these ducts can be a hassle — you may have to climb into 
the attic, crawl around underneath your ground floor, climb ladders, or twist 
yourself into the shape of a pretzel — you won’t spend much money, and 
you’ll get an incredible return on the money you do have to spend.

327
 Chapter 23: Ten Best Energy-Efficient Investments
The first thing to do is survey what needs to be done. Inspect all the duct-
work: Turn your HVAC on first because a lot of the leaks will be very obvious 
with a simple glance. Check for smaller leaks by using the wet hand tech-
nique described in Chapter 7.
To fix leaks in the ductwork, tape them where you can. If insulation is falling 
off (a very common problem), tape it back up. Given how cheap and effective 
this fix is, the payback can be less than a month.
 
Always wear a dust mask when working with ducts (say that fast, five times).
Installing a Flow Constrictor 
Shower Head
A flow constrictor is very simple: It’s just a washer with a hole of a preset 
size that you install inside the shower head. The smaller the hole, the lower 
the flow, and bigger the hole, the greater the flow. For a measly $15 and up, 
you can easily save that much in a couple months just by installing a low-flow 
showerhead (or as it’s so fashionable to say these days, a Lo Flo shower-
head). You don’t need to sacrifice the quality of your showers, either. You 
save tons of water, but even better, you save tons of heat energy, and that 
costs a lot more than water these days.
Lo Flo heads are simple to install:
 
1. Unscrew the old head.
 
 You may actually need pliers for this, but go ahead and give it a try 
before you trudge all the way down to the garage.
 
2. Take the old head with you to the hardware store and buy a good-
quality, Lo Flo head that you like the looks of.
 
 Take the old head because there are different sizes of mounting threads, 
or different types of mounting schemes. Also, get one that can be 
adjusted.
 
 If you have problems with mineral deposits in your water, buy a cheap 
head because it won’t be long before it gets all gummed up with crud.
 
3. Screw the new head on.
 
 You don’t have to trudge all the way down to the garage for pliers 
because if you use the rubber gasket that’s provided, you don’t have to 
screw the darn thing on very tight in order to get a good seal.

328
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Note: If you have a solar water heater, you don’t have much incentive to save 
hot water. You’re better off watching an old movie on the telly.
For more ways you can reduce your water consumption, go to Chapter 10.
Insulating Your Water Heater
Feel your water heater. If it feels warm to the touch, that means heat is leach-
ing out, and instead of warming your water, it’s warming the air — uselessly. 
So wrap an insulating blanket around your water heater. The payback will be 
around two years.
Insulating blankets, which cost around $20 to $30, are easy to install (just 
read the instructions that come with the blanket) and easy to find (they’re 
about as common as thumbtacks). Measure the dimensions (diameter and 
height) before you go to the hardware store. (You may want to call before 
you go and make sure they have them.)
 
Wear gloves and a long-sleeved shirt because insulation can make you itch a 
lot, and that takes more energy than you want to expend.
Head to Chapter 11 for other things you can do to increase the efficiency of 
your water heater and a plethora of other home appliances.
Plugging In Fluorescents
Traditional incandescent bulbs give off a lot of heat as well as light. In the 
summer, or when it’s warm, you don’t want the heat because it just makes 
your air-conditioner work harder. So in warm climates fluorescents are more 
efficient than incandescents. Installing a fluorescent bulb in place of any light 
bulb in your home that’s on for more than a couple hours a day will pay back 
in around one year.
Unless the light fixture is on a high ceiling, screwing in a fluorescent light 
bulb should be easy. Plugging in fluorescents is also a good idea for fixtures 
that are hard to reach. You’ll save labor and aggravation in the long run 
because fluorescents last a lot longer than incandescent light bulbs, so you 
won’t have to climb that ladder nearly as often.
Go to Chapter 9 for more on lighting your home more efficiently.

329
 Chapter 23: Ten Best Energy-Efficient Investments
Installing Motion Sensors
Install motion sensors (described in Chapter 9) in your garage or in closets 
and basements. You won’t have to reach your arm up and flip the switch 
(which saves a lot of effort, especially if your arm is very large). And when 
you leave the space, the light will go off by itself. It’s always good when 
things happen by themselves — that way not only do you not have to expend 
energy, but you don’t have to think about it, either.
Motion sensors are also a great idea for outdoor security lights, which other-
wise tend to be on all night long. With a motion sensor, the light comes on 
when something trips the sensor and goes off again automatically.
Putting Insulating Sleeves 
on Hot Water Pipes
You may have to reach over your head or go down into your basement or 
crawl space, but fitting elongated sleeves of foam insulation over hot water 
pipes makes a big difference.
First, measure the diameter of your pipes, then approximate the length you 
will need. At the hardware store, they’ll fix you up for cheap. Fitting this stuff 
around the pipes is actually kind of fun because nothing can go wrong. You 
don’t even have to cover the entire pipe; any little bit will help. There are 
very few things you can do in this life where nothing can go wrong, but this 
is one of them. Well, I guess you could put the insulation on cold water pipes. 
But it’s still fun.
Changing HVAC Filters 
on a Routine Basis
If your HVAC filters are dirty, the machinery has to work much harder, and 
your utility bill goes up very quickly. So change the filter whenever it gets 
clogged with dust. How can you tell? Most of the time all you have to do is 
listen. A dirty filter sounds like it’s whistling.

330
Part V: The Part of Tens 
If you buy filters in bulk, you can get them for less than $5 apiece. Also, when 
you buy them in bulk, you’ll have them handy and you’ll be more apt to 
change them when it’s time.
 
The expensive filters, usually advertised as electrostatic, aren’t worth the 
extra money you pay unless you’ve got some health issues that require you to 
buy these more expensive filters.
Tuning Up Your HVAC System Regularly
Properly maintained mechanical systems work better and more efficiently 
than systems that haven’t been maintained. So tune up your HVAC system 
every few years. You can pay a pro to do this — it’s worth the hundred dol-
lars or so it costs because a pro knows how to get things working as effi-
ciently as possible. (Be wary, however, of being sold something you don’t 
need, in which case the payback will be dubious.) Alternatively, you can tune 
up your system yourself if you have an instruction manual.
 
If you’ve got a combustion system, I don’t recommend tackling this task your-
self unless you’re an experienced do-it-yourselfer. Combustion systems are 
tricky to adjust, and they carry the potential of explosion if you do something 
drastically wrong. If you’ve got an electric system, the job is a lot easier and 
safer.

S
ome energy-saving solutions are ridiculously easy — so easy, in fact, 
that you may not have thought of them. Or if you did think of them, you 
may have thought that easy is the equivalent of ineffective. Au contraire. This 
chapter offers ways you can become more energy-efficient with very little 
work and little, if any, cost.
Turn Down the Thermostat
Lower the temperature in your home in the winter and raise it in the summer. 
Consider that most humans who have lived on Earth throughout the course 
of history have not even had access to air-conditioning, and heating was 
spotty at best. They survived just fine. So can you.
Close Doors and Dampers
Close the fireplace damper when the fireplace is not in use. If you don’t, the 
warm air (which you’ve paid for in your heating bills) just gets sucked out 
the chimney. It’s amazing how many people don’t do this, and it’s easy. Just 
make it a habit.

332
Part V: The Part of Tens 
You can also close off unused rooms and unused ducts. At a minimum, close 
the doors — even better, close the register.
Lower the Temp on Your Water Heater
You can save a lot of money by simply lowering the temperature on your 
domestic water heater. Most homes have the temperature set too high; 113°F 
is hot enough. See Chapter 10 for more details.
Use Your Microwave
If you need hot water, use your microwave oven instead of using the stove 
or letting the water run from the tap until it’s hot enough to satisfy you. The 
microwave uses a lot less energy than the stove, and filling the water pipes 
with hot water from heater to tap just to get a cup doesn’t make much sense.
The microwave is a more efficient alternative for most cooking chores, too. 
Steaming vegetables, warming leftovers — even boiling water — takes less 
energy in a microwave than it does on a stove top or in an oven. Using 
the microwave also reduces the amount of heat that gets released into the 
room — definitely a consideration during the hot months when you’re trying 
to stay cool.
Clear Kids’ Toys Out of Radiator Vents
Many radiator vents have obstructions on the inside. Kids drop their toys; 
animals drop their toys; that remote controller you can’t find has fallen down 
in there. Or maybe a chunk of carpet fell in when you were remodeling. All 
you have to do is pull the vent cover off, get a flashlight, bend over, and look 
down inside. Removing obstructions makes a huge difference in the efficiency 
of the HVAC operation, and makes the room much more comfortable to boot.
Use Warm or Cold Water instead of Hot
By simply using warm or cold water instead of hot, you can increase your 
energy efficiency and save money:

333
 Chapter 24: Ten Ridiculously Easy Energy-Saving Tips
 
 Wash clothes in cold water. Using warm or cold water in your washing 
machine can save quite a bit of energy. About 75 percent of the time you 
don’t need hot water. Although this may not work for the dirtiest loads, 
it works just fine for most. Detergents especially made for cold-water 
washing help, too. So give it a try, and see what comes of it. The worst 
that can happen is you have to run the clothes through again on a hotter 
cycle. But you’ll probably find that most of the time it doesn’t matter.
 
 Flush the garbage disposer with cold rather than hot water. The prob-
lem here is that most of the time when you turn your hot water on, you 
have to wait awhile for the hot water to arrive from the water heater. 
During this time, hot water is actually filling up the pipes between the 
heater and your disposer. This heat is then wasted. Even worse, in the 
summertime it ends up warming your home. If your air conditioner is on, 
it has to work harder. You lose in every way.
Lock Closed Windows
Leaks in your home’s envelope are one of the biggest causes of inefficien-
cies, and can cost quite a bit of money in terms of energy bills. If you simply 
lock your windows and doors when you close them, you’ll improve the seal. 
Granted, this isn’t a real big deal, but every little bit helps. 
Do All Your Laundry at Once
Never do a partial load of laundry; it wastes energy. Fill up the machine. Even 
if the machine has a switch that adjusts for smaller loads, it isn’t nearly as 
energy-efficient as washing a full load.
Always dry loads consecutively in your clothes dryer to take advantage of 
residual heat. When your dryer is cold, it takes a considerable amount of heat 
just to warm the machine up.
 
Clean the dryer filter before every load. Doing so is easy and makes a huge dif-
ference in terms of energy consumption.

Skip the Dishwasher Drying Cycle
Believe it or not, you don’t have to use the drying cycle on your dishwasher. 
Your clean dishes will dry very nicely, thank you, if you simply open the 
machine up, especially in the summer.
 
When it’s very hot, use a fan to exhaust the humidity out of a nearby open 
window. Aim the fan out the window so that the humidity is sucked right out 
as soon as possible.
Plant a Tree Where It Counts
For around $30, you can buy a small deciduous tree in healthy, vigorous con-
dition. Plant it in front of your big picture window so that it shades the sum-
mertime sun and allows for sunshine in the winter.
Depending on how fast the tree grows, payback is between five and ten years, 
which may not be rapid but is one of the best ways to increase your energy 
efficiency. You can’t do any better than planting a tree in your yard.

 Identifying the best money-making propositions in solar power
 Making your house look a lot better
 Creating a more comfortable home environment
I
n my estimation, solar power is the best way to invest in energy efficiency. 
Your personal situation dictates the type of solar investment that’s best 
for your own home, but there are some projects that stand out for being sen-
sible and practical, in both monetary and aesthetic terms. In this chapter, I 
give you my list of the ten best solar investments, based on my own personal 
experience, as well as feedback from many others who have worked with 
solar energy.
 
Using solar energy to increase efficiency doesn’t always require solar technol-
ogy or equipment. Many times, it just requires that you take advantage of the 
sunshine that comes naturally into your home and yard.
PV Systems
Photovoltaic (PV) systems are the grande dame of solar investments and are 
going to experience hyper growth over the coming years. You can get a feel 
for just how much humans impact the environment when you realize that, 
on average, economically active Americans are responsible for nearly 40,000 
pounds of carbon dioxide per capita. You don’t need to be a politically active 
environmentalist to come to the conclusion that we need to do a lot better. 
Nor do you need to believe in global warming.
PV systems offset the most carbon pollution because so much inefficiency is 
inherent in our electrical power grid. For each kWh of energy you create with a 
PV system, you are saving five or six times that much utility-generated power, 
most of which comes from coal-fired plants in North America. PV systems 
allow for tremendous environmental leverage, and that will never change.

336
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Strictly from a monetary standpoint, PV systems are becoming increasingly 
competitive, and as energy rates rise, they will eventually become extremely 
good investments. For more information on PV systems, head to Chapter 16.
Solar Swimming Pool Heaters
The average swimming pool costs around $20,000 to install. It takes up a big 
chunk of your back yard, and requires a lot of maintenance. Swimming pool 
chemicals are expensive, and you have to measure the water all the time 
for chemical balances. Chlorine and sunshine tend to eat pool equipment, 
particularly the plastics that are so common, so equipment lifetimes are lim-
ited. You need to clean the filter periodically, and occasionally you need to 
empty the pool out and start over, which makes a big impact on your water 
bill. The bottom line is, a swimming pool is quite a luxury item, probably the 
most expensive luxury you will ever purchase.
If you’re going to put this much time and energy into a pool, one of your goals 
is likely to be extending the swim season as much as you can, and that means 
using a pool heater. When you install a heating system on your swimming 
pool, simply put, you can use your pool three or four times more than with-
out a heater. The water will be much more comfortable, and you’ll be able to 
swim over a longer season.
Of the kinds of heaters available — propane, electric, and solar — go for the 
solar heater. From a pollution standpoint, a solar heater is ideal (zero pol-
lution) compared to the sinful alternatives (propane and electric). After the 
initial investment, solar heaters are also less costly to operate: Try nothing 
compared to what you have to pay to power a propane or electric heater. 
And although you can extend your swim season with a non-solar heater, keep 
in mind that the cost of heating the water will rise as the temperature falls.
Solar Water Heaters
Solar water heaters, when properly designed and installed, are great invest-
ments. Most people can afford a few thousand dollars for a solar water heater 
system without taking out loans. You can find do-it-yourself kits that work 
with existing water heaters, so you can keep your investment down in that 
way as well.
You can install a very simple batch-type system. Kits are available that allow 
you not only to do the installation yourself, but also to build the collector 
yourself. Alternatively, you can find designs for nominal fees and build the 
entire system completely from scratch for less than a few hundred dollars.

337
 Chapter 25: Ten Best Solar Investments
A big benefit of a solar water heater is that you never need to conserve on 
hot water, regardless of how high energy rates go. From a pollution stand-
point, water heating typically comprises around 18 percent of your power 
bill, so you can save exactly that much from your carbon footprint.
If you are on a tiered rate structure, a solar water heater cuts into the most 
expensive part of your power bill first. For example, if you save 18 percent of 
the electrical energy you use, you may be able to save closer to 30 percent of 
your total power bill (see Chapter 5 for more details).
PV systems are more popular than solar water heaters, but new plastics have 
been developed that are going to change this. Look for new technologies, and 
you’ll find one that is ideal for your own application.
Solar Yard Lights
For very little cost, you can put a whole range of fun and interesting lights 
around your yard. They charge during the daylight hours, and they come 
on at night. You’ll be surprised at how little sunlight they need, given the 
amount of light they put out.
Unlike low-voltage systems, which require very thick gauge wires that you 
need to run around your yard, solar lighting is as simple as one, two, three. 
And if you don’t like the way things look, changing the layout is as simple as 
four, five, six.
 
Try both the static lights and the little, changing-color decorative lights. You 
can get a whole range of different mounting schemes, so you can put them 
anywhere.
My experience is that solar yard lights don’t need to be in any direct sunlight 
at all. Put them under a tree and they’ll work. And you can get a light that has 
a PV panel connected to the light itself by means of a wire, so you can put the 
PV panel in direct sunlight, and the light under your porch roof.
Window Blinds
Windows are a major source of heat transfer. In the summer, windows let in 
too much heat energy. In the winter, windows allow a lot of heat to escape. 
Your house would be much more energy efficient if there were no windows at 
all. But this is absurd. After all, windows attract a lot of attention (they break 
up walls, which are monotonous) and they’re a source of natural sunlight. 

338
Part V: The Part of Tens 
The eye is naturally drawn to a window, particularly a big window in your 
family room or living room. The solution? Put in window blinds that have 
good insulation.
Window blinds make a big difference in the overall tone of your home. With 
the right blinds, you can significantly reduce heat transfer as well as reflect 
most incident sunlight. The functional effect is dramatic. The aesthetic effect 
is even more so, if you choose the right ones.
 
The best candidates for window blinds are large windows in family rooms and 
living rooms. They’ll give you the most bang for the buck. Go to Chapter 12 for 
details on how to use blinds and other window covering for energy efficiency.
Overhangs
By judiciously using overhangs, described in Chapter 12, you can make your 
home more comfortable and save on your power bill at the same time. By 
shading your southern windows appropriately, you can increase the natural 
lighting in your home in the winter, when you want as much light as possible, 
and decrease it in the summer (lots of light makes you feel warmer).
A well-designed overhang over a porch or sunroom minimizes temperature 
variations. Nobody likes a home where the temperature swings wildly over 
the course of a day. And temperature variations tend to make materials swell 
and shrink, which causes cracking and premature wear.
Overhangs are very reasonable do-it-yourself projects. You don’t need elec-
trical or plumbing experience. Rarely do extraordinary weight requirements 
entail the use of a professional engineer. And if you keep things modest, you 
don’t need to get a county building permit or permission from a neighbor-
hood association design committee (who would probably love your pro-
posed project anyway).
Sunrooms
Sunrooms let you increase the usable square footage of your house cheaply, 
with maximum functional effect. They also allow you to use the natural heat 
from the sun to heat your home, which is very energy efficient. A sunroom 
can be added onto an existing home for far less cost than a conventional 
room. You can put in nearly any size room you want, and do-it-yourself kits 
are straightforward and well-designed. You can build one out of aluminum,

 Chapter 25: Ten Best Solar Investments
wood, or even plastic corrugated materials that cost very little. You can also 
put in any number of windows you want. You can install a wall of windows, or 
just a few. You can incorporate a concrete floor (for maximum thermal mass) 
or you can use an existing wooden or synthetic deck.
If you do it right, you can build a sunroom without getting a building permit 
(forego electric power and don’t connect it rigidly to your house). If you insu-
late it well, you’ll have a family room for about one-fifth the cost of adding a 
conventional room to your house. Go to Chapter 12 for details.
Swimming Pool Covers
Okay, I can hear the howls of indignation over this one. Swimming pool 
covers are a big hassle. But for the amount they cost compared to what 
they can save, they’re actually a great deal. Swimming pool covers basically 
accomplish the same thing that solar pool heaters do (see the earlier section 
“Solar Swimming Pool Heaters”) but cost about 3 percent as much.
If you’re in a climate where you don’t need a pool heater over the course of 
the summer, you can extend your swimming season a month or so at both 
the beginning and end of the season by using a cover then and only then.
Retracting mechanisms are available that work well enough to prevent you 
from hating your cover because you have to fold it up by hand every time 
you want to use the pool. The cheapest manual retractors cost around $300. 
You can install an electric retractor, but then you’re starting to talk about the 
kind of money you spend on solar water heaters, so you may as well put in a 
solar water heater instead.
Solar Attic Vent Fans
Solar attic vent fans are an easy do-it-yourself project with potentially big 
results. If you’ve ever gone into your attic space on a hot summer day, 
you know what real heat is all about. It can get so hot that it’s dangerous. 
Temperatures over 160°F are not uncommon.
All that heat stays up there all night, and it tries to go through the insulation 
in your ceiling, down into your house. Most homes have passive, natural 
venting schemes designed into the attic space, but older homes didn’t really 
give it much thought, and newer homes tend to solve the problem with 
increased R-values of insulation. Imagine getting that heat out of the attic.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
A properly designed solar attic vent fan can move a lot of air (see Chapter 13) 
over the course of a day. The system works hardest when you want it to, 
when there’s a lot of hot sunshine. You don’t need to run expensive house-
hold electrical power up to the fan’s location (the electricity comes from a 
low voltage PV panel instead), which means you can install one just about 
anywhere you want, and without worrying about codes or inspections or 
building permits.
As a do-it-yourself solar project, installing a solar attic vent fan is ideal because 
you get to use some PV panels, which is fun (if your definition of fun is cool 
hardware). You won’t get any electrical shocks from the low voltages that PV 
panels provide (compared to the high voltages used in conventional house 
wiring), and the tools required are minimal. You can do a project in a single 
day, and you can learn a lot about your house by studying the layout and 
functionality of your attic.
For a few hundred bucks, you can do something really nifty and make a big 
difference.
Landscaping
Okay, landscaping isn’t strictly solar, if what you’re looking for is technology 
that grabs sunlight and makes it go to work in a constructive way. But we 
don’t always need to grab photons and train them to get the most benefit out 
of the sun. Landscaping is the hands-down winner as the best solar project 
because you get so much in return:
 
 Planting hearty, healthy, happy, deciduous trees in the right locations 
around your house gives you cooler summers and warmer winters, but 
most of all, you can look out your windows and be reminded of why you 
care so much about the planet Earth.
 
 Planting bushes, shrubs, and trees as windbreaks allows you to enjoy 
natural breezes in your home, without the sound of whirring fan blades 
to remind you of technology.
 
 Plants create oxygen out of carbon dioxide, the modern bugaboo of envi-
ronmentalism. If there were enough trees in this world, global warming 
would not be such an imposing issue.
 
 Putting in landscaping yourself gets you outdoors and exercising. 
There’s a certain simplicity to digging a hole. It’s about as close to 
nature as you can get, and that in itself is justification.
