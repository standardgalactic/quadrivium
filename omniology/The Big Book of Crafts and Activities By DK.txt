Bedroom makeover
Bulletin boards are great for collecting your favorite odds 
and ends: photos, sketches, notes—anything you like! The best 
part is picking your fabric and making your bulletin board look beautiful.

The fabric  
needs to go  
at the bottom
The batting goes 
between the board 
and fabric
The board needs 
to be right

2.  Fold the batting and fabric up at 
one side and get an adult to staple it 
in the middle. Do this for all four 
sides, making sure it’s pulled tight.
1.  In order, put the fabric, the 
batting, and the bulletin board down 
on a ﬂat surface. Lay the bulletin 
board with the cork side facedown.
3.  For the corners, tuck one side 
of the fabric down into the other 
and fold the other side up, as 
shown. Make sure it’s nice and neat.
4.  Once you’ve tucked in the corner 
neatly, get an adult to staple it in 
place on both sides. Do this for the 
other corners, too.

Use colored thumbtacks 
to match your fabric
You can make the ribbon run like this, too 
5.  Spread strips of ribbon across 
the front diagonally and tape them in 
place. Turn the board over and get  
an adult to staple the ribbon to it.
6.  Remove the tape and lay more 
ribbon across to create a pattern. 
Tape in place each time, and get an 
adult to staple it to the back.
7.  Push in thumbtacks where the 
pieces of ribbon meet to keep them 
in place. Now add whatever you want 
to feature on your bulletin board.

Now that you know how to make a  
basic bulletin board, get creative and add 
a frame. For even greater effect, choose 
one with lots of decoration and really 
make your bulletin board stand out.

the emulsion paint and let dry.
2.  Cut out the fabric and lay it 
underneath the cork tile, leaving some 
extra room on all sides to fold it over.
3.  Fold the fabric over the back, 
tuck in the corners, and staple them 
in place. Put your board in the frame.
If you’re using a staple 
gun, ask an adult to help

1.  Lay a wooden hanger out on a 
piece of paper and draw around it, 
leaving a gap of about 1in (2.5cm)  
all around.
2.  Carefully cut the shape out to 
create a template. You can use this 
template to decorate as many 
hangers as you like.
3.  Fold a piece of felt in half and 
pin the template to it. Cut around it 
so that you have two identical pieces 
of felt. Remove the pins.
4.  Cut a piece of batting that is 
smaller than the felt but bigger than 
the hanger. Lay it on top of the felt, 
then put the hanger on top.
6. Use the needle and thread to 
stitch the felt together. Ask an adult 
to help you with this. Remove the pins 
and decorate!
5.  Put another strip of batting and 
the other piece of felt on top of the 
hanger. Insert pins along the edges 
to keep everything in place.
Pretty clothes belong on a pretty hanger. Unfortunately, 
most hangers are boring. Luckily for you, you can 
decorate these hangers so they look as good as  
your clothes!

Bedroom makeover
When you’re in the process of giving your bedroom a 
makeover, a few posters will only go so far. If you have  
old furniture, you can give it a new lease on life with  
paint and decorations (if your parents agree!).

1.  Rub a plain old table with 
sandpaper to remove any rough 
spots. Wipe it with a cloth to 
get rid of dust, then paint it 
with a layer of primer paint. 
2.  Once the primer has dried, 
paint the table in your favorite 
colors using satin enamel paint 
and let dry. Try not to let any of 
the paint drip.
1.  Rub the chair with sandpaper, 
as above, and apply a layer of 
primer paint. Make sure you 
cover the chair completely, 
painting behind the legs, too.
2.  Paint the chair carefully 
with satin enamel paint. Make 
sure you get into all the corners 
so it looks neat and tidy.

Now that you’ve mastered decorating chairs and  
tables, try decorating a nightstand or dresser—that  
will really breathe new life into your bedroom. Here’s  
a suggestion for how to do it.

1.  Unscrew the knob. Use sandpaper 
to sand the furniture. Paint with primer 
and let dry. Paint with satin paint.
4.  Glue the cardboard to the side of 
the nightstand and then repeat this 
for the other side and the front.
2.  Once the paint has dried, measure 
the side panel with a ruler and cut out 
a piece of cardboard the same size.
5.  Cut out a circle of fabric to cover 
the knob. Put the knob in the middle of 
the fabric. Scrunch it around the knob.
3.  Lay the cardboard on top of your 
chosen fabric. Fold over the edges and 
either glue or staple them in place.
6.  Tie the fabric in place with narrow 
ribbon. Trim off excess fabric and 
screw the knob in place.

Adding a fabric picture to a plain old pillow is 
a great way to make it stand out. Here’s how 
to make one with a strawberry motif—but you

1.  Neatly draw your strawberry on 
a piece of paper and place the fusible 
webbing on top. Trace around the 
strawberry and cut it out.
2.  Ask an adult to iron the fusible 
webbing shapes onto colored fabric. 
Use red for the strawberry and 
green for the leaves.
3.  Cut around the fabric and 
fusible webbing carefully. Try to be 
as neat as you can.
4. Lay your design with the fusible 
webbing side facedown on the pillow 
cover. Ask an adult to iron the shapes.
5.  Use a needle and thread to 
sew around your strawberry to  
add decoration and to help  
keep it in place.
6.  Sew green thread around the 
leaves and stalk. Use either white or 
yellow thread on the strawberry to 
make the seeds.

Face masks are a great way to 
refresh your skin. All you need 
are a few ingredients from 
home, such as bananas and 
honey! Apply the mask to your 
face and rinse it off with warm 
water after 10 minutes.
Avocado and honey
Mash an avocado and ½ cup honey in  
a bowl. Mix together until smooth.

1.  Pour the baking soda and 
citric acid into a large mixing bowl.
2.  Add several drops of food 
coloring and stir it in well. Use 
whatever color you like.
3.  Add the olive oil. Sprinkle it 
evenly over the surface of the 
mixture, rather than pouring it all in 
the middle.
4.  Add a few drops of your 
favorite scented oil. Lavender  
and vanilla work well. 
6.  Use the mist feature on the 
spray bottle to add a few squirts  
of witch hazel into the mixture.
5. Mix everything together with 
your hands, breaking up any big 
lumps you ﬁnd.
A lot of people add bubbles to their baths to make  
them more fun. But if you drop a bath bomb into the  
tub instead it will ﬁzz and pop, adding color and a lovely  
smell to the bathwater. That’s even better than bubbles!

taking it out every 5 minutes to stir.
3.  Wash your hands. Take about a 
teaspoon of the mixture at a time  
and roll it into balls. Work quickly  
so your hands don’t melt the trufﬂes!
4. Roll the trufﬂes in cocoa powder 
or coconut shavings and put each

middle. Cut a small pice of cardboard 
to use as a spool, as shown.
2.  Lay one of your plastic bags on 
its side. Cut off the bottom and the 
handles and smooth out any wrinkles.
3.  From the bottom of the bag, 
make cuts up to 1in (2.5cm) from 
the top, leaving 1in (2.5cm) gaps 
between the cuts.
4. Do the same from the top, 
making the cuts in between the strips 
you made already. As before, leave a 
1in (2.5cm) gap at the bottom.
5. Cut along the bottom and top of 
the bag, leaving the top right corner 
untouched. You’ll be left with one long 
strip to wrap around the spool.
6.  Put the two rings together and 
wrap the plastic around them until 
you run out. Use the spool to help 
thread the plastic through the hole.

cardboard rings. Don’t cut all the  
way through to the middle.
8.  Wrap string between the rings 
and pull it tight. Tie a tight knot. The 
string should squeeze the plastic 
into the gap in the ring.
9.  Cut or pull off the cardboard 
rings. Fluff the pom-pom and trim 
off any excess string.
You can use your pom-poms  
to decorate clothes, shoes, or bags. 
Dancers and cheerleaders can use 
them to shake in their routines.

Growing your own fruits and vegetables isn’t 
difﬁcult. With a little patience and tender loving 
care, you’ll have fresh lettuce, carrots, tomatoes, 
and potatoes to use in your recipes. 
Fill small pots with seed 
compost and use a pencil to 
make ½in (1cm) trenches. 
Sprinkle lettuce seeds into the 
trenches and cover them with 
soil. Water the seeds regularly 
and after about 10 weeks you 
will have lettuce to harvest!

Plant seed potatoes in holes  
6in (15cm) deep and 12in 
(30cm) apart in the ground. 
Make sure they are in a place 
that gets a lot of light. Water 
regularly and after 20 weeks, 
dig up one of the plants to see 
if the potatoes are ready.
Fill a deep pot with potting soil. Make a ½in 
(1cm) trench and ﬁll it with carrot seeds. Cover 
them with soil and water regularly. After about 
two weeks, small seedlings will grow. If the pot  
is crowded, pick some out. 
Cut an egg carton in half. Fill it with potting soil and 
push a few tomato seeds into each egg cup. Water 
them regularly and after about two weeks transfer any 
seedlings to their own pots. Put a stake into the soil 
next to each plant and tie the stem to it as it grows.
It will be 20 weeks before you can pick your tomatoes
Carrots take about 12 weeks to grow

Ginger
A common ingredient in South Asian cooking, ginger goes well 
with vegetables and chicken. It is also tasty in cookies and cakes!
Cinnamon
Popular at Christmastime (and all year round!), cinnamon is 
used to ﬂavor sweet and savory foods.
Vanilla
Ice creams and desserts are often vanilla-ﬂavored. Vanilla gives 
sweet foods a lovely ﬂavor and smell. 
Paprika
Fiery red in color, paprika adds a hot, spicy zing to foods.
Black pepper
Used to season savory dishes, every table has salt and pepper!
Thyme
Thyme is fairly strong, so add only a little to stews and barbecues.
Mint
Used frequently in Greek cooking, mint goes well with yogurt 
and lamb. It also makes delicious tea!
Lemongrass
This strongly ﬂavored herb is found in many Thai dishes.
Dill

Watch it grow
Did you know that you can grow delicious 
strawberries in your backyard? Planting 
them in a pot is ﬁne, but where’s the fun 
in that? A pair of old rain boots works just 
as well and looks so much prettier.

1.  Ask an adult to cut a hole on 
each side of the boots (one higher 
than the other). Each hole should be 
about the size of the plant’s root ball.
2.  Put a little gravel in the bottom 
of each boot to allow for drainage. 
Add soil until it’s level with the ﬁrst 
hole in the side.
3. Push a plant sideways into the 
ﬁrst hole, then ﬁll the boot with 
more soil. When you reach the 
second hole, put in the second plant.
4. Place a third plant into the top of 
the boot. Level the soil and press 
down ﬁrmly. Repeat the process with 
the other boot. Water both boots well.
5. Cover the surface of the boots 
with broken eggshells to keep slugs 
away. Feed the plants with tomato 
food every week.
6. Cover the sides of the boots in 
petroleum jelly so slugs and snails 
can’t crawl up the sides. Make sure 
to water your plants regularly.

from a variety of foods to stay healthy.  
You need foods from all the groups shown

Dairy products
Cheese, butter, and milk contain 
protein, vitamins, and minerals, 
which are very good for you, 
particularly for your growing 
bones. They are high in fat, so 
you only need a small amount.
Fats and sugar
Fats such as olive oil, butter, and 
cheese help with digestion and 
contain important fatty acids 
that your body needs. Sugar is 
a source of energy and is found 
in cakes, cereals, and chocolate.
Protein
Foods such as meat, ﬁsh, nuts, 
eggs, and legumes help your 
body make new cells and repair 
tissue. An egg for breakfast 
and ﬁsh for dinner would meet 
your daily protein needs.

39
Carbohydrates
These are your main source of 
energy. You ﬁnd them in bread, 
pasta, rice, potatoes, and fruit.
Protein
Used by your body to grow new 
cells and repair itself, protein is 
found in meat, poultry, ﬁsh, 
legumes, and dairy products.
Fats
A good source of energy while you 
are growing, fat is found in dairy 
products, red meats, cakes, 
cookies, and ﬁsh.
Fiber
Found in cereals, bread, vegetables, 
and fruit, ﬁber helps your body 
digest food.
Minerals
Different minerals have different 
uses. Calcium is important for 
healthy bones, and iron is good  
for your blood. They’re found in  
lots of foods, but are especially 
common in fruits and vegetables.
Vitamins
Vitamins help to keep your body 
healthy, especially your teeth and 
skin. They’re mostly found in dairy 
products, fruits, and vegetables.

Starchy foods
Pasta, rice, and potatoes are 
full of carbohydrates, which  
are a good source of energy. 
They’re also full of vitamins, 
minerals, and ﬁber. They should 
make up about one-third of 
your diet.
Fruits and vegetables
You should try to eat lots of 
fruits and vegetables. They 
taste fantastic and are full of 
the vitamins and minerals that 
your body needs. Which fruits 
and veggies are your favorites?

Hosting a sleepover, but  
stuck for things to do? There are 
so many great games you 
 can play—take your pick!
Spin the polish
Ask everyone to bring a favorite 
nail polish and place all the nail 
polish in a basket. Roll a die—
this will be the number  
of nails painted. Select a polish 
and spin the bottle. Who is 
chosen? Paint the correct 
number of nails in this color.
Dance idols
Split everyone into small 
teams and make up dances 
to your favorite music. Draw 
score cards on paper and 
get the other teams to 
watch and judge. Will you 
have the X-factor?

Makeover madness
Place lots of makeup in the 
center of a circle. On the 
count of three, each person 
grabs what she can. Next, 
everyone chooses a partner. 
One partner is blindfolded and 
tries to apply makeup to the 
other partner. Now swap!

41
Sleepover games
Two truths and a lie
Everyone has to think up two truths 
and one lie about themselves. Take 
turns presenting all three to the 
other partygoers and see if anyone 
can discover which “fact” is the lie— 
it’s harder than you think! Give 
candy to the winner, or treat  
her to a deluxe manicure. 
Smoothie sensation
You’ll need a blender, plain yogurt, 
and bowls of different fruits, such 
as strawberries, blueberries, and 
bananas. Blend the different fruits 
with the yogurt. Which smoothie 
tastes the best?
Grab that spoon!
Put as many spoons as players, 
minus one, on a table and deal 
the cards. The dealer discards 
a card, then the player on her 
left picks it up and discards 
one of hers. If you match four 
cards you take a spoon. Last 
person to get a spoon loses!
Movie trivia
Before the sleepover, pick a 
movie to watch and write 
down trivia questions about 
it. Once your friends arrive, 
watch the movie. When it’s 
ﬁnished, have a contest to 
see who can answer the 
most questions correctly.
Scary stories
Turn out all the lights and have 
everyone sit in a circle. Take turns 
telling your scariest ghost stories. 
Who’s the biggest scaredy cat?

If you’re eating in Hong Kong you 
might not want to ﬁnish your entire 
meal, or the host will think he 
hasn’t provided enough food!
Choose carefully when buying 
ﬂowers in Russia—a yellow bouquet 
can mean that you no longer want 
to be friends with someone.
In most countries burping is 
considered very rude, but in China 
it can be a way of showing that 
you have enjoyed your meal.
Austrians consider it very impolite 
to be late, but in Mexico it’s not a 
problem to show up a short while 
after you’re expected.
In many countries it’s common to 
eat your meals using only your 
ﬁngers—but you should only use 
your right hand to eat.
If you’re visiting other countries 
be careful where you point. 
Pointing can be considered bad 
manners and a sign of anger.
It’s not just food that’s different around the

people don’t eat or drink during the day. 
During Eid ul-Fitr, families and friends feast

1. Start by writing your name at the 
bottom of a large piece of paper. You 
will probably have to do a few versions 
of your family tree, so don’t worry 
about making it neat from the start.
2. If you have brothers and 
sisters, draw a horizontal line above 
your name and write their names 
under it, with the oldest on the left 
and youngest on the right.
If you want to be thorough, 
you can also add everyone’s 
date of birth!

3. Draw another line upward from 
the middle of the line. At the top, 
draw a short horizontal line and 
write the names of your parents 
next to it, with your dad on the left, 
and your mom on the right.
4. If your parents have brothers 
and sisters, draw a horizontal line 
above your parents’ names and write 
the names of your aunts and uncles 
underneath, just as you did for your 
own brothers and sisters.
5. Draw lines down from your 
aunts’ and uncles’ names and 
write the names of any cousins 
you have there. Remember to 
put the oldest person on the left 
and the youngest on the right.
6. Repeat this process with your 
grandparents, great-grandparents, 
and any other family members you 
have until you have ﬁlled in your 
tree as much as possible.
If your tree is looking messy 
and you’re having trouble 
ﬁtting everything in, start over 
until you are happy with it.
 
Ask your 
parents if they can 
help you ﬁll out more. 
After all, it’s their

Customize your diary
1.  Choose a diary to decorate. You 
can use a brand new one, or if you 
already have one you can use that.
2.  Cut out the shape of a bird from 
felt. Cut out a smaller version for a 
wing. Sew a border around the bird, 
and then sew on the wing.
3.  Sew on a button for an eye, and 
glue your bird to your diary. Make legs 
from elastic and glue them under the 
bird. A mini clothespin makes a beak.
4. Make a loop in a piece of elastic 
and wrap it around the toggle. Thread 
the ends back through the loop, and 
secure the loop in place.
6.  Glue the elastic and felt to the 
inside of the front cover. Once it has 
dried, decorate your diary with 
beads, buttons, and sequins.
5.  Open the diary and position the 
toggle so that the elastic sits inside 
the front cover, as shown. Cut out a 
piece of felt big enough to cover it.
Writing in a diary is a great way of keeping a record 
of the things you’ve done, and it’s really fun to read 
what you’ve written each year. If your diary looks plain  
and dull, you can customize it with this cute bird design.

Pebble creatures
You can make cool creatures out of almost anything—even 
pebbles! The next time you’re at the beach or in the park 
look for pebbles in a variety of colors, patterns, and sizes.

•  Pebbles
•  Strong glue
•  Googly eyes 
•  Felt 
•  Acrylic paint
1.  Gather the things you will need and 
decide which animals you’re going to make. 
Wash the pebbles well to get rid of any dirt.
3.  For a mouse, add googly eyes. To make 
ears, cut out pieces of felt, pinch the ends 
together, and glue them in place. 
2. Glue pebbles in a line to make a 
caterpillar. It’s easy to make and you will 
become used to gluing pebbles together.
4.  Once you have ﬁnished one animal, try 
making other creatures. Look at your stones 
carefully. Which animals do they resemble?

•  Pebbles
•  Craft wire 
•  Buttons
•  Mini clothespins
1.  Gather all your materials together. If 
you like, you can paint your pebbles different  
colors before you start.
3.  Thread the wire back and forth through 
the holes, bending it each time to make the 
petal shapes.
2.  Thread craft wire through the holes in 
the button and twist it so that it stays in place.
4. Wrap the other end of the wire around a 
large, ﬂat pebble to form the base. Wrap it a 
few times so it holds ﬁrmly. Cut off any excess.
Cute animals aren’t the only things you can make from  
pebbles. You can use them to hold up pretty ﬂowers or even  
turn them into bases for funky photo frames.

1.  If you have colored 
frames, skip to step 2. 
Otherwise, get some  
plain frames and remove 
the backing and glass.  
Paint the frames with 
different colored acrylic 
paints (you might need 
two coats). Once the 
frames are dry, put the 
back and glass in again.
2.  Squeeze glue on the frame or ask an 
adult to put dots of glue on the frame with a 
glue gun. Stick on the pom-poms.
3.  Decide how you want to decorate your 
frames. Experiment with materials such as fur 
trim, beads, glitter, felt, and stickers.

There’s nothing better than ice cream on a  
hot summer day. And the best ice cream is 
homemade. Here’s how to make your own.
Making ice cream
1.  Put the lemon zest and juice, 
blueberries, and granulated sugar in a 
pan. Bring the mix to a boil. Simmer  
5 minutes, or until the berries burst.
2.  Take the pan off the heat. Push 
the mixture through a strainer into a 
bowl so that you’re left with a smooth 
purple sauce. Discard the berries.
3.  While the sauce cools, beat the 
cream in a large mixing bowl until it 
starts to form soft peaks.
4. Add the yogurt and confectioners’ 
sugar and mix together until smooth. 
Stir in the cooled blueberry sauce.
5.  Pour the mixture into a freezer-
proof container and freeze for 5 hours. 
Use a fork to break up ice every hour.

1.  Soak the stakes overnight 
to make them ﬂexible. Wrap 
thread around two stakes 2in 
(5cm) from the ends, as shown.
4.  Put glue onto the bottom 
half of your frame. Lay the 
frame onto tissue paper, with 
the glue side down.
7. Repeat this with another 
piece of tissue paper. Where 
the two pieces meet, trim the 
paper and glue to the stake.
5.  Once the glue has dried, 
cut around the shape of the 
frame, leaving a border of 
about 2in (5cm).
2.  Bend one of the stakes 
toward the middle and secure 
it in place with the thread.  
Tie the thread very tightly.
6.  Cut the border into 
small strips and then fold 
them over the stake and 
glue them in place.
3. Finish the frame by 
attaching a stake to the other 
side. Add two more that link 
them to the top, as shown. 
8. Turn the kite over. Cut out 
a strip of tissue paper for 
the body and glue it in place. 
Add other pieces to decorate.

10. Glue the streamers to 
the bottom of the kite. Cut 
two lengths of kite string 2in 
(5cm) longer than your kite.
11. Tie one length around the 
stake at the bottom and the 
other to each side, making a 
small hole in the tissue paper.
12.  Tie the bottom string to 
the horizontal string and make  
a loop. Thread the rest of the

1.  Inﬂate a balloon, leaving 
about 4in (10cm) deﬂated, and tie a 
knot. Make a fold about 8in (20cm)  
away from the knot.
2.  Fold the tail again so the end lines up 
with the ﬁrst fold. The balloon should fold 
like a paperclip.
3.  Where all three parts 
meet—by the knot—twist 
everything together. You 
should have two loops  
and a tube sticking up,  
as shown.
4.  Pull one of the loops 
up through the other to 
make the body. The 
long tube will be 
the swan’s neck 
and head.
5.  Fold the neck away 
from the body, as shown.  
So it keeps this shape,  
hold it tightly and squeeze 
out some of the air.
Animal balloons are a hit at any party—and 
they’re a lot easier to make than it appears!

2.  Make a fold where the knot meets 
the twist, creating a loop. Then push the 
head (the bubble with the knot) through it.
3. Leave a gap, then make a 3in 
(7.5cm) bubble, two 1in (2.5cm) 
bubbles, and a 3in (7.5cm) bubble. 
Twist the last bubble into the ﬁrst 
one to make the front legs.
4.  Leave a gap about 3in (7.5cm) long 
for the body, then repeat what you did 
in step 3 to make the hind legs.
5.  Twist everything and 
straighten it out. Finally, squeeze 
the tail so that some of the air 
forms a bubble at the back.

the yeast mixture, the oil, and the 
remaining water, and mix well.
3. Put a little ﬂour on your hands 
and the work surface, and knead 
the dough for 10 minutes, until  
it’s smooth.
4. Place the dough in a large bowl 
and cover it with plastic wrap. Put it 
in a warm (not hot) place for an 
hour, or until it has doubled in size.
5. Preheat the oven to 425°F 
(220°C). Push your ﬁst into the dough 
to punch some of the air out of it. 
Then knead it for another 5 minutes.
6.  Put the dough in a greased loaf

The great thing about pizza is that 
by changing the toppings you can 
create pizzas with very different 
ﬂavors. Which one is your favorite?
1. Make the pizza dough from scratch 
(see pages 86-87). Roll it into disks 7in  
(18cm) across.
2. Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C). Spread 
the tomato purée over the dough. Add the 
toppings. Bake for 20 minutes, until golden.

wire on the right to make a wing.
4.  Twist the wing so that it stays 
in place. Repeat this for the bottom 
wing to complete the ﬁrst side.
6.  Twist the wires around the 
body a few times to keep the  
beads in place. Trim any excess  
wire with scissors.

side of the butterﬂy. Try to bend  
all four wings so they are similar in 
shape and size.
Hang butterﬂies and dragonﬂies from your blinds or curtains,  
or in your windows, where they can sparkle in the light. They  
also make pretty necklaces to give as gifts.

Going on trips is fun,  
but the car ride can be 
boring. Everyone has heard 
of “I spy,” but there are lots 
of other fun games to  
help pass the time.
Car pool
Take turns choosing a color 
(other than black or white). 
The goal is to spot seven cars 
of that color followed by a 
black one. If another player 
spots a white car before you 
ﬁnish, it becomes their turn!
Backseat bingo
Everyone makes a list of things 
they think they might see along 
the way, such as landmarks, 
animals, and signs. When each 
person sees something on their 
list they shout it out and cross 
it off the list. The winner is the 
ﬁrst person to see everything 
on their list.

117
Car trip games
 
City alphabet
Everyone takes turns naming towns  
or cities. Each town has to begin with the 
last letter of the one that came before it. So, 
if the ﬁrst city is New York, the next could 
be Kalamazoo. The game continues 
until someone gets stuck!
Alphabet challenge
Think of a theme, such as going 
grocery shopping. One player 
makes a statement ending with a 
word that starts in “a.” Other 
players takes turns adding things 
with the next letter. So the person 
starting says, “I went shopping 
and bought an apple.” The next 
person could add “banana,” and 
the third “cookies.” The goal is to 
make it all the way to “z.”

Dance mania
Get everyone to write a random 
word on a piece of paper, fold each paper, 
and put them all in a hat. Pass the hat around 
and everyone chooses a paper (if they choose 
their own word they have to pick again). Turn  
on some music and choose someone to start  
the game. Their job is to come up with a  
dance based on the word they picked. If  
the word was “bird” the dance could  
involve ﬂapping arms and strutting like  
a rooster. The game continues until 
everyone has invented a dance.  
Vote on who created the  
best dance.
Can you do  
the moonwalk?

119
Musical bingo
Lay out pieces of cardboard on 
the ﬂoor in a big circle. Write a number 
on each piece—one for every player. Write 
the same numbers on slips of paper and put 
them in a bag. Play music and have everyone 
dance around the circle. Stop the music  
and tell everyone stand on the piece  
of cardboard nearest them. Take a 
piece of paper from the bag and read out  
the number. Whoever is standing on that  
number leaves the game and takes  
their number with them. The last 
person left wins a prize!
Musical statues
Pick someone to be the judge.  
Their job is to play music while everyone 
else dances. After a few seconds the judge 
stops the music. When this happens, everyone 
freezes in place! If the judge sees anyone 
move, that person is out! The winner  
is the last player left.
Name that tune
Give everybody a piece of paper 
and have each person write the  
numbers 1–10 in a column. Play the  
ﬁrst 5 or 10 seconds of a song, then  
stop the music. Have everyone guess  
the name of the song and write it on  
the paper. Do this for 10 songs. 
Whoever gets the most  
right answers wins.

cut was made to  
stop the stem from 
splitting more.
3.  Fill the glasses with 
water. Add food coloring  
to one of them and mix. 
Stand the ﬂower in the 
glasses, with one half of  
the stem in each glass. In a 
few hours, half of the petals 
will have changed color.

How this works
Plants draw water from the soil 
through their roots. Water 
travels up the stem through a 
hollow tube called the xylem. In 
this case, as the water is drawn  
up from the glass the food 
coloring travels with it, dying the 
petals once it reaches the top.
Carnations and 
large daisies work 
very well for this
Because the stem is cut in 
half, the food coloring only 
travels up half the xylem, 
which is why all the ﬂower 
petals don’t change color.
Xylem

There are  
12 different star signs.  
This is because the Sun passes 
through 12 constellations in a year. 
Astrologers split these signs into four 
groups that share similar traits: 
Earth, ﬁre, air, and water. But each 
sign has its own unique traits 
and its own symbol (usually 
an animal).

Chinese 
horoscopes
Chinese astrology works differently. 
Again, there are 12 different signs, 
but each one is based on the year 
a person was born. So anyone 
born in 2013 would be born  
in the “Year of the 
Snake.”
