Graph Theory and 
Decomposition
The book Graph Theory and Decomposition covers major areas of the decompo-
sition of graphs. It is a three-part reference book with nine chapters that is aimed 
at enthusiasts as well as research scholars. It comprehends historical evolution 
and basic terminologies, and it deliberates on decompositions into cyclic graphs, 
such as cycle, digraph, and K4-e decompositions. In addition to determining the 
pendant number of graphs, it has a discourse on decomposing a graph into acyclic 
graphs like general tree, path, and star decompositions. It summarises another re-
cently developed decomposition technique, which decomposes the given graph 
into multiple types of subgraphs. Major conjectures on graph decompositions are 
elaborately discussed. It alludes to a comprehensive bibliography that includes 
over 500 monographs and journal articles. It includes more than 500 theorems, 
around 100 definitions, 56 conjectures, 40 open problems, and an algorithm. The 
index section facilitates easy access to definitions, major conjectures, and named 
theorems.
Thus, the book Graph Theory and Decomposition will be a great asset, we hope, 
in the field of decompositions of graphs and will serve as a reference book for all 
who are passionate about graph theory.

Preface
It is a trend in modern mathematics that, if you cannot solve a particular
problem, you can at least formulate a more general one, thus increasing the
amount of frustration in the world and keeping your colleagues on their toes.
(H¨aggkvist, 1989)
Graph theory is a subﬁeld of combinatorics that ﬁrst appeared a few cen-
turies ago but has since exploded due to technological advancements of many
kinds. The ability to model issues closely related to discrete objects into graphs
and then solve them more easily than with other mathematical tools is one of
graph theory’s biggest advantages.
Not only mathematical concepts like combinatorics, topology, algebra,
fuzzy, and cryptography, but also other ﬁelds of study like coding, crystal-
lography, designing, networking, social networking, communication systems,
computer studies, engineering, internet of things, economics, transportation
problems, chemical, and biological problems can all be solved using graph
models because of their attractive, simple, visible, clear, and elegant way of
presenting a situation or a problem. Graph theory simpliﬁes problems and
provides solutions, regardless of how simple or complex, concrete or abstract,
lively or dull, or whether they include issues with existence, enumeration,
evaluation, or optimization.
There are hundreds of various kinds of graph decomposition variants.
Among them, we chose a very few important ones from each of the cyclic,
acyclic, and multiple decompositions as representatives due to the limitations
of this monograph. We tried to include as many areas as we could so that
the reader may be able to go through the fascinating world of graph decom-
positions. Some solved conjectures as well as new ones are added so that the
reader gets a taste of both in a synchronized manner. Moreover, the reader
may be able to know how to solve a new conjecture by understanding the
solutions to solved conjectures, to improve the result, or to apply it in some
other areas of research, as it is given in Alspach’s Problem, Ringel’s Conjec-
ture, intersection problems, and so on in the monograph. As we know, almost
all types of decompositions are interconnected. So there may not be a clear
cut division among them. Therefore, there may be some overlapping among
the concepts.
This reference book contains short surveys on many areas of graph de-
composition. Many open problems are added along with their references so
that researchers can work on them. However, for some other concepts, we just
initiated the literature review to include certain areas of research. The book
ix

x
Preface
does not discuss much about products or other variants in graph decomposi-
tions.
The ﬁrst chapter gives an introduction to how the beautiful concepts in
graph theory emerge from ordinary life experiences and also throws light on
the basic concepts of graph theory for an unfamiliar reader and provides a
recapitulation for a familiar reader. The remaining part of the book is broadly
divided into three:
1.
Decompositions into Cyclic Graphs;
2.
Decompositions into Acyclic Graphs;
3.
Decompositions into Multiple Graphs.
The ﬁrst part consists of decompositions of graphs into cyclic graphs and
is divided into three chapters: cycle decompositions, digraph decompositions,
and K4 −e decompositions. The second part is a treatise on graph decomposi-
tions into various kinds of acyclic graphs and is divided into four chapters. It
includes various types of path, star, and other tree decompositions and also a
relatively new idea of the pendant number of graphs. The third part is a short
introduction to another emerging area of research, namely, the decomposition
of a graph into more than one type of graph; that is, decompositions of graphs
into multiple subgraphs.

Decompositions of Graphs: An Introduction
The poem written by William T. Tutte, a mathematician as well as poet, on
graph theory titled The Expanding Unicurse in 1969 can be seen as a concise
summary of the birth, growth, and development of graph theory. In this poem,
he mentions the stalwarts of graph theory. It starts with the following lines:
Some citizens of K¨onigsberg
Were walking on the strand...
The concept of the graph, consisting of vertices and edges, emerged as an
outcome of solving the then popular problem, namely, the K¨onigsberg bridge
problem by the great mathematician Leonhard Euler in 1736 using the geo-
metrical idea of position. The discourse on Eulerian graphs, that a nontrivial
connected graph G is Eulerian if and only if every vertex of G has an even
degree, is considered the starting point of graph theory. For Oystein Ore,
the peculiarity of the theory of graphs is that it is “one of the few ﬁelds of
mathematics with a deﬁnite birth date”. Exactly two hundred years after the
publication of the ﬁrst article on graph theory titled The Solution of a Prob-
lem Relating to the Geometry of Position by Euler, the ﬁrst concise book on
graph theory, Theoric der Endlichen und Unendlichen Graphen was written
by D´enes K¨onig in 1936 in German. He popularized and brought recognition
to graph theory. K¨onig started his lectures on graph theory with the words
“Graph theory is one of the most interesting of mathematical disciplines”.
Even though the ﬁrst monograph was too late to be published, the ideas of
graph theory gained prominence in various ﬁelds beforehand. The studies of
knight’s tour on the chess board by Vandermande, polyhedra by Kirkman,
trees by Cayley, and electric circuits by Kirchoﬀare a few examples. The
term graph, which is used in the present sense, was ﬁrst coined by Sylvester.
The second prominent book was Th´eoric des Graphes et Ses Applications
by Claude Berge in 1958. Berge introduced hyper-graphs and was instrumental
in propagating the practical applications as well as identifying the potentials
of graph theory. It is quite accidental but interesting that K¨onig and Berge
are the two pillars to whom the solutions to the famous K¨onig(s)-Berg bridge
problem (graph theory) owe much. Frank Harary, the graph theory giant, is
usually referred to as the Ambassador of Graph Theory. An elegant history of
graph theory until 1936 can be found in [89].

Graph Theory and Decomposition
For the same type of decomposition, numerous outcomes can be found on
diﬀerent graphs. Similarly, for the same graph, diﬀerent forms of decomposi-
tion are feasible. Further, graph decomposition results are used in a variety
of applications, including structural analysis, fault tolerance in network archi-
tecture, geometric pattern and texture detection in graphic design, identifying
speciﬁc patterns, summarizing and compressing graphs, graph similarity and
subgraph matching, studying the properties of large graphs, and so on.
Graph decomposition is the heart of graph theory. In a sense, decomposi-
tion is coloring; the coloring of edges by applying certain conditions is called
decomposition. Thus, the usual coloring (vertex coloring) of vertices using cer-
tain criteria results in vertex decomposition. There are a lot of monographs
available regarding vertex coloring or vertex decomposition. When one says
decomposition, one may usually refer to edge decompositions. Even though
there are thousands of articles published about various kinds of edge decom-
positions, only a handful of monographs are available about decomposition or
edge decomposition. The ﬁrst of this kind is Decompositions of Graphs by J.
Bos´ak. Another one worth mentioning is Graph Decompositions: A Study in
Inﬁnite Graph Theory by Reinhard Diestel. Both were published in 1990. In
our understanding, there has been no concise book discussing various aspects
of graph decompositions published thereafter. This book is a humble attempt
in this direction.
1.1
The Early Developments of Concepts of
Decompositions
The study of decomposition problems for graphs and hypergraphs has a long
history, dating back over two hundred years to Euler’s work on Latin squares.
In 1782, Euler asked for which values of n there is a Latin square that can
be decomposed into n disjoint transversals, which is equivalent to a graph
decomposition problem.
The origin of the problem of graph decompositions such as Steiner Triple
Systems (STS) dates back to the middle of the nineteenth century. In 1847,
as a reply to Prize Question 1733 posed by W S B Woolehouse in the Lady’s
and Gentleman’s Diary [497], which is stated as “Determine the number of
combinations that can be made of n symbols, p symbols in each; with this
limitation, that no combination of q symbols which may appear in any one
of them shall not be repeated in any other”, Rev.Thomas Kirkman solved
its associated problem. The associated problem reads like this [316]: “Fifteen
young ladies in a school walk out three abreast for seven days in succession; it
is required to arrange them daily, so that no two should walk twice abreast”.
He established that the necessary conditions for decompositions of complete
graphs into cycles of length three are also suﬃcient. However, according to

Decompositions of Graphs: An Introduction
3
De Vries [175], he had been preceded by Julius Pl¨ucker, who discussed what
later became known as STS in his books (see [403] and [404]) written in 1835
and 1839, respectively, which already contained the solution for S(2, 3, 9) =
STS(9). Jakob Steiner, a well-known mathematician, was possibly unaware
of the eﬀorts of Woodhouse and Kirkman, but according to De Vries [175], he
knew about Pl¨ucker’s books. In a paper published in 1853 [452], he mentioned
the question of the existence of the systems described above. Thus, these
systems came to be known as Steiner systems or STS. Kirkman [316] proved
that there is decomposition of Kn into three cycles if and only if n ≡1, 3 (mod
6). A complete solution to the schoolgirl problem was not found until 1971,
and the complete solution was given in 1971 by Ray-Chaudhuri and Wilson
[413].
Sir William Rowan Hamilton, an Irish mathematician, introduced the
game called The Icosian Game in 1857. It consists of a dodecahedron (a
polygon having 12 faces, 20 vertices, and 30 edges). The game is to ﬁnd a
circuit that passes through every point exactly once. Graph theoretically, it
is to ﬁnd a cycle C20 that passes through every vertex. Thus, a cycle that
passes through every vertex of a graph exactly once is named a Hamilton
cycle. Hamilaton-Waterloo Problem and Oberwolfach Problem are examples
of variations of Hamilton decomposition problems, where a lot of research is
going on currently.
According to Lucas, the one who invented the problem of Towers of Hanoi,
M. Walecki initiated the study of the Hamilton cycle decomposition of graphs
by the well-known Walecki construction while solving the Les Rondes Enfan-
tines (Children’s Rounds) [368]. Both the problem and the solution are ex-
plained in R´ecr´eations math´ematiques written by Lucas in 1883 [368]. The
problem is as follows: Children dance in circles holding hands. One may ask
how children should be arranged so that each of them is successively next to
all the others, either on the right or on the left, but it can only be done once.
It can be observed ﬁrst of all that, in each circular disposition, a child has two
neighbors, one on the right and the other on the left; consequently, since two
children cannot be more than once next to each other, the number of succes-
sive neighbors of any child will always be even; therefore, for the problem to
be possible, the total number of children must necessarily be an odd number.
It therefore remains to show that, when the number of children is odd and
equal to 2n + 1, they can be entered into n successive rounds, but in such a
way that the condition required by the statement is always satisﬁed.
The study of puzzles like the above-mentioned ones served as the founda-
tion for the entire discipline of combinatorics, particularly graph theory and
design theory. Even though the direct problem has been solved, there may
be a lot of unsolved related problems in connected ﬁelds. That is why a lot
of conjectures are included in this book, even if they seem to be solved. Fur-
thermore, solving a conjecture is not the end of research. The same problem
can be extended to other dimensions. For example, though the intersection
problem for K4 −e designs was settled by Billington et al. [94], another team

led by her [97] extended it to triangle intersections, and Chang et al. [148]
extended it to ﬁne triangle intersections (see Chapter 4).
Graph decompositions are a topic with numerous conjectures and chal-
lenging problems, making signiﬁcant contributions to structural graph theory.
Studying these decompositions helps discover partial or complete solutions to
open problems. There are so many historical events lying behind the birth of
each and every decomposition problem. Every decomposition problem starts
with seemingly simple puzzles or straightforward problems. However, upon
closer inspection, mathematicians ﬁnd priceless gems therein that could be
inexhaustible for decades. While trying to solve a puzzle, it puzzled the graph
theorists more and more, and he or she sought shelter in some other conjec-
tures. Thus, each and every area of graph theory is ﬁlled with conjectures.
These conjectures are good sources for enthusiastic researchers. Conjectures
are, in reality, gateways to the magical world of open problems. That’s why
the book is ﬁlled with a lot of conjectures and open problems.
1.2
Basic Terminologies
The basic terminologies of graph theory, which are closely related to our dis-
courses, are covered in this section. Occasionally, equivalent terms and nota-
tions are used interchangeably.
Graph: The graph G(V, E) is deﬁned as an ordered pair (V (G), E(G)),
where V (G) is called the vertex set and E(G) is called the edge set. Each
element of the ﬁnite non-empty set V (G) is called the vertex, and every element
in E(G) is called the edge of the graph G. Every edge can be considered a
2-element subset of V (G). Let u, v ∈V (G), and if the edge {uv} ∈E(G),
it can be represented as uv or vu. If the context is clear, then the notations
G, V , and E can be used instead of G(V, E), V (G), and E(G), respectively.
Sometimes, the terms points or nodes are used for vertices and lines for edges
as synonyms. If the edge e = uv, then u and v are said to be adjacent vertices
or they are called neighbors. In this case, the vertex u (of course, the vertex
v too) and the edge e are said to be incident with each other. Let u ∈V (G).
Then, N(u) represents the set of all neighbors of u. If two edges are connected
to the same vertex, then these edges are said to be adjacent edges. The number
of vertices in G, |V (G)| = n(G) = n, is also known as the order of G, and the
number of edges |E(G)| = e(G) = m(G) = m as the size of G. A graph of
order n and size m may be referred to as a (n, m)-graph. If the given graph
has only one vertex, then it is called a trivial graph. A labeled graph is the
one whose vertices and edges are labeled so that the structure of it can be
studied in detail. Let G and H be two graphs such that they have no vertex
in common. Then, both are called disjoint graphs. If they have no edge in
common, then they are called edge disjoint graphs. An edge is considered a

loop if it connects a vertex to itself. If two or more pairs of edges join the same
pair of distinct vertices, those edges are called parallel or multiple edges. A
graph is called a simple graph if it has neither loops nor parallel (multiple)
edges. If the given graph has a ﬁnite number of vertices and edges, it is called
a ﬁnite graph. Throughout this book, graph refers to a simple and ﬁnite graph
unless speciﬁed otherwise.
Subgraph: If G and H are two graphs such that V (H) ⊆V (G) and
E(H) ⊆E(G), then H is called the subgraph of G or it is said that G contains
H. It is denoted as H ⊆G. H is called a spanning subgraph of G if V (H) =
V (G). If u, v ∈V (H) and e = uv ∈E(G)
=⇒
e = uv ∈E(H) for every
u, v ∈V (H), then H is said to be an induced subgraph of G. If v ∈V (G), it
is said that the induced subgraph G −v is obtained by removing the vertex v
and the edges incident with it. Similarly, if e ∈E(G), the spanning subgraph
G −e with edge set E(G) −e is obtained by removing a single edge e. If a
vertex is added to the given graph G, it is expressed as G + v and if an edge
is added, it is expressed as G + e.
Path: If u and v are two vertices in G, then a u −v walk is an alternating
sequence of vertices and edges. It is also described as a sequence of adjacent
vertices in G, which starts at u and ends at v. If u = v, then it is said to be
a closed walk. In a walk, the vertices and edges need not be distinct. If all
the edges in the walk are distinct, then it is called a trail. Again, a trail with
all its vertices distinct is known as a path. Hence, every path is a trail, and
every trail is a walk, but the converse need not be so. The number of edges
counted (including the repeated ones) in a walk, trail, or path is called the
length of the walk, trail, or path, respectively. Let G be a graph and Pn be a
path in it. Then, Pn is said to be a path with n vertices and n −1 edges (i.e.,
a path of length n−1). Paths of length zero are assumed to have two identical
end vertices. Let the vertices of Pn be v1, v2, . . . , vn. Then, v2, v3, . . . , vn−1 are
the internal vertices and v1, vn are the external vertices or end vertices of the
path. A path Pn is an induced path if the induced subgraph of the given graph
G is the path Pn itself.
Cycle: A closed trail of minimum length three in a graph G is known as a
circuit. A circuit starts and ends at the same vertex, and as mentioned earlier
for trail, no edge can be repeated. If it does not repeat the vertices other than
the starting and ending, say v1, then the circuit becomes a cycle, and this
vertex v1 is sometimes referred to as the origin of the cycle. A cycle of length
n is called an n-cycle and is denoted as Cn. A cycle Cn is called odd or even
depending on whether n is odd or even. Note that both the number of vertices
and edges of a cycle Cn is n. If G contains only one cycle, then G is a unicyclic
graph. The cycle Cn is an induced cycle if the induced subgraph of the given
graph G is Cn itself. The cycle of length 3 is referred to as a triangle, and if
G contains no triangles, then G is a triangle-free graph.
Connectedness: A graph G is said to be connected if every pair of its
vertices is joined by some paths. Otherwise, the graph G is said to be discon-
nected. A component of G is a connected subgraph, but it cannot be a proper
subgraph of other connected subgraphs of G. The number of components of

Graph Theory and Decomposition
a graph G is denoted by ω(G). The necessary and suﬃcient condition for G
to be connected is that it must have one and only one component. Let G be
a graph of order 3 or more. Then G is 2-connected if and only if, for any two
distinct vertices u and v of G, there are two internally disjoint u −v paths
in G. Let e ∈E(G). Then, G −e ⊂G such that V (G −e) = V (G) and
E(G −e) = E(G) −e. Similarly, the subset X ⊂E(G) leads to G −X ⊂G
possessing V (G −X) = V (G) and E(G −X) = E(G) −X. Let G be a con-
nected graph, and if G−e is disconnected, then the edge e = uv of G is called
a bridge of G. If an edge e is a bridge of some component, then it is a bridge
of that disconnected graph. If v is an end-vertex of a connected graph, then
G −v is connected. An edge e cannot be a bridge if it lies on a cycle.
Distance: Let G be a connected graph with n(G) = n, and let u, v ∈V .
Then, the length of the shortest u−v path in G is called the distance between
u and v. It is denoted as dG(u, v) or simply d(u, v), if the context is clear.
The eccentricity of a vertex u is the distance between u and a vertex farthest
from u in G. The minimum eccentricity is called radius, which is denoted as
rad(G), and the maximum eccentricity is called diameter, which is denoted
as diam(G).
Complete Graph: A complete graph Kn is a graph of order n whose every
pair of vertices is adjacent. For the particular value of a positive integer n,
Kn has the maximum number of edges. Since every distinct vertex is adjacent
in Kn, the number of edges of Kn is |E(Kn)| = m(Kn) =

. An
induced subgraph of a graph G is referred to as a clique if it is a complete
graph. The largest clique in G is indicated by its clique number.
Complement: The graph with the same set of vertices as graph G is the
complement, denoted by G, such that for each u, v ∈V (G), uv ∈E(G) if and
only if uv /∈E(G). In a graph of order n, V (G) = V (G) and G∪G = Kn. Thus,
|E(G)| + |E(G)| =

. Hence, while n(G) = n and m(G) = m, n(G) = n and

−m. Therefore, the empty graph Kn has n vertices and no edges.
If G ∼= G, then G is called self complementary. Hence, in self-complementary
graphs, m(G) = m(G) if m(G) =

. Note that either 4|n or
4|(n −1) (equivalently either n ≡0 (mod 4) or n ≡1 (mod 4)) makes n(n−1)

an integer.
Bipartite Graph: A graph G is said to be a bipartite graph if its vertex
set V can be partitioned into two distinct subsets V1 and V2 known as the
partite sets, such that every edge has one of its ends in V1 and the other in
V2. In other words, no two vertices in V1 are adjacent, and no two vertices in
V2 are adjacent. A graph is called bipartite if its components are bi-parted,
and it contains no odd cycles. In a bipartite graph, if every vertex of a partite
set is adjacent to every vertex of the other partite set, then it is called the
complete bipartite graph or as a biclique and is denoted as Kx,y or Ky,x, where
x = |V1| and y = |V2|. Note that |E(Kx,y)| = m(Kx,y) = xy.
Complete Multipartite Graph: The class of partitioning of the subsets
of a graph G can be generalized into r-partite graphs. Thus, if V1, V2, . . . , Vr
be the partition of the vertex set V of G into r partite sets with the condition

that the ends of every edge belong to diﬀerent subsets of V , then G is known
as an r-partite graph. If any two vertices in distinct partite sets are adjacent,
then the graph G is called a complete r-partite graph or complete multipartite
graph. Let Kn;r denote the complete r-partite graph, Kn,n,...,n(that is, r times
n). If |Vi| = ni; 1 ≤i ≤r, then the graph is referred to as Kn1,n2,...,nr. Again,
if ni = 1; 1 ≤i ≤r, then Kn1,n2,...,nr is the complete graph Kr. K2;r with
Vi = {ui, uj}; 1 ≤i, j ≤r is the r-partite graph K2,2,...2 (r times 2) and Kn;2
with V = {ui, uj}; 1 ≤i, j ≤r is the complete bipartite graph Kn,n.
Graph Operations: From a pair of graphs, say G and H, a new graph
can be produced in diﬀerent ways: the union G ∪H is a graph whose vertex
set is V (G) ∪V (H) and the edge set is E(G) ∪E(H); the intersection G ∩H
has the vertex set V = V (G) ∩V (H) where V (G) ∩V (H) ̸= φ and the edge
set E = E(G) ∩E(H); the join G + H contains the union G ∪H as well as
making every vertex of G incident to every vertex of H. The join G+H of the
graphs G and H is the graph with the vertex set V (G + H) = V (G) ∪V (H)
and the edge set E(G + H) = E(G) ∪E(H) ∪{uv : u ∈V (G), v ∈V (H)}.
G + H thus consists of a copy of G and a copy of H together with all possible
edges between them. Notice that Kn is isomorphic to Kn−1 + K1 and, for
even n, Kn −I is isomorphic to Kn−2 −I + K2. In these representations, the
vertices of K1 and K2 are called central vertices. A subdivision of a graph is a
graph that can be obtained from another graph by replacing some of its edges
with paths; usually, each edge is replaced by a path P3 of length 2.
Line Graph and Total Graph: Let G be a graph. The line graph of
G denoted as L(G) is the graph where vertices are the edges of G and two
vertices of L(G) are adjacent when the corresponding edges are adjacent in
G [68]. The total graph of G, denoted as T(G), is the graph taking all the
vertices and edges of G as the vertices of T(G) such that the adjacency in
T(G) is deﬁned as follows: (i) Two vertices in T(G) corresponding to two
vertices in G are adjacent if the corresponding vertices are adjacent in G; (ii)
Two vertices of T(G) corresponding to the edges of G are adjacent in T(G) if
the corresponding edges in G are adjacent; and (iii) A vertex corresponding to
a vertex in G and another vertex corresponding to an edge in G are adjacent
in T(G) if that edge is incident with that vertex. The line graph of the total
graph of a graph G is denoted as L(T(G)).
Vertex Degrees: Let v ∈V . Then, the number of edges incident to v
is called the degree of the vertex v and is denoted as degG(v) or deg(v) if
G is properly deﬁned in the context. In a simple graph, deg(v) represents
the number of vertices adjacent to v. Thus, deg(v) = |N(v)|, the set of all
neighbors of v. If deg(v) = 0, v is called an isolated vertex, and if deg(v) = 1,
v is referred to as an end vertex, pendant vertex or leaf of the given graph.
An edge e that is incident to a pendant vertex is called a pendant edge. The
minimum degree of a graph G, denoted as δ(G), is the least value of the degrees
of all the vertices of the graph G. That is, δ(G) = min{deg(v) : v ∈V (G)}.
The maximum degree of the graph can also be deﬁned in a similar manner; it
is the maximum degree among the vertices of G and is symbolized as ∆(G).
That is, ∆(G) = max{deg(v) : v ∈V (G)}. The relation between δ(G), ∆(G),

Graph Theory and Decomposition
and the order n with the deg(v) can be expressed as: 0 ≤δ(G) ≤deg(v) ≤
∆(G) ≤n −1. While the degree of a vertex is an even number, the vertex
is known as an even vertex, and the odd degree vertex is known as an odd
vertex. Remember that the number of odd vertices in a graph must be an even
number. Let G be a graph on n vertices, and for any two nonadjacent vertices
u and v, if deg(u) + deg(v) ≥n −1, then G is connected and diam(G) ≤2.
Again, if δ(G) ≥n−1
2 , then G is connected.
The First Theorem of Graph Theory: The relation between the degree
of vertices deg(v) and the number of edges m is formulated as

v∈V (G)
deg(v) =
2m. This is one of the ﬁrst theorems that one deals with in his or her ﬁrst
encounter with graph theory and is called The First Theorem of Graph Theory
or the Handshaking Theorem.
Regular Graph: For any graph G, δ(G) ≤∆(G). If δ(G) = ∆(G) or all
the vertices are of the same degree or deg(v) = r; 0 ≤r ≤n −1 ∀v ∈V (G),
then G is called r-regular graph or G is regular of degree r or simply as G
is regular. A 3-regular graph is called a cubic graph, and the Petersen graph
is an example of cubic graphs. A necessary and suﬃcient condition for the
existence of an r-regular graph with r and n are integers and 0 ≤r ≤n −1
is that either r or n (or both) must be an even number. A graph G with
n(G) ≥2 has the property that any pair of its vertices diﬀers in its degree is
called an irregular graph. The Party Theorem, which says that at any party,
there is a pair of people who have the same number of friends present, can
be restated in graph theoretical terms as there are at least two vertices of the
same degree in a graph. Hence, it can be concluded that no nontrivial graph
is irregular.
Graphical Sequence: The degrees of a graph can be enumerated sequen-
tially, and if done so, it is referred to as the degree sequence of the given graph
G. The degree sequence of a graph can be listed easily, but the converse need
not be true. That is, given a sequence of numbers, it may not always be pos-
sible to ﬁnd an underlying graph satisfying the given degree sequence. If the
given ﬁnite sequence of non-negative integers is the degree sequence of some
graph, then that sequence is called a graphical sequence. There is an eﬃcient
algorithm to ﬁnd whether the given sequence is graphical or not. It is known
as Havel-Hakimi Algorithm named after V´aclav Havel and S. Louis Hakimi,
though they proved it independently.
Graph Matrices: As a pair of sets, V (G) and E(G) represent a graph
G, it can be expressed in matrix form too. If G is a graph with n(G) = n and
m(G) = m, V (G) = {v1, v2, . . . , vn} and E(G) = {e1, e2, . . . , em}, then the
adjacency matrix of G of order n × n is deﬁned as A = [aij], where
aij =

But the order of the incidence matrix is n × m with B = [bij], where

otherwise.
Graph Isomorphism: Let G and H be two graphs such that they have
the same structure, but diﬀer only in the labeling and in the drawing. Thus,
if G and H are labeled in a diﬀerent way, but they lead to produce two equal
graphs, then G and H are said to be isomorphic and this relation is indicated
as G ∼= H. Hence, the isomorphism φ : G →H exists if there exists a one to
one correspondence between the vertex set of G and that of H in such a way
that uv ∈E(G) if and only if φ(u)φ(v) ∈E(H). If G ∼= H, then n(G) = n(H),
m(G) = m(H) and also deg(u) = deg(v) ∀u ∈V (G) and v ∈V (H). The
converse need not be true. Again, G ∼= H if and only if G ∼= H.
Acyclic Graph/Tree: A graph G is said to be acyclic if it does not have
a cycle. An acyclic connected graph is called a tree, and usually a tree is
represented by the letter T instead of G. Indeed, a tree can be deﬁned as a
connected graph whose every edge is a bridge. A tree T is called a rooted tree
if one of its vertices is designated as its root. Its height is the distance between
the root and the farthest vertex. The level of a vertex is the distance from
the root to the given vertex. The same tree may result in diﬀerent rooted
trees when diﬀerent vertices are designated as its roots. Acyclic graphs are
also described as forests. Thus, each component of a forest is a tree. Though
every tree is connected, a forest need not be connected. Any two vertices of
a tree T are connected by a unique path, and a nontrivial tree has at least
two end-vertices. One of the most important characteristics of a tree is that
every tree with n vertices contains exactly n −1 edges. Consequently, every
forest with n vertices and k components consists of n −k edges. If a graph G
with n(G) = n and m(G) = m has any two of the following properties: (i) G
is connected; (ii) G is acyclic; or (iii) m = n −1, then G must be a tree T.
Every tree is a bipartite graph and a complete bipartite graph Kx,y is said to
be a star if either x = 1 or y = 1. A tree consisting of exactly two vertices
that are not end-vertices (but adjacent) is called a double star or a bistar. A
caterpillar is a kind of tree of order greater than or equal to 3. It becomes a
path when its end vertices are removed. This path is called the spine of the
caterpillar.
Vertex-cut: If v ∈V (G), then G −v refers to the subgraph of G whose
vertex set is V (G) −v and the edge set is E(G −v). In addition, if H ⊂
V (G), then G −H becomes the (induced) subgraph of G, with its vertex set
containing n(G) −n(H) vertices and all the edges of G joining two vertices in
V (G)−V (H). If G−v is disconnected, then the vertex v is a cut- vertex of G.
Let v be a vertex and e be a bridge incident to v in a connected graph G. Then,
v is said to be a cut vertex of G if and only if deg(v) > 1. Moreover, if the
connected graph G with n(G) ≥3 has a bridge, then G has a cut vertex too.
If u, v, w ∈V (G) such that v is a cut vertex and u and w belong to diﬀerent

10
Graph Theory and Decomposition
components of G −v, then every u −w path passes through v. This is one
of the characterizations of vertices in a connected graph G. Any nontrivial
connected graph has at least two vertices that are not cut-vertices. Let G
be a connected graph with cut vertices. Then, the removal of a single vertex
makes G a disconnected graph. A non-separable graph is a nontrivial connected
graph having no cut-vertices. Since a non-separable graph with n(G) ≥3 has
no cut-vertex, it does not have a bridge either. This implies that each edge
must be part of some cycle. Non-separable graphs have a higher degree of
connectedness compared to connected graphs with cut-vertices. This leads to
some measures for the connectedness of graphs. If a set of vertices U of G is
taken in such a way that G −U is disconnected, then U is said to be a vertex-
cut. If G−U has minimum cardinality, then it is called a minimum vertex-cut.
If G ̸= Kn, then it must have a vertex cut. Moreover, any V (H) ⊂V (Kn)
has the property that V (H) is again the vertex set of a complete subgraph
Kl; l < n of Kn. Therefore, a connected subgraph of G has a vertex-cut if
and only if G ≇Kn. For a graph G ≇Kn, the cardinality of a minimum
vertex-cut is known as the vertex-connectivity or connectivity and is denoted
as κ(G). If G ∼= Kn, κ(G) = n −1. The connectivity κ(G) is the minimum
value of |U|, where U is a subset of V (G) with G −U being either trivial or
disconnected. In general, for any graph G on n vertices 0 ≤κ(G) ≤n −1. For
a non-negative integer k, a graph G is said to be k-connected if κ(G) ≥k. G
is k-connected if and only if the removal of more than k vertices makes G a
disconnected or trivial graph.
Edge-cut: An edge-cut in a nontrivial graph G is a set F ⊂E(G) with
G −F is disconnected. If no proper subset of F is an edge-cut of G, then
F is a minimal edge-cut of the connected graph G. An edge-cut of minimum
cardinality is a minimum edge-cut. Though any minimum edge-cut is minimal,
the converse need not be true. The cardinality of a minimum edge-cut of a
nontrivial graph G is deﬁned as the edge-connectivity and is denoted as λ(G). If
G is disconnected or trivial, λ(G) = 0. For a connected graph G with a bridge,
λ(G) = 1, and for a complete graph, λ(G) = n−1. Hence, for every graph G of
order n, 0 ≤λ(G) ≤n −1. Let k ≥0. Then, G is said to be k-edge-connected
if λ(G) ≥k. The relation between connectivity, edge-connectivity, and the
minimum degree of a graph G can be expressed as κ(G) ≤λ(G) ≤δ(G).
Eulerian Graph: An Eulerian circuit is a circuit that includes every edge
of the given graph G. No edge is repeated in a circuit. Thus, in an Eulerian
circuit, every edge is counted exactly once. A connected graph having an
Eulerian circuit is described as an Eulerian graph. A closed trail consisting of
every edge of a connected graph results in an Eulerian graph. If every edge of
a graph G is contained in an open trail, then G is called an Eulerian trail. One
of the important characterizations of an Eulerian graph is that every vertex
of G is of even degree. Similarly, an Eulerian trail is a trail with exactly two
vertices of odd degree. An Eulerian trail of G starts at one of these odd vertices
and ends at the other odd vertex.

Hamiltonian Graph: A Hamiltonian cycle of a graph G is the cycle that
contains every vertex of G. It must be a spanning cycle of the given graph.
If G contains a Hamiltonian cycle, then it is called a Hamiltonian graph or
a Hamilton graph. Every cycle Cn is a Hamiltonian graph, and a complete
graph Kn with n ≥3 is Hamiltonian. A Hamiltonian path is deﬁned as a
path in a graph G which consists of every vertex of G. A Hamiltonian path
is obtained by removing an edge from the Hamiltonian cycle. One of the
classical examples of a non-Hamiltonian graph is the Petersen graph. If G is
a Hamiltonian graph, it is connected; it has a Hamiltonian cycle; it has no
cut-vertices; it has a minimum of three vertices; it is 2-connected. G + uv is
Hamiltonian, whenever G is Hamiltonian, and vice versa.
Matching: Let F ⊂E(G). If any two edges in the set of edges of F are
non-adjacent, then an edge e ∈F is said to be independent and F is said to
be a matching. The independence number of a graph G is denoted by α(G). A
matching of maximum cardinality is known as maximum matching. If a graph
has n vertices, then the cardinality of maximum matching must be less than
or equal to ⌊n
2 ⌋. If either n(G) = 2k+1 (odd order) or n(G) = 2k (even order),
then the maximum number of edges in the matching can be k. Moreover, if the
given graph of order 2k contains a matching M with |M| = k, this (maximum)
matching is described as a perfect matching as M matches every vertex of the
given graph to some other vertex. Thus, the subgraph H induced by M can be
considered a one-regular spanning subgraph of G and also termed a 1-factor
of G. Hence, the graph G contains a 1-factor if and only if G contains a
perfect matching. In fact, a Hamiltonian graph of even order has two distinct
perfect matchings. Let F1, F2, . . . , Fk be k 1-factors of a graph G where the
set {E(F1), E(F2), . . . , E(Fk)} is a partition of E(G). Then, G is said to be
1-factorable. That is, G is said to be factored into 1-factors F1, F2, . . . , Fk to
form a 1-factorization of G. A 2-factor is a set of edges that forms a spanning
subgraph of the graph such that every vertex is incident to exactly two edges
in the subgraph. If any 2-factor in the 2-factorization of the given graph is a
Hamiltonian cycle, such factorization is called Hamiltonian factorization and
the graph is said to be Hamiltonian-factorable.
Decomposition: Let G be a graph, and if H = {H1, H2, . . . , Hk} be the
collection of subgraphs of G such that each Hi; 1 ≤i ≤k contains no isolated
vertices and the corresponding edge sets {E(H1), E(H2), . . . , E(Hk)} parti-
tions E(G). Then, H is a decomposition of G. That is, the decomposition of
a graph G is deﬁned as a partition of G into edge-disjoint subgraphs whose
union is G itself. Each of these subgraphs Hi is also called a factor or a part
of decomposition. These subgraphs H′
is need not be spanning subgraphs of G.
Rather, if each of these subgraphs is a spanning subgraph, then this decom-
position becomes a factorization of G. Moreover, if each of these subgraphs is
isomorphic to some graph F, then G is said to be F-decomposable, and this
kind of decomposition is called an F-decomposition or an F-design. Designs
are, in a way, decompositions of a special kind. If each of these parts is a
cycle, then H is known as cycle decomposition. If these subgraphs, factors, or

12
Graph Theory and Decomposition
parts are paths or star graphs, then H is known as path decomposition or star
decomposition, respectively.
Spectrum: The spectrum problem (Spec(G)) for a graph G is to determine
the set of all n for which there is a G-decomposition of order n. The intersection
problem for G is to determine the set IG(n) for all n ∈Spec(G), where IG(n)
is the set of all k for which there are G-decompositions B1 and B2 on the
same vertex set, with |B1 ∩B2| = k.
N P Completeness: All decision problems with a deterministic polyno-
mial time algorithm belong to the complexity class P, where P represents
polynomial time, in computational complexity theory. That is, the problem’s
yes or no response can be determined in polynomial time. All of the deci-
sion problems in P are rated as tractable or eﬃcient. Some problems do not
always run in polynomial time, but their solutions can be validated at that
time. These problems are classiﬁed as
N P (Nondeterministic Polynomial
Time). Note that P ⊆NP. The N P-complete complexity class is made up
of the most diﬃcult problems in the N P class. It is made up of the set of
all N P problems A for which any other N P problem B can be reduced to
A in polynomial time. This class of problem is described as intractable or
ineﬃcient.
1.2.1
Digraphs
In the given graph G(V, E), if every element of the set E is an ordered pair of
vertices, such a graph is known as a directed graph (in short, digraph). That
is, if every edge of the graph G has a direction, it is called a digraph and is
represented as G∗in this text. The edges of such a graph are called directed
edges or arcs. The analogous deﬁnitions of directed graphs are discussed here.
Orientation: An orientation of a graph G is an assignment of directions
to the edges of G. An Eulerian orientation of G is an orientation where the
in-degree at each vertex is equal to the out-degree. It is simple to see that a
graph with all even degrees has an Eulerian orientation.
Tournament: A tournament is an orientation of the complete graph.
Tournaments form perhaps the most interesting class of digraphs, and they
have great potential for application. Tournaments provide a model of the
statistical technique called the method of paired comparisons, and they have
also been studied in connection with sociometric relations in small groups.
For distinct vertices x and y of a tournament T, an (x, y)-path is a directed
path starting from x and ending at y. A cycle (path) of a directed graph D
is called Hamiltonian if it includes all the vertices of D. A complete digraph
is sometimes represented as K∗
n, a complete bipartite digraph as K∗
x,y, and
so on.

Decompositions of Graphs: An Introduction
13
Connectedness: A Hamilton cycle in a digraph G is a particular kind of
1-factor, i.e., a spanning 1-regular subgraph of G or a set of vertex-disjoint
cycles that cover G. A digraph D is strong if, for any two vertices x and y, D
contains a path from x to y and a path from y to x. D is k-connected if the
deletion of fewer than k vertices always results in a strong digraph.
Vertex Degrees: A tournament T is a digraph such that for any two
distinct vertices x and y, exactly one of the couples (x, y) and (y, x) is an arc
of T. V (T) is the vertex set of T, and the order of T is the cardinality of V (T).
A(T) is the set of the arcs of T. A vertex y is an out-neighbor of a vertex x
(resp. in-neighbor of x) if (x, y) (resp. (y, x)) is an arc of T. The number of
the out-neighbors of x is the out-degree d+(x) of x, and the number of the
in-neighbors of x is the in-degree d−(x) of x. The minimum out-degree of T is
denoted by δ+(T), and the minimum in-degree of T is denoted by δ−(T). A
path or a cycle of a tournament T always means a directed path or a directed
cycle of T, and disjoint cycles mean vertex-disjoint cycles. The minimum semi-
degree of T is δ0(T) = min{δ+(T), δ−(T)}. It is known and easy to prove that
if v is the order of T, then v ≥2δ0(T) + 1 and δ0(T) ≤d+(x) ≤v −1 −δ0(T)
for any vertex x of T.
Regular: The tournament is regular if all in- and out-degrees are the same
and equal to n−1
2 . Every tournament contains a Hamilton path (i.e., a directed
path passing through all the vertices). Moreover, a regular tournament con-
tains a Hamilton cycle.
1.2.2
Block Designs
Graph decomposition problems may be regarded as a link between the theory
of block designs and graph theory. Let H be a non-separable subgraph of G,
but not a proper subgraph of any other non-separable subgraph in G. Then,
H is a block of G. Every block is an induced subgraph of the given graph.
Hence, a non-separable graph has no other block other than the given graph
itself. As components are special kinds of subgraphs for a disconnected graph,
blocks are special kinds of non-separable subgraphs of a connected graph with
cut-vertices. Let G be a nontrivial connected graph whose two distinct blocks
are B1 and B2. Then, the following are equivalent: (i) B1 and B2 are edge-
disjoint; (ii) the intersection of the vertex set of both B1 and B2 can have at
most one vertex in common; and (iii) if condition 2 is true, then v is a cut
vertex of G. If there are identical blocks in a design, they are called repeated
blocks, and if there are no repeated blocks, such a design is called a simple
design. A block design is called complete if it is a collection of subsets where
each subset contains every member of the original set. If at least one subset
does not follow this property, then the block design is said to be incomplete.
Balanced Incomplete Block Design (BIBD): A Balanced Incomplete
Block Design (BIBD) with parameters (b, v, r, k, λ) (or a (b, v, r, k, λ)−design)
can be deﬁned as a k-uniform, r-regular incomplete block design with every

14
Graph Theory and Decomposition
pair of vertices lie precisely in λ blocks, where b is the total number of blocks
and v is the total number of vertices. When there are precisely k vertices in
every block, a design is said to be uniform or k-uniform (refers to uniformity).
A regular design, also known as an r-regular design, has every vertex include
precisely the same number of r-blocks (refers to regularity). While the second
condition ensures that all vertices are counted in the same number of blocks,
the ﬁrst property ensures that all blocks are of the same size. These criteria
are crucial for a BIBD since they make it feasible for a BIBD to be tested
evenly and in controlled settings. This design is an example of a consistent
block design. Non-uniform block designs include pairwise balanced designs, or
PBDs.
Pairwise Balanced Design (PBD): A Pairwise Balanced Design
(PBD) is a design that consists of a set A of vertices and a set B of blocks
so that any two vertices are contained precisely in one block. The given PBD
is indicated as PBD(P) if the blocks have a cardinality of P. The provided
PBD becomes an STS or (2, k, v) if |P| = {k} and A = v.
(v, k, λ) G-design: A (v, k, λ) G-design is an arrangement of v vertices into
b G-blocks such that every G-block contains k vertices, and any two distinct
vertices are linked in exactly λ G-blocks. A (v, k, λ) G-design is an edge-
disjoint decomposition of λKv into b subgraphs isomorphic to G. Furthermore,
if each vertex belongs to exactly r subgraphs, then the G-design is said to be
balanced. If k < v, the design is incomplete, and if λ > 1, it may have repeated
blocks. A BIBD with parameters (b, v, r, k, λ) always satisﬁes the conditions
bk = vr and r(k −1) = λ(v −1).
Balanced Bipartite Design (BBD): A block, considered as a set of
vertices together with its adjacency matrix M, is called a B-block if M is the
adjacency matrix of a complete bipartite graph Kk1,k2. A Balanced Bipartite
Design(BBD) with parameters b, v, r, k, λ, k1, k2 (brieﬂy BBD(v, k, λ; k1)) is
an arrangement of v vertices into b B-blocks such that every B-block contains
k = k1 + k2 vertices, every vertex occurs in exactly r B-blocks, and any two
distinct vertices are linked in exactly λ B-blocks.
Steiner Triple Systems (STS): An STS on a set S is a group of triples,
or 3-element subsets of S, where each pair of the 2-element subsets of S is
contained in exactly one of the triples. In other words, it is a complete graph
that has been edge-decomposed into triangles. The theory of block designs
results from generalizing STS to universal set systems.
For a more detailed study of graph theory, one can refer to Chartrand
[511], Harary [255] and West [493], and for graph classes, refer to ISGCI [173].

Cycle Decompositions
This chapter covers major decompositions of graphs into various types of
cycles, such as cycles with ﬁxed lengths, cycles with ﬁxed but varying lengths,
decomposing a graph into Hamilton cycles, and a key cycle decomposition
conjecture known as the Haj´os’ Conjecture. At the conclusion of the chapter,
a few open problems are included.
2.1
Cm-Decompositions
A Cm-decomposition or an m-cycle decomposition of a graph is a decomposi-
tion of the graph into cycles of length m, where m ∈N. The Cm-decomposition
is used to study the connectivity of graphs, design graph algorithms, and ﬁnd
Hamiltonian cycles as well as Eulerian cycles in graphs. After block designs,
perhaps the next most natural decomposition problem to be studied is to ﬁnd
the spectrum of graphs, and decomposing Kn into m-cycles involves determin-
ing the spectrum for m-cycles for a given value of m, denoted by Spec(Cm).
The spectrum problem for m-cycles focuses on determining Spec(Cm). A de-
composition of Kn into 3-cycles is equivalent to an STS of order n, and a de-
composition of Kn into n-cycles is a Hamilton decomposition. Thus, the work
of Kirkman [316] and Walecki [37, 368] from the 1800s addresses Alspach’s
problem in the cases where m is of the form (3, 3, . . . , 3) or (n, n, . . . , n). Cy-
cle decomposition problems are NP-complete in general. Refer to Gabel [221],
Chung and Graham [158], Beineke [69], and Billington [93] for a few early sur-
veys on cycle decompositions.
Theorem 1 Let Kn be a complete graph on n vertices. Then, the necessary
conditions for a Cm-decomposition are: (i) If n > 1, then n ≥m; (ii) n is
odd (each vertex has an even degree); and (iii) 2m divides n(n −1) (i.e., m
divides |E(Kn)| = n(n−1)
2
).
For a given value of m, an integer satisfying the conditions in Theorem 1
is said to be m-admissible. Moreover, for any given cycle of length m, the
admissible integers lie in certain residue classes modulo 2m.

Graph Theory and Decomposition
Deﬁnition 1 If λKn is an undirected graph on n vertices with exactly λ edges
connecting each pair of vertices, then the graph G is of index λ. If n is even,
λKn −I is the graph obtained from λKn by removing the
n
2 edges in the
1-factor I.
Deﬁnition 2 λKn;r is the multigraph with n vertices partitioned into r parts,
with each partition having n vertices having no edges joining pairs of vertices
in the same part and having exactly λ edges joining each pair of vertices from
diﬀerent parts.
The following construction and the example given by H¨aggkvist are helpful in
the discussion of Cm-decompositions.
Construction 1 [246] The graph G(2) is obtained from G by replacing each
vertex x by a pair of vertices x′, x′′, joining every vertex in {x′, x′′} to every
vertex in {y′, y′′} with edges of the same multiplicity as the multiplicity of
[x, y]; no other edges are present. See Figure 2.1.

FIGURE 2.1
Example of graphs G and G(2) [246].
According to Anderson [46], the following three basic theorems laid the foun-
dations for m-cycle decompositions.
Theorem 2 Walecki’s Theorem [368]: The complete graph Kn has a Hamil-
ton decomposition for all n.
Theorem 3 H¨aggkvist’s Lemma [246]: If G is a path or a cycle with n edges
and H is a 2-regular graph on 2n vertices that has only even components, then
G(2) has an H-decomposition.
Theorem 4 Sotteau’s Result [449]: There exists a Cm-decomposition of Kx,y
if and only if x, y and m are even; m divides xy, x ≤m
2 and y ≤m
2 .
The next major results on Cm-decompositions of Kn appeared in the mid
1960s by Kotzig and Rosa [326, 423, 424].
Theorem 5 [326] A complete graph Kn is m-cylce decomposable if n ≡
1 (mod 2m) and m ≡0 (mod 4).
This settled the spectrum problem for m-cycles when m is a power of 2. In a
1966 paper, Rosa [423] considered the case m ≡2 (mod 4) as follows:

Cycle Decompositions
19
Theorem 6 [423] A complete graph Kn is m-cylce decomposable if n ≡
1 (mod 2m) and m ≡2 (mod 4).
Rosa [424] started the work on the case where m is odd, n ≡1 or m (mod
2m), and also settled the cases of 5-cycles and 7-cycles. One of the major
conjectures on cycle decomposition was that of Alspach. Alspach’s Conjecture
[35] is a question to ﬁnd the spectrum of the Cm-decomposition of a complete
graph Kn.
Conjecture 1 Alspach’s Conjecture [35]: The necessary conditions (see The-
orem 1) are also suﬃcient.
Alspach and Varma [43], Hoﬀman et al. [275], and ˇSajna [427] proved the
following results on the complete graph Kn:
Theorem 7 [43] Let m = 2pe, where p be any prime and e be any positive
integer. Then Kn is m-cycle decomposable if and only if n ≥m is odd, and m
divides |E(Kn)|.
Theorem 8 [275] For m and n both odd, if Kn is Cm-decomposable for all
n in the range m < n < 3m that satisfy the necessary condition n(n −1) ≡0
(mod 2m), then Kn is Cm-decomposable for all n satisfying n(n−1) ≡0 (mod
2m).
Theorem 9 Induction Theorem [427]: Let m be odd and n be even. If Kn −
I is Cm-decomposable for all n in the range m < n < 3m and satisfy the
necessary condition n(n −2) ≡0 (mod 2m), then Kn −I is Cm-decomposable
for all n satisfying n(n −2) ≡0 (mod 2m).
The results of Bermond et al. [81], Hoﬀman et al. [275], and Bell [70] are given
below.
Theorem 10 [81, 275] If there exists a decomposition of Kn into m-cycles for
all admissible n in the range m < n < 3m, then there exists a decomposition
of Kn into m-cycles for all admissible n.
Theorem 11 [70] The necessary conditions (see Theorem 1) for Kn to have
a Cm-decomposition are suﬃcient for n ≤50.
Rodger [420], and Lindner and Rodger [357] showed that:
Theorem 12 [420] The necessary conditions (see Theorem 1) are also suf-
ﬁcient for the existence of a Cm-decomposition of Kn when (i) m = pr for
some prime p; (ii) m = 2pr for some prime p; (iiii) m ≤31 and m is odd;
and (iv) m ≤18 and m is even. Furthermore, a Cm-decomposition of Kn is
known to exist if (i) n ≡1 (mod 2m); and (ii) if n ≡m (mod 2m) and m is
odd.

Graph Theory and Decomposition
Theorem 13 [357] For λ ≥3, 2 ≤m ≤14, and m = 16, there exists an
m-cycle system of λKn if and only if n is (m, λ)-admissible. For λ ≥2,
2 ≤m ≤8, and m = 10, 12, 14, there exists a directed m-cycle system of λK∗
n
if and only if n is (m, λ)∗-admissible and n ̸= 4 when m = 4 and λ is odd.
Balister [61] has shown that the decompositions exist when the length of each
cycle is no more than 5, when n is no more than 14 (see [60]), and when n is
very large and each cycle is no longer than ⌊n−112
20
⌋(see [60, 26]). Alspach and
Gavlas [39] established necessary and suﬃcient conditions for decomposing
the complete graph of odd order into odd cycles.
Theorem 14 [39] For positive odd integers m and n with 3 ≤m ≤n, the
graph Kn can be decomposed into cycles of length m if and only if the number
of edges in Kn is a multiple of m, i.e., m divides n(n−1)
2
.
ˇSajna [428] extended her results to the cases m and n of opposite parity, thus
completely solving the problem through a constructive proof of the following
theorem.
Theorem 15 [428] Let n be an odd integer and m be an even integer with
3 ≤m ≤n. The graph Kn can be decomposed into cycles of length m whenever
m divides the number of edges in Kn.
Alspach et al. [40] provided solutions to spectrum using admissible lists. Bu-
ratti [139] has provided solutions to the spectrum problem for m-cycles, where
m is odd. The Cm-decomposition of cycles of varying length in a complete
multipartite graph is given by Bryant et al. [130].
Theorem 16 [40] For λ = 1, 2 and m ≥2, there exists an m-cycle system
of λKn if and only if n is (m, λ)-admissible. For all m ≥2, there exists
a directed m-cycle system of K∗
n if and only if n is (m, 1)-admissible and
(m, n) ̸= (4, 4), (3, 6), (6, 6).
Theorem 17 [130] Let λ, n, and m be integers with n, m ≥3 and λ ≥1.
Then, there exists a decomposition of λKn into m-cycles if and only if (i)
m ≤n; (ii) λ(n −1) is even, and (iii) m divides λ

The next deﬁnition and result are related to a complete graph with a hole:
Deﬁnition 3 For positive integers l and n with l < n, the complete graph of
order n with a hole of size l, denoted by Kn −Kl, is the graph obtained from
a complete graph of order n by removing the edges of a complete subgraph of
order l.
Horsley [282] proved a result for cycles of ﬁxed even length, and Horsley and
Hoyte [283] proved similar results for cycles of ﬁxed odd length.

be positive integers such that n > l. Then, there exists a Cm-decomposition of
Kn −Kl if and only if (l, n) is m-admissible.
2.1.1
Decomposition of Kn into m-Cycles and a Perfect
Matching
The complete graph Kn, where n is an even number, can have a Cm-
decomposition together with a perfect matching. This fact is discussed here.
The equivalent result (of Theorem 12) for even n has been proved in part by
El-Zanati [192] and, independently and completely, by ˇSajna [429].
Theorem 21 [429] If Kn −I is Cm-decomposable for even n and odd m in
the range m ≤n < 3m; m ≥3 that satisfy the necessary condition n(n −
2) ≡0 (mod 2m), then Kn −I is Cm-decomposable for all n ≥m satisfying
n(n −2) ≡0 (mod 2m).
The deﬁnition of the term admissible can be extended so that it applies to
Cm-decompositions of Kn −I, rather than just Kn. The existence problem
for Cm-decompositions of Kn −I, that is, decomposition of Kn into m-cycles
and a perfect matching, was completely solved by Alspach and Marshall [41],
Alspash and Heather [39], and ˇSajna [428].
Theorem 22 [39, 41] Let m, n be even. If there exists a decomposition of
Kn −I into m-cycles for all admissible n in the range m < n < 2m, then
there exists a decomposition of Kn −I into m-cycles for all admissible n (i.e.,
m divides n(n−2)
2
).
Theorem 23 [428] Let n be an even integer and m be an odd integer with
3 ≤m ≤n. The graph Kn −I can be decomposed into cycles of length m
whenever m divides the number of edges in Kn −I.
The necessary conditions given in Lemma 2 (see Section 2.2) are also suﬃcient,
and Cm-decompositions of Kn −I exist for all admissible even n. Hence, the
following theorems are proved besides a result for multigraphs:
Theorem 24 [39, 428] Let m ≥3 and let n be even. There exists a Cm-
decomposition of Kn −I if and only if n ≥m for n > 2, and m divides
n(n−2)
2
.
Theorem 25 [429] Let m be odd and n be even. If there exists a decomposi-
tion of Kn −I into m-cycles for all admissible n in the range m < n < 3m,
then there exists a decomposition of Kn −I into m-cycles for all admissible
n.

Cycles of Varying Lengths
Cycle decompositions were formerly solely referred to as Cm-decompositions.
Later, it is developed as a method of concurrently breaking down the same
graph into cycles of various lengths. Here, signiﬁcant developments are dis-
cussed.
Deﬁnition 4 Let M = m1, m2, . . . , mt be a sequence of integers. An M-
cycle decomposition of a graph G is a decomposition D = {G1, G2, . . . , Gt}
of G where Gi is an mi-cycle for i = 1, 2, . . . , t. Let G be a graph of even
degree with |V (G)| = n. Let S = {b1, b2, . . . , bt}, 3 ≤bi ≤n, and suppose that
m1b1 +m2b2 +. . .+mtbt = |E(G)|. If the edge-set of G can be partitioned into
m1 cycles of length b1, m2 cycles of length b2, . . ., and mt cycles of length bt,
then denote G = m1Cb1 + m2Cb2 + . . . + mtCbt, where Cbi is a cycle of length
bi. If mi = 1, then miCbi will be written as Cbi. If each vertex of G has an
odd degree, then an M-decomposition of G is a decomposition {G1, . . . , Gt, I}
such that Gi is an mi-cycle for i = 1, . . . , t and I is a perfect matching in G.
Example 1 A decomposition of K6 −I into a 3-cycle, a 4-cycle, and a 5-
cycle is shown in Figure 2.2, and a decomposition of K7 into a 4-cycle, two
5-cycles, and a 7-cycle is shown in Figure 2.3.

Cycle Decompositions

When G is a complete graph or a complete graph of even order with the edges
of a 1-factor removed, the obvious necessary conditions for there to be a M-
cycle decomposition of G are given below. The converse can be considered the
varying length version of Alspach’s Conjecture (see Conjecture 1 [35]).
Lemma 1 [123] Let n ≥3 be an integer, and let M = m1, m2, . . . , mt be a
sequence of integers.
1. If there exists an M-cycle decomposition of Kn, then n is odd, 3 ≤mi ≤n
for i = 1, 2, . . . , t and m1 + m2 + . . . + mt = n(n−1)
2
.
2. If there exists an M-cycle decomposition of Kn −I, then n is even, 3 ≤
mi ≤n for i = 1, 2, . . . , t and m1 + m2 + . . . + mt = n(n−2)
2
.
Conjecture 2 [35] Let M = m1, m2, . . . , mt be a sequence of integers satis-
fying 3 ≤mi ≤n for i = 1, 2, . . . , t. If m1 + m2 + . . . + mt = n(n−1)
2
and n is
odd, then Kn has an M-cycle decomposition. Whereas, if m1+m2+. . .+mt =
n(n−2)
2
and n is even, then Kn −I has an M-cycle decomposition.
There are several results for decompositions of Kn into cycles of more than one
length [264], and many of them are summarized and given in [123]. Heinrich
[264] showed that:
Theorem 27 [264]
1. Let S = {n−2, n−1, n}. If n is odd and a(n−2)+b(n−1)+cn = n(n−1)
2
, then
Kn = aCn−2+bCn−1+cCn. If n is even and a(n−2)+b(n−1)+cn = n(n−2)
2
,
then Kn −I = aCn−2 + bCn−1 + cCn.
2. If n is even and 3a + 4b + 6c = n(n−2)
2
, then Kn −I = aC3 + bC4 + cC6.
In other words, if mi = 3, 4 or 6 for i = 1, 2, . . . , t, then the necessary condi-
tions are suﬃcient. Rosa [421] and Adams et al. [26] proved the truthfulness
of Alspach’s Conjecture for certain bounds. Adams et al. [25] solved the prob-
lem for mi = 3 or 5; i = 1, 2, . . . , t. Bryant et al. [135] presented a method
of proving the necessary conditions to be suﬃcient when mi ∈{m; n} for
i = 1, 2, . . . , t (see Theorem 29).
Theorem 28 [26, 421] For m, n even and n > m, the obvious necessary
conditions for the existence of a decomposition of the complete graph Kv when
v is odd (or the complete graph with a 1-factor removed Kv−I when v is even)
into r m-cycles and s n-cycles are suﬃcient if and only if they are suﬃcient
for v < 7n. That is, in the case m1, m2, . . . , mt ∈{m, n}, where m and n are
even and 4 ≤m < n, Alspach’s Conjecture is true for all v if and only if it is
true for all v < 7n.
Theorem 29 [26] Theorem 28 is used to settle all remaining cases with
m, n ≤10 and for all v when:

Balister [60] has shown that Conjecture 2 is true if the cycle lengths are
bounded by some linear function of n and n is suﬃciently large. Bryant et al.
[130] obtained more general results on decompositions of complete multigraphs
into cycles of varying lengths (see Theorem 17). Moreover, Balister [60] used
STS of order 1 (mod 72) and obtained cycle decompositions of Kn −I with
n ≡2 (mod 144). Balister’s result [61] solved the more general question of
packing closed trails in Kn.
Theorem 30 [60] There exists a (very large) constant N such that for any
n ≥N and any sequence M = m1, m2, . . . , mt satisfying 3 ≤mi ≤⌊n−112
20
⌋
and m1+m2+. . .+mt = n(n−1)
2
when n is odd or m1+m2+. . .+mt = n(n−2)
2
when n is even, there exists an M-cycle decomposition of Kn (n odd) or of
Kn −I (n even).
Theorem 31 [61] Let m1, m2, . . . , mt ≥3 and let e = m1 + m2 + . . . +
mt. There is a subgraph H of Kn such that there is a decomposition
{G1, G2, . . . , Gt} of H where Gi is a closed trail with mi edges for i =
1, 2, . . . , t if and only if (i) e =
n(n−1)
2
or e ≤
n(n−1)
2
−3 for n odd; and
(ii) e ≤n(n−2)
2
for n even.
For m ∈{3, 4, 5}, a closed trail with m edges is necessarily an m-cycle. Thus,
Theorem 31 settles the part of Conjecture 2 for m1, m2, . . . , mt ⊆{3, 4, 5}.
Bryant and Maenhaut [133] settled Alspach’s Conjecture in the case that the
cycle lengths are the shortest and longest possible, that is, decomposing Kn
or Kn −I into triangles and Hamilton cycles (see Theorem 35). It is not too
diﬃcult to solve Alspach’s Conjecture in the case that the cycle’s lengths are
four and n. It is, however, more diﬃcult to settle Alspach’s Conjecture in the
case that the cycle’s lengths are ﬁve and n. Bryant et al. [128] solved this
conjecture for very large odd n (see Theorem 38), and Jordon [305] solved it
for all n.
Theorem 32 [305] For all odd integers n ≥5 (resp.,even integers n ≥6)
and all nonnegative integers h and t with hn + 5t = n(n−1)
2
(resp., hn + 5t =
n(n−2)
2
), the complete graph Kn decomposes into h Hamilton cycles and t 5-
cycles (resp., h Hamilton cycles, t 5-cycles, and a 1-factor).
Lemma 2 by Bryant et al. [123] guarantees the existence of such a decompo-
sition. Moreover, Bryant et al. [129] and Hilton and Johnson [271] proved the
following on complete graphs.

Lemma 2 [123] Let G be a graph of order n, let m1, m2, . . . , mt be a sequence

i = 1, 2, . . . , t; (ii) The number of edges in G is m1 + m2 + . . . + mt; and (iii)

Theorem 34 [271] Let n be a positive integer. Let p, q, and r be non-negative
integers. Then Kn (n odd) or Kn −I (n even) can be decomposed into p 4-
cycles, q 6-cycles, and r 8-cycles if and only if the cycles have length at most
n and

Bryant and Rodger [134] summarized the previously known results.
Theorem 35 [134] Let n be an integer and let M = m1, m2, . . . , mt be a

There exists an M-cycle decomposition of Kn if n is odd, or of Kn −I if n
is even, in each of the following cases:
1. m1 = m2 = . . . = mt [39, 428].
2. n ≡2 (mod 4), t is even, mi ∈{4, 6, . . . , n} \ {n −2} for i = 1, 2, . . . , t,

Bryant et al. [126], Bryant and Horsley [127] settled Alspach’s Conjecture in
the case where all the cycle lengths are greater than about n

authors [128] completely settled the problem for suﬃciently large odd n.

Liang [348] summarized the results on Alspach’s Conjecture as follows:
Theorem 39 [348] Conjecture 2 on decompositions of Kn into cycles of more
than one length holds in each of the following cases:
1. n ≤14;
2. m1 = m2 = . . . = mt;
3. mi ∈A; i = 1, 2, . . . , t, where A ∈{{3, 4, 5}, {3, 4, 6}, {4, 6, 8}, {3, 4, 8},
{3, 6, 8}, {5, 8}, {4, 10}, {6, 10}, {8, 10}, {3, n}, {n −2, n −1, n}} ∪
{{2k, 2k+1}|k ≥2}.
Bryant et al. [132] showed that the obvious necessary conditions are also suﬃ-
cient for the existence of the desired decomposition, thereby solving the prob-
lem posed by Alspach [35].
Theorem 40 [132] There is a decomposition {G1, . . . , Gt} of Kn in which
Gi is an mi-cycle for i = 1, . . . , t if and only if n is odd, 3 ≤mi ≤n for
i = 1, . . . , t, and m1 + m2 + . . . + mt =

Bryant et al. [131] found a similar problem for decompositions of complete
multigraphs into cycles of a certain length. λKn stands for the complete multi-
graph of order n and multiplicity λ, which has λ distinct edges connecting each

Chou et al. [155] proved a result for complete bipartite graphs. The suﬃciency
of the necessary condition for the existence of an m-cycle system of Kn,n −I
was proved by Archdeacon et al. [49] with possible exceptions. Later on, the
gap was completely ﬁlled by Ma et al. [372].
Theorem 42 [155] The complete bipartite graph Km,n can be decomposed
into p copies of C4, q copies of C6 and r copies of C8 for each triple p, q, r
of nonnegative integers such that 4p + 6q + 8r = mn.
Theorem 43 [49] Let m and n be positive integers with m ≥4 even and
n ≥3 odd. If m ≡0 (mod 4) and m ≤n, or if m ≡2 (mod 4) and m ≤2n,
then the graph Kn,n −I has an m-cycle system if and only if the number of
edges in Kn,n −I is a multiple of m.
Theorem 44 [372] Let m and n be positive integers. Then, there exists an
m-cycle system of Kn,n −I if and only if (i) n ≡1 (mod 2); (ii) m ≡0 (mod
2) and 4 ≤m ≤2n; (iii) n(n −1) ≡0 (mod m).
Hilton and Johnson [271] proved a result on complete bipartite graphs. Chou
and Fu [154] established the decomposition of the complete bipartite graphs
into cycles of lengths 4 and 10 or 4 and 12. The existence of a cycle decom-
position of Kn,n −I was also shown by Chou and Fu [155, 154].
Theorem 45 [271] The complete bipartite graph Km,n can be decomposed
into p 4-cycles, q 6-cycles, and r 8-cycles if and only if (i) m and n are even;
(ii) No cycle has a length greater than 2 min{m, n}; (iii) mn = 4p + 6q + 8r;
(iv) If m = n = 4, then r ̸= 1.
Theorem 46 [449] Km,n can be decomposed into cycles of length 2k if and
only if (i) m, n ≥k; (ii) m and n are even; and (iii) mn is a multiple of 2k.
By generalizing Theorem 46 of Sotteau, Liang and Liu [348] showed that
Conjecture 2 is true if the cycle lengths mi ∈{4, 12} or {6, 12}; i = 1, 2, . . . , t.
Horsley [282] showed the existence of a cycle decomposition of a complete
bipartite graph.

Graph Theory and Decomposition
Theorem 47 [282] Let a and b be positive integers such that either a and b are
even or a = b, and let K∗
a,b be the graph Ka,b if a and b are even, and the graph
Ka,b−I if a = b and a is odd. If m1, m2, . . . , mt are even integers such that 4 ≤
m1 ≤m2 ≤. . . ≤mt ≤min(m, n, 3mt−1) and m1+m2+. . .+mt = |E(K∗

then there is a decomposition of K∗
a,b into cycles of lengths m1, m2, . . . , mt.
Fu et al. [216] decomposed complete bipartite graphs in terms of cycles having
diﬀerent even lengths.
Theorem 48 [216] Let Kn,n be a complete bipartite graph. If n is even, then
Kn,n has a cycle decomposition of even length. If n is odd, then Kn,n −I,
where I is a 1-factor of Kn,n, has a cycle decomposition of even length for all
n = 2, 3 and n ≥5.
2.3
Hamilton Decompositions
A Hamilton or Hamiltonian decomposition can be described as a 2-
factorization of the graph such that each factor is connected. An Eulerian
regular graph is obviously Hamilton decomposable, but the edges of a regular
odd-degree graph can be partitioned into Hamilton cycles and to a 1-factor or
a perfect matching. Hamiltonian cycles are often used in applications such as
scheduling and routing. Moreover, Hamiltonian cycle decomposable design is
frequently associated with fault tolerance and is used to ﬁnd alternate commu-
nication paths in computer networks. The surveys of Gould [237, 238], Chiba
and Yamashita [151] gave an extensive overview of Hamilton decompositions.
The decision problem of whether a given graph contains a Hamilton cycle
is known to be NP-hard and appears on Karp’s original list of 21 NP-hard
problems [309]. Since the decision problem of a graph having a Hamilton cycle
is NP-complete, it makes sense to ask for degree conditions for a graph to
be Hamiltonian. The most general and well-known Hamiltonicity conditions
based on vertex degrees are given by the following theorems: The ﬁrst one
is Dirac’s Theorem of 1952, which gave a minimum degree condition, and
another is by Erd¨os and Gallai [199] on the number of edges of graphs.
Theorem 49 Dirac’s Theorem [183]: Every graph on n ≥3 vertices with a
minimum degree of at least n
2 contains a Hamilton cycle.
Theorem 50 Erd¨os and Gallai Theorem [199]: Let G be a graph of order
n ≥3. If |E(G)| ≥
n−1
2

+ 2, that is, d(G) ≥(n−1)(n−2)+4
n
, then G contains
a Hamiltonian cycle.
Like Theorem 50, the problem of determining the maximum number of edges
in a graph not containing a speciﬁed subgraph is called a Tur´an-type problem.
Dirac’s Theorem is strengthened by Ore’s Theorem and gives a degree-sum
condition for hamiltonicity.

Cycle Decompositions
29
Theorem 51 Ore’s Theorem [395]: If G is a graph with n ≥3 vertices such
that every pair x ̸= y of non-adjacent vertices satisﬁes d(x) + d(y) ≥n, then
G has a Hamilton cycle.
If a graph satisﬁes the Erd¨os–Gallai condition, then the graph also satisﬁes
the Ore condition. Dirac’s Theorem can also be strengthened considerably by
allowing many of the vertices to have small degrees as PoˆAsa’s Theorem [406].
Theorem 52 PoˆAsa’s Theorem [406]: A graph on n ≥3 vertices has a
Hamilton cycle if its degree sequence d1 ≤· · · ≤dn satisﬁes di ≥i + 1 for all
i < (n−1)
2
and if additionally d⌈n
2 ⌉≥⌈n
2 ⌉when n is odd.
Chv´atal’s Theorem is a further generalization of it, and Babai [390] proved an
extension of Dirac’s Theorem.
Theorem 53 Chv´atal’s Theorem [159]: Suppose that the degrees of the graph
G are d1 ≤· · · ≤dn. If n ≥3 and di ≥i or dn−i ≥n −i for all i < n
2 , then
G is Hamiltonian.
Conjecture 3 [107] The edges of every 2-edge-connected graph on n vertices
can be covered by at most 2(n−1)
3
cycles.
Theorem 54 [390] Every graph on n ≥3 vertices with a minimum degree of
at least n
2 contains not just one but at most (roughly) n
8 edge-disjoint Hamilton
cycles.
Fan [200] extended Theorem 51 by considering the maximum degree of two
vertices with distance two.
Deﬁnition 5 Let dG(x, y) denote the distance between two vertices x and y
in G. For a connected graph G, if the independence number α(G) ≥2, then
µ(G) =

min{max{degG(x), degG(y)} : x, y ∈V (G), dG(x, y) = 2};
+∞, otherwise.
Theorem 55 [200] Let G be a 2-connected graph of order n. If µ(G) ≥n
2 ,
then G contains a Hamiltonian cycle.
Nash-Williams [391] proposed the following conjecture:
Conjecture 4 [391] Every k-regular graph with at most 2k + 1 vertices is
Hamiltonian decomposable.
For regular graphs, a number of results strengthen or generalize the result
of Jackson [292], and the Conjecture 5 would improve Jackson’s Theorem for
3-connected graphs.
Theorem 56 [292] Every 2-connected k-regular graph with at most 3k vertices
is Hamiltonian.

30
Graph Theory and Decomposition
Theorem 57 [270] Let G be a 2-connected k regular graph on at most 3k + 3
vertices. Then, G is Hamiltonian, or G is the Petersen graph, or the Petersen
graph with one vertex replaced by a triangle.
Conjecture 5 [294] For k ≥4, every 3-connected k-regular graph with at
most 4k vertices is Hamiltonian.
Conjecture 5 is a special case of a conjecture of H¨aggkvist (see [237]). Broersma
et al. [122] sharpened earlier results with the following theorem.
Theorem 58 [122] If G is a 2-connected graph of order n such that |N(u) ∪
N(v)| ≥
n
2 for every pair of nonadjacent vertices u and v, then either G
is Hamiltonian, the Petersen graph, or belongs to one of three families of
exceptional graphs with connectivity 2.
A result of Smith (see [478]) says that every edge of a 3-regular graph is
contained in an even number of Hamiltonian cycles. Thomason [464] extended
Smith’s result to r-regular graphs where r is odd. Sheehan [440] proposed the
following conjecture:
Conjecture 6 [440] Every Hamiltonian 4-regular graph has a second Hamil-
tonian cycle.
Since every r-regular graph (with even r) is the union of pairwise edge-disjoint
spanning 2-regular graphs, Sheehan’s Conjecture combined with the results of
Smith and Thomason implies that every Hamiltonian regular graph, except
the cycle, has a second Hamiltonian cycle.
Theorem 59 [469] If G is Hamiltonian and m-regular with m ≥300, then
G has a second Hamiltonian cycle.
Brandt et al. [121] obtained a suﬃcient degree condition for a graph to have k
vertex disjoint cycles. Since for small k, the Dirac type bound does not follow
from the Ore type bound, Faudree et al. [203] showed a result on hamiltonicity.
Note that the bound in Theorem 61 is sharp, and for large k, it implies the
bound of Dirac-type.
Deﬁnition 6 Let degG(x) be the degree of a vertex x in G, and ∆be the
maximum degree of the graph G. For an integer s ≥1, if the independence
number α(G) ≥s, then
σs(G) =

min{Σx∈X degG(x) : X is an independent set of G with |X| = s};
+∞, otherwise.
For integers t ≥s ≥1, if α(G) ≥t, then

s(G) =

min{∆sX : X is an independent set of G with |X| = t};

Theorem 60 [121] If G is a graph of order n satisfying δ(G) ≥n
2 and n ≥4k
or σ2(G) ≥n and n ≥4k, then G contains a 2-factor with exactly k cycles.
Theorem 61 [203] Let k be an integer with 3 ≤k ≤n −2, and let G be
a graph of order n. If deg(u) + deg(v) ≥n + 3k−9
2
for every pair u, v of
nonadjacent vertices of G, then G is k-ordered Hamiltonian.
Theorem 62 [333] For every ϵ > 0, there exists n0 such that every r-regular
graph G on n ≥n0 vertices, where r ≥( 1
2 + ϵ)n is even, has a Hamilton
decomposition.
Christoﬁdes et al. [156] showed the following approximate version of Conjec-
ture 4 and later K¨uhn et al. [330] proved it for large n by solving the case when
δ is allowed to be close to n
2 . The maximum number of edge-disjoint Hamilton
cycles one can guarantee in a graph G of minimum degree δ is addressed by
Csaba et al. [330, 169]. K¨uhn and Osthus [334] proved that:
Theorem 63 [334] There exists an integer n0 such that every graph G on
n ≥n0 vertices with minimum degree δ(G) ≥n
2 contains at least n−2
8
edge-
disjoint Hamilton cycles.
The construction based on that of Babai (see [390]) showed that the bound
in Theorem 63 is apt for n = 8k + 2, where k ∈N. With regard to Hamil-
ton decomposition related to Bermond’s Conjecture and line graphs, the fol-
lowing theorems are useful: The ﬁrst one is that of Kotzig [325]. Chv´atal
and Erd¨os[160] showed a relation on the independence number α(G) and the
connectivity κ(G) for hamiltonicity of graphs. Bondy [103] pointed out that
the graph satisfying the Ore condition also satisﬁes the Chv´atal and Erd¨os
condition. Bondy [104] extended Theorem 65 by giving a degree condition.
Yamashita [501] extended Theorem 67.
Theorem 64 [325] A 3-regular graph is Hamiltonian if and only if its line
graph is Hamilton decomposable.
Theorem 65 [160] Let G be a graph of order n ≥3. If α(G) ≤κ(G), then
G contains a Hamiltonian cycle.
Theorem 66 [103] Let G be a graph of order n. If σ2(G) ≥n, then α(G) ≤
κ(G), where σ2(G) is as per Deﬁnition 6.
Theorem 67 [104] Let G be a graph of order n ≥3. If σκ(G)+1(G) >
1
2(κ(G) + 1)(n −1), then G contains a Hamiltonian cycle, where σκ(G)+1(G)
is as per Deﬁnition 6.
Theorem 68 [501] Let G be a graph of order n ≥3. If σκ(G)+1
2
(G) ≥n, then
G contains a Hamiltonian cycle, where σκ(G)+1
2
(G) is as per Deﬁnition 6.
The following theorem characterizes non-Hamiltonian graphs G with σ2(G) =

and n ≥5 is odd;
3. G ≃K1 + (Kp ∪Kq) for some positive integers p, q with p + q = n −1.
Bermond proposed Conjecture 7 for line graphs. Muthusamy and Paulraja
[386] proved in support of Conjecture 7. Pike [402], using a deterministic
computer search for non-Hamilton decomposable graphs of small order, proved
that Conjecture 7 is true for certain graphs. Bryant et al.[125] proved a part
of Conjecture 7.
Conjecture 7 [78] The line graph of a Hamilton decomposable graph is
Hamilton decomposable.
Theorem 70 [386] If a graph G has a decomposition into an even (resp., odd)
number of Hamilton cycles, then L(G), the line graph of G, has a decomposi-
tion into Hamilton cycles (resp., Hamilton cycles and a 2-factor). Moreover,
if G is a 2k-regular graph having a Hamilton cycle, then the edge set of L(G),
can be partitioned into Hamilton cycles and a 2-factor.
Theorem 71 [402] Conjecture 7 is true for the following graphs: (i) 5-regular;
(ii) bipartite and regular of odd degree; (iii) perfectly 1-factorizable and regular
of even degree; (iv) Hamilton decompositions for the block-intersection graphs
of all STS of order 15 or less.
Theorem 72 [401] Every bipartite Hamilton decomposable graph G with con-
nectivity κ(G) = 2 has a Hamilton decomposable line graph L(G).
Theorem 73 [125] If a graph is regular of even degree and contains a Hamil-
ton cycle, or regular of odd degree and contains a Hamiltonian 3-factor, then
its line graph is Hamilton decomposable.
The ﬁrst result on Hamilton decomposition by Walecki (see Theorem 2) is
expressed by Thomason [464] as:
Theorem 74 [464] If G is a 4-regular multigraph with a decomposition into
Hamilton cycles, then there are at least two distinct decompositions of G into
Hamilton cycles.
The Walecki construction is considered the question of the existence of Hamil-
ton cycle decomposition of a complete graph K2n+1; n ≥1. According to
Alspach [37], Walecki brought us three fundamental decompositions:
1. Decomposition of odd-order complete graphs into Hamilton cycles;

Cycle Decompositions
33
2. Decomposition of even-order complete graphs into Hamilton paths; and
3. Decomposition of even-order complete graphs with 1-factor removed into
Hamilton cycles.
The following result of Csaba et al. [169] generalizes Walecki’s theorem to
arbitrary regular graphs. Theorem 75 is related to 1-Factorization Conjecture.
The long-standing 1-Factorization Conjecture guarantees a 1-factorization in
every regular graph of suﬃciently high degree. Csaba et al. [169] conﬁrmed
this conjecture for suﬃciently large graphs.
Theorem 75 [169] Let n, d ∈N be such that n ≥n0; n0 ∈Z and d ≥⌊n
2 ⌋.
Then, every d-regular graph G on n vertices has a decomposition into Hamilton
cycles and at most one perfect matching.
Theorem 76 [169] Let n, d ∈N be such that n ≥n0; n0 ∈Z and d ≥2⌈n
4 ⌉−1.
Then, every d-regular graph G on n vertices has a 1-factorization.
Jordon [305] settled Alspach’s Conjecture for two cases: one is Hamilton cycles
and 5-cycles, and the other is Hamilton cycles and 4-cycles (see Theorem 32).
Hetyei [268], Laskar and Auerbach [338], and Bryant et al. [124] extended the
study of Hamilton decompositions to complete multipartite graphs.
Theorem 77 [338] A complete multipartite graph can be decomposed into
Hamilton cycles if and only if it is regular of even degree.
Theorem 78 [124] A complete multipartite graph Kn with n > 1 vertices
and m edges can be decomposed into edge-disjoint Hamilton paths if and only
if
m
n−1 is an integer, and the maximum degree of Kn is at most
2m
n−1.
Theorem 79 [124] A complete multipartite graph has a decomposition into
Hamilton paths if and only if it is admissible.
Hamiltonian decompositions of complete regular r-partite graphs have been
studied by Hilton and Rodger [272]. The development of Hamilton cycle de-
composition until the 1980’s can be seen in [38]. The Perfect 1-Factorization
Conjecture was posed by Kotzig [325] at the ﬁrst international conference
devoted to graph theory.
Conjecture 8 Perfect 1-Factorization Conjecture [325]: K2n has a perfect
1-factorization, i.e., a 1-factorization in which any two 1-factors induce a
Hamilton cycle.
The Corr´adi–Hajnal Theorem gives the minimum degree threshold of a graph
forcing the containment of k + 1 vertex-disjoint triangles.
Theorem 80 Corr´adi–Hajnal Theorem[168]: For n, k ∈N with n ≥3k, every
n-vertex undirected graph with a minimum degree of at least 2k contains k
disjoint cycles. That is, if a ﬁnite graph without multiple edges contains at

34
Graph Theory and Decomposition
least 3k vertices, and the degree of every vertex is at least 2k, where k is
a positive integer, then the graph contains k independent circuits. In other
words, the graph contains as a subgraph a set of k circuits, no two of which
have a vertex in common.
A conjecture of Erd¨os and Faudree [198] generalizes the Corr´adi–Hajnal the-
orem in another direction.
Conjecture 9 Erd¨os and Faudree Conjecture [198]: Let G be a graph with
order n = 4k and δ(G) ≥2k. Then, G contains k vertex disjoint 4-cycles.
2.4
Haj´os’ Conjecture
The Haj´os’ Conjecture states that every graph with a chromatic number of
at least k contains a subdivision of the complete graph with k vertices. The
proof of Haj´os’ Conjecture has important implications for graph coloring [255]
as it would be a signiﬁcant improvement over the current best known upper
bound of k + 1 colors. Though it is believed that Haj´os’ Conjecture was ﬁrst
proposed by Gy¨orgy Haj´os in 1961, according to Thomassen [470], the origin
of Haj´os’ Conjecture is unclear. Sometimes the paper [250] was cited, but B.
Toft pointed out that Haj´os did not mention the conjecture in that paper, and
that Dirac knew the conjecture in the 1950s. In 1952, Dirac [182] veriﬁed the
conjecture for k ≤4. In 1979, Catlin [146] proved that the conjecture fails for
each k ≥7 by constructing a family of counterexamples to Haj´os’ conjecture
for k = 7. In 1981, Erd¨os and Fajtlowicz [197] proved that it fails for almost
all graphs. In 2002, K¨uhn and Osthus [331] identiﬁed the bounds of girth of
graphs, which satisfy Haj´os’ Conjecture.
Conjecture 10 Haj´os’ Conjecture [365]: Every simple Eulerian graph G has
a cycle decomposition with at most ⌈n
2 ⌉cycles.
Erd¨os proposed the following conjecture:
Conjecture 11 Erd¨os-Gallai Conjecture [196]: Any graph on n vertices can
be decomposed into O(n) cycles and edges.
Thus, the Erd¨os-Gallai Conjecture holds for all classes of graphs for which
Haj´os’ Conjecture has been veriﬁed. Eulerian graphs with maximum degree
n −1 demonstrate that the conjecture of Haj´os’ would be the best possible.
Pyber proved the covering version of Erd¨os-Gallai Conjecture [409]. Erd¨os-
Gallai Conjecture was veriﬁed for graphs of linear minimum degree by Conlon
et al. [167].
Theorem 81 [167] For any α > 0, if G is a graph on n vertices with mini-
mum degree δ(G) ≥αn, then G can be decomposed into O(α−12n) cycles and
edges.

Cycle Decompositions
35
Theorem 82 [167] Let G be a graph on n vertices with average degree d.
Then, G can be decomposed into O(n log log d) cycles and edges.
Heinrich et al. [260] introduced a linear time procedure that computes min-
imum cycle decompositions in treewidth-2 graphs of maximum degree of 4.
The theorem of Girao [232] improves Theorem 81.
Theorem 83 [232] For any α, δ > 0, there exists n0 such that if G is a graph
on n ≥n0 vertices with δ(G) ≥αn, then the following holds:
1. G can be decomposed into at most n
2 + δn paths;
2. If G is Eulerian, then it can be decomposed into at most n
2 + δn cycles;
3. G can be decomposed into at most 3n
2 +δn cycles and edges; If, in addition,
G satisﬁes a weak expansion property, then the required number of paths or
cycles for each such G can be asymptotically determined.
4. G can be decomposed into max{ odd(G)
2
, δ(G)
2 } + o(n) paths, where odd(G) is
the number of odd-degree vertices of G;
5. If G is Eulerian, then it can be decomposed into ∆(G)
2
+ o(n) cycles.
All bounds are asymptotically the best possible.
The following result of Liu and Wood [360] provided a Haj´os-type result for
clustered coloring of graphs with bounded treewidth. Moreover, they proved
several positive results in the direction of weakening of Haj´os’ Conjecture.
Deﬁnition 7 [360] A graph H′ is called an almost (≤1)-subdivision of a
graph H if H′ can be obtained from H by subdividing edges, where at most
one edge is subdivided more than once.
Theorem 84 [360] For all s, w ∈N, there exists η ∈N such that every graph
with treewidth at most w and with no almost (≤1)-subdivision of Ks+1 is
s-choosable with clustering η.
Theorem 85 [360] For every s ∈N and every graph H, there exists η ∈N
such that every graph containing no H-minor and containing no almost (≤1)-
subdivision of Ks+1 is (s + 1)-colorable with clustering η.
A somewhat incomplete proof of Haj´os’ Conjecture for planar graphs was
given by Tao [458]. Seyﬀarth [439] modiﬁed and completed Theorem 86.
Theorem 86 [458] If G is a simple planar even graph on n vertices, then the
minimum number of cycles required in a cycle decomposition of G is less than
or equal to ⌊n−1
2 ⌋.

36
Graph Theory and Decomposition
Deﬁnition 8 [439] Let u be a vertex of degree two in G, and let N(u) =
{u0, u1}. Then, u is suppressible if u0u1 /∈E(G); the suppression of u is
the deletion of u and its incident edges, and the addition of the edge u0u1.
Two vertices of degree two, u and v, are simultaneously suppressible if each
is suppressible, and if u and v do not lie in a (unique) 4-cycle in G; i.e., v is
suppressible in the graph obtained from G by suppressing u.
Theorem 87 [439] Let G be a simple 2-connected planar even graph having
at most one vertex of degree two, and in which every vertex of degree four
is symmetric. Then, there exist two vertices of degree four, u and v, and a
cycle C0 through u and v, such that u and v are simultaneously suppressible
in G −E(C0).
A replication graph of G is obtained by replacing every vertex by a complete
graph such that two distinct complete graphs are disjoint, and, if two vertices
x, y of G are joined by an edge, then add all edges between the corresponding
two complete graphs. A uniform replication graph of G is one in which every
complete graph has an equal number of vertices. Thomassen [470] showed that
Haj´os’ Conjecture is false for almost all graphs, but only a few explicit coun-
terexamples have appeared in the literature. He related Haj´os’ Conjecture to
Ramsey theory, perfect graphs, and the maximum cutproblem and obtained,
thereby, new classes of explicit counterexamples. The next theorems are re-
lated to Ramsey Theory and perfect graphs.
Theorem 88 [470] Let k be a natural number, and let G be a graph on n =
3k3 (resp., 12k) vertices satisfying Haj´os’ Conjecture. Then G contains either
a complete graph on k vertices or an independent set of k (resp., 3) vertices.
Theorem 89 [470] Let G be a graph such that α(G)ω(G) < |V (G)|, where
α(G) be Independence number and ω(G) be the clique number of G. Then,
all but ﬁnitely many uniform replication graphs of G are counterexamples to
Haj´os’ Conjecture.
Theorem 90 [470] A graph G is perfect if and only if every replication graph
of G satisﬁes Haj´os’ Conjecture.
Conjecture 12 [470] Every graph in the projective plane or on the torus
satisﬁes Haj´os’ Conjecture.
On the other hand, Thomassen [470] showed that some of the graphs that
Catlin conjectured to be counterexamples to Haj´os’ Conjecture satisfy the
conjecture. He also characterized the graphs completely, which satisfy Catlin’s
conjecture. Whereas, Granville and Moisiadis [239] showed that Haj´os’ Con-
jecture is satisﬁed for all Eulerian graphs with a maximum degree of at most 4.
Theorem 91 [239] For every n ≥3 and every i ∈{1, . . . , ⌊|V (G)|−1
2
⌋}, there
exists a connected graph with n vertices and maximum degree at most 4 whose
minimal cycle decomposition consists of exactly i cycles.

Cycle Decompositions
37
Theorem 92 [202] All Eulerian graphs that are embeddable in the projective
plane or do not contain the minor K6 satisfy Haj´os’ Conjecture.
Fan and Xu [202] established that every counterexample to the generalized
Haj´os’ Conjecture can be transformed into a simple counterexample to Haj´os’
Conjecture by subdivision of parallel edges. They introduced the concept of
reduction with regard to it.
Deﬁnition 9 [202] Let G be a graph. A reduction of G is a graph obtained
by recursively applying one of the following operations:
1. Remove the edges of a cycle;
2. Delete an isolated vertex;
3. Remove a vertex u of degree 2 and add an edge joining its two neighbors;
4. Let u be a degree-4 vertex with distinct neighbors x, y, z, w such that xy ∈
E(G) and zw /∈E(G). Delete u and add two new edges—one joining x and
y and the other joining z and w.
Theorem 93 [202] For each edge uv ∈E(H), let m(uv) be the number of
edges between u and v and let the multiple number of H, denoted by m(H) =
Σuv∈E(H)(m(uv) −1). If G is an Eulerian graph that does not satisfy the
generalized Haj´os’ Conjecture, then there exists a reduction H of G that does
not satisfy the generalized Haj´os’ Conjecture, and the number of vertices of
degree less than six in H plus m(H) is at most one.
K¨uhn et al. [331] proved a result in terms of girth. Xu et al. [498] showed that
the edge set of each Eulerian graph that can be embedded on the torus can
be decomposed into at most n+3
2
cycles. The results of Heinrich et al. [261]
and Fuchs [219] are also noteworthy.
Theorem 94 [331]
1. Let n ∈N. Then, every graph G of minimum degree at least r and girth at
least 186 contains a subdivision of Kn+1;
2. Let n ∈N with n ≥435. Then, every graph G of minimum degree at least
n and girth at least 15 contain a subdivision of Kn+1.
Theorem 95 [498] The edge set of each even toroidal graph can be decom-
posed into at most n+3
2
circuits in O(mn) time.
Theorem 96 [261] Every simple Eulerian graph with at most 12 vertices
satisﬁes Haj´os’ Conjecture.
Botler et al. [118] proved a result on Gallai’s and Haj´os’ conjectures for graphs
with treewidth at most 3. Fuchs [220, 219] proved another important result
on Eulerian graphs.

38
Graph Theory and Decomposition
Theorem 97 [118] Let G be a connected Eulerian partial 3-tree with n ver-
tices, and let cn(G) denote the number of cycles in G. Then, cn(G) ≤⌊n
2 ⌋.
Moreover, if G is an Eulerian graph with n non-isolated vertices and maximum
degree 4, then cn(G) ≤⌊n−1
2 ⌋.
Theorem 98 [220, 219] Every Eulerian graph G of pathwidth at most 6 sat-
isﬁes Haj´os’ Conjecture.
2.5
Open Problems
Problem 1 [360] Haj´os made the conjecture that every graph containing no
subdivision of the complete graph Ks+1 is s-colorable. Dirac proved the con-
jecture for s3. It is open for s ∈{4, 5}, which would imply the Four Color
theorem.
Problem 2 [232] The problem of decomposing Eulerian graphs into O(n) cy-
cles is open and is equivalent to the Erd¨os-Gallai Conjecture,which says that
any graph on n vertices can be decomposed into O(n) cycles and edges.

Digraph Decompositions
A directed cycle decomposition of a directed graph G is a collection of directed
cycles whose edges partition the directed edges of G. A directed graph is
typically denoted by the letter D and is also known as a digraph. The cycles in
an undirected graph correlate in an obvious way to the cycles of length three or
more in the symmetric digraph associated with the graph. Many conjectures on
digraphs are discussed in this chapter. The book written by Bang-Jensen and
Gutin [63] deals with basic concepts of digraphs. Bermond [84], Gutin [242],
K¨uhn and Osthus [332, 333], and Ferber et al. [207] surveyed on diﬀerent
aspects of digraphs. Before discussing various digraph decompositions, it is
better to state three fundamental results on digraphs.
Theorem 99 Redei’s Theorem [414]: Any tournament T contains a Hamil-
tonian path.
Theorem 100 Camion’s Theorem [143]: A tournament T is strong if and
only if it contains a Hamiltonian cycle.
Theorem 101 Moon’s Theorem [382]: A strong tournament T of order n has
cycles of all lengths 3, . . . , n.
3.1
Hamilton Directed Graph Decompositions
A Hamilton directed graph decomposition is a partition of the edges of a
directed graph into Hamiltonian cycles. Every strongly connected directed
graph with a minimum in-degree and out-degree of at least n
2 has a Hamilton
directed graph decomposition. In 1978, Bermond [77] made a survey on it. The
four well-known results on degree conditions for the existence of Hamiltonian
cycles in digraphs are given below:
Theorem 102 Ghouila-Houri Theorem [229]: Any digraph on n vertices with
a minimum semi-degree of at least
n
2 (or a minimum degree of at least n)
contains a Hamilton cycle.
Theorem 103 Nash-Williams Theorem [450]: Let D be a digraph of order
n ≥2 such that for every vertex x, d+(x) ≥n
2 and d−(x) ≥n
2 , then D is
Hamiltonian.

Graph Theory and Decomposition
Theorem 104 Woodall Theorem [496]: Let D be a digraph of order n ≥2.
If d+(x) + d−(y) ≥n for all pairs of vertices x and y such that there is no arc
from x to y, then D is Hamiltonian.
Theorem 105 Meyniel Theorem [378]: Let D be a strongly connected digraph
of order n ≥2. If d(x) + d(y) ≥2n −1 for all pairs of non-adjacent vertices
in D, then D is Hamiltonian.
Bermond [76] had completely settled the case of length m = 3 and had given
some results for other odd lengths. The necessary conditions for the directed
complete graph on n vertices K∗
n to admit a decomposition into directed cycles
of length m are 2 ≤m ≤n and m|n(n−1). Bermond and Faber [79] proposed
a conjecture and proved another result. They further resolved the problem
for m, which is even and is a divisor of n −1. From Theorem 2 of Walecki,
the complete symmetric directed graph K∗
2n+1 has a decomposition into 2n
directed Hamilton cycles. In this regard, Tillson’s [475] results are important.
Deﬁnition 10 Let λK∗
n be the directed graph on n vertices in which, for each
ordered pair of vertices (u, v), there are exactly λ arcs joining u to v. For the
graph G = λKn, n is (m, λ)- admissible if m divides λ n(n−1)
2
, λ(n −1) is
even, λ is even when m = 2, and either n = 1 or n ≥m. For λK∗
n, n is
(m, λ)∗-admissible if m divides λn(n −1) and either n = 1 or n ≥m.
Conjecture 13 [79] The necessary conditions for K∗
n to admit a decom-
position into directed cycles of length m are suﬃcient as long as (n, m) ̸=
(6, 3), (4, 4), (6, 6).
Theorem 106 [79] The necessary conditions are suﬃcient if (i) m
∈
{10, 12, 14}; (ii) m ∈{4, 6, 8, 16} and (n, m) ̸= (4, 4), (6, 6).
Theorem 107 [475] K∗
n can be decomposed into directed Hamilton cycles if
n is even and n ̸= 4, 6. Whereas, if 2n ≥8, K∗
2n can be decomposed into 2n−1
directed Hamilton cycles.
To the question raised in [38] for digraphs whether the complete regular mul-
tipartite digraph K∗
r,s is Hamiltonian decomposable, Ng [393] proved a result,
and Alspach et al. [40] settled the directed cycle decomposition problem for
K∗
n. Alspach [37] proved the converse too, that is, a Hamilton directed cycle
decompasable tournament is regular.
Theorem 108 [393] The digraph K∗
r,s is Hamiltonian decomposable if and
only if (r, s) ̸= (4, 1) or (6, 1).
Theorem 109 [40] For positive integers m and n with 2 ≤m ≤n, the
digraph K∗
n can be decomposed into directed cycles of length m if and only if
m divides the number of arcs in K∗
n and (n, m) ̸= (6, 3), (4, 4), (6, 6).

Cycles of Varying Lengths
Concerning cycle factor with prescribed lengths in tournaments, Song [448]
extended the results of Reid [416]. Zhang and Song [510] proved that any
k-regular bipartite tournament with k ≥2 has a 2-cycle-factor, where a bipar-
tite tournament is an orientation of a complete bipartite graph. Li and Shu
[347] reﬁned Theorem 110. K¨uhn et al. [335] have extended these results by
showing that every O(k5)-connected tournament admits a k-cycle-factor with
prescribed lengths.
Theorem 110 [448] Every 2-connected tournament with at least six vertices
and not isomorphic to T7 has a 2-cycle-factor containing cycles of lengths p
and |V (T)| −p for all p such that 3 ≤p ≤|V (T)| −3, where T7 is the Paley
tournament on seven vertices.
Theorem 111 [347] Any strong tournament with at least six vertices, a min-
imum out-degree or a minimum in-degree at least 3, and not isomorphic to
T7, has a 2-cycle factor containing cycles of lengths p and |V (T)| −p for all
p such that 3 ≤p ≤|V (T)| −3, where T7 is the Paley tournament on seven
vertices.
Burgess et al. [140] gave general necessary conditions for a directed cycle
decomposition of K∗
n into t cycles of lengths m1, m2, . . . , mt. They gave a
complete solution if there are at most three cycles of length greater than 2.
Deﬁnition 11 [140] Let M be an n-admissible list and ν = ν2(M) be the
number of cycles of length 2 in the list M. The associated canonical list is the
nondecreasing list ˆ
M formed from M by removing all instances of 2 from M.
Note that the sum of the entries in ˆ
M is n(n −1) −2ν.
Theorem 112 [140] Let H be an n-admissible list with an associated canon-
ical list ˆH = (h1, . . . , hr) such that r ≥3, hr ≥2(r −1), h1 + . . . + hr ≤
2(n + r −2), and, if r is even, r ̸= 4 and h1 ≤r. Then, the complete digraph
K∗
n is H-decomposable.
Zhang et al. [509] conjectured the following theorem, and the same is proved
by Bessy and Thiebaut [87]. Moreover, they [87] focused on cycle-factors in
k-regular bipartite tournaments.
Deﬁnition 12 The digraph F4k corresponds to the k-regular bipartite tourna-
ment consisting of four independent sets A, B, C, and D each of cardinality
k with all possible arcs from A to B, from B to C, from C to D, and from
D to A. In fact, every cycle of F4k has length 0 (mod 4). Thus, for instance,
F4k has no 2-cycle factor of length 6 and 4k −6.
Deﬁnition 13 [87] A k-regular bipartite tournament is an orientation of a
complete bipartite graph K2k,2k, where every vertex has out-degree k exactly.

42
Graph Theory and Decomposition
Theorem 113 [87] For k ≥2, let D be a k-regular bipartite tournament not
isomorphic to F4k. Then, for every p with 2 ≤p ≤k, D has a 2-cycle factor
containing cycles of length 2p and |V (D)| −2p.
3.3
Bermond-Thomassen Conjecture
The Bermond-Thomassen Conjecture (Conjecture 14) is in fact the directed
analogue of the Corr´adi–Hajnal theorem (see Theorem 80) of 1963 [168] and is
famous as one of a hundred unsolved problems selected in 2008 by Bondy and
Murty [106]. In 1981, Bermond and Thomassen [84] proposed the following
conjecture:
Conjecture 14 Bermond-Thomassen Conjecture [84]: For any positive inte-
ger k, any digraph of minimum out-degree at least 2k −1 contains at least k
disjoint cycles. That is, f(k) = 2k −1 for each k ≥1.
Dirac [184], extended Theorem 80. It is trivially true when k = 1. It was
proved by Thomassen [467] when k = 2. Alon [34] proved that it suﬃces to
take f(k) = 64k. The method used by Alon [34] yields an upper bound on
the order of a minimum counterexample to Conjecture 14. For instance, when
k = 3, the order of a minimum counterexample is at most 42. The case k = 3
was proved by Lichiardopol et al. [351]. Bessy et al. [86, 85] veriﬁed Conjecture
14 for tournaments with a minimum in-degree of at least 2k −1.
Theorem 114 [467] For each natural number k, there exists a (smallest)
natural number f(k) such that each digraph of minimum out-degree at least
f(k) has k disjoint cycles. That is, every digraph with a minimum out-degree
of at least three contains two disjoint cycles.
Theorem 115 [34] There exists an absolute constant C so that f(k) ≤Ck
for all k. In particular, C = 64 will do.
Theorem 116 [351] Every digraph with a minimum out-degree of at least ﬁve
contains three disjoint cycles.
Theorem 117 [86] For any k ≥1, every tournament T with δ(T) ≥2k −1
contains k disjoint cycles.
This shows that Conjecture 14 is true for (almost) regular tournaments.
Lichiardopol [349] obtained a generalization of this result to the existence
of k disjoint cycles of prescribed length q in a tournament with suﬃciently
high minimum in- and out-degrees.
Theorem 118 [349] For given integers q ≥3 and k ≥1, a tournament T
with δ0(T) ≥(q −1)k −1 contains at least k vertex-disjoint q-cycles, where
δ0(T) is the minimum semi-degree of the tournament.

Digraph Decompositions
43
Theorem 117 proved that a regular tournament T of degree 2k −1 contains at
least k vertex-disjoint cycles. Lichiardopol [350] improved the lower bound.
Theorem 119 [350] For an integer k ≥1, every regular tournament T of
degree 2k −1 contains at least 7k
6 −7
3 vertex disjoint directed cycles.
Bang-Jensen et al. [62] proved Conjecture 14 for tournaments. Bai et al.
[58] considered the analogous problem for bipartite tournaments, i.e., vertex-
disjoint cycles of prescribed length in bipartite tournaments.
Theorem 120 [62] Every tournament T with δ+(T) ≥2k −1 has k disjoint
cycles, each of which has length 3. Further, for every value α > 1.5, there
exists a constant kα, such that for every k ≥kα, every tournament T with
δ+(T) ≥αk has k disjoint 3-cycles.
Theorem 121 [62] For every tournament T with δ+(T) ≥2k −1 and every
collection F = {C1, . . . , Ck−1} of k −1 disjoint 3-cycles of T, there exists a
collection of k disjoint 3-cycles of T which intersects T −V (C1)∪. . .∪V (Ck−1)
on at most four vertices.
Theorem 122 [58] Let BT be a bipartite tournament with δ+(BT) ≥qk −1.
Then, BT contains k vertex-disjoint cycles either of length 2q for even q or
of lengths in {2q, 2q + 2} for odd q. Moreover, if t1, . . . , tr ∈[4, 2q] be any
k even integers, then BT contains k vertex-disjoint cycles of length t′
1, . . . , t′
r
such that t′
i = ti for ti ≡0 (mod 4) and t′
i ∈{ti, ti + 2} for ti ≡2 (mod 4),
where 1 ≤i ≤r.
Take q = 2 in Theorem 122, then Conjecture 14 is veriﬁed for bipartite tour-
naments [58]. The following result gives the lower bound for the minimum
degree of f(k).
Theorem 123 [73] For every k ≥2 and for every graph G of order n ≥7,
⌊k2
4 ⌋and δ(G) ≥k2+3k
2
have k vertex-disjoint cycles of diﬀerent lengths, and
the bound on δ(G) is best possible.
Bensmail et al. [73] exhibited both an upper bound and a lower bound on
gt(k) for every k and hence conﬁrmed Conjecture 14 for tournaments.
Theorem 124 [73] Let gt(k) with k ≥1 be the smallest ﬁnite function such
that every tournament of minimum out-degree at least gt(k) has k vertex-
disjoint directed cycles of diﬀerent lengths. Then, for every k ≥1, gt(k) ≤
k2+4k−3
2
.
There is an improvement to Theorem 118 when q = 4. Bai and Manoussakis
[59] presented a shorter proof of Conjecture 14 for the case of k = 3.
Theorem 125 [370] For an integer k ≥1, every regular tournament T of
degree 3k −1 contains at least 21k
16 −10
3 disjoint directed 4-cycles.

Graph Theory and Decomposition
Theorem 126 [59] Every digraph with a minimum out-degree of at least 5
contains three vertex disjoint cycles.
Lewandowski et al. [345] generalized the question and asked for all degree
sequences that force the existence of k vertex disjoint cycles.
Deﬁnition 14 [345] For a nonempty and nondecreasing sequence (d1, . . . , dn)
of nonnegative integers and a positive integer k, the relation (d1, . . . , dn) −→
k means that every directed graph on n vertices with out-degree sequence
(d1, . . . , dn) contains k vertex disjoint cycles.
Theorem 127 [345] Let (d1, . . . , dn) be a nonempty, nondecreasing sequence
of nonnegative integers. The relation (d1, . . . , dn) −→k holds if and only if
the sequence (d1, . . . , dn) is large.
3.4
Lichiardopol’s Conjecture
Decades after the Bermond-Thomassen Conjecture, Lichiardopol [349] raised
another conjecture in 2010 on disjoint cycles of speciﬁc length in tournaments.
Lichiardopol proved a part of Conjecture 14 in Theorem 118 about the semide-
gree and raised it as a conjecture for the out-degree.
Conjecture 15 Lichiardopol’s Conjecture [349]: For given integers q ≥3 and
k ≥1, a tournament T with minimum out-degree at least (q −1)k −1 (i.e.,
δ+(T) ≥(q −1)k −1) contains at least k disjoint q-cycles.
Diwan [185] proved a result on Conjecture 15. Bensmail et al. [73] veriﬁed
Conjecture 15 for tournaments by using the probabilistic method for regular
digraphs, digraphs of small order, and digraphs whose order can be expressed
as some particular function of the minimum out-degree. Le [339] proved that a
function f(k) in Conjecture 15 exists for the class of regular simple digraphs.
Ma et al. [369] proved a result on Conjecture 15. Again, Ma and Jin [371]
improved Lichiardopol’s result. Since f(q) > 1 when q ≥4, and f(q) tends to
2 when q tends to inﬁnity, Lichardopol’s bound is improved signiﬁcantly. Wang
et al. [491] investigated disjoint cycles of the same length in tournaments and
provided a proof of Conjecture 15 for the case of 4 ≤l ≤9.
Theorem 128 [185] For every k ≥2, and for m ∈N, every graph of mini-
mum degree at least 2k −1 contains a cycle of length 2m modulo k.
Theorem 129 [73] Let k ≥1. Then, every graph of minimum degree at least
2k + 1 contains k even cycles of diﬀerent lengths. Moreover, every simple
digraph of order at most crd (where c and d are two constants satisfying c > 1
and 0 < d < 1) and minimum out-degree r ≥c0 max {k
1
1−d , k2} contains
at least k vertex-disjoint directed cycles of distinct lengths, where c0 = max
{2, (24 ln c)
1
1−d }.

Digraph Decompositions

Theorem 130 [339] Let G be an r- regular simple digraph. Then, there exists
a function f(k), such that if r ≥f(k), then G has k disjoint cycles of diﬀerent
lengths. Furthermore, g(k) = k2
2 (1 + o(1)).
Theorem 131 [369] For q ≥5 and k ≥1, every tournament with minimum
out-degree at least (q −1)k −1 contains k disjoint q-cycles. Similarly, let
f(q) = 6q2−16q+10
3q2−3q−4 . For integers k ≥1 and q ≥4, every tournament T with
both minimum in-degree and out-degree at least (q−1)k−1 contains f(q)k−2q
disjoint q-cycles.
Theorem 132 [371] For an integer k ≥6, every tournament T with both
minimum in-degree and out-degree at least 2k −1 contains 16k
15 −5 disjoint
triangles.
3.5
Kelly’s Conjecture
In 1968, P. Kelly (see [383]) proposed a conjecture. Note that if Kelly’s Con-
jecture is true, then the Bermond-Thomassen Conjecture is also true.
Conjecture 16 Kelly’s Conjecture [383]: Every regular tournament on n ver-
tices can be decomposed into n−1
2
edge-disjoint Hamilton cycles.
Thomassen [468] proved a result on Conjecture 16. K¨uhn et al. [336] proved
an approximate version of Conjecture 16 and extended the result to almost
regular tournaments. Conjecture 16 was settled for large tournaments by K¨uhn
and Osthus [333] and proved a stronger statement for dense r- regular oriented
graphs (i.e., oriented graphs with all in/out-degrees equal to r).
Theorem 133 [468] Every regular tournament of order n can be covered by
a collection of 12n directed Hamilton cycles.
Theorem 134 [336] For every η > 0, there exists an integer n0 such that
every regular tournament on n ≥n0 vertices contains at least ( 1
2 −η)n edge-
disjoint Hamilton cycles.
Theorem 135 [336] For every η1 > 0, there exist n0 = n0(η1) and η2 =
η2(η1) > 0 such that if G is an oriented graph on n ≥n0 vertices with at
least ( 1
2 −η2)n in-degree and out-degree, then it contains at least ( 1
2 −η1)n
edge-disjoint Hamilton cycles.
Theorem 136 [333] Let ϵ > 0 and let n be a suﬃciently large integer. Then,
every r- regular oriented graph G on n vertices with r ≥3n
8 +ϵn has a Hamilton
decomposition.

46
Graph Theory and Decomposition
The bound on r in this theorem is best possible up to the additive term of ϵn.
If r is smaller than 3n
8 , then G may not even be Hamiltonian. Ferber et al.
[207] obtained a simpler proof for the approximate version of Conjecture 16.
Deﬁnition 15 [207] If an oriented graph G contains r edge-disjoint Hamilton
cycles, then their union gives a spanning, r-regular subgraph of G and is called
an r-factor of G. Given an oriented graph G, reg(G) is the maximal integer r
for which G contains an r- factor.
Theorem 137 [207] Let c > 3
8 be a ﬁxed constant, let ϵ > 0 be an arbitrary
small constant, and let n be a suﬃciently large integer. Then, every cn-regular
oriented graph G on n vertices contain at least n(1−ϵ)cn2 distinct Hamilton
decompositions.
Theorem 138 [207] Let c > 3
8 and ϵ > 0 be ﬁxed constants, and let n be
suﬃciently large. Let G be an oriented graph on n vertices with δ0(G) ≥cn.
Then, G contains a collection of (1 −ϵ)reg(G) edge-disjoint Hamilton cycles.
Every suﬃciently large regular tournament on n vertices contains at least n
8
edge-disjoint Hamilton cycles. This is a slight improvement on the ( 1
8 +o(1))n
bound obtained by Kelly [314]. Conjecture 16 can be seen as an oriented
version of Walecki’s theorem. K¨uhn and Osthus [333] showed that Conjecture
16 is even true if one replaces the class of regular tournaments by that of
suﬃciently dense regular oriented graphs. This bound is a natural barrier since
the minimum in- and out-degree threshold that guarantees a single Hamilton
cycle in an oriented graph is 3n−4
8
. Theorem 140 implies Kelly’s Conjecture
for all large tournaments.
Theorem 139 [312] There exists a number n0 so that any oriented graph G
on n ≥n0 vertices with minimum semi-degree δ0(G) ≥⌈3n−4
8
⌉contains a
Hamilton cycle.
Theorem 140 [333] For every ϵ > 0, there exists an integer n0 such that
every d-regular oriented graph G on n ≥n0 vertices with d ≥3n
8 + ϵn has
a Hamilton decomposition. Furthermore, there exists an integer n0 such that
every regular tournament on n ≥n0 vertices has a Hamilton decomposition.
Jackson [293] posed a bipartite version of Conjecture 16 and H¨aggkvist and
Manoussakis [249] characterized it.
Conjecture 17 [293] Every regular bipartite tournament has a Hamilton de-
composition.
Theorem 141 [249] The family of bipartite tournaments is Hamiltonian if
and only if it is strongly connected and contains a 1-factor.

Some Other Conjectures on Digraphs
Carsten Thomassen [466] proposed Conjecture 18. H¨aggkvist [248] both sup-
ported and refuted it. He showed that there exists a constant c0 < 1
2 −2−15
such that Conjecture 18 holds with con in place of
n
3 . However, he pre-
sented an inﬁnite family of counterexamples to Conjecture 18. He [248] put
forth another conjecture (Conjecture 19) and proved two theorems in sup-
port of it. Conjecture 19 is closely related to Theorem 139. In this section,
δ∗(G) = δ0(G) + δ+(G) + δ−(G).
Conjecture 18 [466] Every oriented graph G on n vertices with δ0(G) ≥n
3
is Hamiltonian.
Conjecture 19 [248] Any oriented graph of order n is Hamiltonian if it sat-
isﬁes δ∗(G) > 3n−3
2
.
Theorem 142 [248] Every oriented graph of order n with δ0(G) ≥1
2 −2−15
is Hamiltonian.
Theorem 143 [248] Every oriented graph of order n with δ∗(G) >
3n−3
2
contains a 1-factor and is strongly connected.
A cycle of any length l, with l ≥
n
1010 through any given vertex, may be found
using this argument. Thus, Theorem 143 is more or less sharp. Theorem 144
shows that Conjecture 18 is false if n ≥46. Kelly et al. [314] veriﬁed Conjecture
19 approximately.
Theorem 144 [314] There exists an inﬁnite family of 1-factor-free oriented
graphs of order n with δ∗(G) = 3n−5
2
. Such families exist with δ0(G) = 3n−5
8
.
Theorem 145 [314] If δ∗(G) = ( 3
2 + o(1))n, then G has a Hamilton cycle.
Thomassen [465] proposed two conjectures. Of these, Darbinyan [171] dis-
proved Conjecture 20 and proved aﬃrmative results for Conjecture 21.
Conjecture 20 [465] Every 3-strongly connected digraph of order n and with
a minimum degree of at least n + 1 is strongly Hamiltonian-connected.
Conjecture 21 Thomassen’s Conjecture [465]: Let D be a 4-strongly con-
nected digraph of order n such that the sum of the degrees of any pair of
non-adjacent vertices is at least 2n + 1. Then, D is strongly Hamiltonian-
connected.
Theorem 146 [171] Let D be a k-strong (k ≥1) digraph of order n ≥8, and
let z0 be some vertex of D such that the sum of the degrees of any pair of non-
adjacent vertices x, y ∈V (D)\{z0} is at least 2n−1. Then, D is Hamiltonian
if and only if any (k + 1)-strong digraph with the sum of the degrees of any
pair of non-adjacent vertices x, y of D at least 2n + 1 and of order n + 1 is
strongly Hamiltonian-connected.

48
Graph Theory and Decomposition
Theorem 147 [171] Let D be a strong digraph of order n ≥3. If d(x)+d(y) ≥
2n−1 for any two non-adjacent vertices x, y ∈V (D)−{z0}, where z0 is some
vertex of D with the sum of the degrees of any pair of non-adjacent vertices
x, y ∈V (D) \ {z0} at least 2n −1. Then, D is Hamiltonian, or contains a
cycle of length n −1.
3.7
Open Problems
Problem 3 For all k > 3, Conjecture 14 remains open [345]. In the special
case of tournaments, stronger results are possible.
Problem 4 Burgess et al. [140] found few inﬁnite families of n-admissible
lists M for which K∗
n is not M-decomposable. Is there any other such inﬁnite
families exist?
Problem 5 Manoussakis proposed a conjecture [374]: Let D be a 2-strongly
connected digraph of order n such that for all distinct pairs of non-adjacent
vertices x, y and w, z, d(x) + d(y) + d(w) + d(z) ≥4n −3. Then, D is
Hamiltonian. Darbinyan [172] proved it partly and raised a related question:
Let D be a 2-strongly connected digraph of order n satisfying conditions of
Manoussakis’ Conjecture. Suppose that {x, y} is a pair of non-adjacent vertices
in D such that 2n −3 ≤d(x) + d(y) ≤2n −2. Whether D contains cycles of
all lengths 3, 4, . . . , n −1?

K4 −e Decompositions
Design theory is a branch of combinatorics that deals with decomposing mem-
bers of a ﬁnite set into isomorphic subgraphs. It has applications in tourna-
ment scheduling, ﬁnite geometry, algorithm design, experimental design, net-
working, algebraic geometry, software testing, and cryptography. The Latin
square, invented by Euler 200 years ago, is considered the beginning of design
theory. The BIBD and the special cases of ﬁnite projective and aﬃne planes
were the next subject of signiﬁcant study. The statistical analysis of patterns
and the geometrical properties of planes stoked this interest. Other designs
include 1-factorizations, room squares, tournament designs, and nested de-
signs. One of the reasons for the emergence of design theory is that the brain-
teasers, and the mathematical puzzles of previous centuries were studied in
the twentieth century in the light of statistical modeling [454]. One can refer
to [161, 45, 488, 166, 83, 358, 88, 485, 420, 453, 263, 415, 413] for detailed
study on design theory. Design theory is a vast area, and K4 −e decomposi-
tion can be considered a kind of G-design with G = K4 −e. In design theory,
the terms handcuﬀed designs and resolvable designs are used to describe path
decomposition and star decomposition, respectively. Thus,the study of K4 −e
is taken as a representative of designs in decompositions. The terms design
and decomposition are used interchangeably while discussing K4 −e decom-
position.
4.1
Block Design of Graphs
Design theory usually addresses incomplete designs, such as uniform block
designs, regular block designs, and pairwise balanced designs. Reed-Solomon
codes, developed in 1960, are widely used in electronic communication sys-
tems, while error-correcting codes use error-correcting techniques to ensure
accurate reception and reading of messages through noisy or unreliable chan-
nels [259]. Though Kirkman and Steiner introduced BIBD′s with k = 3 and
λ = 1 known as Steiner Triple Systems(STS) more than hundred and ﬁfty
years ago [317], the study of BIBD′s made back on track only in the 1930′s
by R. A. Fisher and F. Yates [211]. The observations on agricultural ﬁeld
experiments by and large inspired them to investigate more on designing.

Graph Theory and Decomposition
The Kramer-Mesner Theorem paved the way for proving many of the previ-
ously unknown problems [329]. The problem of the existence of designs was
resolved in 2014 by Keevash [310]. The existence problem for G-designs for
any given r-uniform hypergraph is resolved in 2023 by Glock et al. [233]. This
suggests that, given any complete r-uniform hypergraph G, the trivially nec-
essary divisibility criteria are suﬃcient to ensure that G will be divided into
edge-disjoint copies. One of the pillars of design theory is the graph case r = 2,
which Wilson proved in 1975. When G is complete, the problem that dates
back to the nineteenth century and was recently solved by Keevash corre-
sponds to the existence of block designs. Iterative absorption, which uses just
probabilistic and combinatorial techniques, is the basis of Glock’s argument,
which oﬀers fresh evidence for the existence of block designs. For hypergraphs
with a signiﬁcant minimum degree, they got a decomposition result and a
resilience version. A formal deﬁnition of G-decomposition or a G-design is as
follows:
Deﬁnition 16 Let G ⊂Kn; n ∈N be a block of Kn. The decomposition of
a complete graph Kn into isomorphic copies of G is called a G-decomposition
or a G-design.
4.2
Spectrum of K4 −e Designs
The G-design problems with G = Kr for some r < n have been treated as
existential problems. Hell and Rosa [267] generalized block designs by using
graphs other than Kr as G. Bermond and Sch¨onheim [82] solved block design
problems by taking G as a small graph with n ≤4 and G containing no
isolated vertices. Since most of the subcases were already proved, they made
an elaborate study on a quadrilateral with one diagonal and called it a Q-
graph and the corresponding decomposition as Q-decomposition. Billington
et al. [91] used the term K4 −e to denote the Q-decomposition. Since K4 −e
is also known as diamond graph (see ISGCI [173]), the K4 −e decomposition
(or the diamond graph decomposition) is identiﬁed as d-decomposition by
Kottarathil et al. [303]. One of the basic problems in design is that given a
graph G of order r, whether a G-design of order r exists, and if so, how many
designs of order r exist up to isomorphism for Kn.
Theorem 148 [82] The necessary conditions for a G-decomposition of Kn
with n(G) ≤n are
1.
n(n−1)
2
is a multiple of m, where m is the number of edges of G;
2. When gcd (the greatest common divisor) of the degrees of G is divided by
n −1, the result must be a natural number.

K4 −e Decompositions
51
Theorem 149 [82] The necessary and suﬃcient condition for a K4 −e de-
composition for Kn with a minimum order of six is n ≡0, 1 (mod 5).
Obviously, in any general graph G, m must be a multiple of 5 for K4 −e
[94]. However, for suﬃciency, one must explore the structure of the graph in
detail. It is easy to see that K5 cannot be decomposed into two edge-disjoint
K4 −e blocks. Though the necessary conditions for a G-design are known, the
real problem is establishing suﬃciency. Wilson type results [195, 494] showed
that, asymptotically, suﬃciency always holds. The necessary conditions for
the existence of a (v, k, λ) G-designs are:
Theorem 150 [485] Let m be the number of edges of G, and let d be the
greatest common divisor (gcd) of the degrees of vertices of G. If there exists a
(v, k, λ) G-design, then (i) λv(v−1) ≡0 (mod 2m); (ii) λ(v−1) ≡0 (mod d);
Moreover, if the G-design is balanced, then (iii) λk(v −1) ≡0 (mod 2m); and
if the G-design is resolvable, then (iv) v ≡0 (mod k).
The spectrum problem for K4 −e was settled by Bermond and Sch¨onheim
[82]. Note that K4 −e is a Θ-graph, and the spectrum for theta graphs with
up to 9 edges is tabulated in a survey by Adams et al. [24]. Chang et al. [149]
proved another theorem.
Theorem 151 [494] For a given graph (block) G and a given λ, the necessary
conditions 1 and 2 for the existence of G-designs given in Theorem 150 are
suﬃcient for all suﬃciently large integers v.
Theorem 152 [149] There are only one K4−e design of order 6, three K4−e
designs of order 10, and two K4 −e designs of order 11 up to isomorphism.
4.3
Resolvable K4 −e Designs
In combinatorial mathematics, there are famous problems such as the ﬁfteen
school-girls problem, the nine school-boys problem, and the nine prisoners
problem. The following problem was presented in 1967 by Dudeney as a puz-
zle [189], and Hell and Rosa [267] generalized it as the nine prisoners problem:
In a jail, there were nine prisoners of a particularly dangerous character. Each
morning, they were allowed to walk handcuﬀed in the prison yard. Here is how
they walked on Monday: If the prisoners are numbered from one to nine, the
numbers 1, 2, and 3 walked handcuﬀed, the numbers 4, 5, and 6 walked hand-
cuﬀed, and the numbers 7, 8, and 9 walked handcuﬀed. Can they be arranged
for Tuesday-Saturday so that no pair of prisoners is handcuﬀed together twice?
The solutions to the three above-mentioned problems can be obtained by con-
structing resolvable (15, 3, 1) K3-designs, resolvable (9, 3, 1) K3-designs, and
resolvable (9, 3, 1) P3-designs, respectively.

52
Graph Theory and Decomposition
Deﬁnition 17 A G-factor is a spanning subgraph of λKv, such that each
component of the G-factor is isomorphic to G. A (v, k, λ) G-design is said to
be resolvable if λKv can be factorised into r copies of G-factors.
Deﬁnition 18 If G is the complete graph Kk, a balanced (v, k, λ) Kk-design
and a resolvable (v, k, λ) Kk-design is nothing but a (v, k, λ) BIBD and a
Resolvable (v, k, λ) Balanced Incomplete Block Design(RBIBD), respectively.
A. P. Street posed the existence question concerning resolvable K4 −e design
at the Auburn conference (see [276]). Colbourn et al. [165] solved the problem
when n ≡16 (mod 60) with two possible exceptions. Mullin et al. [385] proved
a result on Pairwise Balanced Design (PBD).
Theorem 153 [165] There exists a resolvable K4 −e -design of order n for
n ≡16 (mod 60), n ≥16, except possibly for n = 496 or n = 736.
Theorem 154 [385] For every v ≥4 and v ̸= {6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15,
18, 19, 23, 26, 27, 30, 39, 42, 51, 54}, there exists a PBD (v, {4, 5, 7}).
A K4 −e Group Divisible Design, denoted by K4 −e -GDD, of type hn is a
triple (X, G, B), where X is the vertex set, G is a partition of X into groups
(holes) of size h each, B is an edge-disjoint decomposition of the edge set of
Kn;h (the multipartite complete undirected graph with G as the partition of
the vertex set X) into copies of (blocks) K4−e. A K4−e group divisible design
is called resolvable if the block set B can be partitioned into parallel classes,
each forming a partition of the vertex set of X. Denote it as K4−e -RGDD. A
K4 −e frame of type hn is a K4 −e group divisible design of type hn(X, G, B),
in which the blocks can be partitioned into holey parallel classes (i.e., each of
which partitions X\G for some G ∈G). A simple counting argument yields a
resolvable K4 −e design of order n exists only if n ≡16 (mod 20) and n ≥16.
Using Theorem 154, Ge and Ling [226] proved that:
Theorem 155 [226] The necessary conditions for the existence of a K4 −e
frame of type hn, namely, n ≥4, h(n −1) ≡0 (mod 4) and h ≡0 (mod 5),
are also suﬃcient, except possibly when (i) h ≡10 (mod 20) and n = 23, 27;
and (ii) h = 40 and n = 8, 12.
Combining the results of Colbourn et al., Ge and Ling, and Su and Wang
[165, 226, 455], the existence spectrum of resolvable K4 −e design of order n
was deﬁned by Wang [490].
Theorem 156 [226, 455] The necessary conditions for the existence of a re-
solvable K4 −e design of order n, namely, n ≡16 (mod 20), n ≥16, are also
suﬃcient except possibly for n = 116 or n = 296.
Theorem 157 [490] There exists a resolvable K4 −e design of order n if and
only if n ≡16 (mod 20), n ≥16.

Intersection Problem of K4 −e Designs
In 1975, Lindner and Rosa [359] discussed the intersection problem in relation
to STS. This initial work’s extension covered a large number of additional
combinatorial structures. The intersection problem of a given structure asks
for what values of k two elements of the structure that share k blocks, entries,
cycles, etc. can be found. The same element set must underlie both objects.
The ﬁrst intersection problem solved was of G = K3 in [359]. The intersection
problem of C4 designs appears in [92], of K4 −e-designs in [94], and with a
few exceptions in [164]. The remaining cases of all connected graphs G with
at most four vertices or at most four edges were solved by Billington [96].
Subsequently, it was solved for several small graphs G, as well as for other
combinatorial structures (see [91, 96, 513, 150, 280, 148, 149, 147]).
Deﬁnition 19 For a given n ≡0 or 1 (mod 5) and n ≥6, ﬁnd a pair of
K4 −e designs (V, B1) and (V, B2) of order n such that |B1 ∩B2| = k is called
the intersection problem for K4 −e.
Since it is possible for two K4 −e designs on the same set to have no common
K4 −e blocks yet some positive number of common triangles, the problem of
ﬁnding the number of common triangles between two K4 −e designs on the
same set is largely independent of the earlier K4 −e intersection result. A
work on 2-coloring K4 −e designs was done by Gionfriddo et al. [230]. It dealt
with K4 −e designs and the number of possible common blocks that two such
designs of the same order n and on the same n-set may contain.
Theorem 158 [230] The spectrum of λ-fold K4 −e designs that can be 2-
colored is precisely:
1. n ≡0 or 1 (mod 5): n ≥6 for λ = 1;
2. n ≡0 or 1 (mod 5) for λ = 1, 2, 3, or 4 (mod 5)≥2; and
3. n ≥4 for λ ≡0 (mod 5).
Deﬁnition 20 A commutative latin square of order n (in short, CLSH(n))
based on the set S = {1, 2, . . . , n} with 2 × 2 (ﬁlled) holes, denoted CLSH(n),
is an n × n array, where n is even, with one element from S in each cell, such
that the entries in each row and in each column in some order are the set S,
and where the cells (x, y) for x, y ∈{2i−1, 2i}, i = 1, 2, . . . , n
2 , contain a Latin
square of order 2 on the set {2i −1, 2i} (these are the holes).
The intersection problem for CLSH(n) was solved by Fu [218]:
Theorem 159 [218] For all k ∈{0, 1, 2, . . . , n(n −2)/2 = t} \ {t −i|i =
1, 2, 3, 5}, n ≥10, there exist two CLSH(n) having k common entries above
the diagonal and not in the holes. There are no CLSH(4); there are pairs of

CLSH(6) with k common entries for k ∈{0, 4, 8, 12}, and pairs of CLSH(8)
with k common entries for k ∈{0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 18, 24}.
Colbourn et al. [164] solved the intersection problem for K4-designs (that is,
S(2, 4, v)-designs) apart from some undecided values of orders 25, 28, and 37.
Let J(n) denote the set of integers {0, 1, 2, . . . , n(n−1)/10 = t}\{t−1, t−2},
and let I(n) = {k| there exist two K4 −e designs of order n with k common
blocks}. Let S and T be sets of integers such that S+T = {s+t : s ∈S, t ∈T}.
If S = T, then S + S = 2S, and inductively deﬁne aS for any positive integer
a.
Theorem 160 [94] For any v ≡0, 1 (mod 5), v ≥6, and v ̸= 11, J(v) =
[0, bv] \ {bv −1, bv −2}; J(11) = {0, 1, 2, . . . , 6, 11}.
Theorem 161 [97] For any v ≡0, 1 (mod 5), v ≥15, JT (v) = [0, 2bv]\{2bv−
1, 2bv −2}; JT (6) = {0, 2, 3, 6}; JT (10) = {0, 1, . . . , 12, 14, 15, 18}; JT (11) =
{0, 1, . . . , 16, 22}.
Billington et al. [94] discussed the intersection problem. If two K4 −e designs
of order n are given, is it possible to get two distinct K4 −e designs that are
diﬀerent in just one or two blocks but are on the same n set? This was solved
by the theorem:
Theorem 162 [94] I(n) = J(n) for all n ≡0 or 1 (mod 5), n ≥6 except
7, 8 /∈I(11), where I(n) is the set of all l such that there exists two K4 −e
designs of order n with l common blocks and J(n) = {0, 1, 2, . . . , n(n−1)/10 =
t} \ {t −1, t −2}; n ∈Z.
Billington et al. [97] considered two K4 −e designs (V, B) and (V, B′) and
determined the possible numbers of common triangles.
Theorem 163 [97] There exist two K4 −e designs of order n, based on the
same vertex set, having i common triangles in K4 −e blocks, for all i ∈
I(n) = {0, 1, . . . , t −3, t} where t = n(n−1)
5
, except that 1 /∈I(6), 13 /∈I(10),
and 17, 18, 19 /∈I(11).
The ﬁne triangle intersection problem for G-designs, which was introduced in
2012 by Chang et al. [148], is the generalization of the intersection problem and
the triangle intersection problem for G-designs. Chang et al. [149] discussed
the ﬁne triangle intersection problem for K4−e designs of orders v = 6, 10, 11.
Deﬁnition 21 Let B be a simple graph. Let T(B) be the set of all triangles
of the graph B. Two G-designs of order v, (X, B∞) and (X, B∈) intersect in
t triangles provided |T(B∞) ∩T(B∈)| = t, where T(Bi) = ∪B∈BiT(B), i =
1, 2. Deﬁne FinG(v) = {(s, t) : there exists a pair of G-designs of order v
intersecting in s blocks and t + s|T(G)| triangles}.
The ﬁne triangle intersection problem for G-designs is to determine FinG(v).

Theorem 164 [149] Let bv =

design, and [a, b] the set of all integers x satisfying a ≤x ≤b. Let J(v) = {s :
there exists a pair of K4 −e designs of order v intersecting in s blocks}, and
JT (v) = {t : there exists a pair of K4 −e designs of order v intersecting in t
triangles}. Fin(v) = {(s, t) : there exists a pair of K4 −e designs of order v
intersecting in s blocks and t + 2s triangles}. Let Adm(v) = {(s, t) : s + t ≤
bv, s ∈J(v), t + 2s ∈JT (v)}, where Fin(v) ⊆Adm(v). Then,
1. Fin(6) = Adm(6);
2. Fin(10) = Adm(10) \ {(1, 8), (3, 1), (3, 5), (4, 1), (4, 3), (5, 1), (5, 2)};
3. Fin(11) = Adm(11) \ {(3, 0), (4, 0), (4, 6), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (6, 0), (6, 1),
(6, 3), (6, 4)}.
4.5
The K4 −e Designs of Graphs with Small Orders
Mostly, studies on various designs are done on complete graph structures only.
The same thing happens to K4−e- designs too. In 2008, Kottarathil et al. [303]
started working on the possibility of K4 −e designs or K4 −e decompositions
on general graphs. In their studies, they used the term d-decomposition instead
of K4−e designs, as a K4−e graph is also known as a diamond graph. Here, in
this book, the familiar term K4 −e designs is used instead of the terms related
to d-decomposition whenever possible or suitable. A complete graph is the
typical graph structure explored in design. It suggests an ideal circumstance.
However, one might not be able to ﬁnd every circumstance to be ideal in
day-to-day life. Even there, one can be obliged to create some ideal structures
out of the local, imperfect occurrences they are dealing with. Hence, graphs
with vertices n ≤9 and those that are not complete graphs are examined.
The following theorem identiﬁes some forbidden structures for K4 −e designs
of graphs, where a general graph cannot hold a K4 −e decomposition. This
explains why general graphs cannot be decomposed into diamonds (K4 −e)
even if they meet the criteria outlined by Bermond [82] and by Billington [94].
The forbidden graph structures based on small graphs of order less than ten
were discussed in [303]. A given graph is said to be d-decomposable if there
exists a d-decomposition, a K4−e-decomposition, or a diamond decomposition
of the given graph.
Theorem 165 [303] If a graph G with n vertices and m edges has a K4 −e
decomposition, then it satisﬁes the following conditions:
1. G should be pendant vertex-free;
2. G should be cut edge-free;

Graph Theory and Decomposition
3. G should not be a subdivision graph of another graph G′;
4. Let deg(vi) be the degree of a vertex vi, and ai and bi be some non-negative
integers. A central vertex (resp., corner vertex) of a K4 −e is a vertex of
degree 3 (resp., degree 2). The degree of a vertex being of the form 3ai +
2bi; 1 ≤i ≤n implies that it is part of some central vertex and of some
corner vertex in some K4 −e’s. If G has a K4 −e decomposition, then

5. No two adjacent vertices of G are of degree 2;

7. No two adjacent vertices of G are of degree 4;
8. Let {u,v,w} be the vertices of a P3 ⊆G. If deg(u) = deg(v) = deg(w) = 3,
then G cannot be decomposed into K4 −e designs.
The next three results discuss some properties of K4 −e designs of general
graphs.
Lemma 3 [303] If a connected graph G has a K4 −e design, then the sum of
the degrees of the vertices must be a multiple of ten.
Theorem 166 [303] An Eulerian graph G of order n < 10 has a K4−e design
if and only if its degree sequence satisﬁes any one of the following patterns:
1. < 6, 6, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2 >;
2. < 6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4 >;
3. < 6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 4, 4, 2, 2 >;
4. < 8, 8, 6, 6, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4 >; or
5. < 8, 8, 8, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6 >.
Theorem 167 [303] For a positive integer not exceeding eight, Kn −e is
d-decomposable if and only if n = 4.
Theorem 168 [303] Let G be a k-regular graph of order n with k < 10.
Then, G has K4 −e designs if and only if it satisﬁes any one of the following
conditions:
1. k = 5 and n ≥6 is an even integer;
2. k = 6 and n ≥10 with n ≡0 (mod 5);
3. k = 8 and n ≥10 with n ≡0 (mod 5); and
4. k = 9 and n ≥10 with n ≡0 (mod 10).

4.5.1
Some Constructions on K4 −e Designs
This subsection discusses the construction of K4−e designs from some product
graphs and some other general graphs.
Deﬁnition 22 The corona product G⊙H of two graphs G and H is obtained
by taking one copy of G and |V (G)| copies of H; and by joining each vertex
of the ith copy of H to the ith vertex of G; 1 ≤i ≤|V (G)|.
Deﬁnition 23 The rooted product of two graphs G1 and G2, denoted by G1 ◦
G2, is the graph obtained by taking |V (G1)| copies of G2 and identifying one
vertex (root) of each copy of G2 to the corresponding vertex of G1 [235]).
Theorem 169 [303] The corona product of a d-decomposable graph with kP3,
where k is any natural number, is always d-decomposable, and if G is a graph
on n vertices having r copies of K4 −e, then G ⊙(kP3) has r + kn copies of
K4 −e.
Theorem 170 [303] The rooted product of a d-decomposable graph with an-
other d-decomposable graph is always d-decomposable. In fact, if G is a d-
decomposable graph on n1 vertices with r1 copies of K4 −e and H is a d-
decomposable graph on n2 vertices with r2 copies of K4 −e, then the rooted
product, G ◦H, has (r1 + r2n1) copies of K4 −e. If G = H with |V (G)| = n
and r copies of K4 −e, then there are r(n+1) copies of K4 −e on n2 vertices.
Deﬁnition 24 [303] The 01 graph on G is deﬁned as follows: Take any
graph G with n vertices and m edges. Let v1, v2, . . . , vn be the n vertices and
e1, e2, . . . , em be the m edges. Subdivide the ith edge ei and denote the new
vertex obtained as ei0. Introduce a new external vertex corresponding to each
ei0 and denote it as ei1. Join ei1 to the incident vertices of the edge ei and to
the vertex ei0 (see Figure 4.1).

Theorem 171 [303] There exists a d-decomposable 01 graph construction for
every graph with at least one edge.

Graph Theory and Decomposition
Deﬁnition 25 [303] Let v be a vertex in a graph G with deg(v) = d. The
orbital vertices of a vertex v denoted by orb(v) are deﬁned as the d vertices
added in the vicinity of v. It is equal to the degree of each vertex. If G is a
graph with n vertices and m edges, then the number of orbital vertices is 2m.
That is,
n
i=1
orb(vi) = 2m. If the degree of the vertex vi is k, then the orbital
vertices of vi are vi1, vi2, . . . , vij, . . . vik.
Deﬁnition 26 [303] Let G be a connected graph with n vertices and m edges.
Then, the construction of an orbital graph on G is deﬁned as follows: Add
orbital vertices to each vertex of G. Find the adjacency matrix of G. If aij = 1,
then join the edges vivij, vi+1vij, vivij+1 and vi+1vij+1 where 1 ≤i ≤n,
1 ≤j ≤k such that k is the number of vertices in the orbit of vi (see Figure
4.2 for orbital graph construction of P4).
FIGURE 4.2
The graph P4, its orbital vertices and the orbital graph constructed from it
[303].
Theorem 172 [303] For the orbital graph construction of a graph G with n
vertices and m edges, there exist m copies of K4 −e.
Deﬁnition 27 [303] Let G be a graph with n vertices, m edges, and k uniform
blocks of odd order. The subdivision block on G, Sk(G) is a graph obtained by
adding a vertex in the middle edge of each block so that the edge can be divided
into two equal edges and joining the new vertex to the vertex in the opposite
end (see Figure 4.3).
FIGURE 4.3
A block of Fn graph and its subdivision block [303].
Theorem 173 [303] There exists a graph G on l copies of K4 −e for any
natural number l ≥2.

K4 −e Decompositions
59
Deﬁnition 28 [303] Let G be a wheel graph Wn on n + 1 vertices. Let
v1, v2, . . . vn be the n vertices on the wheel and u be the vertex on its hub.
Then, the K(G) construction of a graph on Wn is obtained by taking the
induced subgraphs on v1, v2 and u and subdividing the edge v1v2 by adding
a vertex v11 on the edge v1v2 and removing the edge from v2v3 and ﬁxing
it between u and v11. Continuing this process results in a K(G) graph (see
Figure 4.4).

Open Problems
Problem 6 Diﬀerent types of intersection problems for K4 −e designs were
discussed in this chapter. The intersection problem for a pair of kite-GDDs of
type 4n was investigated by Zhang and Yonghong [508]. Similarly, the inter-
section problem for some seven-edge graphs was discussed by Hollis in [280].
Identifying diﬀerent types of intersection problems for various graphs is an
open problem.
Problem 7 Identifying newer block designs, the spectrum of other small
graphs, and resolvable designs of other small graphs remains open.

Part II
Decompositions into
Acyclic Graphs

Tree Decompositions
Some major types of cycle decomposition of graphs were discussed in the pre-
vious part of the book. This part concentrates on the acyclic decompositions
of a given graph. An acyclic decomposition of a graph G imparts a tree struc-
ture to G. This part examines the decomposition of a graph into general tree
structures and classical tree structures such as general tress, paths and stars.
The pendant number of graphs is also discussed in this part. Let G be a graph
and T be a tree. Then, the decomposition of the graph G into copies of T is
denoted as T-decomposition in this chapter.
5.1
Treewidth, Pathwidth, and Branchwidth
Pathwidth and treewidth of graphs have been introduced by Robertson and
Seymour [418, 419]. The decision problem aims to ﬁnd a path decomposition P
of G with a ﬁxed width and length. This is an NP-complete problem, as path-
width computation is an NP-hard problem. No algorithmic results are known
for minimum-length path decompositions. However, k-connected graphs can
compute minimum-length path decompositions of width k. Other optimization
criteria studied in this context include ﬁnding an interval supergraph H with a
maximum clique of size k and an interval diagram of length l. Minimum-length
path decompositions have applications in step-wise tile assembly, partner unit
problems, scheduling, register allocation, and graph-searching games. Every
graph with a bounded maximum degree and large pathwidth contains a subdi-
vision of a large, complete binary tree or line graph. Additionally, every graph
excluding a ﬁxed minor and with large pathwidth contains a subdivision of a
large complete binary tree or line graph (see [177, 269]). Tree-decomposition
and treewidth are complex concepts with numerous algorithmic implications
[100, 179].
Pathwidth and treewidth are fundamental parameters in structural and al-
gorithmic graph theory. Treewidth and pathwidth are the standard measures
of how similar a graph is to a tree and to a path, respectively. Pathwidth
refers to the size of a subgraph within a large binary tree, while treewidth
refers to the size of a wall in a large wall. Treewidth is a nonnegative in-
teger characterized by its width, which is the size of a tree-decomposition.

Graph Theory and Decomposition
A smaller treewidth indicates a more tree-like graph, and many NP-complete
graph problems can be solved in linear time using tree-decomposition. Tra-
ditional graph algorithms can solve linear problems with a small width, but
newer models require a larger width. The diameter, a crucial parameter of
the tree-decomposition, is the maximal distance between two vertices in the
tree-decomposition. The resulting time bound is at least proportional to the
tree’s height, which is at least half the diameter. In recent years, there has
been substantial interest in understanding the substructures of graphs with
large treewidth with respect to induced subgraphs.
Deﬁnition 29 The treewidth tw(G) of a graph G is the minimum width of
a tree-decomposition of G, and the pathwidth pw(G) of a graph G is the min-
imum width of a path-decomposition of G. Clearly, tw(G) ≤pw(G) for all
graphs G.
Deﬁnition 30 A tree-decomposition of an undirected graph G = (V, E) is a
tree T = (X, F), each of whose vertices x ∈X is labeled with a subset Ux of
V , such that
1. ∪x∈XUx = V (every vertex in G occurs in some Ux);
2. For all {u, v} ∈E, there exists an x ∈X such that {u, v} ⊆Ux (every edge
in G is internal to some Ux);
3. For all x, y, z ∈X, if y is on the path from x to z in T, then Ux ∩Uz ⊆Uy
(every vertex in G occurs in a subtree).
The width of such a tree-decomposition is the maximum of (|X| −1), taken
over all x ∈X, and the treewidth tw(G) of G is the minimum width of all
tree-decompositions of G [419]. Thus, tw(G) ≥0 unless V (G) = φ, when
tw(G) = −1. A fundamental result for pathwidth is the Excluded Forest
Minor theorem.
Theorem 175 Excluded Forest Minor Theorem [419, 269]: For every forest
F, every graph with a pathwidth of at least |V (F)| −1 contains F as a minor.
Theorem 176 [177] Let k ∈{1, 2, 3} and let G be a connected graph. There
exists an s−t path of weighted length l in Gk if and only if there exists a path
decomposition of width at most k and length l of G.
Theorem 177 [269] Let Tk denote the complete binary tree of height k. There
is a function f such that every graph G with maximum degree ∆and pathwidth
at least f(k, ∆) contains a subdivision of Tk or the line graph of a subdivision
of Tk as an induced subgraph.
Theorem 178 [269] Let Tk denote the complete binary tree of height k. For
every ﬁxed n ∈N, there is a function f such that every Kn-minor-free graph
G with pathwidth at least f(k) contains a subdivision of Tk or the line graph
of a subdivision of Tk as an induced subgraph.

Theorem 179 [269] Let GS be the class of graphs that contain no graph in
S as an induced subgraph. Then, GS has bounded pathwidth if and only if S
includes a complete graph, a complete bipartite graph, a tripod, and a semi-
tripod.
Bodlaender [99] examined treewidth in terms of diameter. Ding et al. [181]
investigated tree-decompositions (T, (Xt)t∈V (T )) whose width is close to op-
timal and such that all subtrees of T induced by vertices of the graph are
small. As a corollary of these results, they proved that the dilation of a graph
is bounded by a logarithmic function of the congestion of the graph, thereby
settling a generalization of a conjecture of Bienstock (see [181]).
Theorem 180 [99]
Every

decomposition of width at most 3k + 2 and diameter O(log n).
Theorem 181 [181] Every graph G of treewidth w has a tree-decomposition
(X, F) of width at most 2w+1(w+1)−1 such that |V (X)| ≤1+2 degG(v) 32w
for all vertices v of G.
Bodlaender and Hagerup [101] denoted D(n, k, K) the maximum, over all
n-vertex graphs G of treewidth k, of the smallest diameter of a tree-
decomposition of G of width K. Let E1 = Θ(E2), where E1 and E2 are
nonnegative expressions, to mean that there are constants c, c′ > 0 such that
cE2 ≤E1 ≤c′E2 for all values of the parameters occurring in E1 and E2. If
E2 = 0, then E1 = 0 as well.
Theorem 182 [101] Let n, k, and K be integers with 1 ≤k ≤K ≤n −1.
Then, D(n, k, K) has the following value:

In their fundamental series of papers on graph minors, Robertson and Seymour
[418, 419] proved two remarkable results. The Graph Minor Theorem implies
that every property of graphs that is closed under taking minors can be tested
in polynomial time.
Theorem 183 Graph Minor Theorem [418, 419]: Graphs are well-quasi-
ordered under taking minors.
Theorem 184 General Kuratowski Theorem [418]: For each surface S, there
exist graphs G1, . . . , Gn such that a graph can be embedded in S if and only if
it has none of G1, . . . , Gn as a minor.
One more standard notion of width for graphs, introduced by Robertson and
Seymour [418, 419], is the branchwidth. Branchwidth is the minimum width

66
Graph Theory and Decomposition
of a tree-decomposition of a graph where every internal vertex of the tree has
degree 3. Robertson and Seymour [419] showed that treewidth and branch-
width are equivalent, in that a family of graphs has bounded treewidth if and
only if it has bounded branchwidth.
Theorem 185 [418] Let n be an integer. Then, each inﬁnite set of graphs
with branchwidth at most n has two members such that one is isomorphic to
a minor of the other.
Short proofs of the following two results are given by Bellenbaum and Diestel
[71].
1. Thomas’ Theorem: Every ﬁnite graph has a linked tree-decomposition of
width no greater than its treewidth;
2. The Treewidth Duality Theorem (of Seymour and Thomas): The treewidth
of a ﬁnite graph is exactly one less than the largest order of its bram-
bles, where a set B of mutually touching connected vertex sets is called a
bramble.
The Treewidth Duality Theorem is the starting point for the proof of the
Graph Minor Theorem as well as the ﬁrst step in the short proof of the
General Kuratowski Theorem, where embeddability in any ﬁxed surface is
characterized by ﬁnitely many forbidden minors. Geelan et al. [227] deﬁned
branch-decompositions and obtained an analogous of Theorem 185 for branch-
width with a short and simple proof.
Deﬁnition 31 [227] A function λ deﬁned on the collection of subsets of a
ﬁnite ground set S is called submodular if λ(A)+λ(B) ≥λ(A∩B)+λ(A∪B)
for each A, B ⊆S. λ is called symmetric if λ(A) = λ(S \ A) for each A ⊆S.
Deﬁnition 32 [227] A branch-decomposition of a symmetric submodular
function λ on a ﬁnite set S is a cubic tree T (that is, all degrees are 1 or
3) such that S is contained in the set of leaves of T.
Deﬁnition 33 [227, 71] The width of a branch-decomposition is the maxi-
mum of the widths of its edges, and the branchwidth of a symmetric submod-
ular function is the minimum of the widths of all its branch-decompositions.
The branchwidth of a graph is a parameter closely related to treewidth but not
1–1 translatable.
Theorem 186 [227] Let F be a ﬁnite ﬁeld and n be an integer. Then, each
inﬁnite collection of F-representable matroids with branchwidth at most n has
two members such that one is isomorphic to a minor of the other.
Dourisboure and Gavoille [188] dealt with the length of Robertson-Seymour’s
tree-decomposition. The class of bounded tree-length graphs includes bounded
chordality graphs like interval graphs, permutation graphs, AT-free graphs,
etc. Bodlaender [100] gave a linear time algorithm for recognizing graphs of
bounded treewidth.

Tree Decompositions
67
Deﬁnition 34 [188] The tree-length of a graph is the largest distance be-
tween two vertices of a subset of a tree-decomposition, minimized over all
tree-decompositions of the graph.
Theorem 187 [188] Every outerplanar graph has tree-length ⌈k
3⌉, where k is
the chordality of the graph. Moreover, a tree-decomposition of width 2 and of
length ⌈k
3⌉can be constructed in linear time.
Theorem 188 [225] Let G be a graph with no chordless cycles longer than k
(a chord is an edge connecting two non-neighbors of the cycle). Then, G has
a tree-length of at most k
2.
Theorem 189 [188] Let T be any tree-decomposition of a graph G. Then,
length(T)(diam(T) + 1) ≥diam(G), where diam(G) represents the diameter
of the graph G. In particular, for a path with n vertices (which is of tree-length
1), every tree-decomposition of depth h must be of length Ω(n/h).
Deﬁnition 35 [10] A hole of a graph G is an induced cycle of G of length of
at least four. A graph is even-hole-free if it has no hole with an even number
of vertices.
The following conjecture was proposed and proved for subcubic graphs by
Aboulker et al. [7]:
Conjecture 22 [7] For every δ ≥0, there exists k such that even-hole-free
graphs with maximum degree at most δ have treewidth at most k.
For even-hole-free graphs of bounded degree, the cutsets can be partitioned
into a bounded number of well-behaved collections. Thus, Abrishami et al.
[10] proved that these graphs have bounded treewidth, resolving Conjecture
22. Even-hole-free graphs are a subclass of odd-signable graphs. Furthermore,
Abrishami et al. [9] proved a result in terms of the clean class of graphs.
Deﬁnition 36 [10] Let a graph G be signed by assigning 0 and 1 weights to
its edges. A graph G is odd-signable if there exists a signing function such that
every triangle and every hole in G has an odd weight.
Theorem 190 [10] For every δ ≥0, there exists k such that C4-free odd-
signable graphs with maximum degree at most δ have treewidth at most k.
Theorem 191 [10] Let δ be a positive integer, and let G be a connected C4-
free odd-signable graph with maximum degree δ. Then, there exists c ∈[1/2, 1)
and positive integer d ≥δ such that the treewidth tw(G) ≤
1
1−c(d + dδ + dδ2 +
. . . + dδd).
Deﬁnition 37 [9] A class C of graphs is clean if for every positive integer n,
there exists a positive integer w(n) such that every graph in C with treewidth
more than w(n) contains an induced subgraph isomorphic to one of the follow-
ing: the complete graph Kn, the complete bipartite graph Kn,n, a subdivision
of the (n × n)-wall, or the line graph of a subdivision of the (n × n)-wall.
Theorem 192 [9] For every forest H, forbidding certain connected graphs
containing H as an induced subgraph (rather than H itself) is enough to obtain
a clean class of graphs.

Some Other Methods
A necessary condition for the existence of a T-decomposition is that |E(T)|
divides |E(G)|. As a result of Wilson [494], this holds when G is a suﬃciently
large complete graph. Furthermore, this is also true for graphs with a large
minimum degree. More precisely, for every tree T, there exists a constant
εT > 0 such that every graph G of minimum degree (1 −εT )|V (G)| admits
a T-decomposition, provided its size is divisible by the size of T. Zaks and
Liu provide some results about decomposing a graph into edge-disjoint trees
[505].
Theorem 193 [505] Let G be a graph, and let Ti, Pi, and Si be a tree, path,
or star with i + 1 vertices, respectively. Let Mk be a full m-ary tree with k
levels. Then, G can be decomposed into

Yu et al. [503] showed that a large class of trees contain all caterpillars with
an odd number of vertices. Theorem 196 is asymptotically one of the best
possible for all trees with at least three vertices.
Theorem 194 [503] Let Tk be a tree on k vertices. Then, necessary and
suﬃcient conditions for Kn to have a Tk-factorization are the following three
necessary conditions: (i) n ≡0 (mod k); (ii) n ≡1(mod 2(k −1)); and (iii)
there exist integers x1, x2, . . . , xk, such that x1d1 + x2d2 + . . . + xkdk = n −1
and x1 + x2 + . . . + xk = k(n−1)
2(k−1) , where (d1, d2, . . . , dk) is the degree sequence
of H.
Deﬁnition 38 [503] Let Tk be a tree on k vertices with V (Tk) = {1, 2, . . . , k}.
Then, Tk is called bipartite spreadable if for some i, 1 ≤i ≤k, Tk has bipartite
representation: {a1, a2, . . . , ai} ∪{bi+1, bi+2, . . . , bk} = {1, 2, . . . , k}, so that
{bp −aq (mod k): aqbp ∈E(Tk)} = {1, 2, . . . , k −1}.
Theorem 195 [503] Let T2s+1 be a bipartite spreadable tree on 2s+1 vertices
so that T2s+1|2K2s+1. Then, T2s+1|Kn if and only if n ≡0 (mod 2s + 1) and
n ≡1 (mod 4s).
Theorem 196 [504] Let H be a tree on h ≥2 vertices. If G = (V, E) is a
graph with δ(G) ≥( |V |

|V |log|V |, and h-1 divides |E|, then there is
a decomposition of the edges of G into copies of H.

Tree Decompositions

El-Zanati et al. [191] investigated the factorization of the complete bipartite
graph Km,n into spanning trees. A spanning tree of Km,n necessarily contains
m + n vertices and m + n −1 edges. Hence, if T is a spanning tree of Km,n
and T|Km,n, then m + n −1|mn. For every pair of positive integers m and n
that satisﬁes m + n −1|mn, there is a spanning tree T such that T|Km,n. For
general m and n that are relatively prime, there is a spanning tree T and a
decomposition of Km,n into copies of T and a graph with fewer than m+n−1
edges.
Theorem 197 [191] Let m and n be positive integers such that m + n −1
divides mn. Then, there exists a spanning tree factorization of Km,n.
Theorem 198 establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the pairs of
positive integers m and n such that m + n −1|mn and all pairs of relatively
prime positive integers j and k.
Theorem 198 [191] Let j and k be relatively prime positive integers. Then,
there exists exactly one pair of positive integers m and n such that
1. j = gcd(m, n −1);
2. k = gcd(m −1, n); and
3. m + n −1|mn.
In fact, m = jx and n = ky, where x and y are the smallest positive solutions
to jx ≡1 (mod k) and ky ≡1 (mod j), respectively.
Fink [209] showed that the n-cube Qn can be decomposed into subgraphs

Deﬁnition 39 [209] Let H be a subgraph of a graph G. The boundary of H,
denoted ∂(H), is deﬁned as the set of all vertices in H that are adjacent to at
least one vertex of G not in H. If F is a tree, a set of nonempty and pairwise
nonisomorphic trees T1, . . . , Tn have common rootstock F if and only if each
tree Ti has a subgraph Fi, isomorphic to F, and furthermore, F has a vertex
b, called the bud, such that if bi is the vertex of Fi corresponding to b, then
∂(Fi) = {bi}.

Graph Theory and Decomposition
Theorem 199 [209] Let T = {T1, . . . , Tn} be a family of trees, each of size
n ≥2, and suppose that these trees have a common rootstock F of size k =
⌈log2m⌉. Then, the n-cube Qn is T decomposable.
5.3
Bar´at-Thomassen Conjecture
Bar´at and Thomassen’s Conjecture, known as the Decomposition Conjecture,
is the main subject of this section. The results related to paths and stars are
shown in the respective chapters.
Deﬁnition 40 [480, 479] Let G be a graph and k be a natural number. A pair
(D, f) is an integer k-ﬂow of G if D is an orientation of G and f : E(G) →
{0, ±1, . . . , ±(k −1)} such that

e∈E+(v)
f(e) =

e∈E−(v)
f(e) for every vertex
v ∈V (G). Furthermore, a k-ﬂow (D, f) is nowhere-zero if f(e) ̸= 0 for every
e ∈E(G). An integer 3-ﬂow is a ﬂow in a graph where the ﬂow on each edge
is either 0, ±1, or ±2 and is called nowhere-zero-3-ﬂow if the ﬂow on no edge
is 0.
Deﬁnition 41 [65] If v is a vertex of an oriented graph such that d+(v) ≡
d−(v) (mod 3), then the orientation is balanced at v (mod 3). An orientation
of a graph G is called a Tutte-orientation, if each vertex is balanced (mod 3).
If a graph has a nowhere zero 3-ﬂow, then a Tutte-orientation is obtained by
reversing the edges of ﬂow value 2.
Conjecture 23 Tutte’s 3-Flow Conjecture [106]: Every multigraph with no
1-edge-cut and no 3-edge-cut has a nowhere-zero-3-ﬂow. Equivalently, every
4-edge-connected multigraph has a Tutte-orientation.
Conjecture 24 Nowhere-zero-3-ﬂow Conjecture [298]: Every 4-edge-connected
graph admits a nowhere-zero 3-ﬂow.
The concepts of nowhere-zero-3-ﬂow and Tutte-orientation, were character-
ized by Jaeger in [298]. Moreover, he [298] suggested the weaker version where
4 is replaced by a larger number, and he called this the Weak 3-Flow Conjec-
ture. Jaeger [298] generalized the 3-ﬂow conjecture to the following conjecture,
which he called the Circular Flow Conjecture. This conjecture may not be true
when k is an even number.
Theorem 200 [298] A graph has a nowhere-zero-3 ﬂow if and only if it has
a Tutte-orientation where the ﬂow on each edge is either 1 or −1.
Conjecture 25 Circular Flow Conjecture [298]: If k is an odd natural num-
ber and G is a (2k −2)-edge-connected multigraph, then G has an orientation
such that each vertex has the same in-degree and out-degree modulo k.

Tree Decompositions
71
Theorem 201 [473] If G is an 8-edge-connected multigraph, then each edge
can be oriented and assigned a weight 1 or 2 such that, for each vertex, the
weighted out-degree equals the weighted in-degree. If the vertex set is divided
into two sets, A and B, then the number of edges directed from A to B is at
most twice the number of edges directed from B to A.
If every 8-edge-connected graph of size divisible by 3 admits a K1,3-
decomposition, then every 8-edge-connected graph admits a nowhere-zero 3-
ﬂow. Moreover, Tutte’s 3-ﬂow conjecture would imply that every 10-edge-
connected graph with size divisible by 3 admits a K1,3-decomposition (see
Section 7.2 for details). Motivated by this intrinsic connection, Bar´at and
Thomassen posed the following conjecture:
Conjecture 26 Bar´at–Thomassen Conjecture [65]: For any tree T on m
edges, there exists an integer kT such that every kT -edge-connected graph
with size divisible by m has a T-decomposition.
When the conjecture was made, it was only known to hold in the trivial cases
where T has less than 3 edges. An important tool in the study of Conjecture
26 is a result on modulo-k orientations, which was proven by Thomassen [473].
He showed that the edges of a highly edge-connected graph can be oriented
so that any prescribed out-degrees modulo k are realized.
Theorem 202 [473] Every 8-edge-connected graph admits a nowhere-zero 3-
ﬂow.
Theorem 203 [367] Every 6-edge-connected graph admits a nowhere-zero 3-
ﬂow.
A diﬀerent line of research was started by Bar´at and Thomassen [65], when
they observed that T-decompositions are intimately related to nowhere-zero
ﬂows. The results of the weak k-ﬂow conjecture by Thomassen [473] imply
that the conjecture holds for all stars. It was further veriﬁed for the bistar on
4 edges with degree sequence (3, 2, 1, 1, 1) by Bar´at and Gerbner [64]. More
generally, Thomassen [474] proved the conjecture for all bistars where the
degrees of the two non-leaves diﬀer by 1. Nash-Williams [389] and Tutte [481]
independently proved converses and Thomassen proved some theorems on it.
Theorem 204 [389, 481] If k is a natural number and G is a 2k-edge-
connected graph, then G contains k pairwise edge-disjoint spanning trees.
Theorem 205 Let G be a graph.
1. If G is a 171-edge-connected graph of size divisible by 3, then G has a
3-path decomposition [471];
2. Every 207-edge-connected graph G has a set E of at most 6 edges such that
G-E has a 4-path decomposition [472];

72
Graph Theory and Decomposition
3. Let k be any natural number. If G is a (2k2 + k)-edge-connected graph and
|E(G)| is divisible by k, then G has a K1,k-decomposition [473].
Conjecture 27 [64] Let T be a tree with t edges. If a graph G contains t edge-
disjoint spanning trees and t divides |E(G)|, then G has a T-decomposition.
Theorem 206 is the ﬁrst conﬁrmation of Conjecture 26, where T is diﬀerent
from a path or a star. Bar´at et al. [64] also proved that it is suﬃcient to prove
Conjecture 26 for bipartite graphs.
Theorem 206 [64] Let T denote the tree with degree sequence (1, 1, 1, 2, 3).
If G is a 191-edge-connected graph of size divisible by 4, then G has a T-
decomposition.
Theorem 207 [64] Let T be a tree with t edges, where t > 3. The following
two statements are equivalent.
1. There exists a natural number kT such that for any kT -edge-connected bi-
partite graph G, if t divides |E(G)|, then G has a T-decomposition;
2. There exists a natural number k′
T such that for any k′
T -edge-connected graph
G, if t divides |E(G)|, then G has a T-decomposition.
Another version of Conjecture 26 for bipartite graphs was shown by Bar´at
and Gerbner [64], and independently by Thomassen [474], to be equivalent to
Conjecture 26.
Conjecture 28 Bar´at-Gerbner Conjecture [64, 474]: For each tree T, there
exists a natural number k′
T such that, if G is a k′
T -edge-connected bipartite
graph and |E(G)| is divisible by |E(T)|, then G admits a T-decomposition.
Theorem 208 [474] Let G be a bipartite graph with partition classes A1 and
A2, and size divisible by m. If G is (4λ + 6m)-edge-connected, then G can be
decomposed into two λ-edge-connected graphs G1 and G2 such that d(v, Gi) is
divisible by m for every v ∈Ai.
Merker [377] proved Conjecture 26 for all trees of diameter at most 4. Another
breakthrough result was obtained by Bensmail et al. [74], where they proved
the full statement of Conjecture 26.
Deﬁnition 42 [377] H is a homomorphic copy of G if it can be obtained from
G by identifying some of its vertices and keeping all edges. Equivalently, H is
a homomorphic copy of G if there exists a homomorphism from G to H that
is bijective on the edge sets.
Deﬁnition 43 [377] Let H and G be graphs. An H∗-decomposition of G is a
partition of the edge-set of G into homomorphic copies of H.

Tree Decompositions
73
Theorem 209 [377] For every tree T on m edges, there exists a natural num-
ber kh(T) such that if G is a kh(T)-edge-connected graph with size divisible by
m, then G has a T ∗-decomposition.
In particular, if d is the diameter of T, then every kh(T)-edge-connected graph
G with girth greater than d has a T-decomposition. By Theorems 207 and 208,
it is suﬃcient to prove Conjecture 26 for bipartite graphs G on vertex classes
A and B, where all vertices in A have degree divisible by m, the size of T.
Combined with the previous theorems, Theorem 210 completes the proof of
the Bar´at–Thomassen Conjecture for large m.
Theorem 210 [74] Let T be a tree on m edges, and let G be a bipartite graph
admitting a T-equitable coloring. If the minimum degree in each color is at
least 1050m, then G has a T-decomposition.
5.4
Kotzig-Ringel-Rosa Conjecture
Kotzig–Ringel–Rosa Conjecture (or KRR Conjecture for short) is also known
as the Graceful Labeling Conjecture (GLC). The GLC states that all trees are
graceful. This means that any tree can be assigned labels such that certain
conditions are satisﬁed. The GLC is still an open conjecture. It was ﬁrst
proposed by Anton Kotzig in 1959. It was later proved for all trees with
at most 15 vertices by Gerhard Ringel and Alexander Rosa in 1967. Rosa
[422] called a function f a β-valuation of a graph G with q edges if f is an
injection from the vertices of G to the set {0, 1, . . . , q} such that, when each
edge uv is assigned the label |f(u)−f(v)|, the resulting edge labels are distinct.
Rosa also introduced a related proof approach to Ringel’s Conjecture called ρ-
valuations. Golomb [236] subsequently called such labelings graceful and this
is now the popular term. β-valuations originated as a means of attacking the
conjecture of Ringel [417]. Kotzig [327] has shown that almost all trees have α-
labelings. Rosa introduced β-valuations as well as a number of other labelings
as tools for decomposing the complete graph into isomorphic subgraphs.
Deﬁnition 44 There are mainly four types of graceful labelings of graphs,
namely, α, β, γ, and ρ labelings. They diﬀer in the way that the labels of the
vertices are assigned.
1. α-labeling: An α-labeling is a graceful labeling in which there exists an in-
teger k such that for every edge uv of G, either f(u) ≤k < f(v) or
f(v) ≤k < f(u);
2. β-labeling: A β-labeling is a graceful labeling in which there exists an integer
k such that for every edge uv of G, either f(u) < k ≤f(v) or f(v) < k ≤
f(u);

74
Graph Theory and Decomposition
3. γ-labeling: A γ-labeling is a graceful labeling in which there exists an integer
k such that for every edge uv of G, either f(u) < k < f(v) and f(u)+f(v)
is even, or f(v) < k < f(u) and f(u) + f(v) is odd;
4. ρ-labeling: A ρ- labeling is a graceful labeling in which there exists an integer
k such that for every edge uv of G, either f(u) < k < f(v) and f(u)+f(v)
is divisible by 3, or f(v) < k < f(u) and f(u) + f(v) is not divisible by 3.
Not all graphs have α, β, γ, or ρ labelings. For example, the complete graph
K5 does not have any of these types of labelings. A lot of the work on Ringel’s
Conjecture has used the graceful labeling approach, which is proposed by
Rosa [422]. The main motivation for studying graceful labelings had been to
prove Ringel’s Conjecture. The predominant approach to tackling Ringel’s was
via the much stronger Kotzig-Ringel-Rosa Conjecture. These conjectures are
discussed below. Since surveys by Gallian are holistic ones on graph labelings
and are updated regularly, this book does not go into the depths of graph
labelings. For his latest survey in 2022, see [222].
Conjecture 29 Kotzig’s Conjecture [222]: K2n+1 can be cyclically decom-
posed into 2n + 1 subgraphs isomorphic to a given tree with n edges.
Conjecture 30 Kotzig-Ringel-Rosa Conjecture [234]: Every tree has a grace-
ful labeling. In other words, the vertices of every n-vertex tree T can be labeled
by the numbers 1, . . . , n, such that the diﬀerences |u −v|, uv ∈E(T), are
distinct.
Conjecture 31 ρ-Conjecture [222]: Every tree has a ρ-labeling.
The GLC implies ρ-Conjecture, which is equivalent to Kotzig’s Conjecture,
and this one implies Ringel’s Conjecture [66]. An approximate version of Con-
jecture 30 was obtained by Adamaszek et al. [22] who proved it asymptotically
for trees with maximum degree O(
n
logn).
Theorem 211 [22] For every γ > 0 there exist η > 0 and n0 ∈N such that
the following holds for every n > n0. Suppose that T is an n-vertex tree and
∆(T) ≤
ηn
logn. Then, there exists a ⌈(1 + γ)n⌉-graceful labeling ψ : V (T) →
[⌈(1 + γ)n⌉].
The proof given in 2022 by Gnang [234] for Conjecture 30 claimed to be
the ﬁrst non-asymptotic result establishing a decomposition of K2n−1 into
any tree on n consecutive vertices. It provides a short proof of the KRR
Conjecture using a functional reformulation of the conjecture and does not
assume any restriction on the vertex degrees of the given tree. With the help
of a composition lemma, Gnang settled in the aﬃrmative the KRR Conjecture.
Theorem 212 [234] Every tree admits a graceful labeling.

Tree Decompositions

Theorem 213 [234] Let id ∈Sn be the identity element, and let ϕ be the
involution (n−1)−id. Given f ∈ZZn
n , let Aut(Gf) ⊆Sn be the automorphism

G ⊂Sn as well as a corresponding sign function s ∈{−1, 0, 1}G×Zn such that
f = σ(−1)

Theorem 214 [234] There are exactly (⌊n−1

maxσ∈Sn|{|σf (◦f)σ(−1)(i) −i|; i ∈Zn}|, where ◦f denotes the LCM of cycle
lengths occurring in Gf.
5.5
Ringel’s Conjecture
In 1963, at the graph theory conference in Smolenice, Czechoslovakia, Gerhard
Ringel posed the following conjecture:
Conjecture 32 Ringel’s Conjecture: If T is a given tree of size n, then the
complete graph K2n+1 is edge-decomposable into n copies of T.
A folklore conjecture similar to Ringel’s relates to decomposing complete bi-
partite graphs into trees.
Conjecture 33 [194] Every tree T with n edges decomposes the complete
bipartite graph Kn,n.
Both Conjecture 32 and Conjecture 33 are special cases of conjectures due
to Graham and H¨aggkvist (Conjecture 51 and Conjecture 52). El-Zanati
[50] proposed that Conjecture 51 and Conjecture 52 hold for forests with
k edges. The GLC implies Ringel’s Conjecture [422]. H¨aggkvist [247] general-
ized Ringel’s conjecture for regular graphs (see Conjecture 51 and Conjecture
52). H¨aggkvist [247] also proved that Conjecture 51 holds when the girth of
G is at least the diameter of T. Conjecture 30 and Conjecture 32 were proved
for many special classes of trees such as caterpillars, trees with ≤4 leaves,
ﬁrecrackers, diameter ≤5 trees, symmetrical trees, trees with ≤35 vertices,
olive trees [222], and very large bounded-degree trees [304].
Deﬁnition 45 [304] Let G be a graph, and let u, v ∈V (G). Let degG(u),
dG(u, v) denote the degree of u and the size of the common neighborhood of u
and v, respectively. A graph G on n vertices is (ϵ, p)-quasirandom if degG(u) =
(1 ± ϵ)pn and dG(u, v) = (1 ± ϵ)p2n for all distinct vertices u, v ∈V (G).
The next theorem states that a dense quasirandom graph can be decomposed
into a family of bounded degree graphs as long as this family contains suﬃ-
ciently many trees that are not too small or too large.

76
Graph Theory and Decomposition
Theorem 215 [304] For all ∆∈N and δ > 0, there are N ∈N and ϵ > 0
such that for all n ≥N and all p ∈[0, 1] the following holds: Let G be an
(ϵ, p)-quasirandom graph on n vertices, and H, T be sets of graphs satisfying,
1. |J| ≤n and ∆(J) ≤∆for all J ∈H ∪T ;
2. For all T ∈T , the graph T is a tree, and δn ≤|T| ≤(1 −δ)n;
3. |T | ≥( 1
2 + δ)n; and
4. e(H) + e(T) = e(G).
Then, G decomposes into H ∪T .
Ferber and Samotij [208] obtained an almost perfect packing of almost-
spanning trees with maximum degree O(
n
logn), thus giving an approximate
version of Conjecture 32 for trees with maximum degree O(
n
logn).
Theorem 216 [208] Let ϵ be a positive constant, and suppose p ≥(logn)36
n
and N ≤(1−ϵ)np

. If T1, . . . , TN are n-vertex trees with maximum degree at
most
(np)
1
6
(logn)6 , then asymptotically almost surely T1, . . . , TN pack into Gn,p.
A diﬀerent proof of Theorem 216 was obtained by Adamaszek et al. [22] (see
Section 5.3 for details). Allen et al. [33] generalized it and proved that:
Theorem 217 [33] Almost-perfectly packed arbitrary spanning graphs with
maximum degree O(
n
logn) and constant degeneracy can be decomposed into
large complete graphs, i.e., with bounded degeneracy and maximum degree
O(
n
logn).
Deﬁnition 46 An ordering of V (G) is D-degenerate if every vertex has at
most D neighbors preceding it, and G is D-degenerate if V (G) has a D-
degenerate ordering.
Theorem 218 [33] Given D and γ > 0, whenever c > 0 is suﬃciently small
and n suﬃciently large, if G is a family of D-degenerate graphs of individual
orders at most n, maximum degrees at most
cn
logn, and total number of edges
at most(1 −γ)
n

, then G packs into the complete graph Kn.
Allen et al. [32] extended Theorem 218 to perfect packings provided linearly
many of the graphs are slightly smaller than spanning and have linearly many
leaves. A maximum degree bound O(
n
logn) is necessary for concentration of
probability in the results used in randomized embeddings.
Theorem 219 [32] Degenerate graphs can be perfectly packed into complete
or dense n-vertex quasirandom graphs, provided that all the degenerate graphs
have maximum degree O(
n
logn) and in addition Ω(n) of them have at most
(1 −Ω(1))n leaves.

Tree Decompositions
77
To tackle Conjecture 32, many papers developed techniques based on the ap-
plication of probabilistic methods and Szemer´edi’s Regularity Lemma, which
is used in the study of large dense graphs.
Lemma 4 Szemer´edi’s Regularity Lemma [381]: The vertices of every large
enough graph can be partitioned into a bounded number of parts, so that the
edges between diﬀerent parts behave almost randomly.
Independently, Keevash and Staden [313] in 2020 and Montgomery et al. [381]
in 2021 proved Ringel’s Conjecture. Keevash and Staden used an embedding
algorithm in which the various subroutines are analysed by a wide range of
methods, some of which are adaptations of existing methods, whereas Mont-
gomery et al. used probabilistic methods. Both results are given here. Keevash
et al. [313] proved that any quasirandom graph with n vertices and rn edges
can be decomposed into n copies of any ﬁxed tree with r edges. The case p = 1
of Theorem 220 establishes Conjecture 32 for large n.
Deﬁnition 47 A graph G on n vertices is (ξ, s)-typical if every set S of
at most s vertices has ((1 ± ξ)d(G))|S|n common neighbors, where d(G) =

Theorem 220 [313] There is s ∈N such that for all p > 0, there exist ξ, n0
such that for any n ≥n0 such that p(n−1)

,
any (ξ, s)-typical graph G on n vertices of density p can be decomposed into n
copies of T.

Deﬁnition 48 [381] A rainbow copy of a graph H in an edge-colored graph
G is a subgraph of G isomorphic to H whose edges have diﬀerent colors.
Deﬁnition 49 [381] Let {0, 1, . . . , 2n} be the vertex set of K2n+1. Color the
edge ij by color k, where k ∈[n], if either i = j + k or j = i + k with addition
modulo 2n + 1. The existence of a rainbow copy of every n-edge tree T in
such an edge-coloring of the complete graph K2n+1 is called the near distance
(ND)-coloring.
Montgomery proved Conjecture 32 for large graphs using this concept.
Theorem 222 [381] For suﬃciently large n, every ND-colored K2n+1 has
a rainbow copy of every n-edge tree, and the complete graph K2n+1 can be
decomposed into copies of any tree with n edges.

Open Problems
Problem 11 [269] Analogous to the problem of induced subgraphs for graphs
of large treewidth, another open problem related to pathwidth is: what are the
unavoidable induced subgraphs for graphs of large pathwidth?
Problem 12 Conjecture 26 is open for each tree with 5 edges, except the star
S5 [65].
Problem 13 Conjecture 24 is an open problem. The relationship between
Tutte-orientations and nowhere-zero-3 ﬂows provides a strong foundation for
attacking this problem.
Problem 14 Conjecture 30 is known to hold asymptotically for trees of maxi-
mum degree at most
n
log n, but solving it for general trees, even asymptotically,
is wide open [381].
Problem 15 A related problem of KRR Conjecture is the Gy´arf´as and Lehel
Tree Packing Conjecture (see [244] for details). Here, a complete graph is
decomposed into speciﬁed trees, but the trees can be diﬀerent from each other.
This conjecture is proved for bounded degree trees by Joos et al. [304], but in
general it is wide open.
Problem 16 [10] The problem of connecting tree-decompositions with forbid-
den induced subgraphs remains open.

Path Decompositions
A path decomposition of a graph G is an edge partition of G into paths. The
question of the existence of path decompositions arose from the recreational
mathematics problem of nine schoolboys posed by Dudeney [190]. Though the
concept of path number appears to be due to Ore [396] and Erd¨os [365], the
term path number was coined by Harary [258] in 1970. The idea of path decom-
positions as such explicitly begins with the papers of Harary [256] and Lov´asz
[365]. In transforming a path-cycle decomposition into a path decomposition,
the key idea Lov´asz had was to partition each cycle into two paths. Donald im-
proved this idea by partitioning each pair of cycles into three paths. In 1985,
Akiyama and Kano [31] surveyed both degree factor and component factor
and the corresponding factorizations. Plummer [405] made detailed surveys
on graph factors and graph factorizations for the period 1985–2003.
6.1
Path Number of a Graph
Harary [256] introduced the concept of pathos and apathy, related to the path
partition of graphs. It was further studied by Harary and Schwenk [258],
P´eroche [398], and Stanton et al. [451]. Harary attended the FILE 68 con-
ference in November 1968 in Helsingor, and as a direct result, the path num-
ber of a graph or digraph was developed. While attending the conference,
David Hsiao and Harary had lengthy conversations that resulted in the for-
mal framework for directed graphs [257] based information retrieval from ﬁles
[285]. Ralph Stanton was suﬃciently taken with the idea of the path number
of graphs after hearing the talk in Kingston, Jamaica, on which the article
of Harary [258] is based, that he worked with Cowan and James to calculate
the path number for various classes of graphs, including trees, cubic graphs,
complete graphs, and complete bipartite graphs. A summary of these ﬁndings,
which were presented at a conference in Louisiana, is seen in [451]. In a lec-
ture delivered in New York, the ideas of packing and covering were discussed
as a generalization of path number, arboricity, and other graphical invariants
[256]. The linear arboricity of a graph, which has meaning in ﬁle structures,
was also deﬁned by them. The points of a digraph D represent records in a ﬁle
structure, and whenever record u refers to record v’s address, there is an arc

Graph Theory and Decomposition
(directed edge) from record u to record v. So it only makes sense to request
the fewest record addresses—all the arcs of D—necessary to trace over the
full ﬁle structure.
Deﬁnition 50 [258] The path number of a graph G is the minimum number
of paths required to partition E(G), and the path-covering number is the min-
imum number of paths necessary to cover the edges of G. In other words, the
path number of G, π(G), is the smallest number of edge-disjoint paths which
cover all of G.
Deﬁnition 51 The Kronecker delta is a function of two variables, usually
just non-negative integers such that
δij =

if i ̸= j;
1
if i= j.
Theorem 223 [258, 451] Let l be the number of vertices of odd degree in a
graph G, T be a tree, Kn be a complete graph, Then, the path number of G,

π(Km,n) =

m+n

if mn is odd;
⌈
mn
2m−δ(m,n)⌉
if mn is even.
where δ(m, n) is the conventional Kronecker delta.
An alternative path-covering invariant of a graph too was deﬁned by Harary
and Schwenk [258]. The minimum number of paths, which are not necessarily
edge disjoint, is needed to cover the edges of G. It is called unrestricted path
number) and is denoted as π∗(G). The relation between π∗(G) and the path
number π(G) was given in relation to cycle rank.
Deﬁnition 52 [255] The cycle rank, cr(G), is deﬁned as the number of cycles
in a basis for the cycle space of G.
Theorem 225 [258] The path numbers π and π∗satisfy the inequalities,
π∗(G) ≤π(G) ≤2π∗(G) −1 + cr(G), and the bounds are the best possible.
The complete graph Kn and the star K1,n are simple examples of graphs
attaining the lower bound π∗(G) = π(G). The upper bound is attained for
the two inﬁnite families of graphs described in [258]. The unrestricted path
number π∗for trees is determined as:

Theorem 226 [258] Let l be the number of end vertices of a tree. The nondis-
joint path number of a tree is given by π∗(T) = { l
2}.
Deﬁnition 53 [255] The arboricity of a graph G is the minimum number of
edge-disjoint spanning subforests that cover G and is denoted by Υ. Similarly,
the linear arboricity of a graph G is the smallest number of edge-disjoint linear
subforests (in which every component is a path) needed to cover G and is
denoted by Υ.
It is easy to see that for any graph, Υ ≤Υ ≤π∗≤π. Harary [256] proposed
the following conjecture:
Conjecture 34 [256] For any graph G, the linear arboricity is between
⌈δ(G)
2 ⌉and ⌈δ(G)+1
2
⌉.
6.1.1
Graphoidal Cover
As a special kind of path decomposition, Acharya and Sampathkumar [21] in-
troduced the notion of graphoidal decomposition, which is the decomposition
of a graph into internally disjoint paths or cycles. By imposing the condition
that the members of a graphoidal decomposition are induced paths or cycles,
Arumugam [52, 55, 54] introduced the concept of induced graphoidal decom-
position as well as that of induced acyclic graphoidal decomposition. One can
refer to [241, 56] for details. In a similar way, the concept of semigraph was
introduced by Sampathkumar [430, 431] as a natural generalization of graphs.
Deﬁnition 54 [21] A graphoid of a graph is a collection ξ of paths satisfying
the following conditions: (i) Every path in ξ contains a minimum of two ver-
tices. (ii) Each vertex can be an internal vertex for not more than one path
in ξ. If every edge of G is in the given graphoid, then the graphoid is called
a graphoidal cover η of G. The graphoidal covering number γ(G) is the mini-
mum cardinality of η of G. If |ξ| = γ(G), η is called the minimum graphoidal
cover of G.
Acharya and Gupta [20] extended domination to graphoidal covers and showed
that several ideas in graphs can be generalized by taking graphoidal cov-
ers as bases. Further, Arumugam et al. [426] and Suseela [457] brought out
the simple graphoidal covers in graphs and found that all elements of simple
graphoidal covers consist of induced paths or induced cycles, thus determining
the simple graphoidal covering number for trees, complete graphs, and so on.
Then, Arumugam [51] introduced induced path decomposition and induced
path decomposition number of graphs. Hamid and Abraham [8] studied these
parameters in detail and found two more decomposition parameters, namely
the induced acyclic path decomposition number and the cycle decomposition
number. Arumugam and Bagga [53] presented a survey of known results on
graphoidal graphs. Furthermore, they introduced the concept of graphoidal
digraphs and discussed several problems for further investigation. Gupta and

Jain [241] characterized graphoidally independent inﬁnite graphs, inﬁnite uni-
cyclic graphs, and inﬁnite 2-edge connected graphs.
6.2
Pk Decompositions
A k-regular path decomposition of G is a decomposition of G into paths
of length k. A k-path is a path with k edges. It has k + 1 vertices and is
therefore denoted by Pk+1. Many results of Pk decompositions are after eﬀects
of Bar´at-Thomassen Conjecture. However, the ones that are related to path
decompositions are described here (see Section 5.3 for other aspects). One
may refer to [397, 442] for Pk- decompositions.
Deﬁnition 55 For any positive integer k, a k-partition of a graph G is a
partition of E(G) into E1 ∪E2 ∪. . . ∪El, where l = ⌈|E|
k ⌉, |Ei| = k for
1 ≤i ≤l −1 and 1 ≤El ≤k and each Ei induces a connected subgraph of G.
Theorem 227 [399] If G is a 2k-regular graph, then G admits a 2-
factorization.
Hell and Rosa [267] deﬁned a balanced graph decomposition with the addi-
tional property that each vertex of λKn lies in the same number of copies
of Pk and named it as (λKn, Pk)-decomposition. Gyori [245] considered edge
partitions wherein the number of parts in the partition was the parameter
related to the connectivity. Theorem 229 was a direct consequence of another
theorem of Gyori [245], proved independently by Lov´asz, which established a
Conjecture of Frank (see [366]).
Theorem 228 [267] There exists a (2K2n+1, P2n+1)-decomposition for all
values of n.
Theorem 229 [245] Given an l-edge-connected graph G, l edges e1, e2, . . . , el ∈
E(G) and l positive integers m1, m2, . . . , ml such that m1 + m2 + . . . + ml =
|E(G)|, there exists a partition E(G) = E1 ∪E2 ∪. . . ∪El, such that ei ∈Ei,
|Ei| = mi, and Gi = (V (Ei), Ei) is connected for each i ∈{1, 2, . . . , l}.
Theorem 230 [245,

v1, v2, . . . , vl ∈V and l positive integers n1, n2, . . . , nl satisfying l

and G[Vi] is connected for i ∈{1, 2, . . . , l}.
Complete solutions on the existence of balanced path-decompositions were
independently presented by Huang [287] and by Hung and Mendelsohn [290].
Theorem 231 [287, 290] There exists a balanced (λKn, Pk)-decomposition if
and only if (i) λn(n−1) ≡0 (mod 2(k −1)); (ii)λk(n−1) ≡0 (mod 2(k −1));
and (iii) λ(n −1) ≡0 (mod (k −1)).

Path Decompositions

The Petersen graph provides an example of how 3-edge connectivity is not suf-
ﬁcient to imply the existence of a spanning Eulerian subgraph. The following
results are by Jaeger [296] and Alspach [36].
Theorem 232 [296] Every 4-edge-connected graph is spanned by a connected
Eulerian subgraph.
Theorem 233 [36] The collection of all paths P3 with vertices from an n-set
can be partitioned into copies of Kn, if and only if n ≡0, 1 (mod 4).
The analogous result for directed paths of length 2 was obtained by Heinrich
[266]. Tarsi [461] completely settled the question of the existence of (λKn, Pk)-
decompositions. Truszczy´nski [477] considered the question of the existence of
(λKn,m, Pk)-decompositions.
Theorem 234 [461] A (λKn, Pk)-decomposition exists if and only if λn(n −
1) ≡0 (mod 2 (k −1)) and n ≥k. For k ≤n −2 and λ(n −1) is even, λKn
is Eulerian.
Theorem 235 [477] If m ≥n and either λ is even or m and n are even,
then there is a (λKm,n, Pk)-decomposition if and only if λmn ≡0(mod k −1),
m ≥⌈k
2⌉and n ≥⌈k−1
2 ⌉.
J¨unger et al. [307] established suﬃcient conditions in terms of the edge con-
nectivity of the graph to exist a Pk decomposition for all values of k and
established another conjecture too.
Theorem 236 [307] Every l-edge-connected graph admits a (l + 1)-partition,
for l = 1, 2, 3, and every 4-edge connected graph admits a k-partition, for every
positive integer k.
Conjecture 35 [307] 2-edge-connected planar graphs admit 3-partitions com-
posed only by trails.
This implies that if G is connected and has an even number of edges, then G
admits a P3-decomposition. Bondy [105] conjectured on perfect path double
covers of graphs.
Deﬁnition 56 [105] A perfect path double cover of a graph G on n vertices
is a family P of n paths of G such that each edge of G belongs to exactly two
members of P and each vertex of G occurs exactly twice as an end of a path
in P.
Conjecture 36 [105] A set of paths of G such that each edge of G belongs to
exactly two of the paths and each vertex of G is an end of exactly two of the
paths.

84
Graph Theory and Decomposition
Li [346] proved both this conjecture as well as the simple path double cover
conjecture of Bondy [105]. Jacobson et al. [295], Pyber [410], and Dor and
Tarsi [187] gave substantial results in this regard. Note that the problem is
hard even for the claw K1,3 and the 3-path P4.
Theorem 237 [295] There exists a (G, P5)-decomposition for every 4-regular
bipartite graph G.
Theorem 238 [410] Every simple graph can be decomposed into at most four
odd graphs.
Theorem 239 [187] For any ﬁxed connected graph H of size at least 3, the
H decomposition problem is NP-complete.
Theorem 240 [397] There exists a Pk -decomposition of Km,n if and only if
mn ≡0(mod k), and one of the following cases occurs (see Table 6.1).

Heinrich et al. [265] showed a result in terms of balanced decomposition. Using
Mader’s Lifting Theorem [373] on edge-connectivity preserving reductions,
Thomassen veriﬁed the Bar´at-Thomassen Conjecture [472, 471] in the cases
when T is the 4-path P5 or the 3-path P4, respectively (see Theorem 205.1).
Theorem 241 [265] If G is a 3m-regular graph that contains an m-factor,
then G admits a balanced 3-path decomposition.
Favaron et al. [204] showed that the existence of a ⌊k
2⌋-factor is not suﬃcient
for G to be decomposable into paths of length k (see [119]). On the other hand,
they showed that, for a 5-regular graph to admit a 5-path decomposition, it
is suﬃcient for it to contain a perfect matching and no cycles of length 4, and
stated the following conjecture, where the degree of the vertices of the graph
is decreased by one-half, but a perfect matching is required.

Path Decompositions

Conjecture 37 Favaron Conjecture [204]: Let G be a k-regular graph, where
k is odd. If G contains a perfect matching, then G admits a Pk-decomposition.
Botler and Hoﬀmann [109] proved Conjecture 37 for (2k + 1)-regular graphs
that contain special spanning 2k-regular graphs. Botler et al. [113] proposed
Conjecture 38. Botler and Wakabayashi [119] proved a weakening of Conjec-
ture 37 and proved Conjecture 38 partially.
Conjecture 38 [113] For positive integers m and k, the following statements
hold:
1. If k is odd, then every mk-regular graph that contains an m-factor admits
a balanced Pk-decomposition;
2. Every 2mk-regular graph admits a balanced Pk-decomposition.
Theorem 242 [119] For every positive integer k,
1. There is a positive integer m0 such that, if G is a 2mk-regular graph with
m ≥m0, then G admits a Pk-decomposition;
2. If k is odd, there is a positive integer m0 such that, if G is an mk-regular
graph with m ≥m0 and containing an m-factor, then G admits a Pk-
decomposition.
The next result is concerned with highly edge-connected graphs:
Theorem 243 [119] There is a positive integer mk such that if G is an mk-
edge-connected graph whose number of edges is divisible by k, then G admits
a Pk-decomposition.
Botler et al. [115] veriﬁed Conjecture 26 (Bar´at and Thomassen’s Conjecture)
and an equivalent conjecture on bipartite graphs (Conjecture 28) for paths of
any given length. They proved that:
Theorem 244 [115] For path Pk of length k,

kPk ≤4k2 + 10k −4
if k is odd;
kPk ≤26k + 8r −8, with r = max{32(k-1), k(k + 2)}
if k is even.
It was improved by Bensmail et al. [75]. They showed that if the graph is
24-edge-connected, then a large minimum degree is a suﬃcient condition for
path-decompositions.
Theorem 245 [75] For every integer k ≥2, there exists dk such that every
4-edge-connected Eulerian graph with a minimum degree of at least dk has a
decomposition into paths of length k and a path of length at most k.
Botler and Hoﬀmann [109] veriﬁed Conjecture 37 for (2k + 1)-regular graphs
that contain the kth power of a spanning cycle and for 5-regular graphs that
contain certain spanning 4-regular Cayley graphs.

Graph Theory and Decomposition
Deﬁnition 57 [109] Let Γ be a ﬁnite group of order n, + be the group oper-
ation of Γ, and 0 be the identity of Γ. Given two elements g, r of Γ, {g, r} is
a simple commutative generator if (i) 0 /∈{g, r, 2g, 2r}; (ii) g /∈{r, −r}; and
(iii) g + r = r + g.
Deﬁnition 58 [109] Given a simple commutative generator {g, r}, a simple
5-regular graph G is a {g, r}-graph if G contains a spanning Cayley graph
generated by {g, r}.
Theorem 246 [109] Let S = {g, −g, r, −r}, and let C = X(Γ, S) be a Cayley
graph. Then, every {g, r}-graph admits a 5-path decomposition.
6.2.1
P3 Decompositions
This subsection discusses the Pk decomposition with special reference to k = 3.
Kotzig [279] asked about the characterization of the P2k+1 path decomposition
of 2k + 1-regular graphs. This problem is also examined together with other
problems in this subsection and in Subsection 6.2.3.
Problem 17 [279] What are the necessary and suﬃcient conditions for an
r-regular simple graph to admit a decomposition into paths of length r for odd
r > 3?
A necessary condition is that G admits a decomposition into a k−1
2 -factor and
a k+1
2 -factor. For cubic graphs, the existence of a 1-factor is both necessary
and suﬃcient. Even more, each 1-factor is extendable to a decomposition of the
graph into paths of length 3, where the middle edges of the paths coincide with
the 1-factor. Favaron et al. [204] conjectured that the existence of a 1-factor
is indeed a suﬃcient condition for Kotzig’s problem. They also conjectured
that in planar 5-regular graphs, all 1-factors are extendable. The existence
of a (G, P3)-decomposition is equivalent to the existence of a 1-factor in the
line graph of G. Horton [284], Heinrich [262], Bermond et al. [80], and Ushio
[483, 487] proved some key results.
Theorem 247 [144] There is a (G, P3)-decomposition if and only if each
component of G has an even number of edges.
Theorem 248 [284, 262, 80] There exists a resolvable (λKn, Pk)-design (k ≥
4) if and only if n ≡0 (mod k) and λk(n −1) ≡0 (mod 2(k −1)).
Theorem 249 [483] There exists a resolvable (Km,n, P3)-decomposition if
and only if m + n ≡0 (mod 3), m ≤2n ≤4m, and 3mn ≡0 (mod 2(m + n)).
Theorem 250 [487] There exists a resolvable (λKm,n, P3)- design if and only
if mn ≡0 (mod 3) and λn(m −1) ≡0(mod 4).

6.2.2
P4 Decompositions
Here, the focus of discussion is about P4 decomposition or a 3-path decompo-
sition of a graph. For the problem raised by Kotzig (see Problem 17), if k = 1,
the answer is trivial, and if k = 2, Kotzig [324] has shown that:
Theorem 251 [324] A connected graph admits a 2-path decomposition if and
only if it has an even number of edges.
Kotzig [279] claimed that if G is a 3-regular graph, there exists a (G, P4)-
design if and only if G has a 1-factor. Bondy [105] posed the following problem:
Problem 18 [105] Which simple graphs admit a k-path decomposition?
A 3-path decomposition of 3-regular graphs must be balanced. In the case of
3-regular graphs, Bouchet and Fouquet [120], Cunningham [105], and Kotzig
[324] independently showed that:
Theorem 252 [120, 105, 324] A 3-regular graph G admits a 3-path decom-
position if and only if G has a 1-factor.
Theorem 253 Babler’s Theorem [31]: Let G be a 2-edge-connected, r-regular
graph, where r is odd. Then, for any even k, 0 < k ≤2r
3 , G has a k-factor.
By characterizing graphs of maximum degree 4 that admit a triangle-free
Eulerian tour, Heinrich et al. [265] proved that:
Theorem 254 [265] Let G be a simple connected 3m-regular graph with no
cut-edge for odd m. Then, G admits a balanced 3-path decomposition.
Theorem 255 [265] Every simple r-regular graph G admits a balanced 4-path
decomposition if r ≡0(mod 3) and G has no cut-edge when r is odd.
Theorem 256 [265] A connected 4-regular graph G admits a P4-decomposition
if and only if |E(G)| ≡0(mod 3).
6.2.3
P5 Decompositions
This subsection discusses the special case of the Pk decomposition when k =
5. Favaron et al. [204] extended Theorem 252. Botler et al. [116] partially
answered Problem 17 for the case k = 2 by proving that the existence of a
perfect matching is suﬃcient for a triangle-free 5-regular graph to admit a
5-path decomposition.
Theorem 257 [204] Every 5-regular graph that contains a perfect matching
and no cycles of length 4 admits a 5-path decomposition.
Botler et al. [112] considered the following slightly diﬀerent (but also equiva-
lent) version of Conjecture 26 (see Section 5.3 for details) and [112], veriﬁed
Conjecture 39 for paths of any given length.

Graph Theory and Decomposition
Conjecture 39 [112] For any ﬁxed tree T, there exists a natural number kT
such that, if G is a kT -edge-connected bipartite graph and |E(G)| is divisible
by 2|E(T)|, then G admits a T-decomposition.
Theorem 258 [112] Let k ≥2 and r = max{128, 32k + 32, k(2k −1)}. Let G
be a bipartite graph such that |E(G)| is divisible by 2k. If G is (12k −6 + 4r)-
edge-connected, then G admits a decomposition into paths of length k.
Theorem 259 [113] If G is a 134-edge-connected bipartite graph and |E(G)|
is divisible by 5, then G admits a 5-path decomposition.

Path Decompositions using Girth
The girth of an undirected graph is the length of the shortest cycle contained
in the graph. If the graph does not contain any cycles, its girth is deﬁned to
be inﬁnity. For example, C4 and grid have girth 4. A triangular mesh has girth
3. A graph with girth four or more is triangle-free. A graph with a small girth
is more likely to be connected than a graph with a large girth. Kouider and
Lonc [328] proved a theorem and stated Conjecture 40. To solve Conjecture
40, prove it for graphs with girth g < k+3
2 . Kouider and Lonc [328] proved
Conjecture 40 for k = 3.
Theorem 260 [328] If G is a 2k-regular graph with girth g ≥
k+3
2 , then
G admits a balanced Pk-decomposition. Moreover, if k is even, then every
bipartite k-regular graph with girth g ≥k+3
2
admits a Pk-decomposition.
Conjecture 40 Kouider-Lonc Conjecture [328]: If G is a 2k-regular graph
with girth at least g such that k ≤2g −3, then G admits a balanced Pk-
decomposition.
Thomassen proposed Conjecture 41 in terms of the girth of a graph. The
complete bipartite graphs Km,n with n large compared to m show that p = 1
cannot always be satisﬁed in Conjecture 41. Thomassen [472] and Botler et
al. [116] proved in support of this conjecture.
Conjecture 41 Thomassen’s Conjecture on girth [472]: For natural num-
bers m, g, there exists a natural number h(m, g) such that the following
holds: If G is an h(m, g)-edge-connected graph, then G contains a collection
G1, G2, . . . , Gp of pairwise edge-disjoint m-edge-connected subgraphs of girth
at least g such that their union contains all vertices of G.
Theorem 261 [472] A graph of edge-connectivity at least 10101014
has an
edge-decomposition into paths of length 4 if and only if its size is divisible
by 4. Moreover, a graph of girth greater than m and of edge-connectivity at

Path Decompositions
89
least 8m has an edge-decomposition into paths of length m, provided its size is
divisible by m and m is a power of 2.
Theorem 262 [116] Every triangle-free 5-regular graph that contains a per-
fect matching admits a 5-path decomposition.
This result has veriﬁed Conjecture 37 for 5-regular graphs with girth at least
4. Botler et al. [114] proved that:
Theorem 263 [114]
1. If k is odd and m > 2⌊k−2
g−2⌋, then every mk-regular graph with girth at
least g that contains an m-factor admits a Pk-decomposition;
2. If m > ⌊k−2
g−2⌋, then every 2mk-regular graph with girth at least g admits a
Pk-decomposition.
Theorem 264 [114] Let G be an mk-regular graph with girth at least g ≥3,
which contains an m-factor. Let k and m be positive integers such that k is
odd. If m > ⌊2 k−2
g−2⌋, then G admits a balanced Pk-decomposition.
Theorem 265 [116] Let k ≥3 and G be a (2k-1)-regular graph of girth at
least 2k −2 that admits a perfect matching. Then, G has a decomposition into
paths of length 2k −1.
Botler and Wakabayashi [119] presented a generalization of another result of
Botler et al. [116]. They [119] tackled three conjectures on H-decomposition
of graphs and obtained results for the case H = Pk by ﬁrst decomposing the
given graph into trails and then using a disentangling lemma. Two of these
results solved weakenings of Conjecture 40 of Kouider and Lonc [328]. Botler
and Wakabayashi [119] proved that Conjecture 40 holds for k = 4.
Theorem 266 [119] Every odd k-regular graph with girth at least k −1 and
containing a perfect matching admit Pk-decompositions.
Theorem 267 [119] If G is an 8-regular graph, then G admits a balanced
4-path decomposition.
6.4
Path Decompositions of Digraphs
In a previous chapter, the cyclic decomposition of a graph into various types
of digraphs was discussed. This section deals with the directed path decom-
position of graphs. There is a natural lower bound for the number of paths
needed in an edge decomposition of a directed graph D in terms of its degree
sequence. This is given by the excess of D. The excesses of all vertices sum to
zero.

90
Graph Theory and Decomposition
Deﬁnition 59 [361] The excess of D, denoted as ex(D), is the sum of
|d+(v)−d−(v)|
2
over all vertices v of D, where d+(v) and d−(v) are, respec-
tively, the out-degree and in-degree of a vertex v. The excess at v is ex(v) =
d+
D(v) −d−
D(v) and similarly deﬁned the positive and negative excess at v as,
respectively, ex+(v) = max{ex(v), 0} and ex−(v) = max{−ex(v), 0}.
Deﬁnition 60 A path decomposition of a digraph G (having no loops or mul-
tiple arcs) is a family of simple paths such that every arc of G lies on precisely
one of the paths of the family. The path number of a digraph, denoted as pn(G),
is the minimal number of paths necessary to form a path decomposition of G.
Alspach and Pullman [44] obtained a lower bound for the path number of a
digraph involving only the in- and out-degrees of its vertices and proposed a
conjecture.
Conjecture 42 [44] For any digraph G on n vertices, if n is suﬃciently large,
perhaps for all n ≥4, then ⌊n2
4 ⌋is an upper bound for pn(G).
Theorem 268 [44] Let the sum be taken over all vertices v of G. Then,
pn(G) ≥Σvmax{0, d+(v) −d−(v)}. If G is acyclic, then equality holds. Simi-
larly, let G be a subgraph of a tournament on n vertices. Then, pn(G) ≥⌊n2
4 ⌋.
If G is transitive, then equality holds.
Kelly’s Conjecture was generalized by Alspach et al. [42], which says that
every tournament T with an even number of vertices is consistent (i. e., it
satisﬁes pn(T) = ex(T)).
Conjecture 43 [42] Every tournament T with an even number of vertices is
consistent.
Conjecture 43 seems likely to hold for many digraphs other than tournaments.
Indeed, it was stated only for even tournaments, probably because it consider-
ably generalized Conjecture 16 which was wide open at that time. The problem
of decomposing digraphs into paths was ﬁrst explored by Alspach and Pullman
[44], who provided sharp bounds for the minimum number of paths needed in
path decompositions of digraphs. Though a digraph satisfying pn(D) = ex(D)
is consistent, not all digraphs are consistent. (e.g., regular digraphs have an
excess of 0). They showed that equality is satisﬁed for acyclic digraphs and
veriﬁed Conjecture 43 for the special case ex(T) = n2
4 .
Theorem 269 [44] For any tournament T, pn(T) ≤n2
4 .
This was generalized to digraphs by O’Brien [394] and showed that the same
bound holds for digraphs on at least 4 vertices. Alspach et al. [42] proposed
another conjecture.

Path Decompositions

Conjecture 44 [42] Any tournament T of even order can be decomposed into
exactly ex(T) paths, where ex(T) = 1

v∈V (T ) |d+
T (v) −d−
T (v)|.
Deﬁnition 61 A graph G is called a symmetric directed graph if G contains
the arc (a, b) exactly when it contains the arc (b, a).
The case of odd n is considerably more diﬃcult. Tillson [475] constructed
the ﬁrst examples of such decompositions. Truszczy´nski [477] also studied
directed decompositions. Here, K∗
n and K∗
m;n represents directed graphs of
Kn and Km;n, respectively.
Theorem 270 [475] There exists a (K∗
n, Pn)-decomposition when n is odd
and n ̸= 3, 5, in which cases the designs do not exist.
Theorem 271 [477] If m ≥n, there exists a (λK∗
m;n, Pk)-decomposition if
and only if 2λmn ≡0(mod k −1), m ≥⌈k
2⌉and n ≥⌈k−1
2 ⌉.
Theorem 272 [262] There exists a (K∗
n, Pn)-decomposition when n is even.
K¨uhn and Osthus [333] proved Conjecture 16 for large tournaments using
their Robust Expander’s Technique, which was subsequently used to prove
several other conjectures on edge decompositions of (directed) graphs. Though
determining whether a digraph is consistent is NP-complete [174], the large
majority of digraphs are consistent [178].
Theorem 273 [333] Every suﬃciently large regular tournament has a Hamil-
ton decomposition.
Theorem 274 [178] Let the random digraph D{n,p} be constructed by taking
n isolated vertices and inserting each of the n(n −1) possible directed edges
independently with probability p. Let log4n
n1/3 ≤p ≤1 −log5/2n
n1/5 . Then, asymptot-
ically, almost surely, D{n,p} is consistent.
In 1968, Kelly proposed a conjecture about a version of Walecki Construc-
tion for regular-directed tournaments. It was proved for large tournaments
by Conlon et al. [167]. Conjecture 43 was resolved by Gir˜ao et al. [231] for
large tournaments in 2023 and proved an asymptotically optimal result for
tournaments of odd order.
Theorem 275 [361] There exist C > 0 and n0 ∈N such that for any n ≥n0
vertices, if T is a tournament on n vertices satisfying either ex(T) ≥n2−1
18
or n ≥n0 even and ex(T) > Cn, then pn(T) = ex(T).
Theorem 276 [231] There exists n0 ∈N such that any tournament T of even
order n ≥n0 satisﬁes pn(T) = ex(T).

Paths of Varying Lengths
Similar to the decomposition of a graph into cycles of varying length, the
decomposition of the given graph into paths of diﬀerent length is discussed
here.
Deﬁnition 62 A graph G is path-perfect if there exists a (G, F)-design, where
E(G) =
n
2

and F = {P2, P3, . . . , Pn}.
In 1977, Liu and Zaks [505] proved that the bipartite graph Kn,n+1 can be
decomposed into paths P2, P4, . . . , P2n, of length (i.e., number of edges in the
path) 2, 4, . . . , 2n, respectively, for all odd n. They proposed it as a conjecture
that this cannot be done for any even integer n. Fink and Straight [210] proved
a result on path-perfect graphs.
Theorem 277 [505] There exists a (Kn,n, {P2, P4, . . . , P2n}) -decomposition
for all n.
Theorem 278 [210] The complete graph Kn, n ≥2, and the complete bipar-
tite graphs Kn,2n−1 and Kn,2n+1; n ≥0 are path-perfect.
Considerable progress on the question of path-perfect complete bipartite
graphs has been made by Truszczy´nski [477]. In Theorem 279, Truszczy´nski
[477] listed some cases when there is a decomposition of λkm,n into paths of
length k, and in Theorem 280 stated some nonexistence results.
Theorem 279 [477] Let m ≥n, and let one of the following conditions hold:
1. m is even, n is odd, and k divides 2n;
2. m is odd, n is even, and k divides n;
3. m is odd, n is even, k < 2n, and k divides m;
4. m = n or m = n + 1, and k divides m;
5. m and n are odd, m ≥3n+1
2
, and k divides n.
Then, λkm,n has a decomposition into paths of length k.
Theorem 280 [477] Let λ be odd, let m ≥n, and let one of the following
conditions hold:
1. m is even, n and k are odd, k > λn;
2. m and k are odd, n is even, k > λm;
3. m, n are odd, and k > λn.
Then, λkm,n does not have a decomposition into paths of length k.

Path Decompositions
93
Two more theorems regarding the decomposition of graphs into paths of vary-
ing length were given by Favaron et al. [206] and Lonc [362]. Chilakamurri [152]
showed that these decompositions also exist for all even n, except n = 2, in
which case the decompositions do not exist.
Theorem 281 [362] If gcd(k, t) = 1, then there exists an integer c = c(k, t)
such that for every graph G satisfying δ(G) ≥c, there is a decomposition of
G into paths, each of length k or t.
Theorem 282 [206] If G is a connected graph and G ≇K3, then there is a
decomposition of G into paths of lengths 2 and 3 if and only if G is not a tree
with all vertices of odd degree.
Theorem 283 [152] There exists a (Kn,n+1, {P3, P5, . . . , P2n+1})-design for
all even n, except n = 2.
Theorem 284 [110] Let Gk be the class of all 2k-regular graphs of girth at
least 2k −2 that admit a pair of disjoint perfect matchings. For every graph
G ∈Gk on n vertices, there exists a decomposition into n
2 paths and cycles
such that paths have lengths in {2k −1, 2k, 2k + 1} and cycles are of length
2k.
6.6
Gallai’s Conjecture
The Gallai’s Conjecture in path decomposition corresponds to the Haj´os’ Con-
jecture in cycle decomposition (see Section 2.4). Erd¨os asked what the minimal
number of disjoint paths with which any connected graph on n vertices can
be covered. For this, Gallai proposed the following conjecture:
Conjecture 45 Gallai’s Conjecture: If G is a connected graph on n vertices,
then G can be decomposed into ⌈n
2 ⌉paths.
Note that, here, the number of paths in Gallai’s Conjecture is also denoted as
π(G) for convenience. Gallai’s Conjecture is sharp. If G is a graph in which
every vertex has an odd degree, then in any path decomposition of G, each
vertex must be the endpoint of some path, and so at least ⌈n
2 ⌉paths are
required. Lov´asz [365] made the ﬁrst signiﬁcant contribution toward a proof
of this conjecture. Theorem 286 is a consequence of Theorem 285.
Theorem 285 [365] A graph on n vertices can be covered by less than or
equal to ⌊n
2 ⌋disjoint paths and cycles. If a graph has u odd vertices and g
even vertices, then it can be covered by u
2 + g −1 disjoint paths. Moreover, if
a locally ﬁnite graph has only odd vertices, then it can be covered by disjoint
ﬁnite paths so that every vertex is the endpoint of just one covering path.

94
Graph Theory and Decomposition
Theorem 286 [365] If G is a graph with n vertices and contains at most one
vertex of even degree, then π(G) = ⌊n
2 ⌋.
Donald [186] cleared up an error in Lov´asz’s proof of Theorem 285 by using an
extension of Lov´asz’s own construction. Favaron and Kouider [205], and Pyber
[410] strengthened Theorem 286. Moreover, Pyber [411] extended Theorem
286. In the case when the number of edges in G is small, there can be a
stronger bound. Yan [502] proved a sharper result. Independently, Dean et al.
[176] also showed that ⌊2n
3 ⌋paths suﬃce.
Theorem 287 [186] Let G be a graph on n vertices. If G has u odd vertices
and g even vertices, then π(G) ≤u
2 + ⌈3g
4 ⌉≤⌈3n
4 ⌉.
Theorem 288 [205] Gallai’s Conjecture is true for graphs where the degree
of every vertex is either 2 or 4.
Deﬁnition 63 [410] The even-subgraph of a graph G is the graph obtained
from G by removing its vertices with odd degrees. That is, an even- subgraph
is the subgraph of G induced by its even degree vertices.
Theorem 289 [410] Let a forest be a graph in which each block is an isolated
vertex or a single edge. Each block of a forest has a maximum degree of at most
1. Then, the graph G can be decomposed into ⌊n
2 ⌋paths if the even-subgraph
of G is a forest.
Theorem 290 [411] Suppose that each cycle of G contains a vertex of odd
degree. Then, G can be covered by less than or equal to ⌊n
2 ⌋edge-disjoint paths.
Moreover, every connected graph G on n vertices can be covered by n
2 +O(n
3
4 )
paths.
Theorem 291 [411] Every connected graph on n vertices with m edges can
be covered by n
2 + 4m
n paths.
Theorem 292 [502] Let G be a graph with n vertices (not necessarily con-
nected), then its path number is π(G) ≤
u
2 + ⌊2g
3 ⌋, where u is the number
of vertices of odd degree and g is the number of nonisolated vertices of even
degree.
Theorem 293 [176] Let G be a graph with n vertices, then its path number
is π(G) ≤u
2 +⌊2g
3 ⌋, where u is the number of odd vertices and g is the number
of nonisolated even vertices.
Dean’s [176] approach is based on partitioning each triple of cycles into at
most four paths. For the class of planar 3-trees, an improvement over the
bound of Dean et al. [176] was given by Kindermann et al. [315].
Theorem 294 [176] Gallai’s Conjecture is equivalent to the statement that
there is a constant c such that every connected graph G satisﬁes π(G) ≤n
2 +c.

Path Decompositions

Theorem 295 [315] Any planar 3-tree admits a path cover of size at most
⌊5n
8 ⌋.
Fan [201] extended Theorem 286. Let H be the subgraph induced by the
vertices of even degree in G. Then, Conjecture 45 is true if H can be obtained
from the empty set by a series of α-operations.
Deﬁnition 64 [201] Let H be a graph. A pair (S, y) consisting of an inde-
pendent set S and a vertex y ∈S is called an α-pair if the following holds: For
every vertex v ∈S \ {y}, if dH(v) ≥2, then (i) dH(u) ≤3 for all u ∈NH(v);
and (ii) dH(u) = 3 for at most two vertices u ∈NH(v).
That is, all the neighbors of v have a degree of at most 3, at most two of which
have a degree of exactly 3.
Deﬁnition 65 [201] An α-operation on H is either (i) add an isolated vertex
or (ii) pick an α-pair (S, y) and add a vertex x joined to each vertex of S, in
which case the ordered triple (x,S,y) is called the α-triple of the α-operation.
An α-graph is a graph that can be obtained from the empty set via a sequence
of α-operations.
Theorem 296 [201] Let G be a graph on n vertices (not necessarily con-
nected). If the even-subgraph of G is an α-graph, then G can be decomposed
into ⌊n
2 ⌋paths. Moreover, if each block of the even-subgraph of G is a triangle-
free graph with a maximum degree of at most 3, then G can be decomposed
into ⌊n
2 ⌋paths.
Geng et al. [228] showed that Gallai’s Conjecture holds for maximal outer
planar graphs.
Theorem 297 [228] If G is a maximal outerplanar graph, then π(G) = ⌈n
2 ⌉.
Since a connected graph with an even number of edges can admit a decompo-
sition into paths of length two, if G is a 2-connected outerplanar graph, then
π(G) ≤⌈n
2 ⌉.
Jim´enez and Wakabayashi [302] veriﬁed it for a family of triangle-free graphs.
Botler et al. [118] veriﬁed Conjecture 45 for a family of even regular graphs
with high girth condition, and they proposed the following conjecture and
proved it.
Conjecture 46 [118] Let G be a connected graph with n vertices. If |E(G)| ≤
(n −1)⌊n
2 ⌋, then π(G) ≤⌊n
2 ⌋. Otherwise, π(G) = ⌈n
2 ⌉.
Botler et al. [118], veriﬁed Gallai’s and Haj´os’ Conjectures for graphs with
treewidth at most 3. Moreover, they showed that the only graphs with
treewidth at most 3 that do not admit a path decomposition of size at most
⌊n
2 ⌋are isomorphic to K3 or K5 −e and veriﬁed Conjecture 45 for graphs with
maximum degree at most 4.

96
Graph Theory and Decomposition
Theorem 298 [118] Let G be a connected partial 3-tree with n vertices. Then,
π(G) ≤⌊n
2 ⌋or G is isomorphic to K3 or to K5 −e. Moreover, let G be a
connected graph with n vertices. If G has maximum degree 4, then π(G) ≤⌊n
2 ⌋
or G is isomorphic to K3, to K5 or to K5 −e.
Botler and Jim´enez [110] proved that Conjecture 45 holds for 2k-regular
graphs of large girth and admits a pair of disjoint perfect matchings (see The-
orem 284). Jim´enez and Wakabayashi [302] showed that Conjecture 45 holds
for a subclass of planar, triangle-free graphs satisfying a distance condition on
the vertices of odd degree.
Theorem 299 [118] Every connected planar graph with a girth of at least 6
is a Gallai graph.
Deﬁnition 66 [302] The odd distance of a graph G, denoted by do(G), is the
minimum distance between any pair of odd vertices of G.
Theorem 300 [302] Let G be a connected triangle-free graph with do(G) ≥
3. Then, every graph G on n vertices with at most 4⌈n
2 ⌉edges has a path
decomposition into at most ⌈n
2 ⌉paths. Moreover, every planar graph G satisﬁes
Gallai’s Conjecture.
Bonamy and Perrett [102] proved that Conjecture 45 holds for the class of
graphs with a maximum degree of at most 5.
Theorem 301 [102] Let G be a connected graph on n vertices. If ∆(G) ≤5,
then G admits a path decomposition into ⌈n
2 ⌉paths.
Deﬁnition 67 [102] A graph G is called a single even triangle graph if even-
subgraph of G is a triangle and every odd vertex of G has at least two even
neighbors. Since a single even triangle graph has three even vertices, it must
have an odd order.
Deﬁnition 68 [102] A graph G is an odd semiclique if it is obtained from a
clique on 2k + 1 vertices by deleting at most k −1 edges.
If |E(G)| > ⌊n
2 ⌋(n −1), then G is known as odd semicliques [102]. For an
odd semiclique, π(G) ≥⌈n
2 ⌉. In this case, n must be an odd integer. An odd
semiclique on 2k+1 vertices does not admit a path decomposition into k paths.
This motivated the following strengthening of Gallai’s Conjecture, which was
considered by Botler et al. [117].
Conjecture 47 Botler-Gallai Conjecture [117]: Let G be a connected graph
on n vertices. If |E(G)| ≤(n−1)⌊n
2 ⌋, then either π(G) ≤⌊n
2 ⌋, or π(G) ≤⌈n
2 ⌉
and G is an odd semiclique.

Path Decompositions
97
Graphs G for which π(G) ≤⌊n
2 ⌋are called Gallai graphs. Note that the only
non-Gallai graphs with an even degree of at most 3 are the odd semicliques.
Botler et al. [117, 118] veriﬁed Conjecture 47 for graphs with treewidth at
most 3 (see Theorem 298).
Botler et al. [108, 111] veriﬁed Conjecture 45 for the graphs given in The-
orem 302.
Theorem 302 [108, 111] Let G be a connected graph on n vertices. Then,
π(G) ≤⌈n
2 ⌉if at least one of the following holds: (i) n ≤11; (ii) n ≤16 and
G is bipartite; or (iii)n ≤14 and G is regular. Moreover, every triangle-free
planar graph is a Gallai graph.
The next deﬁnition is about a special family of graphs, which is used in the
subsequent discussion.
Deﬁnition 69 [117] Let G be the family of graphs for which (i) each block
has a maximum degree of at most 3; and (ii) each component either has a
maximum degree of at most 3 or has at most one block that contains triangles.
Botler et al. [117] generalized Fan’s result [201] by verifying Gallai’s Con-
jecture for graphs whose even-subgraphs are subgraphs of graphs in G. This
allows the components of the even-subgraphs to contain any number of blocks
with triangles as long as they are subgraphs of graphs in G. They explored
an intermediate statement between Gallai’s Conjecture and the Botler-Gallai
Conjecture. Chu et al. [157] conﬁrmed the conjecture on graphs of maximum
degree 6, under the condition that vertices of degree 6 form an independent
set.
Theorem 303 [117] Let G be a connected graph on n vertices. Let a block in
G be a maximal 2-connected subgraph of G, and a leaf block of G be a block
that contains at most one cut-vertex of G. If each block of even-subgraph of
G is triangle-free and has a maximum degree of at most 3, then π(G) ≤⌊n
2 ⌋.
Moreover, if an even-subgraph of G is a subgraph of a graph in G, then π(G) ≤
⌈n
2 ⌉or G is a Gallai graph or G is a single even triangle graph.
Theorem 304 [315] Any series-parallel graph G with n vertices admits a
path cover of size at most ⌈n
2 ⌉. The path cover can be computed in linear time.
Theorem 305 [157] Let Vk(G) = {v|dG(v) = k}. Let G be a graph on n
vertices such that G has no component isomorphic to K3, K5 −e, or K5. If
∆(G) ≤6 and V6(G) is independent, then π(G) ≤n
2 .
For planar graphs, Blanch´e et al. [98] gave a positive response to the question
of whether every connected graph G that is not an odd semiclique admits a
⌊n
2 ⌋-path decomposition.

98
Graph Theory and Decomposition
Theorem 306 [98] Every connected planar graph G on n vertices, except K3
and K5 −e, can be decomposed into ⌊n
2 ⌋paths.
Gallai’s Conjecture holds on 4-regular graphs [205]. Let Gk be the class of all
2k-regular graphs of girth at least 2k −2 that admit a pair of disjoint perfect
matchings. Using Theorem 265, Botler et al. [110] proved a result.
Theorem 307 [110] Let k ≥3 be a positive integer. Then, Gallai’s Conjec-
ture holds in Gk, for every k ≥3. Furthermore, every graph G ∈Gk on n
vertices admits a decomposition into n
2 paths.
For even regular graphs, Sebastian et al. [434] introduced the concept of the
pendant number of graphs and identiﬁed that the maximum number of paths
can be at most the maximum degree of the graph. In 2022, Kottarathil [323]
also showed that for any 2r-regular graph, 2r paths are suﬃcient to cover the
graph (see Chapter 8).

Open Problems
Problem 19 Bonamy and Perrett [102] asked a question: Does every con-
nected graph G that is not an odd semiclique admit a ⌊n
2 ⌋-path decomposi-
tion? Blanche et al. [98] answered this question positively for planar graphs.
The question is open to other graphs.
Problem 20 Many cases of the Conjecture 43 were solved by Lo et al. [361].
In particular, the conjecture has been solved for the two extreme values of
excess, namely, n
2 and n2
4 . For every other value of ex(T) between n
2 and n2
4 ,
the conjecture remains open.
Problem 21 Gallai’s Conjecture is still unsolved and has only been conﬁrmed
on very speciﬁc classes of graphs: graphs of degree 2 or 4 [205], graphs whose
vertices of even degree induce a forest [411], series-parallel graphs [315], graphs
with maximum degree at most 5 [102], planar 3-trees [118], or even regular
graphs [434]. The remaining cases are open.
Problem 22 [53] Characterize graphoidal graphs and digraphs. Moreover,
given a graphoidal digraph F, determine all root digraphs of F.

Star Decompositions
The growth of computer networks has made control and management more
challenging. Network deconstruction is a method for breaking down large net-
works into smaller parts that satisfy speciﬁc requirements, such as typology
and node density. Fault-tolerance is crucial for distributed systems, and Di-
jkstra’s self-stabilization approach was proposed in [180]. Neggazi et al. [392]
developed a distributed Sk decomposition algorithm where each node has only
local knowledge. Star decomposition has applications in scientiﬁc computing,
scheduling, load balancing, parallel computing, and crucial node detection.
This deconstruction is similar to the Master-Slaves paradigm used in grid and
peer-to-peer infrastructures, where the problem is divided into many tasks by
the master (the central vertex) and assigned work to its slaves (the leaf ver-
tices). Star decomposition is commonly used in social networks to identify sig-
niﬁcant personalities and interactions. The decomposition of a complete graph
into a union of edge-disjoint claws or stars yields an optimal ﬁle organization
scheme for balanced ﬁle organization schemes of order two. Existence theorems
and construction procedures for bigraphs with predetermined point degrees
are helpful, similar to the existence of predetermined row and column sum
vectors in 0-1 matrices (see [47, 344]). The decomposition of a complete graph
into edge-disjoint claws or stars yields an optimal ﬁle organization scheme for
balanced order two schemes. This scheme has the least redundancy for every
probability distribution of records with invariance in attribute permutation
[499]. The ﬁrst attempt at decomposing graphs into stars seems to have been
done by Ae, Yamamoto, and Yoshida in a paper titled Line-disjoint decom-
position of complete graph into stars [28]. They determined that a complete
graph of order 3r; r > 1 is 3- star decomposable. Other articles of interest
include [289, 288, 476]. For each positive integer k, the k-star Sk consists of a
single vertex, called central vertex or the center of the star, adjacent to each
of the k further vertices, and no further edges. In this chapter, a star graph
is represented both as Sk and the complete bipartite graph K1,k. That is,
Sk ∼= K1,k.

Sk Decompositions
In 1974, Cain [141] characterized the k-star decomposition of Krk. The ques-
tion of decomposing Kn into k-stars was settled by Yamamoto et al. [500],
and independently by Tarsi [460]. Hogarth characterized the Sk : k = 6, 10
decomposition. Wang et al. [489] found a necessary condition for a complete bi-
partite graph Km,n to be K1,k factorizable and a suﬃcient condition for Km,n
to have a K1,k-factorization whenever k is a prime number. When k = 2,
both the conditions of Theorem 312 coincide with each other. These two con-
ditions provide Ushio’s [484] necessary and suﬃcient condition for Km,n to
have a K1,2-factorization. Note that the only complete bipartite graphs that
are subgraphs of the n-cube graph Qn are the graphs K1,k; 1 ≤k ≤n and
K2,2. Martin [375, 376] showed that subject to certain very natural arithmeti-
cal conditions, balanced bipartite graphs always have star-factorizations. The
above-mentioned results are given below.
Theorem 308 [141] If r ≥2, then Krk can be decomposed into k-stars if and
only if r is even or k is odd.
Theorem 309 [141] Kk+1 is not k-star decomposable. When r > 1, Krk+1
is k-star decomposable if and only if r is even or k is odd.
Theorem 310 [500, 460] Let n, k ∈N. There is a k-star decomposition of
Kn if and only if k divides

and n ≥2k.
Theorem 311 [278] Kn is 6-star decomposable if and only if n is greater than
or equal to 12 and n ≡0, 1, 4, 9(mod 12). Similarly, Kn is 10-star decompos-
able if and only if n is greater than or equal to 20 and n ≡0, 1, 5, 16,(mod
20).
Theorem 312 [489] Let k > 1, m, and n be positive integers. If Km,n has a
K1,k-factorization, then m ≤kn, n ≤km, kn−m ≡km−n ≡0 (mod(k2−1))
and (kn −m)(km −n) ≡0 (mod k(k2 −1)(m + n)). Furthermore, let k be
a prime number. If m ≤kn, n ≤km, kn −m ≡km −n ≡0(mod(k2 −1))
and (kn −m)(km −n) ≡0 (mod k(k −1)(k2 −1)(m + n)), then Km,n has a
K1,k-factorization.
Conjecture 48 Martin’s Conjecture [376]: If the basic arithmetic conditions
are true, then Km,n has a Kp,q-factorization for p, q ∈N.
Theorem 313 [376] Conjecture 48 is true for Kp,q-factorizations of Km,n
whenever p −q is odd and p and q are coprime.
Theorem 314 [375] Let k be an odd positive integer and n = k(k + 1), then
Kn,n has a complete Sk-factorization.

Thomassen [473], Hoﬀman [277], Lim [352], and Zhao [514] gave the following
results:
Theorem 315 [473] Let k be any natural number. If G is a (2k2 + k)-edge-
connected graph whose number of edges is divisible by k, then the edge set of
G can be decomposed into stars with k edges each.
Deﬁnition 70 [277] A partial H-decomposition of G is a partition of the
edges of G into copies of H along with a set of edges L, which is called the
leave. Let B be a partial H-decomposition of G. A partial H-decomposition B′
of another graph G′ is called an embedding of B provided that B ⊆B′ and G
is a subgraph of G′.
Theorem 316 [277] A partial k-star decomposition of Kn can be embedded
into a k-star decomposition of Kn+s where s ≤6k + k∗−4, where k∗= k if
k is odd and 2k if k is even.
Theorem 317 [352] A complete bipartite graph with n vertices on each par-
tite set has an Sk-decomposition if and only if k divides n2 and k ≤n.
Theorem 318 [352] There is an Sk-decomposition for crown graphs (com-
plete bipartite graph Kn,n minus a 1-factor) with n vertices if and only if k
divides n(n −1) and k ≤n −1.
Theorem 319 [352] There exists a construction of an Sk-decomposition for
equipartite tripartite graphs with n vertices in each partite set if and only if k
divides 3n2 and k ≤2n
3 .
Theorem 320 [514] Let G be a graph, and let k ≥3 be an integer. If d(u) +
d(v) ≥4k −3 for any uv ∈E(G), then G admits a star decomposition in
which all stars have size at least k.
Theorem 321 [514] For an integer k ≥3, there exist inﬁnitely many graphs
G with δ(G) = 2k −2 such that G has no star decomposition, in which every
star has size at least k.
Shi et al. [441] studied the Kp,q-factorization of the multipartite graph λKm;n
for p = 1 and showed that the necessary conditions for such a factorization
are always suﬃcient whenever related parameters are suﬃciently large, thus
solving Conjecture 48 for star graphs.
7.2
Claw-Decompositions
The star S3 or K1,3 is also called a claw graph. So, K1,3-decomposition is also
called claw-decomposition (see [297, 298, 367, 473]).

Graph Theory and Decomposition
Theorem 322 A cubic graph has a claw-decomposition if and only if G is
bipartite.
Theorem 323 [367] A (3k −3)-edge-connected graph G admits a K1,k-
decomposition if |E(G)| is divisible by k.
Conjecture 26 holds for stars and, in particular, it conﬁrms Jaeger’s Weak 3-
Flow Conjecture(see Section 5.3 for details). Yamamoto et al. [500] provided
the Claw-Decomposition Theorem for complete graphs and complete bipartite
graphs and a simple construction procedure to determine whether a 0 −1
matrix exists, as well as a diﬀerent way to prove Ryser’s Theorem (see [425]).

m < k; (ii) m ≡0 (mod k) when n < k; and (iii) mn ≡0 (mod k) when
m ≥k and n ≥k.
Theorem 326 [463] Let m ≥2 be an integer. A complete m-partite graph
Kn1,n2,...,nm is said to have a claw-decomposition of degree k if it is a union
of edge-disjoint subgraphs each isomorphic to a claw of degree k.
A claw design (m, n, k, λ) is an edge-disjoint decomposition of λKn;m into
subgraphs each isomorphic to a k-claw. The claw design is said to be balanced
and is denoted by B(m, n, k, λ), if furthermore each vertex of λKn;m belongs to
exactly the same number of k-claws. Tazawa [462] established a necessary and
suﬃcient condition for a complete m-partite graph Kn;m to be decomposed
into a union of edge-disjoint subgraphs, each being isomorphic to a generalized
graph of partite-claw. Ushio [486, 482], Tazawa [463], Thomassen [473], and
Lim [352] proved the following results:

Stars of Varying Lengths
Tarsi showed that an edge decomposition of a complete multigraph into
stars of size m exists whenever some obvious necessary conditions hold [459].
Tarsi [460] also showed that a simple graph of order n admits a decomposi-
tion into stars of sizes m1, . . . , mk provided its minimum degree is at least
n
2 +max{m1, . . . , mk} −1.
Theorem 331 [383, 459] If n(n −1) ≡0 (mod 2m) and n ≥2m, then the
complete graph Kn can be decomposed into edge disjoint k-stars.

Dor and Tarsi [187]. The existence of a polynomial time algorithm to decide
the Sk-decomposability of an input G, where every component of Sk consists
of at most two edges, was proved by Lonc [364]. Lonc [363] gave necessary and
suﬃcient conditions for the existence of an edge decomposition of a complete
graph into stars of sizes m1, . . . , mt. Further, Lonc [363] has given a simple

Hoﬀman [273] gave necessary and suﬃcient conditions for an arbitrary multi-

Deﬁnition 72 Given an Sk-design on G = (V, E), deﬁne its central function

Tarsi et al. [407] studied the decomposition of multigraphs with constant
edge multiplicity into copies of a ﬁxed star Sk. They presented necessary and
suﬃcient conditions for such a decomposition to exist and proved the NP-
completeness of the corresponding decision problem for any k ≥3. They also
proved NP-completeness when the edge multiplicity function is not restricted
to the input G or the ﬁxed multistar Sk. Moreover, they proved two instances
of Conjecture 49, one in the case of Sk being a star and the other in the case
of Sk being a multistar. The multistar Sw1,...,wk is the multigraph with an
underlying graph of k-stars, and the multiplicity of its k edges is w1, . . . , wk
[187]. The Sk-decomposition when Sk is a connected simple graph on at least
three edges is always NP-complete (see Theorem 344).
Deﬁnition 73 [407] S2 −λ decomposition of a graph G is equivalent to a
perfect matching in the λ line graph, L −λ(G), consisting of λ vertices for
each edge of G, where two vertices are adjacent if they stand for adjacent,
distinct edges of G. Thus, the S2 −λ decomposition is solvable in polynomial
time. A single edge is a z-tree and any graph obtained by identifying a leaf of
S2 with a vertex of a z-tree is also a z-tree.
Theorem 343 [407] Sk-decomposition is NP-complete for every star of size
k ≥3 and every multiplicity λ.
Theorem 344 [407] Sα1,α2,...,αn-decomposition is NP-complete, unless n =

Gardner [224].
Theorem 348 [354] Let λ, l, and n be positive integers. Then, λKn,n can be

Furthermore, if α ≤α′, then every instance of (λ, α)-star decomposition is

7.4
Double Star Decompositions
A double star or a bistar is a tree with exactly two vertices of degree greater
than one. The two vertices of degree greater than one are called the centers
of the double star and the edge joining them is called the central-edge. A tree
of diameter less than or equal to 3 is called a double star. If T is a double
star where the two centers have degrees k1 + 1 and k2 + 1, then T is denoted
by Sk1,k2. Note that Sk1,k2 has k1 + k2 + 1 edges and is isomorphic to Sk2,k1.
The double star Sk,k is called symmetric. Every connected graph with an even
number of edges can be divided into pairwise edge-disjoint copies of the bistar
S1,2. Bistars are the only trees with the following property: If T1, T2 are two
intersecting edge-disjoint trees in a bipartite graph, each isomorphic to the
star Sk, and with centers on opposite sides, then T1 ∪T2 = Sk,k+1.

Graph Theory and Decomposition
Theorem 350 [365] Let fi(G) denote the minimal number of disjoint trees
of diameter less than or equal to i covering the graph G on n vertices. Let τ be
the maximal number of independent vertices, and n be the number of vertices
of G such that τ + f2(G) = n. Let f3(G) ≤2n
3 . Then, G can be covered by
≤2n
3 bistars.

Conjecture 53 [295] Let T be a tree of size r. Then, every r-regular bipartite
graph is decomposable into T.
Conjecture 54 [247, 194] Every forest G with n edges decomposes every 2n-
regular graph H.
Conjecture 55 [247, 194] Every forest G with n edges decomposes every n-
regular bipartite graph H.
Jaeger et al. [299] proved Conjecture 50. Jacobson et al. [295] proved that
Conjecture 52 and Conjecture 53 hold for bistars. Conjecture 51 is simple to
verify when T is a star. Thomassen [474] veriﬁed Conjecture 26 for an inﬁnite
family of bistars Sk,k+1.
Theorem 351 [295]
1. There is a wide class of r-regular bipartite graphs that are decomposable
into any tree of size r;
2. Every r-regular bipartite graph decomposes into any bistar of size r;
3. Every 4-regular bipartite graph decomposes into paths P4.
Theorem 352 [474] Let T be a tree on n vertices such that k′
T exists. Then,
kT also exists and kT ≤4k′
T +16(n−1)6n−5. If, in addition, T has a diameter
of at most 3, then kT ≤4k′
T + 16n(n −1).
Theorem 353 [474] Let k ∈N. If G is a 180k4-edge-connected, bipartite
graph with partite classes A1, A2 such that the size of G is divisible by 2k,
then G can be divided into pairwise edge-disjoint copies of the bistar Sk,k+1.

Theorems 352 and 353 can be generalized for all bistars of the form Sk,k+1.
El-Zanati et al. [193] proved Theorem 356 as a response to Conjecture 32.
Akbari et al. [30] presented a short proof for Conjecture 53 in [295], when T
is a double star.
Theorem 354 [474] Let k ∈N. If G is a 784k4-edge-connected graph such
that the size of G is divisible by 2k, then G can be divided into pairwise edge-
disjoint copies of the bistar Sk,k+1.
Theorem 355 [193] Every 2k-regular graph containing a perfect matching is
Sk,k−1-decomposable.
Theorem 356 [193] Every double star with n edges decomposes every 2n-
regular graph.
Theorem 357 [193] For k ≥1, let G be a (2k +1)-regular graph. Then, Sk,k
decomposes G if and only if G contains a perfect matching.
Theorem 358 [30] Let r ≥3 be an integer and G = (A, B) be a bipartite
graph such that for every v ∈V (G), r|d(v). Then every double star of size r
decomposes G.
With regards to perfect matchings, Akbari et al. [30] proved Theorem 359.
Moreover, they [30] generalized Theorem 356.
Theorem 359 [30] Let G be a (2k + 1)-regular graph containing two disjoint
perfect matchings, M1 and M2. If k1 and k2 are two positive integers such
that k1 + k2 = k, then G is {Sk1,k2, Sk1−1,k2}-decomposable.
Theorem 360 [30] Let G be a (2k + 1)-regular graph containing a perfect
matching M and F be a 2-factor in G\M. Suppose that k1 and k2 are two pos-
itive integers such that k1+k2 = k−1. If for every two adjacent vertices u and
v in F, |NG(u) ∩NG(v)| ≤k1 −1, then G is {Sk1,k2, Sk1+1,k2}-decomposable.
Theorem 361 [30] Let k be an integer and G be a graph in which every
vertex has degree 2k + 1 or 2k + 2. Also, suppose that k1 and k2 are two
positive integers such that k1 + k2 = k. If G contains a 2-factor, then G is
{Sk1,k2, Sk1−1,k2}-decomposable.
Zanati et al. [194] provided some evidence in support of Conjecture 54 and
Conjecture 55. In particular, they showed that the conjectures hold when G
is the vertex-disjoint union of two stars.
Theorem 362 [194] Let k1, k2 ∈N and let G = Sk1 ∪Sk2. Let n = k1 + k2,
and suppose that H is a 2n-regular graph. Then, G decomposes H.
Theorem 363 [194] Every star forest G with n edges decomposes Kn,n.
Moreover, let k1, k2 ∈N and let n = k1 + k2 + 1. Suppose that H is an
n-regular bipartite graph, and let I be a 1-factor in H. Then, Sk1,k2 decom-
poses H with the edges of I as the center edges of the double stars in the
decomposition.

Star Decompositions of Digraphs
Deﬁnition 75 [163] An (s, t)-directed star is a directed graph that has s+t+1
vertices, s + t arcs, a vertex of in-degree s and out-degree t called the center,
and no other vertex incident with more than one arc. An (s, t)-directed star
decomposition of a directed graph D is a partition of the arcs of D into (s, t)-
directed stars.
An (s, t)-directed star decomposition is balanced if the number of stars cen-
tered at any two vertices diﬀers by at most one. If the directed graph D is a
multigraph with each edge repeated λ times, it is denoted as λD. Landau’s
Theorem helps form conditions for a sequence of integers to be the score se-
quence for some tournament.

E(A) = {(x, z) ∈E : x, z ∈A} and δ(A) =

suﬃcient condition for the existence of an orientation of G for which the out
degree of every vertex x ∈V is δ(x) is: δ(V ) = |E| and δ(A) ≥|E(A)| for
every A ⊆V .
Theorem 367 [162] Let D be a symmetric directed (simple) graph that is
regular of degree r. Let s, t ≥0 be integers for which r ≡0 (mod s + t). Then,
1. If s + t ̸= r, there is an (s, t)-directed star decomposition of an n-vertex
directed multigraph D;
2. If s + t = r, there is an (s, t)-directed star decomposition of an n-vertex
directed multigraph D if and only if the underlying undirected graph of D
has an s-factor.
Theorem 368 [162] Let λ, s, t and n be integers satisfying λ, s, t ≥1 and n ≥

Star Decompositions
111
An (s, t)-directed star decomposition of a directed multigraph is a partition of
the arcs into directed stars, each having s arcs into the center and t arcs out
of the center. The (s, t)-directed star decomposition of an n-vertex directed
multigraph D = λDKn for λ = 1 is completely settled in [163].
Theorem 369 [163] Let n ≥2 and s, t ≥1. Then, an (s, t)-directed star
decomposition of an n-vertex-directed multigraph D exists if and only if the
following all conditions hold:
1. (s + t)|n(n −1);
2. s + t ≤n −1;
3. ⌈n−1
s+t ⌉≤min{⌊n−1
s ⌋, ⌊n−1
t ⌋};
4. If s and t are odd, then s + t ̸= n −1 and n−1

/∈{s, t}.
Moreover, a balanced (s, t)-directed star decomposition of an n-vertex directed
multigraph D exists if and only if an (s, t)-directed star decomposition of an
n-vertex directed multigraph D exists.
Thomassen [473] proved that a graph of large (but ﬁxed) edge-connectivity has
an orientation of the edges such that each vertex has a prescribed out-degree
modulo k, provided the obvious necessary condition holds.
Theorem 370 [473] Let k be any natural number. If G is a (2k2 + k)-edge-
connected graph and, for each vertex x, p(x) is a natural number such that the
size (number of edges) of G is congruent to the sum of all p(x) modulo k,
then the edges of G can be oriented such that the out-degree of each vertex x
is congruent to p(x) modulo k. For k = 3 the edge-connectivity of 8 suﬃces.
The case k = 3 proves a weakening of Tutte’s 3-ﬂow conjecture called the
Weak 3-Flow Conjecture proposed by Jaeger [298]. For general k, Theorem 370
proves the analogous weakening of the Circular Flow Conjecture proposed by
Jaeger in [297] (see Conjecture 25). As an immediate consequence of Theorem
370, the conjecture by Bar´at and Thomassen [65] (see Section 5.3) holds for
each star.

Spectrum and Intersection Problems
Billington et al. [95] solved the intersection problem for stars. They determined
those triples (m, n, k) of integers for which there are two m-star designs on
the same n-set having exactly k stars in common. Yu [503] completely settled
the problem of Sk-factorizations of Kn and obtained necessary and suﬃcient
conditions for the existence of a K1,k−1-factorization of Kn, which previously

had only been known to be asymptotically suﬃcient. When the graph G itself
is a complete graph Kk, then the decomposition Kk[λ, n] is known as a BIBD:
B[k, λ; n] [254]. The case λ = 1 is completely solved by Huang [286].
Theorem 371 [459] The necessary and suﬃcient condition for the existence
of a decomposition Sk[λ, n] is that (i) λn(n −1) ≡0(mod 2k); (ii) n ≥2k for
λ = 1; (iii) n ≥k + 1 for even λ; and (iv) n ≥k + 1 + k
λ for odd λ ≥3.
The spectrum problem was solved by Huang [286] and Tarsi [459] indepen-
dently.
Theorem 372 [286, 459] For m, n positive integers, there is an m-star de-

Obviously, IG(n) ⊆JG(n). Here, IG(n) and JG(n) are abbreviated to Im(n)
and Jm(n), respectively, if G is the m-star.

k = 1; (ii) m ≥2, n = 2m + 1, k = 2m −1.
7.7
Star Number of Graphs
The star number of graphs came as an oﬀshoot of the pendant number of
graphs. The star number counts the minimum number of vertices, which are
the leaf vertices of at least one star. In other words, one can identify the
number of vertices that always stand as the central vertices of every star
graph by subtracting the star number from the total number of vertices. The
concept of star number of graphs was introduced in 2018 by Sebastian et al.
[435] and is deﬁned as:

Star Decompositions
113
Deﬁnition 76 [435] The star number of a graph G, denoted by Πs(G), is
the minimum number of vertices in a graph such that they are the pendant
vertices of a star in a given star decomposition of a graph G. Let Vs(G) be
the set of all pendant vertices of a star in a star decomposition of G. Then,
Πs(G) = min{| Vs(G) |: G has a star decomposition}.
If a vertex is already counted as an end vertex in a star decomposition, it
remains as an end vertex even if it becomes the root vertex of any other
stars in the same star decomposition. For example, for the given caterpillar,
Πs(G) = 13 (see Figure 7.1). The white vertices in the given ﬁgures imply
that they are pendant vertices of at least one star.
FIGURE 7.1
Identifying star number of a caterpillar [435].
Theorem 376 [435] Let V (G) be the vertex set of a graph G, then Πs(G) =
|V (G)| if and only if G = K2.
The bounds of the star number of graphs are described in [435] as:
1. Let G be a graph on n vertices, then 2 ≤Πs(G) ≤n −1.
2. Let p be the number of pendant vertices, then p ≤Πs(G) ≤n −1.

Open Problems
Problem 23 Determine results in tune with [142] for the problem of decom-
posing a complete λ-fold multigraph into cliques of speciﬁed orders.
Problem 24 Star decompositions of stars in general, and in particular bis-
tars and claws, were discussed here. There are other classes of stars, and the
decomposition of the given graph into such stars can be examined.
Problem 25 [435] The star number of graphs is typically determined by de-
termining the minimum number of end vertices in the star decomposition of a
speciﬁc graph. This can be transformed to determine the star number of graphs
Πs(G) for a ﬁxed k or with stars of varying lengths.
Problem 26 [435] Compare the star number of graphs with other graph pa-
rameters such as pendant number, domination number, independence number,
chromatic number, diameter, and so on.
Problem 27 [435] The star decomposition is an NP-complete problem, and
identifying the star number can provide clarity about the nature of such graphs,
as it is identiﬁed for the pendant number.

Pendant Number of Graphs
In networking and transportation problems, there are instances of ﬁnding
the minimum number of intermediary stopover points. For example, while
providing eﬃciency in covering the maximum number of stations in the metro
railway system, connecting the airports, constructing toll booths, boosting
the network ﬂow, etc., one may need to minimize the number of starting
points and destinations. Situations of this kind necessitate that we ﬁnd the
minimum number of possible starting and ending points of certain paths in
graphs. Here, the concept of the pendant number of graphs plays a vital role.
In 2018, Sebastian et al. [434] introduced the concept of pendant number
of graphs. While denoting the vertices of graphs in the ﬁgures drawn, the
convention of whitening the vertices, which are the end vertices of paths in
the desired path decomposition of a graph, is followed.
Gallai proposed a conjecture (Conjecture 45) that a connected graph G
with n vertices can be decomposed into ⌈n
2 ⌉paths. Though the pendant num-
ber has a diﬀerent goal, it provides some insight on the optimal number of
pathways for a path decomposition. For example, there are several graph
classes with pendant number 2. This is conceivable if the graph’s two ver-
tices serve as the beginning and ending points for each path in the path
decomposition. Hence, the number of paths must be less than or equal to the
degree of these vertices. Let ∆(G) be the maximum degree of the graph G. If
the pendant number is 2, then the number of paths in the path decomposi-
tion must be less than or equal to ∆(G). Thus, another part of the solution
to Gallai’s Conjecture is identiﬁed. If cycles are allowed, then this sum may
reduce to ∆(G)
2
. This may give a solution to Haj´os’ Conjecture (Conjecture
10) for even regular graphs. Marcin [495] identiﬁed a linear time algorithm to
ﬁnd pendant number. See [434, 437, 435, 436, 323, 438, 412, 321, 320, 433] for
further reading on pendant number of graphs.

Pendant Number
Deﬁnition 77 [434] The pendant number of a graph G, denoted by Πp(G),

of a path in a given path decomposition of the graph G.

Graph Theory and Decomposition
If Vp(G) denotes the set of all u ∈V (G) such that u is an end vertex of any
path in a path decomposition in G, then Πp(G) = min{|Vp(G)|}. Invoking a
part of Theorem 223, the sharp bounds for the pendant number Πp(G) are
obtained in the following theorem.
Theorem 379 [434] Let G be a connected graph with n vertices. If G has l
odd degree vertices, then l ≤Πp(G) ≤n.
Since any path involves exactly two pendant vertices, it can easily be seen
that:
Corollary 1 [434] If G is a connected graph with n ≥2 vertices, then 2 ≤
Πp(G) ≤n.
The following results are immediate from the fact that every pendant vertex
of a tree is an end vertex of some path in T.
Theorem 380 [434] Let T be a tree on n vertices and has p pendant vertices,
then p ≤Πp(G) ≤n.
Theorem 381 [434] Let T be a tree on n ≥2 vertices, then Πp(T) = 2 if
and only if T is a path Pn.
Theorem 382 [436] In a complete binary tree, the only vertex that cannot
be an end vertex in the path decomposition is the root vertex.
Theorem 383 [434] Let T be a tree with n vertices. Then, Πp(T) = n −k if
T has k even vertices. Moreover, the pendant number of any tree must be an
even number.
Next, the pendant number of cyclic graphs is discussed.
Theorem 384 [434] If G is the cycle Cn on n ≥3 vertices, then Πp(G) = 2.
Theorem 385 [434] For a unicyclic graph G of order n, let n ≥3 be with l
odd degree vertices and m vertices on the cyclic part with deg(v) > 2. Then,
Πp(G) =

Deﬁnition 78 A Halin graph (also known as rooﬂess polyhedra), introduced
by Halin [251], is a planar graph obtained from a tree T in which all vertices
except the pendant vertices have degree at least 3 by joining all its pendant
edges to form a cycle.
Theorem 386 [436] Let G be a Halin graph whose underlying graph is a tree
T on n ≥4 vertices. Then, Πp(G) = Πp(T).

Pendant Number of Graphs

Deﬁnition 79 A regular graph G with edge-set E(G), is said to have a Hamil-
ton decomposition [38] (or be Hamilton decomposable) if either
1. deg(G) = 2d and E(G) can be partitioned into d Hamilton cycles;
2. deg(G) = 2d + 1 and E(G) can be partitioned into d Hamilton cycles and
a perfect matching.
In order to distinguish the two cases mentioned above, the following convention
is used: call the decomposition that satisﬁes condition 1 as Hamilton decompo-
sition of ﬁrst kind and the decomposition that satisﬁes condition 2 as Hamilton
decomposition of second kind.
Theorem 387 [434] For a connected graph G of order n, 2 ≤Πp(G) ≤n.
The lower bound is attained if G has Hamilton decomposition of the ﬁrst kind,
and the upper bound is attained if G has Hamilton decomposition of the second
kind.
Since an even regular graph has a Hamiltonian decomposition of ﬁrst kind
and an odd regular graph has a Hamiltonian decomposition of second kind,
the above results can be rewritten as:
Theorem 388 [323] For an r-regular graph G of order n,
Πp(G) =

Properties of Pendant Number
Even though there is no direct relation between the pendant number and other
known and popular graph parameters, it is observed that the pendant number
is highly inﬂuenced by the number of odd-degree vertices in a graph. Moreover,
the pendant number of a graph G has plenty of interesting properties, some
of which are dealt with in the following discussion.
Theorem 392 [437] If u, v are two non-adjacent vertices in a graph G of
order n, then |Πp(G + uv) −Πp(G)| ≤2.
Deﬁnition 80 The one-point union of a collection of graphs G (possibly with
diﬀerent order) is obtained by replacing some or all edges of a path P by some
graphs G ∈G in the collection. The one-point union of cycles is obtained by
replacing the edges of a graph G by cycles (possibly of diﬀerent order).
The following results discuss the pendant number of the one-point union of
cycles.
Theorem 393 [437]
1. If G is the one-point union of cycles, then Πp(G) = 2.
2. Let G be a graph that is neither a cycle nor a one-point union of cycles.
Then, the one-point union of G and a cycle Cn has the pendant number
Πp(G) + 1.
3. If G is a graph with cycles such that v is an end vertex of a path and G∗
is the one-point union of G and a path Pm joined at v, then Πp(G) ≤
Πp(G∗) ≤Πp(G) + 1.
Theorem 394 [437] If B1, B2, . . . , Bk are k distinct blocks of a graph G, then
Πp(G) ≤

i=1
Πp(Bi).
Theorem 395 [437] If a graph G, with n ≥3 vertices, has k even degree
vertices, then n −k ≤Πp(G) ≤n −1.
Deﬁnition 81 An m −ary tree is a tree whose all internal vertices have
exactly m children. A vertex is said to be at height i, if its distance from the
root vertex is i. An m-ary tree is said to be a complete m-ary tree if all its
pendant vertices are at the same height.
The following result discusses the pendant number of a complete m−ary tree.

Hn. If these pendant vertices are joined again to the central vertex, the new
graph is called a Flower graph An[153]. If the corresponding vertices of two
cycles Cn of order n are joined and all these vertices are made adjacent to
an external vertex, such a graph is known to be a Djembe graph DJn[456].
(Deﬁnitely, the Flower graph An and the Djembe graph DJn are Eulerian
graphs.)
Theorem 400 [436] The pendant number of the given Eulerian graphs,
namely the Flower graph and the Djembe graph, is ⌈∆
4 ⌉.

Graphs
Deﬁnition 89 [322] Let G and H be two graphs such that Πp(G) = Πp(H),
then G and H are called equipendant graphs. The pendant number of equipen-
dant graphs is called equipendancy.
For example, Pn and Cn are equipendant graphs with equipendancy 2.

Graph Theory and Decomposition
The next theorem discusses extremal pendant graphs and their relation to
Eulerian graphs. Note that G + K1 represents the join of the graphs G and
K1.
Deﬁnition 91 [322] A graph G on n vertices is called an extremal pendant
graph (in short,EP-graph) if the graph G+K1 satisﬁes any one of the following:
1. Πp(G) = 2 and Πp(G + K1) = n + 1; or
2. Πp(G) = n and Πp(G + K1) = 2.
In other words, let G be a graph satisfying either of the bounds 2 or n. If
the pendant number of G attains the other extreme by adding a new vertex
and joining it to all the existing vertices, then G is called an EP-graph. The
smallest EP-graph with Πp(G) = 2 is K3, and with Πp(G) = n is K1,3.
Theorem 417 [322] If G is an EP-graph with Πp(G) = 2, then n must be
an odd number. Similarly, if G is an EP-graph on n vertices with Πp(G) = n,
then n must be an even number.

an EP-graph, then
Πp(G + K2) =

2

∆(G) = n −1, then G is an EP-graph.
Theorem 422 [322] Let G be an EP-graph. Then, Πp(G) = n if and only if
G + K1 is an Eulerian graph.

is an Eulerian graph.

ucts, such as the rooted product (see Deﬁnition 23), the corona product (see
Deﬁnition 22), the Cartesian product, and the direct product of paths and
cycles.

2. For Cn ◦Pm, Πp(Cn ◦Pm) = 2n.
3. For Cn ◦Cm, Πp(Cn ◦Cm) = n.

Corona Products
Theorem 434 [436]
1. The corona product of the graphs P1 ⊙P1 = K2, P1 ⊙P2 = C3, and
P2 ⊙P1 = P4 has the pendant number 2.
2. Since the corona product P1 ⊙Pm; m ≥3 is the n−fan graph on n + 2
vertices, the pendant number is:
Πp(P1 ⊙Pm) =

m −1
if m is odd;
m −2
if m is even.
3. The corona product Pn ⊙P1; n ≥3 is the comb graph T. Thus, its pendant
number is 2(n −1).
Deﬁnition 92 [436] The n−lever graph is the graph Ln obtained by taking
the one-point union of n ≥2 copies of C3 and n −1 copies of K2. The lever
graph Ln is the same as the corona product Pn ⊙P2; n ≥2.

8.5.3
Cartesian Products
Deﬁnition 94 The Cartesian product of two graphs G and H, denoted as
G□H, is as given below:
1. V (G□H) = {(u, v)|u ∈V (G) and v ∈V (H)},
2. E(G□H) = {(u, v)(u′, v′)|u = u′, vv′ ∈E(H) or uu′ ∈E(G), v = v′}.
The graphs G and H are called factors of the product G□H.
The Cartesian product of any two graphs is commutative [252]. The Cartesian
products P2□Pn, Pm□Pn; m, n > 2, Pm□Cn, and Cm□Cn are respectively
known as ladder graphs, grid graphs, prism graphs and torus graphs.
Theorem 440 [438] For n ≥3, Πp(P2□Pn) = 2(n −2).

Direct Products
Deﬁnition 95 [252] The direct product of two graphs G and H, denoted as
G × H, is deﬁned as follows: The vertex set of G × H is V (G) × V (H) for
which vertices (g, h) and (g′, h′) are adjacent precisely if gg′ ∈E(G) and
hh′ ∈E(H). Thus,
V (G × H) = {(g, h)|g ∈V (G) and h ∈V (H)},
E(G × H) = {(g, h)(g′, h′)|gg′ ∈E(G) and hh′ ∈E(H)}.
The direct product is synonymously known as tensor product, Kronecker prod-
uct, cardinal product, relational product,conjunction, weak direct product, or
categorical product. The Weichsel’s Theorem on the product graphs is as fol-
lows:
Theorem 450 Weichsel’s Theorem [492]: Let G and H be two connected and
nontrivial graphs. If at least one of G or H contains an odd cycle, then G×H
is connected. If both G and H are bipartite, then G × H contains exactly two
components.
Since the direct products of paths, stars, and even cycles, a path and an even
cycle, a path and a star, a star and an even cycle are all bipartite and thereby
disconnected, the pendant number of such products can not be determined
[438].

8.6
Path-Induced Signed Graphs
A graph G(V, E) together with a function σ : E(G) →{+, −} is called a signed
graph if σ assigns either of the signs + or −to each edge in G. A signed graph is
denoted by S(G, σ) and the function σ is called the signature or sign function
of S, which is deﬁned on all edges. It is positive on free loops. An edge e of
the signed graph S is called a positive edge if σ(e) = + and a negative edge
if σ(e) = −. The sets E+ and E−represent the sets of all positive edges and
negative edges in S, respectively. A signed graph S is said to be balanced if the
product of signs of edges in each cycle is positive. In a balanced signed graph,
every cycle consists of an even number of negative edges. Thus, the concept
of balance is applicable only to the cycles, if present, in the given graph G.
If every edge of a signed graph is positive, then it is called an all-positive
signed graph, and if every edge of a signed graph is negative, then it is called
an all-negative signed graph. A signed graph is homogeneous if it is either
all-positive or all-negative. The signed graph S is clusterable, if the vertex set
V (S) can be partitioned in such a way that the vertices connecting positive
edges lie in the same partition and the vertices connecting negative edges lie
in a distinct partition. It is said to be k-clusterable, if V (S) can be partitioned
into k sets. For the terminology of signed graphs, refer to [506, 507].
8.6.1
Path-Induced Signed Graphs
The concept of an induced signed graph ﬁrst appeared in [19] and studied in
detail in [57, 387]. The generalized terminology of an induced signed graph
has been introduced in [48] as follows:
Deﬁnition 96 An induced signed graph, SG of a graph G is obtained from
G by inducing a sign function σ on G using the rule σ(uv) = (−1)|φ(u)−φ(v)|,
where φ(v) is deﬁned as a speciﬁed parameter of v ∈V (G).
Deﬁnition 97 [321] A path-induced signed graph of a graph G is the signed
graph Sp(G) = (G, σ), where the signing function σ is given by
σ(uv) =

+1,
if u, v ∈Vp(G);
−1,
otherwise.

Pendant Number of Graphs
129
If the context is clear, instead of Sp(G), one can write Sp. For a graph G
with pendant number 2, there is at most one edge connecting the two end
vertices of paths. Thus, Sp contains at most one positive edge for a graph
with Πp(G) = 2.
8.6.2
Balance in Path-Induced Signed Graphs
There might be more possibilities when choosing terminal vertices in some
graph types, even though they all oﬀer the same number of terminal vertices.
For instance, any pair of vertices in a cycle can be selected as the terminal
vertices in a path-decomposition (with two terminal vertices in each case).
Some of these options might give a balanced, signed graph, while others might
not. Using non-adjacent vertices as terminal vertices in the even cycle Cn
results in a negative homogeneous signed graph, which is balanced. However,
if n is odd and the terminal vertices are not adjacent, the number of negative
edges also changes to be odd, which throws oﬀthe balance of the signed graph.
In such a situation, choose any two adjacent vertices as the terminal vertices
so that the corresponding path-induced signed graph becomes balanced.
Theorem 454 [321] The path-induced signed graph of a graph G of order n
with pendant number Πp(G) ≥n −1 is balanced.
Theorem 455 [321] Let G be a graph and H be a subgraph of G by deleting
the vertices of degree 2 iteratively. Then, Πp(G) = Πp(H).
Theorem 456 [321] Let H denote a graph obtained by subdividing an edge,
say uv, of the underlying graph of the balanced signed graph Sp(G). Then, the
path-induced signed graph of H, Sp(H), is balanced if and only if both u and
v are terminal vertices of G.
8.6.3
Pseudo-balancing of Path-Induced Signed Graphs
If a signed graph S is balanced, then the product of the signs of all cycles in S
is always positive. But the converse need not be true. If S has an even number
of negative cycles, the product of the signs of all cycles is positive, but S is
not balanced. In view of this fact, a new concept called pseudo-balance of a
signed graph is introduced in [321] as follows:
Deﬁnition 98 [320] A path-induced signed graph Sp of a graph G is said to
be pseudo-balanced if the product of signs of all cycles in Sp is positive.
The pseudo-balance in the path-induced signed graphs of various graph classes
can be studied extensively. The following theorem investigates the pseudo-
balance in the path-induced signed graphs of complete graphs.
Theorem 457 [320] A path-induced signed graph Sp on a complete graph Kn
is pseudo-balanced except for n ≡1 (mod 4).

130
Graph Theory and Decomposition
For other regular graphs, the following result is given:
Theorem 458 [320] If G is an even regular graph of order n and size m,
then Sp is pseudo-balanced.
8.6.4
Clusterability in Path-Induced Signed Graphs
Theorem 459 [321] Let G be a graph on n vertices. Then, the pendant num-
ber Πp(G) = n if and only if Sp is balanced and non-clusterable.
Theorem 460 [321] A path-induced signed graph Sp of a graph G on n ver-
tices is n-clusterable if and only if {u, v} ∈Vp(G) such that uv /∈E(G) ∀u, v ∈
Vp(G), where Vp(G) denotes the set of vertices which are the end vertices of
paths in the desired path decomposition of G.
Theorem 461 [321] A graph G on n vertices is all-positive or positive ho-
mogeneous if and only if its pendant number is n, and all-negative or negative
homogeneous if and only if it is n-clusterable.
Theorem 462 [321] A graph G on n vertices is all-negative or negative ho-
mogeneous if and only if {u, v} ∈Vp(G) such that uv /∈E(G).
Theorem 463 [321] Let Kn be a complete graph with n vertices. Then, the
path-induced signed graph of Kn, Sp(Kn) is balanced if and only if either n=3
or n = 2k; k ∈N.
For a path-induced signed graph, the edges are signed positive if the incident
vertices are in Vp(G). Thus,
Theorem 464 [321] An edge is positive if and only if the incident vertices
are positive.

Marcin’s Algorithm
Marcin and Kottarathil [495] showed a linear time algorithm that ﬁnds the
pendant number of a graph for graphs in which every cycle contains a vertex
with an odd degree. Assume that the given graph G is labeled (i.e., every
vertex has a unique id).
Algorithm 1 [495]
1. Add the number of vertices of odd degree in the graph G to the solution.
2. Find connected components of vertices of even degree in G. Denote them
as T i
e. For every component T i
e do:

(i)
For every vertex v of degree one in T i
e, we construct a set of labels
Sv by assigning (if it was empty) or adding the list of labels of
neighbors of odd degree in G.
(ii)
For every vertex v of degree one in T i
e, ﬁnd a label that occurs
more than |Sv|
2
times. If there is no such label (more than one has
the same frequency), choose the label of the vertex v. Propagate
the chosen label to a neighbor of v in the tree T i
e, and mark its
incidence edge as “used”.
3. Continue step 2 for all vertices for which the number of not-used edges in
T i
e equals 1. If at any point the list of vertices that we want to propagate
has a single label appearing more than half time in the list, add 1 to the
solution.

gle vertex with a maximum degree ∆(G) = n −1. Then, the Flower graphs

generalized tree of G is obtained by joining a copy of H to one of the H′s of
the existing G. Find the pendant number of generalized trees.
Problem 36 [433] Is there any relation between the pendant number of a
graph G and the number of paths obtained?
Problem 37 [433] Graphs consisting of Hamiltonian decomposition of the
ﬁrst kind are equipped with pendant number 2. Many of the Eulerian graphs are
also endowed with the pendant number. Is there any relation between Hamil-
tonian graphs and Eulerian graphs with equipendancy?
Problem 38 Marcin’s Algorithm [495] showed a linear time algorithm that
ﬁnds the pendant number of a graph for graphs in which every cycle contains
a vertex with an odd degree. Finding an algorithm for general graphs remains
open.

Multiple Decompositions of Graphs
In the previous parts of the book, the decompositions of various graphs into
either cyclic graphs or acyclic graphs were discussed. It is natural to consider
the problem of decomposing a graph into copies of distinct subgraphs. There
are decompositions that deal with more than one kind of subgraph of a graph.
Such decompositions are known as multidecompositions. Here, the multide-
compositions of graphs into paths and cycles, paths and stars, and stars and
paths are examined. There is another kind of decomposition, where a complete
graph is decomposed into a graph and its complement. Moreover, a graph can
be decomposed into copies of three subgraphs. The spectrum problems of cer-
tain types of graphs are also discussed here. This part of our discussion is a
birds-eye view of the emergence of these deompositions.
A multidesign refers to a multidecomposition, a maximum multipacking,
or a minimum multicovering. Maximum multipackings and minimum multi-
coverings are identiﬁed when Kn does not admit a multidecomposition. In a
graph packing problem, there is a host graph G and a guest graph F that pack
as many edge-disjoint copies of F into G as possible. If the size (number of
edges) of F divides that of G, it may be possible to ﬁnd a perfect packing, or
F-decomposition of G. A maximum multipacking is a partitioning of a subset
of E(Kn) into copies of G and H, using at least one copy of each Gi where
the number of edges outside the partition, called the leave, is minimum. A
minimum multicovering is a collection of copies of both Gi that use all edges
of Kn at least once and where the number of edges used more than once,
called the padding, is minimum. This book does not go into the details of
multipacking and multicovering, as they are out of our focus. Instead, a short
survey of various types of multidecompositions alone is made.
The graph multidecomposition problem is a variation of G-decomposition
or G-design. Let G, H and F be multigraphs. A decomposition of G is a set
of edge-disjoint subgraphs of G whose union is G. An H-decomposition of
G is a decomposition of G into copies of H. If G has an H-decomposition,
then G is H-decomposable and write H|G. An {H, F}-decomposition of G
is a decomposition of G into copies of H and F using at least one copy of
each. If G has an {H, F}-decomposition, then G is {H, F}-decomposable and
write {H, F}|G. If G1, . . . , Gk are graphs, not necessarily disjoint, then G1 ∪

Graph Theory and Decomposition
graph is the partition of the edge set of a given graph into various pre-assigned
copies of its subgraphs. Here, in this chapter, there is a slight change in the
usual notation. Pk+1 represents a path containing k edges (i.e., length k) and
k+1 vertices; Sk+1 represents a star containing k edges and k+1 vertices (i.e.,
Sk+1 ∼= K1,k ); Ck represents a cycle containing k edges and k vertices. λKn
denotes the multigraph obtained by replacing each edge in the complete graph
on n vertices, Kn, with λ repeated edges. λKm,n is also deﬁned analogously.
There are three obvious necessary conditions for the existence of a G-
decomposition or a G-design.
Theorem 465 [318] If a G-design of order n exists, then (i) n = 1 or n ≥
|V (G)|; (ii) n(n −1) ≡0 (mod 2|E(G)|); and (iii) n −1 ≡0 (mod d), where
d is the greatest common divisor of the degrees of all vertices in G.
9.1
Decomposing Graphs into Pairs
The study of {G, H}-decomposition was introduced in 2003 by Abueida and
Daven [12]. They [13] investigated the problem of {Kk, Sk}-decomposition of
the complete graph Kn. A graph-pair {G, H} of order n is a pair of non-
isomorphic graphs G and H on n non-isolated vertices such that G ∪H is
isomorphic to Kn. Abueida et al. [15] completely determined the values of n
for which λKn admits a {G, H}-decomposition, where {G, H} is a graph-pair
of order 4 or 5. Abueida et al. [11] and Abueida and Hampson [16] considered
the existence of decompositions of Kn −F for the graph-pairs of order 4
and 5, respectively, where F is a Hamiltonian cycle, a 1-factor, or a graph
that is 1-regular except for one vertex of degree 0. Abueida and O’Neil [18]
proposed Conjecture 56 on multidecomposition of multigraphs. Priyadharsini
[408] proved a part of the Conjecture 56.
Conjecture 56 [18] For any integer n ≥m ≥3, there is a (G, H)- multide-
composition of λKn, where (G, H) = (K1,m−1, Cm).
Theorem 466 [13] There exists a {Kk, Sk}-decomposition of Kn for all k ≥
3 and n ≡0, 1 (mod k).
9.1.1
{Pl, Sk} Decompositions
Here, the decompositions of graphs into copies of paths Pl and stars Sk; l, k ∈
N are discussed. Results on complete graphs Kn given by Shyu [443, 445, 447]
are noteworthy.
Theorem 467 [447] Let p and q be positive integers, and let n be a positive
odd integer. There is a decomposition of Kn into p copies of Pk+1 and q copies

of Kn into p copies of Pk+1 and q copies of Sk+1.
Lee and Chen [341] made the following characterization:
Theorem 471 [341] Let n be a positive integer with n ≥4, and let p and
q be non-negative integers. The complete graph Kn can be decomposed into

The next results by Shyu et al. [445], and Lee and Chen [342] dealt with the
complete bipartite graph Km,n.
Theorem 472 [445] Let m > k and n ≥3k. Then, there exists a decom-
position of Km,n into p copies of Pk+1 and q copies of Sk+1 if and only if
k(p + q) = mn.
Theorem 473 [445] Let n ≥m. There exists a decomposition of Km,n into
p copies of P4 and q copies of S4 if and only if (i) 3(p + q) = mn; (ii)
p ≥1 =⇒m ≥2; and (iii) (m = 3 ∨(m = 2 ∧n ≡0(mod 3))) =⇒p ̸= 1.
Theorem 474 [342] Kn,n has a {Pk+1, Sk+1}-multidecomposition if and only
if k ≤n and n2 ≡0 (mod k).
9.1.2
{Cl, Sk} Decompositions
Here, the decompositions of graphs into cycles Cl and stars Sk are discussed,
where l, k ∈N. Theorems 475 and 476 by Shyu [446] gave the necessary
conditions for the decomposition of a complete graph Kn:
Theorem 475 [446] Let n, l, k ∈N be such that n ≥max{l, k + 1}. If Kn
can be decomposed into p copies of Cl and q copies of Sk+1 for nonnegative

Theorem 476 [446] Let n, l, and k be positive integers such that n is even,

The following theorems by Shyu [446] and Abueida et al. [17] gave suﬃcient
conditions for the decomposition of a complete graph Kn:
Theorem 477 [446] Let n be a positive odd integer and let k be a positive

Theorem 478 [17] For integers l, n with 4 ≤l < n and l even, if n ≡0, 1

Theorem 479 [17] For all n ≥4l such that l| n(n−1)

, if l is even or n is odd,
then Kn is {Cl, Sl}-decomposable.
Beggas et al. [67] improved the results of Abueida and Lian (Theorems 478
and 479) and extended them to the complete multigraph λKn as follows:
Theorem 480 [67] Let n, l, and λ be positive integers. If λ n(n−1)
2
≡0 (mod l)
and n ≥4l, or n ≥2l and λ > 1 is even or greatest common divisor (λ, l) = 1,
then λKn is {Cl, Sl+1}-decomposable.
Theorem 481 [67] Let n, l, and λ > 1 be positive integers. Then, λKn is
{Cl, Sl+1}- decomposable if λ n(n−1)
2
≡0 (mod l) and l is prime, or l divides
n −1, n, or λ.
The characterization of {C3, S4} decomposition of a complete graph Kn given
by Fu et al. [217] is as follows:
Theorem 482 [217] For any nonnegative integers p and q and any positive
integer n, Kn can be decomposed into p copies of C3 and q copies of S4 if

If there is a 1-factor and if m = n, the characterization is given by Lin and
Lee [356] as:
Theorem 483 [356] Let k and n be positive integers, and let I be a 1-factor of
Kn,n. The graph Kn,n−I is {Pk+1, Sk+1}-decomposable if and only if k ≤n−1
and n(n −1) ≡0 (mod k).

Next theorems by Ilayaraja and Muthusamy [291] and Shyu [446] characterized
{C4, S5} decomposition of a complete bipartite graph Km,n and a complete

copies of C4 and q copies of S5 if and only if one of the following holds:
1. q is even, when m = 2 and even n ≥2;

then the graph Kn can be decomposed into p copies of Pk+1 and q copies of
Ck.
Theorem 491 [444] Let p and q be nonnegative integers, and let n and k be
positive integers such that n is odd, k ≥4 is even, and n ≥5k + 1. There
exists a decomposition of Kn into p copies of Pk+1 and q copies of Ck if and
only if k(p + q) = e(Kn) and p ̸= 1.
Theorem 492 [444] Let p and q be nonnegative integers, and let n be a pos-

Theorem 493 [301] The complete bipartite multigraph λKm,n can be decom-
posed into p copies of Pk+1 and q copies of Ck when λ ≡0 (mod 2), m, n ≥k
2,
m + n > k, and k(p + q) = 2mn for k ≡0 (mod 2), and also when λ ≥3,
λm ≡λn ≡0 (mod 2), k(p + q) = λmn, m, n ≥k, (resp., m, n ≥3k
2 ) for
k ≡0 (mod 4) (resp., for k ≡2 (mod 4)). In fact, these necessary conditions
are also suﬃcient when λ = 2.
Theorem 494 [300] If p, q be nonnegative integers and let k, m, n be positive
even integers such that k ≡0 (mod 4) and m ≤n, then the graph Km,n can

2;
n ≥⌈k+1
2 ⌉; k(p + q) = mn and p ̸= 1.
9.1.4
Complementing Pair (G, G) Decompositions
Another natural way to form a pair of graphs is to use a graph and its com-
plement. Let G and H be edge-disjoint, nonisomorphic, spanning subgraphs
of Kn each with no isolated vertices. Then, the graph pair (G, H) of order n
is a multidesign of Kn if H = G with E(G)∪E(H) = E(Kn) (see Figure 9.1).
Deﬁnition 99 A (G, G)-multidesign of Kn is the multidecomposition of the
complete graph Kn into copies of the graph G and its complement G.
This kind of multidesign is ﬁrst deﬁned by Abueida and Daven [12] as:
Deﬁnition 100 Let G and H be non-isomorphic and spanning subgraphs of
Kn with δ ≥1. If E(G) ∪E(H) = E(Kn), then (G, H) is said to be a graph
pair of order n.

The ﬁve graph pairs (Gi, Hi) of order 5 [12].
The only graph pair in a multidesign of order 4 is (C4, 2K2). Furthermore,
there are exactly 5 graph pairs of order 5 (see Figure 9.1). Necessary and
suﬃcient conditions for multidecompositions of complete graphs into all graph
pairs of orders 4 and 5 were characterized by Abueida and Daven [12]. They
also characterized the cardinalities of leaves and paddings of multipackings
and multicoverings for the same graph pairs. In 2020, Gao and Roberts [223]
discussed the graph pair of a 6-cycle, denoted C6, and the complement of a
6-cycle, denoted C6 (i.e., the graph pair (C6, C6). Note that C6 is sometimes
referred to as the 3-prism.
Theorem 495 [12] There is a (C4, 2K2)-multidecomposition of Kn if and
only if n ≡0, 1 (mod 4) (n ≥4, n ̸= 5).
Theorem 496 [12] There is a (Gi, Hi)-multidecomposition of Kn for n ≥5
if and only if (i) i ∈{1, 3, 4}, n ≡0, 1 (mod 4) (except when i = 1 and n = 8);
(ii) i = 2, n ≡0, 1 (mod 5); and (iii) i = 5, n ̸= 6, 7.
Theorem 497 [12] There is a (G, H)-multidecomposition of Kn if (i) G ∪
H ∼= K4 and n ≡1, 4 (mod 12); and (ii) G ∪H ∼= K5 and n ≡1, 5 (mod 20).
Theorem 498 [223] The complete graph Kn admits a (C6, C6)- multidecom-
position of Kn if and only if n ≡0, 1(mod 3) with n ≥6, except n ∈{7, 9, 10}.
(C4 ∪P2, C4 ∪P2) is another multidesign of the complete graph K6. Kot-
tarathil [319] discussed the concepts of complementing multidesign, subdesign,
and uniform k-multidesign of complete graphs and introduced these proper-
ties besides the multidesign of the graph pair (C4 ∪P2, C4 ∪P2). Phung et
al. [400] determined the condition for n such that there exists (C7, C7)-multi-
decomposition of Kn.

Decompositions of Graphs into Triples
In this section, T-decomposition refers to Triple Decomposition, which is the
decomposition of a graph into three subgraphs.
Deﬁnition 101 [14] A graph-triple T = (G, H, F) of order m is deﬁned to
be a triple of non-isomorphic graphs G, H and F without isolated vertices that
factor Km (i.e., G ∪H ∪F = Km). Let n ≥m, then T divides Kn, if E(Kn)
can be partitioned into copies of the graphs in T with each one is used at least
once. Such a partition is called a T-multidecomposition.
In a similar way, T-multipackings, T-multicoverings, and T-multidesigns are
deﬁned by Abueida et al. [14]. Since there are no graph-triples of order m ≤5,
the study begins with graph-triples of order 6. There are 131 such graph-
triples, which are exhibited in Appendix B of [14]. They chose 37 of these
graph-triples and determined multidesigns for all Km with m ≥6. Cusack
et al. [170] determined multidesigns of Km, m ≥6, for the remaining graph-
triples of order 6.
9.2.1
{Pp, Sq, Cr} Decompositions
The simultaneous decomposition of a graph into paths, cycles, and stars is
a recently originated decomposition method. In 2016, Lin and Jou [355] ﬁrst
investigated the problems of the {Ck, Pk, Sk} -decomposition of the balanced
complete bipartite graph Kn,n. Shyu [447] also contributed in this regard,
where the path, cycle, and star are of four edges each. Zhao and Wu [514]
proved the non-existence of a triple as:
Theorem 499 [514] For any positive integer k, there always exists a graph
G, whose size is divisible by 3, with δ(G) ≥k and without a {S3, P4, C3}-
decomposition.
Theorem 500 [355] Let k and n be positive integers, and λ ≥2. The graph
λKn,n has a {Ck, Pk+1, Sk+1}-decomposition if and only if k is even, 4 ≤k ≤
n and λn2 ≡0 (mod k).
Theorem 501 [447] Let G be an even graph, and let k, p, q, and r be positive
integers with k ≥3. If G can be decomposed into p copies of Pk+1, q copies of
Sk+1, and r copies of Ck, then |V (G)| ≥k + 1; k(p + q + r) = m and p ≥⌈k
2⌉
when q = 1, where m is the number of edges of G.
Theorem 502 [447] Let m, n, p, q, and r be positive integers such that both m
and n are even and m ≤n. Then, Km,n can be decomposed into p copies of P5,
q copies of S5, and r copies of C4, if and only if m+n ≥6; 4(p+q+r) = mn;
(p, q) ̸= (1, 1); q is even when m = 2; (p, q, r) ̸= (1, 2, 1) when m = n = 4.

9.3
Spectrum of Decompositions of Small Graphs
A central problem in the ﬁeld of constructive combinatorics consists of ﬁnding
necessary and suﬃcient conditions on λ and n for which a G-decomposition
of λKn exists for a ﬁxed graph G. This is called the spectrum of G. Bunge et
al. [137] characterized the spectrum of the multigraph by doubling the edges
of a path of length 3 in the paw graph (a triangle with a pendant edge). The
spectra for all connected cubic multigraphs of order at most 6 were found
by Carter [145]. The spectra for various multigraphs on four vertices and six
edges are characterized by Bunge et al. [138]. Adams et al. [24] summarized
the state of knowledge on the spectrum problem for Kk with k ≤9 till 2008.
The design spectrum problem has been completely solved for the following
small-order graphs [215]:
1. The spectrum problem for K2 is trivial;
2. Being a Steiner Triple System, K3-design is solved through Kirkman’s
Problem;
3. The spectrum problem for K4 and K5 was solved by Hanani [253];
4. The spectrum of graphs with at most ﬁve vertices and all graphs with six
vertices and at most eight edges are solved [24, 214, 318];
5. All graphs with six vertices and nine edges; [23, 24, 136, 243, 308, 384, 212];
6. All graphs with six vertices and ten edges are also solved [27, 253, 215, 318,
213];
7. Substantial progress has been made on the spectrum problem for K6 [380,
6, 1, 4, 2, 240, 5, 3].
9.4
Open Problems
Problem 39 The spectrum problem for all graphs with six vertices and up to
ten edges is identiﬁed. The remaining cases are open.

Graph Theory and Decomposition
Problem 40 The decompositions of graphs into pairs are mostly on paths,
stars, and cycles. Other pairs of graphs, as well as complementing pairs, are
a wide open area for research.
