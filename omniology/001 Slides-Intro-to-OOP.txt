Object Oriented Programming (OOP
●
Object-oriented programming or OOP is another programming paradigm and is based on 
classes, objects, attributes and methods;
●
Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. It supports different programming 
approaches including the procedural and the OOP;
●
Object-oriented programming is an approach for modeling concrete, real-world things as well 
as relations between them; It allows programmers to create their own real-world data types;
●
A class is a kind of data type defined by the programmer. When we create an object of that 
data type, we call it an instance of a class. A class is a factory for creating objects.
●
In Python, everything is an object
>>> x = 5
>>> l = [1, 4, 6]
>>> type(x)
<class 'int'>
>>> type(l)
<class 'list'>  
 
●
The data values which we store inside an object are called attributes, and the functions which 
are associated with the object are called methods.
