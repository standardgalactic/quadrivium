Introduction
W
hat is Adobe InDesign and what can it do for you? InDesign is a power-
ful publishing application that lets you work the way you want to
work. You can use InDesign as a free-form but manual approach to layout, or
as a structured but easily revised approach. The fact that you can choose
which way to work is important for both novice and experienced users,
because there isn’t a single, correct way to lay out pages. Sometimes (for
example, if your project is a single-instance publication), creating a layout
from scratch — almost as if you were doing it by hand on paper — is the best
approach. And sometimes using a highly formatted template that you can
modify as needed is the way to go, because there’s no need to reinvent the
wheel for documents that have a structured and repeatable format.
InDesign can handle sophisticated tasks, such as magazine and newspaper
page layout, but its simple approach to publishing also makes it a good
choice for smaller projects, such as one-off ads and flyers. InDesign is also a
good choice for corporate publishing tasks, such as proposals and annual
reports. Plug-in software from other vendors adds extra capabilities.
But that’s not all. InDesign was designed from the ground up as an electronic
publishing tool. That means that you can easily send documents to service
bureaus and printing presses for direct output, which saves you lots of time
and money. It also means that you can create documents for electronic distri-
bution, particularly using the Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF). These
electronic files can include interactive features, such as fill-in-the-blank forms.
Once you get the hang of it, InDesign is quite easy to use. At the same time,
it’s a powerful publishing program with a growing following among the ranks
of professional publishers — and the latest InDesign CS2 version is certain 
to accelerate that trend. Part of its success is due to the fact that its inter-
face is not unlike that of its sister applications, Adobe Illustrator and Adobe
Photoshop, which are also components of the Adobe Creative Suite.
If you are just getting started with InDesign, welcome! We hope you’ll find the
information in these pages to be helpful in getting you started.

How to Use This Book
Although this book has information that any level of publisher needs to know
to use InDesign, this book is primarily for those of you who are fairly new to
the field, or who are just becoming familiar with the program. We try to take
the mystery out of InDesign and give you some guidance on how to create a
bunch of different types of documents. Here are some conventions used in
this book:
 Menu commands are listed like this: Window➪Pages.
If we describe a situation in which you need to select one menu and then
choose a command from a secondary menu or list box, we use, for exam-
ple: press Shift+Ô+P or Ctrl+Shift+P. Note that the Macintosh sequence
comes first, followed by the Window equivalent.
 Key combinations: If you’re supposed to press several keys together, we
indicate that by placing plus signs (+) between them. Thus Shift+Ô+A
means press and hold the Shift and Ô keys, and then press A. After
you’ve pressed the A key, let go of the other keys. (The last key in the
sequence does not need to be held down.) We also use the plus sign to
join keys to mouse movements. For example, Alt+drag means to hold the
Alt key when dragging the mouse.
 Pointer: The small graphic icon that moves on the screen as you move
your mouse is a pointer (also called a cursor). The pointer takes on dif-
ferent shapes depending on the tool you select, the current location of
the mouse, and the function you are performing.
 Click: This means to quickly press and release the mouse button once.
On most Mac mice, there is only one button, but on some there are two
or more. All PC mice have at least two buttons. If you have a multi-button
mouse, click the leftmost button when we say to click the mouse.
 Double-click: This tells you to quickly press and release the mouse
button twice. On some multi-button mice, one of the buttons can func-
tion as a double-click. (You click it once, the mouse clicks twice.) If your
mouse has this feature, use it; it saves strain on your hand.
 Right-click: A Windows feature, this means to click the right-hand mouse
button. On a Mac’s one-button mouse, hold the Control key when click-
ing the mouse button to do the equivalent of right-clicking in programs
that support it. On multi-button Mac mice, assign one of the buttons to
the Control+click combination.
 Dragging: Dragging is used for moving and sizing items in an InDesign
document. To drag an item, position the mouse pointer on the item,
press and hold down the mouse button, and then slide the mouse across
a flat surface.

How This Book Is Organized
We’ve divided this book into seven parts, not counting this introduction. Note
that the book covers InDesign on both Macintosh and Windows. Because the
application is almost identical on both platforms, we only point out platform-
specific information when we need to, or when we remember to, or both.
We have also included some bonus content on the InDesignCentral Web site
(www.InDesignCentral.com).
Part I: Starting at the Beginning
Designing a document is a combination of science and art. The science is in
setting up the structure of the page: How many places will hold text, and how
many will hold graphics? How wide will the margins be? Where will the page
numbers appear? And so on. The art is in coming up with creative ways of fill-
ing the structure to please your eyes and the eyes of the people who will be
looking at your document.
In this part, we tell you how to navigate your way around InDesign using the
program’s menus, dialog boxes, palettes, and panes. We give you a test drive
of the application so you can see how it works. We also show you how to set
up the basic structure of a document and then how to begin filling the struc-
ture with words and pictures. We also tell you how to bring in text and graph-
ics created in separate word processing and graphics applications.
Part II: Document Essentials
Good publishing technique is about more than just getting the words down
on paper. It’s also about opening, saving, adding, deleting, numbering, and
setting layout guidelines for documents. This part shows you how to do all
that and a lot more, including tips on setting up master pages that you can
use over and over again.
Part III: Object Essentials
This part of the book shows you how to work with objects: the lines, text
frames, picture frames, libraries, and other odds and ends that make up a
publication.

Introduction

Part IV: Text Essentials
When you think about it, text is a big deal when it comes to publishing docu-
ments. After all, how many people would want to read a book with nothing
but pictures? In this part, we show you how to create and manipulate text, in
more ways than you can even imagine.
Part V: Graphics Essentials
Very few people would want to read a book with nothing but text, so this part
is where we show you how to handle graphics in InDesign. We include some
nifty special effects that can add visual pizzazz to your work.
Part VI: Printing and Output Essentials
Whether you’re printing a publication or simply creating a PDF file for readers
to download from a Web site, you still need to understand the basics of out-
putting an InDesign document. This part is where we show you how to set up
your files, manage color, and work with service bureaus.
Part VII: The Part of Tens
This part of the book is like the chips in the chocolate chip cookies; you
could eat the cookies without them, but you’d be missing a really good part.
It’s a part that shows you some important resources that will help you make
the most of InDesign. It also gives some pointers on switching to InDesign
from QuarkXPress and Adobe PageMaker.
Icons Used in This Book
So that you can pick out parts that you really need to pay attention to (or,
depending on your taste, to avoid), we’ve used some symbols, or icons, in
this book.
When you see this icon, it means we are pointing out a feature that’s new to
InDesign CS 2.
If you see this icon, it means that we’re mentioning some really nifty point or
idea that you may want to keep in mind as you use the program.
4
InDesign CS2 For Dummies 

This icon lets you know something you’ll want to keep in mind. If you forget it
later, that’s fine, but if you remember it, it will make your InDesign life a little
easier.
If you skip all the other icons, pay attention to this one. Why? Because ignor-
ing it could cause something really, really bad or embarrassing to happen,
like when you were sitting in your second-grade classroom waiting for the
teacher to call on you to answer a question, and you noticed that you still
had your pajama shirt on. We don’t want that to happen to you!
This icon tells you that we are about to pontificate on some remote technical
bit of information that might help explain a feature in InDesign. The technical
info will definitely make you sound impressive if you memorize it and recite it
to your friends.

You have your copy of InDesign and you’d like some
basic information on how to get started, right? Well,
you have come to the right place. Read along with us and,
before you know it, you’ll be sailing smoothly through
InDesign. This part of the book gives you a general idea of
what InDesign can do. We explain the layout approaches
you can take, and how to set up InDesign to work the way
you work.  Plus, we take you on a test drive, where you
can see the steps involved in creating your first document
in InDesign. Along the way, we help you navigate the
plethora of panes, palettes, tools, and shortcuts that can
seem overwhelming at first, but which soon become
second nature as you gain experience using the program.
Welcome aboard!

Chapter 1
Finding Out How InDesign Works
In This Chapter
 Understanding what InDesign can do for you
 Finding out how InDesign works
 Defining InDesign terms
P
age layout programs have been around for the past couple of decades,
so you’d think that software in this category is mature and past its inno-
vative prime. But that’s not true: Adobe InDesign has revitalized the category
with a raft of powerful, unique capabilities. Yet Adobe InDesign, the new kid
on the block, actually has a history that goes back way before its appearance
on the scene. InDesign is the modern-day successor to PageMaker. PageMaker
was an early — and popular — page layout program created by a no-longer-
existing company by the name of Aldus, which was acquired by Adobe in
1994. To its credit, InDesign is also taking over market share from a market-
leading competing product: QuarkXPress.
Why mention this history? Because if you’re reading this, there’s a good chance
that you are already using a page layout program — perhaps QuarkXPress or
PageMaker. If so, you’ll find some features of InDesign to be familiar, others to
be fairly easy to assimilate, and still others to be just about as confusing as
can be. If you are new to page layout programs and are taking your first steps
with InDesign, that’s fine, too. You can get up and going with the program
after a very short time.
If you’re well-versed in how to use previous versions of InDesign, you already
know the basics. Feel free to skip this chapter and move right ahead. If not,
settle in for a nice conversation about how to get started using a very com-
prehensive page layout program.
Lots of Capabilities
Before InDesign, layout designers chose from two predominant software pro-
grams. PageMaker offered an unstructured approach to layout in which the
designer had lots of flexibility but needed to manually position text and

graphics on the print (or, later, online) page. A slightly later addition to the
desktop publishing scene, QuarkXPress, offered structural elements to help
construct the page while still making it easy to revise layouts. InDesign,
which tries — successfully, for the most part — to be more things to more
people, lets you choose from both approaches. This flexibility means that
you can create a layout from scratch, or you can use a formatted template
that helps you position text and graphics into a predetermined spot in the
layout, with prearranged look-and-feel specifications. And if you want to devi-
ate from the formatted template, InDesign lets you do that as well.
What kinds of layouts can InDesign handle? Pages for magazines, newspa-
pers, marketing brochures, and ads to start with. InDesign is also an excellent
choice for more structured documents, such as corporate reports, newslet-
ters, white papers, and annual reports. The program’s intuitive approach to
publishing also makes it a good choice for smaller projects, such as newslet-
ters and informational flyers. After you get the hang of it, you’ll find InDesign
simple to use. But don’t forget that it is full-featured enough to handle the
most complex page-layout tasks, everything from a magazine ad to an annual
report. Figures 1-1 through 1-3 show a few examples of InDesign’s range.
Finding Out What InDesign Can Do
Seeing as how InDesign is a leading, if not the leading, page layout program, it
makes sense that it is a whiz at helping you lay out pages quickly and easily.
InDesign offers a strong set of features for professional publishers working on
brochures, magazines, advertisements, and similar publications. Although it
lacks specialized tools for database publishing (such as for catalogs), it offers
many unique features, such as a multiline composer, glyph scaling, and cus-
tomer character strokes, some of which we talk about later in the chapter.
InDesign’s use of both the free-form and structured layout metaphors — which
we also explain later in the chapter — makes it very flexible, letting you pick
the layout style that works best for you and for your document’s specific needs.
Among InDesign’s most useful and innovative capabilities are the following:
 Styles let you perform complex formatting quickly and easily. Use nested
styles to handle tricky text formatting, such as a drop cap with its own
character style nested inside a paragraph with its own style, or to make
sure all sidebar frames have the same background.
 InDesign’s support for sophisticated OpenType fonts (in addition to
more standard PostScript and TrueType fonts) and its ability to high-
light missing fonts in a document let you handle font issues easily.
10
Part I: Starting at the Beginning 

 The multiline composer adjusts the spacing and hyphenation over several
lines of text at once — rather than the typical one-line-in-isolation of
other programs — to achieve the best possible spacing and hyphenation.

Chapter 1: Finding Out How InDesign Works

 Custom strokes for characters let you change the look of characters by
making their outlines (strokes) thicker or thinner. You can also give the
part of the characters inside the stroke a different color to create an out-
line effect. (Normally, the part inside the stroke is the same color as the
stroke, so the reader sees a normal, solid character.)
 Illustrator and Photoshop file import lets you place these graphics files
directly into your layout.

Part I: Starting at the Beginning 

 Multiple views of the document let you see different sections at the
same time.
 Transparency can make objects fade for ghost-like visuals or to create
special effects as the objects overlap.
 InDesign offers automated spell checking and text correction similar to
Microsoft Word’s noninvasive correction tools.
 Object styles let you apply a range of attributes (such as fill and stroke)
to an object and reuse those same settings on other objects.
 Follow-me anchored objects let you keep items such as figures and side-
bars with text as it flows throughout a document.
Discovering the InDesign Approach
Publishing programs have some similarities and some differences in their 
various approaches to the publishing task. One way to describe a program’s
approach to publishing is to talk about its metaphor, or the overall way that it
handles publishing tasks.
Some programs use a free-form metaphor, which means that the method used
to craft a document is based on assembling page elements as you would if
they were placed on a pasteboard until ready for use. This is also called the
pasteboard metaphor, which is an imprecise term because software that uses
other metaphors can still include a pasteboard. PageMaker is the best-known
example of the free-form approach.
Other programs approach page layout by using a frame-based metaphor, in
which frames (or boxes) hold both the page elements and the attributes that
control the appearance of those elements. QuarkXPress is the best-known
example of the frame-based approach.
InDesign is the best of both worlds because it incorporates both the free-
form and the frame-based metaphors. 
Figure 1-3:

Chapter 1: Finding Out How InDesign Works

The frame-based metaphor
When you work with a frame-based metaphor, you build pages by assembling
a variety of frames that will contain your text and graphics. First, you set up
the basic framework of the document — the page size and orientation, mar-
gins, number of columns, and so on. You then fill that framework with text,
pictures, and lines.
These frames and lines need not be straight or square. With InDesign, you
can create frames that are shaped by Bézier curves. (In the 1970s, French
engineer Pierre Bézier created the mathematics that make these adjustable
curves work.)
Why would you want to use frames? Publishers find several reasons why
frames come in handy:
 To create a template for documents, such as newsletters and maga-
zines, that use the same basic layout elements across many articles.
You create the frames and then add the text and graphics appropriate
for each specific article, modifying, adding, and deleting frames as nec-
essary for each article.
 To get a sense of how you want your elements to be placed and sized
before you start working with the actual elements. This is similar to
sketching a rough layout on paper with a pen or pencil before doing a
formal layout with InDesign.
 To set up specific size and placement of elements up front. You often
work with a template or with guidelines that limit the size and placement
of elements. In many cases, you can copy an existing frame because its
size is the same as what you use in several locations of your layout. For
structured or partly structured documents, such as newsletters and
magazines, we find it easier to set up documents up front so that ele-
ments are sized and placed correctly; the less favorable alternative is
resizing elements one at a time later on.
Whether you start by creating frames to hold graphics or text or you simply
place the text and graphics directly on your page, you’re using frames. When
you directly place elements on the page, InDesign creates a frame automati-
cally for each element. The frame InDesign creates is based on the amount of
text or the size of the graphic, rather than on your specific frame specifica-
tions. Of course, in either case, you can modify the frames and the elements
within them.
The free-form metaphor
Working under a free-form (pasteboard) metaphor, you draw a page’s content
as if you’re working on paper. If you’ve been in the publishing business for a
14
Part I: Starting at the Beginning 

while, you might once have used wax to stick strips of type, camera-ready
line drawings, and halftone pictures to a pasteboard. You would then assem-
ble and reassemble all those pieces until you got the combination that looked
right to you. The free-form metaphor encourages a try-as-you-go, experimen-
tal layout approach, which is particularly well suited to one-of-a-kind docu-
ments such as ads, brochures, annual reports, and marketing materials.
If you use a frame-based approach to page layout, you can experiment with
using the frames as placeholders for actual text and graphics. Visual thinkers
like to work with actual objects, which is why the free-form metaphor works
much better for them. With InDesign, you pick the metaphor that works for
your style, your current situation, and your mood. After all, both approaches
can lead to the same great design.
Understanding Global and Local Control
The power of desktop publishing in general, and InDesign in particular, is that
it lets you automate time-consuming layout and typesetting tasks while, at
the same time, letting you customize each step of the process according to
your needs.
This duality of structure and flexibility — implemented via the dual use of the
frame-based and free-form layout metaphors — carries over to all operations,
from typography to color. You can use global controls to establish general
settings for layout elements, and then use local controls to modify those ele-
ments to meet specific publishing requirements. The key to using global and
local tools effectively is to know when each is appropriate.
Global tools include:
 General preferences and application preferences (see Chapter 4)
 Master pages and libraries (see Chapter 8)
 Character and paragraph styles (see Chapters 16 and 17)
 Object styles (see Chapter 13)
 Sections and page numbers (see Chapter 6)
 Color definitions (see Chapter 10)
 Hyphenation and justification (see Chapter 17)
Styles and master pages are the two main global settings that you can expect
to override locally throughout a document. You shouldn’t be surprised to
make such changes often because, although the layout and typographic func-
tions that styles and master pages automate are the fundamental components
of any document’s look, they don’t always work for a publication’s entire spe-
cific content.
15
Chapter 1: Finding Out How InDesign Works

Local tools include:
 Frame tools (see Part III, as well as Chapters 18 and 20)
 Character and paragraph tools (see Chapters 16 and 17)
 Graphics tools (see Part V)
Choosing the right tools for the job
Depending on what you’re trying to do with InDesign at any given moment,
you may or may not know right away which tool to use. If, for example, you
maintain fairly precise layout standards throughout a document, then using
master pages is the way to keep your work in order. Using styles is the best
solution if you want to apply standard character and paragraph formatting
throughout a document. When you work with one-of-a-kind documents, such
as the poster shown in Figure 1-1, it doesn’t make much sense to spend time
designing master pages and styles — it’s easier just to format elements as
you create them.
For example, you can create drop caps (large initial letters set into a para-
graph of type, like the drop cap that starts each chapter in this book) as a
paragraph option in the Paragraph pane, or you can create a paragraph style
(formatting that you can apply repeatedly to whole paragraphs, ensuring that
the same formatting is applied each time) that contains the drop-cap settings,
and then apply that style to the paragraph containing the drop cap. Which
method you choose depends on the complexity of your document and how
often you need to perform the action. The more often you find yourself taking
a set of steps, the more often you should use a global tool (like character and
paragraph styles) to accomplish the task.
Fortunately, you don’t need to choose between global and local tools while
you’re in the middle of designing a document. You can always create styles
from existing formatting later. You can also add elements to a master page if
you start to notice that you need them to appear on every page.
Specifying measurement values
Another situation in which you can choose between local or global controls
is specifying measurement values. Regardless of the default measurement unit
you set (that is, the measurement unit that appears in all dialog boxes, panes,
and palettes), you can use any unit when entering measurements in an
InDesign dialog box. For example, if the default measurement is picas, but
you’re new to publishing and are more comfortable with working in inches,
go ahead and enter measurements in inches.
16
Part I: Starting at the Beginning 

InDesign accepts any of the following codes for measurement units. Note that
the x in the items listed below indicates where you specify the value, such 
as 2i for 2 inches. It doesn’t matter whether you put a space between the
value and the code: Typing 2inch and 2 inch are the same as far as InDesign
is concerned:
 xi or x inch or x" (for inches)
 xp (for picas)
 xpt or 0px (for points)
 xc (for ciceros)
 xcm (for centimeters)
 xmm (for millimeters)
You can enter fractional picas in two ways: in decimal format (as in 8.5p) and
in picas and points (as in 8p6). Either of these settings results in a measure-
ment of 81⁄2 picas (there are 12 points in a pica).
Basic InDesign Vocabulary
Not too long ago, only a few publishing professionals knew — or cared about —
what the words pica, kerning, crop, and color model meant. Today, these words
are becoming commonplace because almost everyone who wants to produce
a nice-looking report, a simple newsletter, or a magazine encounters these
terms in the menus and manuals of their layout programs. Occasionally, the
terms are used incorrectly or are replaced with general terms to make non-
professional users feel less threatened, but that substitution ends up confus-
ing professional printers, people who work in service bureaus, and Internet
service providers. Throughout this book, we define other publishing terms 
as we go.
Like all great human endeavors, InDesign comes with its own terminology,
much of it adopted from other Adobe products. Some general terms to know
include the following:
 Frame: The container for an object. A frame can hold text, a graphic, 
or a color fill.
 Link: The connection to a file that you import, or place (defined below),
into an InDesign document. The link contains the file’s location, and its
last modification date and time. A link can reference any image or text
file that you have imported into a layout. InDesign can notify you when a
source text or graphics file has changed so you can choose whether to
update the version in your layout.
17
Chapter 1: Finding Out How InDesign Works

 Package: The collection of all files needed to deliver a layout for printing
or Web posting.
 PDF: The Adobe Portable Document Format, which has become the
standard for sharing electronic documents. No matter what kind of 
computer it is viewed on (Windows, Macintosh, Palm, or Unix), a PDF
document displays the original document’s typography, graphics repre-
sentation, and layout. With InDesign, you can place PDF files as if they
were graphics, and you can also export its InDesign pages to PDF format.
 Place: To import a picture or text file.
 Plug-in: A piece of software that loads into, and becomes part of,
InDesign to add capabilities to the program.
 Stroke: The outline of an object (whether a graphic, line, or individual
text characters) or frame.
 Thread: The connections between text frames that let a story flow from
one frame to another.

f InDesign were an automobile, it would be more like a Formula 1 racecar
than an economy sedan. InDesign is a complex program that lets you do
everything from creating ads to designing brochures and magazines to index-
ing a book to generating separation plates for professional printing. Yet, for
all its inherent complexity, InDesign is also designed to get novice publishers
up and running quickly. In fact, you can get started building documents with
just a few simple skills.
In this chapter, we walk you through the process of creating a simple docu-
ment. Don’t worry if it all doesn’t make sense — the goal is to give you a
basic taste of InDesign’s approach and interface, so when we get into the
details in the rest of this book, you can relate them to a real publication and
to the bigger picture.
If you’ve used other page layout programs, you can skip this chapter and
move on to the chapters in the book that explore the full functionality of the
program. But if you’re just getting started, you’ve come to the right place.
To give you an idea of how to use InDesign’s basic tools, we will guide you
through the creation of a fictitious newsletter for an equally fictitious desert
park in Arizona. To follow these steps on your computer, you need InDesign,

a text file from a word-processing program, a graphics file, and a printer. You
can follow the steps closely — either using the components we provide (avail-
able at www.InDesignCentral.com) or substituting your own text, graphic,
and fonts — or you can make variations along the way. In any case, fasten
your seat belts. It’s sure to be an interesting ride.
Creating a New Document
When you create a new document in InDesign, you specify the size and setup
of the pages in the document. Note that in this chapter, measurements are in
picas (a pica is a typesetting measurement equal to one-sixth of an inch and
is a standard measure in the layout world) with the equivalent measurement
given in inches. Follow these steps to create a new document:
1. Open InDesign.
2. Choose File➪New➪Document, or press Ô+N or Ctrl+N.
The New Document dialog box appears (see Figure 2-1).
3. In the Page Size drop-down menu, choose Letter.
4. Select the Facing Pages option because this is a newsletter printed on
two sides, thus needing both left-hand and right-hand pages.
Figure 2-1:

5. Select Master Text Frame.
6. Set the number of columns to 2, with a gutter width of 1p6 (0.25
inches).
7. Set the margin guides to 4p6 (0.75 inches) for the top and inside, 3p6
(0.583 inches) for the bottom, and 3p (0.5 inches) for the outside.
8. Click the Save Preset button and give these specifications a name.

specifications lets you select these exact settings for future documents.
For example, to create future issues of the Park News newsletter, 
you choose the Park News preset name from the Document Preset 
pop-up menu.
9. Click OK to create the new document’s layout.
InDesign creates one 81⁄2-by-11-inch page.
10. Choose File➪Save As or press Shift+Ô+S or Ctrl+Shift+S.
In the Save As field, type the name of the document you are saving; we
name our example document ParkNewsSpring.indd. Choose a location
for the file and then click Save.
Working with Frames
By using the Master Text Frame feature when you open a new, InDesign creates
the frame for the text. But we want our newsletter to have colored frames 
at the top for the newsletter title and logo. Here’s how you can create those
frames.
1. Select the Rectangle Frame tool.
To see the name of a tool, hover your mouse over it until a Tool Tip
appears.
2. Click and drag to create a frame that is approximately 21p (3.5 inches)
wide and 4p (0.667 inches) tall, as shown in Figure 2-2.
You fine-tune the size and placement in the next steps. The new frame is
selected, as indicated by the white handles on its corners. If the frame
becomes deselected in the following steps, click it to select it.
21
Chapter 2: Taking a Quick Lap around the Track

3. Highlight the X: field in the Control palette and enter 15p. (If the
Control palette is not visible, choose Window➪Control or press
Option+Ô+6 or Ctrl+Alt+6 to open it.)
Doing so specifies the item’s origin across (placement from the left edge
of the page).
For the X:, Y:, W:, and H: fields, you can also experiment with clicking the
arrows near each field to change position, size, and other attributes.
4. Tab to the Y: field, which specifies the item’s origin down (placement
from the top of the page), and type 6p6.
5. Tab to the W: field, which specifies the item’s width, and type 21p.
6. Tab to the H: field, which specifies the item’s height, and type 4p.
7. Press Return or Enter to reposition and resize the frame according to
the values you enter, as shown in Figure 2-3.

The Control
palette 
lets you
precisely
position and
size items.
Figure 2-2:

Part I: Starting at the Beginning 

8. Be sure the frame is selected with the Selection tool, then choose
Edit➪Duplicate, or press Option+Shift+Ô+D or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+D.
Doing this makes a copy of the frame. (If there are no open squares on
the corners of the new frame, you need to click the frame with the
Selection tool to select it before you go on.)
9. To size and place the second frame precisely, we typed the following
values in the Control palette:
• X: 36p9
• Y: 6p6
• W: 22p6
• H: 4p
10. Press Return or Enter to reposition and resize the second frame.
For more information about working with frames, see Chapter 10.
Working with Text
To get text onto a page, you first create a text frame and then fill the frame
with text. You can type text directly into the frame or import a text file from
another application, most commonly Microsoft Word. After the frame is filled
with text, you can change the font, size, color, and many more characteristics
of both the text and the frame itself. But the first step is to create the text
frame. Here’s how:
1. Select the Rectangle Frame tool.
2. Click and drag to create a frame that is approximately the size you want.
In our example, we created a frame 45p (7.5 inches) wide and 4p (.667
inches) tall, as shown in Figure 2-4.
The new frame is selected, as indicated by the white handles on the
edges of the frame. If the frame becomes deselected in the following
steps, simply click it to select it.
Figure 2-4:
Use the
Rectangle
Frame tool
to give your

23
Chapter 2: Taking a Quick Lap around the Track

3. To size and place the frame precisely, we typed the following values
in the Control palette:
• X: 4p6
• Y: 9p6
• W: 43p6
• H: 5p0
4. Select the Type tool, then click the new frame to hold the story’s 
headline.
5. Type the word you want to appear in the frame.
In our example, we typed Blooming Cactus: Sure Sign of Spring in the
frame.
6. Highlight the entire phrase and choose a different font from the
Control palette’s Font Family menu.
The example in Figure 2-5 uses the font Century Old Style Std.
7. Choose 24 pt from the Font Size list in the Control palette, as shown in
Figure 2-5.
If you don’t see the Font Size list, click the A button at the left side of the
Control palette to display character-formatting options, as opposed to
the paragraph-formatting options.
Figure 2-5:
When text is
highlighted,
you can
apply
different
fonts and
sizes to it.
24
Part I: Starting at the Beginning 

8. Select the frame in the upper-right corner of your document and enter
two paragraph returns and the words Spring 2005.
9. Highlight the text Spring 2005 and apply a font to it; make the point
size 12 pt.
Here, we used the font Times.
Now you put text into the text frame that was created through the Master
Text Frame feature earlier:
1. Choose File➪Place, or press Ô+D or Ctrl+D.
The Place dialog box (shown in Figure 2-6) appears.
2. Locate and select the text file that you want to import into the text
frame.
In our example, we use a Microsoft Word text file.
3. Select the Show Import Options check box.
4. Click Open.
The Microsoft Word Import Options dialog box appears.
5. Be sure that Use Typographer’s Quotes is checked, and then click OK
to import the file.
Typographer’s quotes are the curly quotes used in publishing; if you
don’t check this box, you’ll get the keyboard quotes that peg you as a
beginner. After you click OK, InDesign shows the loaded-text icon (it
looks like a tiny paragraph), which indicates that a file is ready to be
placed into a frame.
Figure 2-6:

25
Chapter 2: Taking a Quick Lap around the Track

6. Click the two-column master text frame to pour the text into it.
Figure 2-7 shows the result.
If the text file you import is too big to fit in the text frame, a red square
will appear in the lower-right corner of the frame. For this example exer-
cise, you needn’t worry about that. If you do not have a text file to place,
you can simply type sentences in the text frame.
Because the first page of the article has the two empty frames at top as
well as the headline frame, you want to resize the master text frame for
this page so the story text doesn’t overprint the other frames.
7. To resize the frame, click the middle frame handle at the top of the
selected frame and drag it below the three other frames.
You can also set text wrap for each of those frames by using the Text
Wrap pane, which we cover later in this chapter.
After the text is placed, you need to format it:
1. With the Type tool, click anywhere in the text and highlight all the
text by pressing Ô+A or Ctrl+A.
2. Choose Type➪Character, or press Ô+T or Ctrl+T, to open the Character
pane; select a font family (the example uses Berthold Baskerville Book),
select a type style (Regular is fine), set the font size (our example uses
11 pt), and set the leading (the leading in our example is set at 13 pt).
Figure 2-7:
Your text is
placed, but
something 
is still not
quite right.
26
Part I: Starting at the Beginning 

Leading (pronounced “ledding”) is a typographical term that refers to
the space between lines of text.
You can also use the Control palette to adjust these settings. Figure 2-8
shows the Character pane and the results.
3. Make sure all the text is still selected and then choose Type➪Paragraph,
or press Option+Ô+T or Ctrl+Alt+T, to open the Paragraph pane.
4. Make sure the alignment is set to Justified (any of the group of four
buttons in the center and the top of the Paragraph pane) and the First
Line Indent (the second field on the left) is set to 0p10, as shown in
Figure 2-9.
You can also use the Control palette to make these adjustments.
Figure 2-10 shows the drop cap.

Chapter 2: Taking a Quick Lap around the Track

5. If you plan to create pages with the same type specifications, create
styles from the formatted text. Start with character styles (styles
applied to specific text selections, as opposed to whole paragraphs). In
this example, the only character style is for the drop cap’s text.
a. With the Type tool, highlight the drop-cap text and choose New
Character Style from the Character Styles pane’s palette menu.
(Choose Type➪Character Styles or press Shift+F11 to open the pane.)
b. Provide a name at the top of the New Character Style dialog box
and then verify the attributes in the Basic Character Formats pane.
c. Click OK when you’re done.
6. Now follow a similar process to create the paragraph styles from the
formatted text. Start with the regular story text.
a. With the Type tool, click anywhere in the text and choose New
Paragraph Style from the Paragraph Styles pane’s palette menu.
(Choose Type➪Paragraph Styles or press F11 to open the pane.)
b. Provide a name at the top of the New Paragraph Style dialog box
and then verify the attributes in the Basic Character Formats,
Indents and Spacing, Hyphenation, and Justification panes. (For
the drop-capped paragraph, also verify the settings in the Drop
Figure 2-10:
If you are

ing our
example,

cap in 
your docu-
ment looks

28
Part I: Starting at the Beginning 

Cap & Nested Styles pane, such as making sure it uses the correct
character style — defined in Step 5 — for the drop cap text.)
c. Click OK when you’re done.
Repeat steps 7a through 7c for each different type of paragraph.
You should end up with one character style (perhaps called Drop
Cap text) and five paragraph styles (they could be called Main
Headline, Internal Headline, Body Text, Drop Cap Body Text, and
First Body Text).
Apply the paragraph styles to your text by clicking anywhere in a para-
graph and then clicking the appropriate name in the Paragraph Styles
pane. You can also highlight a range of paragraphs and format them all
at once by clicking the desired style name in the Paragraph Styles pane.
To apply character styles, you would first highlight the text you want to
format and then click the desired style name in the Character Styles pane.
7. Choose File➪Save, or press Ô+S or Ctrl+S, to save your work.
For more information about creating and handling text, see Part IV.
Working with Lines
You can create lines of any shape, size, style, width, and color. In our exam-
ple, we add a line at the bottom of the first page. You can also add lines to
master pages if you want the lines to always appear when you create a docu-
ment based on a master page. To work on a master page, double-click a
master page icon in the Pages pane (choose Window➪Pages or press F12 to
open the Pages pane). Figure 2-11 shows the pane. A master page is essen-
tially a template page in your document to which you can add objects, then
have InDesign create new pages based on the master page, with all those
objects added automatically to those new pages. When you selected Master
Text Frame earlier, you were telling InDesign to place a text frame on the
default master page, called A-Master.
Figure 2-11:
The Pages
pane lets
you work on
master
pages as

29
Chapter 2: Taking a Quick Lap around the Track

1. To begin drawing a line, select the Line tool.
2. Be sure the Stroke button in the Tools palette is set to black — click
the Stroke button and then click the small black button in the row
below.
3. Position the mouse where you want to draw the line (in our example,
just below the text frame) and then click and drag to create a line, as
shown in Figure 2-12.
If you don’t want an uneven line, press the Shift key while you drag to
constrain the tool to drawing a horizontal or vertical line. The new line
is selected, as indicated by the white handles. If the line becomes dese-
lected in the following steps, just click it to select it.
4. Precisely place and size the line by using the Control palette. In our
example, we placed and sized the line as follows:
• X: 26p4
• Y: 63p9
• L: 43p6
• Stroke: 1p0
5. Choose File➪Save, or press Ô+S or Ctrl+S, to save your work.
For more information about working with lines, see Chapter 10.
Working with Graphics
In InDesign, any image that you import into a layout — whether it’s a digital
photograph, chart, or line drawing — is referred to as a graphic. A graphic
goes inside a graphics frame — either one that you create before you place a
Figure 2-12:

30
Part I: Starting at the Beginning 

picture or one that InDesign creates automatically when you import a graphic
but have no frame selected. Once a graphic is inside a frame, you can change
its size and placement.
1. Click the Rectangle Frame tool.
2. Position the pointer on the page and then click and drag to create a
rectangular graphics frame of any size.
The new frame is selected, as indicated by the white square handles. If
the frame becomes deselected in the following steps, click it to select it.
3. To import a picture, choose File➪Place or press Ô+D or Ctrl+D.
4. Locate and select a graphic file, such as a TIFF, JPEG, GIF, or EPS file,
and click Open.
Your new graphic is placed in your newsletter, in that selected frame, as
shown in Figure 2-13.
Figure 2-13:
You don’t
have to go
through
Customs to

31
Chapter 2: Taking a Quick Lap around the Track

5. If necessary to make the graphic fit, switch to the Direct Selection tool
and highlight the Scale X Percentage field in the Control palette and
enter a new scale, such as 80%.
The Scale Y Percentage field should change to the same value as long as
the two fields are locked (a chain button appears to their right). If the
chain is open (unlocked), click the button to lock the two fields.
You can also resize the image to fit the frame by choosing Object➪
Fitting➪Fit Content Proportionally (Option+Shift+Ô+E or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+E).
6. Add a runaround to the image so text does not run through the image:
a. Choose Window➪Text Wrap or press Option+Ô+W or Ctrl+Alt+W
to get the pane shown in Figure 2-14.
b. Click the Wrap Around Bounding Box button (the second from the
left) and set the wrap margins in the four fields (there’s one for
each side) to 0p6.
7. Import a logo graphic for the newsletter’s top left frame and size it to
fit, as shown in Figure 2-14.
It doesn’t have to fill the whole width of that frame.
Figure 2-14:

Creating Colors
To apply a color to an item or text, you first want to create that color.
InDesign provides a few very basic colors: cyan, magenta, yellow, [Black],
red, blue, green, [Paper] (white), [None], and [Registration]. (The names that
InDesign puts in brackets are colors that cannot be deleted or modified.) In
most cases, you create additional colors to suit your documents:
1. To open the Swatches pane, where you create, modify, and apply
colors, choose Window➪Swatches or press F5.
In the following steps, we create a color based on a color in our
imported logo.
2. Select the Eyedropper tool and then click the background color in
that logo.
The Park News logo shown in Figure 2-14 uses a beautiful moss green. Of
course, in this black-and-white book all you see is a dull cubicle gray.
Unless you’re creating a “Welcome to Dullsville” newsletter, choose a
vibrant, interesting color.
3. Choose New Color Swatch from the pane’s palette menu.
4. From the Color Mode pop-up menu, choose CMYK.
Doing this creates a color based on the four process colors widely used
in commercial printing: cyan, magenta, yellow, and black.
Because you selected a color with the Eyedropper tool, the New Color
Swatch dialog box shows the values, as Figure 2-15 shows. If you had 
not first selected a color with the Eyedropper tool, you would enter
values or slide the four sliders to select a desired color. If the Name with
Color Value option is checked, InDesign will name the color automatically;
if it is unchecked, you can give it a more memorable name, such as
Soylent Green.
Figure 2-15:

dialog box.
33
Chapter 2: Taking a Quick Lap around the Track

5. Click OK to create the color and close the dialog box.
If you want to create more colors, click Add instead of OK. Click OK only
when you want to close the dialog box.
Applying Colors
The InDesign Swatches palette, combined with the Tools palette, makes it
easy to experiment with different colors. You can apply colors to frame back-
grounds, lines, strokes, some imported images, and text.
1. Be sure the Swatches pane is open (select Window➪Swatches or 
press F5).
2. Using the Selection tool, select the two frames at the top of the page.
To select both, click one, then Shift+click the other.
3. Make sure the Fill button is selected in the Tools palette, as it is in
Figure 2-16.
This tells InDesign that you want to color the object, not any strokes it
may have.
Figure 2-16:
Click a

give new 
life to a

34
Part I: Starting at the Beginning 

4. Click the name of the color you want to use.
The selected frames will now fill with the color.
5. Highlight the text Spring 2005 in the upper-left frame.
6. Again ensuring that the Fill button is selected in the Tools palette,
click the color [Paper] in the Swatches pane.
Clicking [Paper] makes the text white. You can also adjust the font and
size of the text if you wish to, either through the Type menu or by using
the Control palette.
7. Choose File➪Save or press Ô+S or Ctrl+S to save your work.
Printing a Composite
Whether you’re designing a document for black-and-white photocopying,
color printing, professional printing, or even for PDF, you need to review
drafts.
1. Choose File➪Print or press Ô+P or Ctrl+P.
If you press Return or Enter as soon as the Print dialog box appears,
chances are that InDesign will print a usable draft on your printer.
However, if you select a different page size, orientation, or other option,
you might want to confirm the other settings.
2. At the top of the dialog box, the Printer pop-up menu is usually set to
your system’s default printer.
You can leave this setting alone or locate and select the printer you’re
actually using.
3. Go to the Output pane and make sure the Color pop-up menu is set to
Composite Grayscale, if you’re printing to a black-and-white laser
printer, or to Composite CMYK, if you’re printing to a color inkjet or
laser printer.
4. Look at the page preview at the lower-left corner of the dialog box
and make sure the page (you’ll see this indicated by a light-gray rec-
tangle) fits within the printer paper (indicated by the blue line), as
shown in Figure 2-17.
35
Chapter 2: Taking a Quick Lap around the Track

5. Click Print.
You should end up with a printed version of your newsletter. Check to
make sure that your colors printed out how you expected them to, and
that all of the different page elements are in their correct places. If you
find any problems, go back to your InDesign file and do some tweaking;
then print yourself another copy and check it again.
For more information about printing, see Chapters 22 and 23.

In This Chapter
 Discovering the document window
 Surveying the top tools
 Becoming familiar with tools, palettes, and panes
S
tarting to use a new software application is not unlike meeting a new
friend for the first time. You take a long look at the person, maybe ask a
few questions, and begin the process of becoming acquainted. Just as it’s
worthwhile to learn the likes and dislikes of a new friend, it’s also worth your
time to wrap your head around InDesign’s unique style and approaches. Once
you do so, you’ll find it much easier to start using InDesign to get work done.
This chapter explains where to look in InDesign for the features and capabili-
ties you need to master. We’ll introduce you to the unique interface elements
in the document window, survey the most commonly used tools, and explain
how InDesign packages much of its functionality through an interface element
called a tabbed pane.
Discovering the Document Window
In InDesign, you spend lots of time working in document windows — the
“containers” for your documents. Each document, regardless of its size, is
contained within its own document window.
The best way to get familiar with the InDesign document window is by open-
ing a blank document. Simply choosing File➪New➪Document, or press Ô+N
or Ctrl+N, and click OK opens a new document window. Don’t worry about
the settings for now — just explore.

Figure 3-1 shows all the standard elements of a new document window. We
won’t bore you by covering interface elements that are standard to all pro-
grams. Instead, the rest of this section focuses on InDesign-specific elements.
The Version Cue pop-up menu lets you see the current status of a document
in a shared workgroup setup. These are expert features you can ignore.

Part I: Starting at the Beginning 

Rulers
Document windows display a horizontal ruler across the top and a vertical
ruler down the left side. As shown in Figure 3-2, the horizontal ruler measures
from the top-left corner of the page across the entire spread, and the vertical
ruler measures from the top to the bottom of the current page. These rulers
are handy for judging the size and placement of objects on a page. Even expe-
rienced designers often use the rulers while they experiment with a design.
Both rulers display increments in picas unless you change the measurement
system for each ruler in the Units & Increments pane of the Preferences
dialog box. Choose InDesign➪Preferences on the Mac or Edit➪Preferences 
in Windows, or press Ô+K or Ctrl+K to open the Preferences dialog box. Your
choices include inches, points, decimal inches, ciceros, millimeters, and cen-
timeters. If you change the ruler measurement system when no documents are
open, the rulers in all new documents will use the measurement system you
selected. If a document is open, the rulers are changed only in that document.
If your computer has a small monitor and the rulers start to get in your way,
you can hide them by choosing View➪Hide Rulers or by pressing Ô+R or Ctrl+R.

Chapter 3: Understanding InDesign Ingredients

Zero point
The point where the rulers intersect in the upper-left corner of the page is
called the zero point. This is the starting place for all horizontal and vertical
measurements. If you need to place items in relation to another spot on the
page (for example, from the center of a spread rather than from the left-hand
page), you can move the zero point by clicking and dragging it to a new loca-
tion. Notice that the X: and Y: values in the Control palette update as you
drag the zero point so you can place it precisely. If you change the zero point,
it changes for all pages or spreads in the document. You can reset the zero
point to the upper-left corner of the left-most page by double-clicking the
intersection of the rulers in the upper-left corner.
If you move the zero point, all the objects on the page display new X: and Y:
values even though they haven’t actually moved. Objects above or to the left
of the zero point will show negative X: and Y: values, and the X: and Y: values
of other objects will not relate to their actual position on the page or spread.
You can lock the ruler origin (the zero point), making it more difficult to acci-
dentally change it. Control+click or right-click the ruler origin and choose
Lock Zero Point from the menu that appears. (The Unlock Zero Point com-
mand is right there as well, so you can just as easily unlock it.) Locking the
zero point is a good idea because it will remind anyone working on your doc-
ument that you prefer that they not fiddle with the zero point.
Pasteboard
The white area that surrounds the page is called the pasteboard. It is a work-
space for temporarily storing objects. Above and below each page or spread
is about an inch of pasteboard, and on the left and right a pasteboard space
as wide as a page. For example, a spread of two 8-inch-wide pages will have 8
inches of pasteboard to the left and 8 inches of pasteboard to the right.
Pages and guides
Pages, which you can see onscreen surrounded by black outlines, reflect the
page size you set up in the New Document dialog box (File➪New➪Document,
or Ô+N or Ctrl+N). If it looks like two or more pages are touching, you’re look-
ing at a spread.
InDesign uses nonprinting guides, lines that show you the position of margins
and that help you position objects on the page. Margins are horizontal guides,
and columns are vertical guides. Magenta lines across the top and bottom of
40
Part I: Starting at the Beginning 

each page show the document’s top and bottom margins. Violet lines show
left and right columns (for single-page documents) or inside and outside
columns (for spreads).
You can change the location of guides by choosing Layout➪Margins and
Columns, and you can create additional guides by holding down your mouse
button on the horizontal or vertical ruler and then dragging a guide into the
position you want.
Zoom field and pop-up menu
At the lower-left corner of the document window dwells the Zoom field,
which shows the current zoom percentage. You can type in a new value any
time. Immediately to its right is the Zoom pop-up menu that also lets you
change the document’s view. The view can be between 5 percent and 4,000
percent in 0.01-percent increments.
To change the view without taking your hands off the keyboard, press
Option+Ô+5 or Ctrl+Alt+5, enter a new zoom value, and press Return or
Enter. Or press Ô+= or Ctrl+= to zoom in, or Ô+– or Ctrl+– to zoom out.
Page controls
If you feel like flipping through pages of the document you are creating,
InDesign makes it easy with page-turning buttons and the Page field and pop-
up menu. Controls for entering prefixes for the page numbers of sections, and
for indicating absolute page numbers in a document that contains multiple
sections, are also handy. (An absolute page number indicates a page’s posi-
tion in the document, such as +1 for the first page, +2 for the second page,
and so on.)
Next to the Zoom pop-up menu is a combined page-number field and pop-up
menu encased by two sets of arrows. These arrows are page-turning buttons
that take you to, from left to right, the first page, the previous page, the next
page, and the last page. Just click an arrow to get where you want to go.
You can also jump directly to a specific page or master page. To jump to a
specific page, highlight the current number in the page number field (by
selecting it with your cursor, or by pressing Ô+J or Ctrl+J), enter a new page
number, and press Return or Enter. (To jump to a master page, select the
Page Number field and enter the first few characters of the master page’s
name.)

Chapter 3: Understanding InDesign Ingredients

Opening Multiple Document Windows
If you like to work on more than one project at once, you’ve come to the right
program. InDesign lets you open several documents at once. It also lets you
open multiple windows simultaneously for individual documents. A large
monitor makes this multi-window feature even more useful. By opening multi-
ple windows, you can:
 Display two (or more) different pages or spreads at once. You still have
to work on the documents one at a time, but no navigation is required —
you have only to click within the appropriate window.
 Display multiple magnifications of the same page. For example, you
can work on a detail at high magnification in one window and display the
entire page — and see the results of your detail work — at actual size in
another window.
 Display a master page in one window and a document page based on
that master page in another window. When you change the master

ument page is displayed.
To open a new window for the active document, choose Window➪Arrange➪
New Window. The new window is displayed in front of the original window. 
To show both windows at once, choose Window➪Arrange➪Tile. When you
choose the Tile command, all open windows are resized and displayed side
by side. (If you choose Window➪Arrange➪Cascade, all open windows are dis-
played stacked and staggered on top of each other. The front-most document
window is visible; the title bars of the other windows are visible above the
front-most document.)
When multiple windows are open, you activate a window by clicking on a
window’s title bar or anywhere within the window. Also, the names of all
open documents are displayed at the bottom of the Window menu. Choosing
a document name from the View menu brings that document to the front. If
multiple windows are open for a particular document, each window is dis-
played (they’re displayed in the order in which you created them) in the
Window menu.
To close all windows for the currently displayed document, press Shift+Ô+W
or Ctrl+Shift+W. To close all windows for all open documents, press Option+
Shift+Ô+W or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+W.

Tooling around the Tools Palette
You can move the InDesign Tools palette — the control center for InDesign’s
30 tools and 13 additional functions — by clicking and dragging it into position.
The Tools palette usually appears to the left of a document (see Figure 3-3).
To discover each tool’s “official” name, hover the mouse pointer over a tool
for a few seconds, and a Tool Tip will appear, telling you the name of that tool
(as shown with the Gradient tool in Figure 3-3). If the Tool Tips do not dis-
play, make sure that the Tool Tips pop-up menu is set to Normal or Fast in
the General pane of the Preferences dialog box (choose InDesign➪Preferences
on the Mac or Edit➪Preferences in Windows, or press Ô+K or Ctrl+K).
InDesign gives you one — and only one — tool for each specific job. The
Tools palette includes tools for creating and manipulating the objects that
make up your designs. The tools in the Tools palette are similar to those in
other Adobe products (such as Photoshop, Illustrator, and PageMaker). We
cover what each tool does in the following sections.
The small arrow in its lower-right corner of some tools is a pop-out menu
indicator. A tool that displays this arrow is hiding one or more similar tools.
To access these “hidden” tools, click and hold a tool that has the pop-out
menu indicator, as shown in Figure 3-4. When the pop-out displays, click one
of the new tools.

Chapter 3: Understanding InDesign Ingredients

You don’t need to worry about all the tools, so we highlight just those that
you’ll need to know to start using InDesign. You’ll likely come across the
others as you work on specific tasks, so we cover those in the chapters that
introduce those functions. For example, you’ll learn all about the Scissors
tool in Chapter 21.
Using the Selection tools
To work with objects, you have to select them. InDesign provides three tools
to do that, letting you select different aspects of objects.
Selection tool
This is perhaps the most-used tool in InDesign. With the Selection tool, you
can select objects on the page and move or resize them. You might want to
think of this tool as the Mover tool because it’s the only tool that lets you
drag objects around on-screen.
After you’ve selected the Selection tool, here’s how it works:
 To select any object on a document page, click it. If you can’t seem to
select it, the object might be placed by a master page (a preformatted
page used to format pages automatically), or the object might be behind
another object.
 To select an object placed by a master page, press Shift+Ô or Ctrl+Shift
while you click.
 To select an object that is completely behind another object, Ô+click it
or Ctrl+click it.

Part I: Starting at the Beginning 

Direct Selection tool
The Direct Selection tool is what you use to work on the contents of a frame,
not the frame itself. For example, you can use the Direct Selection tool to
select individual handles on objects to reshape them, or to move graphics
within their frames.
Here’s how the Direct Selection tool works:
 To select an object to reshape it, click the object to display anchor
points on the edges (the anchor points are hollow handles that you can
select individually, as shown in Figure 3-5). You can drag the anchor
points to reshape the object.
 To select objects placed by a master page, Shift+Ô+click or Ctrl+Shift+
click, as with the Selection tool. The Direct Selection tool lets you easily
select objects behind other objects and to select items within groups.
 To move a graphic within its frame, click inside the frame and drag the
graphic.
 To move a frame but leave the graphic in place, click an edge of the
frame and drag it.
Position tool
The InDesign CS2 Tools palette adds the Position tool, which acts like
PageMaker’s Crop tool.
The Position tool, which you access from the pop-out menu in the Direct
Selection tool, combines some aspects of the Selection tool with some
aspects of the Direct Selection tool:

45
Chapter 3: Understanding InDesign Ingredients

 As with the Selection tool, you can resize an object’s frame by dragging
its handles.
 As with the Direct Selection tool, you can click a graphic and reposition
it within the frame by dragging — and that has the effect of cropping the
graphic.
Using the Type tool
A very frequently used tool, the Type tool lets you enter, edit, and format
text. The Type tool also lets you create rectangular text frames.
Here’s how the Type tool works:
 To create a rectangular text frame, click and drag; hold the Shift key to
create a perfect square.
 To begin typing or editing text, click in a text frame or in any empty
frame and type away.
We discuss stories and threaded text frames in Chapter 14.
Using the object-creation tools
InDesign has a bunch of tools for creating shapes. Part V covers them in more
depth, but you should know about a few of them now, since they create objects
that can contain either text or graphics. Plus, you can also use them to draw
your own shapes that you then color or otherwise embellish in your layout.
Pen tool
With the Pen tool, you can create simple illustrations. You use the Pen tool,
which is modeled after the pen tools in Illustrator and Photoshop, to create
paths (both open, such as lines, and closed, such as shapes) consisting of
straight and curved segments. Give it a try — it’s fun!
Here’s how the Pen tool works:
 To create straight lines, click to establish an anchor point, then move
the mouse to the next location, click again, and so on. To move an anchor
point after clicking, press the spacebar and drag the anchor point.
 To create curved lines, click and drag, then release the mouse button to
end the segment.
46
Part I: Starting at the Beginning 

 To close a path and create a frame, click the first anchor point created
(the hollow one).
 To leave a path open and create a line, Ô+click or Ctrl+click away from
the path or select another tool.
Type tool
The Type tool lets you draw rectangular text frames, as well as type text
inside them.
Line tool
The Line tool lets you draw freestanding lines (rules) on your page. After
selecting this tool, simply click and drag the mouse to draw the line. Holding
the Shift key while you click and drag constrains the line angle to 45-degree
increments, which is useful for creating straight horizontal and vertical lines.
Frame and shape tools
InDesign has three frame tools — Rectangle Frame, Ellipse Frame, and Polygon
Frame — and three shape tools — Rectangle, Ellipse, and Polygon. The frame
and shape tools are redundant, since both frames and shapes can hold text
or graphics or be empty.
To create a rectangle or ellipse, choose the appropriate tool and click some-
where in the document window and drag the mouse to another location. The
rectangle or ellipse fills the area. But creating a polygon works differently:
1. Double-click the Polygon or Polygon Frame tool to display the
Polygon Settings dialog box, shown in Figure 3-6.
2. Enter a value between 3 and 100 in the Number of Sides field to spec-
ify the number of sides on your polygon.
3. To create a star shape, use the Star Inset field to specify the size of 
the spikes.
The percent value specifies the distance between the polygon’s bound-
ing box and the insides of the spikes (for example, entering 50% creates
spikes that are halfway between the bounding box and the center of the
polygon).
4. Click OK to close the Polygon Settings dialog box.
The settings are saved with the active document for the next time you
use the Polygon or Polygon Frame tool.
5. Click and drag to create the polygon, using the rulers or the Transform
pane or Control palette to judge the size and placement. To create a
symmetrical polygon, in which all the sides are the same size, press the
Shift key while you click and drag the Polygon or Polygon Frame tool.
47
Chapter 3: Understanding InDesign Ingredients

Using the navigation tools
Hand tool
The Hand tool lets you move a page around to view different portions of it or
another page entirely. After selecting the Hand tool, click and drag in any
direction. You can access the Hand tool temporarily without actually switch-
ing tools by pressing Option+spacebar or Alt+Spacebar.
Zoom tool
With the Zoom tool, you increase and decrease the document view scale. You
can highlight a specific area on a page to change its view or you can click on-
screen to change the view scale within InDesign’s preset increments, which is
the same as pressing Ô+= or Ctrl+= to zoom in.
View buttons
The very bottom of the Tools palette has two view buttons: Normal View
Mode and Preview Mode. The first shows the document’s pasteboard, mar-
gins, and guidelines; the second hides those so you can get a better idea of
how the document will look when it’s printed or saved as a PDF.
A pop-up menu in the Preview Mode button has two preview options: Bleed
mode and Slug mode. Bleed mode shows any objects that bleed (extend)
beyond the page boundaries, while Slug mode shows the space reserved for
information such as crop marks and color separation names used in final
output. You can read more about these in Chapters 5 and 6. You set these
options when you create new documents or by choosing File➪Document
Setup.

Working with Panes and Palettes
Both panes and palettes are “windows” of options to consider when working
in InDesign. Palettes — often made up of multiple panes — provide an inter-
active method of working with features, one that lets you access the controls
quickly. In many cases, palettes offer the only method for performing many
tasks.
Is it a pane? Is it a palette?
InDesign’s palettes usually contain two or more panes. Each pane has a tab;
to select a pane, click its tab. To better suit your working style, you can drag
panes from one palette to another, as well as to anywhere on-screen (creating
a new palette with just the one pane). That makes the distinction between a
palette and a pane somewhat artificial. In this book, we use palette to refer to
the entity that holds one or more panes, or for entities like the Tools and
Control palettes that are self-contained floating objects. We use panes as any-
thing that can be made a pane, even if you might have made it into its own
palette (for example, we still call the Transform pane the Transform pane,
even if we move it into its own palette).
Almost every palette (whether it contains one pane or many panes) has a
palette menu, which provides a pop-up menu of options specific to that pane.
The palette menu’s options are specific to the current pane.
As if the distinction between pane and palette wasn’t obscure enough, the
word pane has another use in InDesign. A pane is also a specific area in a
dialog box. Such multipane dialog boxes also have tabs (and in some cases,
option lists) that let you switch among the panes. Having multiple panes in a
dialog box lets Adobe fit more functionality into the same space on-screen.
You can tell that the developers of InDesign have a passion for panes. Because
there are so many of them, you might want to consider hooking up a second
monitor for displaying them. As with the tools, if you make sure Tool Tips are
49
Chapter 3: Understanding InDesign Ingredients
Using contextual menus
InDesign’s contextual menu interface element
is very useful. By Control+clicking or right-
clicking the document, an object, the rulers, and
so on, you can display a menu of options for
modifying whatever it is you clicked. InDesign
provides a lot of options this way, and it is often
easier to use the contextual menus to access
InDesign functions than to hunt through the
many regular menu options and panes.

enabled in the General pane of the Preferences dialog box (choose InDesign➪
Preferences or press Ô+K on the Mac, or choose Edit➪Preferences or Ctrl+K
in Windows), you’ll get some ideas as to what the pane icons and fields do.
InDesign CS2 adds the PageMaker Toolbar palette, the Quick Apply palette,
Object Styles pane, and the Data Merge pane.
Managing palettes and panes
To further confuse you, InDesign has two kinds of palettes: docked and float-
ing. Docked palettes appear at the left or right side of the monitor window;
double-clicking a tab in the palette will expand or minimize the palette,
depending on whether the palette is already expanded or not. Floating
palettes can be anywhere on your screen. You open them by choosing them
from the Window menu or, for those that have them, typing their keyboard
shortcuts. You close palettes and panes by clicking the Close box (in the
upper-left corner on the Mac and in the upper-right corner in Windows).
Whether docked or floating, InDesign’s palettes can be rearranged to suit
your needs:
 To combine the panes of different palettes, drag and drop a pane’s tab
into another palette.
 To pull a pane out of a palette into its own, drag and drop its tab out of
the palette into its own palette.
To manage InDesign’s palettes, you can create workspaces, which are essen-
tially memorized palette collections. You can create different combinations of
panes to customize the palettes. Display the palettes you want, where you
want them, and create a new workspace by choosing Window➪Workspace➪
Save Workspace. Give the workspace a name that makes sense, such as Text
Palettes. That workspace is now available via Window➪Workspace➪work-
space name, automatically displaying just those saved palettes in their saved
locations. By having several such workspaces, you can quickly switch among
collections of palettes based on what you’re working on.
A few palettes contain arrows in the lower-right corner that you can drag to
resize the palette. Some palette menus let you change the orientation of the
palette from horizontal to vertical. A few palettes also use a double-arrow
character next to the pane name to indicate that there is more to the pane
than may be displayed; click the pane title to expand or collapse those extra
options.
Unless you have a wall-sized monitor, you probably won’t have all the
palettes open at all times. As you become familiar with the palettes, you’ll
discover which ones you want to keep open.
50
Part I: Starting at the Beginning 

Using panes
To use a pane, first you need to activate it by clicking its tab (if the palette
containing it is open) or by choosing its menu command in the Window menu
(if the pane is not open or if another pane in that palette is active).
When a pane is active, controls in panes have the following characteristics:
 To display and select an option, click a pop-up menu; the changes take
effect immediately.
 To place a new value in a field, highlight the value that’s already in the
field and enter the new value. Note that fields accept values in all differ-
ent measurement systems (see Chapter 3). To implement the new value,
press Shift+Return or Shift+Enter. To get out of a field you’ve modified,
leaving the object unchanged, press Esc.
 To increase or decrease the value in the field use the clickable up and
down arrows (available for some fields).
 To use math to perform changes, enter calculations in the field. You can
add, subtract, multiply, and divide values in fields by using the following
operators: +, –, * (multiply), and / (divide). For example, to reduce the
width of a frame by half, type /2 after to the current value in the Width
field. Or, to increase the length of a line by 6 points, you can type +6 next
to the current value in the Length field. You can also use percentages in
fields, such 50%, which adjusts the current value by that percentage.
 To display a pane’s full menu, click the arrow in the upper-right corner
of a floating pane and in the upper-left of a docked pane. The palette
menu provides commands related to the current pane’s contents. Most
panes include palette menus that provide access to related features (see
Figure 3-7).

G
iving credit where credit is due, we can safely say that the nice people
who created InDesign did their best. They put their smart heads
together and made educated guesses about how most people would like to
work and, in doing so, established defaults for various settings in the pro-
gram. When you’re just starting out, it’s not a bad idea to simply stick with
the default settings and see how they work for you. But after you become
more familiar with InDesign and start putting it through its paces, you can
change default preferences, views, and measurements, making them better
suited to your way of working.
Preferences are program settings that dictate how InDesign will act in certain
instances. InDesign provides extensive preference settings for everything
from how objects appear on-screen to how text is managed for spelling and
hyphenation.
Setting InDesign to work your way is easy, and this chapter explains how. And
we promise not to numb you by covering every single option. Instead, we
focus on just those preferences you are likely to change. As for the rest, feel
free to explore their effects once you’ve gotten more comfortable using
InDesign. (And in other chapters, we’ll sometimes recommend specific prefer-
ences changes for the specific actions explained there.)
InDesign stores some preferences in the documents that govern how the doc-
ument works as you work on it, or as it is transferred to other users. Other
preference settings reside on your computer. Knowing how InDesign manages
preferences is important if you share preferences with others or want to make
sure that all your documents are updated with a new preference setting.

Setting Document Preferences
Preferences are settings that affect an entire document — such as what mea-
surement system you use on rulers, what color the guides are, and whether sub-
stituted fonts are highlighted. To access these settings, open the Preferences
dialog box by choosing InDesign➪Preferences or pressing Ô+K on the Mac, or
by choosing Edit➪Preferences or pressing Ctrl+K in Windows.
The Type and Advanced Type panes are new, splitting the options from the
old Text pane. The Appearance of Black pane takes the Print Options section
from the old General pane and adds additional control. The Autocorrect pane
is new to InDesign CS2. The Updates pane has gone away, and its settings are
now handled by clicking the Preferences button in the Updates dialog box
(Help➪Updates).
InDesign has two methods for changing preferences: You can change prefer-
ences when no documents are open to create new settings for all future docu-
ments, or you can change preferences for the active document, which affects
only that document.
When you open the Preferences dialog box, InDesign automatically opens the
General pane, as shown in Figure 4-1. To access one of the other 13 preferences
panes, just click its name from the list at the left of the dialog box. After you’ve
changed the desired preferences settings, just click OK to save those settings.
You cannot reverse changes to preferences by using the Undo command
(Edit➪Undo or Ô+Z or Ctrl+Z). If you change your mind about a preference
setting, reopen the Preferences dialog box and change the setting again.
Type preferences
The Type pane of the Preferences dialog box, shown in Figure 4-2, includes
settings that affect character formats, controls whether you use typogra-
pher’s quotes, and manages how text appears on-screen. You’re likely to
adjust these settings, so let’s go through the main ones.
 If Use Typographer’s Quotes is checked, InDesign inserts the correct
typographer’s quotes (often called curly quotes) for the current language
in use whenever you use quotation marks. For example, for U.S. English,
InDesign inserts typographic single quotes (‘ ’) or double quotes (“ ”)
rather than straight quotes. For French, InDesign inserts guillemets (« »).
 Check Triple Click to Select a Line if you want to be able to select an
entire line of text by triple-clicking it.
 When the Adjust Text Attributes When Scaling box is checked, InDesign
changes text size and proportional scaling when you resize the text box or
path that contains the text. If this box is unchecked, the text formatting is
54
Part I: Starting at the Beginning 

untouched. It makes sense to check this option if you work on display 
ads and other materials in which you size text visually and interactively; 
it doesn’t make sense for projects in which the text attributes are 
standardized.
 When the Apply Leading to Entire Paragraph box is checked, leading
changes apply to the entire paragraph, as opposed to the current line. In
most cases, you want the leading to be applied to all paragraphs, so it’s
a good idea to check this box.
 Adjust Spacing Automatically When Cutting and Pasting Words, which is
checked by default, will add or delete spaces around words when you
cut and paste.
 When Font Preview Size is checked, menus let you preview in your font
choice before you actually select it. The pop-up menu at right of the
check box lets you select the size of the preview.
 The options in the Drag and Drop Text Editing section of the Type pane
control whether you can drag and drop text selections within a docu-
ment. By default, Enable in Story Editor is checked and Enable in Layout
View is unchecked, which means that you can drag and drop text in the
Story Editor but not when working on a layout. You’ll probably want to
check them both.
 The When Pasting Text and Tables from Other Applications area lets you
choose how formatting is handled when you paste textual objects from
other applications. The default is Text Only, which means that you want
copied text to assume the formatting of the destination location’s text in
InDesign. The All Information option retains the original formatting when
you copy the text into InDesign.

56
Part I: Starting at the Beginning 

In the Character Settings section of the Advanced Type pane, you control
precisely how superscript, subscript, and small-caps characters are placed
and sized:
 The Size fields let you specify the percentages to which superscript and
subscript characters are reduced (or even enlarged). The default is 58.3
percent, but you can enter a value between 1 and 200 percent. We prefer
60 or 65 percent, depending on the type size and font.
 The Position fields let you specify how much to shift superscript charac-
ters up and subscript characters down. The default is 33.3 percent, but
you can enter a value between –500 and 500 percent. We prefer 30 per-
cent for subscripts and 35 percent for superscripts. Note that negative
values move text in the opposite directions: down for superscripts and
up for subscripts. The percentage is relative to the top of a lowercase
letter (the x height) for superscripts and to the baseline for subscripts.
 The Small Cap field lets you specify the scale of Small Caps characters in
relation to the actual capital letters in the font. The default is 70 percent,
but you can enter a value between 1 and 200 percent.
Composition preferences
Preferences in the Composition pane, shown in Figure 4-4, do two things:
highlight potential problems on-screen while you’re working, and establish
the behavior of text wrap in certain situations.
Highlighting potential problems
The Highlight check boxes control whether InDesign calls attention to possi-
ble typesetting problems by drawing a highlighter pen effect behind the text:
 Keep Violations, which is unchecked by default, highlights the last line
in a text frame when it cannot follow the rules specified in the Keep
Options dialog box in the Paragraph pane’s palette menu (Window➪
Type & Tables➪Paragraph, or Option+Ô+T or Ctrl+Alt+T), as explained
57
Chapter 4: Making It Work Your Way
Working with stored preferences
Some preferences in InDesign are stored in files
that you can share with other users, so the pref-
erences can be consistently used in a work-
group. These include keyboard shortcut sets,
color swatch libraries, document setups, work-
spaces, and scripts.
These types of preferences are called presets,
and the files that store them reside in the Presets
folder within the InDesign application folder.
When you save a preset, InDesign automatically
updates the presets file. You can then copy that
preset file to another user’s Presets folder.

in Chapter 17. For example, if the Keep Options settings require at least
three lines of text in the text frame, but only two lines fit and thus bump
all the text in a frame to the next text frame in the chain, the Keep
Options rules are violated, and the last line of text is highlighted.
 When H&J Violations is checked, InDesign uses three shades of yellow
(the darker the shade, the worse the problem) to mark lines that might
be too loose or too tight due to the combination of spacing and hyphen-
ation settings. (H&J refers to hyphenation and justification.) Chapter 17
covers this, too.
 Custom Tracking/Kerning, if checked, highlights custom tracking and
kerning (essentially, anywhere you overrode the defaults) in a bluish
green. Chapter 16 covers kerning and tracking in more detail.
 Substituted Fonts, which is checked by default, uses pink highlights in
pink to indicate characters in fonts that are not available and thus for
which InDesign has substituted a different font. For output purposes, it’s
important that you have the correct fonts, so you probably want to
leave this checked.
 Substituted Glyphs highlights, in pink, any glyphs (special characters)
that were substituted. This usually occurs when you have multiple ver-
sions of the same font, with different special characters in each version.
For example, a file that uses the euro (€) currency symbol might have
been created in the newest version of a font, but a copy editor working
on the same file may have an older version of the font that is missing the
euro symbol.

Part I: Starting at the Beginning 

Setting text-wrap rules
The three options in the Text Wrap area affect how text flows (wraps) around
images and other frames:
 Selecting the Justify Text Next to an Object check box overrides any
local justification settings to make text wrapping around an object justi-
fied. That means the text will smoothly follow the object’s shape, rather
than keep any ragged margins that can make the wrap look strange. This
option comes into play when you wrap ragged (left-aligned or right-
aligned) text around objects.
 Skip by Leading, if checked, uses the text’s leading to determine how
much space follows an object around which text wraps. This has an
effect is used only if you choose the Jump Object text-wrap option in the
Text Wrap pane (Window➪Text Wrap, or Option+Ô+W or Ctrl+Alt+W).
 Text Wrap Only Affects Text Beneath, if checked, causes only text below
(behind) an object to wrap around that object.
Chapter 18 covers text wrap in detail.
Measurement preferences
The Units & Increments pane, shown in Figure 4-5, is where you choose the
measurement systems for positioning items.
Figure 4-5:
The Units &
Increments
pane of the
Preferences
dialog box.
59
Chapter 4: Making It Work Your Way

Ruler Units area
The Ruler Units area affects three things: the zero point (by page, by spread,
or by the spine), the measurement system displayed on the horizontal and
vertical rulers in the document window, and the default values in fields used
for positioning objects.
The Origin pop-up menu determines the zero point (typically, the upper-left
corner of the page) for object positions. If you choose Page, the positions of
objects are relative to each page’s upper-left corner. If you choose Spread, the
positions of objects are relative to the current spread’s upper-left corner. If
you choose Spine, objects’ positions are relative to the binding spine of each
spread — the very top and center of where the two pages meet.
With the Vertical and Horizontal pop-up menus, you specify one measure-
ment system for the horizontal ruler and measurements, and the same or dif-
ferent measurement system for the vertical ruler and measurements. For
example, you might use points for horizontal measurements and inches for
vertical measurements.
To specify the measurement systems you want to use, choose an option from
the Horizontal pop-up menu and from the Vertical pop-up menu. You have the
following options:
 Points: A typesetting measurement equal to 1⁄72 of an inch (or 1⁄12 of a pica).
To enter values in points, type a p before the value or pt after the value
(for example, p6 or 6 pt).
 Picas: A typesetting measurement equal to 1⁄6 of an inch. To enter values
in picas, type a p after the value (for example, 6p).
You can combine measurements using both picas and points. Keeping in
mind that 1 pica is equal to 12 points, you can enter 11⁄2 picas as either
1.5p or 1p6.
 Inches: An English measurement system that is divided into 16ths. To
enter values in inches, type i, in, inch, or " after the value. For example,
3i, 3in, 3 inch, and 3" are all read by InDesign as “3 inches.”
 Inches decimal: Inches divided into 10ths on the ruler rather than 16ths.
To enter values in inches decimal, include a decimal point as appropri-
ate and type i, in, inch, or " after the value.
 Millimeters: A metric measurement that is 1⁄10 of a centimeter. To enter
values in millimeters, type mm after the value. For example, 14mm.
 Centimeters: A metric measurement that is about 1⁄3 of an inch. To enter
values in centimeters, type cm after the value. For example, 2.3cm.
 Ciceros: A European typesetting measurement that is slightly larger than
a pica. To enter values in ciceros, type c after the value. For example, 2c.
60
Part I: Starting at the Beginning 

 Custom: This option lets you set a customer number of points as your
measurement unit, placing a labeled tick mark at every point increment
you specify. You get to customize the number of tick marks between the
labeled marks by entering a value in the Points field. For example, if you
enter 12 in the field, you get a tick mark at each pica because there are
12 points in a pica.
Keyboard Increments area
This area lets you customize the way the keyboard arrow keys work. You can
use the arrow keys to move selected objects right, left, up, or down. You can
also use the arrow keys and other keyboard shortcuts to change some text
formatting. The options are:
 Cursor Key field: When you select an object with the Selection tool or
the Direct Selection tool, you can move it up, down, left, or right by using
the arrow keys on the keyboard. By default, the item moves 1 point with
each key press. You can change the increment to a value between 0
(which would be useless) and 8p4 (1.3888 inches). If you use a document
grid, you might change the increment to match the grid lines.
 Size/Leading field: The value in this field specifies by how many points
the leading or font size is increased or decreased when done with key-
board commands. You can enter a value between 0.001 and 100 (the
default is 2).
 Baseline Shift field: To shift the baseline of highlighted text up or down,
you can click in the Baseline Shift field on the Character pane, then click
the up or down arrow on the keyboard. The default for the Baseline Shift
increment value is 2 points, which you can change to any value between
0.001 and 100.
61
Chapter 4: Making It Work Your Way
Typographic terminology 101
Publishing tools like InDesign use specialized
terms, some of which appear in the Preferences
dialog box:
 Baseline: This term refers to the invisible
line that text sits on in each line. Except for
a few characters like g and p that poke
below it, all characters rest on this baseline.
 Kerning: This refers to an adjustment of the
space between two letters. You kern letters
to accommodate their specific shapes. For
example, you probably would use tighter
kerning in the letter pair to than in oo
because to looks better if the o fits partly
under the cross of the t.
 Leading: This term, also called line spacing,
refers to the space from one baseline to
another.
 Tracking: Tracking determines the overall
space between letters within a word.

 Kerning field: To kern text with keyboard commands, you position the
cursor between two letters and then Option+press or Alt+press the right
arrow button to increase kerning or the left arrow to decrease kerning.
By default, each click changes kerning by 1⁄50 of an em. You can change
this value to anything between 1 and 100.
Document defaults
InDesign also lets you change the default page size, margins, and columns in
new documents; the default attributes of guides; and the way layouts are
adjusted. You don’t modify these settings in the Preferences dialog box;
instead, to modify document defaults, first make sure that no documents are
open and then choose the following:
 File➪Document Setup (Option+Ô+P or Ctrl+Alt+P). The Document
Setup dialog box lets you change the default settings in the New
Document dialog box for the Number of Pages, Page Size, Facing Pages,
and Master Text Frame, as well as for bleeds and slugs if you click the
More Options button.
 Layout➪Margins and Columns. The Margins and Columns dialog box
lets you change the default settings in the New Document dialog box for
the Margins and Columns areas.
 Layout➪Ruler Guides. This opens the Ruler Guides dialog box where
you adjust the View Threshold and Color for all new guides.
 Layout➪Layout Adjustment. The Layout Adjustment dialog box lets you
resize entire layouts and modify how they are resized.
If you are unhappy with the preferences and defaults you have established,
you can revert InDesign to all its default settings. To revert all preferences
and defaults, press Control+Option+Shift+Ô or Ctrl+Alt+Shift when launching
InDesign.
Modifying Defaults for Text and Objects
When you create a new document, start typing, or create a new object, your
work conforms to default settings. You can change these settings. For exam-
ple, by default, a new document is always letter-sized, but if you design only
posters, you can change the default.
You may need to work with InDesign for a while to figure out which settings
you prefer. When you identify a problem — for example, you realize that you
always end up changing the inset for text frames — jot down a note about it
or close all documents right then. When no documents are open, change the
setting for all future documents.
62
Part I: Starting at the Beginning 

Text defaults
When you start typing in a new text frame, the text is formatted with default
Character formats, Paragraph formats, and Story attributes. You can also
choose to show invisible characters such as spaces and tabs by default; 
otherwise you need to manually activate character visibility in each text-
heavy document. To modify text defaults:
 Choose default options for character formats such as Font Family, Font
Size, and Leading from the Character pane. Choose Type➪Character
(Ô+T or Ctrl+T).
 Choose defaults for paragraph formats, such as alignment, indents,
spacing, and so on, from the Paragraph pane. Choose Type➪Paragraph
(Option+Ô+T or Ô+M, or Ctrl+Alt+T or Ctrl+M).
 Choose defaults for the [Basic Paragraph] style, which is what all
unstyled imported text, as well as text entered in a new text frame in
InDesign, will use. Choose Type➪Paragraph Styles (F11).
 Activate Optical Margin Alignment. Choose Type➪Story. This adjusts
the left position of characters along the left margin to make the left
edges look more pleasing, by letting the top of a T, for example, hang
slightly to the left of the margin, even if that means the characters aren’t
strictly aligned. (Since optical margin alignment works best for display
type rather than body type, it’s unlikely that you’ll activate optical
margin alignment as your default setting.)
 Show Hidden Characters is a good thing to activate if you always end
up turning on Show Hidden Characters when you are editing a docu-
ment. Choose Type➪Show Hidden Characters (Ô+Option+I or
Ctrl+Alt+I).
63
Chapter 4: Making It Work Your Way
InDesign versus Exposé: End the conflict
The Mac OS X Exposé utility usurps three com-
monly used InDesign shortcuts: F10 (which
opens the Stroke pane), F11 (which opens the
Paragraph Styles pane), and F12 (which opens
the Pages pane). Exposé provides a quick way to
change your display of windows on-screen, but
its usage of keyboard shortcuts long employed
by other programs is annoying.
We recommend that you change Exposé short-
cuts to ones that won’t interfere with InDesign
and other programs. To change the short-
cuts, open the System Preferences dialog box
(➪System Preferences), double-click the
Exposé button, and change or disable the
Exposé shortcuts in the Keyboard section of 
the Exposé dialog box.

Object defaults
When you create new objects, they’re based on default settings. For example,
you can specify how text wraps around objects. To modify object defaults,
use the following commands:
 Specify the default Columns, Inset Spacing, First Baseline, and Ignore
Text Wrap settings for new text frames using the Text Frame Options
dialog box. Choose Object➪Text Frame Options (Ô+B or Ctrl+B).
 Choose defaults for the [Normal Graphics Frame] and [Normal Text
Frame] styles, which are what all new frames created in InDesign will
use. Choose Window➪Object Styles (Ô+F7 or Ctrl+F7).
 Specify how text will wrap around all new objects. Choose
Window➪Text Wrap (Ô+Option+W or Ctrl+Alt+W).
 Choose a style for the corners of all new frames except those created
with the Type tool. Choose Object➪Corner Effects (Ô+Option+R or
Ctrl+Alt+R).
 Specify the default attributes of clipping paths imported into graphics
frames. Choose Object➪Clipping Path (Option+Shift+Ô+K or Ctrl+Alt+
Shift+K).
 Specify other default properties of objects. For example, if all objects
you create are stroked (framed), specify a weight in the Stroke pane.
Choose Window➪Stroke (F10), Window➪Swatches (F5),
Window➪Gradient (F6), or Window➪Attributes.
 Specify the default number of sides and the inset for the first new
polygon in a new document. Double-click the Polygon or Polygon
Frame tool to open the Polygon Settings dialog box (there is no menu
command or keyboard shortcut).
Modifying Defaults for Views
You can also control which layout tools display by default. Selections in the
View menu let you do this. If you prefer not to view the edges of frames, you
can hide them by default. Or if you always want to start with a document-
wide grid (see Chapter 11), you can show that by default. Other defaults you
can modify in the View menu include:
 Show the links between text frames. Choose View➪Show Text Threads
(Option+Ô+Y or Ctrl+Alt+Y).
 Hide the edges of frames. Choose View➪Hide Frame Edges (Ô+H or
Ctrl+H).
64
Part I: Starting at the Beginning 

 Hide the horizontal and vertical ruler. Choose View➪Hide Rulers (Ô+R
or Ctrl+R).
 Hide margin, column, and layout guides. View➪Grids & Guides➪Hide
Guides (Ô+; [semicolon] or Ctrl+; [semicolon]).
 Show the baseline grid established in the Grids pane of the
Preferences dialog box. Choose View➪Grids & Guides➪Show Baseline
Grid (Option+Ô+' [apostrophe] or Ctrl+Alt+' [apostrophe]).
 Show the document-wide grid established in the Grids pane of the
Preferences dialog box. Choose View➪Grids & Guides➪Show
Document Grid (Ô+' [apostrophe] or Ctrl+' [apostrophe]).
InDesign has another place to set view settings: in the Pages pane’s palette
menu, choose View➪Show/Hide Master Items. When you choose Show
Master Items, any objects on the currently displayed document page’s master
page are displayed. When you choose Hide Master Items, master objects on
the currently displayed page are hidden. This command is page-specific, so
you can show or hide master objects on a page-by-page basis.
Adding Default Colors and Styles
If you are a creature of habit, you may find yourself creating the same colors,
paragraph styles, character styles, and object styles over and over again.
Save yourself some steps by creating these features when no documents are
open; when you do so, the features will be available to all future documents.
To set up these often-used items, use the New command in the palette menus
for the following panes: Swatches (F5), Character Styles (Shift+F11),
Paragraph Styles (F11), and Object Styles (Ô+F7 or Ctrl+F7). You can also use
the palette menus’ Load commands to import colors and styles from existing
documents instead of creating them from scratch.
Chapter 10 covers color swatches, Chapter 13 covers object styles, Chapter
16 covers character styles, and Chapter 17 covers paragraph styles in more
detail.

Document
Essentials

In this part . . .
T
he reader sees your text and images, but as a layout
artist, you know there’s a lot more going on behind the
scenes. Your documents contain all sorts of elements —
the publishing equivalent of the girders and beams and so
forth of a building — that are essential to delivering the
final text and graphics. This part covers those document
essentials, showing you how to work with the document
files, pages, layers, templates, libraries, and sections — the
basic organizing elements and containers. You’ll also find
out how to put together books and similar documents that
have special needs such as automatic table of contents
and indexing.

Chapter 5
Opening, Viewing, and 
Saving Your Work
In This Chapter
 Creating a new document
 Opening documents
 Saving and exporting documents
 Recovering information after a crash
 Working with templates
You’re eager to create a new document and get started with InDesign. So
you launch InDesign, create or open a new document, and begin work-
ing. Right? Wrong, sort of. You can just plunge in, but you’re best served if
you have an idea before you start of what you want to accomplish. That way,
you won’t be staring at a blank screen with no brilliant ideas in mind.
Once you have an idea of what you want to do, you need to create the docu-
ment that will hold those brilliant ideas. InDesign lets you apply those ideas
from the very start of creating the document, and also lets you make changes
later on, as you refine your ideas.
This chapter shows you the basics of working with document files, from cre-
ating and opening them to saving them, as well as how to make a template for
easy reuse later on.
Setting Up a New Publication
After you launch InDesign, you have two options: You can choose File➪Open
(or press Ô+O or Ctrl+O) to open a previously created document or template,
or you can choose File➪New➪Document (or press Ô+N or Ctrl+N) to create a
new document.

Creating a new document is where all the fun is, since you get to create some-
thing yourself, from scratch. Here’s how to create a new document:
1. Choose File➪New➪Document or press Ô+N or Ctrl+N.
The New Document dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 5-1. It is here
that you will have to make many up-front decisions about how you want
your new document set up — including page size, number of pages,
number of columns, and margin width. Although you’re free to change
your mind later, you’ll save yourself time and potential headaches by
sticking with the basic page parameters you establish in the New
Document dialog box.
2. If you know exactly how many pages your publication will have, enter
the number in the Number of Pages field.
If you don’t know for sure, you can always add or delete pages later. So
guesstimate, since it’s easy to add or delete pages later.
3. Decide whether to lay out your documents in a spread or as separate
pages.
• If you’re creating a multi-page publication that will have a spine,
such as a book, catalog, or magazine, select Facing Pages.
• If you’re creating a one-page document, such as a business card, an
ad, or a poster, don’t select Facing Pages.
• Some publications, such as flip charts, presentations, and three-
ring bound documents, have multiple pages but use only one side
of the page. For such documents, don’t check Facing Pages, either.
Figure 5-1:

Document
dialog box

for your

Part II: Document Essentials 

4. If you want to flow text from page to page in a multi-page document,
such as a book or a catalog, check Master Text Frame.
If you check this box, InDesign automatically adds a text frame to the
document’s master page and to all document pages based on this
master page. Doing this saves you the work of creating a text frame on
each page and manually threading text through each frame. (See
Chapter 6 for more information about using master text frames.)
5. In the Page Size area, you can choose one of the predefined sizes from
the pop-up menu.
6. Specify margin values in the Margins area.
If Facing Pages is checked, Inside and Outside fields are available in the
Margins area. Designers often specify larger inside margins for multi-
page publications to accommodate the fold at the spine. If Facing Pages
is not checked, Left and Right fields replace the Inside and Outside
fields. You can also specify margin values by clicking the up/down
arrows associated with the fields.
7. To specify how many columns your pages have, enter a value in the
Columns field.
You can also specify the number of columns by clicking the up/down
arrows associated with the Column field.
8. Specify a gutter distance (the gutter is the space between columns) in
the Gutter field.
You can also specify a gutter width value by clicking the up/down
arrows associated with the Gutter field.
9. Click the More Options button to access the Bleed and Slug area of the
New Document dialog box (refer to Figure 5-1).
The More Options button provides options to set bleed and slug areas.
A bleed area is a margin on the outside of the page for objects you
want to extend past the edge of the page — you want them to extend at
least 1⁄8 inch so if there is any shifting of the paper during printing,
there’s no white space where the image should be (touching the edge
of the page). The slug area is an area reserved for printing crop marks,
color plate names, and other such printing information — some output
devices will cut these off during printing unless a slug area is defined.
For both bleed and slug areas, you can set the top, bottom, left, and
right margins independently.
10. Click OK to close the New Document dialog box.
Your new, blank document appears in a new document window. Figure
5-2 shows the window of a newly created document (a business card)
that uses the settings shown in Figure 5-1.
71
Chapter 5: Opening, Viewing, and Saving Your Work

You can bypass the New Document dialog box by pressing Shift+Ô+N or
Ctrl+Shift+N. When you use this method, the most recent settings in the New
Document dialog box are used for the new document.
Opening documents
Opening documents with InDesign is pretty much the same as opening docu-
ments with any program. Simply choose File➪Open (or press Ô+O or Ctrl+O),
select the document you want to work on, and then click the Open button.
But InDesign offers a few options for opening documents that you don’t find
in every program. For example, you can:
 Open more than one document at a time.
 Open a copy of a document instead of the original. This keeps the orig-
inal file from being overwritten accidentally — very helpful if you’re
making several variations of one document.
 Open a template under its own name. This makes editing templates
easier than it is with other programs, specifically QuarkXPress.
 Open documents created with Versions 6.0, 6.5, and 7.0 of PageMaker
and Versions 3.3, 4.0, and 4.1 of both QuarkXPress and QuarkXPress
Passport.

Opening InDesign files
To open an InDesign file (any version from 1.0 to CS2), follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Open, or press Ô+O or Ctrl+O.
The Open a File dialog box, shown in Figures 5-3 and 5-4, appears. The
Open a File dialog box will differ based on whether you are using
Adobe’s Version Cue file-management system or the standard Mac or
Windows interface. (This book’s screen shots assume that you are not
using Version Cue, so this is the only time we’ll show you the Version
Cue interface.) The sidebar “Banishing Version Cue” later in this chapter
explains how to turn Version Cue off.

2. Locate and open the folder that contains the document(s) you want to
open.
Select a single filename or hold down the Ô or Ctrl key and select multi-
ple filenames.
In Windows, the Files of Type pop-up menu offers several options:
PageMaker 6.0–7.0 files, QuarkXPress 3.3–4.1 files, InDesign files, InDesign
Interchange, GoLive Section, Adobe PDF Creation Settings Files, and All
Formats. Choose any of these options to display a specific file format in
the file list. (The GoLive Section and Adobe PDF Creation Settings Files
options are for experts, so don’t worry about them for now.)

Part II: Document Essentials 

On a Mac, the Open a File dialog box will display any supported file for-
mats that have a Mac icon, and the dialog box includes a Preview pane
that displays a thumbnail version of the selected file or, more commonly,
its icon. Use All Documents in the Enable pop-up menus to display files
without the expected icons (typically, those transferred from a PC or
perhaps via e-mail).
In Windows, the Open a File dialog box will display any supported file
formats that have a supported filename extension. Use All Files in the
Files of Type pop-up menu to display files with no filename extensions
(typically, these are files created on a Mac).
3. Select Normal under Open As to open the original version of the docu-
ment; click Open Copy if you just want to open a copy of it.
When you open a copy of a document, it’s assigned a default name
(Untitled-1, Untitled-2, and so on).
If you are opening a template to create a new version of a publication,
also select Normal; InDesign will create a document based on the tem-
plate. To open a template under its own name so that you can edit it,
click Open Original. (Templates are explained in the section “All about
Templates” later in this chapter.)
4. Click OK to close the dialog box.
Each document you opened is displayed in a separate document
window. The page and view magnification used when the document was
last saved is also used when you open the document, as we discuss in
Chapter 4.
Opening foreign formats
One of InDesign’s hallmarks is its ability to open documents from other pro-
grams and convert them into InDesign documents. You can open documents
created in PageMaker 6.0, 6.5, and 7.0 as well as QuarkXPress and QuarkXPress
Passport 3.3, 4.0, and 4.1. (Chapters 25 and 26 cover conversion issues in
greater detail.)
But beware: InDesign’s ability to open a foreign-format file doesn’t mean you
get a perfect translation. The other programs’ formats and capabilities are so
different from InDesign’s that you should expect to spend time cleaning up
the converted files by hand. In some cases, you might find that the amount of
cleanup work is greater than if you simply re-create the document from
scratch in InDesign — don’t panic when this is the case. And be happy when
your documents convert effortlessly. The good news is that InDesign will
alert you to any import issues of PageMaker and QuarkXPress files with a
dialog box that appears after the import is complete, as Figure 5-5 shows.
75
Chapter 5: Opening, Viewing, and Saving Your Work

When opening QuarkXPress files, here are some common conversion issues
to pay attention to:
 If your QuarkXPress document relies on XTensions (a type of plug-in) to
add capabilities (such as table creation), it will not convert correctly
into InDesign and may not even import at all. Examples include any doc-
uments built with the QuarkXPress indexing and book features.
 QuarkXPress’s line-spacing (leading) model is different than InDesign’s,
so expect leading to sometimes vary significantly, especially if you use
additive leading (such as +2pt to add two points to whatever the current
font size is) as the automatic leading method in QuarkXPress.
 InDesign won’t retain kerning-table adjustments in QuarkXPress 
files. (Like InDesign CS, InDesign CS2 does retain any kerning applied
manually — but InDesign 2 did not.)
 The customizable dashes in QuarkXPress are converted to solid and
dashed lines — note that stripes do convert properly.
 Special gradient blends, such as the diamond-pattern, are converted to
linear gradients or circular gradients.
 Text on a curved path is converted to regular text in a rectangular frame,
even though InDesign supports text on paths.
 H&J (hyphenation and justification) sets don’t have an equivalent in
InDesign, so they do not convert, although any H&J settings are carried
over into the converted paragraph styles.
 Rotated items may lose their rotation when converted to InDesign.
 Libraries won’t convert.
 Printer styles won’t convert.
Figure 5-5:

dialog box if

formats.

When opening PageMaker files, take note of the following:
 Fill patterns aren’t supported.
 Libraries won’t convert.
 Printer styles won’t convert.
Saving documents
When you open a new document, it’s assigned a default name — Untitled-1,
Untitled-2, and so on — and the first page is displayed in the document
window. At this point, you’re like a painter in front of a blank canvas. You can

Banishing Version Cue
Adobe’s Version Cue feature is meant to help
people collaborate in a workgroup, so you can
share a master file with multiple people, each
working on it in turn. Version Cue even lets you
save different versions of a file, so you can exper-
iment and then decide which one to keep. But
Version Cue is complicated and too difficult to use
in most environments. You can accomplish simi-
lar functions simply by saving common files to a
network server and saving new versions with
slightly different names, so you can later choose
the version you want.
But with InDesign CS2, Adobe forces you to use
Version Cue, at least at first. That’s because
Version Cue is turned on automatically for you.
To get rid of it, you have a few options:
 The easiest way is to turn off Version Cue
itself. Just choose InDesign➪Preferences➪
File Handling or press Ô+K on the Mac, or
choose Edit➪Preferences➪File Handling or
press Ctrl+K in Windows, then uncheck the
Version Cue option. Click OK. Voilà! Version
Cue is disabled for all your Adobe software.
 You can also go to the Macintosh 
System Preferences dialog box (➪System
Preferences) or the Windows Control Panel
(Start➪Settings➪Control Panels) and double-
click the Version Cue CS2 button to open a
pane that has an option to turn off Version
Cue. Again, this turns off Version Cue for all
your Adobe software.
 In some cases, you might want to leave
Version Cue on (maybe because you use it
occasionally in a workgroup setting) but not
use its unique dialog boxes for opening,
saving, exporting, and importing until you’re
ready to use the Version Cue tools. That’s
also easy: Click the Use OS Dialog button in
the Open a File, Save As, Export As, Load,
and other dialog boxes that work with file-
names. Clicking OS Dialog brings you to the
standard Mac or Windows dialog boxes,
which will continue to display until you later
click Use Adobe Dialog button in any of
those dialog boxes. Clicking Use Adobe
Dialog button in any of those dialog boxes
brings back the Version Cue interface for all
of those dialog boxes. Note that these
changes affect only InDesign CS2, not your
other Adobe software.

work on your layout without giving it a name, but it’s best to give it a name
by saving it as soon as possible so you don’t lose any changes to a power
outage or other system problem.
The second group of commands in InDesign’s File menu — Close, Save, Save
As, Save a Copy, Save a Version, and Revert — provide options for saving the
active (frontmost) document. Here’s a rundown of what each command does:
 Close (Ô+W, or Ctrl+W or Ctrl+F4) closes the active document. If the
document has never been saved or if it has been changed since it was
last saved, a dialog box lets you save, close without saving, or cancel
and return to the document.
 Save (Ô+S or Ctrl+S) saves changes you’ve made to the active document
since you last saved. (If you choose Save for a document that hasn’t yet
been saved, the Save As dialog box is displayed.)
 Save As (Option+Ô+S or Ctrl+Alt+S) lets you save a copy of the active
document using a different name (or with the same name in a different
folder). When you choose Save As — and when you choose Save for an
unsaved document — the Save As dialog box, shown in Figure 5-6,
appears. This dialog box lets you create or choose a folder for the docu-
ment, as well as name the document.
 Save a Version saves the current document as a version within a Version
Cue project. This latest save will be considered a version of the previ-
ously saved file. (This expert option is available only if Version Cue is
enabled.)
 Save a Copy lets you create a copy of the active document in a different
(or in the same) folder using a different (or the same) name. When you
use the Save a Copy command, the original document remains open and
retains its original name. It differs from Save As only in that it keeps the
original document open.
 Revert undoes all changes you’ve made to a document since you last
saved it. 
Knowing how to not save changes
InDesign is a very forgiving program. If you make a mistake, change your
mind, or work yourself into a complete mess, you don’t have to remain in
your predicament or save your work. InDesign offers several escape routes.
You can:
 Undo your last action by choosing Edit➪Undo or pressing Ô+Z or
Ctrl+Z. (Some actions, particularly actions such as scrolling that do not
affect any items or the underlying document structure, cannot be
undone.) You can undo multiple actions in the reverse order in which
they were done by repeatedly choosing Edit➪Undo or pressing Ô+Z or
Ctrl+Z — each time you undo, the previous action is undone.
78
Part II: Document Essentials 

 Redo an action you’ve undone by choosing Edit➪Redo or pressing
Shift+Ô+Z or Ctrl+Shift+Z. Alternately choosing Undo and Redo is a
handy way of seeing a before/after view of a particular change. As with
undo, you can redo multiple undone actions in the reverse of the order
in which they were undone.
 To undo all changes you’ve made since last saving a document,
choose File➪Revert. There is no way to undo this action and reinstate
all your changes after you revert, so be careful.

Saving files in other formats
InDesign’s Save commands (Save, Save As, and Save a Copy) let you save doc-
uments and templates in InDesign’s native file format. But the Export com-
mand (File➪Export) lets you save the stories — and in some cases stories
and whole layouts — from InDesign documents in several formats: InDesign
Interchange, Rich Text Format (RTF), Text Only, InDesign Tagged Text,
Encapsulated PostScript (EPS), Portable Document Format (PDF), JPEG, and
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).
Note that when exporting a file, you need to choose a format from the Format
menu (Mac) or Save as Type menu (Windows).
Here are your format options in more detail:
 InDesign CS format: You can make your InDesign CS2 files readable 
by InDesign CS users by saving your files in the InDesign Interchange
format. (There is no way for users of InDesign 2 or previous versions to
open InDesign CS2 or CS files.)
 Word-processing formats: If you place the text cursor into a story, you
can export its text (select a range of text if you want to export only that
selection) into one of two formats: RTF, for import into word processors
with only basic formatting retained; and Text Only, for import into word
processors that don’t support RTF (with Text Only, note that no format-
ting is retained).
You can save only one text file at a time. If you need to export several
stories from the same document, you must do so one at a time.
 InDesign workflow formats: If text is selected via the Type tool, you can
save the story in the InDesign Tagged Text format (for editing in a word
processor and later reimport into InDesign CS2 with all InDesign format-
ting retained) or in the InDesign CS Interchange format (for import into
InDesign CS).
 Production formats: Whether or not anything is selected, you can save
the document — not just the story — in EPS or PDF formats for use by
prepress tools and service bureaus or for import into other applications
as pictures.
 Online formats: Whether or not anything is selected, you can save 
the document — not just the story — in XML format for use in online
database-oriented content-management systems, as well as a specific
page, spread, or text selection into JPEG or SVG formats for use as
online graphics.

Part II: Document Essentials 

Recovering from Disaster
Make sure that when you work on InDesign documents, you follow the first
rule of safe computing: Save early and often.
InDesign includes an automatic-recovery feature that protects your docu-
ments in the event of a power failure or a system crash. As you work on a
document, any changes you make after saving it are stored in a separate, tem-
porary file. Under normal circumstances, each time you choose Save, the
information in the temporary file is saved to the document file. The data in
the temporary file is important only if you aren’t able to save a document
before a crash. (A word of warning: Although InDesign’s automatic recovery
feature is a nice safety net, you should still be careful to save your work
often.) If you suffer a system crash, follow these steps to recover your most
recent changes:
1. Relaunch InDesign or, if necessary, restart your computer and then
launch InDesign.
2. If automatic-recovery data is available, InDesign automatically opens
the recovered document and displays the word “Recovered” in the
document’s title bar.
This lets you know that the document contains changes that were not
included in the last saved version.
3. If you want to save the recovered data, choose File➪Save; “Recovered”
is removed as part of the filename, and InDesign will ask if you want to
overwrite the old file.
Overwriting the old file is easier than using File➪Save As and entering a
name — unless you do want to save a copy of the file in case you want to
go back to the old version later. If you want to use the last saved version
of the document (and disregard the recovered data), close the file (File➪
Close, or Ô+W or Ctrl+W) without saving, then open the file (File➪Open,
or Ô+O or Ctrl+O).
Sometimes, InDesign can’t automatically recover the documents for you.
Instead, it gives you the choice of recovering any files open during a crash or
power outage, saving the recovery data for later, or deleting the recovery
data. You typically want to recover the files immediately.
All about Templates
Whenever you save a document, you have the option of saving a standard
document file or a template (more on saving templates later in this chapter).
A template is an InDesign file that’s used to create multiple iterations of the
81
Chapter 5: Opening, Viewing, and Saving Your Work

same publication. For example, if you produce a monthly newsletter, you
save gobs of time and ensure consistency from issue to issue by using a tem-
plate as the starting point for each edition of the newsletter. A template is
essentially the shell of a publication that contains the basic framework —
page layout, master pages, styles, and so on — but doesn’t contain any actual
content.
When you open a template, you have two choices: You can either open a
copy of the file and use it to create a new publication, or you can open the
original file, make changes, and then save an updated version of the template.
If you want to use a template as the starting point for a new publication,
choose File➪Open or press Ô+O or Ctrl+O, locate and select the template, and
make sure Open Normal is selected in the Open a File dialog box (refer to
Figures 5-3 and 5-4) before you click Open. Clicking Open opens a new docu-
ment window and assigns the document a default name, Untitled-1, Untitled-2,
and so on.
If you want to modify a template file, select Open Original. Clicking Open
opens the original file and displays the original name in the title bar. Be care-
ful, because you’re now editing the template file itself, not a copy of it.
Whenever you save a document for the first time or you use the Save As or
Save a Copy command, the Save As or Save a Copy dialog boxes let you save
a standard InDesign document file or a template: You choose a format (docu-
ment or template) in the Format menu (Mac) or Save as Type menu
(Windows). By default, InDesign saves your layout as a document.
If you forget to save a document as a template, it will open under its actual
name. If you then make any changes and choose File➪Save (Ô+S or Ctrl+S),
the changes are saved with the original document. If this happens, simply
save the document again and choose the InDesign CS2 Template option.

I
t’s a rare InDesign user who creates only one-page documents. Even if you
spend your time working on business cards, ads, and posters, you proba-
bly produce at least a few multi-page documents. And if you create newslet-
ters, newspapers, books, catalogs, or any other such multi-page publications,
you must know how to add pages to your document, move pages around if
you change your mind, and delete pages if necessary. InDesign also lets you
divide multi-page documents into independently numbered sections.
As documents grow in size, getting around can be a real drag — on your time,
that is. The longer you spend getting to the page you want, the less time you
have to work on it. Fortunately, InDesign provides several navigation aids
that make it easy to move around on a page or in a document.
Understanding the Pages Pane
The Pages pane is where you do most of your page actions, so you get to
know it well the more you use InDesign.
If you intend to create a multi-page document, you want to display the Pages
pane (Window➪Pages or F12), shown in Figure 6-1, because it provides the
controls that let you add pages (both document and master), delete and
move pages, apply master pages to document pages, and navigate through a
document.
For more information about using the Pages pane to work on master pages,
see Chapter 8.

Keep in mind that the overwhelming majority of multi-page documents are
facing-pages publications such as books, catalogs, and magazines. Some
exceptions are flip charts and three-hole-punched publications printed on
only one side. In this chapter, the figures show examples of a facing-pages
document. If you create a single-sided multi-page document, the techniques
are the same as for facing-pages documents, but the icons in the Pages pane
show only single-sided page icons (the icons aren’t dog-eared).
Adding pages
A document can contain as many as 9,999 pages — more than anyone would
ever want to have in one file. In general, try to break up long publications into
logical pieces. For example, if you’re creating a book, it’s a good idea to
create separate documents for the front matter, each chapter, the index, and
any other parts (appendixes and so on). Also, if you’re producing a long doc-
ument, you want to take advantage of master pages (covered in Chapter 8),
which save you the work of building each page from scratch.
When you create a multi-page document, you’re free to add however many
pages you want. But be careful: Even though InDesign will let you create a
seven-page newsletter, in real life, facing-page publications always have an
even number of pages — usually a multiple of 4 and often a multiple of 16
because of the way printers arrange multiple pages on a single sheet of
paper before folding and cutting them into the final document.
Here’s how to add pages to a document:
1. If it’s not displayed, open the Pages pane by choosing Window➪Pages
or pressing F12.
Figure 6-1:

pane and its
palette
menu

new, facing-
pages
document.
84
Part II: Document Essentials 

2. From the Pages pane’s palette menu, choose Insert Pages.
The Insert Pages dialog box, shown in Figure 6-2, appears.
3. In the Pages field, type the number of pages you want to add.
4. Select an option from the Insert pop-up menu: After Page, Before
Page, At Start of Document, or At End of Document.
Be careful: If you’ve already started working on page 1, for example,
make sure you add new pages after page 1. Otherwise, it won’t be page 1
anymore, and you’ll have to move the objects you already created.
5. Type a page number in the field next to Insert or use the arrows to
increase or decrease the value in one-page increments.
6. From the Master pop-up menu, select the master page you want to
apply to the new pages.
7. When you’re finished, click OK to close the dialog box.
InDesign CS2 offers a faster way to add and manipulate pages if you don’t
happen to have the Pages pane already open: Choose Layout➪Pages, and
then select the appropriate option, such as Add Pages, from the submenu.
The resulting dialog boxes match those accessed from the Pages pane.
If you want to quickly add just one page after the current page, click
Layout➪Pages➪Add Page or just press Shift+Ô+P or Ctrl+Shift+P.
You can also add new pages or spreads one at a time at the end of a document
by clicking the Create New Page button at the bottom of the Pages pane.
(Spreads are added if a spread is selected in the Pages pane.) When you use
this method, the master page applied to the last document page is applied to
each new page. Pages are added after the currently selected page in the pane.
You can also click and drag a master page icon (or both pages in a facing-
pages spread to add a spread) from the top of the Pages pane to add a page
using a master page’s settings (use the [None] page for a plain page) between
any pair of document page spreads or to the right of the last document
spread. If a vertical bar appears when you release the mouse button, the
spread is placed between the spreads on either side of the bar. If a vertical
bar does not appear between document page spreads when you release the
mouse button, the new spread is placed at the end of the document.
Figure 6-2:
The Insert
Pages
dialog box.
85
Chapter 6: Discovering How Pages Work

When you insert new pages, existing pages are automatically changed from
left-hand pages to right-hand pages, and vice versa, as needed when individ-
ual pages are added and removed in a facing-pages document. You can pre-
vent this for selected spreads by first selecting them in the Pages pane and
then clicking Keep Spread Together in the palette menu. You might do this for
a spread, such as a two-page table, that you don’t want to have broken apart
when other pages are added or deleted. Of course, for proper printing, you
might need to move that spread when you’re done adding or deleting pages
so that it follows a complete spread.
Selecting pages
InDesign offers several choices for selecting pages from a document, so you
can move, delete, copy, or otherwise manipulate them:
 Click a page’s icon in the Pages pane to select it.
 To select both pages in a spread, the easiest way is to click a spread’s
page numbers to select both pages.
 To select a range of pages, you can click a page icon or spread number
beneath it and then Shift+click another page icon or spread number.
 To select multiple, noncontiguous pages, hold down the Ô or Ctrl key
and click page icons or spread numbers.
Copying pages
You can copy pages from one document to another by clicking and dragging
the page icon(s) from the source document’s Pages pane to the target docu-
ment’s Pages pane. Any master page(s) associated with the copied document
pages(s) are copied as well.
You can also duplicate the current spread within the current document by
clicking Duplicate Spread from the Pages pane’s palette menu or by choosing
Layout➪Pages➪Duplicate Spread.
Deleting pages
The fastest way to delete selected pages is either click and drag them to the
pane’s Delete Selected Pages button (the trashcan icon) or simply click the
Delete Selected Pages button.
86
Part II: Document Essentials 

Moving pages
Although you can move pages around in a document, do so only with great
care — if at all. Generally, if you want to move the objects on one page to
another page, it’s safer to cut (Edit➪Cut or Ô+X or Ctrl+X) or copy (Edit➪
Copy, or Ô+C or Ctrl+C) the objects than to move the page, which might
cause subsequent pages to shuffle.
What’s the big deal about shuffling? Shuffling will move pages around to make
space for the moved page, and that can move what had been left-hand pages
to the right-hand side of the spread and vice versa. If you have different align-
ments on left and right pages — such as having page numbers on the outside
of pages — this shuffling can wreak havoc with that alignment.
If you absolutely must move a single page, it’s safer to move its spread. (Of
course, if you’re working on a single-sided facing-page document, shuffling is
not an issue.)
To move a page, drag its icon between two spreads or between the pages of a
spread. A vertical bar indicates where the selected page will be placed.
Release the mouse button when the vertical bar is where you want to move
the page. To move a spread, drag the page numbers beneath the icons
(rather than the page icons themselves).
Alternatively, you can select the page(s) you want to move in the Pages pane
and then click Move Pages from the Pages pane’s palette menu. (If you don’t
want to work through the Pages pane, you can also choose Layout➪Pages➪
Move Pages.) In that dialog box, you can specify where to move the page(s):
after a specific page, before a specific page, at the beginning of the document,
or at the end of the document.
Starting documents on a left page
By default, InDesign starts all documents on the right page, which makes
sense because the first sheet in a document is always a right-hand page. But
sometimes you want documents to start on a left-hand page, particularly if
they are a chapter or section in a larger document. For example, magazine
articles often start on a left page, giving the introduction a full spread. To
start a document on a left page:
1. Select the first page in the Pages pane and then choose Numbering &
Section Options from the pane’s palette menu or choose
Layout➪Numbering & Section Options.
2. Select the Start Section option.
87
Chapter 6: Discovering How Pages Work

3. Select the Start Page Numbering At option and enter an even number
in the field.
4. Click OK.
The Pages pane will update, showing the start page on the left of the spine.
You may not want to assign a starting page number (for example, if the
starting page number is unknown because the number of pages that pre-
cede this document is unknown and you let the Book feature determine
the page numbers later). In this case, repeat Step 1, but deselect Start
Section. Doing so leaves the page as a left-hand page but let the Book
feature figure out the page number.
See Chapter 9 for more information on the Book feature and long-document
creation. Sections are covered later in this chapter.
Working with Page Numbers
By default, pages are numbered automatically starting at 1, but you can
change the page numbering from Arabic numerals to Roman numerals or let-
ters, as well as change the start page to something other than 1. To do so,
select the first page in the document in the Pages pane and choose
Layout➪Numbering & Sections or choose Numbering & Section Options from
the Pages pane’s palette menu. You get the dialog box shown in Figure 6-3.
To change the initial page number, select the Start Page Numbering At option
and type a new starting page number in its field. To change the page number-
ing style from the default of Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3, 4 . . .), use the Style 
pop-up menu and choose from I, II, III, IV . . . ; i, ii, iii, iv . . . ; A, B, C, D . . . ; and
a, b, c, d. . . .

88
Part II: Document Essentials 

To have a facing-pages document start on a left-hand page, the starting page
number must be even.
Entering page references in text
You often want page references in text — the current page number, for exam-
ple, or the target page number for a “continued on” reference. You could type
in a page number manually on each page of a multi-page document, but that
can get old fast. As we mention earlier in this chapter, if you’re working on a
multi-page document, you should use master pages. And if you use master
pages, you should handle page numbers on document pages by placing page-
number characters on the master pages.
If you want to add the current page number to a page, you can choose
Type➪Insert Special Character➪Auto Page Number or press Option+Shift+Ô+N
or Ctrl+Shift+Alt+N whenever the Type tool is active and the text cursor is
flashing. If you move the page or the text frame, the page-number character is
automatically updated to reflect the new page number.
To create “continued on” and “continued from” lines, choose Type➪Insert
Special Character➪Next Page Number to have the next page’s number
inserted in your text, or choose Type➪Insert Special Character➪Previous
Page Number to have the previous page’s number inserted. That next or pre-
vious page will be the next or previous page in the story.
One flaw in InDesign’s continued-line approach is that the text frames must
be linked for InDesign to know what the next and previous pages are. Thus,
you’re likely to place your continued lines in the middle of your text. But if
the text reflows, so do the continued lines. Here’s a way to avoid that: Create
separate text frames for your continued-on and continued-from text frames.
Now link just those two frames, not the story text. This way, the story text
can reflow as needed without affecting your continued lines.
Dividing a document into sections
Some long documents are divided into parts that are numbered separately.
For example, the page numbers of book introductions often use Roman
numerals, while standard Arabic numerals are used for the body of the book.
If the book has appendixes, a separate numbering scheme could be applied
to these pages. In InDesign, such independently numbered parts are referred
to as sections.
A multi-page document can contain as many sections as you want (a section
has to contain at least one page). If each section of a document uses a differ-
ent page layout, you probably want to create a different master page for each
section. Here’s how to create a section:
89
Chapter 6: Discovering How Pages Work

1. If it’s not displayed, open the Pages pane by choosing Window➪Pages
or pressing F12.
2. Click the icon of the page where you want to start a section.
3. Choose Numbering & Section Options from the pane’s palette menu.
The Numbering & Section Options dialog box appears (refer to Figure
6-3). By default, the Start Section option is selected. Leave it selected.
You can also create a section starting at the current page in your docu-
ment by choosing Layout➪Numbering & Section Options.
4. In the Section Prefix field, type up to eight characters that identify the
section in the page-number box at the lower-left corner of the docu-
ment window.
For example, if you type Sec2, the first page of the section will be dis-
played as Sec2:1 in the page-number box. This prefix won’t appear as
part of the actual page numbers when you print — it’s really just a way
for you to keep track of sections while you work.
5. From the Style menu, choose the Roman numeral, Arabic numeral, or
alphabetic style you want to use for page numbers.
6. For Page Numbering, select the Automatic Page Numbering option if
you want the first page of the section to be one number higher than
the last page of the previous section.
The new section will use the specified style; the previous section may
use this style or another style.
7. Select the Start Page Numbering At option and type a number in the
accompanying field to specify a different starting number for the 
section.
For example, if a book begins with a section of front matter, you could
begin the body section of a book on page 1 by choosing Start At and
typing 1 in the field. If you select Continue from Previous Section, the
first page of the body section begins one number higher than the
numeral on the last page of the front matter.
8. In the Section Marker field, type a text string that you can later auto-
matically apply to pages in the section.
You might want to enter something straightforward like Section 2 or, if
the section is a chapter, the name of the chapter.
You can insert the section marker name in folios, chapter headings, and
story text by choosing Type➪Insert Special Character➪Section Marker.
This is a great way to get a chapter name (if you use it as the section
marker) in your folio or to have cross-references in text to a section
whose name might later change. (A folio is the collection of a page
number, magazine or chapter name, section name, or issue date, and so
forth that usually appears at the top or bottom of pages.)
9. Click OK to close the dialog box.
90
Part II: Document Essentials 

When you create a section, it’s indicated in the Pages pane by a small, black
triangle over the icon of the first page in the section, as shown in Figure 6-4.
(If you move the mouse pointer over the black triangle, the name of the sec-
tion appears.) The page-numbering scheme you specify is reflected in the
page numbers below the page icons. When you begin a section, it continues
until the end of the document or until you begin a new section.
By default, the Pages pane displays section numbers beneath the icons of
document pages. If you want to display absolute page numbers — the first
page is page 1 and all other pages are numbered sequentially — you can do
so by choosing InDesign➪Preferences➪General or pressing Ô+K on the Mac
or by choosing Edit➪Preferences➪General or pressing Ctrl+K in Windows
and choosing Absolute Numbering from the View pop-up menu.
Removing a section start
If you decide that you want to remove a section start, navigate to the page
that begins the section, choose Numbering & Section Options from the Pages
pane’s palette menu, or choose Layout➪Numbering & Section Options, and
deselect the Section Start option. That’s it! The pages in the former section
will remain, but their numbering will now pick up from the previous pages.
Navigating Documents and Pages
Moving from page to page in a long document and scrolling around a large or
magnified page are among the most common tasks you perform in InDesign.
The more time you spend navigating to the page or page area you want to
work on, the less time you have to do the work you need to do. Like most
trips, the less time you spend between destinations, the better.
For navigating through the pages of a document, the Pages pane (Window➪
Pages or F12) offers the fastest ride. For navigating around in a page, you may
want to switch to the Navigator pane (Window➪Object & Layout➪Navigator).

Chapter 6: Discovering How Pages Work

Navigating with the Pages pane
When the Pages pane appears, you can use it to quickly move from page to
page in a multi-page document and to switch between displaying master
pages and document pages. To display a particular document page, double-
click its icon. The selected page is centered in the document window. To dis-
play a master spread, double-click its icon in the lower half of the pane.
The Fit Page in Window command (View➪Fit Page in Window, or Ô+0 or
Ctrl+0) and Fit Spread in Window command (View➪Fit Page in Window or
Option+Ô+0 or Ctrl+Alt+0) let you enlarge or reduce the display magnifica-
tion to fit the selected page or spread in the document window. Related view
options are View➪Fit Spread in Window (Option+Ô+0 or Ctrl+Alt+0) and
View➪Entire Pasteboard (Option+Shift+Ô+0 or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+0). (Note that
the shortcuts use the numeral 0, not the letter O.)
Navigating with the menus and shortcuts
InDesign also offers several menu commands and keyboard shortcuts to
quickly navigate your layout, as Table 6-1 details.

Using the Navigator pane
Although it’s possible to use the Navigator pane (Window➪Object & Layout➪
Navigator) to move from page to page in a long document, the Pages pane is
better for this task. The Navigator pane is more useful for scrolling within a
page, particularly for doing detail work on a page that’s displayed at a high
magnification. If you’re an Illustrator, PageMaker, or Photoshop user, you may
already be familiar with the Navigator pane, which works the same in all
three applications.
Figure 6-5 shows the Navigator pane and its palette menu.
You can also use the scroll bars at the right and bottom of the document
window to move to different areas of a page or to a different page in a 
document.
Adjusting Page Layouts and Objects
If you’ve ever created and worked with a document all the way to the finish-
ing touches and then discovered that the page size was wrong from the
beginning, you know the meaning of frustration. Manually adjusting the size
and placement of all the objects in a document is an ugly chore, one you want
to avoid at all costs. However, should the unthinkable happen — you have to
Figure 6-5:
The
Navigator
pane and its
palette
menu.
93
Chapter 6: Discovering How Pages Work

modify the size, orientation, or margins of a document that is partially or
completely finished — InDesign can automatically resize and reposition
objects when you change its basic layout.
For example, maybe you created a magazine for an American audience that
subsequently needs to be converted for publication in Europe. Most newslet-
ters in the United States use letter-sized pages (81⁄2 × 11 inches), while in Europe
the standard page size for such publications is A4 (210 × 297 mm), which is
slightly narrower and slightly taller than U.S. letter size. Of course, you have to
change color to colour, apartment to flat, and so on, but you also have to both
squeeze (horizontally) and stretch (vertically) every item on every page to
accommodate the A4 page’s dimensions. The Layout Adjustment command
(Layout➪Layout Adjustment) gives you the option of turning this chore over to
InDesign, which will automatically adjust object shape and position according
to the new page size, column guides, and margins.
The Layout Adjustment dialog box lets you turn layout adjustment on or off
and specify the rules used to adjust objects when you change page size or
orientation, margins, or columns. To adjust a layout, follow these steps:
1. Choose Layout➪Layout Adjustment to display the Layout Adjustment
dialog box, shown in Figure 6-6.
2. Select the Enable Layout Adjustment option to turn on the feature;
deselect it to turn it off.
3. In the Snap Zone field, type the distance within which an object edge
will automatically snap to a guideline when layout adjustment is 
performed.
4. Select the Allow Graphics and Groups to Resize option if you want
InDesign to resize objects when layout adjustment is performed. 
If you don’t select this option, InDesign will move objects but not resize
them (the preferred option, so you don’t get awkward sizes).
Figure 6-6:
The Layout
Adjustment
dialog box.
94
Part II: Document Essentials 

5. Select the Allow Ruler Guides to Move option if you want InDesign to
adjust the position of ruler guides proportionally according to a new
page size.
Generally, ruler guides are placed relative to the margins and page
edges, so you probably want to select this option.
6. Select the Ignore Ruler Guide Alignments option if you want InDesign
to ignore ruler guides when adjusting the position of objects during
layout adjustment.
If you think that objects might snap to ruler guides that you don’t want
them to snap to during layout adjustment, select this option. If selected,
InDesign will still snap object edges to other margin and column guides.
7. Select the Ignore Object and Layer Locks option to let InDesign move
locked objects (either objects locked directly via Object➪Lock
Position or Ô+L or Ctrl+L, or objects that reside on a locked layer).
Otherwise, locked objects will not be adjusted.
8. When you’re done, click OK to close the dialog box.
The Layout Adjustment feature works best when there’s not much work for it
to do. But if you radically change a document that you’ve already done consid-
erable work on, the Layout Adjustment feature usually creates more work than
it saves. For example, the switch from a U.S. letter-sized page to an A4-sized
page is a relatively minor change and the layout adjustments will probably be
barely noticeable. But if you decide to change a tabloid-sized poster into a busi-
ness card in midstream, well, you’re probably better off starting over.
Here are a few things to keep in mind if you decide to use InDesign’s Layout
Adjustment feature:
 If you change page size, the margin widths (the distance between the left
and right margins and the page edges) remain the same.
 If you change page size, column guides and ruler guides are repositioned
proportionally to the new size.
 If you change the number of columns, column guides are added or
removed accordingly.
 If an object edge is aligned with a guideline before layout adjustment, it
remains aligned with the guideline after adjustment. If two or more edges
of an object are aligned with guidelines, the object is resized so that the
edges remain aligned with the guidelines after layout adjustment.
 If you change the page size, objects are moved so that they’re in the
same relative position on the new page.
95
Chapter 6: Discovering How Pages Work

 If you used margin, column, and ruler guides to place objects on pages,
layout adjustment will be more effective than if you placed objects or
ruler guides randomly on pages.
 Check for text reflow when you modify a document’s page size, margins,
or column guides. Decreasing a document’s page size can cause text to
overflow a text frame whose dimensions have been reduced.
 Check everything in your document after the adjustment is complete.
Take the time to look over every page of your document. You never
know what InDesign has actually done until you see it with your own
eyes.
If you decide to enable layout adjustment for a particular publication, you
might want to begin by using the Save As command (File➪Save As or Shift+Ô+S
or Ctrl+Shift+S) to create a copy. That way, if you ever need to revert back to
the original version, you can simply open the original document.

I
f you’ve ever seen a series of clear plastic overlays in presentations,
understanding layers is easy. In one of those old overhead presentations,
the teacher could choose to start with one overlay containing a graphic, then
add another overlay with descriptive text, and then add a third overlay con-
taining a chart. Each overlay contained distinct content, but you could see
through each one to the others to get the entire message. InDesign’s layers
are somewhat like this, letting you isolate content on slices of a document.
You can then show and hide layers, lock objects on layers, rearrange layers,
and more.
And unlike those old overhead slides, you can selectively turn layers on or
off, so you can use layers for other purposes as well, such as having multiple
languages in one document, with each language’s text frames on their own
layers. Or you could have production notes on their own layer, so you can
see them when desired but otherwise keep them out of the way.
What Layers Can Do for You
If you never looked at the Layers pane, you could continue to do your work in
InDesign. But take a look at the possibilities and see whether they fit into
your workflow. In the long run, using layers can save you time and help you
prevent mistakes that can result when you need to track changes across mul-
tiple documents. It’s the kind of feature that, once discovered, can help you
work much easier.
Say you’ve created an ad with the same copy in it but a different headline and
image for each city where the ad runs. You can place the boilerplate informa-
tion on one layer and the information that changes on other layers. If any of

the boilerplate information changes, you need to change it only once. To
print different versions of the ad, you control which layers print.
You might use layers in the following situations (and in many others):
 A project with a high-resolution background image: For example, a
background such as a texture might take a long time to redraw. You can
hide that layer while designing other elements, and then show it occa-
sionally to see how it works with the rest of the design.
 A document that you produce in several versions: For example, a pro-
duce ad may have different prices for different cities, or a clothing cata-
log may feature different coats depending on the climate in each area.
You can place the content that changes on separate layers, and then
print the layers you need.
 A project that includes objects you don’t want to print: If you want to
suppress printout of objects for any reason, the only way you can do
this is to place them on a layer and hide the layer. You might have a
layer that’s used for nothing but adding editorial and design comments,
which can be deleted when the document is final.
 A publication that is translated into several languages: Depending on
the layout, you can place all the common objects on one layer, and then
create a different layer for each language’s text. Changes to the common
objects need to happen only once — unlike creating copies of the origi-
nal document and flowing the translated text into the copies, which you
would need to do for each language’s version.
Layer Basics
Each document contains a default layer, Layer 1, which contains all your
objects until you create and select a new layer. Objects on the default layer —
and any other layer for that matter — follow the standard stacking order of
InDesign. (What’s the stacking order? Well, the first object you create is the
backmost, the last one you create is the frontmost, and all the other objects
fall somewhere in between. This is how InDesign knows what to do with over-
lapping objects.)
Like the clear plastic overlays, the order of the layers also affects the stacking
order of the objects. Objects on the bottom layer are behind other objects,
and objects on the top layer are in front of other objects. In Figure 7-1, the
Default layer toward the bottom of the list contains the business card’s stan-
dard graphics and the main text. An additional layer contains a different set of
contact information — in separate text frames — for a different person. Each
new person would have his or her information on his or own new layer. Each
layer has its own color, and frames will display in that color if frame edges are
visible (choose View➪Show Frame Edges or press Ô+H or Ctrl+H).
98
Part II: Document Essentials 

Although people often compare layers to plastic overlays, one big difference
exists: Layers aren’t specific to individual pages. Each layer encompasses the
entire document, which doesn’t make much difference when you’re working
on a one-page ad but makes a significant difference when it comes to a 16-page
newsletter. When you create layers and place objects on them, you must con-
sider all the pages in the document.
The Layers pane (choose Window➪Layers or press F7) is your gateway to
creating and manipulating layers (see Figure 7-2).

Chapter 7: Layers and Layers

Working with Layers
Each document contains a default layer, Layer 1, that contains all the objects
you place on master pages and document pages. You can create as many
layers as you need. After you create a new layer, it’s activated automatically
so you can begin working on it.
Creating a layer
The Layers pane (choose Window➪Layers or press F7) provides several
methods for creating new layers. It doesn’t matter which document page is
displayed when you create a layer, because the layer encompasses all the
pages in the document. To create a layer, do one of the following:
 To create a new layer on top of all existing layers, click the New Layer
button on the Layers pane to open the New Layer dialog box. The layer
receives the default name of Layer x.
 To create a layer above the selected layer, Ô+click or Ctrl+click the
New Layer button. The layer receives the default name of Layer x.
 To create a new layer on top of all existing layers but customize its
name and identifying color, Option+click or Alt+click the New Layer
button, or choose New Layer from the Layers pane’s palette menu. Use
the New Layer dialog box to specify options for the layer. (The New
Layer dialog box — set with a custom name and color — is shown in
Figure 7-3.)
Customizing layers
You can customize the name, identifying color, guides, and lock status of
objects on a new or existing layer. If you choose to customize the layer when
you create it (by Option+clicking or Alt+clicking the New Layer button or by
choosing New Layer from the Layers pane’s palette menu), the New Layer
dialog box appears. If you choose to customize an existing layer, double-click
it to display the Layer Options dialog box. (You can also choose Layer
Options for Layer Name from the palette menu on the Layers pane.)
Figure 7-3:
The New
Layer dialog
box.

Part II: Document Essentials 

Whether you’re using the New Layer dialog box shown in Figure 7-3 or the
nearly identical Layer Options dialog box, the options all work the same:
 Name field: Type a descriptive name for the layer. For example, if you’re
using layers for multilingual publishing, you might have a United States
English layer, a French layer, and a German layer. If you’re using layers to
hide background objects while you’re working, you might have a
Background Objects layer.
 Color pop-up list: Choose a color from the list. A layer’s color helps you
identify which layer an object is on. The color appears to the left of the
layer name in the Layers pane and appears on each object on that layer.
The color is applied to frame edges, selection handles, bounding boxes,
text ports, and text wraps. By default, InDesign applies a different color
to each new layer, but you can customize it to something meaningful for
your document and workflow.
 Show Layer check box: Selected by default, this control lets you specify
whether objects on a layer display and print. If you want to suppress
printout of the objects on a layer (for example, to hide a different ver-
sion of a document or to hide pictures while proofing), deselect the
Show Layer check box. The Show Layer option has the same effect as
clicking the Eye icon on the Layers pane.
 Lock Layer check box: Deselected by default, this option lets you con-
trol whether objects on a layer can be edited. Select Lock Layer if you
don’t want to be able to select items and modify them. For example, in a
document containing multiple versions of text on different layers, you
might lock the layer containing background images and other objects
that stay the same. The Lock Layer option has the same effect as click-
ing the Pencil icon on the Layers pane.
 Suppress Text Wrap When Layer Is Hidden check box: Deselected by
default, this option prevents text wrapping around the layer’s objects
when the layer is hidden. Be sure to select this option when you use
multiple layers for variations of the same content, such as multilingual
text or different contacts for business cards. Otherwise, your layer’s text
can’t display because it is wrapping around a hidden layer with an
object of the same size in the same place.
The Suppress Text Wrap When Layer Is Hidden check box is new to
InDesign CS2.
 Show Guides check box: This check box lets you control the display of
guides that were created while the selected layer was active. When
selected, as it is by default, you can create guides while any layer is
active and view those guides on any layer. When deselected, you can’t
create guides. Any guides you create while that layer is active are not
displayed, but you can still see guides that you created while other
layers were active. Note that when guides are hidden entirely (choose
View➪Grids & Guides➪Hide Guides, or press Ô+; [semicolon] or Ctrl+;
[semicolon]), this command has no apparent effect.
101
Chapter 7: Layers and Layers

 Lock Guides check box: This works similarly to Show Guides in that it
affects only the guides that you created while the layer is active. When
deselected, as it is by default, you can move guides on any layer for
which Lock Guides is deselected. When selected, you cannot move
guides created while that layer was active. You can, however, move
guides on other layers for which Lock Guides is deselected. Note that
when all guides are locked (choose View➪Grids & Guides➪Lock Guides,
or Option+Ô+; [semicolon] or press Ctrl+Alt+; [semicolon]) this com-
mand has no apparent effect.
You can select multiple layers and customize them all at once. However,
because each layer must have a different name, the Name field isn’t available
in the Layer Options dialog box when multiple layers are selected.
Working with Objects on Layers
Whether you’re designing a magazine template from the ground up or modify-
ing an existing ad, you can isolate specific types of objects on layers. You can
create objects on a layer, move objects to a layer, or copy objects to a layer.
The active layer
The active layer is the one on which you’re creating objects — whether
you’re using tools, importing text or graphics, clicking and dragging objects
in from a library, or pasting objects from other layers or other documents. A
Pen icon to the right of a layer’s name means it’s the active layer (refer to
Figure 7-2). Although more than one layer can be selected at a time, only one
can be active. To switch the active layer to another layer, click to the right of
the layer name that you want to be active; the Pen icon moves, making that
the new active layer. Keep in mind that to activate a layer, it must be visible.
Selecting objects on layers
Regardless of the active layer, you can select, move, and modify objects on
any visible, unlocked layer. You can even select objects on different layers
and manipulate them.
The Layers pane (choose Window➪Layers or press F7) helps you work with
selected objects in the following ways:
 To determine which layer an object belongs to, match the color on its
bounding box to the color that appears to the left of a layer name.
102
Part II: Document Essentials 

 To determine which layers contain active objects, look to the right of the
layer names. A small square to the right of a layer name (refer to Figure
7-2) indicates that you have selected an object on that layer.
 To select all the objects on a layer, Option+click or Alt+click the layer’s
name in the Layers pane. The layer must be active, unlocked, and visible.
To select master-page objects as well as document-page objects on a layer,
you need to Option+Shift+click or Altl+Shift+click the layer name.
Placing objects on layers
To place objects on a layer, the layer must be active as indicated by the Pen
icon. Anything you copy, import, or create in InDesign goes on the active layer.
When you create objects on master pages, they are placed on the Default
layer and are therefore behind other objects on document pages. To create
objects on master pages that are in front of other objects, place the objects
on a different layer while the master page is displayed.
You can cut and paste objects from one page to another, but have the objects
remain on their original layer — without concern about the active layer. To
do this, be sure the Paste Remembers Layers is selected in the Layers pane’s
palette menu before choosing Edit➪Paste or pressing Ô+V or Ctrl+V.
Moving objects to different layers
When an object is on a layer, it isn’t stuck there. You can copy and paste
objects to selected layers, or you can move them by using the Layers pane.
When you move an object to a layer, it’s placed in front of all other objects on
a layer. To select multiple objects, remember to Shift+click them, and then
move them in one of the following ways:
 Paste objects on a different layer. First cut or copy objects to the
Clipboard. Activate the layer on which you want to put the objects, and
then use the Paste command (by choosing Edit➪Paste or by pressing
Ô+V or Ctrl+V). This method works well for moving objects that are cur-
rently on a variety of layers.
 Move objects to a different layer. Click and drag the active object
square (to the right of a layer’s name) to another layer. When you use
this method, it doesn’t matter which layer is active. However, you can’t
move objects from several different layers to the same layer using this
method. (If you select multiple objects that reside on different layers,
dragging the box moves only objects that reside on the first layer on
which you selected an object.)
103
Chapter 7: Layers and Layers

 Move objects to a hidden or locked layer. Press Ô or Ctrl while you
click and drag the active object box.
 Copy rather than move objects to a different layer. Press Option or Alt
while you click and drag the active object box.
 Copy objects to a hidden or locked layer. Press Option+Ô or Ctrl+Alt
while you drag the active object box.
Locking objects on layers
After you lock a layer, you can’t select or modify objects on it — even if the
locked layer is active. You might lock a layer that contains boilerplate text or a
complex drawing that you don’t want altered. Locking and unlocking layers is
easy, so you might lock one layer while focusing on another, and then unlock
it. To lock or unlock layers with the Layers pane, do one of the following:
 Click the blank box in the column immediately to the left of a layer’s
name. When the crossed-out Pencil icon appears, the layer is locked.
Click the crossed-out Pencil icon to unlock the layer. You can also
double-click a layer and select or deselect the Lock Layer option in the
Layer Options dialog box.
 If no layers are locked, you can lock all but the active layer by choosing
Lock Others from the palette menu.
 If any layers are locked, you can unlock all layers by choosing Unlock All
Layers from the palette menu.
 You can toggle between Lock Others and Unlock All Layers by Option+
clicking or Alt+clicking the blank box or the crossed-out Pencil icon.
When you lock an object to a page (by choosing Object➪Lock Position, or
Ô+L or Ctrl+L), the object’s position stays locked regardless of its layer’s lock
status.
Manipulating Entire Layers
In addition to working on objects and their layer positions, you can also
select and manipulate entire layers. These changes affect all the objects on
the layer — for example, if you hide a layer, all its objects are hidden; if you
move a layer up, all its objects appear in front of objects on lower layers.
Functions that affect an entire layer include hiding, locking, rearranging,
merging, and deleting. You work on entire layers in the Layers pane.
104
Part II: Document Essentials 

Selecting layers
The active layer containing the Pen icon is always selected. You can extend
the selection to include other layers the same way you multiple-select
objects: Shift+click for a continuous selection and Ô+click or Ctrl+click for a
noncontiguous selection.
Hiding layers
When you hide a layer, none of the objects on that layer display or print. You
might hide layers for a variety of reasons, including to speed screen redraw,
to control which version of a publication prints, and to simply focus on one
area of a design. Be careful when you hide layers with actual content —
InDesign won’t print, package, or export hidden layers, so you need to unhide
any needed layers before printing, packaging, or exporting.
To show or hide layers by using the Layers pane, do one of the following:
 Click the Eye icon in the first column to the left of a layer’s name. When
the Eye’s column is blank, the layer is hidden. Click in the column again
to show the layer. You can also double-click a layer and select or dese-
lect the Show Layer option in the Layer Options dialog box.
 If no layers are hidden, you can show only the active layer by choosing
Hide Others from the palette menu.
 Regardless of the state of other layers, you can show only one layer by
Option+clicking or Alt+clicking in the leftmost column next to its name.
All other layers will be hidden.
 If any layers are hidden, you can show all layers by choosing Show All
Layers from the palette menu. You can also Option+click or Alt+click
twice in a box in the first column to show all layers.
Rearranging layers
Each layer has its own front-to-back stacking order, with the first object you
create on the layer being its backmost object. You can modify the stacking
order of objects on a single layer by using the Arrange commands on the
Object menu. Objects are further stacked according to the order in which the
layers are listed in the Layers pane. The layer at the top of the list contains
the frontmost objects, and the layer at the bottom of the list contains the
backmost objects.
105
Chapter 7: Layers and Layers

If you find that all the objects on one layer need to be in front of all the
objects on another layer, you can move that layer up or down in the list. In
fact, you can move all currently selected layers up or down, even if the selec-
tion is noncontiguous. To move layers, click the selection and drag it up or
down. When you move layers, remember that layers are document-wide, so
you’re actually changing the stacking order of objects on all the pages.
Combining layers
When you’re just discovering the power of layers, you might create a docu-
ment that is unnecessarily complex (for example, you might have put each
object on a different layer and realized that the document has become too
difficult to work with). The good news is that you can also merge all the
layers in a document to flatten it to a single layer. To flatten all layers
1. Select the target layer (the layer where you want all the objects to
end up) by clicking it.
2. Select the source layers (the layers that contain the objects you want
to move) in addition to the target layer.
Shift+click or Ô+click or Ctrl+click to add the source layers to the
selection.
3. Make sure the target layer contains the Pen icon and that the target
and source layers are all selected.
4. Choose Merge Layers from the Layers pane’s palette menu.
All objects on the source layers are moved to the target layer, and the
source layers are deleted.
When you merge layers, the stacking order of objects doesn’t change, so the
design looks the same, but with one notable exception: If you created objects
on a layer while a master page was displayed, those objects go to the back of
the stacking order with the regular master-page objects.
Deleting layers
If you carefully isolate portions of a document on different layers and then
find that you don’t need that portion of the document, you can delete the
layer. For example, if you have a United States English and an International
English layer and you decide that you can’t afford to print the different ver-
sions, you can delete the unneeded layer. You might also delete layers that
you don’t end up using to simplify a document.
106
Part II: Document Essentials 

When you delete layers, all the objects on the layer throughout the document
are deleted.
Using the Layers pane, you can delete selected layers in the following ways:
 Click and drag the selection to the Delete Selected Layers button.
 Click the Delete Selected Layers button. The currently selected layers
are deleted.
 Choose Delete Layer from the Layers pane’s palette menu.
If any of the layers contain objects, a warning reminds you that they will be
deleted. And, of course, the ubiquitous Undo command (choose Edit➪Undo
or press Ô+Z or Ctrl+Z) lets you recover from accidental deletions.
To remove all layers that don’t contain objects, choose Delete Unused Layers
from the Layers palette.

In This Chapter
 Making layouts easy with master pages
 Applying master pages
 Using templates
 Using libraries
U
nless you enjoy continually reinventing the wheel, you’ll want to take
full advantage of the features that InDesign offers to help you work
more productively. After you make some important decisions about elements
in your document that will repeat, page after page, in the same spot (such as
page numbers, graphics, headers and footers, and so on), you want to set up
mechanisms that make the process simple.
Fewer activities in life are less rewarding than doing the same job over and
over, and publishing is no exception. Fortunately, InDesign includes some
valuable features that let you automate repetitive tasks. In this chapter, we
focus on three of them — master pages, templates, and libraries.
Creating and Using Master Pages
A master page is a preconstructed page layout that you can use to create new
pages — it is the starting point for document pages. Typically, master pages
contain text and graphic elements, such as page numbers, headers, footers,
and so on, which appear on all pages of a publication. Master pages also
include guidelines that indicate page edges, column boundaries, and margins,
as well as other manually created guidelines to aid page designers in placing
objects. By placing items on master pages, you save yourself the repetitive
work of placing the same items one by one on each and every document page.

It may surprise you to know that every InDesign document you create
already contains a master page, called A-Master. Whether you use the default
master page or create and use additional master pages depends on what kind
of document you want to create. If it’s a single-page document, such as a flyer
or an ad, you don’t need master pages at all, so you can just ignore them.
However, if you want to create a document with multiple pages — a brochure
or booklet, for example — master pages will save time and help ensure con-
sistent design.
Creating a new master page
When you’re ready to create a new master page, here’s what you do:
1. If the Pages pane is not displayed, choose Windows➪Pages or press F12.
The Pages pane is covered in more detail in Chapter 6.
2. From the Pages pane’s palette menu, choose New Master.
You can also hold Option+Ô or Ctrl+Alt and click the Create New Page
button at the bottom of the pane. The New Master dialog box, shown in
Figure 8-1, appears.
3. In the Prefix field, specify a one-character prefix to attach to the front
of the master page name and displayed on associated document page
icons in the Pages pane.
The default will be a capital letter, such as the B in Figure 8-2.
4. In the Name field, give your new master page a name.
It’s a good idea to use a descriptive name, such as Title Page.
5. To base the new master page (the child) on another master page (the
parent), choose the parent master page from the Based on Master pop-
up menu.
6. In the Number of Pages field, enter the number of pages you want to
include in the master spread. For a document with a single-page design,
enter 1; if the document will have facing pages, enter 2.
7. Click OK to save the page and close the dialog box.
Figure 8-1:
The New
Master
dialog box.
110
Part II: Document Essentials 

Your new master page will appear in the document window. The name of the
master page will appear in the Page Number field in the bottom-left corner 
of the document window. To make changes to a master page’s attributes,
simply click its icon at the top of the Pages pane, choose Master Options
from the pane’s palette menu, and then change settings in the Master
Options dialog box.
When you’re building a master page, you should think more about the overall
structure of the page than about details. Keep the following in mind:
 To build a document with facing pages, create facing-page master
spreads. The facing pages are somewhat like mirror images of each other.
Typically, the left-hand master page is for even-numbered document pages,
and the right-hand master page is for odd-numbered document pages.
 To have page numbers automatically appear on document pages, add
a page number character on each page of your master spreads by draw-
ing a text frame with the Type tool where you want the page number to
appear and then choosing Type➪Insert Special Character➪Auto Page
Number or pressing Option+Shift+Ô+N or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+N. The prefix of
the master page (A, B, C, and so on) appears on the master page, but the
actual page number is what appears on document pages. Don’t forget to
format the page number on the master page so that page numbers will
look the way you want them to in the document.
 Specify master page margins and columns by first making sure that the
page is displayed in the document window and then choosing Layout➪
Margins and Columns. The Margins and Columns dialog box, shown in
Figure 8-2, is displayed. The controls in this dialog box let you specify
the position of the margins, the number of columns, and the gutter
width (space between columns).
You can place additional guidelines on a master page — as many custom
guidelines as you want. (Guidelines are covered later in this chapter.)
To copy a master page from one document to another, just drag the master
page’s name from Pages pane to the target document.

Chapter 8: Creating Layouts Right the First Time

Basing one master page on another
Some publications benefit from having more than one master page. If you’re
building a document with several pages that are somewhat similar in design,
it’s a good idea to start with one master page and then use it as a basis for
additional master pages.
For example, if the brochure you’re working on uses both two-column and
three-column page layouts, you can create the two-column master spread first
and include all repeating page elements. You can then create the three-column
master page spread, basing it on the two-column master, and simply specify dif-
ferent column formats. The “child” master page will be identical to the parent
except for the number of columns. If you later change an element on the origi-
nal master page, the change will apply automatically to the child master page.
When you create a new master page, the New Master dialog box provides the
option to base it on an existing master page. To help you keep things straight,
when you base a master page on another master page, InDesign displays the
prefix of the parent page on the icon of the child page.
If you base a master spread on another master spread, you can still modify
the master objects (that is, the objects inherited from the parent master) on
the child master page. As with regular document pages, you have to Shift+Ô+
click or Ctrl+Shift+click the object inherited from a parent master to release it
before you can edit it on a child master.
Basing a master spread on a document spread
You might be talented enough to create an effective spread, one that is so
handsome that you want to create a master page from it to use on future doc-
uments. Simply highlight the spread by clicking the page numbers below the
relevant page icons in the Pages pane and choose Save as Master from the
Pages pane’s palette menu. The new master is assigned a default name and
prefix. To change any of its attributes, click its name in the Pages pane and
then choose Master Options from the pop-up menu.
Duplicating a master spread
Create a copy of a master spread by selecting its icon and then choosing
Duplicate Master Spread from the Pages pane’s palette menu or simply by drag-
ging its icon onto the Create New Page button at the bottom of the pane. If you
duplicate a master spread, the duplicate loses any parent/child relationships.
Deleting a master
To delete a master page, select its name and then choose Delete Master Page
from the Pages pane’s palette menu. You can also drag the master icon to the
Delete Pages button at the bottom of the Pages pane.

Part II: Document Essentials 

Applying a master page to document pages
After you build a master page, you can apply it to new or existing document
pages. (See Chapter 6 for information about adding and removing document
pages.) For documents with facing pages, you can apply both pages of a master
spread to both pages of the document spread or you can apply one page of a
master spread to one page of the document spread. For example, you can
apply a master page with a two-column format to the left-hand page of a docu-
ment spread and apply a master page with a three-column format to the right-
hand page.
To apply a master page to a document page, select the name or icon of the
page in the top part of the Pages palette and then drag it onto the icon of the
document page you want to format. When the target document page is high-
lighted (framed in a black rectangle, as shown in the left side of Figure 8-3),
release the mouse button. If both document pages are highlighted, and if you
are applying a master page to the document, both sides of the master spread
are applied to the document spread.
InDesign CS2 lets you apply a master page to the currently displayed page(s)
by choosing Layout➪Pages➪Apply Master to Page(s).
Changing master items on document pages
As you work on a document page that’s based on a master, you may find that
you need to change, move, or delete a master object. Any change you make
to a master object on a local page is referred to as a local override.
Figure 8-3:
Applying a
single

page to a

page.
113
Chapter 8: Creating Layouts Right the First Time

Whenever you remove a master object from a document page, you sever the
object’s relationship to the master-page object for that document page only.
If you subsequently move or modify the object on the master page, it won’t
affect the deleted object on the document page — it remains deleted on that
particular document page.
The Show/Hide Master Items command in the Pages pane’s palette menu lets
you show or hide master objects on document pages.
To change a master object on a document page, you must first select it, and
doing so can be a bit tricky. To select a master object on a document page,
hold down Shift+Ô or Ctrl+Shift when you click the object with one of the
selection tools. After you select a master object on a document page, you can
modify it just as you would objects that are not part of a master page.
If you modify one or more master objects on a document page and then
decide you want to revert back to using the original master objects, you can
remove the local overrides. To do so, display the document page that con-
tains the master objects you’ve modified, select the objects, and then choose
Remove Selected Local Overrides from the Pages pane’s palette menu. If no
objects are selected, the command name changes to Remove All Local
Overrides. If the selected spread doesn’t have any modified master objects,
the command is not available.
Building a Template
A template is a pre-built InDesign document that you use as the starting point
for creating multiple versions of the same design or publication. For example,
if you create a monthly newsletter that uses the same layout for each issue,
but with different graphics and text, you begin by creating a template that
contains all the elements that are the same in every issue — placeholder
frames for the graphics and text, guidelines, and so on.
Creating a template is very similar to creating a document. You create charac-
ter, paragraph, and object styles, master pages, repeating elements (for exam-
ple, page numbers), and so on. The only thing you don’t add to a template is
actual content.
Most often, you create a template after building the first iteration of a docu-
ment. Once you have that document set up the way you like, you simply strip
out the content (that first issue’s stories and graphics in our newsletter
example) and save it as a template.
114
Part II: Document Essentials 

Here are the steps for creating a template:
1. Choose File➪Save As or press Shift+Ô+S or Ctrl+Shift+S to display the
Save As dialog box, shown in Figure 8-4.
2. Choose a folder and specify a name for the file.
3. Choose InDesign CS2 Template in the Format pop-up menu (Mac) or
Save as Type pop-up menu (Windows).
4. Click Save to close the Save As dialog box and save the template.
If you’re designing a template that will be used by others, you might want to
add a layer of instructions. When it’s time to print a document based on the
template, simply hide the annotation layer. (See Chapter 7 for more informa-
tion about working with layers.)
If you didn’t know better, you might think that a template is exactly the same
as a regular InDesign document. It is, with one major exception: A template is
a bit more difficult to override. When you open a template, it receives a
default name (Untitled-1, Untitled-2, and so on). The first time you choose
File➪Save or press Ô+S or Ctrl+S, the Save As dialog box appears.
As you use a template over time, you might discover that you forgot to
include something — perhaps a paragraph style, a repeating element on a
particular master page, or an entire master page. To modify a template, you
must open it, make your changes, and then use the Save As command to save
it again as a template.

Chapter 8: Creating Layouts Right the First Time

Using Libraries
An InDesign library is a file — similar in some ways to a document file —
where you can store individual objects (graphics, text, and so forth), groups
and nested objects, ruler guides, and grids. Once an item is in a library, every
time you need a copy, you simply drag one out of the library.
Creating a library is easy:
1. Choose File➪New➪Library.
The New Library dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 8-5.
2. Choose a location in which to save the library.
3. Give the library a name.
4. Click OK.
You can create as many libraries as you want and store them wherever is
most convenient, including on a networked server so that other InDesign
users can share them. You can also open libraries created on a Mac from a
Windows computer, and vice versa.
Right after you create a new library, you see an empty library pane, as shown
in Figure 8-6. The title bar displays the name you assigned to the library
(Icons, in our example). To add items to the library, you drag them to the
pane. You can group the pane with other panes (by dragging its tab onto
another pane) or close it by clicking its close box or choosing Close Library
from its pop-up menu.
Figure 8-5:
The New
Library
dialog box.
116
Part II: Document Essentials 

Here is an explanation of some of the controls and commands shown in
Figure 8-6:
 The numbers in the lower-left corner of the pane indicate the number of
items currently displayed in the pane and the number of items in the
library. In our example in Figure 8-6, these numbers are zeroes because
we just opened a new library.
 The Library Item Information button displays the Item Information
dialog box. Here you can give each library item a name, a type (for exam-
ple, image or text), and a description. Later, you can search for library
items based on these attributes.
 The Show Library Subset button displays a dialog box that lets you
locate and display items that meet certain search criteria.
 The Delete Library Item button lets you delete highlighted items in the
library.
Putting items into a library
You can place individual items, such as text and graphics frames, into a
library. You can also place multiple selected objects, groups, nested frames,
ruler guides, guidelines, and all items on a document page.
To add items to a library:
 Select one or more items and then drag and drop them into an open
library pane. (Open an existing library by choosing File➪Open or by
pressing Ô+O or Ctrl+O.)

 Select one or more items and then choose Add Item from the pop-up
menu of an open Library pane.
 Choose Add All Items on Page from the pop-up menu of an open 
Library pane to add all items on the current page or spread as one
library item. Choose Add All Items on Page as Separate Objects to 
add each object on the page in one step as a separate library item.
 Select one or more items and then click the New Library Item button at
the bottom of an open Library pane.
If you hold down the Option or Alt key when adding an item to a library, the
Item Information dialog box is displayed. This dialog box lets you add search-
able attributes to the library item.
If you import a graphic into a document and then place a copy of the graphic
into a library, the path to the original graphics file is saved, as are any trans-
formations you’ve applied to the graphic or its frame (scale, rotation, shear,
and so on). If you save text in a library, all formats, including styles, are
retained.
Tagging library items
A library can hold as many items as you want. As a library grows, locating a
particular item can become increasingly difficult. To make InDesign library
items more easily found, tag them with several searchable attributes.
To tag a library element, select it and then choose Item Information from the
library pane’s palette menu. You can also display the Item Information dialog
box by double-clicking a library item or by clicking once on a library item and
then clicking the Library Item Information icon at the bottom of the Library
pane. (It’s the i in a circle.) Specify a Name, Object Type, and/or Description.
In the Description field, use a few words that describe the object; this will
make it easier to find later. Click OK to close the dialog box and return to the
document.
Searching for library items
You can search for library items based on the information specified in the
Item Information dialog box. For example, if you place several different icons
into a library that includes many other items, and if you use the term icon in
the Name or Description field, a search of these fields that includes icon will
find and display those items stored in your library.
Follow these steps to search a library:
1. Choose Show Subset from a library pane’s palette menu or click the
Show Library Subset button at the bottom of the pane.
2. Decide whether to search the entire library or only the items currently
displayed in the page and select the appropriate radio button.
118
Part II: Document Essentials 

3. In the Parameters area, choose the Item Information category you
want to search.
Your choices are Item Name, Creation Date, Object Type, and Description.
4. From the next pop-up menu, choose Contains if you intend to search
for text contained in the chosen category; choose Doesn’t Contain if
you want to exclude items that contain the text you specify.
5. In the Parameter’s area text-entry field, type the word or phrase you
want to search for (if you selected Contains in Step 4) or exclude (if
you selected Doesn’t Contain).
6. Add more search criteria by clicking the More Choices button; reduce
the number of search criteria by clicking Fewer Choices.
You can create up to five levels of search criteria. If you select two or
more levels of search criteria, you will be able to choose whether to dis-
play items that match all search criteria (by selecting Match All) or to
display items that match any of the search criteria (by selecting Match
Any One).
7. Click OK to conduct the search and close the dialog box.
The library items that match the search criteria are displayed in the pane
(unless no items matched the search criteria). To display all items after con-
ducting a search, choose Show All from the Library pane’s palette menu.
Deleting items from a library
To delete a library item, drag its icon to the Delete Library item (trashcan icon)
at the bottom of the pane or select the item and then choose Delete Item(s)
from the library pane’s palette menu. You can select a range of items by click-
ing the first one and then Shift+clicking the last one. You can select multiple,
noncontiguous items by holding down the Ô or Ctrl key and clicking each icon.
Copying library items onto document pages
Once an item is in a library, you can place copies of that library item into any
document or into another library. To place a copy of a library item onto the
currently displayed document page, drag the item’s icon from the library
pane onto the page. As you drag, the outline of the library item is displayed.
Release the mouse button when the outline of the item is positioned where
you want it to end up. You can also place a library item onto a document by
clicking its icon and then choosing Place Item(s).
Copy an item from one library to another by dragging its icon from the
source library pane onto the target library pane. To move (rather than copy)
an item from one library to another, hold down the Option or Alt key when
dragging and dropping an item between libraries.

Working with Books
In This Chapter

 Numbering pages and sections
 Generating tables of contents and indexes
 Adding footnotes
N
ot only is InDesign useful for short documents like ads and newsletters,
but it’s also able to comfortably handle longer, multi-chapter documents.
The most common and easiest way to build longer documents, especially
those created by more than one author or contributor, is to create multiple
InDesign documents and then assemble them into a larger book.
If you follow the advice in this chapter, you can use the InDesign Book feature
to manage document files, update page numbers across chapters, and main-
tain consistency throughout the book. You can also use the Table of Contents
feature to create and update tables of contents (TOCs). And we also show
you how to add an index using InDesign’s Index feature.
Managing Chapters and Books
A book in InDesign is a specific type of file that you create to track chapters
or multiple documents that make up the book. Using InDesign’s book panes,
you can add, open and edit, rearrange, and print chapters of the book. The
book palette is nice for workgroups because multiple users can open the
same book and access different chapters; it also works well if you are a single
user working on a multi-chapter book.
InDesign’s Book feature lets you:
 See who is working on each chapter and when.
 Update paragraph styles, character styles, object styles, colors, and
TOC styles across documents for consistency.
 Update page numbers across multiple documents.

 Create a table of contents and an index for multiple documents.
 Easily print all the chapters of a book.
Creating a new book
To create a new book, choose File➪New➪Book. The New Book dialog box lets
you specify a location for the book and give it a name. Click Open to create
and open the book.
Opening and closing a book
Open an existing book by using the File➪Open command (Ô+O or Ctrl+O).
The book will appear in its own pane in the palette (the palette has no title
and will appear automatically if you open a book when no other books are
open). You can also double-click a book’s icon to open it.
To close a book’s pane, and any book documents that are in it, simply click
its close box.
Adding chapters to books
A new book pane is empty — you need to add chapter documents to fill it up.
To do this, click the Add Document button — the + button on the bottom-
right of the book’s pane (see Figure 9-1) — or use the Add Document option
in the book pane’s palette menu. Use the Add Chapter dialog box to locate
and select the first chapter you want to add. Click the Add button to make
this the first chapter in the book. Repeat this process to add to the book all
the chapters you have ready (you can also add more later).
Chapters are listed in the book pane in the order in which you add them. You
may want to rearrange them to match the actual order of the book project —
especially if you are numbering the book automatically from start to finish,
since InDesign will number them based on their order in the book pane. To
rearrange the relative position of chapters, just click and drag chapter names
up or down within the pane to put them in the desired order.
Working on chapters
To work on a chapter in a book, first open the book and then double-click the
chapter name in the book’s pane. The chapter opens in InDesign just like any
other InDesign document. For a chapter to be opened, it must be Available,
as discussed in the next section. When you finish editing a chapter, save and
close it as usual.
122
Part II: Document Essentials 

Replace an existing chapter with another document by selecting the chapter
in the book pane and choosing Replace Document from the palette menu.
Navigate to a new document, select it, and click the Open button. InDesign
will replace the selected chapter with the new document.
Delete chapters from a book by choosing Remove Document from the palette
menu or by clicking the Remove Document button (the – icon) from the
bottom of the pane.
InDesign offers three other menu options in the palette menu that come in
handy for managing a book: You can save books by choosing Save Book, save
to a new name by choosing Save Book As, and close the book by choosing
Close Book (any changes to the book are not saved, though a warning box
gives you the chance to save any unsaved changes).
Finding out about chapter status
When you use the book palette in a workgroup, it provides helpful status
reports about each chapter. The statuses are:
 Available: The chapter can be opened, edited, or printed. Only one user
at a time can open a chapter.
 Open: You have the chapter open and can edit it or print it. Nobody else
can open the chapter at this time.

Chapter 9: Working with Books

 In Use: Another user has the chapter open. In this case, you cannot edit
or open the chapter.
 Modified: The chapter has been changed since the last time you opened
the book palette. Simply click the book pane to update it.
 Missing: The chapter’s file has been moved since it was added to the
book. Double-click the chapter name to open a Find File dialog box and
locate it.
The Document Information menu option in the book pane’s palette menu pro-
vides useful information. When you select a chapter and choose this option,
you can see the file’s modification date, location, and page range, and you
can replace the chapter with a different document.
Taking advantage of style sources
The first chapter you add to the book is, by default, the style source. You can
tell which chapter is the style source by the icon to the left of the chapter
name. In most cases, you want the text formatting, object styles, colors, and
so on to remain the same from chapter to chapter. The style source in an
InDesign book defines the styles and swatches that are common to all the
chapters in the book. When you use the Synchronize feature, InDesign makes
sure that the paragraph styles, character styles, object styles, trap presets,
TOC styles, and swatches in each chapter in the book match those in the
style source.
If you decide to make a different chapter the style source, all you need to do
is (in the book pane) click in the column to the left of that chapter’s filename.
This moves the icon indicating the style source to that chapter.
Synchronizing formatting
When formatting is synchronized, chapters maintain a consistent appear-
ance. The book pane includes a Synchronize button, as well as a
Synchronize Selected Documents or Synchronize Book menu item in the
palette menu. Before you synchronize, make sure that you’re happy with
the styles you’ve established in the style source and then follow these steps
to synchronize:
1. Be sure that all chapters are available for editing.
2. Choose the style source (the document that contains the styles you
want to use throughout the book) by clicking the box to the left of the
source chapter so that the style-source icon appears.
124
Part II: Document Essentials 

3. Choose Synchronize Options from the book pane’s palette menu,
which opens a dialog box.
Make sure that every type of item you want to synchronize — Object
Styles, TOC Style, Character Styles, Paragraph Styles, Trap Presets, and
Swatches — is checked. You can click All Styles to ensure that all are
synchronized across a book’s chapters.
4. Select the chapters you want to synchronize and either click the
Synchronize button or choose Synchronize Selected Documents from
the palette menu.
If no chapters are selected, InDesign assumes you want to synchronize
all chapters; the menu option Synchronize Book will appear in the
palette menu rather than Synchronize Selected Documents in that case.
5. Compare the styles (character, paragraph, object, and TOC), swatches
(color, tint, and gradient), and trap styles in the style source to those
in each chapter.
If anything is different, the information in each chapter will be updated
to match the style source. If someone changed the typeface in a para-
graph style in a chapter, it will revert to the typeface specified in the
style source. If anything is missing from a chapter — for example, if you
just added a swatch to the style source but not to other chapters — that
information is added to each chapter.
By using the Synchronize feature, you give each chapter the same basic set of
styles and swatches as the style source, although you can still add more of
these specifications to individual chapters. Keep in mind that synchronizing
doesn’t repair the formatting fiascos that can happen when multiple users
work on the same book. Be sure everyone who needs to know the standards
for the design has access, ahead of time, to that information.
Printing chapters and books
Using the book pane, you can print any chapters with the status of Available
or Open. Here’s how:
1. To print the entire book, make sure no chapters are selected. To print
a contiguous range of chapters, Shift+click the first and last chapters
that you want to print. To print noncontiguous chapters, Ô+click or
Ctrl+click the chapters to select them.
2. Click the Print Book button or choose Print Book or Print Selected
Documents in the book pane’s palette menu (the option will depend
on whether chapters are selected in the book pane).
The standard InDesign Print dialog box opens. Note that the option to
choose all pages or a range of pages is grayed out — you must print all
chapters in the selected chapters.
125
Chapter 9: Working with Books

3. Make any adjustments in the Print dialog box.
4. Click Print to print the chapters.
You can also output a book to PDF by using the Export Book to PDF or Export
Selected Documents to PDF menu items in the palette menu. These menu
items work like their equivalent Print versions.
Working with sections in chapters
Section-based page numbering is fairly common in long documents because
it lets you, for example, restart page numbering in each new section, such as
4.1, 4.2, and so on. Creating a section start is also the only way to start a doc-
ument on a left-facing page. InDesign gives you two choices for numbering
book pages: You can let the book pane number pages consecutively from one
chapter to the next, or you can add sections of page numbers, which carry
through the book until you start a new section.
Numbering pages consecutively
If your book chapters don’t have sections, use consecutive page numbering,
in which the first page number of a chapter follows the last page number of
the previous chapter (for example, one chapter ends on page 224, and the
next chapter starts on page 225).
Consecutive page numbering is applied by default in InDesign. If for some
reason a document resets its numbering, go to that document, open the
Numbering & Section options dialog box (choose Numbering & Section
Options in the Pages pane’s palette menu), and select Automatic Page
Numbering.
Consecutive page numbering works as follows:
 Whenever you add a chapter that contains no sections, or that has sec-
tion numbering set to Automatic Page Numbering, InDesign numbers
pages consecutively throughout the book.
 As you add and delete pages from chapters, InDesign updates all the
page numbers in the chapters that follow.
 You can force InDesign to renumber all the pages by choosing
Repaginate from the book pane’s palette menu — this is handy if you
changed section options in some chapters and want the book to see
those changes.
Numbering pages with sections
When chapters you add to books already contain sections of page numbers
(implemented through the Numbering & Section dialog box, which you access
via the Numbering & Section Options menu option in the Pages pane’s palette
126
Part II: Document Essentials 

menu), section page numbering overrides the book’s consecutive page num-
bering. The section page numbering carries through chapters of the book until
InDesign encounters a new section start. So if one chapter ends on page iv, the
next chapter starts on page v unless you start a new section for that chapter.
For more in-depth information about section numbering, see Chapter 6.
Creating Tables of Contents
A table of contents (TOC) is useful in a long document because it helps readers
locate information quickly. A TOC is simply a list of paragraphs that are format-
ted with the same styles. This means that if you want to use the Table of
Contents feature, you have to use paragraph styles. Not only do styles guaran-
tee consistent formatting, they also tell InDesign what text you want to include
in your TOC.
After you’ve created a book (or even a single document), InDesign can build a
table of contents by scanning pages for the paragraph styles you specify. For
example, if you create a book, you might use paragraph styles named Chapter
Title, Section, and Subsection. Using the Table of Contents feature, InDesign
can generate a table of contents that includes all three levels.
TOC styles manage the text that you want in a table of contents, the order in
which it appears, how page numbers are added, and how the various TOC
elements are formatted. To create a TOC style, choose Layout➪Table of
Contents Styles, which opens the dialog box shown in Figure 9-2.
In the Table of Contents Styles dialog box, click New to create a new TOC
style. You can also edit an existing TOC style via the Edit button, delete one
via the Delete button, and import one from another InDesign document via
the Load button.
Figure 9-2:
The Table of
Contents
Styles
dialog box.
127
Chapter 9: Working with Books

Here’s how to create a TOC style after clicking the New button:
1. Enter a name for the TOC style in the TOC Style field (shown in 
Figure 9-3).
The default is TOC Style 1.
2. In the Title field, enter a heading for the TOC.
This text appears in your table of contents.
If you don’t want a title, leave the Title field blank, but note that you still
get an empty paragraph at the top of your TOC for this title. You can
always delete that paragraph.
3. Use the Style pop-up menu to choose the paragraph style that this title
will have.
4. In the Styles in Table of Contents section, click a paragraph style that
you want to appear in your TOC from the Other Styles list at right.
For example, you might click Chapter Title.
5. Click<<Add to add it to the Include Paragraph Styles list at left. (Select
a style from the Include Paragraph Styles section and click Remove>>
to remove any paragraph styles you don’t want to be used in the
TOC.)
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 until you have added all of the paragraph styles
that you want to include in the TOC.
7. Use the Entry Style pop-up menu to select a TOC level and then
choose the paragraph formatting for that style.
If the Entry Style, Page Number, and other options don’t display, click
the More Options button to see them.
Figure 9-3:
The Table of
Contents
dialog box.
128
Part II: Document Essentials 

• Use the Page Number pop-up menu to determine how page num-
bers are handled: After Entry, Before Entry, and No Page Number. If
you want the page numbers to have a character style applied,
choose that style from the Style pop-up menu to the right of the
Page Number pop-up menu.
• Use the Between Entry and Number field and pop-up menu to
choose what appears between the TOC text and the page number.
You can enter any characters you want; use the pop-up menu to
select special characters such as bullets and tabs. In most cases,
you should select a tab; the paragraph style selected earlier for the
TOC entry includes leader information, such as having a string of
periods between the text and the number. You can also apply a
character style to the characters between the text and the page
numbers via the Style pop-up menu at right.
• To sort entries at this level alphabetically, such as for a list of prod-
ucts in a brochure, select the Sort Entries in Alphabetical Order
check box.
• To change the level of the current TOC entry, use the Level pop-up
menu. If you change the level of entries, InDesign will correctly sort
them when it creates the TOC, even if the levels seem out of order
in the Include Paragraph Styles list.
• In the Options section of the dialog box, choose the appropriate
options. Check Create PDF Bookmarks if you’re exporting the docu-
ment to PDF format and want the PDF TOC file to have bookmarks
(a clickable set of TOC links). Check Run-in if you want all entries
at the same level to be in one paragraph. (This is not common for
TOCs but is used in indexes and lists of figures.) Check Replace
Existing Table of Contents if you want InDesign to automatically
replace an existing TOC if the TOC style is changed. Check Include
Text on Hidden Layers if you want text on hidden layers to be
included in the TOC. Finally, check Include Book Documents if you
have a book open and want InDesign to generate a TOC based on
all chapters in that book. (InDesign will show the current open
book’s name.)
8. Continue this process for each paragraph style whose text should be
in the TOC.
Note that the order in which you add these styles determines the initial
levels: The first paragraph style added is level 1; the second is level 2,
and so on. But you can change the order by changing the Level setting,
as described earlier.
To make changes to a TOC style, go to the Edit Table of Contents Style dialog
box. Choose Layout➪Table of Contents Styles, select the TOC style to edit,
and click Edit.
129
Chapter 9: Working with Books

With a TOC style in place and your document properly formatted with the
paragraph styles that the TOC style will look for when generating a TOC,
you’re ready to have InDesign create the actual TOC for you.
To generate a TOC, choose Layout➪Table of Contents. You get a dialog box
that is identical to the Table of Contents dialog box shown in Figure 9-4. In
this dialog box, you can make changes to the TOC style settings. (If you want
to save those TOC style changes, be sure to click the Save Style button.)
Then click OK to have InDesign generate the TOC. You might also get a dialog
box asking whether you want to include items in overset text (text that didn’t
fit in your document after you placed it) in your TOC. It may take a minute or
two for the program to generate the TOC. (See Chapter 15 for more details on
overset text.)
Be sure you allow enough space (a single text frame, a series of linked text
frames, or one or more empty pages) for the TOC before generating a final
TOC because if you end up adding or deleting pages based on the TOC
length, the TOC will display the old page numbers. To update page number-
ing after flowing a TOC, simply rebuild the TOC by selecting the text frame
holding the TOC and then choosing Layout➪Update Table of Contents.
If you select a text frame, InDesign will place the TOC text in it when you gen-
erate the TOC. If you don’t select a text frame, you see the familiar loaded-
text icon (the paragraph pointer) that you see when you place a text file.
Click a text frame to insert the TOC text in that frame or click in an empty
part of your document to create a text frame in which the TOC text will flow.
The feature that creates TOCs is actually a list generator, and you can use it
to create other kinds of lists. Basically, anything that is tagged with a para-
graph style can be used to create a list. For example, if your figure captions
all use their own paragraph style, you can generate a list of figures by creat-
ing a TOC style that includes just the Caption Title paragraph style. An
InDesign document can have more than one TOC, so you can include multiple
lists in your document.
Creating Indexes
When trying to locate information in a book, nothing is as wonderful as a
good index. Once upon a time, book indexing was a labor-intensive process
involving piles of index cards. InDesign makes indexing much easier, while
still allowing you to make key decisions about how the index is formatted.
But be warned: Indexing is complicated business and is, by and large, an
expert feature. So we cover just the basics here.
130
Part II: Document Essentials 

Choosing an indexing style
Before you begin indexing your document, ask yourself the following questions:
 Do you want to initial-cap all levels of all entries, or do you just want
sentence case?
 Should index headings appear in boldface?
 What type of punctuation will you use in your index?
 Will you capitalize secondary entries in the index?
 Should the index be nested or run-in style? (A nested index is an
indented list, with each entry on its own line. A run-in index puts all
related entries in one paragraph, separated by semicolons.)
After you make these decisions, it’s a good idea to make a small dummy index.
From the dummy, create a master page for index pages, paragraph styles for
index headings (the letters A, B, C, and so on), paragraph styles for each level
of the index (including indents as appropriate), and character styles for any
special formatting you want on page numbers or cross-reference text. InDesign
doesn’t do any of this for you.
Inside the Index pane
When you want to index a chapter or document, open the Index pane by
choosing Window➪Type & Tables➪Index or by pressing Shift+F8. Use this
pane to add words to the index in up to four indent levels, edit or delete index
entries, or create cross-references. The Index pane is shown in Figure 9-4.
Figure 9-4:
The Index
pane and its
palette
menu.
131
Chapter 9: Working with Books

Two radio buttons appear at the top of the Index pane: Reference and Topic.
You use Reference mode to add and edit entries from selected text. If you’re
creating an index in a book, be sure to click the Book check box as well in the
Index pane. (Although it is a well-intentioned feature meant to help standard-
ize index entries, the Topic mode’s use is not intuitive, and most indexers
simply ignore it and add entries manually from selected text or type phrases
into the Index pane in Reference mode. You should ignore it, too.)
Select the Book check box if you are creating an index for multiple chapters in
a book. You must have a book open for this option to be available. If you have
a book open and do not select the Book box, the index is saved with the cur-
rent document and not opened when you open other chapters of the book.
Adding index items via the Index pane
To add entries to the index, be sure the Type tool is active, then choose New
Page Reference from the Index pane’s palette menu, or press Ô+U or Ctrl+U,
to get the dialog box shown in Figure 9-5.
If the Type tool is not active when you open the dialog box, the palette menu
option will be called New Cross-Reference instead, letting you add a cross-
reference entry to the index. The resulting New Cross-Reference dialog box
is identical to the New Page Reference dialog box, except the various
options default to ones appropriate for a cross-reference.
Here’s how the controls work:
 If you selected text first in your document, the text is entered automati-
cally into Topic Level 1. Otherwise, type in the text that you want to add
to the index. In Figure 9-5, you can see that we typed keyboard. The text
will be added to the Topic list and to the list of index entries.
Figure 9-5:
The New
Page
Reference
dialog box.
132
Part II: Document Essentials 

 You can enter text that controls how the entry is sorted in the Sort By
column. For example, if the selected text you’re indexing is The A-Team,
but you want it sorted as if it were A-Team, The (so it appears with the A
entries in the index), enter A-Team, The in the Sorted By column.
 If you want a more complex index, you might want to use some or all of
the four possible entry levels. You may want an index entry to appear
under a higher-level topic. For example, you may want Border Collies to
appear in the index under Herding Dogs, in which case you would enter
Herding Dogs the Topic Level 1 field and Border Collies in the Topic
Level 2 field. 
 Use the Type pop-up menu, shown in Figure 9-7, to determine the page
entries for the index entry. For instance, if you select To End of Section,
the page numbers for the selected text in the index will cover the range
from the index entry to the end of the section it is in.
 To add just the selected text as an index entry, click Add. (If no text is
selected, the text will be added to the Topic list, but no index entry will
appear for the it.) To add all occurrences of the text in the book, click
Add All.
 To change previously defined index entries, select an entry and then
choose Page Reference Options in the Index pane’s palette menu.
 At the bottom of the New Page Reference dialog box is a list of letters as
well as the entry Symbols (where entries that begin with numbers and
other non-letter characters will be grouped in the index). You can scroll
through this list of headings to see what is already in the index under each
letter. Although you might think clicking a letter would force the current
index entry to appear in that letter’s section of the index, it does not.
InDesign CS2 changes how multi-paragraph text selections are indexed. InDesign
CS2 now indexes each paragraph in that selection as separate entries.
To quickly add a word or text selection to an index, highlight the text and
press Ô+U or Ctrl+U to add the text to the New Page Reference dialog box. To
index a word without opening that dialog box, just press Option+Shift+Ô+[ or
Ctrl+Alt+Shift+[. This adds the text to the index using the index’s default set-
tings. (You can always edit them later.) And to enter an index entry as a
proper name (last name, first name), use the shortcut Option+Shift+Ô+] or
Ctrl+Alt+Shift+].
Polishing and generating the index
The Index pane’s palette menu has several options useful for generating and
fine-tuning an index:
 Duplicate Topic lets you duplicate a topic entry so you can use the set-
tings from one entry without having to re-enter those settings in a new
entry.
133
Chapter 9: Working with Books

 Delete Topic removes a topic (and any associated entries) from the index.
 Import Topics lets you import topic lists from other InDesign documents.
 Go to Selected Marker causes InDesign to jump to the text that contains
the selected index entry in the Index pane.
 Topic Options lets you edit the Level and Sort By settings for topic
entries; these affect all index entries that use them.
 Capitalize lets you standardize the capitalization of topic entries — you
can choose Selected Topic, Selected Topic and All Subtopics, All Level 1
Topics, and All Topics.
 Update Preview updates the index entries in the Index pane to reflect
page-number changes, new occurrences of index text occurrences, and
deleted occurrences of indexed text.
 Generate Index creates the index via the dialog box shown in Figure 9-6.
In this dialog box, you specify the following: title for the index, the para-
graph style sheet for that title, whether a selected index is replaced with
the new one, whether an entire book is indexed, whether text on hidden
layers is indexed, whether the index is nested or run-in, whether empty
index headings and sections are included, what paragraph styles are
applied to each level of index entry, what character styles are applied to
different portions of index entries, and which characters will be used as
separators within index entries. (Click the More Options button to see
the nested/run-in and later options.) After you generate an index, you
get the standard InDesign load-text icon (the paragraph icon); click an
existing text frame into which you want to flow the index, or click any-
where else in a document to have InDesign create the text frame for you
and flow the index text into it.

Part II: Document Essentials 

Adding Footnotes
Many books, including academic and technical documents, use footnotes.
InDesign lets you add footnotes to your book with very little fuss.
You can import footnotes from Microsoft Word files, or you can add footnotes
directly in InDesign. With the text-insertion pointer in your text where you
want the footnote marker to appear, choose Type➪Insert Footnote to add a
footnote to the bottom of the column that contains the footnote marker, as
Figure 9-7 shows. You need to manually enter the text that will go with each
numbered footnote, but InDesign updates the footnote numbering as you add
and delete footnotes.
You cannot insert footnotes into tables. But you can simulate footnotes by
adding a superscripted footnote character in the table text and typing your
footnote text below the table — note this “footnote” is not linked to the text,
will not renumber automatically as a real footnote would, and cannot be for-
matted with InDesign’s footnote formatting controls.
You can control much of the appearance of footnotes by choosing Type➪
Document Footnote Options to open the Footnote Options dialog box, shown
in Figure 9-8.
Figure 9-7:
Inserting a

135
Chapter 9: Working with Books

The Numbering and Formatting pane controls the formatting of the footnote
text and footnote character in the current InDesign document. The Layout
pane controls the placement of the footnote relative to the rest of the 
document.
To change these settings for future documents, open the dialog box while no
document is open and set your new defaults.

In this part . . .
T
he rubber really hits the road when you’ve got your
basic layout structure in place. Now you can focus on
the meat of your documents: the objects that contain your
text and graphics. It’s amazing all the things you can do to
objects, such as rotate them, color them, and apply spe-
cial effects like drop shadows. And you can even save a lot
of these settings so you can apply them consistently to
other objects later — a real timesaver that also ensures
quality results. You’ll learn all that and more in this part.
Note that you can apply most of these effects to objects
whether or not they already contain their graphics and
text — so if you’re a really structured kind of person,
you’ll probably create your basic object containers first
and apply your effects to them, then bring in the text and
graphics. But if you’re more free-form in your approach,
you’ll likely bring in all your text and graphics, then start
arranging the objects that contain them to produce your
final layout. That’s fine; you’d just apply the techniques
here while doing so.

Chapter 10
Adding Frames, Lines, and Colors
In This Chapter
 Using frames and shapes
 Creating lines
 Creating and applying colors, tints, and gradients
T
he fundamental components of any layout are its objects. An object is a
container that can (but doesn’t have to) hold text or graphics, as well as
display attributes such as color, strokes, and gradients. This chapter explains
how to create these building blocks — frames, shapes, and lines — as well as
the colors, gradients, and tints you can apply to them.
Creating Frames and Shapes
When an object contains an imported graphic or text, or if an object is created
as a placeholder for a graphic or text, it’s referred to as a frame. Otherwise, it
is called a shape.
Designing pages in InDesign is largely a matter of creating and modifying
frames and shapes, as well as modifying the text and graphics the frames
contain.
As Figure 10-1 shows, the Tools palette contains several tools for creating
both shapes and frames:
 The Rectangle, Ellipse, and Polygon shape tools (the Ellipse and Polygon
tools are available through the pop-up menu that appears if you click
and hold on the Rectangle tool).
 The Rectangle, Ellipse, and Polygon frame tools (the Ellipse and Polygon
frame tools are available through the pop-up menu that appears if you
click and hold on the Rectangle frame tool).
 The Type tool (which can create rectangular text frames).

Here’s how to create a frame (or shape):
1. Select the desired tool from the Tools palette.
For the Polygon and Polygon Frame tools, you can set the shape and
number of sides by double-clicking the tool and then using the dialog
box that appears. Figure 10-2 shows that dialog box.
2. Move the mouse pointer anywhere within the currently displayed
page or on the pasteboard.
3. Click and drag in any direction.
As you drag, a crosshair pointer appears in the corner opposite your
starting point; a colored rectangle indicates the boundary of the frame.
(The color will be blue for objects on the default layer; objects on other
layers will have that layer’s color. See Chapter 7 for more on layers.) You
can look at the width and height values displayed in the Control palette
Figure 10-2:

or the Transform pane as you drag to help you get the size you want.
Holding down the Shift key as you drag limits the tool to creating a
frame or shape within a square bounding box.
4. When the frame is the size and shape you want, release the mouse
button.
Pretty easy, huh? At this point, you can begin typing in the frame, paste text
or a graphic into it, or import a text or a graphics file, as Chapters 14 and 19
explain.
If you create a text frame with the Type tool, be sure not to click in an exist-
ing text frame when your intention is to create a new one. If you click within
an existing frame when the Type tool is selected, the flashing cursor appears,
and InDesign thinks you want to type text.
When any of the frame-creation tools is selected, you can create as many new
frames as you want. Simply keep clicking, dragging, and releasing. After you
create a graphics frame, you can modify it (without changing tools) by adding
a border or a colored background or by applying any of the effects — such as
rotation, shear, and scale — in the Control palette or Transform pane. You
can also move or resize a graphics frame, but you have to switch to the
Selection tool or the Direct Selection tool to do so. Chapter 12 explains how
to resize, move, delete, and otherwise manipulate frames and other objects.
Drawing a Straight Line
Although they’re not as flashy or versatile as shapes and frames, lines can
serve many useful purposes in well-designed pages. For example, you can use
plain ol’ vertical rules to separate columns of text in a multicolumn page or
the rows and columns of data in a table. Dashed lines are useful for indicating
141
Chapter 10: Adding Frames, Lines, and Colors
Frames versus shapes: No real difference
InDesign has tools that let you create both shapes
and frames. But there’s really no difference
between shapes and frames other than how they
appear onscreen — frames have an X through
them, while shapes don’t. (That X in frames 
doesn’t print, of course, it’s just a visual indicator
of a frame.) Both frames and shapes can contain
text or graphics, and you can apply colors and
other effects to both frames and shapes.
So don’t worry about whether you create frames
or shapes; in the end, they do the same things.
So if we tell you to use the Ellipse Frame tool and
you choose the Ellipse tool, for example, don’t
worry. Both tools do the same thing. And any-
thing we say relating to frames also applies to
shapes — unless, of course, we say otherwise.

folds and cut lines on brochures and coupons. And lines with arrowheads are
handy if you have to create a map or a technical illustration.
InDesign lets you create straight lines with the Line tool and zigzag lines,
curved lines, and free-form shapes with the Pen tool. In this chapter, we keep
things simple and limit the discussion to the Line tool. See Chapter 21 for the
fancy stuff.
Follow these steps to draw a straight line:
1. Select the Line tool. (Figure 10-1 shows the Line tool.)
2. Move the pointer anywhere within the currently displayed page or on
the pasteboard.
3. Click and drag the mouse in any direction.
As you drag, a thin, blue line appears from the point where you first
clicked to the current position of the cross-hair pointer. Holding down
the Shift key as you drag constrains the line to a horizontal, vertical, or
45-degree diagonal line.
4. When the line is the length and angle you want, release the mouse
button.
Don’t worry too much about being precise when you create a line. You
can always go back later and fine-tune it.
When you release the mouse button after creating a line, the line is active. As
illustrated in Figure 10-3, if the Selection tool was previously selected, the line
appears within a rectangular bounding box, which contains eight resizing
handles. If the Direct Selection tool was previously selected, moveable
anchor points appear at the ends of the line. In either case, you have to
choose the right tool if you want to change the shape or size of the bounding
box or the line:
 The Selection tool lets you change the shape of the line’s bounding box
(which also changes the angle and length of the line) by dragging any of
the resizing handles.
 The Direct Selection tool lets you change the length and angle of the line
itself by moving anchor points on the frame.
When you create a line, it takes on the characteristics specified in the Stroke
pane (Window➪Stroke or F10). When you first open a document, the default
line width is 1 point. If you want to change the appearance of your lines,
double-click the Line tool and adjust the Weight setting in the Stroke pane
that appears. If you make this adjustment when no document is open, all new
documents will use the new line settings.
142
Part III: Object Essentials 

As long as the Line tool is selected, you can create as many new lines as you
want. Simply keep clicking, dragging, and releasing. After you create a line, you
can modify it (without changing tools) by changing any of the attributes —
including weight, style, and start/end shapes — in the Stroke pane. Chapter 12
covers strokes in more detail.

Chapter 10: Adding Frames, Lines, and Colors

Defining Colors, Tints, and Gradients
The other major element in your layout that needs to be defined is the set of
colors you plan to use, including any frequently used tints and gradients
(blends).
InDesign comes with only a few predefined colors: [Black], [registration]
(black on each negative for the printing press), [paper] (white), [none]
(transparent), cyan, magenta, yellow, red, green, and blue. You likely want to
add a few of your own. InDesign uses brackets around the names of swatches
that cannot be edited or deleted.
Before you can apply any colors — whether to bitmap images or to layout
elements such as strokes, text, frames, and shapes — you must first define
the colors, which you do in the Swatches pane (Window➪Swatches or F5).
You can also import colors from other Adobe programs and from some color
images.
The ability to select a color by double-clicking the Fill or Stroke button is new
to InDesign CS2.
No matter how you define colors, you have a couple of decisions to make first:
 Do you want to create your own color by mixing basic colors like red,
green, and blue (called RGB and typically used for screen display), or
cyan, yellow, magenta, and black (called CMYK, or process colors, and
typically used for printing presses)?
 Do you want to use a color from an ink maker like Pantone or Toyo?
These colors — called spot colors — are typically used as an extra ink on
your document but can also be converted to the standard four-process
colors and so are handy when you know the color you want when you
see it.
All of the color-creation tools in InDesign CS2 support both process and spot
colors, and all have access to the predefined colors like Pantone and Toyo as
well as to the free-form color pickers for mixing CMYK or RGB colors. If you
plan to print the color on its own plate, you need to use a predefined color so
you know the printer can reproduce it. If you plan to color-separate a color
into the four CMYK plates, then it doesn’t matter whether you use a prede-
fined color or make one of your own. One advantage to using a predefined
color is that it’s easy to tell other designers what the color is; another is that
you will get very close matches if you start with a predefined color and then
end up having it color-separated in some documents and kept as a spot color
in others.
144
Part III: Object Essentials 

Creating colors
All colors in the Swatches pane receive a unique name and are tracked by
InDesign. That means each color is available to be used on any object in your
document, with no risk of having slightly different variants. Plus, you can
modify a swatch and ensure that all objects using that swatch are updated.
You can also delete a swatch and tell InDesign which color to use in its place.
Furthermore, when you print, you have control over how each color is han-
dled (whether it is printed to its own plate, whether it is printed at all, and
whether there should be any adjustments to its ink density or screening
angle). Figure 10-4 shows the Swatches pane.
If no document is open when you create, edit, or delete colors, the new color
palette becomes the default for all future documents.
To create your own color, go to the Swatches pane and select New Color
Swatch from the palette menu. The New Color Swatch dialog box shown in
Figure 10-5 appears. Now follow these steps:
1. In the Swatch Name field, give your color a name that describes it,
such as Lemon Yellow or Blood Red.
You can also select the Name with Color Value option, which uses the
color values to make up the color name, as done for the colors under
[Registration] in Figure 10-4. This option is the default setting for CMYK,
RGB, and LAB colors; it is not available for swatch-based colors such as
Pantone.

2. In the Color Type pop-up menu, choose from Process or Spot.
The difference between process colors and spot colors is discussed
later in this chapter; leave the color type at Process if you’re not sure.
3. In the Color Mode pop-up menu, choose the mixing system or swatch
library (both are considered to be color models) you will use:
• CMYK: Cyan, magenta, yellow, and black are the colors used in pro-
fessional printing presses and many color printers.
• RGB: Red, green, and blue are the colors used on a computer moni-
tor, for CD-based or Web-based documents, and for some color
printers.
• LAB: Luminosity, A axis, B axis, is a way of defining colors created
by the international standards group Commission Internationale de
l’Éclairage (the CIE, which translates to International Commission
on Illumination in English).
• A swatch-based model: Sets of premixed colors from various ven-
dors, including ANPA, DIC, Focoltone, HKS, Pantone, Toyo Ink, and
Trumatch for print documents, as well as a Web-specific set and
sets specific to Windows and the Mac OS for on-screen documents.
• Other Library: InDesign also has the Other Library from which you
can select any swatch library file in Adobe Illustrator format.
4. For the CMYK, RGB, and LAB models, use the sliders to create your
new color. (A preview appears in the box on the left.) For the swatch-
based models, scroll through the lists of colors and select one.
5. If you want to create multiple colors, click Add after each color defini-
tion and then click Done when you’re finished. To create just one
color, click OK instead of Add. You can also click Cancel to abort the cur-
rent color definition.
The most popular swatch libraries used by North American professional pub-
lishers are those from Pantone, whose Pantone Matching System (PMS) is the
de facto standard for most publishers in specifying spot-color inks. The
Pantone swatch libraries come in several variations, of which InDesign
includes the following four:
 Pantone Process Coated: Use this library when you color-separate
Pantone colors and your printer uses the standard Pantone-brand
process-color inks. (These colors will reproduce reliably when color-
separated, while the other Pantone swatch libraries’ colors often will not.)
 Pantone Solid Coated: Use this library when your printer will use actual
Pantone inks (as spot colors) when printing to coated paper stock.
 Pantone Solid Matte: Use this library when your printer will use actual
Pantone inks (as spot colors) when printing to matte-finished paper stock.
 Pantone Solid Uncoated: Use this library when your printer will use actual
Pantone inks (as spot colors) when printing to uncoated paper stock.
146
Part III: Object Essentials 

Color swatches based on the CMYK colors — such as Focoltone, Pantone
Process, and Trumatch — will accurately color-separate and, thus, print
accurately on a printing press because a printing press uses the CMYK
colors. Other swatches’ colors often do not color-separate accurately
because they are supposed to represent special inks that may have added
elements like metals and clays designed to give metallic or pastel appear-
ances that simply can’t be replicated by combining cyan, magenta, yellow,
and black. Similarly, some colors (like several hues of orange and green) can’t
be accurately created using the CMYK colors.
Creating tints
A tint is a shade of a color. InDesign lets you create such tints as separate
color swatches, so they’re easy to use for multiple items. The process is easy:
1. In the Swatches pane, select a color from which you want to create a tint.
2. Using the Swatches pane’s palette menu, select New Tint Swatch.
The New Tint Swatch dialog box, shown in Figure 10-6, appears.

Part III: Object Essentials 
The bad way to create colors
Many people try to use the Color pane (Window➪
Color or F6) to define colors, which can be a
mistake. At first, you might not realize that you
can create colors from the Color pane. It shows
a gradation of the last color used and lets you
change the tint for that color on the current
object. But if you go to the palette menu and
choose a color model (RGB, CMYK, or LAB), you
get a set of mixing controls.
So what’s the problem? Colors created through
the Color pane won’t appear in your Swatches
pane, so they can’t be used for other objects.
Called unnamed colors because they don’t
appear anywhere, these can be dangerous for
publishers. (Adobe added them to InDesign to be
consistent with how Illustrator defines colors —
a foolish consistency.)
Fortunately, there is a way to prevent unnamed
colors: If you go to the Color pane and modify a
color without thinking about it, choose Add to
Swatches from the palette menu to add the
modified color to the Swatches pane. Of course,
if you forget to do this, you have an unnamed
color, so it’s best to think Swatches pane when
you think about adding or editing colors instead
of the more obvious Color pane. If you do forget,
you can use the Add Unnamed Colors menu
item in the Swatches pane’s palette menu to
add the colors to the Swatches pane.
Similarly, don’t use this new InDesign CS2 feature:
the ability to create colors by double-clicking the
Stroke and Fill buttons on the Tools palette, using
a Photoshop-style color picker. As with colors
created in the Color pane, you can rectify this sin
by adding any colors created this way to the
Swatches pane by using the Add Unnamed Colors
menu item. Otherwise, you run the same risk as
creating colors through the Color pane.

4. Click Add to create another tint from the same base color, and then
click OK when you’re finished. (If you’re adding a single tint, there’s
no need to click Add; just click OK when done.)
Click Cancel if you change your mind about the current tint. Any new
tint will have the same name as the original color and the percentage of
shading, such as Sky Blue 66%.
You can create a tint from a tint, which can be confusing. Fortunately,
InDesign goes back to the original color when letting you create the new
tint. Thus, if you select Sky Blue 66% and move the slider to 33%, you get
a 33 percent tint of the original Sky Blue, not a 33 percent tint of the Sky
Blue 66% (which would be equivalent to a 22 percent tint of the original
Sky Blue).
Creating mixed colors
InDesign offers another type of color: mixed-ink color. Essentially, a mixed-ink
color combines a spot color with the default process colors (cyan, magenta,
yellow, and black) to create new color swatches. For example, you can com-
bine 38 percent black with 100 percent Pantone 130C to get a darker version
of Pantone 130C (called a duotone, though InDesign doesn’t limit you to
mixing spot colors with just black, as traditional duotones do).
To create a mixed-ink swatch, follow these steps:
1. Select the spot color you want to begin with and then choose New
Mixed Ink Swatch from the Swatches pane’s palette menu. Note that
you cannot use process colors.
The New Mixed Ink Swatch dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 10-7.
2. Select the percentages of the spot color and any or all of the default
process colors you want to mix and give the new color a name.
3. Click Add to add another mixed-ink swatch based on the current spot
color.
If you’re creating just one color, click OK instead of Add. You can click
Cancel to abort the current mixed-ink color definition.
4. Click OK when you’re finished.
Working with gradients
A technique that has increased in popularity is the gradient (also called
blends and graduated fills), which blends two or more colors in a sequence,
going smoothly from, say, green to blue to yellow to orange. InDesign has a
powerful gradient-creation feature that lets you define and apply gradients to
pretty much any object in InDesign, including text, lines, frames, shapes, and
their outlines (strokes).
149
Chapter 10: Adding Frames, Lines, and Colors

In the Swatches pane, where you define colors and tints, you can also define gra-
dients. Just select the New Gradient Swatch option in the palette menu. You get
the dialog box shown in Figure 10-8. The first two options are straightforward:
 Type a name for the gradient in the Swatch Name field. Picking a name is
a bit more difficult than for a color, but use something like “Blue to Red”
or “Bright Multihue” or “Logo Gradient” that has a meaning specific to
the colors used or to its role in your document.
 In the Type pop-up menu, choose Linear or Radial. A linear blend goes in
one direction, while a radial blend radiates out in a circle from a central
point.

Part III: Object Essentials 

Now it gets a little tricky. Follow these steps:
1. Select a stop point — one of the squares at the bottom of the dialog
box on either end of the gradient ramp that shows the gradient as you
define it.
The stop points essentially define the start color (the stop point on the
left) and the end color (the stop point on the right). With a stop point
selected, you can now define its color.
2. Choose what color model you want to use — select from CMYK, RGB,
LAB, and Swatches in the Stop Color pop-up menu.
The area directly beneath the pop-up menu changes accordingly, dis-
playing sliders for CMYK, RGB, or LAB, or a list of all colors from the
Swatches pane for Swatches, depending on which model you choose.
3. Create or select the color you want for that stop point.
You can select the [Paper] white swatch as a stop point in a gradient.
You can also click and drag swatches from the Swatches pane to the gra-
dient ramp.
4. Repeat Steps 1 to 3 for the other stop point.
Note that the color models for the two stop points don’t have to be the
same — you can blend from a Pantone spot color to a CMYK color, for
example. (If a gradient mixes spot colors and process colors, InDesign
converts the spot colors to process colors.)
You now have a simple gradient. But you don’t have to stop there. Here are
your other options:
 You can change the rate at which the colors transition by sliding the dia-
mond icons at the top of the gradient ramp.
 You can create additional stop points by clicking right below the gradient
ramp. By having several stop points, you can have multiple color transi-
tions in a gradient. (Think of them like tab stops in text — you can define
as many as you need.) You delete unwanted stop points by clicking and
dragging them to the bottom of the dialog box.
Notice that there’s a diamond icon between each pair of stop points — that
means each pair can have its own transition rate.
When you create a new gradient, InDesign uses the settings from the last one
you created. If you want to create a gradient similar to an existing one, click
that existing gradient before selecting New Gradient Swatch from the palette
menu. InDesign copies the selected gradient’s settings to the new one, which
you can then edit. One reason to use this is to create, say, a radial version of
an existing linear gradient.
151
Chapter 10: Adding Frames, Lines, and Colors

The Swatches pane shows the actual gradient next to its name. The pattern
also appears in the Fill button or Stroke button in the Tools palette if that gra-
dient is currently selected as a fill or stroke, as well as in the Gradient button
in that palette, whether or not it’s currently applied as a fill or stroke.
Editing a gradient is as simple as double-clicking its name in the Swatches
pane or selecting it and choosing Edit Gradient Swatch from the palette
menu. You get the Gradient Options dialog box, which is nearly identical to
the New Gradient Swatch dialog box in Figure 10-8. What’s different in the
Gradient Options dialog box is the Preview option, which lets you see a gradi-
ent change in a selected object (if it’s visible on-screen, of course) as you
make changes in the Gradient Options dialog box.
Just as it does with colors, InDesign lets you create unnamed gradients — 
gradients that have no swatches. Unlike unnamed colors, you can use these
to your heart’s content, since all colors in a gradient are converted to
process colors and/or use defined spot-color swatches — so there are no
unnamed colors in their output. The process is pretty much the same as cre-
ating a gradient swatch, except that you select an object and then open the
Gradient pane (Window➪Gradient). In that pane, you select a stop point and
then choose a color to apply to it by clicking a color in the Swatches pane or
in the Color pane. You create and adjust stop points here just as you do when
defining a gradient swatch.
The Gradient pane can also manipulate gradient swatches: After you apply a
linear gradient — whether via a gradient swatch or as an unnamed gradient —
you can change the angle of the gradient, rotating the gradient within the
object. Just type the desired degree of rotation in the Angle field to rotate the
gradient’s direction by the value. Negative values rotate counterclockwise,
while positive values rotate clockwise.
Note that you can’t rotate a radial gradient because it’s circular and, thus,
any rotation has no effect. That’s why InDesign grays out the Angle field for
radial gradients. But you can still adjust the location of a radial gradient — as
well as that of a linear gradient — by using the Gradient tool in the Tools
palette. After applying a gradient to an object, select the Gradient tool and
draw a line in the object, as shown in Figure 10-9:
 For a linear gradient, the start point of your line corresponds to where
you want the first stop point of the gradient to be; the end point of the
line corresponds to the last stop point. This lets you stretch or com-
press the gradient, as well as offset the gradient within the object. Also,
the angle at which you draw the line becomes the angle for the gradient.
 For a radial gradient, the line becomes the start and end point for the
gradient, in effect offsetting it.
152
Part III: Object Essentials 

Deleting and copying swatches
When you create colors, tints, and gradients, it’s easy to go overboard and
make too many. You’ll also find that different documents have different
colors, each created by different people, and you’ll likely want to move colors
from one document to another. InDesign provides basic tools for managing
colors in and across documents.
When selecting swatches for deletion or duplication, you can Ô+click or
Ctrl+click multiple swatches to work on all of them at once. Note that
Shift+clicking selects all swatches between the first swatch clicked and the
swatch that you Shift+click, whereas Ô+click or Ctrl+click lets you select spe-
cific swatches in any order and in any location in the pane.
InDesign makes deleting swatches easy: Just select the color, tint, or gradient
in the Swatches pane. Then choose Delete Swatch from the palette menu, or
click the Delete Swatch button at the bottom of the Swatches pane.
Well, that’s not quite it. You then get the dialog box shown in Figure 10-10,
which lets you either assign a new color to anything using the deleted swatch
(the Defined Swatch option) or leave the color on any object that is using it
but delete the swatch from the Swatches pane (the Unnamed Swatch option).
(As explained earlier in this chapter, unnamed colors should be avoided, so if
your document uses a color, keep its swatch.)
If you delete a tint and replace it with another color, any object using that tint
gets the full-strength version of the new color, not a tint of it. Likewise, if you
delete a color swatch that you’ve based one or more tints on, those tints are
also deleted if you replace the deleted swatch with an unnamed swatch.
Figure 10-9:
The
Gradient
tool lets you

153
Chapter 10: Adding Frames, Lines, and Colors

However, if you delete a color swatch and replace it with a defined swatch,
any tints of that deleted swatch retain their tint percentages of the replace-
ment-defined swatch.
InDesign offers a nice option to quickly find all unused colors in the Swatches
pane — the palette menu’s Select All Unused option. With this option, you
can delete all the unused colors in one fell swoop. Note that you don’t get the
option to assign each deleted color separately to another color in the Delete
Swatch dialog box — they all are replaced with the color you select or are
made into unnamed colors. Because no object uses these colors, choosing
Unnamed Swatch in essence is the same as not replacing them with a color
using the Defined Swatch option.
If you delete a swatch and replace it with an unnamed swatch, you can recap-
ture that deleted swatch later by choosing the Add Unnamed Colors menu
item in the Swatches pane’s palette menu.
To duplicate a swatch, so you can create a new one based on it, use the
Duplicate Swatch option in the Swatches pane. The word copy will be added
to the name of the new swatch. You edit it — including its name — as you
would any swatch.
Importing swatches
A quick way to import specific colors from another InDesign document or
template is to click and drag the colors from that other file’s Swatches pane
into your current document or template.
Figure 10-10:
The Delete
Swatch
dialog box
lets you

color with a

154
Part III: Object Essentials 

You can import colors from other InDesign, Illustrator, and Illustrator EPS
files by choosing Load Swatches from the Swatches pane’s palette menu.
Plus, you can now also import colors from Adobe Swatch Exchange library
files this way. From the resulting dialog box, navigate to the file that contains
the colors you want to import, select that file, and click Open.
When you import color swatches from other documents or Adobe Swatch
Exchange files, InDesign brings in all the colors. You cannot choose specific
colors to import.
Also, when you import a graphic file in PDF or EPS format, any named colors
(swatches) in that file are automatically added to the Swatches pane.
Finally, InDesign CS2 lets you save swatches into color library files for use by
other Creative Suite 2 users. Just select the colors you want to save and then
choose Save Swatches from the Swatches pane’s palette menu. You are asked
to give the resulting Adobe Swatch Exchange file a name before you save it.
Applying Colors
Applying colors, tints, and gradients to objects in InDesign is easy. Select the
object, click the Formatting Affects Text button or Formatting Affects
Container button in the Swatches or Gradient pane as appropriate for what
you want to apply the color to, and then click the appropriate swatch.
Another way to apply colors, tints, and gradients is by selecting the object
and using the Formatting Affects Text, Formatting Affects Content, Fill, or
Stroke buttons in the Tools palette to define what part of the object you want
to color. You can use the Swatches or Gradients panes to select a swatch, or
pick the last-used color and gradient from the Apply Color and Apply
Gradient buttons on the Tools palette, shown in Figure 10-11.
For tints, you can use a tint swatch, or you can simply apply a color from the
Swatches pane and enter a tint value in the pane’s Tint field. Use a swatch for
tints you want to use repeatedly in your layout (such as for the background
tint in sidebar boxes) to ensure consistency. Use the Tint field for a tint you
are applying on the fly, typically for one-time use.
You can also apply colors and tints to gaps in strokes by using the Stroke
pane’s palette options menu (select Show Options and select a gap color).
Open the Stroke pane by choosing Window➪Stroke or by pressing F10.

Aligning Objects with Grids 
and Guidelines
In This Chapter
 Using exact coordinates
 Working with document grids and guidelines
 Aligning text with baseline grids
W
hen you draw objects like frames or lines, they appear where you
draw them. That’s what you expect, right? But sometimes you want
them to appear where you meant to draw them, not where you actually did.
Working with the mouse is inexact, but you can overcome that.
This chapter shows you how to use InDesign’s grids and guidelines feature to
ensure that your objects and text line up where you want them to, so your
layouts are all neat and tidy. You can also use precise positioning — whether
or not use you grids and guidelines — to specify the exact placement and
size of your objects.
Precise Positioning with Coordinates
The most precise way to position objects is by entering the object’s desired
coordinates in the X: and Y: fields of the Control palette or the Transform
pane. (You can also precisely change the object’s size by entering values in
the W: and H: fields.) The Control palette is visible by default at the top of the
document window. Access the Control palette by choosing Window➪Control
or by pressing Option+Ô+6 or Ctrl+Alt+6. The Control palette is more power-
ful than the Transform pane, which is a holdover from older versions of
InDesign, but if you want to use the Transform pane, choose Window➪Object
& Layout➪Transform or press F9. Figure 11-1 shows both the Control palette
and Transform pane and a selected frame.

But be careful: InDesign has these funny things called control points that is
easily overlooked. See those nine squares at the upper left of the Control
palette and Transform pane? They let you select what part of the object
those coordinates position: one of the four corners, one of the midpoints of
the sides, or the object center. The black one is the current control point, and
all coordinates are based on that. You usually want to enter coordinates
based on the upper-left corner, so be sure that the upper-left control point is
black (just click it if it is not).
Lining Up Objects with 
Guidelines and Grids
If you’ve ever seen a carpenter use a chalked string to snap a temporary line
as an aid for aligning objects, you understand the concept behind ruler guide-
lines and grids. They’re not structurally necessary and they don’t appear in
the final product, yet they still make your work easier.
InDesign provides several types of grids and guidelines:
 Ruler guides are moveable guidelines that are helpful for placing objects
precisely and for aligning multiple items.
 A baseline grid is a series of horizontal lines that help in aligning lines of
text and objects across a multicolumn page. When a document is open
and it has a baseline grid showing, the page looks like a sheet of lined
paper.
 A document grid is a set of horizontal and vertical lines that help you
place and align objects.
 A frame-based grid is similar to a baseline grid except that it is just for a
specific text frame.

The Control
palette 
(top) and
Transform
pane let 
you enter
precise
coordinates
for an
object’s
position.
158
Part III: Object Essentials 

You won’t need all the grids and guidelines at once. You’ll most likely use a
combination of guides and grids, but using all four at once is more compli-
cated than necessary.
Using ruler guides
InDesign lets you create individual ruler guides manually. You can also set
ruler guides automatically with the Create Guides command (Layout➪Create
Guides).
Manually creating ruler guides
To create ruler guides on an as-needed basis, follow these steps:
1. Go to the page or spread onto which you want to place ruler guides.
2. If the rulers are not displayed at the top and left of the document
window, choose View➪Show Rulers or press Ô+R or Ctrl+R.
3. Drag the pointer (and a guideline along with it) from the horizontal
ruler or vertical ruler onto a page or the pasteboard.
4. When the guideline is positioned where you want it, release the
mouse button.
If you release the mouse when the pointer is over a page, the ruler guide
extends from one edge of the page to the other (but not across a spread).
If you release the mouse button when the pointer is over the pasteboard,
the ruler guide extends across both pages of a spread and the pasteboard.
If you want a guide to extend across a spread and the pasteboard, you can
also hold down the Ô or Ctrl key as you drag and release the mouse when
the pointer is over a page.
Place both a horizontal and vertical guide at the same time by pressing Ô or
Ctrl and dragging the ruler intersection point (where the two rulers meet) onto
a page.
Ruler guides are cyan in color (unless you change the color by choosing
Layout➪Ruler Guides) and are associated with the layer onto which they’re
placed. You can show and hide ruler guides by showing and hiding the layers
that contain them. You can even create layers that contain nothing but ruler
guides and then show and hide them as you wish. (See Chapter 7 for more
information about layers.)
To create ruler guides for several document pages, create a master page, add
the ruler guides to the master page, and then apply the master to the appro-
priate document pages.
159
Chapter 11: Aligning Objects with Grids and Guidelines

Automatically creating ruler guides
Here’s how to create a set of ruler guides automatically:
1. If the documents contain multiple layers, display the Layers pane
(Window➪Layers or F7) and click the name of the layer to which you
want to add guides.
2. Choose Layout➪Create Guides to display the Create Guides dialog
box, shown in Figure 11-2. (To see the guides on the page while you
create them, check Preview.)
3. In the Rows and Columns areas, specify the number of guides you want
to add in the Number fields and, optionally, specify a Gutter width
between horizontal (Rows) and vertical (Columns) guides. Enter 0 (zero)
in the Gutter fields if you don’t want gutters between guides.
4. In the Options area, click Margins to fit the guides in the margin
boundaries; click Page to fit the guides within the page boundary.
5. Remove any previously placed ruler guides by checking Remove
Existing Ruler Guides.

Guides
dialog box
and the
guides it
created.

Part III: Object Essentials 

6. When you finish specifying the attributes of the ruler guides, click OK
to close the dialog box.
Working with ruler guides
You can show and hide, lock and unlock, select and move, copy and paste,
and delete ruler guides. In InDesign CS2, many options related to grids and
guides have been moved from the main View menu to the new Grids & Guides
submenu. Here are a few pointers for working with ruler guides:
 Display or hide ruler guides by choosing View➪Grids & Guides➪Show/
Hide Guides or by pressing Ô+; (semicolon) or Ctrl+; (semicolon).
 Lock or unlock all ruler guides by choosing View➪Grids & Guides➪
Lock Guides or by pressing Option+Ô+; (semicolon) or Ctrl+Alt+; (semi-
colon). Ruler guides are locked when Lock Guides is checked.
 Select a ruler guide by clicking it with a selection tool. To select multi-
ple guides, hold down the Shift key and click them. The color of a guide
changes from cyan to the color of its layer when it is selected. To select
all ruler guides on a page or spread, press Option+Ô+G or Ctrl+Alt+G.
 Move a guide by clicking and dragging it as you would any object. To
move multiple guides, select them and then drag them. To move guides
to another page, select them, choose Edit➪Cut or press Ô+X or Ctrl+X
(or choose Edit➪Copy or press Ô+C or Ctrl+C), display the target page,
and then choose Edit➪Paste or press Ô+V or Ctrl+V. If the target page
has the same dimensions as the source page, the guides are placed in
their original positions.
 Delete ruler guides by selecting them and then pressing Delete or
Backspace.
 Change the color of the ruler guides and the view percentage above
which they’re displayed by choosing Layout➪Ruler Guides. The Ruler
Guides dialog box, shown in Figure 11-3, appears. Modify the View
Threshold value, choose a different color from the Color pop-up menu,
and then click OK. If you change the settings in the Ruler Guides dialog
box when no documents are open, the new settings become defaults and
are applied to all subsequently created documents.
 Display ruler guides behind — instead of in front of — objects by
choosing InDesign➪Preferences➪Guides & Pasteboard on the Mac or
Edit➪Preferences➪Guides & Pasteboard in Windows, or by pressing
Ô+K or Ctrl+K. Then select the Guides in Back option in the Guide
Options section of the dialog box.
 Make object edges snap (align) to ruler guides when you drag them
into the snap zone by selecting the Snap to Guides option (View➪Grids
& Guides➪Snap to Guides, or press Shift+Ô+; [semicolon] or Ctrl+Shift+;
[semicolon]). To specify the snap zone (the distance — in pixels — at
161
Chapter 11: Aligning Objects with Grids and Guidelines

which an object will snap to a guide), choose InDesign➪Preferences➪
Guides & Pasteboard on the Mac or Edit➪Preferences➪Guides &
Pasteboard in Windows, or press Ô+K or Ctrl+K, and enter a value in the
Snap to Zone field in the Guide Options section of the dialog box.
Using document grids
A document grid is like the grid paper you used in school, a visual crutch to
help ensure that the objects you draw and reposition are placed at desired
increments. Using a grid can help ensure that objects align and are sized 
consistently.
If you plan to use a grid, set it up before you start working in the document.
Because documents tend to have different grid settings based on individual
contents, you probably want to set Grids preferences with a specific docu-
ment open so that the grid will apply only to that document. The Grids pane
of the Preferences dialog box (InDesign➪Preferences or Ô+K on the Mac, or
Edit➪Preferences or Ctrl+K in Windows) is shown in Figure 11-4.
Figure 11-4:
The Grids
pane of the
Preferences
dialog box.
Figure 11-3:
The Ruler

162
Part III: Object Essentials 

You have the following options:
 Color: The default color of the document grid is Light Gray. You can
choose a different color from the Color pop-up menu or choose Other to
create your own.
 Gridline Every: The major gridlines, which are slightly darker, are posi-
tioned according to this value. The default value is 6p0; in general, you
want to specify a value within the measurement system you’re using. For
example, if you work in inches, you might enter 1 inch in the Gridline
Every field. You set the horizontal and vertical settings separately.
 Subdivisions: The major gridlines established in the Gridline Every field
are subdivided according to the value you enter here. For example, if
you enter 1 inch in the Gridline Every field and 4 in the Subdivisions
field, you get a gridline at each quarter-inch. The default number of sub-
divisions is 8. You set the horizontal and vertical settings separately.
By default, the document grid appears on every spread behind all objects. You
can have grids display in front by deselecting the Grids in Back check box.
To make object edges snap (align) to the grid when you drag them into the
snap zone, select the Snap to Document Grid option (View➪Grids & Guides➪
Snap to Document Grid, or press Shift+Ô+' [apostrophe] or Ctrl+Shift+' [apos-
trophe]). To specify the snap zone (the distance — in pixels — at which an
object will snap to a gridline), InDesign will use whatever settings you specified
for guidelines, as explained earlier in this chapter.
To display the document grid, choose View➪Grids & Guides➪Show Document
Grid or press Ô+' (apostrophe) or Ctrl+' (apostrophe).
Using baseline grids
You may not already know this, but each and every new document you 
create includes a baseline grid. A baseline grid can be helpful for aligning text
baselines across columns and for ensuring that object edges align with text
baselines.
But chances are that the default settings for the baseline grid won’t match
the baselines (leading) for the majority of your text. The default baseline grid
begins 1⁄2 inch from the top of a document page; the default gridlines are light
blue, are spaced 1 pica apart, and appear at view percentages above 75 per-
cent. If you change any of these settings when no documents are open, the
changes are applied to all subsequently created documents; if a document is
open, changes apply only to that document.
163
Chapter 11: Aligning Objects with Grids and Guidelines

So here’s how to modify the baseline grid:
1. Choose InDesign➪Preferences➪Grids (Mac) or Edit➪Preferences➪
Grids (Windows) or press Ô+K or Ctrl+K and choose the Grids pane.
The Grids pane, shown in Figure 11-4, appears.
2. Pick a color for the baseline from the Color pop-up menu in the
Baseline Grid area.
3. In the Start field, enter the distance between the top of the page and
the first gridline.
If you enter 0, the Increment Every value determines the distance
between the top of the page and the first gridline.
4. In the Increment Every field, enter the distance between gridlines.
If you’re not sure what value to use, enter the leading value for the publi-
cation’s body text.
5. Choose a View Threshold percentage from the pop-up menu or enter a
value in the field.
You probably don’t want to display the baseline grid at reduced view
percentages because gridlines become tightly spaced.
6. Click OK to close the dialog box and return to the document.
The Show/Hide Baseline Grid command (View➪Grids & Guides➪Show/Hide
Baseline Grid, or Option+Ô+' [apostrophe] or Ctrl+Alt+' [apostrophe]) lets
you display and hide a document’s baseline grid.
When you set a baseline grid, it applies to the entire document. Gridlines are
displayed behind all objects, layers, and ruler guides. To get text to line up to
the baseline grid, you need to ensure that the Align to Grid pop-up menu is
set to either First Line Only or All Lines in your paragraph style or that the
Align to Baseline Grid check box is selected in the Paragraph pane or in the
Control palette. Chapter 17 covers such paragraph formatting in detail.
A document-wide baseline grid is all fine and dandy, but often it’s not enough.
The document-wide baseline grid is basically useful for your body text and
often your headline text, assuming that the baseline grid’s increments match
the leading for that text. But what if you have other elements, like sidebars,
that have different leading?
The answer is to use text frame–specific baseline grids. You set the grid as
part of text frame options by choosing Object➪Text Frame Options or by
pressing Ô+B or Ctrl+B and then going to the Baseline Options pane. Its
options are almost identical to those in the Grids pane of the Preferences
dialog box. A baseline grid established for a text frame affects only the text in
that frame.

F
rames, shapes, and lines are the building blocks of your layout. But as
anyone who ever played with Legos or Tinkertoys knows, it’s how you
manipulate the building blocks that results in a unique creation, whether it
be a Lego house, a Tinkertoys crane, or an InDesign layout.
InDesign provides a lot of control over layout objects so that you can create
really interesting, dynamic publications suited to any purpose. In this chap-
ter, we discuss the controls that apply to all objects.
Chapter 12 covers various effects for graphics frames, while Chapter 15
covers effects for text frames. Chapter 10 explains how to add frames,
shapes, and lines in the first place. Chapter 11 explains how to align objects
and precisely position them.
Selecting Objects
Before you can manipulate an object, you have to select it so that InDesign
knows what you want to work on. To select an object (rather than its con-
tents), use the Selection tool. Selected items will display their item boundary
(a rectangle that encompasses the object) as well as eight small resizing han-
dles (one at each of the four corners and one midway between each side of
the item boundary). Figure 12-1 shows an example.

To select an individual object, just click it with the Selection tool. To select
multiple objects, you have several options:
 Click the first object and Shift+click each additional object.
 Click and drag the mouse to create a selection rectangle (called a mar-
quee) that encompasses at least part of each desired object. When you
release the mouse, all objects that this marquee touches are selected.
 Choose Edit➪Select All or press Ô+A or Ctrl+A to select all objects on
the current spread.
If an object is on a master page and you’re working on a document page, you
must Shift+Ô+click or Ctrl+Shift+click the object to select it. How do you
know whether an object is on a master page? Easy: If you try to select it by
clicking and it doesn’t become selected, it must be on a master page.
Choose View➪Show Frame Edges or press Ô+H or Ctrl+H to see object edges
if they aren’t already visible.
These options are pretty easy, but it can get tricky when you want to select
objects that overlap or are obscured by other objects. So how do you select
them? By using the Select submenu option in the Object menu.
The first four options in the Select submenu let you select another object rel-

 First Object Above (Option+Shift+Ô+] or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+]) selects the
topmost object.

Part III: Object Essentials 

 Next Object Above (Option+Ô+] or Ctrl+Alt+]) selects the object imme-
diately on top of the current object.
 Next Object Below (Option+Ô+[ or Ctrl+Alt+[) selects the object immedi-
ately under the current object.
 Last Object Below (Option+Shift+Ô+[ or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+[) selects the
bottommost object.
If no objects are selected, InDesign bases its selection on the order in which
the objects were created, the topmost object being the one that was most
recently created.
You can also access these four selection options by Control+clicking or right-
clicking an object and choosing the Select menu from the contextual menu
that appears.
The Select submenu has four other options:
 If you select an object’s content (text or graphic), choose Object➪Select➪
Container to choose the frame. Using this option is the same as selecting
the object with the Selection tool.
 If an object has content (text or graphic) and you select its frame,
choose Object➪Select➪Content to choose the content within the object.
This is basically the same as selecting the frame with the Direct
Selection tool (which we discuss later in this chapter).
 If you select an object in a group of objects by using the Direct Selection
tool, choose Object➪Select➪Previous Object in Group to navigate to the
previous object in the group.
 Similarly, if you select an object in a group of objects by using the Direct
Selection tool, choose Object➪Select➪Next Object in Group to navigate
to the next object in the group.
Object creation order determines what is “previous” or “next” in a group.
The Control palette also provides buttons to select the next or previous
object, as well as to select the content or container (frame). These last two
buttons appear only if you have selected a group. The buttons for selecting
the next or previous object appear only if you are using the Direct Selection
tool, while the buttons for selecting the content or container appear whether
you are using the Selection or Direct Selection tool. (Yes, this is very confus-
ing!) Figure 12-2 shows the buttons.
To deselect objects, just click another object, an empty part of your page, or
the pasteboard. To deselect individual objects after you have selected multi-
ple objects, Shift+click those you want to deselect.
167
Chapter 12: Manipulating Objects

The Direct Selection tool lets you select any of the individual anchor points
(and direction handles of freeform shapes and curved lines) on an object. If
you use the Direct Selection tool to click an object that has a bounding box,
the shape within is selected, and the bounding box is deselected. You use
this tool to work on the contents independently of its container frame. You
can also move a graphic within its frame by clicking within the object (see
Chapter 20).
Moving, Resizing, and Deleting Objects
The most common tasks you’ll do with objects is rearranging them — both
moving them and changing their dimensions — plus deleting the ones you
don’t want or no longer need. In any case, you must first select the object
with the Selection tool.
Moving objects
The easiest way to move an object is by using the mouse. With the Selection
tool, click an object and drag it to a new location. When you release the
mouse, the object will be deposited in the new location.
If you want to more precisely move an object, you can enter specific X: and
Y: coordinates in the Control palette or Transform pane, as explained in
Chapter 12.

168
Part III: Object Essentials 

Be sure to select the correct control point when entering coordinates. The
little squares at the top left of the Control palette and Transform pane repre-
sent the object’s control points (corners, side midpoints, and center). Click a
control point to make it active (it will turn black); all coordinates are now
based on this point.
Resizing objects
You resize objects in pretty much the same way you move them: by using the
mouse for inexact sizes or the Control palette or Transform pane for precise
sizes.
To resize an object with the mouse, click and drag one of the frame’s handles.
(Hold the Shift key as you drag to maintain the proportions of the frame.)
Drag a corner handle to resize both the width and height or a side handle to
resize just the height or width.
You can also enter new value in the W: and H: fields (for width and height) of
the Control palette or Transform pane. Remember those control points for
positioning an object? They come into play for resizing objects as well.
Basically, the object will grow or shrink starting from the selected control
point. So if the upper-left control point is selected and you enter greater W:
and H: values, the object will add the extra width to the right and the extra
height below. But if you choose the center control point, it will grow on both
sides as well as on the top and bottom, spreading the extra size evenly.
Another way to resize a graphic is to enter percentage values in the Scale X
Percentage and Scale Y Percentage fields of the Control palette or Transform
pane. This is a handy technique for empty frames and shapes, but there are
some issues that affect graphics and text that you need to understand fully.
(In a nutshell, these Scale fields usually resize the contents of the frame, not
just the frame itself.) Chapter 20 covers the use of the Scale X Percentage and
Scale Y Percentage fields.
Deleting objects
Alas, not all the objects you create will survive all the way to the final version
of your publication. Some will wind up on the cutting room floor. You can
always move an object to the pasteboard if you’re not sure whether you want
to get rid of it altogether (objects on the pasteboard don’t print). But when
it’s time to ax an object, oblivion is just a keystroke or two away.
If you delete a text or graphics frame, the contents are removed as well as the
frame.
169
Chapter 12: Manipulating Objects

Here’s how to delete objects: Using either selection tool, select the object or
objects you want to delete and then press the Delete key or Backspace key.
You can also delete a selected item by choosing Edit➪Clear.
Choosing Edit➪Cut or pressing Ô+X or Ctrl+X also removes a selected object.
However, in this case a copy of the object is saved to the Clipboard and can
be pasted elsewhere (by choosing Edit➪Paste or by pressing Ô+V or Ctrl+V)
until you cut or copy something else or you shut down your computer.
Preventing Objects from Printing
InDesign lets you prevent an object from printing. To do so, select the object
with the Selection or Direct Selection tool, open the Attributes pane (Window➪
Attributes), and then select the Nonprinting check box. (The other settings in
this pane duplicate stroke settings covered later in this chapter.)
You use this feature for comments and other elements that should not print
but that the designer needs to have visible on-screen. Another approach 
to nonprinting objects is to place them all on a layer and make the entire
layer nonprinting.
Transforming Objects
InDesign offers several tools and methods for transforming objects. We discuss
resizing and moving earlier in this chapter, but there are several other useful
transformation tools, including rotating, shearing (skewing), and flipping.
Rotating is just spinning an object around. Shearing is a little more compli-
cated: Shearing skews an object (slanting it in one direction) while also rotating
the other axis at the same time. Regardless of whether you use the mouse or
numeric controls to apply rotation and/or shearing to graphics, you first need
to follow these steps:
1. Select the Selection tool.
2. Click the object you want to modify.
3. If you want, change the object’s control point (by default it’s the upper-
left corner of a frame or shape).
You can change the control point by clicking one of the little black boxes
in the upper-left corner of the Control palette or Transform pane.
4. Choose the appropriate tool — Rotate, Shear, or Free Transform — or
use the Flip menu options.
Figure 12-3 shows the Tools palette icons for all but the flip controls.
170
Part III: Object Essentials 

If you hold down the Option or Alt key while using a transformation tool, the
modification will be performed on a copy of the selected object, rather than
on the object itself.
Rotating objects
After you have selected the Rotate tool, click and drag a selected object to
rotate it — the object will rotate following your mouse movement. (Holding
down the Shift key while dragging limits rotation increments to multiples of
45 degrees.)
For more precise rotation, use the Control palette or Transform pane. You can
change the angle of a selected object by entering a value in the Rotation field.
If you choose to enter a value in the Rotation field, positive values rotate the
selected item counterclockwise; negative values rotate it clockwise.
Or you can choose one of the predefined angles from the Rotation field’s pop-
up menu, or choose any of the three rotation options — Rotate 180°, Rotate
90° CW, and Rotate 90° CCW — in the Control palette’s or Transform pane’s
palette menu.
If you choose one of these palette menu options, the current angle of the
selected object is added to the applied angle. For example, if you choose
Rotate 90° CCW (counterclockwise), an object that’s currently rotated 12
degrees will end up with a rotation angle of 102 degrees.
No matter what method you choose to rotate an object, the center of rota-
tion will be whatever control point is selected in the Control palette or
Transform pane.
To “unrotate” an object, enter a Rotation value of 0.

Chapter 12: Manipulating Objects

Shearing objects
After you have selected the Shear tool, click and drag a selected object to
shear it. (Holding down the Shift key constrains the selected object’s rotation
value to increments of 45 degrees.) If you drag the mouse in a straight line
parallel with one set of edges (such as the top and bottom), you skew the
graphic (just slant it in one direction). But if you move the mouse in any
other direction, you slant the object’s edges closest to the direction that you
move the mouse the furthest and rotate the rest of the graphic. Give it a few
tries to see what happens.
As with other functions, you can also use the Control palette or Transform
pane for more precise control. Just enter a Shear X value in the Control palette
or Transform pane or choose a predefined value from the field’s pop-up menu.
Positive shear values slant an object to the right (that is, the top edge of the
object is moved to the right), while negative values slant an object to the left
(the bottom edge is moved to the right). You can enter shear values between 1
and 89 (although values above 70 cause considerable distortion).
Note that when you use the Shear tool, you change the selected object’s angle
of rotation and skew angle simultaneously. If you use the mouse, you can in
effect get different skew and rotation angles based on how you move the
mouse, but if you use the Control palette or Transform pane, both the skew
and rotation will have the same angles applied.
To “unshear” an object, enter a Shear X value of 0.
Flipping objects
The three flipping commands — Flip Horizontal, Flip Vertical, and Flip Both —
are available in the Control palette’s and Transform pane’s palette menus.
They let you make a mirror image of a selected object and its contents. If you
choose Flip Horizontal, the graphic is flipped along a vertical axis (that is, the
172
Part III: Object Essentials 
Using the Free Transform tool
Advanced users will like the Free Transform
tool. When you select this tool, InDesign lets
you scale, rotate, and resize — but not shear —
selected objects. If you click within the frame,
you can move the object by dragging it. If you
select a frame handle (whether corner or mid-
point), you can resize the object by dragging.
Finally, if you move the mouse very close to a
frame handle, you will see a curved arrow,
which indicates that you can rotate the object
around that object’s center point. Having a tool
that does more than one thing can be confus-
ing, but once you get the hang of it, it sure beats
constantly changing tools!

right edge and left edge exchange places); if you choose Flip Vertical, the
object is flipped upside down; and if you choose Flip Both, the object is
flipped horizontally and vertically to produce an upside-down and backward
version of the original. (You’re not making a flipped copy of the select object,
but actually flipping the selected object.)
As with other tools, the invisible line over which an object is flipped is based
on what control point is currently active for that object.
Repeating transformations
Whatever transformations you use, you can apply them repeatedly. InDesign
CS2 remembers the effects that you apply to frames via the Control palette,
Transform pane, and transform tools. Choose Object➪Transform Again➪
Transform Again (Option+Ô+3 or Ctrl+Alt+3) to repeat the last transforma-
tion on the selected object (it can be a different object than you last applied a
transformation to).
Or choose Object➪Transform Again➪Transform Sequence Again (Option+Ô+4
or Ctrl+Alt+4) to apply all recent transformations to a selected object. That
sequence of transactions stays in memory until you perform a new transfor-
mation, which then starts a new sequence, so you can apply the same trans-
formation to multiple objects.
Two other transform-again options are available through the Object➪Transform
Again menu option’s submenu: Transform Again Individually and Transform
Sequence Again Individually. You use these on groups; they work like the regular
Transform Again and Transform Sequence Again options but apply any effects
to each object individually within the group. For example, choosing Transform
Again to a group might rotate the entire group as if it were one unit, but choos-
ing Transform Again Individually would rotate each object in the group sepa-
rately, not the group as a unit. Try it and see exactly what it does!
Adding Strokes, Fills, and Other Effects
InDesign lets you change an object’s appearance in several ways:
 Add a border, or stroke, around an object’s perimeter and apply a solid
color, a tint, or a gradient to the stroke.
 Add a solid color, a tint, or a gradient to the frame’s background.
 Apply any of several corner effects.
 Apply transparency, drop-shadow, and feathering effects to objects.
173
Chapter 12: Manipulating Objects

Adding strokes
All objects have a stroke with a width of 0 built in, so you never really have to
add strokes. But to use them, you need to modify them so they have some
thickness onto which you can apply attributes such as colors and gradients.
Setting stroke appearance
The Stroke pane is where you give the stroke its width, as well as apply the
type of stroke and other attributes:
1. Select either of the selection tools and click the object whose stroke
you want to modify.
2. If the Stroke pane is not displayed, show it by choosing Window➪
Stroke or by pressing F10. Figure 12-4 shows the pane.
3. To change the width of the stroke, enter a new value in the Weight
field. You can also change the Weight value by choosing a new value
from the field’s pop-up menu or by clicking the up and down arrows.
(Each click increases or decreases the stroke by 1 point.)
4. Set the Miter Limit. The default of 4 is fine for almost all frames. You
rarely need to use this feature, so don’t worry about it.
5. Click any of the three Cap buttons to specify how dashes will look if
you create a dashed stroke (covered in Step 9). Experiment with them
in your objects to see which looks best for your situation.
Figure 12-4:

pane

Swatches
pane that is

at the same
time (top).
174
Part III: Object Essentials 

6. Click any of the three Join buttons to specify how corners are han-
dled. Again, experiment with these to see what works best for you.
7. Choose an Align Stroke option. The default is the first button, Align
Stroke to Center, which has the stroke straddle the frame. You can also
choose Align Stroke to Inside, which places the entire thickness inside
the frame boundary, or Align Stroke to Outside, which places the entire
thickness outside the frame boundary.
8. You can also choose end points for your strokes (this only affects
lines, not rectangles, ellipses, and other closed-loop shapes) by using
the Start and End pop-up menus. Figure 12-5 shows the options.
9. To create a dashed line instead of a solid line, choose an option from
the Type pop-up menu. (These are also available from the Control
palette.) Choose from 16 types of predefined dashes and stripes. The
Gap Color and Gap Tint fields at the bottom of the Stroke pane become
active as well, to let you choose a specific color and tint for the gaps in
dashes and stripes.
Now that you have a visible stroke, you want to color it. Here’s how:
1. Select either of the selection tools and click the frame to which you
want to add a stroke.
2. Click the Stroke button in the Swatches pane or Tools palette.
3. You now can click a color, tint, or gradient from the Swatches pane, or
click one of the three boxes at the bottom of the Tools palette, which
let you use (from left to right) the last-selected color, last-selected gra-
dient, or None (this removes the stroke’s color, tint, or gradient).
For information about adding colors to the Swatches pane and applying
colors to objects, see Chapter 10.

Chapter 12: Manipulating Objects

Creating stroke styles
InDesign lets you create custom strokes, known as stroke styles, in any of
three types: dashed, dotted, and striped. To create custom dashes or stripes,
choose the Stroke Styles option in the Stroke pane’s palette menu. In the
resulting Stroke Styles dialog box, you can create new strokes, edit or delete
existing ones, and import strokes from a stroke styles file, which you create
by saving a document’s strokes as a separate file for import into other docu-
ments. Stroke style files have the filename extension .inst.
Note that you cannot edit or delete the seven default stripe patterns shown
in the Stroke Styles dialog box, nor can you edit or delete the default dash
patterns — they’re not even available in the dialog box. When you edit or
create a stroke pattern, you get the New Stroke Style dialog box, shown in
Figure 12-6. In the Name field, enter a name for your stroke. In the Type pop-
up menu, you can choose to create (or convert a stripe you are editing to) a
dashed, dotted, or striped stroke.
For dashes, you can resize the dash component by dragging the down-pointing
triangle at the end of the dash in the ruler section. You can add dash segments
by simply clicking the ruler and dragging a segment to the desired width. Or
you can use the Start and Length fields to manually specify them. The Pattern
Length field is where you indicate the length of the segment that will be
repeated to create a dashed line.
In the Corners pop-up menu, you tell InDesign whether to adjust how the
dashes and gaps are handled at corners; the default is Adjust Dashes and
Gaps, a setting you should keep — it will make sure your corners have dash
segments that extend along both sides of the corner, which looks neater.
Figure 12-6:
The dashes
version of
the New
Stroke Style
dialog box.
176
Part III: Object Essentials 

(Your other options are Adjust Dashes, Adjust Gaps, and None.) You can also
choose a cap style and the stroke weight. The preview section of the pane
lets you see your dash as you create or edit it.
For dots, you get a similar dialog box as for dashes. The Start and Length
fields disappear, replaced with the Center field that determines where any
added dots are placed on the ruler. (The initial dot, shown as a half-circle,
starts at 0 and cannot be moved or deleted.) The Caps field is also gone.
To delete a dash or dot segment, just drag it to the left, off the ruler.
For stripes, you also get a similar dialog box. The principle is the same as for
dashes: You create segments (in this case vertical, not horizontal) for the
stripes by dragging on the ruler. However, the stripes version of the dialog
box expresses its values in percentages because the actual thickness of each
stripe is determined by the stroke weight — the thicker the stroke, the
thicker each stripe is in the overall stroke.
In all three versions of the New Stroke Style dialog box, you click Add to add
the stroke to your document, and then you can create a new stroke. When
you’re done creating strokes, click OK. (When editing a stroke, the Add
button won’t be available.)
Be sure to use the Preview Weight slider shown in Figure 12-6. This is avail-
able in all three versions of the New Stroke Style dialog box. It lets you
increase or decrease the preview size so you can better see thin or small ele-
ments in your stroke.
Adding fills
The option to add a stroke to any shape becomes even more powerful when
combined with the option to fill any shape with a color or tint. For example,
adding a fill to a text frame is an effective way to draw attention to a sidebar.
Adding a fill to a shape is much like adding a stroke, and the options available
for specifying color and tint are identical. The only difference is that you click
the Fill button in the Tools palette or Swatches pane rather than the Stroke
button.
Adding special effects to corners
Anytime you’re working on an object that has any sharp corners, you have
the option to add a little pizzazz to those corners via InDesign’s Corner
Effects feature (Object➪Corner Effects). Five built-in corner styles, shown in
Figure 12-7, are available. Note that if the shape contains only smooth points,
any corner effect you apply won’t be noticeable.
177
Chapter 12: Manipulating Objects

To add a corner effect:
1. Select either of the selection tools and click the object to which you
want to add a corner effect.
2. Choose Object➪Corner Effects to display the Corner Effects dialog
box. (Select the Preview check box to view changes as you make them.)
3. Choose an option from the Effect pop-up menu.
4. Enter a distance in the Size field.
The Size value determines the length that the effect extends from the
corner.
5. Click OK to close the dialog box and apply your changes.
If you can’t see a corner effect after applying one, make sure that a color is
applied to the stroke or try making the object’s stroke thicker. Increasing the
Size value in the Corner Effects dialog box can also make a corner effect more
visible.
Using transparency
One of InDesign’s most sophisticated tools is its set of transparency options,
which let you make objects partially transparent. You apply transparency
with the Transparency pane (Window➪Transparency or Shift+F10). Figure
12-8 shows the pane as well as a text title that uses transparency as it over-
prints a background photo. Notice how the semi-transparent text fades away
toward the top and is brighter toward the bottom.
Figure 12-7:
The Corner
Effects
dialog box
lets you
apply any of
five effects
to frame
corners.
178
Part III: Object Essentials 

You cannot apply transparency to text selections or to layers, nor can you
apply different transparency settings to an object’s fill and stroke. Also, if you
remove an object from a group that had transparency applied (via cut and
paste or copy and paste), that pasted object will not retain the group’s trans-
parency settings.
There are 16 different transparency types — called blending modes — as
shown in Figure 12-8 (Photoshop and Illustrator users will recognize these
options.) The differences among them can be subtle or extreme, depending
on a variety of issues. You should experiment with them to see what effect
works best in each case.
The Difference, Exclusion, Hue, Saturation, Color, and Luminosity modes do
not blend spot colors — only process colors.
You have two other options in the Transparency pane:
 Isolate Blending restricts the blending modes to the objects in a group,
instead of also applying them to objects beneath the group. This can
prevent unintended changes to those underlying objects.
 Knockout Group obscures any objects below the selected group. But
those objects are still affected by any blend mode settings applied to the
group, unless Isolate Blending is also checked.
Using drop shadows
To apply a drop shadow to an object, you first select it with a selection tool.
Then open the Drop Shadow dialog box, shown in Figure 12-9, by choosing
Object➪Drop Shadow or by pressing Option+Ô+M or Ctrl+Alt+M. In the
dialog box, you set the following options:

Chapter 12: Manipulating Objects

 Select the Drop Shadow option to turn on the drop shadow function.
 Select a lighting type (technically, a blend mode) by choosing one of the
16 options in the Mode pop-up menu. (These are the same blending
modes used in transparencies.)
 Specify the opacity by entering a value in the Opacity field — 0% is invis-
ible, while 100% is completely solid.
 Specify the shadow’s position relative to the object by using the X Offset
and Y Offset fields. A positive X Offset moves the shadow to the right; a
positive Y Offset moves the shadow down. Negative values go in the
other direction.
 Specify the shadow’s size by entering a value in the Blur field — this
blurs a copy of the text used in the drop shadow to make it look like it
was created by shining light on solid letters.
 Choose a color source — Swatches, RGB, CMYK, or LAB — from the
Color pop-up menu and then select a color from the sliders or swatches
below that menu. You get sliders for RGB, CMYK, and LAB colors, or a
set of previously defined color swatches if you selected Swatches in the
Color pop-up menu.
 To see the effects of your various setting adjustments in the actual
layout, check the Preview option.
Using feathering
A similar option to drop shadows is feathering, which essentially softens the
edges of objects. Like drop shadows, feathering can be applied only to
objects, not to individual text, paths, or strokes. To feather an object, first
select it and then choose Object➪Feather. You get the dialog box shown in
Figure 12-10.
Figure 12-9:

Shadow
dialog box

180
Part III: Object Essentials 

To apply feathering, select the Feather option. You then enter a value for the
degree of feathering — smaller numbers have the least effect, larger numbers
have the most effect. The feathering area starts at the outside edge of the
object and “eats into” the object, making it a wispier version of itself. The
Corners pop-up menu gives you three options: Sharp, Rounded, and Diffused.
The Sharp option retains the original shape as much as possible. The Rounded
option rounds the corners of the object; it can distort the shape dramatically at
larger Feather Width settings. The Diffused option creates a soft, almost smoky
effect by making the feathered part of the object more translucent.

Organizing Objects
In This Chapter
 Creating object styles
 Anchoring objects to text
 Grouping and ungrouping objects
 Locking and unlocking objects
 Changing objects’ stacking order
 Moving objects to other documents
You use objects throughout your layout: lines, text frames, graphics
frames, shapes, and so forth. A big part of working with them involves
organizing them — deciding when to group them together, when to lock them
in location, when to associate them with other objects, and so on. That’s
where this chapter comes in.
But first, you’ll learn about a powerful new feature called object styles that
lets you save object attributes and apply them to other objects for consis-
tent, easy formatting.
Working with Object Styles
For many years, desktop publishing programs have let designers save textual
styles for easy reuse and application throughout a document. Yet only in 2005
did someone get the brilliant idea that this capability would work well for
objects, too. (Well, actually, someone had that idea about 15 years ago, in a
program that didn’t survive the early years of desktop publishing, but it’s still
fantastic that a mainstream publishing tool has picked up the idea.)
InDesign now lets you create object styles, so you can assure that multiple
objects have the same attributes and that any changes to the style are made
to all the objects using that style.

Designers will find the process of creating and applying object styles very
familiar because the concept is the same as creating other types of styles,
such as paragraph, character, and stroke styles.
Creating object styles
You create object styles by using the Object Styles pane (Window➪Object
Styles or Ô+F7 or Ctrl+F7), shown in Figure 13-1. You can also click the New
Object Style button at the bottom of the pane.
The simplest way to create an object style is to select an already-formatted
object with the Selection or Direct Selection tool, then choose New Object
Style from the Object Style pane’s palette menu. InDesign records all the set-
tings automatically from the selected object, so they’re in place for the new
object style.
Whether you start with an existing object or create a new object style com-
pletely from scratch, you use the New Object Style menu option that opens
the New Object Style dialog box shown in Figure 13-2.
At the left side of the dialog box is a list of types of attributes that are or can
be set. The checked items are in use for this style — you can uncheck an item
so InDesign doesn’t apply its settings to objects using the style. For example,
if Fill is unchecked, the object style won’t apply any Fill settings to objects
using that style (and won’t change any fill settings that have been applied to
that object locally).
To switch from one type of attribute to another, simply click the item name for
the type of attribute that you want to adjust, such as Stroke or Transparency.
Figure 13-1:

Styles pane
and its
palette
menu.
184
Part III: Object Essentials 

Be sure to select the Preview option to see the results of object styles on the
currently selected object. Of course, you need to make sure that the object is
visible on-screen to see those effects.
When you open the New Object Style dialog box, you see the General pane,
which lets you create a new style based on an existing object style (by using
the Based On pop-up menu), and which lets you assign a keyboard shortcut
for fast application of this style (by using the Shortcuts field).
You can use the Based On feature to create families of object styles. For
example, you can create a style called Photo-Standard for the bulk of your
placed photographs, and then create variations such as Photo-Sidebar and
Photo-Author. The Photo-Standard style might specify a hairline black stroke
around the photo, while Photo-Sidebar might change that to a white stroke.
But if you later decide you want the stroke to be 1 point and change it in
Photo-Standard, Photo-Sidebar automatically gets the 1-point stroke while
retaining the white color.
The General pane also lets you see the current style settings. Click any of the
arrows in the Style Settings section to get more details on how they are set
for this object style.
The other panes in the New Object Styles dialog box provide the same capa-
bilities that you find elsewhere in InDesign, brought into one convenient
place so you can use them in styles. These panes are:
 The Fill pane lets you set colors for fills using whatever colors are defined
in the Swatches pane. You can also set the tint and, if you select a gradient
fill, the angle for that gradient. Finally, you can choose to have the fill over-
print the contents of the frame by selecting the Overprint Fill option.

dialog box

Chapter 13: Organizing Objects

 The Stroke pane is identical to the Fill pane except that options specific
to fills are grayed out, and options available to strokes are made available.
The color, tint, and gradient angle options are the same as for the Fill
pane. You can also choose the type of stroke (solid line, dashed line, or
dotted line) by using the Type pop-up menu, and adjust the thickness by
filling in the Weight field. You can also choose to overprint the stroke over
underlying content, plus determine — if your stroke is a dotted or dashed
line — the color, tint, and overprint for the gap.
 The Stroke & Corner Effects pane lets you set stroke position and how
corners and line ends are handled. It also lets you apply fancy corners to
frames. The Stroke Effects section is where you align the strokes to the
frame edges, determine how lines join at corners, and decide what line
endings are applied. The Corner Effects section is where you select from
five fancy corners, such as Bevel and Rounded, by using the Effect pop-
up menu, and where you specify the radius, or reach, of the corner by
using the Size field. (See Chapter 12 for the low-down on stroke and
corner effects.)
 The Transparency pane controls an object’s opacity, with 0 percent
being invisible and 100 percent being completely solid. The Mode pop-
up menu lets you select the transparency effect. The Isolate Blending
and Knockout Group options affect how transparency affects other
objects in specific cases. (See Chapter 12 for details.)
 The Drop Shadow & Feather pane controls two types of lighting effects
for objects: drop shadows and feathering, which are discussed in
Chapter 12.
 The Paragraph Styles pane controls what paragraph style, if any, is
applied to text in the frame. Chances are you won’t use this setting
except for frames that contain only consistent, very simple text, such as
pull-quotes or bios. (See Chapter 17 for details.)
 The Text Frame General Options pane controls how text is handled
within a frame. This essentially replicates the controls in the General
pane of the Text Box Options dialog box (Object➪Text Frame Options or
Ô+B or Ctrl+B), including number of columns, column width, gutter set-
tings, inset spacing (how far from the frame edge text is placed), vertical
justification (how text is aligned vertically in the frame), and whether
text wrap settings are ignored when this frame overlaps other frames.
(See Chapter 15 for details.)
 The Text Frame Baseline Options pane controls how text is handled
within a frame. This essentially replicates the controls in the Baseline
Options pane of the Text Box Options dialog box (Object➪Text Frame
Options or Ô+B or Ctrl+B), including how the text baseline is calculated
for the frame and whether the text frame gets its own baseline grid. (See
Chapter 11 for details.)
186
Part III: Object Essentials 

 The Story Options pane enables optical margin alignment — its controls
are the same as the Story pane (Window➪Type & Tables➪Story), dis-
cussed in Chapter 18. Optical margin alignment adjusts the placement of
text along the left side of a frame so the text alignment is more visually
pleasing.
 The Text Wrap & Other pane lets you set text wrap, mirroring the fea-
tures of the Text Wrap pane (Window➪Text Wrap or Option+Ô+W or
Ctrl+Alt+W, discussed in Chapter 18), as well as make an object non-
printing (normally handled through the Attributes pane by choosing
Window➪Attributes).
 The Anchored Object Options pane lets you set the attributes for inline
and anchored frames, mirroring the controls in the Anchored Object
Options dialog box (Object➪Anchored Object➪Options), which is cov-
ered later in this chapter.
Managing object styles
The Object Styles pane’s palette menu (refer to Figure 13-1) has several
options for managing object styles:
 Duplicate Object Style: Click an object style’s name and then choose
this menu option to create an exact copy. If you want to create an object
style that’s similar to one you already created, you might want to choose
New Object Style rather than Duplicate Object Style, and then use the
Based On option to create a child of the original. If you choose Duplicate
Object Style, the copy is identical to, but not based on, the original; if
you modify the original, the copy is not affected.
 Delete Object Style: Choose this to delete selected object styles. To
select multiple styles, press and hold Ô or Ctrl as you click their names.
To select a range of styles, click the first one, and then press and hold
Shift and click the last one. You can also delete styles by selecting them
in the pane and then clicking the Delete Selected Styles (trashcan icon)
at the bottom of the pane.
 Redefine Object Style: To modify an existing object style, first make
changes to an object that already has an object style defined for it, and
then select Redefine Object Style. The newly applied formats are applied
to the object style.
 Object Style Options: This option lets you modify an existing object
style. When a style is highlighted in the Object Styles pane, choosing
Object Style Options displays the Object Style Options dialog box, which
is identical to the New Object Style dialog box covered earlier.
187
Chapter 13: Organizing Objects

 Load Object Styles: Choose this option if you want to import object
styles from another InDesign document. After selecting the document
from which to import the styles, you will get a dialog box listing the
styles in the chosen document, so you can decide which ones to import.
Note the Incoming Style Definitions window at the bottom of the dialog
box; it lists the style definitions to help you decide which to import, as
well as which to overwrite or rename.
 Select All Unused: Select this option to highlight the names of all object
styles that have not been applied to any objects in the current docu-
ment. This is a handy way of identifying unused styles in preparation for
deleting them (by choosing the Delete Object Style menu option).
 Sort by Name: This option alphabetizes your object styles for easier
access. (InDesign adds styles to the Object Styles pane in the order in
which they were created.)
 Small Palette Rows: Select this option to reduce the text size in the
Object Styles pane. Although harder to read, a pane with this option
selected lets you access more styles without having to scroll. To return
the pane to its normal text size, deselect this option.
InDesign comes with three predefined object styles — [Normal Text Frame],
[Normal Graphics Frame], and [Normal Grid] — that you can modify as desired.
Applying object styles
After you create an object style, applying it is easy. Just click an object and
then click the object style name in the Object Styles pane or press its key-
board shortcut. (Windows users must make sure Num Lock is on when using
shortcuts for styles.)
188
Part III: Object Essentials 
The Quick Apply option
Another way to apply object styles is by using the
new Quick Apply palette. Quick Apply is a con-
solidated list of styles that you access by choos-
ing Edit➪Quick Apply or by pressing Ô+Return or
Ctrl+Enter. If you select an object, the Quick Apply
palette presents all available paragraph, charac-
ter, and object styles in an alphabetical list. You
can scroll down to the one you want or type the
first few letters of the style name in the text field
at the top to jump to styles beginning with those
letters, then navigate to the one you want and
press Return or Enter, which brings you back to
where you were working with your object and
closes the Quick Apply palette.
This feature is handy if you’re working on lay-
outs from your keyboard — perhaps you’re a
layout artist working on a notebook while com-
muting. You can switch to the Quick Apply
palette, apply the style, and return to your object
or text, all without touching the mouse.

You can set which object styles are automatically used for new text and graph-
ics frames: In the Object Styles pane’s palette menu, choose Default Text Frame
Style and select the desired style from the submenu to set a default text frame;
choose Default Graphics Frame Style and select the desired style from the sub-
menu to set a default graphics frame. To no longer have object styles automati-
cally applied to new objects, choose [None] in the Default Text Frame and/or
Default Graphics Frame submenus.
How existing formatting is handled
When you apply an object style to selected objects, all local formats are
retained. All other formats are replaced by those of the applied style — that
is, unless you do one of the following:
 If you press and hold Option or Alt when clicking a name in the Object
Styles pane, any local formatting that has been applied to the objects is
removed. You can achieve the same effect by choosing Clear Attributes
Not Defined by Style from the Object Styles pane’s palette menu or by
clicking the Clear Attributes Not Defined by Style button at the bottom
of the Object Styles pane.
 If you want to override any local changes with the settings in the object
style, choose Clear Overrides in the palette menu or click the Clear
Overrides button at the bottom of the Object Styles pane. The difference
is that Clear Attributes Not Defined by Style removes all attributes for
which the object style contains no settings, while Clear Overrides
imposes the object style’s settings over conflicting attributes that you
set manually.
If a plus sign (+) appears to the right of an object style’s name, it means that
the object has local formats that differ from those of the applied object style.
This can occur if you apply an object style to object text to which you’ve done
some manual formatting, or if you modify formatting for an object after apply-
ing an object style to it. (For example, you may have changed the fill color;
that is a local change to the object style and will cause the + to appear.)
Removing an object style from an object
To remove a style from an object, choose Break Link to Style from the Object
Styles pane’s palette menu. The object’s current formatting won’t be affected,
but it will no longer be updated when the object style is changed.
Creating Inline and Anchored Frames
In most cases, you want the frames you place on your pages to remain pre-
cisely where you put them. But sometimes, you want to place frames relative
to related text in such a way that the frames move when the text is edited. For
example, if you’re creating a product catalog that’s essentially a continuous
189
Chapter 13: Organizing Objects

list of product descriptions and you want to include a graphic with each
description, you can paste graphics within the text to create inline graphics
frames.
A close cousin to the inline frame is the anchored frame, in which a frame fol-
lows a point in the text, but that frame is not actually in the text. For example,
you might have a “For More Information” sidebar that you want to appear to
the left of the text that first mentions a term. By using an anchored frame,
you can have that sidebar move with the text so it always appears to its left,
perhaps in an adjacent column or in the page margins.
Figure 13-3 shows examples of both an inline frame and an anchored frame.
Note that the process of creating inline and anchored frames — especially
anchored frames — can appear overwhelming. It does require thinking through
the frame’s placement and visualizing that placement so you pick the right
options in the various dialog boxes. But relax: You can experiment until you get
the hang of it. That’s why InDesign lets you undo your work.
Working with inline frames
An inline frame is treated like a single character. If you insert or delete text
that precedes an inline frame, the frame moves forward or backward along
with the rest of the text that follows the inserted or deleted text. Although
inline frames usually contain graphics, they can just as easily contain text or
nothing at all.

box is

Part III: Object Essentials 

Inline frames may interfere with line spacing in paragraphs that have automatic
leading. If the inline frame is larger than the point size in use, the automatic
leading value for that line is calculated from the inline frame. This leads to
inconsistent line spacing in the paragraph. To work around this, you can apply
a fixed amount of leading to all characters in the paragraph, adjust the size 
of inline frames, place inline frames at the beginning of a paragraph, or place
inline frames in their own paragraphs.
There are three ways to create inline frames: pasting the frame into text, plac-
ing the frame into text, and using the new Anchored Object menu option. The
first two are the simplest, but the third gives you more control over the inline
frame when you create it. The third way also lets you create anchored frames,
which are covered later in this chapter.
Using the Paste command
If you want to create an inline frame from an object you already created, all
you have to do is copy or cut the object and then paste it into text as you
would a piece of highlighted text. Here’s how:
1. Use the Selection tool to select the object you want to paste within text.
Any type of object can be used: a line, an empty shape, a text or picture
frame, even a group of objects.
2. Choose Edit➪Copy or press Ô+C or Ctrl+C.
If you don’t need the original item, you can use the Cut command (Edit➪
Cut or Ô+X or Ctrl+X) instead of the Copy command.
3. Select the Type tool and then click within the text where you want to
place the copied object.
Make sure the cursor is flashing where you intend to place the inline
frame.
4. Choose Edit➪Paste or press Ô+V or Ctrl+V.
Inline frames often work best when placed at the beginning of a paragraph. If
you place an inline frame within text to which automatic leading has been
applied, the resulting line spacing can be inconsistent. To fix this problem,
you can resize the inline frame.
Using the Place command
You can also use the Place command to create an inline graphics frame from
an external picture file. (You can’t use this technique for inline text frames.)
Here’s how:
1. Select the Type tool and then click within a text frame to establish the
insertion point.
2. Choose File➪Place or press Ô+D or Ctrl+D.
191
Chapter 13: Organizing Objects

3. Locate and select the graphics file you want to place within the text;
then click Choose or Open.
To delete an inline frame, you can select it and then choose Edit➪Clear or
Edit➪Cut, or you can position the cursor next to it and press Delete or
Backspace.
Adjusting inline frames
After you create an inline frame, you can adjust its position vertically or hori-
zontally. Again, there are several methods.
Two quick-and-dirty methods to move an inline frame vertically are as follows:
 Use the Type tool to highlight the inline frame as you would highlight an
individual text character. In the Character pane or Control palette, type
a positive value in the Baseline Shift field to move the inline frame up;
type a negative value to move the frame down.
 Use the Selection tool or Direct Selection tool to select the inline frame;
then drag the frame up or down.
A quick way to move an inline frame horizontally is to follow these steps:
1. With the Type tool selected, click between the inline frame and the
character that precedes it.
2. Use the kerning controls in the Character pane or Control palette to
enlarge or reduce the space between the inline frame and the preced-
ing character.
You can more precisely control the position of inline frames by using the
Anchored Object Options dialog box, covered in the next section.
Of course, you can also adjust its other attributes as needed, such as strokes,
fills, dimensions, rotation, and skew, by using the Tools palette, Control
palette, and other panes.
Working with anchored frames
Anchored frames give you a whole new way of organizing objects. Essentially,
they follow the relevant text within the parameters you specify, such as staying
to the left of the text or staying at the top of the page that contains the text.
Note that an inline frame is a type of anchored frame, one where the frame
stays within the text it is linked to. For simplicity, we’re using the term
anchored frame to mean only those frames that are outside the text frame but
remain linked to a specific point in the text.
192
Part III: Object Essentials 

Anchored frames are new to InDesign CS2. Not only can you create them, but
InDesign CS2 now retains anchored frames set up in Microsoft Word documents.
It also preserves anchored frames when exporting as Rich Text Format.
To create anchored frames, do the following:
1. Select the Type tool and then click within a text frame to establish the
insertion point.
2. Choose Object➪Anchored Object➪Insert.
The Insert Anchored Object dialog box appears.
3. In the Object Options section of the dialog box, specify the anchored
frame’s settings.
You can choose the type of frame (text, graphics, or unassigned) with
the Content pop-up menu, apply an object style by using the Object
Style pop-up menu, apply a paragraph style via the Paragraph Style pop-
up menu, and set the anchored frame’s dimensions in the Height and
Width fields. Note that the Paragraph Style you choose, if any, applies to
the anchored frame, not to the paragraph in which the anchored frame
is linked. InDesign lets you apply a paragraph style to the anchored
frame even if it contains no text.
4. In the Position pop-up menu, choose what kind of frame you are creat-
ing: Inline or Above Line (both are inline frames) or Custom (an
anchored frame).
The dialog box will show different options based on that choice, as
Figure 13-4 shows.
Anchored frames added by choosing Object➪Anchored Object➪Insert
do not have text automatically wrapped around them. Use the Text Wrap
pane (Window➪Text Wrap or Option+Ô+W or Ctrl+Alt+W) to open this
pane and set text wrap. But anchored frames created by pasting a
graphic into text do automatically have text wrap around them.
Selecting the Prevent Manual Positioning option ensures that the posi-
tions of individual anchored frames can’t be adjusted by using
InDesign’s other text and frame controls (such as Baseline Shift). This
forces users to use this dialog box to change the anchored frame’s posi-
tion, reducing the chances of accidental change.
5. Decide whether to select the Relative to Spine option.
If this option is not selected, the anchored frame is placed on the same
side of the text frame on all pages, whether those pages are left-facing or
right-facing. If the Relative to Spine option is selected, InDesign places
the text frame on the outside of both pages or inside of both pages,
depending on how the anchored position is set.
193
Chapter 13: Organizing Objects

6. In the Anchored Object section of the dialog box, click one of the posi-
tioning squares to set up the text frame’s relative position.
Note that you need to think about both the horizontal and vertical posi-
tion you desire. For example, if you want the anchored frame to appear
to the right of the text reference, click one of the right-hand squares.
(Remember that selecting the Relative to Spine option overrides this,
making the right-hand pages’ positions mirror that of the left-hand
pages, rather than be identical to them.) If you choose the topmost
right-hand square, the anchored frame is placed to the right of the text
reference and vertically appears at or below that text reference. But if
you choose the bottommost right-hand square, you’re telling InDesign
you want the anchored frame to appear vertically above the text refer-
ence. Experiment with your layout to see what works best in each case.
7. In the Anchored Position section of the dialog box, click one of the
positioning squares to set up the text reference’s relative position.
Although there are nine squares shown, the only three that matter are
those in the middle row. Typically, you place the text reference on the
opposite side of the anchored frame — if you want the anchored frame to
be to the left, you would indicate that the text reference is to the right. 
(If you set the text reference on the same side as the anchored frame,
InDesign places the anchored frame over the text.) The reason there are
three squares (left, middle, and right) is to accommodate layouts in which
Figure 13-4:
The Insert

Object
dialog box

frames (left)
and
anchored
frames
(right).
194
Part III: Object Essentials 

you want some anchored frames to appear to the left of the text and some
to the right; in that case, choose the middle position here and select the
right- or left-hand position in the Anchored Object section as appropriate
to that object.
8. There are three options in the Anchored Position section that give
InDesign more precise instructions on how to place the anchored
frames:
• The X Relative To pop-up menu tells InDesign from where the hor-
izontal location is calculated, using the following options: Anchor
Marker, Column Edge, Text Frame, Page Margin, and Page Edge.
The right option depends both on where you want the anchored
frames placed and whether you have multicolumn text boxes (in
which case Text Frame and Column Edge result in different place-
ment, while in a single-column text frame they do not). You can
also specify a specific amount of space to place between the
chosen X Relative To point and the anchored frame by typing a
value in the X Offset field.
• The Y Relative To pop-up menu tells InDesign from where the ver-
tical location is calculated, using the following options: Line
(Baseline), Line (Cap-height), Line (Top of Leading), Column Edge,
Text Frame, Page Margin, and Page Edge. As you expect, you can
also indicate a specific amount of space to place between the
chosen Y Relative To point and the anchored frame by typing a
value in the Y Offset field.
• The Keep Within Top/Bottom Column boundaries check box
does exactly what it says.
9. Click OK to insert the anchored frame.
You can create inline frames using the same basic process as above, choos-
ing Inline or Above Line in Step 4. You’ll get most of the same controls as for
anchored objects, such as the frame size and type, but of course there are
no controls for the relative position, since an inline frame goes at the text-
insertion point. But it’s easier to use the techniques described in the previ-
ous section for creating inline frames: copying or placing a frame into text.
Converting existing frames to anchored frames
After you get the hang of when and how to use anchored frames, you’ll likely
want to convert some frames in existing documents into anchored frames.
There’s no direct way to do that in InDesign, but there is a somewhat circuitous
path you can take:
1. Use the Selection or Direct Selection tool to cut the existing frame that
you want to make into an anchored frame by choosing Edit➪Cut or by
pressing Ô+X or Ctrl+X.
You can also copy an existing frame by choosing Edit➪Copy or by press-
ing Ô+C or Ctrl+C.
195
Chapter 13: Organizing Objects

2. Switch to the Type tool and click in a text frame at the desired loca-
tion to insert the text reference to the anchored frame.
3. Paste the cut or copied frame into that insertion point by choosing
Edit➪Paste or by pressing Ô+V or Ctrl+V.
You now have an inline frame.
4. Select the frame with the Selection tool, then choose Object➪Anchored
Object➪Options to display the Anchored Object Options dialog box.
This dialog box looks like the Insert Anchored Options dialog box,
shown in Figure 13-4, except that it doesn’t include the top Object
Options section.
5. Choose Custom from the Position pop-up menu.
This converts the frame from an inline frame to an anchored frame.
6. Adjust the position for the newly minted anchored frame as described
in the previous section.
7. Click OK when you’re done.
196
Part III: Object Essentials 
Anchoring caveats
There are several caveats to consider when
creating anchored frames:
 Because an anchored frame follows its text
as it flows throughout a document, you
need to ensure that your layout retains
clear paths for those anchored objects to
follow. Otherwise, anchored frames could
overlap other frames as they move.
 Anchored frames should generally be small
items and/or used sparingly. The more items
you have anchored to text, the greater the
chance that they will interfere with each
other’s placement. Likewise, large items
can be moved only so far within a page, so
the benefit of keeping them close to their
related text disappears.
 Items such as pull-quotes are obvious candi-
dates for use as anchored frames. But in
many layouts, you want the pull-quotes to
stay in specific locations on the page for good
visual appearance. The InDesign anchored-
frame function can accommodate that need
for specific positioning on a page, but you
need to be careful as you add or delete text
so that you do not end up with some pages
that have no pull-quotes at all because there
is so much text between the pull-quotes’
anchor points. Conversely, you need to make
sure you don’t have too many pull-quotes
anchored close to each other, which could
result in overlapping.
Typically, you use anchored frames for small
graphics or icons that you want to keep next to
a specific paragraph (such as the Tip and
Warning icons used in this book). Another good
use would be for cross-reference (“For More
Information”) text frames.

Adjusting anchored frames
After you create an anchored frame, you can adjust its position.
A quick-and-dirty method is simply to click and drag anchored frames or use
the Control palette or Transform pane to adjust their position. If the text the
frame is anchored to moves, however, InDesign overrides those changes. (You
can’t manually move an anchored frame if the Prevent Manual Positioning
option is selected in the Insert Anchored Object dialog box or Anchored
Object Options dialog box. This option is deselected by default.)
For the most control of an anchored frame’s position, choose Object➪
Anchored Object➪Options. The resulting Anchored Object Options dialog
box is identical to the Insert Anchored Object dialog box (covered previ-
ously in this section and shown in Figure 13-4) but without the Object Options
section.
And, of course, you can adjust the frame’s other attributes as needed, such
as strokes, fills, dimensions, rotation, and skew.
Releasing and deleting anchored frames
If you no longer want an anchored frame to be anchored to a text location,
you can release the anchor. To do so, select the anchored frame with the
Selection or Direct Selection tool and then choose Object➪Anchored
Object➪Release.
It’s also easy to delete an anchored frame: Select the frame with the Selection
or Direct Selection tool and then choose Edit➪Clear or press Delete or
Backspace. If you want to remove the object but keep it on the Clipboard for
pasting elsewhere, choose Edit➪Cut or press Ô+X or Ctrl+X.
Combining Objects into a Group
InDesign lets you combine several objects into a group. A group of objects
behaves like a single object, which means that you can cut, copy, move, or
modify all the objects in a group in a single operation.
To create a group, select all the objects (which can include other groups)
that you want to include in your group and then choose Object➪Group or
press Ô+G or Ctrl+G.
Groups have many uses. For example, you might create a group to:
 Combine several objects that make up an illustration so that you can
move, modify, copy, or scale all objects in a single operation.
197
Chapter 13: Organizing Objects

 Keep a graphics frame and its accompanying caption (text) frame
together so that, if you change your mind about their placement, you
can reposition both objects at once.
 Combine several vertical lines that are used to separate the columns of a
table so that you can quickly change the stroke, color, length, and posi-
tion of all lines.
If you want to manipulate a group, choose the Selection tool and then click
any object in the group. The group’s bounding box appears. Any transforma-
tion you perform is applied to all objects in the group. If you want to manipu-
late a specific object in a group, use the Direct Selection tool. (See Chapter 12
for more details on selecting objects within groups.)
If you create a group from objects on different layers, all objects are moved to
the top layer and stacked in succession beneath the topmost object.
You cannot create a group if some of the selected objects are locked and
some are not locked. All selected objects must be locked or unlocked before
you can group them. (Locking and unlocking objects are covered in the fol-
lowing section.)
After creating a group, you may eventually decide that you want to return the
objects to their original, ungrouped state. To do so, simply click any object in
the group with the Selection tool and then choose Object➪Ungroup or press
Shift+Ô+G or Ctrl+Shift+G. If you ungroup a group that contains a group, the
contained group is not affected. To ungroup this group, you must select it
and choose Ungroup again.
Locking Objects
If you’re certain that you want a particular object to remain exactly where it
is, you can select Object➪Lock Position or press Ô+L or Ctrl+L to prevent the
object from being moved. Generally, you want to lock repeating elements
such as headers, footers, folios, and page numbers so that they’re not acci-
dentally moved. (Such repeating elements are usually placed on a master
page; you can lock objects on master pages, too.)
A locked object can’t be moved whether you click and drag it with the mouse
or change the values in the X: and Y: fields in the Control palette or Transform
pane. Not only can you not move a locked object, you can’t delete it, either.
However, you can change other attributes of a locked object, including its
stroke and fill.
To unlock a selected object, choose Object➪Unlock Position or press
Option+Ô+L or Ctrl+Alt+L.
You can also lock entire layers, as described in Chapter 7.
198
Part III: Object Essentials 

Stacking Objects
Each time you begin work on a new page, you start with a clean slate (unless
the page is based on a master page, in which case the master objects act as the
page’s background; see Chapter 8 for more on master pages). Every time you
add an object to a page — either by using any of InDesign’s object-creation
tools or with the Place command (File➪Place or Ô+D or Ctrl+D) — the new
object occupies a unique place in the page’s object hierarchy, or stacking order.
The first object you place on a page is automatically positioned at the bottom
of the stacking order; the next object is positioned one level higher than the
first object (that is, in front of the backmost object); the next object is stacked
one level higher; and so on for every object you add to the page. (It’s not
uncommon for a page to have several dozen or even several hundred layers.)
Although each object occupies its own level, if the objects on a page don’t
overlap, then the stacking order is not an issue. But some of the most interest-
ing graphic effects you can achieve with InDesign involve arranging several
overlapping objects, so it’s important to be aware of the three-dimensional
nature of a page’s stacking order.
You may change your mind about what you want to achieve in your layout
after you’ve already placed objects in it. To change an object’s position in a
page’s stacking order, use the Arrange command (Object➪Arrange), which
offers four choices:
 Bring to Front (Shift+Ô+] or Ctrl+Shift+])
 Bring Forward (Ô+] or Ctrl+])
 Send Backward (Ô+[ or Ctrl+[)
 Send to Back (Shift+Ô+[ or Ctrl+Shift+[)
To select an object that’s hidden behind one or more other objects, press and
hold Ô or Ctrl and then click anywhere within the area of the hidden object.
The first click selects the topmost object; each successive click selects the
next lowest object in the stacking order. When the bottom object is selected,
the next click selects the top object. If you don’t know where a hidden object
is, you can simply click the object or objects in front of it, then send the
object(s) to the back.
Sharing Objects among Documents
Often, you want to use an object from one InDesign layout in another
InDesign document. It’s really easy to do. Choose from any of these methods,
all of which preserve the object’s attributes, including styles:
199
Chapter 13: Organizing Objects

 The simplest method is to select an object with the Selection tool and
drag it into another document. This copies the object to the target docu-
ment. You need to have both documents open and to have at least some
portion of each document visible so that there’s a place to drag the
object to.
 You can use copy and paste or cut and paste to copy or move an object.
 You can place objects in a library for use in other documents. (See
Chapter 8 for more on libraries.)
 You can drag an object onto the desktop or onto any folder, which creates
a snippet file that you can then drag into another InDesign document. This
is sort of like having a one-item library.

etting words on the page is an important part of what
you do with InDesign. After you have the words in
place, you want to tweak the letters and lines, and the
space between them, to make your pages sparkle. This part
shows you how to arrange words on the page. You find out
how to set text in columns, and how to add bullets and
numbers to that text. You also find out how to stretch,
squeeze, rotate, and add color to text. Additionally, you see
how to become skilled at using character and paragraph
styles to make your life easier and to speed up your pub-
lishing workflow.

or most publications, text conveys the essential messages to the readers.
Often, that text will be imported from another program, so this chapter
explains how to work with imported text and its formatting to achieve the
smoothest import process possible.
Whether you import text or type it into text frames directly in InDesign, you’ll
appreciate the tools that let you search and replace, spell-check, hyphenate,
and edit your text. You’ll learn all about these capabilities here, too.
InDesign works with text inside frames — containers for the copy, as
described in Chapter 10. You can create a text frame in advance or let
InDesign create it for you when you import text.
Importing Text
You can import text from a word processor file (Word 97/98 or later, RTF,
ASCII [text-only], or InDesign Tagged Text files) into an InDesign text frame
using the Place dialog box (File➪Place, or Ô+D or Ctrl+D). Many of the text’s
original styles will remain intact, although you will want to review the
imported text carefully to see if any adjustments need to be made.
Follow these steps to place imported text:
1. Choose File➪Place, or press Ô+D or Ctrl+D to open the Place 
dialog box.

2. Locate the text file you want to import.
3. To specify how to handle current formatting in the file, check the
Show Import Options check box.
This opens the appropriate Import Options dialog box for the text file’s
format. (Note that there are no import options for ASCII text.) Then click
OK to return to the Place dialog box.
4. Click the Open button to import the text.
5. If you selected an empty frame with the Type tool, InDesign will flow
the text into that frame. If you selected a text frame with the Type
tool, InDesign will flow the text at the text-insertion point in that
frame, inserting the new text within the existing text.
If you hadn’t already selected a frame before starting to import the text,
specify where to place it by clicking and dragging the loaded-text icon to
create a rectangular text frame, clicking in an existing frame, or clicking
in any empty frame.
You can’t click on a master text frame — a text frame that is placed on the
page by the master page in use — and simply start typing. To select a master
text frame and add text to it, Shift+Ô+click or Ctrl+Shift+click it. (For more on
master pages, see Chapter 8.)
Import options for Microsoft Word 
and RTF files
InDesign offers a comprehensive set of import options for Word and RTF files.
With these options, you can control how these files will import into an
InDesign. To save time on future imports, you can save your import prefer-
ences as a preset file for repeat use.
Figure 14-1 shows the Microsoft Word Import Options dialog box. The import
options for RTF files are identical.
The Preset pop-up menu, at the top of the page, lets you select from saved
sets of import options. You can save the current settings by clicking the Save
Preset button. And you can set a preset as the default import behavior by
clicking the Save as Default button; these settings will be used for all Word
file imports unless you choose a new default or make changes in this dialog
box. This lets you avoid using the Import Options dialog box for your routine
imports.
The ability to save import presets is new to InDesign CS2, and is available
only for Word and RTF import.
204
Part IV: Text Essentials 

The Include section of the Import Options dialog box is where you decide
whether to strip out specific types of text (Table of Contents Text, Index text,
Footnotes, and Endnotes) from the Word file. If you check items, their corre-
sponding text will be imported. You probably won’t want to import table-of-
contents or index text because you can create much nicer-looking tables of
contents and indexes in InDesign.
The third section, Options, has just one option: Use Typographer’s Quotes. If
this box is checked, InDesign converts keyboard quotes from your source file
(' and ") to “curly” typographic quotes (‘, ’, “, and ”).
The fourth section, Formatting, is fairly complex, so you’ll want to leave it
alone unless you know what you’re doing.
To remove text formatting during import so that you can do the formatting in
InDesign, select the Remove Styles and Formatting from Text and Tables
option. You have two additional controls for this option:
 Preserve Local Overrides, which will retain local formatting such as italics
and boldface while ignoring the paragraph style attributes. You’d usually
want this option checked so that meaning-related formatting is retained.
 You also can choose how tables are “unformatted” during import via the
Convert Tables To pop-up menu. Unformatted Tables retains the table’s
cell structure but ignores text and cell formatting, while Unformatted
Tabbed Text converts the table to tabbed text (with a tab separating
what used to be cells and a paragraph return separating what used to be
rows) and strips out any formatting. If you intend to keep tables as
tables but format them in InDesign, choose Unformatted Tables.
Figure 14-1:
The Import
Options
dialog 
box for a
Word file.
205
Chapter 14: The Ins and Outs of Text

The two controls for handling “unformatting” are new to InDesign CS2.
To retain text formatting during import, so that the InDesign document at
least starts out using the settings used in Word, choose the Preserve Styles
and Formatting from Text and Tables option. This option includes several
controls and bits of information (all of these options are new to InDesign CS2
except for the Manual Breaks pop-up menu):
 The Manual Page Breaks pop-up menu lets you retain any page breaks
entered in Word, convert them to column breaks, or strip them out.
 Checking the Import Inline Graphics check box will enable the import of
any graphics in the Word text.
 Checking the Import Unused Styles check box means that all Word style
sheets will transfer into InDesign, rather than just the ones you actually
applied to text in the file. Unless you want all those extra Word styles,
keep this box unchecked.
 If InDesign detects that the Word file has a style with the same name as
your InDesign document, it will note how many to the right of the Style
Name Conflicts label. You have choices in how to handle these conflicts:
• Use InDesign Style Definition preserves the current InDesign style
sheets and applies them to any text in Word that uses a style sheet
of the same name. Redefine InDesign Style causes the Word style
sheet’s formatting to permanently replace that of InDesign’s corre-
sponding style sheet. Auto Rename renames the Word file’s style
sheet adds it to the Paragraph Styles or Character Styles pane.
This preserves your existing InDesign styles while also preserving
those imported from the Word file.
• Customize Style Import lets you decide which specific InDesign
styles override same-name Word styles sheet, which Word styles
sheet override same-name InDesign styles, and which Word styles
sheet are renamed during import to prevent any overriding.
Import options for Microsoft Excel files
When importing Excel spreadsheets, you have several options, as Figure 14-2
shows.
In the Options section, you can control the following settings:
 The Sheet pop-up menu lets you choose which sheet in an Excel work-
book to import. The default is the first sheet, which is usually named
Sheet1 unless you renamed it in Excel. (If you want to import several
sheets, you’ll need to import the same spreadsheet several times, choos-
ing a different sheet each time.)
206
Part IV: Text Essentials 

 The View pop-up menu lets you import custom views that are defined in
Excel for that spreadsheet. If the spreadsheet has no custom views, this
pop-up menu is grayed out. You can also ignore any custom views by
choosing [Ignore View] from the pop-up menu.
 In the Cell Range pop-up menu, you specify a range of cells using standard
Excel notation Sx:Ey, where S is the first row, x the first column, E the
last row, and y the last column, such as A1:G35. You can enter a range
directly in the pop-up menu, which also acts as a text-entry field, or
choose a previously entered range from the pop-up menu.
 Checking the Import Hidden Cells Not Saved in View check box will import
hidden cells. Be careful when doing so, because these cells are usually
hidden for a reason (typically, they show interim calculations and the like).
In the Formatting section, you can control the following settings:
 In the Table pop-up menu, you choose from Formatted Table, which
imports the spreadsheet as a table and retains text and cell formatting,
Unformatted Table, which imports the spreadsheet as a table but does
not preserve formatting, and Unformatted Tabbed Text, which imports
the spreadsheet as tabbed text (tabs separate cells and paragraph
returns separate rows) with no formatting retained.
 In the Cell Alignment pop-up menu, you tell InDesign how to align the
text in cells. You can retain the spreadsheet’s current alignment settings
by choosing Current Spreadsheet, or override them by choosing Left,
Right, or Center.
 Checking the Include Inline Graphics check box imports any graphics
placed in the Excel cells.
 The Number of Decimal Places to Include field is where you enter how
many decimal places to retain for numbers.
 Check the Use Typographer’s Quotes check box to convert keyboard
quotes (' and ") to the “curly” typographic quotes (‘, ’, “, and ”). It’s a
good idea to keep this box checked.

Chapter 14: The Ins and Outs of Text

Pasting text into an InDesign document
As you probably already know, you can hold text on the Mac or Windows
Clipboard by cutting it or copying it from its original location. After you’ve
captured some text on the Clipboard, you can paste it into an InDesign docu-
ment at the location of the cursor. You can also replace highlighted text with
the text that’s on the Clipboard. If no text frame is active when you do the
pasting, InDesign creates a new text frame to contain the pasted text.
InDesign uses standard menu commands and keyboard commands for cutting/
copying text to the Clipboard, and for pasting text. On the Mac, press Ô+X to
cut, Ô+C to copy, and Ô+V to paste. In Windows, press Ctrl+X to cut, Ctrl+C
to copy, and Ctrl+V to paste.
Text that is cut or copied from InDesign normally retains its formatting, while
text pasted from other programs loses its formatting. Text pasted from other
programs always retains its special characters such as curly quotes, em
dashes, and accented characters.
In InDesign CS2, you can specify whether pasted text from other programs
always retains its formatting. Go to the Type pane in the Preferences dialog
box (choose InDesign➪Preferences on the Mac or Edit➪Preferences in
Windows, or press Ô+K or Ctrl+K) and select the All Information option in
the When Pasting Text and Tables from Other Applications section. If you
select this option, you can tell InDesign to not preserve the formatting by
choosing Edit➪Paste without Formatting (Shift+Ô+V or Ctrl+Shift+V) for
those times you want the text to use InDesign’s local formatting instead of the
original formatting.
208
Part IV: Text Essentials 
Keep characters to a minimum
When you’re working with text in a professional
publishing application, such as InDesign, you
need to keep in mind some differences between
the professional method and traditional way of
typing:
 Remember that you don’t need to type two
spaces after a period or colon; books,
newspapers, magazines, and other profes-
sional documents all use just one space
after such punctuation.
 Don’t enter extra paragraph returns for
space between paragraphs and don’t enter
tabs to indent paragraphs — instead, set up
this formatting using InDesign’s paragraph
attributes (Type➪Paragraph, or Option+
Ô+T or Ctrl+Alt+T).
 To align text in columns, don’t enter extra
tabs; place the same number of tabs
between each column, and then align the
tabs (Type➪Tabs, or Shift+Ô+T or Ctrl+
Shift+T).
To see where your InDesign document has tabs,
paragraph breaks, spaces, and other such invis-
ible characters, use the command Option+Ô+I
or Ctrl+Alt+I, or choose Type➪Show Hidden
Characters.

Dragging and dropping text
You can drag highlighted text from other programs — or even text files from
the desktop or a folder — into an InDesign document. Text that you drag and
drop is inserted at the location of the cursor, replaces highlighted text, or is
placed in a new rectangular text frame.
When you drag and drop a text selection, its original formatting is lost
However, when you drag and drop a text file, the process is more like a text
import: The text retains its formatting and styles. Unlike the Place command
(File➪Place, or Ô+D or Ctrl+D) that imports text, drag and drop does not give
you the option to specify how some of the formatting and styles in the
imported text file are handled.
Editing Text
InDesign offers basic editing capabilities, not unlike those found in a word
processor: cutting and pasting, deleting and inserting text, searching and
replacing of text and text attributes, and spell checking. (Cutting, pasting,
inserting, and deleting text works just like it does for any standard Mac or
Windows program, so we won’t repeat those details for you here.)
To do anything with text, you need to use the Type tool. When the Type tool
is selected, you can click in any empty frame with the Type tool. (If it’s not
already a text frame, it will become one automatically when you click it with
the Type tool.) Or you can click and drag to create a new text frame. You 
can even click in an existing block of text. From this point, start typing to
enter text.
Controlling text view
In many layout views, the text is too small to work with. Generally, you’ll
zoom in around the block of text using the Zoom tool. Select the tool, then
click to zoom in. To zoom out, hold the Option or Alt key when clicking.
Another way to zoom in is to use the keyboard shortcut Ô+= or Ctrl+=. Each
time you use it, the magnification increases. (Zoom out via Ô+– [hyphen] or
Ctrl+– [hyphen].)
In addition to seeing the text larger, zooming in also helps you see the spaces,
tabs, and paragraph returns that exist in the text. Choose Type➪Show Hidden
Characters or press Option+Ô+I or Ctrl+Alt+I to have the nonprinting indica-
tors for those characters display.
209
Chapter 14: The Ins and Outs of Text

Navigating through text
To work at a different text location in your InDesign document, click in a dif-
ferent text frame or another location in the current text frame. You can also
use the four arrow (cursor) keys on the keyboard to move one character to
the right, one character to the left, one line up, or one line down. Add Ô or
Ctrl to the arrow keys to jump one word to the right or left, or one paragraph
up or down. The Home and End keys let you jump to the beginning or end of
a line; add Ô or Ctrl to jump to the beginning or end of a story. (A story is text
within a text frame or that is linked across several text frames.)
Highlighting text
To highlight (or select) text, you can click and drag. Or you can use some
keyboard options. For example, Shift+Ô+right arrow or Ctrl+Shift+right arrow
highlights the next word to the right. Likewise, Shift+Ô+End or Ctrl+Shift+End
highlights all the text to the end of the story.
To highlight a word, double-click (this will not select its punctuation) and
triple-click to select the entire paragraph. If you’re highlighting a word and
also want to include the punctuation that follows the word, double-click, then
press Shift+Ô+right arrow or Ctrl+Shift+right arrow to extend the selection.
To select an entire story, choose Edit➪Select All, or press Ô+A or Ctrl+A.
To deselect text, choose Edit➪Deselect All or press Shift+Ô+A or Ctrl+
Shift+A. An even easier way to deselect text is simply to select another tool
or click another area of the page.
Undoing text edits
It’s nice to know that InDesign makes it easy for you to change your mind
about text edits. Choose Edit➪Undo and Edit➪Redo any time you change
your mind about edits. The Undo and Redo keyboard commands are defi-
nitely worth remembering: Ô+Z and Shift+Ô+Z or Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Shift+Z.
Using the Story Editor
The Story Editor is a window that lets you see your text without the distrac-
tions of your layout. In it, you see your text without line breaks or other
nonessential formatting — you just see attributes like boldface and italics, as
well as the names of the paragraph styles applied in a separate pane to the
210
Part IV: Text Essentials 

left (see Figure 14-3). After clicking in a text frame, you open the Story Editor
by choosing Edit➪Edit in Story Editor or by pressing Ô+Y or Ctrl+Y.
In the Story Editor, you use the same tools for selection, deletion, copying,
pasting, and search and replace as you would in your layout. The Story
Editor is not a separate word processor; it’s simply a way to look at your text
in a less distracting environment for those times when your mental focus is
on the meaning and words, not the text appearance.
The Story Editor also shows you the column depth for text, using a ruler
along the left side of the text, just to the right of the list of currently applied
paragraph styles. Overset text (text that goes beyond the text frame, or beyond
the final text frame in a threaded story) is indicated by a depth measurement
of OV and is furthermore noted with a red line to the right of the text.
The display of column depth for text and the highlighting of overset text in
the Story Editor are new to InDesign CS2.
Searching and Replacing Text
InDesign has a handy Find/Change feature (Edit➪Find/Change, or Ô+F or Ctrl+F)
that is similar to the search-and-replace features with which you may already
be familiar if you’ve used any word processor or page-layout application.
Figure 14-3:
The Story
Editor.
211
Chapter 14: The Ins and Outs of Text

With the Find/Change dialog box, you can find and change text or you can
extend the search to include attributes. Before starting a Find/Change opera-
tion, determine the scope of your search:
 To search within a text selection, highlight the selection.
 To search from one point in a story to its end, click the cursor at that
beginning location.
 To search an entire story, select any frame or click at any point in a
frame containing the story.
 To search an entire document, simply have that document open.
 To search multiple documents, open all of them (and close any that you
don’t want to search).
Figure 14-4 shows the Find/Change dialog box.
Replacing text
To search for text, follow these steps:
1. Determine the scope of your search and open the appropriate docu-
ments and insert the text cursor at the appropriate location.
2. Choose Edit➪Find/Change or press Ô+F or Ctrl+F.
3. Use the Search pop-up menu, as shown in Figure 14-5 to specify the
scope of your search by choosing All Documents, Document, Story,
End of Story, or Selection.
Which options are available will be based on your current text selection
in InDesign. Unavailable options are grayed out.
4. Type or paste the text you want to find in the Find What field.
5. Type or paste the replacement text into the Change To field.
Figure 14-4:
The Find/
Change
dialog box.
212
Part IV: Text Essentials 

To use special characters, use the pop-up list (the right-facing arrow
icon) to select from a menu of special characters (see Figure 14-5).
6. Specify whether to find the word within other words (for example,
rest within restaurant, or just rest) by checking or unchecking the
Whole Word check box.
(If Whole Word is checked, Find/Change will only locate standalone
instances of the Find What text.)
7. Specify whether to consider capitalization patterns in the Find/Change
operation by checking or unchecking the Case Sensitive check box.
When checked, Find/Change follows the capitalization of the text in the
Find What and Change To fields exactly.
Figure 14-5:
The special
characters
pop-up list
in the
Find/Change
dialog box.
213
Chapter 14: The Ins and Outs of Text

8. To search for or replace with specific formatting, use the Format 
buttons.
These buttons are available only if you had clicked the More Options
button.
9. Click the Find Next button to start the search.
When the search has begun, click the Find Next button to skip instances
of the Find What text, and click the Change, Change All, or Change/Find
buttons as appropriate. (Clicking the Change button simply changes the
found text, clicking the Change All button changes every instance of that
found text in your selection or story, and clicking the Change/Find
button changes the current found text and moves on to the next occur-
rence of it — it basically does in one click the actions of clicking Change
and then Find Next.)
If you use the Change All feature, InDesign reports how many changes
were made. If the number looks extraordinarily high and you suspect the
Find/Change operation wasn’t quite what you wanted, remember that
you can use InDesign’s undo function (Edit➪Undo, or Ô+Z or Ctrl+Z) to
cancel the search and replace, and then try a different replace strategy.
10. Click the Done button when you’re finished doing the finding and
replacing.
Replacing formatting
To find and change formatting or text with specific formatting, use the
expanded Find/Change dialog box. For example, you might find all the words
in 14-point Futura Extra Bold and change them to 12-point Bodoni.
To replace text formatting, follow these steps:
1. To add formats to a Find/Change operation for text, click the More
Options button in the Find/Change dialog box (if it was not clicked
earlier).
The dialog box expands to include the Find Format Settings and Change
Format Settings areas.
2. Use the Format buttons to display the Find Format Settings and
Change Format Settings dialog boxes, which let you specify the for-
mats you want to find.
Your options are Style Options (paragraph and character styles), Basic
Character Formats, Advanced Character Formats, Indents and Spacing,
Keep Options, Character Color, OpenType Features, Underline Options,
214
Part IV: Text Essentials 

Strikethrough Options, and Drop Caps and Other. You can change multi-
ple attributes at once by making selections from as many panes as needed.
Open one of these dialog boxes, select the desired formatting to search
or replace, then click OK when done. Now open the other dialog box to
select its formatting, then click OK when done.
3. Click Find Next and then Change to change the next occurrence, or
click Change All to change all occurrences. Click Done when you are
finished with the search and replace.
To search and replace formatting only — regardless of the text to which it is
applied — leave the Find What and Change To fields blank.
Checking Spelling
The Check Spelling feature not only helps you eradicate spelling errors, it
also catches repeated words, as well as words with odd capitalization such
as the internal capitalization (called intercaps). InDesign also flags words not
found in the spelling dictionary. You can customize the spelling dictionary,
and you can purchase additional spelling dictionaries.
Checking spelling as you type
You can have InDesign check your spelling as you type by simply choosing
Edit➪Spelling➪Dynamic Spelling. If that menu option is checked, your
spelling will be checked as you type, as will the spelling of any text already in
the document. Suspected errors are highlighted with red squiggle underlin-
ing, so that you can correct them as needed. If you want InDesign to suggest
proper spelling, you’ll need to use the Check Spelling dialog box, covered in
the next section.
The dynamic spelling feature is new to InDesign CS2.
Correcting mistakes on the fly
If you use a word processor, chances are it is one that corrects mistakes as
you type. Microsoft Word, for example, has a feature called AutoCorrect that
lets you specify corrections to be made as you type, whether those be
common typos you make or the expansion of abbreviations to their full
215
Chapter 14: The Ins and Outs of Text

words (such as having Word replace tq with thank you). Automatic correction
is also a handy way to convert two hyphens to an em dash or a keyboard
sequence like (R) to the ® symbol.
InDesign offers the same functionality, which it calls Autocorrect. Note that
Autocorrect works only for text entered in InDesign after Autocorrect is
turned on; it will not correct imported or previously typed text.
The Autocorrect feature is new to InDesign CS2.
You enable Autocorrect in the Autocorrect pane of the Preferences dialog box
(InDesign➪Preferences on the Mac or Edit➪Preferences in Windows, or Ô+K
or Ctrl+K). If you want InDesign to automatically fix capitalization errors,
check the Autocorrect Capitalization Errors check box. Typically, this finds
typos involving capitalizing the second letter of a word in addition to the
first. For example, InDesign would replace FOrmat with Format.
To add your own custom corrections, click the Add button. This opens the
Add to Autocorrect List dialog box, where you can enter the typo text or
code that you want InDesign to be alert for in the Misspelled Word field, as
well as the corrected or expanded text you want InDesign to substitute in the
Correction field.
Using the Check Spelling dialog box
The Check Spelling dialog box not only lets you choose what part of the doc-
ument to spell check, it also provides suggestions on correct spelling. Plus,
you can use the dialog box to add correctly spelled words to InDesign’s
spelling dictionary. Even if you use the new dynamic spell-checking feature,
you’ll still want to do a final spell-checking pass with the Check Spelling
dialog box.
Specifying the text to check is a two-step process: First set up the spell check’s
scope in the document, and then specify the scope in the Search menu.
To set up the scope for the spell check, highlight text, click in a story to
check from the cursor forward, select a frame containing a story, or open
multiple documents.
Next, open the Check Spelling dialog box (Edit➪Spelling➪Check Spelling, or
Ô+I or Ctrl+I) and choose an option from the Search pop-up menu: Document,
All Documents, Story, To End of Story, and Selection. Figure 14-6 shows the
dialog box. You may not see all the options in the Search pop-up menu; the
list of options depends on how you set up the scope. For example, if you
didn’t highlight text, the Selection option will not be available. However, you
can change the scope setup in the document while the Check Spelling dialog
box is open — for example, you can open additional documents to check.
216
Part IV: Text Essentials 

When you first open the Check Spelling dialog box, it displays “Ready to Check
Spelling” at the top. To begin checking the text scope you specified in the
Search pop-up menu, click Start. When the spell checker encounters a word
without a match in the dictionary or a possible capitalization problem, the
dialog box displays “Not in Dictionary” at the top and shows the word. When
the spell checker encounters a duplicate word, such as of of, the dialog box
displays “Duplicate Word” and shows which word is duplicated. Use the but-
tons along the right side of the dialog box to handle flagged words as follows:
 Click the Ignore button to leave the current instance of a Not in Dictionary
word or Duplicate Word unchanged. To leave all instances of the same
problem unchanged, click the Ignore All button.
 To change the spelling of a Not in Dictionary word, click a word in the
Suggested Corrections list or edit the spelling or capitalization in the
Change To field. To make the change, click the Change button.
 To correct an instance of a Duplicate Word, edit the text in the Change
To field, and then click the Change button.
 To change all occurrences of a Not in Dictionary word or a Duplicate
Word to the information in the Change To field, click the Change All
button.
 To add a word flagged as incorrect — but that you know is correct — to
InDesign’s spelling dictionary, click the Add button.
 To add a word flagged as incorrect to a specific dictionary, click the
Dictionary button. A Dictionary dialog box appears, which enables you
to choose the dictionary to which you want to add the word, as well as
what language to associate it with.

Changing the spelling and 
hyphenation dictionaries
The spelling dictionary that comes with InDesign is pretty extensive, but it’s
very likely that you will need to add words to it. For example, your company
might use words that are company-specific terms. Or you might use some
product or individuals’ names that would not typically be found in the dic-
tionary. Additionally, you might have some words that you prefer not to
hyphenate, others that you want to hyphenate in a specific manner. To
address these issues, you can customize InDesign’s spelling and hyphenation
dictionaries. InDesign handles both spelling and hyphenation in one diction-
ary for each language, so you use the same controls to modify both spelling
and hyphenation.
Changes made to a dictionary file are saved only in the dictionary file, not
with an open document. So if you add words to the English: USA. dictionary,
the modified dictionary is used for spell checking and hyphenating all text in
documents that uses the English: U.S.A. dictionary.
If you’re in a workgroup, be sure to share the edited dictionary file so that
everyone is using the same spelling and hyphenation settings. (The file is
located in the Dictionaries folder inside the Plug-ins folder inside your InDesign
folder.) You can copy it for other users, who must then restart InDesign or
press Option+Ô+/ or Ctrl+Alt+/ to reflow the text according to the new dic-
tionary’s hyphenation.
Customizing the spelling dictionary
When you add a word to the spelling dictionary, this word will no longer be
flagged when you check spelling, and you can be sure that when it’s used, it
is spelled as it is in the dictionary.
While adding words to the dictionary, you can specify their capitalization. For
example, InDesign’s dictionary prefers E-mail. You can add e-mail if you prefer
a lowercase e or email if you prefer to skip the hyphen. To add words to the
dictionary, follow these steps:
1. Choose Edit➪Spelling➪Dictionary.
The Dictionary dialog box, shown in Figure 14-7, appears.
218
Part IV: Text Essentials 

2. Choose whether the addition to the dictionary affects just this docu-
ment or all documents.
The Target pop-up menu lists the current document name as well as the
name of the user dictionary.
3. Choose the dictionary that you want to edit from the Language 
pop-up menu.
4. Type or paste a word in the Word field.
The word can have capital letters if appropriate, and it can include spe-
cial characters such as accents and hyphens.
5. To have the added word accepted as being spelled correctly only with
the capitalization specified in the Word field, check the Case Sensitive
check box.
This new feature lets you add proper names, for example, but have them
still flagged when entered in all lowercase or with extra capital letters.
6. To edit the hyphenation of the word, click the Hyphenate button.
We cover hyphenation in the next section.
7. Click the Add button.
8. To import a word list or export one for other users to import into
their copies of InDesign, click the Import or Export button.
You will then navigate to a folder and choose a filename in a dialog box.
Note that when you click the Export button, InDesign will export all
selected words from the list. If no words are selected, it will export all
the words in the list.
9. When you’re finished adding words, click the Done button.

Chapter 14: The Ins and Outs of Text

To delete a word that you added to the dictionary, select it in the list and
click the Remove button. To change the spelling of a word you added, delete
it then re-add it with the correct spelling. You can see all deleted words —
just those deleted since you opened the dialog box — by selecting Removed
Words from the Dictionary List pop-up menu, so you can add back any
deleted by error.
Customizing hyphenation points
People can be particular about how to hyphenate words. Fortunately,
InDesign lets you modify the hyphenation dictionary by specifying new, hier-
archical hyphenation points.
Follow these steps to specify hyphenation points:
1. Choose Edit➪Spelling➪Dictionary.
2. In the Language pop-up menu, pick the dictionary that you want 
to edit.
3. Type or paste the word in the Word field; you can also double-click a
word in the list.
4. To see InDesign’s suggestions for hyphenating the word, click the
Hyphenate button.
If you want to change the hyphenation, continue on to Step 5.
5. Type a tilde (~, obtained by pressing Shift+`, the open single keyboard
quote at the upper left of the keyboard) at your first preference for a
hyphenation point in the word.
If you don’t want the word to hyphenate at all, type a tilde in front of it.
6. To indicate an order of preference, use two tildes for your second
choice, three tildes for your third choice, and so on. InDesign will first
try to hyphenate your top preferences (single tildes), then it will try
your second choices if the first ones don’t work out, and so on.
7. Click the Add button.
8. Continue to add words until you’re finished, and then click the Done
button.
To revert a word to the default hyphenation, select it in the list and click the
Remove button. To change the hyphenation, double-click a word in the list to
enter it in the Word field, change the tildes, and then click the Add button.
When you’re adding variations of words, you can double-click a word in the
list to place it in the Word field as a starting place.

T
ext is more than words — it’s also a layout element that flows through
your pages in the locations that you need. Much of the work you do in
InDesign will be controlling that flow and working with the text as blocks that
need to have the right arrangement to fit your layout’s goals.
This chapter can help you manage that flow and arrangement, showing you
how to deftly maneuver the text through your layout, just as you would move
your way through the dance floor.
Working with Text Frames
When you’re creating a simple layout, such as a single-page flyer or a maga-
zine advertisement, you will probably create text frames as you need them.
But if you’re working on a book or a magazine, you’ll want your text frames
placed on master pages so your text will be consistently framed automati-
cally when it appears on document pages. And you’ll still have individual text
frames you create for specific elements like sidebars.
Chapter 10 shows you how to create frames (including text frames), while
Chapter 8 shows you how to create master pages. Here, we bring those two
concepts together to show you how to work with text frames, both those in
master pages and those you create in your document pages.

Creating master text frames
Master pages — predesigned pages that you can apply to other pages to auto-
mate layout and ensure consistency — can contain several types of text
frames:
 Text frames containing standing text, such as page numbers or page
headers.
 Text frames containing placeholder text for elements such as figure cap-
tions or headlines.
 One master text frame (an automatically placed text frame for flowing
text throughout pages), which you create in the New Document dialog
box (File➪New➪Document, or Ô+N or Ctrl+N).
Think of a master text frame as an empty text frame on the default master
page that lets you automatically flow text through a document. When you
create a new document, you can create a master text frame at the same time.
Here’s how it works:
1. Choose File➪New➪Document or press Ô+N or Ctrl+N.
2. Check the Master Text Frame check box at the top of the New
Document dialog box.
3. Specify the size and placement of the master text frame by entering
values in the Margins area for Top, Bottom, Inside, and Outside (or
Left and Right if Facing Pages is unchecked) fields.
InDesign places guides according to these values and places a text frame
within the guides. The text frame fits within the boundaries of these
values and those of the guides on the master page.
4. To specify the number of columns in the master text frame, enter a
value in the Number field in the Columns area.
You can also specify the amount of space between the columns by enter-
ing a value in the Gutter field.
5. Establish any other needed settings as described in Chapter 5.
Check the Facing Pages check box if your pages will have different inside
and outside margins (for example, a book might have different inside
and outside margins for left-hand and right-hand pages).
6. Click OK to create a new document containing a master text frame.
After you create a document with a master text frame, you’ll see guides on
the first document page that indicate the placement of the frame.
222
Part IV: Text Essentials 

Creating individual text frames
While the master text frame is helpful for containing body text that flows
through a document, there’s a good chance you’ll need additional text
frames, on both master pages and document pages. Generally, these are
smaller text frames that hold text such as headlines or captions.
To add text frames to a master page for repeating elements such as headers
and footers, first display the master page. Choose Window➪Pages or press
F12 to display the Pages pane. Then double-click the A-Master icon in the
upper portion of the pane, as shown in Figure 15-1. That displays the A-
Master master page. (If you have multiple master pages in your document,
you can follow these instructions to add text frames to any of them. Just
choose the desired master page.)
To add text frames to a document page, first go to the page. You can use any
of the techniques described in Chapter 6 to move among pages.
Now draw the desired frame using any of the frame or shape tools, or the
Type tool, as described in Chapter 10. Modify them with the Control palette
or Transform pane, or by using the mouse, also as described in that chapter.
Text frames you add to a master page will show up on any document pages
based on that master page.

223
Chapter 15: The Text Frame Tango

If you’re working on a document page and want to type inside a text frame
placed on the page by a master page, select the Type tool and then
Shift+Ô+click or Ctrl+Shift+click the frame.
Making changes to text frames
You’re not confined to the settings you originally established when you set
up a master text frame or an individual text frame — you may need to change
the size, shape, and/or number of columns in the text frame. Use the Selection
tool to click the desired text frame and then modify it with the following
options (the first six are covered in detail in Chapter 10):
 Change the placement of a selected master text frame by using the X:
and Y: fields in the Control palette or Transform pane.
 Change the size of the master text frame by using the W: and H: fields.
 Change the angle by using the Rotation field.
 Change the skew by using the Shear X field.
 Enter values in the Scale fields to increase or decrease, by percentage
amounts, the width and height of the text frame.
 To change the shape of the text frame, use the Direct Selection tool,
which lets you drag anchor points on the frame to other positions.
 Use the General pane of the Text Frame Options dialog box (Object➪
Text Frame Options, or Ô+B or Ctrl+B, shown in Figure 15-2) to make fur-
ther modifications:
• Change the number of columns and the space between them.
• Specify how far text is inset from each side of the frame.
• Align text vertically within the frame.
• Control the placement of the first baseline.
 Use the Baseline Options of the Text Frame Options dialog box to set a
baseline grid, if desired, for the text to align to. Chapter 11 describes
this feature in more detail.
If you don’t want the text inside this text frame to wrap around any items
in front of it, check Ignore Text Wrap at the bottom of the dialog box.
If you open the Text Frame Options dialog box with no document open,
any changes you make will become the default for all new documents.
 Specify character styles, paragraph styles, object styles, Story pane set-
tings, text-wrap settings, and other text attributes to apply in the text
frame to the document text you flow into that frame. (You can always
override those attributes by applying other styles or formatting to the
text later.) Chapters 13, 17, and 18 cover these other settings.
224
Part IV: Text Essentials 

Threading Text Frames
The text that flows through a series of frames is what InDesign considers a
story, and the connections among those frames are called threads. When you
edit text in a threaded story, the text reflows throughout the text frames. You
can also spell-check and do a find/change operation for an entire story, even
though you have just one of the story’s text frames active on-screen.
When you have threaded text frames, you’ll see visual indicators on your text
frame, assuming you choose View➪Show Text Threads (Option+Ô+Y or Ctrl+
Alt+Y) and have selected the frame with one of the selection tools. At the
lower right of the text frame is a small square, called the out port, that indi-
cates the outflow status:
 If the square is empty, that means there is no text flowing to another
frame, and not enough text to flow to another frame.
 If the square is red and has a plus sign in it, that means there is more
text than fits in the selected frame but that it is not flowing to another
frame. This is called overset text.
 If the square has a triangle icon, that means the text that it is flowing to
another frame. That doesn’t mean that text is flowing, just that if there is
more text than the current frame can hold, it will flow.
Similarly, there’s an in port at the upper left of a text frame that indicates
whether text is flowing from another frame into the current frame:
Figure 15-2:
Change the
properties
of a text
frame using
the Text
Frame
Options
dialog box.
225
Chapter 15: The Text Frame Tango

 If the square is empty, that means there is no text flowing from another
frame, making this frame the first (and perhaps only) frame in a story.
 If the square has a triangle icon, that means the text that it is flowing
from another frame. That doesn’t mean that text is flowing, just that if
there is more text than the other frame can hold, it will flow into this
frame.
So how do you thread the frames in the first place? You have three options in
InDesign: manual, semi-autoflow, and autoflow. Each of these options has its
own icon. The method you choose depends on the amount of text you’re
dealing with and the size and number of your text frames:
 To link two text frames across several pages (for example, for an article
that starts on page 2 and continues on page 24), you might use the
manual method, in which you click the first text frame’s out port and
then on the second text frame.
 To link a succession of text frames, you might want to use the semi-
autoflow method, which allows you to click a series of text frames to
flow text from one frame to the next.
 To import text that is intended for long documents (such as a book
chapter or brochure), you might want to use the autoflow method to
add text frames and pages that accommodate the text you’re importing.
For a quick glance at your text threads while you’re threading text across
pages, simply change the document view briefly to 20 percent or so.
Text flows in the order in which you select frames. If you move a frame, its
order in the text flow remains unchanged. If you’re not careful, you could, for
example, accidentally have text flow from a frame at the top of the page to a
frame at the bottom of a page and then to one in the middle of a page.
Threading frames manually
To thread text frames manually, you simply use a selection tool to link out
ports to in ports. You can pre-thread existing text frames by linking empty
text frames, and add text later, or you can create threads from a text frame
that contains text.
Always switch to a selection tool when you’re threading frames. Oddly, you
cannot thread frames while the Type tool is selected. Oh well.
To thread text frames, follow these steps:
1. Create a series of text frames that will hold the text you import.
These text frames do not need to be on the same page.
226
Part IV: Text Essentials 

2. Click either the Selection tool or the Direction Selection tool.
3. Click the out port of the first text frame in the thread.
The pointer becomes the loaded-text icon.
4. Click the in port of the second text frame in the thread.
You can also click any empty frame or click and drag to draw a new text
frame. How text flow behaves depends on the text frame’s status:
• If the first frame held no text, then any text placed or typed in later
will flow into the second frame if it doesn’t all fit in the first text
frame.
• If the first frame held text but was not already linked to another
text frame, any overset text will flow into the existing text frame.
• If the first text frame was already linked to another text frame, the
text will now be redirected to the text frame you just selected.
5. Use the Pages pane to add or switch pages while you continue click-
ing out ports and in ports until your chain of threaded text frames is
complete.
6. When you’re finished threading text frames, select another object on
the page or select another tool.
A story imported into any text frame in this chain will start in the upper-
right corner of the first frame and flow through the frames in the same
order as the threads.
Threading frames with the 
semi-autoflow method
InDesign includes a semi-autoflow method of threading text frames, which
incorporates a few automatic shortcuts but varies only slightly from the
manual method. Follow the same steps for threading text frames manually,
except hold down the Option or Alt key each time you click in the next text
frame. Doing so lets you bypass the in ports and out ports and simply click
from text frame to text frame to establish links.
If you want to begin a semi-autoflow process when you place a word-
processing file for the first time, you can Option+click or Alt+click in 
the first text frame that will hold the placed text.
As you’re threading frames, Option+click or Alt+click each text frame, or
you’ll revert to manual threading.
227
Chapter 15: The Text Frame Tango

Threading frames and automatically
adding pages
You can flow a lengthy story quickly through a document using the autoflow
method for threading frames. You can either autoflow text into the master
text frame or into automatically created text frames that fit within the column
guides. InDesign flows the text into any existing pages, and then adds new
pages based on the current master page. You can initiate autoflow before or
after placing a word processing file.
Placing text while autoflowing
If you haven’t imported text yet, you can place a file and have it automatically
flow through the document. This method works well for flowing text into
pages that are all formatted the same way (as in a book). Here’s how it works:
1. Before you begin, check your master page.
Make sure that the master page you’re using includes a master text
frame or appropriate column guides.
2. With no text frames selected, choose File➪Place or press Ô+D or
Ctrl+D.
3. Locate and select the word-processing file you want to import, and
then click Open.
4. When you see the loaded-text icon, Shift+click in the first column that
will contain the text.
InDesign adds all the necessary text frames and pages, and flows in the
entire story.
Autoflowing after placing text
Even if you’ve already placed a text file into a single text frame or a threaded
chain of text frames, you can still autoflow text from the last text frame. To do
this, click the out port, then Shift+click any page to indicate where to start
the autoflow.
You might use this method if you’re placing the introduction to an article in
an elaborately designed opener page. Then you can flow the rest of the arti-
cle into standard pages.
Breaking and rerouting threads
Once text frames are threaded, you have three options for changing the
threads: You can break threads to stop text from flowing, insert a text frame
228
Part IV: Text Essentials 

into an existing chain of threaded text frames, and remove text frames from a
thread. Here are the techniques in a nutshell:
 Break the link between two text frames by double-clicking either an out
port or an in port. The thread between the two text frames is removed,
and all text that had flowed from that point is sucked out of the subse-
quent text frames and stored as overset text.
 Insert a text frame after a specific text frame in a chain by clicking its out
port. Then, click and drag the loaded-text icon to create a new text
frame. That new frame is automatically threaded to both the previous
and the next text frames.
 Reroute text threads — for example to drop the middle text frame from a
chain of three — by clicking the text frame with the Selection tool and
then pressing Delete or Backspace. This deletes the text frame and
reroutes the threads. You can also Shift+click to multiple-select text
frames to remove. Note that you cannot reroute text threads without
removing the text frames.
Working with Columns
Where you place columns on the page — and the amount of space you allow
between columns — has a big impact on readability. Used with a little know-
how, column width works with type size and leading to make text easier to
read. Columns help you keep from getting lost from one line to the next, and
from getting a headache as you’re trying to read the words on the page.
Generally, as columns get wider, the type size and leading increase. For exam-
ple, you might see 9-point text and 15-point leading in 21⁄2-inch columns, while
15-point text and 13-point leading might work better in 31⁄2-inch columns.
InDesign lets you place columns on the page automatically, create any
number of columns within a text frame, and change columns at any time.
Specifying columns in master frames
You can specify the number of columns at the same time you create a master
text frame — a text frame placed automatically within the margin guides.
In the Columns area in the New Document dialog box, use the Number field to
specify how many columns, and the Gutter field to specify how much space
to place between the columns. (The gutter is the space between columns.)
Whether or not you check Master Text Frame (which makes the frame appear
on all pages), guides for these columns will still be placed on the page and
can be used for placing text frames and other objects.
229
Chapter 15: The Text Frame Tango

Changing columns in text frames
You can change the number of columns in a text frame (whether an individ-
ual text frame or a master text frame), even after you’ve flown text into the
frame — and doing so isn’t difficult. First, select the text frame with a selec-
tion tool or the Type tool (or Shift+click to select multiple text frames and
change all their columns at once). Then choose Object➪Text Frame Options,
or press Ô+B or Ctrl+B, and set the desired Number and Gutter values in the
General pane of the Text Frame Options dialog box, shown in Figure 15-2. You
can also use the Control palette to quickly change the number of columns.
Some designers like to draw each column as a separate frame. We recommend
against this practice; it’s too easy to create columns of slightly different widths
and slightly different positions, so text doesn’t align properly. Instead, specify
columns in your text frames so you won’t have to worry about sloppy layouts.
Note that the options in the Columns area of the Text Frame Options dialog
box works differently depending on whether Fixed Column Width is checked
or unchecked:
 If Fixed Column Width is unchecked, InDesign subtracts from the text
frame the space specified for the gutters, and then divides the remaining
width by the number of columns to figure out how wide the columns can
be. For example, if you specify a 10-inch-wide text frame with three
columns and a gutter of 1⁄2 inch, you end up with three 3-inch columns
and two 1⁄2-inch gutters. The math is (10–2 × 0.5) ÷ 3.
 If Fixed Column Width is checked, InDesign resizes the text frame to fit
the number of columns you selected at the indicated size, as well as the
gutters between them. For example, suppose you’re using a 10.5-inch-
wide text frame with a column width of 5 inches and a gutter of 1⁄2 inch,
and you choose three columns: You end up with a 16-inch-wide text
frame containing three 5-inch columns and two 1⁄2-inch gutters. The math
is (5 × 3) + (2 × 0.5).
Check Preview to see the effects of your changes before finalizing them.
Adding ruling lines between columns
Let’s face it: A crowded page can be hard to read. If you have columns sepa-
rated by relatively narrow gutters, you might want to consider using vertical
230
Part IV: Text Essentials 

rules (thin lines) between the columns. These lines are also called intercol-
umn rules, and offer an effective way to separate columns with small gutters.
Intercolumn rules can also add visual interest to a document and even a sense
of old-fashioned authority (as they were for newspapers a century ago — and
you can still find them in The Wall Street Journal).
But InDesign lacks an automatic method for creating intercolumn rules — if
you want them, you draw lines on the page (in the center of each gutter),
using the Line tool. Because you might resize text frames or change the
number of columns while designing a document, you should add the vertical
rules at the end of the process. In a document with a standard layout (such
as a newspaper or magazine), you can place the rules between columns in
text frames on the master page so they’re automatically placed on every
page. As always with such objects, you can modify them on individual docu-
ment pages as needed (just be sure to Shift+Ô+click or Ctrl+Shift+click to
select them when working in your document pages).
Use rulers to precisely position the lines when you are drawing rules between
columns. After you’ve drawn the lines, Shift+click to select all the lines and
the text frames, then choose Object➪Group, or Ô+G or Ctrl+G. If the lines are
grouped so that they are attached to the text frame, you can move the lines
and text frame as one unit. This also prevents someone from accidentally
moving a vertical rule later.
Intercolumn rules should be thin: usually a hairline (1⁄4 point) or 1⁄2 point. Any
intercolumn rules larger than that are usually too thick; they’re too easily
confused with the border of a sidebar or other boxed element.
Working with Merged Data
Mass mailings are a ton of work (but you knew that). Fortunately, word
processors like Microsoft Word have long let you create forms with mail
merge so you can send a standard letter to hordes of people — personalizing
each copy by letting Word insert each individual name, address, and so forth
(Word even prints each copy automatically). InDesign CS2 incorporates a
data merge — originally part of the $49 PageMaker Plug-In Pack for InDesign
CS, but now a built-in feature. (At last!) Merged data is new to InDesign CS2,
although it based on an optional plug-in for InDesign CS. Merged-data docu-
ments include:
231
Chapter 15: The Text Frame Tango

 Form letters, where one layout is printed multiple times, with each copy
having personalized information.
 Labels, where layout components are repeated several times in the same
layout, but with different information. Usually just one copy is printed.
Setting up a form letter or a label
InDesign uses the same procedure for setting up form letters and labels. Just
follow these steps:
1. Create a text file, using either tabs or commas to separate the data.
Either/or is the best approach here: Use either one but don’t mix 
the two.
2. Start a new record by pressing Enter or Return (a new paragraph).
3. Make sure the first row contains the names of the fields.
For example, for a local guidebook listing coffee shops, your data might
look like this (the →characters here indicate the tabs you should actu-
ally type):
name→address→phone
Jolt Coffee House→38 4th St.→(415) 799-1213
→51 C St.→(415) 608-9066
→2800 California St.→(415) 931-2281
Shaking Grounds→75 Irwin St.→(415) 827-9003
Pop’s Coffeehouse→13 Ninth St.→(415) 712-9445
Voilà — a simple file with three fields per entry: the café name, its
address, and its phone number. (The file uses tabs as the separator.)
Merging data into a new document
A data-merge operation (which creates a new document) is also pretty
straightforward. Just follow these steps:
1. With the source file ready, create (or go to) the text frame into which
you want to flow your data.
2. Use the Type tool to select the insertion point for your data.
3. Open the Data Merge pane by choosing Window➪Automation➪
Data Merge.
4. Choose Select Data Source from the Data Merge pane’s palette menu
(shown in Figure 15-3).
A dialog box opens.
232
Part IV: Text Essentials 

5. Use the dialog box to navigate to the desired file, and then click Open.
Your chosen file opens. The Data Merge pane shows the name of the
data file and lists the fields it contains.
• If your data file has changed since you last accessed it, you can
import its most current version by choosing Update Data Source
from the Data Merge pane’s palette menu.
• Choose Remove Data Source to remove a data file from the pane.
6. Drag the fields to the appropriate spots in your layout (or double-click
a field name to insert it at the current text-insertion point).
For example, in a form letter, you might drag the Name field to right after
the text Dear and before the comma in the salutation. The field names
will be enclosed in guillemets, the French quotation marks («»). Here’s
what this would look like in your layout:
Dear «Name»,
You can use a field more than once in the layout. Then the pane shows
the page numbers for all pages that use the field (to the right of the 
field name).
7. Format the fields as desired.
8. Click the Create Merged Document icon at the bottom right of the
pane or choose Create Merged Document from the palette menu.
Doing so imports the entire data file’s contents into your layout. A
Create Merged Document dialog box opens, showing the Records pane
with the following options:
• In the Records to Merge section, choose which record(s) to
import. You can choose all, a specific record, or a range.
• In the Records per Document Page pop-up menu, choose Single
Record if you want a new page output per record (as in a form
letter) or Multiple Records if you want to print multiple copies of
the same record on a page (as for address labels).

document.
These options are as follows:
• In the Image Placement section, choose how to fit any imported
graphics by choosing an option in the Fitting pop-up menu. The
usual choice is the default, Fit Images Proportionally.
• In the lower section of the pane, you can remove blank lines cre-
ated by empty field by checking the Remove Blank Lines for Empty
Fields check box. You can also limit the number of pages in the
merged document by checking Page Limit per Document and enter-
ing a value in its field.
10. Click OK.

W
hen you create documents, you have lots of opportunities to make
decisions about how the text appears. With its comprehensive set of
character-formatting tools, InDesign lets you change the look of type so it can
precisely match the communication needs of your publications. You can con-
trol not just the font and size of type, but also many other variations.
Decisions about type matter. A document relies on good typography to allow
others to easily read and understand it. The appearance of type supports the
message you’re conveying, and doing a good job of character formatting is
worth your time.
Specifying Character Formats
InDesign lets you modify the appearance of highlighted characters or
selected paragraphs with the following options:
 Character pane: Highlight the text and open the Character pane (Type➪
Character, or Ô+T or Ctrl+T), which is shown in Figure 16-1. Be sure
Show Options is visible in the palette menu in order to see all the possi-
ble options.
The Character pane provides access to most of InDesign’s character for-
matting options. Three of the options — Font Family, Type Style, and
Font Size — are also available on the Type menu, and several options
have keyboard shortcuts.

 Paragraph pane: Select a paragraph and open the Paragraph pane
(Type➪Paragraph, or Option+Ô+T, or Ctrl+Alt+T or Ctrl+M).
 Control palette: The Control palette offers all the formatting options of
the Character pane plus others, as shown in Figure 16-2. (If the Control
palette doesn’t show all the character formatting options, select the text
and then click the A icon on the palette.)
To change the default character formats — the settings that InDesign will use
when you type text into an empty frame — make changes in the Character
pane or Control palette when no text is selected or when the text-insertion
cursor isn’t flashing. That’ll save you the hassle of having to reformat new text.
You can choose to apply character formats to highlighted text in two ways:
 Create and apply character styles. Character styles offer an important
advantage: A character style’s settings are stored, so you can apply the
exact same settings easily to other text. When you change a character
style’s settings, any text based on that style is automatically changed to
reflect the new settings.

 Use the local controls in the Character pane, the Control palette, the
Type menu, or their keyboard shortcuts, which we discuss in the
upcoming sections.
Even if you do use character styles, you’ll probably also do some local
formatting from time to time. For example, you would probably use the
Character pane to format the type on the opening spread of a feature
magazine article, and then use character styles to quickly format the
remainder of the article.
Modifying Font, Type Style, and Size
Many people use typographic terms — font, face, typeface, font family, and
type style — inconsistently. Which terms you use doesn’t matter as long as
you make yourself understood, but we recommend becoming familiar with
the font-related terms in InDesign’s menus and panes:
 Font or typeface: A collection of characters — including letters, num-
bers, and special characters — that share the same overall appearance,
including stroke width, weight, angle, and style.
For example, Helvetica Regular and Adobe Garamond Semibold Italic are
well-known fonts.
 Font family: A collection of several fonts that share the same general
appearance but differ in stroke width, weight, and/or stroke angle.
For example, Helvetica and Adobe Garamond are font families.
 Type style: Each of the fonts that make up a font family. When you
choose a font family from the Character pane’s Font Family menu,
InDesign displays the family’s type style variations in the accompanying
Type Styles pop-up menu.
For example, Regular and Semibold Italic are examples of type styles.
Changing font family and type style
When you change from one font to another in InDesign, you can choose a
new font family and type style independently in the Character pane. For
example, changing from Arial Bold to Times Bold or from Arial Regular to
Berthold Baskerville Regular is a simple change of font family (Arial to
Berthold Baskerville). However, if you switch from, say, Bookman Light to
Century Schoolbook Bold Italic, you’re changing both family and type style
(Bookman to Century, then Light to Bold Italic).
237
Chapter 16: Handling Character Details

InDesign CS2 can display previews of fonts when you select fonts via the
Control palette, various text-oriented panes, and the Type menu. You turn on
this capability in the Type pane of the Preferences dialog box (choose
InDesign➪Preferences➪Type on the Mac or Edit➪Preferences➪Type in
Windows, or press Ô+K or Ctrl+K). But doing so makes your menus huge,
often so much that they are unwieldy to use. While it can help you get famil-
iar with your fonts, its unwieldy nature may not be worth that benefit. Only
you can decide, but if you do use it, we recommend keeping the preview size
small to limit its size.
Whether you use the Control palette or Character pane, you can choose
between two methods for changing the font family:
 Choose the Font Family menu, and then select a name from the list of
available font families.
 Place the cursor in front of or highlight the font name displayed in the
Font Family field, type the first few letters of the font family you want to
apply, and then press Return or Enter. For example, entering Cas selects
Caslon (if it’s available on your computer).
If you choose only a font family when type styles are available in an accompa-
nying submenu, no changes are applied to the selected text. So be sure to
select a type style from the submenu.
Changing type size
You can be very precise with type sizes (what InDesign calls font size).
InDesign supports sizes from 0.1 point to 1,296 points (108 inches) in incre-
ments as fine as 0.001 point. Of course, you want to use good judgment when
choosing type sizes. For example, headlines should be larger than subheads,
which in turn are larger than body text, which is larger than photo credits,
and so on.
Change the type size of highlighted text with the following methods:
 Choose Type➪Size, and then choose one of the predefined sizes listed in
the Size submenu. If you choose Other from the submenu, the Font Size
field is highlighted in the Character pane. Enter a custom size, and then
press Return or Enter.
 Use the Character pane or Control palette:
• Choose one of the predefined sizes from the Font Size menu.
• Highlight the currently applied type size displayed in the accompa-
nying editable field, enter a new size, and then press Return or Enter.
238
Part IV: Text Essentials 

• Make sure the Font Size field is selected, then use the up and down
arrow keys to increase or decrease the size in 1-point increments.
Pressing Shift multiplies the increment to 10.
 Control+click or right-click a text selection, and then choose a size from
the Size submenu. If you choose Other from the submenu, the Font Size
field is highlighted in the Character pane. Enter a custom size, and then
press Return or Enter.
If text is highlighted and the Font Size field is empty, more than one type size
is used in the selected text.
Using Other Character Formats
In the Control palette, you can adjust other character formats, including all
caps, small caps, superscript, subscript, underline, strikethrough, kerning,
tracking, horizontal and vertical scale, baseline shift, skew, character style,
and language. Through the palette menu, you can also set ligatures, modify
underline and strikethrough settings, control whether text may break (be
hyphenated), and select OpenType features. (OpenType fonts can have a
dozen kinds of special formatting. These are expert features, so we don’t get
into the details here, but feel free to explore the options for any OpenType
fonts you have.)
In the Character pane, you can adjust kerning, tracking, horizontal and verti-
cal scale, baseline shift, skew, and language. Through its palette menu (refer
to Figure 16-1), you can also set all caps, small caps, superscript, subscript,
underline, strikethrough, ligatures, and underline and strikethrough settings,
as well as control whether text may break (be hyphenated) and select
OpenType features. (InDesign also lets you create custom underlines and
strikethroughs, as described in Chapter 18.)
You must choose Show Options from the Character pane’s pop-up menu to
display the Vertical Scale, Horizontal Scale, Baseline Shift, Skew, and
Language options in the pane.
The Control palette has the same functions as the Character pane, except the
all caps, small caps, superscript, subscript, underline, and strikethrough
options are in the palette rather than in its palette menu.
Figure 16-3 shows the various effects in action. In its top row, Some has been
scaled vertically, and special horizontally, while effects has each of the last
three letters baseline shifted by a different amount. In its middle row, the
word with has been skewed, while the word this is in real italics. Note the use
of superscript and subscript after the word text.
239
Chapter 16: Handling Character Details

Horizontal and Vertical Scale options
InDesign’s Horizontal Scale option lets you condense and expand type by
squeezing or stretching characters. Similarly, the Vertical Scale option lets
you shrink or stretch type vertically.
Typographers tend to agree that excessive scaling should be avoided. If you
need to make text bigger or smaller, your best bet is to adjust font size; if you
need to squeeze or stretch a range of text a bit, use InDesign’s kerning and
tracking controls (covered later in this chapter) because the letter forms
aren’t modified — only the space between letters changes when you kern or
track text.
Unscaled text has a horizontal and vertical scale value of 100 percent. You
can apply scaling values between 1 percent and 1,000 percent. If you apply
equal horizontal and vertical scale values, you’re making the original text
proportionally larger or smaller. In this case, changing font size is a simpler
solution.
To change the scale of highlighted text, enter new values in the Horizontal
and/or Vertical Scale fields in the Character pane or Control palette. If a value
is highlighted in the Horizontal Scale or Vertical Scale field, you can also use
the up and down arrow keys to increase and decrease the scaling in 1-percent
increments; press Shift to increase or decrease in 10-percent increments.
Baseline shift
The baseline is an invisible horizontal line on which a line of characters rests.
The bottom of each letter sits on the baseline (except descenders, such as 
in y, p, q, j, and g). When you perform a baseline shift, you move highlighted
text above or below its baseline. This feature is useful for carefully placing
such characters as trademark and copyright symbols and for creating custom
fractions.
Figure 16-3:
Various

240
Part IV: Text Essentials 

To baseline-shift highlighted text, enter new values in the Baseline Shift field
in the Character pane or Control palette. You can also use the up and down
arrow keys to increase the baseline shift in 1-point increments, or press Shift
with the arrow keys to increase or decrease it in 10-point increments.
Skew (false italic)
For fonts that don’t have an italic type style, InDesign provides the option to
skew, or slant, text to create an artificial italic variation of any font. Like hori-
zontal and vertical text scaling, skewing is a clunky way of creating italic-
looking text. Use this feature to create special typographic effects, as shown
in Figure 16-4, or in situations where a true italic style is not available. Skewing
works better for sans-serif typefaces than for serif typefaces, because the
characters are simpler and have fewer embellishments that can get oddly 
distorted when skewed.
To skew highlighted text, you have three options:
 Enter an angle value between –85 and 85 in the Skew field in the
Character pane or Control palette. Positive values slant text to the left;
negative values slant text to the right.
 Press the accompanying up/down arrow keys when the cursor is in the
Skew field to skew text in 1-degree increments. Pressing the Shift key
with an arrow key changes the increment 4 degrees.
 You can also skew all the text in a text frame using the Shear tool or by
changing the value in the Shear X Angle field in the Transform pane or
Control palette after selecting the frame. Slanting text by shearing a text
frame does not affect the skew angle of the text. You can specify a skew
angle for highlighted text independently from the frame’s shear angle.

241
Chapter 16: Handling Character Details

All Caps and Small Caps
When you choose All Caps, the uppercase version of all highlighted charac-
ters is used: Lowercase letters are converted to uppercase, and uppercase
letters remain unchanged.
Similarly, the Small Caps option affects just lowercase letters. When you
choose Small Caps, InDesign automatically uses the Small Caps type style if
one is available for the font family (few font families include this style). If a
Small Caps type style is not available, InDesign generates small caps from
uppercase letters using the scale percentage specified in the Advanced Type
pane of the Preferences dialog box (choose InDesign➪Preferences➪Advanced
Type on the Mac or Edit➪Preferences➪Advanced Type in Windows, or press
Ô+K or Ctrl+K). The default scale value used to generate small caps text is
70% (of uppercase letters).
Superscript and Subscript
When you apply the Superscript and Subscript character formats to high-
lighted text, InDesign applies a baseline shift to the characters, lifting them
above (for superscript) or lowering them below (for subscript) their baseline,
and reduces their size.
The amount of baseline shift and scaling that’s used for the Superscript and
Subscript formats is determined by the Position and Size fields in the
Advanced Type pane of the Preferences dialog box (choose InDesign➪
Preferences➪Advanced Type on the Mac or Edit➪Preferences➪Advanced
Type in Windows, or press Ô+K or Ctrl+K). The default Position value for
both formats is 33.3%, which means that characters are moved up or down
by one-third of the applied leading value. The default Superscript and
Subscript Size value is 58.3%, which means that superscripted and subscripted
characters are reduced to 58.3% of the applied font size. The Advanced Type
pane lets you specify separate default settings for Superscript and Subscript.
To apply the Superscript or Subscript format to highlighted text, choose 
the appropriate option from the Character pane’s pop-up menu. Figure 16-3
shows examples of characters to which the default Superscript and Subscript
settings have been applied.
Underline and Strikethrough
Underline and Strikethrough formats are typographically considered to be
unacceptable for indicating emphasis in text, which is better accomplished
by using bold and/or italic type styles.
242
Part IV: Text Essentials 

Underlines can be useful in kickers and other text above a headline, as well
as in documents formatted to look as if they are typewritten. Strikethrough
can be used in cases where you want to indicate incorrect answers, elimi-
nated choices, or deleted text.
If you use underlines and strikethrough, InDesign lets you specify exactly
how they look through the Underline Options and Strikethrough Options
dialog boxes available in the palette menus of the Character pane and
Control palette.
InDesign lets you create your own underlines and strikethroughs, in addition
to using the standard ones, as Chapter 18 explains.
Ligatures
A ligature is a special character that combines two letters. Most fonts include
just two ligatures — ﬁ and ﬂ. When you choose the Ligature option, InDesign
automatically displays and prints a font’s built-in ligatures — instead of the
two component letters — if the font includes ligatures.
One nice thing about the Ligature option is that, even though a ligature looks
like a single character on-screen, it’s still fully editable. That is, you can click
between the two-letter shapes and insert text if necessary. Also, a ligature
created with the Ligatures option doesn’t cause InDesign’s spell checker to
flag the word that contains it.
To use ligatures within highlighted text, choose Ligatures from the Character
pane’s or Control palette’s palette menu (Ligatures is set to On by default).
Figure 16-5 shows an example of text with a ligature.
For most Mac fonts that include ligatures, pressing Option+Shift+5 inserts the
ﬁ ligature, while Option+Shift+6 inserts the ﬂ ligature. In Windows, you have
to use a program such as Character Map that comes with Windows (usually
available by choosing Start➪Accessories➪System Tools➪Character Map) to
access the ligature characters in fonts that support them. Either way, if you
Figure 16-5:
Ligatures
are used
between the
fi and fl
letter pairs
in the two
words.
243
Chapter 16: Handling Character Details

enter ligatures yourself, InDesign’s spell checker flags any words that contain
them. For this reason, you may want to let the program handle the task of
inserting ligatures.
Turning off hyphenation
You can prevent individual words from being hyphenated or a string of words
from being broken at the end of a line. For example, you may decide that you
don’t want to hyphenate company names, such as BayCreative. The Hyphenate
option was created for situations such as these.
To prevent a word or a text string from being broken, highlight it, and then
uncheck Hyphenate from the Paragraph pane or the Control palette. You 
can also prevent a word from being hyphenated by placing a discretionary
hyphen (Shift+Ô+– [hyphen] or Ctrl+Shift+– [hyphen]) in front of the first
letter.
Controlling Space between 
Characters and Lines
The legibility of a block of text depends as much on the space around it —
called white space — as it does on the readability of the font. InDesign offers
two ways to adjust the space between characters:
 Kerning is the adjustment of space between a pair of characters. Most
fonts include built-in kerning tables that control the space between char-
acter pairs, such as LA, Yo, and WA, that otherwise could appear to have
a space between them even when there isn’t one. For large font sizes —
for example, a magazine headline — you may want to manually adjust
the space between certain character pairs to achieve consistent spacing.
 Tracking is the process of adding or removing space among all letters in
a range of text.
You can apply kerning and/or tracking to highlighted text in 1⁄1,000-em increments,
called units. An em is as wide as the height of the current font size (that is, an
em for 12-point text is 12 points wide), which means that kerning and track-
ing increments are relative to the applied font size.
Leading (rhymes with sledding) controls the vertical space between lines of
type. It’s traditionally an attribute of paragraphs, but InDesign lets you apply
leading on a character-by-character basis. To override the character-oriented
approach, ensuring that leading changes affect entire paragraphs, check the
244
Part IV: Text Essentials 

Apply Leading to Entire Paragraphs option in the Type pane of the Preferences
dialog box (choose InDesign➪Preferences➪Type on the Mac or Edit➪
Preferences➪Type in Windows, or press Ô+K or Ctrl+K).
Kerning
The Kerning controls in the Character pane and Control palette provide three
options for kerning letter pairs:
 Metrics: Controls the space between character pairs in the highlighted
text using a font’s built-in kerning pairs.
 Optical: Evaluates each letter pair in highlighted text and adds or
removes space between the letters based on the shapes of the characters.
 Manual: Adds or removes space between a specific letter pair in user-
specified amounts.
When the flashing text cursor is between a pair of characters, the Kerning
field displays the pair’s kerning value. If Metrics or Optical kerning is applied,
the kerning value is displayed in parentheses.
To apply Metrics or Optical kerning to highlighted text, choose the appropri-
ate option from the Kerning pop-up menu. To apply manual kerning, click
between a pair of letters, and then enter a value in the Kerning field or
choose one of the predefined values. Negative values tighten; positive values
loosen.
When letter shapes start to collide, you’ve tightened too far.
Tracking
Tracking is uniform kerning applied to a range of text. You might use tracking
to tighten character spacing for a font that you think is too spacey or loosen
spacing for a font that’s too tight. Or you could track a paragraph tighter or
looser to eliminate a short last line or a widow (the last line of a paragraph
that falls at the top of a page or column).
To apply tracking to highlighted text, enter a value in the Character pane’s
Tracking field or choose one of the predefined values. Negative values
tighten; positive values loosen (in 0.001-em increments).
You might wonder how tracking is different than kerning. They’re essentially
the same thing, with this difference: Tracking applies to a selection of three
or more characters, while kerning is meant to adjust the spacing between just
245
Chapter 16: Handling Character Details

two characters. You use tracking to change the overall tightness of character
spacing, while you use kerning to improve the spacing between letters that
just don’t quite look right compared to the rest of the text.
Leading
Leading refers to the vertical space between lines of type as measured from
baseline to baseline. Leading in InDesign is a character-level format, which
means that you can apply different leading values within a single paragraph.
InDesign looks at each line of text in a paragraph and uses the largest applied
leading value within a line to determine the leading for that line.
By default, InDesign applies Auto Leading to text, which is equal to 120 per-
cent of the type size. As long as you don’t change fonts or type sizes in a
paragraph, Auto Leading works pretty well. But if you do change fonts or
sizes, Auto Leading can result in inconsistent spacing between lines. For this
reason, specifying an actual leading value is safer.
In most cases, using a leading value that is slightly larger than the type size is
a good idea. When the leading value equals the type size, text is said to be set
solid. That’s about as tight as you ever want to set leading, unless you’re
trying to achieve a special typographic effect or working with very large text
sizes in ad-copy headlines. As is the case with kerning and tracking, when
tight leading causes letters to collide — ascenders and descenders are the
first to overlap — you’ve gone too far.
You can change InDesign’s preset Auto Leading value of 120%. To do so,
choose Type➪Paragraph, or press Option+Ô+T or Ctrl+Alt+T, to display the
Paragraph pane. Choose Justification in the palette menu, enter a new value
in the Auto Leading field, and then click OK. (What Auto Leading has to do
with Justification is a mystery.)
To modify the leading value applied to selected text, choose one of the prede-
fined options from the Leading pop-up menu in the Character pane or Control
palette, or enter a leading value in the field. You can enter values from 0 to
5,000 points in 0.001-point increments. You can also use the up and down
arrow keys to change leading in 1-point increments.
Creating and Applying Character Styles
A character style is a set of character formats you can apply to a range of
highlighted text in a single step. For example, you could use a character style
to do any of the following:
246
Part IV: Text Essentials 

 Create a style variation, such as small caps as a lead-in for a paragraph.
With a character style, you can switch the font style to small caps, but also
change the size, color, and font family applied to that selection of text.
 Apply different formatting to such text elements as Web site, e-mail, and
ftp addresses within body text.
 Create other body text variations book and movie titles, or product and
company names.
Using character styles is much the same as using paragraph styles, which we
cover in Chapter 16. First you create the styles; then you apply them. And
you use the Character Styles pane (Type➪Character Styles or Shift+F11),
shown in Figure 16-6, to do both.
To create a character style, follow these steps:
1. Show the Character Styles pane by choosing Type➪Character Styles or
pressing Shift+F11.
2. Choose New Character Style from the Character Styles pane’s pop-up
menu.
The New Character Style dialog box, shown in Figure 16-7, appears.

Chapter 16: Handling Character Details

3. Enter a name for the character style in the Style Name field.
4. To change any character-level formats, choose the appropriate option
from the scroll list to the left of the Style Name field.
The scroll list displays seven options: General, Basic Character Formats,
Advanced Character Formats, Character Color, OpenType Features,
Underline Options, and Strikethrough Options.
5. Modify the settings as desired in the seven panes listed in the 
scroll list.
6. Create a set of related styles with the Based On pop-up menu, which
displays the names of other character styles.
For example, you can create a style called Body Copy/Base Character
that uses the same character attributes as your base Body Copy para-
graph style and then create variations such as Body Text/Emphasis,
Body Text/URLs, and so on. If you used the Based On pop-up menu to
base each of the variations on Body Text/Base Character and you then
modified this “parent” style, your changes are applied to all the variations.
7. If you want, assign a keyboard shortcut to a character style (Windows
users need to make sure that Num Lock is on).
In the Shortcut field, hold down any combination of Ô, Option, and Shift,
or Ctrl, Alt, and Shift, and press any number on the keypad. (Letters and
non-keypad numbers cannot be used for keyboard shortcuts.)
8. When you finish specifying the attributes of your character style, 
click OK.
To apply character styles, select the text that you want styled, then click
the appropriate character style name in the Character Styles pane. That’s
all there is to it! (See Chapter 17 for details on overriding and removing
styles from text.)

 Working with hyphenation and justification
 Modifying other paragraph formats
 Using paragraph styles
P
aragraphs are more than lines of text; they are chunks of information
that help convey meaning by organizing that information into related
bits. Various types of paragraph formatting let you both make those chunks
clearly distinguishable from each other and highlight some chunks, such as
lists or long quotes, from others.
This chapter explains what you need to know about formatting paragraphs,
from setting indents and alignment — the two most commonly used para-
graph attributes — to applying styles to multiple paragraphs for consistency
throughout your document.
Applying Paragraph Formats
InDesign provides three ways to apply paragraph formats:
 Use the controls in the Paragraph pane, shown in Figure 17-1, or their
keyboard shortcuts. This method is great for working on individual para-
graphs, though it’s not the best method when working with lots of para-
graphs you want to have the same formatting.
 Use the controls in the Control palette (be sure that the Type tool 
is active and that the ¶ button is selected in the palette to display 

paragraph-oriented functions). These controls mirror those in the
Paragraph pane, and using them instead of the Paragraph pane can
reduce screen clutter.
 Create and apply paragraph styles, as covered later in this chapter.
Paragraph styles let you apply consistent formatting — and easily
change it to all affected paragraphs — throughout your document.
Whichever method you use — and you’ll use them all — the types of format-
ting available to you is the same.
The Paragraph pane and Control palette provide access to most of InDesign’s
paragraph-formatting options. Also, several of the options have keyboard
shortcuts, as shown in the menus. But to set tabs, you must open the Tabs
pane by choosing Windows➪Type & Tables➪Tabs or by pressing Shift+Ô+T
or Ctrl+Shift+T, as covered in Chapter 18.
Figure 17-1 shows the Paragraph pane. If you choose Hide Options from the
pop-up menu, the Space Before/After, Drop Cap, and Hyphenate controls are
not displayed. You can also use the Control palette’s paragraph formatting
options.

Part IV: Text Essentials 

Specifying Alignment and Indents
Alignment and indents give paragraphs their fundamental appearance.
Indentation helps readers visually separate paragraphs — the indent acts as
the separator, like the blank lines used to separate paragraphs in typewritten
documents — while alignment provides visual texture.
Controlling alignment
The alignment buttons at the top of the Paragraph pane control how a selected
paragraph begins and ends relative to the left and right margins. To apply a
paragraph alignment to selected paragraphs, click one of the buttons. You
can also use the keyboard shortcuts described in the following list. Here’s a
description of each alignment option (the icons themselves illustrate what
they do):
 Align Left (Shift+Ô+L or Ctrl+Shift+L): This alignment places the left
edge of every line at the left margin (the margin can be the frame edge,
frame inset, left indent, or column edge) and fits as many words (or syl-
lables, if the hyphenation is turned on) on the line as possible. In left-
aligned paragraphs, the right margin is said to be ragged because the
leftover space at the right end of each line differs from line to line and
produces a ragged edge.
 Align Center (Shift+Ô+C or Ctrl+Shift+C): This alignment makes both
the left and right edges of the paragraphs equally ragged.
 Align Right (Shift+Ô+R or Ctrl+Shift+R): This is a mirror opposite of
Align Left. The right edge is straight; the left edge is ragged.
 Justify, Last Line Aligned Left (Shift+Ô+J or Ctrl+Shift+J): In justified
text, the left and right ends of each line are flush with the margins.
(There’s more about justification later in this chapter.) Justified text is
nearly always hyphenated — if you don’t hyphenate justified text, spac-
ing between letters and words is very inconsistent. Aligning the last line
flush left is the traditional way of ending a paragraph.
 Justify, Last Line Aligned Center: This produces justified text with the
last line centered.
 Justify, Last Line Aligned Right: This produces justified text with the
last line aligned to the right.
 Justify All Lines (Shift+Ô+F or Ctrl+Shift+F): This produces justified text
with the last line forcibly justified. This option can produce last lines
251
Chapter 17: Handling Paragraph Details

that are very widely spaced. The fewer the number of characters on the
last line, the greater the spacing.
The previous three alignment options are rarely used, and for good
reason. People expect justified text to have the last line aligned left; the
space at the end of the line marks the end of the paragraph. By changing
the position of that last line, you can confuse your reader.
 Align Toward Spine: Essentially, this option automatically creates right-
aligned text on left-hand pages and left-aligned text on right-hand pages.
InDesign chooses a left or right alignment based on the location of the
spine in a facing-pages document.
 Align Away from Spine: This option is the same as Align toward spine
except that the alignment is reversed: Text aligns to the left on left-hand
pages and to the right on right-hand pages.
Adjusting indent controls
The indent controls in the Paragraph pane let you both move the edges of
paragraphs away from the left and/or right margins and indent the first line.
Your options are as follows:
 Left Indent: Moves the left edge of selected paragraphs away from the
left margin by the amount you specify in the field. You can also click the
up and down arrows. Each click increases the value by 1 point; holding
down the Shift while clicking increases the increment to 1 pica.
 Right Indent: Moves the right edge of selected paragraphs away from
the right margin by the amount you specify in the field. You can also use
the up and down arrows.
 First-Line Left Indent: Moves the left edge of the first line of selected
paragraphs away from the left margin by the amount you specify in the
field. You can also click the up and down arrows to adjust the indenta-
tion. The value in the First-Line Left Indent field is added to any Left
Indent value. Using a tab or spaces to indent the first line of a paragraph,
which is what was done in the age of typewriters, is usually not a good
idea. You’re better off specifying a First-Line Left Indent.
 Last-Line Right Indent: Moves the right edge of the last line of selected
paragraphs away from the right margin by the amount you specify in the
field. You can also click the up and down arrows.
Inserting space between paragraphs
To format a lengthy chunk of text with multiple paragraphs, you can indicate
a new paragraph by indenting the paragraph’s first line (by specifying a First-
Line Left Indent value, as covered earlier). Or you can insert some extra
252
Part IV: Text Essentials 

space between the new paragraph and the preceding one. While no rule states
that you can’t use both spacing methods, it’s a good idea to use one or the
other — not both.
What you don’t want to do is insert extra paragraph returns between para-
graphs. Doing so makes it harder to ensure that columns begin with text (as
opposed to blank lines).
 To insert space before selected paragraphs, enter a value in the Space
Before field in the Paragraph pane or Control palette. You can also use
the up and down arrow buttons; each click increases the value by 1
point and holding down Shift key increases the increment to 1 pica.
 The Space After field works the same as the Space Before field but
inserts space below selected paragraphs. If you use Space Before to
space paragraphs, you won’t need to use Space After, and vice versa;
combining both can be confusing.
Controlling space between lines
Leading (pronounced “ledding”) is the space between lines of text within a
paragraph. Even though leading is traditionally an attribute of the paragraph,
InDesign treats it as a character format, which you specify by using the
Leading control in the Character pane or Control palette.
To change this character-oriented approach to affect entire paragraphs,
select the Apply Leading to Entire Paragraphs option in the Type pane of the
Preferences dialog box (choose InDesign➪Preferences on the Mac or Edit➪
Preferences in Windows, or press Ô+K or Ctrl+K).
Another way to control space between lines of text is to use baseline grids, as
described in Chapter 11. Essentially, a baseline grid overrides the leading
specified for paragraphs — you choose whether it overrides the spacing of
every line in the paragraph or just the first line. To align to baseline grids,
you must click the Align to Baseline button in the Paragraph pane (the right-
most button on the bottom of the pane) for the selected paragraphs. To pre-
vent such locking to the baseline, click the Do Not Align to Baseline button to
its immediate left. These same buttons also exist on the right side of the
Control palette.
Controlling where paragraphs break
InDesign’s Keep Options feature lets you prevent widows and orphans; it also
lets you keep paragraphs together when they would otherwise be broken at
the bottom of a column. A widow is the last line of a paragraph that falls at
the top of a column. (The poor thing has been cut off from the rest of the
253
Chapter 17: Handling Paragraph Details

family, the last survivor.) An orphan is the first line of a paragraph that falls
at the bottom of a column. (It, too, has become separated from its family, the
only survivor.)
When you choose Keep Options from the Paragraph pane’s palette menu, the
Keep Options dialog box, shown in Figure 17-2, is displayed.
The Keep Options dialog box holds several options for how paragraphs are
managed as text breaks across columns and pages:
 Keep with Next__Lines: This option applies to two consecutive para-
graphs and controls the number of lines of the second paragraph that
must stay with the first paragraph if a column or page break occurs
within the second paragraph.
 Keep Lines Together: If you click this check box, it will prevent para-
graphs from breaking. When this box is checked, the two radio buttons
below it become available. The radio buttons present an either/or choice.
One must be selected; At Start/End of Paragraph is selected by default.
 All Lines in Paragraph: This option prevents a paragraph from being
broken at the end of a column or page. When a column or page break
occurs within a paragraph to which this setting has been applied, the
entire paragraph moves to the next column or page.
 At Start/End of Paragraph: Select this check box to control widows and
orphans. When this button is selected, the two fields below it become
available:
• Start lines: This field controls orphans. The value you enter is the
minimum number of lines at the beginning of a paragraph that
must be placed at the bottom of a column when a paragraph is
split by a column ending.
• End lines: This field controls widows. The value you enter is the
minimum number of lines at the end of a paragraph that must be
Figure 17-2:
The Keep
Options
dialog box.
254
Part IV: Text Essentials 

placed at the top of a column when a paragraph is split by a
column ending.
 Start Paragraph: From this pop-up menu, choose Anywhere to let the
paragraph begin where it would fall naturally in the sequence of text (no
forced break). Choose In Next Column to force a paragraph to begin in
the next column or frame; choose On Next Page to force a paragraph to
begin on the next page (such as for chapter headings). Your other
choices are similar: On Next Odd Page and On Next Even Page.
Adding Drop Caps
Drop caps are enlarged capital letters that are often used to embellish para-
graphs (usually the first paragraph of a chapter or story) and to draw atten-
tion to paragraphs. In the Paragraph pane or Control palette, InDesign lets
you specify the number of letters you want to include in a drop cap and the
number of lines you want to drop them down into.
To add one or more drop caps to selected paragraphs, enter a number in the
Drop Cap Number of Characters field in the Paragraph pane or Control
palette. The number you enter determines how many characters in a selected
paragraph will be made into drop caps. To specify the number of lines a drop
cap will extend into a paragraph (and therefore the height of the drop cap),
enter a number in the Drop Cap Number of Lines field.
After you create a drop cap, you can modify it by highlighting it and changing
any of its character formats — font, size, color, and so on — by using the
Character pane or Control palette as well as other panes, such as Stroke and
Swatches. Figure 17-3 shows two examples of drop caps.

Chapter 17: Handling Paragraph Details

Controlling Hyphenation 
and Justification
Hyphenation is the placement of hyphens between syllables in words that
won’t fit at the end of a line of text. A hyphen is a signal to the reader that the
word continues on the next line. InDesign gives you the option to turn para-
graph hyphenation on or off. If you choose to hyphenate, you can customize
the settings that determine when and where hyphens are inserted.
Justification is the addition or removal of space between words and/or letters
that produces the flush-left/flush-right appearance of justified paragraphs.
InDesign’s justification controls let you specify how space is added or removed
when paragraphs are justified. If you justify paragraphs, you almost certainly
want to hyphenate them, too. If you opt for left-aligned paragraphs, whether
to hyphenate is a personal choice.
InDesign offers both manual and automatic hyphenation.
Manual hyphenation
To break a particular word in a specific place, you can place a discretionary
hyphen in the word. If the word won’t entirely fit at the end of a line in a
hyphenated paragraph, InDesign will use the discretionary hyphen to split
the word if the part of the word before the hyphen fits on the line. To insert a
discretionary hyphen, use the shortcut Shift+Ô+– (hyphen) or Ctrl+Shift+–
(hyphen) in the text where you want the hyphen to appear.
If a word has a discretionary hyphen, and hyphenation is necessary, InDesign
breaks the word only at that point. But you can place multiple discretionary
hyphens within a single word. If a word needs to be hyphenated, InDesign will
use the hyphenation point that produces the best results.
You can prevent a particular word from being hyphenated either by placing a
discretionary hyphen in front of the first letter or by highlighting the word
and choosing No Break from the palette menu of the Control palette or from
the palette menu of the Character pane.
Automatic hyphenation
To have InDesign automatically hyphenate selected paragraphs, all you have
to do is check the Hyphenate check box in the Paragraph pane or Control
256
Part IV: Text Essentials 

palette. (The Hyphenate check box is displayed only if you choose Show
Options from the palette menu.)
You can control how InDesign actually performs the hyphenation via the
Hyphenation option in the palette menu. When you choose Hyphenation, the
Hyphenation Settings dialog box, shown in Figure 17-4, appears.
The options in the Hyphenation Settings dialog box include:
 Hyphenate check box: This is a duplicate of the Hyphenate check box 
in the Paragraph pane and Control palette. If you didn’t check it before
opening the Hyphenation Settings dialog box, you can check it here.
 Words with at Least__Letters: This is where you specify the number of
letters in the shortest word you want to hyphenate.
 After First__Letters: In this field, enter the minimum number of charac-
ters that can precede a hyphen.
 Before Last__Letters: The number entered in this field determines the
minimum number of characters that can follow a hyphen.
 Hyphenation Limit: In this field, you specify the number of consecutive
lines that can be hyphenated. Several consecutive hyphens produce an
awkward, ladder-like look, so consider entering a small number, such as
2 or 3, in this field.
 Hyphenation Zone: The entry in this field applies only to nonjustified
text and only when the Adobe Single-Line Composer option is selected
(in the Paragraph pane’s palette menu). A hyphenation point must fall
within the distance specified in this field in relation to the right margin
in order to be used. Acceptable hyphenation points that do not fall
within the specified hyphenation zone are ignored. You can also use the
Better Spacing/Fewer Hyphens slider below the field to pick a value
rather than entering a value in the Hyphenation Zone field.
 Hyphenate Capitalized Words: If you check this box, InDesign will
hyphenate, when necessary, capitalized words. If you don’t check this
Figure 17-4:
The
Hyphenation
Settings
dialog box.
257
Chapter 17: Handling Paragraph Details

box, a capitalized word that would otherwise be hyphenated will get
bumped to the next line, which may cause excessive spacing in the 
previous line.
 Hyphenate Last Word: Check this box to allow InDesign to break the last
word in a paragraph. Otherwise, InDesign will move the entire word to
the last line and space the preceding text as necessary.
Controlling justification
To control how justification is achieved, you can:
 Condense or expand the width of spaces between words.
 Add or remove space between letters.
 Condense or expand the width of characters.
The options in the Justification dialog box, shown in Figure 17-5, let you spec-
ify the degree to which InDesign will adjust normal word spaces, character
spacing, and character width to achieve justification. Access this dialog box
via the palette menu in the Control palette or in the Paragraph pane, or by
pressing Option+Shift+Ô+J or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+J. When specifying values in the
Justification dialog box, Minimum values must be smaller than Desired
values, which in turn must be smaller than Maximum values.
The Justification dialog box lets you specify the following options:
 Word Spacing: Enter the percentage of a character that you want to use
whenever possible in the Desired field. (The default value is 100%, which
uses a font’s built-in width.) Enter the minimum acceptable percentage
in the Minimum field; enter the maximum acceptable percentage in the
Maximum field. The smallest value you can enter is 0%; the largest is
1,000%.
 Letter Spacing: The default value of 0% in this field uses a font’s built-in
letter spacing. In the Desired field, enter a positive value to add space
(in increments of 1% of an en space) between all letter pairs; enter a 
Figure 17-5:
The
Justification
dialog box.
258
Part IV: Text Essentials 

negative value to remove space. Enter the minimum acceptable percent-
age in the Minimum field; enter the maximum acceptable percentage in
the Maximum field.
 Glyph Scaling: The default value of 100% uses a character’s normal
width. In the Desired field, enter a positive value to expand all character
widths; enter a negative value to condense character widths. Enter the
minimum acceptable percentage in the Minimum field and the maximum
acceptable percentage in the Maximum field. If you do apply glyph scal-
ing, it’s best to keep it to a range of 97 to 103 percent at most.
If you use the Adobe Paragraph Composer option (explained in the following
sections) for justified paragraphs, specifying a narrow range between minimum
and maximum Word Spacing, Letter Spacing, and Glyph Scaling will generally
produce good-looking results. However, if you choose the Adobe Single-Line
Composer option, a broader range between Minimum and Maximum gives
the composer more leeway in spacing words and letters and hyphenating
words and can produce better-looking results. The best way to find out what
values work best is to experiment with several settings. Print out hard copies
and let your eyes decide which values produce the best results.
Composing text
The Paragraph pane’s palette menu offers two options for implementing the
hyphenation and justification settings you establish: the Adobe Single-Line
Composer and the Adobe Paragraph Composer. (These options are also avail-
able in the Justification dialog box, covered in the previous section.)
Adobe Single-Line Composer
In single-line composition, hyphenation, and justification settings are applied
to each line in a paragraph, one line at a time. The effect of modifying the
spacing of one line on the lines above and below it is not considered in single-
line composition, so it can cause poor spacing.
Adobe Paragraph Composer
InDesign’s Adobe Paragraph Composer is selected by default. It takes a
broader approach to composition than the Adobe Single-Line Composer by
looking at the entire paragraph at once. If a poorly spaced line can be fixed
by adjusting the spacing of a previous line, the Adobe Paragraph Composer
will reflow the previous line.
The Adobe Paragraph Composer is more sophisticated than the Single-Line
Composer, offering better overall spacing because it will sacrifice optimal
spacing a bit on one line to prevent really bad spacing on another, something
the single-line method does not do.
259
Chapter 17: Handling Paragraph Details

Ruling Your Paragraphs
If you want to place a horizontal line within text so that the line moves with the
text when editing causes the text to reflow — an often effective highlighting
device — you need to create a paragraph rule. A paragraph rule looks much
like a line created with the line tool but behaves like a text character. Here’s
how to create paragraph rules:
1. Select the paragraph(s) to which you want to apply a rule above
and/or a rule below and then choose Paragraph Rules from the
Paragraph pane’s or Control palette’s palette menu or use the shortcut
Option+Ô+J or Ctrl+Alt+J.
You can also specify rules as part of a paragraph style. The Paragraph
Rules dialog box, shown in Figure 17-6, is displayed.
2. Choose Rule Above or Rule Below and then click Rule On.
To add rules both above and below, click Rule On for both options and
specify their settings separately. To see the rule while you create it,
select the Preview option.
3. Choose a predefined thickness from the Weight pop-up menu or enter
a value in the Weight field.
4. Choose a rule type from the Type pop-up menu. You can choose from
17 types, including dashed, striped, dotted, and wavy lines.
5. Choose a color for the rule from the Color pop-up menu. This menu lists
the colors displayed in the Swatches pane (Window➪Swatches or F5).
6. From the Width pop-up menu, choose Column to have the rule extend
from the left edge of the column to the right edge of the column;
choose Text to have the rule extend from the left edge of the frame or
column to the right.
Figure 17-6:
The
Paragraph
Rules dialog
box.
260
Part IV: Text Essentials 

7. To indent the rule from the left and/or right edges, enter values in the
Left Indent and/or Right Indent fields.
8. Control the vertical position of the rule by entering a value in the
Offset field. For a rule above, the offset value is measured upward from
the baseline of the first line in a paragraph to the bottom of the rule; for
a rule below, the offset is measured downward from the baseline of the
last line in a paragraph to the top of the rule.
9. Check the Overprint Stroke box if you want to print a rule on top of
any underlying colors. This ensures that any misregistration during
printing will not result in white areas around the rule where the paper
shows through. There’s a similar Overprint Gap check box for lines that
have a Gap Color.
10. Click OK to close the dialog box, implement your changes, and return
to the document.
To remove a paragraph rule, click in the paragraph to which the rule is
applied, choose Paragraph Rules from the Paragraph pane’s pop-up menu,
uncheck the Rule On box, and then click OK.
Paragraph Styles
If you’re laying out pages and formatting text, creating styles for repetitive
text elements is a great idea: Doing so ensures consistent formatting, and it
lets you change all paragraphs at the same time just by updating the style
applied to them. The Paragraph Styles pane (select Type➪Paragraph Styles
or press F11) is where you both create and apply styles.
Creating paragraph styles
InDesign comes with a predefined default paragraph style, called [Basic
Paragraph], that text in a new frame automatically has applied to it. You can
edit [Basic Paragraph] like any other style.
Here’s how you create a paragraph style:
1. If it’s not displayed, show the Paragraph Styles pane by choosing
Type➪Paragraph Styles or by pressing F11.
The New Paragraph Style dialog box is displayed.
261
Chapter 17: Handling Paragraph Details

2. Enter a name for the style in the Style Name field. Be descriptive with
your style names. For example, for body copy, use a style name along
the lines of Body Copy.
3. To change any character or paragraph formats, choose the appropri-
ate category from the list on the left side of the dialog box, shown in
Figure 17-7, and make your changes.
In the General pane of the New Paragraph Style dialog box, the Based On pop-
up menu displays the names of other paragraph styles. You use this feature
to create families of styles. Thus, if you change a style that other styles are
based on, all those styles are updated with the new settings.
When you enter text, the paragraph formats of the preceding paragraph are
automatically used for the subsequent paragraph unless you create paragraph
styles that automatically change paragraph formats from one paragraph to
another. To have InDesign automatically apply a different style to the next
paragraph when you type in text, choose a style name from the Next Style
pop-up menu while defining a style. For example, when you define a style
named Headline, you might choose Byline as the next style, so after you type
in a headline, the next paragraph will be formatted for a byline. Obviously,
you need to have the Byline style available.
4. When you finish specifying the attributes of the paragraph style, 
click OK.
The easiest way to create a paragraph style is to manually apply character
and paragraph formats to a sample paragraph and then — with the sample
paragraph selected — follow the steps below. If no text is selected when you
create a style, you have to specify all the desired character and paragraph
formats as you create the style, which is more difficult than formatting a
paragraph in advance.
Figure 17-7:
The New
Paragraph
Style dialog
box.
262
Part IV: Text Essentials 

Applying paragraph styles
To apply a paragraph style, just click within a paragraph or highlight text in a
range of paragraphs and then click the style name in the Paragraph Styles
pane or press its keyboard shortcut. (Windows users must make sure Num
Lock is on when using shortcuts for styles.)
If your group of selected paragraphs uses more than one paragraph style, the
Paragraph Styles pane will display the text (Mixed) at the lower left.
When you apply a style to selected paragraphs, all local formats and applied
character styles are retained. All other formats are replaced by those of the
applied style. If you want to override those attributes, choose Clear Overrides
from the Paragraph Styles pane’s palette menu. If you want to remove a style
from a paragraph, so it’s not changed if the style is later changed, choose
Break Link to Style from the palette menu.
Another way to apply paragraph (and character) styles is by using the Quick
Apply feature in InDesign CS2. Quick Apply is a consolidated list of styles that
you access by choosing Edit➪Quick Apply or by pressing Ô+Return or
Ctrl+Enter. If you have selected text or have the text-insertion point active,
the Quick Apply palette presents all paragraph, character, and object styles
available. You can scroll down to the one you want, or you can type the first
few letters of the style name in the text field at the top to jump to styles
beginning with those letters and then navigate to the one you want. Then
press Return or Enter, which brings you back to where you were working with
your text. Pressing Ô+Return or Ctrl+Enter again closes the Quick Apply
palette.
For users who are working on layouts from their keyboards — perhaps a
layout artist who’s working on a notebook while commuting — Quick Apply
can be handy because you can switch to it, apply the style, and return to
your text without touching the mouse.

ith the myriad of text-formatting techniques available in InDesign, you
can create some snazzy and sophisticated effects. You can stretch,
skew, rotate, and color text. You can use a wide range of characters for bul-
lets. You can add shadows and feathering effects to give words a dramatic
flair. As with all good things, moderation in your use of text effects will keep
your documents looking professional. This chapter shows you some InDesign
features that can produce typographic special effects and gives some sugges-
tions on when to use them. (Chapters 16 and 17 cover more prosaic format-
ting controls.)
Using Bulleted and Numbered Lists
Automatic bullets and numbering are available as a paragraph format in
InDesign. You access these options (after selecting the paragraphs you want
to make into automatic lists, of course) by choosing Bullets and Numbering
Options from the Paragraph pane’s or Control palette’s palette menus. Doing
so displays the Bullets and Numbering dialog box shown in Figure 18-1.
Bulleted and numbered lists are new to InDesign CS2, although a less capable
version was available for InDesign CS as part of the $49 PageMaker Plug-in
Pack.

To set bullets or numbered lists in the Bullets and Numbering dialog box, first
select either Bullets or Numbers from the List Type pop-up menu, and then
follow these steps (select the Preview check box to see the results of your
choices before you finalize them):
1. For bullets, choose a bullet character from the Bullet Character area.
The area will show bullet characters available for the current font; you
can change the selection by changing the selected font or by clicking the
Add button.
For numbered lists, choose a numbering style from the Style pop-up
menu and a separator character from the Separator pop-up menu and
type a starting number in the Start At field. In the Start At field, note
that if multiple paragraphs are selected, the starting number will apply
just to the first paragraph, and the others will be numbered consecu-
tively from that start value.
2. Adjust the font settings for the bullets or numbers by using the Font
Family, Type Style, Size, and Color pop-up menus. The default settings
match the formatting that is currently applied to the selected paragraphs.
InDesign sometimes refers to Type Style as Font Style in its user interface
and documentation. They’re the same thing.
3. In the Bullet or Number Position section of the dialog box, set the
indentation for the list. Using the Position pop-up menu, choose
Hanging to have a hanging indent (the bullet or number extends to the
left of the text that follows, like the numbered list you’re reading right
Figure 18-1:
The 
Bullets and
Numbering
dialog box.
266
Part IV: Text Essentials 

now) or Flush Left to have the bullet or number and the following text all
align to the paragraph’s left margin.
4. When you finish formatting the bulleted or numbered list, click OK.
It’s possible that the bulleted or numbered list you’re working with was first
created in a word processor and then placed in InDesign. Perhaps the writer
simply used an asterisk followed by a space to indicate a bullet, or used the
word processor’s automatic bullet or numbering feature. You can deal with
imported bulleted and numbered lists as follows:
 If the document imported into InDesign was formatted with an auto-
matic bullet or numbering feature, the numbers and their punctuation
arrive in InDesign intact. However, these won’t use the InDesign bullets
and numbering feature, so new bullets and list numbers won’t be auto-
matically added or adjusted when you edit the copy in InDesign. Your
best bet is to override these imported paragraphs with an InDesign para-
graph style that uses InDesign’s bullets and numbering formatting capa-
bilities. You need to delete the word-processor-generated bullets and
numbers from such imported text and then apply InDesign’s automatic
bullets or numbering. You might be able to use the Find/Change dialog
box (Edit➪Find/Change or Ô+F or Ctrl+F) to get rid of the now extrane-
ous bullet characters imported from the word processor.
 InDesign sometimes converts a word processor’s automatic bullets to
characters in the current font; they will need to be changed to bullets. Or,
rather than using automatic bullets, the writer might have typed aster-
isks, hyphens, or another character to indicate bullets. After you deter-
mine what characters indicate bullets in your text, use Find/Change to
change them to the bullet character you want.
For the bullets in a list, you’re not limited to using the small round bullet (•)
included in most typefaces. You can use any character in the body text font, or
you can switch to a symbol or pi font and choose a more decorative character.
Zapf Dingbats and Wingdings are the most common symbol fonts, offering an
array of boxes, arrows, crosses, stars, and checkmarks.
Labeling Paragraphs
Along with using drop caps, which we cover in Chapter 16, changing the for-
matting of the first few words in a paragraph as a label can serve as a visual
indicator that the reader has arrived at the beginning of a story, chapter, or
new topic. To experiment with label formatting, use the attributes available
via the Character pane or Control palette and their palette menus, such as
267
Chapter 18: Tricks with Text

font changes, horizontal scale, or small caps. After you decide on the format-
ting for labels, you can apply it by using character styles after paragraph
styles are applied — and after the text is final. You might also be able to use
the nested styles feature if the label text follows a specific pattern, such as a
specific number of words or characters or an entire sentence.
The following descriptions show frequently used label formatting:
 Boldface: Bold type is often used for titles and subheads in magazines,
newspapers, and reports. To apply boldface in InDesign, select the bold
version of the typeface from the Type Style pop-up menu in the
Character pane.
 Italics: Italic text is a good choice for emphasizing specific words and for
applying to tertiary heads. To apply italics in InDesign, select the
oblique version of the typeface from the Type Style pop-up menu on the
Character pane.
 Underlines: Underlined text isn’t used as frequently as it once was,
simply because page-layout programs such as InDesign offer more
sophisticated options for labeling text. Still, you might have occasion to
use underlines, such as to emphasize a label. Use the Underline com-
mand in the menu on the Character pane. Note that you have no control
over the style, thickness, or placement of the underline if you use this
option; for custom underlines, use the controls described later in this
chapter.
 SMALL CAPS: Small caps offer a subtle, classic look that blends well with the
rest of the document. You have two choices for applying small caps from
the Character pane: Choose a small-caps variation of a typeface from the
Type Style pop-up menu or choose the Small Caps command from the
palette menu.
 Typeface change: Rather than relying on different variations of a font,
you can use a different font altogether, such as Futura Medium, for a
label. To contrast with serif body text, you might choose a sans-serif
typeface that complements the look of your publication. To apply a dif-
ferent typeface, use the Font Family pop-up menu in the Character pane
or Control palette.
 Scaled text: Scaling text horizontally — up 10 or 20 percent — is a
subtle effect that makes the section of text visually distinct. Scaling text
vertically, however, can be too subtle unless combined with boldface or
another style. Use the Horizontal Scale and Vertical Scale fields in the
Character pane or Control palette to scale text.
 Size change: Bumping the size of a label up a point or two is another
subtle design choice. To change the size of type, use the Font Size field
in the Character pane or Control palette.

Adding Special Type Treatments
Skilled graphic designers make decisions based on what best serves the con-
tent. In doing so, they often rely on special typographic techniques. For
example, the use of reverse type helps to break up pages and to organize
text, while careful formatting of fractions and hanging punctuation add a pro-
fessional touch.
Reversing type out of its background
Reversed type is white type on a black background rather than black type on
a white background. Of course, reversed type doesn’t have to be white on
black; it can be any lighter color on a darker color. You often find reversed
type in table headings, kickers (explanatory blurbs following headlines), and
decorative layout elements.
To lighten the text, highlight it with the Type tool, click the Fill button on the
Tools palette, and choose a light color from the Swatches pane (Window➪
Swatches or F5). For the dark background, you have three options: filling the
text frame with a darker color, making the text frame transparent and placing
it on top of darker objects, or placing a thick, dark ruling line behind the text.
For the first two options, select the text frame with the Selection tool or the
Direct Selection tool and then click the Fill button on the Tools palette.
 To fill the text frame with a darker color, click a color from the 
Swatches pane.
 To make the text frame transparent, click the Apply None button on the
Tools palette. Then place the text frame in front of a darker object or
graphic.
To create reversed type that is not in its own text frame, use a ruling line of
the appropriate width (at least a couple points larger than the text size). If
you use a Ruling Line Above, move the line down behind the text; if you use a
Ruling Line Below, move it up. Figure 18-2 shows reversed type used as a
heading, as well as the Paragraph Rules dialog box and the settings used to
create the effect. (To access this dialog box, choose Paragraph Rules from
the palette menu of the Control palette or Paragraph pane, or press
Option+Ô+J or Ctrl+Alt+J.)
We explain how to create and adjust ruling lines in greater detail in Chapter 17.

Chapter 18: Tricks with Text

Creating sidebars and pull-quotes
A sidebar is supplemental text that is often formatted differently from the rest
of the document and placed within a shaded or outlined box. Sidebars help
break up text-heavy pages and call attention to information that is often inter-
esting but not essential to the main story.
Particularly in text-heavy publications, pulling in-depth information or
related text into sidebars can help provide visual relief. To create a sidebar,
you usually place the text in its own frame, then stroke the frame and option-
ally fill it with a tint. To inset the text from the edges of the frame, use the
Text Frame Options dialog box (Object➪Text Frame Options or Ô+B or
Ctrl+B).
A pull-quote is a catchy one- or two-line excerpt from a publication that is
enlarged and reformatted to achieve both editorial and design objectives.
Pull quotes draw readers into articles with excerpts that do everything from
summarize the content to provide shock value. From the design perspective,
pull-quotes break up static columns and offer opportunities for typographic
treatment that emphasizes the content, such as colors and typefaces that
support the mood of an article.
Figure 18-2:

guide uses

270
Part IV: Text Essentials 

To create a pull-quote, copy and paste the relevant text into its own text
frame and then reformat the text and frame as you wish. Use the Text Wrap
pane (Window➪Text Wrap or Option+Ô+W or Ctrl+Alt+W) to control how
text in columns wraps around the pull-quote.
Formatting fractions
Creating fractions that are formatted correctly can be handy. Compare the
top line in Figure 18-3, which is not formatted appropriately for a fraction, to
the bottom line, which is correctly formatted. Although InDesign doesn’t pro-
vide an automatic fraction maker, you can use expert typefaces or character
formats to achieve professional-looking fractions.
Applying a fraction typeface
Some expert typefaces include a variation, appropriately called Fractions,
that includes a number of common fractions, such as 1⁄2, 1⁄3, 1⁄4, and 3⁄4. Adobe has
Expert Collection variants for many of its popular fonts; these collections
include true small caps, true fractions, and other typographic characters.
Many OpenType formats include these characters as well. You can also use a
symbol font, though the numerals may not exactly match the appearance of
numerals in the rest of your text because symbol fonts typically use plain
fonts like Helvetica as their basis.
To use a true fraction from an Expert Collection or OpenType font, choose
Type➪Glyph, select the font and face from the pop-up menus at the bottom
of the dialog box shown in Figure 18-3, and then select the fraction you want
to use.
Formatting fractions manually
If you’re dealing with a wide range of fractions in something like a cookbook,
you probably won’t find all the fractions you need in your Expert Collection
Figure 18-3:
In the
second line
of text, the
“7/8” text is
formatted
correctly
with an

271
Chapter 18: Tricks with Text

or OpenType font. Because it would be difficult to format fractions such as 3⁄16
exactly the same as an expert font’s 1⁄4, you might opt for formatting all the
fractions manually.
Expert fractions are approximately the same size as a single character in that
font, and this is your eventual goal in formatting a fraction manually. Usually,
you achieve this by decreasing the size of the two numerals, raising the
numerator (the first, or top, number in the fraction), and kerning on either
side of the slash as necessary.
Macintosh fonts provide another option for refining fractions: a special kind
of slash called a virgule, which is smaller and at more of an angle than a regu-
lar slash. Press Option+Shift+1 to enter a virgule, then kern around it as you
would a slash.
Unless you rarely use fractions, by all means save your formatting as charac-
ter styles. You can apply the formats with a keystroke or use Find/Change
(Edit➪Find/Change or Ô+F or Ctrl+F) to locate numbers and selectively apply
the appropriate character style.
Hanging punctuation
When display type, such as a pull-quote or headline type in ads, is left-aligned
or justified, the edges can look uneven due to the gaps above, below, or next
to quotation marks, other punctuation, and some capital letters. Notice the
text frame on the left in Figure 18-4, which does not have hanging punctua-
tion. To correct the unevenness, you can use a technique called hanging punc-
tuation, or Optical Margin Alignment, which extends the punctuation slightly
beyond the edges of the rest of the text, as shown in the text frame on the
right in Figure 18-4.
Figure 18-4:
Notice the
difference
between the

272
Part IV: Text Essentials 

The “edge” of text is defined by the edges of the text frame or any Inset
Spacing specified in the Text Frame Options dialog box (Object➪Text Frame
Options or Ô+B or Ctrl+B).
The Optical Margin Alignment feature automates hanging punctuation,
extending punctuation and the edges of some glyphs (such as a capital T )
slightly outside the edges of the text. Unfortunately, you can’t control how
much the characters “hang” outside the text boundaries — InDesign decides
that for you. And Optical Margin Alignment applies to all the text frames in a
story, rather than to highlighted text. Therefore, you need to isolate into its
own story any text for which you want hanging punctuation.
To specify Optical Margin Alignment, select any text frame in a story and
choose Window➪Type & Tables➪Story. Check the Optical Margin Alignment
option, as shown in Figure 18-4.
Optical Margin Alignment usually improves the look of display type. However,
Optical Margin Alignment will actually cause columns of body text to look
uneven (because they are).
Adding Color to Text
Adding color to text is another way to add visual interest. But just because
you’re printing on a four-color printing press or a color printer doesn’t mean
you should get carried away with coloring text. Keep your content legible and
unified, but feel free to explore extending beyond all black ink on white paper.
Using color in headlines, banners, subheads, and pull-quotes is common
these days. However, you rarely see color applied to body text.
In general, the smaller the type, the darker its color should be — with pastels
reserved for large text, bright colors for bold text, and dark colors for body
text. InDesign lets you make an entire character one color, or make the fill
(inside) and stroke (outlines) of a character two different colors. You can
even apply gradients to fills and strokes.
To color text, follow these steps:
1. Click the Type tool in the Tools palette.
2. Highlight the text you want to color.
3. Click the Fill button or the Stroke button on the Tools palette to spec-
ify whether you’re coloring the character or its outline.
273
Chapter 18: Tricks with Text

4. If necessary, open the Swatches pane by choosing Window➪Swatches
or by pressing F5.
5. Click a color, tint, or gradient swatch to apply it to the stroke or fill.
6. To specify the thickness of the stroke, use the Stroke pane (Window➪
Stroke or F10); to apply a custom gradient not available as a swatch to
the stroke or fill, use the Gradient pane (Window➪Gradient).
Rotating Text
No doubt you’ve seen publications with rotated text. Perhaps you saw a mag-
azine with section titles listed vertically in the outside margin of the page, a
newsletter with nameplates running horizontally down the first page, or a
catalog with sale prices splashed diagonally across pages.
In InDesign, you rotate text by placing the text you want to rotate in its own
frame and then rotating the entire frame. You can rotate any object from 180
degrees to –180 degrees — basically, full circle. You can rotate in increments
as small as 0.01 degree by using the Rotate tool or as small as 0.001 degree 
by using the Rotation Angle field on the Transform pane or Control palette.
(Figure 18-5 shows the rotation settings in the Control palette.)
Figure 18-5:

the right
page edge

274
Part IV: Text Essentials 

Using the Rotation Angle field
Use the Rotation Angle field on Control palette or the Transform pane if you
know the angle you need. For example, to run text along the right side of the
page, like in the travel guide shown in Figure 18-5, you rotate the frame –90
degrees. To use the Rotation Angle field, select the object with the Selection
tool. Then choose an option from the pop-up menu, which offers 30-degree
increments, or enter a value in the field. Press Return or Enter to rotate the
object.
When entering rotation angles, a positive number rotates the frame clock-
wise, and a negative number rotates the frame counterclockwise.
Using the Rotate tool
If you want to experiment with rotating text to different angles while you
design your pages, use the Rotate tool. To rotate items freehand, select the
Rotate tool by clicking it in the Tools palette.
If the object you want to rotate isn’t selected, Ô+click it or Ctrl+click it. Drag in
any direction to rotate the object, releasing the mouse button as necessary to
check the placement and any text wrap. To restrict the rotation to 45-degree
increments, hold the Shift key while you drag.
You can also double-click the Rotate tool to get a dialog box in which you
enter a precise rotation value. Not only can you set the rotation amount, you
can control whether the content rotates with the frame or whether the rota-
tion applies to a copy of the item.
Scaling Text
While you’re figuring out the design specifications for a layout, you’ll proba-
bly find yourself changing type sizes, object placement, and colors as you go.
Changing the size of text can become a bit tedious — especially if the text 
is tucked into its own frame. You have to select the Type tool, highlight the
text, enter a new size, and then often switch to the Selection tool to resize 
the frame so the text doesn’t overflow. For a more interactive method of
resizing text, you can use the Scale tool to resize the text and its frame at 
the same time.
275
Chapter 18: Tricks with Text

To use the Scale tool, click it in the Tools palette. If the text frame is not
already selected it, you need to Ô+click or Ctrl+click it. Then simply drag any
frame edge or handle in any direction. To scale proportionally so the text is
not distorted, press the Shift key while you drag. The amount of scaling is
reported in the Scale X Percentage and Scale Y Percentage fields in the
Control palette or in the Transform pane.
Be careful when you scale text frames and the text within them. If you modify
multiple text frames that contain similar items (such as headlines), you could
end up with inconsistent text formatting for items that should be similar, and
this design error will not give your document the professional look you
desire. Scale text only when the text is used as a unique element, such as a
headline in an ad.
Custom Underline and 
Strikethrough Options
You can use InDesign to create text with custom underlines and strikethroughs.
Although you should use these effects sparingly, they can be effective for
signs and other design-oriented text presentations, such as the examples
shown in Figure 18-6.
You can find both the Underline Options and Strikethrough Options menu
items in the Character pane’s and Control palette’s palette menus, and you
can use these menu options to get just the look you’re interested in. (Note
that you must have the character variant of the Control palette selected to
access these options; click the A button to display it.) The process for setting
both Underline Options and Strikethrough Options is similar:
1. Highlight the text to which you want the custom underline or
strikethrough.
2. Specify the thickness, type, color, and other settings for the line that
makes up the underline or the strikethrough line.
Figure 18-6:
Examples 
of custom
underlines
and strike-
throughs.
276
Part IV: Text Essentials 

If you choose an underline or strikethrough line type that has gaps —
such as dashed, dotted, or striped lines — you can also choose a gap
color. Figure 18-7 shows the Underline Options dialog box.
3. Apply the underline style via the Control palette, Character pane, or
keyboard shortcut (Shift+Ô+U or Ctrl+Shift+U). Apply the strikethrough
style via the Control palette, Character pane, or keyboard shortcut
(Shift+Ô+/ or Ctrl+Shift+/).
Note that a custom underline or strikethrough created and applied this way
is in effect only for the first text to which an underline or strikethrough is
applied. InDesign reverts to the standard settings the next time you apply an
underline or strikethrough. If you want to use a custom underline or
strikethrough setting repeatedly, you should define the setting as part of a
character style.
Working with Tabs and Tables
Tabs and tables in InDesign work somewhat like the same functions in
Microsoft Word, so if you’re familiar with Word’s tabs and tables, it’ll be a
quick adjustment to InDesign’s, at least for the basic capabilities.

Chapter 18: Tricks with Text

Setting tabs
To set tabs in InDesign you use the Tabs pane, which floats above your text
so that you can keep it open until you’re finished experimenting with tabs. To
open the Tabs pane, choose Window➪Type & Tables➪Tabs or press Shift+Ô+T
or Ctrl+Shift+T. Figure 18-8 shows the Tabs pane along with a simple table cre-
ated using one tab stop.
Four buttons — Left, Center, Right, and Align On — on the Tabs pane let you
control how the text aligns with the tab you’re creating. The Align On option is
usually used for decimal tabs, which means that a period in the text aligns on
the tab stop. But you can align on any character, not just periods — simply
specify the align-on character in the Align On field. (If you enter nothing in the
Align On field, InDesign assumes you want to align to periods.) 
The X field of the Tabs pane lets you specify a position for a new tab stop.
You can type a value in this field in 0.01-point increments, and then press
Shift+Enter or Shift+Return to create a tab. InDesign positions tabs relative to
the left edge of the text frame or column. Or you can just click the mouse on
the ruler where you want the tab to be, as described later.
Rather than typing values in the X field, you can position tabs by clicking on
the ruler at the bottom of the Tabs pane. You can also drag tab stops within
the ruler.
If you need a tab flush with the right margin, for example, to position a 
dingbat at the end of the story, press Shift+Tab — there’s no need to use 
the Tabs pane.
Figure 18-8:

pane and 
a table

278
Part IV: Text Essentials 

InDesign lets you specify up to eight characters, including special characters
that will repeat to fill any white space. This is called a leader. When you set a
leader for a tab stop, the leaders actually fill any space prior to that tab stop
(between the previous text and the tab location). To spread out the leader
characters, type spaces between the characters you enter. Don’t enter spaces
before and after a single character though, as that will result in two spaces
between the characters when the pattern repeats (unless that’s the look
you’re going for).
In addition to setting tabs in the Tabs pane, InDesign provides two additional
options through the palette menu: Clear All and Repeat Tab.
 The Clear All command deletes any tabs you’ve created, and any text
positioned with tabs reverts to the position of the default tab stops.
(You can delete an individual tab stop by dragging its icon off the ruler.)
 The Repeat Tab command lets you create a string of tabs across the ruler
that are all the same distance apart. When you select a tab on the ruler
and choose this command, InDesign measures the distance between the
selected tab and the previous tab (or, if it’s the first tab on the ruler, the
distance between the selected tab and the left indent/text inset). The
program then uses this distance to place new tabs, with the same align-
ment, all the way across the ruler. InDesign repeats tabs only to the right
of the selected tab, but it inserts tabs between other tab stops.
Setting up tables
You can create tables using tabs. But the more complex the table, the more
work that requires. So make your life easier and use InDesign’s table editor,
which lets you specify almost any attribute imaginable in a table through the
Table pane and the Table menu.
InDesign lets you import tables from Microsoft Word, RTF, and Microsoft
Excel files, including some of their cell formatting. Likewise, you can convert
their tables to tabbed text by using the options in the Import Options dialog
box that is accessible when you place a file through the Place dialog box
(File➪Place, or Ô+D or Ctrl+D), as covered in Chapter 14.
To create a table in InDesign, you first create or select a text frame with the
Type tool and then choose Table➪Insert Table or press Option+Shift+Ô+T or
Ctrl+Alt+Shift+T. That produces the Insert Table dialog box, where you type
the number of body rows and columns and the number of header and footer
rows. Click OK to have InDesign create the basic table, which will be set as
wide as the text frame. The depth will be based on the number of rows, with
each row defaulting to the height that will hold 12-point text.
279
Chapter 18: Tricks with Text

With the basic table in place, you now format it using the Table pane and the
Table menu. The pane contains cell formatting tools: You can increase or
decrease the number of rows and columns, set the row and column height,
set the text’s vertical alignment within selected cells (top, middle, bottom,
and justified), choose one of four text-rotation angles, and set the text margin
within a cell separately for the top, bottom, left, and right. Note that all the
Table pane’s options affect only the currently selected cell(s), except for the
Number of Rows and Number of Columns fields. Figure 18-9 shows the Table
pane with its icons defined.
You set cell text’s horizontal alignment using the paragraph formatting con-
trols covered in Chapter 17. You can apply character formatting to cell text as
described in Chapters 16. You can also apply tabs within cells using the Tabs
pane covered earlier in this chapter.
To add items to a table, you can type text in any cell, paste text or graphics
into a cell, or place text or graphics into a cell by choosing File➪Place or
pressing Ô+D or Ctrl+D.
For more sophisticated table attributes, use the Table Options dialog box and
its five panes. These are expert features, so they’re not covered in this book.
Converting tabs to tables
Often, you’ll have a table done using tabs — whether imported from a word
processor or originally created in InDesign with tabs — that you want to

Part IV: Text Essentials 

convert to a real InDesign table. That’s easy. Select the tabbed text you want
to covert and choose Table➪Convert Text to Table.
In the Convert Text to Table dialog box, you can choose a Column Separator
(Tab, Comma, Paragraph, or a text string you type in the field) or a Row
Separator (same options). Although most textual data uses tabs to separate
columns and paragraphs to separate rows, you may encounter other data
that uses something else. For example, spreadsheets and databases often
save data so that commas separate columns rather than tabs. That’s why
InDesign lets you choose the separator characters before conversion.
During the conversion, InDesign formats the table using the standard set-
tings, using the current text formatting and the default cell insets and stroke
types. You can then adjust the table using the tools covered earlier in this
chapter. Note that the conversion treats all rows as body rows.
You can also convert a table to text by selecting multiple cells or an entire
table, as described earlier, and choosing Table➪Convert Table to Text.
InDesign presents the same options as it does in the Convert Text to Table
dialog box, so you can determine how the converted data appears.

T
hey say a picture is worth a thousand words. Well, a
lot of them are. Graphics make layouts come alive,
providing a visceral connection that text by itself just
cannot. So it should be no surprise that InDesign has tons
of features to work and even create graphics. This part
shows you how to work with imported graphics files,
cropping them and applying effects to them. You’ll also
learn how to draw your own shapes and edit them as you
refine your layout. And you’ll discover how to convert
text to graphics, giving you a whole new creative arrow in
your design quiver.

W
hat is a layout without pictures? Boring, that’s what. And that’s why
InDesign lets you import a wide variety of picture types, so you have a
lot of choices and flexibility in the images you use.
And through the Mac and Windows Clipboards (copy and paste), you can
import file formats — to a limited degree — that are not directly supported
by InDesign.
The terms picture and graphic are interchangeable, referring to any type of
graphic. An image is a bitmapped graphic, such as that produced by an image
editor, digital camera, or scanner, while an illustration or drawing is a vector
file produced by an illustration program.
Preparing Graphics Files
InDesign offers support for many major formats of graphics files. Some for-
mats are more appropriate than others for certain kinds of tasks. The basic
rules for creating your graphics files are as follows:
 Save line art (drawings) in a format such as EPS, PDF, Adobe Illustrator,
Windows Metafile (WMF), Enhanced Metafile (EMF), or PICT. (These
object-oriented formats are called vector formats. Vector files are com-
posed of instructions on how to draw various shapes.) InDesign works
best with EPS, PDF, and Illustrator files.

 Save bitmaps (photos and scans) in a format such as TIFF, Adobe
Photoshop, PNG, JPEG, PCX, Windows Bitmap (BMP), GIF, Scitex
Continuous Tone (SCT), or PICT. (These pixel-oriented formats are
called raster formats. Raster files are composed of a series of dots, or
pixels, that make up the image.) InDesign works best with TIFF and
Photoshop files.
Make EPS and TIFF formats your standards, because these have become the
standard graphics formats in publishing. If you and your service bureau are
working almost exclusively with Adobe software, you can add the PDF,
Illustrator, and Photoshop formats to this mix. (The Illustrator and PDF for-
mats are variants of EPS.) If you use transparency in your graphics, it’s best
to save them in Photoshop, Illustrator, or PDF formats, because other formats
(particularly EPS and TIFF) remove much of the transparency layering data
that will help an imagesetter optimally reproduce those transparent files.
The graphic file formats that InDesign imports include (the text in monofont
is the PC filename extension for the format):
 BMP: The native Windows bitmap format. .bmp, .dib
 EPS: The Encapsulated PostScript vector format favored by professional
publishers. .eps
 GIF: The Graphics Interchange Format common in Web documents. .gif
 JPEG: The Joint Photographic Experts Group compressed bitmap
format often used on the Web. .jpg
 Illustrator: The native format in Adobe Illustrator 5.5 through CS2. This
file format is similar to EPS. .ai
 PCX: The PC Paintbrush format that was very popular in DOS programs
and early version of Windows; it has now been largely supplanted by
other formats. .pcx, .rle
 PDF: The Portable Document Format that is a variant of EPS and is used
for Web-, network-, and CD-based documents. InDesign CS2 supports PDF
versions 1.3 through 1.6 (the formats used in Acrobat 4 through 7). .pdf
 Photoshop: The native format in Adobe Photoshop 5.0 through CS2. .psd
 PICT: Short for Picture, the Mac’s native graphics format until Mac OS X
(it can be bitmap or vector) that is little used in professional documents
and is becoming less common even for inexpensive clip art. .pct
 PNG: The Portable Network Graphics format that Adobe introduced sev-
eral years ago as a more capable alternative to GIF. .png
 QuickTime movie: For use in interactive documents, InDesign supports
this Apple-created, cross-platform format. .mov
286
Part V: Graphics Essentials 

 Scitex CT: The continuous-tone bitmap format used on Scitex prepress
systems. .ct
 TIFF: The Tagged Image File Format that is the bitmap standard for pro-
fessional image editors and publishers. .tif, .tiff
 Windows Metafile: The format native to Windows but little used in pro-
fessional documents. Since Office 2000, Microsoft applications create a
new version called Enhanced Metafile, also supported by InDesign.
.wmf, .emf
Spot colors (called spot inks in Photoshop) are imported into InDesign when
you place Photoshop, Illustrator, and PDF images into InDesign. They appear
in the Swatches pane, which is covered in Chapter 10.
Importing and Placing Pictures
It’s important to understand that when you import a graphic into a document,
InDesign establishes a link between the graphics file and the document file
and then sends the original graphics file to the printer when the document is
output.
InDesign links to graphics because a graphics file, particularly a high-resolution
scanned graphic, can be very large. If the entire graphics file is included in an
InDesign document when you import it, InDesign documents would quickly
become prohibitively large. Instead, InDesign saves a low-resolution preview
of an imported graphics file with the document, and it’s this file that you see
displayed on-screen. InDesign remembers the location of the original file and
uses this information when printing.
The Place command (File➪Place, or Ô+D or Ctrl+D) is the method you typi-
cally use to bring pictures into your InDesign layout. Here’s how to use the
Place command to import a graphic:
1. Choose File➪Place or press Ô+D or Ctrl+D.
If you want to import a graphic into an existing frame, select the target
frame using either of the selection tools (either before you choose
File➪Place or afterwards). If you want InDesign to create a new frame
when you import the graphic, make sure no object is selected when you
choose Place. Either way, the Place dialog box appears, as shown in
Figure 19-1.
You can import a graphic into any kind of frame or shape (including a
curved line created with the Pen tool) except a straight line. Be careful:
If the Type tool is selected when you use the Place command to import a
graphic into a selected text frame, you’ll create an inline graphic at the
text cursor’s location.
287
Chapter 19: Importing Pictures

2. Use the controls in the Place dialog box to locate and select the graph-
ics file you want to import.
If you want to display import options that let you control how the
selected graphics file is imported, either select Show Import Options,
and then click Open; or hold down the Shift key and double-click on the
filename or Shift+click Open. If you choose to Show Import Options, the
EPS Import Options, Place PDF, or Image Import Options dialog box,
depending on what kind of graphic you are importing, is displayed.
3. Specify the desired import options, if any are applicable, and then
click OK.
These options are covered later in this chapter.
4. You can place the graphic in an existing frame or in a new frame, as
follows:
• If an empty frame is selected, the graphic is automatically placed
in the frame. The upper-left corner of the graphic is placed in the
upper-left corner of the frame, and the frame acts as the cropping
shape for the graphic.
• If a frame already holding a graphic is selected, InDesign will
replace the existing graphic with the new one if you’ve selected the
Replace Selected Item check box in the Place dialog box.
Otherwise, InDesign will assume you want to put the new graphic
in a new frame.
• To place the graphic into a new frame, click the loaded-graphic
icon on an empty portion of a page or on the pasteboard.  The
point where you click establishes the upper-left corner of the
resulting graphics frame, which is the same size as the imported
graphic and which acts as the graphic’s cropping shape.
Figure 19-1:
The Place
dialog box.

Part V: Graphics Essentials 

• To place the graphic in an existing, unselected frame, click in the
frame with the loaded-graphic icon. The upper-left corner of the
graphic is placed in the upper-left corner of the frame, and the
frame acts as a cropping shape.
After you place a graphic, it’s displayed in the frame that contains it, and the
frame is selected. If the Selection tool is selected, the eight handles of its
bounding box are displayed; if the Direct Selection tool is selected, handles
are displayed only in the corners. At this point, you can modify either the
frame or the graphic within, or you can move on to another task.
When importing JPEG files, InDesign CS2 now automatically scales the image
to fit in the page. This feature helps deal with digital-camera graphics that
tend to be very large in dimension, so when imported end up taking much
more than the width of a page. While you’ll likely still need to scale the image
to fit your layout, you can at least see the whole image before doing so.
Specifying Import Options
If you’ve ever used a graphics application — for example, an image-editing
program like Adobe Photoshop or an illustration program like Adobe
Illustrator or Macromedia FreeHand — you’re probably aware that when you
save a graphics file, you have several options that control such things as file
format, image size, color depth, preview quality, and so on. When you save 
a graphics file, the settings you specify are determined by the way in which
the image will be used. For example, you could use Photoshop to save a high-
resolution TIFF version of a scanned graphic for use in a slick, four-color
annual report or a low-resolution GIF version of the same graphic for use on
the company’s Web page. Or you could use Illustrator or FreeHand to create 
a corporate logo that you’ll use in various sizes in many of your printed 
publications.
If you choose to specify custom import settings when you import a graphics
file, the choices you make will depend on the nature of the publication. For
example, if it’s bound for the Web, there’s no need to work with or save
graphics using resolutions that exceed a computer monitor’s 72-dpi resolu-
tion. Along the same lines, if the publication will be printed, the image import
settings you specify for a newspaper that will be printed on newsprint on a
SWOP (Specification for Web-Offset Printing) press will be different than
those you specify for a four-color magazine printed on coated paper using a
sheet-fed press.
If you select Show Import Options when you place a graphic, the options dis-
played in the resulting dialog boxes depend on the file format of the selected
289
Chapter 19: Importing Pictures

graphic. When you set options for a particular file, the options you specify
remain in effect for that file format until you change them. If you don’t select
the Show Import Options check box when you place a graphic, the most
recent settings for the file format of the selected graphic are used.
Import options for bitmap graphics
InDesign gives you two sets of import options for the following types of
bitmap images: TIFF, GIF, JPEG, Scitex CT, BMP, and PCX. You get three
options for PNG files, and a different set of three for Photoshop files. No
import options are available for PICT or QuickTime movie files. Figure 19-2
shows three of the four possible panes for bitmap images: The Image and
Color panes are for most bitmap formats; PNG files have a third pane, PNG
Settings, and Photoshop files also have a third pane, Layers, covered later in
this chapter.
The Image pane lets you apply any embedded clipping path and/or alpha
channel to the image in order to mask, or cut out, part of the image. Check
the Apply Photoshop Clipping Path option to import the clipping path along
with the image; select an alpha channel from the Alpha Channel pop-up menu
to import the alpha channel along with the image. (Chapter 20 covers clip-
ping paths in more detail.)
Color pane
In the Color pane, you can turn on color management for the image and con-
trol how the image is displayed. Check the Enable Color Management option
to enable color management.
Using the Profile pop-up menu, choose a color-source profile that matches
the device (scanner, digital camera, and so on) or software used to create the
file. InDesign will try to translate the colors in the file to the colors that the
output device is capable of producing. (These profiles are installed in your
operating system by other applications, not by InDesign.)
Use the Rendering Intent pop-up menu to determine how InDesign translates
the color in the selected graphics file with the gamut of the output device. If
the graphic is a scanned photograph, choose Perceptual (Images). The other
options — Saturation (Graphics), Relative Colorimetric, and Absolute
Colorimetric — are appropriate for images that contain mostly areas of solid
color, such as Illustrator EPS files that have been opened in Photoshop and
saved as TIFFs.
PNG Settings pane
Use the PNG Settings pane — available only if you place a PNG file — to use
the transparency information in a PNG file, assuming it has a transparent
290
Part V: Graphics Essentials 

background. You have two choices for controlling transparency handling:
White Background and File-Defined Background. The former forces the trans-
parent portion to display as white in InDesign; the latter uses whatever back-
ground color is specified in the PNG file itself.
Figure 19-2:
The Image,
Color, and
PNG
Settings
panes in the

Import
Options
dialog box.
291
Chapter 19: Importing Pictures

This pane also lets you adjust the gamma value during import — the gamma
is a setting that describes the color temperature of a device, and to ensure
most accurate reproduction, you’d want the gamma setting for the PNG file to
be the same as that of your output device (a printer or monitor). It is meant
to correct for the file being created on a specific type of monitor. However, to
use this feature, you need to know the gamma setting for the final output
device. If you don’t, leave it alone.
Import options for vector file formats
If you’re importing vector files, selecting the Import Options check box will
result in one of two dialog boxes appearing, depending on what the vector
file type is. If you import older-version Illustrator or EPS files, you’ll get the
EPS Import Options dialog box; if you import PDF and newer-version
Illustrator files, you’ll get the Place PDF dialog box, which has two panes.
(Both dialog boxes are shown in Figure 19-3.) No import options are available
for Windows Metafile or Enhanced Metafile graphics.
Illustrator CS and CS2 use PDF as their native file format, even though the file-
name extension is .ai, so InDesign detects these files as PDF files and pro-
vides the PDF options during import. In earlier versions of Illustrator, the
native format was actually a variant of EPS.
Figure 19-3:
The EPS
Import
Options and
Place PDF
dialog
boxes.
292
Part V: Graphics Essentials 

EPS Import Options dialog box
Use this dialog box to import any clipping paths embedded in images that are
in the EPS file. Check the Apply Photoshop Clipping Path option to enable
this option.
Also, use this pane to control how the EPS file appears on-screen in InDesign.
If you select the Use TIFF or PICT Preview option, InDesign will use the low-
resolution proxy image embedded in the EPS file for display on-screen and
print the graphic using the embedded high-resolution PostScript instructions.
If you select the Rasterize the PostScript option, InDesign will convert the
PostScript file into a bitmap image during import. There’s rarely a reason to
rasterize an imported EPS file — it just takes up some of your valuable time.
Place PDF dialog box
When you use the Place command to import a PDF file and you select the
Show Import Options check box, the Place PDF file dialog box, shown in
Figure 19-4, is displayed. It provides several controls for specifying how the
file is imported. The General pane provides the following options:
 In the Pages section, select Previewed Page, All, or Range to determine
which page(s) you want to import. You can change the previewed page
by using the arrow buttons under the preview image at left or entering a
specific page number in the field below the preview image. If you want to
import a range, use commas to separate pages and a hyphen to indicate
range; for example, 3, 5-9, 13 will import pages 3, 5 through 9, and 13.
When you place the PDF in InDesign, you’ll get a separate loaded-graphic
icon for each page, so as you place each page, a new loaded-graphic icon
will appear for the next page, until there are no more to place. You can
tell you’re placing multiple pages because the loaded-graphics icon will
have a plus sign in it.
 In the Options section, select one of the cropping options from the Crop
To pop-up menu. If you choose Content, the page’s bounding box or a
rectangle that encloses all items, including page marks, is used to build
the graphics frame. Choosing Art places the area defined by the file’s
creator, if any, as placeable artwork. For example, the person who cre-
ated the file might have designated a particular graphic as placeable art-
work. Choosing Crop places the area displayed and printed by Adobe
Acrobat. Choosing Trim places the graphic in an area equal to the final,
trimmed piece. Choosing Bleed places the page area plus any specified
bleed area. Choosing Media places an area defined by the paper size
specified for the PDF document, including page marks.
 Also in the Options section, select the Transparent Background check
box if you want the white areas of the PDF page to be transparent.
Uncheck this option if you want to preserve the page’s opaque white
background.
293
Chapter 19: Importing Pictures

The ability to import multiple pages from a PDF file is new to InDesign CS2.
Working with image layers
InDesign CS2 now lets you work with individual layers in some imported
graphics. What that means is that you have more control over what displays
because you can turn on or off individual layers. Of course, to use this capa-
bility, the source graphic must be constructed with multiple layers.
Use the Layers pane in the Image Import Options dialog box or the Place PDF
dialog box to select which layer(s) you want visible in InDesign. (The Layers
pane is available only if you place an Illustrator, PDF, or Photoshop graphic.)
You will see a list of image layers. Any that have the Eye icon will display in
InDesign, and you can select or deselect layers by clicking the box to the
right of the layer name to make the Eye icon appear or disappear. (You cannot
change their order — you’d need to go back to Photoshop or Illustrator and
change the layer order there.) Figure 19-4 shows the Layers pane.
Although you can save an image file in the TIFF format and preserve any
layers, InDesign CS2 does not give you the ability to manage which layers you
import from a TIFF file into InDesign.
There’s also an option, in the When Updating Link pop-up menu, to control
how changes to the file are handled in terms of layer management: If you
choose Use Photoshop’s Layer Visibility or Use Illustrator’s Layer Visibility,
InDesign will make all layers that are visible in Photoshop or Illustrator visi-
ble when you update the link to the graphic from InDesign. If you choose
Figure 19-4:
The Layers
pane of the
EPS Import
Options and
Place PDF
dialog
boxes.
294
Part V: Graphics Essentials 

Keep Layer Visibility Overrides in the When Updating Link pop-up menu,
InDesign will import only the layers chosen in this dialog box if you later
update the graphic in Photoshop or Illustrator.
Using Other Ways to Import Graphics
If you want to specify custom import options for an imported graphics file,
you must use the Place command. However, if you don’t need this level of
control, InDesign offers three other options for importing graphics:
 You can use your computer’s Copy (File➪Copy, or Ô+C or Ctrl+C) and
Paste (File➪Paste, or Ô+V or Ctrl+V) commands to move a graphics file
between two InDesign documents or from a document created with
another program into an InDesign document. If you copy an object in an
InDesign document and then paste it into a different InDesign document,
the copy retains all the attributes of the original, as well as the link to the
original graphics file. Otherwise, a link between the original graphics file
and the InDesign document is not established; the graphic becomes part
of the InDesign document, as though you created it using InDesign tools.
 You can drag and drop graphics file icons from your computer’s desktop
into InDesign documents. A link between the original graphics file and
the document is established, just as it would be if you had used the
Place command.
 For Illustrator files, you can drag objects directly from Illustrator into
InDesign. Each object becomes a separate, editable InDesign object, as
though you had created it in InDesign. (And no links are established to
the source file.)
If you use these methods to add a graphic to an InDesign document, some of
the attributes of the original graphic may not survive the trip. The operating
system, the file format, and the capabilities of the originating application all
play roles in determining which attributes are preserved. If you want to be
safe, use the Place command.
Managing Links and Versions
The Links pane (Window➪Links, or Shift+Ô+D or Ctrl+Shift+D) is a handy
place to manage the links to your graphics, particularly when you need to
update them. (Figure 19-5 shows the Links pane.) The first eight commands in
the Links pane’s palette menu let you reestablish links to missing and modi-
fied graphics files, display an imported graphic in the document window,
open the program used to create a graphic file, and work on copies and ver-
sions of the source graphics:
295
Chapter 19: Importing Pictures

 Relink: This command, and the Relink button (the leftmost at the bottom
of the pane), lets you reestablish a missing link or replace the original file
you imported with a different file. When you choose Relink or click the
button, the Relink dialog box is displayed and shows the original path
name and filename. You can enter a new path name and filename in the
Location field, but it’s easier to click Browse, which opens a standard
Open a File dialog box. Use the controls to locate and select the original
file or a different file, and then click OK. (You can also drag and drop a file
icon from the Mac OS Finder or Windows Explorer directly into the Relink
dialog box.) If you want to restore broken links to multiple files, highlight
their filenames in the scroll list, and then choose Relink or click the
Update Link button.
 Go To Link: Choose this option, or click the Go to Link button (second
from left) to display the highlighted graphics file in the document
window. InDesign will, if necessary, navigate to the correct page and
center the image in the document window. You can also display a partic-
ular graphic by double-clicking its name in the scroll list while holding
down the Option or Alt key.
 Edit Original: If you want to modify an imported graphic, choose Edit
Original from the palette menu or click the Edit Original button (far
right). InDesign will try to locate and open the program used to create
the file. This may or may not be possible, depending on the original pro-
gram, the file format, and the programs available on your computer.
 Update Link: Choose this option or click the Update Link button (third
from the left) to update the link to a modified graphic. Highlight multiple
filenames, and then choose Update Link or click the Update Link button
to update all links at once.
Figure 19-5:
The Links
pane.
296
Part V: Graphics Essentials 

To update multiple links at once, select all the links you want to modify
in the Links pane (Shift+click to select a range; Ô+click or Ctrl+click to
select noncontiguous files), and then choose Update Link from the
palette menu.
When you update missing and modified graphics, any transformations —
rotation, shear, scale, and so on — that you’ve applied to the graphics or
their frames are maintained.
 Copy Link To: Choose this option to copy the source graphic to a new
location and update the link so that it refers to this new copy.
The Copy Link To, Versions, and Alternates menu options are new to
InDesign CS2. (The Versions and Alternates options are expert Version
Cue features and thus not covered in this book.)
 Purchase This Image: It lets you buy images for which you have down-
loaded or otherwise acquired a trial version from the new Adobe Stock
Photos service, which offers stock images from Comstock Images,
DigitalVision, and Getty Images. Such trial images are typically low-
resolution or have a watermark overlaying the image; when you buy
usage rights to the image, you get the full version. You are free of course
to purchase images from any provider of online or CD image libraries 
for your documents.
 Reveal in Finder (Macintosh) and Reveal in Explorer (Windows): This
menu option will open a window displaying the contents of the folder
that contains the source file, so you can perhaps move, copy, or rename
it. (The Reveal in Bridge option is a similar feature for the expert Version
Cue capability not covered in this book.)
 Embed: This option lets you embed the complete file of any imported
graphic. (InDesign normally imports only a low-resolution screen pre-
view when you place a graphic that is 48K or larger.) If you want to
ensure that the graphics file will forever remain with a document, you
can choose to embed it — however, by embedding graphics, you’ll be
producing larger document files, which means it will take you longer to
open and save them. To embed a graphic, click on its name in the scroll
list, and then choose Embed from the Links pane’s palette menu. An
alert is displayed and informs you about the increased document size
that will result. Click Yes to embed the file.
 Link Information: This option displays the Link Information dialog box,
which actually doesn’t let you do much. (The Previous and Next buttons
let you display information about the previous and next files in the list,
but that’s about it.) But it does display 11 sometimes-useful bits of infor-
mation about the highlighted graphics file, including its name, status,
creation date, file type, and location.
297
Chapter 19: Importing Pictures

 Sort by Status: This option lists files with missing links first, followed by
files that have been modified, and finally files whose status is okay.
 Sort by Name: This option lists all files in alphabetical order.
 Sort by Page: This option lists imported files on page 1 first, followed by
imported files on page 2, and so on.
 Small Palette Rows: This option lets you reduce the size of text in the
pane and decrease the space between entries so that you can see more
entries at once. Of course, the reduced rows are also harder to read. To
go back to the normal display size, simply select this option again.

 Using the Scissors tool
A
fter you import a graphic into an InDesign document, you can modify
either the graphic or the frame that contains it. The most common
actions you’ll take are cropping and resizing. Cropping is a fancy term for
deciding what part of the picture to show. Resizing is, of course, making the
picture bigger or smaller. But you’ll also apply other effects — at least some
of the time — such as rotating, shearing, flipping, and colorizing. And if you
want to get really fancy, you might work with clipping paths to create
“masks” around picture portions or even cut the graphic into pieces.
In almost every case, you select graphics with the Direct Selection tool to
apply effects to the graphic, rather to the frame. If you use the Selection tool,
the work you do will apply to the frame, as Chapter 12 explains.
Cropping and Resizing
Remember, when you import a graphic using the Place command (File➪Place,
or Ô+D or Ctrl+D) or by dragging a graphics file into a document window,
that the graphic is contained in a graphics frame — either the frame that was
selected when you placed the graphic or the frame that was automatically
created if a frame wasn’t selected. The upper-left corner of an imported
graphic is automatically placed in the upper-left corner of its frame.

Cropping graphics
The easiest way to crop a graphic is to resize the frame that contains it. To
resize the frame, go to Chapter 12. Note that resizing the frame does not
resize the graphic.
You can also click on a graphic with the Direct Selection tool, and then drag
the graphic within its frame to reveal and conceal different parts of the
graphic. For example, you could crop the top and left edges of a graphic by
dragging the graphic above and to the left of its original position (in the
upper-left corner of the frame).
Of course, you could accomplish the same thing by selecting the frame with
the Selection tool and dragging the upper-left corner down and to the right.
The advantage of moving the image within the frame is that you don’t have to
move the frame from its desired position in the layout.
You can also use the Control palette (Window➪Control, or Option+Ô+6 or
Ctrl+Alt+6), shown in Figure 20-1, to crop a graphic. (You can also use the
Transform pane [Window➪Object & Layout➪Transform or F9], also shown in
Figure 20-1.) Select the graphic with the Direct Selection tool and crop it by
changing the values in the X+ and/or Y+ fields.
If you want to mask out (hide) portions of an imported graphic, you have the
option of using an irregular shape as the frame, a graphic’s built-in clipping
path (if it has one), or a clipping path you generated in InDesign (by choosing
Object➪Clipping Path or pressing Option+Shift+Ô+K or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+K).
Clipping paths are covered later in this chapter.
Resizing graphics
To resize a graphic, be sure to choose the Direct Selection tool, then enter
new Scale X and Scale Y Percentage values in the Control palette or
Transform pane.
If you select the graphic with the Selection tool, you are actually changing the
frame’s size, while if you select the graphic with the Direct Selection tool, you
are actually changing the graphic’s size. What’s more confusing is that if you
choose a graphic whose frame size is 0 points, resizing it with the Selection
tool actually resizes the graphic — but the Control palette and Transform
pane show you a new size of 100% if the Selection tool is active and an accu-
rate new size if you then switch to the Direct Selection tool. So always use the
Direct Selection tool to resize.
If you make a graphic larger by resizing it using the Direct Selection tool, the
frame dimensions don’t change, which thus causes you to crop out part of
the graphic.
300
Part V: Graphic Essentials 

You can enter size values between 1% and 10,000%. If you want to maintain a
graphic’s original proportions, make sure the values in the Horizontal Scale
and Vertical Scale fields are the same. If you want to return a graphic to the
size it was when you first imported it, specify Horizontal Scale and Vertical
Scale values of 100%.

Chapter 20: Special Effects with Graphics

You can use math when scaling. For example, if you want the scale to be 30
percent larger, you could enter +30% rather than 130%. Or you could enter 
/6 to make the object one-sixth of its current size. Other legitimate actions
include subtraction (for example, enter –29%) and multiplication (for exam-
ple, type *7).
In addition to specifying a value in the Horizontal Scale or Vertical Scale
field, you can choose one of the predefined values from the fields’ pop-up
menus, or you can highlight a value and press the up or down arrow keys on
the keyboard. Each press of an arrow key changes the value by 1 percent. If
you hold down the Shift key while clicking an arrow, the increment of change
is 10 percent.
Figuring out the fitting commands
If you’ve placed a graphic in a frame that’s either larger or smaller than the
graphic, you can use the Fitting options (available by choosing Object➪Fitting
or by using the appropriate buttons in the Control palette) to scale the graphic
to fit the frame proportionately or disproportionately or to scale the frame to
fit the graphic. Another option lets you center the graphic in the frame. These
are very handy, and a lot easier than trying to resize a graphic to fit using the
mouse or the Control palette or Transform pane.
Keep in mind that the fitting commands for graphics are available only if
you’ve used the Selection tool to select a graphic’s frame. Here’s a descrip-
tion of each of the five options:
 Fit Content to Frame: To resize a graphic to fill the selected frame,
choose Object➪Fitting➪Fit Content to Frame or press Option+Ô+E or
Ctrl+Alt+E. If the frame is larger than the graphic, the graphic is enlarged;
if the frame is smaller, the graphic is reduced. If the graphic and the
frame have different proportions, the graphic’s proportions are changed
so that the image completely fills the frame.
 Fit Frame to Content: To resize a frame so that it wraps snugly around a
graphic, choose Fit Frame to Content or press Option+Ô+C or Ctrl+Alt+C.
The frame will be enlarged or reduced depending on the size of the
graphic, and the frame’s proportions will be changed to match the pro-
portions of the graphic.
 Center Content: To center a graphic in its frame, choose Center Content
or press Shift+Ô+E or Ctrl+Shift+E. Neither the frame nor the graphic are
resized when you center a graphic.
 Fit Content Proportionally: To resize a graphic to fit in the selected
frame while maintaining the graphic’s current proportions, choose
Object➪Fitting➪Fit Content Proportionally or press Option+Shift+Ô+E
or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+E. If the frame is larger than the graphic, the graphic is
302
Part V: Graphic Essentials 

enlarged; if the frame is smaller, the graphic is reduced. If the graphic
and the frame have different proportions, a portion of the frame back-
ground will show above and below or to the left and right of the graphic.
If you want, you can drag frame edges to make the frame shorter or nar-
rower and eliminate any portions of the background that are visible.
 Fill Frame Proportionally: To resize a frame to fit the selected graphic,
choose Object➪Fitting➪Fill Frame Proportionally or press Option+Shift+
Ô+C or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+C. This guarantees that there will be no space
between the graphic and the frame. (The Fit Frame to Content option
can result in such space at the bottom and/or right sides of a graphic.)
The Fill Frame Proportionally option is new to InDesign CS2.
For frames with strokes, the Fitting options align the outer edge of a graphic
with the center of the stroke. A stroke will obscure a strip along the graphic’s
edge that’s half the width of the stroke. The wider the stroke, the more of the
graphic that gets covered up.
Rotating, Shearing, and Flipping
Rotating, shearing, or flipping a graphic within its frame — leaving the frame
unaffected — is essentially the same process as rotating or shearing an
object (see Chapter 12). The key differences are:
 You need to use the Control palette or Transform pane to work on the
contents (graphic or text), rather than on its frame. The Rotation, Shear,
and Free Transform tools (described in Chapter 12) work on the frames
and the content simultaneously.
 You need to select the frame with the Direct Selection tool — not the
Selection tool — to ensure that the effects are applied to the contents,
rather than to the frame itself.
Coloring Bitmapped Graphics
When it comes to performing graphic modifications in InDesign, the only dif-
ference between bitmap graphics and vector-based graphics is that you can
apply color and, optionally, tint to grayscale and black-and-white bitmapped
images, such as those in the TIFF and Photoshop formats. These options are
not available for vector-based images and color bitmapped images. To apply
color to an image, follow these steps:
1. Click the Direct Selection tool.
2. Click in the graphic’s frame to select the graphic.
303
Chapter 20: Special Effects with Graphics

3. Make sure that the Fill button is active in the Tools palette to color the
image’s background.
4. If it’s not displayed, show the Swatches pane by choosing Windows➪
Swatches or pressing F5.
5. Click a color in the Swatches pane’s scroll list, or drag a swatch from
the pane onto the graphic.
Applying a color tint — that is, a shade or a percentage of the applied color —
to a graphic is the same process as applying a color swatch. There’s just one
additional step: Enter a value in the Tint field in the Swatches pane. You can
also use a tint swatch instead, ensuring the same tint is applied to multiple
objects (see Chapter 10 for information about defining colors and tints).
Working with Graphics 
in Irregular Shapes
While most graphics you use will be placed in rectangular frames, InDesign
does give you other choices:
 You can select any type of frame — oval or polygonal, not just 
rectangular — to place or copy your graphic into.
 You can draw your own shape using the Pencil or Pen tool and then
place or copy your graphic into it. When you create the free-form shape,
make sure that the default color for the Pen tool is set to None so that
the shape you create is transparent. Otherwise, the colored area in the
shape will obscure the graphic behind it.
The Pen tool lets you create one shape at a time. The Compound Paths
command lets you combine multiple shapes to create more complex
objects. For example, you can place a small circle on top of a larger circle,
and then use the Compound Paths command to create a doughnut-
shaped object. (See Chapter 21 for more information about creating
complex shapes with the Compound Paths command.)
If you copy the graphic into a frame or shape, you must use the Paste
Into command (Edit➪Paste Into, or Option+Ô+V or Ctrl+Alt+V) to place
the copied graphic inside the selected shape, rather than on top of it.
 You can use a clipping path that was defined in the graphic itself when it
was created or a clipping path that was created in InDesign.
So what is a clipping path, anyway? A clipping path is used to mask certain
parts of a graphic and reveal other parts; it’s basically an invisible outline
placed in the graphic that InDesign can then work with. For example, if you
want to create a silhouette around a single person in a crowd, open the file in
304
Part V: Graphic Essentials 

an image-editing program such as Photoshop, and then create and save a
clipping path that isolates the shape of the person. (You can also erase every-
thing except the person you want to silhouette; not only can this be time-
consuming, but if you want to reveal other parts of the graphic later, you’re
out of luck.) TIFF, Photoshop EPS, and Photoshop-native (.PSD) files can have
embedded clipping paths.
Regardless of the method you use to clip an imported graphic, you can
modify a clipping path by moving, adding, deleting, and changing the direc-
tion of anchor points and by moving direction lines.
You can convert a clipping path — whether imported or created in InDesign —
to a frame by choosing Convert Clipping Path to Frame for a selected object
using the contextual menu (right-click or Control+click the object).
See Chapter 21 for more information about modifying free-form shapes. See
the Photoshop For Dummies series (Wiley Publishing) for more on creating
clipping paths in Photoshop.
Using a graphic’s own clipping path
In an ideal world, any graphics that you want to have fit in an irregular shape
will come with their own clipping paths. In that wonderful situation, you
would first be sure to import the clipping path when you place the graphic
and then use InDesign’s Text Wrap pane to access that clipping path.
The steps are easy:
1. Be sure to select the Show Import Options check box in the Place
dialog box (File➪Place, or Ô+D or Ctrl+D) when you import the image
and select the Apply Photoshop Clipping Path option in the Image
Import Options dialog box (as described in Chapter 19).
2. Open the Text Wrap pane (Window➪Text Wrap, or Option+Ô+W or
Ctrl+Alt+W), as shown in Figure 20-2.
3. Select the graphic.
4. Click the Wrap Around Object Shape button (the third one from the
left) at the top of the Text Wrap pane.
5. If you want, adjust the space between the surrounding text and the
obstructing shape by typing values in the Top Offset field.
6. Now select the clipping source from the Type pop-up menu in the
Contour Options section of the Text Wrap pane. Choose from two rele-
vant options:
• Alpha Channel uses the image’s alpha channel, if any, to create a
wrapping boundary. (An alpha channel is another type of clipping
305
Chapter 20: Special Effects with Graphics

path and is also created in the source program such as
Photoshop.)
• Photoshop Path uses the image’s clipping path, if any, to create a
wrapping boundary. Use the Path pop-up menu to select which
path to use, if your image has more than one embedded clipping
path.
See Chapter 18 for the basics of text wraps.
Creating a clipping path in InDesign
If you import a graphic that doesn’t have a clipping path, you have two sets
of options to create a clipping path.
The easiest is to use the Text Wrap pane as described in the previous section
but to instead choose one of the following options from the Type pop-up
menu:
 Detect Edges tries to determine the graphic’s outside boundary by
ignoring white space — you would use this for bitmapped images that
have a transparent or white background.
 Same as Clipping uses the clipping path for the graphic created in
InDesign — you would use this when the desired clipping path can’t be
created through the Detect Edges option. (We cover this method of 
clipping-path creation shortly.)
You can further modify the clipping path by selecting the graphic with the
Direct Selection tool. The text-wrap boundary appears as a blue line — you
can make the boundary easier to select by setting offsets in the Text Wrap
pane, which moves the boundary away from the frame edge. Now use
InDesign’s free-form editing tools, as covered in Chapter 21, to edit the text-
wrap boundary.
A slightly more difficult way to create a clipping path — but one that gives you
more control — is to use the Clipping Path command (Object➪Clipping Path,
or Option+Shift+Ô+K or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+K) to generate one automatically:
Figure 20-2:
The Text
Wrap pane
and its Type
menu.
306
Part V: Graphic Essentials 

1. Select the graphic to which you want to add a clipping path.
It’s best to use the Direct Selection tool, so that you can see the clipping
path within the frame as you work.
2. Choose Object➪Clipping Path, or press Option+Shift+Ô+K or
Ctrl+Alt+Shift+K.
The Clipping Path dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 20-3.
3. To have InDesign detect the likely boundary of the image, as opposed
to a white or other light background, choose Detect Edges from the
Type pop-up menu.
You can use the other options to select Alpha Channel or Photoshop
Path as the clipping path for graphics that have one or more of these.
(InDesign can only use one alpha channel or Photoshop path as the clip-
ping path, so use the Path pop-up menu to choose the one you want.)
4. Type a value in the Threshold field or click and drag the field’s slider
to specify the value below which pixels will be placed outside the clip-
ping path shape (that is, pixels that will become transparent).
Pixels darker than the Threshold value remain visible and thus are
inside the clipping path shape. The lowest possible Threshold value (0)
makes only white pixels transparent. As the value gets higher, less of the
graphic remains visible. The lightest areas are removed first, then mid-
tones, and so on. (Select the Preview option to see the results of your
changes without closing the dialog box.)
5. Type a value in the Tolerance field.
This value determines how closely InDesign looks at variations in adja-
cent pixels when building a clipping path. Higher values produce a sim-
pler, smoother path than lower values. Lower values create a more
complicated, more exact path with more anchor points.
6. If you want to enlarge or reduce the size of the clipping path pro-
duced by the Threshold and Tolerance values, type a value in the
Inset Frame field.
Negative values enlarge the path; positive values shrink it. (The Inset
Frame value is also applied to the path’s bounding box.)
7. Select the Invert option to switch the transparent and visible areas of
the clipping path produced by the Threshold and Tolerance values.
8. If you want to include light areas in the perimeter shape InDesign gen-
erates based on the Threshold and Tolerance values, select the
Include Inside Edges option.
For example, if you have a graphic of a doughnut and you want to make
the hole transparent (as well as the area around the outside of the
doughnut), click Include Inside Edges. If you don’t click Include Inside
Edges, InDesign builds a single shape (in the case of a doughnut, just the
307
Chapter 20: Special Effects with Graphics

outside circle). The portion of the graphic in the shape remains visible;
the rest of the graphic becomes transparent.
9. Select the Restrict to Frame option if you want InDesign to generate a
clipping path from just the portion of the graphic visible in the
graphic frame, as opposed to the entire graphic (such as if you
cropped the graphic).
10. Select the Use High Resolution Image option if you want InDesign to
use the high-resolution information in the original file instead of using
the low-resolution proxy image.
Even though using the high-resolution image takes longer, the resulting
clipping path is more precise than it would be if you didn’t check Use
High Resolution Image.
11. When you’ve finished specifying clipping path settings, click OK to
close the dialog box and apply the settings to the selected graphic.
If you use the Clipping Path command to generate a clipping path for a
graphic that has a built-in clipping path, the one that InDesign generates
replaces the built-in path.
Figure 20-4 shows a graphic before and after a clipping path was applied to it
using the Clipping Path command. At left is a graphic of coastal France with a
graphic of a glider superimposed. At right is the same set of graphics, but
with a clipping path applied to the glider so the outside area is masked out,
making it transparent.
Figure 20-3:

Path dialog
box.
308
Part V: Graphic Essentials 

The Clipping Path command works very well for images that have a white or
light background but no clipping path. It’s less useful for graphics with back-
grounds that contain a broad range of intermingling values.
You can remove a clipping path by choosing None as the Type in the Clipping
Path dialog box. You can also select a different path — Detect Edges, Alpha
Channel, Photoshop Path, or User-Modified Path — than was selected previ-
ously if you decide to change the current clipping path.
Slicing Up Graphics
Not that Freddy Krueger is a role model, but sometimes slicing things up is
part of a good layout. InDesign’s Scissors tool lets you slice objects into
parts. Figure 20-5 shows a graphic that’s been cut into halves with the
Scissors tool. To slice a graphic, follow these steps:
1. Select the Scissors tool.
2. Position the cross-hair pointer anywhere over a graphics frame, and
then click.
3. Move the pointer to a different position along the frame edge, and
then click again.

imposed

and after

Chapter 20: Special Effects with Graphics

4. After you’ve clicked twice on the frame edge, you can switch to either
of the selection tools and then click and drag either of the two graphic
pieces that your scissors cut created.
That’s it!
If you use the Scissors tool to split a frame to which a stroke has been applied,
the resulting edges will not include the stroke.

nDesign’s basic drawing tools let you create basic shapes, such as straight
lines, rectangles and squares, circles and ellipses, and equilateral poly-
gons. But what about when you need to create shapes that aren’t so basic,
such as an amoeba or a cursive version of your first name? That’s where
InDesign’s Pen and Pencil tools come in.
In this chapter, you’ll find out how to use these tools to create any kind of
line or closed shape, called paths. And you’ll learn how anything you create
with these tools can be used as an independent graphic element or as a
frame for text or a picture.
Finding Out about Paths
But before we get into how to create paths, it’s important that you under-
stand some of the theory behind paths, which will help you create and
manipulate them more easily.
Every object you create with InDesign’s object-creation tools is a path.
Regardless of the tool you use to create a path, you can change its appear-
ance by modifying any of four properties that all paths share:
 Closure: A path is either open or closed. Straight lines created with the
Line tool and curved and zigzag lines created with the Pen tool are exam-
ples of open paths. Basic shapes created with the Ellipse, Rectangle, and
Polygon tools and free-form shapes created with the Pen and Pencil tools
are examples of closed shapes. A closed free-form shape is an uninter-
rupted path with no endpoints.

 Stroke: If you want to make a path visible, you can apply a stroke to it
by selecting it with a selection tool, entering a Weight value in the
Stroke pane (Window➪Stroke or F10), and selecting a color from the
Swatches pane (Window➪Swatches or F5). (An unselected, unstroked
path is not visible.) Be sure that the Stroke button is active in the Tools
palette or Swatches palette by clicking the Stroke button in either loca-
tion before applying the color, as described in Chapter 12.
 Fill: A color, color tint, or gradient applied to the background of a path is
called a fill. You apply fills by using the Swatches pane. 
 Contents: You can place a text file or a graphics file in any path except a
straight line. When a path is used to hold text or a picture, the path func-
tions as a frame. Although InDesign can place text in an open path, plac-
ing text and pictures in closed paths is far more common than placing
them in open paths.
No matter how simple or complicated, all paths are made up of the same
components. Figure 21-1 shows the parts that make up a path:
 A path contains one or more straight or curved segments.
 An anchor point is located at each end of every segment. The anchor
points at the ends of a closed path are called endpoints. When you create
a path of any kind, anchor points are automatically placed at the end of
each segment. After you create a path, you can move, add, delete, and
change the direction of corner points.
 InDesign has two kinds of anchor points: smooth points and corner
points. A smooth point connects two adjoining curved segments in a
continuous, flowing curve. At a corner point, adjoining segments —
straight or curved — meet at an angle. The corners of a rectangular path
are the most common corner points.
 A direction line runs through each anchor point and has a handle at both
ends. You can control the curve that passes through an anchor point by
dragging a direction line’s handles, as we explain a little later on.

Drawing Your Own Shapes
Even if you’re an artistic master with a piece of charcoal or a Number 2
pencil, you need to practice with the Pen tool for awhile before your drawing
skills kick in. The good news is that once you get comfortable using the Pen
tool, you can draw any shape you can imagine. (Of course, if you can’t draw
very well in the first place, using the Pen tool won’t magically transform you
into a master illustrator!) If this is new terrain for you, start simply and pro-
ceed slowly.
When creating paths, use as few anchor points as possible. As you become
more comfortable creating free-form paths, you should find yourself using
fewer anchor points to create paths.
For an easy way to draw free-form shapes, use the Pencil tool. This tool
simply traces the movement of your mouse (or pen tablet) as you move it,
much like a pencil works on paper. Although not as exact as the Pen tool, the
Pencil tool creates Bézier curves that you can later edit. Note that the Pencil
tool is not meant for creating straight lines — unless you are capable of draw-
ing perfectly straight lines by hand, that is.
Straight and zigzag lines
Follow these steps to draw lines with straight segments, such as a zigzag:
1. Select the Pen tool.
2. Move the Pen pointer to where you want to start your line segment.
3. Click and release the mouse button. (Make sure you don’t drag before
you release the mouse button.)
An anchor point will appear; it looks like a small, filled-in square.
4. Move the Pen pointer to where you want to place the next anchor
point.
5. Click and release the mouse button.
InDesign draws a straight line between the two anchor points. The first
anchor point changes to a hollow square, and the second anchor point
is filled in, which indicates that it is the active anchor point.
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 for each additional anchor point.
To reposition an anchor point after you click the mouse button but
before you release it, hold down the spacebar and drag. Otherwise, you
need to select it with the Direct Selection tool after you finish drawing
the line and then click and drag it to its new location.
313
Chapter 21: Creating Complex Shapes

7. To complete the path, Ô+click or Ctrl+ click elsewhere on the page or
simply choose another tool.
If you Ô+click or Ctrl+click, the Pen tool remains active, so you can con-
tinue creating new paths.
Curved lines
Knowing how to draw zigzag lines is fine, but chances are, you want to draw
curved shapes as well. The basic process is similar to drawing straight seg-
ments, but drawing curved paths (technically called Bézier paths) is more
complicated and will take you some time to get the hang of.
If you want to draw a continuously curvy path that contains no corner points
and no straight segments, you should create only smooth points as you draw.
Here’s how:
1. Select the Pen tool.
2. Move the Pen pointer to where you want to start the curve segment.
3. Click and hold down the mouse button.
The arrowhead pointer appears.
4. Drag the mouse in the direction of the next point you intend to create
and then release the mouse button.
As you drag, the anchor point, its direction line, and the direction line’s
two handles are displayed, as shown in Figure 21-2.
If you hold down the Shift key as you drag, the angle of the direction line
is limited to increments of 45 degrees.
314
Part V: Graphics Essentials 
How smooth and corner points work
Bézier paths have two kinds of points to join
segments: corner and smooth.
The two segments that form a smooth point’s
direction line work together as a single, straight
line. When you move a handle, the line acts like
a teeter-totter; the opposite handle moves in the
opposite direction. If you shorten one of the seg-
ments, the length of the other segment doesn’t
change. The angle and length of direction lines
determine the shape of the segments with which
they’re associated.
A corner point that connects two curved seg-
ments has two direction lines; a corner point that
connects two straight segments has no direction
lines; and a corner point that connects a straight
and curved segment has one direction line. If you
drag a corner point’s direction line, the other
direction line, if there is one, is not affected. 

5. Move the Pen pointer to where you want to place the next anchor
point — and end the first segment — and then drag the mouse.
If you drag in roughly the same direction as the direction line of the pre-
vious point, you create an S-shaped curve; if you drag in the opposite
direction, you create a C-shaped curve.
6. When the curve between the two anchor points looks how you want it
to look, release the mouse button.
Alternatively, when you want to connect curved segments to corner
points (shown in Figure 21-3), move the Pen pointer to where you want
to place the next anchor point — and end the first segment — and then
press and hold Option or Alt as you click and drag the mouse. As you
drag, the anchor point’s handle moves, and the direction line changes
from a straight line to two independent segments. The angle of the direc-
tion line segment that you create when you drag the handle determines
the slope of the next segment.

Chapter 21: Creating Complex Shapes

7. Repeat Steps 5 and 6 for each additional desired curved segment.
8. To complete the path, Ô+click or Ctrl+click elsewhere on the page or
simply choose another tool.
If you Ô+click or Ctrl+click, the Pen tool remains active, so you can
create new paths.
You can also complete the path by clicking on the first point you cre-
ated. This creates a closed path.
Closed paths
A closed path is simply a path that ends where it began. When it comes to cre-
ating closed paths with the Pen tool, the process is exactly the same as for
creating open paths, as explained earlier in this section, with one difference
at the end:
 To create a straight segment between the endpoint and the last anchor
point you created, click and release the mouse button.
 To create a curved segment, click and drag the mouse in the direction
of the last anchor point you created, and then release the mouse
button.
Just like an open path, a closed path can contain straight and/or curved
segments and smooth and/or corner anchor points. All the techniques
explained earlier in this chapter for drawing lines with curved and straight
segments and smooth and corner points apply when you draw closed
paths.
Modifying Your Paths and Shapes
No matter how skillful you become with InDesign’s Pen tool, it’s difficult to
create exactly what you want on your first attempt. For example, after cre-
ating a path, you might want to add detail, smooth out a rough spot, or turn
a straight segment into a curved one. No problem. In the following sections,
we discuss the ways in which InDesign lets you modify the paths you
create.
Generally, when you want to manipulate a path, you use one of the three vari-
ations of the Pen tool, all of which are displayed in a single pop-up menu in
the Tools palette (shown in Figure 21-4).
316
Part V: Graphics Essentials 

Working with anchor points
If you want to add detail to an existing path, you need to add anchor points
that give you more precise control over a portion of the path. Perhaps you’ve
drawn the profile of a face and you want to add detail to the nose. Or maybe
you’ve written your name longhand and you need to add a flourish that your
original attempt lacks. In both cases, you can add smooth or corner points
and then manipulate the curves associated with those points by moving
them or manipulating their direction lines.
On the other hand, maybe you’ve created a path that’s more complicated
than necessary. Perhaps you drew a hand with six fingers instead of five, or a
camel with one too many humps. In these instances, you need to simplify the
path by removing anchor points. InDesign lets you add and delete as many
anchor points as you want.
Follow these steps to add an anchor point:
1. Select the path by clicking it with the Direct Selection tool.
You can also select multiple paths and then modify them one at a time.
2. Select the Add Anchor Point tool.
3. Move the Pen pointer to the location where you want to add an
anchor point and click.
A new anchor point is created where you click. If you click a straight seg-
ment between two corner points, a corner point is created. If you click a
curved segment between two smooth points or between a smooth point
and a corner point, a smooth point is created. You can also click, drag,
and then release the mouse button if you want to adjust the direction
line of the point you create.
After you add an anchor point, you can hold down the Ô or Ctrl key or
switch to the Direct Selection tool and drag it or either of its direction
handles to adjust the adjoining segments.
Whenever you’re working on a path, you can hold down the Ô or Ctrl key and
then click and drag any element of the path — an anchor point, a direction
line, or the entire path.
Figure 21-4:

Chapter 21: Creating Complex Shapes

Here’s how you delete an anchor point:
1. Select the path by clicking it with the Direct Selection tool.
You can also select multiple paths and then modify them one at a time.
2. Select the Delete Anchor Point tool.
3. Click the anchor point that you want to delete.
Pretty easy, huh?
Moving anchor points is also an easy process. When you select a path with
the Direct Selection tool, its anchor points are displayed as small, hollow
squares. When you click and drag an anchor point, the two adjoining seg-
ments change, but the direction handles, if present, are not affected. If you
hold down the Shift key as you drag an anchor point, movement is restricted
to increments of 45 degrees.
If all you need to do is resize a path — particularly a simple rectangle — rather
than change its shape, you should select it with the Selection tool rather 
than the Direct Selection tool and then click and drag one of its bounding box
handles.
Converting anchor points
If you want to change a wavy path that contains only curved segments to a
zigzag path that contains only straight segments, you can do so by convert-
ing the smooth anchor points of the wavy path into corner points. Similarly,
by converting corner points to smooth points, you can smooth out a path
that contains straight segments.
To convert an anchor point, follow these steps:
1. Select the path by clicking it with the Direct Selection tool.
2. Choose the Convert Direction Point tool or simply hold down
Option+Ô or Ctrl+Alt when the Direct Selection tool is selected.
3. Move the pointer over the anchor point you want to convert.
Depending on the point you want to convert, do one of the following:
• To convert a corner point to a smooth point, click the corner 
point and then drag (direction lines are created and displayed as
you drag).
• To convert a smooth point to a corner point without direction
lines, click and release the mouse.
318
Part V: Graphics Essentials 

• To convert a smooth point to a corner point with independent
direction lines, click and drag either of the smooth point’s direc-
tion handles.
• To convert a corner point without direction lines to a corner point
with direction lines, click and drag the corner point to create a
smooth point and then release the mouse button. Then click and
drag either of the direction lines.
Handling handles
In addition to dragging and converting anchor points, you can adjust the
shape of a curved segment by dragging any of the handles for direction lines
associated with the anchor points at either end of the segment. Figure 21-5
shows how moving direction lines affects a curved segment.
To drag a curved segment’s direction handle, use the Direct Selection tool to
select the path, then just drag the desired handle. (Press Shift as you drag to
constrain movement to multiples of 45 degrees.) As you drag, the handle at
the opposite end of the direction line moves in the opposite direction, like a
teeter-totter. However, if you lengthen or shorten one side of a direction line,
the other side is not affected. Release the mouse button when the shape is as
you want it.
Corner points between straight segments don’t have direction handles. If you
want to modify the segments associated with a corner point, simply click and
drag the point.
If you use the Convert Direction Point tool (instead of the Direct Selection tool)
to click and drag a smooth point’s direction-line handle, the opposite portion of
the direction line remains unchanged. This lets you adjust the segment on one
side of a smooth point without affecting the segment on the other side.

Chapter 21: Creating Complex Shapes

Closing an open path
Closing an open path works in much the same way as extending an open path.
The only difference is that you complete the path — that is, you close it — by
clicking the other endpoint. For example, if you slice a graphics frame into two
pieces with the Scissors tool (which is explained in Chapter 20), two open
paths are created. If you add a stroke to these open frames, a portion of the
graphic edge (the nonexistent segment between the endpoints) will not be
stroked.
A quick way to close an open path is to select it and then choose Object➪
Path➪Close Path. You can also open a closed path by choosing Object➪
Path➪Open Path; this will separate the start point into a start point and 
end point, letting you move either point or the segments attached to them
independently.
Converting shapes
Although you can edit a shape with the techniques described earlier in this
section, doing so can be a lot of work for what should be a simple operation.
InDesign CS2 gives you a new, easy way to convert an object’s shape: Choose
Object➪Convert Shape and then choose one of the submenu options: Rectangle,
Rounded Rectangle, Beveled Rectangle, Inverse Rounded Rectangle, Ellipse,
Triangle, Polygon, Line, or Orthogonal Line. You can also use the Pathfinder
pane (Window➪Object & Layout➪Pathfinder), shown later in this chapter in
Figure 21-7.
Using the Erase tool
Just as it has tools to create paths, InDesign has a tool to delete them: the
Erase tool, accessible via the Pencil tool’s pop-up menu.
To erase straight lines, drag the tool alongside the path segment to cut —
making sure not to cross the path — and then release the mouse. The seg-
ment disappears.
But for freeform shapes, the tool takes some experimenting with. As Figure
21-6 shows, using the Erase tool results in a different shape depending on
what side of a shape you use it on. At the top is the result of using the Erase
tool outside a closed path. At the bottom is the result of using the tool inside
the path.
320
Part V: Graphics Essentials 

Combining Paths
Sometimes, you want to combine multiple paths to make them into one
object. InDesign gives you two basic ways to do so, depending on what you
are trying to combine. One case is when you want to join several paths into
one object, called a compound path. The other is when you want to merge
several paths into a new shape.
Working with compound paths
When more than one path is selected, you can use the Make (Compound
Path) command (Object➪Compound Paths➪Make or Ô+8 or Ctrl+8) to con-
vert the paths into a single object. You can use this command to create a
complex shape, such as a flower, from multiple individual shapes.
A compound path is similar to a group (see Chapter 13), except that when
you create a group out of several objects, each object in the group retains its
original attributes, such as stroke color and width, fill color or gradient, and
so on. By contrast, when you create a compound path, the attributes of the
bottommost path are applied to all the other paths (that is, the attributes of
the bottommost path replace the attributes of the other paths).
After you create a compound path, each original path becomes a subpath, so
you can still work on its shape. You can change the shape of any of the sub-
paths by clicking one with the Direct Selection tool and then clicking and

Chapter 21: Creating Complex Shapes

dragging any of its anchor points or direction handles. The Pen, Add Anchor
Point, Delete Anchor Point, and Change Direction Line tools covered earlier
in this chapter work the same for subpaths as for other paths, which means
that you can reshape them however you want.
But moving a subpath is a little tricky because you can’t drag just that sub-
path. If you try, all the subpaths move. If you want to move an entire subpath,
you must move each of the subpath’s anchor points individually. In this case,
it’s probably easier to release the compound path, as described next, move
the path as needed, and then re-create the compound path.
If you want to delete a subpath, you must use the Delete Anchor Point tool to
delete all its anchor points. If you delete a single anchor point of a closed
subpath, it becomes an open subpath.
If the Selection tool is active, you can’t delete anchor points with the Cut
command, the Clear command, or the Backspace, Clear or Delete keys. All of
these keyboard commands remove the entire path. To work on those individ-
ual points, be sure the Direct Selection tool is active instead.
If you decide you want to deconstruct a compound path, you can do so by
clicking anywhere within the compound path and then choosing Object➪
Compound Paths➪Release or pressing Option+Ô+8 or Ctrl+Alt+8. The result-
ing paths retain the attributes of the compound path (their original attributes
won’t come back).
Using the Pathfinder tools
The other way to combine paths is to merge them with the Pathfinder tool.
After selecting the objects to merge, choose Object➪Pathfinder. You can also
use the Pathfinder pane (Window➪Object & Layout➪Pathfinder). You see five
options in the Object➪Pathfinder submenu and in the Pathfinder pane: Add,
Subtract, Intersect, Exclude Overlap, and Minus Back. Figure 21-7 shows how
they affect a group of paths (two open and one closed).
These effects are hard to explain, so you want to experiment, but at a basic
level, here’s what they do:
 Add adds all objects’ shapes together.
 Subtract subtracts all objects from the bottommost object in the stack.
 Intersect creates an object in which objects overlap — this works only
on closed paths.
 Exclude Overlap removes overlapping paths and keeps the 
non-overlapping paths of all objects.
 Minus Back subtracts all objects from the top object in the stack.

Part V: Graphics Essentials 

Special Effects for Graphics
In addition to everything else InDesign lets you do with paths and shapes, it
also includes a few fun special effects that you won’t use every day, but that
can add a neat touch when it’s appropriate.
Adding corner effects to paths
When a path is selected, the Corner Effects command (Object➪Corner
Effects) lets you apply any of several graphic embellishments to the path’s
corner points (if it has any corner points). For example, you can use a corner
effect to add pizzazz to the border of a coupon or a certificate. Generally,
corner effects work best with rectangular shapes, but they can also produce
interesting results when applied to free-form shapes, as shown in Figure 21-8.
(Chapter 12 covers the use of corner effects with frames and shapes.)

Chapter 21: Creating Complex Shapes

To apply a corner effect to a path:
1. Use either of the selection tools to select a path.
2. Choose Object➪Corner Effects.
The Corner Effects dialog box appears.
3. Choose a Corner Effect from the Effect pop-up menu.
If you want to see the effect while you create it, click Preview and, if nec-
essary, move the dialog box out of the way so you can see the selected
path.
4. In the Size field, type the distance away from the corner point that the
effect will extend.
5. After you finish specifying the appearance of the corner effect, click
OK to close the dialog box.
InDesign doesn’t let you modify the built-in corner effects or add your own to
the list of choices. Nor can you use the Direct Selection tool to modify the
corner of a path to which a corner effect has been applied (anchor points are
not displayed for the additional segments that are added when a corner effect
is applied to a corner point). The only control you have over a corner effect is
the value you specify in the Radius field of the Corner Effects dialog box.
Converting text into shapes
If you want to use the shape of a letter or the combined shapes of several let-
ters as a frame for text or a graphic, you could test your skill with the Pen tool
and create the letter shape(s) yourself. But getting hand-drawn characters to

look just the way you want them to can take lots of time. A quicker solution is
to use the Create Outlines command to convert text characters into editable
outlines. The Create Outlines command is particularly useful if you want to
hand-tweak the shapes of characters, particularly at display font sizes, or
place text or a graphic within character shapes.
If all you need to do is apply a stroke or fill to characters within text, you
don’t have to convert the characters into outlines. Instead, simply highlight
the characters and use the Stroke pane (Window➪Stroke or F10) and
Swatches pane (Window➪Swatches or F5) to change their appearance. This
way you can still edit the text. (See Chapter 18 for more details.)
When you use the Create Outlines command, you have the choice of creating
an inline compound path that replaces the original text or an independent
compound path that’s placed directly on top of the original letters in its own
frame. If you want the text outlines to flow with the surrounding text, create
an inline compound path. If you want to use the outlines elsewhere, create an
independent compound path.
To convert text into outlines:
1. Use the Type tool to highlight the characters you want to convert into
outlines.
Generally, this feature works best with large font sizes.
2. Choose Type➪Create Outlines or press Shift+Ô+O or Ctrl+Shift+O
(that’s the letter O, not a zero).
If you hold down the Option or Alt key when you choose Create
Outlines, or if you press Shift+Option+Ô+O or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+O, a com-
pound path is created and placed in front of the text. In this case, you
can use either of the selection tools to move the resulting compound
path. If you don’t hold down Option or Alt when you choose Create
Outlines, an inline compound path is created. This object replaces the
original text and flows with the surrounding text.
When you create outlines out of a range of highlighted characters, a com-
pound path is created, and each of the characters becomes a subpath. You
can use the Release (Compound Path) command (Object➪Compound
Paths➪Release or Option+Ô+8 or Ctrl+Alt+8) to turn each of the subpaths
into independent paths, as described earlier in this chapter.
After you create text outlines, you can modify the paths the same as you can
modify hand-drawn paths — by selecting them with the Direct Selection tool
and then adding, deleting, or moving anchor points; clicking and dragging
direction handles; and converting smooth points to corner points and vice
325
Chapter 21: Creating Complex Shapes

versa. You can also use the transformation tools, the Control palette (Window➪
Control or Option+Ô+6 or Ctrl+Alt+6), and the Transform pane (Window➪
Transform or F9) to change the appearance of text outlines. You cannot, how-
ever, edit text after converting it to outlines.
Additionally, you can use the Place command (File➪Place or Ô+D or Ctrl+D)
or the Paste Into command (Edit➪Paste Into or Option+Ô+V or Ctrl+Alt+V)
to import text or a graphic into the frames created by converting text to
graphics.

In this part . . .
F
inally, your layout is done. It’s beautiful, it’s well-
written, and you’re eager to share it with your read-
ers. This part shows you how to take the final step to
print or create a PDF version of your layout so you can
distribute it. InDesign gives you a lot of control over
output, so you can optimize the results based on what
you are printing it to, such as ensuring color fidelity and
the best possible image resolution. Then you can start
the whole creation, refinement, and output process over
again with your next layout!

Chapter 22
Setting Up for Output
In This Chapter
 Setting up printers in your operating system
 Checking your files before you print
You’ve finished your document and you want to share it with the whole
world, or at least your audience. So you reach for your mouse and
choose File➪Print or quickly press Ô+P or Ctrl+P so you can print.
Stop. Cancel. If this is your first print job with InDesign, you need to make
sure that you’ve properly set up your printer to get the results you need.
You also should do a visual proof of your layout before you print. It’s amazing
what you don’t notice when you’re focused on specific elements as you lay
out a page. Change your view setting so the entire page or spread fits in the
window (choose View➪Fit Page in Window or View➪Fit Spread in Window, as
desired) and then review your pages.
Properly Setting Up Your Printer
Before you can print or create a PDF file of your document, you first need to
make sure your system is set up with the right printer driver and printer
description files — without these, your output is not likely to match your
needs or expectations.
It’s also important to set these up before you use the Preflight tool (covered
later in this chapter) to detect possible output problems before you print,
because the Preflight tool checks your document against the active printer
settings (such as color separations), and you can’t have selected printer set-
tings until the printer is set up.
The Mac and Windows platforms handle printing differently, so in this chap-
ter we’ve divided all system-specific printing information, such as the cover-
age of drivers, into platform-specific sections.

Setting up Macintosh printers
Although you choose the printer type in the Setup pane of the InDesign Print
dialog box, you still need to set up the printer on your Mac before you can
use it.
The process varies based on which version of the Mac OS you have:
 In Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther) and later, use the Printer Setup Utility, which
you access by choosing Ú➪System Preferences➪Print & Fax and then
clicking Set Up Printers in the resulting Print & Fax pane. You get the
Printer List dialog box.
 In Mac OS X 10.2 (Jaguar), you use an application called the Print Center,
which is in the Utilities folder of the Applications folder.
The Printer List dialog box or the Print Center will list any installed printers.
If you see the printer to which you want to print in the Printer List or Print
Center, you’ve already installed your printer.
Otherwise, make sure the printer you want to set up is connected to your
Mac (directly or through the network) and turned on. (If you use a network
printer, make sure the right network protocols, such as IP and AppleTalk, are
turned on through the Network pane in the System Preferences dialog box,
which you access by choosing ➪System Preferences.)
Either way, to install a printer, you typically run a program that comes with
the printer. Such programs often add the printer to the Printer List. If not,
click Add (in the Printer List) and locate the printer driver for your printer
(again, usually found on a CD that accompanies the printer).
Figure 22-1 shows the Printer List that appears when you open the Mac OS X
10.3 Print & Fax pane and click Set Up Printers.
How you configure an installed printer varies based on the software provided
with the printer. In some cases, a printer’s configuration software is accessi-
ble when you add a printer through the Printer List dialog box. (In Mac OS X
10.3, select the printer and click Show Info to get the Printer dialog box,
which will have a pop-up menu that lets you move among the various setup
panes. In earlier versions of Mac OS X, select the printer and click the
Configure button.)
In other cases, you need to run a separate utility that comes with the printer
or use controls on the printer itself.
330
Part VI: Printing and Output Essentials 

You may need to install a PostScript Printer Description (PPD) file that contains
specific details about your printer. This file should come on a disk or CD with
your printer and is often installed with the printer’s setup program. Otherwise,
download it from the printer manufacturer’s Web site. These files should reside
in the PPD folder in the Mac’s System\Library\Printers folder. Note that
Mac OS X preinstalls some PPDs for you, particularly those for Apple-branded
printers and some Hewlett-Packard printers. If you’re installing a printer not
connected to your computer or network, such as the imagesetter used by your
service bureau, you need to install the PPD files so InDesign knows what its set-
tings are; installing the printer software isn’t necessary.
Mac OS X supports multiple printers, but it also lets you define the default
printer. To change the default printer, open the Printer List dialog box,
choose the printer you want to be the default, and then click Make Default.
Setting up Windows printers
To set up a Windows XP printer, choose Start➪Settings➪Printers and Faxes.
(Some XP users will have to choose Start➪Control Panel➪Printers and Other
Hardware.) In Windows 2000, choose Start➪Settings➪Printers. You see a
window with a list of existing printers and an icon labeled Add New Printer.
Double-click the printer that you want to set up or double-click Add New

Chapter 22: Setting Up for Output

Printer (you likely need either a disk that came with the printer or the
Windows CD-ROM if you add a new printer because Windows needs informa-
tion specific to that printer). Note that some printers have their own setup
software that you should use instead of the Add Printer utility in Windows.
If you’re setting up a printer connected through the network, you usually select
the Local Printer option during installation. The Network Printer option is for
printers connected to a print server, as opposed to printers connected to a
hub or router. (A print server is a special kind of router, but it’s typically used
only for printers that don’t have networking built in, such as many inkjet print-
ers.) In some cases, even if your printer uses a print server, you still install the
printer as a local printer and then create a virtual port that maps to a network
address (Hewlett-Packard uses this approach, for example, in Figure 22-2).
If you’re installing a printer not connected to your computer or network,
such as the imagesetter used by your service bureau, you need to install the
PPD (PostScript Printer Description) file so InDesign knows what its settings
are. (You don’t need to install the printer software.) This file should come on
a disk or CD with your printer and is often installed with the printer’s setup
program. Otherwise, download it from the printer manufacturer’s Web site.
(Windows places PPD files in the Windows\System32\spool\drivers\
w32x86 folder; note that the first folder may be named WinNT or WinXP
instead of Windows.)
After you open an existing printer, choose Printer➪Properties to display the
dialog box shown in Figure 22-2. The one pane you most need to pay atten-
tion to is the Device Settings pane, which is where you specify all the device
settings, from paper trays to memory to how fonts are handled. For
PostScript printers, this pane contains several key options, as follows:
 Font Substitution Table: This option opens a list of available fonts and
lets you select how any TrueType fonts are translated to PostScript. The
best (and default) setting is to have the printer translate TrueType fonts
such as Arial to PostScript fonts such as Helvetica. (The Windows stan-
dards of Arial, Times New Roman, Courier New, and Symbol are set by
default to translate to the PostScript fonts Helvetica, Times, Courier, and
Symbol. PostScript fonts are set by default to Don’t Substitute.)
 Add Euro Currency Symbol to PostScript Fonts: Be sure to select this
option so the euro symbol (€) is available in all output.
We strongly recommend that you use Adobe’s PostScript driver rather than
Microsoft’s. The Microsoft driver often doesn’t send fonts to the printer, and
it often prints extra blank pages at the end of a job. The Adobe Universal
PostScript driver doesn’t have these issues. You can download the Adobe
driver from www.adobe.com/support/downloads/main.html in the
PostScript Printer Drivers section. When you install the driver, it gives you
the option of converting your existing PostScript printers to the Adobe
driver. You can also run this program again to install new printers using the
332
Part VI: Printing and Output Essentials 

Adobe driver — using the Add Printer wizard automatically installs the
Microsoft driver for those new printers — or you can use the Drivers pop-up
menu in the Advanced pane of the printer’s Properties dialog box.
To set a printer as the default printer, right-click the printer in the Printers
window (as described earlier in this section) and select Set Default Printer
from the contextual menu that appears.
Checking Your Document before Printing
Now that your printers are set up, you can use InDesign’s preprinting
checkup tool, called Preflight. The Preflight tool examines your document for
any issues of concern and gives you a report on what might need to be fixed.
You may wonder why you need a Preflight tool to check for things such as
missing fonts and images when InDesign lists any missing fonts and graphics
when you open a document. The answer is that sometimes fonts and graphics
files are moved after you open a file, in which case you won’t get the alerts
from InDesign. This is more likely to happen if you work with files and fonts on
a network drive, rather than with local fonts and graphics. Preflight also checks
for other problematic issues, such as the use of RGB files and TrueType fonts.
If you’re working with the InDesign books feature (see Chapter 9), you can pre-
flight the book’s chapters from an open book’s pane by using the Preflight Book
option in its palette menu. (If one or more documents in the book are selected
in the pane, the menu option changes to Preflight Selected Documents.) The
options are the same as for preflighting individual documents.
Figure 22-2:

333
Chapter 22: Setting Up for Output

Running the Preflight tool is easy. Choose File➪Preflight or press Shift+
Option+Ô+F or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+F. In a few seconds, a dialog box appears that
shows the status of your document. Here’s what the six panes in the Preflight
dialog box do:
 The Summary pane (shown in Figure 22-3) shows you a summary of
alerts. If your document has layers, you can select or deselect the Show
Data for Hidden Document Layers option. If selected, layers that won’t
print are analyzed for font, image, and other issues. Select this option
only if the person receiving your document plans on printing hidden
layers. For example, in a French-and-English document, you may have
hidden the French layer for proofing but still want it checked because
the service bureau is instructed to print the document twice — once
with the English layer on and the French layer off, and once with the
English layer off and the French layer on.
 The Fonts pane (shown in Figure 22-4) shows the type of each font
(Type 1 PostScript, OpenType, or TrueType) so you can spot any
TrueType fonts before they go to your service bureau. (TrueType fonts
usually don’t print easily on imagesetters, so use a program like Pyrus
FontLab to translate them to PostScript instead.) It will also show if any
fonts are missing from your system. You can search for missing fonts, as
well as replaced unwanted TrueType fonts, by clicking Find Font.
 The Links and Images pane shows whether any graphics files are miss-
ing or if the original image has been modified since you placed it in your
layout. You can click Update to correct any such bad links one at a time,
or Repair All to have InDesign prompt you in turn for each missing or
modified file. The pane also shows whether a color profile is embedded
in your graphics in case files that should have them don’t or in case a
file that should not have an embedded profile does. (See Chapter 23 for
334
Part VI: Printing and Output Essentials 
Giving InDesign a preflighting target
Before you run the Preflight tool, you may want to
set up your printer output so the tool accurately
checks your document’s setup in anticipation of,
for example, whether you plan to output color
separations or spot colors. To do this, choose
File➪Print Presets➪Define to open the Print
Preset dialog box, and then click New. The New
Print Preset dialog box will appear, giving you the
same options as the Print dialog box (covered in
Chapter 23). Click OK when you are finished with
your preset, then click OK again to close the Print
Presets dialog box and return to your layout. (You
can also save settings in the Print dialog box by
clicking Save Preset before printing.)
But don’t confuse InDesign’s print setup with the
operating system’s printer setup. InDesign’s Print
dialog box contains a button called Printer (on
the Mac) and Setup (in Windows) that lets you
change print settings for all applications — it’s
essentially a shortcut to the operating-system
controls described earlier in this section. You
should change these operating-system settings
only for output controls that InDesign’s Print
dialog box does not provide.

all the goods on color profiles.) It also alerts you if you use RGB images;
although such images will print and color-separate, InDesign provides
the warning because it’s usually better to convert RGB images to CMYK
in an image editor or illustration program so you can control the final
appearance, rather than rely on InDesign or the output device to do the
translation.
 The Colors and Inks pane shows the color of the inks that will be used
in the output. (If you are printing color separations, these correspond to
the color plates that will eventually be used to print the document on a
printing press.) You can’t modify anything here — it’s simply for infor-
mational purposes — but it’s a handy way to ensure that you aren’t acci-
dentally using a spot color that will print to a separate color plate when
you meant to print it as a process color using the standard CMYK plates.

Chapter 22: Setting Up for Output

 The Print Settings pane shows how the document is configured to print
in the Print dialog box. This is why it’s key to configure the output set-
tings, as described earlier, before preflighting your document.
 The External Plug-ins pane shows any plug-in programs that are
required in order to output the file. Amazingly, some third-party plug-ins
make changes to the InDesign document that require the same plug-in to
be installed at each computer that opens the file. This dialog box alerts
you if you have such a dependency.
You can limit the status list in most panes to display only problems by select-
ing the Show Problems Only option.
By clicking Report, you can generate a text file containing the information
from the Preflight dialog box’s panes, which you can give to your service
bureau to check its settings and files against.
You can also click Package to gather all related fonts and files into one folder
for delivery to a service bureau or other outside printing agency. Click Cancel
to exit the Preflight dialog box and go back to your document.

rinting is more complex than just choosing File➪Print, or it can be,
depending on what you’re printing and on what printing device you’re
using. For example, printing a full-color brochure involves more settings and
steps than printing a proof copy to your laser printer or inkjet printer. So as
you go through this chapter, keep in mind that many steps aren’t relevant
every time you print — but understanding the basics of printing ensures that
you follow the right steps for each type of project. When you know the steps
for printing one document, the process for printing every other document is
very easy.
Chapter 22 explains how to set up your Mac or PC for printing in InDesign. Be
sure that those settings are in place before you try to print anything.
Calibrating Color
If you’re producing color documents for printing on a printing press, you may
want to use InDesign’s built-in color calibration tools. In a sense, you have to,
because color calibration is now always on. But color calibration is some-
thing you don’t do in a vacuum — you have to do it in your graphics pro-
grams as well, so that every piece of software that handles your graphics is
working from the same color assumptions.

If you use Adobe Creative Suite 2, you can use a consistent color management
system (CMS) in all of the CS2 programs, ensuring consistent color. For
scanned images, digital camera photos, and the like, you can also tell InDesign
the source device so InDesign knows the color assumptions that the device
makes and can use that information to adjust the colors during printing
accordingly.
In InDesign CS2, color management is always on, which is a change from pre-
vious versions.
Ensuring consistent color
You can set the CMS settings in InDesign by choosing Edit➪Color Settings to
get the dialog box shown in Figure 23-1. Most of Adobe’s Creative Suite 2
applications have the same dialog box, although sometimes you access it in
different ways:
 Photoshop CS2: Choose Photoshop➪Color Settings on the Mac and
Edit➪Color Settings in Windows, or pressing Shift+Ô+K or Ctrl+Shift+K.
 Illustrator CS2: Choose Illustrator➪Color Settings or press Ctrl+Ô+K on
the Mac; choose Edit➪Color Settings or press Ctrl+Shift+K in Windows.
 GoLive CS2: Choose GoLive➪Color Settings on the Mac and Edit➪Color
Settings in Windows. (No keyboard shortcut is available.)
 Acrobat 7: Choose Acrobat➪Preferences or press Ô+K on the Mac;
choose Edit➪Preferences or press Ctrl+K in Windows, and then go to the
Color Management pane. Note that this pane’s appearance differs from
the appearance of other Creative Suite 2 applications’ color-settings panes.
When you load a bitmapped image into InDesign, the active CMS applies the
default settings defined in the Color Settings dialog box (choose Edit➪Color
Settings). If the document has no embedded color profile, a dialog box
appears with a list of color profiles, as well as options to apply the default
you’ve set up in InDesign or to apply no profile. (If you choose not to apply a
profile, the color won’t be adjusted during printing.)
Whether or not there are embedded profiles for the document, you can
change the color settings for specific images as follows:
 As you import each file, select Show Import Options in the Place dialog
box (choose File➪Place or press Ô+D or Ctrl+D) when you place a graphic
into InDesign. In the resulting Image Import Options dialog box, go to the
Color pane and select the appropriate profile from the Profile menu.
 Any time after you place an image, select it and choose Object➪Image
Color Settings to apply a different profile. (You can also choose Graphics➪
Image Color Settings from the contextual menu.)
338
Part VI: Printing and Output Essentials 

Saving color management preferences
You can save and use color management settings in other documents. The
process is simple: Click Save in the Color Settings dialog box to save the cur-
rent dialog box’s settings to a file. If you want to use the saved color-settings
information in another document, open that document and click Load in the
Color Settings dialog box, and then browse for and select the color settings
file. That’s it! This is a handy way to ensure consistency in a workgroup.
Changing document color settings
If you put together a document with specific color settings, but then decide
you want to apply a new profile across your pictures or replace a specific
profile globally in your document, you can:
 Choose Edit➪Assign Profiles to replace the color management settings
globally.
 Choose Edit➪Convert to Profile to change the document’s color work-
space. It also lets you change the CMS engine, rendering intent, and
black-point compensation settings.
Figure 23-1:

339
Chapter 23: Printing and Other Output Techniques

There’s real overlap in these two dialog boxes. Using the Assign Profiles
dialog box to replace the document profile does the same job as the Convert
to Profile dialog box when it comes to replacing the profiles. The only differ-
ence is that the Assign Profiles dialog box can also remove profiles from the
document.
Calibrating output
When you’re ready to output your document to a printer or other device, set
the profile and rendering intent for that destination device in the Color
Management pane of the Print dialog box (choose File➪Print or press Ô+P or
Ctrl+P), which has a Options section with the Color handling and Printer
Profile pop-up menus. Here you select the appropriate option for your output
device. (If you don’t know, ask an expert.)
Choosing Print Options
When your document is ready to print, go to the Print dialog box (choose
File➪Print or press Ô+P or Ctrl+P). The Print dialog box has eight panes as
well as several options common to all the panes. (We cover just the essential
ones here.) Change any options and click Print, and InDesign sends your doc-
ument to the printer. Figure 23-2 shows the dialog box.

Part VI: Printing and Output Essentials 

If you’re working with the InDesign books feature (see Chapter 9), you can
print the book’s chapters from an open book’s pane by using the Print Book
option in its palette menu. (If one or more documents in the book are
selected in the pane, the menu option changes to Print Selected Documents.)
The setup options are the same as for printing individual documents.
General options
The general options available in the dialog box, no matter what pane is
selected, are as follows:
 Print Preset: This pop-up menu lets you save a group of printer settings,
which makes it easy to switch between, say, a proofing printer and a
final output device.
 Printer: This pop-up menu lets you select the printer to use.
 PPD: This pop-up menu lets you select PostScript Printer Descriptions,
which are files that contain configuration and feature information specific
to a brand and model of printer. You installed these into your operating
system by using software that comes from your printer manufacturer. If
InDesign finds no compatible PPDs, it uses generic options. If InDesign
finds just one compatible PPD, it uses that automatically; otherwise, it
lets you select a PPD.
 Save Preset: Clicking this button saves any settings that you change in the
Print dialog box and lets you choose a name for those saved settings for
reuse. If you change the dialog box’s settings but don’t save these changes
as a print preset, InDesign changes the name of the current settings in the
Print Preset pop-up menu to [Custom] to remind you the settings are
changed and unsaved.
You can also create print presets by choosing File➪Print Presets➪Define,
or edit an existing preset by choosing File➪Print Presets➪Preset Name.
When you click New or Edit in the resulting dialog box, a dialog box iden-
tical to the Print dialog box appears, except that the Print button
becomes the OK button.
 Setup (Windows); Page Setup and Printer (Mac): These buttons give
you access to printer-specific controls. You use these dialog boxes to
specify options such as printing to file, paper sources, and printer reso-
lution. Note that if you add a printer, you may need to quit InDesign and
restart it for it to see the new printer.
 Cancel: Clicking this button closes the Print dialog box without printing.
Use this if you’ve clicked Save Preset but don’t want to print, as well
when you have any reason not to print.
 Print: Clicking this button prints the document based on the current 
settings.

 Page preview panel: This panel at lower left shows the current settings
graphically. The page is indicated by the blue rectangle, and the direc-
tion of the large P indicates the printing orientation; in Figure 23-2,
shown previously, the P is unrotated. The panel shows that the paper
itself is the same size as the page (the page is shown in white, and if the
paper were larger than the page, you’d see a light gray area around the
page indicating the excess paper). This preview changes as you adjust
settings in the dialog box.
The General pane
The General pane contains the basic settings for your print job. Most are self-
explanatory, but note the following:
 When specifying a range of pages in the Pages option, you can type non-
consecutive ranges, such as 1–4, 7, 10–13, 15, 18, 20. If you want to
print from a specific page to the end of the document, just type the
hyphen after the initial page number, such as 4–. InDesign figures out
what the last page is. Similarly, to start from the first page and end on a
specified page, just start with the hyphen, as in –11. InDesign lets you
type absolute page numbers in the Range field. For example, typing
+6–+12 would print the document’s 6th through 12th pages, no matter
what their page numbers are.
 Selecting the Spreads option prints facing pages on the same sheet of
paper, such as putting two letter-size pages on one 11-×17-inch sheet.
This is handy when showing clients proposed designs, but make sure
you have a printer that can handle a large paper size or that you scale
the output down to fit (through the Setup pane, which we cover in the
following section).
The Setup pane
The Setup pane is where you tell InDesign how to work with the paper (or
other media, such as film negatives) to which you’re printing. The options are
straightforward, so we just highlight a few notes and tips:
 Custom page size: Choosing some printer models will in turn let you
choose a Custom option in the Page Size pop-up menu, in which case you
type the dimensions in the Width and Height fields, as well as position
the output through the Offset and Gap fields. These latter two options are
usually used when printing to a roll, such as in an imagesetter using
photo paper (called RC paper, a resin-coated paper that keeps details
extremely sharp), so you can make sure there is space between the left
edge of the roll and the page boundary (the offset), as well as between
pages (the gap). Most printers can’t print right to the edge, thus the
342
Part VI: Printing and Output Essentials 

Offset setting. You also want a gap between pages for crop and registra-
tion marks, as well as to have room to physically cut the pages.
 Traverse option: Don’t use the Transverse option, which rotates the
output 90 degrees, unless your service bureau or production depart-
ment tells you to. Otherwise, you might have your pages cut off on the
final negatives.
 Tile options: Use the Tile options to print oversized documents. InDesign
breaks the document into separate pages — called tiles — that you later
can assemble together. To enable tiling, select the Tile option, and then
choose the appropriate option from the adjoining pop-up menu:
• Manual: This lets you specify the tiles yourself. To specify a tile,
you change the origin point on the document ruler, and the new
origin point becomes the upper-left corner of the current tile. (To
change the origin point, just drag the upper left corner of the rulers
to a new position in your document.) To print multiple tiles this
way, you need to adjust the origin point and print, adjust the origin
point to the next location and print, and so on, until you’re done.
• Auto: This lets InDesign figure out where to divide the pages into
tiles. You can change the default amount of overlap between tiles
of 1.5 inches by using the Overlap field. The overlap lets you easily
align tiles by having enough overlap for you to see where each
should be placed relative to the others.
• Auto Justified: This is similar to Auto except that it makes each
tile the same size, adjusting the overlap if needed to do that. (The
Auto option, by contrast, simply starts at the origin point and then
does as much of the page as will fit in the tile, which means the last
tile may be a different width than the others. You can see the differ-
ence between the two by watching how the page preview window
at left changes as you select each option.
The Marks and Bleed pane
The Bleed and Slug area of the Marks and Bleed pane controls how materials
print past the page boundary. A bleed is used when you want a picture, color,
or text to go right to the edge of the paper. Because there is slight variation
on positioning when you print because the paper moves mechanically
through rollers and might move slightly during transit, publishers have any
to-the-edge materials actually print beyond the edge, so there are never any
gaps. It’s essentially a safety margin. A normal bleed margin would be 0p9 
(1⁄8 inch), though you can make it larger if you want.
A slug is an area beyond the bleed area in which you want printer’s marks to
appear. The reader never sees this, but the workers at the commercial printer
do, and it helps them make sure they have the right pages, colors, and so on.
Like the bleed, the slug area is trimmed off when the pages are bound into a
343
Chapter 23: Printing and Other Output Techniques

magazine, newspaper, or whatever. (The word slug is an old newspaper term
for this identifying information, based on the lead slug once used for this pur-
pose on old printing presses.) The purpose of the slug is to ensure there is
enough room for all the printer’s marks to appear between the bleed area and
the edges of the page. Otherwise, InDesign will do the best it can.
It’s best to define your bleed and slug areas in your document itself when you
create the document in the New Document dialog box (choose File➪New➪
Document or press Ô+N or Ctrl+N), as covered in Chapter 5. You can also use
the Document Setup dialog box (choose File➪Document Setup or press
Option+Ô+P or Ctrl+Alt+P). The two dialog boxes have the same options; if
they don’t show the Bleed and Slug section, click More Options to see them.
But if you didn’t define your bleeds previously, you can do so in the Print
dialog box’s Marks and Bleed pane. You can also override those New
Document or Document Setup document settings here. To use the document
settings, select the Use Document Bleed Settings option. Otherwise, type in a
bleed area by using the Top, Bottom, Left, and Right fields. If you want the
four fields to be the same, click the broken-chain button to the right of the
Top field; it becomes a solid chain, indicating that all four fields will have the
same value if any is modified. Any bleed area is indicated in red in the pre-
view pane at the bottom left.
If you want to set the slug area, select the Include Slug Area option. InDesign
then reserves any slug area defined in the New Document or Document Setup
dialog box. You can’t set up the slug area in the Print dialog box.
The Output pane
The next pane is the Output pane, which controls the processing of colors
and inks on imagesetters, platesetters, and commercial printing equipment.
For proof printing, such as to a laser printer or an inkjet printer, the only
option that you need to worry about is on the Color pop-up menu, which con-
trols whether the colors print as color or as grayscale.
The options in the Output pane are for experts and should be specified in
coordination with your service bureau and commercial printer — they can
really mess up your printing if set incorrectly.
One area that you should set is in the Ink Manager dialog box. Accessed by
clicking Ink Manager, the Ink Manager dialog box, shown in Figure 23-3, gives
you finer controls over how color negatives output. If any colors should have
been converted to process color but weren’t, you have three choices:
 Click the spot color icon. You can override the spot color in the Ink
Manager dialog box by clicking this icon (a circle) to the left of the
color’s name. That converts it to a process color. (Clicking the process
344
Part VI: Printing and Output Essentials 

color icon, a four-color box, converts a color back to a spot color.) This
is the way to go for a quick fix.
 Make the spot color a process color instead. Do this by closing the Ink
Manager and Print dialog boxes, and editing the color that was incorrectly
set as a spot color in the Swatches pane (choose Window➪Swatches or
press F5) as we cover in Chapter 10. This ensures that the color is perma-
nently changed to a process color for future print jobs.
 Convert all spot colors to CMYK process equivalents. Do this by select-
ing the All Spots to Process option. This is the easiest method to make
sure you don’t accidentally print spot-color plates for a CMYK-only 
document.
The other Ink Manager options are for experts and should be changed only 
in consultation with your service bureau, production department, and/or
commercial printer.
The Graphics pane
By using the Graphics pane, you control how graphics are printed and how
fonts are downloaded. The options here are meant for professional printing,
such as to imagesetters, in situations where you’re working with a service
bureau or in-house printing department. This is also an expert area, so
change these settings only after consulting with an experienced pro.
The Color Management pane
The Color Management pane is where you manage color output (apply color
calibration). Most options should be changed only in consultation with your
service bureau or production department.
Figure 23-3:
The Ink
Manager
dialog box
345
Chapter 23: Printing and Other Output Techniques

One option you should be able to change on your own is Printer Profile. Use
this pop-up menu to select the device to which the document will ultimately
be printed. This is by default the same as the profile selected in the Edit
Color Settings pane, which we discuss earlier in this chapter, in the section
“Calibrating Color.”
The Advanced pane
The options in the Advanced pane let you control graphics file substitutions
in an Open Prepress Interface (OPI) workflow and also set transparency flat-
tening, which controls how transparent and semitransparent objects are han-
dled during output. Again, these are expert options you should change only
in consultation with your service bureau or production department.
The Summary pane
The final Print dialog box pane is the Summary pane. It simply lists your set-
tings all in one place for easy review. The only option — Save Summary —
saves the settings to a file so you can include it with your files when deliver-
ing them to a service bureau or for distribution to other staff members so
they know the preferred settings.
Creating PDF Files
Sometimes you want to create a PDF file for distribution on the Web, on a CD,
on a corporate intranet, or even by e-mail. PDF creation is a really easy task
in InDesign. First choose File➪Export or press Ô+E or Ctrl+E. The Export
dialog box appears, which like any standard Save dialog box lets you name
the file and determine what drive and folder the file is to be saved in. The key
control in the Export dialog box is the Formats pop-up menu, where you
choose the format (in this case, Adobe PDF). Then click Save.
If you’re working with the InDesign Books feature (see Chapter 9), you can
export the book’s chapters to PDF files from an open book’s pane by using
the Export Book to PDF option in its palette menu. (If one or more documents
in the book are selected in the pane, the menu option changes to Export
Selected Documents to PDF.) The setup options are the same as for exporting
individual documents.
After you select Adobe PDF in the Export dialog box’s Formats pop-up menu
and give the file a name and location in the File Name and Save in areas, 
click Save to get the Export Adobe PDF dialog box shown later in this chapter
in Figure 23-4. 
346
Part VI: Printing and Output Essentials 

The dialog box has six panes; the General pane is displayed when you open 
the dialog box. There are several options that are accessible from all six
panes.
If you know how to use Acrobat Professional, you know how to set up your
PDF export. If not, it’s best to consult with a local expert because PDF export
options are as complex and job-specific as the print options we covered ear-
lier. Still, there are some basic options available in all the panes that you
should feel comfortable setting on your own:
 Adobe PDF Preset: This pop-up menu lets you select from both prede-
fined sets of PDF-export settings (similar to the printer presets covered
earlier in this chapter), as well as any presets you may have created.
 Compatibility: This pop-up menu lets you choose which PDF file version
to save the file as. Your options are Acrobat 4 (PDF 1.3), Acrobat 5 (PDF
1.4), Acrobat 6 (PDF 1.5), and Acrobat 7 (PDF 1.6). Choosing Acrobat 4
(PDF 1.3) is the best option for documents that you want to distribute on
CD or over the Web because it ensures the broadest number of people will
be able to view the file. Choose a later version only if you’re certain that
your intended recipients use that version of Acrobat or Adobe Reader. For
example, if your company has standardized on Acrobat 5 and the docu-
ment will be used only internally, picking the Acrobat 5 (PDF 1.4) option
makes sense. Likewise, if you’re sending the PDF file to a service bureau,
use the version of Acrobat that the service bureau uses because later ver-
sions of Acrobat support more features, especially for commercial print-
ing. (Versions 1.5 and later, for example, support native transparency.)
 Save Preset: Click this to save any settings made in the Export Adobe
PDF dialog box as a new preset. (You can also define new PDF presets by
choosing File➪PDF Export Presets➪Define.)
 Export: Click this to create the PDF file based on the settings that you
selected in the various panes.
347
Chapter 23: Printing and Other Output Techniques
Using Distiller job options
InDesign CS2 also lets you import settings from
Acrobat Distiller job-options files. You can load
such job-option files by clicking Load in the
Adobe PDF Presets dialog box (choose File➪PDF
Export Presets➪Define).
You can use the Adobe PDF Presets dialog box
to create and edit the job-option files for sharing
with Acrobat Distiller and other Creative Suite 2
users; just click Save when you’re done. When
creating or editing these PDF presets, you get
the same options that we describe in the previ-
ous section for the Export PDF dialog box.

The General pane
Use the General pane to determine what is exported. The Pages option gives
you the same flexibility as the Print dialog box’s Pages option, we cover in
the earlier section “Choosing Print Options.” Similarly, the Spread option
works like the same-name option in the Print dialog box.
In the Options section, you can select the following options:
 Embed Page Thumbnails: Select this option if you’re creating a PDF file
to be viewed on-screen. Thumbnails help people to more easily navigate
your document in the Adobe Reader program. However, if you’re send-
ing the PDF files to a service bureau or commercial printer for printing,
you don’t need to generate the thumbnails.
 Optimize for Fast Web View: Always select this option — this minimizes
file size without compromising the output.
 Create Tagged PDF: Select this option to embed XML tag information
into the PDF file. This is useful for XML-based workflows and Adobe
eBooks. If you don’t know what XML or eBooks are, you don’t need to
select this option.
 View PDF after Exporting: Select this option if you want to see the
results of the PDF export as soon as the export is complete. Typically,
however, you shouldn’t select this option because you likely will have
other things you want to do before launching Adobe Reader (or the full
Acrobat program, if you own it) to proof your files.
 Create Acrobat Layers: If you selected Acrobat 6 (PDF 1.5) or Acrobat 7
(PDF 1.6) in the Compatibility pop-up menu, you can select this option,
which outputs any InDesign layers to separate layers in Acrobat. (Acrobat
6 was the first version of Acrobat to support layers.) If you choose a differ-
ent Compatibility option, Create Acrobat Layers is grayed out.
In the Include section, you set what elements of the document are included in
the PDF file. You can select the following options:
 Bookmarks: This takes InDesign table-of-contents (TOC) information
and preserves it as bookmarks in the exported PDF file.
 Hyperlinks: This preserves any hyperlinks added in InDesign.
Otherwise, the hyperlinks are converted to standard text in the PDF file.
 Visible Guides and Grids: This includes the on-screen guides and grids
in the output version — an option you’d use only when creating PDF
files meant to be used as designer examples, not for readers or for 
prepress.
 Non-Printing Objects: This includes any objects marked as Nonprinting
through the Attributes pane (choose Window➪Attributes).
348
Part VI: Printing and Output Essentials 

 Interactive Elements: This preserves interactive objects such as but-
tons rather than convert them to static graphics.
 Multimedia: This pop-up menu lets you control how embedded sound
and video are handled. This option is available only if you choose
Acrobat 6 (PDF 1.5) or Acrobat 7 (PDF 1.6) in the Compatibility pop-up
menu. The options are Use Object Settings, Link All, or Embed All. In
InDesign, you can embed a sound or movie file, or link to one. This
option lets you override the individual settings and make all such
objects embedded or linked.
The Compression pane
All the options in this pane compress your document’s graphics. For docu-
ments you’re intending to print professionally, make sure that for the Color,
Grayscale, and Monochrome image types, the No Sampling Change option is
selected, and that Compression is set to None. You don’t want to do anything
that affects the resolution or quality of your bitmap images if you’re out-
putting to a high-resolution device.
But it’s fine to select the Crop Image Data to Frames option because this dis-
cards portions of pictures not visible on-screen, reducing file size and reduc-
ing processing time during output. (Imagesetters and other devices usually
have to process the entire image, even if only part of it is actually printed.)
You can also select the Compress Text and Line Art option. It compresses
vector graphics (both imported and those created in InDesign) as well as
text, but does so without affecting output quality.
For the rest, stick with the defaults based on the preset you chose, or check
with your production department.
Marks and Bleed pane
The Marks and Bleed pane in the Export Adobe PDF dialog box works just
like the Marks and Bleed pane in the Print dialog box, which we cover earlier
in this chapter.
The Output pane
The Output pane has two sections — Color and PDF/X — where you control
color calibration. Adjust these only if you’re creating a PDF file meant to be
used by a service bureau to print the final document on paper or to create
349
Chapter 23: Printing and Other Output Techniques

plates for commercial printing. Ask the people at your service bureau what
settings they prefer for this pane’s options.
The Output pane is new to InDesign CS2, though its features existed in the
Advanced pane in InDesign CS. Several of the options have been changed to
reflect InDesign CS2’s new color-management settings.
The Advanced pane
The Advanced pane in the Export Adobe PDF dialog box has the same options
as the Advanced pane in the Print dialog box, which we cover earlier in this
chapter. Like the Output pane, these options are relevant only if you’re gener-
ating a PDF file that your service bureau or commercial printer will use to
create the final printed output from.
Security pane
The Security pane, shown in Figure 23-4, has no relevance to documents
intended to be output at a service bureau or commercial printer, so make sure
the Require a Password to Open the Document and the Use a Password to
Restrict Printing, Editing, and Other Tasks option are not selected in that case.
Figure 23-4:

pane of the

dialog box.
350
Part VI: Printing and Output Essentials 

These settings are useful if you’re publishing the document electronically,
because they control who can access the document and what they can do
with the document once it’s open. Here’s how they work:
 Encryption Level: This section’s options depend on the option set in the
Compatibility pop-up menu; Acrobat 5 (PDF 1.4) or higher use High (128-
bit RC4) encryption, while earlier versions use 40-bit RC4.
 Document Open Password: In this section of the Security pane, you can
require a password to open the exported PDF file by selecting this option
and typing a password in the associated text field. If you don’t type a pass-
word here, you’re forced to type one in a dialog box that appears later. To
access protected content, recipients must use the Security pane in
Acrobat (choose File➪Document Properties or press Ô+D or Ctrl+D).
 Permissions: Here, you determine what restrictions to place on the PDF
file. Note that the options will vary based on what version of the PDF
format you selected in the General pane.
• Use a Password to Restrict Printing, Editing, and Other Tasks:
You can restrict recipients’ actions by selecting this option and
then specifying permissible actions by using the Printing Allowed
and Changes Allowed pop-up menus, as well as selecting from
among the options that follow (the number of options displayed
varies based on the preset chosen). You can also require a pass-
word to allow editing of the file in another application. Your man-
agement options include the following:
• Printing Allowed: You can select None, Low-Resolution (150 dpi),
or High Resolution. You would disable printing to ensure that the
material can be read only on-screen.
• Changes Allowed: You can select None; Inserting, Deleting and
Rotating Pages; Filling in Form Fields and Signing; Commenting,
Filling in Form Fields, and Signing; or Any Except Extracting Pages.
(Signing means using digital signatures to verify sender and recipi-
ent identities.)
• Enable Copying of Text, Images, and Other Content: If it’s okay
for recipients to use the PDF file’s objects, select this option.
• Enable Text Access of Screen Reader Devices for the Visually
Impaired: If you want the file to be accessible to visually impaired
recipients who use text-reader applications, select this option. This
option is available only if you are exporting to Acrobat 5 (PDF 1.4)
or later.
• Enable Plaintext Metadata: For documents with metadata — author-
ing information associated with XML documents and Web pages —
you can make that metadata visible to Web-based search engines
and similar applications by selecting this option. This option is avail-
able only if you are exporting to Acrobat 6 (PDF 1.5) or later.
351
Chapter 23: Printing and Other Output Techniques

The Summary pane
The final Export Adobe PDF dialog box pane is the Summary pane, which
simply lists your settings all in one place for easy review. The only option —
Save Summary — saves the settings to a file so you can include it with your
files when delivering them to a service bureau, or for distribution to other
staff members so they know the preferred settings.
Creating a Document Package
Have you ever given a page-layout document to a service bureau only to be
called several hours later because some of the files necessary to output your
document are missing? If so, you’ll love the Package feature in InDesign.
352
Part VI: Printing and Output Essentials 
Settings for on-screen usage
If your output is destined for use on a monitor —
such as from CD, on the Web, or in a corporate
intranet — use these settings when exporting to
PDF files:
 In the General pane, select the Optimize for
Fast Web View option. Also, check Spreads
if your facing pages are designed as one
visual unit.
 In the Compression pane, change the 
two Image Quality pop-up menus to Low. 
Also, choose any of the Downsampling or
Subsampling menu options in all three image
types’ sections. The pixels-per-inch (ppi)
value should be either 72 (if you intend people
just to view the images on-screen) or 300 or
600 (if you expect people to print the docu-
ments to a local inkjet or laser printer). Pick
the ppi value that best matches most users’
printers’ capabilities. For the Compression
pop-up menus, choose Automatic (JPEG) for
the color and grayscale bitmaps, and CCITT
Group 4 (the standard method for fax com-
pression) for black-and-white bitmaps. Set
Quality to Maximum for color and grayscale
bitmaps. Finally, select the Compress Text
and Line Art option.
 In the Marks and Bleeds pane, make sure
no printer’s marks are selected.
 In the Security pane, select the security
features (Document Open Password and
Permissions) and the options for which you
want to add security. Uncheck the Enable
Copying of Text and Graphics option to pre-
vent readers from copying and pasting your
content, and select None from the Printing
Allowed pop-up menu to prevent printing.
The Changes Allowed pop-up menu options
control whether readers can extra pages,
add comments to the file, fill in forms, delete
pages, or rotate pages. Typically, you’d
choose either Filling in Form Fields and
Signing (so readers could complete forms)
or Commenting, Filling in Forms, and Signing
(so readers can complete forms and add
their own comments) — both options keep
the user from accessing the underlying
content of your PDF files.

This command, which you access by choosing File➪Package or by pressing
Option+Shift+Ô+P or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+P, copies into a folder all the font, color-
output, and picture files necessary to output your document. It also gener-
ates a report that contains all the information about your document that a
service bureau is ever likely to need, including the document’s fonts, dimen-
sions, and trapping information. You can also create an instructions file that
has your contact information and any particulars you want to say about the
document.
When you run the Package command, InDesign preflights your document
automatically and gives you the option of viewing any problems it encoun-
ters. If you elect to view that information, the Preflight dialog box appears.
You can continue to package your document from that dialog box by clicking
Package after you assure yourself that none of the problems will affect the
document’s output. If it finds no problems during the automatic preflighting,
InDesign will not display the Preflight dialog box.
Before you can actually package the document, InDesign asks you to save the
current document, and then fill in the Printing Instructions form. You can
change the default filename from Instructions.txt to something more suitable,
such as the name of your print job. Often, you’ll leave the printing instruc-
tions blank — use it only if you have special instructions.
If you don’t want to create an instructions form, don’t click Cancel — that
cancels the entire package operation. Just click Continue, leaving the form
blank. Similarly, you must click Save at the request to save the document;
clicking Cancel stops the package operation as well.
The next step is to create the package folder. You do this in the dialog box
that follows the Printing Instructions form, which on the Mac is called Create
Package Folder and in Windows is called Package Publication. Figure 23-5
shows the Mac version, which except for the name at the top is the same as
the Windows version.
In the dialog box, you can select what is copied: the fonts, color-output pro-
files, and linked graphics (graphics pasted into an InDesign document rather
than imported are automatically included). You can also tell InDesign to
update the graphics links for those that were modified or moved; if this
Update Graphic Links in Package option isn’t selected, any missing or modi-
fied graphics files won’t be copied with the document.
You can tell InDesign to include fonts and links from hidden layers (which you
would do only if you want the service bureau to print those hidden layers or if
you were giving the document’s files to a colleague to do further work).
You also can specify whether the document should use only the hyphenation
exceptions defined within it. This often makes sense because it ensures that
the printer’s hyphenation dictionary — which may differ from yours — doesn’t
cause text to flow differently.
353
Chapter 23: Printing and Other Output Techniques

Finally, you can choose to view the report after the package is created — on
the Mac, InDesign launches TextEdit and displays the report file, and on
Windows it launches Notepad and displays the report file.
Click Save (on the Mac) or Package (in Windows) when everything is ready to
go. Your document is placed in the folder you specify, as is the instructions
file (the report). Inside that folder, InDesign will also create a folder called
Fonts that includes the fonts, a folder called Links that has the graphics files,
and a folder called Output Profiles that has the color output profiles.
We strongly recommend using the Package feature. It ensures that your ser-
vice bureau has all the necessary files and information to output your docu-
ment correctly.

Top Ten Must-Knows for
QuarkXPress Refugees
In This Chapter
 Transferring QuarkXPress files to InDesign
 Understanding what works differently
You’ve jumped on the InDesign bandwagon after seeing everything it can
do. Your problem is that a lot of QuarkXPress is still stuck in your brain.
This chapter helps you make the mental switch so that you can become a
native InDesigner.
Also, consider picking up a copy of QuarkXPress to InDesign: Face to Face, by
Galen Gruman (Wiley Publishing, Inc.), which shows you side by side how to
do in InDesign what you know how to do in QuarkXPress.
Opening Those Old QuarkXPress Files
InDesign opens QuarkXPress and QuarkXPress Passport files — but only in
versions 3.3, 4.0, and 4.1. If InDesign sees any problems when opening these
files, it gives you an alert so you know what to fix in the converted file. After
the file opens, it is untitled, so you need to give it a new name.
Paying Attention to Selection 
Tool Differences
If you’re a QuarkXPress veteran, the toughest thing about switching to
InDesign is the set of tools. InDesign’s Selection tool only lets you move and
resize objects, and the Direct Selection tool lets you reshape objects and
work with graphics. In InDesign, you use the Type tool to work with text, but
you can’t move or resize text frames while you’re using it.

Using Keyboard Shortcuts for Tools
Because InDesign requires a lot more switching among tools than QuarkXPress,
your mouse hand can tire very quickly. To avoid that, embrace InDesign’s
single-letter shortcuts for selecting tools.
Table 25-1 shows the shortcut translations for common activities.

Part VII: The Part of Tens 

Thinking Panes, Not Dialog Boxes
Keep in mind that many InDesign menu commands simply display a pane
(which may already be open) rather than show a dialog box. Get used to 
deciphering icons or using Tool Tips on the panes because InDesign doesn’t
have as many dialog boxes containing named fields as you’re used to in
QuarkXPress. Also, InDesign implements contextual menus on a broader
scale than QuarkXPress, so you can Control+click or right=click objects,
rulers, and more to make changes quickly.
Using Familiar Measurements
InDesign uses all of the QuarkXPress measurement abbreviations, as well as
its own. For example, InDesign accepts QuarkXPress’s use of " to indicate
inches, as well as InDesign’s own standard of in and inch.
Knowing Differences in Documents
By and large, documents in InDesign and QuarkXPress are the same. You
have master pages, layers, and pages. You can also set bleeds for objects that
go beyond the page boundary. The biggest difference is that InDesign’s
master text frame lets you automatically flow text from page to page, while
the QuarkXPress equivalent automatic text box places an empty text box on
each page for you to use as you see fit.
Working with Objects, Not Items
In QuarkXPress, you’re used to distinct items such as text boxes, picture
boxes, lines, and maybe text paths. In InDesign, you have more flexible
objects such as paths and frames that can contain graphics or text.
Approaching Text from a New Perspective
In many cases, InDesign works with text very differently than QuarkXPress,
even though the fundamental capabilities are the same in both programs.
Veteran QuarkXPress users will be frustrated initially with InDesign’s more-
laborious approach to text flow and formatting, but will eventually appreciate
some of InDesign’s more powerful capabilities such as stroke formatting and
nested styles.

Chapter 25: Top Ten Must-Knows for QuarkXPress Refugees

Starting with the Direct Selection 
Tool for Graphics
Importing and manipulating graphics in InDesign is very similar to QuarkXPress.
As long as you remember to use the Direct Selection tool to select a graphic
rather than its frame, you and the InDesign graphics features will get along fine.
Paying Close Attention When Printing
InDesign and QuarkXPress offer many of the same output capabilities, such
as print styles (called print presets in InDesign), PDF export, color calibration,
and color separation support. But there are some notable differences beyond
the different organization of their Print dialog boxes. For example, InDesign
doesn’t have any options to change image contrast or line-screen element for
grayscale and black-and-white images, as QuarkXPress does. You need to
apply such effects in an image editor.

Chapter 26
Top Ten Must-Knows for
PageMaker Orphans
In This Chapter
 Transferring PageMaker files to InDesign
 Comparing how the two programs work
I
t’s official: PageMaker is now part of history, formally discontinued by
Adobe and lacking any updates since 1999. InDesign is Adobe’s new — and
only supported — publishing tool. So you’re making the switch. Yet you have
a lot of PageMaker still in your brain. This chapter helps you shift your
mental gears so that you can become an InDesign user.
Fortunately, Adobe has retained a lot of PageMaker’s approach in InDesign,
so you can mainly focus on what’s new rather than what’s different. The basic
methods for working with frames, lines, and pages are the same in both pro-
grams. What you get with InDesign is more control, with improved tools for
drawing, formatting text, and manipulating objects.
Open Those Old PageMaker Files
InDesign opens PageMaker files saved in versions 6.0, 6.5, and 7.0. If InDesign
sees any problems, it gives you an alert so you know what to fix in the con-
verted file. After the file opens, it is untitled. You need to give the file a new
name so that you don’t accidentally overwrite that original PageMaker file.
You Now Have Three Selection Tools
The basic selection, object-creation, and navigation tools in InDesign are sim-
ilar to those in PageMaker, but InDesign CS2 has three selection tools:

 Use the Selection tool to move or resize objects.
 Use the Direct Selection tool to reshape objects, change the endpoints of
lines, and work with objects in groups. The Direct Selection tool also works
like PageMaker’s Crop tool, letting you move graphics within a frame.
 Use the Position tool to do what you were used to doing with PageMaker’s
Crop tool. It duplicates some of the Selection tool’s functionality and some
of the Direct Selection tool’s functionality, so you might want to throw
away this PageMaker crutch and just use the two native InDesign tools.
Switching Your Shortcuts
InDesign uses many different keyboard shortcuts than PageMaker did, so be
aware of the differences. Table 26-1 highlights the main differences.

Setting Aside Time to Set Preferences
You have so many preferences options in InDesign that you may wonder
whether you’ll ever leave the Preferences dialog box after you start setting
them! Fortunately, you can set preferences at any time, so go ahead and start
working with InDesign as it comes out of the box and then update prefer-
ences as specific needs arise.
Working with Objects, Not Elements
As with other aspects of InDesign, when you work with objects, you gain
more than you lose. The types of objects (called elements in PageMaker) are
similar — text frames, graphics frames, and lines — but InDesign offers more
variations of them and more controls over their formatting.
Don’t Worry Much about Text Differences
InDesign gives you more control over text formatting, such as the ability to
stroke and fill characters in InDesign. Note that there are no type-style 
buttons — InDesign requires you to choose the appropriate version of a type-
face rather than apply bold and italic to the general typeface. Other type
styles are listed in the Character pane’s palette menu.
Don’t Worry Much about Graphics, Either
InDesign and PageMaker are very much alike when it comes to importing and
manipulating graphics. InDesign lets you click and drag graphics files into a
layout in addition to using the Place command (choose File➪Place or press
Ô+D or Ctrl+D), as well as create clipping paths and automatically scale
graphics or frames for you.
A Different Way to Change Pages
The one feature you’ll miss about PageMaker is those neat little page icons in
the lower-left corner of the document window. In shorter documents espe-
cially, the icons provided a quick, easy method for jumping to pages. Get
used to using the Page Number text field and arrows at the bottom of the
document window or the buttons at the bottom of the Pages pane instead.

Chapter 26: Top Ten Must-Knows for PageMaker Orphans

Creating Colors Is Different
Most of your work with colors happens through the Swatches pane (choose
Window➪Swatches or press F5) — not through the Colors pane as PageMaker
users might think. To share colors among documents, click and drag a col-
ored object into another document window.
Using the PageMaker Toolbar
In addition to adding the Position tool, which acts like PageMaker’s Crop tool,
InDesign CS2 also adds the PageMaker toolbar, which provides 31 iconic but-
tons (see Figure 26-1) to allow quick access to various operations. You open
and close this toolbar by choosing Window➪PageMaker Toolbar.
