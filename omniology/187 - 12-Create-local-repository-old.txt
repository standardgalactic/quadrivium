Create local repository 
 
First, mount your CentOS 7 installation DVD. For example, let us mount the installation media on /mnt 
directory. 
 
mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/ 
 
cd /mnt/Packages/ 
 
We need a package called “createrepo”  to create our local repository. So let us install it too. 
If you did a minimal CentOS installation, then you might need to install the following dependencies 
first: 
 
rpm -ivh libxml2-python-2.9.1-5.el7.x86_64.rpm  
 
rpm -ivh deltarpm-3.6-3.el7.x86_64.rpm  
 
rpm -ivh python-deltarpm-3.6-3.el7.x86_64.rpm 
 
Now install “createrepo” package: 
 
rpm -ivh createrepo-0.9.9-23.el7.noarch.rpm 
 
Build Local Repository 
It’s time to build our local repository. Create a storage directory to store all packages from CentOS 
DVD’s. 
 
mkdir /tmp/localrepo 
 
Now, copy all the files from CentOS DVD(s)  
 
cp -ar /mnt/Packages/*.* /tmp/localrepo 
 
Once you copied all the files, create a repository file called “localrepo.repo” under /etc/yum.repos.d/ 
directory and add the following lines into the file. You can name this file as per your liking: 
 
vi /etc/yum.repos.d/localrepo.repo 
 
 
Add the following lines: 
 
[localrepo] 
name=Unixmen Repository 
baseurl=file:///tmp/localrepo 

gpgcheck=0 
enabled=1 
 
Note: Use three slashes(///) in the baseurl. 
 
Now, start building local repository: 
 
createrepo -v /tmp/localrepo/ 
 
Now the repository building process will start. 
Now, list out the repositories using the following command: 
 
yum repolist 
 
Clean the Yum cache and update the repository lists: 
 
yum clean all 
 
yum update 
 
After creating the repository, disable or rename the existing repositories if you only want to install 
packages from the local repository itself. 
 
yum install --disablerepo="*" --enablerepo="localrepo" httpd
