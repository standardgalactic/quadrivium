Dedication
In the past, I’ve dedicated books to fans, friends, and even some family mem-
bers. In this third edition of Grant Writing For Dummies, I’d like to thank every-
one (and there are literally thousands upon thousands of you worldwide) who 
has made my For Dummies book a best-selling reference book. You are my sun-
shine, my inspiration to keep writing, and the reason that I constantly reinvent 
myself to keep up with the times and needs of readers and clients. With the 
dawn of the 21st century, grant writers have multiplied, and my online classes 
are constantly full. Yet, the reality of the economy can’t be avoided. Grant 
seeking and contract bidding takes skills and knowledge. The process is highly 
competitive and isn’t getting any easier. This book is for the fearful and for the 
bold. You can do it, and you can do it well! Winning a grant is a privilege — not 
a routine event. Show the world that you can use Grant Writing For Dummies, 
3rd Edition, to overcome the odds of rejection in grant seeking.
Acknowledgments
This book would not have been possible without the encouragement and sup-
port of my literary agent, Margot Maley Hutchison at Waterside Productions. 
I’m also still ever so grateful to Joan Hutchison, Margot’s mother-in-law. 
When I conceived the idea for the fi rst edition of Grant Writing For Dummies, 
it was Joan who helped me connect with Margot.
Next, I’d like to thank the dedicated professionals at Wiley Publishing, Inc., 
including my team: Tracy Boggier (my Acquisitions Editor), Stephen Clark 
(my Project Editor), and Jessica Smith (my Copy Editor). Belief and patience 
go a long way in today’s world, so thanks, Team Wiley! I’d also like to thank 
Donnae Dole, my technical reviewer. Together, this group guided my updat-
ing efforts from a mere table of contents to the most comprehensive and 
best-selling grant writing reference book to date.
Special thanks are also in order for my family. To John Browning, my loving 
husband of more than four decades, who at this moment has agreed to move 
again and downsize so I’ll have an even more inspirational living environment 
when I’m writing my projects and books. To my daughter, Lara Scott and her 
husband, Charles, for their love and faith when times got tough and uncer-
tain during the birth of their twin children. Yes, readers, I’m a grandmother 
now who has experienced joy and sadness at the same time. My grandson, 
Ashton William Scott, born on March 24, 2008, only got a glimpse of this 
world for less than fi ve hours. He is now our littlest, deeply loved angel. My 
granddaughter, Aaliyah Raine Scott, made her entry some fi ve weeks later 

as a micro-preemie and has proved to be tough, feisty, and very special. 
The passage of time has seasoned me as a human being, a grant writer, and 
an author. I’ve learned that we must take the sorrowful and joyful moments 
one at a time and hold our heads high to aim for the best that we can give to 
others. Don’t take anything for granted; learn to embrace each second and 
live it to the fullest.

Introduction
E
veryone is talking about getting a grant! From television infomercials 
to every Jane and John Doe on the streets, the curiosity factor is high. 
We’ve all heard the hype for years and yet there’s still a big mystery about 
what grants are and who can apply for them. Here’s your primer: The term 
grant is defined as a monetary gift or award. Or think of it as making some-
one’s dream come true with no strings attached. Grant writing is what you’re 
doing when you write a grant request, which is also known as a proposal for 
funding. In essence, you’re begging for something you or your organization 
needs really badly. The catch is that all the begging is done on paper, not 
in person. Some grantmaking agencies even consider funding requests from 
individuals for research and artistic-related projects.
I’ve been perfecting successful grant writing techniques for more than three 
decades. At the very beginning of my grantseeking efforts, I hit the funding 
jackpot! I thought anyone who wrote a grant proposal was funded. It wasn’t 
until I received my first rejection that I had a wake-up call about something 
called competitive writing. After a long bout of disbelief, I began analyzing 
my writing style, format, and content. I searched diligently for flaws or 
weaknesses. I took notes, and then I began to test new writing approaches. 
The results of my findings and my application of new writing approaches 
created a grant writing monster — me! I started writing with a frenzy to test 
my own tips and new skills. Everything I touched turned to funded grant or 
contract awards.
My experience of going back to the basics led to the first edition of Grant 
Writing For Dummies, and then it led to major rewriting for the second edi-
tion. Now I welcome you to this must-have, newly updated third edition of my 
bestselling desktop reference book for grantseekers.
About This Book
Grant Writing For Dummies, 3rd Edition, is arranged in a format that’s easy to 
read and understand. And you’ll have no trouble finding what you’re looking 
for because of the detailed table of contents and the lengthy doesn’t-overlook-
any-topic index. I think of the beginning and end of this book as detailed out-
lines. They’re solid and can be counted on when you need to find something 
quickly. However, obviously you shouldn’t overlook all the valuable and well-
organized resource information that comes in between the front and back.

2
Grant Writing For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
When you pick up Grant Writing For Dummies, 3rd Edition, you don’t find cut 
and dried — I need coffee to stay awake and read this — information. Instead, 
this book reaches the grant writing finish line way ahead of its competitors. 
I don’t hold back on sharing any of my knowledge. And I don’t treat writing 
winning grant applications and contract bid documents as “niche” or “insider 
secret” information. This book gives you the immediate advantage and 
knowledge of my nearly 35 years of experience writing grant proposals for 
my employers and working as a grant writing consultant. I even add some of 
Bev’s brand of humor to relax you and make the details go down a bit easier. 
Most importantly, my goal with this book is to help you win more and more 
grant awards in an increasingly competitive funding environment.
Conventions Used in This Book
To help you make your way through this book, I use the following conventions:
 
✓ Italic points out new words and defined terms.
 
✓ Boldface text highlights keywords in bulleted lists and the action part of 
numbered steps.
 
✓ Monofont is used for Web addresses.
When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have needed to break 
across two lines of text. If that happened, rest assured that I haven’t put in 
any extra characters (such as hyphens) to indicate the break. So, when using 
one of these Web addresses, just type in exactly what you see in this book, 
pretending as though the line break doesn’t exist.
What You’re Not to Read
The sidebars in this book are asides to the topic at hand, and so they aren’t 
critical to getting the hang of the grant writing process. However, they can be 
interesting and fun to read, so take some time to peruse them when you can.
Foolish Assumptions
As I was writing Grant Writing For Dummies, 3rd Edition, I assumed that it 
would serve as a desktop reference for:

3
 Introduction
 
✓ Individuals seeking research and education grant writing sources and 
approaches.

✓ Veteran grant writers seeking to increase their funding success rates.
 
✓ Business owners and contract bid staff who are perplexed at the entire 
business-to-business procurement process and are looking for detailed 
step-by-step information on how to compile a winning contract bid 
document.
In order to be successful at grant writing and contract bid preparation, you 
must possess good skills in listening, researching, writing, word processing, 
and critical thinking. Consider complementing your knowledge and skills with 
information from the following For Dummies titles:
 
✓ Fundraising For Dummies, 2nd Edition

How This Book Is Organized
Grant Writing For Dummies, 3rd Edition, is organized into six different parts, 
with chapters arranged to walk you through the process of planning for, orga-
nizing, writing, mailing, and following up on your grant request or contract 
bid document. The underlying message throughout this book’s chapters is 
creativity and tenacity — to always be fresh in your thinking and writing and 
to never, ever give up if your funding request or contract bid is rejected.
Part I: Finding Your Way 
with Grant Basics
Part I is all about the basics of grant writing. It answers your questions with 
enough detail to remove the mystery and reveal the secrets. The chapters in 
this part answer questions such as: What’s the difference between grants and 

4
Grant Writing For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
contracts? How do I get started with the planning process? What can I ask 
for? How do I find contract bidding opportunities? Why is bidding on a con-
tract so difficult? What kinds of money are the feds giving away? What do I 
write in a funding request? What do foundations and corporations give away, 
and how do I ask them for funding? How do I manage all this paperwork? 
What happens when I win a grant award? What’s a funding success rate? How 
do I talk and write in grantlish (in other words, grant jargon)? This part of the 
book shows you how to plan and carry out winning grant awards and con-
tract bids. So, get ready to roll up your sleeves and get started.
Part II: Identifying Key 
Grantmakers Worldwide
This part introduces you to worldwide grantmaking organizations, including 
government, foundation, and corporate grantmakers. I help you with every-
thing from checking out public funding epicenters, wading through Grants.
gov, and uncovering private sector funding nuggets to discovering interna-
tional grantseeking and finding grants for individuals and businesses. Part II 
shows you where to find the money, from right down the street in your home-
town to funders across the oceans. I cover it all.
Part III: Playing and Winning 
the Grants Game
In this part, I take you around the full circuit of the grants process by show-
ing you how to read a federal grant funding opportunity announcement. I also 
help you decide whether you’re ready to enter the grantseeking competition. 
You find out about the government peer review process and how to convince 
peer reviewers to rate your application with the maximum points. Part III also 
shows you how to practice powerful writing approaches, so you can success-
fully demonstrate a compelling need for grant funding. Gloom, doom, drama, 
and trauma all work on the reader’s heart and mind in your favor.
Part IV: Writing a Competitive 
Application Narrative
Every trade has its tricks, and grant writing is no different. So Part IV gives 
step-by-step guidance on how to prepare each section of your funding 
request, from the cover letter and abstract to each standard section of grant

 Introduction
proposals and contract bids. You no longer need to feel uncertain about 
spotlighting your organization or presenting your funding needs. Perhaps 
you’ve heard a lot of talk about writing an integrated program design; this 
part shows you how to demonstrate accountability by incorporating the 
Logic Model design. I wrap up this part with chapters on project staffing, 
resources, equity, and budgets. The chapters in this part are the solid foun-
dation of the book, and as such, I can assure you that you’ll use them over 
and over for every grant request or contract bid.
Part V: Reaching the Finish Line
In Part V, I lead you through the finish line when it comes to wrapping up 
your grant proposal or contract bid package. This part contains a helpful 
checklist to make sure you have everything pulled together, and I help you 
understand the importance of having a fresh pair of eyes proof and edit your 
work before submitting it. This part also addresses the electronic submission 
process and the steps to take after your grant is funded or your contract is 
awarded. At the end of this part, I give you a bonus: a glance at the Corporate 
Letter Request. After you become familiar with this short and to the point 
letter, you’ll quickly start receiving products, services, and cash from corpo-
rate grantmakers.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
This part of the book presents several collections of ten items; each list is 
grouped around a particular subject. Every tip in Part VI is intended to help 
you soar in every skill area related to grant and contract research and writing!

tion and examples I use are all designed to help you move forward success-
fully as a grant writer or contract bidder.
Start by perusing the new and improved table of contents, and then high-
light your favorite sections. This book isn’t linear — you can start reading 
anywhere and in any order you like. I suggest you begin with Chapter 1, an 
overview of this book’s tips and skills. Let the games begin!

Part I
Finding Your Way 
with Grant Basics

In this part . . .
W
ith the chapters in this part, you discover how to 
navigate your way through the sea of finding and 
getting some grant writing bucks. Finding the money is 
really the second step, however. The first step in grant 
writing is plotting the dollar trails (for example, determin-
ing who you’re going to ask for money, choosing how 
much you’ll ask for, and deciding how the funder’s criteria 
and grant amount fit with your own mission and vision).
After you complete your funder research and discover the 
art of grant speak, you can practice writing and talking 
with grant terminology.

hat makes a great grant writer or contract bidder? A person who’s 
hungry for cash flow and who’s willing to roll up her sleeves, dig deep 
for hard-to-find information, and speak boldly and proudly about her funding 
needs or contract capabilities. What does it take to get started? First and fore-
most, you simply need to learn from my knowledge and experience — which 
I share liberally in this book! Also, you should desire to make a difference in 
the lives of others. Whether it’s a grant-funded intervention or prevention or 
a contract bid award for delivering an excellent quality of goods or services, 
you should be ready to give your all.
By using this book daily, you can achieve your highest goals, which probably 
includes writing and winning almost everything you submit for funding or 
award consideration. You can even build your funding success rate to 90 per-
cent or higher. And, if you want further one-on-one training, consider enroll-
ing in one of my online classes or attending one of my two-day Grant Writing 
Boot Camps. For now, in this chapter, I start you down the right path to grant 
writing gold with the basics of the process.

Part I: Finding Your Way with Grant Basics 
Exploring the Grant and Contract Basics
Before diving into the wonderful world of grant writing, it’s important to 
understand a few essentials. For instance, it’s essential for new grantseekers 
to know exactly what a grant is. Also, you need to know who qualifies for a 
grant. Finally, being able to understand what funders want to fund is criti-
cal to crafting the right proposal for the right funder. I explain all of this and 
more in the following sections.
Discovering the definition of a grant
A grant, also known as a cooperative agreement, is a monetary award given by 
a grantor to a grantee. A grant request is an advance promise of what you or 
your organization (the grantee) proposes to do when the grantor fulfills your 
request for funding. The distinguishing factor between a grant and a coopera-
tive agreement is the degree of federal participation or involvement during 
the performance of the work activities. When a federal agency program offi-
cer participates in funded project activities, it’s called a cooperative agree-
ment. When the grant applicant is the sole implementer of project activities, 
it’s called a grant.
 
Some grant awards come with no strings attached, but many others require 
you to use the funds in a certain way. Grantors with strings attached to their 
monies are almost always government grantmaking agencies (local, state, and 
federal public sector funders). Grantors with literally no strings attached are 
referred to as private sector funders. These usually include corporate and foun-
dation grantmakers.
So what can a grant pay for? A grant award can be used for whatever the 
funder wants to fund. This means that reading the funding guidelines is criti-
cal when it comes to your chance for success. (Refer to Part II for tips on 
poring over funding guidelines from multiple types of grantmakers.)
Qualifying for a grant
A grant or cooperative agreement application is a written request that you use 
to ask for money from a government agency, a foundation, or a corporation. 
Most grants go to organizations that have applied to the Internal Revenue 
Service (IRS) for nonprofit status and have received the IRS’s blessing as a 
501 (c)(3) organization. However, a few grants are given to individuals as well 
(see Chapter 7 for details).

11
 Chapter 1: Grasping the Basics of Finding and Getting the Bucks
Since I’ve been writing grant applications, I’ve seen a growing number of 
grant awards made to cities, villages, townships, counties, and even state 
agencies. While none of these governmental units are IRS 501 (c)(3) desig-
nees, they’re still nonprofit in structure and can apply for and receive grant 
awards from the federal government, foundations, and corporations. Grant 
awards can even be made to international nonprofits, which are referred to 
as non-governmental organizations, or NGOs. You can read more about fund-
ing for NGOs in Chapter 8.
Looking at the simplicity of a proposal
A proposal is usually a more free-flowing grant request. A proposal involves 
you putting down on paper your ideas about your organization and the pro-
gram you want funded. You can dash off a proposal foolishly, simply writing 
what pops into your mind at the time. Or you can create a proposal the smart 
way, using a national or regional template format (see “Putting Together and 
Writing a Winning Request,” later in this chapter for more details). Grant pro-
posals (along with grant applications) require planning, organization, good 
research, and writing skills.
Getting the skinny on for-profit 
and nonprofit contracts
 
Think of contracts as cousins to grants — similar but clearly different. A 
contract is a legal instrument reflecting a relationship between the bid-letting 
agency (government unit or private sector business) and a business. The bid-
letting agency is seeking to purchase services or products from that business. 
The offeror, or business seeking to provide the deliverables, must respond 
to an RFP (Request For Proposal) or RFQ (Request For Quote) in writing and 
submit it by a deadline.
For-profit businesses apply for and receive contract awards, but nonprofit 
organizations usually don’t. Instead, they apply for and receive grant or 
cooperative agreement awards (which I explain earlier in this chapter). A 
grantmaking agency (such as the government, a foundation, or a corporation) 
can issue an RFP; a business seeking a contractual relationship with another 
business can issue one as well. An RFP or RFQ is very similar in format to a 
government grant application.

12
Part I: Finding Your Way with Grant Basics 
Planning Rules for the 
Present and the Future
 
Rule number one in grant writing is that you don’t ask for a grant without first 
completing a comprehensive planning process that involves your organization 
(the grant applicant) and its community partners (the stakeholders).
Without planning tools to lay out a visual road map of where your organiza-
tion needs to head and how it’s going to get there, you’ll be fighting the same 
fires daily — never becoming a relaxed and confident grantseeker or agency 
administrator. You fix this problem by creating a funding development plan, 
which is an internal examination of the organization’s strengths, weaknesses, 
opportunities, and threats. A funding development plan answers questions 
such as
 
✓ What programs are strong and already have regular funding to keep 
them going?
 
✓ What new programs need funding?
 
✓ What opportunities exist to find new funding partners?
 
✓ What existing grants will run out before new funding is found?
When you answer these questions, you can begin to look at the multitude of 
areas where grants are awarded and begin to prioritize the type of funding 
you need. I write more about funding development plans in Chapter 2.
Understanding How Funders Describe 
Their Grantmaking Interests
Every potential grant funding agency lists specific types of funding they will 
and will not award to potential grantseekers. In order to weed out the grants 
that won’t work for your organization, you have to understand the different 
types of funding that are available. The following list gives you the scoop:
 
✓ Annual campaigns: Money to support annual operating expenses, infra-
structure improvements, program expansion, and, in some cases, one-
time-only expenses (such as a cooling-system replacement).
 
✓ Building/renovation funds: Money to build a new facility or renovate an 
existing facility. These projects are often referred to as bricks-and-mortar 
projects. Building funds are the most difficult to secure; only a small per-
centage of foundations and corporations award grants for these types of 
projects.

13
 Chapter 1: Grasping the Basics of Finding and Getting the Bucks
 
✓ Capital support: Money for equipment, buildings, construction, and 
endowments. These types of large-scale projects aren’t quickly funded. 
It often takes two to three years for total funding to be secured. This 
type of request is a major undertaking by the applicant organization.
 
✓ Challenge monies: These funds act as leverage to secure additional 
grants from foundations and corporations. They’re awarded by funders 
and are contingent upon your raising additional grant funds from other 
funding sources. You must use internal organizational funds to meet the 
challenge grant requirements.
 
✓ Conferences/seminars: Money to cover the cost of attending, planning, 
and/or hosting conferences and seminars. Funding may be used to pay 
for all the conference expenses, including securing a keynote speaker, 
travel, printing, advertising, and facility expenses, such as meals.
 
✓ Consulting services: You may want to secure the expertise of a consul-
tant or consulting firm to strengthen some aspect of organizational pro-
gramming. For example, if you bring in a consultant to do a long-range 
strategic plan or to conduct training for a board of directors, you’re 
paying for consulting services.
 
✓ Continuing support/continuation grant: If you’ve already received a 
grant award from a funder, you can turn to that funder again and apply 
for continuing support. However, be aware that many funders only fund 
an organization one time.
 
✓ Employee matching gifts: Many employers match the monetary dona-
tions their employees make to nonprofit organizations, often on a ratio 
of 1:1 or 2:1. If you have board members employed by large corpora-
tions, have them check with their human resources departments to see 
whether their employers have such programs.
 
✓ Endowments: A source of long-term, permanent investment income 
to ensure the continuing presence and financial stability of your 
nonprofit organization. If your organization is always operating in 
crisis-management mode, one of your goals should be to develop an 
endowment fund for long-term viability.
 
✓ Fellowships: Money to support graduate and postgraduate students in 
specific fields. These funds are only awarded to institutions, never to 
individuals.
 
✓ General/operating expenses: Money for general budget line-item 
expenses. These funds may be used for salaries, fringe benefits, travel, 
consultants, utilities, equipment, and other expenses necessary to oper-
ate grant and contract-funded programs.
 
✓ Matching funds: Grant funds that are awarded with the requirement that 
you must find other grant funding that matches or exceeds the initial 
grant’s matching-fund stipulation. Matching funds are a type of leverage 
grant. To qualify for a matching funds grant award, the grant applicant 

14
Part I: Finding Your Way with Grant Basics 
must come up with matching funds. The funds can be internal (from 
the grant applicant organization), from a partner agency, or even from 
another grant funding agency.
 
✓ Program development: Funding to pay for expenses related to organiza-
tion growth, the expansion of existing programs, or the development of 
new programs.
 
✓ Research: Money to support medical and educational research. Monies 
are usually awarded to the institutions that employ the individuals con-
ducting the research.
 
✓ Scholarship funds: Scholarship awards to individuals. Remember that 
when funds are awarded directly to an individual, they’re considered 
taxable income (with taxes owed by the recipient).
 
✓ Seed money: Most often, these types of grants are awarded for a pilot 
program not yet in full-scale operation; hence the term seed money. Seed 
money gets a program underway, but other grant monies are needed to 
continue the program in its expansion phase.
 
✓ Technical (consulting) assistance: Money to improve your internal 
program operations. Often, this type of grant is awarded to hire an 
individual or firm that can provide the needed technical assistance. 
Alternatively, the funding foundation’s personnel may provide the tech-
nical assistance. For example, a program officer from a foundation may 
work on-site with the applicant organization to establish an endowment 
development fund and start a campaign for endowment monies. In some 
instances, the funding source identifies a third-party technical assis-
tance provider and pays the third party directly to assist the nonprofit 
organization.
If you need more help with grant writing terminology, check out Chapter 3, 
where I cover some “funder talk.”
Connecting with Contract 
Bidding Language
Grant application and contract bid documents have a lot of similarities, but 
there are still some specific contract bidding terms you need to know when 
you pick up an RFQ, or Request For Quote. (To find out more about grant 
application terms, see the earlier section “Understanding How Funders 
Describe Their Grantmaking Interests.”) Knowing the terms used by the 
bid-letting agency can help you write effective bid responses. The following 
terms are used by contract bid-letting agencies:

15
 Chapter 1: Grasping the Basics of Finding and Getting the Bucks
 
✓ Acceptance: Acceptance occurs when a bid-letting agency or business 
accepts the deliverables outlined by the offeror in the bidding document.
 
✓ Deliverables: Detailed information about the services or goods the off-
eror plans to deliver under a contract award.
 
✓ Financial proposal: A separate document outside of the contract bid 
response narrative that outlines the offeror’s cost to provide the needed 
services or goods.
 
✓ Offeror: The individual or business bidding on the needed services or 
goods.
 
✓ Responsiveness: When the bid-letting agency examines the offeror’s 
contract bid proposal document to determine whether all the areas in 
the narrative guidelines have been responded to and at what level.
 
✓ Request For Proposal (RFP) or Request For Quote (RFQ): A legally pre-
pared document issued by the bid-letting agency or business requesting 
a proposal or quote for services or products from qualified vendors.
 
✓ Services proposal: A full, written description by the offeror of what ser-
vices will be provided should a contract be awarded by the bid-letting 
agency.
 
✓ Terms and conditions: These are the circumstances for awarding a con-
tract. They’re developed by the bid-letting agency. You may be required 
to provide proof of liability insurance or to submit a list of demograph-
ics for all personnel assigned to the contract work.
Linking Your Needs to a Governmental 
Source of Funds
I probably receive more than 100 e-mails daily and just as many telephone 
queries weekly. Everyone wants grants! If you’re feeling clueless as to how 
to proceed finding potential funding for your organization, you simply need 
to use the Internet. You can search for potential sources that are interested 
in what your organization needs or business wants to provide in the way of 
goods and services. Fire up your computer, and then start searching for the 
monies that may be waiting for you or your organization. One of the largest 
grantmaking entities is the U.S. government, which is also known as Uncle 
Sam. If you want to score big in grant awards, start with Sam.
 
Conducting a funding search leads you to the money. But before you start 
your search, you need to know what type of grant money (or funder) will 
pay you to implement your idea, project, or program. I introduce you to your 
options in the following sections.

16
Part I: Finding Your Way with Grant Basics 
Federal government funding: Cashing 
in with your richest uncle
The first place to look for money is within Uncle Sam’s pockets. The federal 
government is a public funding epicenter. I’m not one to tout the availability 
of “free” federal grants, but I can tell you that the government does have 
money for specific types of grant applicants and projects. In Chapter 4, I give 
you the complete scoop on using the Internet to find government grants.
 
If you’re interested in looking at what the feds have to offer, take some time 
to look through the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA), which 
you can find at www.cfda.gov. The CFDA is the encyclopedia of grant and 
contract funding programs, so it doesn’t tell you about open grant competi-
tions that you can apply for at a particular time. For that information, go to 
www.grants.gov, which gives you daily funding announcements on money 
you can apply for now.
Heading to the statehouse: Seeking 
public funds closer to home
Each state receives grant monies from the feds and from tax revenues that are 
funneled into and out of their general funds. After taking their fair (or unfair) 
share for administrative overhead, states regrant the money to eligible agen-
cies and organizations in the form of competitive grants or formula grants.
Examples of some state agencies that regrant federal monies are agriculture, 
commerce, education, health, housing development, natural resources, and 
transportation. Contact your state legislator at his or her local office or at 
the state capitol for assistance in identifying grant opportunities within your 
state. Also consider using the Internet to search for state agencies that award 
grants and contracts.
The Other Pot of Gold: Considering 
Foundation and Corporate Funding
Foundation and corporate grantmakers are referred to as private-sector funders. 
The rainfall of private-sector grant money is conservative, but it’s also continu-
ously available to grantseekers who meet this type of funder’s area of interest.
Where can you find out more about these no-strings-attached grants? You 
can locate sources by visiting a Foundation Center Cooperating Collections 

17
 Chapter 1: Grasping the Basics of Finding and Getting the Bucks
site (usually at a state university library, community foundation, or other 
nonprofit information center). The Foundation Center’s Web address is www.
foundationcenter.org.
Examining private and public foundations
Private foundations get their monies from a single source, such as an indi-
vidual, a family, or a corporation. Think about all the wealthy individuals who 
have started their own foundations, like the John Templeton Foundation or 
the Heinz Foundation. You can find hundreds of private foundations in the 
Foundation Center’s online directory.
Public foundations, on the other hand, are supported primarily through dona-
tions from the general public. That’s a no-brainer, right? They also receive a 
great deal of their funding from foundation and corporate grants. Again, the 
Foundation Center’s Web site can give you loads of information on these types 
of foundations. There are lots of public foundations focused on the arts, envi-
ronment, and faith-based initiatives. Remember, there’s no difference in public 
or private foundations when it comes to grantseeking or grantmaking.
Finding corporate funders
Did you know that many of the biggest businesses in the nation set 5 percent 
or more of their profits aside for grants? Why is that, you ask? The buzzword 
of the millennium is corporate responsibility.
Corporate responsibility is the approach that a successful business takes 
when it decides to make a financial commitment to the community where its 
headquarters are located or where it has operating locations.
Corporations that award grants usually have a Web site link labeled commu-
nity, community relations, social responsibility, local initiatives, grants, or corpo-
rate giving. Use the Foundation Center’s Web site to view some corporations 
with giving programs, such as American Express (which also has a major 
foundation) and the United Parcel Service of America, Inc. (better known as 
simply UPS).
Accessing contract bidding opportunities
Many private and public sector businesses and public agencies seek out 
vendors to deliver services or goods to them. The type of document these 
business and agencies solicit competitive contract bids with is referred to by 
several different names, including Request For Bid (RFB), Request For Quote 
(RFQ), and Request for Proposal (RFP). If you’ve been searching your local 

18
Part I: Finding Your Way with Grant Basics 
newspapers and online for contract bidding opportunities to no avail, you 
need to move into high gear and aggressively subscribe to and screen pos-
sible contract bidding opportunities around the United States and beyond.
 
I have a subscription with www.findrfp.com, and I think it’s great. You can 
choose the types of bids you want to see (keyword subject area) and the geo-
graphic locations in which you want to sell your products or services. You can 
even receive daily e-mail alerts with current bidding opportunities. What’s the 
cost? The monthly subscription is probably around $30. That’s right, three 
ten-dollar bills per month gives you access to hundreds of thousands of dol-
lars worth of contract bids.
Putting Together and Writing 
a Winning Request
The first step in getting started with grant writing is to recognize the different 
application formats and when to use them. Some funders require more infor-
mation than others. In fact, some funders have reams of forms that you can 
quickly download, save in PDF file form, and open with ease if you have a PDF 
converter software attached to your word processing software. (I purchased 
my original converter software online from Nuance, and have since updated 
it to the most recent version, which you can find at www.scansoft.com.)
 
Determine the writing format for each funding source that you identify. Call or 
write each source and ask for its guidelines for submitting a grant application 
or proposal. Governmental agencies have their own application kits, and you 
can only submit applications for these agencies at certain times in the year. 
Foundations and corporations may also have their own formats. If not, you 
may be instructed to use a regional grant application format. Or you may be 
required to submit a two- or three-page letter of initial inquiry.
Just remember that if getting grant money were too easy, everyone would 
already have a grant and there wouldn’t be any money left for you! (I cover 
the entire process of successfully putting together a grant application in 
Chapters 12 to 17.)
Focusing on the (strict!) review criteria 
guidelines for government grants
The format for government grant requests varies from agency to agency, 
but some common threads exist in the highly detailed, structured, military-
like regimen that’s commonly referred to as an application package. These 
common threads include a standard cover, certification and assurances 

19
 Chapter 1: Grasping the Basics of Finding and Getting the Bucks
forms, narrative sections, and the budget narrative and forms. And of course, 
all types of government grant applications require mandatory attachments or 
appendixes, such as financial statements, résumés of project staff, and copies 
of your nonprofit status determination letter from the IRS. (Flip to Chapter 5 
for more about the application package.)
 
Always follow the pagination, order of information, and review criteria guide-
lines. All government grants are awarded on the basis of your meeting their 
review criteria, which are written and published in each funding agency’s 
grant application guidelines. The review criteria tell you what the peer review-
ers will read and rate when they receive your grant application.
 
As you read through the application guidelines, highlight all narrative writing 
requirements and look for sections that tell you how the grant reviewers will 
rate or evaluate each section of the narrative. By formatting and writing to 
meet the review criteria, you can edge out the competition and increase your 
funding success rate. In Chapters 9 and 10, I tell you how to prepare and write 
for the review criteria.
Lean, clean funding machines: 
Formatting for foundations
Large or small, foundations like to see a cover letter, a regionally or nation-
ally accepted cover sheet or cover form, and a narrative that includes a 
description of your organization and your request. The attachments are what 
count with this group of funders. They may ask for the project’s evaluation 
plan, your organization’s structure or administration, your finances, and 
other supporting material.
My favorite private sector (corporations and foundations) grant applica-
tion format is the one that was developed by the National Network of 
Grantmakers (NNG). The Network’s Web site is no longer active, so you have 
to search the Internet using a search engine in order to locate a download-
able version of the format. The grant application format, also known as the 
Common Grant Application (CGA), is accepted by many smaller corporate 
and foundation grantmakers. To determine whether using the CGA is appro-
priate in your situation, check the funder’s guidelines. Contact the funder 
directly to obtain the guidelines, or seek information in one of the many avail-
able funder directories.
The CGA format has a cover sheet, a two-section narrative, and multiple 
attachments. I use the CGA format for 90 percent of the foundation grant 
requests that I write. The format works well because it contains all the essen-
tials. Even if a funder requests a different order of information, you can do a 
lot of cutting and pasting from a grant application written in the CGA format 
to create a non-CGA grant request.

20
Part I: Finding Your Way with Grant Basics 
 
Before you start writing in a generic format (like the CGA format) check to see 
whether the region you operate in requires you to use a different format. The 
Forum of Regional Associations of Grantmakers, a national network of local 
leaders and organizations across the United States that support effective char-
itable giving, can be found on the Internet at www.givingforum.org. Most 
of the regional groups of foundation grantmakers you can find at this site have 
designed their own specific grant application formats.
Just get to the point! 
Contacting corporations
Corporations work with a shorter writing format than the one used by foun-
dation funders. However, corporate grantmakers that don’t have their own 
specific funding request application forms are usually very receptive to the 
Corporate Letter Request format. Chapter 21 shows you how to use this format 
to develop a short and effective letter to request goods, services, and even cash!
Sending Your Proposal on Its Merry Way
When you’ve finished writing your grant proposal, you still have a few 
more steps to take before you can breathe deeply and really relax. If the 
funding agency provides an application checklist, use it to make sure your 
grant application package is complete — in the funder’s eyes. If you don’t 
have a funder-provided checklist, create your own and check off each item 
requested in the grant guidelines. Make sure each section and form is in the 
order requested in the guidelines. Also, proofread your narrative and other 
forms several times before considering the application package final. Get 
help from a colleague or hire a professional proofreader, like I do. Check out 
Chapter 18 for more about wrapping up your funding request.
Keeping Track of Submitted Requests
After all your funding requests are in the mail, you need to develop a track-
ing system that will help you keep up with their progress and cue you when 
the period of silence from funders has been too long. At the federal and 
state levels, you can even enlist tracking support from your legislative team. 
However, at the corporate and foundation levels, you’re on your own (unless, 
of course, members of your board of directors have friends and associates on 
the funder’s board of trustees.)

21
 Chapter 1: Grasping the Basics of Finding and Getting the Bucks
The old school approach is to develop a manual or electronic tracking 
system to monitor what you’ve written, who has received it, and the status 
of your funding request (pending, funded, or rejected). However, the new 
and easier way to keep track of submitted requests is to purchase grant 
management or tracking software. Look for lots of popular software packages 
to meet your needs. You can find out what’s available by doing an Internet 
search using the term “grant management software.” Software programs may 
start at $1,000 and go up to several thousands of dollars.
 
When it comes to hard-copy organization, I use hanging files for each grant 
application I write. The hanging file holds individual file folders that contain 
the following:
 
✓ Application guidelines
 
✓ My copy of the final grant application package
 
✓ Background research
 
✓ Communication notes with funders, clients, and research sources
In Chapter 19, I give you guidelines for following up with government, founda-
tion, and corporate grant applications.
Knowing What to Do When You 
Win (Or Don’t Win) Funds
When you win, you celebrate, right? Well, yes, you celebrate, but you also 
notify your community partners of your collective success in winning a grant 
award. You also prepare for the implementation phase now that monies are 
on the way.
 
If your grant request or contract wasn’t awarded, you have some critical steps 
to take to determine why your request was denied and when you can resubmit 
your funding request or contract bid. Here are the steps to follow (also refer 
to Chapter 20 for more details):
 
1. Contact the funding agency or bid-letting agency and ask why your 
grant application wasn’t recommended for funding or why your con-
tract bid wasn’t selected.
 
 You may have to ask for this feedback in writing so the funders and bid-
letting agencies have a paper trail for whom they release information to 
and why.

22
Part I: Finding Your Way with Grant Basics 
 
2. When you know where the weakness is in your grant application or 
contract bid, develop a plan for rewriting.
 
 You want to rewrite the weak sections of your narrative and ready it for 
resubmission to other funders, other contract bid-letting agencies, and 
even for future resubmission to the same agencies or businesses that 
rejected the first request. For grants, funders usually allow you to reap-
ply in the next funding cycle (next year). For contracts, you have to wait 
until the bid-letting agency releases another RFP.

Chapter 2
Mapping Success with a Funding 
Development Plan
In This Chapter
▶ Developing a road map before your grantseeking trip begins
▶ Examining an example funding development plan
▶ Finding several funding sources to increase your success
F
ar too often, organizations that are in need of grant or contract monies 
become frantic and run down the grantseeking track with no real des-
tination in mind. They do this because getting new revenue is critical to 
program and organization survival. In this situation, the neon bait of a grant 
funding opportunity announcement beckons, causing all planning rationale to 
be tossed aside to begin the “Hey, here’s some money up for grabs! Let’s get 
this grant now!” chase.
What’s wrong with this picture? Simple: You need a map and a plan to success-
fully reach any destination. Quick decisions that weren’t properly thought out 
can lead to poor fiscal planning, program shutdowns, decreased staff morale, 
and eventually something known to grant professionals as grant suicide. Too 
much greed, too little planning, and ignorance regarding funding development 
plans and how they can help guide your organization to grantseeking and 
funding success are all signs that you’re heading in a downward spiral.
But don’t worry! This chapter shows you how to avoid grant suicide by guid-
ing you through the steps of proactive planning. The goal is to strengthen 
your approach to grantseeking. A stronger, more organized approach will 
help you hit the grant award target more often than the common driving-
while-blind approach.

24
Part I: Finding Your Way with Grant Basics 
Creating Funding Development Plans 
to Increase Grantseeking Success
An effective plan isn’t just about searching for and printing out a large stack 
of grant funding opportunities and then saying, “Well, let’s start working 24 
hours a day to apply for all of this ‘free’ money!” Instead, planning means 
developing a road map or written plan — called a funding development plan — 
that includes a systematic approach to grantseeking and grant writing. This 
type of planning can lead to funded programs that fit and support your organi-
zation’s mission.
Think about it this way: You would never approve the spending of $100,000 
to market your organization’s programs and services without a marketing 
plan. So why would you approach grantseeking and grant writing with your 
head in the sand? Exactly; you wouldn’t!
 
Planning takes time. And when you’re feeling the pressure of quickly gather-
ing funds, taking the time to plan can feel like a time waster. But, the truth is 
that careful planning can help you selectively shape better grants, which will 
increase your chances of success in the long run. The true time waster is pro-
ceeding without planning only to crash repeatedly into dead ends.
Knowing what a successful funding 
development plan looks like
Before you can begin creating a funding development plan, you have to 
know what you’re striving for. Here are some characteristics of an effective 
funding plan:
 
✓ It must be written down — just like a long-range strategic plan or a mar-
keting plan would be.
 
✓ It’s created to be a daily guide to help your organization make decisions 
about what programs have funding priority and about the most logical 
way to fund the programs.
 
✓ It must be updated with progress notes every time you apply for 
grant funding and every time you know the results of your efforts. For 
instance, first you need to note whether you’re being funded. If so, note 
the amount of the funding; if not plan to research why your efforts failed.
 
✓ It should be reviewed and revised annually. Why? Funder priorities 
change annually. For instance, just because a lot of money is available 
for juvenile justice projects this year doesn’t mean that this hot funding 
area will still be the focus next year.

25
 Chapter 2: Mapping Success with a Funding Development Plan
 
 Your plan must change to reflect what funders want to fund. In other 
words, your plan isn’t just about what your organization wants or needs; 
it’s about what funders want to fund within the parameters of your orga-
nization’s mission.
 
✓ It needs to provide certain bits of information, including the name of 
program or service in need of funding, the amount of monies needed 
to fund a 12-month operational cycle, and the potential source of grant 
funding for the program or service. After you’ve identified potential 
funders, you add the grant application due dates, the type of initial infor-
mation that the funder wants to see, and the name of the person who’s 
responsible for preparing the initial information document.
 
Keep your funding development plan flexible! Funder’s change their priorities 
often, and your target population’s needs are likely to change as well. So be 
willing to review previous evaluation reports or results from funded programs. 
Pay attention to what works and what doesn’t. Update by removing and 
adding programs and services, and then incorporate these changes into your 
revised funding development plan.
Starting the plan development process
You’ll likely develop your funding plan with your organization’s board of 
directors or with an executive committee (president, vice president, secre-
tary, and treasurer). Or you might develop the plan with the board’s desig-
nated funding committee (board members and program staff volunteer for 
this committee).
Typically funding committees aren’t short-term commitments. This type of 
committee meets forever and ever. Why? Your organization’s need for dollars 
never stops; grantseeking is a continual process. Think of a gerbil on a run-
ning wheel — it just keeps running and running after some unknown target. 
At least your funding committee will plan, plot, and then chase the known 
targets.
 
I used to suggest that organizations plan a retreat for the board of directors 
(or whoever is creating the plan) to jump-start the funding development 
plan development process. However, in today’s economy and with everyone 
working different days and hours, it just isn’t practical to think that funds or 
member availability will allow you to sneak off for a night or two. However, if 
you have the time and money, feel free to go the retreat route. Just know that 
you’ll get comparable results by simply finding a large room, closing the door, 
and cranking out your funding development plan. I recently helped a small 
nonprofit organization create a funding development plan in a board trea-
surer’s dining room. That plan is now being implemented. And to think that it 
took all of five hours on a Saturday morning!

26
Part I: Finding Your Way with Grant Basics 
No matter where you’re developing your funding development plan, you have 
to maintain everyone’s focus or else you could waste precious time. To do 
so, apply the following basic rules when you’re ready to start brainstorming 
and writing your plan:
 
✓ Make sure that everyone participates. Explain at the outset that every-
one needs to bring something to the table that will assist your organiza-
tion in identifying priorities for programs and services and finding ways 
to fund them. It’s important for administrators and front line staff to be 
strongly encouraged to participate in the funding plan’s development. 
After all, those at the top of the organization see programs and services 
in an entirely different light than the staff working with clients on a day-
to-day basis. Everyone’s opinion should be incorporated.
 
✓ Plan your meetings carefully so that you aren’t rushed through the 
process due to time constraints. Rushing through this process will only 
cause you to make mistakes and overlook important items. To avoid 
rushing, remember that the funding committee (or the group that’s 
convened to develop the funding plan) will likely need to meet at least 
four hours the first time and then for a couple of hours or more monthly 
thereafter.
 
 Poll every member to find out the best day and time for everyone to 
meet. Go with the majority rule theory. If 75 percent of the members 
can meet on Saturday from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. and 25 percent can’t, 
choose Saturday morning. And it’s perfectly fine to alternate the meet-
ing day and time every other meeting to accommodate the other 25 
percent. If you can’t alternate days and times, look for replacement 
committee members who can meet on the selected day and at the set 
meeting time.
 
✓ Give homework assignments. Most times, your meetings won’t give 
you enough time to finish all the tasks that need to be completed. To 
avoid falling behind, you need to assign funding research tasks to each 
funding committee member. Give the assignment, set a deadline, and 
express — with urgency — the need for each committee member to 
bring his or her completed assignment back on its due date. Using the 
homework approach enables the meetings to be kept short. Isn’t that 
every working person’s goal?
Structuring your plan
Too many nonprofit organizations function in crisis management mode all 
the time. They frantically write grant proposals to pay for programs and 
projects that are already in the 11th month of an existing one-year grant 
award. I often refer to this situation as working on the downside of funding 

27
 Chapter 2: Mapping Success with a Funding Development Plan
cessation. Everyone is always in a panic, and the threat of layoffs and pro-
gram closures is a routine fire call. Being proactive in grantseeking and grant 
writing is extremely important because it saves a group from always running 
in a reactive mode.
Laying out a funding development plan is the first step to becoming proactive. 
(You can read more about the benefits of a good funding plan earlier in this 
chapter.) The following list describes the parts of an all-purpose funding 
development plan (in the order in which they should appear):
 
1. Mission statement: Maybe your mission statement creates more confu-
sion than clarity. Take a long look at your existing mission statement 
and ask yourselves whether it reflects your vision. If not, figure out how 
you can rewrite the mission statement to make it clear and impactful.
 
2. Assessment of funding needs: Ask yourselves “What programs and 
services do we want to offer? Where is the funding coming from, internal 
or external sources?”
 
3. Funding goals: Ask yourselves “How much money do we need to raise 
from external funding sources for each program or service?”
 
4. Funding objectives: Ask yourselves “What benchmarks do we want to 
set to assure we reach our funding goals?”
 
5. Action plan: Ask yourselves “What are the annual tasks, over three to 
five years, that must be completed in order to make our funding devel-
opment plan a reality?”
 
6. Monitoring and evaluation of funding objectives: Ask yourselves “How 
can our organization track and prove that the project’s measurable 
objectives were met and at what levels? What are our evaluation tools?”
Check out the later section “Developing a Funding Development Plan in Six 
Steps” to find out more specifics on these parts of the funding development 
plan.
 
After you write your funding development plan, stick to it. Before writing 
any grant requests, first make sure that the grant fits into your plan. If you’re 
asked to pursue something outside your plan, meet with your administration 
and other stakeholders and explain that going after every available dollar and 
making off-track grant requests will come back to haunt you — and them. Be 
organized, stay focused, and follow your funding plan’s road map to success 
and stability.
For-profits also can benefit from creating a funding development plan. As a 
small business owner, I know that determining expenditures and identify-
ing how those expenses will be covered are key components in the funding 

28
Part I: Finding Your Way with Grant Basics 
development plan. Think about what new products and services you want to 
offer and where the funds will come from to launch your new endeavors. You 
can use the funding plan’s structure to capture the funding road map compo-
nents needed to carry out your plans.
Developing a Funding Development 
Plan in Six Steps
I find that it’s often easier to get a handle on something if I have an example 
to work off of. So with that in mind, I’ve put together an example of a fund-
ing development plan for a fictional organization that follows the structure 
outlined in the preceding section. Follow the example as you write your own 
funding development plan.
Step one: Creating or revising 
a mission statement
A mission statement tells funders your purpose or vision for being a struc-
tured nonprofit or for-profit organization. The mission statement should 
include the name of your organization, its structural status (nonprofit or 
for-profit), the year it was formed, and its purpose (reason for organization). 
Here’s an example mission statement for Frankenmuth Research Institute:
The Frankenmuth Research Institute is a 501 (c)(3) nonprofit private 
operating foundation that was organized in 2008 by the Frankenmuth 
Insurance Corporation for the purpose of conducting extensive research 
on the causes of increasingly high levels of insurance claims for infant car 
seat injuries.
Step two: Assessing funding needs
I firmly believe that a full organizational funding assessment is needed in 
order to help your organization get a clear and accurate picture of where it 
is now and where you want it to be annually for the next three to five years. 
You may wonder, “How can we even begin to organize the many areas of 
need within our organization?” Simple! Take a SWOT at it!

29
 Chapter 2: Mapping Success with a Funding Development Plan
 
A SWOT analysis is a popular organizational funding assessment tool to dis-
cover the good, the bad, and the ugly about an organization’s status. SWOT 
stands for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. A SWOT analysis 
looks at each of these elements and determines how each one affects the orga-
nization. This method of analysis is an effective tool for turning your agency 
inside out and seriously dealing with critical issues.
Instead of presenting a specific example of a SWOT in this section, I show 
you how to use the SWOT method to come up with your own assessment. 
After all, applied learning is the best way to learn this assessment tool. The 
following sections guide you through the kinds of questions you ask in SWOT 
analysis.
Strengths: Patting yourself on the back
This area of the assessment comes first because it bolsters your spirits and 
starts the planning brainstorming session on a positive note. Questions that 
identify your organization’s strengths as they relate to receiving funding may 
include the following:
 
✓ What are our financial strengths as an organization?
 
✓ What are some of our premier or stronger programs or services that 
have high visibility in our target area? List each program by name and 
include the numbers of clients served. Also make note of how the pro-
gram is currently funded (if it’s funded already). Remember: Don’t talk 
about insufficient funding in this section. Stay positive!
 
✓ Who’s writing our grants and how much does that arrangement cost? 
What’s the grantwriter’s success rate? In other words, what percentage 
of the grant applications that are written are funded? You should strive 
for a rate of 50 percent or higher.
 
✓ What funding sources can we count on to continue support for two or 
more years?
 
✓ Have our board members used their community connections to bring 
in funding from individuals, businesses, foundations, or government 
grants? If so, make a list of these connections and note when the con-
nected board members’ terms are over.
Weaknesses: Facing the hard truth
The weaknesses area of the assessment helps you objectively identify gaps 
in services or general grantseeking problems. Questions that identify your 
organization’s weaknesses as they relate to receiving funding may include the 
following:

30
Part I: Finding Your Way with Grant Basics 
 
✓ What are our financial weaknesses as an organization? If we have 
programs that are faltering, is that because of insufficient funding or 
because of shortfalls in the staff’s qualifications and abilities?
 
✓ Are we applying for every grant funding opportunity that fits our mission?
 
✓ Have we kept track of our past funding successes? Have we fulfilled our 
grant promises?
 
✓ Is our success rate for getting grant monies lower than 50 percent? What 
do we think are the causes of this low rate?
 
✓ Have we failed to cultivate one-on-one open communications with previ-
ous funders and are now unable to reapply for grant funding? If so, why 
has this happened and how can communications be reopened?
 
✓ Are board members using their connections in the community to help us 
identify individual, business, and government funding? If not, why?
Opportunities: Spotting open doors
The opportunities area of the assessment helps you identify possible 
opportunities that you may have missed thus far. Following are some 
questions you can ask to identify unexplored paths that may lead to 
future funding:
 
✓ Where are similar organizations getting their funding?
 
✓ Are there possible funders at the local, regional, state, or federal level 
who aren’t familiar with our program?
 
✓ Are we subscribing to newsletters (both hard copy and electronic) that 
keep us abreast of any changes that may affect our grantseeking?
Threats: Watching your back
The threats area of the assessment helps you identify any threats that could 
drastically alter your current funding structure. Use the following sample 
questions to guide your inquiry:
 
✓ What funding will be exhausted in the near future, and how will pro-
grams be impacted as a result?
 
✓ Who in our community has taken a negative public position against our 
agency? In other words, whose toes have we stepped on, and how will 
that impact our local funding?
 
✓ Are other organizations doing what we do but doing it better? Why? If 
other organizations are doing what we do, how are we different?

31
 Chapter 2: Mapping Success with a Funding Development Plan
Step three: Setting funding goals
After you’ve completed your assessment of funding needs, you’re ready to 
move on to articulating your goals. Your goals should be global and futuris-
tic; they should describe where you want to be when the grant money runs 
out. Here are some example goals from the Frankenmuth Research Institute:
Goal 1: Secure research grants to assist in fulfilling our mission statement.
Goal 2: Use the research findings to educate the general public (via a 
safety awareness video), specifically families with young children, about 
the importance of installing infant car seats properly and checking them 
repeatedly when seats are removed from and replaced back into the 
vehicle.
Step four: Determining funding objectives
 
Your goals can’t stand alone. You’ll never accomplish anything if your goals 
aren’t supported by objectives. Objectives act as benchmarks or reference 
points; they’re measurable steps that must be taken in order to achieve your 
goals. And every goal must have at least one objective. Here are the objectives 
of the Frankenmuth Research Institute:
Objective 1a: By the end of 2009, identify at least five national multiyear 
funders that will each commit to funding 50 percent of the annual industry 
research budget.
Objective 2a: By the end of 2010, secure 100 percent of the funding needed 
to develop a 10-minute public education and public service video on infant 
car seat installation and maintenance.
Objective 2b: By the end of 2012, reduce infant car seat–related fatalities by 
5 percent or more in the United States through public education and new 
car seat manufacturing technologies to warn parents when seats are not 
installed properly.
Note how the institute’s objectives relate to the goals listed in the previous 
section. Your objectives need to do the same.
Step five: Creating the action plan
In the action plan part of your organization’s funding development plan you 
need to take the funding committee’s research findings and sort them into 

32
Part I: Finding Your Way with Grant Basics 
categories of funding for each program or service that was identified as being 
in need of external funding or grant monies.
 
The action plan part of your funding plan shows you, your board, and the 
staff members where the money to support new or expanded programs and 
services will come from. All your research findings on external grant funding 
opportunities should be plotted in a working table created with your word 
processing software. Table 2-1 shows you an example of this type of funding 
development plan road map.

Step six: Monitoring and evaluating 
funding objectives
When you write a funding development plan, it’s important for the funding 
committee to discuss how your organization will track and evaluate your 
funding plan’s objectives. In this part of the funding development plan, make 
sure to mention who will conduct the monitoring and evaluation activities 
and who will see or review the evaluation findings or reports. Here’s an exam-
ple (using the Frankenmuth Research Institute) of how to word this section of 
your funding development plan:
The board of directors for the Frankenmuth Research Institute will be 
responsible for convening quarterly to review and monitor the funding 
development plan’s objectives. The principal investigator will prepare 
written reports on the funding activities for review by the committee. An 
evaluation report will be prepared for the full board of directors.

 Chapter 2: Mapping Success with a Funding Development Plan
Locating a Wide Range 
of Funding Sources
 
Moving from one funding source to many is a logical step in grantseeking. 
Preparing one grant application or proposal, mailing it to one funding source, 
and waiting who knows how long for the outcome is like taking the slow road 
to China. The best way to sustain a high funding success rate is to identify 
multiple funding sources for each project initiative in your funding develop-
ment plan. Then submit your grant proposals to all of them.
Is sending out multiple proposals allowed? Of course — it’s standard prac-
tice as long as you tell all the funders that you plan to approach other 
sources. Providing each proposal with a simple, one-page attachment 
labeled “Funding Sources Receiving This Request” is the most ethical way 
to inform all funders of your strategy. I provide an example of such a docu-
ment in Chapter 18, where I talk about grant proposal attachments. Some 
grant applications actually have a section for you to list other sources that 
you have approached.
In the sections that follow, I explain what you need to know to find a broad 
range of funding sources.
Digging deep to find sure funding
In order to identify as many potential funding sources as possible for your 
organization, you need to carefully research the three primary sources of 
funding: federal funding, foundations, and corporations. The following sec-
tions explain what to look for in each of these categories.
As you read information on each funder, you’ll see that not all funders 
(whether federal, foundation, or corporate) want to receive a grant proposal 
without any forewarning from you, the grant applicant. For many, you need 
to, in a sense, seek permission to submit a full grant request.
Review each funder’s initial approach preference to find what initial contact or 
approach document is required. You can find more information regarding these 
documents in the later section “Testing the waters with a letter of inquiry.”

Part I: Finding Your Way with Grant Basics 
 
When you’re juggling multiple funders, developing a work plan and plotting 
this information, as I’ve done in Table 2-2, is a good way to stay organized and 
on top of everything. (Make sure that the funder number listed on your table 
matches up with the correct grant proposal.)

Conducting a federal funding search
Keep your funding development plan within close reach when you start your 
funding search. You’ll likely find a lot of potential funding opportunities, and 
it’s wise to read the opportunity and then peruse the plan to make sure the 
opportunity fits.
 
You’re searching for perfect fits between what you need and what the funder 
wants to fund. Also keep in mind that many published funding opportunities 
found on the Internet will have expired. Focus on finding open or current grant 
funding opportunities first. Then it’s okay for you to print out expired notices 
and contact the grantmaking agency to see whether the funding will be avail-
able again in the future.

35
 Chapter 2: Mapping Success with a Funding Development Plan
Thankfully, the federal government aids your federal funding search with its 
one-stop grant opportunity information Web site, www.grants.gov. This 
site is the quickest way to conduct a federal funding search.
 
If you don’t have access to the Internet, you can do a hard-copy search 
for federal funding sources. To do so, you simply visit a public library that 
serves as a government publication depository and therefore maintains 
print versions of the Federal Register. The Federal Register is the official 
daily publication for rules, proposed rules, and notices of federal agencies 
and organizations as well as executive orders and other presidential docu-
ments. You can find grant opportunity announcements within these notices. 
However, do note that searching the hard copies has its drawbacks (it’s 
tedious and the info you find could be out of date). So, if you don’t have 
access to the Internet, consider using the computers at the library to connect 
to the government grant opportunity Web site. A research librarian will be 
glad to help you if you aren’t tech savvy.
After you’ve logged on to www.grants.gov, click on Find Grant Opportunities 
at the top of the site’s home page. Then click on Basic Search, and type your 
search terms in the Keyword Search field. Sample keywords include low-
income housing, research, health, after-school programs, museum, and library. 
Your search should produce a list of federal grant opportunity announcements 
that contain your keyword(s). Simply click on each one to read the announce-
ment and determine whether it fits your specific funding needs.
You may want to conduct an Internet search at this Web site on a weekly or 
monthly basis because the federal government releases new grant opportu-
nity announcements daily (except for on federal holidays).
Conducting a foundation or corporate funding search
When you’re ready to conduct a foundation or corporate funding search, 
the place to turn to is the Foundation Center. This center’s publications, 
CD-ROMS, and online databases provide grant seekers, grantmakers, 
researchers, policymakers, the media, and the general public with up-to-date 
information on grant funding and other nonprofit-related issues.
To conduct your search, you can either subscribe to the Foundation Center’s 
Online Foundation Directory (varying levels of subscriptions are available, 
beginning at as little as $19.95 per month). Or you can use the Center’s Web 
site to locate a library near you that has a subscription to FC-Search (the 
Foundation Center’s CD-ROM and by far its largest database with hundreds of 
thousands of foundation and corporate search entries). To learn more about 
FC-Search, visit the Foundation Center’s Web site at www.foundation
center.org.

36
Part I: Finding Your Way with Grant Basics 
When you start using the Foundation Center’s resources, you’ll see several 
information fields for entering your keywords. Keep it simple. If you’re look-
ing for money for homeless housing, in your first search, type in housing and 
screen the results. For the second search, type in homeless and again screen 
the results, eliminating duplicate funders found in the first search. I use this 
search approach, and it yields far more potential grant sources than typing 
in a search string made of two or more words. (See Chapter 6 for more about 
foundation and corporate grants.)
 
To find out more about researching foundation or corporate funding sources 
located outside the United States, visit Funder’s Online, the European 
Foundation Centre’s Web site, at www.fundersonline.org.
Testing the waters with a letter of inquiry
Many foundation funders state in their published guidelines that they prefer 
the initial approach (your first contact with the funder) to be a letter of 
inquiry rather than a full proposal. This letter allows the funder to make sure 
that what you’re requesting is in its area of interest and range of funding 
award. Nowadays, practically all foundation funders require a brief letter of 
inquiry since they’re overwhelmed with requests for funding.
The Foundation Center is one source for linking to foundation Web sites to 
view their funding guidelines. Another way is to use your favorite Internet 
search engine to locate the funder’s Web site.
 
Often, the published guidelines you find in hard copy funding directories at 
the public library’s reference department do not present the funder’s most 
current area of interest. I prefer to use the information found on their Web 
sites since it is the most current. Some foundation funders have online inquiry 
forms; others will request a letter of inquiry.
Starting out with a letter can save you time and effort, too. Even though rejec-
tions are still rejections, wouldn’t you rather be rejected after you write a 
letter than after you’ve slaved over a full-length application?
 
At the top of your letter of inquiry, be sure to type the words Letter of Inquiry 
(refer to Figure 2-1 for an example). It may seem obvious, but with all the 
paperwork that funders sort through, you’re helping them out (and maybe 
putting them in a better mood to read your stuff) if the first glance at your 
letter tells them what they’re getting.

LETTER OF INQUIRY 
 
Dr. R. J. Smoltz, Director 
Irving Industry Research Support Foundation 
12345 W. Northern Lights Way 
Buckeye, AZ 85326 
 
Dear Dr. Smoltz: 
 
I am writing on behalf of the Board of Trustees to introduce you to the Frankenmuth Research 
Institute, a 501 (c)(3) nonprofit private operating foundation that was organized in 2008 by the 
Frankenmuth Insurance Corporation for the purpose of conducting extensive research on the 
causes of increasingly high levels of insurance claims for infant car seat injuries. In the past five 
years, 7,650 infants across North America were either seriously injured or died from improperly 
installed car seats. In 2007, this number doubled (3,000) from the 2006 number of 1,500 infants 
injured or killed! As industry representatives, we are appalled and alarmed. These injuries and 
deaths are needless! 
 
The Institute critically needs your financial support ($250,000 project budget) in order to 
achieve our goal of producing and distributing a public education video to all media outlets and 
safety and prevention organizations throughout North America. It is our projection that given the 
troubling statistics and brief statements from families who have lost infants because of poorly 
installed infant car seats, that the Institute will achieve the following measurable objective: After 
one year of media saturation, the public education video will reduce infant car seat-related 
injuries by 50% or more and fatalities by 35% or more. 
 
As long as no actions are taken to publicize installation and maintenance instructions 
(prevention), infants will continue to die needlessly. Our research shows that no other highly 
effective interventions have ever been launched at the magnitude that the Institute is proposing. 
The Trustees are ready to work with the Institute staff to prepare a full grant proposal for the 
Irving Industry Research Support Foundation. We await your positive communication and thank 
you, in advance, for considering a long term financial partnership with the Institute. If, for 
whatever reason, you are unable to fund our project, we would greatly appreciate your assistance 
in opening the door and dialogue for the Institute with other potential research funders. 
 
With urgency, 
 
 
 
Dr. Theresa Mercy Hines, President & CEO – Board of Trustees

Part I: Finding Your Way with Grant Basics 
The suggested letter length is one page. Check out the following tips for writ-
ing a successful letter of inquiry:
 
✓ All requests for funding must be on grant applicant letterhead. This 
presentation gives the funder agency a clear visual affirmation of the 
applicant organization, its location, and how to contact the applicant in 
writing, by telephone, or by e-mail.
 
✓ Call the funder to verify the gender, name, title, and address of the con-
tact person. After all, to make a professional impression with the letter 
of inquiry, the contact person’s information must be correct.
 
 Verifying contact information is especially important when you’re con-
tacting a funder whose first name is gender ambiguous, such as Terry, 
Pat, or Kim. Find out whether that person is a Ms., Mrs., Mr., or Dr. 
Respect titles and use them to reach the right person, the first time!
 
✓ Introduce your organization in the first paragraph. Tell the funding 
agency who is sending the letter and why.
 
✓ Plant the seeds for your needs by sharing startling facts and statistics 
about the problem your organization seeks to address with grant funds.
 
✓ Extend an invitation for involvement by asking for the funding agency’s 
investment or partnership in your efforts to provide specific programs 
and services to the target population.
 
✓ Show the funder your plans by writing global goals that are futuristic yet 
tell what will change when the grant funds have been spent and are no 
longer available.
 
✓ Sell, tell, and ask directly for help. For instance, sell the funder on the 
problem or need that will be addressed with grant funds, tell the story in 
plain language, and ask for grant funding support.
 
✓ Mention early on the specific monetary amount needed; funders don’t 
have time to guess or hunt all over your request for the amount of 
money you’re requesting.
 
✓ Ask for technical assistance if the funder can’t fund your project. Some 
of the needs identified by your organization may not be monetary needs 
but rather instructional needs. For example, you might ask the funder 
to show you how to do a specific task, and then you can combine that 
knowledge with the resources that you have.
 
✓ Show hope in your closing by signing off with “Waiting to hear from you” 
or “Hopefully.”
 
✓ Make sure the CEO signs the letter of inquiry. This shows that the top 
administrator for your organization is aware of your request for grant 
funding.

 Chapter 2: Mapping Success with a Funding Development Plan
Receiving full grant invites 
from multiple funders
Imagine this scenario: You’ve sent out nearly 50 letters of inquiry and 25 of 
them result in potential funders who are interested in receiving a full grant 
proposal from your organization. What do you do now? Panic? Actually, no. 
It’s better to have lots of possible funding opportunities than none.
Not every funder who expresses an interest in receiving a full grant proposal 
will end up funding your organization. The odds are 1 in 5, which is why you 
need multiple funding sources for one program or project.
In today’s economy, the chances that your organization will receive more 
grant funds than it needs are slim. The competition is high and the funding 
pie only has so many slices. So spread your funding development plan net as 
far as you can by identifying dozens of potential funders and sending them 
letters of inquiry. Wait, have patience, and see what you catch with your bait. 
Follow up by providing any additional information requested or by prepar-
ing a full grant proposal (the funder will give you directions for what’s to be 
included in this document).

Chapter 3
Adding Winning Words to Your 
Request for Proposal
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding funder requirements
▶ Securing bidding opportunities
▶ Adding attachments to your funding request
E
very nonprofit funding source — from corporations and foundations 
to government agencies — issues guidelines on what and how to write 
your grant proposal. Even businesses issuing procurement documents issue 
instructions on who’s eligible to apply and what must be written in the 
submission document. Don’t worry. When you know how to cruise through 
technical instructions and translate a funder’s terms into doable tasks, you’re 
on your way to adding winning words to your funding request. Heads up for-
profit organizations: You can use this chapter as a tutorial for writing a win-
ning RFP (Request For Proposal) response as well.
Discovering What the Funders 
Are Talking About
Every set of guidelines issued by the funder has instructions telling you what 
it wants to see in a competitive funding request. While the order of appear-
ance for the sections can vary from funder to funder, they basically always 
ask for the following blocks of information, which I cover in this section:
 
✓ Information about your organization and its qualifications
 
✓ Information about the specific project for which you’re seeking funding
 
✓ A narrative about what you intend to do with the money if you receive it

42
Part I: Finding Your Way with Grant Basics 
As you read through each section of the RFP, you need to be sure that 
you understand how the funders define their terms. You need to consider 
whether there’s more than one way to interpret what they’re asking for. What 
do you do if you don’t understand what they really want? Well, call or e-mail 
them, of course! When in doubt, ask! When confused, ask!
Whether you’re a newcomer to grant writing or a veteran, funders are con-
stantly tweaking their writing requirements. It seems as if some funders try to 
reduce the number of incoming applications by causing confusion. Technical 
terms generally scare away most newcomers. So here I orient you to the stan-
dard “information is needed here” sections.
The type of RFP for services or products prepared by an agency looking for 
vendors can contain some of the same narrative sections as grant applica-
tions and cooperative agreements (which is another term for a grant).
Speaking of your organization 
and its qualifications
Any funding source you approach will have questions about your legal name 
and organizational structure. Although the wording may vary slightly from 
one application to another, the cover documents and narratives of grant 
applications and cooperative agreements all ask for the same basic informa-
tion. Understanding exactly what the application is asking for and knowing 
how to reply in the right language is critical.
 
Don’t hesitate to call the funding source for assistance if you have questions 
on any portion of the application. Asking a funder for help won’t hurt your 
chances of getting a grant. In fact, it may even help because you’re filling out 
forms in the best possible way.
Here’s the basic applicant information requested by funders:
 
✓ Legal name of the organization applying: Be sure to list your organiza-
tion’s legal name here. For charitable organizations, associations, and 
foundations, the legal name is the one that appears on the organization’s 
IRS 501 (c)(3) (charitable designation) or (c)(6) (association or mem-
bership designation) letter of nonprofit determination. For cities, town-
ships, villages, county units of government, and public schools, which 
have a different classification of nonprofit status, the legal name is the 
incorporated name.
 
✓ Type of applicant: Check the box that best describes your organiza-
tion’s forming structure. For example, you can choose from state 
agency, county, municipal, township, interstate, intermunicipal, special 

43
 Chapter 3: Adding Winning Words to Your Request for Proposal
district, independent school district, public college or university, Indian 
Tribe, individual, private, profit-making organization, and other (which 
you have to specify).
 
 Is your organization a type of applicant that isn’t eligible? Search for a 
partner (government agency or nonprofit) that can be the lead grant 
application or RFP responder. Doing so will get dollars into the front 
door of your organization or business because you’ll be incorporated 
into the funding request as a subcontracting partner. So get ready to 
negotiate your services and products during the planning and writing 
period. That way you’ll have monies earmarked for you in the funding 
request’s budget narrative and detail.
 
 If an organization is waiting on nonprofit designation, it’s common to 
partner with an established nonprofit to act as the fiscal agent. (An estab-
lished nonprofit is one that has been around for more than three years.)
 
✓ Year founded: Enter the year that your organization incorporated or 
was created.
 
✓ Current operating budget: Supply the applicant organization’s operat-
ing budget total for the current fiscal year.
 
 When it comes to money, supply information that portrays the truth and 
nothing but the truth!
 
✓ Employer identification number and DUNS Number: This portion of 
the form asks for the seven-digit EIN (employer identification number) 
assigned to your organization by the Internal Revenue Service. The EIN 
is also called a taxpayer reporting number.
 
 In addition to the EIN, federal grantmaking agencies require that all 
grant applicants have a nine-digit DUNS Number, an identification 
number that makes it easier for others to recognize and learn about 
your organization. You can register for a unique DUNS Number at the 
Dunn & Bradstreet Web site, www.dnb.com/US/duns_update.
 
 The DUNS Number is a unique nine-digit identification sequence that 
provides unique identifiers of single business entities while linking cor-
porate family structures together.
 
✓ Organization’s fiscal year: Indicate the 12-month time frame that your 
organization considers to be its operating, or fiscal, year. The fiscal year 
is defined by the organization’s bylaws and can correspond with the cal-
endar year or some other period, such as July 1 to June 30.
 
✓ Congressional districts: On a federal grant application, you need to list 
all the congressional districts in which your organization is located and 
your grant-funded services will be implemented. You can get this infor-
mation by calling the public library or surfing the Internet to locate your 
legislator’s Web site — which will contain their district numbers.

44
Part I: Finding Your Way with Grant Basics 
 
 Knowing and developing ties with representatives in Washington and at 
your state capitol is critical. You always need friends in high places. (See 
Chapter 4 for more about connecting to government officials.)
 
✓ Contact person information: Name the primary contact in your organi-
zation for grant or cooperative agreement negotiations, questions, and 
written correspondence.
 
 Make your contact person an individual who helped write the grant and 
who’s quick enough on his or her feet to answer tough technical ques-
tions from the funder, especially by phone.
 
✓ Address: Provide the current street and/or mailing address for the appli-
cant organization.
 
✓ Telephone/fax/e-mail information: List the contact person’s telephone 
and fax numbers (with area code) as well as an e-mail address.
Filling in project-specific blanks with style
 
Filling in all the blanks on grant application and cooperative agreement cover 
forms and budget forms is critical! Leaving any field related to applicant 
agency and project details blank makes you look nonresponsive, and this 
alone could stop a reviewer from reading any further into your document.
The following sections highlight the blanks you should pay particular atten-
tion to so the reviewer doesn’t lose interest in your organization.
Creating a project name
List your project name on the cover letter, the cover form, and any other 
funder-requested documents. People have names. Pets have names. Projects 
for which you’re seeking grant funding must have names, too. (And includ-
ing your project name on all documents ensures that the paperwork can be 
easily identified and pulled back together if anything gets separated.)
 
Project names should be memorable, but stay away from long project names. 
Here’s a great example for a project name: Project ACCESS. What does it stand 
for? Nothing, it isn’t an acronym. This project name could be used for an 
employment and training program that’s accessible to underserved popula-
tions or for a program to help senior citizens connect to affordable medical 
care. Whatever you do, use your imagination and don’t use a name that trans-
lates into an offensive abbreviation or acronym.
Summarizing your organization’s mission
When funders ask for your organization’s mission statement, they want to 
see one sentence that conveys your mission statement. In other words, a mis-
sion statement isn’t a paragraph or a preamble. It’s the vision-driving string 
of words that tells the world your organization’s purpose.

45
 Chapter 3: Adding Winning Words to Your Request for Proposal
Writing about the purpose of the request
Compose a short, one-sentence statement about how you plan to use the 
requested funds. All types of grant applications and cooperative agreements 
require this information to appear on the cover form.
Giving dates for the project
Provide the proposed starting and ending dates of the project. You don’t 
have to figure exact days, just express the project dates according to month 
and year.
Stating the amount requested
Enter the exact amount (round off to the nearest dollar) you’re requesting 
from the funder. Tip: Do your homework by reading the funder’s instruc-
tions — they will usually contain a funding range or maximum grant award 
amount number.
Including the total project cost
Include the total cost of the proposed project. Double- and triple-check to 
make sure that the number you enter here matches the total cost of the proj-
ect listed in the budget narrative and on the budget forms. (For more about 
budgets, check out Chapter 17.)
Stating the geographic area served
Describe the location of your project in this order: city, county, state. Some 
funding is designated for specific states, and some funders even select indi-
vidual counties within a state for funding projects.
Adding signatures
Most federal government applications are submitted online now, so you’ll be 
typing your initials or the initials of the authorized contact person for your 
organization into a signature field box.
Telling your story using the right lingo
In order to receive a grant or cooperative agreement award, you must write 
a concise story explaining why funds are needed and how they will be 
expended. This story makes up the narrative, which is divided into several 
sections. The chapters in Part IV show you how to pull together a winning 
narrative for grant applications or cooperative agreements. Here I’ve listed 
the sections in the order that they will most likely appear in the funding 
request guidelines:
 
✓ Introduction to/background of the organization: Write about your orga-
nization, when it was founded, its purpose, its mission, and its location.

46
Part I: Finding Your Way with Grant Basics 
 
✓ History and major accomplishments: Write about who founded your 
organization, why it was founded, and major achievements since its 
founding. Only write about events and accolades that are relevant to the 
project for which you’re requesting grant funds. Otherwise, the funder 
will become distracted when coming across non-relevant trivia.
 
✓ Current programs and activities: Write about the current initiatives that 
your organization is involved in. List the programs and activities cur-
rently taking place at your organization.
 
✓ Description/demographics of your constituency: Write about the popu-
lation that your organization provides services to. Include age range, 
gender, ethnicity, economic status, educational level, and other char-
acteristic descriptors. It’s important for the funder to know whom you 
serve and what’s special about your target population.
 
✓ Description of community: Write about your community’s makeup. 
Describe the community by providing a combination of city and county 
information.
 
 Cite your sources and don’t use statistics that are more than five years old.
 
✓ Description of work with local groups: Write about other organizations 
in your community with which you work, plan events, share end-users, 
and have affiliations. You probably call these groups partners.
 
✓ Proposed initiative: Write about what you plan to do with the grant or 
cooperative agreement monies. State your intentions simply and directly 
in one or two sentences. For example, you may write something like 
“The purpose of this request is to. . . .”
 
✓ Problem statement/statement of need: Write about the problem you 
will combat with the awarded funds. State the truth about your need, 
but use compelling words to relay the gloom, doom, drama, and trauma 
of your situation and why your organization needs the requested funds.
 
✓ Program design/plan of action: Write about the process you’ll implement 
to solve the problem or need. Incorporate proven intervention/prevention 
or other types of national models (find these on the Internet).
 
✓ Goals: In direct terms, write about what funding support will accom-
plish for your organization and the target population. Goals are global, 
visionary statements that create moments of awe for the writer and the 
reader. (Check out Chapter 15 for more information on goals.)
 
✓ SMART objectives: Write benchmarks for your target population or pro-
gram that are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Time bound.
 
✓ Activities/strategies: Write about the activities, tasks, or strategies that 
you’ll implement to reach your goals.
 
✓ Timeline: Incorporate target dates for your objectives and activities/
strategies. Note when the objectives will happen and the activities will 
start and end. A timeline presented in a table looks great to readers.

47
 Chapter 3: Adding Winning Words to Your Request for Proposal
 
✓ Impact on problem: Write about how your proposed action will reduce 
the problems discussed in the problem statement/statement of need.
 
✓ Project significance: Write about the impact the project will have on the 
target population from a global perspective.
 
✓ Systemic change: Write about how the program you plan to develop 
with funding support will positively change society or rigid and anti-
quated systems.
 
✓ Key personnel/staffing: Write about the staffing needed to carry out the 
program or project. For each staff person, indicate what percentage of 
his or her time will be allocated to the project and from which budget 
(cash match, in-kind, or requested) his or her salary will come from.
 
✓ Management plan/organizational structure/administration: Write 
about who will report to whom and where the built-in assurances of 
administrative and financial responsibility will be established.
 
✓ Adequacy of resources: Write about any financial, physical, and person-
nel resources your organization already owns or has access to that can 
be used for program activities.
 
✓ Equitable access/nondiscriminatory policies for hiring new personnel: 
Write about how your program will guarantee access to underrepre-
sented groups, including the physically challenged. Include your organi-
zation’s nondiscrimination policy.
 
✓ Performance evaluation plan: Write about who will conduct the perfor-
mance evaluation, what it will cover, and the time frame for evaluation 
activities. Keep in mind that the collection of frequent and unbiased 
feedback from members of the grant’s target population is critical to an 
accurate performance evaluation.
 
✓ Dissemination of evaluation findings: Write about who will receive a 
copy of the evaluation findings. Dissemination of evaluation materials 
are important for reporting to current funders and can sway future fund-
ing sources when you attach them to grant applications and cooperative 
agreements.
Searching For and Winning 
Bidding Opportunities
Looking for bidding opportunities for your for-profit business? Well, you’re 
in luck. Companies and government agencies release thousands of Requests 
For Proposals (RFPs), Requests for Bids (RFBs), and Requests for Quotes 
(RFQs) daily.

48
Part I: Finding Your Way with Grant Basics 
 
Bid opportunities are usually announced in the legal section of daily newspa-
pers or in legal news publications. There are also nearly a dozen subscription-
based Web sites that provide daily contract bidding opportunity e-mail alerts. 
When using a search engine to look for RFP alert services, enter this search 
string: RFP alerts.
Reviewing special sections of an RFP
When you find a bidding opportunity, you must be fluent in contract bid or 
proposal language (see the preceding sections for the basics of generic lan-
guage found in most RFPs). You also must be able to quickly research and 
write your bid response to meet the deadline.
RFPs consist of two parts: a services proposal (scope of services) and a cost 
proposal. I explain both in the following sections.
 
Procurement staff at bid-letting agencies often read the services proposals 
first, and then they rate them based on compliance with the RFP instructions. 
Then, the cost proposals are reviewed and likely arranged from the lowest bid 
to the highest bid. A business or offeror scoring high on both its service and 
cost proposals has a high chance of being awarded a contract.
Services proposal
The services proposal breaks down into two sections: the experience/
expertise/reliability section and the method of performance section. In 
the experience/expertise/reliability section, you tell the procurement staff 
about the offeror’s (your organization’s) experience and expertise. You 
present work references and examples of the type of work previously per-
formed by your organization. You also list any current grant, cooperative 
agreement, or contract awards. (See Chapter 13 for more details on how to 
write this section.) In the method of performance section, you tell the pro-
curement staff how your organization will perform the services or deliver 
the goods requested in the bid document. Refer to Chapter 15 to see how 
to write the accountability and program design paragraphs in the services 
proposal.
Cost proposal
For the cost proposal, you’re instructed to either include the budget detail 
with the main components of the bid response or package it separately from 
the narrative sections (outlined in the section “Telling your story using the 
right lingo,” earlier in this chapter). Often, the bid-letting agency requests 
that the cost proposal be sealed in an envelope separately from the services 
proposal. (Check out Chapter 17 for more budget-related information.)

49
 Chapter 3: Adding Winning Words to Your Request for Proposal
Checking and double-checking details
The number-one strategy in winning contract bidding opportunities is to 
always comply with every requirement. Read the entire bid request docu-
ment. Then go through it a second time and highlight all technical require-
ments, including font size, line spacing, page count, and so forth. Something 
as minor as the wrong font size can cause your bid response to be disquali-
fied for contract consideration. (Jump to Chapter 18 for more on reviewing 
your completed response.)
 
When you submit a bid response, don’t make the procurement staff decipher 
the industry terms or company jargon you use. Place a list of bid response 
definitions immediately after the table of contents.
Wrapping Up Your Funding 
Request with Attachments
Additional information about your organization, in the form of attachments, 
follows the grant, cooperative agreement, or RFP narrative. Some of the 
things you’ll likely attach to your grant are outlined in the following list. Keep 
in mind that each funder has its own instructions on how to order these 
attachments, so there’s no standard order of information.
 
✓ Budget summary/cost summary: Fill in the blanks on a standard work-
sheet listing line items and expense amounts, as required by the grant 
guidelines or directions. (Flip to Chapter 17 for more about budgets and 
financial stuff.)
 
✓ Budget detail/budget narrative/cost justification: Write a detailed nar-
rative on each proposed expense.
 
✓ Up-to-date financial statement: Attach a copy of your most recent finan-
cial statement. Whether audited or unaudited, the financial statement 
should explain any findings of concern.
 
✓ Proof of tax-exempt status (if applicable): Proof is a copy of your orga-
nization’s 501 (c)(3) letter of nonprofit determination from the Internal 
Revenue Service, with the date on which a certifying agency recognized 
the status.
 
✓ Board of directors with affiliations: This attachment lists the names 
and community and board positions of the organization’s governing 
body (board of directors, city council members, village trustees, and 
so on). This document also should mention the lengths of their board 
terms and amounts of time remaining to be served.

50
Part I: Finding Your Way with Grant Basics 
 
✓ Letters of commitment: Ask for letters of commitment from affiliates 
early in the writing process, and include at least three such letters with 
all grant applications you send out.
 
✓ Annual report: Include an annual report (brochure, booklet, or newslet-
ter) as an attachment to your grant applications.
 
✓ Recent print reviews: Attach letter-size photocopies of project-related 
newspaper articles about your organization. Make sure the publication 
date and name of the newspaper or magazine appear with the article.
 
✓ Other documentation: Submit one-page summaries or complete résu-
més of key program personnel, as the funding source prefers. Also, if 
your organization has Memorandums of Agreement or Memorandums of 
Understanding signed by partner or collaborating agencies, attach these 
documents last. (Flip to Chapter 9 for more information on these types 
of documents.)
 
If the funding source’s guidelines indicate that no attachments will be 
accepted or that any material besides the grant application will be cause for 
nonreview, omit any of the standard attachments covered in this list.

Identifying Key 
Grantmakers 
Worldwide

In this part . . .
T
his part focuses on researching and qualifying key 
grantmakers worldwide, including corporations, foun-
dations, and government grantmaking agencies. When 
writing this part, I thought about all the questions I had 
when I was first starting out in the grant writing field. I 
answer a ton of questions you will likely have, such as: 
What government agencies award grants? How do I read a 
grant funding opportunity announcement? What’s up with 
foundation and corporate grantmakers? Are there really 
grants for individuals? Are there any legitimate grants for 
businesses? What about grants for NGOs (nonprofits that 
are located outside the United States)?

▶ Finding money in state agencies

▶ Using the CFDA and Grants.gov to find federal dollars
▶ Discovering how to take your best shot at federal grants
E
very time there’s an infomercial on television taunting me about “free 
government grant monies,” I’m breathless with frustration. Why? The 
actors never talk about how to find government grant monies on your own. 
Instead, they insist that you send them money for their report, which prob-
ably contains publically available information.
So, you probably have questions. Where do you start to find this information 
on your own? And how does money move down from our nation’s capitol 
into your state? Is government grant money really a secret? It’s time to bring 
you up to speed on all types of government grant funding opportunities and 
how to determine whether your organization or business should move for-
ward with a grant application or cooperative agreement.
This chapter shows you where and how to look for government grant and 
cooperative agreement programs, especially federal ones. Remember that 
grants and cooperative agreements are the same thing, but they’re given dif-
ferent names by different agencies.

Part II: Identifying Key Grantmakers Worldwide 
Where’s the Money in My State? 
Calling the State Agencies
Washington, DC, is a funding epicenter. All the country’s money seems to 
flow toward the capitol, and then Congress votes to send it back to the state-
level government agencies in one of three forms:
 
✓ Formula: This money is paid based on a preset head count formula.
 
✓ Entitlement: State agencies get these monies because federal legislation 
entitles them to receive it every fiscal year.
 
✓ Competitive grant or cooperative agreement awards: The state with 
the best grant applications wins this money.
Some states post all of the state funding and refunding announcement 
links on one Web page. However, most don’t. So you have to be a really 
great Internet detective to find the monies in your state (not to mention in 
Washington). You need to surf a bit each day to catch all the new postings for 
grant funding opportunities.
 
State grants usually award less money and require just as much paperwork 
as federal grants. But the odds of winning a grant are better at the state level 
than at the federal level. The main reason you face better odds is that fewer 
grant applicants are competing for the state-level monies.
To find grant opportunities at the state level, you should:
 
✓ Visit your state government’s Web site. Use a search engine, such as 
Yahoo! or Google, if you need help locating the address. If you search 
the site and can’t find a listing of all the state’s grant opportunities, call 
the governor’s office and ask to be directed to the various agencies that 
give grants.
 
✓ E-mail or call each state agency responsible for carrying out legislative 
funding mandates that are relevant to your own funding needs, and be 
sure to get on its mailing list for grant funding opportunity alerts.
When you receive a state grant funding opportunity alert that you’re inter-
ested in applying for, look for the Web site link that connects you to the grant 
application summary and download option. Download the complete grant 
application (including guidelines) and look for the following information:
 
✓ Type of application: For example, the application may be a hard-copy 
typed submission or an online electronic submission.

55
 Chapter 4: Checking Out Public Funding Epicenters
 
✓ Due date: Make sure the due date is manageable and gives you enough 
time to collect topic-related information and write the application.
 
✓ Who’s eligible to apply: Every grant competition has a section listing 
the types of grant applicants that are eligible to apply for funds. If your 
organization’s forming structure (local education agency, nonprofit, and 
so forth) isn’t listed, consider partnering with an eligible applicant.
 
✓ The number of grants to be awarded: You may have to call the funding 
agency’s contact person to find out the number of available grants; this 
information often isn’t included in state grant application guidelines.
 
I think that all grant applicants have a fair chance of winning a state agency 
grant award. I always ask about the number of grants to be awarded so I 
know how many ways the money will be divided. That information helps me 
develop a more competitive project budget — staying conservative and on 
the low end of the average grant range. See Chapter 17 for information on 
how to put together a winning budget section in your grant or cooperative 
agreement proposal.
Classifying Types of Federal Grants
Federal grant monies come in two forms:
 
✓ Direct grants: With direct grants, you apply directly to the federal 
government.
 
✓ Pass-through grants: With pass-through grants, your state applies to 
the federal government for a grant. After receiving the grant, the state 
then passes the federal monies on to applicants. (Remember that pass-
through monies are still considered federal monies even though they’re 
distributed by state agencies.)
Now here’s where it gets complicated: Whether in the form of direct or 
pass-through grants, federal monies are also classified as either competitive 
or formula.
In the following sections, I give you the scoop on the pros and cons of direct 
and pass-through grants, and I discuss the details you need to know about 
competitive and formula grants.
The encyclopedia of federal grants is the Catalog of Federal and Domestic 
Assistance. This encyclopedia is a directory of all grantmaking programs at 
the 26 grantmaking agencies. If you’re a veteran grant writer, you know that 
all grant seekers used to depend on the newsprint-type daily publication 

56
Part II: Identifying Key Grantmakers Worldwide 
called the Federal Register. The days of thumbing through dozens of irrel-
evant pages with federal announcements (not just grant funding opportuni-
ties) are over! Now if you want to surf federal grant funding opportunities, 
you simply point your Internet browser to www.grants.gov. (Refer to 
Chapter 5 for a detailed guide to navigating this site.) Yes, I have embraced 
technology!
The pros and cons of direct grants
The advantages to applying for a direct grant award, which comes straight 
from the federal government, include the following:
 
✓ Direct grants have no middlemen and no extra layers of red tape. You 
apply directly to the feds for a grant in response to their announcement 
of the availability of funds.
 
✓ When you compete for a direct grant, you communicate directly with 
a program officer in a division of a federal agency. This means one-
on-one attention. So be sure to review the application guidelines thor-
oughly, and then compile all your questions. You can e-mail or call the 
grantmaking agency’s contact person for clarification and answers. Do 
this upfront so you can clear the way for the topic research and grant or 
cooperative agreement writing process.
 
 Avoid being a nuisance! Don’t call and make small talk. Have your 
questions ready before approaching the agency contact, and ask if 
the individual prefers to have questions e-mailed. Be prepared to take 
copious notes. If you feel you still lack a clear answer on how to pro-
ceed, ask again.
 
The one major disadvantage to applying for a direct grant award is that 
they’re tough to win. You compete with other grant applicants from the 
50 states and all the U.S. territories. If the feds are only planning to award 
money to five grant applicants, your chances are slim — even with an award-
winning funding request.
 
In fact, you may even be competing with state agencies, which further nar-
rows your chances. Urban and rural poverty pockets receive first priority for 
most social program funding, such as housing, education, health and human 
services, and other grantmaking areas earmarked for social issue hot spots. If 
you aren’t proposing services in one of these high-needs geographic funding 
areas, your chances of winning a federal grant from a competition that gives 
5 to 25 extra review points to high needs, census data–supported geographic 
areas are reduced to almost nothing.

57
 Chapter 4: Checking Out Public Funding Epicenters
The pros and cons of pass-through grants
The two advantages to applying for pass-through grant funds, which are first 
won from the federal government by states and are then passed on to indi-
vidual organizations, are:
 
✓ When you apply for pass-through grant funds at the state level, 
you only compete against other grant applicants in your state. You 
encounter considerably less competition than at the federal, direct 
grant-seeking level.
 
✓ Driving to your state capital to make a personal appearance before 
state agency program staff is relatively easy. While you’re there, get 
the insider’s perspective by asking for a list of grants funded previously. 
Make sure the list contains the grant recipients and award amounts. And 
ask for a copy of a successful grant application from a previous competi-
tion. Knowing how winners write can boost your chances!
 
Under the Freedom of Information Act, all government agencies must provide 
requested public information to the requestor (you, the public). Exceptions 
to the act are extensive and include national security–related and classified 
documents. Chapter 20 shows you how to use the Freedom of Information Act 
to find out why your grant application was not funded.
 
The only disadvantage to applying for pass-through grants that I’m aware of is 
that your grant award will be a lot smaller than if you applied directly for a fed-
eral grant and received an award. Larger pots of money wait at the direct level, 
but the heavy competition reduces the odds of your getting those big awards.
Pass-through grant awards are significantly smaller than direct grant awards 
because the state takes money off the top of each federal grant to cover 
administrative costs. Then the amount that’s left must be divided geo-
graphically and politically. For example, grants go to certain areas of a state 
because those areas haven’t won many grant awards recently. They go to 
other areas because the state senator or representative has a lot of power 
and influence with a state agency. Wake up, smell the coffee, and realize that 
politics have influence over grantmaking.
Distinguishing between competitive 
and formula grants
To win a competitive grant, you must compete with other grant applicants for 
a limited amount of money. A team of peer reviewers (experts and lay people 
who apply to read and score grant applications) looks at your application 

58
Part II: Identifying Key Grantmakers Worldwide 
and decides how many points you’ll receive for each narrative section in the 
body of the grant request. The applications with the highest scores are rec-
ommended for funding. (In Chapter 10, I provide details on the peer review 
process for grant applications.)
A formula grant, on the other hand, is money that’s disbursed by a state agency 
to a grant applicant based on some kind of a preset standard or formula.
A great example for formula monies is a grant for improving recycling efforts. 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency may award a set amount of money 
to each state and territory for recycling education. “May” is the operative 
word here. Some grants are formula and some are competitive. It all depends 
on the agency’s budget in any given year — and how they want to award the 
monies based on Congressional legislative mandates. Suppose you live in a 
town with 2,500 residents, and the formula grant awards each small or rural 
community with up to 3,000 residents a formula allocation of $10 per resi-
dent. Your community would be in line to receive $25,000 to start or continue 
a recycling education program.
Browsing the CFDA for Federal Monies
You can find all sorts of information about where the money’s at and what 
it can be used for in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA). This 
publication, which contains information about every competitive and formula 
grant program administered by departments and agencies of the federal 
government, is available from any public library. Or you can find it online at 
www.cfda.gov.
When you want to know what funding is out there for you at the federal level, 
the CFDA is where you start. After you identify grants that you’re interested 
in applying for, you can subscribe to grant announcement alerts published in 
the Federal Register.
 
When you’re looking for federal programs in the CFDA, remember that grant 
writers must zero in on programs that award project grants (also referred to as 
cooperative agreements) — the most plentiful category for local, regional, and 
national grant seekers. A project grant is funding for a specific period of time. 
These grant funds must be used to deliver the specific services outlined in the 
grant application narrative. Project grants include fellowships, scholarships, 
research grants, training grants, traineeships, experimental and demonstra-
tion grants, evaluation grants, planning grants, technical assistance grants, 
survey grants, construction grants, and unsolicited contractual agreements.

59
 Chapter 4: Checking Out Public Funding Epicenters
Examining how the CFDA is organized
The CFDA divides programs into nearly two dozen categories and more than 
170 subcategories that identify specific areas of interest. Listed here are the 
basic categories into which programs are grouped:
 
✓ Agriculture
 
✓ Business and Commerce
 
✓ Community Development
 
✓ Consumer Protection
 
✓ Cultural Affairs
 
✓ Disaster Prevention and Relief
 
✓ Education
 
✓ Employment, Labor, and 
Training
 
✓ Energy
 
✓ Environmental Quality
 ✓ Food and Nutrition
 ✓ Health
 ✓ Housing
 ✓ Income Security and Social Services
 ✓ Information and Statistics
 ✓ Law, Justice, and Legal Services
 ✓ Natural Resources
 ✓ Regional Development
 ✓ Science and Technology
 ✓ Transportation
Understanding what’s 
provided in the CFDA
The entry for each federal program in the CFDA includes general information 
on the:
 
✓ Federal agency administering the program
 
✓ Five-digit code that identifies the federal grantmaking agency and sub-
agency distributing the grant or cooperative agreement funds
 
✓ Authorization upon which the program is based (the federal legislation 
that created the program)
 
✓ Objectives and goals of the program
 
✓ Types of financial and nonfinancial assistance offered under a program 
(A grant is financial assistance. Just skip over the nonfinancial talk.)
 
✓ Uses and restrictions placed upon a program
 
✓ Eligibility requirements

60
Part II: Identifying Key Grantmakers Worldwide 
 
✓ Application and award process
 
✓ Assistance considerations (tells you if there are formula or matching 
requirements)
 
✓ Postassistance requirements (gives you the general expectations for 
grantee reports, audits, and record keeping)
 
✓ Financial information (tells you the amount of obligations — how much 
money Congress allocated to this program — for the past, current, and 
future fiscal years; the federal fiscal year starts October 1 and ends 
September 30) and estimated average award sizes
 
✓ Program accomplishments (generic history of what this federal program 
has done recently to fulfill its mission)
 
✓ Regulations, guidelines, and literature relevant to a program
 
✓ Information contacts at the headquarters, regional, and local offices
 
✓ Related programs based upon program objectives and uses (helps you 
find other federal programs that award grants in your project’s area)
 
✓ Examples of funded projects (look for funded projects that sound like 
the project you’re seeking grant monies for)
 
✓ Criteria for selecting proposals
In addition, the CFDA is full of legal terms and numerical references to legisla-
tive acts. Entries consist of a numerical code, a program title, and a descrip-
tion. For example, the first part of an entry in the CFDA looks like this:
11.611 Manufacturing Extension Partnership
This first part of the entry breaks down into the
 
✓ Numerical code: Each federal agency has a section, and each section 
is numbered with a five-digit code. The code labels an agency’s pro-
grams. The first two digits identify the federal department or agency 
that administers the program. (11, from the previous example, is the 
U.S. Department of Commerce.) The last three digits are assigned in 
numerical sequence, beginning with program number 001 through 
program 999. (For instance, in the previous example, 611 refers to 
the National Institute of Standards and Technology, a division of 
Commerce.)
 
✓ Program title: Each program also has a title, which is the descriptive 
name given to the program. In the example that I give earlier, the title is 
Manufacturing Extension Partnership.

61
 Chapter 4: Checking Out Public Funding Epicenters
Determining what isn’t 
included in the CDFA
 
The CDFA doesn’t give you the estimated number of awards because you’re 
reading generic information that may not be up-to-date. You can find informa-
tion on the current estimated number of awards and estimated average award 
size in the actual grant opportunity announcement on www.grants.gov, the 
one-stop federal grant information Web site.
Also, note that the CDFA doesn’t give specific deadlines for any grantmaking 
agencies. The CFDA is like a generic encyclopedia. All specific information, 
such as grant deadlines, is posted in the grant opportunity announcement.
Finding Federal Money on Grants.gov
Every day I get started by opening my e-mail inbox. Why? I’ve subscribed to 
the free services offered by Grants.gov (www.grants.gov). By signing up 
for this free service, you can receive e-mail alerts announcing grant funding 
opportunities from any of the 26 federal grantmaking agencies. Just log on 
and subscribe. Choose 1, 2, or more agencies and wait 24 hours to start cruis-
ing through the daily list of federal grant announcements.
I depend on Grants.gov to tell me about all of the monies being doled out in 
our nation’s capitol. Here’s how Grants.gov can help you find monies for your 
organization:
 
✓ You can search, on your own, for current and past grant funding 
opportunities. Log on daily and check for postings in your area of inter-
est. A subject search (for example, housing, legal services, or after-school 
programs) is the easiest way to narrow down specific grant competitions 
in your project or program area.
 
✓ You can register for notification of grant opportunities. Subscribe to a 
daily e-mail alert.
 
✓ You can browse through the Applicant Resources link to look at all 
sorts of materials. For example, you can glance through frequently 
asked questions (FAQs), user guides, animated tutorials, the quarterly 
Succeed e-newsletter, Web cast archives, a software glossary, individual 
grant resources, and managing grant resources.

You can also apply for grants directly through the Web site. Using Grants.
gov, you can
 
✓ Prepare to apply for grants: Click the link provided for a grant and read 
the full announcement. When you find a competition that fits your orga-
nization, you can search for the grant opportunity for which you plan to 
apply and download the grant application package.
 
✓ Access active grant application packages: In addition to the required 
forms, you can also access lists of frequently asked questions (FAQs) 
regarding each grant. Usually these questions originate at the funding 
agency’s technical assistance conference or Web cast.
 
✓ Download, complete, and submit grant application packages online 
through the e-grant system portal on www.grants.gov.
 
✓ Check the status of an application submitted via Grants.gov.
For more on federal grant application kits, turn to Chapter 5.
 
Grants.gov recommends downloading Adobe Reader to seamlessly apply for 
grants. (Check the current standard version for Grants.gov before you install 
the software.) Also, note that Grants.gov changes annually, meaning that you’ll 
need to check their e-grant format and submission requirements frequently.
Going For the Gold 101
After you receive a funding alert in your organization’s operating area, the 
clock starts ticking . . . and ticking fast! Most often, you’ll have less than 30 
calendar days’ notice from the time a grant opportunity is published until 
applications are due at the funding agency. In addition to time-constraint fac-
tors, remember that when applying for federal grant monies, you’re compet-
ing with eligible applicants from the 50 states and the U.S. territories. How do 
you know when your chances for receiving a grant award are good or not so 
good? What’s the key? I answer these questions in the following sections.
Cautiously calculating 
your odds of winning
 
Before you apply for a federal grant, take a minute and focus on the 
announcement. Identifying the critical points in the federal grant opportunity 
announcement saves you time and grief later on. Don’t even start the writ-
ing process until you complete the following four internal, organizational, 
prequalification steps:

63
 Chapter 4: Checking Out Public Funding Epicenters
 
1. Quickly scan the first few pages to find the Eligible Applicants language.
 
 Make sure that your organization is eligible to apply for the grant fund-
ing. You’ll become a skilled speed-reader when you see how long grant 
application announcements are and figure out how to focus in on the 
key phrases.
 
2. Look for the Deadline for Transmittal of Applications.
 
 This deadline, listed in the first few pages of the announcement, is when 
the grant application must be in the hands of the agency issuing the 
grant announcement. Before you get started, make sure that you or your 
grant writing team can meet the application deadline.
 
3. Identify the Estimated Average Award Size.
 
 Calculate your anticipated project cost and compare that total sum to 
the Estimated Average Award, the average grant amount that this fed-
eral agency intends to make.
 
 Suppose you’ve already started to prepare a draft budget for your proj-
ect, and it totals $200,000 for the first year. If the average award for the 
grant you’re interested in is only $75,000, where will the rest of your 
funding come from? See Chapter 2 for how to develop a funding develop-
ment plan.
 
4. Look closely at the Estimated Number of Awards to determine the 
chances of a federal grant being awarded in your state.
 
 For example, if only 20 grants will be awarded in a competition, your 
odds may not be that great. Fifty states plus seven commonwealths and 
territories mean dozens, even hundreds, of grant applicants from each 
eligible area. Unless your organization has a one-of-a-kind idea, a fantas-
tic track record when it comes to winning federal grants, and a list of 
very impressive community, regional, and national partners, the odds 
that you’ll get a grant award aren’t good.
 
When you find that you’re ineligible for a grant, you can’t meet the deadline, 
or your chances of getting a federal grant award are negligible, look to other 
federal agencies that fund in the same area. Also look at other types of grant 
monies, such as state monies or foundation and corporate monies. Chapter 2 
explains how to diversify your grant options.
Schmoozing with elected officials
Searching for federal grant monies without calling your elected legislators 
really doesn’t make much sense. Getting to know these critical contacts on 
Capitol Hill could make the difference between finding out about a federal 
funding opportunity before it’s published and finding out about it when you 
have only 15 days (or less!) to write a major grant application.

64
Part II: Identifying Key Grantmakers Worldwide 
 
You elected these individuals to serve on your behalf in the nation’s capital. 
Use your leverage. Make a telephone call to the local or regional office for your 
state’s congressional legislators. During your initial phone call, ask for a meet-
ing or simply state your funding needs. Tell legislators that your organization 
critically needs their support in identifying federal funding.
Also, learn how to impress your elected officials. How? Host annual legisla-
tive events (breakfast, lunch, or dinner) where you present an overview of 
your organization and a wish list for programs and services. Make sure to 
use a slideshow presentation and give each attendee an information packet 
covering your presentation content. Feed them, and convince them that your 
organization has the most need for government funding. You can schmooze 
with both state and federal elected officials. I helped agencies wine, dine, 
and win over their elected officials, and then the money door just magically 
opened for nearly all their government requests.

▶ Working with online applications
▶ Surveying the different federal grant application forms
W
hy do most grant writers remain in the minor leagues for their 
entire careers? They fear federal grant applications. Federal grants 
are the most difficult grants to apply for — more difficult than foundation, 
corporate, or state and local government grants. Federal grants are known 
for their short deadlines, technically worded writing and review criteria, 
and zillions of intimidating forms. But Grants.gov (which is found online at 
www.grants.gov) makes things a wee bit easier.
When the federal government first launched Grants.gov, it was every grant 
writer’s fear come true. Technology was taking over the submission process, 
and it wasn’t readily accepted nor wanted. The process would be seamless — 
at least that’s what the feds told everyone. But there were many glitches along 
the way while the online e-grant submission Web site was perfected. Today, 
it’s still a work in progress, but the initial fear that we all had has dissipated.
In this chapter, I take you on a guided tour of the Grants.gov home page, and 
I give you some pointers on getting your organization registered to apply for 
federal monies. I also lead you through those confusing grant application forms 
and the downloading and uploading process for the entire grant application.
 
As long as you follow the online directions and don’t wait until the last minute 
to upload your grant application, you’ll breeze through the once stormy 
waters of federal e-grant applications.

to find federal grants, apply for federal grants, and follow-up on federal grant 
applications submitted.
The Grants.gov home page looks easy on first glance, but in reality it can be 
a pain! Most novice grant writers are intimidated by the federal grant writing 
process. They fear the technical instructions, lengthy writing requirements, 
and many forms with “I don’t have a clue” types of information fields. Even 
the most fearless grant writer — one who can master the federal grant appli-
cation research and writing process — is further aghast at the online Grants.
gov information retrieval and uploading processes.
So even though the information in this section may seem somewhat repeti-
tive once you actually visit the Grants.gov Web site, I still want to take you 
on a guided tour. It will prepare you for what you’ll see and be expected to 
provide in order to master the Grants.gov processes. Visit the Web site fre-
quently, expect site changes, and take it one link or step at a time!
To start, grab a drink to soothe your nerves, crank up your computer, and log 
on to Grants.gov. See how easy this is . . . you’re just getting started, and I’m 
your tour guide. Fasten your seat belt, the tour is beginning!
Getting to know the basics of 
Grants.gov and eligibility
Grants.gov is a central storehouse for information on more than 1,000 grant 
programs. It provides access to approximately $400 billion in annual awards. 
As you can see, there are plenty of grant programs and a ton of money avail-
able. Even in slow economy years, grants are still awarded!
Throughout the Grants.gov Website, you’ll find tidbits of valuable informa-
tion that help first-time grant writers familiarize themselves with the basic 
questions, such as “What is a grant?” and “Who’s eligible for one?”
Some of the eligible applicant categories for federal grants are the following: 
Government organizations, education organizations, public housing organiza-
tions, nonprofit organizations, for-profit organizations, small businesses, and 
individuals.

Getting Registered to Apply 
for Grants on Grants.gov
In order to apply for a grant from Grants.gov, you and/or your organization 
must complete the (not so easy) Grants.gov registration process. You can 
register as an organization or as an individual. I explain both ways in the fol-
lowing sections.
 
The registration process can take between three to five business days. It can 
even take as long as two weeks if all the steps aren’t completed on a timely 
basis. It took me six weeks to register my corporation as a potential grant 
applicant! So register early to avoid delays!

68
Part II: Identifying Key Grantmakers Worldwide 
Registering as an organization
In order to get your organization registered to submit grant applications on 
the Grants.gov system, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Get a Dun & Bradstreet number (DUNS Number).
 
 You can do this online at www.dnb.com/US/duns_update. In fact, 
there’s a link to this Web site on Grants.gov. This registration is free and 
gives you a common tracking number for doing business with the gov-
ernment (federal, state, and local).
 
2. Register with the Central Contractor Registry (also known as the CCR).
 
 What is the CCR? It’s a secondary Web site that collects all your organiza-
tion’s contact information. The information requested is similar to what 
you submit in your annual IRS tax return, such as name of organization, 
address, contact person, and contact person’s information including 
Social Security number. You’ll also be asked to upload your banking infor-
mation (the bank’s tracking number and the organization’s bank account 
number). This info is used to facilitate electronic banking between the 
government and your organization. You didn’t think they still sent the 
check in the mail did you?
 
3. Create a username and password with the Grants.gov credential 
provider.
 
 You’ll receive a user name and password from a third party credential 
provider contracted by the government. At that point, you’ll be routed 
back to Grants.gov to complete your registration with the access point 
information.
 
4. Obtain AOR Authorization.
 
 This step sounds terribly difficult, but it isn’t! The E-Business Point of 
Contact (or E-Biz POC) at your organization must respond to the regis-
tration e-mail from Grants.gov and login at Grants.gov to authorize you 
as an Authorized Organization Representative (AOR). Your E-Biz POC is 
the Executive Director or person who manages finances at your organi-
zation. Only the AOR can log on and conduct business or grant-related 
transactions with the federal government.
 
 At any time, you can track your AOR authorization status by logging in 
with your username and password that you obtained in Step 3.

69
 Chapter 5: Wading through Grants.gov
Registering as an individual
Individual registration can take up to one business day to complete. If you’re 
going to go it alone, here are the quick steps to follow:
 
1. Obtain your Grants.gov username and password.
 
 In order to secure your electronic information, Grants.gov uses a cre-
dential provider. When you start the individual registration process, 
you’ll be given an ID and password (just like an organization that reg-
isters). This secure type of access guarantees that your personal infor-
mation and grant application will be sent to the appropriate federal 
grantmaking agency — safely and securely.
 
 Individuals don’t need a DUNS Number to register and submit applica-
tions. The Grants.gov system will generate a default value in that field. 
Registering with the credential provider is a simple process. You can 
even find a tutorial link on the Grants.gov Web site that guides you 
through the registration process.
 
2. After you’ve registered with a credential provider, you need to go 
back to the Grants.gov Web site and enter the username and pass-
word provided.
 
 After you’ve logged in at Grants.gov, you’ll be asked to provide the 
Funding Opportunity Number, or FON, that’s associated with your grant 
application. This number is the one that’s assigned by the federal grant-
making agency to each grant opportunity notice you receive in your free 
grant alert e-mail.
 
After you register on Grants.gov as an individual, you can then only apply for 
federal grant competitions that are open to individuals.
Downloading and Uploading 
Applications on Grants.gov
Since the arrival of the Grants.gov e-grant system, all the federal grant applica-
tion forms that you need are available through the Grants.gov Web site. Here 
are some easy steps to help you maneuver Grants.gov and find an application:

70
Part II: Identifying Key Grantmakers Worldwide 
 
1. Download your grant application package.
 
 To download this package, log on to the Grants.gov home page and click 
on the Apply for Grants link. There you’ll see a link to download your 
grant application package. You need the Funding Opportunity Number 
(FON) or the Catalog of Federal and Domestic Assistance (CFDA) 
number to download. (Chapter 4 gives you the scoop on the CFDA.)
 
2. After you find your specific grant funding announcement, you’ll be 
able to download the grant application instructions easily.
 
3. Complete your grant application offline.
 
 Instructions on how to open and use the forms in the grant application 
package are on the cover sheet (the first sheet you view in the down-
loaded window view).
 
4. Submit the completed grant application.
 
 After you click the “Sign and Submit” button on the summary page, your 
application package will automatically be uploaded to Grants.gov. A con-
firmation screen will appear after the upload is complete. You’ll see a 
Grants.gov tracking number as well as the submission’s official date and 
time.
 
 Record the tracking number. This way you can refer to it if you need to 
contact Grants.gov or give it to your Congressional officials for tracking 
your grant application after it’s submitted.
 
5. Track the status of your submitted grant application package.
 
 After your grant application has been submitted, you can check the 
status by clicking on the Track Your Application link on the home page. 
Your status can be marked as any of the following:
 
 Received: The application has been received by Grants.gov, but 
it’s still awaiting validation.
 
 Validated: The application has been validated by Grants.gov, and 
it’s now available for the agency to download.
 
 Received by the agency: The agency has confirmed receipt of the 
application package.
 
 Agency tracking number assigned: The agency has assigned the 
application an internal track number. (However, keep in mind that 
not all agencies assign tracking numbers.)
 
 Rejected with errors: Because of errors, Grants.gov was unable to 
process your application. You will receive information by e-mail on 
how to address the errors and resubmit the application.

Taking a Look at the Many Federal 
Grant Application Forms
 
Each federal agency has its own grant application forms and its own guide-
lines for filling out the forms. Some agencies have fewer than 10 forms, while 
others have more than 20 forms. Underestimating the importance of the man-
datory forms and the importance of filling them out properly could result in 
the disqualification of your grant application on a technical error.
What federal grant application forms are the most commonly used by the 
federal grantmaking agencies? Actually all the agencies have standard cover 
forms, budget forms, and assurances, certifications, and disclosures. The rest 
of the required forms will vary from agency to agency.
When filling in any form, always read the instructions that come with the 
online grant application guidelines first. Look for the checklist provided 
in every grant application announcement. The checklist tells you what to 
include in your application’s upload. This includes mandatory forms, narra-
tive sections, and attachments or appendixes.
 
Most federal grantmaking agencies make exceptions to the standard Grants.
gov application upload requirement and will allow grant applicants to submit 
a paper application instead. The checklist becomes even more important for 
hard copy submissions, however, because the forms, narrative, attachments, 
and appendixes must be assembled in a specific order. Otherwise your appli-
cation could be rejected on receipt.
The following sections provide an overview of the most common federal 
grant application forms: cover forms, budget forms, assurance forms, certi-
fication forms, and lobbying disclosure forms. Many state funding agencies 
use similar forms; the required forms are listed in the grant guidelines for 
each funding competition. These forms are listed in the order in which you’re 
most likely to see them in grant application guidelines.
Cover form
The cover form is the top page of all federal grant applications. It’s what the 
feds see when they open your application package. For years, the application 
cover form has been known as the Application for Federal Assistance Cover 
Form (see Figure 5-1).The current cover form is four pages when printed out. 
It has 21 sections and ends with a federal debt delinquency explanation page. 
Here’s a rundown of the sections:

Information
 
Section 8 asks for your organization’s DUNS number. This is a unique nine-
digit identification sequence issued by Dunn & Bradstreet (www.dnb.com/
US/duns_update). The number provides a unique identifier for a single 
business entity and is required for all federal grant applicants (except those 
who register as individuals).

for Federal Assistance Cover Form (or just cover form for short).

Budget information forms
You’ll be filling out a two-page, seven-section set of federal budget forms 
that’s often referred to as Standard Form 424A, Pages 1 and 2. The seven sec-
tions of this form set are labeled Sections A through G.

76
Part II: Identifying Key Grantmakers Worldwide 
 
✓ Section A is where you lay out your budget summary (your federal grant 
request and your non-federal matching monies).
 
✓ Section B is for detailing the budget categories line item by line item.
 
 When you get to Section B, it’s especially important to have read the 
instructions for these forms because each agency differs in how it wants 
you to fill in the columns for multiyear federal funding requests.
 
✓ Section C is where you list the source of your non-federal monies (called 
non-federal resources).
 
✓ Section D asks you to forecast your first-year grant funding needs 
(referred to as forecasted cash needs).
 
✓ Section E is where you tell the federal government the total amount of 
grant funds needed in the second through fifth years of your project. 
However, fill in this section only if the grant award is for multiple years.
 
✓ Section F is where you explain any amounts requested in the federal 
portion of your budget that are unusual or unclear to someone outside 
your agency — such as a federal grant reader (also known as a peer 
reviewer). In this section, you also explain your already negotiated 
indirect cost rate (contact the Office of Management and Budget, www.
whitehouse.gov/omb, to start this lengthy process well before you 
plan to apply for federal grant funding). Finally, Section F is where you 
can add any other explanations or comments to explain your rather 
large or mysterious budget.
 
✓ Section G is where you total Columns C through F.
You can see these forms in Figures 5-2a and 5-2b. Chapter 17 gives you 
greater insight into the budget line item preparation process.
Assurances form
The federal government wants assurances that your organization — the grant 
applicant — can meet all of its funding expectations. And it gets these assur-
ances from the aptly named assurances form. This is an online form that you 
add your electronic signature to and submit.
 
If you have questions regarding this form, you should contact the awarding 
agency. Also, note that some federal awarding agencies may require you to 
certify to additional assurances; if that’s the case, you’ll be notified of how to 
proceed.

The assurances cover your legal authority to (among other things):
 
✓ Apply for grants
 
✓ Address your commitment to record keeping
 
✓ Provide safeguards for conflict of interest
 
✓ Protect the meeting time frame established in your grant application
 
✓ Comply with multiple federal laws regarding fairness and equity for pro-
gram staff and participants
 
By signing the assurances, you’re conveying to the government funding 
agency that your organization will comply with all applicable requirements of 
all other federal laws, executive orders, regulations, and policies governing 
this program.
Certification forms
Each federal agency has its own specific certification forms. Basically, 
certification forms inform you of sanctions against fraud, waste, and finan-
cial abuse related to federal grant awards. At the time you apply for grant 
monies, the certification forms require you to acknowledge your understand-
ing of the fact that if you mess up and misspend or mismanage your federal 
grant award, you won’t be allowed to approach any federal agency for grant 
monies, forever and ever. The feds mean business!
Disclosure of lobbying activity form
A lobbyist is an individual or a firm that spends a lot of time on Capitol Hill 
or at your state capitol schmoozing with elected officials. Lobbyists work for 
for-profit and nonprofit agencies. They’re on a (paid) mission to convince leg-
islators to vote one way or another to benefit their client agencies. Lobbyists 
apply a lot of pressure, and a lot of money flows as a result.
 
If you’ve hired a lobbyist to make sure more federal or state dollars come your 
way, you must fess up by filling out the Disclosure of Lobbying Activities form.

Uncovering Private Sector Funding
In This Chapter
▶ Gathering advice on how to get the grants you want
▶ Discovering where to find private funders
▶ Targeting the best funding source for your project by scanning info fields
▶ Organizing and prioritizing funding source files
W
hat exactly is the private sector? Am I talking about the Rockefellers 
or the Gates’ or the Fords? No, I’m talking about corporate and 
foundation grantmakers whose endowments (funds that started each giving 
entity) came from individuals, families, and for-profit corporations or busi-
nesses. These funders are plentiful at the local, state, national, and interna-
tional levels.
How do you find out who these philanthropic (giving) organizations are and 
what they like to fund? In this chapter, I take you on a treasure hunt to find 
out. But rather than hunting gold nuggets, we’ll be hunting grantmaker nug-
gets. Ready, set, turn on your night lights, and let’s get started!
Knowing the Secrets of Successful 
Private Sector Grantseeking
 
Before you ask a foundation or corporation to hand over money, do your 
homework. Simply mailing a three- to five-page grant proposal without doing 
research is asking for a big-time rejection letter — and it’s a waste of your time 
and the grantmaker’s time. Here are some things you can do to set yourself 
apart from the field:
 
✓ Use the Internet to look for Web sites of foundations and corporations. 
Jump ahead to the section “Mining the Foundation Center’s Funding 
Resources” for a funding search starting point. Set aside at least five 4- 
to 8-hour days (for an electronic search) to identify all potential founda-
tion and corporate funders for your project.

82
Part II: Identifying Key Grantmakers Worldwide 
 
✓ Subscribe to electronic funding newsletters that contain articles about 
what types of grants various foundations and corporations fund and 
that provide information on applying for them. Just a few of the many 
online newsletters that help you keep up with foundation and corporate 
giving are the Philanthropy News Digest (www.foundationcenter.
org/pnd) and the RFP Bulletin (www.foundationcenter.org/pnd/
rfp/index.jhtml), both of which are produced by The Foundation 
Center. Another great online newsletter is the GrantStation Insider 
(www.grantstation.com).
 
✓ Request grant application guidelines, an annual report (which contains 
financial information on the funder and usually a section on previous 
grants funded), and any other print literature that can help you tailor 
your grant application to the funder’s current interest area. Also, while 
you’re on the funder’s Web site, look for lists of previous grantees. This 
list can tell you how much the funder funds, if the fund has funded in 
your area, and who the funder has funded.
 
✓ E-mail or call each funder to establish a “real” connection and to inquire 
about grant writing guideline updates that may not be posted on the 
funder’s Web site yet. If you call, make sure to jot down some notes 
about the call and the person you speak with. Write down his or her 
name and title, the date and time of the call, and what was discussed. 
Having a friend at the funder’s office will help if your grant application is 
rejected and you want the inside scoop on why it was rejected.
 
✓ Follow to a T all the directions provided by the funding source on how 
to apply for grants. If you get one item wrong, your proposal can be dis-
qualified — even if everything else is golden.
 
I would be remiss if I didn’t mention some things to avoid when grantseeking. 
Here’s a brief but important list:
 
✓ Don’t rely on outdated funding publications or Web sites for current 
contact information. Anything older than one year should not be used. 
Scroll down to the bottom of a Web site’s home page to see the date that 
it was last updated.
 
✓ Don’t buy anything that you can get for free on the Internet or from 
other sources.
 
✓ Don’t call the funding source with a dozen questions — self-destruction, I 
believe it’s called. If you have new questions about instructions or infor-
mation not found in the grant application guidelines, feel free to call. 
However, don’t call repeatedly with questions that can be answered in 
the guidelines.
 
✓ Don’t write a grant application or proposal and mail it without having 
completed extensive research.

83
 Chapter 6: Uncovering Private Sector Funding
 
✓ Don’t broadcast your funding sources to colleagues working for other 
nonprofits. Keep in mind that you’re competing for funding. Learn to 
treasure, or keep quiet about, your findings, lest others apply as well 
and lessen your chances of winning.
 
 Remember that only a very small portion of the funding source’s monies 
will be awarded in one geographic area. If your buddy’s group gets the 
cash, you don’t. The exception is funding sources that are local and only 
distribute funds in a specific city, town, county, or state. However, you 
still should protect the grants you’ve found, just in case.
Finding Private Funders 
in All the Right Places
When it comes to grantseeking in the private sector, you have tons of Web 
sites to screen. Then there are books, books, and more books of potential 
funding sources. Gone by the wayside are the outdated databases that were 
sold on CD-ROMs. Some funding database subscription Web sites still market 
the CDs; however, you will find the most up-to-date information by using the 
online databases (which are updated daily).
So, to keep you out of the grant seeker’s loony bin, this section gives you 
my favorite hits on the Internet along with a list of some really great publica-
tions that carry news on the funders you want to know about. Using these 
resources is a must and saves you lots of time.
Mining the Foundation Center’s 
funding resources
In the United States, the most affordable nonprofit Web site with the largest 
database for corporate and foundation funding sources is the Foundation 
Center’s Web site, which you can find at www.foundationcenter.org. 
Headquartered in New York City, the Center has field offices in Atlanta, 
Cleveland, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. In addition, the Center also 
has cooperating collections across the United States and in Puerto Rico.
 
If you’re looking for freebies, cooperating collections are free funding informa-
tion centers in libraries, community foundations, and other nonprofit resource 
centers. They provide a core collection of the Foundation Center’s publica-
tions and a variety of supplemental materials and services in areas useful to 

84
Part II: Identifying Key Grantmakers Worldwide 
grantseekers. So if you have a cooperating collection near you, you won’t have 
to pay for a subscription to access the Center’s online materials. The advan-
tage of subscribing is that you can have the information you need, when you 
need it, and at your finger tips — at home or work.
Getting the lowdown on a paid online subscription
The Foundation Center’s online directory has multiple paid-subscription 
levels ranging from basic (10,000 foundations in the database) to professional 
(over 92,000 detailed profiles). If you decide to pay for a subscription, you’ll 
have access to detailed information on foundation and corporate funders. The 
pages of info you pull up on these funders are referred to as funder profiles.
Look under the Find Funders link, and you’ll see the subsection Identify 
Funding Sources. Under this subsection, you can find links to the Foundation 
Directory Online and Corporate Giving Online. Get out your credit card if you 
want to subscribe to these bountiful directories. The minimum subscription 
for 30 days costs around $20. The maximum subscription for 30 days will set 
you back around $200.
What do you get for your money? That depends on your subscription level. 
At the lowest and least expensive level in the Foundation Directory Online, 
you can peruse 10,000 foundations and more than 70,000 trustees, officers, 
and donors with 14 search fields plus a key word search. At the highest and 
most expensive level, your eyes may quickly become tired as you search 
through more than 92,000 foundations, corporate donors, and public grant-
making charities; over 1.3 million recent grant awards; more than 400,000 
trustees, officers, and donors; over 441,000 IRS 990 forms. With this level of 
subscription, you get to search with 39 search fields and a keyword search. 
Your subscription level is only limited by your credit card limit!
Navigating the IRS Form 990
When I want to know everything about the 
financial picture of a specific private sector 
funder, I look at the funder’s IRS 990 Form (non-
profit tax return) to see all of its assets, major 
grants awarded, and contact information for 
its board members in the event I need to ask a 
board member to be an advocate for my fund-
ing request.
The current IRS Form 990 is nine pages and 
comes in PDF format. It can be downloaded 
from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Web 
site at www.irs.gov. Sections A through M 
(Page 1 at the top of the form) request contact 
and identifying information on the nonprofit 
organization. After those sections are several 
parts that require other information.

85
 Chapter 6: Uncovering Private Sector Funding
After you’ve become a paid subscriber to the Foundation Center’s online 
directory, you can start your funder research in four different ways. You can 
search by any of the following topics:
 
✓ Grantmakers: Your subscription level determines whether you have 
access to 10,000 grantmakers or more than 90,000. Out of the four topics 
in this list, I search by the grantmaker most often. It’s easy and produc-
tive. This type of search allows you to search by
 
• Grantmaker name
 
• Grantmaker location (state, county, city, metro area, and zip code)
 
• Fields of interest
 
• Types of support
 
• Geographic focus
 
• Trustees, officers, and donors
 
• Type of grantmaker
 
• Total giving
 
• Keyword
 
 With this search, I usually find at least 10 to 20 potential private sector 
funding sources for each project that I’m working on.
 
✓ Companies: This search option is available to professional-level sub-
scribers only. With it, you can search corporate grantmakers (businesses 
that have developed corporate giving programs). When you can’t find 
funders in the Foundation-Only section, it’s a good idea to search for 
grant opportunities in the Companies Section.
 
✓ Grants: This option allows you to search by
 
• Grantmaker name
 
• Recipient name
 
• Recipient state/county
 
• Recipient city
 
• Recipient type
 
• Subjects
 
• Types of support
 
• Keyword

86
Part II: Identifying Key Grantmakers Worldwide 
 
 I like the Grants option when I want to know the funders that have 
awarded grants in a specific county or region. However, this option 
doesn’t give you a detailed profile of the funder.
 
✓ Form 990s: This search option is only available to subscribers at the 
professional level. Why would you look at an organization’s Form 990 
anyway? To find out the total number of grants awarded in the grant-
maker’s most recent fiscal year (the 12-month operating period deter-
mined when they filed for IRS nonprofit status). Looking at the total 
number of grants awarded gives you an idea of the funder’s financial 
capacity. If I find a funder only awarding ten grants per year, I view this 
as a red flag. That usually means there’s not too much philanthropy 
going on there. However, when I see that a funder has awarded 100 
grants, I’m ready to be a winner in next year’s competition!
 
 If you don’t want to fork over the cash to subscribe at the professional 
level, remember that you can find most IRS Form 990s for nonprofit orga-
nizations, including grantmakers, on the subscription-based GuideStar 
Web site (www.guidestar.org).
Going for hard copy resources
Besides having tons of online info (see the previous section “Getting the low-
down on a paid online subscription”), the Foundation Center also has some 
hard copy publications. Even though these materials aren’t free, they still 
make great desktop references if you write grant proposals in specialized 
areas. Some of the directory resources include:
 
✓ Grant guides with information specific to major funding areas. For exam-
ple, here are some of the major funding areas covered by these guides:
 
• Arts, culture, and the humanities
 
• Children and youth
 
• Elementary and secondary education
 
• Environmental protection and animal welfare
 
• Foreign and international programs
 
• Higher education
 
• Libraries and information services
 
• Mental health, addictions, and crisis services
 
• Minorities
 
• People with disabilities
 
• Religion, religious welfare, and religious education
 
• Women and girls

87
 Chapter 6: Uncovering Private Sector Funding
 
✓ Print directories of the online funder database are also available. For 
example, you can order hard copies from the following:
 
• The Foundation Center Library
 
• Companion Directory Set
 
• Classic Directory Set
 
• U.S. Directory Set
 
• Comprehensive Directory Set
 
• Foundation Universe Set
 
• The International Collection (for you nonprofit governmental orga-
nization grantseekers)
 
 Each directory has its own unique and information-filled titles, so cruise 
the Center’s Web site to see full descriptions.
 
You can buy any of these resources by visiting www.foundationcenter.
org/marketplace.
Choosing the free route
The following list highlights some online links where you can access free 
information on the Foundation Center’s Web site (www.foundation
center.org):
 
✓ The Find Funders Tab: When you click on this tab, you’ll see links that 
help you find foundations and IRS Form 990s (nonprofit tax returns); 
track funding trends and requests for proposals; download common 
grant applications (with download links for each of the Regional 
Associations of Grantmakers, which are also called RAGS); and decipher 
statistics on the top funders (corporate and foundation).
 
✓ Newsletters Link: Click this link and you’ll find a list of newsletters that 
you can subscribe to (via e-mail delivery) free of charge. You don’t even 
have to register for online access. You can use the free newsletters to 
find topic specific Requests for Proposals (RFPs) released by foundation 
and corporate funders. You can also use the newsletters to keep abreast 
of what’s happening in the world of grantmaking. I have subscriptions 
for the following:
 
• Philanthropy News Digest: This is the Foundation Center’s long-
running, award-winning weekly news digest. It tells you what’s 
happening in the world of philanthropy. Staying up-to-date on phi-
lanthropy is important because then you know when foundation or 
corporate contact personnel are leaving or were just hired. You’ll 
also know what each specific funder that’s listed in the digest is 
doing that relates to their grantmaking policies and trends.

88
Part II: Identifying Key Grantmakers Worldwide 
 
• RFP Bulletin: This freebie is a weekly roundup of recently 
announced Requests for Proposals (RFPs) from private, corporate, 
and government funding sources.
Accessing other online funding resources
While the Foundation Center is my database of preference because of the size 
of its grantmaker and grantmaking collection, I also use other online funding 
resources. Here’s a brief list of the others I use:
 
✓ www.grantstation.com: GrantStation.com, a subscription-based 
Web site, provides members with quick and easy links to all current 
sources of grant money and tells visitors how to secure available fund-
ing. GrantStation’s features allow members to find a funder by using 
the Grantseekers Toolkit, which provides information on new funding 
opportunities, deadlines, and training for grant writers. This toolkit 
also allows members to conduct grant research. I particularly enjoy the 
Grantmaker Updates feature at the bottom of this Web site’s home page; 
the update lists three to five new funding announcements each week.
 
✓ www.fundsnetservices.com: Fundsnet Services is perhaps the most 
comprehensive free access Web site of its kind on the Internet today. 
When you pull up the Fundsnet Services home page, you find so many 
useful links that you may just have a dizzy spell. Here are some links 
that I find tremendously helpful: Arts & Culture Grants, Disability Grants, 
Education Grants, Environment & Conservation Grants, Foundation 
Directory, Community Foundations, Women Grants, and Computers & 
Technology. The downside of this free Web site is that some funder links 
are broken and the information is not updated on the same frequency as 
the Foundation Center’s Online Directory.
 
 Each of the links on this Web site are topic-specific and include click-
through features to send you to a funder’s Web site to read about grant 
opportunities firsthand. Fundsnet Services has made Web site naviga-
tion easy for grant writers of all levels, beginning to advanced.
 
✓ www.fortune.com: This free Web site is full of news about the corpo-
rate world. I like to use the Fortune 500 lists to quickly find potential, 
financially healthy corporate grantmakers. I use this Web site to locate 
the top 500 U.S.-based corporations. The Fortune Web site saves you 
search time and gives you the companies’ rankings where financial 
assets are concerned. In addition to carrying detailed industry and finan-
cial information on U.S.-based corporations, this Web site also has a link 
to the Global 500, a list of the top 500 corporations around the world.
 
 The downside with Fortune.com is that finding a company’s operating 
locations (where they tend to give grant monies) is more difficult. You 
have to click through several links, leaving the Fortune.com Web site 

89
 Chapter 6: Uncovering Private Sector Funding
and searching through the company’s Web site to find information on 
the location of each corporation’s headquarters and operating locations. 
Remember, corporate funders only give grants in the geographical areas 
in which they have headquarters and operating sites.
 
 If you visit money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/
2008/full_list/index.html, you can see the full list of Fortune 
rankings. Click on a company name, and you can see general financial 
information about the corporation. In order to find out where the com-
pany is headquartered and where it operates, you must click on the link 
to its Web site. A separate page should open, and from there you can 
look for links such as About Us or Corporate Governance. Finding corpo-
rate locations in your state or city takes some clever detective work, but 
it’s well worth your time. You can find multiple corporations that offer 
grants in your state or community. Again, this is where they practice 
their social responsibility.
 
✓ www.christiangrants.com: ChristianGrants.com is a subscription-
based Web site that has an online directory for churches, ministries, and 
other grantseekers that looking for monies to start or expand religiously-
affiliated programs and projects. This Web site has more than 175 foun-
dations that fund Christian organizations. Church and ministry grant 
monies are available for building projects, program support, equipment, 
renovations, youth programs, capital campaigns, outreach ministries, 
general operating support, mission trips, seed money, and much more.
 
 On ChristianGrants.com there’s also an online directory with listings of 
grantmakers that fund individuals. Individual grant funding is available 
for scholarships for tuition, missionary work, preaching and ministry, 
clergy renewal, and evangelism view.
 
✓ www.christiangrantsdirectory.org: ChristianGrantsDirectory.org 
offers information on hundreds of Christian foundations, nonprofit dis-
counts, and sources of in-kind donations. You can also sign up for a news-
letter and RSS feed that provides updates of the latest grant opportunities.
Zeroing In on the Most Important 
Information Fields of a Funder Profile
 
After you locate information on a foundation or corporate funding source, 
you need to quickly scan its profile to determine whether you have a perfect 
match. A perfect match means that your program or project fits the source’s 
funding priorities 100 percent. You can’t persuade a funder to change its 
award guidelines or funding priorities; you’re the one who has to do the 
changing to fit the funder’s funding criteria. If you can’t change your program 
or project, that particular funding source isn’t the best one for you. In that 
case, simply keep looking for a better match.

90
Part II: Identifying Key Grantmakers Worldwide 
Every online resource and print publication listing funding sources presents 
the information on the funder in a generalized format referred to as a profile. 
When you look at a funder’s profile, you can scan some specific information 
fields to determine whether reading about this particular funding source is 
worth your time. Check out the following fields:
 
✓ Limitations: Look at the limitations field first. Your organization may 
be eliminated before it can even get to the starting gate. Does the word-
ing in this section eliminate your program or project? If so, move on to 
the next funder’s profile. If not, move on to the next critical information 
field. Typical limitations you may see listed in the grantmaker’s online 
profile include:
 
• Specific geographic giving area (countries, states, and counties)
 
• Restrictions on who they’ll fund and what they’ll fund
 
 Most mainstream foundation funders don’t award grants for religious 
purposes, to individuals, or for capital projects (building construction 
or renovation or major equipment purchases).
 
✓ Purpose and Activities: Every foundation and corporate giver has a pur-
pose statement, located at the beginning of the funding profile. Does the 
funding source’s purpose statement reflect your organization’s values? 
Do any of the activities that the funder prefers to fund match activities 
that your organization is or will be undertaking? If not, read no further. 
Move on to another funder’s information profile. If you can identify with 
this funder’s purpose, move on to the next critical information field.
 
✓ Fields of Interest: Does the program area that you’re seeking grant 
funds for match with any of the funding source’s fields of interest? Keep 
in mind that the language you use to describe your program may not be 
the language the funder uses to list its fields of interest. Think of your 
program area in broad terms and generic categories.
 
 For example, say you need grant funding for a program that will tutor 
and mentor at-risk elementary school students after school and on the 
weekends. You probably won’t find terms such as tutoring, mentoring, 
at-risk, or after-school in the funder’s fields of interest entry. Rather, 
you might find terms such as education (K–12), elementary education, 
public education, private education, and youth programs and services. The 
second list is broader than the first.
 
✓ Types of Support: What types of activities will this funder pay for? If 
you’re trying to erect a new building and the funder only lists general 
operating support, conferences, and seed money under types of support, 
this funding source may not be the one you want to approach with a 
construction project.
 
 Even if this funder isn’t willing to support the type of activity that you’re 
currently seeking funds for, save the funder’s information if you think it 
may be willing to support some other aspect of your organization.

91
 Chapter 6: Uncovering Private Sector Funding
 
✓ Previous Grants or Grantees: Have any previous grants been funded 
in your state? Have any previous grants been for projects similar to 
yours or in your project area? It’s difficult to get a funder to award grant 
monies in a state where it hasn’t previously awarded grants. If a funder 
has a track record for previous grants in your state or previous grants 
for projects similar to yours, the door is open to receive your funding 
request. However, if these aren’t the circumstances you face, you may 
have to e-mail or call the funder to determine whether it’s worth your 
time to proceed with a funding request.
 
✓ Amounts of Grants Previously Funded: Does your guesstimated proj-
ect budget fit into the range of prior grant awards? Use the funder’s 
prior grantmaking amounts to gauge where your request should fall. 
You never want to request a grant amount that exceeds the top grant 
awarded by the funder — that strategy’s a bit too risky. If you’re looking 
for $200,000 and the largest grant awarded was $10,000, you may need to 
find multiple funders for your project.
Prioritizing Your Potential Private 
Funders and Grant Applications
After you identify the potential private funders that are the best fit for your 
program, follow these steps:
 
1. Contact each funding source (via e-mail, letter, or phone call) and ask 
to be included in the funder’s mailing list.
 
 Doing so normally means that you get annual reports, grantmaking 
guidelines, research, and other information that keeps you up-to-date. 
Armed with this information, you’re ready to take the next step.
 
2. Organize your potential foundation and corporate sources by the 
application due dates.
 
 This is a critical step because some private sector funders only have 
once-yearly competitions. You could be a few weeks or many months 
away from the annual date for grant submissions. After all your hard 
work, you don’t want to miss an opportunity to get a grant funded 
because you submitted your application late.
 
 Develop a good filing system for applications and for funder informa-
tion in general. Use a separate folder for each funder. You should have 
massive amounts of information at this point, and keeping everything 
in order is crucial. Sorting things by due date helps you anticipate how 
much work you’ll have in any given month.
 
 Even the best laid plans go astray. But sloppily laid plans? Poorly laid 
plans? These plans are destined to go astray. Be as organized as possible 
to maximize your chances of getting the grants you want.

92
Part II: Identifying Key Grantmakers Worldwide 
 
3. When you’re ready to write, focus on the proposals and applications 
that have due dates in 60 days or less.
 
 Get busy! Check out Part IV for all the details on completing an outstand-
ing application.
 
4. Single out the foundation and corporate funders who accept generic 
National Network of Grantmakers or regional common grant format 
applications anytime during the year.
 
 These grants are normally fairly easy to write. Because the National 
Network of Grantmakers (or NNG) template format captures all the most 
critical grant applicant and project-related information, grant writing 
veterans have been using this easy five-page narrative format for years. 
It’s the best way to apply for grants from corporations and foundations 
that accept unsolicited proposals but don’t have their own specific grant 
application formatting guidelines. The NNG Common Grant Application 
template guides you in the writing process by organizing all the informa-
tion that the funder needs to know into clearly outlined sections. (For 
more on the Common Grant Application, see Chapter 1.)
 
 Nearly a decade ago, the NNG developed the Common Grant Application 
form for their grantmaking members who were willing to accept a more 
generic grant request template. While the NNG Web site is no longer 
active, the Common Grant Application Form can be found by using any 
Internet search engine and typing in “NNG Common Grant Application.”

Chapter 7
Finding Individual and Business 
Grant Opportunities
In This Chapter
▶ Getting to know the types of individual grants
▶ Identifying trustworthy sources of business start-up grants
▶ Discovering business-expansion funding
F
or the past decade, I’ve received hundreds of telephone calls and e-mails 
from people saying they’ve heard about “free” grant money but don’t 
know where to find it. They want to know whether I can point them in the 
right direction. Here’s what I think happened. They woke up in the middle 
of the night and saw an infomercial about “free” government grants — free 
money to buy a house, pay off your bills, start your business, buy a car, and 
more! When they couldn’t find this information the next day, they thought 
that someone somewhere was withholding the real deal.
This chapter sets the record straight. Yes, selected types of grants are 
available for individuals and businesses. However, they aren’t as plentiful 
as you’d think, and you have to be able to use your detective skills on the 
Internet to find legitimate grant-funding opportunities. I get you started in 
the following pages.
 
As is the case with all types of grant monies given — whether given by a 
foundation, corporation, or a government grantmaking agency — strings are 
attached. From eligibility strings to usage strings to default strings — you’ll be 
filling out paperwork from the start to the finish.

94
Part II: Identifying Key Grantmakers Worldwide 
Finding Legitimate Grants 
for Individuals
According to the Foundation Center Web site (www.foundationcenter.
org), the nation’s leading print and online authority on philanthropy (grant-
making), there are more than 6,200 foundations and charity programs that 
fund students, artists, researchers, and other individual grantseekers. To 
make this vast database work for you, you first need to get acquainted with 
the various types of individual grants that are out there.
Commonly awarded grants for individuals include the following:
 
✓ College scholarships and student loans: The former doesn’t require 
repayment, but the latter does. Both college scholarships and student 
loans are awarded to specific financial institutions in the individual’s 
name. Take a look at the College Board’s Web site (www.college
board.com) for an example. After clicking on the For Students link and 
then on the Pay for College link, you can click on the Scholarship & Aid 
link to find helpful scholarship information.
 
✓ Fellowships: This grant type requires no repayment and may be taxable. 
However, fellowships are often restricted to specific institutions or fields 
of study. Some foundations award fellowships directly to individuals; 
others award them to specific colleges or universities. For an example of 
a fellowship, visit the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation’s 
Web site (www.macfound.org). Click on the MacArthur Fellows link to 
find out more.
 
✓ Specific funder-directed assistance grants: These grants are available 
for patient access programs, discount prescription medication programs, 
global humanitarian support, and more. Check out the Bristol-Myers 
Squibb Patient Assistance Foundation’s Web site (www.bmspaf.org) for 
an example. Click on the Apply Now link for an application form.
 
✓ Research grants: This grant type is reserved for educational and 
scientific research projects. For an example, take a look at the Web site 
for the Tides Foundation (www.tides.org). On the home page, click on 
the Tides Foundation tab and then on the Tides Initiatives link to view 
the grantmaking program links.
 
✓ First-time homebuyer grants: Just about every state offers these grants, 
which are earmarked to help eligible individuals and families purchase 
a first home with a reduced down payment. Most often, these monies 
originate from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development 
and are passed down through your state’s housing authority or agency. 
That agency then subgrants these monies to regional and local housing 
assistance programs.

95
 Chapter 7: Finding Individual and Business Grant Opportunities
 
 Each state’s eligibility guidelines vary due to income limits, credit rating 
requirements, and house pricing limits, so call your state’s housing 
authority before applying. Also, be prepared to take a class on home 
ownership.
With the exception of grants for first-time homebuyers, the only types of 
government grants available for individuals are research grants (technology, 
science, and education). These grants are limited and not as plentiful as foun-
dation grants for individuals, so don’t go knocking on Uncle Sam’s door and 
expect the funds to come pouring out.
When you’re ready to start your search for individual grants, first decide 
whether you’re going to use the Internet or visit your local public library. 
If you use the Internet, you can print out your search results and sort them 
from most likely matches to long shots. Then you can start the process of 
contacting each funder to obtain specific guidelines and due dates. If you opt 
to visit your local library and use its printing resources, take plenty of pocket 
change for copying fees. After all, you’ll want to take your findings home for 
later review.
 
The competition is heavy for individual grants, so start your search at least 
one year before you need the funds. Contact the funders for qualification 
details that may not be posted on their Web sites or up-to-date in their print 
publications. Then be sure to fill out all the required forms completely and 
accurately.
 
Individual grants may be taxable, so check with your accountant and the fund-
ing source — unless of course you want to pay taxes on that free money.
Locating Credible Grants for 
Your Business Start-Up
I’d love to tell you that there are grants raining down on every square inch of 
the country to help you start your new business. However, this is simply not 
true. Finding the monies to start a new business has always been an elusive 
and disappointing process. In the 1970s and 1980s, these monies came from 
the federal government and were earmarked for Community Development 
Corporations (also known as CDCs). However, federal help with business 
start-up monies has all but disappeared.
Having said all that, some grants do exist, both nationally and internationally, 
that can help you jump-start your new business. The question is: Where are 
they, and how the heck can you find them? Start by searching the Internet 
using this term: business plan competitions.

96
Part II: Identifying Key Grantmakers Worldwide 
What is a business plan competition, anyway? It’s when leading universities 
and other institutional-type funders put out a call for the best business plan 
models. (In other words, if you enter one of these competitions, you’re com-
peting against graduate and post-graduate students.) A panel of business 
experts reviews each plan and selects the winner(s). The prize can be up to 
$100,000 for some of the competitions.
Following are some sample listings of legitimate business plan competitions 
(which I found through www.smallbusinessnotes.com):
 
✓ Harvard Business School Business Plan Competition
 
✓ Miller Urban Entrepreneurs Series Business Plan Competition
 
Try to search the Internet weekly for updated listings and emerging competi-
tions. Be diligent because the early bird gets the worm — or the grand prize to 
start a new business!
If you’re in disbelief about the narrow field of grants for business start-ups, 
go to the U.S. Small Business Administration’s Web site at www.sba.gov. 
There you’ll find this disclaimer when searching for grants:
Please note that the U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants 
to start or expand small businesses, though it does offer a wide variety of 
loan programs. While the SBA does offer some grant programs, these are 
generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small 
business management, technical, or financial assistance. These grants gen-
erally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, 
and state and local governments.
Don’t worry. The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) doesn’t drop you 
there like a hot potato. Instead, it gives you links to the other federal grant-
making agencies. After you find a federal grantmaking agency that relates to 
your project idea, move over to Grants.gov to search for that specific agen-
cy’s grant funding opportunities, current and past. (See Chapter 5 for more 
on navigating Grants.gov.)
Seeking Business Expansion Monies
 
Foundations and corporations don’t provide grants to help you expand your 
business (or to help you start your business or pay off existing bills). If you 
aren’t operating in a high-technology area, you’re going to have to stay with 
your day job and start your business on a part-time basis. You may want to 
consider a loan from your bank as an alternate source of funding.

97
 Chapter 7: Finding Individual and Business Grant Opportunities
Or you may prefer to look into the business-expansion funding available 
through both federal and state governments. The following sections delve 
into these opportunities in more detail.
Looking into federal expansion funding
The federal government has two types of grants to help you expand your 
business if you’re working on research or a product that it’s interested in. 
The SBA’s Office of Technology administers the Small Business Innovation 
Research (SBIR) Program and the Small Business Technology Transfer 
(STTR) Program. Through these two competitive programs, the SBA ensures 
that the nation’s small, high tech, innovative businesses are a significant part 
of the federal government’s research and development efforts. Eleven federal 
departments participate in the SBIR program; five departments participate in 
the STTR program.
Phase I grants are awarded for as much as $100,000 by federal agencies. 
These funds must be used for research that will contribute to proving the 
scientific or technical feasibility of your approach or concept. Phase II grants 
are awarded for as much as $750,000 by federal agencies and must be used 
for your further principal research and development activities. Note: You 
must have received a Phase I grant award in order to be eligible to apply for a 
Phase II grant.
 
Monitor the SBA’s Web site (www.sba.gov) for announcements about techni-
cal assistance workshops and conferences around the country. I also recom-
mend fine-tuning your e-mail subscription on Grants.gov (you can read more 
about this Web site in Chapter 5) by typing in “SBIR” and “STTR” in the key-
word search for identifying grant funding opportunity announcements. Doing 
so allows you to limit your daily e-mail funding alert to only SBIR and STTR 
grant announcements.
Every state has an SBIR/STTR contact person appointed by the governor’s 
office. After you find an SBIR/STTR grant funding opportunity on Grants.
gov, there are two steps you must take immediately, since the deadline for 
researching and writing your grant application will be less than 60 days. 
Here’s what to do:
 
1. Download and print out the application announcement.
 
 This announcement will provide information on what will be funded and 
how to apply.
 
2. Call your governor’s office to locate the state’s SBIR/STTR contact 
person.

Part II: Identifying Key Grantmakers Worldwide 
 
 This individual will be able to connect you with experts in your research 
and development field who can help strategize your approach for fed-
eral funding. He won’t be able to write your application for you (that’s 
your job), but he will be able to tell you what the government is inter-
ested in funding and the best way to present your specific information in 
a competitive research and development grant application.
Here’s a list of the agencies that award SBIR grants:
 
✓ Department of Agriculture
 
✓ Department of Commerce
 
✓ Department of Defense
 
✓ Department of Education
 
✓ Department of Energy
 
✓ Department of Health and Human Services
 
✓ Department of Homeland Security
 
✓ Department of Transportation
 
✓ Environmental Protection Agency
 
✓ National Aeronautics and Space Administration
 
✓ National Science Foundation
Following are the federal agencies that award STTR grants:
 
✓ Department of Defense
 
✓ Department of Energy
 
✓ Department of Health and Human Services
 
✓ National Aeronautics and Space Administration
 
✓ National Science Foundation
Tracking down your state’s business 
expansion funding opportunities
Every state has some type of economic stimulus fund to help with business 
and industry expansions. Turn to your state’s Department of Commerce as a 
starting point in your grant-information search. (Some states have changed 
this historical agency’s name to something different, so you may need to call 
your state capitol’s switchboard for the correct agency name.) For example, 
in Florida, the name of the State Department of Commerce has been changed 
to Enterprise Florida.

99
 Chapter 7: Finding Individual and Business Grant Opportunities
 
When you call your state agency to discuss your business’s expansion needs, 
make sure to tell them the name of your business, its products or services, 
the county in which you’re located, and why you need to expand (what’s the 
driving force behind growing larger?). Don’t waste their time with long-winded 
statements meant to impress the listener. Also, even if you hit a dead end 
(meaning there’s no funding), thank the listener for his or her time. After all, 
you can always use a friend in state government!
Here are some examples I found while perusing the Internet looking for busi-
ness expansion grants:
 
✓ In California, a small town’s redevelopment agency awarded multiple 
grants and loans ranging from $7,500 to $10,000 for business expansion, 
site improvements, property acquisition, and facility improvements 
to accommodate persons with disabilities (required by the American 
Disabilities Act).
 
✓ In 2007, Enterprise Florida awarded 18 grants to economic development 
authorities, regional and local chambers of commerce, and other non-
profit groups to support international business expansion. Some of the 
agencies awarded funds from Enterprise Florida may have had plans to 
regrant a portion of the monies received to businesses that were trying 
to expand from a national to an international market.
 
✓ In Massachusetts, the Massachusetts Technology Collaborative, which 
administers the Commonwealth’s Renewable Energy Trust Fund, offered 
financial assistance in the form of loans to support renewable energy 
companies entering or expanding within the manufacturing stage of 
commercial development.
 
✓ In Michigan, the Capital Access Program is one of the Michigan 
Economic Development Corporation’s innovative programs created to 
assist businesses with capital needs. It uses small amounts of public 
resources to generate private bank financing, providing small Michigan 
businesses access to bank financing that may not otherwise be avail-
able. Under the Capital Access Program, more than 10,650 loans have 
been provided to Michigan businesses throughout the past 20 years.
 
✓ In Missouri, a state grant funded infrastructure improvements to 
facilitate the expansion of a custom wood product manufacturer. 
The company used the $540,000 grant to retain eight employees and 
create another six new jobs as it doubled the size of its facility to meet 
increased sales volume.
 
✓ In Nebraska, the Department of Economic Development provided 
$505,000 in Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funding to a 
city to help a private company expand beef-packing operations.
 
✓ In New York State, Empire State Development, the state’s economic 
development agency, awarded a $200,000 grant to a seed company for 
business expansion.

100
Part II: Identifying Key Grantmakers Worldwide 
These are just a few possibilities. You can find more by firing up your com-
puter and searching for the not-so-well-advertised grant monies available 
from one or more of your state’s grantmaking agencies. Call your governor’s 
office, the local Chamber of Commerce or Economic Development Authority, 
and even local banks to see whether they have grants, loans, or other fund-
ing resources to help you expand your business. After all, an expanded busi-
ness creates more jobs, puts more payroll into the community’s coffers, and 
contributes to your state’s economic stability. Type, click, and call. Consider 
these words your marching orders!

I
f you’re providing programs and/or services in a national or interna-
tional arena, you’re likely working for a foreign-based Nongovernmental 
Organization (NGO). NGO status is awarded by foreign governments and 
defines your organization as a charity that isn’t related to any government 
agency in the country from which you’ve received NGO approval. Currently, 
more than 40,000 national NGOs and hundreds of thousands of international 
NGOs are in existence. NGOs can apply for grant funding from foreign gov-
ernments, foundations, and corporations, as well as from U.S.-based funding 
sources. It’s the best of both worlds.
Ensuring You’re Eligible 
for International Grants
Read no further if you’re writing grants for a U.S.-based nonprofit organi-
zation with no programs or activities in other countries. You shouldn’t 
approach funders outside the United States, because funding agencies in 
other countries have specific funding priorities that are related to programs 
in their countries of interest.
If you do (or will) have nonprofit programs or activities outside the U.S., you 
must file for NGO status in every country where your organization currently 
operates (or plans to operate). Unlike the U.S., where the Internal Revenue 
Service can grant 501(c)(3) nonprofit status within all 50 states, you must file 
for NGO status or register with each individual country’s national taxation 

102
Part II: Identifying Key Grantmakers Worldwide 
authority. (Note: The title of this agency varies from country to country.) 
After you receive approvals, you can use your NGO letter when seeking grant 
funding in each specific country.
 
Get your organizational information together in advance to speed up the NGO 
approval process. Each country will likely want to see a written description 
of your organization’s purpose and programs, and maybe even multiyear 
financial data.
 
After you have your NGO approval letters in hand from each country, make 
multiple copies or scan them into an electronic file. If you lose this letter or 
mistakenly attach your only copy to a grant proposal, it may take months or 
years to obtain another official copy.
Researching International Funding 
Opportunities Online
You can never quite know when an international funder will go bust. One 
day it’s there, the next it’s not. This instability is due to fragile conditions in 
the countries where these funders operate. The good news, though, is that 
you can save yourself some time and money by using the Internet to locate 
funders outside the United States.
In order to make the most of your Internet search for international funding 
opportunities, you first need to be able to recognize the two main types of 
foundations:
 
✓ Corporate: A corporate foundation is a nonprofit entity formed with the 
profits or proceeds from a company (a corporation).
 
✓ Independent: An independent foundation isn’t affiliated with a corpora-
tion. Rather, it was founded by an individual, a group of individuals, or a 
family.
Most of the formal networks of grantmakers outside the U.S. are organiza-
tions that mirror the New York City–based Foundation Center, which was 
founded in 1956 and is the nation’s leading authority on philanthropy. The 
European Union has the European Foundation Centre, and Canada has 
Imagine Canada. Both of these information depositories publish details on 
corporate and independent foundations. I cover the European and Canadian 
groups, and a few other Web resources for international funding, in the fol-
lowing sections.

103
 Chapter 8: Scoping Out International Grants
The European Foundation Centre
The European Foundation Centre (EFC) is located in Brussels, Belgium, and 
features an in-depth knowledge base on more than 1,000 foundations and 
corporate funders that work in and with Europe. To access its searchable 
Funder Profile Database, you must use euros to purchase a subscription. 
After you’ve accessed the home page for the European Foundation Center, 
click on For Grantseekers and scroll down. You’ll see the link to Funders 
Online. Look for the Funders Online URL in the body of the paragraph under 
EFC Resources.
 
Funder profiles are descriptive statements about who a funder is, where 
they’re located, their contact person with title and e-mail or telephone 
number, funding priorities, grant application processes, and other “all about 
us” information. By carefully studying a funder’s profile, you can determine 
whether this funder is a perfect match for your project.
In the following sections, I highlight the great bits of info you can find by 
using the database and provide a sample of a real-life profile so you can see 
the value of this info for yourself.
Delving into details
So where does all this great data come from, anyway? Funder profiles are 
based on information collected from Web sites, annual reports, newsletters, 
grants lists, press releases, and other documents. In short, they’re the words 
of the funders themselves.
Checking out the EFC’s hard-copy resources
If you’d rather not browse the Internet for 
hours on end to find grant funding opportuni-
ties in Europe, you’ll be pleased to know that 
the European Foundation Centre (EFC) also 
provides hard-copy resources. The EFC’s vari-
ous hard-copy funding directories on a range of 
topic areas are produced from data found on its 
online Funder Profile Database. Following are 
some of the main hard-copy EFC publications, 
along with their publication years:
 ✓ Independent Funding, 2006
 ✓ Funding Vocational Training and Employ-
ment for People with Disabilities in Europe, 
2002
 ✓ Minorities and Multiculturalism, 2001
 ✓ Youth Funding in Europe, 2000

Web site (www.efc.be) are in euros. For 
help with converting dollars into euros and 
vice versa, check out “Converting Dollars into 
Foreign Currencies” later in this chapter.

Imagine Canada
Imagine Canada, a subscription-based funding database provider, is the 
result of a union of two of Canada’s leading charitable umbrella organiza-
tions: the Canadian Centre for Philanthropy (CCP) and the Coalition of 
National Voluntary Organizations (NVO).
Its most valuable online resource is the Canadian Directory to Foundations 
and Corporations. With more than 3,100 foundation listings, 150 corporation 
listings, and 90,000 indexed grants (a large list of grants awarded by the foun-
dations and corporations), the Directory is Canada’s largest and most accu-
rate bilingual fundraising database. Access to the Directory is priced based 
on your subscription level and your length of time as a subscriber. Annual 
subscriptions start at $375 and increase based on your access level.
The Directory contains the following information on potential funders:
 
✓ Address
 
✓ Contact person
 
✓ Funding interests
 
✓ Granting region
 
✓ Application procedure and deadline
 
✓ Board members
 
✓ Previous grant recipients

 Chapter 8: Scoping Out International Grants
Preparing to Approach 
an International Funder
Most international funders (independent foundations and corporations) 
insist that you contact them via e-mail or telephone to request their grant 
application guidelines and forms. Some may even query you about your proj-
ect, asking about location, population served, and what you intend to request 
from them.
 
Because the foundation landscape in Europe and the rest of the world is 
varied, the grant eligibility requirements and monetary differences from one 
country to the next also differ, making it crucial that you follow the proce-
dures laid out by each foundation. If you don’t follow the rules, you don’t get 
the grant — it’s that simple!
Do your homework before approaching a funder for support. Being prepared 
is the key to successful fundraising. Here’s a list of a few of the most impor-
tant steps to take in advance:
 
1. Familiarize yourself with the two types of main foundations: indepen-
dent and corporate.
 
 Jump to the section “Researching International Funding Opportunities 
Online,” earlier in this chapter for brief definitions of each type.
 
2. Find out the funder’s preferred language before you start writing.
 
 A German funder may prefer to see applications in English as opposed 
to German, for example.

Part II: Identifying Key Grantmakers Worldwide 
 
 If the preferred language isn’t English, you may want to consider using 
a translating service after you’ve written your letter of inquiry or grant 
application in English. The quickest way to find a translating service is 
to conduct a general Internet search. Just type in “Vietnamese transla-
tor” or whatever language you need. This type of search will find trans-
lators for any language. It always helps to ask for references from the 
translators as well. That way you get an idea of their work.
 
3. Follow the recommended method of initial approach, which should be 
spelled out in the foundation summary you find during your research.
 
 Unless you’re directed otherwise, your first contact should be a well-
written letter of inquiry (see Chapter 2 for instructions).
 
 Keep in mind that spelling is one of the adjustments you have to make 
when approaching European-based funding sources. Program may become 
programme, organization may become organisation, and center may 
become centre, just to name a few of the most common spelling quirks.
Converting Dollars into 
Foreign Currencies
When you’re preparing the budget section of your international funding 
request, write it first (in draft form, of course) using U.S. currency for all the 
monetary figures. Then prepare a budget page and budget narrative detail 
using the current currency for the grantmaker’s country. (For more about 
preparing budgets, flip to Chapter 17.)
Figure 8-1 is an example of an online e-grant application template from the 
Commonwealth Foundation (headquartered in London). Note that in the 
Programme area and cost section, you’re asked to enter your project cost or 
grant request in GBP Sterling. GBP stands for the British Pound (£).
Following are just a few of the various monetary conversion Web sites out 
there these days, so let your fingers do the typing to convert U.S. Dollars 
(USD) to GBP, or any other type of currency desired:
 
✓ www.xe.net/ucc
 
✓ finance.yahoo.com/m3?u
 
✓ www.oanda.com/converter/classic
 
✓ www.x-rates.com/calculator.html
 
Make sure that your conversion is accurate, or you may be shortchanged if 
you win the grant.

n this part, I tell you how to read federal grant 
announcements. I provide the skinny on the must-
know terms, and I show you how to work the numbers 
game when it comes to figuring your chances of winning a 
grant competition. I also cover pre-reviews, peer review-
ers, and the secret to writing winning contract bids. In a 
nutshell, this part shows you how to play the federal 
grantseeking game with knowledge and skill. Along the 
way, you can pick up some helpful tips and skills that 
apply to all types of funding requests.

Chapter 9
Using Your Resources to Win 
Government Grants and Contracts
In This Chapter
▶ Assessing a federal grant funding opportunity announcement
▶ Taking review criteria to heart
▶ Doing research the right way
▶ Bringing third-party evaluators on board
▶ Knowing what you need for contract proposals
T
his chapter takes a close look at the most important part of a federal 
grant funding opportunity announcement — the details about the grant 
competition, including the information that’s required to beat out the best 
of the best. I’m talking about skimming through the funding opportunity 
announcement first and then eyeballing the review criteria. The review crite-
ria is the point-based rating system that a government agency uses to decide 
whether your grant or cooperative agreement application — section by sec-
tion — cuts the mustard and is recommended for funding.
All government funding agencies publish guidelines that spell out the type of 
grant or cooperative agreement application that they expect grant seekers 
to submit. The guidelines and the review points assigned to each section of 
the grant or cooperative agreement narrative set the stage for what you must 
write and establish the point value of a chart-topping response.
Understanding the review criteria can help you determine whether the grant 
funding opportunity is one you should invest time and effort in pursuing. 
After all, if you can’t fully meet key criteria, there’s no reason to go after the 
grant or the Request for Proposal (RFP). Likewise, if you can meet all the cri-
teria, then following the guidelines closely gives you a much better chance of 
receiving the points needed for recommendation.

114
Part III: Playing and Winning the Grants Game 
Paying attention to the grant funding opportunity announcement, writing 
expectation details, and adhering to the formatting guidelines are as impor-
tant as finding the right funding source and using compelling language. 
You must read and reread every sentence of a grant funding opportunity 
announcement before you start. Then you need to get out your magnifying 
glass and read the grant application guidelines, which includes the peer 
review or evaluation criterion.
In this chapter, I cover everything you need to know to say yea or nay to a 
possible grant funding opportunity and to increase your peer review points 
in order to win the grant funding from the federal government. I also touch 
on pursuing contract opportunities such as RFPs.
Eyeballing a Federal Grant 
Funding Announcement
Suppose you receive an e-mail alert on a grant or cooperative agreement 
opportunity from a federal funding agency, and you think that you have a 
chance to win the grant. But you don’t know where to start or whether the 
grant’s really worth going for. In this section, I walk you through the essentials 
of determining whether this is the right competition for you. I also give you a 
quick lesson in “Grantlish,” the art of talking about grants, so that you have a 
better understanding of the review criteria language and terms. (See Chapter 
3 for the full scoop on understanding funding terms and requirements.)
Reading funding announcements to decide 
whether to pursue an opportunity
A new era has arrived. Toss out your copies of old Federal Registers, and don’t 
bother even looking up the cumbersome daily document online. Instead, cruise 
over to www.grants.gov. It’s the must-have online database of all federal grant 
funding opportunities. You can even subscribe to a few state-level grant funding 
announcements. (Refer to Chapter 5 for more information on Grants.gov.)
Don’t forget, you also need to sign up at Grants.gov for your free e-mail alerts. 
If you think you have a lot of e-mail now, just wait until you start receiving 
the Grants.gov daily “here’s the money” list. It’s detailed and filled with copy 
and paste Web addresses where you can read full funding announcements — 
not just a few lines of detail. This site is the beginning of your journey to read 
about each grant program’s application guidelines and the peer review crite-
ria that will determine if you win or lose.

115
 Chapter 9: Using Your Resources to Win Government Grants and Contracts
When you receive the e-mail from Grants.gov, you’ll see a listing of potential 
grant funding announcements. Here’s an example of an alert entry:
DOT
U.S. Department of Transportation
DOT – Office of Aviation Analysis
FY 2008 Small Community Air Service Development Program Grants
www07.grants.gov/search/search.do?mode=VIEW&oppId=41143
When you copy and paste the Web address included in the announcement 
into your Internet browser, you’ll be directed to a synopsis of the announce-
ment and to a link to the full application document. You can quickly cruise 
through the summary of the announcement to look for information that can 
be best called red stop flags and green go flags. Here are the steps to take 
when you’re cruising through the summary:
 
1. Look for the number of grants that will be awarded.
 
 For the previous sample synopsis regarding Small Community Air 
Service Development Program Grants, the expected number of awards is 
40. This is a green go flag.
 
 When would this be a red stop flag? It would be a stop if the funder 
were going to award fewer than ten grants. Why? Well, look at it this 
way: There are 50 states, 4 unincorporated organized territories, and 
336 federally recognized Indian Tribes. All of these entities are eligible 
grant applicants who will compete for all Federal grant monies. Do the 
math! Do you really have a fighting chance at winning one of ten or fewer 
federal grants when you’re going up against multiple eligible grant appli-
cants from states, territories, and Tribes? Probably not!
 
2. Determine the grant application deadline.
 
 In the sample DOT announcement, the closing date for applications is 
66 days from the date of the grant funding opportunity announcement. 
This is a green go flag. If you’re going to successfully research and write 
a winning government grant application, you need time on your side. 
Any deadline that’s 30 or more days from the date of the grant funding 
opportunity announcement is definitely appealing.
 
 If this is your first attempt at a government grant, look for a closing date 
that allows you at least 30 days for researching and writing. Having less 
than three weeks to write your first federal grant may be overwhelm-
ing unless you can devote 100 percent of your work time to the grant. 
Normal writing time for a federal grant is 40 to 100 hours, and research 
can add up to another 20 to 40 hours. So give yourself ample time — 
even if you’re a veteran grant writer.

3. Find out the total estimated funding available for grant awards.
 
 In the DOT example, the estimated total program funding is $10 mil-
lion. Because the expected number of awards is 40, this means that 
a 12-month grant award could easily average $250,000 each. This is a 
green go flag! In fact, I am ready to apply for these funds myself.
At this point, you can proceed to the link for the full funding announcement 
(the application guidelines), or you can continue to read the synopsis for the 
rest of the story. Remember, the rest of the picture is about who’s eligible to 
apply and what priorities and activities the grant monies will fund.
Knowing whether you’re eligible and 
ready to enter the competition
Before you forge ahead and start to research and write a government grant 
application, you must first determine whether you’re eligible for the competi-
tion and whether you’re actually ready to start competing. Doing so will help 
you decide whether you should take the plunge or not.
Determining your eligibility
Are you eligible for that fabulous funding opportunity you just came across? 
Before you conclude that the grant or cooperative agreement matches your 
needs, check out the eligibility paragraph in the funding synopsis or full 
announcement. Make sure that your organization is eligible to apply for these 
federal funds. Otherwise you’ll waste a lot of time working on an application 
that will no doubt be rejected. Here’s a sampling of what you’ll see when you 
look under the Eligible Applicants section of the synopsis or full announcement:
1. Eligible Applicants
You may submit (an) application(s) if your organization has any of the fol-
lowing characteristics:
For-profit organizations
Nonprofit organizations
Public or private institutions, such as universities, colleges, hospitals, and 
laboratories
Units of state government
Units of local government
 
If your organization is eligible, you’ve just scored another green go flag! If 
not, don’t give up; look for a potential partnering organization that’s eligible 
to apply, and then contact that organization as soon as possible to see if it’s 

117
 Chapter 9: Using Your Resources to Win Government Grants and Contracts
interested in being the grant applicant and fiscal agent. What’s your role in 
this situation? You’re considered a subcontracted and funded partner agency. 
Remember, it’s important to scoop up all possible federal grant monies, 
whether you’re eligible or not. After all, there’s a way to proceed at full speed 
in building financial sustainability for your organization.
Making sure you’re ready to take the plunge
After you’re sure of your eligibility, you have to ask yourself whether your 
organization is ready to start competing for a specific grant award opportu-
nity. It’s also important to decide whether you’re willing to fulfill the grant 
program’s purpose after the organization is funded. When you click on 
the full grant funding announcement link (found in the synopsis), look for 
the Purpose of Funding statement, which tells you exactly what the funding 
agency plans to fund.
Here are some examples of some really great Purpose of Funding statements:
 
✓ U.S. Department of Health and Human Services: “This announcement 
solicits applications for the Grants to States to Support Oral Health 
Workforce Activities Program to support a one year cycle for devel-
oping a planning report to be used to improve the State’s oral health 
workforce and service delivery infrastructure for the underserved. This 
program is designed to help States address demonstrated oral health 
workforce needs.”
 
✓ U.S. Environmental Protection Agency: “The aim of this funding is to 
support innovative ideas with the goal of fostering positive change. 
Projects may include studies, surveys, investigations, demonstrations, 
training, and public education programs. All demonstration projects 
must demonstrate applications, technologies, methods or approaches 
that are new, innovative or experimental.”
 
✓ U.S. Department of Agriculture: “The purposes of the Rural Youth 
Development (RYD) program are to: Support programs which address 
needs of rural youth and involve those youth in design and implementa-
tion of their educational activities. RYD funded programs can be deliv-
ered in-school and/or during out-of-school time, but should be in the 
context of connecting the formal classroom to real-life experience and 
vice versa.”
If, after reading through your selected federal funding opportunity Purpose of 
Funding statements, you find that one or more fits your organization’s long-
range plan for program development or expansion, you have a green go flag.
 
If your organization has no experience in any of these programming areas, and 
you only want to apply for easy money, be aware that your ability to fulfill the 
purpose on receipt of funding may be limited. This would definitely signal a 
red stop flag.

118
Part III: Playing and Winning the Grants Game 
 
When you start writing your program design (purpose of funding request, 
goals, objectives, implementation plan, logic model, management plan, and 
evaluation plan), remember to incorporate key words and phrases from 
the grant announcement’s Purpose of Funding statement. During the grant 
review process, this strategy helps peer reviewers clearly make a connection 
between the purpose of the grant and your needs statement and program 
design — which should fit like a soft leather glove to the federal language. (See 
Chapter 15 for more about program design.) This approach of “parroting” the 
funding agency’s own words results in receiving high review points — starting 
you down the road to getting a funding award! Just make sure that your target 
population fits the one described in the Purpose of Funding statement.
Recognizing must-know terms
All federal grant and cooperative agreement announcements use two types 
of terms: general and program-specific. General terms are words or phrases 
that appear in all funding announcements. Program-specific terms are words 
or phrases that are used in connection with a particular program. Knowing 
both types of terms and using them correctly throughout your grant applica-
tion increases your review criteria points and your chances of getting grant 
recommendations.
Getting the gist of general terms
Knowing Grantlish terms, whether general or funder-specific, can help you 
understand what the funding agency is talking about in the grant or coopera-
tive agreement announcement. If you’ve only been schooled in oranges and 
the funding agency writes its entire announcement in apples, you’ll be lost 
if you don’t understand the key terms used. Some key terms that you may 
encounter in grant announcements include the following:
 
✓ Budget period: The interval of time into which a multiyear period of 
assistance (the project or budget funding period) is divided for budget-
ary and funding purposes. For example, a large percentage of federal 
grants start on the first day of the federal fiscal year, October 1, and the 
funding period for grants awarded on October 1 ends on September 31 
of the following year.
 
✓ Nonprofit organization: Any organization (including a community devel-
opment corporation) exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the 
Internal Revenue Code.
 
✓ Project period: The total time a project is approved for support, includ-
ing any extensions. This time period can range from 12 months to 60 
months.

119
 Chapter 9: Using Your Resources to Win Government Grants and Contracts
 
✓ Third party: Any individual, organization, or business entity (different 
from your partners) that isn’t the direct recipient of grant funds but will 
subcontract with the grantee to carry out specified activities in the plan 
of operation.
 
✓ Third-party arrangement: An arrangement in which your agency could 
be the third party or another agency could be the third party in the 
grant or cooperative agreement application.
 
 Check out this example of a third-party arrangement: Say you find a 
competition that fits your organization, which is a four-year public uni-
versity that grants degrees in aeronautical science specialties. However, 
under the eligibility section of this grant opportunity, only two-year 
community colleges can apply for these funds. So you contact several 
community colleges in your state, region, and throughout the U.S. to ask 
whether they plan to apply for these federal funds. You find a poten-
tial partner and ask whether you can meet and plan a 2 + 2 transfer 
program where their students would complete the first two years of 
general courses and introductory to aeronautics programming at their 
institution and then transfer to your university for the remainder of 
their four-year degree program. When you have a working Memoranda 
of Understanding (MOU) or Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), you’re 
ready to start negotiating your piece of the financial pie — a place in the 
Contractual section of the budget summary and detail. In other words, 
your university is on its way to become a third-party contractor. Refer 
to the later section “Gathering partners for your proposal: The more, the 
merrier” for more on MOUs and MOAs.
 
✓ Third-party agreement: A written agreement entered into by the grantee 
and an organization, individual, or business entity (including a wholly 
owned subsidiary).
Seeking out specific terms
Every government program, both federal and state, has its own specific terms 
and definitions. These program-specific terms appear in the grant application 
guidelines.
 
Each government agency provides its own definitions of the terms in the 
grant funding opportunity announcement (see the earlier section “Knowing 
whether you’re eligible and ready to enter the competition”). Use the same 
terms as those published in the announcement when you write your grant 
application. By using each agency’s terms and its definitions, you meet the 
basic requirement of the review criteria — showing that you understand the 
Feds’ language.

120
Part III: Playing and Winning the Grants Game 
Gathering partners for your proposal: 
The more, the merrier
Some funding guidelines give favorable consideration (and thus more review 
criteria points) to applicants who can get cash or in-kind (noncash) contri-
butions from partner organizations. Here are the two types of partners you 
might connect with:
 
✓ Community partners are usually nonprofit organizations or businesses 
that your program works with on a regular basis to provide services to 
your constituency. Select community partners when your only need is a 
letter of support (see Chapter 3).
 
✓ Collaborative partners are government, social, and human services 
agencies at local, state, and regional levels that use their resources 
to help your organization better deliver the services funded by the 
grant. Select collaborative partners when you need an ongoing work-
ing relationship in order to implement the grant-funded activities. 
Collaborative partners help draft and then sign elaborate Memorandums 
of Understanding or Agreement (MOUs and MOAs), which are working 
agreements that spell out the scope of services that will be performed 
by the partner agency and by the grant applicant (that’s you).
 
 Some funding agencies request that you attach MOUs or MOAs to the 
funding request in the appendixes. Other funding agencies simply 
require that the documents be on file with your organization and that 
they be accessible by the funding agency if monies are awarded. A MOU 
or MOA is treated like a legal document and should not be developed by 
a grant writer; this is a task for your executive director or legal staff.
 
 Federal funding agencies prefer to see MOUs or MOAs attached to your 
funding requests. Letters of support don’t carry the weight they used 
to a decade ago. So, if you’re still attaching letters of support instead of 
MOUs and MOAs, make the switch now.
When looking for a partner, look for an agency that already serves all or part 
of your target population. For example, an environmental group may not be a 
good partner if you’re trying to secure funding for an adult literacy program. 
Rather, an agency that focuses on retraining low-skilled, adult workers may 
be a perfect match. Also, make sure to select partners that have a history and 
background in your specific grant application area for each grant or coopera-
tive agreement you plan to pursue.
 
Don’t limit yourself to just one partner — the more, the better. One partner 
will soon tire of your asking for monetary contributions, in-kind services, or 
repeated letters of support. With many partners, you can pick and choose the 
ones that have experience in the type of project you’re trying to get funded. 
The same partners you use in one funding application may not be the partners 
you select for the next application.

121
 Chapter 9: Using Your Resources to Win Government Grants and Contracts
Before you meet with a prospective partner, prepare a fact sheet on the grant 
program’s purpose and goals. Fax or mail a copy to each agency you plan to 
invite onto your team. This way, even before you meet face to face, the other 
agency can start thinking of ways to collaborate with your organization.
At your first meeting, ask for at least one of the following contributions:
 
✓ Cash-match monies: A commitment of actual cash in the form of a con-
tribution toward your proposed program’s expenses
 
✓ In-kind contributions: Donated personnel, office space, training space, 
transportation assistance, supplies, materials, printing services for 
classroom training use, and other needed items
If you receive a commitment for cash or in-kind contributions before you 
even write your grant application, you’ve already chalked up points with 
reviewers. In the eyes of those who hand out the money, having one or more 
partners gives you a huge advantage over any grant seeking organization 
without partners because partners mean that community resources will be 
maximized to benefit the target population.
 
Not having any partners could be detrimental to your grant application during 
the peer review process. I’m a federal peer reviewer, and when I come across 
a grant or cooperative agreement application with no listed partners, I deduct 
review points from the program design section. A loss of five or more points in 
any section can result in your application not making the cut for funding. The 
typical make-or-break score is 92 points — that is, if you fail to score 92 out of 
100 possible points on your funding request, you won’t be recommended for 
federal funding support.
Perusing the Review Criterion Section
When you click on the link in a grant funding opportunity announcement 
to access the full announcement, you’ll see the full-blown grant application 
guidelines document. Usually this is a PDF file. Scroll down in the document 
to look for the Review Criterion section of the announcement. (This section is 
also often called the Evaluation Criteria section.)
 
This section of the document cuts to the chase fast by showing you how each 
section of the grant application narrative will be rated. The Review Criterion 
section tells you — to the letter — exactly what the peer reviewers expect 
to read in a “winning” grant application. It also tells you the total number of 
possible points that a “winning” narrative section can earn during the peer 
review process.

122
Part III: Playing and Winning the Grants Game 
Using review point weights 
to guide your writing
Ninety-nine percent of most government grant application narratives are 
weighted for a total of 100 possible points. The most comprehensive writ-
ing section is the program design section. (See Chapter 15 for more on this 
important section.).
In the example that follows in this section, note that the largest point sec-
tion is the Program Design and Methodologies section, which weighs in at 
25 points. This means that program design is worth 25 percent of the entire 
grant application’s scoring schematic of 100 points. So you’ll want to take 
more time to research and write this section of your grant application nar-
rative. If the funding agency’s formatting instructions tell you that the grant 
application narrative can’t exceed 30 single-spaced pages, you’ll want to 
earmark 25 percent of the 30 pages (7.5 pages) for the Program Design and 
Methodologies section.
 
When you know the maximum number of pages that you’re allowed to write 
for the entire grant application narrative, you can take the total points (100 
points) and divide them by the points for each section. Translate this into a 
percent and you’ll know how many pages you need to write in each narrative 
section to fulfill the percent expectation for the number of pages that the peer 
reviewers expect to see when eyeballing your grant application.
In the following list, I note the maximum number of pages that you should 
write in each narrative section based on a 30-page narrative limitation. I also 
provide you with some of the questions that peer reviewers keep in mind 
when reading your application. Remember, the total possible peer review 
score for your grant application is 100 points. Here’s how it breaks down:
 
✓ Statement of Need, Site Location, and Scope of Project – 15 points (15 
percent of 30 pages equals 4.5 pages for this section): Does the appli-
cation specify those issues that will be addressed in this project from 
the list of issues facing the target population? Is it likely that this overall 
project will address the issues identified? Do they have the likelihood 
of successful outcomes? Will the target population be involved in the 
design and implementation of the project? Does the project meet the 
objectives of the funding and provide sufficient justification for funding 
the proposal?
 
✓ Outcomes and Indicators – 15 points (15 percent of 30 pages equals 
4.5 pages for this section): Is each outcome articulated? Are the indica-
tors that were selected appropriate to measure the intended outcomes? 
Are outcomes and indicators written in clear, concise, complete, mea-
surable, and logically arranged statements? Are they sufficiently linked 
to the goals of the project, based on research, and supported with a ref-
erence citation?

123
 Chapter 9: Using Your Resources to Win Government Grants and Contracts
 
✓ Program Design and Methodologies – 25 points (25 percent of 30 
pages equals 7.5 pages for this section): Will program designs and strat-
egies likely produce the articulated indicators to meet the outcomes 
established for the project? Are the scope and duration of programs 
adequate to produce positive outcomes? Will programs link formal and 
non-formal education? Is the appropriate research base used to support 
the selected educational design and activities?
 
✓ Evaluation Methodologies – 10 points (10 percent of 30 pages equals 
3 pages for this section): Are the evaluation designs and methodologies 
adequate to measure the extent to which program indicators and out-
comes are being met?
 
✓ Communication Plan – 5 points (5 percent of 30 pages equals 1.5 pages 
for this section): Are there clear and acceptable strategies to communi-
cate the results from this project to stakeholders and the public?
 
✓ Project Management – 5 points (5 percent of 30 pages equals 1.5 
pages for this section): Is there evidence of strong and adequate proj-
ect management, including key staff and their functions, timelines, 
accounting procedures, reporting, and collaborative efforts with the 
partner organizations?
 
✓ Budget – 5 points (5 percent of 30 pages equals 1.5 pages for this 
section): Is there an appropriate amount of money allocated to each 
key activity/task? Is the total budget allocation adequate to reach 
project goals?
 
✓ Success of Community Projects – 20 points (20 percent of 30 pages 
equals 6 pages for this section): Have previously funded projects 
achieved the target population outcomes? Has community capital 
investment increased as a result of past projects? Do previous evalua-
tion findings provide sufficient evidence that the outcomes were met? 
What process was used to obtain feedback from community stakehold-
ers? Was this feedback incorporated into the final evaluation reports?
Earning bonus points by creating 
a cost-effective program
You can get an edge on the competition by proposing a cost-effective 
program. Here’s how the government defines cost-effective: Your cost to 
serve each program participant is less than the maximum allowed cost-per-
participant. Your cost to serve is calculated by dividing the number of 
persons your program will serve into the total amount of federal funds 
requested. The resulting number must be at or under the maximum allow-
able federal amount. In some federal grant competitions, five review criteria 
points can be earned for having a cost-effective project. Similarly, five points 
can be deducted from the total 100 points for not having a cost-effective 
project.

124
Part III: Playing and Winning the Grants Game 
Researching Your Request
Knowing the grant’s or cooperative agreement’s intent or focus sets the 
direction for the type of research you must do in order to write a high-scoring 
competitive grant application. For example, if the monies are intended to 
open employment and training centers in the Mississippi Delta region, then 
you need to research demographics on the unemployed and underemployed 
in the counties along the Mississippi Delta.
Using the Internet, you can get a jump-start on your grant or cooperative 
agreement application by searching for existing programs in the area of the 
competition. In the Mississippi Delta example, you would conduct an Internet 
search (using a search engine) for all existing employment and training pro-
grams. You would review what they offer, who they provide services for, and 
how successful their intervention model is in reducing unemployment and 
poverty in the Mississippi Delta. Remember, tons of programs are out there. 
Your job is to decide which programs look like the kind you want to propose 
in your funding request.
Start researching the target population’s demographics in your state and 
region — those counties or parishes that make up your Metropolitan 
Statistical Area (MSA). Call state and local agencies that provide services to 
the targeted groups and ask for reports that provide demographics on this 
target population.
 
After I collect all my research, I sort it into stacks according to the types of 
information it is. I have one stack for statistics or demographics, another stack 
for model programs, and another stack for evaluations of model programs. 
With this arrangement, I can start writing my grant or cooperative agreement 
application narrative and pull research from one stack at a time. (See Chapter 
10 for how to pull all your research together for the funding application.)
Finding Third-Party Evaluators Early 
in the Grant Writing Process
Writing an application for a federal grant or cooperative agreement requires 
making new friends in your community — not only community partners 
(covered earlier in this chapter) but also community specialists such as eval-
uators. You can always score higher review points by using an outside evalua-
tor, who’s basically a person or organization that can operate in an objective 
mode and give you factual, nonemotional feedback on your grant-funded 
goals and objectives.

125
 Chapter 9: Using Your Resources to Win Government Grants and Contracts
As a federal grant reviewer, I’m more likely to award high review points for 
the evaluation plan when a third-party evaluator is proposed. Even though 
evaluators are paid from grant funds, I know that they will call the shots as 
they see them when it comes to helping grant applicants develop data collec-
tion tools, collect and interpret data, and compile comprehensive evaluation 
reports for funders and other stakeholders. (I talk about the evaluation pro-
cess in depth in Chapter 15.)
 
The following folks make excellent outside evaluators:
 
✓ Retired college or university faculty. Often, these individuals have par-
ticipated in the grant writing process and have even helped their college 
or university development offices design evaluations for government 
grant applications.
 
✓ Retired government personnel who have worked in an administrative 
capacity in a finance department.
 
✓ Evaluation consultants. These people normally have years of experience 
just in the field of evaluation.
 
 Try calling your local community foundation for consultant recommen-
dations. Community foundations often use evaluation consultants to 
assist in evaluating their own programs.
As far as timing’s concerned, I think it’s essential to bring in an evaluator 
when you’re sitting down with your staff and your community partners to plan 
what will be proposed in the grant or cooperative agreement application.
 
Running an online search for outside evaluators is also helpful, but you may 
not locate an evaluator close to home. It’s okay to use an evaluator who 
doesn’t live in your city or town as long as he or she is familiar with the area.
Understanding RFP Review 
Criteria for Contract Bids
If you own a business and plan to start bidding on contract opportunities, 
you need to familiarize yourself with the standard review criteria language 
for contract bidding documents.
The language in contract bidding documents often is intimidating to businesses 
that are vying for a public or private sector contract to provide services or 
goods. (I tend to refer to this language as legalese.)

126
Part III: Playing and Winning the Grants Game 
When a company issues an opportunity to bid on a contract, which is often 
referred to as an RFP (Request For Proposal) or RFQ (Request for Quote), 
you must be able to quickly scan the technical proposal and cost proposal 
requirements to determine whether your business can deliver the requested 
services or goods. These bidding opportunity announcements, which contain 
all the instructions for submitting your contract bidding document, don’t just 
magically appear on your desk. You have to aggressively search the classified 
advertising sections of your local and regional newspapers and look for the 
legal announcements section, which is where companies place their RFP or 
RFQ announcements.
You’re looking for announcements that match your products or services, and 
when you find one, you need to call the agency or business to request a copy 
of the actual RFP or RFQ. Any government agency or business issuing an RFP 
or RFQ likes to keep close track of who requests copies. After you’re on an 
agency’s mailing list, you may automatically receive notices of future RFPs 
and RFQs.
Here’s an example of a legal advertisement announcing an RFP:
Legal Advertisement
Request for Proposal (RFP) for Wetlands and Water Quality 
Engineering Services
Solicitation #: DOT 08014
The Department of Transportation (DOT) is seeking expressions of inter-
est from consulting firms to provide on-call services to provide profes-
sional engineering services related to wetland and water quality services 
for transportation projects. The selected team will be required to have 
a comprehensive understanding of wetland and water quality services 
relative to highway, multi-modal transportation projects, and a thorough 
knowledge of Federal Highway Administration guidelines and DOT’s 
policies and procedures. During the course of the contract, work will be 
solicited only as the need arises.
For RFP package, contact: DOT Procurement Officer, Lara Scott at 555-
555-5555.
Closing date for bids: November 21 at 5 p.m. EST.
 
As you peruse a hard copy of the full RFP or RFQ document, highlight the sec-
tions listed below and read them several times to ensure that you understand 
what the bid-letting agency is asking for and what you have to return in your 
RFP or RFQ bid package to meet the agency’s review criteria and ultimately 
qualify for a contract award. The following RFP and RFQ sections are listed in 
the order that you’re likely to see them in the RFP or RFQ document:

127
 Chapter 9: Using Your Resources to Win Government Grants and Contracts
 
✓ Cover Form: Contains the name and contact information of the solic-
iting agency; the solicitation number (an internal bid-letting agency 
number issued for internal record-keeping purposes), issue date, 
due date, and time due; and whether or not it’s a set-aside contract. 
(Government agencies earmark, or set aside, a portion of their annual 
contracts for businesses that are small, disadvantaged, or owned by 
minorities or women.)
 
✓ Supplies or Services & Price and Costs: Spells out, in excruciating 
detail, the types of products or services that the solicitor (RFP or RFQ-
issuing agency) is seeking to purchase and the price or cost parameters 
the solicitor must work within.
 
✓ Statement of Work: Tells you the work tasks to be performed. This sec-
tion contains numerically ordered tasks and deliverables (time frames 
for when each task must be completed). Depending on the soliciting 
agency, you may find multiple deliverables for one task.
 
✓ Cost Proposal: Tells you how the bid-letting agency plans to pay for 
services. For example, the cost proposal section may lay out advance 
payments each month or cost reimbursement payments after your 
invoice and expenses receipts have been received, reviewed, and 
approved by the bid-letting agency.
 
✓ Deliveries or Performance: Spells out the length of the contract.
 
✓ Level of Effort: Tells how many hours of service are expected during the 
contract award period.
 
✓ Instructions, Conditions, and Notices to Offerors: Explains the condi-
tions that your company or agency is obligated to fulfill if you’re given 
a contract award. This section scares away most potential bidders 
because it’s a lot of small print typing full of legalese!
 
✓ Evaluation Factors for Award: Tells you how the solicitor rates or evalu-
ates each section of the RFP or RFQ narrative response.
 
 Use this section as a guide when you write your narrative response (see 
Chapter 10 for more on writing to meet the peer review criteria). For the 
sections with higher point values, you garner greater solicitor attention 
when your narrative uses buzzwords taken from the RFP or RFQ guide-
lines language.

Writing to Convince Peer 
Reviewers to Give You 
the Maximum Points
In This Chapter
▶ Formatting your application properly
▶ Understanding the peer review process
▶ Discovering the best ways to read guidelines and write your application
▶ Taking advantage of federal publications
▶ Becoming a peer reviewer
C
onsider the grant writing process: You first receive an e-mail alert 
from Grants.gov and find a grant opportunity announcement match-
ing your program’s funding needs. Then you carefully screen the funding 
competition and determine that your organization is eligible to apply, that 
the number of grants awarded is more than ten, and that the average grant 
award is more than sufficient to cover your proposed project’s cost. (See 
Chapter 9 for more on this step.) By this time, your partner organizations 
also are on board, and the third-party evaluator has agreed to be included 
in the grant request.
Now that everything’s falling into place, you’re ready to start writing your 
grant application narrative. This chapter details the writing process based on 
standard government agency review criteria. Remember that writing to meet 
a grant application’s review criteria is as important as identifying the right 
funding source and preparing your response.
 
The basics of review criteria apply to all types of grant guidelines. Because 
government guidelines are the most rigid, I use them as my example through-
out this chapter. Trust me: You can write anything if you can write government 

130
Part III: Playing and Winning the Grants Game 
grant application narratives (also called cooperative agreements) and Request 
For Proposal, or RFP, narratives (also known as contract bids made by a busi-
ness, which is also referred to as a for-profit).
Succeeding in the Technical Review 
Process with the Right Formatting
When you first submit a grant application or RFP response to a federal 
agency for funding consideration, your application goes through a technical 
review process (or simply pre-review). This pre-review includes checking to 
see whether you’ve completed and signed all the required forms. The pre-
review process also verifies your compliance with formatting instructions 
and checks the page length of your narrative. Many government grant and 
cooperative agreement applications as well as RFPs have narrative length 
restrictions, such as no more than 20 double-spaced pages. If you fail to pass 
one of the pre-review mandatory checks, your application doesn’t move from 
the pre-review phase to the peer review phase.
 
The lesson here is to always read the grant application or RFP guidelines, 
and then be sure to follow the instructions for forms and formatting — to

Formatting criteria for grant applications
When you first read a grant or cooperative agreement opportunity announce-
ment (refer to Chapter 9 for more on these announcements), some basic 
information points can give you quick cues about how to set up your word 
processing software to correctly format the narrative.
As you read through the formatting instructions, find out what spacing is 
required, what type and size of font must be used, and whether pagination 
begins with the first form and ends with the last page in the appendixes or 
is limited to the narrative section of the request. The quicker you find these 
answers, the sooner you can get started with the writing process!
As part of the pre-review elimination process, funding agency program staff 
members first check your application to see that you followed the criteria 
exactly as it’s laid out. If you failed to follow the formatting instructions, your 
grant application will not advance to the peer reviewers.
 
In addition to the formatting requirements, there may be specific program-
matic requirements. To be sure of the requirements, check the actual funding 
announcement before preparing your application.

 Chapter 10: Writing to Convince Peer Reviewers to Give You the Maximum Points
The following are formatting requirements excerpted from a Substance Abuse 
and Mental Health Services Administration document. You can find the latest 
full version of the document by going to samhsa.gov/grants/apply.aspx 
and scrolling through the page. As you can see from these excerpts (there’s a 
lot more in the document), the requirements are very specific:
Type size in the Project Narrative cannot exceed an average of 15 charac-
ters per inch, as measured on the physical page. (Type size in charts, tables, 
graphs, and footnotes will not be considered in determining compliance.)
Text in the Project Narrative cannot exceed 6 lines per vertical inch. Paper 
must be white paper and 8.5 inches by 11.0 inches in size.
Applications would meet this requirement by using all margins (left, right, 
top, and bottom) of at least one inch each, and adhering to the page limit 
for the Project Narrative stated in the specific funding announcement.
Should an application not conform to these margin or page limits, the fund-
ing agency will use the following method to determine compliance: The 
total area of the Project Narrative (excluding margins, but including charts, 
tables, graphs and footnotes) cannot exceed 58.5 square inches multiplied 
by the page limit. This number represents the full page less margins, multi-
plied by the total number of allowed pages.
Space will be measured on the physical page. Space left blank within the 
Project Narrative (excluding margins) is considered part of the Project 
Narrative, in determining compliance.
Pages should be typed single-spaced in black ink, with one column per page. 
Pages should not have printing on both sides.
Please number pages consecutively from beginning to end so that informa-
tion can be located easily during review of the application. The cover page 
should be page 1, the abstract page should be page 2, and the table of con-
tents page should be page 3.
The page limits for Appendices stated in the specific funding announcement 
should not be exceeded.
Formatting criteria for contract bids
When you first open a contract bid package, you may feel overwhelmed by 
the forms and instructions. Remember to tackle the “first reading” process 
one page at a time. After you note the due date and time, look for formatting 
criteria. Do you have to fill in the bid-letting agency’s forms, or can you re-
create its forms with your word processor? Is there a particular font that you 
must type your response in, and are there restrictions on the font size? Make 
written notes on all technical requirements related to formatting. You can 
even highlight the specific formatting instructions or put sticky notes on the 
formatting-related pages in the RFP instructions.

132
Part III: Playing and Winning the Grants Game 
The following is an example of the type of criteria you see in an RFP. As part 
of the pre-review elimination process, reviewers check to see that you follow 
the criteria exactly.
Content and form of contract bid
1. Contract bids submitted to the state in a format other than the one 
requested will not progress beyond the initial technical review process.
2. The numerical outline for the bidding document, the titles/subtitles of the 
document, and the bidding organization will appear on the top right-hand 
corner of each page.
3. Page numbers must be consecutive beginning with the Table of Contents 
and ending with the Certifications and Assurances.
4. A written response is required for each item. Failure to answer any of the 
items will have an impact upon an applicant’s score.
5. The Technical Proposal and the Cost Proposal are separate documents 
and must be prepared and submitted separately. Failure to do so will result 
in an immediate rejection of the bidder’s proposal.
Getting the Skinny on the Peer Review
After you pass the pre-review (and I know you will!), your application or con-
tract bid is given to either a peer review panel (for grants and cooperative 
agreements) or a purchasing manager (for contract bids).
In the sections that follow, I give you all the info you need to know about the 
review process for grant and cooperative agreement applications and for 
contract bids.
Timing is everything!
Some contract bids must be received before a 
certain time on a specific day. For example, RFP 
instructions may tell you to submit your sealed 
bid (a bid sealed in a separate envelope inside 
the mailing envelope and marked with the RFP 
number and due date) by noon on July 10. If you 
rely on the regular mail and the mail delivery 
arrives at 12:30 p.m. at the bid-letting agency, 
you’re out of luck! Use courier delivery services 
and make sure to get your bid in at least a full 
day before the due date.

133
 Chapter 10: Writing to Convince Peer Reviewers to Give You the Maximum Points
Scoring grant applications
A peer review panel usually includes three experts from around the country 
who work in the field that the grant competition is directed to. It’s called peer 
review because you’re accepted or rejected by your peers, not by a govern-
ment program officer. Each reviewer gives a numerical score to each applica-
tion reviewed; in most instances, the scoring of your narrative is based on a 
total of 100 points. Explanatory statements on a formal rating form support 
the numerical score; for each section of the application’s review criteria 
(criteria that was published in the Grants.gov announcement), reviewers 
describe your application’s major strengths and weaknesses.
 
Some government agencies assign more than 100 points to the narrative sec-
tions of grant applications. Read every word in the guidelines so you know 
what to shoot for. You may need to write extra response sections to be con-
sidered eligible for the additional review points.
 
I can see you waving your hand, about to ask “How many pages do I have to 
write?” As a general guide, plan to write one page for every five review points 
assigned to each narrative section. (In the grant application or cooperative 
agreement guidelines, the section titled Review Criteria tells you how many 
review points are assigned to each section of the narrative.) For example, if 
the program design section carries 25 points, you should write five pages for 
that narrative. And remember to stay within the total narrative page limits. 
(See Chapter 9 for the inside scoop on peer review points.)
Normally, your grant application needs to score in the high 90s to make the 
cut (meaning you’re recommended for the grant award instead of rejected 
based on low scores from the three reviewers).
You may be asking what happens when two grant reviewers in the peer 
review rate you highly (92 or above) and the third reviewer rates you below 
the cutoff score for an award. Well, after each reviewer independently scores 
your application, they get together (over the telephone or in person) and 
discuss and defend their scores. The general rule is that all three review-
ers must come within ten points of each other in order for an application to 
go one way or the other; often, after discussion, application scores change, 
sometimes in your favor and sometimes not.
 
The length of time from the moment you submit your grant application for 
funding consideration to the time you receive notification of funding can range 
from three to six months, depending on the program and the number of appli-
cations it receives.

134
Part III: Playing and Winning the Grants Game 
Judging contract bids
For contract bids, your fate is in the hands of the agency’s Purchasing or 
Procurement Department. Most likely a purchasing manager or procurement 
officer is assigned to review your bid. The lowest bid doesn’t always win the 
contract, so use fair and profitable pricing for your services or products. It’s 
important to submit a bid that emits a high quality of services and goods 
from a reliable potential vendor (your company). The price is secondary 
when another bidder has shabby services and goods and a blue light special 
price. The latter proposal screams “buyer beware”!
 
Each agency has its own specific criteria for evaluating and awarding contract 
bids. Most RFPs don’t have specific review points, though. Instead, look 
for evaluation factors, which tell you how the contract will be evaluated for 
completeness.
Here’s an excerpt from an RFP Statement of Intent (the bid-letting agency 
intends to award contracts for the delivery of services) that shows you the 
breakdown of evaluation factors and percentage values for each factor:
EVALUATION FACTORS will be based on the following criteria in descend-
ing order of importance:
1. Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work 
required under this contract (30%)
2. Professional qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of 
required services (30%)
3. Past performance on public/private industry contracts in terms of cost 
control, quality of work and compliance with performance schedules (15%)
4. Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time (15%)
5. Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of 
the locality of the project (10%)
With contract bids, the purchasing manager or procurement officer makes 
the final decision. Contract bids are selected based on:
 
✓ Technical proposal
 
• Experience and background of the bidder or offeror
 
• Complete and thorough scope of services section
 
• Complete narrative responses to all other sections of the RFP 
narrative
 
• All forms filled in and signed, as instructed
 
• Supporting documentation attached, as instructed

135
 Chapter 10: Writing to Convince Peer Reviewers to Give You the Maximum Points
 
✓ Cost proposal
 
• Cost-effectiveness of amount needed to deliver the services or 
goods
 
• Accuracy of the budget line items and totals
Writing a successful RFP response means your company wins a contract 
award from a government agency or business. After you’re notified that your 
bid was selected, you may be required to enter into negotiations with the 
awarding agency. At this time, the scope of services or goods to be delivered 
may be changed, or the payment for the services or goods may be lessened.
 
Nothing’s set in stone — it’s up to the purchasing manager or procurement 
officer as to whether your company will receive a contract award. Hang in 
there and don’t give up. You know you’re on the way to a major contract 
award when you’re invited to sit down and talk “best and final” offers with the 
awarding agency. (See Chapter 3 for definitions of standard contract terms.)
Reading and Writing 
the Government Way
Read all guidelines for government grant applications, cooperative agree-
ments, and RFPs. Then read them again. In fact, I suggest you read them 
three times, focusing on different aspects with each review:
 
1. The first time through the guidelines, check for due dates, number of 
awards, average size of grants, and eligible applicants.
 
2. The second time through, look at the technical requirements. By techni-
cal requirements, I mean whether the grant competition requires that 
you submit your grant application to a state agency for preapproval 
before the final submission due date.
 
3. During the third review, read for narrative content requirements. The 
following sections walk you through the narrative content requirements 
for government funding applications (grants and cooperative agree-
ments) and contract bids so that you can understand what you should 
look for in content requirements.
 
Your government funding request or contract bid response (also called RFP 
narrative) should contain a lot of words and phrases that you cull from the 
grant application or RFP guidelines. Plan to use these terms in almost every 
section of your grant narrative; doing so shows that you’re familiar with the 
guidelines and that your program is in line with the grant or contract.

136
Part III: Playing and Winning the Grants Game 
Making your needs clearly known
One of the major sections in government grant narratives, and in most RFP 
documents, is the needs statement, which is usually an explanation of the 
problem you hope to address if you receive the grant or contract. Normally, 
when you’re writing a grant or cooperative agreement application, this sec-
tion is worth about 20 of the 100 points possible that can be granted by a 
review committee. (Jump to Chapter 14 for information on how to structure 
your needs statement.)
 
The needs statement is the place not only to write about your own research 
findings on the target population but also to bring in facts and figures from 
regional and national research. (See Chapter 9 for details on how to gather all 
the information you need before you start writing this part of your applica-
tion.) To win all the points allocated to this section, follow these tips:
 
✓ When it comes to federal grant and cooperative agreement applications, 
write about every problem you can unearth. Be sure to address what the 
problem is, when it started, and how you know it’s a problem.
 
✓ Always include results from recent community needs assessments. Doing 
so shows the funder that you’re basing your problem statement or needs 
statement on valid findings about your target population or community.
 
✓ Refer to the current lack of services or programs in your area.
 
✓ Don’t talk in generalities — use facts, statistics, quotes, and citations.
 
✓ Cite all your sources, and stay current — don’t use anything more than 
five years old.
 
✓ Show that you know what you’re talking about by comparing your prob-
lems to similar problems in other communities of your size.
In your needs statement, describe a large black hole of gloom and doom 
if that’s what you see based on the facts. You’re not exaggerating with the 
information you include in this section; you’re simply writing to meet the 
review criteria, and you’re addressing each point covered in the program’s 
or agency’s goals. For more on communicating needs, see Chapter 14.
Putting project design in 
a funder’s own terms
Another major section in a funding request narrative is what’s often referred 
to as the plan of operation. This section usually addresses the project design. 
In grant applications and cooperative agreement narratives, this section is 
usually weighted at 35 or 40 points in the review criteria. (However, remember 
that RFPs and contract bidding documents usually don’t have review points.)

137
 Chapter 10: Writing to Convince Peer Reviewers to Give You the Maximum Points
In order to receive the most points possible, the project design must be 
sound and must contain program elements directly linked to the achieve-
ment of project objectives. Therefore, you need to write in a way that uses 
the language of the government agency or contract-awarding agency’s own 
objectives. (See Chapter 15 for more about program design.)
In other words, the project design section includes your proposed project’s 
goals and objectives, which should reflect those of the government or con-
tracting agency. Give back to the government agency or contract-awarding 
agency reviewers the same language that’s used in the application or RFP 
announcement and in the guidelines for grant/RFP review criteria.
 
Always write measurable objectives that state who will be impacted, where 
they will be impacted, at what rate (in a percent), and by when (a specific time 
frame). Language concerning a time frame is optional in the objectives only 
when the grant application guidelines ask for a separate timeline section.
The objective stated in a grant announcement or RFP is like a big finger point-
ing in the direction that you need to write in order to win a grant or contract 
award. The objective shouts out to you, “Write me, write me!” For more about 
goals and objectives, flip to Chapter 15.
Communicating your evaluation plan
A sound evaluation plan, the next major part of your narrative, is essential 
to winning big review points. This section can be scored from 5 to 15 points. 
When writing about the evaluation of your project, you explain how you pro-
pose to answer key questions about how effectively the grant-funded project 
was implemented or how efficiently the contracted services were delivered. 
You must provide a clear plan for answering the following key questions:
 
✓ How will the results of your evaluation be shared with stakeholders?
 
✓ What data collection tools will you use to measure qualitative and 
quantitative data?
 
✓ What’s the frequency of the data collection processes?
 
✓ What qualitative and quantitative measures will you collect data on?
 
✓ Who will conduct the evaluation?
 
If you brought in your third-party evaluator during the planning stages of 
your project or service, she’s on board as a member of the narrative writing 
team. The evaluator can write the entire evaluation plan section because she 
should be an expert in gleaning a program design and quickly developing 
research-driven evaluation plans. Spending some of your agency’s dollars 
to secure this individual early on is the best strategy because you want to 
receive all the points in this section. Head to Chapter 15 for more specific 
information and tips on evaluations.

138
Part III: Playing and Winning the Grants Game 
Showing that you’re capable
The project management and overall organizational capability section of 
your grant application or cooperative agreement narrative usually carries the 
same weight as the problem or needs statement — 20 points. (Remember, 
RFP narratives to win contract bids rarely have review points.) In this sec-
tion, you’re expected to write about your capacity to successfully operate 
and support a government-funded grant project or manage a contract award.
In a well-constructed project management statement, you cite your organiza-
tion’s capability and relevant experience in developing and operating pro-
grams that deal with problems similar to those addressed by the proposed 
project or service. You should also cite the organization’s experience in oper-
ating programs in cooperation with other community organizations.
Also remember to identify your program’s executive leaders in the project 
management section. Briefly describe their involvement in the proposed proj-
ect or service, and provide assurance of their commitment to the successful 
implementation of that project or service.
Keep in mind that all key personnel (the persons responsible for the project’s 
implementation) should have extensive experience in programs and services 
like the one you’re proposing. You score more points during the review pro-
cess if you can name actual staff members instead of relying on the standard 
“yet-to-be hired” statement. Note: Don’t forget to identify your third-party 
evaluator upfront. And be prepared to include a copy of her full résumé in 
your appendixes, if requested.
To further your claims regarding project management, include documenta-
tion that briefly summarizes similar projects undertaken by your organiza-
tion, and note the extent to which your objectives were achieved. Also, note 
and justify the priority that this project or service will have within your orga-
nization, including the facilities and resources that are available to carry out 
your plans.
 
Losing even one or two points in this section can hurt you when the total 
score is tallied.
Connecting numbers to words
Your budget forms and detailed narrative must show the grant reviewer or pro-
curement officer/purchasing manager (for RFP narratives) that your costs are 
reasonable, allowable, and worth the result you seek. In grants and cooperative 
agreements, this section is usually worth the remaining review criteria points, 
ranging from five to ten points.

139
 Chapter 10: Writing to Convince Peer Reviewers to Give You the Maximum Points
In most government grant and cooperative agreement competitions and RFP 
opportunities, you’re asked to provide, with your budget narrative, a detailed 
budget work sheet for each year of the project period. You also need to 
include an explanation of the basis for computation of all costs.
 
Add up your budget, and then add it up again. Make sure each expense is 
directly related to an activity that’s necessary to reach the project’s objec-
tives. Don’t introduce any costs here that you haven’t addressed in your main 
proposal, cooperative agreement, or RFP narrative.
When you read the guidelines for preparing the budget, look closely for any 
language about construction costs. Most government grants won’t cover new 
construction, but they will allow program-related renovations. RFPs usually 
have construction exclusions, as well.
 
When in doubt about the guidelines and how they relate to your budget, 
call and ask the government agency’s program officer (for grants) or the 
procurement officer (for RFPs). These calls — even if they seem trivial — 
can establish a relationship that could be beneficial to your grant getting 
funded or your contract being awarded. See Chapter 17 for more about 
budget presentation.
Scoring Higher with Some 
Help from the Feds
Most government agencies that award grants or contracts produce publica-
tions that can give you a leg up on writing all types of grant applications and 
RFP narratives. These valuable resources can be obtained from each govern-
ment agency’s information clearinghouse. Check out agency Web sites for 
links labeled “Resources” or “Publications.” You may encounter any of the 
following publications, which can be of great help:
 
✓ Bulletins: These summarize recent findings from government program 
initiatives. Designed for use as references, they may contain graphic 
elements such as tables, charts, graphs, and photographs. You can re-
create some of the most current and relevant graphics in your needs 
statement or program design.
 
✓ Fact sheets: Fact sheets highlight, in one to two pages, key points and 
sources of further information on government programs and initiatives. 
You can cite the most recent facts (never more than five years old) in 
your needs statement.

140
Part III: Playing and Winning the Grants Game 
 
✓ Journals: These highlight innovative programs or carry articles on criti-
cal issues and trends. You can cite some of the model programs at the 
beginning of your program design section to show how you’re model-
ing your project on a successful program. You can also use any critical 
issues or trends covered in journals in your needs statement.
 
✓ Reports: These documents contain comprehensive research and evalu-
ation findings; provide detailed descriptions of innovative programs 
implemented at the national, state, and local levels; and present sta-
tistical analysis, trends, or other data on selected topics. Reports may 
include explanations of case studies, field studies, and other strategies 
used for assessing program success and replication. Some reports pro-
vide training curriculums and lesson plans as well. You can cite research 
on evaluation findings in your needs statement. Innovative programs 
that are considered models can be cited in your program design section 
to build the basis for proposing your own program model.
 
✓ Summaries: Summaries describe key research and evaluation find-
ings that may affect future policies and practices. Summaries highlight 
funded programs implemented at the national, state, or local level that 
may serve as models for other jurisdictions. These publications are gen-
erally 30 to 90 pages in length and usually include appendixes and lists 
of resources and additional readings. You can cite research on evalua-
tion findings in your needs statement. Innovative programs that are con-
sidered models can be cited in your program design section to build the 
basis for proposing your own program model.
 
I stock up on every print publication I can get my hands on. Grant writing is so 
easy when you have the information you need (and the information you didn’t 
even know you needed) at your fingertips. Even when I use the Internet to let 
my fingers do the walking, I print out my research findings so I have a hard 
copy for use now and for future reference. Learn to work smarter, not harder!
Connecting to the Peer Review Process 
by Becoming a Peer Reviewer
Before you jump the gun and start writing your grant application narrative, 
I want to share an insider secret with you about how to connect mentally 
and skill-wise to the peer review process: You can search for and sign up to 
become a government peer reviewer, which is also known as a grant reader. 
Yes, you! Use your favorite search engine and type in this search string: Call 
for peer reviewer. One of the federal agencies that’s constantly looking for 
peer reviewers is the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

141
 Chapter 10: Writing to Convince Peer Reviewers to Give You the Maximum Points
Desirable peer reviewer characteristics include the following:
 
✓ Experience with writing grant applications in the grant funding topic area
 
✓ Formal education in the grant funding topic area
 
✓ Volunteer experience in the grant funding topic area
 
✓ Work experience in the grant funding topic area
Here are the benefits of participating in the government peer review process:
 
✓ You get paid! Yes, even the government recognizes that your time is 
valuable. Compensation ranges from $100 to $300 per day. Often you’re 
required to make a multiday commitment. When I participated in the 
peer review process, I was in Washington, DC, for seven days (two of 
which were traveling days).
 
✓ You gain valuable experience as a grant reader. You get to see, first 
hand, how other grant writers write, incorporate compelling graphics, 
and present research-based evidence of their need for the grant funding 
and how that funding will impact the target population. In other words, 
you’re going to be paid to train yourself to be a better grant writer!
 
✓ You have the opportunity to network with other peer reviewers from 
throughout the United States and its territories. During the day, you’ll 
be isolated while you read grant applications and write your list of 
strengths and weaknesses about each section of each narrative. When 
you’re done with your daily individual reviewing process (usually, you’ll 
read up to ten grant applications per day), you then meet with two or 
more other peer reviewers who read the same set of grant applications 
that you did. It’s during this team peer review process (where you must 
come to a consensus on the final scoring for each application) that you 
meet many types of individuals who are “connected.”
 
 What do I mean by people who are connected? I mean people who are 
experts in the grant funding field. These same people can become your 
best friends when you need a third-party evaluator (or a referral for one) 
or when you need a copy of a successful grant application they’ve writ-
ten for this particular funding agency.
 
Sometimes, if the peer review database is already full, you may not be con-
tacted for months — even a year or longer. But don’t give up! Continue to 
e-mail the agency’s peer reviewer database contact person and indicate your 
enthusiasm about being invited to participate in the peer review process. You 
may have to update your resume and the peer review application every year, 
so make a note on your annual calendar now!

Chapter 11
Magnetizing Funders with 
Powerful Writing
In This Chapter
▶ Working with words that win funds
▶ Using some tricks of the trade when describing yourself
▶ Polishing the language used to bring your program design to life
A
nyone can write in a cut and dried (aka boring) style. However, when 
it comes to winning competitive grants and contracts, the term paper 
approach to writing will only result in immediate rejection by funders. So, do 
you need an advanced degree in creative writing? No. Do you need to head 
back to school to master the winning words? No, again. What you need is this 
book and, most importantly, this chapter.
In this chapter, I share with you some vivid words and sentences that are 
sure to jump-start your creative side. This is where I share the best of the 
best from Bev with my faithful readers. I think you’ll find yourself returning to 
these pages over and over — every time you write. Sit back and get ready to 
discover the real definition of wordsmithing.
Choosing the Right Words to Write 
a Winning Application
If you’ve read other chapters in this book, you know that I give you tons of 
action steps for every point in the grant seeking and grant writing processes. 
But for this chapter, I want you to throw out those “get to the point” ideas 
about writing. Reprogram your brain with passion, creativity, and emotion.
In the beginning, being creative and pulling words from the sky will seem 
difficult and awkward. Give yourself some time and practice and in no time 
you’ll be writing like Dr. Bev Browning! To help you settle into the writing 
process, the following sections offer you three easy-to-follow steps.

144
Part III: Playing and Winning the Grants Game 
Action Step 1: Lay out who and where
No one sends money to strangers in unknown places. (After all, would you?) 
This rule also applies to grantseekers, who often spend pages writing about 
what they need and only one small sentence about the grant applicant orga-
nization’s location and its unique characteristics.
 
You need to tell the reviewers who you are and where you are — with passion 
and flavor. Sound like fluff? Contrary, my friend! Just remember that money 
comes from the heart, not from the brain. Grants are made based on your tug-
ging on the hearts of the peer reviewers (see Chapters 9 and 10 for more on 
the peer reviewers and their criteria). Their minds are only used to read your 
grant application. Their hearts, on the other hand, make the fund ’em or reject 
’em decisions.
The following are a handful of compelling examples that will shoot the review-
ers in their hearts with Cupid’s arrows. Hopefully, these examples will kick-
start your journey of exploring creative writing and using words that work!
A small and struggling nonprofit organization that was founded at the begin-
ning of this millennium . . .
One of 50 state-level chapters seeking to grasp the many miles we encom-
pass and individuals we strive to serve . . .
Located in the nucleus of the Ozark Mountain’s art community . . .
Adjacent to three of America’s historical landmarks . . .
Sitting amidst a tall sea of pristine forestry . . .
A new IRS-approved 501(c)(3) nonprofit private operating foundation 
located in the heartland of America’s natural state . . .
While only 75 miles from the Metroplex, our small organization serves many 
in this rural, isolated, and economically deprived pocket of poverty . . .
While these examples may seem like they’re going overboard in description, 
they’re the types of paragraph starters that make the grant readers want to 
read more! (See Chapter 13 for how to pull together the description of the 
organization.)
Action Step 2: Play up the bad stuff
If the sun is shining and everything is fine inside and outside of your organi-
zation, you really don’t need any grant monies, right? This is how the grant 
readers view what you write. If you only write about the good things happen-
ing, you don’t really have a justification or need for outside funding. I know 
it may be difficult for the really positive folks out there, but when writing an 
application, you need to do the following:

145
 Chapter 11: Magnetizing Funders with Powerful Writing
 
✓ Focus on the negative
 
✓ Talk about the organization’s gaps or needs
 
✓ Convey or communicate how dire the situation is for your target population
Flip to Chapter 14 for a tour through doom, gloom, drama, and trauma.

Economical, egression, eject, elongated, emaciated, emergency, endless,

The next group of words literally calls out to grant readers consciously and 
subconsciously. Use these words to grab and keep the attention of grant 
readers.
Fade, fallacious, fallacy, fallible, faltering, fault, feckless, fend, feverish, ficti-
tious, final

imperfect, impractical
Jagged, jolt, judicious, jurisdiction, justification, juxtaposed
Keen, kick, kill, knifelike, knock-down-and-drag-out
Lacerated, lackadaisical, lambaste, lapse, lash, latitude, levity
Your words must “walk” and “talk” to grant readers. Even if you’re writing a 
contract bid, you need magnetizing words. The following strong words can 
give you the winning edge every time.
Madness, maggot, makeshift, malign, mandate, matchless, medial, migratory
Nameless, near-at-hand, neglectful, never-ending, nigh, nonetheless

precarious, propensity
Quagmire, queasy, quit, quizzical
Rabid, ration, rattle, ravage, recluse, reevaluate, relinquish, remedy, remiss
Writing with words that “walk” and “talk” means you have to start and keep 
thinking outside of the box. Granted, this isn’t the way you usually load up 
your paragraphs with words, but it’s time to start winning all of your grant 
requests and contract bids.

Don’t underestimate the power of the written word. Using powerful words to 
paint a picture of where the problem is geographically located is especially 
important when you’re approaching potential funders who aren’t located in 
or near your community. However, when you use new words in a grant appli-
cation, make sure you know the meanings and connotations of them so you 
don’t end up using them in the wrong ways.
Action Step 3: Use a thesaurus
Don’t be shy about using a thesaurus to bring your thoughts to life in a way 
that conveys true and serious need. Keep a thesaurus on your desk to help 
you select impactive words when writing about your organization and the 
problems it faces.
 
A thesaurus is a wonderful tool to help you expand your vocabulary and ulti-
mately become a better writer, but if you’re new to vocabulary expansion, be 
careful to avoid words that aren’t slightly mainstream. In an attempt to sound 
smart, you may scare off reviewers who won’t bother to haul out a dictionary 
in order to read your proposal.

147
 Chapter 11: Magnetizing Funders with Powerful Writing
Pulling out a Few Tricks 
to Win Grant Monies
The opening section of your application for funding is all about you. The 
focus is on the problem you want to solve, where you are located, what you 
have done as an organization, and what you are doing now. This section is 
a key ingredient of your winning grant, cooperative agreement, or contract 
bid recipe.
Grant request narratives and responses to Requests for Proposals (RFPs) 
practically shadow each other in content and format. The examples in the 
following sections illustrate well-written content about the applicant or 
bidder — excerpted from real grant or cooperative agreement requests and 
RFP response narratives that won real funding. The names and places have 
been changed to protect the privacy of the winners. I include comments to 
explain why these examples are so effective. (Refer to Chapter 13 for more 
on how to effectively showcase your organization in an application.)
Take advantage of your word processor’s formatting tools. Bold, underline, 
and italicize key words and phrases. It’s even okay to put some critical lan-
guage in red type. (Flip to the later section “Keeping your reader on track” for 
more on how to format your writing.)
 
You just want to lace your narrative with unique formatting; don’t go over-
board. There’s nothing worse for the reader than trying to read all bold, itali-
cized, or underlined text.
Using groups of three
Research shows that groups of three are effective in getting your audience 
to remember an important point. The groups of three tactic is a way to make 
a memorable impression with the words you choose. The words that stick 
in our minds forever usually come in groups of three. For example: blood, 
sweat, and tears; reading, writing, and arithmetic; and red, white, and blue. 
An example of this tactic applied to grant writing terms would look like this:
The American Association of the Benefit Examiners (AABE) works with 
third-party insurance providers to determine the average expenditure per 
patient. The services provided allow insurance companies to calculate the 
level of benefits to offer in each category of health care benefits. The ulti-
mate selling tools to insurance providers are cost-saving, cost effective, 
and cost-wise advice and expertise from the AABE.
In this case, the grant readers or contract bid decision makers have been 
given a rhythm of words that will be embedded in their minds.

148
Part III: Playing and Winning the Grants Game 
Demonstrating soft cash assets
In the following excerpt, the bolded phrases strongly suggest that the organiza-
tion isn’t begging for grant, cooperative agreement, or contract monies with 
both hands out, but rather it has some resources or strengths already in place 
to build upon — a very good situation to be in. The grant, cooperative agree-
ment, or contract review team is more likely to bestow review points on an 
organization that already has some assets — not just cobwebs — in its corner.
The Grant Writing Training Foundation has minimal fiscal resources; how-
ever, our newly formed nonprofit does have other assets. The 12-member 
Board of Directors willingly volunteers for monthly board meet-
ings, weekly committee-level meetings, and for fundraising events. 
The Foundation is headquartered in an 1,800 sq. ft. home on a residen-
tial street. The home has been donated by the Town of Buckeye’s 
Community Development Agency.
In this next example, I show you how to switch hats and write similar lan-
guage for a contract bidding document (where you’re responding to an RFP):
The Genesee Corporation has the following assets that are not being 
requested for expense reimbursement in this contract bid: 24,000 sq. ft. 
corporate and warehouse center; over $100,000 in communications 
equipment, and a fleet of 40 commercial vehicles.
Making a point with emotion
When you write about your need or the need of your target population, you 
must stick to the facts. However, there are no hard and fast rules when it 
comes to how you present those facts. Write with the understanding that you 
increase your chances of winning grant awards, cooperative agreements, and 
RFPs by touching the hearts of the individuals making the funding decisions. 
Remember, I don’t want you to go overboard, but I do want you to make an 
impression by using emotion-filled phrases.
 
The bolded text in the following example highlights powerful phrases that 
you can use in your grant or cooperative agreement applications and RFPs 
to describe any isolated class of people. The imagery of escaping something 
moves the reviewer to a new level of emotion. The reviewer isn’t just reading 
dry text with facts and statistics. Emotion generates higher review points and 
the beginning of a recommendation for funding.

149
 Chapter 11: Magnetizing Funders with Powerful Writing
This is a fact-driven emotional statement for a $100,000 request:
The project targets individuals 18 to 65 years old. 18.8 percent of the 
population between 18 and 65 years old live below the federal poverty 
line; 13.3 percent of individuals 65 or over also live below the poverty 
line. Approximately 9 percent of residents have a physical disability; 15 
percent have sought mental health services. The proposed project will 
address the community problems of chronic underemployment and 
unemployment by helping clients create and implement employability 
plans. The targeted area has not developed sufficiently to spawn large-
scale, high-wage employers. Jobs at prevailing livable wages are beyond 
the reach of many who grew up in poor and struggling families 
and who truly believe and accept that as their fate. Sadly, cultural 
ignorance on the part of local and regional units of government has 
caused the target population to be overlooked and become transpar-
ent! The target population has experienced sporadic unemployment 
because they were employed by seasonal employers.
I used to save my emotional verbiage for foundation and corporate funding 
requests and for private sector contract bids. However, those days have 
passed. You won’t lose review points with a government funding agency or 
a public sector contract bid-letting agency when you draw their attention to 
the need by beefing up the verbiage. As a federal grant reviewer, I expect to 
see magnetizing and emotional language supporting the facts.
Keeping the reader on track
When you get the attention of the person making the funding decision, you 
don’t want to lose it. Here are my general writing rules for keeping your 
reader on track, with eyes glued to your writing:
 
✓ Use lots of headings.
 
✓ Use numbered and bulleted lists.
 
✓ Keep paragraphs short, incorporating no more than 5 to 7 sentences in 
each paragraph.
 
✓ Use a 12-point Times New Roman font (preferred by 80 percent of grant-
making agencies).
 
✓ Stick with one font to avoid a jumbled appearance.
 
✓ Avoid using all capital letters.
 
✓ Underline sparingly.
 
✓ Use boldface or italics to emphasize key words and phrases.

150
Part III: Playing and Winning the Grants Game 
Applying Specific Steps When Writing 
Your Program Design Section
When you write the program design section of your grant application, coop-
erative agreement, or RFP narrative, remember that the point is to explain 
what you want to do with the grant, agreement, or contract monies.
 
The program design includes a description of your program, goals, objectives, 
and activities. It also includes an implementation timeline, a management 
plan, and finally an evaluation plan. Note that while some grantmakers request 
separate management and evaluation plan sections, these sections are still 
considered critical components of the overall program design. (See Chapter 
15 for the full scoop on laying out the plan of action.) You also need to define 
the population you serve, the partnerships you have with other agencies in 
your community, and the changes you plan to make. The program design sec-
tion is the main event, so weigh every word carefully, and make sure that your 
sentences work together like magic.
The following sections present three important steps to follow when writing 
the program design. I use excerpts from a winning grant application to show 
you how to apply each of the three steps.
Step 1: Use power-packed words 
to describe your program
Use words and phrases such as provide, prepare, empowering catalyst, 
strengthening, continuum, and taking the lead. They point to the fact that your 
organization takes action. Here’s an example that uses these descriptive 
words and phrases:
The Mary Mack Board of Directors has just completed nine months of 
capacity-building training under the Capital Compassion Campaign. As a 
sub-grantee, our role is to provide diligent oversight to the ongoing opera-
tion of the Community Employment Project. Our board is prepared to help 
the project become an empowering catalyst in the Far West Valley. The first 
step in strengthening the project is to enter into an agreement with other 
social services agencies in order to form a continuum of services for low-
income clients. Our organization will also take the lead in grant seeking 
and grant writing for other small to mid-size nonprofits in the target region.

151
 Chapter 11: Magnetizing Funders with Powerful Writing
Step 2: Present your goals and 
objectives in the proper terms
Remember, you want to wow funding request readers. To do so, make an 
impressionable point by writing your goals in visionary terms. Use words 
such as decrease, deliver, develop, establish, improve, increase, produce, and 
provide. These words point to meeting a level of performance.
Check out the following sample goals:
Goal 1: Upgrade employment skills of 75 working poor individuals.
Goal 2: Support self-sufficiency efforts for the working poor by providing an 
integrated social services network that enables individuals to identify and 
aggressively address barriers to professional and personal self-improvement.
Similarly, you should write your objectives using the S.M.A.R.T. structure, 
which means that your objectives are specific, measurable, attainable, realis-
tic, and time bound. In the following examples, each objective is aligned with 
the goal that it addresses.
SMART Objective 1a: By the end of Year 1, individuals enrolled in the 
Community Employment Project will increase their job upgrade skills by 50 
percent or more upon completion of vocational, basic education, and on-the-
job training components.
SMART Objective 2a: By the end of Year 1, 90 percent or more of individuals 
enrolled in the Community Employment Project will complete 100 hours of 
comprehensive job and life-enhancing counseling with licensed social work-
ers and mental health professionals.
Step 3: Finish your story by writing 
about longevity and future plans
Use words and phrases such as external, internal, local fundraising, creating 
future funding partners, inviting more external funding sources to the organiza-
tion’s table of partners, seeking to identify more investors in our stakeholders, 
and continuing grant-funded activities after the funding is gone. These words and 
phrases don’t just point to something; they rocket off the page and say, “We’re 
planning for the future of this organization, and we’re asking for your help, but 
we have a plan for keeping this program alive after we spend your money.”

152
Part III: Playing and Winning the Grants Game 
 
All types of funders want assurances that when you finish spending all their 
money, the show or program will go on. No funder wants the efforts started 
with their investment or contract award to suddenly shut down at the end of 
the grant or contract funding period.
In your Program Design and Evaluation section, you must write a paragraph 
to address the funder’s concerns, which arise during the funding request 
review stage.
This paragraph from the Community Employment Project’s grant request 
lays out the organization’s financial plan for its project’s future.
The Community Employment Project (CEP) has recently been designed as 
the Town of Jackrabbit’s faith-based intermediary agent. This means that all 
grant applications written by the Town will designate CEP as a fiscal agent 
or grant applicant depending on the funding agency’s applicant eligibility 
guidelines. This means that CEP will be given, at a minimum, a 10 percent 
administrative oversight fee for every funded application. Based on 2007 
grant submissions by the Town, CEP could receive $250,000 in the next year 
and even more thereafter. These monies will enable CEP to continue provid-
ing critically needed employment and training services in Jackrabbit.

sorts of award-winning documents, from magnetic cover 
letters to succinct abstracts and executive summaries.
Part IV is the foundation to building your grant- and 
contract bid–seeking house. In fact, this part delivers the 
best of Bev’s best! I show you how to present your organi-
zation’s or business’s grant applicant credibility, convey a

funded projects, demonstrate that you have resources to 
compliment the grant funds, and develop an accurate and 
reasonable budget section.

Creating the Documents Outside

In This Chapter
▶ Writing an effective cover letter
▶ Deciding what to fill in on a common grant application cover form
▶ Examining federal cover forms
▶ Creating the abstract or executive summary and the table of contents
▶ Taking a look at the RFP opening instructions
B
ack in the old days, every type of request that you submitted to a 
funder required a cover letter. I even typed cover letters for federal 
grant applications. Well, those days are long gone — at least for government 
grant applications. However, there are a handful of foundation and corporate 
grantmakers that still require cover letters with grant proposals. What do 
you write in these cover letters? How long should they be? Should they be 
formal or informal? I answer these questions in this chapter.
I also introduce you to some of the standard information gathering forms 
and other pre-narrative sections you can expect to see. Remember that 
every funding source, private (foundation and corporation) and public (gov-
ernment agencies) has different grant proposal formatting and submission 
requirements. With so many types of funding applications floating around, 
determining what goes where can be confusing. That’s why I explain it all for 
you in this chapter.
By order of appearance, the upfront stuff (the items that come before the 
grant application narrative) should be the following (note that not all the 
pieces apply in every case):
 
✓ Cover letter (only for foundation and corporate requests; only provide 
a cover letter for a Request for Proposal, or RFP, or cooperative agree-
ment when the guidelines instruct you to do so)

156
Part IV: Writing a Competitive Application Narrative 
 
✓ Common grant application form (only for foundation and corporate 
requests when the funder doesn’t have its own specific application form 
or format)
 
✓ Application for Federal Assistance (only for federal grant applications)
 
✓ Abstract or Executive Summary (appropriate for all types of funders; 
required when requested)
 
✓ Notice of Request for Proposal Cover Form (only for RFP or contract bid-
ding documents)
 
✓ Table of contents (generally for federal and state grant applications)
 
Federal guidelines for using a cooperative agreement (as distinct from a 
contract or grant) are basically the same as those for a grant except that the 
funding agency expects to be substantially involved with the recipient of the 
research funds in carrying out the funded activities. So, follow the guidelines 
and work closely with the funding agency’s contact person to pose technical 
questions.
Making the Cover Letter 
Factual and Personal
Today, I use cover letters only on foundation and corporate requests, not on 
federal or state grant or cooperative agreement applications. Government 
funders want you to provide only the parts they ask for, and they rarely, if 
ever, ask for a cover letter. Foundations and corporations, on the other hand, 
usually expect to see a cover letter.
Your cover letter should be brief, it should get to the point, and it shouldn’t 
regurgitate the information that’s in the grant application (government fund-
ing request) or proposal (foundation or corporate funding request). When 
a funder opens your request for assistance, the cover letter should provide 
the first inkling of how well you understand the person to whom you’ve 
addressed the letter (that’s the funder). Figure 12-1 gives you the basic 
format of a cover letter.
 
Write the cover letter last, after you’ve completed the entire funding request 
and when you’re in a reflective mood. As you consider your great achievement 
(the finished funding request), let the creative, right side of your brain kick 
in and connect your feelings of accomplishment to the person who will help 
make your plans come true.

157

Heads up, contract bidders: RFP guidelines vary, so read the checklist require-
ments to determine whether you need to add a cover letter to your application.

Horses Our Us Fund 
777 W. Lucky Bucks Way 
Money, FL 77777 
 
Dear Mrs. Rich: 
 
May this cover letter serve as your introduction to Sunshine Equine Research (SER), Inc., based in Sunshine, 
Nevada. As the Executive Director and Ranch Manager, I humbly submit our grant proposal for your review. We are 
requesting $25,000 from the Horses Our Us Fund to repair broken and rusted fencing around the 10-acre “waiting to 
go to horse heaven” section of our research center’s ranch. Each year, nearly 400 horses that are abused and 
neglected are brought to SER for recovery care. Many of the horses arrive in varying states of health and often die 
within 90 days of arriving. Nationally, research by the American Veterinarian Association (2008) indicates that our 
approach to equine research is the most humane offered. No research is conducted until after a horse has died, and 
all research contributes to advancing equine medicines for future generations of thoroughbreds. 
 
SER is a 501(c)(3) private operating foundation that was created in 2000 by Sir Ranch a Lot, Sr., on his retirement 
from the thoroughbred racing industry. Our purpose is to advance research on what causes illness and foal 
deformities among thoroughbred racing horses. SER and the Horses R Us Fund have some things in common. What 
might those things be? We both have a love for horses, and we’re both dedicated to advancing equine research. 
 
Your investment in SER will make the difference in our securing these special boarders — rather than losing them 
to the desert where they have, in the past, lost their way and died a cruel death in the 120-plus degree sun. 
 
Hoping, 
 
Rusty

ENCLOSURE 

158
Part IV: Writing a Competitive Application Narrative 
Follow these handy tips when you write your own cover letters:
 
✓ Use the same date that the complete grant application will be sent to 
the funding source. You want to create documents that are consistent, 
so the dates on cover letters and accompanying cover forms should be 
the same.
 
✓ Open with the contact person’s name and title, followed by the fund-
ing source name, address, city, state, and zip code. Remember to 
double-check the contact information with a telephone call or e-mail 
to the funder.
 
✓ Greet the contact person with “Dear” plus the personal title, as in Mr., 
Ms., Mrs., Messrs., followed by the last name. This is your first point of 
introduction to a potential funder, so a personal title must be used. Call 
ahead to make sure that the personal title is correct. I once used Ms. for 
a female program director who preferred to be addressed with “Miss.” 
The request was denied because I did not do my homework on her cor-
rect personal title.
 
✓ Keep the first paragraph short and focused. Start by introducing your 
organization (use its legal name), and then introduce yourself and 
give your job title (Executive Director, Development Officer, and so 
forth). Finally, get to the point. Tell the funder how much money you’re 
requesting and why the monies are needed by your organization. Write 
a sentence or two about what your organization does. Validate your 
existence by adding at least one sentence that includes research-based 
evidence that there is a need for what your organization does.
 
✓ Write a second paragraph that’s brief and to the point. Include no 
more than three sentences stating your organization’s corporate struc-
ture status and the date it was founded. Then tell the funder your organi-
zation’s purpose and how it aligns with the funder’s mission or funding 
priority.
 
✓ Wrap up your cover letter with a final, summarizing paragraph. Share 
a closing thought or reflection about what this funding partnership can 
mean for the future of your project’s target audience.
 
✓ Use a standard closing, such as “Sincerely” or “With hope.” It’s impor-
tant to sound both thankful (using “sincerely”) and optimistic (using 
“with hope”) as you close your request for funds.
 
✓ Sign your first name only; doing so invites an informal, long-term rela-
tionship. Below your signature, type your first name, middle initial, last 
name, and job title.
 
✓ At the bottom of the letter, include the note “ENCLOSURE” (in all 
caps). This note indicates that a grant proposal is included in the same 
packet. The capital letters signal that the grant proposal is important.

 Chapter 12: Creating the Documents Outside of the Main Narrative
Use the letter in Figure 12-1 as a guide when you write your cover letter. 
Chapter 11 details how to craft exciting, vivid language throughout your 
application.
Completing Common Grant 
Application Cover Forms
Many groups of grantmakers, from foundations to corporations, have created 
their own customized common grant application forms and formats. These 
types of commonly developed and used forms and formats can be found 
on the Foundation Center’s Web site, www.foundationcenter.org. (See 
Chapter 6 for more on the Foundation Center.)
 
No one group of funders is using the exact same formatting or forms. So, in 
this section, I give you the most commonly requested information fields that 
you can expect to see with any of the state-level applications and the Regional 
Association of Grantmakers common grant applications.
The following are the most commonly requested cover form information fields 
that may be required for the varying common grant application formats:
 
✓ Organization name, tax-exempt status, year organization was founded, 
date of application, address, telephone number, fax number, direc-
tor, and contact person and title: These items give the funding source 
straight information about your eligibility to apply for funds.
 
✓ Grant request: The funding source wants to know how much money 
you’re asking for before it even reads the full proposal. The amount 
listed here is the first clue to the funder that you’re counting on it to 
provide 100 percent of your project support.
 
 This doesn’t mean that you’re only requesting the total amount needed 
from one funder; you still send your customized common grant applica-
tion proposal package to other funders that are willing to accept this 
format. Having more than one potential funder lined up increases your 
chances of receiving the full amount needed.
 
✓ Period grant will cover: Most foundation and corporate funders award 
grant monies for only one year. Some will fund you for multiple years, 
but they don’t represent the norm among private sector funders.
 
✓ Type of request: Typically, the funders want to know if you’re request-
ing general support (money to pay the day-to-day bills), start-up funds 
(just beginning operations), technical assistance (training, account-
ing aid, or some other type of specialized consulting), and so on. See 
Chapter 1 for your grant language choices when it comes to the type of 
funds requested.

160
Part IV: Writing a Competitive Application Narrative 
 
✓ Project title: I personally like for every funding request to have a project 
or program title. A title gives your request personality. Remember to be 
consistent in the use of your title. It should be the same from the cover 
letter to the cover form to the grant proposal.
 
✓ Total project budget: The amount you enter here is the total cost to 
implement your program. Include the value of your in-kind and cash 
contributions in addition to the amount needed from the funder. (See 
Chapter 17 for budget terms and definitions.)
 
✓ Total organizational budget: This is the amount of your organization’s 
total operating budget for the current fiscal year.
 
✓ Start date of fiscal year: The fiscal year is the date that your organiza-
tion’s financial year begins. For example, your fiscal year may begin 
on January 1, September 1, or July 1. Check with your financial staff to 
determine your start date.
 
✓ Summarize the organization’s mission: The word “summarize” is key 
here. If you have a long mission statement, give the abbreviated version. 
Remember that usually the entire cover form fits on one page.
 
✓ Summary of project or grant request: Don’t fill out this field until you’ve 
written the grant application narrative. Then you cut and paste into this 
section the sentences that most effectively summarize your project.
Just the Facts: Filling In 
Federal Cover Forms
Since the arrival of Grants.gov and the online federal grant application 
e-grant submission system, it’s no longer necessary to fill out grant applica-
tion cover forms the old way (typing or scanning them).
The new and improved electronic Grant Application Cover Form (also known 
as Form 424) has expanded from one page to four pages. Here I walk you 
through the sections you can expect to see when you’re filling it in online. I 
tell you exactly what the government wants you to include.
Here are the sections you’ll find on Page 1 of the Application for Federal 
Assistance SF-424:
 
✓ Section 1: Type of Submission. Your options for this section are “Pre-
application,” “Application,” or “Changed/Corrected Application.”
 
✓ Section 2: Type of Application. Your options for this section are “New,” 
“Continuation,” or “Revision.”

161
 Chapter 12: Creating the Documents Outside of the Main Narrative
 
✓ Section 3: Date Received. This section will be completed by Grants.gov 
upon submission.
 
✓ Section 4: Applicant Identifier. Enter the entity identifier number 
(assigned by the federal agency) or your application control number 
(usually issued by Grants.gov when you submit the application). You 
likely won’t have a number to enter here if your application isn’t a 
revised or continuation application.
 
✓ Section 5a: Federal Entity Identifier. This section is similar to Section 4. 
If you’re a new applicant, this section will remain blank.
 
✓ Section 5b: Federal Award Identifier. Leave this section blank if you’re 
a new applicant. If you aren’t a new applicant, you will have been given 
this number by the federal funding agency.
 
✓ Section 6: Date Received by State. This section is for state use only.
 
✓ Section 7: State Application Identifier. This section is for state use only.
 
✓ Section 8: Application Information. This is a clear and to the point 
section about your organization. You enter the legal name, employer/
taxpayer identification number (EIN/TIN), DUNS number (see Chapter 
3), address, department and division names, and name and contact 
information of the person to be contacted regarding matters involving 
your grant application.
Here are the sections you’ll find on Page 2 of the Application for Federal 
Assistance SF-424:
 
✓ Section 9: Type of Applicant. In this section, you’ll see a drop-down 
window where you can select from the following options: nonprofit, 
for-profit, institution of higher education, local education agency, state 
education agency, state agency, and just about every other eligible appli-
cant citatory that you read about in the grant application’s summary 
and guidelines. (See Chapter 9 for more on the summary and guidelines.)
 
✓ Section 10: Name of Federal Agency. In this section, you type in the 
name of the federal funding agency that you’re submitting your grant 
application to for review (and hopefully recommendation for funding) 
by the peer review team.
 
✓ Section 11: Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number. You’ll find 
this number in the Grant Funding Opportunity Announcement Summary. 
Remember, this is a five-digit number.
 
✓ Section 12: Funding Opportunity Number. You find this number in the 
Grant Funding Opportunity Announcement Summary. This number can 
vary in the number of digits. In this section, you also need to type in the 
title of the funding competition.

✓ Section 13: Competition Identification Number. You find this number in 
the Grant Funding Opportunity Announcement Summary. You also need 
to type in the title of the competition in this section.
 
✓ Section 14: Areas Affected by Project (Cities, Counties, States, etc.). 
Don’t just list the city, county, and state where your organization is 
located; list the cities, counties, and states where you provide services 
and where your target population is located.
 
✓ Section 15: Descriptive Title of Applicants Project. This is the section 
where you spotlight the fantastic name you’ve selected for your grant-
funded project. After all, every project in need of grant funding must 
have a “can’t forget this” name! Stumped? See Chapter 3.
Here are the sections you’ll find on Page 3 of the Application for Federal 
Assistance SF-424:
 
✓ Section 16: Congressional Districts. Don’t know your districts very well? 
Call your nearest public library and ask. Remember to include all the 
districts that your target population resides in, not just the one where 
your organization is located.
 
✓ Section 17: Proposed Project. In this section, you enter your project’s 
start date and end date.
 
✓ Section 18: Estimated Funding. Here you enter the federal request 
amount, your own local contribution, and any other expected contri-
butions. For example: state, local, other revenues as well as potential 
program income (fees to clients) amounts. You also have to total the 
amounts.
 
✓ Section 19: Is Application Subject to Review by State under Executive 
Order 12372 Process? If so, you have three options for responding: 
you’re eligible, and you submitted it on the date you’ll enter; you didn’t 
submit your grant application for state review; your state doesn’t have a 
pre-review requirement for federal grants submitted from organizations 
located there.
 
 How do you know which option is right for you? Go to www.whitehouse.
gov/omb/grants/spoc.html. At this site, you can see whether your 
state is on the list that requires a pre-review on all federal grant applica-
tions. As of 2008, only 22 states and five U.S. territories had designated 
Single Points of Contact (SPOC). A SPOC is appointed by the governor as 
the designated individual or agency who has the authority to pre-review 
your grant application request and submit comments, including recom-
mendations, to the federal funding agency. Failing to adhere to the SPOC 
review requirement can result in your grant application not progressing 
from the technical review process to the peer review process.

 Chapter 12: Creating the Documents Outside of the Main Narrative
 
✓ Section 20: Is the Applicant Delinquent On Any Federal Debt? It’s 
either yes or no. If it’s yes, you’ll have a lot of explaining to do!
 
✓ Section 21: Signatory box. In this box, you simply type in the name of 
your authorized contact person or their initials. Each federal grantmak-
ing agency provides specific instructions on what they want you to enter 
into this information field.
Here’s the section you find on Page 4 of the Application for Federal 
Assistance SF-424:
 
✓ Section 22: Applicant Federal Debt Delinquency Information. Page 4 
is only applicable if you have delinquent federal debt. This page houses 
your lengthy 4,000-character explanation of your debt.
Crafting the Abstract or 
Executive Summary
The abstract or executive summary is a brief, one-page overview of what the 
grant reviewer will find in the full grant application. Brevity is important (this 
section should be no longer than one page unless the guidelines indicate the 
need for a two page summary), so your abstract or summary should be writ-
ten (or assembled) after the grant application narrative has been entirely 
written. Why? By then you should have all the wordy explanations out of 
your system!
 
You can create an abstract or executive summary by pulling the most signifi-
cant sentences from each key writing section in the grant narrative and doing 
a quick cut and paste. Refer to Figure 12-2 for an example of an executive sum-
mary. Take key sentences from the following areas, and keep them in the same 
order in the abstract or executive summary as they appear in the narrative:
 
✓ Proposed initiative: Here you enter the name of your project or pro-
gram and the full name of the funding competition you’re applying to for 
grant consideration.
 
✓ Introduction of target population: Copy and paste a sentence or two 
about who you’re planning to target and serve with grant monies.
 
✓ Goals: Copy and paste your goals from the project design section of 
your proposal narrative.

164
Part IV: Writing a Competitive Application Narrative 
 
✓ Program Measurements and Performance Targets (also known as 
objectives): Copy and paste your objectives and performance targets 
from the project design section of your proposal narrative.
 
✓ Plan of action: Copy and paste the key activities that comprise the pro-
gram’s implementation process.

Grant Application Executive Summary 
 
Proposed Initiative: Jobs For Innovation (JFI) is applying for U.S. Department of Labor funding for its proposed 
Hollywood School To Career Partnership. 
 
Target Population: The target population for the Hollywood Youth Entrepreneurial Program (YEP) will be 30 
TANF-eligible youth, ages 15 to 19, who are placed in juvenile aftercare services or are at risk of dropping out of 
high school or entering the juvenile justice system. 
 
Program Goal: The goal of the program will be to facilitate the continuing education of these youth and develop 
their basic workplace skills by exposing them to entrepreneurial training and work experience in cooperating 
Hollywood businesses. 
 
 
Plan of Action: Jobs For Innovation (JFI) will work with Hollywood High School to develop a two-semester 
entrepreneurial training course using the Get a Job Now curriculum package. The Hollywood School To Career 
Partnership will orient teachers and JFI YEP staff with the curriculum. Endorsed and used by Partnership sites, the 
curriculum helps students enrolled in vocational skills training courses/programs experience business firsthand. 
Students put lessons to use in running individual or class ventures. The curriculum teaches students how to keep 
financial records, facilitates their interviews with local entrepreneurs, and guides them in outlining a business plan. 
Career skills students gain include: business introductions, win-win negotiations, sales presentations, advertising, 
financial record keeping, tracking stocks, and filling out job applications. This training course, open to YEP 
participants enrolled in grades 9–12, will be a prevocational course for in-school students. In-school students will 
have already completed remedial core curriculum coursework that equates to basic skills training. They will be 
placed in employer-provided work-based learning, work-based mentoring, and job shadowing evenings (from 3 p.m. 
to 6 p.m.), weekends, school holidays and vacations, and during the summer months. JFI will also organize an after 
school drop-in Job Club for in-school students at the YEP site. Students will be required to attend Job Club at least 
twice weekly in the first semester. In the second semester, JFI will develop an after school YEP peer support group, 
so participants can aid and encourage each other. JFI will work with the Hollywood School To Career Partnership, 
JFI’s existing secure and non-secure juvenile program residents, Hollywood Housing Authority, Hollywood 
Hispanic Civic Association, Village of Hollywood Hills, Kiwanis International, Mercedes County Youth Board, the 
Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, Hollywood School District, and the “Worst to First”/Serve America Program to 
coordinate existing services to the target population and to maximize YEP program resources.

 Chapter 12: Creating the Documents Outside of the Main Narrative
Developing the Table of Contents
Whether you include a table of contents depends on the grant application 
guidelines. Rigidly structured guidelines typically call for a table of contents, 
particularly if the narrative is long (more than ten pages) or if you’re asked to 
provide several attachments or appendixes.
 
The table of contents shouldn’t include the abstract or executive summary 
because those parts almost always precede the table of contents. Exceptions 
to this rule are applications from state or federal agencies that stipulate a 
format in which the table of contents comes before the abstract or execu-
tive summary. Grant guidelines and writing formats vary from one agency to 
another and even within departments in an agency, so be sure to read the 
grant application guidelines and follow the format listed in the reviewer’s cri-
teria (see Chapters 9 and 10 for details on review criteria).
Figure 12-3 provides you with an example of a federal grant application table 
of contents. Note that
 
✓ Only the main sections of the grant application are listed.
 
✓ Appendixes are listed and numbered.
 
✓ Federal or state mandated forms and attachments or appendixes are 
listed.
 
 Including mandated forms in your table of contents lets the government 
know that you included them in the application. If a form disappears 
during the review process, at least the grant reviewer can affirm that it 
was included in the original application.

Examining the RFP Opening 
Instructions for Contract Bids
Every contract bid-letting agency has its own version of the Notice of Request 
for Proposal cover letter or page. See Figure 12-4 for an example. The RFP’s 
opening instructions typically provide this type of information:
 
✓ The solicitation number. This number is assigned by the procurement 
agency (the department or division releasing the RFP for bidding 
purposes).
 
✓ The RFP title. This title is noted on the first page of the bidding 
instructions.
 
✓ The contract award time frame.
 
✓ The fact that there will not be a Pre-Bid Conference for the procurement.
 
✓ Instructions for when and where to submit your bidding documents.
 
✓ Set-asides for federally-designated businesses.
 
✓ The name of the procurement officer. The RFP’s opening instructions 
close with that person’s name.
 
✓ The name of the agency requesting the contracted or proposed services. 
You can find the name at the top of the letterhead or on the first page of 
the RFP’s opening instructions.
 
✓ The announcement for the preproposal conference, if there is one. This 
information will appear in the first few pages of most RFPs.
 
✓ A paragraph instructing you to contact the solicitation contact person 
with questions about the RFP.
 
✓ Information regarding the competitive sealed proposal submission pro-
cess. A specific state government code is also cited.

Chapter 13
Building Grant Applicant 
Credibility
In This Chapter
▶ Writing the organizational capability section
▶ Introducing your programs
▶ Describing your target population
▶ Talking about your partnerships
▶ Determining the required elements for contract bids
W
hen your organization decides to apply for its first grant monies, it’s 
critical that you know about your organization and show (in your writ-
ing) that it’s capable and credible in the eyes of the grant funders. The sec-
tion of the grant application narrative that houses this information, whether 
upfront, in the middle, or at the end of the narrative writing format, communi-
cates who you are, where you are, and what you do as an organization.
When you write your opening paragraphs, keep in mind the way you would 
behave when meeting someone for the first time. The cordial thing to do is 
to engage in general chitchat about what you do for a living. Well, it’s no dif-
ferent when you’re introducing your organization on paper to the funding 
source — you have to cover the formalities of who, what, where, and how. 
(Chapter 12 tells you what to put in the application prior to the opening nar-
rative.) Note that for foundation and corporate funding requests, the section 
of your narrative in which you describe your organization shouldn’t exceed 
two typed, single-spaced pages in length.
In this chapter, you find out how to build your organization’s background, 
programs, and affiliations into compelling introductory paragraphs. These 
opening sections convince the grant reader that you’re financially and opera-
tionally capable to receive and manage grant monies.

170
Part IV: Writing a Competitive Application Narrative 
 
A little trivia and a lot of facts create the kind of reader interest every success-
ful grant writer shoots for. The longer you can keep readers’ attention, the 
better your chances are of getting recommended for a grant award. I include a 
full-length grant application in the appendix at the end of the book. Be sure to 
check it out before you write.
Discovering the Details of Funding 
Source Writing Instructions
In most cases, the funding source’s narrative writing instructions will point 
you in the right direction for what to include in the capability section of the 
application. Some funders title this section Organizational Background or 
History. Others label it Grant Applicant Capability or Organizational Capability. 
Regardless of what the funder calls this section, when introducing your orga-
nization, be sure to divide the information into different parts for easy diges-
tion by the grant reviewer.
For example, you might include these different parts: Background (his-
tory and accomplishments), Programs and Activities (current services), 
Constituency Demographics (information about your service population) and 
Community Affiliations (local, regional, and state partners).
Here are some examples of the types of narrative section writing instructions 
you may see in your application guidelines:
Community Foundation guidelines for writing organizational infor-
mation (maximum of 150 words): Describe your organization, its history 
and background, accomplishments and qualifications, services provided, 
and how it benefits the residents of the community. Include the number of 
people served, and then illustrate the increase in service, whether to people 
or in expansion of programs. Show us the track record of past work. If the 
agency is relatively new, talk about the track record to date.
U.S. Department of Labor Employment and Training Administration 
guidelines for writing organizational capacity narrative: To satisfy 
the criterion, applicants must describe their proposed project management 
structure, including, where appropriate, the identification of a proposed 
project manager, a discussion of the proposed staffing pattern, and the quali-
fications and experience of key staff members. Applicants must also show 
evidence of the use of data systems to track outcomes in a timely and accu-
rate manner. The applicant must include a description of organizational 
capacity and of the organization’s track record in projects similar to those 
described in the proposal and/or similar to related activities of the primary 
partners. This section is worth 10 points.
See Chapters 9 and 10 for more details on review points and criteria.

171
 Chapter 13: Building Grant Applicant Credibility
Laying the Organizational 
Capability Foundation
When writing the organizational capability section of your application, you 
need to tell the grant reader, clearly and concisely, just enough information 
about your organization’s experience and accomplishments to pique her 
interest and keep her reading word for word. Remember that you’re just 
introducing yourself, and it’s not polite to start jabbering about the money 
you need or the problems you have.
In the first few sentences, the grant reader wants to see
 
✓ The full legal name of your organization
 
✓ The year the organization was founded, by whom, and for what purpose
 
 If you don’t know the appropriate answers, ask a veteran employee or 
a long-time board member. Sometimes, the history of an organization is 
written up in its annual report or in an anniversary issue of its newsletter. 
Keep researching and asking others until you strike gold.
 
✓ The location of the organization’s headquarters and any other operating 
sites (name, city, county, state)
 
✓ The mission statement (use the abbreviated version)
 
✓ The organization’s most important achievements that are related to the 
activities covered in the grant application
 
 If you’re seeking, for example, grant funds for a new after-school pro-
gram, don’t mention unrelated accomplishments, such as the school 
football team’s winning record or the cabinet full of medals from the 
school’s swim team. Taking the grant reader down a dead-end road with 
unrelated information is a fatal flaw, and it can result in your application 
not being read or funded.
Complete the organizational capability section by writing about important 
milestones in the organization’s history. Even though your organization may 
have dozens of milestones, use bulleted, abbreviated statements to share 
only the top three to five milestones. And use a casual voice to make the list 
more inviting. Your organization’s milestones may look something like this:
 
✓ Beginning in 2000, Pacific Rim Injury has established its role with gov-
ernment ministries and national committees working on education and 
training issues related to child traffic injuries.
 
✓ Since early 2006, we have worked with the Pacific Rim Ministries of 
Education and Training and the International Traffic Safety Committee 
to develop active learning techniques for traffic safety education for pri-
mary school children in the Pacific Rim.

172
Part IV: Writing a Competitive Application Narrative 
 
✓ Last year, Pacific Rim Injury worked with Pacific Rim government agen-
cies to identify the extent of motorbike injuries that claim the lives of 
young riders, especially primary school–age children, and to develop 
milestone interventions to protect the Rim’s children when riding 
motorbikes.
 
✓ This year, Pacific Rim Injury’s CEO coauthored the safety manual “Child 
Standard for Motorbikes and Mopeds,” which was adopted by 100 percent 
of the Pacific Rim governments.
 
When you’re writing the organizational capability section of the proposal nar-
rative for a foundation or corporate funder, be sure to use language that works 
its way into the grant reader’s heart and mind. The added impact always helps 
push your grant request down the funding path.
In the example that follows, I make the text inviting by putting a face on the 
organization’s history. (See Chapter 11 for more about using colorful lan-
guage in your writing.)
Romanian-born conductor Valentin Radu formed Vox Ama Deus in 1987, in 
Philadelphia, in order to revive appreciation and understanding of music of 
the 14th through 17th centuries from such masters as Palestrina, Monteverdi, 
Victoria, and Schutz. Vox Ama Deus presents voice and instrumental music 
of the Renaissance, Baroque, and Classical periods.
Vox Ama Deus consists of two performance groups: the Ama Deus Ensemble, 
with 40 voices and an orchestra of appropriate period or modern instru-
ments; and Vox Renaissance Consort, with 12 to 16 costumed professional 
singers who perform music of the High Renaissance both a cappella and with 
period instrument accompaniment.
When writing the organizational capabilities section, I like to use customized 
bullets to draw attention to the grant applicant’s attributes. For example, you 
could use musical notes to highlight Vox Ama Deus’ strengths.
 
In order to get your grant application funded, you must be able to take the 
mundane and make it interesting to the grant reader. Your story must be mag-
netizing to all who read it, from your community partners to potential funders. 
After years of experimenting, I’m thoroughly convinced that telling and selling 
your organization’s story is critical when funders are at the point of making a 
decision to fund or not to fund. You must write to hit them where their hearts 
are! This approach has pushed my funding success rate (the percentage of 
grants funded out of all the grants I write on an annual basis) from 50 percent 
to 90–95 percent.

173
 Chapter 13: Building Grant Applicant Credibility
 
Strong, emotional writing works best with foundation and corporate grant 
applications, but you need to adopt a different writing style for government 
applications.
When you describe your organization’s history in a government grant appli-
cation, follow these tips to rack up the review points:
 
✓ Use a cut-and-dried writing style — only write what’s asked for, no more, 
no less.
 
✓ Stick with the cold, hard facts.
 
✓ Don’t write the history and accomplishments section in first person 
(using such pronouns as I, our, and my). Instead, use the third-person 
writing approach. When you write in third person, you’re writing as if 
you’re on the outside of the grant applicant organization and looking 
back in with a third-party perspective. Your reference to your organi-
zation must be from a formal and straightforward approach. Here are 
two examples that allow you to compare first- and third-person writing 
styles:
 
• First person: Our organization was founded in 2007 and is located 
in Montgomery, Alabama. Last year, our staff handed out food boxes 
to 4,967 individuals and families whose household incomes were 30 
percent below the federal poverty rate. My 200 volunteers worked a 
total of 5,423 hours to meet our demand for food supplements.
 
• Third person: The organization was founded in 2007 and is located 
in Montgomery, Alabama. Last year, its staff handed out food boxes 
to 4,967 individuals and families whose household incomes were 
30 percent below the federal poverty rate. The organization’s 200 
volunteers worked a total of 5,423 hours to meet the demand for food 
supplements.
 
✓ Sterilize the writing content by avoiding emotional terms. Don’t talk 
about anyone’s feelings!
Describing Your Programs with Flair
Use the program section of your opening narrative to write about the day-to-day 
happenings at your organization. Describe the programs that you currently pro-
vide to your constituency (also called the target population), not what you plan 
to provide when your grant request is funded. (You can read more about target 
populations later in this chapter.) If you work for a smaller organization, you 

174
Part IV: Writing a Competitive Application Narrative 
probably have only one or two programs. However, keep in mind that having 
fewer programs doesn’t decrease your chances of winning a grant award. 
Grants are available for organizations of all sizes and shapes. Remember, it’s all 
in the writing.
The grant reader is looking for you to briefly
 
✓ Give the name of the program and state how long it has existed (focus 
on long lasting and successful programs).
 
✓ Tell who the program serves (youth, adults, women, the elderly, physi-
cally challenged individuals, or whoever).
 
✓ Describe how your target population benefits from the program.
The following is an abbreviated version of a current programs section from a 
United Way grant application.
Brief Description of VOSS: Valley Outreach for Social Services (VOSS) 
was founded in 2007 by a core group of concerned and community-oriented 
far–West Valley residents in the state of California. The organization’s mis-
sion is to build relationships within our communities by offering programs 
that provide support, education, and counseling in a variety of initiatives to 
enable each person and/or family to achieve a self-building relationship. To 
achieve this mission, VOSS has developed two core community intervention 
and prevention service tiers: Community Outreach Programs and The 
Wellness Center.
Community Outreach Programs: Food distribution to the needy; clothes 
closet for welfare to work individuals; utility fund for individuals residing in 
households below 150 percent of the Federal Poverty Level; basic life skills 
training (youth and adults); job placement assistance (youth and adults); 
helping individuals develop new life skills and knowledge; individual and 
family life-crisis prevention; and an Adopt a Block Program.
The Wellness Center: Alcohol and drug rehabilitation and prevention 
onsite support group; adult and child abuse prevention counseling referrals; 
sexual abuse prevention counseling referrals; medical screening and assis-
tance referrals; and prisoner reentry assistance (emergency housing assis-
tance and life skills readjustment counseling and training).
 
Don’t make the mistake of pulling the language for this section from a previously 
written grant (such as last year’s failed attempt). Always use fresh, up-to-date 
programs and activities information. Grant readers are very intuitive and can 
pick up on outdated, out-of-place information.

175
 Chapter 13: Building Grant Applicant Credibility
Defining the Target Population
The target population section is the place to write about the people you serve. 
If you’re serving certain organizations, you write about the organizations. If 
you’re writing a grant for an animal shelter, you write about the animals.
Give just enough detail to aid the reader in understanding where your operat-
ing dollars end up — for use with the poor, the blind, the unemployed, the 
high school dropouts, the homeless, or the terminally ill, for instance. To 
make this section as accurate as possible, do your homework. Pull old evalu-
ation reports from previously funded grants, and review reports given to 
your board members — both types of documents should detail exactly who 
benefits from your organization’s services.
The grant reader wants to see:
 
✓ Characteristics of your target population (age range, gender, ethnicity, 
education level, and income level)
 
✓ Numbers served by each program (make a table that covers the past 
five years)
 
✓ Changes in the target population that may relate to why you’re asking 
for grant funds
 
Clearly define your target population. You must convey to funders that you’re 
serving a constituency that falls within their funding parameters. Also, be sure 
to cite the source of your demographics!
When you write the target population section, use boldface and italics to 
make words describing the population stand out for the grant reader. In 
the following example, I introduce the grant reviewer to a faith-based non-
profit organization serving inner city residents. Because I want the reader to 
understand the importance of the funding request, I use a lot of boldface to 
make phrases stick in the reviewer’s mind. This request was for a Board of 
Director’s capacity building grant application.
Brief description of the community to be served and engaged in SPF 
process: The community targeted to be served and engaged in the SPF 
process is located in an area known as Central-South Phoenix (CSP). 
The general boundaries are Central Avenue on the east, I-17 freeway on the 
west, Jackson Street on the north, and I-17 on the south. Zip codes in the 
targeted area are: 85003, 85004, 85006, 85007, 85009, 85031, 85032, and 

176
Part IV: Writing a Competitive Application Narrative 
85041. Cultures in this area are tied strongly to ethnic ancestry. The 
hybrid mix of new immigrants from Mexico and multiple generations 
of minorities as well as nonminorities has bred many risk factors 
that contribute to the need for the SPF process in the targeted area.
Relevant demographic information: The total population of the City of 
Phoenix is 1,512,986. The targeted area, CSP, has at least 10 distinct 
neighborhoods with 201,462 residents. Racial makeup is 66.2 percent 
Hispanic; 19.5 percent White; 11.2 percent African American; and 1.5 per-
cent Native American. Thirty percent (60,400) of residents are ages 18 and 
younger; 43.7 percent of youth are female. The targeted census tracts 
have a 40 percent poverty rate — the highest in the city. Sixty percent 
of residents are high school dropouts, and 80 percent of adults are 
unemployed.
Collaborating to win: Partnerships that rock
Among today’s grantmakers, both in the private 
sector (foundation and corporate) and public 
sector (government), all expect grant applicants 
to have already formed partnerships with local, 
regional, state, and national agencies. This 
means you can’t go it alone anymore or keep 
all of the grant award pie for yourself. Partners 
have expectations and operate in a reciprocal 
frame of mind.
What’s a partnership? It’s a continuum of rela-
tionships that foster the sharing of resources, 
responsibility, and accountability in undertaking 
activities within a community. As you can imag-
ine, there are both pros and cons of involving 
your organization in a partnership.
As for the pros, partnerships do all of the fol-
lowing:
 ✓ Create new opportunities
 ✓ Initiate trust at the local level
 ✓ Expand your organization’s marketing/
target population area
 ✓ Expand your service image
 ✓ Help maximize your financial assets to a 
grantmaker by adding external leveraging 
and/or matching resources
 ✓ Improve your risk management abilities 
during a crisis
 ✓ Increase your competitive advantage in the 
grant seeking arena
 ✓ Provide access to broader financial and 
human resources
Inevitably, where there are pros, there are 
cons. When it comes to partnerships, the cons 
are mostly related to what the partners expect. 
They expect all of the following:
 ✓ A piece of the “grant” or “contract” pie
 ✓ An equal voice and vote in group decisions
 ✓ Reciprocal benefits from your organization 
(letters of support, MOU’s, grant alert shar-
ing, and more)

 Chapter 13: Building Grant Applicant Credibility
 
Usually, I advise grant writers to refrain from putting any needs statement 
language in the section of the proposal narrative that contains a description of 
the organization. However, I break this rule when I’m writing about any proj-
ects serving children — specifically, a target population under the age of 18. 
For children’s services programs, I drop hints of need every chance I can. This 
helps reach out and touch the hearts of the grant or cooperative agreement 
readers, whether foundation, corporate, state, or federal. I even use this tech-
nique in RFP narratives. It really works!
Writing About Your Collaboration 
with Partners
In the partnerships section of your organization description narrative, write 
about your organization’s local, regional, and national partnerships. What 
organizations do you team with to provide your program’s services? What 
organizations have asked you to write letters of support for their grant appli-
cations? What groups have historically supported you? If you find that this 
section of your narrative is a bit slim, Chapter 9 gives you more information 
about establishing community partners to give your grant application the 
competitive edge.
When writing about your partnerships, list the partner’s full name and its 
role in relation to your organization. Whether you’re writing a corporate or 
foundation funding request or a government funding request, the information 
you provide in your narrative on partnerships will be the same: who, where, 
and what role the partner plays.
 
As you write about your partnerships, don’t include an organization that 
you’re considering partnering with without first talking to a representative 
about what you’re doing and asking permission to include the organization in 
your proposal. It doesn’t reflect well on you if the funder calls your “partner” 
and that organization has no clue as to who you are and no knowledge of a 
partnership.
Partners are like friends: You get to know them inside and out, and you com-
plement each other in the delivery of like or unlike services. For example, say 
you operate a group home for mentally and physically challenged adults. In 
that case, you need to depend on the Get ’Em There Transportation Service 
to take your clients to and from medical appointments.

178
Part IV: Writing a Competitive Application Narrative 
When it comes time to review the partnership section of your funding appli-
cation, the grant reader looks for evidence of:
 
✓ Collaborative efforts with multiple partners to maximize the use of grant 
funds through the coordination of services to the target population (see 
the previous section for the lowdown on target populations)
 
✓ Partners that commit cash to reduce the amount of grant funding you need
 
✓ Partners that contribute personnel, space, equipment, supplies, and 
other valuable items to reduce the amount of grant funding needed
 
Your grant guidelines may call for your partnership information to appear 
at the beginning of the narrative, before the history and accomplishments. 
However, the partnerships could just as easily be placed after the problem 
statement or as an attachment. Read your grant application directions care-
fully before you start writing. The great thing about modern technology, how-
ever, is that little tool called cut and paste. You can move anything anywhere 
after it’s written.
In the following example, I briefly introduce a grant applicant’s partners 
and their roles in helping the applicant organization coordinate its services. 
Note that I write in third person. Also, note that the partners who contribute 
cash should be mentioned simply as cash contributors in your narrative. (See 
Chapter 17 for how to incorporate matching funds from your organization 
and its partners into the project budget summary and narrative detail.)
Saving Sisters works closely with local community, faith, and nonprofit 
organizations to develop a collective response to the complex issues facing 
this community. Currently, the agency works in collaboration with the fol-
lowing partners: Keys Community Center (space and volunteers); Grace 
Temple (space, administrative oversight, and volunteers); Children First 
(technical assistance); the Hope VI Project (our organization is a subgrantee 
and receives $40,000 annually from this partner); City of Lovedale (collab-
orative public events); and Mercury Gardens (transportation assistance). 
Participating organizations in the Strategic Prevention Framework will 
engage in recruitment, resource sharing, information distribution, training, 
and services intervention.
 
If you prefer, you can present this same information in a small table instead of 
a paragraph. After all, graphics and tables throughout your narrative give the 
grant reader a break from reading straight text. Remember that grant readers 
may have to read dozens of grant requests each week. You can give them a 
much-needed respite from standard sentences and win them over by using a 
table effectively.

179
 Chapter 13: Building Grant Applicant Credibility
When I’m writing a short (five pages or less) proposal for corporation or 
foundation funding sources, I only create a table to spotlight the grant appli-
cant organization’s partnerships when I have sufficient room on the second 
page to accommodate the entire table. Remember, you have four subsections 
to squeeze into two pages. Revert to using a narrative to describe your part-
nerships when a table format puts you over the page limit.
If you decide to use a table format to present the organizations with which 
you have a partnership, define their partnership role and include the value of 
their contributions. See Figure 13-1 for an example of how to present partner-
ships in a table format.

Presenting the Required Elements 
for Contract Bids
When you respond to an RFP (Request For Proposal), you position your com-
pany to win a contract bid. Pursuing contracted services on a regular basis 
can strengthen and grow your business. In the first section of your services 
proposal, you’re asked to write about your organization’s experience, exper-
tise, and reliability. Although this section of the services proposal is similar 
to the description of the organization section in a grant or cooperative agree-
ment request, it does differ in format. To keep on top of what’s required in 
the experience, expertise, and reliability section of a services proposal, the 
following information and examples show you
 
✓ How the bid-letting agency words its information request
 
✓ How to write a compelling narrative that convinces the agency that your 
business can deliver the services required

180
Part IV: Writing a Competitive Application Narrative 
Making sure you understand 
the guidelines
All RFPs are written differently, depending on the contract bid-letting agen-
cy’s standard template (developed internally by the procurement staff). Be 
on the lookout for this type of organizational information language in the 
guidelines and writing instructions of RFP documents:
Give a summary that details the Offeror’s experience, expertise, and number 
of years in providing the service.
 
To figure out the expected length of the summary, follow the page limitation 
instructions. And don’t forget that offeror refers to the bidding agency — 
that’s you!
Conveying the qualifications 
of your company
The experience, reliability, and expertise section of your services proposal 
should be divided into the following categories:
 
✓ Bidder: Type your company’s full legal name (the name you used to 
incorporate your business).
 
✓ Mission Statement: Provide the complete mission statement for your 
company.
 
✓ Areas of Expertise: List the areas of experience for your business, and 
don’t forget to include the corresponding years or time frames for those 
experiences.
 
✓ Track Record for Winning and Managing Contracts with Positive 
Client Outcomes/Collaborative Partners: Present your narrative or 
create a table showing the previous contracts your business has been 
awarded (specifically list the agencies or businesses, which are also 
referred to as your collaborative partners) and the outcomes (list the 
numbers of individuals served or the number of products sold).
 
✓ Background of Bidder: Provide information on your company’s back-
ground. For example, note when your company was formed. Make sure 
to provide details to validate the impact or effectiveness of the program, 
product, or service that you’re proposing in this services proposal.
 
✓ Current Service Levels: Include the names of your services, programs, 
and products along with the current levels for their provisions.

181
 Chapter 13: Building Grant Applicant Credibility
 
Always use a formal tone when writing services proposals. Use the third-
person writing tips I cover in the earlier section “Laying the Organizational 
Capability Foundation.” To make an impact on the bidding proposal reviewer, 
I bold, italicize, and underline key terms in my services proposals.
Here’s a sample of a winning response for the experience, reliability, and 
expertise section of a services proposal:
Bidder: New Directions Chamber of Commerce.
Mission Statement: To provide members with the highest quality and level 
of customer service in order to promote their presence, products, and goods 
to the Ramona Valley region.
Areas of Expertise: Thirty years as a formally organized Chamber of 
Commerce. The combined staff of six full-time individuals has more than 64 
years of business and public sector experience.
Track Record for Winning and Managing Contracts with Positive 
Client Outcomes/Collaborative Partners: The New Directions Chamber 
of Commerce has been bidding on and winning competitive state and fed-
eral contract awards since 1985. To date, the Chamber has received and 
prudently managed more than $6 million in outside revenues, not including 
membership dues.
Background of Bidder: The New Directions Chamber of Commerce was 
formed when the county’s population grew to 75,000 persons. At the time, 
in 1978, Ramona Valley had a total of 700 small- to mid-size businesses. 
Fertile land for agribusiness and low cost utilities drew hundreds of more 
businesses here. In 2000, there were 1,200 businesses of all sizes, including 
three Fortune 500 corporations. In 2008, this number increased to 2,500 
businesses, 39 national franchises, and 12 Fortune 500 corporations. All of 
the past and new businesses are members of the New Directions Chamber 
of Commerce. Total revenues from membership dues exceed $1 million 
annually.
Current Service Levels: The Chamber has the following services and mem-
bership participation levels: general membership (2,500); business-to-business 
network (1,800); monthly membership luncheon (400 to 500 is the average 
attendance); and annual Sister City visit (25 members are selected to attend 
by a regional panel of trip application reviewers).
You can also use a table for this information. Figure 13-2 is an example of how 
a simple table can convey your organization’s capability.

Chapter 14
Conveying a Hopeless Situation 
and a Need for Funds
In This Chapter
▶ Explaining the problem that grant funds will solve
▶ Using graphics to drive your point home
▶ Including the right info in a contract bid’s problem statement
S
o you’ve been looking for grant and contract monies for weeks — maybe 
months. You’ve also been reading lots of grant funding opportunities 
and subscribing to e-mail alerts on potential grant monies. And when you 
finished writing the Organizational Capability or Background section of your 
application, you stopped to take a deep breath. I’m glad you did! Recharge 
yourself and prepare to proceed at full speed in this chapter.
This chapter is all about the needs statement (which is also referred to as the 
problem statement). It tells the grant reviewer that you know what you’re talk-
ing about. It oozes gloom, doom, drama, and trauma. You must get your point 
across in the most effective, attention-drawing, memorable way that you 
can. How do you do that? By writing from your heart (where your emotional 
center lies) and by telling the story of how bad things really are for your 
target population.
 
Gather the facts, read them, and highlight the most compelling or startling 
statistics, events, life stories, situations, and so forth. Then think about what 
it would be like if you were reading about yourself, your family, or your close 
friends. You would feel sad, disheartened, even disconnected from society’s 
mainstream. Keep those feelings fresh and you’re ready to write a compelling 
statement!

184
Part IV: Writing a Competitive Application Narrative 
Making the Problem Come to Life 
with the Problem Statement
When you’re writing your problem statement, remember this: Grant writing 
is like storytelling. Like all great stories, your problem statement must be 
compelling, magnetizing, entertaining, and believable. With all that emotion 
floating around, you’ll really be in need of a break, right? Don’t worry. I try to 
inject some humor when discussing the more difficult sections of the grant 
application narrative. Hopefully the comic relief will lighten your getting 
started stress.
Finding pertinent information
 
Every good problem statement is like a well-written story. And every well-written 
story is filled with compelling details that bring the narrative to life in the mind 
of the reader. So, to write your story, you need to gather all the available data 
from your organization’s own materials. Then you can fill in the gaps with addi-
tional research.
Start off by looking for current statistics on your services and programs. Try 
looking at board of director meeting minutes, copies of annual reports (usu-
ally gathered by the program staff and presented to the board in the first 
quarter of your organization’s fiscal year). Also, become the Sherlock Holmes 
you always wanted to be and search out copies of old grant applications. 
Whether these applications were funded or not, they still contain critical sta-
tistics and other problem statement information.
After you’ve found all the available statistics, use the Internet to fill in any 
information gaps. You can search for missing information about your identi-
fied need and additional data on your target population.
You conduct an Internet search in hopes of finding the following problem-
related information:
 
✓ Similar problem area trends in other communities with characteristics 
like yours (rural, urban, increases or declines in population)
 
✓ Emerging demographics on the magnitude of the problem 
(Congressional testimonies, research findings by experts and graduate 
students, and newly issued press releases from government agencies or 
government watchdogs)
 
✓ Solutions to the problem (even though you don’t go over solutions to 
the problem in the problem statement section of your proposal)

185
 Chapter 14: Conveying a Hopeless Situation and a Need for Funds
 
To find up-to-date and relevant information, I recommend that you run a gen-
eral search on a major search engine. A general search results in hundreds 
of local, regional, and national government Web site links. This approach is 
much easier than trying to find the Internet address for a specific information 
site. For example, if your organization works with the elderly to help them 
with home-based health care needs, you can enter the phrase “elderly home-
based care statistics” in your favorite Web browser. You’re likely to find a lot 
of relevant information on the Web site of your state’s Area Agency on Aging 
office or on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Web site.
When I’m visualizing and writing my problem statements, I like to have stacks 
of current problem-related information in front of me for review. I look at 
information provided by the grant application organization, and I study my 
own Internet research findings. I sort all this information by topic (for exam-
ple, health care, dementia, home security, trends in preventable injuries, 
home alone fatalities for the elderly, and more). Then I simply put the topical 
stacks into chronological order (by year, with the most recent year on top).
 
The more information you have on your topic, the easier it is to write a win-
ning statement of need. With the right preparation, you aren’t grasping for 
straws or generalizing; instead, you’re able to give the grant reader true, hard, 
grant-getting facts. And by including citations for data sources and names of 
noteworthy researchers, you show the grant reader that your information is 
accurate and reputable.
Putting potent writing tips to use
The grant reader expects a good problem statement to answer the following 
questions:
 
✓ How and when did you identify the problem?
 
✓ Do you have a thorough understanding of the problem at the local, 
regional, and national levels?
 
✓ Do you cite statistics and research conducted by your organization and 
others that support the problem statement? Is this information current? 
(See the earlier section “Finding pertinent information” for more about 
research.)
 
✓ Are you seeking funds for a problem that can be solved in one year (the 
length of most grant awards)?
In a foundation or corporate funding request, your problem statement should 
be one typed, single-spaced page (private sector funders typically request 
single-spaced formatting). In a government grant or cooperative request, the 
problem statement can be anywhere from two to five typed, single-spaced or 
double-spaced pages.

186
Part IV: Writing a Competitive Application Narrative 
Beyond simply answering the questions in the previous list, you can capture 
a grant reader’s attention by telling her how the monies can make a differ-
ence. Grant readers want to see large population impact numbers that show 
how far you can stretch their grant dollars, thus making a difference for 
many, not just a few. You don’t want to write in depth about the program 
design until you’re in the actual program section, but including general com-
ments on how the funding will be used is okay in the needs section. (See 
Chapter 15 for more about program design.)
 
Write each paragraph in your needs section so that it builds on the paragraph 
before it. It’s important to make your ideas connect and flow because each new 
paragraph is a step toward the final paragraph that asks for funding support to 
solve the problem. Each new paragraph adds excitement and urgency. If these 
steps sound like those used to write a bestselling story, you’re right on target. 
You write your winning grant proposal the same way you do a bestseller!
In my problem statement, I love to use words and phrases that carry a lot of 
weight, such as abandoned, alone, isolated, disconnected, helpless, victims of 
prey, unsuspecting, confused, taken for granted, throwaways, and disrespected. 
These sample words can be used when there are far too many elderly indi-
viduals left to fend for themselves. Are you getting the picture of need? This 
type of writing works well in government or private sector grant narratives.
You can also crank up the empathy and your chances for funding by using 
extreme adjectives such as inadequate, outdated, miniscule, underserved, and 
worthless. (For more hints on using impactive words, flip to Chapter 11.)
 
Don’t hide key words or phrases in ordinary-type text. Elevate your grant 
writing by using bold type and italics to make a word or phrase stand out. 
Personally, I like to call attention to important text with bold black or red 
font. Stimulating the reader by playing with the look of the text often results 
in a speedy funding decision. Bold adjectives and dire phrases; keep the style 
changes minimal, yet effective in making your point.
Knowing when you’ve written 
enough of the right stuff
Sometimes the hardest part about writing your problem statement is know-
ing when you’re done. After you’ve written five to ten grant applications, you 
develop an intuition as to when it’s time to wrap up a section and move on to 
the next one. But in the beginning, it’s difficult to decide whether you’ve writ-
ten enough to convince a grant reader that you truly have a need that can 
only be solved with grant funding.

187
 Chapter 14: Conveying a Hopeless Situation and a Need for Funds
Generally, when you can answer yes to the following questions, you’re ready 
to move to the next section in your grant application:
 
✓ Did you use recent research by others on the issue?
 
✓ Did you present recent findings of your own surveys and constituent 
feedback?
 
✓ Did you include relevant statistical indicators?
 
✓ Did you give the grant reader enough information to understand 
the problem? (Assume that he or she has no prior knowledge of the 
problem.)
 
✓ Did you use descriptive words to give the grant reader a virtual visual 
introduction to your organization’s operating environment? (See 
Chapter 11 for more on words that work.)
 
✓ Did you stay focused and write only about the organization’s need — 
staying clear of the solution until the next narrative section?
 
✓ Did you use words that have the ability to create compassion and 
urgency in the grant reader’s mind and heart?
You know you’ve written a convincing and compelling needs statement 
when you get out your hanky to dab away a few tears after rereading your 
masterpiece!
 
If you have a summary of a needs survey or letters from organizations docu-
menting that the demands for your services are greater than your resources 
to deliver the services, attach these documents to your application. Always 
reference such attachments in the narrative so grant readers can refer to them 
and get their full effect while reading the needs statement. These support doc-
uments allow a grant reader to verify the actual need for grant funding. (See 
Chapter 18 for information on how to organize your attachments.)
 
Beside all the previous advice, I have another general rule that may help you 
decide when to wrap up your needs section: When you can’t think of anything 
more to write or say to the grant reader, stop! Running out of thoughts means 
that you’re done with this section and that it’s time to move on to the next 
section of the grant application. If you continue to write more than needed, 
you may repeat information already written or regress (start begging beyond 
belief for money).
In the following sections, I provide excerpts from an ongoing example. You 
can tell that the example problem statement is complete because it includes 
information that touches on each of the following main topics:

188
Part IV: Writing a Competitive Application Narrative 
 
✓ Background info on the applicant and the problem
 
✓ The population that the applicant serves
 
✓ The environment in which the applicant works
 
✓ The severity of the problem
Laying out details of the applicant and the problem
The funding agency wants to know about the applicant and the background 
of the problem. Consider the following example excerpt to see how it’s done:
The Neighborhood Self Help Group is located in South Peoria. It was 
founded in 2007 by Cecilia Pasternak, a long-time resident and community 
activist. Cecilia believes that anyone can reach their goals for a safe 
and revitalized neighborhood if they work as teams or partners to make 
change — one step at a time.
Our agency is located in a target area which presents myriad challenges: 
high substance abuse among youth; high suicide rate; poor peer 
relationships; behavior/discipline problems; low self-esteem; lack 
of positive role models; dysfunctional home environments; lack of 
positive leisure activities; economic deprivation; and unsafe school/
neighborhood environments.
In 2007, a focus group was created for community feedback. The focus 
group process involved 85 community residents who represented the eight 
zip codes in the targeted area. Over a three-month period, in five meetings, 
residents identified specific concerns, needs, services, and programs they 
desired to improve their lives and economic status.
The results of the focus group showed that the major concerns among South 
Peoria residents are the same challenges that our Group had already pre-
identified in the second paragraph of this narrative section. While this is 
confirming, it’s still alarming!
Telling the funder about the people being served
The funder wants to know about the populations that the grant applicant 
serves and how the services are rendered. Here’s an example showing how 
you might convey this information:
The neighborhood residents served are predominantly Hispanic (75 per-
cent) and low income (99 percent). Many do not speak English as a first lan-
guage and must use their children (who have learned English in school) to 
interpret for them at community meetings, at school, and in grocery stores. 
The Neighborhood Self Help Group provides food boxes, utility payment cut-
off advocacy, transportation to medical appointments, and housing rehabili-
tation (air conditioning, furnace, and plumbing repairs).

189
 Chapter 14: Conveying a Hopeless Situation and a Need for Funds
Describing the environment in which the applicant functions
The funder needs to know about the environment in which the organization 
operates, such as a neighborhood location. This paragraph should present the 
number of people served and who they are. It should also address any service 
limitations. The following excerpt shows how to describe this information:
The Neighborhood Self Help Group is located in South Peoria — an area 
long abandoned by two-parent working class families and local businesses. 
The median income for single-parent households (90% of the residents do 
not have a spouse) is $12,750. The average household has multiple families 
struggling to meet their monthly “near downtown” rent which averages 70 
percent of their household income. Among this population, 10 percent are 
elderly and reside in low-income qualifying public housing apartments. The 
entire area is blighted and depressing. Our Group serves 100 percent of the 
neighborhood’s residents (4,350) through one or more monthly “helping” 
programs.
Relating how dire the problem really is
The funder should see evidence that the applicant has a thorough under-
standing of the problem, accomplished by documenting the continuing saga 
of the organization. It’s important to pile on the gloom, doom, drama, and 
trauma in this paragraph because you need to successfully convey the need 
for grant monies. You must convey that monies are scarce and times are 
hard! Check out this example:
South Peoria has been long abandoned by residential and commercial 
developers. The tax base has declined to an all time low due to the dete-
riorating single and multiple family structures — many were built before 
1950. Most days, residents start lining up at our side door as early as 6 a.m.; 
our neighborhood food pantry and counseling center does not open until 9 
a.m. The volunteers are overwhelmed with the myriad needs of those who 
seek our services. Our limited paid professional staff of three often work 12 
hours a day seeing clients even though our offices officially close at 5 p.m. 
On Saturdays, which was once a day that we were closed, emergency food 
supplements and diapers are distributed. It’s a never ending struggle to keep 
up with the demands of those who depend on us for their daily survival.
Our Board of Directors is made of members of the neighborhood. It’s truly 
a stakeholder’s Board. However, they lack the education and savvy to par-
ticipate effectively in the Board meetings; most importantly, they have no 
skills in fundraising including grant seeking and grant writing. Our budget 
is stretched so tight now that there are absolutely no extra funds to hire a 
fundraiser or grant writer. We feel like we’re at the end of a long and dark 
road — there is no light at the end of the days that are full of hundreds of 
work demands.

190
Part IV: Writing a Competitive Application Narrative 
Integrating Graphics into 
Your Problem Statement
Reading nothing but sentences can get dull. Luckily, graphics offer visual 
relief from chunks of text. Charts, tables, and maps make the grant reader 
linger longer on a page. And the longer someone reflects on your particular 
problem, the better your chances are for receiving funding.
 
Here are some suggestions that can help you to avoid overwhelming the grant 
or cooperative agreement reader:
 
✓ Limit your graphics to one per page in the problem or needs statement 
section of the grant proposal.
 
✓ Don’t overdo it with colors in your graphics.
In this section, it’s important to present the problems in a way that doesn’t 
bore the grant reader. Presenting demographic after demographic in narrative 
format can confuse or tire the reader. Introducing a table, chart, or other type 
of graphic breaks up the text and creates an easy-to-read pictorial-type insert. I 
like to use comparison tables and bar graphs to wow my grant readers.
Adding comparison tables 
and other graphics
Tables and other graphics are a great way to drive home a point about the 
target population. Plus it gives the reader a break from straight text.
Figure 14-1 shows a graph that’s particularly effective because it tells the 
reader how the risk indicators in the grant applicant’s targeted area com-
pare to state-level risk indicators. This is referred to as a comparison table. 
It shows how your target population area compares to a similar area or to 
the state’s statistics for the same indicators. In my example, county high risk 
indicators clearly surpass the state’s indicators — a plus for validating your 
critical need for grant funding.
 
Use more than one type of graphic if you have a lot of demographics on your 
target population. Try a mixture of bar graphs, pie charts, and tables. Figure 
14-2 demonstrates the increased visual impact of an ordinary pie chart when 
you use variegated color effects. Using multiple graphics allows the reader to 
see the extent of the problem from a glance — not a read through.

I like pie charts because they take the grant or cooperative agreement reader 
from linear reading (text lines and rows of table-contained information) to a 
circular view — a minor visual change aimed to win the reader’s approval of 
the problem or needs statement section of your funding request.
 
When you create a pie chart, consider including only the most relevant informa-
tion. Too many categories could make your pie slices indistinguishable. I prefer 
to limit my pie charts to no more than six slices or divisions of information.
Including relevant maps
When pulling together a needs statement, I especially like to include maps 
of the proposed service area. Maps tell the grant or cooperative agreement 
reader where your services will be targeted or how far the problem area 
spans. Maps are easy to find on the Internet and are almost always in color. 
You can use a map as a graphic insert, as in Figure 14-3, or as a watermark 
that would appear in the background of your text. If you use a map as a 
graphic insert, keep it contained to one-half page or less.

192
Part IV: Writing a Competitive Application Narrative 
 
If you use a map created by someone else, you need to cite the source of the 
map by entering a footnote at the bottom of the page that your map appears on.
Look for maps that show the service area related to your problem or need. 
For instance, if the service area is statewide, use a state map; if the service 
area is regional, use a regional map.

 Chapter 14: Conveying a Hopeless Situation and a Need for Funds
Making visualization work
The previous sections point out the types of graphics you might use in your 
problem statement, but this section contains some tips on how to success-
fully use those graphics. Consider the following:
 
✓ Reserve tables for large amounts of information.
 
✓ Use bar and pie charts when you want to communicate age ranges by 
groups, income by groups, and numerical breakdowns of target popula-
tion indicators.
 
✓ When you use statistics, always cite the source. You can insert a credit 
line directly below each graphic, or you can insert footnotes. In some 
funding documents in which the formatting guidelines bar the use of 
footnotes, you can create endnotes or a reference page.
 
 Failing to cite the sources of statistics can cause your request to lose 
peer review points or to be denied funding support.
 
 I was schooled in using the American Psychological Association (APA) 
reference citation format. This style requires you to insert a superscript 
number at the end of the citation and then type the source in the docu-
ment’s footer. If the funding agency doesn’t have specific instructions on 
reference citations, you can find all sorts of examples of APA format and 
others in writing stylebooks, online, or at the library.
 
✓ When the funder limits the number of pages you have to develop your 
narrative, you must improvise when it comes to sneaking in much-
needed graphics. Try wrapping text around a graphic or typing text over 
a watermark graphic.
 
✓ Stay away from using clip art in your needs statement unless that’s 
all you have. Clip art doesn’t create an authentic picture of any dire 
situation, so it will likely make little impact on reviewers. However, 
sometimes, I use clip art of a broken link to emphasize services gaps or 
organizational weaknesses.
Conveying Your Knowledge of the Need 
for RFP Service Delivery Points
When you respond to an RFP (Request For Proposal), you must demonstrate 
in-depth knowledge of the need for contracted services. And remember that 
when it comes to writing a problem or needs statement, RFPs differ from 
grant or cooperative agreement funding proposals.

194
Part IV: Writing a Competitive Application Narrative 
Contract bid-letting agencies have already researched the problem or need. 
They’re releasing an RFP to address the problem, and in the RFP guidelines, 
they include research information on the problem or need. These agencies 
then go on to tell the bidder (also called the offeror) which needs are agency 
priorities and what to specifically address in the program design or scope of 
services section (jump to Chapter 15 for more information). So, essentially, 
much of the background work is already done for you.
Be on the lookout for any type of language in the RFP document that asks for 
“understanding of the need or problem.” Here’s an example:
The City of Peoria has collected vast information on its southern most neigh-
borhoods. However, all bidders are expected to provide their own detailed 
knowledge of the demographics of this RFP target area in order to 
further support the need for neighborhood capacity building — the 
focus of this RFP.
 
To craft a winning reply to this type of request, do the following:
 
✓ Tell the reader what your company does (for example, maybe you plan to 
propose board of director and volunteer training in the area of capacity 
building for all nonprofits located in or serving South Peoria residents).
 
✓ Give the reader demographics on your proposed service population.
 
✓ Boldface and italicize words that relate to large quantities and that draw 
attention to dire circumstances.
 
✓ Use headings and subheadings that reflect the RFP guidelines’ instruc-
tions for areas to respond to when writing the Understanding of the 
Needs subsection in your scope of services narrative.
The following is an example of how to write an Understanding of the Needs 
response in the RFP’s scope of services section. To properly format this 
response, the section title should be centered, and each subsection should 
be underlined and placed flush left.
 
Scope of Services To Be Provided
Understanding of the Need
The targeted region of the RFP, South Peoria, is well known to the bidder. 
For the past 20 years, our training corporation has been training underrep-
resented residents to become community advocates. Prior to our previously 
delivered contracted services under the Neighborhood Service Center 
funding program, there were no Neighborhood Block Clubs or Crime 
Watches. In addition, the housing abandonment rate was 80 percent. With 
training and ongoing resources through our dozen or more service delivery 

195
 Chapter 14: Conveying a Hopeless Situation and a Need for Funds
contracts, those demographics have changed: 12 Neighborhood Block Clubs 
were formed and are now meeting regularly and are highly functional; 200 
residents now volunteer for seven nights weekly of neighborhood crime 
watching; and there has been a reduction in the housing abandonment rate 
from 80 percent to 40 percent. If any one bidder has an understanding of the 
need for continuing capacity building services in South Peoria, it’s us, the 
Corporation for Housing Support and Neighborhood Revitalization.

Laying Out the Plan of Action: 
Program Design and 
Accountability
In This Chapter
▶ Explaining what you want upfront
▶ Creating a vision through goals and objectives
▶ Putting together a timeline chart
▶ Examining the Logic Model
▶ Developing an evaluation plan
W
ith this chapter, you’re revving up for the big event — the program 
design. The grant writing process can make you feel like you’re 
climbing a mountain. But by this point in the game, you’ve reached the top 
and you’re ready for the high adrenaline, high oxygen level type of thinking 
and writing. You’re ready to write about your vision — about the positive 
changes you could bring about if only you had some money!
The program design section is the one where you get to tell the funding or 
bid-letting agency what you’re going to do when you’re awarded the grant or 
contract for the proposed services or programs. Your key to success is being 
optimistic when writing this section. The following are the main ingredients:
 
1. A purpose statement: A one-sentence, direct explanation of why you’re 
seeking funds.
 
2. Goals: Where your program or constituency aims to be when the grant 
funds are used up.
 
3. Outcome objectives: Measurable benchmarks or specific steps that lead 
up to the accomplishment of your goals.

198
Part IV: Writing a Competitive Application Narrative 
 
4. An implementation plan with timelines: A plan listing the implementa-
tion tasks that are required to meet and exceed your measurable objec-
tives and when they’ll be implemented.
 
5. A Logic Model: Lays out (using table formatting) a graphic road map 
with inputs, strategies, outputs, and outcomes.
 
6. Evaluation: Shows how you will track the progress of the project’s 
objectives, what data collection tools you’ll use to gather information 
about the project, and who will conduct the evaluation. This section 
screams accountability!
 
 In some grant applications, evaluation plans may be asked for sepa-
rately, in a section following the program design or even in an attach-
ment. However, many government funders, along with foundation and 
corporate grantmakers, are realizing the importance of having you, the 
grant applicant, integrate your evaluation plan into the program design.
The entire program design must give the grant reviewer a detailed explana-
tion of the big picture. In other words, you must lay out each section as if you 
were placing the pieces into a large puzzle. The large puzzle is your program 
design, and the pieces are each of the previously listed elements.
Stating What You Want: 
Specifying Your Purpose
As the first part of your program design narrative, the purpose statement tells 
the grant reader why you’re asking for grant monies. You have two types of 
purpose statements to choose from: direct and indirect.
A direct purpose statement includes the amount of the requested grant award. 
Remember that even when you mention a dollar amount, the purpose statement 
should not exceed one sentence. Get to the point and tell the grant reader the 
purpose of the grant request and the amount of funds needed. Use the following 
example as a guide for writing your own direct purpose statement.
The Mark Welby Corporation is seeking a contractual arrangement with 
Ashton County in the award amount of $350,000 to deliver home-based 
home health care services to 4,000 elderly residents who meet the county’s 
Area Agency on Aging’s service eligibility requirements.
An indirect purpose statement simply tells the reader the purpose of the grant 
request — a program or project in need of funding. The example that follows 
shows you how an indirect purpose statement should sound.

199
 Chapter 15: Laying Out the Plan of Action
The purpose of this request is to seek grant funding to establish an endow-
ment fund for our nonprofit organization — one that perpetuates sustain-
ability for the myriad programs and services provided to the residents of 
Arlington, Virginia.
 
I prefer to use a direct purpose statement in foundation and corporate funding 
requests because it more efficiently gets to the point for the reader who will 
make the final decisions on whether to fund you and on the amount of funding 
you will receive. However, I use the indirect purpose statement for govern-
ment grant proposals and cooperative agreements because government grant 
peer reviewers don’t make those same final decisions. An agency staff person 
with authority over the grantmaking initiative is in charge of that. Therefore, 
no actual amount of monies requested should appear in the purpose state-
ment of government funding requests.
Crafting Goals and Objectives
The next ingredients in your program design narrative are goals and objec-
tives. Your program’s goals address the big-picture success of your program, 
and the objectives are the ways you plan to reach those goals. Always pro-
vide objectives for each goal and each year for which you’re requesting funds 
for an activity. The objectives are benchmarks of what you want to happen 
during the funding time frame. The benchmarks must be measurable. Funding 
agencies view measurable steps as signs of accountability — showing how 
their money will make an impact on the problem.
I don’t have a magic number for goals and objectives. However, I can’t stress 
enough that your organization’s goals are based on the vision of where you 
want the program or target population to be when the grant or contract 
period is over.
 
When I’m writing a government grant request, I develop my goals using the 
funder’s goals for the funding initiative. I then create measurable objectives 
to track all the funding initiative’s intended outcomes. Everything you need to 
cue you on how many goals and how many objectives to write is right there 
in the grant application guidelines. However, when I’m writing a proposal to a 
foundation or corporation, I have nothing to cue me on what the funder wants 
to see or fund in terms of funder goals and objectives. In those cases, I keep it 
light and usually write a minimum of three goals and a maximum of six. And 
each goal always has one to three measurable outcome objectives.
 
If the funding decision maker can’t look at your goals and objectives and 
figure out from them what your entire program is about, you’ve failed to write 
clearly stated goals.

200
Part IV: Writing a Competitive Application Narrative 
If you’re new to grant or contract bid writing, you may sometimes mistake 
goals for objectives, or vice versa. To keep these two terms straight, think of 
goal first and remember that it is, according to Webster’s New World College 
Dictionary, the “end that one strives to attain.” The key word to keep in mind 
is end. A goal is where you are when you’re done. Grant application and 
contract bid document narratives must have goals to show the funder or bid-
letting agency that you have a vision for solving the problem.
Okay, so what about an objective? An objective is simply a major milestone or 
checkpoint on your route to reaching a goal. It’s a place where you can say 
(and report to a funder, if necessary), “We’ve come this far, and we have this 
far remaining before we reach the goal.” Objectives have to be attainable, and 
they must serve to keep goals realistic.
Writing great goals
 
When you’re in the process of writing your goals, be sure to write clear, con-
cise, one-sentence statements. The goals can apply to where you picture your 
organization or your target population at the end of the grant period. Goals 
should be action-oriented and full of verbs (see Chapter 11 for more on choos-
ing impactful words). But don’t include any measurements or timelines in the 
goal statements; those items are saved for your objectives, which I cover later 
in this chapter.
To be sure you’ve written effective and well-constructed goal statements, ask 
yourself the following questions:
 
✓ Did I use one sentence?
 
✓ Is the sentence clear and concise?
 
✓ Does the grant reader know who the target population is?
 
✓ Did I deliberately not include measurements and timelines?
The following are examples of some effective goal statements. These state-
ments, used successfully in a Department of Homeland Security grant appli-
cation, should give you an idea of how to express your own goals:
Goal 1: The Mesa Fire Department will design a new Fire Safety Program 
to meet the public education needs of Latino families with preschool-age 
children.
Goal 2: The Mesa Fire Department will promote and publicize the 
“Familias Viajando A Seguridad” Program in the local media and will ask 
for corporate sponsorships in order to assure that fire safety public educa-
tion is both long-term and self-sustaining in the community.

201
 Chapter 15: Laying Out the Plan of Action
Goal 3: The Mesa Fire Department will continue to target children who are six 
years and younger — a United States Fire Administration high-risk group — in 
its public education campaign efforts.
Goal 4: The “Familias Viajando A Seguridad” Program will not only benefit 
the entire City of Mesa but also will be made available to over three dozen 
direct aid and mutual aid fire departments in Maricopa County, Arizona.
Goal 5: The “Familias Viajando A Seguridad” Program will signal to the 
Latino community that injuries to children are preventable and that children 
are our most important human assets by saturating targeted families with 
over a dozen take-home injury prevention reminders and installation-ready 
smoke detectors.
Goal 6: Low-income Latino families will benefit from the four child safety 
seat distributions planned by the Mesa Fire Department.
Providing out of this world objectives
Successful grant writing requires you to understand the three types of 
objectives — process objectives, outcome objectives, and impact objectives — 
and know when to use them. Putting them to good use can rack up peer 
review or procurement agency points (see Chapters 9 and 10 for more on 
the review process). They can also help you win big bucks for your program. 
Note: Objectives can also be referred to as milestones or benchmarks.
 
Always provide objectives for each goal and each year for which you’re 
requesting funds for an activity.
Objectives can be measured at a certain point in time, whether you’re track-
ing grade point average increases in youth or the number of parents who par-
ticipate in a parent-training program. Taking a look at your progress is called 
data collection and analysis. Determining how much progress you’ve made is 
called evaluating. Later in this chapter, I tell you about the tasks involved in 
the evaluation process.
 
Some program designs have more than one objective for each goal. If this 
is the case with your design, make sure you number and alphabetize the 
objectives (for example, 1a, 1b, 1c, and so on) to eliminate confusion for the 
reviewer.
Creating SMART outcome objectives
How do you recognize an outcome objective? It’s an objective that shows that 
the project has accomplished the activities it planned to achieve. Always 
create outcome objectives for your programs or projects. They’re the most 
common type of objectives that funders ask for in their grant application 
guidelines.

202
Part IV: Writing a Competitive Application Narrative 
When writing your own outcome objectives, use phrases such as to increase 
or to decrease. These phrases imply some sort of measurable change. For 
example, you can write about an increase of 50 percent in the number of 
organizations receiving project services by the end of Year 1.
 
The easiest way to write outcome objectives is to think “SMART.” SMART is 
a quick and easy acronym to keep you on track. Here’s what the acronym 
stands for: specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time bound. You can 
use the following SMART formula for writing outstanding outcome objectives:
 
✓ S: Is the objective specific, rather than abstract?
 
✓ M: Is the objective measurable? Can it be tracked easily with valid 
measurement tools, such as surveys, pre- and post-needs assessments, 
and more?
 
✓ A: Is the objective attainable? Can my organization really pull off the 
objective?
 
✓ R: Is the objective realistic? Can the measurement actually be attained 
for the target population in the given time frame?
 
✓ T: Is the objective time bound? Can my organization accomplish all the 
required tasks to achieve the objective in the given time frame?
The following SMART outcome objectives were written for the six goals in the 
Mesa Fire Department example earlier in this chapter:
1. By the end of Year 1, increase child injury prevention knowledge among 
Latinos by 25 percent or more.
2. By the end of Year 1, expand school-based fire safety public education 
activities by 25 percent or more.
3. By the end of Year 1, increase the “Familias Viajando A Seguridad” 
Program sites by 100 percent in the second six months of the FEMA funding 
year.
4. By the end of Year 1, introduce the bilingual injury prevention curriculum 
to at least 40 percent or more of Maricopa County’s three-dozen plus com-
munities.
5. By the end of Year 1, reduce all unintentional injuries among preschool-
age Latino children in Mesa by 25 percent or more.
6. By the end of Year 1, reduce unintentional injuries related to improper or no 
seat belt usage among preschool-age Latino children by 50 percent or more.

203
 Chapter 15: Laying Out the Plan of Action
Producing process objectives
Process objectives are the activities needed to reach your goals and meet or 
exceed your measurable outcome (or SMART) objectives. The best way to 
present your process objectives is in a table format. Make sure to follow the 
funder’s or bid-letting agency’s guidelines when setting up your timeline seg-
ments. I like to use quarters; however, some funders ask for monthly time-
lines for all activities.
For effective process objectives, write about the actual, chronological activi-
ties that need to occur from the time you receive grant or contract fund-
ing until the monies have been spent. List the process objectives, or main 
activities, in a timeline chart (which I explain in the later section “Preparing 
a Timeline Chart That Spans the Grant Funding Period”). Figure 15-1 (shown 
later in the chapter) is an example of how I would write the process objec-
tives for the Mesa Fire Department example that I introduce earlier in the 
chapter.
 
Don’t write in measurable terms when discussing your process objectives. For 
example, don’t use increase or decrease. These terms are reserved for SMART 
objectives. Instead, write in quantifiable terms, such as “40 teachers will be 
trained to help firefighters deliver seat belt safety curriculum” or “14 new 
classes will be introduced to the seat belt safety curriculum in the first quarter.”
Identifying impact objectives
Impact objectives demonstrate the achievement of the goal of the project or 
program. They show the reader how you will determine that there has been 
an impact or change in the participants’ knowledge. For example, you can 
write about changes in the target population’s values or beliefs.
 
If you come across a grant application in which the funding agency asks you 
to write about benefits to participants, respond by using impact objectives. 
Benefits to participants are really presumptions of how your participants will 
change because of the grant-funded program’s intervention.
Impact objectives are easy to identify. They include monumental changes in 
the way your target population behaves. This behavior change can include 
anything from changes in attitude to changes in value or judgment. Unlike 
process objectives, there are no common words to cue your writing. The 
funder is looking for signs of significant change — change brought on by the 
interventions that the funder made possible.
Here are some examples of effective impact objectives:

204
Part IV: Writing a Competitive Application Narrative 
Impact Objective 1: Brings public attention to the number of unintentional 
injuries among the high-risk, limited English-speaking target group: young 
Latino children.
Impact Objective 2: Creates awareness among parents, caregivers, and 
extended Latino families of the causes of fires and other unintentional inju-
ries and shows how to prevent them.
Impact Objective 3: Introduces a fire safety public education program to 
a segment of the county that has never been included in any municipality’s 
fire prevention campaigns.
Impact Objective 4: Brings countywide attention to the need for fire pre-
vention and unintentional injury prevention weaknesses and gaps and 
encourages contribution of financial support to the Mesa Fire Department in 
order to sustain the “Familias Viajando A Seguridad” Program after FEMA 
Federal Fire Act grant funds are expended.
Preparing a Timeline Chart That 
Spans the Grant Funding Period
A timeline tells the grant reader when activities (also referred to as process 
objectives) will begin and end during the grant’s funding period (which is 
usually a 12-month period). When you develop a project timeline, keep in 
mind that the grant reader wants to see answers to the following questions:
 
✓ What are the key tasks or activities that will be carried out to implement 
the program successfully?
 
✓ Did the grant applicant include all tasks, from the day funding is 
announced or awarded to the last day of the project’s funding time 
frame?
 
✓ Can each task realistically begin and end in the proposed time frame?
 
✓ Are evaluation activities included in the timeline chart?
 
✓ Who is responsible for seeing that each activity is implemented and 
completed?
 
You can use your word-processing software to create a simple timeline table. 
Just be sure not to overdo it with color; stick with one or two shading selec-
tions (gray or a light color so the reader can still read the text in the table’s 
cells). Because there are no absolutes on the number of disruptions and 
malfunctions in implementing a grant-funded program, I prefer to set up my 

205
 Chapter 15: Laying Out the Plan of Action
activity start and stop dates in quarterly increments. However, if you have 
total control over the activities, you can use monthly increments to show 
when they start and stop or begin and end.
See Figure 15-1 for an example of an activity timeline. It clearly shows what 
the program plans to accomplish, when it plans to accomplish it, and who is 
responsible for seeing the activities (process objectives) through the comple-
tion phase.
 
For programs that request funding for multiple years, extra timelines need to 
be included in the grant application or contract bid showing each year’s activi-
ties and the quarterly time frames for each activity.

Part IV: Writing a Competitive Application Narrative 
Building a Program Design Road 
Map with the Logic Model
The Logic Model is a graphic blueprint of the key elements of a proposed 
program. The Logic Model looks at inputs, activities, outputs, outcomes, and 
impacts.
If you live and work in the world of grants, it’s difficult to avoid the Logic 
Model. It seems like just about every type of funder wants you to include a 
Logic Model in the program design or action plan section of your grant appli-
cation or contract bid narrative.
Here’s my tutorial on what the columns of your Logic Model graphic should 
contain:
 
✓ Inputs: These are the human, financial, and physical resources dedi-
cated to your grant-funded program. These resources include money, 
staff and staff time, volunteers and volunteer time, facilities, equipment, 
supplies, and community partners. (See Chapter 16 for information on 
personnel and organization resources.)
 
✓ Strategies: These are what your program uses to organize the inputs. 
Using effective strategies helps the program to fulfill its mission.
 
✓ Outputs: These are the direct results of your program’s implementation 
activities. They’re actually written as indicators of productivity. Outputs 
usually start with the phrase “number of” and reflect how you will quan-
titatively track your program activities. You can pull output language 
from your objectives narrative (found earlier in your program design) 
and from your evaluation narrative as well.
 
✓ Outcomes: These are the benchmarks or measurements for your target 
population during and after program activities. For the outcomes, 
you can simply reuse your SMART objectives (see the earlier section 
“Creating SMART outcome objectives”). Some funders want to see short-
term outcomes (3 to 6 month SMART objective measurements) and 
others want to see intermediate outcomes (6 to 12 month SMART objec-
tive measurements).
 
✓ Long-Term Impact: Funders want to know what long-term outcomes 
or impact (changes in systems and processes after the funding is 
expended) you anticipate for your target population.
Figure 15-2 shows the basic structure for the Logic Model. It’s only one exam-
ple of how funders might instruct you to prepare your Logic Model form.

If you have a multiple-year program, you need to have multiple-year Logic 
Models. Each year’s model should show a set of inputs, activities, outputs, 
outcomes, and impacts on its own subset of typed pages.
 
The Logic Model isn’t a process you can pick up overnight. But reviewing 
the online materials at the W. K. Kellogg Web site (www.wkkf.org) can help 
with the learning curve. I suggest that you print out the site’s Logic Model 
Development Guide and use it as a desktop reference.
Integrating the Evaluation 
into the Program Design
The most important part of grant writing is the initial step of deciding what 
grants to pursue. But evaluating your project after it has been funded is a 
close second. The evaluation plan in the program design section of the grant 
narrative explains to the potential funder how you plan to evaluate the suc-
cess of your project.
The evaluation plan includes
 
✓ A review of your program’s objectives and how you’ll know whether 
they’ve been met
 
✓ The type of information you plan to collect to use in the evaluation
 
✓ How often the information will be collected

208
Part IV: Writing a Competitive Application Narrative 
 
✓ Who will collect the information
 
✓ Who will analyze the information and report the results
To introduce you to the evaluation process, I explain evaluation terms and 
the types of evaluations your organization can perform in the following sec-
tions. I also show you how to put together an evaluation plan for your pro-
gram design section and how to write a dissemination plan.
 
The W. K. Kellogg Foundation has published a handbook describing how to 
actually go about conducting an evaluation. You can view or download the 
handbook on the Foundation’s Web site (www.wkkf.org).
Getting a grip on evaluation terms
Before you can write an evaluation plan, you need to have a basic under-
standing of the terms that are commonly used. So, the terms in this section 
are ones that you should be familiar with and should use when writing your 
evaluation plan for the program design.
Data is the information about your project that’s gathered using measurement 
tools. You collect data in order to find out whether you’re achieving the objec-
tives that you describe in the project design section of your grant narrative.
Data analysis occurs when you examine the information that you collect with 
the measurement tools. What you’re looking for is whether the data produces 
information that’s relevant to determining the progress of your project. If it 
isn’t, you need to go back and design new measurement tools.
Think about where the problem may lie: Maybe your survey didn’t ask the 
right questions, or perhaps it was administered in a setting that wasn’t con-
ducive to getting true responses. (Did your teacher ever hand out a question-
naire at the end of the year to see how you liked his class — and then walk 
up and down the aisles while you filled it out to see what you wrote? That’s 
a setting not conducive to getting a true response.) To ensure that you get 
true responses, leave the room after you distribute measurement tools to 
participants. And don’t mess with the findings on your project. You’re hoping 
to discover the truth, which is what will help you redesign the objectives and 
develop new ways to conduct a more effective program.
Evaluation standards are acceptable ways to measure various components 
of your project. The American National Standards Institute approved the fol-
lowing four nationally used standards in 1994. The entire evaluation process 
should incorporate these standards if the findings are to be accepted as valid 
by the funders and others in your field.

209
 Chapter 15: Laying Out the Plan of Action
 
✓ Accuracy standards are how you plan to show that your evaluation will 
reveal and convey technically adequate or sufficient information about 
your project.
 
✓ Feasibility standards are how you plan to ensure that your evaluation 
procedures will be realistic, prudent, diplomatic, and frugal.
 
✓ Propriety standards are how you plan to show that your evaluation will 
be conducted legally, ethically, and with due regard for the welfare of 
those involved in the evaluation as well as those affected by its results.
 
✓ Utility standards are how you plan to evaluate the information needs of 
the project’s participants or end-users.
The evaluator or evaluation team is the individual or group of persons you 
select to determine whether your project succeeded or failed in meeting its 
goals.
 
You shouldn’t evaluate your own project. It’s okay for you to be a part of the 
evaluation team if you decide to conduct an internal evaluation (see the later 
section “Choosing to conduct an internal evaluation”). However, refrain from 
coaching or coercing other team members (your co-workers, board members, 
volunteers, community members, or project participants). Everyone on the 
evaluation team needs to be able to talk openly about his or her perceptions 
of the data findings. Focus on being impartial.
Even if your project has failed miserably (for example, your objectives said 
that 90 percent of the participants would be placed in gainful employment 
but only 10 percent were successfully placed), you and your stakeholders, 
including the funders, need to know what went wrong and how the outcome 
could be reversed. Sometimes in this failed scenario, your funding source will 
actually give you a second grant to fix the problem, which equates to another 
chance to succeed. But you’ll only get the second chance if your evaluation 
team is objective and accurate.
A formative evaluation occurs when you sit down with the project’s stake-
holders (community members, participants, and staff) and develop a list of 
questions that the funders may ask about your project when determining 
whether its monies were well placed and used. Looking at several aspects of 
the project design — goals, objectives, and activities — stakeholders gener-
ate questions about how the project can become more effective or efficient. 
The formative process continues from the time you receive grant funding 
to the completion of the grant time frame. In light of this ongoing process, 
you should set a frequency for when the data will be collected to answer the 
questions you have posed.
Every funder has its own internal evaluation process for grant-funded pro-
grams. So no templates are available to cue you on how a funder will evaluate 
your project. Of course, all types of funders look at how your organization 

210
Part IV: Writing a Competitive Application Narrative 
progressed on reaching all the outcome objectives. Foundation and corpo-
rate funders specifically look at the impact objectives and look for proof that 
an impact occurred. From their viewpoints, benefits to participants take pre-
cedence over nitpicking the monetary expenditures. Government funders, on 
the other hand, look at how well you achieved your outcome objectives, and 
they nitpick over monetary expenditures — after all, you did implement your 
program or project with public monies!
Some funders give you due dates for evaluation and financial reports. Others 
leave the reporting frequency up to the grant applicant or grantee. If this is 
the case, I recommend, at a minimum, quarterly reporting to all your funders. 
When you report quarterly, you find flaws or weaknesses in your program’s 
implementation strategies quickly and have time to correct them — well 
within the funding period.
 
Always have progress reports or raw data (information collected but not 
compiled into summary form or typed in a formal report) on hand for funder 
queries or visits.
 
If you can’t make improvements to your project, a formative evaluation may 
not be the right approach to measure the success of your project; instead, 
focus on using a summative evaluation (see the definition to this term later in 
the section).
An internal evaluation occurs when you decide not to hire an outsider to 
conduct your evaluation and instead choose to gather stakeholders to assess 
the effectiveness of your program (see the later section “Choosing to conduct 
an internal evaluation”).
Measurement tools, also known as evaluation tools, are what you use to 
collect the data or information that shows whether your project has met 
its objectives. Measurement tools can include surveys, pre- and post-
questionnaires or tests, and oral interviews.
Objectives are measurable, progressive steps taken to achieve a project’s 
goals. (I cover goals and objectives earlier in this chapter.)
Qualitative describes the approach you take when you want to understand 
the impact of your project on the target population (the end recipients of the 
grant-funded services or activities). A qualitative approach means that you 
develop questions and collect data to measure the success of a project or 
program that you implemented with grant funds. Your findings must focus on 
looking closely at your program from an operational standpoint and deter-
mining its overall impact on the target population.

211
 Chapter 15: Laying Out the Plan of Action
Quantitative describes the approach you take to measure your project’s 
effects using a design or experimental group (the target population receiving 
the grant-funded interventions or the individuals you’re testing the interven-
tion on) and a comparison or control group (a second group of participants 
not receiving intervention, but who have similar needs and share common 
demographics with your target population).
For example, say that you receive a grant award to implement a teen preg-
nancy prevention program. The teens in your program (the design or experi-
mental group) are placed in a classroom where they’re given pregnancy 
prevention strategies, from tactics to combat peer pressure to taking home an 
interactive doll in order to experience the responsibilities of teen parenting. 
To determine whether your intervention is making an impact, you also moni-
tor the attitudes and behaviors of a second group of teens (the comparison or 
control group). The second group gets no pregnancy prevention curriculum, 
receives no take-home dolls, and isn’t isolated from their peers — they’re in 
the general school setting. Your quantitative evaluation would track outcome 
objectives for both groups to show that the intervention you proposed and 
won a grant award for is working.
 
I like to combine both qualitative and quantitative approaches in order to 
examine data from a multidimensional viewpoint.
The stakeholders in your project are those individuals or entities that stand 
to lose something if your project falls short of its objectives and stand to gain 
if the project achieves its proposed objectives.
The summative evaluation (also called an outcome evaluation) occurs near 
or at the end of the period for which you were funded. This type of evalua-
tion should answer the following questions (in a narrative format):
 
✓ What did you accomplish?
 
✓ How many participants were impacted and in what ways?
 
✓ What overall difference did your project make?
 
✓ Is this project worth funding again?
A third-party evaluator is an individual or company outside your program 
that designs and conducts your project’s evaluation. (See “Selecting an 
outside evaluator” later in this chapter for more information.) Remember 
to include an expense line in your project’s budget to compensate the third-
party evaluator for its services. The standard amount to set aside for evalu-
ation is 15 percent of your total project budget. (See Chapter 17 for more 
about budgets.)

212
Part IV: Writing a Competitive Application Narrative 
Choosing to conduct an internal evaluation
When you plan to conduct an internal evaluation — meaning that you aren’t 
hiring an outsider to assist with or conduct the evaluation of your project —
the best option is to propose a stakeholder’s evaluation in the evaluation 
plan of your program design. In a stakeholder’s evaluation, you don’t need to 
select the evaluators until you know your project is funded. Once funded, you 
can identify select stakeholders from your target population, board of direc-
tors, and community partners to sit on the stakeholders’ evaluation team.
The easiest way to identify your project’s stakeholders is to ask yourself 
the following question: Who has a vested interest in our project and will be 
impacted by the project’s success? The outcome of the project definitely 
matters to your board of directors, if you have one, as well as to the staff 
assigned to work on the project. However, it matters most to the project’s 
target population, which is why you should seriously consider inviting some 
of them onto the evaluation team.
 
A clue as to when you may need to propose a stakeholder’s evaluation can 
be found in the grant application’s budget instructions. Here’s what I mean: If 
the budget instructions for the grant or cooperative agreement don’t include 
a specific line item for evaluation or contracted services, and if your program 
implementation costs will require all the available grant funding (maximum 
project award range), I suggest that you consider a stakeholder’s evaluation. 
It’s less costly and keeps the entire evaluation process local and manageable.
For example, suppose your organization proposes to implement a recycling 
program in your community. Each and every citizen who attends your public 
meeting and provides his or her input on the need for a recycling program 
is a candidate for the evaluation team. The owner of a local business who 
counts on reducing her trash pickups by recycling much of her waste may 
be a good candidate. In fact, anyone who works for the project is a potential 
candidate. Be creative and bring together people who have different perspec-
tives. I always try to include a younger person, such as a college student, on 
my evaluation teams. It doesn’t matter how many people you have on your 
stakeholder’s evaluation team as long as each side of the project is well 
represented.
 
Do you have board members who have wanted to work in a more hands-on 
way with your organization? Placing them on the evaluation team is an ideal 
way to divert their energy from (possibly) micromanaging your executive 
director or staff. They can really help shape the outcome of your grant-funded 
program — a program that could very well be the most important part of your 
organization.

213
 Chapter 15: Laying Out the Plan of Action
 
When it comes to an internal evaluation team, you’re not looking for group-
think. You want independent-minded people who can bring objective ideas to 
the table, giving you a credible evaluation process for your funded project.
Selecting an outside evaluator
If you decide to bring in an outsider to conduct your evaluation, that person 
is referred to as a third-party evaluator in the grant narrative. To find a quali-
fied evaluator, look in your community first and ask other organizations 
that provide programs similar to yours which evaluator they’ve used. Their 
evaluator may have been a university research department, a college faculty 
member, or a retired government employee with expertise in the project 
area. However, be aware that you may have to look outside your home area 
for an evaluator.
 
A clue to when you may need an outside evaluation can be found in the grant 
application’s budget instructions. If the budget instructions discuss evaluation 
costs and ask you to provide information on third-party evaluators, I recom-
mend you plan to bring in an outside evaluator. Even though outside evalu-
ators are costly (some need up to 15 percent of your total project budget to 
conduct the evaluation), the right outside evaluator can bring credibility and 
visibility to your project, which in turn attracts continued funding.
What to look for in an external evaluator
You must choose an individual or organization that has experience in 
developing evaluation plans, creating monitoring guidelines that track the 
progress of a project’s objectives, and conducting both simple and complex 
evaluations in the project’s focus area.
What to ask a prospective evaluator
During your telephone conversation or meeting with the prospective evalua-
tor, work through a list of prepared questions and write down the evaluator’s 
answers. You may have to decide from among several possible evaluators, and 
having the answers on paper will help you review and make your decision.
Start off with the following questions:
 
✓ What methodology will you use to understand the day-to-day operations 
of my project?
 
✓ How much time will the work take, and what is the cost?
 
✓ How many on-site days can you provide in order to meet with project 
personnel and talk to representatives from the target population?

214
Part IV: Writing a Competitive Application Narrative 
 
✓ Are you willing to give me a written description of your services and the 
projected cost of service if my organization can’t afford your services 
for the duration of the project?
 
✓ Are you willing to meet with my board of directors to provide progress 
reports on the evaluation?
 
✓ At what points will you give me written evaluation reports?
Brainstorm with your staff to come up with even more questions. Selecting 
an evaluator is an important part of your project, and falling short in writing 
this part of the narrative can result in being denied funding.
 
After you select an evaluator, see whether that organization or person can 
help you write the evaluation plan for the grant narrative. Of course, you will 
have to pay a fee for the evaluator’s time, but the money is well spent if you’re 
going after a multi-million-dollar, multiyear grant with heavy competition. (If 
fewer than ten grants will be awarded nationwide in a major grant competi-
tion, that’s what I call heavy.) After all, a funder wants to be assured that the 
evaluator will bring to light information that will significantly contribute to a 
national database for programs funded under its particular grant competition.
The evaluation process and resulting information must be approached from 
a scientific standpoint. So, find a qualified evaluator and get a check cut for 
the pregrant submission expertise provided. Make sure you write this same 
evaluator into your budget to bring that person or group back for the full 
evaluation process when you have a funding award. (See Chapter 17 for more 
on how to incorporate the cost for postgrant award evaluation into your proj-
ect budget.)
Writing an outstanding evaluation plan
After you decide whether to conduct an internal stakeholder or external 
third-party evaluation, the next step is to start writing or incorporating your 
evaluation plan into the program design section of the grant application 
narrative. The evaluation narrative goes at the end of the program design 
narrative. The funder’s formatting guidelines usually determine the length of 
each narrative section in the grant proposal. The program design is usually 
the largest section, so write succinctly but include sufficient details for the 
funder to see you have a comprehensive evaluation plan.
Your evaluation plan narrative must always be written to meet and exceed 
the funding agency’s guidelines. A comprehensive evaluation plan includes 
narrative on how the program will be evaluated (qualitatively, quantitatively, 
or both). It also tells the funder what type of data will be collected; who will 

215
 Chapter 15: Laying Out the Plan of Action
be collecting, analyzing, and interpreting the data; and the frequency for the 
data collection process. Don’t forget to add detail about each target popula-
tion subgroup that will be included in the evaluation process and tell how 
information or data will be collected from them (by way of survey, question-
naire, visual observation, and more).
 
Most importantly, make sure that all data to be collected is connected to 
determining the progress of your measurable outcome objectives, which are 
presented earlier in the project design section. And remember that your evalu-
ation plan must be specific to your program goals and objectives.
 
Examples of evaluation plans abound on the Internet. For starters, visit the 
Web site for the W. K. Kellogg Foundation: www.wkkf.org.
The evaluation plan also needs to include information about how the grant 
applicant will share its evaluation findings with other organizations inter-
ested in replicating a successful model program. This sharing process is 
called dissemination. The dissemination plan, which is usually a paragraph or 
two, is written at the end of the evaluation plan.
Worried about giving away too many secrets? Well, don’t be. When you 
receive a grant award, the funders expect you to share your findings with 
other organizations and associations. With government grants, everything 
you do — information and program activities — is subject to public access. 
Foundation and corporate funders want to maximize their investments — this 
means you’re obligated to disseminate your evaluation findings. Practically all 
funders ask for your dissemination plans in their grant application guidelines.
When you write your dissemination narrative, include information on what 
will be shared and how it will be shared. List conferences, forums, Web-site 
postings, and printed documents mailed out (and to whom they’ll be mailed).
 
When you’re writing your grant applications or contract bid documents, you 
should always, always follow the guidelines provided for preparing your nar-
rative sections. In foundation funding requests, the dissemination plan can 
be short and to the point, like my preceding example. However, in govern-
ment funding requests, you may be instructed to write multiple pages on the 
dissemination process. Carefully reading and following the funding agency’s 
guidelines can be the difference between a funded project and a rejected one.

Chapter 16
Presenting Your Staff 
and Resources
In This Chapter
▶ Writing about your project staff
▶ Demonstrating that you have plenty of resources
▶ Being fair when choosing project personnel and participants
A
fter you’ve written a compelling needs statement (see Chapter 14) 
and designed the road map for the goals and SMART objectives you’ll 
achieve when the grant or contract funding is awarded (see Chapter 15), it’s 
time to demonstrate that you have the right people for the project.
In this chapter, I show you how to write about existing and incoming staff in a 
way that convinces funders that you have the savvy to manage their monies 
once they’re awarded. I also show you how to put together winning project 
management profiles, organizational resources, and a fair approach to select-
ing project personnel.
 
The personnel, resources, and equity section of the grant application narra-
tive (also called the key personnel, adequacy of resources, and equal employ-
ment opportunity statement, respectively) can range from one page to several 
pages. Developing narrative language that meets the requirements laid out 
in the funding source’s grant application guidelines is important. Otherwise, 
your application may be rejected and not considered for the grant funding.
Introducing Your Project Personnel
Just for fun, pretend for a moment that I’m your grant reader. I’ve already 
read the key opening sections to your application narrative, and now I’m 
almost convinced that your organization is worthy of my funding agency’s 
investment monies. At this point, I just need to be taken to the finish line. In 
other words, before I can make a confident decision, I need to know who’s in 

218
Part IV: Writing a Competitive Application Narrative 
charge of your organization and the proposed project. From a funder’s per-
spective, I want written validation that the grant monies will be managed by 
competent administrators.
 
Grant-, cooperative-agreement-, or contract-funded personnel is gathered in 
one of two ways: by reassigning an existing staff person to the grant-funded 
project or by hiring someone after the project is funded. When you’re writ-
ing about to-be-hired personnel, you won’t know the specific qualifications of 
each individual, but you should know and be able to write about the minimum 
job specifications of those who will carry certain responsibilities.
No matter how you gather project personnel, making good choices can help 
you win a big grant award. And when you have qualified personnel on your 
project, your personnel narrative is a lot easier to write.
 
As a regular grant peer reviewer, I can tell you that even if the rest of your 
grant narrative is perfect, you can easily lose up to ten points if your project 
personnel aren’t up to snuff. As you probably know, ten points is a fatal loss. 
(See Chapters 9 and 10 for more about the point system and review criteria.) 
On a point scale of 100, projects scoring in the high 90s are recommended for 
grant awards. Ninety-point projects just won’t cut it.
Dealing with existing staff and new hires
Before you start writing about staffing, resources, and equity in hiring, sit 
down with existing staff members or your human resources director and 
go over the project narrative that you’ve already written. Look at your 
Implementation Plan to see what personnel you’ve committed to carry out 
the proposed activities. (Refer to Chapter 15 for more on the Implementation 
Plan.) Highlight the job titles and any other information that gives you a 
clue as to how many staff members you need to implement the grant funded 
project. After you’ve chosen your staff, you can begin writing your personnel 
narrative.
Choosing your staff
When compiling information for the project’s personnel profile section, be 
sure to do the following:
 
✓ Identify a project administrator. The project administrator is the individ-
ual who provides management oversight. This person should be able to 
allocate up to five hours per week of his or her work time to making sure 
the project meets its grant-funded conditions. The project administrator 
(along with the project director) usually attends meetings with the proj-
ect’s community partners. (Chapter 13 covers establishing partnerships 
with other organizations in your community.)

219
 Chapter 16: Presenting Your Staff and Resources
 
✓ Identify the personnel needed to carry out the project on a day-to-day
 basis. This usually means selecting a project director. The person is 
responsible for the program’s implementation. This individual reports 
directly to the project administrator. Identify a project director who has 
relevant and extensive experience in the same area as the project.
 
✓ Identify all remaining personnel who will be paid from the project’s 
grant-funded budget. Work with your financial or business manager 
to review the project design and determine 100 percent of the staffing 
that’s needed to implement the project, if funded. (Flip to Chapter 15 
for details on project design and implementation.) List all other person-
nel who will be hired for or assigned to the project in the adequacy of 
resources section of the funding request.
There are no set personnel positions. Each project differs when it comes to 
the personnel needed to carry out activities.
 
When you’re in the process of choosing personnel, it isn’t the time to do a 
favor for your out-of-work, unqualified buddy! Not only does he have the 
potential to drag your project down, but he also drags down your funding 
request because decision-making readers shudder when they see unqualified 
personnel on a project that they’re considering funding.
Writing your personnel narrative
The grant cooperative agreement or contract bid reader (the person 
employed by the funding source to review, rate, and make recommendations 
for funding or not funding your request) looks for the key personnel narrative 
to answer the following questions:
 
✓ What are the project administrator’s qualifications?
 
✓ What are the project director’s qualifications?
 
✓ Which project personnel will carry out the day-to-day activities?
 
✓ Do the personnel members have extensive experience in the project’s 
focus area?
 
✓ What percentage of the personnel’s time will be charged to the project?
 
✓ Is the time allocated for each person sufficient to carry out the activities 
described in the plan of operation or program design?
 
✓ Will the personnel’s time be paid for with grant monies or through 
in-kind contributions?
 
✓ What is the personnel line of accountability (in other words, who do they 
report to)?

220
Part IV: Writing a Competitive Application Narrative 
 
Keep in mind that you absolutely must follow the funding agency’s guidelines 
when it comes to writing about your project personnel. Your actual key per-
sonnel narrative could look entirely different than my example.
The basic profile
For a basic personnel profile, write about what makes each person qualified 
for his or her proposed position. Give information on relevant work back-
ground, awards, acknowledgments, and special recognitions. Follow this 
with educational information. End with a final sentence to blow the readers 
away — impress them with one more fact that qualifies the individual for the 
proposed position. If individuals filling some or all of the budgeted positions 
have yet to be hired, write a short description of their desired qualifications.
 
Unless the funding agency has page limitations for this section of the funding 
request, write one paragraph for each budgeted personnel position. (Refer to 
the later section “The profile with page limitations” to determine what to do 
when you have to watch how much you write.) This recommendation remains 
the same whether personnel costs will be charged to the grant, cooperative 
agreement, or contract or whether they’ll be covered by your own organiza-
tion’s in-kind or cash match. (See Chapter 17 for budget definitions and expla-
nations.)
In the following example, I present the narrative language on the proposed 
director. Notice that I use boldface to highlight the individual’s name, posi-
tion, and expertise. Also, note that I use future tense. I want to plant the idea 
that this funding “will” be awarded and the proposed staffing-related tasks 
“will” occur.
Key Personnel
Project Director (1.0 FTE grant funded) Dr. LaTasha Cosby will be 
the Director for the Awesome Academics Project. She has worked 
for the Orange County School District since 2000. During her tenure, 
Dr. Cosby has created six afterschool academic programs for middle schools 
in the District. She has 34 years of experience as a public educator, District 
administrator, and private sector consultant. Most recently, Dr. Cosby was 
recognized by the Governor’s office for her outstanding contributions to 
public education. She holds degrees from Florida International University, 
University of Miami, and Texas State University. Dr. Cosby will report 
directly to the District’s External Programs and Partnerships Director. She 
has the vision and professional savvy to take this proposed project from 
ordinary to extraordinary!
Sometimes the expertise is in the team as a whole. In this example, Dr. Cosby 
has all the necessary qualities to fulfill her position. What’s more common, how-
ever, is that one person is qualified for his or her position, but the surrounding

221
 Chapter 16: Presenting Your Staff and Resources
 team complements that person’s knowledge, skills, and talents. In those 
instances, you may have to be a little “creatively” honest when profiling your 
key personnel. (If you aren’t familiar with FTE, take a look at the next section 
where I explain it.)
The profile with page limitations
If your funding request has page limitations and you can’t write at least one 
full paragraph on all project staff members, you can include a brief list of key 
personnel, including volunteers, in the grant application narrative. Also, if 
the funder’s guidelines allow attachments, feel free to attach to the narrative 
more detailed information on your key personnel.
The following is an example of how to develop a list of key personnel. Note 
that I include the job title and the time assigned to the project for each 
person in terms of Full Time Equivalent (FTE), which equals 40 hours per 
week (8 hours daily times 5 days a week). So, if an individual is only assigned 
to the project at 0.5 FTE, this means they’ll be working 20 hours per week; 
0.25 FTE is 10 hours per week.
In-School Liaison (0.5 FTE in-kind contribution from the Orange County 
School District): The District has agreed to designate a middle school 
teacher at one of the six targeted middle schools to act as the In-School 
Liaison. This individual will coordinate the recruitment and enrollment of 
eligible middle school students into the Awesome Academics Project. This 
position will rotate between the six middle schools to meet with counsel-
ors and teachers and explain the purpose of the Project. Once enrollment 
targets have been met, the In-School Liaison will work to synchronize the 
in-school homework assignments with the afterschool academic support 
Individual Education Plans (IEPs). This position will report to the Orange 
County School District’s External Programs and Partnerships Director and 
the Awesome Academics Project Director.
Afterschool Tutors (30 tutors at 0.6 FTE grant funded): Five tutors will be 
assigned to each of the six middle schools in the District. They will work from 
3 p.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Thursday. These individuals, yet to be iden-
tified, will help students with each day’s homework assignments and mentor 
them from an older youth perspective on how to succeed at academics. The 
tutors selected will be honor students from Joe Jackson High School — the 
feeder school for the six middle schools targeted in this proposal.
Volunteer Parent Advisory Council (12 persons at 0.1 FTE in-kind each): 
The Awesome Academics Project will create a volunteer council to oversee 
the afterschool project from a stakeholder’s viewpoint. The council will be 
composed of 12 volunteer parents who will meet monthly at rotating middle 
school sites. The Council will report to the Project Director. All Project staff 
will attend the monthly meetings.

Part IV: Writing a Competitive Application Narrative 
The profile for personnel that won’t be paid by grant funds
When you can provide personnel at no cost to the grant, you look great 
in the eyes of the grant reader. And when you look great, you score more 
points. For example, you may include the project director’s salary in the 
grant proposal budget, but the project administrator’s time will be in-kind 
or not charged to the grant proposal budget. This shows the funder that 
you’re focusing on the best use of grant funds and you want to put the money 
toward providing services to the target population.
 
The grant, cooperative-agreement, or contract-bid reader is looking for 
answers to some hard and fast questions that are critical to the success of 
your project. Even if you aren’t asking for grant funds to cover personnel, you 
should still include a brief paragraph on the key personnel and include the 
résumé of the project director in the application’s attachments.
When you have a volunteer board or council, write a paragraph about their 
individual FTEs and how often they will meet. This shows funders that you 
have non-monetary resources that are also stakeholders. In other words, 
they have a vested interested in seeing your project succeed!
Including the principal investigator
In federal grant applications for scientific or research requests, you’re asked 
to provide a biographical sketch for the principal investigator. The prin-
cipal investigator is similar to the project director (see the earlier section 
“Choosing your staff”). However, the principal investigator usually holds a 
doctorate degree in the project’s specialty field.
 
The form for a biographical sketch can change from agency to agency. Here 
are the most common information fields found on the form:
 
✓ Name: Type in the first, middle, and last name of your principal 
investigator.
 
✓ Position Title: Type in the project-assigned position title.
 
✓ Education/Training: List the colleges attended and locations, begin-
ning with the baccalaureate degree. Fill in the degree column, the year 
earned or awarded, and the field of study for each institution of higher 
education attended.
 
✓ Positions and Honors: List, in chronological order, previous work or job 
positions, ending with the present position. List any honors, including pres-
ent membership on any federal government public advisory committees.

223
 Chapter 16: Presenting Your Staff and Resources
 
✓ Selected peer-reviewed publications (in chronological order): List any 
publications in which work has been published and read or reviewed by 
professional peers.
 
✓ Research Support: List all ongoing or completed (past three years) 
research projects (both federal and non-federal supported).
 
You should find a place at the bottom of the biographical sketch form for a 
page number. Government grant and cooperative agreement applications and 
contract bid documents are often formatted for you to insert a page number. 
When you see the cue at the bottom of a form page, read and reread the fund-
ing guidelines to see whether your narrative and all accompanying forms must 
be paginated (numbered) in sequential order, from beginning to end.
Composing the management plan
The management plan tells the grant reviewer (that’s the funding decision 
maker, in case you forgot!) who’s accountable to whom. It clearly shows 
where the buck stops when questions arise from the funder. You can inte-
grate the management plan into the key personnel descriptions (as I did 
in the personnel list earlier in this chapter), or you can develop a separate 
graphic, like the one in Figure 16-1.
I like to show the management plan in black and white — no color graphics 
except a lightly shaded title row. The funder wants to see the position name, 
FTE allocation, line of accountability (who reports to whom), and how the 
position will be funded (grant budget, cash match from funding applicant, or 
in-kind contribution). I prefer to list the project personnel in order of ranking, 
beginning with the highest administrative position and ending with volun-
teers, if any.

Part IV: Writing a Competitive Application Narrative 
In the figure, the number in parentheses behind each position title indicates 
the number of individuals hired for each title position. For example, the 
Council will have 12 volunteer (parent) members.
 
When the funder’s management plan guidelines call for something that’s not 
applicable or necessary to your project, write a response to indicate why that 
particular something will not be attached or discussed further in your applica-
tion. For example, because they’re volunteers, the Parent Advisory Council 
Members don’t cost the funder or the applicant agency any monies. Rather 
than leave them off the management plan, I include them. Why? Because in 
the world of grantmaking, volunteers are as valuable as paid staff; they’re 
stakeholders who provide wisdom and feedback to benefit the grant-funded 
project’s overall outcomes. Funders look for volunteer involvement first at the 
pre-grant-proposal planning stage and again in the grant proposal’s manage-
ment plan. In the example from Table 16-1, the volunteers’ time is an in-kind 
contribution.
 
The management plan should also include a statement of fiscal agency respon-
sibility. This concise, one-paragraph written statement by the chief financial 
officer (CFO) of the applicant organization attests to the fact that the agency 
will accept the responsibility of accepting the grant award, managing the 
grant award, and preparing and submitting financial and evaluation reports. 
Basically, it’s just one more affirmation to the funder of the grant applicant’s 
internal accountability. The statement of fiscal agency responsibility is pre-
sented depending on the type of request it is:
 
✓ For foundation and corporate funding requests: Written on the grant 
applicant agency’s letterhead, signed by the CFO, and attached to the 
application
 
✓ For government grant and cooperative agreement requests and in con-
tract bid documents: Included at the end of the management plan
Make sure to include the following accountability information in your state-
ment of fiscal agency responsibility:
 
✓ Legal name and corporate structures
 
✓ The year in which your organization was founded and whether it has 
any special recognitions
 
✓ Whether your organization will be the fiscal agent (If not, provide infor-
mation on the fiscal agent and tell the funder why you’re using another 
organization to act as your fiscal agent.)
 
✓ Who will monitor your fiscal activities
 
✓ A generic statement about your finances being managed prudently and 
cost-effectively (This statement sounds good, and it works to convince 
funders that you have a solid financial grip on handling all incoming 
revenues.)

225
 Chapter 16: Presenting Your Staff and Resources
 
✓ Who conducts your financial audits and the frequency of those audits
 
✓ The amounts and sources of funds you’ve received from grants, coop-
erative agreements, loans, and contract awards
The following example shows you what a good statement of fiscal agency 
responsibility sounds like:
The Awesome Academics Project is a nonprofit organization created by the 
Orange County Educational Foundation. The Foundation is the philanthropic 
and grant seeking arm of the Orange County School District. The Foundation 
has its own separate IRS nonprofit approval and operates with a separate 
Board of Directors. The Foundation’s finances are managed prudently and 
cost-effectively. All financials are audited annually by the District’s CPAs and 
Financial Directors. Created in 1990, the Foundation has raised over $10 
million in contributions to benefit in-school and out-of-school programs at 
the Orange County School District.
 
Keep in mind that if you’re writing to foundations and corporations, the 
funders don’t usually ask for a separate narrative section on the management 
plan. You include it instead in the section for key personnel. However, state 
and federal funders usually ask for a qualification of key personnel section and 
a management plan. In this situation, these sections are to be written sepa-
rately and labeled clearly.
 
Always include a project organizational chart in the management plan — room 
permitting. A chart amplifies your key personnel narrative section and gives 
the grant peer reviewer a visual break from reading line after line of typed 
text. If the grant application’s guidelines limit the number of pages that you 
can write in the narrative, the organizational chart may have to be your entire 
management plan section, with no other narrative. If this is the case, make 
sure to include FTEs (Full Time Equivalents, which are explained earlier in this 
chapter) for any salaried project personnel.
Identifying Resources Available 
to the Project
In government grants, cooperative agreements, and contract bids, you have 
to address something that’s usually called adequacy of resources. (You may 
be asked to address this issue in only the budget section — see Chapter 
17 for budget-related details.) With the adequacy of resources section, the 
funder looks at your organization’s available resources — resources needed 
to implement a successfully funded project — and decides whether the 
resources are sufficient to support the project.

226
Part IV: Writing a Competitive Application Narrative 
A graphic table is a great way to profile your resources for the funder. Figure 
16-2 gives you an example of how to graph your adequacy of resources infor-
mation. When you use a table instead of narrative, you can show everything 
in one graphic. I like to use a three-column table with the following headers:
 
✓ Resource: Record all the resources (monetary and in-kind) that will 
be available to help you implement a successfully funded project. I list 
the partner agencies and what they will be contributing to the funded 
project.
 
✓ Cash Committed: Type in the actual cash committed to the funded 
project.
 
✓ In-Kind Value: Type in the value of the in-kind donations from each partner. 
(You can find detailed explanations for in-kind donations in Chapter 17.)

If you choose to write a resources narrative instead of create a table, keep 
your narrative to one detailed paragraph.
 
When you use volunteers as resources, be sure to use the most current offi-
cial research on the value of a volunteer. This hourly value amount changes 
every two years. There is a national value and a state-by-state value. The 
Independent Sector’s Web site (www.independentsector.org) has an 
updated table for the national hourly value and for each state’s hourly value.

 Chapter 16: Presenting Your Staff and Resources
Showing Equity in Your Personnel 
and Participant Selection
Equity is created when you manage a program in such a way that no one is 
excluded. All the individuals hired with grant funds and all the members of 
the target population (those people the grant funds will help) must be given 
equal access to program opportunities — to be participants (target popula-
tion) and to be hired without discrimination (your project staff).
You show equity by opening your project to all who apply, providing they 
meet objective eligibility criteria. For example, exclusively serving a target 
population of senior citizens who all belong to your church in a daily hot 
lunch program isn’t discrimination. However, if a senior citizen who is not a 
member of your church walks into your facility and you refuse services, you 
are discriminating and not showing equity. Funders want assurances that you 
won’t violate federal or state antidiscrimination laws.
 
Federal and state funders mandate a grant application section on equity. 
Foundations and corporations usually don’t have anything on equity in their 
guidelines, but it doesn’t hurt to include a paragraph on the subject to show 
your awareness of the issue.
When evaluating the statement of equity, the grant reader asks the following 
key questions:
 
✓ Does the grant applicant propose to assign or hire project personnel 
who reflect the demographics of the community and target population 
to be served under the grant funding?
 
✓ Does the grant applicant embrace a sense of fairness to all human 
beings?
 
Here are a few quick and easy tips for writing the equity section without 
stress:
 
✓ Ask human resources for help. Some grant application guidelines 
require that your equity statement actually cite the federal and state 
legislation that your organization adheres to in its hiring practices. The 
acts that you need to cite can be obtained from your human resources 
department.
 
✓ Address equitable access for everyone. The equity statement should 
include personnel (including the selection of volunteers for the project) 
and project participants.

228
Part IV: Writing a Competitive Application Narrative 
 
✓ Be straightforward and make a statement. Writing that discrimination 
will not be tolerated is important. Cite the federal and state antidiscrimi-
nation laws to which your organization will adhere.
The following example received high peer review points (see Chapters 9 
and 10 for more on the peer review). Notice how the example addresses the 
makeup of program personnel and how the personnel will be recruited as 
well as makes a statement regarding discrimination and fair employment 
practices.
The Awesome Academics Project will use both existing District staff and 
newly hired individuals for the grant funded program. Recruitment for staff 
will target all local and regional media. In order to identify qualified staff 
whose demographics reflect the target population, the staff search will be 
extended to nonprofit and for-profit entities located in the middle school 
neighborhoods. Every effort will be made to appoint and/or hire staff 
that reflects the multicultural mix and demographics of the targeted 
neighborhoods.
It is the policy of the Orange County School District not to engage in discrimi-
nation or harassment against any person because of race, color, religion, 
sex, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status, disability, sexual orienta-
tion, unfavorable discharge from the military, or status as a disabled veteran 
or a veteran of the Vietnam era and to comply with all federal and state 
nondiscrimination, equal opportunity, and affirmative action laws, orders, 
and regulations.

I
f you’re like me, when you finally finish the narrative components of your 
grant application, you’d like to think you’re finished. Unfortunately you 
aren’t! Instead, at this point in the grant writing process, it’s time to connect 
the cost for grant-funded project implementation to the real-time expenses 
that you want your grant award to cover (whether it be in part or in total).
 
Your budget is linked directly to your project’s objectives. And in order to 
achieve the objectives, a series of implementation activities or process objec-
tives must occur (see Chapter 15). The line items in your budget are the costs 
of what it will take to carry out the activities that lead to your objectives.
This chapter walks you through the budget preparation process for grant 
applications and contract bids. It also tells you what the funder’s and 
bid-letting agency’s expectations are when it comes to your budget section.
Examining the Basic Budget 
Terms and Sections
Most of the terms associated with the budget section of grant applications, 
cooperative agreements, and contract bids are everyday terms — no big 
deal. But just knowing the terms isn’t enough; thoroughly understanding the 

230
Part IV: Writing a Competitive Application Narrative 
section that’s behind each one changes you from the “I’m not so sure” grant 
writer to the “I know how to do this” grant writer or consultant who’s ready 
to tackle the down side of the grant writing mountain. As you start the final 
climb down, don’t forget your enthusiasm and don’t forget to breathe!
Allocation and budget summary
Allocation is the dollar amount you assign to each line item, and budget 
summary is the skeletal outline of how the project’s total cost is allocated to 
line items. When a funder asks for a budget summary, it only wants to see a 
graphic table (created by you) or a completed short form (provided by the 
funder) with your main budget line item categories and the total amounts for 
each category. Funders usually don’t want to see narrative detail within a 
budget summary.
For example, if you’re requesting funding only for a staff position, the two 
columns in the graphic table would be Line Item (left-hand column) and Cost 
(right-hand column). The first line item is Personnel, and the second line item 
is Fringe Benefits. These two line items are flush left in the left-hand column. 
The total project budget, also flush left in the last row of the left-hand 
column, is the sum of Personnel and Fringe Benefits.
Budget detail narrative
Funders require a detailed explanation of how you plan to spend their monies 
if they choose to fund your project. So they typically request your budget 
detail narrative. The budget detail narrative section isn’t the place to spring 
surprises on the funder. Anything that shows up here should have already 
been discussed in the project plan of action section of the application 
(see Chapter 15 for the lowdown on the plan of action). Read the funder’s 
guidelines and explanations for what should be included in each line item 
explanation.
 
You’ll see FTE (Full Time Equivalent) used throughout the funder’s budget 
instructions and on budget forms. FTE is based on a full-time work schedule of 
35 to 40 hours per week. Each organization or company has its own meaning 
for who’s considered a full-time employee. For the following budget detail 
narrative example, I use 40 hours per week for a full-time employee. A 1.0 FTE 
is 40 hours per week; a 0.75 FTE is 30 hours per week; a 0.5 FTE is 20 hours per 
week, and a 0.25 FTE is 10 hours per week.
The organization I write about in the following budget detail narrative exam-
ple (and that I use throughout this section) is a nonprofit performing arts 
organization that has been in existence for more than ten years. The organi-
zation needs additional funding to provide a Mobile Arts Outreach Project 

231
 Chapter 17: Connecting the Budget to the Plan of Action
to day care centers and assisted living facilities. In my example, I include 
full-time and part-time personnel, and I use a standard and widely accepted 
percent for calculating fringe benefits.
 
Because fringe benefits vary from organization to organization and from state 
to state, you need to check with your human resources department to find out 
your organization’s fringe benefit calculation. This is always a double-digit 
percent that’s multiplied by the total salaries for the grant-funded and in-kind 
personnel.
Personnel Budget Detail Narrative
In-Kind: One 0.25 FTE Executive Director will be assigned to the grant 
management duties and project oversight tasks. The Executive Director’s 
full-time salary is $80,000 annually. 0.25 FTE equals $20,000.
Requested: One 1.0 FTE Mobile Arts Outreach Coordinator will be hired at 
$45,000 per year. The individual selected will be responsible for the man-
agement, execution, and coordination of all outreach administration and 
implementation tasks.
Total Personnel Costs: $65,000
Requested: $45,000
In-Kind: $20,000
Fringe Benefits Budget Detail Narrative
Fringe Benefits are calculated at 28 percent of total salaries; fringe benefits 
include medical, dental, vision, short-term disability, worker’s compensation 
insurance, unemployment insurance, and employer’s FICA match for each 
salaried position.
Total Fringe Benefits: $18,200 (28% × $65,000)
Requested: $12,600
In-Kind: $5,600
 
As far as the order of your budget documents goes, the budget detail narrative 
section usually follows the budget summary. Before you start working on the 
budget detail narrative, however, it’s important to research the funding 
source’s preference for developing this section of your grant application. 
Some funders only want the budget summary, but others require the summary 
and detail narrative.
Personnel
The personnel portion of the budget summary and budget detail narrative is 
where you indicate the costs of project staff and fringe benefits that will be 
paid from the grant funds and the project staff that will be paid by the grant 

232
Part IV: Writing a Competitive Application Narrative 
applicant (but not out of the grant funds). This section also includes the 
value of volunteer hours. If your organization plans to assign existing staff 
to the grant-funded project but not draw the staff salaries from the grant 
monies, you need to create an in-kind column to show the funder how you 
plan to support the costs of the project’s personnel.
Funding for your project’s personnel either will be requested from the fund-
ing agency or will come as an in-kind contribution from your organization 
(the grant applicant).
In-kind resources refer to administrative services, access to materials and 
supplies, use of equipment and facilities, printing support services, and other 
resources that will be made available to the grant-funded project and its 
personnel at no cost to the funding agency. (I discuss in-kind items in more 
detail later in this chapter.)
Requested contributions refer to the funds you need to obtain from outside 
your organization — from the funding agency.
 
I want to emphasize that in-kind contributions of the grant applicant should 
not be commingled with or included in the “Requested” line item of the budget 
summary and in the budget detail narrative. Your in-kind items should appear 
in a separate column. See Figure 17-1 for an example.

Travel
If you plan to reimburse project personnel for local travel, traditionally 
referred to as mileage reimbursement, include this expense in the travel line 
item of the budget summary and in the budget detail narrative. Also, if you 
plan to send project personnel to out-of-town training or conferences during 
the course of the project, you need to ask for out-of-town travel expenses.

233
 Chapter 17: Connecting the Budget to the Plan of Action
Your travel explanation in the budget detail narrative needs to include the 
number of trips planned and the number of persons for each trip as well as 
the conference name, location, purpose, and cost. Don’t forget to include the 
cost of transportation to the events, lodging, meals, and ground travel.
When reviewing the budget-related portions of the grant and cooperative 
agreement guidelines and contract bidding guidelines, you’re likely to come 
across the term per diem. Per diem in this context means the daily allowance 
that your organization gives employees to spend on meals and incidentals 
during their travel. Federal grant applications may have per diem limits, such 
as $54 per day.
 
Keep in mind that setting a per diem amount could backfire when you or 
another employee travels to an area with a higher cost of living than the norm, 
such as Alaska, the East Coast, or the West Coast. Before you finalize your 
budget line items, contact the funding agency to see if you can use higher per 
diem amounts for higher cost locales.
 
If you want to set a per diem for your project but aren’t sure what a reason-
able number may be, you can check the federal per diem rates for your state 
at the General Services Administration Web site: www.gsa.gov.
When you’re planning to request money for travel expenses, don’t forget that 
you have to have both a travel budget detail narrative and a budget sum-
mary. I explain both in the following sections.
Travel budget detail narrative
The following is an example of a portion of the travel budget detail narrative 
from the Mobile Arts Outreach Project’s grant application. (I introduce this 
project earlier in the chapter.) Notice that the purpose of the travel is clearly 
explained for the funder. The funds requested are clearly not for “luxurious” 
travel amenities.
Travel: Grant funding will enable our performing arts organization to pay 
the daily travel-related expenses necessary to take the donated recreational 
vehicle on the road to community destinations (day care centers and 
assisted living facilities in Rain County). Travel-related expenses for the 
Mobile Arts Outreach Project are calculated at $600 per month × 12 months 
for a total of $7,200 annually.
Regional Arts Conference: The Mobile Arts Outreach Project Coordinator 
will attend one regional arts conference sponsored by the Wyoming Arts 
Council. This year’s conference, scheduled for August 28-30, is in Jackson 
Hole. Mileage reimbursement at $.485 per mile (federally approved rates for 
Wyoming) × 400 miles (round trip) is $194. Hotel expenses are $200 per 
night for two nights totaling $400. Total cost for Regional Arts Conference: 
$756.

Total Travel Expenses: $7,956
Requested: $7,956
In-Kind: $0
Travel budget summary
When you’re writing a grant application that requires matching funds (see 
the later section “Digging Up Matching Funds”), always show four separate 
columns in your budget summary table and explain the source of matching 
funds in your budget detail narrative. Follow these guidelines for the 
summary table:
 
✓ The first column is for the specific item information.
 
✓ The second column is for the amount of grant or contract funds 
requested.
 
✓ The third column is for the amount of funds you have to match the 
requested funds (also referred to as in-kind contributions). Only use the 
third column when you have matching funds.
 
✓ The fourth column is for the total of the two monies: grant + in-kind or 
other matching funds.
Figure 17-2 shows you an example of how to graphically present this type of 
budget information.
 
Be conservative, yet accurate, in calculating travel expenses. No funder wants 
to see its money pay for junkets or extended vacations. Looking for confer-
ences in exotic places raises a red flag that could get your proposal tossed out 
during the review stages. (See “Crunching the Numbers Ethically” later in this 
chapter for more info about the right dollar amounts to include.)

 Chapter 17: Connecting the Budget to the Plan of Action
Equipment
The equipment line item of the budget summary and budget detail narrative 
is where you ask for grant monies to purchase a major piece of equipment, 
such as a computer or copy machine. Usually this equipment costs $250 or 
more and has a useful life (the length of time the equipment is expected to be 
in service) of two years or longer.
Government funds may be used to purchase equipment when current 
equipment either doesn’t exist or is unable to perform the necessary tasks 
required by the grant. Equipment purchased with government grant funds 
must be used 100 percent of the time for the grant-funded project.
 
Do your homework before requesting grant monies to cover capital (big-
ticket) equipment. Sometimes, you’re better off asking a local office supply 
company to donate a big-ticket piece of equipment rather than bogging down 
the grant budget by adding it to your line items. Also, think about leasing 
capital equipment. Funders who don’t allow you to use grant funds to pur-
chase equipment may allow you to lease it instead. At the end of the lease, you 
have the option to purchase the equipment. Of course, you also need the 
funds to do so. Luckily, a lot of vendors have end-of-lease buyouts for $1.
Equipment budget detail narrative
Here’s an example of the equipment budget detail narrative for the Mobile 
Arts Outreach Project:
Equipment ($2,000): The Mobile Arts Outreach Project will purchase 
mobile backdrops, lighting, and other audio/video equipment to conduct 
first-class performances at community venues.

Supplies budget detail narrative
The following is an example of the supplies budget detail narrative for the 
Mobile Arts Outreach Project:
Supplies ($3,000): Grant funds will purchase small types of musical instru-
ments, costume masks, and other types of noise makers for use by audience 
members at each venue (day care centers and assisted living facilities). 
These props will enable audiences of all ages to participate in the perform-
ing arts program, which is intended to be interactive — drawing out the very 
young and the very old. Instruments purchased will include: chimes, kazoos, 
marimbas, wooden spoons, and other starter instruments.

Contractual
The contractual line of the budget summary and budget detail narrative is 
where you list the money needed to hire anyone for the project who isn’t a 
member of the staff (whose expenses are listed under the personnel section 
of the budget — covered earlier in this chapter). For example, you may plan 
to hire an accounting firm to handle the fiscal reporting side of the grant’s 
management, an evaluation specialist to work on that portion of the applica-
tion, or a trainer to work with your staff, clients, or board members.
 
In some smaller nonprofit organizations, personnel hired with grant funds are 
considered contracted services because the term of employment is dependent 
on continued grant funding. The pro side of categorizing personnel as contrac-
tual is that it eliminates having departing project personnel file for unemploy-
ment compensation. The con side is that some really qualified and available 
individuals may want more of a commitment and may not remain with your 
project for the duration of the grant period. Also, the constant changing of 
personnel can be a problem when it comes to the evaluation process. 
(Chapter 15 covers evaluation responsibilities.)
Contractual budget detail narrative
The following is an example of the contractual budget detail narrative for the 
Mobile Arts Outreach Project:
Contractual ($15,000): This line item includes two independent contrac-
tors who are critical to our organization’s mission and fulfillment of the 
terms of this proposed grant-funded project. First, at a cost of $10,000, we 
will contract with a social marketing consultant to help launch the new 
Mobile Arts Outreach Project. This contractor will perform the following 
scope of services: project management and relations skills; fostering rela-
tions with potential performance venues; preparing all print and broadcast 
media press releases and public service announcements, and helping to 
development long-lasting goodwill throughout Rain County for the Mobile 
Arts Outreach Project. Lastly, at a cost of $5,000, we will contract with a 
Certified Public Accountant to manage all financial reporting for the grant 
award and to prepare an annual audit statement for this project and for the 
organization as a whole.

Construction
 
When you write a grant that’s exclusively seeking funds for construction 
(also known as building funds), you don’t need to bother with a budget 
summary and a budget detail narrative. Just insert the bid. The bid is the 
written document submitted to you by the construction company that lists 
all the costs involved in the project. Shortcuts are nice!
Other
You may need to include this section in your budget summary and in the 
budget detail narrative if you have items that don’t fit into any of the other 
categories. List items by major type and show, in the budget detail narrative, 
how you arrived at the total sum requested. The following is a list of the 
types of items I list in the other category:
 
✓ Janitorial services
 
✓ Rent
 
✓ Utilities
 
✓ Reproduction (printing)
 
✓ Security services
 
✓ Stipends or honorariums for speakers or special project participants

 Chapter 17: Connecting the Budget to the Plan of Action
For the Mobile Arts Outreach Project examples in the following sections, 
I also add the value of volunteers (from visitor guides to housekeeping 
and clerical support) and the donated recreational vehicle as line items in 
the budget.
All types of funders familiar with the nonprofit sector recognize the “Value 
of Volunteer Time” reports issued frequently by the Independent Sector 
(www.independentsector.org), which works to promote a just and 
inclusive society of active citizens and healthy communities. Reports show 
the national estimated dollar value of volunteer time, a figure that shows 
the amount of money that organizations save by using volunteers. The 
Independent Sector Web site also lists dollar values of volunteer hours 
by state.
For federal and out-of-state foundation and corporate requests, use the 
national hourly rate to calculate the total value of volunteer hours. The 
national hourly rate is the number of volunteers on your project multiplied 
by their average hours each, annually. For state funding agencies as well as 
foundations and corporations in your state, use the hourly amount listed for 
your state to calculate the value of your project’s volunteers.
Other budget detail narrative
Here’s an example of the other budget detail narrative for the Mobile Arts 
Outreach Project:
Seeing the value of volunteers
For decades, volunteers have rolled up their 
sleeves and stepped in to serve their communi-
ties. Volunteers are most often used where 
staffing shortages or gaps occur due to funding 
shortfalls. Nonprofits and for-profits that use 
volunteers in their organizations treat those vol-
unteers as personnel; they have scheduled 
hours, they sign in and out of shifts, and they 
have job descriptions on file in personnel or 
human resources departments. Volunteers 
don’t receive paychecks or contracted services 
fees for their volunteer work commitment; how-
ever, they’re considered workforce or work-
place contributors.
The Independent Sector (www.independent
sector.org) brought the omission of the 
monetary value of volunteers’ contributions to 
the attention of the philanthropic community. 
For over a decade, the Independent Sector 
has given volunteer work time an hourly 
cash value.

240
Part IV: Writing a Competitive Application Narrative 
Other ($100,000): This amount has two contributory components. The first 
is a donated two-year-old state-of-the-art recreational vehicle. The motor 
home was given to our performing arts organization by a former Board of 
Director’s President who envisioned a mobile arts outreach project that 
would travel throughout Rain County. The fair market value of the motor 
home is $60,980. The second contribution is our dedicated volunteers. These 
individuals help our seasoned performing professionals get ready for perfor-
mances and work as stage hands, both in-house at our mountainside theater 
and at community outreach venues. There are five long-time volunteers who 
contribute at average of 10 hours weekly for 40 weeks annually. The total 
value of their contribution is calculated at $19.51 per hour for a total value 
of $39,020.

In-Kind: $100,000
Other budget summary
Figure 17-6 shows the budget summary for the Mobile Arts Outreach 
Project’s expenses that are included in the other category. In this example, 
the organization requesting the funds is not asking the funder for any monies. 
However, the organization does show that they have $100,000 in in-kind con-
tributions for the Other line item category.

Direct costs or line item totals
Direct costs are expenses for services and products that you need for the 
project and that are not otherwise available at your organization. These 
services and products include personnel, travel, equipment, supplies, 
contractual services, and anything included in the other category.
 
Direct costs and the category’s corresponding line item are used only in 
those government grants or contracts where you actually see direct 
costs and indirect costs in the application guidelines and on the preprinted 
budget forms.

241
 Chapter 17: Connecting the Budget to the Plan of Action
Indirect costs
Indirect costs — often called overhead — cover services and products that 
are essential for your overall organization and are consumed in some 
small degree by the project. Some indirect costs include things such as the 
telephone bill, rent payments, maintenance costs, and insurance premiums. 
Remember: Like direct costs, the indirect cost line is one of those terms 
reserved for government grant applications and contract bids.
Indirect costs are usually calculated as a percentage of total direct costs. 
They can range from as little as 5 percent for a charter school to as much 
as 66 percent for a major university. Your agency may already have an 
approved indirect cost rate from a state or federal agency. If you have an 
approved rate, that information is probably on file in the business manager’s 
office. If your agency’s business manager doesn’t have that information, 
contact the U.S. Office of Management and Budget or your state’s Fiscal 
Agency.
I’ve actually written federal grant applications with 50 percent indirect cost 
rates built in. This means that if the application is funded and the direct 
costs total $1 million, another $500,000 will be tacked on for indirect costs. 
(Those are your taxes at work!)
 
If you apply for a government grant and your organization has an indirect cost 
rate of 20 percent, you can choose not to ask for the entire 20 percent from 
the funding agency. Instead, because you want to look good and capable of 
managing a grant, you can ask for 10 percent from the funding agency and 
make up the other 10 percent as an in-kind contribution. (See the later section 
“Digging Up Matching Funds” for more.)
The following is an example of an indirect costs narrative. Note that the 
$7,056 requested for indirect costs covers project-related expenses for 
vehicle maintenance and repairs, utilities, office space for the project staff, 
and printing.
Our performing arts organization has been approved for an indirect cost 
rate of 10 percent by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. This 
approval was granted in 2004 when we applied for and received our first 
National Endowment for the Arts capacity building grant. Indirect charges 
are calculated for the total government funds requested ($85,556) minus the 
contractual funds requested ($15,000), which equals $70,556 multiplied by 
10 percent, or $7,056.
 
• Total Direct Costs (Federal Request): $85,556
 
• Total Indirect Costs: $7,056

242
Part IV: Writing a Competitive Application Narrative 
 
• Total Federal Request: $92,612
 
• Matching Funds: $125,600
 
• Total Project Budget: $218,212
 
When you tally up the total amount of federal funds requested, you add 
the total direct costs to the total indirect costs. Then you calculate in your 
matching funds, which results in the total project budget.

Digging Up Matching Funds
Eventually, every grant or contract bid writer faces the challenge of finding 
the matching funds required to meet the conditions of a funder’s guidelines. 
Push your fears aside and rev your engine because finding matching funds 
is about to become a lot easier. First of all, read the grant application 
instructions regarding matching funds. Ask yourself how this funder defines 
matching funds. Can the match be an in-kind contribution, also referred to as 
soft cash, or are you required to identify actual cash (called a hard match) 
for the match?
In my travels across the country, I’m amazed at the feedback I get about how 
difficult it is for grant applicants to come up with required match amounts 
in order to qualify for some state and federal grants. I’ve put together the 
following information to assist you in finding those much sought-after 
matching funds.

243
 Chapter 17: Connecting the Budget to the Plan of Action
In-kind (soft matching funds)
The in-kind part of the budget summary and budget detail narrative is where 
you list the value of human and material resources that your organization 
will make available to the grant-funded project (meaning that you aren’t 
asking the funder for all the resources needed to implement the project).
When a grant application requires matching funds, every dollar requested 
from the funding source must be matched with a specified percent of your 
own monies. The funder’s guidelines tell you whether the match is 10, 20, 50, 
or 100 percent of the grant request.
 
The following are potential sources of soft matching funds or in-kind 
contributions:
 
✓ Construction: Eligible construction is any aspect of infrastructure work 
that will be donated by trade professionals or volunteers.
 
✓ Contractual: Eligible sources are contracted consultants who will lend 
their expertise and time to the project, once funded, but whose 
expenses may not be requested from the funder.
 
✓ Equipment: Eligible equipment must be existing or to be purchased; 
coverage of costs can’t be requested from the funder.
 
✓ Fringe benefits: Fringe benefits for administrative, clerical, contracted, 
and facilities personnel. Eligible fringe benefits are prorated based 
on the actual amount of time to be contributed to funder-supported 
activities.
 
✓ Indirect charges: Eligible indirect charges can be a line item request in 
the grant budget; however, if you’re struggling to identify matching 
funds, use indirect charges as a matching contribution to be absorbed 
by your project. Indirect charges range from 5 percent to 66 percent of 
the budget subtotal and are allowable only in federal grant applications.
 
✓ Miscellaneous: Other eligible sources include utilities and telephone 
expenses that are related to implementing the project but aren’t allow-
able line items in the funding request; printing, copying, postage, and 
evaluation expenses not included in contractual or supplies; and any 
other costs to be incurred by your project that haven’t been requested 
from the funder.
 
✓ Personnel: Personnel who will provide direct or indirect services for 
the grant-funded activities but who won’t be charged to the project’s 
budget expenditures as a line item request to the funder. So, on a pro-
rated basis, administrative, clerical, contracted, and facilities personnel 
(including custodial staff) positions can all be used as soft match 
line items.

244
Part IV: Writing a Competitive Application Narrative 
 
✓ Supplies: Eligible supplies must be newly purchased or be on hand from 
existing inventory; coverage of costs can’t be requested from the funder.
 
✓ Travel expenses: Eligible travel must be grant-related for key or 
ancillary personnel, and coverage of the expenses can’t be requested 
from the funder.
Cash match (hard matching funds)
Inventory your cash on hand and work with your finance person or business 
manager to determine how much of the cash on hand can be used as cash 
match for the project, if funded. Here are a couple scenarios of how a cash 
match can be pulled together:
 
✓ You hire a full-time staff person for special projects. The money you 
use to hire this person comes from your general operating budget 
(explained later in this section). At a later date, when you’re writing a 
funding request, you decide to reassign the full-time special projects 
staff person to a full-time position on the project for which you’re 
requesting funding. This person’s salary is already covered by your 
operating funds. So, when you include the special projects staff person 
in the personnel section’s total in the budget summary and in the budget 
detail narrative, you can earmark this person’s salary and fringe benefits 
as matching (cash) funds.
 
✓ You decide to pay for all target population training supplies out of 
your existing operating budget (general operating expenses). The cost 
for the training supplies is $10,000 — the amount of your cash match or 
matching funds for the supplies line item in your budget summary and 
budget detail narrative.
When you’re trying to find available money for a hard cash match, some 
places you should look to first are
 
✓ A specialized allocation (when your chief financial officer transfers cash 
from the general operating funds account into a specially allocated 
account to be used for hard cash matching funds)
 
✓ Other state or federal grant funds
 
✓ Private sector grants for portions of the project
 
✓ Your general operating funds (unrestricted monies to pay the day-to-day 
operating expenses of your organization)
 
Be sure to check with the funding agency to which you’re applying to make 
sure that these types of matching funds are allowed.

245
 Chapter 17: Connecting the Budget to the Plan of Action
Crunching the Numbers Ethically
Completing a project budget can be an individual effort or a team effort. 
Either way you go about it, however, developing thorough and accurate proj-
ect budgets to present to funders or bid-letting agencies involves more than 
just putting numbers down in a line and adding them together. Many factors 
affect how much you ask for in grant funding.
 
When a grant’s awarded, it’s awarded in good faith and based on both your 
budget request and the funding source’s grantmaking capacity. So, your first 
goal in developing the budget section of your application narrative should be 
fine-tuning your budget request to reflect the actual costs of your program 
needs. Your second goal is getting your program funded in full, of course!
Compiling accurate cost figures
Aren’t sure what kind of budget numbers to put down? Can’t figure out how 
much you’ll have to pay a program director? Don’t know how much you’ll 
have to spend on a copy machine? I’ve got an easy solution: Use your 
telephone. Call the United Way in your area, for example, to determine their 
salary ranges for program directors, program coordinators, clerical support, 
accounting clerks, and other staff positions. Call vendors for specification 
sheets on equipment. It’s amazing how quickly you can find answers by 
asking people in the know!
The Internet has a wealth of information on nonprofit organizations, 
including salary surveys. Run a quick Internet search, using your favorite 
search engine, for nonprofit salary surveys.
 
Network with other organizations in your community to locate purchasing 
cooperatives. With these co-ops, multiple agencies get together to place 
orders for like items in bulk, thus receiving a bulk purchase discount. All the 
members of the cooperative benefit by reducing their overall operating costs. 
Take notes and create a cooperative purchasing information file so you know 
who to call or e-mail for future cost-sharing opportunities.
 
Funders call applicants to get more information on a line item. So be prepared!
Including all possible program income
If you anticipate having any program income at all, you must list a projected 
amount at the end of your budget summary table and subtract it from the 
total project costs, which results in a lesser amount needed in grant funds. 
Examples of possible program income are:

246
Part IV: Writing a Competitive Application Narrative 
 
✓ Interest: For instance, you may earn interest on an endowment fund that 
you’re allowed to use annually to assist with program costs.
 
✓ Membership fees: For example, a museum might have members who 
pay an annual fee for discounted entry passes.
 
✓ Special events revenue: For example, you may be planning to hold a 
fundraising auction to collect additional monies for field trips, equip-
ment, or other items or activities in the project’s design.
 
✓ Ticket sales for planned events: For instance, you may work within 
a performing arts organization that puts on three plays at the local 
community theater, and patrons purchase tickets to see your troupe 
perform.
 
✓ Tuition: For example, you may receive payment or reimbursement 
from a state agency for training welfare-to-work participants, and your 
grant request is for monies to counsel and provide intensive follow-up 
coaching to new job entrants from the welfare-to-work pool.
 
Not reporting your income is unethical. Just think about the dozens, hun-
dreds, or thousands of proposals a foundation or corporate giving entity 
receives daily, weekly, and monthly. Ninety percent of the time, the funding 
source must send out letters to grant seekers regretfully stating that there are 
simply not enough funds available to fund all the requests received. If you 
choose to omit the fact that you expect program income and greedily ask for 
the whole ball of wax, you’re taking thousands of dollars out of the funder’s 
annual grantmaking budget. Your excess could have funded another grant, 
perhaps for a struggling start-up agency with no other resources. From an 
ethical standpoint, asking for grant funds means taking a private oath never to 
ask for more than you actually need.
Avoiding leftover funds
Asking for too much isn’t looked upon favorably by any funding source. In 
fact, giving leftover money back at the end of the grant period is a straight 
road to grant suicide — meaning you may not be able to go back to that 
funder, ever! No funder wants money back. Why? They have already worked 
the grant award or allocation into their annual giving budgets. Returned 
money is a hassle, from accounting to reallocation, if the funder has a 
specific amount of grant funds that it has committed to awarding annually.
To top it off, giving grant award money back may send the following signals 
to funders:
 
✓ Your organization (the grant applicant) didn’t submit an accurate 
budget request — you overshot some of the line items and now you 
have more money than you know what to do with!

247
 Chapter 17: Connecting the Budget to the Plan of Action
 
✓ You aren’t creative enough to find a way to use the leftover monies in 
your project to better serve the target population.
 
✓ You failed to carry out all the proposed activities and had leftover 
monies.
No matter how you view the fact that you have leftover monies, the funder 
doesn’t see it as a positive thing. Meet with your board of directors or project 
advisory council to brainstorm how the monies can be spent, legally, on 
project-related needs.
 
Don’t pat yourself on the back when you have money leftover at the end of a 
project. Wherever it was that you cut corners or scrimped, your end beneficia-
ries (target population) didn’t receive the high-quality program that you origi-
nally proposed to your funders. You look cheap, inefficient, and unreliable as 
a candidate for additional funding from that particular funder.
Projecting Multiyear Costs
When you’re planning to construct a building or purchase specific items of 
equipment, engineers or vendors can usually give you bids that are very 
close to the actual cost of the construction or equipment you’ll need if you 
win the grant and make the expenditure. However, when you’re seeking fund-
ing for personnel or line items with prices that fluctuate, take care to account 
for inflation when preparing your budget. In a multiyear request, your line 
items should increase by at least 5 percent annually. Here’s how to create an 
award-winning multiyear budget summary table:
 
✓ Column 1: Type your line item categories (listed at the beginning of this 
chapter).
 
✓ Column 2: Type your Year 1 in-kind contributions by category.
 
✓ Column 3: Type your Year 1 cash contributions by category.
 
✓ Column 4: Type your Year 1 amounts, by category, requested from 
the funder.
 
✓ Column 5: Type your Year 2 in-kind contributions by category.
 
✓ Column 6: Type your Year 2 cash contributions by category.
 
✓ Column 7: Type your Year 2 amounts, by category, requested from 
the funder.
Continue this sequence for all remaining years in your multiyear budget 
support request. Only run your total at the bottom of each column, vertically. 
Don’t run horizontal totals (at the end of rows); it’s too confusing for the 
funder to nail down the actual costs and requests for any specific year.

248
Part IV: Writing a Competitive Application Narrative 
Using a Fiscal Sponsor When You’re 
a New Kid on the Nonprofit Block
A fiscal sponsor is an organization that has 501 (c)(3) nonprofit status 
awarded by the Internal Revenue Service. Usually, a fiscal sponsor is 
a veteran agency with a long and successful track record in winning and 
managing grants.
The role of fiscal sponsors is to act as umbrella organizations for newer 
nonprofit organizations that have little or no experience in winning and man-
aging grant awards. Your new organization is the grant applicant, and the 
established agency is the fiscal sponsor. It acts as the fiduciary agent for your 
grant monies. In other words, it’s responsible for depositing the monies in a 
separate account and for creating procedures for your organization to access 
the grant monies.
Why would you use a fiscal sponsor instead of applying directly for grant 
funds yourself? Because some foundations and corporate givers don’t award 
grant monies to nonprofit organizations that haven’t completed the IRS 
advanced ruling period. Government agencies don’t have advanced ruling 
period–related requirements.
 
Sometimes a fiscal sponsor wants you to include expenses for accounting 
services or grant management in the other section of your budget summary 
and in the budget detail narrative. This practice is acceptable to funding 
sources. Just make sure to select a fiscal sponsor with whom you’re on good 
terms and have open lines of communication. Otherwise, your grant monies 
could be slow in trickling down.
If your fiscal sponsor indicates that it will provide the fiscal management 
services at no cost, mention this at the end of your budget detail narrative. 
Also present the fact upfront, in the Building Grant Applicant Credibility 
section of the narrative (see Chapter 13 for more details). The following is an 
example introduction of an organization that plans to use a fiscal sponsor:
The Mercury Outback Riders Club will use the Community Foundation of 
Fairfax County as its grant applicant. While our organization is a recognized 
nonprofit organization in the Commonwealth of Virginia, we have not filed 
for IRS 501 (c)(3) nonprofit status. Our Board of Directors is planning to 
apply for this status later this year. In the meantime, the Board has 
approved working with the Community Foundation of Fairfax County who 
has agreed to act as our fiscal agent.

249
 Chapter 17: Connecting the Budget to the Plan of Action
When selecting a fiscal sponsor, do the following:
 
✓ Always find a well-established nonprofit organization that has a 
successful financial management track record.
 
✓ Ask your local banker to make a recommendation for a suitable fiscal 
sponsor.
 
✓ Look for community-based foundations that are set up to act as 
umbrella management structures for new and struggling nonprofit 
organizations.
 
Creating a written agreement is a good way to prevent any misunderstandings 
between you and your fiscal sponsor regarding how the money will be used 
and accessed.
When it comes to your relationship with your fiscal sponsor, keep the 
following points in mind:
 
✓ The fiscal sponsor is responsible if your organization mismanages 
the money.
 
✓ The fiscal sponsor is responsible if the fiscal sponsor mismanages 
the money.
 
✓ If an audit for financial expenditures is in order, the funding source 
can audit the fiscal sponsor, and the fiscal sponsor can audit your 
organization.
Following Special Rules for a 
For-Profit Financial Proposal
 
If your business is seeking contract awards, the budget line items still need to 
be presented in a detailed narrative format accompanied by either a budget 
summary table that you create or a form designed by the bid-letting agency. 
The budget line items for nonprofits are the same as the budget line items 
for for-profits (businesses). However, in addition to the guidelines I provide 
earlier in this chapter, I offer these recommendations to help you when you’re 
preparing the financial or cost section of your contract bid:
 
✓ Ask the bid-letting agency whether you can include your costs for 
services or products in the body of the bid response document 
narrative or whether you have to prepare a separate financial or cost 
proposal.

250
Part IV: Writing a Competitive Application Narrative 
 
✓ Ask the bid-letting agency whether the financial or cost proposal must 
be submitted under separate cover (in a different envelope).
 
✓ Ask the bid-letting agency whether you can add your administrative 
overhead costs and a profit margin to the final total costs for the 
delivery of your services or products. Overhead costs are the costs to 
do business — the expenses that aren’t connected to any specific line 
item but would be considered indirect costs (which are explained 
earlier in this chapter). A profit margin is the money you want to make 
after all the expenses have been paid.

Part V
Reaching the 
Finish Line

In this part . . .
B
efore you can cross the finish line (and cross it first, 
of course), you have to properly finalize your fund-
ing request package. There are also a ton of follow-up 
tasks you must take care of. In fact, there are so many 
tasks that you’ll want to create a checklist to make sure 
you don’t forget one of these critical follow-up steps.
When everything has been researched and written, you 
probably expect results or feedback from the funding 
source. So, in this part, you get to read about how to 
celebrate your success — or how to take the right actions 
on a rejection notice. Finally, I round out this part by 
explaining how to write a winning corporate letter 
request.

W
hen you’re nearly at the bottom of the tall grant writing mountain, 
there are just a few finishing touches that you can’t afford to over-
look. At this point, it’s time for you to wrap up your funding package (another 
name for the finished document you’re about to submit). Why are these fin-
ishing touches so important? Because if you fail to adhere to the funder’s 
packaging guidelines, you could lose technical review points (see Chapters 9 
and 10 for more on the peer review). And if you lose points, your grant appli-
cation or contract bid could be eliminated before it starts the race for a com-
petitive monetary award.
Yes, I want you to feverishly read every chapter in this book and take my 
advice to heart and to pen or keyboard. However, if you read only a handful 
of chapters, this should be one of them. This chapter gives you the final com-
petitive advantage to winning grant and contract awards; it tells you the final 
steps you must take before submitting your grant application or contract bid 
for funding consideration.
Checking All Requirements
If you can’t find a funder-provided checklist or suggested table of contents 
listing when you first start reading your grant application or contract bid 
instructions, make your own. Based on what you read in the funder’s 
instructions, type your own list showing the order of the application. In other 

254
Part V: Reaching the Finish Line 
words, what’s the first document the funder needs to read when opening 
your funding package? After you figure out the first, most important docu-
ment, go on to list the next and the next until you have a completed listing for 
the forms, narrative sections, and attachments. (Be sure to also hash out the 
recommended length for each section or for the entire narrative.) Creating 
your own checklist gives you peace of mind and will cue you as to when the 
funding package is complete and ready for submission to the funder.
 
Some funding agencies help you out by including a checklist in the grant 
application guidelines to guide you as you put your grant application package 
together. Use this checklist to mark off each section of the grant application 
that the funder expects to find when your envelope is opened by funding 
agency staff. Some funders even ask you to include the checklist in the funding 
application package. Read carefully for instructions on where to place the 
checklist in the final application package.
Cover materials
The cover materials are the first things grant reviewers see when they pick 
up your application, so make sure that each part listed here is finished, 
well done, and in its proper place. (See Chapter 12 for more details about 
these items.)
 
❏ A cover letter typed on the organization’s letterhead and signed by the 
president of the board or the executive director.
 
❏ All prenarrative forms in place, with empty information fields filled in 
with the requested information.
 
❏ The abstract or executive summary, which should be limited to 250 
words or less and should appear on a separate page. This section is 
merely a brief overview of the application’s contents.
 
 The executive summary is the same as the abstract, only with a different 
title. The executive summary is used in federal grant applications, and 
some regional grantmaking forums have designed applications that call 
for an executive summary. Private sector funders (foundations and cor-
porations) usually ask for abstracts. Your abstract should be placed 
before the grant proposal narrative.
 
❏ The table of contents, which is required by most federal and state grant 
applications.

255
 Chapter 18: Wrapping Up Your Funding Package
Introduction to your organization
The organization and history section of your grant application narrative 
introduces the funding agency to the grant applicant. This is a formal 
“this is who we are” type of written introduction. Double-check what 
you’ve written in this section; make sure you’ve addressed the following 
information points:
 
❏ History of the organization
 
❏ Major accomplishments relevant to the proposed grant-funded project
 
❏ Current programs and activities relevant to the proposed grant-funded 
project
 
❏ Target population demographics that mirror the types of populations 
the funder wants to support in its current funding cycle
 
❏ Collaborations with local, regional, and statewide nonprofit and 
for-profit partners
In your introduction, did you refer the reader to any attachments? If so, keep 
a running list of attached documents so you can double-check that they’re in 
place before sending the application out.
Flip to Chapter 13 for more about building your organization’s credibility as a 
grant applicant in the introduction.
Problem or needs statement
Make sure that your problem or needs statement touches on the following 
topics:
 
❏ The problem that’s in critical need of grant funding
 
❏ How the problem was identified
 
❏ How the problem looks from national-, regional-, and local-level 
perspectives
 
❏ The current national research that proves the existence of the problem
 
❏ The gloom, doom, drama, and trauma that justify the need for grant 
funds
If you refer the reader to any attachments, list them for double-checking 
later.

256
Part V: Reaching the Finish Line 
 
Take another look at the first two narrative sections in your funding request. If 
you didn’t include at least one or two graphics, go back and look for key 
pieces of information that can be presented in table or chart form; even a map 
of your location will help give the grant reviewer’s eyes a visual break!
Check out Chapter 14 for the scoop on conveying a hopeless situation for 
your problem statement.
Program design or plan of operation
The program design or plan of action is the real meat of your grant applica-
tion (see Chapter 15 for details). That’s why it’s so important to make sure 
you’ve hit all the right points. Be sure that your program design contains the 
following:
 
❏ One concise statement expressing the purpose of the program
 
❏ Goals that shadow the funder’s specific funding goals
 
❏ SMART outcome objectives written in quantifiable terms
 
❏ Process objectives in “activity talking” terms
 
❏ Impact objectives expressed in terms of their benefits to end recipients
 
❏ The Logic Model graphic, which helps the grant reader connect the dots 
between goals and objectives
 
❏ The time frame for starting and ending all proposed grant-funded 
activities
 
❏ Integration of the evaluation plan into the overall program design or 
plan of operation
 
❏ A dissemination plan
Did you refer the reader to any attachments or appendices? If so, remember 
to add them to your running list so you can check them later.
Evaluation and dissemination
If the funder requires you to submit a separate evaluation section with your 
application, make sure yours addresses the following information points:
 
❏ The methods your organization will use to evaluate the progress of your 
objectives
 
❏ How you plan to share your findings with others

257
 Chapter 18: Wrapping Up Your Funding Package
 
In some Common Grant Application formats, the evaluation belongs in the 
attachments section, not in the grant narrative.
If you refer the reader to any attachments, add them to your attachments 
checklist for double-checking later.
See Chapter 15 for more about the evaluation process, which is a part of the 
plan of action.
Key personnel, resources, and 
your equity statement
In this portion of your application, make sure you provide details on the fol-
lowing elements of your program:
 
❏ Key personnel, including each person’s qualifications and the amount of 
time he or she will allocate to the project
 
❏ Resources that your organization and its partners bring to the program
 
❏ A demonstration of equity (fairness/equal opportunity for all) in hiring 
staff and recruiting program participants
 
In most Common Grant Application formats, key personnel information 
belongs in the attachments, not the grant narrative. If you referred to any 
attachments, don’t forget to add them to the attachment checklist.
Flip to Chapter 16 for more on how to present your resources and 
show fairness.
Budget summary and detail
The budget portion of your application is where you must be as accurate as 
possible. After all, money’s a pretty serious thing — especially to the funder 
that’s handing it over! Be sure that you
 
❏ Double-check your budget summary totals.
 
❏ Write a detailed narrative to support the budget summary’s line item 
amounts.

258
Part V: Reaching the Finish Line 
As you’ve done for the other sections of your application, note your 
references to any attachments so you can ensure that the attachments are 
in place.
For further information on connecting the information in your budget to the 
plan of action, refer to Chapter 17.
Finalizing a Contract Bid with Care
Earlier sections in this chapter guide grant writers in pulling together the 
final documents for a funding request application. Be sure to go back and 
review those sections because as a for-profit business going after contract 
bids, you can expect to see some of the same sections in Request For 
Proposal (RFP) guidelines.
When you’re preparing a contract bid, the RFP guidelines tell you exactly 
what elements you’re required to submit. If the bid-letting agency requested 
information about your company’s experience, check to verify that you’ve 
included the following:
 
❏ Your company’s legally incorporated name as well as its Doing Business 
As (DBA) name
 
❏ The name of the person(s) who founded your company and the year it 
was founded
 
❏ The state of its incorporation
 
❏ The number of years your company has been providing services or 
products similar to the contracted services or products you’re propos-
ing to deliver to the bid-letting agency
 
❏ Your concise and focused mission statement
 
❏ The company’s areas of expertise
 
❏ The track record for winning and managing contract awards
 
❏ Collaborations with other agencies
 
❏ The background on your contract-specific services or products, includ-
ing the number of individuals served or number of products sold
 
❏ Insider information on the extent of the problem or the supply and 
demand issues that the bid-letting agency is seeking to solve with a con-
tracted services award
 
❏ Recent research citations to validate the problem statements and/or 
national trends supporting the problem or product-related data
 
❏ All points required in the scope of services section (using the same 
headings and subheadings as those found in the bid document)

259
 Chapter 18: Wrapping Up Your Funding Package
 
❏ How you will monitor the progress of your benchmarks (measurable 
outcome objectives) and who will be responsible for these activities
 
❏ The name and qualifications of the principal investigator or project 
director
 
❏ The type of bid specifications required to meet the bid-letting agency’s 
cost proposal requirements
As you wrap up your contract bid, take a moment to do the following:
 
❏ Check the bid document’s instructions for how to package your financial 
or cost proposal
 
❏ Recheck all calculations
Be sure to check out the contract-specific info I provide in Chapters 13 
through 17.
The Eyes Have It: Preventing 
Fatal Mistakes
I don’t know about you, but I can never spot my own mistakes — not when I 
started writing grant applications and not now! After putting so much time 
and energy into your application or bid proposal, your eyes may be too 
strained to spot fatal writing or formatting errors. Unfortunately, the individ-
uals who will be reviewing and evaluating your materials (program officers 
and peer reviewers) are trained, like hawks, to find your mistakes. And guess 
what happens when they find one? Your application is at high risk of not 
being funded. That’s why it’s important to recruit a fresh pair of eyes when it 
comes to making sure your writing, formatting, and adherence to the funder’s 
guidelines are spot on.
 
To get the most from your final edit, you have three options:
 
✓ Finish your funding proposal early (one to two days before it’s due) and 
lay it aside for 24 hours before rereading.
 
✓ Have a colleague proof and edit all your work. Be sure to pick someone 
who doesn’t feel intimidated or shy about marking up your mistakes.
 
✓ Secure the services of a proofreader or editor.
For the last two options, you may need to allow a little more than one or two 
days. You want to know ahead of time what you’re going to do. That way you 
can line up the resources you choose to work with, and then build the 
needed time into your deadline schedule.

260
Part V: Reaching the Finish Line 
After allowing a few dozen near fatal mistakes to slip by, I decided to pay 
someone else to run their fresh eyes over my bloopers and blunders. I’m 
proud to say that I’ve used a professional editing company for over 18 years.
 
Whether you choose to proofread your application yourself or hire someone 
to do it for you, always run the spell-check feature on your word-processing 
program. It takes only a few minutes, but fixing spelling errors early in the 
proofreading game saves you time later on, when you may be working to fix 
more prominent errors.
If you decide to proofread your own grant application or bid proposal, here’s 
a list of the types of bloopers and blunders to look for and correct:
 
✓ Nonmeasurable objectives (Watch out, because failing to write SMART 
objectives is the most common reason proposals aren’t funded.)
 
✓ Narrative section headings and subheadings that aren’t the same as the 
funder’s review criteria headings
 
✓ Unpaginated pages in the narrative
 
✓ No sequential pagination from the cover form to the last attached 
or appended item when the funder has requested total document 
pagination
 
✓ Different font types and sizes when the funder instructs you to use only 
one particular font type and size
 
✓ Incorrect spacing between sentences when the funder indicates 
single- or double-spacing only
 
✓ Orphan lines, headings, or subheadings left hanging alone at the bottom 
of a page
 
✓ Blatant spelling errors or transposing of words (For example, using there 
instead of their, hour instead of our, and so forth.) Use a hard-copy dic-
tionary and a thesaurus or your word processing spelling and grammar 
check options to ensure that you’ve selected the correct word.
 
✓ Omitting a heading or subheading response because you believe it 
doesn’t apply to your organization or failing to type “Not Applicable” 
under the heading or subheading or in the information field box
 
✓ Grammatical, punctuation, and sentence structure errors
Check out Chapter 10 for more about the importance of formatting your 
application properly.
 
Different funders and bid-letting agencies have different rules. You can win 
the grant or contract seeking game if you read and adhere to each funder’s 
specific formatting rules.

261
 Chapter 18: Wrapping Up Your Funding Package
Putting Your Attachments in Order
The attachments to your grant narrative go in a specific order. For most 
government grant applications, the attachments are compiled in the order 
that you refer to them in the narrative. So, read through the narrative from 
beginning to end and put your attachments in that order. Also in the narra-
tive, you should have numbered each attachment when you referenced it — 
for example, attachment 1, attachment 2, and so on. Make sure you type the 
attachment number on each attachment. I like to type this in the upper right-
hand corner of the attachment.
Organizational structure/administration
A funding agency may request lengthier information on your organization’s 
structure and administration processes. If you don’t have sufficient space in 
your grant application or contract bid narrative, you can refer the grant 
reader to the attachments.
 
In your attachments, you should include a brief description of how your orga-
nization works, including responses to the following questions. (See Chapter 
16 for the personnel information that can be expanded on in the attachments.)
 
✓ What are the responsibilities of the board, staff, volunteers, and (if a 
membership organization) the members? Write a brief paragraph 
giving the reader a one- or two-sentence description of each group’s 
responsibilities. Sometimes for a new, nonprofit organization, I insert a 
copy of the bylaws to fulfill this attachment requirement.
 
✓ How are these groups (the board, the staff, and so on) representative 
of the communities with which you work? What are the general demo-
graphics of the organization? For this attachment requirement, I usually 
provide a board roster that includes each board member’s name, 
address, occupation, gender, ethnicity, and term on the board. I also 
attach a list of key staff members and give gender and ethnicity informa-
tion for each individual.
 
✓ Who will be involved in carrying out the plans outlined in this 
request? Include a brief paragraph summarizing the qualifications of key 
individuals involved. For this attachment requirement, I put in one-page 
résumés for each key staff person.
 
✓ How will the project be organized? Include an organizational chart 
showing the decision-making structure. Make sure the chart is up-to-
date and includes a box for volunteers (if your organization uses any). 
Titles are more important than names, especially given that the staff 
could change over the duration of the grant’s funding period.

262
Part V: Reaching the Finish Line 
Finances
The attachments in the finance section should cover or include
 
✓ The organization’s current annual operating budget.
 
✓ The current project budget.
 
✓ A list of other funding sources for this request. Include the name of each 
funder, the amount requested, the date you sent the grant proposal, 
and the status of your request (whether funds have been received, 
committed, or are projected/pending). I like to use a four-column table 
to present this information in an easy-to-read format. See Figure 18-1 for 
an example.
 
✓ The financial statement for the most recent complete year (expenses, 
revenue, and balance sheet). Use the audited version, if available. 
If your organization has one of those 20-pound financial reports, pull 
out the comments and breakout budgets for each department and just 
attach the overall organization expenses and revenue along with the 
balance sheet.
 
✓ A copy of your IRS 501 (c)(3) letter. If you don’t have 501 (c)(3) status, 
check with the funder to see whether it’s willing to fund through your 
fiscal sponsor. You may need to submit additional information and add 
information on your fiscal sponsor to the portion of your grant narrative 
that introduces your organization. Another possibility is that the funder 
may be willing to exercise expenditure responsibility.
Flip to Chapter 17 for details on the budget information that goes directly 
into grant applications.

 Chapter 18: Wrapping Up Your Funding Package
Other supporting material
Other miscellaneous materials may include letters of support or commitment 
(up to three). It’s okay to have some handwritten letters of support from your 
constituency; handwritten letters have a lot of impact on the reader. And 
don’t correct spelling or grammar errors, which make the letters more 
authentic.
Additional relevant materials include your most recent annual report (an 
original, not a photocopy), recent newsletters sent out by your organization, 
newspaper clippings about your programs, and previous evaluations or 
reviews (up to three). Warning: Newspaper articles are useless if they 
aren’t dated.
Finally, this section is the one where I put supporting documentation that I’ve 
referenced throughout the grant application narrative that doesn’t fit in any 
of the other attachment sections.
Dressing Up and Mailing 
Your Final Application
You can apply some final touches to give your grant application that extra 
edge. The techniques I cover in the following sections have helped me 
achieve my own funding success rate of 90 to 95 percent. Sharing these tips 
with you means that I want you to be successful in getting most, if not all, of 
your grant requests funded.
Using the right bindings
All government grant application guidelines tell you how to secure and 
submit your final grant application package (the cover forms, assurances, 
certifications, budget forms, narrative, and required attachments). Usually, 
you’re instructed not to staple or spiral bind the finished document. 
Practically all government funding agencies need numerous copies for the 
peer review process, and it’s easier to make copies of a document that hasn’t 
been stapled together or bound. Even if an agency’s grant guidelines tell you 
to send one original and two copies, the funder will still make additional 
copies for the review process.

264
Part V: Reaching the Finish Line 
 
Anything other than a simple clip looks (and is) wasteful. Unless instructed 
otherwise, stick with what’s unobtrusive and effective. Also, don’t create fancy 
graphic-filled covers; no one asks for them and no one looks at them!
Mailing the right way
For cover letters and cover forms, you can use your word-processing soft-
ware’s mail merge feature to set up the following merge fields for your funder 
information: contact person, title, funder, address1, address2, city, state, zip, 
and amount req. (Use your software manual to walk through mail merge 
steps.) You can insert the appropriate information into each data field, which 
then allows you to mail merge into your cover form or cover letter, print out 
a master funding source list for tracking purposes, and print mailing labels.
If you aren’t mail-merge savvy, I strongly recommend that you get up to 
speed. To do so, check the software manual of your word-processing pro-
gram or consult the For Dummies book that covers your program.
As you know, if the funding source sets a deadline, your application must 
reach the funding source by that time. Government grant guidelines dictate 
that the application must be postmarked or uploaded by a certain date 
and time. Personally, I don’t work 25 to 100 hours on a government grant 
application and then leave the application to regular mail. I prefer a guaran-
tee stronger than a mere postage stamp, so I use an express courier service. 
I always get the application to the courier two weekdays before the date 
by which the package must be postmarked. For foundation and corporate 
grants, I use regular mail when I can be sure I’m not going to miss a due date.
 
Using an express mail service may cost a little more, but it ensures that your 
application will make it to its destination and enter the review process. By the 
way, government agencies make no exceptions for late grant applications. 
Even a natural disaster isn’t a valid excuse. If the grant application is due on a 
specific date, you better have it uploaded and checked in by Application 
Control Center by that date. All the pleading, whining, and cajoling in the 
world, including calls to the funder from your congressional representatives, 
won’t make a difference.
Submitting Your Information 
Electronically
Well, I’ve certainly been like an old dog learning new tricks over the past few 
years. I’ve managed to learn how to register with Grants.gov (see Chapters 4 
and 5 for full details on this public funding epicenter). I’ve also figured out 

265
 Chapter 18: Wrapping Up Your Funding Package
how to download application guidelines and forms, upload completed narra-
tives and attachments, and fill in PDF forms. Today, e-grants are the only way 
to submit your funding request to many corporations and foundations and to 
most government agencies, especially the federal government.
The Grants.gov Web site is the gateway for federal e-grants. In this section, I 
guide you through this Web site, one of the most comprehensive e-grants 
systems. Getting a handle on the ins and outs here prepare you for the much 
easier online application processes used by corporations and foundations.
The Grants.gov Web site allows you to do the following:
 
1. Find and download a grant or cooperative agreement application 
package. To download an application package, enter the CFDA number 
and/or Funding Opportunity Number (found at the top of a Grants.gov 
alert bulletin), and then click the “Download Package” button. (See 
Chapters 4 and 5 for how to subscribe to the Grants.gov system and 
read a grant opportunity announcement.)
 
2. Complete your grant or cooperative agreement application package. 
After you download the application package, you can complete it offline 
(meaning you’re not connected to the Internet). This gives you the 
ability to route the application package to others in your organization as 
an e-mail attachment, much as you would with any shared document.
 
 Four sets of instructions are available to assist you when completing an 
application package:
 
• Agency instructions: These are agency-specific application 
package instructions and must be downloaded separately from 
the application package.
 
• Application package cover sheet instructions: These are addi-
tional instructions providing information on how to complete 
application package forms. These instructions are located on the 
cover sheet of the application package.
 
• Application package instructions: These are located at the bottom 
of the application package and provide information about filling 
out the application.
 
• Field-level instructions: These instructions are available by 
selecting the field-level help button, and they provide specific 
information about each field on the application.
 
 Treat your application as you would any important document. 
Remember to save it to your computer often because changes are NOT 
automatically saved. When you complete the application package, 
be sure to save the application prior to submitting it. Also, the applica-
tion package can’t be submitted until all required fields have been 
completed.

266
Part V: Reaching the Finish Line 
 
3. Submit the application package. The Submit button on the application 
package cover page becomes active after you download the application 
package, complete all required forms, attach all required documents, 
and save your application package. Click on the Submit button after you 
do all these things and you’re ready to send your completed application 
to Grants.gov.
 
 Review the provided application summary to confirm that your applica-
tion will be submitted to the program you wish to apply for. If you aren’t 
already connected to the Internet, you’re directed to do so. Log on to 
Grants.gov using the username and password that you registered with 
in the Get Started step. When you log in, your application package is 
automatically uploaded to Grants.gov, and a confirmation screen 
appears when the upload is complete. Note that a Grants.gov tracking 
number is provided to you; record this number so you can refer to it 
should you need to contact customer support.
 
4. Track your application status. This section of the site lets federal grant 
applicants log onto Grants.gov to determine whether they’ve registered 
successfully with Grants.gov, to check the status of their grant 
application submissions, and to manage their applicant profiles.
 
If you try the electronic grant submission process and fall in love with online 
grant writing, then I have the Web site for you. Log on to www.cybergrants.
com and get ready to pop open the bubbly and celebrate. This Web site is for 
grant seekers (nonprofits wanting money) and grantmakers (foundations and 
corporations giving away money). To familiarize yourself with CyberGrants’ 
online application process, click on the Online Demonstrations link. Here 
you’ll be asked to register so that CyberGrants can process your request for a 
demonstration. After you register, you’ll receive prompting (via e-mail) on 
how to access the online demonstration Web page.
If you decide to use CyberGrants for some of your grant seeking, you need to 
register with the site. Make sure to have your organization’s Tax Identification 
Number on hand. Practically every funder requires it, whether you’re submit-
ting an online grant application or a regular hard copy application.

Managing Follow-Up Tasks
In This Chapter
▶ Keeping your hard copies tidy
▶ Providing follow-up information to your partners
▶ Keeping track of your request after it’s submitted
A
fter you’ve submitted your grant request, you’re on solid ground. Are 
you ready to mosey away and never look back? I hope not! You can’t 
start relaxing just yet. It’s time for the filing, clean up, and follow-up tasks. 
From organizing your stacks of project information to keeping track of where 
your project went, tying up loose ends is a must for any well-organized grant 
writer. This chapter shows you how to deal with all the housekeeping issues 
related to seeking grants and contract bids.
Housekeeping 101: Making and 
Organizing Your Paper Copies
 
I’d like to tell you that you don’t need any paper copies of your hard work. 
Unfortunately I can’t! Why? Computer hard drives, external backup systems, 
and even thumb drives can become damaged and non-functional. What 
happens when all your electronic safety systems fizzle? You panic and lose 
copies of everything that’s near and dear to your heart. So, in this brief, but 
important warning, I want to emphasize the need to maintain hard copy 
(paper trail) files.
After you start making hard copies of everything, you may feel overrun by 
paper. That means you need to organize the paper copies of your grant appli-
cations, funding sources, and project information so you have a running start 
on finding grant-related information in the days, weeks, and months after you 
mail your application to the funders.

268
Part V: Reaching the Finish Line 
 
To get a jump on organizing your grant-related paperwork and materials, 
follow these tips:
 
✓ Buy a box of file folders and a few dozen hanging file folders, and then 
create a hanging file labeled with the project name and the month and 
year the application was mailed. This hanging file will be the collection 
place for the file folders outlined in this list — giving you easy access to 
all project-related information.
 
✓ Put the completed grant application and the application’s guidelines 
from the funder in a file folder labeled Application.
 
✓ Put the background research, meeting notes, and other project-related 
information in a separate folder labeled Background Information.
 
✓ Make a file folder titled Funder Communications. This folder contains any 
communications you receive from the funding source.
 
✓ Purchase some cardboard file boxes (the ones with tops) and store all 
of your project-related files in their own box. Make sure to mark the box 
with the name of the project, the date submitted, and the date for antici-
pated funding. Store these out of sight but within quick reach in case the 
funder calls with questions.
After the funding request or contract bid has been mailed, time passes 
quickly. You may start to wonder when the funding agency or contract bid-
letting agency will be making a decision. Go back to your hanging file and 
review all the funder’s or bid-letting agency’s guidelines and instructions to 
find the time frame for interagency review and information on when funding 
decisions are announced.
Making writing and tracking easier 
with grants-management software
A grants-management software program allows 
you to keep track of the entire grant application 
process, including preplanning steps, partner 
information, funder information, due dates for 
fiscal reports and evaluation reports, and grant 
closeout. Commercial software programs are 
available to capture any segment of the grant 
seeking process — or all of it.
Here are a couple of places to look for grants-
management software reviews and advertise-
ments:

 Chapter 19: Managing Follow-Up Tasks
I continue to use this hard-copy tracking process (hanging files and folders) 
because I write several applications or contract bids a month for more than 
one client. And I like to see my projects and their statuses in a more tradi-
tional form — folders and files. However, you may decide that the hard-copy 
tracking approach is too cumbersome. In that case, you can purchase grants-
management tracking software that organizes information about the funder, 
due date, decision date, and outcome of your funding request. See the nearby 
sidebar “Making writing and tracking easier with grants-management soft-
ware” for more details.
Debriefing and Sharing with 
Your Lead Partners
Before you were able to write your grant request, you convened your staff, 
volunteers, community partners, and other interested parties to help your 
organization develop the plan of action (covered in Chapter 15) and provide 
the information for the needs statement (see Chapter 14).
After your grant request has been turned in, it’s time for you to bring the 
stakeholders in your grant’s process back together for a debriefing. (If you 
need more information, Chapter 9 covers your work with stakeholders and 
how they should be involved in the planning phase of grant proposals.)
Follow these debriefing steps:
 
1. Bring each group of stakeholders in to review their efforts with regard 
to how the information gathered from them in the grant planning 
meetings was included in the final grant application.
 
2. Give each person or agency a complete copy of the final grant 
request.
 
3. Answer questions and propose some what-if questions to find out 
whether the stakeholders understand their roles and responsibilities 
if and when the grant application is funded.
 
 Consider asking the following questions, in addition to others appropri-
ate for your project: What if we’re funded for less than we ask for? What 
if we’re not funded at all? What if the needs of our constituents change 
before we’re funded?
 
4. Provide a general overview of the time frame in which the funder 
makes its decision.

270
Part V: Reaching the Finish Line 
 
Even though you may have worked as a group when putting together the nar-
rative information, people present at the debriefing meeting may not have 
been present at the meeting for the document’s final draft review. Some feel-
ings may be hurt when a writing contributor sees massive changes in the final 
document. Remind those who appear to be upset by this type of situation of 
the ultimate goal — to get funded and help a segment of the community.
 
Don’t just share copies of the final grant request; also give your partners a list 
of the funding sources and their contact information. Someone on your team 
may know a foundation trustee or a corporate giving officer personally. And 
sometimes a simple telephone call or an e-mail to a connected friend can make 
the difference between getting funded and not getting funded.
You should share other critical information with your partners, too. Such 
information includes
 
✓ A list of the funders
 
✓ Timelines for funder decisions
 
✓ A master list of partners with contact information
 
✓ Other projects or programs your organization is planning (this info 
opens the door for future partnering opportunities)
What can partners do for you as a result of the sharing process? They can 
commit seed monies to begin program implementation on a small scale. 
Partners who know your needs can unexpectedly make donations of needed 
equipment, program space, or other items and services. Partners can also 
give you leads on other funding sources for the project.
Tracking Your Request When 
It Reaches the Funder
Your grant application has been submitted. You know the funder has 
received it, but you don’t know whether it’s still snug in its envelope or laid 
out on someone’s desk for review and decision making. This section gives 
you the postsubmission protocol of when to call, who to call, and when to 
just chill out and wait for the mail. The rules are different based on the type 
of funding source you send your application to for consideration, so this 
section looks at each type individually.

271
 Chapter 19: Managing Follow-Up Tasks
Managing the follow-up process 
with government grant requests
As soon as you mail your grant application off to a state funding agency or 
upload it via Grants.gov to a federal funding agency, start the tracking pro-
cess. You have specific rules to follow because the money you’re requesting 
comes from public funds. Now’s the time to use those great political contacts 
you’ve made in your state’s capital and in Washington, D.C.
 
Here are some political do’s and don’ts to keep in mind:
 
✓ Do send a complete copy of the grant application to your elected 
officials.
 
✓ Do send directly to the funding agency head (state or federal) any let-
ters of support from elected officials that were written too late to submit 
with your grant application.
 
✓ Do call your senators’ or representatives’ local and Washington offices 
to remind them that you need their assistance in tracking the grant 
application.
 
✓ Do ask your elected officials to keep you posted on future grant oppor-
tunities (no matter what your funding status is). Get in the information 
loop for state and federal monies.
 
✓ Do ask your elected officials to look for “discretionary” grant award 
opportunities near the end of the state or federal fiscal year (the state 
fiscal year usually ends June 30 and the federal September 30). At this 
time, leftover monies are quickly dispensed before they have to be 
returned to the state legislature or to Congress.
 
✓ Don’t scream at or threaten elected officials. You really need their influ-
ence to help you get your grant funded — if not this time, the next time 
it’s submitted for funding consideration.
 
✓ Don’t overlook elected officials when you convene the debriefing meet-
ing (covered in the section “Debriefing and Sharing with Your Lead 
Partners”).
 
✓ Don’t count on always getting your grant funded just because you ask 
your elected officials to get involved in the tracking process.
You’re funded!
At the state level, you receive a funding award letter when your project is 
selected for funding. Monies are transferred electronically into your organiza-
tion’s bank account. Some monies are awarded and transferred in advance; 
other monies are released on a reimbursement basis.

272
Part V: Reaching the Finish Line 
At the federal level, you receive a telephone call from one of your elected 
officials in Washington. He or she notifies you of your funding award and 
issues the official press release to your local newspaper. Shortly after that, 
you receive a call or an e-mail from the Office of Management and Budget, 
known as the OMB. The OMB calls to negotiate the grant award, and yes, 
that means it may not offer you the full amount you requested. If you agree 
to a lesser amount, you need to rewrite your goals, objectives, and timelines 
to match the reduced funding. (Chapter 15 gives details on goals, objectives, 
and timelines.)
Here’s my logic: If you’re going to receive fewer grant monies, your promised 
program design (goals, objectives, and timelines) shouldn’t remain at the 
same level where you expected full funding. Reduce your promises by serv-
ing fewer members of the target population. Decrease your SMART objectives 
to take the heat off of having to hit 80 percent or higher. Do less with less — 
that’s the rule!
You’re not funded!
At both the state and federal levels, you receive a rejection letter when your 
project is denied funding. No call, no advance warning. Just a cold, very dis-
appointing rejection letter or e-mail.
 
If you’re not funded, request a copy of the grant reviewers’ comments using 
the language of the Freedom of Information Act. Contact your elected officials 
for assistance in getting a face-to-face meeting with funding agency person-
nel. And check out Chapter 20 for more on what to do after losing your grant 
request.
 
You can find information about the Freedom of Information Act as well as a 
sample letter requesting documents at this Web site: www.tncrimlaw.com/
foia_indx.html.
Understanding the follow-up process for 
foundation and corporate grant requests
Some foundation and corporate funders use their Web sites to post infor-
mation on procedures for grant proposal awards and declines. If you can’t 
locate the funder’s guidelines, it’s okay to call the funder for more informa-
tion on your funding application’s status. However, wait at least six to nine 
months after your submission date to make this call.

273
 Chapter 19: Managing Follow-Up Tasks
These funders want you to be involved in the process that eventually leads to 
either your success or your failure. Communicating with funders is the key to 
getting your project or program funded, if not the first time, the second time!
You can expect foundation and corporate funders to notify you that
 
✓ The status of your request is pending
 
✓ Your request has been rejected for funding
 
✓ Your request has been awarded funding
Round one: Determining whether your request is under review
The most desirable and immediate communication from a funder tells you 
that your funding request has been received and is under review. You’re 
likely to receive this communication by e-mail or postcard. For example, you 
might receive something that sounds like this:
We recently received your request for funding. Our Board of Trustees meets 
four times per year. Our next meeting for your area is scheduled for June. If 
we need additional information, someone from our office will contact you 
via e-mail or telephone. Once we have had the opportunity to fully review 
your proposal, you will be advised of the Board’s decision. Sincerely. . . 
A response such as this means you’re still in the running for the money. Don’t 
call this funder!
The least desired immediate communication from a funder tells you that your 
grant application was received and that the funder isn’t considering it for a 
grant or other type of funding award. This communication could also be sent 
via e-mail or postcard. Here’s an example:
Your recently submitted grant proposal was reviewed by our program staff 
and then forwarded to our Board of Directors. The Board met on August 
4 and reviewed over 50 grant proposals seeking Foundation funding. 
Regretfully, your grant proposal was not selected by the Board for fund-
ing consideration. There was nothing wrong or weak in your proposal; 
there simply was not enough money to fund every “great” funding request. 
Sincerely. . . 
 
Sometimes, a rejection letter such as the previous one comes with a further 
stipulation that you not submit another grant request for at least one year. 
Most rejection letters are sent to you within 90 days of the funder’s receipt of 
your grant request.

274
Part V: Reaching the Finish Line 
Round two: Finding out whether you’re funded
After your first positive communication from the funder indicating that your 
request is under review, expect a letter within several months (some come in 
90 days; other funders can take up to 18 months) that tells you the outcome 
of the funder’s review. The most desired letter from a funder includes infor-
mation on the amount of your funding award and how to begin the process of 
transferring funds. Consider this example:
The Board of Directors for the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s 
Research met on August 4 to review your grant proposal. I’m pleased to 
notify you that the Foundation is awarding $150,000 for your Stem Cell 
Research Project. We ask that the money be spent exclusively to ensure that 
the goals and objectives of your project will be achieved. The grant will be 
paid to you in one payment, and processing will begin as soon as the grant 
agreement is signed and returned to us. On behalf of the Foundation, I wish 
you every success. Sincerely. . .
 
Some foundation and corporate funders, as well as state and federal funders, 
require that grant agreements (contracts signed by the grantee and the 
grantor, indicating that you’ll spend the money as promised in your funding 
request) be in place before the check is put in the mail. This is standard pro-
cedure. However, always have your legal department or attorney examine the 
language before you sign on the dotted line. Failing to sign a grant agreement 
means no grant. Call the funder if you have questions.
The least desired letter, however, is a rejection letter stating that you won’t 
be awarded any funding. The previous section shows an example of a typi-
cal rejection letter. Read on to find out how to proceed once you’ve been 
rejected.
Round three: Following up after a rejection
When your project is denied funding by a foundation or corporate funder, 
your options for what to do next are similar to your options when dealing 
with a state or federal funding agency (see “You’re not funded!” earlier in this 
chapter).
First call each funder to determine why your grant proposal was rejected. 
Then ask for face-to-face meetings with all funders located within driving 
distance. It doesn’t matter whether you submitted your grant proposal to a 
corporate giving office, a local foundation, or a state agency.
 
How can you correct narrative weaknesses based on the feedback from a 
standard form rejection letter, or worse yet, a standard form rejection e-mail 
or postcard? When you consider the time spent researching and writing your 
grant proposal, you owe it to yourself to find out why you failed. I used to 
advise grant writers not to contact the funders because they’re too busy. But 
times have changed; the grant writer’s efforts aren’t to be dismissed lightly 
when a funder issues a rejection letter.

275
 Chapter 19: Managing Follow-Up Tasks
If funders are located too far away to schedule face-to-face meetings, call and 
ask for the best time to discuss the weaknesses in your funding request with 
a program officer. Tell whomever you speak with that you spent dozens of 
hours researching the funder, looking at previous grantees, and reviewing 
the funder’s grant application guidelines. Go on to say that you’re perplexed 
as to why your grant proposal was not selected for funding. Be humble, hurt, 
and open for suggestions. Okay, grovel!
 
At no time should you become argumentative with a foundation or corpo-
rate funder about your grant proposal’s rejection. After all, you may want to 
submit another grant proposal to the funder in the future.
Discovering the contract bid 
follow-up process
When you fill out and submit a contract bidding document (an RFP, or 
Request For Proposal), you don’t receive any notification from the bid-letting 
agency that your bid was received. You also don’t receive any information 
about the agency’s internal review process or decision-making time frame. 
The only communication you can expect to receive is notification if your 
company makes it to the final stages of contract bid acceptance. If this is the 
case, you receive written notice that’s likely to be followed by a telephone 
call to set up a meeting time.
If your company is one of the finalists in the contract bidding process, you’re 
asked to attend, in person, a Best and Final Offer meeting. This invitation 
means your company’s bid is very close to receiving a contract award. The 
bid-letting agency notifies you of the meeting in writing and poses questions 
about your bidding document’s narrative or costs. Usually you’re asked to 
provide greater detail on some of the sections in your bid narrative, such as 
the scope of service or cost proposal.
When you’re ready to resubmit the updated narrative, the bid-letting agency 
meets with you, face to face in the Best and Final Offer meeting. This is your 
company’s opportunity to present its best and final offer to the bid-letting 
agency. The agency contact will tell you whether they want this new and 
improved document before the meeting or whether you should bring it with 
you to the meeting.
 
Only a few contract bidding finalists are asked to sit down in a Best and Final 
Offer meeting. In order to beat your competition, give the bid-letting agency 
100 percent of the additional information needed in writing (page numbers no 
longer count!). Add new graphics and update your demographics, if needed. 
Dress up as you would for a job interview. In all reality, you’re going for a pre-
contract-award interview, so show the agency you mean business!

276
Part V: Reaching the Finish Line 
The waiting is the hardest part
How much patience do you need to have when 
you’re waiting for communication from a fund-
ing source? It depends on the funding source:
 ✓ Federal: Expect to wait three to six months 
from the date you mailed the request. The 
length of time between the time you mailed 
or electronically submitted the grant appli-
cation and the time the decision is made 
varies from agency to agency.
 ✓ State: Expect to wait up to six months 
from the date the request was mailed or 
submitted electronically. State agencies 
have rather quick turnarounds on decision 
making.
 ✓ Foundation: Expect to wait up to 12 months 
from the date the request was mailed or 
submitted electronically.
 ✓ Corporate: Expect to wait up to six months 
from the date the request was mailed or 
submitted electronically. Of all funding 
sources, corporate funders are the most 
likely to fail to notify you when your grant 
request is rejected. Eighty percent of the 
time, communication from a corporate 
funder means you have a check in the 
mail.

A
fter you know the status of your grant with a funding source, you need 
to attend to some tasks in order to wrap up loose ends. All too often, 
the grant writer drops the ball after finding out that a request for funding has 
been rejected. The inclination is to retreat, nurse some wounds, and wait 
until next year. And when grant writers find out that their requests have been 
funded, they tend to want to celebrate and bask in the light of success. But in 
both situations, there’s more to it than that. Whether you get the bear or the 
bear gets you, you still have work to do. This chapter guides you through the 
actions you should take — win or lose.
The Check’s in the Mail (or Bank): 
Dealing with the Post-Award Process
 
When the word finally reaches you that your grant proposal has been selected 
for funding, celebrate! But then get ready to hunker down and begin the post-
award process. During this process, you must follow some steps, which are 
shown in the following list. These steps secure your role as the grant or con-
tract recipient. (Don’t worry if some terms throw you for a loop; I provide defi-
nitions in the section “Translating post-award lingo.”)

278
Part V: Reaching the Finish Line 
 
1. Notify all your administrators, including the chief financial officer 
(CFO), of the award.
 
2. Add the item “Accept grant or contract funds” to the agenda of your 
board of directors’ next meeting.
 
3. Prepare an overview of the grant request or contract bidding docu-
ment for board review prior to the meeting.
 
 In the overview, include the purpose, objectives, timelines for program 
implementation, project budget, and a copy of the official award letter 
from the funding source.
 
4. Prepare a brief oral presentation to give to the board and draft resolu-
tion language.
 
 The resolution will be to accept the grant or contract award.
 
5. If grant agreements or contract forms need to be signed, have these 
documents ready for the board.
 
6. Prepare a press release (providing the funder doesn’t want anonym-
ity) for board approval.
 
 Contract awards are public knowledge, so you don’t need permission 
from the bid-letting agency to issue a press release.
 
7. Create or purchase a certificate of appreciation for foundation and 
corporate funders, and get it signed by your board officers.
 
 This step isn’t necessary if you’re dealing with government agencies or 
bid-letting agencies.
 
8. Meet with the CFO to discuss fiscal accountability, including creating 
a clear or single audit trail.
Translating post-award lingo
In case you aren’t familiar with some of the terms used in the preceding 
steps, this section gives you some shortcut definitions for terms you hear 
when your organization has been notified of a grant award or successful con-
tract bid.
The chief financial officer (CFO) is the person who makes the financial deci-
sions for your organization. In smaller organizations, the CFO may be a book-
keeper working in concert with an executive director. In larger organizations, 
entire departments may handle the finances, including fiscal reporting.

279
 Chapter 20: Celebrating or Commiserating: Do It the Right Way
Any agency with a board of directors or trustees or any government agency 
with a decision-making body (such as a city council, town board, or county 
board of supervisors) needs a resolution to apply for and accept grant funds 
after an official letter has been received announcing a forthcoming award. 
Even if the funding source includes a check with the award announcement 
letter (foundations and corporations occasionally do so), you need a formal 
resolution before you deposit the check.
The resolution should include the name of the grantee (agency receiving 
the grant funds), the name of the funding agency, the amount of the funding 
awarded, and the intended use of the funding. Here’s an example:
The Louisville Children’s Museum, operated by the City of Louisville, 
hereby resolves to accept $200,000 from the National Endowment for the 
Humanities for the Cultural Capacity Building Project. These funds shall 
be used exclusively for this project. Any unexpended grant monies will be 
reported and returned to the grantor as required by federal legislation.
Approved unanimously by the Louisville Children’s Museum Board 
of Directors on 1/4/2009 and by the City of Louisville City Council on 
1/4/2009.
Signed by Mary Moffett, CFO, Louisville Children’s Museum, and by Bill 
Climber, City Clerk, City of Louisville
 
Send the original resolution to the funding source; the funder needs to see the 
original signature. Keep a copy for your own files.
Fiscal accountability is the obligation to ensure that the funds granted are 
used correctly. Fiscal accountability lies with the organization or company 
responsible for the management of grant or contract funds. In most cases, 
this is the grant applicant or contract offeror. In some instances, it’s the fiscal 
sponsor. (Chapter 17 explores what it means to be a fiscal sponsor for a non-
profit organization.)
A clear or single audit trail is an arrangement that allows any auditor, whether 
internal or from the funding source, to track the grant monies from the 
money in stage to the money out stage without finding that grant funds have 
been commingled with any other organizational funds.
 
Any grant funds received should be deposited into a separate account and 
tracked individually by using accounting practices that enable tracking by 
date, by expenditure, and by line item allocation against the approved project 
budget (the budget approved by the funding source).

280
Part V: Reaching the Finish Line 
Referring to post-award 
guidelines for help
In federal grants, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) works 
cooperatively with funding agencies to establish government-wide grants-
management policies and guidelines. These guidelines are published in 
circulars and common rules. At the federal level, these documents are first 
introduced in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA). New circu-
lars and common rules are published in the Federal Register.
 
On the federal OMB Web site, www.whitehouse.gov/OMB/grants/index.
html, you can find out more about the OMB and explore the circulars. 
(Chapter 4 introduces the CFDA and Federal Register.)
Table 20-1 lists the different federal grants-management OMB circulars. The

 Chapter 20: Celebrating or Commiserating: Do It the Right Way
At the state funding level, the funding agency provides you with the funding 
stipulations, including the regulations for accessing, spending, reporting, and 
closing out grant funds.
Foundation and corporate funders give you their funding stipulations and/
or regulations, if any, when the funds are awarded. Other than asking you 
to sign a grant agreement (a contract indicating that you’ll use the awarded 
funds as promised in your grant application), most private-sector funders 
don’t have a ton of regulations.
Getting More Than You 
Asked For From Funders
Suppose you’ve applied for grants with ten funding sources. One of the ten 
funding sources funds you in full. The money has been deposited, and your 
project is up and running. But more mail comes in, and guess what? Your 
project has received four more grants, totaling an amount equal to the full 
funding request. You must have written one fabulous narrative!
If your project is overfunded, here’s what to do:
 
✓ Immediately contact each funder and explain your predicament.
 
✓ Ask the funder’s permission to keep the funds and expand your project’s 
design.
 
✓ Ask the funder’s permission to carry grant monies over into another 
fiscal year.
The worst-case scenario is that all funding sources except for the first funder 
ask you to return the additional funding. The best-case scenario is that you’re 
allowed to keep the funding and create a bigger and better project or program.
 
The best way to avoid the predicament of having too much money is to write a 
letter to each outstanding funding source (sources who haven’t communicated 
with you on their decisions to fund your grant requests) immediately after 
you know that you’ve reached full funding with the first funder or first group 
of funders. Be honest and quick. It’s the right and ethical thing to do — even 
though having too much money sounds like a good thing. (Chapter 17 talks 
more about the ethical approach to grant seeking.)

282
Part V: Reaching the Finish Line 
Being Protected by the Freedom 
of Information Act
 
If your grant application was rejected by a state or federal funding agency, 
you’re entitled to review the grant reviewer’s comments under the Freedom 
of Information Act (FOIA). Unfortunately, if you’re rejected by a foundation 
or corporate giving entity, you probably won’t receive any reviewer’s com-
ments, and you can’t use the FOIA as your trump card to get them. (Chapter 
19 covers the type of communication you can expect from a foundation or cor-
poration when you aren’t funded.)
If you receive a rejection notice from a state or federal funding agency, you 
need to write a letter requesting the peer reviewers’ comments (there are 
usually three peer reviewers per one federal grant application). When you 
use the FOIA, you receive the federal peer reviewers’ actual written com-
ments and scores (the points they bestowed on each narrative section in 
your grant application). For more information on the federal peer review pro-
cess, turn to Chapter 10.
 
In order to invoke the FOIA, your letter should include the following informa-
tion, at a minimum, to assist the funding agency in locating your requested 
documents:
 
✓ The name of the federal funding agency from which you’re seeking the 
information must be in the address of the letter.
 
✓ The application identification code (at the federal level, the Application 
Control Center assigns an identifying number to your incoming grant 
application) must be included. You receive this number after uploading 
your grant application via the Grants.gov e-grant system online.
On the envelope and at the top of your FOIA letter, write “Freedom of 
Information Act Request.” Keep a copy of your request; you may need it in 
the event of an appeal or if your original request isn’t answered. Federal 
agencies are required to answer your request for information within ten 
working days of receipt. If you don’t receive a reply by the end of that time 
frame (be sure to allow for mailing time), you may write a follow-up letter or 
call the agency to ask about the delay. Other government agencies have their 
own set time frames for replies. Calling and asking before writing your letter 
is the best way to find out how long you should wait for a reply.

283
 Chapter 20: Celebrating or Commiserating: Do It the Right Way
Oh No! Picking Up the Pieces 
and Starting Over
Failed efforts in the grant writing field are upsetting, but remember that they 
don’t signal the end of your grant writing career. After all, just because a 
grant proposal isn’t funded doesn’t mean that it doesn’t have some salvage-
able parts. It’s time to look at why it failed, and then plan the fix-up!
Transforming failed federal 
or state grant applications
When you receive a rejection from a federal or state funder, order the peer 
review comments you’re due thanks to the Freedom of Information Act (see 
the previous section). Use the comments to find out what your peers found 
wrong with the narrative sections of the grant application. Fix the weak-
nesses, and if parts of your sections were confusing or incomplete, rewrite 
them. If others helped you put the application narrative together, now’s the 
time to reconvene the grant writing team.
If you’re stuck holding a failed grant request, why are you doing all this work? 
Here’s why:
 
✓ To get the grant ready for resubmission to the same federal or state 
grant competition when it cycles again, which is usually once per federal 
or state fiscal year
 
✓ To make sure you have a great working document for cutting, pasting, 
and reworking into state, foundation, and corporate grant application 
formats
However, face the facts. You went to the feds or the state government 
because you needed mega monies for your project. No other single fund-
ing source can fill the gap that would have been filled with a federal or state 
grant award. So, if you requested $400,000 from the feds or a state agency, 
you need to scale down your project design and project budget when you 
take your request to other funding sources; your adjustments should be 
based on each funding source’s limitations, which you uncover through 
research. Identify any possible government monies (federal and state), and 
then look for foundation and corporate funding opportunities to augment 
your government prospects.

284
Part V: Reaching the Finish Line 
In Chapter 4, I tell you how to find state- and federal-level grant opportunities. 
Chapter 6 covers how to find out about foundation and corporate funding 
sources.
Reworking failed foundation 
or corporate funding requests
 
Never, ever throw a rejected foundation or corporate grant request into your 
files, walk away, and give up. Instead,
 
✓ Go back and do another funding search to identify a new list of foun-
dation and corporate funders that you can approach with your grant 
request (see Chapter 6 for more about private-sector funds).
 
✓ Convene your stakeholders’ planning team to discuss the failed attempt 
with the first funder or funders. Sometimes, other people in the com-
munity have funding leads to share with you. After all, they want to see 
your project be funded as much as you do.
 
✓ Beef up your original foundation or corporate proposal to meet the 
requirements of state or federal funding opportunities. This means writ-
ing more narrative and adding more research to support your needs 
statement. You also need a new project budget based on federal or state 
funding limitations.
Modifying failed contract bids
When you lose a contract bidding opportunity, call the bid-letting agency and 
find out:
 
✓ Who received the contract award: Find out if the bid-letting agency 
awarded the contract to one of your competitors or to a new player in 
your business’s service or product area. You may even consider calling 
the winner of the contract bid to see whether there’s an opportunity to 
subcontract for some of the contracted work or products. If you lose a 
contract bid award, focus on making the best of a negative situation.
 
✓ Why your contract bid was rejected: This feedback helps you in future 
contract bids. Your bid may have been too high (money is a prominent 
deciding factor in contract bid awards). Or your bid may have been 
incomplete. (Failing to fill in all forms and sign on the dotted line a hun-
dred times can result in failing to have your contract bid reviewed.) Take 
as much as you can from the rejection so you can improve your bid and 
increase your chances of receiving an award the next time around.

285
 Chapter 20: Celebrating or Commiserating: Do It the Right Way
 
Before you look for and submit any more contract bids — to any agency — 
stop and fix your weaknesses (in pricing, language, and whatever else needs 
improvement). Also, note that not all bid-letting agencies will give you feed-
back. You must be persistent in finding out why you weren’t selected for the 
bid award. It’s impossible to ever win a bid if you don’t know where you failed!
Sharpening Your Grant Writing Skills 
by Becoming a Peer Reviewer
How can you reduce the number of grant rejection notices you receive? How 
can you feel better about the entire grant writing process? You can do all this 
and more by signing up to become a peer reviewer for the federal govern-
ment. That’s right, you can actually participate in the reading and rating (the 
duties peer reviewers are paid to do by federal funding agencies) of someone 
else’s grant application.
 
Most state-level government grant making agencies don’t pay peer reviewers’ 
travel-related expenses or pay for time spent at the state capital reading gobs 
of grant applications. However, federal government agencies have budget line 
items to compensate peer reviewers.
Peer reviewers read, analyze, and rate grant proposals. Individuals selected 
for peer review must possess work experience and/or educational creden-
tials in the area of the grant funding. You have to convince the funding 
agency that you know the field well enough to read a grant application and 
understand everything the grant applicant has written, from jargon to field-
based research models. Also, you should be comfortable with reading a large 
volume of material in a short period of time (paper copies and electronic 
files).
To find open peer reviewer positions, type the phrase “call for peer reviewer” 
into your favorite Internet search engine Your search will produce all 
announcements containing that phrase. When you locate a position you want 
to apply for, you need to have an updated résumé (with work experience and 
education-related achievements) ready to e-mail or enter into an online peer 
review application or survey.
 
You can submit your résumé and peer review application to as many federal 
agencies that you find call for peer reviewer announcements for; however, you 
may find that, for scheduling reasons, you can’t participate in or attend all 
peer review opportunities.

286
Part V: Reaching the Finish Line 
When you’re accepted as a peer reviewer on a particular funding competi-
tion, you receive an orientation packet with information on the peer review 
process, review deadlines, and the process for submitting your completed 
reviews either electronically or via express mail. As a peer reviewer, you’re 
required to submit a clear and thorough analysis of each application you 
read. You also must include a rating for each. When you’ve completed your 
individual peer review of the assigned grant applications, you write individual 
reviewer work sheets for each proposal and then discuss your findings with 
other peer reviewers who have read the same set of grant applications.
Based on the availability of federal funding for the peer review process, you 
may work
 
✓ From your home or office.
 
✓ During a funding agency–arranged teleconference in which you’re able 
to communicate with your team.
 
✓ At a three- to five-day meeting in Washington, D.C. in which you attend 
a live orientation session and meet face to face with your peer review 
panel members.
When you reach the panel consensus stage of the peer review process, 
you’re required to come to consensus on the quality of the applications — 
with alternating panel reviewers preparing final review forms that reflect the 
group’s decision.

W
hen your organization is in need of donated goods or services, you 
don’t always have to write a full grant application. There are easier 
ways of obtaining cash, supplies, materials, equipment, videos, technical 
assistance, and more. Simply use my world-famous and proven corporate 
letter request. I have received hundreds of e-mails from organizations that 
have used my well-publicized corporate letter request format. They have 
overwhelmingly confirmed that the corporate letter request can be used to 
raise hundreds of thousands of dollars from businesses, small foundations, 
and individual donors! In this chapter, I walk you through the quick and easy 
steps of using my corporate letter request format.
Getting a Refresher on What 
You Can Ask For
By now your enthusiasm is building — perhaps so much so that you’ve for-
gotten what exactly your organization needs. Here are some reminders of 
what the corporate letter request can be used to obtain:
 
✓ Equipment: Copy machines, computers, fax machines, printers, all-in-one 
machines, assistive devices for hearing- and visually impaired persons, 
new or used vehicles, appliances, audio visual items, or other new and 
used capital equipment items.

288
Part V: Reaching the Finish Line 
 
✓ Materials: Training videos, curriculum packages, and project-related 
materials (such as canvas, easels, and so on).
 
✓ Supplies: Copy paper, printer or copy cartridges, standard office sup-
plies, or special project supplies. These supplies may include ink pens, 
paper clips, computer software, or other age-specific or target group–
specific supplies.
 
✓ Professional services: A trainer for your board of directors, an accountant 
to prepare your organization’s annual audit statement, someone to evaluate 
your funded project, and more.
A corporate letter request can also result in cash contributions, just as if 
you’d received an actual grant award, to meet the following financial needs:
 
✓ Monies to start a building fund
 
✓ Monies to start an endowment fund
 
✓ Monies to support general operating expenses
 
✓ Monies to attend a professional conference or training program
 
✓ Monies for education scholarships
 
✓ Monies to support project or program needs not covered by your 
existing grant award
Knowing Your Funding Target
Writing an effective corporate letter request requires you to do some home-
work. Be sure to take these steps before putting pen to paper — or, more 
accurately, before putting your fingers to the keyboard:
 
✓ Research the companies that manufacture the items you need. Try 
using Hoover’s Web site (www.hoovers.com) to find some good leads 
on corporations that make what you need. Hoover’s is a great online 
resource because, for a monthly subscription fee, you can retrieve an 
overview of your target company that includes its history; recent news 
articles; and a list of officers, locations, subsidiaries (look for sites 
within a 100-mile radius of your project’s location), competitors (other 
names to look up on Hoover’s), and financials.
 
 Even if you don’t subscribe to the Hoover’s service, you can still get 
free access to its basic corporate information, such as the name of the 
company, its location, a list of its products or services, limited financial 
information, and officers’ names.

289
 Chapter 21: Crafting the Corporate Letter Request
 
 Financial information gives you an idea of the company’s ability (and 
therefore its potential willingness) to make a donation. Look for a 
healthy profit line in the company’s most recent fiscal year.
 
✓ Research the corporations that provide technical assistance. To find 
such corporations, go to the Foundation Center’s home page (www.
foundationcenter.org) and click on the Find Funders link at the top 
of the page. Then click on Corporate Giving Online. You need to subscribe 
to Corporate Giving Online in order to access the Center’s massive search-
able database. Subscriptions for individual users are $59.95 monthly. 
When you start your search for corporate funders, first read the Center’s 
detailed profile. Then click through on the funder’s Web site link to read 
more specifics, such as Community Involvement, Social Responsibility, 
or Corporate Giving Guidelines. These are the Web pages that lead you to 
information on the corporation’s technical-assistance offerings.
 
✓ Get vendor specifications on any needed equipment, materials, or 
supplies. For example, if you’re seeking to purchase six laptop comput-
ers, print out the technical specifications to show potential funders the 
hard drive memory capacity, software included, and equipment main-
tenance warranties. Most vendors will have specification sheets with 
photos and details of the equipment that their company sells.
 
✓ Find out the name of the company official to whom you need to write. 
For larger corporations, I always write to the CEO. If I’m approaching 
a small business, I write to the owner. Even if the person you write to 
doesn’t handle the actual request, he or she will pass it down to the 
administrator who does. Always start at the top!
 
Make sure to only approach corporations that have headquarters or operat-
ing locations in or within 100 miles of your community. Approaching more 
than one corporation for the same item is okay, because not everyone says 
yes. (If they do, celebrate and plan bigger and better for next time.) If you 
wind up with more goods than you need, call the donating corporation and 
ask whether you can give the extra items to another nonprofit organization.
Before you dig into your writing, make sure that you receive approval from 
your board of directors to proceed with letter solicitations. To involve the 
directors even more in the process, give them your list of targeted recipients 
so they can call anyone they know personally to expedite the requests.
Using the Corporate Letter Format
First and foremost, keep this letter to two pages maximum, not including your 
attached supporting documentation. Corporations don’t have the time to read 
cumbersome or lengthy requests. In my two decades of grant and request writ-
ing, I’ve found that two pages is a perfect length for the writer and the reader.

290
Part V: Reaching the Finish Line 
Make sure that you use your organization’s letterhead and that your letter-
head includes your organization’s name, address, voicemail and fax numbers, 
e-mail address, and Web site address. If it doesn’t, add this information to the 
end of your letter.
The following steps explain how to construct your letter and what it should 
contain:
 
1. Record the date.
 
 Use the current date if you’re mailing the letter immediately; otherwise, 
postdate your letter to match the actual mailing date. If you stagger the 
mailing for multiple letters, be sure to change the date on each letter 
before mailing them.
 
2. Write the opening address for the letter’s recipient, including his or 
her name, job title, the company’s name, and the complete mailing 
address.
 
 Be sure to use the correct personal title (Ms., Mr., Messrs., or the 
Honorable). Call or e-mail the targeted recipient to double-check the 
gender of the contact person, his or her job title, and the company’s cur-
rent mailing address.
 
3. Use a professional salutation before the recipient’s personal title and 
surname.
 
 I use the word Dear. Only use the recipient’s first name if you know him 
or her personally. Because this is a business letter, follow the salutation 
with a colon, not a comma.
 
4. Start your letter with three bulleted introductory sentences.
 
 One approach to these initial bullets is opening with accurate, startling 
facts about your target population or the beneficiaries of the goods or 
services you’re requesting. (See Chapter 14 for info on how to research 
target populations.) Another approach is to try stirring the memory of 
the reader and quickly connecting him or her to a past event that he 
or she experienced personally, or that close family members or friends 
experienced. Make sure that the memory-jogger starts out sad but ends 
happily (see my example in Figure 21-1 for this type of corporate letter 
request opening).
 
5. Introduce your nonprofit organization in the first few sentences.
 
 You don’t have to repeat your organization’s name or location because 
that info is on your letterhead. However, you do need to share your 
organization’s structure (nonprofit, membership association, or private 
operating foundation) and who you serve. Provide enough detail on your 

291
 Chapter 21: Crafting the Corporate Letter Request
organization to put the recipient at ease about giving to your agency for 
the first time. Flip to Chapter 13 for suggestions on how to profile your 
organization for a funder or donor.
 
6. State your problem in the next few sentences.
 
 Tell the recipient what’s wrong at your organization that requires you 
to seek outside funding support, equipment, supplies, or consulting 
assistance. Give sufficient information on the problem to answer all the 
recipient’s questions about why assistance is needed. Turn to Chapter 
14 for more tips on writing a winning needs or problem statement.
 
7. In one sentence, ask for the money (specify the amount), services (list 
the services), or equipment (give the piece of equipment’s name — the 
one most commonly used by the company) that you need.
 
 Tell the recipient why you need the requested item(s). (Note that 
asking for money is very similar to drafting a purpose statement, so see 
Chapter 15 for advice on how to write one.)
 
8. In one to three sentences, explain the measurable objectives that will 
be achieved.
 
 This is your chance to show the recipient that you plan to take steps to 
show your organization lived up to its end of the donation. See Chapter 15 
for help with crafting futuristic goals and measurable outcome objectives.
 
9. In one or two sentences, tell the recipient why you chose his or 
her company or foundation and point to your knowledge of the 
recipient’s company.
 
 Use the Internet to do your homework on the recipient’s organization. 
First, read all the press releases on its Web site. Then, using a search 
engine, type in the company or foundation name to see what “outside” 
information surfaces. Look for the positives and share, in writing, your 
knowledge of any awards or accolades.
 
10. Tell the recipient that if his or her company or foundation helps your 
organization, the contribution will mean much more than the money, 
goods, services, or equipment donated.
 
 Stroke the recipient’s ego by explaining how a donation from his or her 
organization makes you partners in promoting community change.
 
11. Close your letter with a sentence that tells the recipient who to con-
tact with further questions and when you need to have the funds, 
goods, or services in place.
 
 Don’t forget to provide this deadline for the giver’s decision-making. 
Otherwise, you may receive a response to your request way after you 
could’ve actually used the donation.

292
Part V: Reaching the Finish Line 
 
12. Say goodbye.
 
 I usually use one of these terms: Sincerely, Hopefully, Awaiting Your 
Response, Praying for Support . . . you get the idea. Remember that you 
want a soft heart (with maybe a few tears) and a quick contribution of 
some sort!
 
13. Space down four lines and type the name and title of the administra-
tor authorized by your board of directors to sign legal documents.
 
 Although this letter isn’t a legal document, it is a formal request and 
should be signed by the individual authorized to sign other types of 
accountability documents for your organization. Make sure to give your 
letter, in draft form, to the official signatory for review and approval 
before showing up at his or her door with a finished letter.
 
14. If you’re attaching a budget, a catalog page showing the item you 
want to purchase, or other supporting documents, type the word 
Attachment after the administrator’s typed name and signature.
 
 I recommend including the following basic attachments to give your 
letter’s recipient an in-depth look at your organization’s internal compo-
nents and nonprofit status:
 
• A total project budget
 
• Your organization’s most recent financial statement
 
• A brochure listing your programs and activities
 
• Your IRS nonprofit letter
 
• A catalog page that features the item you’re requesting (if you’re 
requesting an item)
 
 Whatever you ask for and receive is a tax deduction for the contributor.
 
15. At the very end of your letter, add a handwritten postscript (P.S.) of 
no more than three sentences that appeals to the reader’s emotions.
 
 The handwritten postscript is your last chance to get the recipient 
to identify with your organization’s values. Recipients who can relate 
to your need because of personal experience will be the first ones to 
respond favorably to your request. The postscript is important because 
it takes the recipient from the typed wording in your letter directly to 
your handwriting. This level of personalization gives your letter the edge 
over any others the recipient may receive. (If you want to add some win-
ning words to your postscript so as to impart the importance of your 
request, flip to Chapter 11.)
If you’re planning to send letters to multiple recipients, you can create a 
template using your word-processing software and simply fill in the infor-
mation fields. Check out Figure 21-1 for a complete example of a corporate 
letter request.

Ms. Marcia T. Givens
Corporate Giving Officer
Commercial Ground Surface Equipment Corporation
7777 W. Lucky Business Avenue
Wonkaville, NY 17171-7777
Dear Ms. Givens:
 
•  100% of the 189 children enrolled in our after-school and summer programs live in  
 
     
    substandard single- and multiple-family housing with no grass, cracked sidewalks,  
 
     
    and mud holes for play areas.
 
•  In the past five years, 60 children in the community were gunshot victims of drive-by  
 
 
    shooters aiming at older siblings who are or were gang members.
 
•  The neighborhoods surrounding our community center are crime-infested; there are no 
 
    safe places for children to gather with their peers and play — no swing sets, no 
 
    sandboxes, no jungle gyms, nothing!
The Second Ward Community Center is located in Cupcake, Michigan. The Center was founded in 1995 by 
Sherman Mitchell, a local community artist and longtime advocate for young children. The Center’s mission 
is to provide a safe and nurturing environment to support the social, educational, and health needs of 
neighborhood youth. Over 200 volunteers and four full-time staff assist in the Center’s daily programs and 
activities. In 2009, the Center will continue to offer its award-winning model programs:
 
•  Time Out: An anger management and conflict resolution program to defuse neighborhood  
 
    youth of all ages. Over 40 youth are currently enrolled in this program; 20 have been  
 
 
    remanded to the program by Youth Court.
 
•  Read It!: An after-school and summer reading tutorial program for youth who have failed to  
 
    make a grade level promotion. Over 120 elementary school-age youth enrolled in the 2008  
 
    summer program, and 75 participate in the after-school program.
 
•  Midnight Basketball: A basketball league for older youth, ages 14 to 17, who were prone 
 
    to hanging out on the street corners and getting into serious trouble. Over 20 youth
 
    belong to the Center’s Midnight Basketball team.
According to the April 2001 issue of the American Journal of Public Health, children are 400% to 500% more 
likely to be physically active if they are afforded safe and attractive places to play. Children living in 
Cupcake’s Second Ward are seldom fed nutritional meals; they exist on high levels of starchy and fried 
foods. They cannot play safely outdoors where they live. The Center, which is surrounded by a 10-foot-tall 
fence, is the only safe nucleus for organized activities. We are open six days per week from 8 a.m. until 
after midnight to feed, clothe, educate, and shape the minds and bodies of children who have fallen 
through multiple social and human services gaps. Outsiders refer to children living in the second ward as 
throwaway kids.

294
Part V: Reaching the Finish Line 
  
As the Center’s Executive Director, I am writing to you to request ground surface preparation equipment 
manufactured and distributed by your company. The Center is located adjacent to vacant land that our 
board of directors would like to transform into a community playground. The equipment requested is 
needed to prepare the surface of a nearby vacant lot for a community Build It Now playground initiative, 
in which volunteers from throughout the community arrive early on a Saturday morning and erect an 
entire handicap-accessible playground in one day.
Your donation of the ground surface preparation equipment will help the Second Ward Community Center 
realize its goal to provide a safe and nurturing environment for neighborhood youth.
Your donation will enable the Second Ward Community Center to extend recreational activities to the 
new outdoor area, which in turn will help achieve the objective of increasing its summer recreation 
program enrollment by 25% or more in 2010 and beyond.
I selected your company over 20 other commercial ground surface equipment manufacturers. My 
extensive research on quality equipment showed that your 4567 Model has received the John Browning 
4000 ISO Award for three years in a row. I am impressed by this model’s durability, quality, and minimal 
maintenance requirements.
If your company is able to help our organization, The Commercial Ground Surface Equipment Corporation 
will have contributed more than ground surface preparation equipment. Your company will be a major 
partner in building the developmental assets for nearly 200 youth. From self-esteem to personal 
responsibility awareness to academic achievement, youth enjoying the playground and your products 
will be better prepared for surviving and thriving in times of turmoil.
In closing, please do not hesitate to contact me at 111-555-5555 with any questions about this request. 
The Center needs to have the playground ready for use by June 10, 2010.
With hope for your partnership,
  
Sister Joanne Goodfellow

Attachments (annual report, program brochure, and letter from the City of Cupcake)
P.S. As I was writing this letter to you to request playground surface preparation 
equipment, a neighborhood parent rushed in to ask me for help.  Her 7-year-old 
daughter was shot in the arm by a local gang looking for an older brother who did 
not show up for the gang’s initiation. The mother had no telephone to call for help. 
This family does not have a car, either. I was able to call 911 and send a volunteer 
crisis response team to the house immediately.  The Center has so far to go, yet so 
little to get there with. . . the new playground is critically needed.
 
When a board member personally knows the recipient of a letter, give the fin-
ished letter to that board member and ask him or her to cross out the typed 
salutation and write in the recipient’s first name. For example, in “Dear Dr. 
Browning:” you can cross out “Dr. Browning” and replace it with “Bev.” Doing 
so shows Bev, the recipient, that someone at the requesting organization 
knows her personally. When you do this though, make sure the board member 
is the official signatory so Bev knows who’s calling her Bev!

295
 Chapter 21: Crafting the Corporate Letter Request
Following Up After You Mail the Letter
After you mail your letter requesting funds, goods, or services, wait 90 calen-
dar days and then call the individual to whom you addressed the letter. Ask 
the person whether he or she received your request and offer to answer any 
questions. This important courtesy can speed up the recipient’s decision to 
help your organization.
If a member of your board of directors handwrote the salutation and signed 
the letter (as suggested in the preceding section), then your board member 
needs to make the follow-up telephone call because he or she has a personal 
relationship with the recipient. This action can increase your chances of 
receiving what you ask for in your corporate letter request because one offi-
cer is now talking to another officer or chief administrator.
 
Always express gratitude for contributions at any level. Have your board write 
a letter of thanks to the donating foundation or corporation and ask someone 
at your organization to call the donor to invite representatives of his or her 
foundation or corporation to public events, grand openings, ribbon cuttings, 
and more. Essentially, invite the donor to witness, firsthand, the impact of his 
or her organization’s contribution on your group and on your target popula-
tion. Such actions show the donor that your organization really does want a 
long-term partnership, not just a donation.

The Part of Tens

In this part . . .
T
his grand finale part was written based on your many 
e-mails and telephone calls about what you want to 
see in this, the Part of Tens. I hope I haven’t disappointed 
you! In these chapters, I show you how to find hard-to-find 
information and peer review opportunities. By the end of 
this part, you’ll be an Internet detective, and you’ll know 
how to switch hats and read funding requests written by 
others (which will in turn allow you to apply your new 
knowledge to win more grant applications!). And don’t for-
get the appendix, which shows a complete example of a 
grant narrative.

Chapter 22
Ten Tips for Unearthing 
Hard-to-Find Information
In This Chapter
▶ Searching for citable data
▶ Making use of external resources
W
hen you put together your grant application narrative, you need to be 
able to incorporate current and relevant demographics (also known 
as statistics) into the section where you convey your organization’s hopeless 
situation. (I cover this section in detail in Chapter 14.) Knowing how to find 
the Web sites that house the info you so desperately need is the key to orga-
nizing your writing and presenting the gloom, doom, drama, and trauma of 
your organization’s particular situation.
Unfortunately, these statistics aren’t always easy to find when you need 
them. That’s why in this chapter I’m showing you where you can dig up hard-
to-find information — everything from risk indicators for your target popula-
tion and service area to internal data that’s chock-full of outcomes from your 
organization’s previous grant-funded programs and activities.
 
Not all the tips in this chapter will apply to your type of organization, so pick 
and choose the most applicable.
Locate the Labor Database
If you’re writing about employment trends, unemployment rates, or occu-
pational demand in your narrative, use the Internet to locate your state’s 
Department of Labor Web site. After you’ve found it, look for reports, pub-
lications, and research statistics related to your service areas. If you can’t 
readily locate this information, call your local employment services office 
and ask whether it has a recent labor market report that you can copy.

300
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
Try calling your local One-Stop Career Center (state-funded offices to help 
high-risk individuals obtain training and get jobs). If you don’t know the exact 
name this publicly funded employment and training service provider goes 
by in your area, visit servicelocator.org to find your nearest One-Stop 
Career Center. This service provider collects historical data on employment 
trends for a county or a series of adjacent counties (depending on its state-
designated service area).
Peruse Public Health Indicators
If you need statistics regarding incidences of death, pregnancy, HIV/AIDS, 
teen pregnancies, cancer, diabetes, or other diseases, use the Internet to 
locate the Web sites for your state and county public health departments. 
Usually both entities make recent public health indicators available for public 
access. Here are some of the types of reports that are available:
 
✓ Behavioral risk factor surveys
 
✓ Birth defects registries
 
✓ Child fatality reviews
 
✓ Community health profiles
 
✓ Communicable diseases data and epidemiology
 
✓ Cost reporting and discharge data
 
✓ Environmental health reports
 
✓ Infectious disease epidemiology and reports
 
✓ Other public health statistics and reportable disease statistics
 
Print out five years of data so you can build comparison tables in your grant 
application narrative. And always cite the source of your data.
Gather Education Data
If you’re writing a grant application to benefit your school, you need to 
gather education data on your district and state-level comparison data. Start 
by using the Internet to locate your state Department of Education’s Web 
site. Search for data on your school district or on an individual school in the 
district. Also, look for comparable state-level data so you can compare your 
own statistics with statewide statistics. Look for links to research, reports, 
or school report cards. The demographic reports on districts and individual 
schools are typically called school report cards. Most of these reports contain

301
 Chapter 22: Ten Tips for Unearthing Hard-to-Find Information
 
✓ Adequate yearly progress reports (which show students who perform 
above the average, at the average, and below the average)
 
✓ Current state and district enrollments
 
✓ Educational qualifications of all employed teachers
 
✓ Standardized testing results for mathematics, reading, and writing for 
each grade level you’re writing about in your grant application
 
If you require stats on the percent of residents who’ve graduated from high 
school and those who’ve dropped out of school, check out the U.S. Census 
Bureau’s Web site (www.census.gov).
Seek Out Updated Census Data
If you’re writing about your target population’s increasing or decreasing 
growth trends, the best source is the United States Census Bureau (www.
census.gov). I like to use QuickFacts, which is one of the Bureau’s data 
tools. Find it at quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/index.html. Here you 
can find state, county, and city-level trends for population, housing, income, 
poverty, and employment. You can easily find the following facts on the 
Bureau’s site:
 
✓ Population by race and age
 
✓ Number of foreign-born persons and limited English-language speakers
 
✓ Number of high school and college graduates
 
✓ Number of persons with disabilities
 
✓ Travel time to work
 
✓ Number of housing units
 
✓ Homeownership rates
 
✓ Median value of housing
 
✓ Per capita income
 
✓ Poverty rates
 
✓ Business and geographic quick facts
 
When you write about your organization’s specific service population’s demo-
graphics, always create a table so you can compare your stats to those for the 
state. Doing so shows your highs and lows in critical indicator areas.

Track Down the Community 
Needs Assessment
Lately, most types of funders (private and public sector) are asking for vali-
dation of your needs. The most frequently requested type of validation is 
results from a recent community needs assessment, which is a survey that’s 
taken from a representative percentage of a community’s general population. 
It shows a community’s risk factors as they relate to education, health, sub-
stance abuse, income, housing status, and more. The most recent community 
needs assessment for your area may be difficult to locate, but you can start 
by calling your local United Way.
 
This agency may not be physically located in your town, but even if it’s 
located in another area, it may still include your county and town in its service 
region. If you aren’t sure how to find your local United Way, visit www.live
united.org/myuw.
Large nonprofit organizations (such as the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, 
YMCAs, YWCAs, your county’s board of commissioners, or your city council) 
are additional sources for accessing community needs assessments. If you 
can’t obtain the most recent assessment from these groups, try talking to 
your public library’s reference librarian.
Obtain a Regional Environmental 
Scan Report
When you need to present a larger picture of the problems in your commu-
nity or county, it’s best to look for a recent environmental scan report. This is 
a thorough and frequently updated document that captures the demographic 
characteristics of a county or a local community. Environmental scans are 
done by county boards of commissioners, mayoral offices, large universities 
with research centers and healthcare providers, and other human and social 
services agencies. To track down any environmental scan reports that have 
been done in your area, type “Environmental Scan for [fill in your county’s 
name here] County” into an Internet search engine. If you can’t find an envi-
ronmental scan report this way, call your nearest university or even the 
United Way to locate a recent one. (For tips on finding your local United Way, 
see the preceding section.)

 Chapter 22: Ten Tips for Unearthing Hard-to-Find Information
Acquire Crime Statistics
When you’re writing intervention and prevention applications for high risk 
youth and adult populations, it’s important to incorporate the crime statis-
tics in your community. First, check out your state’s Department of Justice or 
Department of Criminal Justice Web site by looking for the governor’s Web 
page for your state. All state governors have Web sites with complete listings 
of the state’s agencies. Then look for a link to statistics, reports, or county-
level data. Or you can browse your State Police or state Department of Public 
Service’s Web site for critically needed and up-to-date statewide crime sta-
tistics. For more local info, turn to your local law enforcement agency’s Web 
site or give the agency a call directly.
 
If you’re pressed for time, search online for your regional newspaper’s 
archives. Newspapers often publish the latest crime statistics and cite the 
source of their data.
Determine Who’s Tracking Your 
Service Statistics and Trends
When you want to write about historical services numbers and show the 
number of males and females assisted by your organization, you need accu-
rate and reliable data. In some instances, your board of directors requests 
frequent reports from your executive director on the organization’s service 
statistics and demographic trends (such as average age, income, and educa-
tion level). Ask around your office to see who has this report or has access to 
the electronic files containing this type of information. If you’re having a dif-
ficult time finding this data, consider revising your organization’s evaluation 
data collection tools (presented in Chapter 15) to capture current and future 
statistics for grant writing purposes.
Retrieve Archived Data 
for Comparison Studies
If you’re trying to show that a problem has worsened, you can use target pop-
ulation comparison studies. These types of studies come in handy because 
they contrast one year to another year for the same target population. If 

304
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
you’re lucky, someone else has already done the study, and so you just need 
to search the Internet for a current study or an older one (which may be 
archived in the authoring agency’s Web site publications).
Your first stop when searching for this archived data should be your local or 
regional college or university library. Why? Often graduate students conduct 
extensive research on population groups and trends and publish their theses 
or dissertations (which are then available in the library). Another possible 
source for this info is your local community foundation.
Pin Down Previous Evaluation Reports
Previous evaluation reports created by your organization for past grant appli-
cations can be treasure troves of old statistics and program outcomes and 
outputs, so start scrounging around for them. The best places to begin are 
with your organization’s administrators and your board of directors. If you 
hit a road block looking for old evaluation reports, try to find old grant appli-
cations to see what was supposed to be evaluated and who was responsible 
for the evaluation process. Often you can glean more information on program 
outcomes from the evaluating agency (third-party contractor) or the previ-
ous staff person who was in charge. If this doesn’t work, try looking at com-
puter hard drives throughout the organization for any old evaluation reports 
or grant application files.

Chapter 23
Ten Ways to Secure Peer 
Review Opportunities
In This Chapter
▶ Tapping into government peer review networks at all levels
▶ Selling yourself to the folks who select peer reviewers
▶ Making connections with the people who make the decisions
A
 peer reviewer is an individual selected by a government grantmaking 
agency to read and score grant applications. Because a peer is some-
one who’s thought of as your equal, you couldn’t apply to become a peer 
reviewer for the Parent Resource Center grant competition, for example, 
unless you were either a parent educator or a parent with experience in deal-
ing with the K–12 public school system.
Working as a peer reviewer may or may not give you additional income, but it 
will definitely provide you with an inside peek at the peer review process — 
knowledge that can only further your own grant writing efforts. After you’ve 
assessed your skills, education, and experience, as well as which funding 
agencies may be interested in your résumé, you’ll be ready to check out these 
ten ways you can go about securing peer review opportunities.
Call Your Congressional Contacts
Your federally elected officials (and their staff) can give you the inside scoop 
on the federal grantmaking agencies looking for peer reviewers, so pick up 
your telephone and call your senator’s and representative’s Washington, 
D.C.–based staff to inquire about their insider knowledge. You may also want 
to e-mail your most recent résumé to your federal contacts to remind them 
of your education, expertise, and experience in fields that likely match grant 
funding areas.

306
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Get in Touch with Federal Grantmakers
Public servants are available free of charge. Don’t feel like you’re bothering a 
federal program officer, or any other agency staff person, when you pick up 
the phone and call to inquire about how you can apply for and qualify as a 
peer reviewer for grant applications. One of the best ways to obtain the tele-
phone numbers for federal grantmaking agencies is to look each agency up 
on www.usa.gov, the U.S. government’s official Web portal.
 
The federal government pays its peer reviewers anywhere from $100 to $300 
a day. It also takes care of your air fare, hotel arrangements, and meal reim-
bursements. Or you might receive a per diem.
Contact State Grantmaking Agencies
Like federal grantmakers (mentioned in the preceding section), state grant 
program staff are public servants who should be ready and willing to answer 
your questions about becoming a peer reviewer for state agency grants. Call 
everyone you can and take notes on who you spoke with, the date of the con-
versation, and the results of your inquiry. If you hit a dead end, call the gov-
ernor’s office for assistance. Ask if the office has a Web site link to connect 
with all the state’s grantmaking agencies without doing a site by site check.
 
Most state grantmaking agencies are strapped for cash and probably won’t 
pay you for participating in the peer review process. You’ll also have to foot 
the bill for gasoline, a hotel the night before (if you live a long ways from your 
state capitol), and your own meals.
Reach Out to Your Municipal 
Grantmakers
When it comes to pursuing peer review opportunities at city grantmaking 
agencies, start at the top by contacting the mayor’s or county commission-
er’s office. Find out the names and contact information for departments with 
public grantmaking staffs. Most municipalities have Community Development 
Block Grant funds that they regrant. (These funds are publically earmarked 
for economic development projects that benefit low income populations.) 

307
 Chapter 23: Ten Ways to Secure Peer Review Opportunities
Some municipalities have neighborhood development programs that award 
grants to neighborhood block clubs, and others give out cash through their 
community funds.
 
Clearly, lots of peer review opportunities are available in local units of munici-
pal government. To stake a claim on one of them, offer to help wade through 
the masses of incoming grant applications, even if your city has no funds to 
pay you for your assistance.
Polish Your Résumé with 
the Right Credentials
Freshen up your résumé by using to your advantage the descriptors found in 
grantmaking agencies’ peer reviewer requests. Here’s an example of a typical 
call for a peer reviewer:
Mentoring Program of the Drug Free and Safe Schools Office — Areas 
of Expertise Required: mentoring of children, design, safeguards, and admin-
istration of mentoring programs for children.
To have a better shot at securing this peer review opportunity, you’d want 
to incorporate the terms listed under “Areas of Expertise Required” when 
updating your résumé.
E-mail Your Credentials 
to Key Contacts Monthly
Don’t be afraid to contact the folks who select peer reviewers. In fact, you 
should contact them on a monthly basis, at minimum. Be tenacious, and be 
sure to have an updated résumé with your professional credentials for all 
agencies to review and keep.
 
If at any time, an agency staff person seems irritated at your aggressive 
approach to be included in the peer review process, back off and try another 
agency. Wait at least three months before approaching the “tired of hearing 
from you” agency contact again. After all, you aren’t the only expert or layper-
son seeking to land a peer review gig — especially one that pays you for your 
time and credentials. (If you need a refresher on where to find peer reviewer 
decision makers, check out the previous tips in this chapter.)

308
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Enhance Your Credibility 
as a Thorough Reviewer
Building your credibility as a thorough reviewer step by step just might land 
you lots of peer review opportunities. If you have keen eyes and can easily 
spot typographical errors, a great way to build your credibility among grant-
making agencies is to notify them in writing when you find glaring errors in 
their publications and materials. Make sure to fully describe the errors and 
include your contact information and credentials. Why? You want the agen-
cies to know that you’re reading their publications and that you’re familiar 
with grant guidelines or RFP (Request for Proposal) instructions.
Get in the Door with Smaller 
Grantmakers
Many times small, local funders like community foundations, bank trust 
departments, and smaller corporations that contribute to community causes 
don’t have specific grant guidelines. The fact that they often receive tons of 
irregularly formatted grant requests calls to their attention the need for clar-
ity and consistency. Use the yellow pages and your local United Way to iden-
tify these smaller players in the grantmaking arena, and then approach them 
by calling and requesting an exploratory meeting.
 
When you go to the meeting, have a list of questions like these: How many 
requests for funding do you receive annually? How large is your grant request 
review staff? Would you like to have one standard reader-friendly document 
for all potential grant applicants? How can I help you reduce the incoming 
request chaos? Do you have an internal team that reviews all incoming grant 
requests? Do you ever use laypersons to assist with your grant review pro-
cess? Ask all of these questions, and then find a way to help with and partici-
pate in their peer review process.
Attend Technical Assistance Workshops
All types of funding agencies have technical assistance workshops. These 
workshops provide insider tips on how to research and write a winning grant 
application. I try to attend up to six of these local and regional workshops 
each year to get the latest scoop from program officers on what’s in and 
what’s out when it comes to applying for grant funding opportunities.

309
 Chapter 23: Ten Ways to Secure Peer Review Opportunities
While I’m at the technical assistance workshops, I seek out program staff 
from the funding agencies and give them my business card and indicate that 
I’m interested in participating in the peer review process. Knowing a face 
and a name helps open the door to the peer review process database quicker 
than a cold e-mail from stranger to stranger.
Network with Decision Makers
Most anyone can get heavy media coverage when hosting a fundraising 
event, open house, conference, or some other public event related to making 
money decisions. As a result, your local daily newspaper can be a source 
of info on the dealings of peer reviewer decision makers. Read it religiously 
and start planning to attend meetings, conferences, and other community 
or state-level events that the folks who make the decisions about funding or 
grant requests attend.
I once attended a wedding reception of someone whom I’d met only briefly 
and hit decision-maker gold! I was introduced to the governor and several 
state agency heads, which led to an invitation to sit on a public advisory 
board for the state’s Department of Labor. After I knew how this agency 
worked and who got funded, I stepped down from the board and applied to 
be a grant peer reviewer. My offer was accepted, and I reviewed incoming 
competitive grant applications for nearly three years. I didn’t get paid, but I 
did get lots of insider information on how the department wanted its grants 
written and what its funding preferences were. A few years later, I had a job 
where I was required to write grant applications to the Department of Labor. 
My insider knowledge helped me win millions of dollars in competitive state 
funding for my organization.

Appendix
A Complete Example of a Grant 
Application Narrative
T
his appendix contains the complete text of a grant application narrative 
that led to an awarding of funds. It’s addressed to a public state govern-
ment funding agency. My intent with this example is to show you how vari-
ous writing and formatting techniques — wording, spacing, highlighting, and 
bulleting — can work together in a successful document requesting grant 
monies.
In this example, I use a lot of boldface type to make the statistics leap off of 
the page for the agency’s grant reader(s), which of course is the decision 
making person or review team. Footnotes, a magnetizing table, and para-
graph borders round out the visual appeal to the decision makers. Remember 
that visual appeal is an important inclusion in a grant application narrative.
Note that this was also a very short grant application narrative for a govern-
ment agency. Don’t expect to see many guidelines that only require eight 
pages of single-spaced narrative. In this example, the agency asked for just 
enough information to make an expedited decision on who will receive this 
competitive funding.

A. 
Background/Need: 
1. Description of the need/problem in the target area. According to the Police Department of 
Hooterville and Browning County, in 2006 at least 73 homicides occurred in the county.1 A 
November 21, 2006, Public Safety Committee report on the Hooterville Police Department’s 
Uniform Crime Statistics Year-to-Date contained the following alarming facts: 
 
 In 2006, 45% of homicide victims (33) were between the ages of 16 and 25 years old. 
 Juvenile males of color who are 14 to 17 years of age make up 0.9 percent of the 
Browning County population, but accounted for 21 percent of all robbery arrests in 
Hooterville in 2006. 
 In 2006, juveniles accounted for 15.9 percent of all Part I arrests and 23.5 percent of 
all Part I violent crime arrests in Hooterville. 
 In 2006, there was a 13.9 percent increase in the number of juveniles arrested for Part 
I violent crime offenses. 
 In 2006, juveniles were responsible for 25.4 percent of total robbery arrests compared 
to 23.5 percent in 2005. 
 In 2006, 87.7 percent of all juveniles arrested for robbery had previously been 
arrested. 81.6 percent of which had between 2 and 12 previous arrests! Charges 
included: 26 homicides; 6 kidnappings; 243 robberies; 76 weapons violations; and 93 
assaults (32 aggravated). 
 In 2006, there were 114 unique juveniles arrested for robbery. These juveniles have 
amassed 1,255 total charges including their most current robbery arrest. In 2005, 93 
unique juveniles were arrested 111 times for robbery. 
 
Juvenile crime rates are alarmingly high, and they are even more alarming given the average age 
for first crime (12 years old). The five top reasons for referral to the Area Juvenile Court are 
traffic violations, theft of property, truancy, assault, and possession/consumption of alcohol 
(State Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges, 2005). Everyone involved with high-risk 
children and teens — from parents and teachers to Area Juvenile Court workers — agrees that 
these youth are out of control. The county’s risk factors for juveniles far exceed the protective 
factors (family, school, peers, and the community). Notable risk factors include the following: 
children who are delinquent by age 13 have little or no relationship with their father and/or 
mother; have siblings who have been court-involved; have experienced domestic violence in 
their home; have a parent with substance abuse issues; and have a parent who has been or is 
currently incarcerated. Also, delinquents are likely to have mental health issues and suicidal 
ideations or attempts. 
 
Clearly, delinquency prevention strategies need to progress beyond alternative school settings, 
suspensions, and harsh parental disciplining. Hooterville/Browning County youth need primary 
prevention programs that incorporate therapeutic mentoring, anger management, substance abuse 
prevention, programs to encourage self-respect, and parent education/family management 
components. The 2003 research conducted by the State Commission on Children and Youth 
shows that Browning County was the second highest county in the state for incarcerated 
juvenile populations (State Hall of Records, 2002) — this trend continued in 2006.

2. How the project will address the need/problem. The Mentoring Initiative for Underserved 
Truant Entrants (MINUTE) Program proposed by Dreaming for Youth, Inc. of Hooterville is a 
continuation of a comprehensive and coordinated system of services that involve collaborations 
with the Area Juvenile Court system and a local church. MINUTE incorporates U.S. Department 
of Justice (UDOJ) Office of Juvenile Justice Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) and U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services (HSS) – Substance Abuse and Mental Health 
Services Administration (SAMHSA) model program components. MINUTE uses screened and 
trained older youth mentors as positive role models for younger mentees. Therapeutic peer group 
counseling and discussion sessions address alcohol, tobacco, and other drug (ATOD) prevention, 
peer pressure resistance, low self-esteem, anger management, failing academics, and truancy. 
Intensive family counseling supports (including the youth) address positive parenting, family 
relationships, adolescent pregnancy prevention, and the creation a safe home environment, and 
these supports also connect families with critically needed human and social service resources. 
The purpose of MINUTE is to reduce the incidents of delinquent acts among 40 high-risk, 
predominantly low-income youth (50 percent will be females), ages 12 to 16, who reside in 
Browning County and are referred to the program by the Area Juvenile Court system. 
3. Standard Program Category. The MINUTE Program falls under the Delinquency 
Prevention Program Category – Year 2 Continuation Grant Request. 
4. How the project will assist the State Commission on Children and Youth (SCCY) in 
maintaining compliance with the JJDP Act. MINUTE addresses multiple JJDP mandates 
leading to delinquency prevention and improvement of the juvenile justice system. The 
MINUTE Program assists the SCCY in the following ways: MINUTE’s integrated service 
framework is a part of a comprehensive and coordinated community system of services already 
available to Hooterville/Browning County youth under the grant applicant’s state and county 
intervention and prevention services contracts. MINUTE provides direct delinquency prevention 
services to targeted youth. At least 50 percent or more of the youth referred to the program are 
and will continue to be minorities (leading to reduction of incidences of minorities in the juvenile 
justice system). In addition, the MINUTE Program incorporates best practices from UDOJ 
OJJDP and/or DHSS – SAMHSA. Dreaming for Youth, Inc. received SCCY funding in 2006. 
 
B. 
Project Implementation 
1. Description of the target population. The target population for SCCY 2007 funding is 40 
new high-risk, predominantly low-income youth, ages 12 to 16, who reside in Browning County 
and are referred to the MINUTE Program by the Area Juvenile Court system. At least 50 percent 
of youth targeted will be female. 
2. Description of the strategy for providing minority responsive programming. Dreaming 
for Youth, Inc., the grant applicant, was founded by a visionary with decades of professional 
counseling experience in the state’s low-income neighborhoods. Two of the three 
OJJDP/SAMHSA model programs selected for implementation under the MINUTE Program 
include Let Each One Teach One (intergenerational therapeutic mentoring delinquency 
prevention model) and Creating Lasting Family Connections (parent training model). All of 
the models selected address risk factors for high risk youth and their parents. 
3. Description of the strategy for providing gender-responsive programming for females. 
The third OJJDP model program selected is designed for high-risk females. Girls’ Circle has 
been piloted and proven effective with females of color. The model integrates relational-cultural 

314
Grant Writing For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
  
 3 
theory, resiliency practices, and skills training into a specific format designed to create positive 
connections, personal and collective strengths, and competence in girls. 
4. Goals for the year.  
A. Impact on the community: Goal 1 – Continue to provide delinquency prevention education, 
activities, and peer counseling to Hooterville/Browning County youth identified by the Area 
Juvenile Court system as being at high risk for becoming delinquent. Goal 2 – Continue to 
encourage and guide parents and caregivers of high-risk youth in obtaining and using the skills, 
goals, strategies, and knowledge needed to reconnect families and assist in delinquency 
prevention approaches with their child(ren). B. Strategies for achieving goals: – Continue to 
strengthen existing partnerships with the Area Juvenile Court system and with a local church that 
will provide the site for the MINUTE Program. – Meet with and involve referees’ 
families/caregivers within 48 hours of referral, in their home or at another safe, less restrictive 
environment, to conduct a family assessment and develop Individual Family Plans for 
delinquency prevention. – Use proven and outcome-based programs to intervene early and 
quickly for the benefit of youth who are at risk of developing emotional or behavioral problems 
because of physical, peer, family, or mental stress. Rationale: Each OJJDP and/or SAMHSA 
model selected for MINUTE has been tested in urban areas with similar populations. Evaluation 
outcomes show significantly high post-test results for youth and parents. The models are 
endorsed by OJJDP and/or SAMHSA. Dreaming For Youth has been designing and 
implementing therapeutic mentoring programs statewide since 2001 with demonstrated success. 
These models address both national and state outcomes for delinquency prevention. 
 
5. SMART objectives for each goal. 
Objective 1a – 60 percent or more of youth in the MINUTE Program will exhibit desired 
changes in incidences of peer and family relationships, antisocial behavior, ATOD abuse, views 
about teen sexual relationships, and self-criticism by the end of the fourth quarter. Objective 1b 
– 80 percent or more of youth enrolling in the MINUTE Program will demonstrate resiliency 
skills by completing their mentoring experience and peer counseling requirements, and by 
achieving other protective-factor-building goals by the end of the fourth quarter. Objective 1c – 
80 percent or more of youth enrolled in the MINUTE Program will complete a post-participation 
survey and convey satisfaction with their own preset outcomes and with their family’s outcomes 
by the end of the fourth quarter. 
Objective 2a – 50 percent or more of parents with youth enrolled in the MINUTE Program will 
demonstrate improved knowledge of ATOD abuse, family management skills, communication 
skills, family role-modeling of alcohol use, the need for youth involvement in community 
activities, and available community prevention/intervention services by the end of the fourth 
quarter. 
 
6. How the project will be implemented. Dreaming for Youth, Inc. has already met with the 
county’s Juvenile Justice Court judge to discuss the target population for SCCY and has 
developed a Memorandum of Understanding for high-risk, non-adjudicated school-age youth 
referrals to the MINUTE Program. In addition, over a dozen meetings have been held with our 
local church partner that resulted in setting days and times for MINUTE Program meetings. The 
new group of mentors/mentees will meet in single-gender groups once each week on different 
evenings. The local church’s 15-passenger van will continue to transport (if needed) mentors and 
mentees to the church from school/home and return them home. Supervised gender-specific 

315
 Appendix: A Complete Example of a Grant Application Narrative

mentoring and counseling will continue to take place on Tuesday and Thursday evenings. Parent 
training and youth/parent teams will continue to be held on Saturday mornings for 90 minutes. 
Once notified of funding, the following program components will be implemented: 
•
Let Each One Teach One (peer therapeutic mentoring): Qualified social work staff 
will assist in recruiting, screening, and training older youth mentors from Hooterville Public 
Schools and local universities for this intensive peer role-modeling component. The youth 
selected for peer mentoring models will be academically and socially successful. This curriculum 
model is designed to train a specific number of older youth, who in turn, instill the philosophy of 
each one teaching one. These one-on-one mentoring matches (gender specific) will support self-
efficacy and academic tutoring, and will minimize individual and school risk factors (for 
example, truancy and academic failure). Mentoring teams will meet for 60 minutes weekly over 
48 weeks (two 24-week cycles) in a supervised setting (Dreaming for Youth, Inc. counselors will 
be present). The teams will have weekly discussion/activity goals. Target: All youth enrolled in 
the MINUTE Program. 
• 
Girls’ Circle (structured support group): During this ten-week curriculum (two ten-
week cycles will be repeated), a group of girls of similar age and development will meet weekly 
with a Dreaming for Youth, Inc. counselor for 120-minute sessions. The girls will take turns 
talking and listening to one another respectfully about their concerns and interests. Staff will 
direct activities, including role-playing, drama, journaling, poetry, dance, drawing, collages, and 
clay figures. Gender-specific themes and topics will be introduced weekly, such as body image, 
goals, sexuality, drugs, competition, decision making, friendships, and trusting oneself. Target: 
All girls enrolled in the MINUTE Program. 
•
Creating Lasting Family Connections (family-strengthening curriculum and peer 
counseling): The six-week curriculum (four six-week cycles will be repeated) trains parents and 
youth. Parent trainings are designed to increase parent resiliency by improving their knowledge 
of ATOD abuse, family management and communication skills, family role-modeling of alcohol 
use, importance of youth involvement in community activities, and community services. In 
separate youth-oriented sessions, youth will learn to increase their resiliency through 
communications and refusal skills. Both the parent and the youth training encourage bonding 
within the family. Dreaming for Youth, Inc. counseling staff will introduce early intervention 
strategies and provide case management services. Case management services will continue for 
six months following the parent and youth trainings. When the family is having a crisis, in-home 
counseling will be provided by the Dreaming for Youth, Inc. case management staff. Target: All 
youth and parents enrolled in the MINUTE Program.

OJJDP/SAMHSA, was piloted in Colorado with males, ages 11 to 13, with delinquency and 
academic problems. Pre-program, the treatment group had six school and individual risk factors. 
Post-program, youth emerged with six protective factors. Girls’ Circle, which also was rated as 
promising by OJJDP, was piloted in California with girls, ages 9 to 18, with aggression/violence, 
sexual activity, ATOD abuse, and family functioning problems. Pre-program, the treatment 
group had 16 community, school, family, peer, and individual risk factors. Post-program, youth 
emerged with 14 protective factors. Creating Lasting Family Connections, which was rated as 
effective by OJJDP, was piloted in New York State with girls and boys, ages 9 to 17, with family 
functioning problems, delinquency, and ATOD abuse. Pre-program, the treatment group had 10 
community, school, family, and individual risk factors. Post-program, youth emerged with 12 
protective factors.

Performance Measures (See attached Delinquency Prevention Performance Measures 
table.) 
 
D. 
Evaluation 
The MINUTE Program is designed to address multiple JJDP mandates leading to delinquency 
prevention and improvement of the juvenile justice system (planning, referral, and system-wide 
coordination) in Hooterville/Browning County. The MINUTE Program will adopt and 
implement three OJJDP and/or SAMHSA approved model curriculums for youth and their 
parents: Let Each One Teach One, Creating Lasting Family Connections, and Girls’ Circle. All 
three address gender, cultural, and ethnicity learning model needs. Each model has been 
rigorously evaluated nationally and in Canada with treatment and experimental groups. All 
evaluators for the piloted programs used multivariate analysis methods to uncover direct and 
conditional relationships between the programs and outcomes and included treatment and 
experimental group comparisons. Evaluation measures and data collection information for 
the proposed program are on the attached Delinquency Prevention Performance Measures 
table. 
 
Linear Logic Model Rationale for the MINUTE Program 
Goals: Goal 1 – Provide delinquency prevention education, activities, and peer counseling to 
Hooterville/Browning County youth identified by the Area Juvenile Court system as being at 
high risk for becoming delinquent. Goal 2 – Continue to encourage and guide parents and 
caregivers of high-risk youth in obtaining and using the skills, goals, strategies, and knowledge 
needed to reconnect families and assist in delinquency prevention approaches with their 
child(ren). 
 
Objectives: Objective 1a – 60 percent or more of youth in the MINUTE Program will exhibit 
desired changes in incidences of peer and family relationships, antisocial behavior, ATOD abuse, 
views about teen sexual relationships, and self-criticism by the end of the fourth quarter. 
Objective 1b – 80 percent or more of youth enrolling in the MINUTE Program will demonstrate 
resiliency skills by completing their mentoring experience and peer counseling requirements, and 
by achieving other protective-factor-building goals by the end of the fourth quarter. 
Objective 1c – 80 percent or more of youth enrolled in the MINUTE Program will complete a 
post-participation survey and convey satisfaction with their own preset outcomes and with their 
family’s outcomes by the end of the fourth quarter. 
Objective 2a – 50 percent or more of parents with youth enrolled in the MINUTE Program will 
demonstrate improved knowledge of ATOD abuse, family management skills, communication 
skills, family role-modeling of alcohol use, the need for youth involvement in community 
activities, and available community prevention/intervention services by the end of the fourth 
quarter. 
 
Activities: Objectives 1a and 1b – Staff model curriculum orientation and applications training. 
Development of procedures for court referrals and community program site recruitment, 
screening, training, and matching of mentors. 
Objectives 1b and 2a – Referral intakes, youth/family assessments, individual and family 
service plan development. Weekly intervention components/activities. 

318
Grant Writing For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
  
7 
Activities: Objective 1c – Monthly partnership meetings and SCCY Regional Council interface. 
Ongoing quality improvement and evaluation of outcome indicators. Evaluation reports to staff, 
board, and SCCY Regional Council. Objective 2a – Ongoing and follow-up case management 
for youth and families. 
 
Outputs: Number of full-time equivalents funded by Federal Formula grant funds. Number of 
planning activities conducted. Number of program slots available. Number of youth served. 
 
Outcomes: Short-term – Number and percent of program youth exhibiting desired change in 
targeted behaviors. Number and percent of program youth completing program requirements. 
Number and percent of program youth satisfied with program. Number and percent of program 
staff with increased knowledge of program area. Long-term – Number and percent of program 
youth exhibiting desired change in targeted behaviors. 
 
Dreaming for Youth, Inc. will seek technical assistance in the MINUTE Program’s 
implementation and evaluation process from a leading Psychologist and Consultant. Data 
findings will be used to assess the program’s effectiveness and take appropriate corrective 
actions that eliminate program weaknesses. 
 
E.

G. 
Future Funding Strategies 
1. After SCCY Ends. The grant applicant is aggressively seeking funding through the local 
school district and from the State Department of Education to provide delinquency prevention 
services. In addition, the grant applicant has secured the services of a national grant writing 
consultant to help pursue federal funding that incorporates mentoring programs for high-risk 
youth. The grant applicant will apply for funds from the U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services, Administration for Children and Families – Mentoring Children of Prisoners. 
2. Maintaining First Year SCCY Service Levels. The grant applicant will supplement the cost 
of the MINUTE Program with other grants and contracts in order to meet the funding reduction 
formula mandated by SCCY of 75 percent in Year 2 and 50 percent in Year 3.

The bestselling guide to getting 
funding from governments, 
corporations, and foundations
Want to get a grant? This proven guide offers up-to-date 
advice on putting together a successful grant proposal — 
from researching your options to dealing with application 
forms to compiling a winning contract bid document. 
Whether you’re a new grant writer or a veteran fundraiser, 
you’ll see how to win more grant awards in an increasingly 
competitive funding environment.
•  Get started with grant basics — understand the difference 
between grants and contracts, start the planning process, and 
manage the paperwork
•  Show me the money — locate worldwide grantmaking 
organizations (whether public, private, or international) and get 
the dollars you need
•  Play and win the grants game — demonstrate your need through 
powerful writing and convince peer reviewers to rate your 
application with the maximum points
•  Write a competitive application narrative — prepare each 
section of your funding request, from the cover letter and 
abstract to each section of grant proposals and contract bids
•  Increase your funding success rates — give funders the specifics 
they’re looking for, build grant applicant credibility, and craft 
the Corporate Letter Request
